review/summary: Coconut Oil
review/text: I have been using coconut oil for cooking, baking, and just spreading on toast & vegetables for about a year.  My whole family and friends are hooked on it.  It is so delicious and it is very good for you too!  I had to start buying it in this larger size because we were using up the 1 pound size so quickly.  It lasts for years too, so no worry about it going bad.  It just makes more sense to buy this size and save money.  I still buy the smaller size to take with me on vacations.  Wouldn't be without it!!  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because even though this brand is very good, I have tasted some that is even better.  But the price of this is very good. Thank you for carrying it on your site!

review/summary: Great Alternative for Conditioner!
review/text: I've been using this product for 2 months now, and it's AMAZING! I have wavy hair and it's very fine. I've noticed that whenever I use deep conditioners or any other type of conditioner, my hair will fall out excessively. So I decided not to use conditioners, instead I use Nutiva's Coconut oil daily (only on my ends & on dry hair) and it leaves my hair incredibly soft, shiny, and easy to untangle! I also use it once every other week as a deep-conditioner (through out my whole hair & leave it in for half an hour to an hour), and my hair doesn't fall-out as much as it does with other conditioners!!! I seriously LOVE this product, my hair feels a lot healthier and it's also more manageable, I also get a lot of comments on how shiny and silky my hair looks! I really recommend it. My only suggestion is, if you dislike the smell of coconut, this product is not for you. The smell is very strong and tends to linger on the hair, personally I love it! And one last thing, a little goes a long way with this product, if you apply too much, your hair will appear greasy!

review/summary: Good oil, but raw foodists beware "extra virgin" is not the same as raw!
review/text: This oil is extra virgin, but not raw. It is cold-pressed, but the processing tempurature rises above that of truly raw foods. Email Nutiva if you want more details on their process. They had the info on their site at one time, but I could not find it there today. Aside from that, this giant tub of oil is great for hair and skin. About once a week I saturate my hair with this oil and leave it in for 15 minutes to 1 hour before I shower, then I shampoo 2-3 times so my hair's not greasy and do not need conditioner for a few days. I also apply the oil to my skin after I wash, but while still in the shower. Then I just lightly rinse the oil off with water only, after giving it a few minutes to soak in. This way my skin gets moisturized without that greasy residue that usually takes so long to soak in. Good for when you are headed to work and don't want that greasy look for an hour or so after application. Nutiva previously had a truly raw version of this oil, but just found out from their website the Nutiva folk's supplier of the raw oil could not keep up with demand so they had to remove it from their site! There are other brands of raw available on other internet sites, but have yet to see any on Amazon.

review/summary: favorite coconut oil
review/text: In 1892, pathologist William Osler described a whitish area on a heart, the telltale sign of myocardial infarction.  In hundreds of thousands of autopsies over two centuries, none had been found before.  As consumption of vegetable oils increased, heart attacks became increasingly common.  By 1930 they were the leading cause of death in America.<br /><br />I prefer the fats that people ate for thousands of years before the epidemic.  Nutiva smells good and can be spooned in winter.  It's cheaper than some brands.  Large jars are practical because it stays fresh on the shelf for many months after opening.

Coconut oil does well with high heat cooking, without the negative health aspects from high heat that other oils have.<br /><br />In addition to moisturizing effects, coconut oil promotes skin elasticity. I use it on my skin as well.<br /><br />Since i use alot of coconut oil, i have tried many brands. Nutiva is the best brand by far.

review/text: This is the second purchase I've made of this product. It's the cheapest way to buy it and we use about two of these jars per year. It came double wrapped in a zip-lock bag for safety against melting (had it been warmer). Never mind that it has a seal under the cap. Anyway, the oil is wonderful and I use it in place of shortening for a lot of my baked goods plus we'll put a dollop in a mug of coffee.

review/text: I heard about the healthiest oil on the planet as being coconut oil so I had to read and study it to make sure...  I ordered 3 books chock full of information about coconut oil.  The names of the books that I ordered through Amazon were: The Coconut Oil Miracle, Eat Fat Look Thin, and Coconut Lover's cookbook.  I read them all and am on the phase I or the Coconut Diet at this time and very pleased with my weight loss so far and even more pleased with the fact that I do not stay hungry...  that morning omelet that I have with a grapefruit is so filling that I have no interest in the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake or pie out there lol ... amazing for me let me tell ya!! lol.  Although I do eat later in the evening a salad and either fish or chicken and drink lots of water I am satiated and feel great!!  I certainly do recommend this product and for those of you that believe the stories that have circulated for years that coconut oil is among the bad oils for your heart... please order either The Coconut Oil Miracle book or the Eat Fat Look Thin book and read for yourself that this oil actually prevents heart disease.

review/text: I tried the Nutiva brand after purchasing another brand of coconut oil. I love the taste of this brand and use it all the time - my local health food store has it on sale quite often. Coconut oil has many uses - I just scoop out enough product and place in storage containers to use on my hair/body and the rest stays in the kitchen to use for cooking. I find that it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin when I need to address dryness. Sometimes I add a drop or two of Eucalyptus essential oil to  the coconut oil and apply to my body as well. Works great as a hot oil treatment for your hair - since coconut oil is in a solid form at 76 degrees or less - just heat up a small amount in a container and apply to your hair.

review/text: this product is absolutely amazing ! i first tried it when i found it at my local health food store and it keeps amazing me to no end. I use it as on my skin and in my tea . I wanted to share something so others may find this helpful. I work with Veterans as a volunteer and advocate i have one vet who has poor circulation in his legs and feet he also gets blood clots. He has had the swelling for almost 20 years , he is grumpy and miserable and normally hates to try anything new and will always complain about things no matter if its good or not. we went to his dr and they did not want to put him on more meds due to possible liver issues and so i mentioned could i try the coconut oil that i have , the dr said sure give it a try . so when we got back i brought the oil over and rubbed it into his legs and feet then put a coconut body butter over it and put his socks on, the next morning i stopped over to check on him and i was looking at his legs he was so amazed he was in shock just in 12 hrs his legs had gone down and the pin and needle s feeling had lessened, i continued for a week we went back to the dr and they were shocked and asked what it was i was doing , i explained the product and what i did they wrote the name down and was going to try it with other patients. this vet raved about how great it was and has kidnapped my jar and has had me go get him a case to keep on hand. it not only brought the swelling in his legs down but the cracking and dry skin on his legs and feet were gone  and the color was no longer purple  i will always keep this product on hand and use it for alot of my veterans who have skin issues.  but make sure with your dr before you use it...

review/text: Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is the best coconut oil I ever tried. Its pure and natural. I never seen coconut oil so raw and the texture is smooth as silk. Its easy to mix with other ingredients. Once you try this product, you will never go back to your old coconut oil again. I  mix it  in with my favorite hair conditioner. My hair never looked this great.<br />I microwave it for 20 seconds, mix with favorite hair conditioner, place onto hair while its warm. cover my hair with plastic cap for and hour, and rinse with cool water. The results are great. I would never use any other coconut oil only Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil. It's the best.

review/summary: Coconut Oil is awesome
review/text: It was not too long ago that I learned that the common understanding about nutrition is completely wrong, for example, saturated fats such as butter, lard and coconut oil are very stable, and do not break down in high heat. Moreover, this trait is protective of human health, plus, we should be eating MORE fats due to the need for the fat-soluble vitamins. (Don't even get me started on the cholesterol fraud.) So I was thrilled to learn I could obtain coconut oil on Amazon.<br /><br />The coconut oil arrived quickly. After having used 'polyunsaturated' oils for so long, I chuckled to see the coconut oil was solid, hence, the tub, rather than a narrow-necked jar.<br /><br />I got the tub in summer, so somewhere along the way, the stuff got soft and slid sideways. But no prob. And yes, when I run out, I'll get more from the same place in a heartbeat.

review/text: This is a very good product. I had a strange area on my leg that always itched and even my doctor didn't know what it was. I think it was some weird fungus I picked up in the hospital years ago, because that's when it seemed to appear. I tried all sorts of creams to get rid of it and after reading up on the benefits of extra virgin coconut oil I decided to try it myself. The area has healed and I still use this as a moisturizer for my face every night instead of all of the expensive products that I used to buy containing "peptides" etc. I also have started eating it and feeding it to my pets every day. I think we all look a lot healthier.

review/text: I only give this product 4 stars because it comes in a plastic jar.  Glass would be much better on the environment- but also more expensive so...On to the product!  This coconut oil not only smells great, but tastes great too.  I put 1/2 TBL in my fruit smoothies, use it in my raw icecreams and puddings, and even use it in my hair products. My favorite use for the coconut oil is as a hot oil treatment; 1/4 cup mixed with 10 drops of rosemary.  Despite the plastic, I will probably continue to order from Nutiva as I did some research before purchasing and find them to honestly care about producing a wonderfully fresh and organic product.

review/text: We've been buying our coconut oil from Whole Foods as well as other health food markets, but we decided to give Nutiva coconut oil a try mainly because of the price offered on Amazon. To our suprise this oil has exceeded our expectations! It smells wonderful and tastes good too. It is at least on par or superior to the products purchased at Whole Foods and health food stores but at a much lower price. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this product to family and friends, only problem is that most people are still sceptical of the health benefits of coconut oil. When I mention the use of coconut oil, most people just shake their heads and respond that they're not into "crazy fad diets". Too bad, their loss.

review/summary: Nutiva organic coconut oil
review/text: This is a really nice value, and a delicious product. Be sure to read up on the benefits of raw coconut oil, and remember, never put anything on your skin that you wouldn't eat. I'm actually a raw vegan, so this is a big staple for me. I love massaging sea salt and coconut oil into raw kale salad. Add ginger, cayenne, a bit of tamari, and a squeeze of lemon. Healthy and delicious! If you aren't a raw vegan, but you just want to eat healthier, try replacing all your regular oils and butter with raw coconut oil. Coconut has a much higher tolerance for heat before it becomes harmful to the body. It's way more tasty than butter or any kind of butter substitute too. This coconut oil is raw. It smells amazing and is super healthy. I use it for everything, from salad dressing to raw vegan deserts, to stir fry, skin moisturizer, hair finisher, massage oil, etc. It's amazing on baked yams. If you eat toast, try mixing raw coconut oil with honey and using it as a spread.

review/text: If you are looking for a healthier oil to cook with than corn or mixed vegetable oils, try this product. My husband read about the benefits of coconut oil in the book "Patient Heal Thyself" and in "The Bottom Line" publication a few years ago. Previously we have had to purchase this at health food stores, relying on their stock at the time. Now we can order it here and have it in a couple of days. The product itself is wonderful, and arrives in a plastic container, which is safer around the kitchen. As long as you keep it in a cool place it will keep a long time. The only thing I Don't fry with it is garlic. For some reason that combination is putrid, but onions, peppers, chicken, green beans, pork chops, are all delicious and the coconut adds a light, sweet flavor of its own.

review/summary: Excellent Quality at GREAT Price
review/text: I have tried quite a few different brands of Extra Virgin Expeller Pressed Coconut Oil and this has got to be one of the best.  I use it for everything....frying,sauteing, baking, skin lotion, hair.  It works really well on my kids' dry skin, and they love when I apply it to their lips because it tastes and smells yummy.  The health benefits of this product are outstanding..it's really a "Super Food".  I have researched prices online extensively and Amazon has the best deal on this oil.

review/text: My cat LOVES these treats!  She was very shy and reclusive when we first got her, and spent most of her time hiding under the bed,  but we see more and more of her now since we introduced the treats. She's crazy about them! If any of you cat owners are about ready to give up on your shy cat like I was, keep trying! Reward your kitties with treats whenever they socialize with you and soon they will be running to you, not away from you! :-)

review/summary: Finicky Cats Here
review/text: I realize it's a matter of taste, but in spite of everyone else's rave reviews for these, Larry and Mo, very independent opinionated cats, hate these. I thought "great reviews, soft treats, salmon, slightly cheaper than Whiskas Temptations...woohoo!" BUT, even Easy Mo turns his nose up at these...they will only eat them if they think the other one is going to...heaven forbid that one cat should get something that the other one didn't! Now, I can shake a bag of Temptations and Larry will magically appear out of the Ethernet. With Temptations, they remind me of those cats in the commercial where they are clinging to the guy's legs so they look like furry slippers, only an observer would say to me, "Cute slippers, but did you notice they don't match?" Larry & Mo's preference list is: 1. Whiska's Temptations (especially the Barbecue ones!), 2. Whiska-Temps Tartar Control (or Dentabites, whatever they are called), 3. W-Temps Hairball Control Treats (They will sit and look at these for several minutes before approaching them), and dead last, the WLTM Treats...requiring two competing cats to prod each other into eating them. Sorry, WLTM Mfg., Larry and Mo say, "Back to the drawing board..ah, test kitchen...for these."

review/text: When my grocery store no longer carried these, I had to make a special trip to the pet store.  I like to get soft cat treats because they're a change from their dry cat food.  I've tried other brands, but these are my cats' favorite.  And just like the name says, they're lickin' their lips afterward for a minute ot two--so it's a treat that lasts more than just a moment.  They will come from around the house when I call them, and even get up from a nap, since I've been giving these treats.

review/text: I was in a liitle shop in the Tampa area specializing in hot sauces. I knew this sauce as "Aunt Lucies Hot Sauce" from Dennery St Lucia when I worked there in the late 80s. I used it on everthing especially any chicken dishes as well as adding to cheese and spaghetti sauces. This is one of the few hot sauces that have a distinct flavor and do not just burn the inside of your mouth.I took an chance on the made in St Lucia label and was not dissappointed. After nearly 30 years it is just as good as I remember!

review/summary: The best - according to Dad
review/text: Originally, I purchased a bottle of this hot sauce for my dad from a missionary that visited our church a couple of years ago.  My dad LOVED it.  He said that it was not only hot, but had the best flavor of any that he had tried (he's 71 yrs old).  When he got almost to the bottom of the bottle, he saved it.  He is retired and they travel a lot. He could not find it anywhere.  I started looking on the internet, found it and started comparing prices from different websites. Amazon had the best price.  I bought him 7 bottles.  All arrived safe and sound.  When he opened his present this past Christmas you would have thought we had given him bottles of gold!

review/summary: Best HOT SAUCE IMO
review/text: Baron's makes the BEST HOT HOT HOT Habanero sauce in my opinion.  I discovered it on St Lucia and fell in love.  At first just one drop is positively NUCLEAR, then it grows on you.  Since capsaicin is a neurotoxin, you develop a tolerance and need more to get the same bang.  This is a common phenomenon.<br /><br />I brought back several bottles and went through them, then needed to find another source, not having travel plans to return to St Lucia.  It was only then that I discovered that this is actually a Hot Mustard Sauce.  It was so hot and flavorful I just didn't realize it was mustard-based!  And I don't care for mustard!!!<br /><br />After buying a case of bottles from the local ethnic food $tore, once I went through them I thought of searching the internet.  Who knew there were larger bottles???<br /><br />This purchase was ideal.  A large bottle (three times as large) for the same price as a smaller one, it came quickly, was fresh and had an expiration date three years hence.  I will go through one bottle in about two months!<br /><br />I cannot recommend this higher for anyone who likes his sauce HOT, flavorful, and yes, slightly mustardy.

Many hot sauces are just hot, and they have little more flavor than a bottle of vinegar. This sauce truly tastes great, and it is really hot. I will buy this hot sauce for as long as they keep making it.

review/text: These crepe cookies are out of this world! I believe everyone should try these cookies at least once in their life.<br /><br />My first experience with these cookies was in a high end grocery store.  Found them to be more expensive in the grocery store, but i decided ill try them once in my life.  Now these cookies have become an obsession.<br /><br />The cookies have a flakey texture and have this lightly sweet taste that just makes my mouth water.  These crepe cookies are neatly packed into a golden wrapper with two crepe cookies.  The exterior has a wonderful golden color with a slight glaze to them.  Once a crepe cooke is in your mouth you can bite but the sweetness, which is not overpowering, just melts into your mouth.  I would recommend these to anyone who loves flavor without the crazy overpowering taste of sugar.<br /><br />I am a true believer when it comes to these cookies.  I will purchase them over and over again.  I wish there were more cookies per package.  Makes it hard to share because these cookies are so good!

review/text: I haven't even tried the tea yet, I'm sure it's wonderful as are all Twinings teas.  I did want to write a quick review regarding the packaging.  I collect tea tins, and I love the cornflower blue color of this one, which is why I chose this seller, and this particular item, when other, less expensive versions (in a paperboard box) were available.  When I got the tin, it had a long, ugly barcode sticker attached, which I have been unable to remove. It also had a small sharpie mark across the barcode.  Really negligible, but when added to the sticker, it's just irritating.  I paid for a new product, and expected the tin in new condition, not closeout/clearance condition.  As a single mom, money is very dear, and when I spend it on the occasional small treat for myself, it is so disappointing when something like this happens.  But I AM looking forward to getting past the packaging so I can enjoy this wonderful tea...

review/summary: My special kitty loves this brand!
review/text: Switching your cat to a renal diet can be very difficult.  The renal foods have low salt and low phosphorous to help control the electrolyte imbalances that are common with chronic renal failure/insufficiency.  This makes the food a lot less palatable than your standard cat food. Some cats will eat any type of renal food and others won't take to it at all, regardless of the brand.<br /><br />The prices of renal foods are much more expensive than your standard food too. I like that I can get Royal Canin Renal here on Amazon without having to go to vet to pick up each bag.<br /><br />I highly recommend trying this brand first but if your cat doesn't take to it, here are others you can consider:<br /><br />Royal Canin Renal Canned<br />Hill's Prescription Diet Feline k/d (dry & canned)<br />Hi-Tor Canned Neo-Diet Feline Canned Kidney Diet<br />Iams Veterinary Formulas Renal Multi-Stage Renal (dry & canned)<br />Purina NF Kidney Function (dry & canned)<br />Medi-Cal Feline Reduced Protein --  This one is specially formulated for cats with advanced kidney disease, chronic liver disease and heart failure.

review/summary: Great food, HORRIFIC PRICE
review/text: My cat had critically high protein levels in her kidneys prompting my vet to put her on a strict kidney protection program since there are no animal organ transplant operations being done.  I just couldnt let her suffer.<br /><br />Luckily, this food she actually eats. Best of all, IT WORKS!  Her kidney enzimes are back in the normal range thanks to strictly keeping her on this diet.  Unfortunately, the price of this food is OUTRAGEOUS!  $40 for a 7lb bag?  C'mon. That is rediculous.<br /><br />I am stuck since she cannot have any other food without deadly consequences.  I have no cable, no phone, no cell, no movies, nothing just to afford this food for her.  Yes, it does work, but my God, get real on the price people.  I would google other places than here, because the sellers are ripping you off.

review/summary: Great, not sure about "blend"
review/text: Had I read the other review prior to ordering this brand, I probably never would have ordered it.  However, my experience with this olive oil led me to reorder 2 3-packs.  Originally, I ordered the 25 oz. bottles, and they leaked all over the shipping carton.  I think it's because of the pop-up type spout, but the bottles appeared entirely sealed.  I did worry a bit that if oil could leak out, perhaps air could get in and spoil the product, but I used all the oil and enjoyed it.  However, after the initial order, I chose these smaller 17 oz. bottles, and the package did not leak.  All I really want is classic non-virgin olive oil at the best price, and this is the closest thing I could find.  I am satisfied with it.  I don't refrigerate it, and have had no problem other than the leaking of the larger bottles.

review/summary: Marketing Gimmick - Focus on easy pour bottle - Substandard olive oil
review/text: Buyer beware of this product.  It coagulates and congeals to a thick white paste when chilled.  It takes on the appearance of solid animal fat.  I  called Sovena USA Inc for an answer.  The Sovena Inc. Customer Service Rep. took a week to get back to me and then explained that this is a "blend" and should not be chilled.  He could not tell me what is  in this blend and said that it will take time for him to research and get an answer for me.  I am still waiting for his response (almost 2 weeks later).  I subsequently purchased Botticelli Olive Oil to see if it reacted the same way when chilled and  thankfully it did not.  I made the exact same tomato salad using the 2 brands of oil and the Oliveri blend encased the tomatoes in a greasy thick disgusting mess.  The tomato salad made with the Botticelli Oil looked as appetizing when I took it out of the fridge as it did when I put it in.<br /><br />Tomato Salad Recipe:<br />2 ripe vine tomatoes - cut in large cubes<br />1/2 cup olive oil - (I recommend Botticelli Extra Virgin Olive Oil)<br />3 cloves crushed garlic<br />1 tsp. salt<br />1/2 tsp. oregano<br />Mix ingredients together, chill for at least 1 hour  and serve

review/text: My wife is picky about her coffee. I myself can drink a variety of brands. This coffee just suits us the best. It's not bitter, very smooth and you can't get a bad cup.  If you like strong coffee, this won't be for you.  I do like a strong cup once in a while and I can't get this stuff strong enough. It has flavor tho and we are happy with it.

I've looked a lot of places and I'm so glad I finally found it! As far as the heavy plastic bag it comes in, unless you are going to use it all in one week, I suggest breaking it down into weekly sized bags and freezing them.

review/summary: Try it cold brewed.
review/text: Been drinking this stuff for about a month and I really love it. Since it's the summertime I've been drinking this stuff cold brewed. What I love about guayusa is that it can steep for a very long time and it actually accentuates the flavor. First I dissolve a couple of teaspoons of honey with warm water into a 10-cup pitcher and fill it with about 12 teaspoons of guayusa (or you can do 1 teaspoon per 8oz but I sometimes add more in case the cold brew technique doesn't bring out all the flavor). Then I just fill the entire pitcher with cold water and let it steep overnight in the fridge. Eight hours is desirable, sometimes more. I accidentally forgot about it one time and had it steeping for 24 hours and it tasted even better. It has a very nice and smooth taste to it, not bitter at all. Recommended.

review/summary: Best Winter Breakfast
review/text: I found this in my pantry while looking for the Fruit 'n Cream Quaker Instant Oatmeal we usually eat (I like the peaches and cream flavor), and I gave it a shot.  It was so good!  The instructions made it so easy... Basically, the  oatmeal comes in an oblong pouch (paper-feel), you rip it open, dump it into a bowl, fill the pouch with water, pour it over the oatmeal, pop it in the microwave for a couple of minutes.  And tada, hot and delicious breakfast!<br /><br />I usually have a large breakfast, so I use two pouches at once--double oatmeal, double water, put it in the microwave for 3:30 minutes.  I mix in a teaspoon of honey, and it's just right for me with a mug of hot tea.  I've been sick the past few days, and most food has not sat well with me, but this oatmeal has been very easy on the tummy.  Also, it's whole-grain and has flax seeds in it, which adds more fiber to your diet and helps digestion.<br /><br />My only mystery was where it came from.  I assumed it must have been from the local Whole Foods, but they didn't carry it when I asked.  It turns out it was from Target, and my MIL put it in a care package she sent us!  Sometimes mother knows best, I guess. :)<br /><br />The package is kind of small though.  It's compact and a space saver in the pantry, but for someone like me, who goes through oatmeal fast, I wish it were bigger.  I'd be happy if Amazon sold it as subscribe & save with free shipping, as I'd love to buy it in bulk (at least 20ish packets at a time).

review/summary: Benriach Dark Rum finished is as light as a feather - perhaps too light
review/text: I have a hard time believing Benriach 15 Dark Rum cask finished single malt whiskey is really aged 15 years. It's tow-headed pale yellow: among the lightest colored whiskey's I've ever seen. The aroma is nice - marshmallow, cake batter and butterscotch. With extended time a clear pineapple note comes to dominate the aroma. The pineapple and butterscotch aroma (pineapple upside down cake?) is yummy. On the tongue it is filigreed and lacy. Cerial honey, cake batter up front. There are some fruit esters at midpalate (apricot and sugar cane) and distant wood notes at the finish which is moderately short. My issue here is that there is too little oomph. What flavor there is here is nice - but there's a bit too little for my taste. Looking, smelling, and drinking this I would guess it has 8 years in the wood - not 15.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: When Starbuck's discontinued the decaffeinated version of Verona, my wife and I sought a new coffee source. I found Coffee Bean Direct at Amazon. Ordering 5 pounds of whole bean coffee at once was intimidating, and I thought about looking for selecting a mixed group of half-pound samples,but if they were available in decaf, I missed them. I suppose that the safest thing to have done, was go with the Columbian using the water decaf method, but we've not liked most of the Columbians we've tried. My wife saw the Creme Brulee flavor, and we both love Creme Brulee. Flavored coffees can be delicious, but five pounds! Nonetheless, I agreed. The coffee arrived, and I knew the moment we opened it, that it would be difficult. The beans were supersaturated with flavoring oil. The artificial flavoring is so strong, you can't taste coffee at all. The only solution I can see at this point is to buy some local beans and mix them with the flavored or trash the rest of the coffee. I read the other reviews, and they praised the coffee, so I can only assume our taste is different, or else the quality control in producing this flavored coffee has much too wide a variation and we got an unlucky batch. My conclusion: five pounds of coffee at once is too much to risk unless you have previous experience with the flavor AND confidence in the quality control of the company.

It is whole bean, so you'll need to have a grinder. I normally buy preground, but I have to admit grinding a little at a time does keep it tasting fresher. I just store the extra beans in an airtight container in the freezer. Keeps them fresher. Even after delivery, I still plan to purchase additional coffee from the vendor, only I think I'll be needing the fully caffeinated variety this time.

review/summary: Simply the Best
review/text: After Hershey decided to "improve" it's Dutch chocolate I had to find a replacement for my chocolate desserts.  I brought every brand Amazon sold and tried them in my ice cream receipe. The taste just wasn't right, so I knew the cakes, pies and other desserts would be a disappointment to a family of chocoholics until I tried Callebaut.  The taste is what you want for ice cream, and no one could believe I could make a better devil's food cake than I already did.  So don't waste your time or money, stick with a proven winner!

review/summary: The Best Cocoa for All Recipes
review/text: When Hershey decided to change their Dutch Process cocoa powder around 2004, I was compelled to find a replacement that was as good.  I tried every cocoa powder out there and nothing was  as good.  About a year later, Cooks Illustrated did a taste test on cocoa powder and Callebaut came out on top (January 2005).  I found it online and decided to order it even though it came in a large quantity and it was a bit pricey.  I have never used any other cocoa powder since.  It is fantastic and worth it.  I get huge compliments on all of my chocolate recipes and I know it is the Callebaut cocoa.  Your brownies will never taste as good with any other cocoa powder.  Your homemade hot chocolate will be the envy of all the kids in the neighborhood.  I find ways to use the quantity within a year and no one complains!

review/summary: fantastic cocoa powder!
review/text: I did a side by side comparison between this and the Frontier Dutch Cocoa Powder I had on hand and all 10 of the people I fed the chocolate cookies to chose the Callebaut and said it was WAY better.

review/summary: For chocolate lovers
review/text: I wanted to try this Callebaut Cocoa Powder after it was top-rated by America's Test Kitchen/Cook's Illustrated (they never let me down!).  It is great.  It is a very large bag so I wouldn't buy it if you just bake occasionally, but I'm guessing you wouldn't be here in that case anyway :)  It is also a lot messier than the old Hershey's cans because the side of the bag is coated with plastic so the chocolate sticks to it and all over the inside of the bag.  I just store my bag of cocoa powder inside of the storage bag it was shipped in (bag inside of a bag) and it keeps all chocolate off my cupboards and shelves.  I do get chocolate all over my hands every time I need to measure some out, though, and end up washing my hands multiple times to avoid transferring it to the outside of the bag and the rest of my kitchen.  However, I will still buy it again; it is worth the quality to me, if you can afford it.  Sorry to ramble about the mess; otherwise its great!!

review/summary: The Best
review/text: This is the best cocoa powder I've used.  I had tried supermaket brands before and the best of those was Ghirardelli.  That's good, but this is terrific.  It has a wonderful deep chocolate flavor.  I make my own chocolate syrup and it comes out wonderful with Callebaut.  It even has a deeper darker color.  Everyone noticed the improvement.  This makes a great hot chocolate too.  And it improves baked items.  It's all I'll use from now on.

review/summary: Better than some, but not great
review/text: I have used every brand of cocoa available.  Some of the best (and cheapest) I've used are A&P's Master Choice Premium and the no longer available Hersey's European Style with the silver label.  I prefer dutch processed cocoa and found Callebaut was not quite as good as Bensdorf, available from King Arthur Flour online.

review/summary: Not what I expected, but not bad...
review/text: I had gotten Valrhona cocoa powder from a spice shop it is what I was used to from culinary school but I was looking for a better bargain when I was asked to make a wedding cake.  First off it was very difficult to determine whether this is a Dutched cocoa (it is).  When I got the product, I noticed that it is much lighter in color and flavor than the Valrhona.  I still received a lot of complements on my cake but I was disappointed with the light brown color and less rich flavor than the rich deep brown color and flavor of my test run cake made using Valrhona.

review/summary: Very flavorful!
review/text: I've been making a simple hot cocoa recipe to try various cocoa powders, and I hadn't found one that impressed me until I tried the Callebaut powder.  The flavor is rich, deep, and complex.  Plus, the powder is very fine, and it dissolved well in hot water/milk.<br /><br />Note: When I ordered it, it was "Prime Eligible, fulfilled by Amazon." Right now, it's not eligible, which increases the cost by almost 40%.  But I'd still probably pay for it, because this stuff is so much better than the competition.
