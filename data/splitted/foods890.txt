review/summary: Has A Wonderful Texture And Taste
review/text: I am actually someone who will buy baby food and eat it just to get some extra serving of vegetables.  I put them in smoothies and to add flavor to soups as well.  This one I tasted cold and it tasted like squash, nothing artificial and the texture was perfect. Very smooth and creamy which is one thing that I really love about it.  Another thing I love is it being organic and GMO free. These are packed with nutrition perfect for growing babies.  I did notice however though when I heated it up the taste changed which I found to be strange. Heated up it tasted like spaghettio's which was kind of a turn off to me. I dont know how the babies feel but I am sure they wont know the difference.  I think that I will stick to buying cascadian farms frozen winter squash.  That has a better taste when heated up.  But for smoothies and soups, possibly even to put in bread to moisten I will be purchasing this from Earths Best.

review/text: This winter squash tasted strong to me, but my 8 month old refused to eat anything else for several days.  I even got her to eat up some flavors she didn't like by mixing it with them.  I always have trouble getting the lids back on the jars with this brand, but she gobbled the squash down so fast it didn't matter.

review/summary: broken, moldy, and wet INSIDE the packaged shipping box.
review/text: I opened the mailed box which was completely in tact and normal.  When I opened it, immediately a smell overcame the entire kitchen.  I cut the plastic bubble wrap off of the box of squash and noticed it wet and MOLDY!  One of the glass jars was broken and appeared to be for a while.  There was mold and STINK everywhere.  I called and thank goodness AMAZON offered to replace or refund it.  Why would they send something like this for a BABY.  My son was premature 30 weeks and has an allergy to protein along with reflux...I cannot imagine!  It really made me horribly upset and why I am writing this review to ZERO...This is the first time I ever had a problem and a huge one it is to me.  - AND I tried to give a ZERO star rating but I had to check a star to continue.

review/text: This is not your typical baby food review.  I ordered these for my cats so they can have more fiber in their diet (issues with constipation), and they LOVE the winter squash baby food.  My two cats go crazy simply hearing the "pop" sound of a newly opened jar.  The jars themselves are made of pretty thick glass, so I've had no issues of glass breaking.  Can't beat the price per bottle (after subscription) anywhere else on the web or at the local grocery store.  Totally satisfied customer here.

I CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE, they KINDLY sent me another order, which also arrived with only 2 packs of 6-1 ounce boxes.<br />HOW FRUSTRATING!<br />The customer service people were in Jamaica, and were very hard to hear, but were very nice, and helpful, but, they have no control over the people at the warehouse.<br />VERY SAD DAY FOR AMAZON, BE WARNED!<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MZJT8K">Sun Maid California Golden Raisins (1-Ounce), 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>

review/text: This is a delicious cocoa powder for baking or mixing into hot milk. It is unsweetened but has a slight natural sweetness. I have learned to enjoy it with any added sweetener, thus avoiding the calories of sugar and any possible side-effects of chemical sweeteners.<br /><br />I tend to get heartburn easily and this is one of only two cocoa products I've found that don't give me heartburn. The other is from a store that does not have a web presence and is not local to me, so for me it is worth paying extra to get this cocoa.

review/summary: Made in China and my dogs got sick
review/text: Maybe what the box claims is true, no additive, no coloring, etc. However I did not notice it was made in China until I have looked at the bottom tip of the bag. Using tiny font size (more like 6pt), it states the product is made in China. While I appreciate the honesty, I could not trust the quality of the sweet potato itself. And I found that out after feeding a couple of them to my dogs. I am not stating all Chinese products are bad. However, most of produce I have dealt with came with great disappointment. To make matters worse, My two little dogs got sick. I have stopped feeding them and now they are ok. I still have 4 bags left but I plan to throw them away.

review/text: I bought 6 of these in Jan 09. They had an expire date of 2010. I opened up one of the packages and I found two moldy pieces. I didn't want to risk mold in the other packs so I tossed them out. I email Dogswell for a replacement, I asked for a different product and they wouldn't do anything unless I shipped them. Not a huge deal, but really you want to ship back dog treats that were moldy. I use Amazon Prime to save time, not waste it.

My concern is they are about and inch and half long and do not want to have my dog swallowing something that size and  hardness.  As canines are gulpers, I am concerned.  The same product with the the chicken and apple is much softer.

review/summary: Made in China
review/text: I didn't realize when I bought these that they were made in China.  In fact, I fed them to my dogs until someone looking at the package pointed it out to me.  I'm a little leery of buying dogs treats from China and other developing countries since the melamime incident.  Who knows what oversight there is on the production.  So, now I order *only* Snook's sweet potatoe dog chews from Healthy Happy Pet (through Amazon).  These are organic dried sweet potato chunks made in the US and my dogs **love them**.  I also get Sam's Yams but the Snook's are nice and crunchy.  I got a small bag for my sister's Shih Tzus and they loved them as well.  If Dogswell would find a place in the US to make their products, I'd be willing to buy.  But as long as they are made in China-- won't do it anymore.

review/summary: Stay away
review/text: I will admit at this moment I have no hard data to back up my suspicion, but we have been feeding these to our two dogs, one of whom is diabetic. Due to the fact that the chicken and apple treats boasted such bona fides as "no hormones" and "no antibiotics", we felt good about serving these up.<br /><br />The other day, the diabetic dog began throwing up, and I took her to the vet yesterday. The vet called with the results of the blood work and said the dog's liver enzymes had spiked. She asked me if we were feeding her chicken jerky treats which might be made in China. I knew about the Dogswell treats, but I was certain they weren't of Chinese origin. When I was at the store later, I picked up a package and found to my amazement that they are, in fact, Chinese.<br /><br />The vet will run tests on the remaining treats in the package to see if there is any melamine in the meat, but the change in her liver coincides with her getting these treats. I wouldn't advise anyone feeding these to their dogs without first checking the health of their dog's liver and the chemical composition of the treats.<br /><br />Rated One Star, only because Zero Stars is not an option.

I've fed my English Bulldog pup more treats than I care to mention and these are his favorite.  An especially a good choice for dogs with allergies!  From a taste standpoint, if he had his way he would eat the whole bag.  This is the closest thing to "scraps" that I've intentionally fed my dog.  From a health standpoint, bullies are know for their skin problems.  Kingston's coat is very shiny and his eyes and nails look great, too.

I would feel more comfortable with their claim of "natural" and "healthy" if I knew where they were made.<br /><br />Edit:  Once you open the package, you should put them in the refrigerator, as a previous reviewer stated.  I found that one of the pieces had gone bad (which, in turn, shows that they have very few preservatives).

My dog has had the biggest variety of treats but the only ones she will jump and whine for are these Dogswell chicken treats. She gets the chicken breast strips during her daily brushing, and then the chicken/sweet potato or chicken/banana ones whenever she is being left at home by herself. She loves them all. The sweet potato doesn't need to be refrigerated but the banana does. All retail stores sell these packages for at least $16.99-$19.99; Amazon.com offers a truly unbeatable price!

If they ever went organic it would be the only treats I would buy her.

review/summary: Great treat!
review/text: This is the only treat I give my dog - well, these and carrots.  So many treats can upset his stomach so a sales clerk recommended these.  They take a while to chew up, like beef jerky - so I can use this as I leave the house.  Kind of like "here's your treat and I'll see you when I get home."  Get's me out the door without any drama.  Doesn't mess with his digestion either - good stuff!

review/text: I have 2 pomeranians who go absolutely bonkers for these treats.  You would think they have some sort of meat in them!  They are hard, but they are meant to be a rawhide alternative, meaning, the dogs are supposed to gnaw on them!  We started with these because I read the oldest dog in the the world (who has since passed) ate Dogswell treats.  We started with the Chicken Vitality Treats, but have since found out that one of our Poms has allergies to chicken.  These are amazing and my dogs cannot get enough.  I love the price on amazon and the delivery is SUPER quick.

review/text: I bought the sweet potato snacks on a whim at Target.  Our beagle LOVED them.  To the person who commented that the potato gets tough, they are supposed to be that way.  Raw hide bones, pig's ears, etc. are much tougher and dogs don't choke on those either.  Your dog won't choke unless it is a toy breed in which case you should consult with your vet about what treats they should not have.  The toughness of the snacks is actually great since they take a while to eat and our beagle doesn't scarf one down in two seconds.  Also, it's nice that they don't have artificial coloring or preservatives.  I'm buying them in bulk now that I see Amazon carries all the flavors!

(Keeps her occupied and away from me too especially when she is being her attention hogging self.)<br /><br />I like the ingredients, all natural, although I am not expecting this product to give her much of "vitality" or "healthy hips" (Vitamin and supplements are just way to low a dosage to do any good really.)<br /><br />It does feel pretty moist, and if she didn't rip open the last bag and ate it all, it probably would go rancid pretty quickly.  I also recommend refridgerating after opening.

They're very expensive in stores, so I was overjoyed to find them available on Amazon. Not only are they mega-cheaper here, BUT if you order them on the auto-delivery program, they're even less! Plus, it's been so hard to find them where I live, that it's great to have them delivered to my door. The only problem is, my doggie loves them so much that I had to increase the frequency of my order, LOL. I like it that they're really good for her too with no chemicals or weird ingredients, and they're made right here in the USA.

No one who loves their pet will buy them, but Amazon will at least give us a fair chance to protect our beloved pets from these poisons imported from China.<br />As a loyal customer, I expect Amazon to protect me and my loved ones from hidden threats. Amazon MUST disclose the country of origin for ALL food products!

We had her teeth cleaned by the vet, who told us her teeth would probably be a lifelong problem.  We were told to brush her teeth daily, but we couldn't even find a canine toothpaste that did not contain ingredients from the above list (beef liver being most common).  We also tried various "hypo-allergenic" treats for her, but most are very expensive, and she didn't even like them.  About three years ago, we started giving her one of these every day, alternating between the Vitality and Happy Hips varieties.  She liked them immediately and still goes crazy every evening at treat time.  She had her annual dental cleaning last month, and the vet told us that her teeth are in great shape.  We consider her improved dental health to be a result of giving her these treats each day.  I would definitely recommend this to families with dogs who have allergies!

review/summary: Made in China but my dogs love them!
review/text: I am looking for other sweet potato treats that are made in USA. I would feel more comfortable.  Having said that, my many little toy dogs do love these, even two older ones who have lost their teeth.  They just suck on them until they are real soft then swallow the soft parts. The treats themselves are rigid, some are bendable. I add a little water to a bag to  soften them first and it works. I worry about my little guys choking on them but they haven't.  Sure beats those awful rawhide treats I use to give them. I quit when one of my dogs almost choked to death on one.You have to be careful, if you do add water to refrigerate these so they don't get bacteria build up. Sweet Potato chews are just the best idea ever. Why did it take so long? Too bad we can't depend on things from China, but that is just the way it is.

review/summary: crispy chicken?
review/text: Having purchased this dog treat (my dog's absolute favorite treat) in the store, I was surprised to find the mail-order version was different--the chicken wrapped around the sweet potato is much browner than any I have seen in a store. My dog still will eat it, but isn't as interested as he was with the less-cooked chicken version. I will say, though, that buying in quantity makes this treat a lot more affordable.

review/summary: Yummy. More like a mild ginger animal cracker than a cookie
review/text: I am a huge fan of ginger snaps. When recently diagnosed as needing to be gluten-free, and recently pregnant, I've been on the hunt for GF ginger snaps. I've tried three:<br /><br />Mi-Del Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br />Annie's Homegrown Ginger Snap Gluten Free Bunny Cookies<br />Mary's Gone Crackers Love Cookies Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br /><br />1. Mi-Del<br />Texture: a bit grainy. Crunchy, but crumbles in the mouth in that gluten-free grainy way that is not my favorite texture<br />Ginger flavor: middling, a tiny bit spicy on the tongue but not too much<br />Sweetness: sweet, like you'd expect a cookie to be<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick<br />Density: the most heavy or dense of the three<br />Overall 2 or 3 out of 5 stars<br /><br />2. Annie's<br />Texture: a bit grainy, but less so than Mi-Del. Very crunchy. Little goldfish-sized crackers perfect for kids or snacking.<br />Ginger flavor: the most mild of the three, has that gingery hint to it, but not enough where it is spicy or leaves a tingle on the tongue<br />Sweetness: mild, less sweet than Mi-Del. More like eating an animal cracker than cookie. Tastes great with a slice of cheese.<br />Size: about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch, and very thin<br />Density: light<br />Overall 4 out of 5 stars. If you wanted a kid-friendly cracker-like snack, this would be 5 of 5 stars<br /><br />3. Mary's<br />Texture: VERY crunchy, not at all grainy. Texture was the least "gluten-free" like of the three. Felt like I was eating a regular cookie.<br />Ginger flavor: very spicy. I could only eat two or three crackers before my tongue needed a break (but I'm not big on spicy foods in general so consider me on the sensitive side). I actually prefer a ginger cookie to be like this though. Plus, it killed my pregnancy nausea in minutes - bonus.<br />Sweetness: not as sweet as Mi-Del, but not as mild as Annie's. very pleasant to me.<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick, basically the same as Mi-Del.<br />Density: Ultra light, most airy in the center<br />Overall 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Everyone's tastebuds are different, but these were my perceptions. I personally want a ginger cookie with a good "bite" to it, and I really can't stand gluten-free products that are grainy in texture (which seems to be most of them). I want the texture to act like a regular gluten item. For me, Mary's fit the bill exactly, and Annie's was a close second. Annie's was so different though, I'd eat Mary's as a cookie, and Annie's as a snack, so I could see having them both in the pantry.<br /><br />The one I still want to try is Pamela's, because it has great Amazon reviews. I just don't want to buy them in bulk until I try them, so I need to find them locally.

review/summary: Great for graham cracker crust!
review/text: They are a little bit grainy, not overly sweet and don't have a lot of spice, however I rated them a little higher because they're my go-to cookie when I need to make a gluten free graham cracker pie crust or base for lemon bars, etc. I pulverized them in the food processor and made a crust for a key lime pie with them the other day and no one could believe the crust was gluten free. I didn't give it a 5 because there are better cookies out there if ginger snaps are really what you're after, but the mild spice and lower sugar level work in their favor when used as a replacement for graham cracker crumbs. The other available graham cracker alternatives I've tried have been horrible.

review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect as I had never tried Annie's ginger snaps before, but I do like the Annie's line of products, so was willing to try these.  They are very crunchy!, somewhat grainy (as I guess most gluten-free products are), and very light on ginger flavor.  I don't think my kids will eat them, but they should go nicely with a hot cup of tea.

As a matter of fact, on the car ride home, we weren't talking about the expensive pasta, steak, or seafood that we had consumed... it was all about the bread.  Over the course of the next few weeks, I went out of my way to purchase and try several of these oil seasonings until I found the rosa maria blend.  It was so great that we came to Amazon to buy a 6 pack!  It is the perfect addition to olive oil for dipping breads!  Order this now and give a few out as gifts, or just stock up and save.  Either way, you win!!!

review/text: This green tea, like a lot of them is very weak.  It has been very difficult for me to find a good green tea at a decent price.  Tzao makes a decent green tea but their price is a lot higher than others.  One thing you can look at is how many ounces of dry tea they put in each tea bag.  If they only have 2.19 ounces of tea per 40 tea bags, you know you're looking at some weak tea.

review/summary: Absolute comfort
review/text: I'm waiting for the FDA to classify Bigelow's Organic Green Tea as a controlled substance.  I find that many green teas have a raspy, grating edge.  With traditional green teas, if you leave the bag in the water for a nano-second too long, you get this vile concoction that you can use for staining pine cabinets.  Perhaps even worse are those teas that employ some kind of artificial fruit sensation.  It certainly isn't fruit, but the essence of fruit overwhelms the taste of the tea.<br /><br />The Bigelow Organic Green Tea is unadulterated harmony.  I switch to this tea from coffee at work at about 11am.  No jitters, and something warm and comforting on my desk for the rest of the day.  I find that I don't even need to remove the tea bag from my travel mug.  The tea just grows deeper and more nuanced as it steeps longer and longer.  This stuff is wonderful.<br /><br />Each box contains ten hermetically sealed foil envelopes.  There are four bags in each envelope.  Tear one open, take out a bag, then fold over the envelope to keep the remaining bags fresh.  You don't have to worry about the tea becoming desiccated.  If you love smooth, natural tea, I think you'll like this green tea.

review/text: The quality of the tea itself is not the problem here(though it is not that great), its the quantity in each bag that I have an issue with.  Compared to other brands of organic green tea, these bags seem to contain about half as much green tea leaves, causing me to use two bags for each cup of tea I brew, otherwise I just end up with a dissatisfying cup of weak tea.  Go to Trader Joe's and get a box of their organic green tea,their tea bags are filled generously, and your tea will be a nice bright green!I'm sure there are other great brands of organic green tea, I just have had great experiences with the Trader Joe's brand. Bigelow brand seems to be trying to make up for the more expensive costs of providing you with organic tea by skimping on the amount in each bag. I really don't blame them though, they gotta keep profit margins up in these tough times.

review/summary: It's Organic, OK? -  And more than acceptable taste
review/text: Hardly a connoisseur of green teas, I nonetheless consume lots of it -- on a typical workday, I drink 4-6 packets of the stuff. There are surprisingly few options for organic tea, though I imagine this will change gradually over time.<br /><br />Bigelow packs these with one overall paper wrapping, and several bags are enclosed in a separate sealed wrapper. Intended to preserve freshness (see the Wikipedia entry for green tea for more on this), this is convenient if you want to pack several bags for lunch at work.<br /><br />I'd also tried Celestial Seasonings' (non organic) green tea, and notice that it was somewhat less tolerant of boiling water than the Bigelow product, which Wikipedia tells us can cause green tea leaves to produce bitterness. Celestial Seasonings green tea offering seemed to pack slightly more taste, but the difference is small in my judgment.<br /><br />I have an unscientific suspicion that an almost-boiled product might release more unwanted chemicals from non-organic farming, and since I drink lots of tea, it seems worth the additional expense to buy organic. Lipton sells what is to my palette an equally acceptable green tea, but it's not organic.<br /><br />I recommend mixing this with Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea, Cinnamon Apple Spice also available from Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E65OII">Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea, Cinnamon Apple Spice, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  Even a single occasional bag of apple spice will add a pleasant tangy flavor to the typically (let's admit it) bland green tea flavor.<br /><br />I'm currently purchasing both products through Amazon's Subscribe and Save. Bigelow products are rarely discounted by local grocers, save the occasional promotion on a specific flavor.

review/summary: Love this tea
review/text: I had not had much experience with green tea prior to this purchase, and chose this product based on reviews and economy.  So while I can't comment on the "authenticity" of the taste, I can say that I loved this tea.  I got out of the habit for a while (okay, more like a year or two) and then remembered, "Hey, I should start drinking green tea again!!"  So I dug it out of the pantry and it was still wonderfully fresh and delicious due to being packaged 4 bags to an airtight pouch.  Perhaps this is needless extra packaging, but for me it's great because I can throw a 4-pack in my purse and take it on the go.<br /><br />I like that this tea is organic, and I have found the taste to be light and smooth.  I've tried the Bigelow (non-organic) green tea, and oddly it always has the weirdest smell and taste to me.... it sounds weird, but it reminds me of a barnyard at a fair or something.  This organic variety, for whatever reason, has a much cleaner taste than others I've tried.  For 240 tea bags at 10 cents each, especially when you know they will last a looooong time, this is a great purchase on a good quality green tea.
