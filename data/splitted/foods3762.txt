review/summary: Our counter would be so cluttered without this drawer!
review/text: My mother graciously bought us a Keurig as an early Christmas present, to which I cannot thank her enough because we love it. After we had it up and brewing, I looked at K-cup storage options because it truly is a necessity for our tiny kitchen to be a functional as possible.<br /><br />After searching on several websites, we came to Amazon and found the Nifty 36. After reading other reviews (and the picture also helps to confirm) that this works with K-cups and not just with pods, we bought it. We are so happy with this purchase! The carousels would take up too much room. This is sturdy, fits nicely with the Keurig on top with enough room to not have it too close to the cabinets above. I have no complaints! Good value for such a space saving K-cup storage accessory. (I'm even buying one to give someone for Christmas for their Keurig I love ours so much!)

review/summary: Amazing fresh flowers and lot's of them!
review/text: Ordered their 6 month Frequent Flower club subscription off of Amazon.  Wasn't sure what I was going to get but had some points I needed to use to I went ahead and ordered 6 months.  I was very impressed by the quantity and the quality of the flowers.  Each month I received a variety of flowers, two bouquets, sometimes two similar ones, sometimes they were different.  There were so many flowers I divided them up and made arrangements for the kitchen, the dining room table and even small arrangements in the bathrooms.  They're super fresh and come with several packets of preservative so as long as you change the water and cut them mine typically lasted at least 10 days looking super fresh.  This is my first month without them, I'm going to reorder another 6 months subscription because I really have missed them this month.  I'd highly recommend them!

It's a bit like apple juice actually, only it tastes healthier in a good way.  :)  The matcha is vibrant and light and the apple is more like a combination of real apple and candy apple.  Quite nice.  There is something a bit off with the flavoring.  It has a bit of chemical flavor, but it is not too bad.  I still enjoyed this.

review/summary: A Matcha A Day Keeps The Doctor Away
review/text: So I am mightly impressed with matcha. For a few weeks now, I've been having a cup almost daily, and I have to say I'm seeing benefits. I don't know if it can all be blamed on the matcha, but the matcha is the only real change I've made recently. When a tea company makes claims about the healthiness of their teas and how this tea will make you skinny or that tea will calm your anger, I tend to just laugh it off. Just another marketing ploy, I mean, really, it's just tea. It's delicious and better for you than soda (if you don't weigh it down with tons of sugar and cream like I used to do), but it's still just tea, not some magic potion that's going to solve all of your problems.<br /><br />Well. Since matcha came into my life, I'm more alert (obviously) and my system seems...cleaner. I don't feel bogged down by the terrible foods I sometimes indulge in, and somehow my system seems less responsive to my dairy allergy. Don't get me wrong, it still makes me sick, but it's not the gut-wrenching "I'm gonna die" feeling I'm used to, it's more of a "Oh man, I forgot and ate dairy again". On the whole, I just feel healthier. Which is awesome. Everyone can afford to feel a little bit healthier, am I right?<br /><br />Anyway, this tea smells amazing. Like juicy Granny Smith apples, sweet and tart all at the same time. I want to dip this tea in caramel. The flavor is perfect. It's exactly what I expected this tea to taste like. It's very juicy, my mouth is watering after every sip, and it's tart without being stomach-turning sour. I am having a really hard time not adding some of my Red Leaf Tea Caramel matcha to this. They're just begging to be blended. In college, I was big fan of the Caramel Apple shot, which is basically one part sour apple Pucker to one part butterscotch Schnapps. This seems like a good alternative for me to take to work and not get fired! Though now I'm wondering about matcha cocktails...<br /><br />I love these matchas that are encouraging me to mix and match, play with different blends, bake...I love it! I wish I had the time to just lock myself in my kitchen with my matchas and experiment to my little heart's content.

review/summary: Not for power chewers!
review/text: I did not buy these chews from Amazon but didn't have the option of reviewing the product in a way that didn't reflect poorly upon the seller on the site I purchased from. The seller I dealt with was lovely but I definitely don't feel that way about this product or the Flint River Ranch company.<br /><br />I understand that antlers are a natural product and will have some variation but I think the sample image does't represent what you actually receive. I was disappointed when I got these chews in the mail. If you order these they may definitely be smaller than what you see in the image. They all were cut to about the length I expected but the diameter varied pretty greatly from one to the next.  I bought these for my 50 pound, 7 month old lab and can't imagine these holding up to her let alone a larger dog as they seem to be advertised for.<br /><br />One of the chews I got was smaller than a quarter at one end (I think it measured about 3/4 inch in diameter) and clearly came from a tapered tine of an antler rather than a main beam as the picture seems to indicate they will be. I won't give my dog antlers that narrow because she will try to crack them rather than just gnaw and I don't want her to fracture a tooth doing that. The other two antlers were thicker but one was not very dense, and seemed to be older and more weathered than the others. I had concerns about my dog being able to break shards off this one since it already had cracks developing in it. Honestly, the last one would have been fine but at the price I paid for one useable antler, I know I could get a better, larger one for the same price. So, I decided to return them.<br /><br />At this point, I contacted my seller who told me to contact the company to initiate the return since they were shipped directly from there. I did and was told they didn't accept returns on the antler chews. Instead they offered me a discount on a future purchase that I do not anticipate I will be making from Flint River Ranch. I contacted the original seller again and she had not been informed by the company that this was their policy. I went to the official Flint River Ranch site and didn't see this policy anywhere either. I probably wouldn't have ordered them if I had been aware that they are nonrefundable.<br /><br />So the summary is that these  may be fine for large dogs that don't actually chew that much or for smaller dogs than they are advertised for. If you don't like what you get from the company, you are out the $45 or more that you paid for them because they apparently don't take them back.  The distributor I dealt with offered a refund anyway since she had them advertised as returnable but I'm not sure everyone will be that lucky. I won't buy these again for my dog and will return to buying higher priced chews where the jumbo chews are actually big enough to stand up to heavy chewing.

review/summary: Smaller than Expected
review/text: I give the antlers themselves 5 stars.  My dogs love them, they are long(er) lasting, and they don't leave stains, smells or spots.<br /><br />However I give the size of the antlers I received 3 stars.  Definitely smaller than I would expect for "Extra Jumbo."<br /><br />I have two medium sized, power-chewer dogs.  As in they've destroyed black kongs, ripped off slats of 6 foot fencing to chew on, and any stuffed toy gets the stuffing ripped out of it in minutes.  It took them a week to get through each antler.  Granted, for an average dog, I'm sure it would take significantly longer.  But there is a reason I sought out the "extra jumbo" size.  As soon as I opened the box I was disappointed; I do think they were smaller than the antlers pictured.<br /><br />The description only says "packaged by weight," but it would have been nice to know how much weight to expect.  The weight would also be beneficial to know when deciding between the sizes, and in verifying if I received the right size.<br /><br />That being said, these antlers are a fair amount cheaper than similarly sized ones in dog stores.  I'm sure they would be fine for less aggressive chewers, but I've found a different seller who has some real jumbo antlers.

review/text: Chex get very soggy very quickly.  Unless you slurp this stuff down then you're going to have a bowl of mush before you're through.  Worse yet, the texture of the `apple cinnamon' coating is very gritty and so you'll have a bowl of sandy mush.  Flavor-wise, the cereal is decent.  It doesn't have a strong apple flavor or even a strong cinnamon flavor.  In fact, once the cereal sits a few and the coating starts to dissipate into the milk you're kind of left with plain old Chex mix in a bowl of sugary milk.  I really expecting something great here, and I was excited to dig in, but after my first bowl I found myself forcing myself to finish the box since no one else in the house would touch it.

review/text: Blech. I had high hopes for this cereal but it fell flat due to far too high sugar content and exceeding sweetness. The pieces seem to be double-coated in the flavor powder; they are oddly "fuzzy" and turn your milk into a cesspool of sugar slop. The pieces get mushy right away, too, making breakfast even more unappetizing. This would be much better if they threw in an even number of unflavored pieces to balance out the sweetness and overall flavor. Also, it may be gluten-free but it gave me a bit of a tummy ache. Won't be buying it again.

review/summary: Great tasting time and money saver
review/text: I like to use porcini mushrooms in sauces and ragouts.  Using the smaller bits costs less and takes up less storage room over the larger size porcini pieces available from this vendor. While I love the flavor of porcinis I don't think they are very pretty so larger pieces generally do not add visual appeal to dishes.  I sometimes add a few black trumpet mushrooms for visual presentation.  JR has great Black Trumpets too.<br /><br />JR Porcini Kibbles are very high quality and are just the right size.  So to use them just soak them in hot water for about half an hour, no additional chopping needed.  I use a ladle to retrieve the hydrated mushrooms from the water then strain the water through a coffee filter to remove any grit.  I use the resulting 'porcini tea' in my recipes.

review/text: I also buy a jar of mixed dried mushrooms regularly, but when I want a major hit of "porcini" flavor, these are great. It takes very little to add flavor to a dish. The flavor is great, and so is the value.

review/summary: good size, good value, good flavor, but sandy!
review/text: these 1/4 inch chunks of dried mushrooms pack a great deal of flavor. the photograph is not really accurate, at least for my batch--mine were more consistently sized and larger than the shreds that are depicted.<br /><br />i have bought many packages of whole porcinis at much higher prices, and the quality of these nuggets is roughly the same. the mushrooms are of good, consistent quality--i've not encountered any dark, crinkly, off-flavored pieces in the package (typical for inexpensive porcini).they've worked well in the recipes i've used them in. one complaint: i cannot seem to get all the grit out, no matter how many times i strain, sieve, soak. that's true of some much more expensive mushrooms, so not a deal killer for me. it's hardly noticeable.

review/summary: Improved: bite-size cuts & thicker gravy
review/text: My cat, Spot, was very sick a couple of years ago, and the only thing I could get him to eat was Fancy Feast. He's much better now, but still a pickier eater than he was before he got sick. He still loves Fancy Feast, however, the quality became unreliable.<br /><br />The meat was often rubbery: I could actually hear it squeak against his teeth, and pieces often shot out of his mouth; the gravy was often very watery, and there was sometimes so much of it that it was more like soup than cat food. Unacceptable, especially for a premium cat food.<br /><br />I was in the process of looking for something else that would appeal to Spot when I received the most recent shipment.  I was pleasantly surprised. The meat is now tender, not rubbery, and the gravy is very thick. Spot can't get enough of it. I still have some of the old food in other flavors, but all he wants now is the new stuff.  My search is over. We're sticking with Fancy Feast.

review/text: When you open this can of food for your cat,  you'll notice right away that it's packed with fish.  My cat gobbled this up right away - the protein level is high, the flavor must be right on.  The odor isn't bad as it is with most tuna products - you don't really smell it at all, which I found to be surprising.  Great food but the price here is about $6 more than what I pay for it at the grocery store.  Highly recommend!

He has rejected several other "natural" dry or dehydrated raw dog foods -- Orijen, Addiction (he liked this for awhile), Canidae, Stella and Chewy's, etc. No digestive problems, no stinky breath (why would I want pizza or even fishy dog breath?).  I have tried all the Acana dry foods --I order the trial size so they stay fresh -- and the price is reasonable for the quality.

review/summary: when you want the best........
review/text: Caffe Bomrad just hit three home runs in my book.<br /><br />Quality<br />  From the opening of the bag, the aroma drew me closer. Not too oily, but rich and dark. I had to try a cup as soon as my package arrived so I pulled out the grinder and set the grind to course (I will expand on this later).  I put 4 Tbsp in my coffee press and added 16 oz of water. 4 minutes later, my new best friend was there to great me.  The 2mm dark brown foam stayed on top as I poured the coffee for both my wife and myself. She added pure sugar and some frothed milk and I, usually taking my coffee the same as hers, decided to try the coffee uninhibited. We both drew the cups to our noses and took in the new aromas as they were much different than any we have had here in California.  The taste was full, but without any bitterness. We immediately knew that we have found our new staple to our morning wake up.<br /><br />Service<br />  Before sending off $50 to Italy for coffee I had never heard of,  I checked out their great website and even shot off a quick email inquiring of grinding recommendations for this higher quality bean/roast.  Within 6 hours, I had received an extensive email back detailing the desired grinds ( and amounts ) for drip, press and espresso.  To top it off, the emails came from the Bomrad family. This, in my opinion, is a family who takes great pride in their product and their name, not to mention raising the bar extremely high in terms of of customer service.<br /><br />Value,<br />  I was hesitant to spend $50+ on 1kg of coffee until my wife reminded me that I drop that on a bottle of Cab at dinner all the time.  I agreed and then ordered.  For us, the coffee was worth every $$.  If you enjoy great art, wine, or culinary delights; you have spent hundreds of dollars to give yourself the best.  With Caffe Bomrad, you only need to spend an extra 10 cents a cup more to give yourself the best coffee/espresso you can serve yourself.  Enjoy.

review/text: I received Caffe Bomrad Torino as a gift last Christmas.  When I opened the bag, the aroma of the beans made me want to try it immediately.  I went to their website to learn more about the coffee and how best to brew it.  My gift came with a new coffee grinder so I made it using my French Press.  I couldn't believe how good it tasted.  It wasn't oily and it didn't leave a bitter after taste.  After finishing my gift, I purchased my regular brand and couldn't believe how inferior it tasted, so I ordered some more.  It may seem pricey at first, but Kona coffee is a lot more and this is cheaper than buying a cup at the local coffee house.

review/text: Posting this on behalf of my husband who wrote this and is the coffee drinker in the family...<br /><br />Overall, this is a very quality product and consistently delivers an outstanding experience.<br /><br />Specific observations -<br />�Initial Taste - Drinkable and holds a consistent flavor profile as the temperature cools - for me this is a quality of a very well done and structured bean / roast / coffee<br />�Color - Very good dark color<br />�Nose - Pleasant aroma that does not come across as harsh, but very round and smooth<br />�Food Compatibility - Exceptional in the morning with food (specifically, with my French toast)<br />�Flavor Profile - Well balanced from beginning to end and does not fall off or become bitter.<br />�Acidity - it complements the structure and contributes to the blend, but does not define it.  As a result the finish is extremely refined.<br /><br />I am basing this review on six mornings of 2 to 3 cups - the first cup with food and the remaining cup(s) consumed within an hour or so while working.  Additionally, I experimented with various grinding times and observed that that a finer grind resulted in a consistent and rounder cup.  I have used a drip maker to date and will experiment with a French press over the next few weeks.

review/text: I'm embarrassed to admit that I got suckered in by all the 5 star reviews and took a chance on this massively overpriced coffee.  The coffee itself is average at best, nothing really distinguishing about it.  It's fine as a daily drinker but doesn't really work as an espresso and certainly isn't worth the massive premium charged.<br /><br />I have since looked at all the 5 star reviews more carefully and it appears that many reviewers have not reviewed any other products (classic sign that the seller is the one doing the "reviewing").<br /><br />Needless to say I won't be making the same mistake twice, there are many better coffees out there at a fraction of the price.  I hope this helps others from making the same mistake I did.

review/summary: Not suitable for espresso
review/text: After reading so many great, five star reviews on amazon about this bean, I had really high hopes for Bomard's Torino coffee.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I think maybe this bean just isn't really all that well suited for making espresso. It is a medium roast, and the beans do smell very nice, but it just didn't seem to be able to produce a really great shot of espresso for me. Crema production was relatively low and even when up dosing to 15 grams on a single shot, the flavors weren't really all that good. At 8 grams (for 1 oz), the shot was flat and thin.<br /><br />I'm not sure if Torino is a blend or a single origin bean, but for espresso it seems to fall a little bit short. With that said, I could see where this coffee might be better when used for pour over or with something like a french press, etc.<br /><br />Some coffees work well for espresso, some don't. At this stage, after dialing in the grind and pulling a few test shots, it seems like this might not be the best bean for espresso enthusiasts. Crema production is almost zero and the flavors are rather unpleasant when compared to other espresso blends.

review/summary: Probably made a mistake...
review/text: I wanted to love this coffee.  The service on the Caffe Bombard coffee was fine, but I really expected more Italian 'oomph' in the roast. the write up says "Ambrosial Aroma, Great Body, Delicious Flavor, Long lasting Finish" and honestly it's not quite there. The aroma is great, the body is a bit weak as is the flavor.<br /><br />I know that northern roasts are more subdued than southern Italian, but this is quite mild.  While the beans make a decent cup of espresso especially for an afternoon cup, it doesn't stand up to the milk/foam in a latte or cappuccino. My most demanding customer, my wife, says that she can't find the coffee amongst the milk.  Like I said I do enjoy a straight espresso using the beans, but I also like to enjoy the occasional latte, and this doesn't cut it. Perhaps I should have realized it before purchasing. And now I have a kilo of the beans that will not be fresh by the time I should be finishing them up.  Oh well.  It would be valuable if the beans were offered in a smaller quantity to try out.

review/summary: Soft, Subtle Blend
review/text: *****<br />Stash's Fusion Red & White Tea has a fragrant bouquet, and an unusual taste that comes from the blend of red tea and white tea. The red tea taste is more dominant, the white tea taste subtle. I have to say that I like the red and white blend more than the red alone. I still probably prefer white tea more, but this blend is lovely, and lower in caffeine (the red tea has no caffeine, the white tea a bit). This tea contains only South African rooibos (another word for red tea) and white tea.<br /><br />The package says that it contains a hint of sweetness, and I'd agree, although the taste is very hard to describe (if you've had red tea before then you understand). The package also says that this tea is full of "potent antioxidants", which of course is very healthy.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Fusion Red & White Tea unless you do not care for rooibos or white tea; otherwise you will enjoy this.<br /><br />Recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Not for my cup
review/text: This nutmeg is Indonesian.  I'm not sure if that is what the problem is, but the Carribean nutmeg is different.  Indonesian nutmeg is lighter in color and lighter in flavor.  It's okay, but the Carribean nutmeg is richer in color, scent, and flavor.  And it's crispier.  That's important, because the softer Indonesian nutmeg doesn't work in my shaver.  It's probably fine in any grinder, but not in my little shaver.  The gripping spikes slip in the soft nut and you have to constantly fiddle with the nut to get shavings.  If you don't know what a nutmeg shaver is, return your coffee maker for a refund and stick with Starbucks.  I wound up with this product, probably for the same reason as a lot of you; it's the cheapest one.  Well, you get what you pay for.  It works, nothing wrong with it, but there are better quality products out there, and if you use a shaver, you really must pick one of the other options.

That was really good and different. The bread by itself was very good, also and was not stale like I was afraid it would be. I would highly recommend this for Passover and for diabetics. It is one of the things on the diabetic list of foods that they can eat. I hope everyone had a happy Passover. Shalom

review/text: I noticed these treats at the local store and thought the concept sounded delicious - real peanut butter cookie dough covered in chocolate and individually wrapped for a quick treat while on the road or at work.  I thought that the Mrs. Fields name would yield something pretty good for a product such as this. My expectations, unfortunately, were unmet.<br /><br />These cookie dough creations are awful.  Just awful.  When you open the package, there is a faint smell that is chemical peanut butter mixed with cheap chocolate.  Upon the first bite, you realize that the cookie dough is not soft but dry and really doesn't taste like peanut butter.  In a blind tasting, I would never call the flavor peanut butter.  The overall sensation is that this is chemical.  The aftertaste lingers in a very unpleasant way.<br /><br />I award two stars because it is convenient to plop one of these in a purse or lunch bag.  Additionally, if I were in a plane crash (knock on wood), I could eat these but a piece of a passenger seat might easily become more tempting.<br /><br />I purchased a 4.4 oz bag from Meijer for about 2.50.

review/summary: Sorry Silk!
review/text: I must admit I was a silk devotee as it was the best of all the brands I tried, and I tried just about all of them. Amazon was out of stock of it once and so was I so I tried Zen Soy; haven't been back since.

review/summary: great taste
review/text: first let me state that I do not enjoy drinking soymilk.  I buy this for my son for traveling and out and about.  that being said, when I tasted this brand, it was actually good!  it has a nice sweet vanilla-y flavor without the almost bitter taste that most soymilk has.

review/summary: Love the taste and convenience
review/text: I love the convenience of having shelf stable soy milk - no refrigeration needed.  I travel a lot and can just easily take it along.  The vanilla flavor is really great - goes well for soy lattes and with granola cereal.

review/summary: For Organic Vanilla Soy Milk try Silk instead
review/text: Has a rather awful aftertaste similar to the chocolate ZenSoy product.  No worries though, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V4Q8L0">Silk Soymilk, Organic Vanilla, 8.25-Ounce Carton (Pack of 18)</a> product is good and the same price. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKZ3GA">Horizon Organic Reduced Fat Milk, Chocolate, 8-Ounce Aseptic Cartons (Pack of 18)</a> is good too, and both are available for 15% discount and free 2-day shipping by subscription.

review/summary: One of my favorites
review/text: I love the strong aroma of smoked applewood. I put it on everything! It's the perfect coarseness, and I like the fact that it has such a strong smokey aroma. If you're going for smoked salts, check this one out.
