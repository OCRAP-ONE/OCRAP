review/summary: Love it!!
review/text: The Babycook is wonderful. I tried making my sons food with a basket steamer and food processer, but this works better. I was very pleased with the ease of use and the consistency of the finished product. The food gets steamed perfectly. So far I have made applesauce, butternut squash and carrots.<br />I was a little concerned because of a few negative reviews, but I am so glad I got this. Clean-up is easy too.

review/summary: THIS IS A REAL DANGER FOR YOUR BABY, DONT BUY IT!!!
review/text: I just open my baby cook, I read very quickly the instructions, because I was very exited to make my baby food, So everything was OK, I put some carrots and potatoes in dices. they cooked perfect, then I mixed them using the water that i got from the steam. the mixed was fine and creamy, so i started to give the food to my baby, she made a funny face for the 2 first spoons and then she eat everything, almost by the end of her food, I tried a bit of the foood, AND  OH MY GOD!!!!! the flavor was BITTER, so I was very concern and worry,  I started to look after this bitter flavor,.....I FOUND THAT THE STEAMER MADE A FUNNY SMELL, so I decided to stream only some water, after the cycle stop, I TASTED THE WATER AND FLAVOR WAS BITTER!!!!!!!!!! I TRIED ALMOST 5 TIMES, I PUT SOME VINEGAR AS THE INSTRUCTIONS SAID FOR CLEANING, BUY THE BITTER FLAVOR IS STILL THERE, SO ANY TIME THAT YOU WILL MAKE OUR FOOD, YOU WILL GET THIS FLAVOR; IS THAT HEALTY?,  PLEASE.....DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT, THERE ARE MANY OTHER WAYS TO MAKE HEALTY FOOD FOR YOUR BABY. I BELIVE THE STEAM RESERVOIR HAD A VERY BIG PROBLEM:::::::............BE SERIUS CARFUL

review/summary: buy a baby brezza instead, save money and time and health
review/text: from reading all the reviews about black gunk and mold i have decided to forgo this product and i have lucked up on the baby brezza. it's a wonderful machine and it cooks and steams without having to do 2 steps. simply put the food in chopped, press the steam and puree button 1, 2, 3, or 4 times depending on how long you want the food to steam, and it purees or chops the food for you. you can also use the steam only or puree only button. save steps, and money, this product is only $99 and has adorable useful tools to buy separately for under $8. the website for the product is great, with instructional videos as well.<br /> i'm really glad i found this before i spent the $$ on something that might disappoint me in the long run. i hope they offer the baby brezza on amazon soon. i hate that i can't support amazon's great service by buying from them.

review/summary: Metal in Food!!!!!!!!
review/text: I was really excited when I received this as a gift. My husband and I both have food allergies so I was planning on making our own baby food and the Beabe Babaycook seemed perfect!<br /><br />At first it was great. I loved being able to steam and then puree in one machine and I didn't mind the small portions because I am not a huge fan of leftovers. So the fact that we would get only 4 servings a time was no big deal.<br /><br />We have used the machine 5 times. 5. And we followed the care instructions to the letter.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when we discovered small metal shavings in the food! The only things we had cooked in the machine were Sweat Potatoes and Peas.... Nothing that should cause the blade to chip! The only thing used to get the food out was a rubber spatula. We discovered metal in the food when our microwave was arching while heating up a serving of sweet potatoes! (24 sec power level 5)<br /><br />DO NOT BUY! SERIOUSLY!<br /><br />This machine is a hazard!

review/summary: I like it but....
review/text: I use my babycook all the time!  Contrary to other reviews, I do NOT have a problem with mold (and I live in a very, very humid environment where EVERYTHING molds).  I just leave the steam lid off so it can dry out when I am finished with it, and make sure there is no standing water inside the reservoir.<br />I gave it 3 stars as there are a couple major design flaws.  The first one is there is no timer, or automatic shut-off.  You need to set a timer and be there when it goes off otherwise you'll oversteam those precious nutrients out of your Baby's food!<br />Second, you have to actually hold the blend button to blend, it doesn't have a swtich you can just switch and leave, you actually have to stand there and hold the switch when it blends.  It's not really that big of a deal, but more of a pain in the butt when you have to hold the darn switch on for 5 minutes to puree my 6 month old's food!  This problem won't be an issue when my Baby starts eating foods that have more chunks in it, but for now, it's a pain :(<br />I do however think it's adorable, I have the color Gypsy, it looks nice on the counter and doesn't take up a whole lot of room.<br />I would recommend it to a friend, but I'd also check out the competition model of steamers/blenders!

review/summary: Good only if you never tried simple alternatives - found it useless and returned
review/text: The idea of this combine looks nice, but it is not very practical, and for sure quite expensive for the work it does. I owned it and decided to return when I tried steaming the quantity of veggies that I need using a simple steamer. Then I used a wonderful stick blender that I bought for just $30 dollars (Cusinart) and it worked great.  Believe or not, it is less hassle this way.  Less cleaning and drying. I could freeze extra amounts and use it later. Beaba will allow to steam and blend only a small set amount, and if your butter squash will happen to be larger, you have to do 2-3 batches, and so on.  Plus the same time - 15 min, does not work well for all the veggies.  In summary, making baby food using a pot, or steamer and then stick blender does not seem to be any more work than using Beaba; blending fresh fruits with stick blender is much easier than with Beaba (you have less to clean).  Conclusion - Beaba is not worth spending money.

review/text: I LOVED this thing, I used it everyday and it was great for 3 months. Well the plastic cracked in the cooker. So now I have this thing that wont steam and  would leak everywhere and it was a mess! I contacted their customer service- who got back to me quickly and said they would send out a replacement bowl. It's a month and half later- NO REPLACEMENT PART! Also the plastic part around the blade grows mold and there is NO easy way or a way I've found to get it completely out!!!  I have to say..as much as I did love this I would NEVER spend that kind of money on a baby cooker again.

review/summary: There is another way.....
review/text: So my wife and I wanted to make baby food for our wee lass. We started out excited about the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LQCOIS">Beaba Babycook Baby Food Maker</a> and after reading the reviews and getting our hands on it we changed our mind. Simply put there are three BIG problems.<br />1. It is hard to keep clean especially the reservoir.<br />2. It has a limited lifespan since all it makes is baby food.<br />3. It is very expensive for what you get.<br />Since we were free of the Bebycook we now had some money to spend so I bought a beautiful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002KQ66VY">Mauviel M'Cook 5 Ply Stainless Steel 8 Inch Steamer Insert</a> to cook her food in. Then I bought a restaurant quality 1-quart "Mouli Food Mill" made by L. Tellier to puree her food in. Finally I use the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027UYT4O">Beaba Multiportion Freezer Tray - Green</a> freezer tray to store her food. Believe it or not the Beaba Babycook cost the same as a Mauviel steamer and a LT Mouli food mill combined, both of which are top of the line dishwasher-safe 18/10 stainless steel cooking masterpieces made in France. After your little one starts eating 'real' food the Beabe Babycook is just a hard to clean useless plastic paperweight made in China. But the steamer and the mouli are both essential kitchen tools that will last a lifetime of steaming broccoli and making home-made apple sauce. Yum...

review/text: My mom bought this for me over the holidays.  I was so excited to use it as I wanted to try making my own organic baby food at home.  Being a busy professional I never imagined it would be this easy.  I love the all in one concept.  The only thing I wasn't happy about was that it cost $150 but was made in China.  I would have preferred for it to be made in France as I'm sure it used to be a few years ago.  Another thing:  I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to secure the blade when I first opened it.  The instruction book wasn't very descriptive about it except for a small picture.  A phone call to the company finally resolved the issue.

It came up in conversation and my daughter said she had read reviews about the unit growing mold in the center. I then went to the product and read the 1 star reviews (which I should have done before purchasing)and became concerned. When I went into my orders to check to see the dates I had to return the item, I discovered that the EXPIRATION DATE FOR RETURNING THIS ITEM IS 2 DAYS AFTER IT WAS ORDERED!!! Seriously, it won't arrive until tomorrow and that's the date it had to be returned per the Amazon return web site. Most items give you 30 days, some only 10, but whoever heard of having only 2 days to return it?? There is something seriously wrong here......I will return it as soon as it arrives. Would have been out almost $150 if I hadn't looked at the date.

review/text: Sure, it does what it says it will do. But!!...<br />it's made of very cheap materials and it's over-priced. The plastic is so cheap that it warps after you use the machine a couple of times, and the lid will never again fit properly. So, be prepared to get splattered with baby food each time you puree. If it saves time by being an all-in-one machine, it kills more time by requiring a complete dismantling of the bowl (5 parts need to be separated from each other and washed separately EACH TIME YOU USE IT!). When I read other reviews about mold growing in the reservoir, that just did it for me. I packed it up and returned it. Worst purchase and waste of time ever.

review/text: I was so excited about this baby food maker, but the capacity is tiny.  It would take all day to steam the amount of food that I make all at once.  I have stopped using the steam option completely, I just steam food on my stovetop, I have more control over the done-ness that way, AND I don't have to worry about cleaning the reservoir.<br /><br />The cord comes out of the bottom, and there is a tiny groove for it to fit under the baby food maker, but it doesn't fit well.  You have to push the cord into that slot, other wise the appliance is unstable.<br /><br />The lid doesn't fit well, and it is always a chore getting it on tight.  I filled up the canister just a little over half way with chicken, noodles and broth, turned on the processor, and was splashed in the face with hot liquid.  If you fill the canister more than half full, you have a mess!

review/summary: Love it! And mold shouldn't be a problem...
review/text: Just received my Beaba today and made two purees for baby. It's convenient, easy to use -- makes making baby food a breeze. Before I was steaming in the microwave, which kills some of the nutrients, not to mention that the plastic I was using may or may not have BPA. With the Beaba I don't need to worry about this anymore! I just take whatever we're cooking for ourselves, pop it into the Beaba and by the time our dinner is ready, so is baby's!<br /><br />I was a little hesitant to purchase this because I read some of the reviews about mold -- and it's difficult to know what the reviewers are referring to exactly without having the product in front of you.<br /><br />Now that I've used the Beaba, I'm wondering if the people who complained of mold were following the directions. I can see how mold could form in the water reservoir if you don't empty it after use. Obviously, mold can form any where there is water pooling for extended periods.<br /><br />However, the instructions clearly state to empty any water from the reservoir after each use, which I did immediately after using. I also left the top off just to ensure that any additional drops left inside would dry up. If you take this precaution, I don't see any way possible for mold to have the opportunity to form.<br /><br />When the instruction booklet talks about descaling the reservoir using vinegar, it's to ensure there is no lime build up-- not mold.<br /><br />After having used the Beaba, I don't think anyone interested in purchasing this should be turned off by claims of mold. If you take care of the machine properly, it won't be a problem.

review/summary: Great Concept... Weak Processor
review/text: I typically am not a big proponent of single-purpose specialty gadgets, but the Babycook was appealing to me for convenience. The product does deliver in that it significantly reduces dishes/clean up - however the processing function is surprisingly weak. To puree steamed chunks of carrots takes far longer to pulse than what the manual implies. I have to pulse & scrape down multiple times before foods are completely pureed - something I would definitely not have to do with a food processor or even a blender. I was very surprised not to have seen this shortcoming mentioned in reviews as of yet, but perhaps my expectations are a bit higher because I do cook on a very frequent basis. Although I love the idea of having an easy machine to whip up fresh baby food, I'll likely return it and use a steamer + food processor for better results.

review/summary: Great Product, Despite Negative Reviews
review/text: I received the Beaba Babycook as a shower gift and have been using it for two months now. Cooks run in my family (we have chefs two generations back) and I know my way very well around a kitchen. I have the requisite steamer, blender, food processor, etc., but was so relieved (once I trudged through the Babycook's awful directions) at how easy it is to make baby food. I have all sorts of combinations in my freezer: peas, peas/sweet potato (and I can fit two chopped sweet potatoes in the reservoir, not half of one as one reviewer mentioned), butternut squash/corn, blueberries/apples, blueberries/bananas, apples/butternut squash. And yes: I cooked, pureed, defrosted, and steamed all of these foods without a problem. My baby boy is 8 months and there hasn't been one item I've cooked in this machine that he doesn't love. He rejected several of the organic processed baby foods before I started using this, and I'm so happy that he likes the fresh food the best. I always taste-test my food before I serve, and I hated the processed, pre-packaged baby foods you buy at the supermarket. I love everything this machine produces. And I LOVE the butternut squash/corn combination so much that I now serve it as a side dish for my "adult meals."<br /><br />The prep is insanely easy: 10 seconds - 2 minutes total. The measuring of water. The switch of a button. BOOM.<br /><br />I read all the reviews tonight that talk about this product "growing mold", and I looked into my reservoir and did notice some brown buildup. But I know what causes mold: it needs a warm, dark place to fester. So I ran the distilled vinegar per the instructions (which is to prevent lime buildup, not mold) and will now always make sure to take off the reservoir lid so that it can air dry. Think about it: we do that with our washing machines to prevent mold, so it stands to reason that you'd have to do this with this product as well.<br /><br />Hope that helps! I'm a mom that works from home, I prepare three "adult" meals a day, and also make homemade baby food. This machine keeps me SANE and PROUD. I love that I can provide my child delicious, homemade meals!

review/summary: Use a Hand-mixer - Cheaper and More Effective
review/text: This was given to me as a gift, and I was truly excited about the product.  My husband and I were adamant about our plans to prepare our baby's food ourselves.  However, after a couple of uses it became apparent that the Beaba Babycook product was neither easy nor quick to use.<br /><br />The steamer worked ok, but frankly I find just using a nice silicone steamer tray ($3.99 at your local grocery store) and my own pot worked just fine.  Plus, since I freeze a couple weeks supply at a time, using "adult-sized" steamer / cookware meant I could make one large-ish batch rather than 2 or 3 too-small batches.<br /><br />The blender component was totally inadequate.  Either the speed was too slow or the blades too dull, but it took a LONG time for the food to be blended enough for our infant.  If you are looking for a chunkier texture for an older child, perhaps this would be ok.  And the dial was awckward to hold continuously during the blending process.<br /><br />My suggestion:<br />1.  Use your own pots & pans w/a steamer to cook the veggies, fruit, meats, etc.<br />2.  Use a hand-held blender (like Braun's Multiquick) to really puree the foods.  BONUS:  You can actually use a<br />  handheld blender for other things non-baby related.

review/summary: Superb operation
review/text: I received this as a gift at Christmas and have been enjoying using it.  Its very convenient and keeps all the cleanup contained in one bowl.<br /><br />Best feature - the food processor is _very_ powerful and I don't need to strain foods b/c there are no chunks (I do strain peas to remove shells after processing).<br /><br />The steamer is quick and efficient.  With the steamer basket full, I make about one-week worth of single-ingredient food at a time.  I peel foods and cut into chunks before I steam them.  Holds about 2 small sweet potatoes or two pears or one bag of frozen peas.<br /><br />I store foods frozen in silicone mini-muffin pans (much easier to remove than from an ice-cube tray).<br /><br />This device can be used to defrost food - just pop the frozen food in a small heat-proof bowl first.  But, unless you keep a close eye and check a few times, the food gets way too hot.  Easier to use the microwave for 30 seconds, then stir well to make sure there are no hot or cold spots.<br /><br />I will definitely use this when our baby starts to eat our food and it needs to be blenderized first.  The blade and motor on the food processor are fabulous and better than others we have.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The price is way too expensive.  I received it as a gift, but would not have bought it for myself.<br />- The spatula is useless, a small silicone spatula is much better.

review/summary: not worth the money
review/text: This is a nice idea, but you can only fit half a sweet potato in it at a time. You should instead buy yourself an immersion blender, which is super easy to clean and useful for other things too. Steaming your food in a regular pot with a steamer basket is much faster and easier, and you don't need to be plugged in to do it. The Babycook is so cute and the idea is so nice, I just had to buy it.<br /><br />I have some issues with the design as well as the function - the lid is awkward to close, a little lip on the lid has to slide into a little crevice on the body before you can use it. Very annoying to use, and you cannot get the thing off when you are done unless you use two hands. The food chopping function only happens when you have the switch turned, so its never hands free except when you are steaming, which takes longer than steaming on my gas stove. The cord is also too short, which is never good in the kitchen.<br /><br />I did a test last night, half of the sweet potato in the babycook and half on the stove (chopped). Stove won, it was done first. But wait, the babycook will puree too right, so that was handy.  But in order to puree a potato you need additional water, and that means a two handed removal of the lid and then the same thing to get it back on again. If there are chunks, its off again with the lid - very annoying.  You can't fit much in the babycook to puree even after taking out the steaming basket. You are still limited to one half of a sweet potato, so I had to puree in batches.<br /><br />An immersion blender is nice because you can move it around to get all the chunks, you can tilt the container etc.. I got this as a gift, I asked for it actually. But now I would love to return it.<br /><br />Save your money and invest in an immersion blender for when you are making larger batches and a hand held food mill that doesn't need to be plugged in when baby eats what the family is eating but in a softer form.<br /><br />Definitely not recommended.

review/summary: LOVE this gadget!
review/text: I received the Babycook as a gift and I absolutely love it!  Here's how it works:  Pour some water into the reservoir tank.  Load food into the steamer basket which sits right in the grinder "bowl".  It steams the food perfectly, then you dump the food from the steamer basket into the grinder portion, grind and VIOLA! you have baby food.  I agree with other reviewers that you can grab your steamer and your blender and probably get similar results. . .but now you've got a counter full of kitchen appliances, you have to perfect your steaming capabilities. . .what a pain!!!  This little guy stores easily in a cupboard, you bring him out and he cooks and grinds the food.  Clean up is a breeze.  So worth the investment! (oh, yah. . I forgot, mine was a gift. . but I would buy one in a heartbeat!!!!).  Seriously, it makes "making baby food" a breeze.  I think it would be a chore to bring out the steamer, bring out the blender or food processor, use them, wash them, put them away. I'm LAZY and this little guy makes my baby food making adventures so simple!  Buy it. . .stop thinking about it.

review/summary: Totally unnecessary but love it anyways!
review/text: This is one of the most unnecessary and ridiculously over-priced baby items I own, yet I can't help loving it. Common sense tells me that I could just as easily cook food on the stove and puree it in a blender, in even greater quantities than are allowed by the Beaba Babycook, but this is such an adorable little appliance, with such a straightforward cooking process, that it totally motivates me to use it and hence we have a freezer full of baby food cubes. It is definitely NOT useful, however, for reheating food - I followed the directions for defrosting/reheating, and it came out scalding hot. The other minus is that it comes with very few recipes, even on the website that initially looks impressive but is actually quite sparse. Bottom line - if you're a sucker for attractive kitchen gadgets and have a rich uncle who wants to buy you an extravagant shower gift, this is the perfect item! Otherwise, buy a blender - at least you can make frozen margaritas with it as well.<br /><br />Update: 3 months after I purchased the Beaba, I still use it CONSTANTLY. Occasionally, I bake or steam food using the oven/stove and blend it in a blender, but I have to say that the Beaba is much more convenient. And I would now up my rating to 5 stars - I recently got distracted while steaming some beets on the stove (imagine that, getting distracted with a 9 month old son) and burned out the bottom of the pot. The Beaba is now the only thing I use for steaming because it automatically turns off when it's done cooking, and I can't stress enough the peace of mind I get from this safety feature, as any mommy with baby brain can understand! If you can afford it - buy it.

review/summary: Perfect size, easy to use
review/text: I love this little device - it doesn't take up too much space in the cabinet and is so easy to use and clean up after. I read the other reviews so I knew to start making food before my little one was ready for solids. This turned out to be perfect - whenever I see fruits and veggies on sale (over ripe organic bananas .35 / lb) or we have more than we need in the fridge I just turn it in to baby food. One batch in the Beaba fills an ice cube tray, which keeps me from making too much of any one thing. That way in the future if I want to serve chicken & rice with apples, I just thaw a cube of each and mix. If I had to steam everything in one set of pans, then get the big blender dirty I would give up on making my own baby food in a hurry! I love knowing exactly what is in my baby's food and being able to offer a much larger variety than what you can get in the jars - bell peppers, asparagus, mango, etc.<br /><br />Skip the specialty storage containers - ice cube trays are perfect. Cover with plastic wrap, freeze, dump in to a Ziploc bag. Also skip the cookbooks - no need to create fancy mixes ahead of time and you'll start feeling like you are spending longer on baby food than dinner. I was disappointed that the Beaba did not come with basic instructions for categories of fruits, veggies, meats (just a few sample combo recipes), but I found this great website that has all the basics, fancier recipes, nutritional info - without paying anything or giving them your email address: [...].<br /><br />Haven't encountered any of the "brown film" issues - being careful to take the lid off the steam compartment immediately and leave it off when it is put away.

review/summary: good but not great
review/text: I have been cooking with the Babycook for 6 weeks now, it works fine but not great.<br />CONS:<br />- You can only make small amounts at the time.<br />- The blender is weak.<br />- The steamer-basket can only be filled half for most vegetables for proper steaming-result.<br />PROS:<br />- Heats, steams, blends all in one handy tool.<br />- Easy to use.<br />- Takes up little space.<br />- Can easily be taken on a trip.<br /><br />On some of the issues people wrote.<br />"MOLD": Water is never completely pure so there will be buildup in the water compartment. SOLUTION: Always open the lid as soon as the cycle is done and store without the lid on. Once buildup occurs, which will happen eventually, put 2-3 teaspoons of baking powder into the water compartment, fill up with water, and let stand for a few minutes. Poor out. Put an other 2-3 teaspoons of baking powder into the water compartment, fill up with water, and let stand over night. In the morning rinse out well until the water is clear.<br />If you have hard water you will have lime buildup. Poor some vinegar into the compartment, shake around and let stand for a few minutes, repeat until clean, then rinse well with hot water.<br />"Steamer-light going on and off": When you steam the water will evaporate, when the compartment is empty the light will go off indicating that the steam-cycle is done. If you leave the lid on the water compartment on, condense water will gather on the bottom starting a new cycle, the light will go on again, this water will evaporate, the light goes off, and so on and on. SOLUTION: Open the lid on the water compartment as soon as the light goes of the first time. This will also help to dry up the compartment better, creating less buildup.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />It is a nice tool to have if you cook fresh on a daily basis or have limited counter space. It is easy to use and does a good job on small amounts.<br />If you have a large kitchen or prefer to cook in larger batches and then freeze, buy separate machines (steamer, blender), the babycook can't handle larger amounts.<br /><br />I can recommend for people who have a small kitchen, for people who are planning a trip with baby.<br />I can't recommend for people who cook larger amounts or for more than one baby.

review/summary: Love It!  Plus A Little "Science"
review/text: I will not repeat the many positive reviews of this appliance.  I love it for the same reasons everybody else who loves it does:  one small appliance, no pots and pans, a few pieces into the dishwasher, no timing, no recipes, easy peasy.  I actually like that it makes a small amount of food.  If something is rejected, I don't have a gallon ziplock of useless food cubes taking up room in the freezer.  I'd rather have variety than bulk.  Plus, it's super easy to incorporate leftover meat or fish or rice with your fresh veggies and reheat/cook and puree together.<br /><br />I wanted to share, though, a little bit of research I did to make it even easier to use.  I like to make a couple of batches in a row so I can do combinations or single-veg purees with the same small group of ingredients.  What do you do when your already-peeled potatoes don't all fit?  Mix them with some zucchini or cauliflower and do a second mixed batch!  There are two logistical problems with this:  there is no information on the steamer basket's capacity so you can't chop the second or third batch in advance, and the "measures" of water are also not defined.  Since the mixing bowl is also the water measuring bowl, you would have to wash it out really carefully between uses to avoid getting food particles in the reservoir.  Other than protecting the cleanliness of the reservoir, it does not seem necessary to do more than a quick rinse if you're doing two vegetables in a row.  So I did a little "science" and found:  "one measure" of water is about 1/4 cup, 2 measures 1/2 cup, 3 measures 3/4 cup.  Also, the description says that the bowl has a 2.5 cup capacity.  Not so.  It is the *steamer basket* that has a 2.5 cup capacity.

review/summary: DOES NOT GROW MOLD AT ALL IF USED PROPERLY!
review/text: This machine does not grow mold at all if you just use some common sense and follow the included care directions.  Immediately after use, you just un-cap the reservoir and pour out any remaining water.  I have never been able to pour any water out because the reservoir dries instantaneously upon opening it after using the machine. I still let the reservoir air out for a few hours after use just in case.<br /><br />If you leave the cap on and never allow the reservoir to dry, of course it will grow mold.  What enclosed damp environment wouldn't?<br /><br />Besides all of the above,  I love the machine, but wish the capacity were greater....at least that it would produce enough food to fill one Beaba freezer tray. I use the Beaba once a week to produce a weekly supply of food for my daughter, and due to the small capacity, I spend more time than necessary in the kitchen, but overall, I love the one-unit convenience of this product.

review/summary: Worth every cent!!!
review/text: I first used this product in 2005 when I lived in London and I used it until I moved to the US at the end of 2007 when my son was almost 3.  I found it to be absolutely invaluable.  My son never ate a jar of baby food - not once, because of this handy gadget.  All of his food for the first year was made in this and he was still eating food prepared in it when we left the UK.<br /><br />The pros for us was that it eliminated the need for 2 separate (and usually bulky) appliances (very handy in our Central London apartment) and it allowed us to prepare food for our son when we travelled which we did extensively.  This item travelled (and cooked) in Morocco, Amsterdam, New York, Washington DC, the Caribbean, the Alps and many other places.  Wherever there was an electricity socket we could use it.<br /><br />The best thing about it though is that this appliance is BPA and PVC (phthalate) free.  I know that many American parents are not as across this issue of toxic chemicals as the Europeans and the Canadians but it is a hugely important topic for young children.  Heating food in plastic is something you have to be very careful about, especially if you are feeding young children.  I'm simplifying this but in a nutshell BPA and phthalates have the ability to mimic the female hormone estrogen and interfere with the production of the male hormone (testosterone) amongst other things.  These chemicals are implicated in diseases such as breast cancer, testicular cancer, lowered sperm counts and defective sperm and diabetes.  Studies have shown that plastics, when heated, can leach (pass on) these chemicals.  Food and fluid heated in plastic containers or devices that contain these chemicals, will contain these chemicals in them also.  Chemicals that you (or your child) then eat.<br /><br />If your family eats lots of steamed vegetables etc then you will probably have a steamer that you are already using and I agree if you are steaming for a family then this is simply too small, but it worked perfectly for us and I would often steam food for us (spinach, baby carrots etc) from time to time.<br /><br />I never had a problem with mold or brown fluid!! (Also I am not sure you can blame an appliance for mold!)<br /><br />In a nutshell if you can afford it and want to make your own baby food, I cannot recommend this more highly.  I am pregnant again and am so happy that this is now available in the US.  I cannot wait to use it again.

review/summary: A good concept, but some pretty major design flaws
review/text: This is a good product. My husband and I both work full-time, but we also love cooking, and want our baby to experience and enjoy good food just like we do.  The Beaba Babycook is a simple, pretty much idiot-proof way to steam and prepare a meal for baby while I am preparing food for adults.  Chop the food, place in basket, water in and turn the switch....10-15mins later light goes off and I can puree and serve fresh.  Pretty much no washing - all of the items quickly rinse clean and can be put away, and the device looks nice and takes up limited counter space.<br /><br />However, there are a few downsides, some of which have been noted in previous reviews, but I think all of these have pretty straightforward solutions, bar one.  For me the only real problem with this machine is that although the active cooking stops when the light switches off, the element does not appear to turn off automatically, so if you are like me and occasionally forget that you have put food on to steam (eg last thing at night or before I leave for work in the morning), you find when you return that the heating element has remained on for hours, and the side of the device where the water goes is very hot.  This does not seem to affect the product (it may in the long term), but it seems like a major design flaw that the thermostat does not turn the element off when the light goes off.  The manufacturer clearly knows this, as the instruction manual tells you to turn it off when finished, but given we all have a lot on our minds, this does not seem altogether satisfactory.  I have just had to try not to forget....and hope the unit won't overheat and burn the house down!<br /><br />On a less serious note, depending on where you live (ie if you have hard water and likelihood of deposits from the water), there is a tendency for the water in the steamer to go brownish or develop deposits.  The product insert addresses this and recommends that you run the steamer through with white vinegar intermittently.  This completely resolves the problem...personally I don't really want to steam with distilled water, as I think it tastes bizarre, but that is another option.<br /><br />Finally, I agree with other reviewers that the unit is quite small, and won't do more than about 2 days worth of food at once, but if you're like me and don't have a whole lot of freezer space, and are happy to prepare and serve on a more regular basis, this works just fine.  In any case, even though the capacity is quite small, it is so easy to use that I don't find it a hassle doing multiple runs sequentially.  The puree blade is also pretty vigorous, so you don't have a lot of control over the puree - it's either very smooth or not at all.  This means that the device won't be a permanent fixture on my kitchen bench, but it is great for the first few months of solids, and has definitely paid for itself over jarred baby food.<br /><br />OK - Update one month after purchase and I have another, pretty big downside.  If you read the one star reviews of this product, you will see a large number of people commenting on the dark brown mold that builds up in the water reservoir despite following manufacturer's instructions on cleaning.  This is certainly true,and it is worse if the lid is left on the unit after cooking, as the mold clearly loves the hot, moist environment.  Unfortunately, the design flaw mentioned above, which means that the heating doesn't switch off when the cooking is finished, makes this even more likely to occur.  There are two ways to address this, and note that the vinegar recommended does nothing. First, make sure you switch off after cooking and remove the lid from the water reservoir so it can dry properly in between uses.  Secondly, I use a soft bottle brush with warm water to scrub out the inside, and then use paper towels pushed into the reservoir to dry out the brown water that results.  It is definitely less than ideal to have to do this, but it doesn't take long, and at least means my baby is eating food without mold spores!  I still like the convenience of the product, and the food is good, but I wouldn't buy it again.

review/summary: Works Wonders
review/text: I've read all of the reviews on Amazon and have to agree with the majority of posters - it's an amazing appliance.  It saves me time and allows me to know with certainty what Baby is eating.  Because of it's versatility, you can really experiment with a variety of recipes with the simplicity of just adding cubed veggies and fruit.  My only suggested food to refrain - cooking beginner meats such as chicken or beef.  I cooked chicken and unfortunately minces the meat as opposes to a true puree.  (Note: this could entirely just be a function of adding more water during the blend which I have yet to experiment with)<br /><br />The trick to the Babycook is to read the manual and employ some common sense.  Here are some suggestions to the common complaints:<br /><br />1) Mold in the reservoir - common sense suggestion:  Let your unit air dry by removing the reservoir lid after each use prior to storing it away.  We wouldn't put blenders, food processors or most appliances away wet, treat the babycook the same way.  In addition, make sure only water is placed in the reservoir (i.e. without any trace foods which could occur when making multiple batches)<br /><br />2) Mold on the blade - as shown in the instruction booklet: remove the gasket and cleaning is simple as using a sponge or a brush.  It's really hard to get into the grooves without removing the rubber seal.  Reattaching it is super easy as well.<br /><br />3) Brown murky water - usually because of the after effects of descaling.  Vinegar browns when scalded so it is likely that this is the cause.  To remedy, as per the instructions, run a couple cycles to rinse out your unit. Common sense tip: regular descaling doesn't mean a couple months in between.  It means every week if you use your babycook daily.

I worked as a professional nanny for years before having my own baby and I made a lot of baby food during that time (lucky kids :)  This machine makes home made baby food a cinch!<br /><br />Here is what I love:<br /><br />Smaller batches - unless you are living your own version of "baby boom" you just don't need to make gallons of apple sauce<br /><br />Fast!  I can have baby food in about 10 minutes, so if I run out, it just takes a few minutes to make something fresh<br /><br />Great puree - really smooth and creamy, or as chunky as you wish<br /><br />it's small - not a space hog in my cramped kitchen<br /><br />Looks cute - so I don't having it out all the time<br /><br />If you are leaning towards getting the device, or registering one for your baby shower - DO IT!  you will love it, promise.

review/summary: great device but cleanup can be tedious
review/text: i bought this device over the brezza because the brezza, while able to steam and blend for you, seemed to have a lot of quality control issues.  i didn't want to order the brezza and and have to return it because i got a lemon.  the beaba is very sturdy and the materials feel durable.  it is really easy to make the baby food.  i had to spend about 30 minutes reading the instructions and playing around with the clicking lid and bowl just to get comfortable with it.<br /><br />mold<br />- the reviews made me concerned about mold but i think people hadn't let it dry out properly.  the reservoir is certainly made of ceramic.  after washing it out with water 3 times, i'd flip the beaba upside down to get rid of excess water - not even a drop fell out.  so just make sure you keep the lid off to dry.<br /><br />switch<br />- the blending button has to be manually held down. it's very much like the pulse option on the food processor.  it stops blending as soon as you let go.  the steam option doesn't turn off on its own.  the light simply turns off but you need to turn it off so the heating element turns off.  this can be a pain, like some people commented, but steaming on the stove requires the same oversight and turning off the stove, so it doesn't really bother me. the manual tells you the time.  when you measure the water to 1 - it's 5 minutes; 2 - 10 minutes; and 3 - 15 minutes.  you can set your own timer.<br /><br />blending<br />- i diced up about two slices of potatoes and it was not enough food to blend properly so even though the bowl is small, it makes more than enough a few days.  i don't like to freeze or make food in batches because i think fresh is best and the baby always eats what we're eating anyway. i actually love that it's small and i can only cook a little at a time, unlike some of the reviewers.<br /><br />cleanup<br />- i find this a bit tedious because you have to wash the bowl, the lid, the mixing lid (so food doesnt get in the steaming hole), the basket, the blade, the gasket (every so often), and the spatula.  but every part is necessary and i don't know that it's much different from using a pot/steamer/food processor method. i just like that everything is in one device.  i'll be using this for the next year and a half, and after that, to make applesauce and other fruit/vegetable purees that i can sneak into our food.<br /><br />i really love it and recommend it to people who want to make baby food with one device instead of 3.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />after using it several times, it just isn't convenient enough to be worth 120 dollars.  i kept forgetting to use the mixing lid (so food doesn't get in the handle or steamer) and the motor is not very strong - it sounded like it was going to break down.  i'm just going to use a steamer and a japanese version of the magic bullet, which has a much more powerful motor.  also, having to keep checking on it was beginning to be a pain.  at least with steaming on the stove, you can hear the lid rattling on the pot :)  also, steaming and blending in plastic - no matter how pvc/bpa/pthalate free - made me feel nervous.

review/summary: It's just okay. Consider your needs before buying!
review/text: I received this as a very generous, surprise shower gift, for which I am grateful. As a first-time, clueless mom, being armed with this gadget made me confident to venture into making my own baby food, which I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The first few times I used this, I was thrilled. However, I soon realized that, although convenient in theory, this just wasn't a practical way for me to cook my son's food.<br /><br />Here's the kind of cook I am: I like making food, but I love when I can cook in the most efficient ways possible. When making baby food, this means I am totally willing to do the work, but would rather do it once or twice a week and make big batches to last the week or freeze for later. If that sounds like you, you should save your money--this is not the most efficient machine for that.<br /><br />I imagined myself whipping up quick, ready-to-serve dinners for my son in 20 minutes flat. Again, just not practical in reality. Even if you have the food prepped ahead of time, once you steam and puree it (which is not exactly what I'd call quick), it is HOT. OK, yes, I understand the food has been steamed and is therefore going to be extremely hot, but anyone with a hungry baby knows you don't really have a ton of extra time to wait for piping hot sweet potatoes to cool down before dinner is served. I've also found that the blending mechanism is just okay--not terribly powerful, not a big capacity, and I often have to stop mid-blend and scrape down the sides. It's kind of a pain to clean too. Plus, the "pitcher" component and lid of mine have definitely become slightly warped from the extreme heat of steaming.<br /><br />I thought this would be THE all-in-one machine for making baby food. However, considering my reality, it's just so-so. I have a Vitamix blender and much prefer that. It doesn't steam, but to me, doing a big batch or two of baby food in at most three steps (prep if needed, steam if needed, blend) is preferable over cooking five small, individual batches of sweet potatoes in a row, each of which takes 20 minutes in the Beaba Babycook.<br /><br />If I had spent my own money on it, I'd be more disappointed. It's not terrible--just not the best or most practical solution for me.

review/summary: AWFUL! Try the Baby Brezza instead
review/text: This thing is terrible. It takes forever to steam anything. Diced carrots took well over an hour. I thought the unit must be defective so i exchanged it for a new one. Same problem. It's just not a very powerful machine. The blend function is underpowered too. You have to keep pausing the blend to scrape down the bowl and move the contents around. What a hassle.It doesn't make the process of making food for baby any easier. After steaming you are expected to lift out the hot basket with dripping ,steaming veggie water, drain it over the sink, bring it back to the bowl and scrape it back in and then stand there while it (doesn't quite) blend. Making any food for my baby took forever and made such a mess that it just wasn't worth it. Cleaning it was also a real pain. After trying several other baby food makers I finally found the Baby Brezza. It's cheaper and it's awesome. One bowl. No parts. One button to steam then blend. I can push it and walk away . Lo and behold. It actually steams then blends! Fabulous. Skip the Beaba. It's all hype

review/summary: Very small capacity, takes too long to use, hard to clean.
review/text: I won the Beaba from a blog giveaway, but I don't think I would ever spend the money to buy one.  I only used mine about a dozen times before passing it on to a friend.<br /><br />It did everything it was advertised to do.  I don't think it saves on time and effort, though.  You still have to clean, peel, and cut your fruits or veggies into chunks, so no time saved there.  If anything it takes MORE time to prepare baby food with the Beaba simply because it has such a small capacity.  You can put about a cup to a cup and a half of chopped raw food in the steamer, which seems like a good amount of food.  However, by the time you steam and puree your food, you end up with only about half a cup of baby food, maybe a bit more.<br /><br />Let's say you're going to make some sweet potatoes.  Always a great food to start babies on because it's mild and sweet and can be pureed really smooth and creamy.  The Beaba can only cook about half of an average sweet potato at a time.  I can cook four LARGE sweet potatoes and puree them in my 7-cup food processor all at once.  With the Beaba, start to finish, from peeling to chopping to steaming to blending to cooling, you're looking at around 30 to 45 minutes before you can feed your baby.  Also, food coming out of the Beaba is EXTREMELY hot, rightly so, but you can't feed a baby food that hot so you have to let it cool, which just adds to your food prep time.<br /><br />Anyone who is serious about making most or all of their own baby food is going to want to make baby food in BULK.  Most busy moms don't have time to waste on a product like the Beaba that makes such a small amount of food at a time.  Just one hour  in the kitchen on Sunday and I had enough baby food to last all week, if not longer.  I have a KitchenAid 7-cup food processor which I found on sale at BB&B for around sixty bucks.  I would steam my veggies and fruits on the stove or even in the microwave, then puree them quickly in the food processor, usually making about 4 cups of baby food at a time.<br /><br />Also, one pot, one steamer basket, and one food processor was MUCH easier to clean than the Beaba.  The Beaba streamer basket was stained orange the first time I used it and I didn't care for all the little parts and pieces I needed to clean on the Beaba.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on fancy or expensive baby food storage containers.  Gladware makes small 4-ounce containers.  I believe a pack of 8 is under 3 bucks.  I would fill about a dozen of these at a time with 3 or 4 different foods and pop them in the freezer.  Each night before I went to bed, I would pull a couple of containers out of the freezer and stick them in the fridge for the next day.  Come mealtime, it was fast and easy to scoop out what I needed and warm it up in the microwave.<br /><br />After several months of freezing and heating the little blue lids of the Gladware containers would crack, but they're so affordable that I didn't mind tossing some in the recycling bin and buying another set.

review/summary: I love the babyook! Pricey, but it was a gift
review/text: I love it! It's compact, sleek, simple ... and I use it every day! I would like to confess that I did not initially intend to puree my baby's food daily, although in theory I would have loved to. I just knew I probably wouldn't end up doing it (we have 3 kids and I just know myself pretty well.....). THEN, we received this wonderful gift! A good family friend bought it in Europe and sent it over. At first I thought oh boy this looks like too much trouble. I have a blender, and I steam veggies often for the family, so it seemed just as easy to merely pop pre-steamed veggies in the blender (again, in theory). So the Babycook sat for a few weeks. I really am a little lazy and also SO crazy busy, (I know, an odd combo). I opened it up when she was about 5 months and I've been using it EVERY DAY, sometimes 3 times a day. She is mainly breastfed, but I'll pop in whatever we are eating, in tiny amounts sometimes, and give her little tastes here and there. I LOVE IT! Conversely, you can fill it with anything...carrots, peas, potatoes, zucchini, blueberries...etc., and it's enough to last for DAYS! Usually I feed her what I make and only occasionally refrigerate/freeze for day or more. It's just so easy to use and clean that I don't need to make large quantities. Lastly, what I do the most often is just add veggies that have already been steamed for the rest of us, and it purees within seconds. Often, I'll steam for just a few minutes and it creates a perfect consistency. You'd think a steamer and a blender would be exactly the same but it's not, at least for me.  Hint: Rinsing it off immediately creates so much less work than if you let it sit (just like everything else) but I notice that if I rinse it off right away I am much for likely to use again and again. There are only the 2 parts, plus the lids. It's great. I wouldn't have spent that much I have to say, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. I recommend it to anyone. I've been using it often 1-3 times a day for over 2 months and we have very hard water here, and so far no problems. After reading some reviews I think I may switch to filtered, maybe even distilled, water but the product looks the same as the day I opened it, so..., so far so good!!

review/summary: Great product : easy to use + makes delicious purees in no time !
review/text: This is a GREAT product : not only does it make delicious purees, all vitamins preserved and so smooth thanks to the blender, but it also is soooo easy to use, not to mention to clean ! In only 10 to 15 minutes (depending on the ingredients) I can make amazingly tasty vegetables for my six months old, and just the right quantity so it is always extra fresh. You can also make more and freeze it in ice trays, I have to admit sometimes it is convenient. It is so worth the money !!!

review/summary: So very close, but not quite there
review/text: Overall, this is an ingenious device, allowing you to cook then puree your baby's food all with a single, reasonably compact device.  As far as it goes, it works well, but there are a couple of issues, as follows:<br /><br />1. There is no audible indicator when a cooking cycle is done.  There is a light that goes out, but that's it, so if you're not in there watching it or checking it you'll never know when it's done.<br /><br />2. Building on #1, if you leave the machine with the switch in the cooking position and fail to turn it off, after some time (30 minutes, an hour, we're not sure), it will spontaneously start the cooking cycle all over again.  We've forgotten about it overnight and woken up to a warm device filled with greatly overcooked food.<br /><br />3. There is no timer to allow you to judge when the cooking cycle might finish, so it's all guesswork until you start to get an instinct for it.  This compounds issues #1 and #2.<br /><br />4. There is no way to store all the pieces together when not in use.  There is a cooking basket that fits inside the cooking cup, and when it's in there then you can't also put the blending lid in the stack, because it's one or the other.  Also, there is no place to store the spoon/stick that is used to retrieve the hot basket out of the cooking cup.  So, when it's all clean you have at least two random pieces floating around that have to be tracked and stored separately.  A couple of little clips or indentations or something to hold these pieces would make it a lot more convenient.<br /><br />We really wish that they would update the device to address the above issues.  We use it on an almost daily basis, and it does a great job at cooking and pureeing the food (as long as you watch it like a hawk and have nearby storage for the loose pieces), but it could use some polish to make it a really efficient device.

review/summary: Works well, but an unnecessary addition to your kitchen (and expensive!)
review/text: When our son started on solids, we were determined to make all our own food, and purchased the Beaba Baby Cook right away. As a product, we were generally happy with it - it's an "all-in-one" device - you can steam, blend, and reheat homemade food. As a result, when we traveled out of town for 2 weeks, we took it with us (in the travel bag, which we purchased separately, for another $40). We used it in our hotel room with local ingredients, and it was great. Our three complaints about it functionally are minor - it seems to take quite a while to steam the food, you have to hold the blender button in the 'on' position continually, and the blender itself is quite loud. Our baby's room is next to the kitchen, and I would constantly worry about waking him up if I was using this while he was sleeping. It also only makes very small batches of food because of its small size, so I wound up with about 1 cup of blended food after 30+ min of prep and cook time.<br /><br />The biggest issue with this machine is that it's not worth the expense for the money ($150 + $40 for the travel case = $190!!!) - it was a MUCH BETTER VALUE to use our full-size Cuisinart, which we already owned. If we had not, it would have been smarter to purchases a mini-Cuisinart for about $40. Here's why: we made ALL the baby food our son ate, at least at first. It was much, much faster and more efficient to steam the food on the stove, using a couple inexpensive steamer baskets and pots (much faster), and then to puree them (much more quietly)in the Cuisinart. We could make much larger batches of food, which we then froze in ice cube trays (cheaper and again, more efficient, than the freezing trays Beaba sells). The Baby Cook made such small batches it hardly seemed worth the effort. For busy parents out there (and you know you're one of them) - this was, by far, not the most efficient method for making baby food, and costly to boot.<br /><br />TL;DR: The Baby Cook works well, but a Cuisinart/Kitchen Aid is cheaper, more efficient, and will get the job done just as well/better. Don't spend the extra money on the Baby Cook.

review/summary: Good everyday appliance with one major flaw.
review/text: I am a new mom and was first looking for a petite blender.  I got this baby cooker because I thought I would save me a lot of time cooking and blending the baby food.  Our kitchen is tiny so the size of the baby cooker was important and the Beaba Baby cook is nice and small.  The product is great when my baby was around 4 to 7 months, but her nutritional needs greatly increased by nine months.  Before, I use it twice a week and it supplied plenty of baby food for that week.  All you had to do is freeze it and defrost for meals.  Now, I have to use it everyday, which is okay if I had the time.  However coming home from work, sometimes, I just want to prepare  frozen foods quickly.  So now,  I am using the traditional method of cooking her vegetables and meats in a big pot and blending it in a bigger blender as well.  I still like the Beaba babycook, but its size limits its convenience factor.<br />Also, after four months, the bowl to cook/blend has a crack and I am in the process of replacing it.  Customer service was great; SC admitted that the bowl was defective and is giving me a replacement.  I give this product four stars because it still does its job even with the crack and made me motivated to cook baby food.  I got one as a present for an expecting friend.  However,  I doubt this product will last longer then a year, so be aware.

review/summary: Great little baby food maker!  Emphasis on "little". . .
review/text: I had my heart set on making all my own baby food, so I bought this baby food maker a few months ago.  I had never made baby food before, and in hindsight I think I would have done things a little differently.  I am hoping that my experience might be helpful to someone else in determining whether he/she wants to buy the Beaba.<br /><br />First of all, the Beaba is a great little machine and very convenient.  I just prep the food, throw it in, add the water, and let it do its thing until it's time to blend it up.  It's nice that it's all in one machine and I don't have to get any other dishes dirty.  It's also very reliable.  I can't even tell you how many times I have used it in the last few months.  Some days I use it 5-7 times and it just chugs on.<br /><br />That said, in my opinion it has a very small capacity.  That might not matter to you and you might not even notice.  It all depends on your style and how you want to feed your baby.  So far, I have come across two styles of grinding up your own baby food:<br /><br />1)  Steaming and grinding up baby food multiple times a week, possibly before every meal.  Some people really enjoy sharing whatever they are eating with their baby.  They prep it and feed it to their baby a few minutes later.<br /><br />2)  Steaming and grinding up baby food less often, but making larger amounts of food.  Some people want to have baby food on hand all the time.  They make a large amount of food, freeze it in ice cube trays, keep it in the freezer and thaw cubes before every meal.<br /><br />I think there are advantages to both styles, but I personally veer toward making larger batches of food and freezing it so I have it on hand.  If you are like me, the Beaba isn't your best option.  Get a nice Cuisinart with a larger capacity(or use the one you already have).  If you are worried about how to steam the food (I used to think I would have to do it on the stove), you can put it in a microwave safe dish with some water and steam it in the microwave.<br /><br />When I was particularly overwhelmed, a friend recommended that I get the "Fresh Baby So Easy Baby Food Kit."  If you're interested in making large batches of food, it can completely set you straight.  It comes with a video, a book, a handy laminated reference chart and two ice cube trays.  The video was incredibly cheesy, but it made me feel like I knew what I was doing in about 45 minutes.<br /><br />I hope this was helpful.  Good luck!

review/summary: Bitter plastic taste when run with only water. Not for my baby.
review/text: I ended up returning this item.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you buy this item, run it through to cook pure water only, then taste and smell the water.  I got a heavy plastic smell and shockingly intense bitter taste, even after 10 cycles after buying it new.<br /><br />At first the reviews I read seemed good and the product is so cute I wanted to like it very much, and the idea of making your own food seems healthier than buying prepackaged.<br /><br />Upon opening, I noticed that the cap for the boiler looked cheap and *entirely* plastic, not like the sturdy caps on similar boilers of a Krups espresso machine of the same price range.<br /><br />But I was thrilled and ready to go, and nearly made a batch of food immediately. I'm so glad I didn't.  However the instruction booklet had an odd suggestion that when first opened new, the user should cycle water only through the machine at least three times.<br /><br />The first time (filled water to the 3 cup line, poured it in, closed the lid, and turned it on), I had a heavy plastic smell in the steam. Still wanted to like it, and figured some smell was unavoidable.  I don't know if the smell came from the plastic lid of the boiler, or the steamer tray, or the clear container.<br /><br />I ended up running it about 6 or 7 times (again water only) and the smell decreased somewhat.  I still wanted to like the product.  That's when I thought I should taste the water.  It was unbelievably and sharply and very clearly bitter.  I couldn't even hold it in my mouth for more than a fraction of a second.  I ended up running the machine about 12 times with just water, and the taste was still just as bad.<br /><br />Had I run the Beaba with food and given it to my baby, I would've chalked it up to the baby hating broccoli. In the end I figured I could run it a hundred times, and even if the smell and taste eventually faded away until I couldn't detect it, I'd still be risking giving chemicals to my baby.  After all, you can't taste BPA either, so tasting it shouldn't be my threshold.  BPA free or not, this product when run with pure water produced hot water that tasted like poison; there are other chemicals out there to be worried about after all.<br /><br />Maybe after this experience I'm not sure I would trust any product involving heat and plastic, so it's back to my stovetop steamer and Cuisinart for my baby food.  (I kept the Beaba silicone freezer tray, since silicone is inert and it works great and I love the design of the tray)<br /><br />It is possible I had a defective lot or something, so if you do end up buying this product, I recommend running it with water only and tasting it for yourself.  Trust yourself, not me.<br /><br />****Feel free to comment to my review and indicate whether you do, or do not, taste the bitterness from running water-only through a brand new Beaba unit.****

review/summary: Better than other reviews make it out to be
review/text: I bought this basically because I am lazy about things, but I really wanted to make my own baby food.  I'll start with my two only 'Cons'.  First, when you turn it to the 'cook' setting, it will cook but it doesn't automatically switch back to the 'neutral' position.  I find this a bit odd since I'm not sure if it actually stops the heating element or just keeps going.  Either way, to combat this, I wouldn't suggest you go for a really long walk or go to the store.  Just stay around the area and you'll be fine.  Second, the machine gets quite warm.  I know it's cooking and all, but there's really no insulation against the heat.  I just caution that it may be more than what you're expecting.  Also, if you're making this food with little children around, it may be wise to watch them or give them gloves if they are going to help.<br /><br />With that being said, this was an awesome product.  I bought it because it does everything in one machine.  Yes, you could make baby food just as easily with a steam addition to a pot and a food processor, but then you have to wash both of those things.  I like that I only have to wash four pieces at most (the lid, the basket, the bowl and the spatula).  Pretty darn easy.<br /><br />The cooker makes quite a bit of food.  I was weary at first about the 'small' portions (if I'm going to do this, I'm going to take some time, do a few things and then be done with it), but it makes quite a bit.  It is also really fast since it steams it from just the right amount of water.  Previous posters have said that they didn't know how much water is was going to produce.  I figure trial and error isn't horrible.  Plus, I've added more water or just been ok with it.  The kid isn't really going to care.<br /><br />On a side note, after having made my baby food now for about three weeks, I'm amazed at the price of food in the store and what it looks like.  No banana actually looks like that after one day of being blended.  I'm not sure what they put in that stuff, but it must be magical, my bananas do not look like that.  I think it's better anyways.  Plus, I eat everything she doesn't eat after a meal and it tastes really good.<br /><br />In conclusion, I think it's a great product.  Oh, and if you're looking for an alternative to the brand specific containers...the company who's name means 'happy' makes a good four ounce option for WAY less.  It's BPA free as well.

review/summary: purees better than other options
review/text: I completely agree that this item is pricey but frankly, it purees better than my blender, food mill or cuisinart can.  I tried each of the other appliances and while they certainly ground up the food, the consistency was a bit lumpy with each.  The babycook actually created a creamy paste out of the food and my little one has LOVED the food I've made.  It's certainly not the only item out there for making baby food but if you have the money and the inclination to make your own baby food, then you really can't go wrong with this product.

review/text: I love mine. I have just about worn it out.  The lid and bowl have started to not quite line up but still work beautifully and now I can have a steam facial at the same time. It makes small enough amounts that the food will not be stuck in the feezer for ever and will still be fresh.  I've even used it to steam small amonts for everyone's dinners instead of dragging out the big steamer.  My sitter has been using it for her child too and it still keeps pumping out great food.  As for those that say get a full size steamer then haul out your blender or masher or whatever- I dont have room.  My galley kitchen is the size of a coffin with not much storage or counter space.  I use my garage for a pantry (I love to cook and have just about every imaginable gaget- old and new) and don't want to go running up and down stairs everytime I want to cook for my daughter.  This little gadget has a home on my counter and is easily squished into my over stuffed cupboards when needed.  My daughter is now 15 mos old and am still using it and plan on continuing to use it till it breaks.  LOVE IT!!!!

review/summary: I have a solution to the black mold problem in the Beaba!
review/text: Like most of you, I noticed the black mold problem and was horrified. I tried the vinegar solution to no avail. Then, I got to thinking....Why not try CLR! CLR is a green solution to rid your home or coffeemaker of calcium, lime or rust. I figured if it is safe to use in a coffeemaker then, why not give it a try!<br />It WORKED!! I put in about a 1/2 cup of the product (undiluted)into the water reservoir, let it sit a few minutes and THEN scrubbed the inside with a toothbrush. Keeping the CLR in the reservoir, I ran the unit to steam, the black mold particles started pouring out.<br />Then, I ran it several times with plain water. Particles kept coming. I took a look inside with a flashlight and after a few more touch ups with the toothbrush, the reservoir looked BRAND NEW.<br />For safe keeping I ran it again with more fresh water.<br />In the future, whenever you use your baby food maker, I would recommend emptying out the residual water (this is what caused the mold problem in the first place) then re-attaching the food basket/processor/bowl with the lid on and running the steamer with the LID OFF. You will be able to see the water bubbling, turning to vapor and then the reservoir will be completely dry. This step is KEY as you want to will ensure that your water reservoir is completely dry while you store it. Once this is done, you can re-attach the lid. It's also a good idea that you make sure your food basket/processor/bowl is dry as well.<br />Hope this helps!

review/summary: Every mom needs this!!!
review/text: I ABSOLUTELY love this product, so when I saw that there were 1 and 2 star reviews, I had to write a review for myself. As a first time mom, I had high hopes of making my baby's own baby food, but once I returned to work, I felt as though I wouldn't have the time. Then a coworker recommended the Beaba to me, and I am so glad he did. It is a bit pricey, so I bought a used one, and as one reviewer pointed out, the water reserve did have some brown stuff in it. In order to clean the reserve, I used hot water and a toothbrush and scrubbed it all out. I have NEVER seen any of the brown get into the water after the steaming. Since I bought the item used, it didn't come with the manual, but it is so easy to use, that I didn't need one! After my first use, I was in love. For a full time working mom, this steamer blender makes me feel as though I was able to slave away in the kitchen all day to make the best possible food for my baby. Carrots and potatoes only take about 20 mins to steam, and then maybe 2 mins to blend up, so to all the people who say that it isn't big enough, how much food do you need to make?! I am able to make over 12 ounces at a time. Besides, this means that I can change it up for my little one so she doesn't have to eat the same thing day in and day out. And for all the naysayers out there saying that you get the same results with a blender and steamer, you're right. But you can wash dishes by hand too, or use the dishwasher! To all those on the fence about this product, BUY IT! [...].

review/summary: Very helpful if you don't intend to buy jars of baby food
review/text: I have recently started using the Babycook, so I can't speak to it's reliability in a mechanical sense.  I don't know if it would withstand 'heavy' (daily) use, but it appears to be well-built with sturdy parts and works great so far.  It does exactly what it says it'll do.  here're some of my observations:<br />Pro's-<br />1. this machine steams veggies and fruits very well, you can leave it unattended and it'll shut off (although I still walk over and unplug it).  it takes about 15 minutes for sweet potatoes for example and about 10 (or less) for apples. They come out just the right consistency.<br />2. the machine is small and takes little counter space<br />3. it's very easy to operate (a minor gripe I have is that it takes a while to "click" everything into place, easy once you get used to it)<br />4. I found it faster to make baby food with Babycook vs. cooking veggies in a pot and transferring into a blender/food processor.<br />5. the size of it is just right; for small babies, it makes at least 4-5 servings of food.  I don't think it's small at all.  I find myself using it about every other day, if that - i make one type of food on sat, freeze leftovers and make something else on tues and/or wed- this will take me through most of the week, if i keep taking out frozen portions. Between peeling veggies, chopping, steaming and blending, it takes me about 25 min to make one type of food, but it lasts for a while.<br />6. reheating /defrosting is easy and quick, beats the Microwave.  I would suggest to purchase Beaba food containers and use them to reheat your food, they fit perfectly into the Babycook - or any small glass dish would do.<br />7. I think i'll keep using it as a blender/food processor after I no longer need steamed veggies pureed, it chopps up chicken and steak very well too.  So I'd estimate about a year's worth of use out of it, maybe longer.  In babyworld, that's a long time:)<br />Cons<br />8. cost - it's not cheap, although I found a better price elsewhere (see wayfair.com)<br />9. you have to transfer food out of a steaming container to the main container to blend, that's an extra step - as compared to Brezza, where you only use one container.<br /><br />PS - even though the main container is plastic, i found that carrots for example don't stain the plastic, it's held up well so far.

review/summary: A Must Have Baby Item
review/text: I'm a stay-at-home mom with an almost 7 month old.  I got the Babycook as a Christmas gift on recommendation from a coworker of my husband's.  In recent months, this has become my favorite baby item!<br /><br />I'm not a health nut.  I don't have a problem paying for convenience.  But, we figured over the course of a couple kids, this would save us money and would ultimately be healthier.  Little did I know!  It is so simple to use.  Although, the included directions stink and you need to watch a youtube video on it to understand.  But that only takes 3 minutes.  It is so simple to clean.  I was worried about this, but as soon as I've dished out my puree, I rinse the parts.  Then I can either wash right away or leave for when I finish the rest of the dishes.  If I'm making several batches in a row, I rinse and reuse.<br /><br />So the real kicker for me was when my larger-than-average son wasn't interested in solids.  I thought rather than using my Babycook, I'd just buy a couple of jars to start with to see what he liked.  He hated it all.  I wasted so much jar food because once opened it only lasts a day or two.  Then I decided just to whip up whatever fruits and veggies we had in the fridge with my Babycook.  I started with pears and carrots.  He loved both!  I'd even tried both from the jar and he had refused.  The taste difference is very distinct because of the freshness.<br /><br />I also love that I can choose the portion without wasting any of the food.  After I make a batch of whatever in my Babycook, I freeze the puree in classic Rubbermaid ice cube trays.  Once they are frozen, I pop them out and store them in plastic bags in the freezer.  Each ice cube is about an ounce, whereas jarred food is often in 4oz tubs.  My son doesn't even come close to eating 4 ounces at a sitting yet.  So I only thaw what I know he can eat.<br /><br />Making a batch doesn't take long, but I also love that it doesn't confine me to the kitchen.  If I start a batch steaming and then get pulled away to my child, the machine shuts off when it's ready and waits for me to come back.  No problem.  I tend to do a couple batches at once, and then go several weeks without needing to make any more.  For scale, one sweet potato made about 22oz of food and a pear made about 10oz.  Considering the sweet potato cost me about 80cents, I figured the savings was pretty decent.<br /><br />I'm very glad my husband's coworker suggested this, because I would have never considered making my own baby food.  Now I love it.  And I honestly believe if I can do it, anyone can.

review/summary: fast and easy
review/text: I would not have had the confidence or time to make my own baby food without this machine. Super easy.<br />I read reviews about mold, so I've never kept the cap on the water basin when in storage and I've never had a problem. I absolutely LOVE this machine.<br />I had many baby recipe cookbooks. If you are looking for SIMPLE, which I was, I found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0972722726">So Easy Baby Food: A Personalized Guide to Making Baby Food At Home, 2nd Edition</a>  The beginning where it tells you how to make the baby food is useless (since we already had the Beaba baby food maker), but it quickly tells you what flavors go together nicely. My kids never rejected a combo suggested by this book.<br />Now that my kids are on solid foods, I primarily use the steamer. It's a quick and easy way to make steamed veggies without having to pull out all my gear.<br />My sister has borrowed this machine to puree veggies to hide in her 10 year olds food (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006176793X">Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food</a> ) So, I'm expecting to use it for years to come :-)

review/summary: Yummy- No Mold in Mine
review/text: This is one useful little machine. I've been using it for about 3 months now and I love it. There's probably similar products out there, for less, that do the same thing, but this company is usually pretty responsible with their plastics and I'm lazy.<br /><br />I saw other reviews that said they had mold grow inside the water reservoir, but I checked in mine with a flashlight and didn't see a thing but clean. This may be bc I use soft water, but I'm pretty sure it's bc I turn the machine upside down on my counter dish rack to dry overnight. *Update- see comment- Scandinavian Child says ceramic reservoir cannot rust or get moldy!*<br /><br />That said, my only complaint (besides the price, but who doesn't think it's high?) is that there's no notification when the cooker finishes steaming. I think it might click when the light turns off, but I don't listen for that I have a crawling baby.<br /><br />The blender is pluse action, it doesn't stay on. I don't mind, the food is pretty soft when it's done steaming, it only takes a few seconds to get most everything smooth. Carrots, green beans, and peas are the exception so far, but I prefer to keep most of the food chunky, not adding any of the left over water back when blending (water the houseplants!). Then I freeze in the round beaba freezer tray and I add water before reheating then mash it all together.<br /><br />Breaking it down and washing is pretty much like washing a regular blender, with a steamer basket. My steamer basket was stained almost right away after butternut squash, but that probably wouldn't matter to most..<br /><br />I just found out (see below) the blender splash guard keeps food from getting in the reservoir, whoops!  I will be using that now!

review/summary: Used it every day until chunkier foods....
review/text: I love this beaba machine. I used it every single day when we were making purees (my son is now into the chunkier meals) and I still use the steamer option to this day to make steamed apples and pears. Yes, you can probably get the same effect with a traditional steamer basket, pot, hot water and blender. But that's the beauty of this little machine. It's all 3 things in one which means less clean up too.<br /><br />pros:<br />* EASY TO USE - the beaba babycook is super easy to use. The first couple tries I found myself having to think about each step (measure water level, pour water, align basket, align lid, turn knob to steam) but after a few times, you completely get the hang of it.<br /><br />* LIQUID RESERVES - so one of the best things I found about the beaba is that you can save the liquid from the steaming process and use it to mix in with other foods. For example, whenever I steam apples or pears, I save the liquid that's collected on the bottom and mix it in with oatmeal for an apple/pear oatmeal bowl. This is something that I found I can't do with a traditonal steamer/pot and blender. Any root vegetables, I would discard the liquid (mainly because of my fear of pesticides and such) but everything else, I would keep the liquid and mix it in with foods.<br /><br />* EASY TO CLEAN - the only things you have to clean are the steam basket, blender pot, and lids. They're dishwasher safe too so it can't get any easier than that.<br /><br />cons:<br />* SMALL BASKET - you can only cook a small amount of food at any time. I found that I could only fit around half a potato (diced) at a time. This wasn't a big issue for me because it only takes around 5-6 minutes for the steam to be done. But there were times that I used the traditional steamer basket/pot to steam 2-3 whole potatoes at once (for the freezer) and used the beaba blender to puree.<br /><br />* STAINS - the plastic material is a bit porous so you will see stains (especially from carrots and beets). The plastic steam basket will DEFINITELY stain. Mine is an orangey-color, from the carrots and sweet potatos.<br /><br />* EXPENSIVE - it is quite costly and it's really hard to find these on sale. If you plan on using it for one kid, I would reconsider. If you plan on using it for more than one kid, might be worth the investment.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very glad I made the purchase. Not only is it functional, it looks super cute on your kitchen counter. And makes the baby food making process that much more "fun".

review/text: So some of the reviews will scare you to death, but let me tell you, this is a GOOD device! As with everything, you have to clean it. It's easy, pour white vinegar in and let it rest overnight.<br /><br />This cooker does everything but EAT the food that you have made.

review/summary: Doesn't get any better!
review/text: First of all - to those who are having problems with mold/sludge - you need to take the lid off of the steam chamber after you steam EVERY time when it's still hot.  The water just evaporates out and you will have absolutely no issues.  This is a completely safe machine if you use common sense.<br /><br />Secondly, this machine has given me exactly what I need to create a healthy diet full of variety for my little guy.  It wouldn't be simpler to use.  You can do EVERYTHING with this one machine, and do it well.  I have had no problems with the processor, and it's created incredibly consistent, smooth purees each time.  If you're having problems, try adding a bit more liquid to your mix.<br /><br />The beaba silicone freezer thingy is really nice, but expensive.  We have one, but I also took my 50% off coupon to Michael's and got a Wilton silicone mini brownie pan which works great too.<br /><br />Put this on your registry, and when your babe is ready to eat solids you'll be glad you did!

review/summary: Waste of Money
review/text: I received this product as a gift.  I was so excited to use it.  However, I'm sadly disappointed with this product.  The puree is very weak!  It takes far too long to blend the products, having to stop many times to stir the contents because it doesn't blend evenly.  The only nice feature is the clean-up--only one bowl to wash.  This is totally overpriced.  I wouldn't even buy it if it were under $20.  Save the money and use a blender.

review/summary: Wonderful Product!
review/text: I was unsure about purchasing this product because I am a full time working mom in grad school and wondered if I would ever have the time to make home made baby food....so I let a friend in a similar situation try it first :) She told me it was awesome, fast, and easy to make food for a whole week in just an hour. So I gave it a try and I am so glad I did. I can make everything for my little guy in just a few short minutes. The longest time is spent while the food is cooking and you don't have to be hanging around watching that happen, so I can fold laundry, cook dinner, or study while it is happening. This was a wonderful purchase, and I would highly recommend it!

review/summary: It makes food prep fun
review/text: I am not a chef or even much of a cook. I bought this hoping it would make preparing food for my 7 month old easy and convenient and it is. I spend large parts of my weekends making all kinds of baby food because it is so fun and so very easy. Before I got the Babycook I used my magic bullet which was easy as well but it wasn't nearly as convenient as I had to boil  the apples (I don't have a steamer) and then I could only do a little amount at a time as the magic bullet can only handle so much due to space and power issues. The Babycook is small but it is better than pulling out the wedding gift blender that hides in the back of the pantry.<br /><br />I just read a review about getting mold in the steaming chamber so I rushed over to check to see if I had any especially since I tend to leave the water in there between uses but no, it was clean. I will empty out the water after use in the future and keep an eye out but so far all is well.<br /><br />I also read a review where they said that your baby would grow to not need this but what I have found is that is works great for adults too. My husband does not like vegetables and I have to admit I am not good about eating them myself so how do I handle that now? I use tricks from Jessica Seinfeld's "Deceptively Delicious" and add the pureed veggies to our adult dishes. I don't feel as bad eating a large slice of macaroni and cheese pie if it has cauliflower and butternut squash puree in it. So not only am I saving $$ by not buying packaged babyfood but I am also adding good nutrients to our food as well. Will I recoup the cost of the unit when all is said and done? Who knows and frankly this penny pinching mommy doesn't really care.

review/text: Got this babycook as a family gift and am very disappointed. The steamer works well, although the reports about the steaming well developing odor are scary. The blender works for about a half second until it spins freely, all the food stuck below it, not processed to where I can feed it to the baby. Maybe I'm not getting this right? I am following the instructions from the cookbook (small portions). So the rest has to be mashed with a fork and then there is still cleaning to do. I don't see how this is easier/faster than a proper blender...

review/summary: Worth it.
review/text: We've been using this product for about a month now and are very pleased not only with its performance, but the resulting foods.  We have a small apartment, and no dishwasher so even the thought of breaking out pots and pans for steaming, then the blender or food processor for blending seemed dreadful.  Especially because if we wanted to make batches of a couple of different types of food, we'd have to clean all of those big things in between each type of food!  The Babycook is nice because you steam and blend in one machine that has a very small counter footprint, and is very easy to clean.  If you want to make multiple foods in one evening, you simply rinse the basket, blending bucket and spatula b/w each food.  I should also note that my husband works full-time and I work out of the home 3-4 days a week and we still find this very convenient.  It doesn't take long at all.  Also, we definitely have not seen any of the "mold" other reviewers mention.  We've descaled with vinegar once in 4 weeks.  It isn't always possible, but I find it's best to get to the machine as soon as you can after it's finished steaming.  Then you unscrew the water reservoir's top (CAUTION: this can be very hot.  I use a dishtowel or pot holder) and let it dry out completely while it is still hot.  VERY LITTLE moisture will remain in the reservoir.  As for cost...locally our organic baby food costs about .85 a jar.  We would need to be able to make roughly 142 jars of food for this machine to pay for itself.  Each time I make food (every 2 or 3 days)I make about 8 jars.  So in about 17.5 evenings, we will cover cost.  As I mentioned earlier, we've had it for a month, so this great machine has almost already paid for itself.  Suffice it to say that if you have limited space and time, but really want to know exactly what is in your baby's food (and be able to feed them what you're having as a family, just as a puree) this machine is worth it.  Lastly, I have given this product 4 stars (instead of 5) because I have not found it super convenient for reheating - a feature that is advertised for it.  If you want to defrost or reheat something, it cannot be in a plastic container (makes sense...) it must be in glass or some polycarbonate container.  Well, everything I use for storing my son's food is plastic...and once it's frozen there's no getting it out of the plastic and into glass just to defrost it.

Typically when babies start eating they eat 1-2 ounces a day of baby food, so 1 tray lasts 1 week or more.<br /><br />You don't need to make huge batches when they are little and when they are big you just put when you are eating in there and dice it up!<br /><br />People have mentioned issues with cleaning, but I follow the rules for cleaning and make the food with boiled water or nursery water.....and I clean it with baking soda....no mold problems what so EVER

The steam didn't steam properly and the blade got dull fast. I called customer service and got condescending answers and telling me i needed to re purchase all of the items. Then they said it should be better. I told if it doesn't will you give me my money back or may i return the items and she said no. I needed to redo it many more times and I am not doing it right. I don't get how many ways you can push a friggin switch but regardless I am going not recommending this or will I buy another one ever again.

review/text: I never write reviews, which is interesting, because I live by them when searching for quality products.  That being said, if I do write a review it is because I have extremely strong feelings about a product.  I have been making my own baby food since 2008 when my first child was born.  It really isn't that hard once you have your system.  But than a friend gave me the Beaba Babycook and it changed everything.  It takes all of the guess work out of the process, and is much easier to clean up than my previous system of using large pots and pans, a strainer and a food processor.  If you are thinking about making your own baby food for more than one child this is an investment for you, totally worth it's price.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Makes life so much easier!
review/text: Whenever I read recipes for baby food, the amount of work that goes into them--chopping, cooking, blending, pureeing, etc.--seems really daunting. So I was really happy to find the Babycook, which does everything: you just steam your fruits or veggies, dump them out of the basket into the bowl and puree them. Ridiculously easy to use. It's also very easy to clean, as the blade is detachable. I've experienced the lime buildup that other reviewers have complained about, but descaling it the night before I plan to use it keeps it perfectly clean.

review/summary: Beaba baby cook
review/text: Love this machine-its all in one steamer and blender. Watch the mechanism for snapping bowl onto stand as the first one I purchased came cracked and probably from someone not watching as the parts line up to snap into a locked position. Worth the money as I can set it to steam and walk away-and I have twins so anything that cuts down on time is a huge plus!

review/summary: Just got my Beaba!
review/text: I have read through the entire instructions for the Beaba. It is very basic and lends to common sense.<br /><br />I was under the impression that the Beaba did the steaming and blending in a complete cycle. You have to steam, then pour the chopped food into the blending bowl. So, two separate steps for the operator.  FYI<br /><br />I would like to mention an important note, it says to NEVER place anything other than water or distilled white vinegar in the water steamer.  CLR is a chemical, please DO NOT put this in the water steamer to clean the machine. I think we are all using the Beaba to keep a very clean,  "chemical-free" diet for our babies. Why would you use a chemical in the water steamer?  To properly maintain the Beaba I would recommend leaving the lid off of the water steamer AFTER you have completed your cooking. This should ensure that no mildew or mold grows in the water steamer by completely drying out or at least by not promoting a ideal environment for growth.<br /><br />Also, the baby cook book that come with it only has 12 recipes, 3 for each stage of food for the baby. Not all that great. FYI<br /><br />I will update after frequent use (=

review/summary: Convenient, Easy to Use
review/text: I love this machine! Just reading the directions at first I was slightly intimidated, but once I actually used it, it was very straightforward. It's so easy to just throw in whatever I want to cook for the baby (usually whatever we're cooking for ourselves) into the little machine and turn it to "steam." While it's cooking, I can do whatever else I need to. After 15 minutes, when it's done, I can either just give the steamed food to the baby if it's mushy enough, or tip it over into the blender part and puree. Mold has not been an issue. Carrots did stain the cooking tray slightly. Some people have said it will be useless after the baby gets to solids, but I think it will be convenient for me to steam single-portion vegetables for myself. One flaw I'm not a fan of--it would be nice if when it was done cooking/steaming, it made some sort of "ding" or alarm sound. As it's designed now, the light just turns off.

review/summary: Awesome Product!!
review/text: Hey,<br />I'm a first time dad.  This product is GREAT!!  We could either be spending 50 cents or more for each premade baby food container from Gerber, or you can use this!  So, to list off its pros and cons:<br /><br />1.  Really easy to use.  Put some water into the steam side, put whatever you want cooked in the basket, turn it on, come back ~10-15 minutes later, chop it up in the blender side (we add more water and oatmeal at that point too), and then serve!  Start to finish is about 20 minutes tops, and only about 5 of those minutes are you actually there doing anything (the rest it's steaming so you're free to do whatever while it works).  Cleanup is very easy, just wash it out, which also just takes minutes, tops.<br /><br />2.  Cheap to use.  Fruits and veggies are cheap to buy at the store, certainly cheaper than buying pre-made baby food.  You'd be amazed how many meals one sweet potato will provide for a baby, I know I was!  Plus, you can theoretically cook anything in it for your baby, although we have yet to expand past fruits and veggies.<br /><br />3.  Expensive to buy.  On the other hand, we got this as a gift, so that wasn't a factor for us.  The little bit more effort this is over buying premade food seems like a tolerable cost to us (we both work and this seems well worth it to get her quality food we make ourselves...plus it's kind of fun, haha.)<br /><br />Ok, so that's pretty much it.  My wife and I are really happy with this product, and would totally give it to other people in the future (if we liked them enough to spend $135 on them, at least, haha!)

review/summary: The best purchase I got so far for my baby!
review/text: I can't say enough how awesome this cooker/steamer/blender is!  It literrally takes minutes to make (not counting the time it needs to steam the veggies of course). I make fresh purees for my baby every morning before going to work..It's so easy!  I cut up the veggies, put it in the steamer basket to steam cook, by the time I get out of the shower and change, the food is ready and I just puree it for 20 seconds and my daughter has fresh yummy veggies for the day!  It  is super  healthy  for her and she LOVES it!

review/summary: not really worth it.
review/text: this product is o.k. but i think you can get away w/out it and be fine ...not really worth the money. CONS: it only makes a very small amount of food at once. if I am going through the trouble, i'd rather make a bigger batch and freeze it. Also, the lid on the resevoir gets so hot and is shaped oddly so that it is difficult to get a grip of it to take off. a serious caution, the booklet i got w/ mine (purchased in 2008) has recipes that include foods that you are not supposed to give to babies under a year old!!!!!finally, the blend mode does not have an optional 'stay on' so that if you want to puree something, you need to stand there and hold the button. you can't do something else while it's blending b/c you need to be right there to keep it running. PROS: technically, it does what it says it does, and it is easy to clean. I find that even though i own this, i tend to use my good old pan w/ a steamer basket and then puree in my food processor. works just as well, saves time, and makes more at once.

review/summary: Amazing Baby Cook
review/text: This product is simply amazing. Steams fruits and veggies perfectly and the food processor is phenomenal. Very easy to use and even easier to clean. I truly enjoy making my baby's food. One tip I have found is to remove the water left after steaming into a glass cup and slowly add it back to the bowl while processing. The lid must be on to blend the food, so it will take you a few times to remove the lid to add the water; however, you can control the consistency of the food this way. Mommy and baby are really happy with this purchase. :)

review/summary: Great for fresh cooking not for freezer user
review/text: If you are like me and you don't like to freeze food, the babycook is just great.<br />I cook every night for my daughter (she is 10 Mo) some vegetables (swiss chard, leaks, brocollis, sweet peas, squash, carrots, spinach,....), meat (mostly chicken with lemon and thym and then I mix it with yoghourt).<br />The cleaning is easy.<br />Though when I cook apple sauce I usually use a larger pan, as I cook a very large protion of it. Still she doesn't eat the vegetables if it is not freshly cooked.<br /><br />If you want to cook large portion and freeze them this is certainly not what you are looking for.

review/text: I purchased this product for much cheaper from diapers.com. It is wonderful. Unlike another reviewer, I like that fact that it doesn't prepare a large portion. I don't have a lot of freezer space and I like to offer my daughter a variety of foods, so, making a pound of sweet potatos at one time would do me no good. I rather prepare a few carrots, a few apples and oranges, and other small recipes, than have a whole lot of one thing. It's easy to clean and saves you time on having to clean out a steamer, and processor. I LOVE IT! ALSO, IT IS BPA-FREE!!

It's great that you can just turn in it and let it cook, you don't have to keep watching it. The only things I would change is maybe it beeping when the timer goes off instead of just the light going off, and I wish it was a little bigger. I like making big batches of baby food and freezing it. This you can only do a little at a time. But other than that, it's great!!

review/summary: This thing is the greatest
review/text: I made my 1st child's food using a pot of boiling water and steam basket, then transferring it to a bowl and using a kitchen aid hand blender. It was such a chore and so much clean up. I always felt I had to do 10 pounds of carrots to make it worth my time thus making it an even bigger chore and there'd be a few chunks I just couldn't get. Then of course freezing in ice cube trays and all that hassle. Plus when boiling water on the stove, I occasionally would forget about it and burn my pot. Now that I have a toddler and 6 month old and working full-time, I was tempted by the baby bullet commercials, did some research and decided to try the Beaba instead.<br /><br />I LOVE IT!!! It's no longer stressful and a huge chore. I can easily throw in a couple carrots while I'm cooking dinner for everyone else and now there's dinner for all. The food comes out so smooth. I don't have to pay attention to water boiling on the stove. I can just let it steam and it turns itself off when ready and then I can puree when I'm ready. Clean up is as easy as top rack dishwasher. I leave the lid off the water container when I'm done as I read the reviews on mold, so I've had no problems there. If you question whether to spend the money, I would say it is totally worth it. It pays for itself in a couple weeks/vs buying baby food especially if you have a big eater like I do. Highly recommend this thing.

I've had to replace the blade, nut and the main bowl because each part has broken in the 6 months I have been using it. Given the price, the product parts could be made better. I've spent bout $60 getting new parts. If I find myself with another little one in the future I'm going to try a new brand and hope it's made of better quality parts.

review/summary: Want to love it more but there are issues
review/text: Intended to make baby's food, thought I would just use my steamer basket and food processor but got this for Xmas and use it daily. I've steamed and pureed fruit, veg, meat, fish, grain and used it to reheat. I like that you just set it to steam and walk away (you have a baby after all). It's generally easy to use and clean. Complaints about big batches are funny because I can't do SMALL enough batches! I like to make just one or two servings to eat that day. I don't want to serve frozen food all the time or the same food day after day. Babycook does not blend small batches, I have to mash by hand! This is exactly what such a tiny appliance should do!<br /><br />There are also design issues, not how it looks (it is cute) but how it works (it is finicky). The spatula and mixing lid are awkward extra pieces to keep track of and clean. The mixing lid is useless. When removing the lid to stir there are two messy lids to remove, set down on the counter and clean, etc. It works just fine without it. The spatula is not great at scraping the bowl and if it is only intended to lift a hot basket, this could be solved more intelligently. Teardrop lid handles are slippery and difficult to grasp. Blades are not easily removable.

review/summary: Great Appliance for Homemade Baby Food
review/text: I got the Beaba Babycook last week for my 5 month old baby.  It worked GREAT!!  I read many mixed reviews here in Amazon but was willing to take the chance so I can make homemade food for my baby.  I used apple as the first start and it turned out to be so tasty.  Since I just started introducing her solid food so I ended up finishing the rest of the batch myself.  It took a little time to figure out how to use it first as the instruction is not very clear.  Anyway, after you have figured how this product works, it does a great job!  I used a medium size apple and it could make about 3 servings.  It is so compact that it takes so little of counter space.  I love it and I am so glad I brought it.

review/summary: Very disappointing
review/text: I was very excited about this product when I bought it - the idea of steaming and blending the food in one gadget seemed like a big time saver. However, it's not nearly as much of a time saver as it seems. The bowl is tiny, so to make enough food for just 2 days or so, I had to fill the bowl at least twice to steam the veggies(and that's about 10-15 min of steaming each time). An average-sized cauliflower took me 3 steaming session to get through, so that's almost an hour of steaming. Then the blending... unfortunately, this product is not nearly powerful enough to blend veggies quickly. Even with adding a lot of water, the food seems to get stuck and the blades are just blending what's on the bottom of the bowl and not moving the food around at all. You also can't move the food around without taking apart the whole contraption - likely because of it's baby-proof design. Several times already I ended up pulling out a regular blended and transferring the veggies to finish blending them. I've now given up on this disappointing product and will have to return it. I'm hoping that a regular-sized food processor and a steamer will do the trick in a lot less time and with much less effort.

review/summary: Leaky, Leaky, Leaky
review/text: I've had this product for about 6 months, and in the beginning it worked great.  I was using it every week to make a surplus of baby food to feed my daughter throughout the week.  I properly descale it with vinegar regularly, and follow instructions for water amounts.  Then, about a month ago I noticed that when I steamed the food there would be a puddle of water that formed underneath the mixer on the counter.  This worried me a bit because I'm not a huge fan of electrical appliances sitting in puddles of water!  I tried to tighten the blade so that it wouldn't leak, but no use.  I contacted the company, and they told me I needed a new rubber gasket which forms the seal around the blade hole.  I ordered one, and after I replaced the old gasket it worked fine for one steam, but then the very next time I used it the thing leaked again!  I ordered a five pack of the rubber gaskets, thinking that if I'm going to continue to use this thing I'll have to replace the gasket every time (absurd, but I really liked the product).  Well, I put in a new gasket, and it STILL leaked!  So now I'm left with a package of gaskets and a leaky baby food maker.  I'm going to attempt to contact the company, but I don't have high hopes for a refund or replacement.

review/summary: What of Peanuts?
review/text: For some reason we don't see a lot of Virginia peanuts in California. Ralph's supermarkets carried their own brand for about 2-3 years but it has since been pulled from the shelves, which is a shame because there's nothing like Virginia peanuts. They are large and crunchy in a way that puts Planters to shame. But as is the case when supermarkets no longer carry our favorite products, consumers must take to the web to satisfy their palettes.<br /><br />I found Feridies Peanut Company on the web and, judging by all of the positive reviews, decided to take a chance. Well, I'm happy to say the gamble paid off. These nuts are exceptional. They have the perfect amount of salt and are crunchy in a way you'll have to taste to believe. Give them a try.<br /><br />Update - Just found out that the grocery chain Bristol Farms carries these nuts. Not cheap, but definitely worth it.

review/summary: Not the original Knorr Pesto Sauce mix-this is loaded with artificial ingredients.
review/text: I bought a huge case of these knorr pesto sauces because my fiancee and I used to eat them a year ago all the time and back then they were delicious.  But then we moved and my local grocery store did not carry the knorr pasta sauces.  However when they arrived and I opened the package I was in for a big disappointment.  One thing I used to love about knorr was they used real ingredients-real parmesan and romano cheeses. Apparently not any more.  Now this sauce mix is completely artificial-corn starch and preservatives and artificial flavors-blech!  It doesn't taste anywhere near as good as the original.<br /><br />However I give it three stars because it's still tastes better than a lot of the sauces in the store and at least you can use olive oil in your sauce instead of the vegetable oil based sauces in the store.  Knorr should be ashamed for ruining a great product.  If they had stuck to the original recipe, I'd have given it five stars.  I know they are saving money by using artificial ingredients but the cost is too high as this affects the taste and our health.  I wouldn't have bought 24 packs if I had known the recipe had changed.  I hope they will reconsider the change and put real ingredients back in this product.  Here are the ingredients since Amazon doesn't list them:<br /><br />Maltodextrin, corn starch, wheat flower, salt, whey (milk), monosodium glutamate,spinach, garlic powder, basil, sugar, natural flavor (soy), onion powder, spice

review/summary: So Yummy
review/text: Mmmmm.....this sauce is so yummy. I can't get it in my local grocery stores, so I was so excited to find them on amazon. Throw in some chicken, sundried tomatoes, or veggies to make it even better.

review/summary: Always my kids favorite and fresh too
review/text: I have a hard time finding these in my local grocery store.  Creamy Pesto is my 4 and 6 yr olds' preferred/only sauce for pasta so it has been frustrating driving store to store to find it and not having it when the 4 yr old only wants "green" noodles for dinner.  I was very happy that Amazon carried it.  It comes in 12 and 24 pack boxes.  We went with the 24 pack box because my kids will eat it once a week.  I was worried that it might expire before we got to use all 24 but the expiration date is 1.5 yrs out from when we recieved the box so I am just thrilled!

review/summary: Best granola with lowest fat!
review/text: I've tried nearly all the fancy brands at Wholefoods and Trader Joe's and even boutique bag-your-own varieties and this is the best organic granola. And when they say low fat they mean it! One gram of fat per serving and all the flavor and crunch you could want. As far as the chew, I like more than I've found in any granola so I'm used to adding my own dried fruit. That said, the cranberries here are plump and chewy unlike the dehydrated berries I come across everywhere else. Obviously, I can't say enough...
