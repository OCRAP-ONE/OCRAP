review/summary: Pickapeppa of the Caribbean
review/text: Pickapeppa sauce is an underrated condiment. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5ZHO">Huy Fong Sriracha Chili Sauce, 17 Ounce Bottle (Pack of 6)</a> is rightly revered for its kicking up of Ramen noodles, while <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HNS55A">TABASCOï¿½ brand Pepper Sauce - Original Red Gallon</a> is the all-American hot sauce from Louisiana. Pickapeppa isn't all that spicy. It's subtle. It's not overwhelming. When I put pickapeppa on kale and yams, it tasted filling and perfect! Pickapeppa isn't the typical hot sauce based on jalapenos and other chiles--but raisins and mangoes. Yes,a hot sauce made from mangoes. No wonder it's tropical perfection! Listen to Bob Marley sing on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QOOCTE">Songs Around The World (CD + DVD)</a> and crank up the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IOMWJ4">Putumayo Presents: African Reggae</a>, and pickapeppa is PERFECT!

The Black Bean Soup Mix instructions were easy to follow and the soup results were very enjoyable. We would highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Outstanding! Fresh taste and a wonderful alternative to traditional seaweed wraps!
review/text: I purchased these as an alternative to seaweed wraps because I had guests coming to a sushi party who did not like the traditional seaweed wraps. They were blown away by my effort to find an alternative and they LOVED them!!! They wrap very easily and seem to actually 'keep' a bit better than the seaweed wraps because they don't get as soggy by any means. Not only are there several colors, but they are SOOOO nice to use when making traditional sushi because they automatically make the sushi have a really nice contrast to the seaweed wraps. Best part: the plain ones in the package also can be used to make some sweet dessert sushi: mix some rice w/sugar (or powdered sugar sprinkled over rice), add a row of cream cheese and some pieces of chocolate or fruit inside. IMPRESSIVE!!!!! Kids will LOVE them!!!

review/text: I have a 10 yr old & a 7 yr old dog. The 10 yr old will eat anything, the 7 yr old is extremely picky & has a delicate stomach. We were using brands of dog food you find in the grocery store until a trainer opened our eyes to the difference in qualities of dog food & the effect it can have on behavior as well as overall health. There are 2 websites we checked before we chose Premium Edge Healthy Weight II, one was  the Whole Dog Journal 2010 Approved Food List ([...]),the other was Dog Food Analysis ([...]). On both websites this food is recommended. Both dogs absolutely LOVE this food & I feel so much better knowing that they are getting quality food.

review/summary: Good quality, affordable food.
review/text: It's really important to me to feed my pets quality food.  My first dog had severe allergies to food, and all of the vets we took her to caught that.  She had terrible skin rashes, raw hot spots, and constant ear infections--all of which are indications that she had food allergies.  I wish I had had the Internet back then so I could have saved her life.  She eventually ended up getting stomach cancer and dying at the very young age of five.  I truly believe that if we had switched her to a quality food, she could have lived a longer, happier life. It was an important lesson for me to learn, and I will never feed any of my animals sub-par food ever again.<br /><br />I have had my current dog on Natural Balance Ultra Premium as well as Solid Gold Hund n Flocken.  Both of those foods are of good quality, but are also very pricey.  If you would like to do your own research on different food options and brands, [...]and [...]are great sites.<br /><br />Natural Balance, Solid Gold, and Premium Edge have all received 4-star ratings at dog food analysis.  The biggest issue with Premium Edge (and all of Diamond foods--including NB and SG) was the fact that there weren't any written guarantees that they did not use Ethoxyuin as a preservative.  I emailed Diamond foods, and received an email stating that they and their suppliers no longer use Ethoxyquin as a preservative.<br /><br />I'm really impressed with Premium Edge.  It is a good quality food and it comes at a much better price for me (on top of being significantly cheaper, the bags are 35lbs as opposed to NB and SG's 33lb. bags).  The final selling point for me is that my dog really LOVES her food now.  With both previous brands, she would eat half of her food and then walk away and eat the rest of it later when she got hungry enough.  With Premium Edge Skin and Coat, she scarfs everything down right away.  She even BEGS me to feed her in the morning and evening now.<br /><br />All in all, I'm really happy with my choice to switch to Premium Edge.  It's an affordable, good quality dog food, and my dog LOVES it!  I highly recommend giving it a try.  :)

review/text: I was introduced to this dog food over tens years ago. One of the local pet stores recommended it for our golden retriever because of the skin problems that he was experiencing. His skin and coat were back to normal once he had been on this dog food for two weeks. I've been feeding it to all my dogs ever since. I have four dogs now and so the price  on Amazon is really appreciated...Along with the quick delivery. As an aside: My dogs love the taste so much that I have used the kibble as their behavioral treat as well (e.g., sit, stay, etc.) Can't get a better taste review than that!

review/summary: Made my dog's coat shine
review/text: I have been impressed with this dog food, that I started using when I saw it at a local feed store.  It was cheaper than the other foods with similar premium ingredients, so that was a plus.  My senior dog's coat had gone from black to a brownish color on Avoderm, indicating that something was off.  Since I've been feeding Premium Edge, her coat has gone back to a very shiny black.  I have to conclude that this food has had something to do with that.  I checked it out on a dog food review site, and they give it 4 stars, which is pretty good, on their 6-star system.  (Their 6-star foods are very expensive and I can't afford them.  I also don't think my house pets need them) Their major qualm was that there was no statement about whether the fish in the food contained ethoxyquin, which is apparently a bad thing.  I wrote the company and received a response saying their food was ethoxyquin-free, even though there was no statement to that effect on the sack.  Good enough for me.  Too bad Amazon appears not to plan to carry this brand any longer.

review/text: Decided to purchase the 35 pound bag for my 12 year old dog who have skin allergy base on the positive reviews I've read on line.  Very happy with shipping & Packaging service from Amazon.  But very dissapointed in Premium Edge.  Not only did the food not help him, it seemed to made him worst the first couple of days! Also, the product says for adult dogs but on the package it also says from age 1 to 10 years of age???? My dog is 12.  I don't understand all the positive feed back for this product?  and I so regret for buying such a large bag or the product for that matter.

review/summary: Great value product that is full of protein
review/text: We recently started eating more healthy in our household. We switched to pasture raised chickens and eggs with no antibiotics, no corn feed, no hormones. We also switched to pasture raised beef and hogs. Once again, no hormones, no antibiotics, and no corn feed. What a difference in ease of weight control. Not to mention a lot healthier all the way around. So, it did not take us long to decide to provide a better dog food for our two blue ticked beagles. Since we can not insure that the beef or chickens used in dog food are of the same quality as what we eat, salmon and potatoes are a better choice. Our female has lost 5 pounds from a hefty 40 lbs to 35lbs and has leveled out beautifully. The male has lost 8 pounds and has also leveled out to the vets praise. She was impressed with their progress at 9 years old. My geriatric children love the taste and no longer hesitate around the food bowl. The internet is a wonderful thing and I am so glad we found Premium Edge. It is a high quality dry dog food that is reasonably priced. You can pay more, but you return on investment will be marginal. We have started topping it off with Dogswell canned dog food just to add an extra bit of flavor and our dogs have never been happier.

review/summary: Very good food.
review/text: I've spent years reading labels on dog food bags, trying to establish a balance between good food and a reasonable price. Premium Edge is the answer to this quandary. I confess, I recently strayed to another brand in search of a food that I didn't have to drive thirty miles out of my way to get. On the surface the other food seemed to fit the bill (no wheat or corn). But after a few weeks on the other food, my old hound began shaking his head a lot and two hot spots appeared. I learned the hard way that this particular dog is allergic to soy products.<br /><br />So we've returned to our tried and true Premium Edge and, after two weeks, not only is hound better, but the other dogs' are glowing again (and I didn't even notice the loss of sheen). What a relief to find it on Amazon at a reasonable price and even more reasonable shipping charges.

review/summary: Seems to Be Good Food - Dogs Like It.  Does have an Odor While Other Premium Foods Do Not.
review/text: We have been through 3 brands of dog food over the past 3 years because of price/availability on Amazon.  This is the last (Amazon delivered) brand we tried because our regular brand became unavailable.<br /><br />The Premium Edge Salmon seems to have a quality list of ingredients & seems comparable to the Costco Salmon brand (Costco is slightly cheaper but Costco requires an annual membership fee & Amazon delivers to your doorstep).  The food does have an odor that we didn't find in our other premium foods, and I do not know the source of the odor (we previously have feed our dogs <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCWAFY">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Large Breed Adult Canine Formula Dry Dog Food, 30-Pound Bag</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NZPFB0">Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Chicken & Oats Dry Dog Food, 22.5-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The dogs do not seem to mind the odor & happily chow down on this food (they are slightly picky and, when I was in a food pinch, turned their noses up at Iams).  Their stools are firm & their coats are good & healthy.<br /><br />Because we go through so much dog food (120lbs/month), and because of availability issues that I've had with Amazon in the past, we will be switching to the Costco/Kirkland food.  However, if this is less of a concern for you & if you want your dog food delivered to your doorstep (a real plus), then this is a premium food that is worth trying. Both this brand & the Costco brand is manufactured by Diamond Pet Foods, a company that has had a lot of recalls in the past (in fact, both this food & the Costco food were subject to recall in early 2012).

That's my main thing lol...<br /><br />But basically I tried this food out because I am a vegetarian...because I do not like the way livestock is raised and what not.  It may seem stupid but switching to a fish based dog food is much more appealing to me than random parts of abused lamb, chickens, etc...not that my dog cares.<br /><br />When I opened the bag the biggest thing I noticed was the smell.  Not overly appetizing for me but it smelled like...food!  Burnt toast mostly...but it didn't smell like greasy crap like most dog foods do.  My dog also noticed this and was reluctant to eat it the first day.  She has warmed up to it a bit.  She still eats smaller portions but I believe that is because it is probably higher quality and she might feel full sooner.

review/summary: Dogs love the food - Premium Edge Skin & Coat Salmon, Pot & Veg
review/text: I have 2 large breeds; a Tibetan Mastiff 2 years old and a Newfie 8 years old. I used to buy the old Sam's brand Lamb and Rice formula - which is a good food, but I always had to add something to it, like milk, broth, treats to make it palatable to the pups. This formula doesn't require anything but the kibble, and so treats remain treats instead of part of the meal.<br /><br />They both eat it up without any issues; no digestive problems.<br /><br />I originally found out about it through our dog trainer. She suggested it because my Newfie is a senior and is starting to have allergies - itchy skin. We live in the South and have 2 long haired large dogs who are prone to allergies. This has helped some, but I keep them on it because they do eat it and the ingredients are high quality.<br /><br />I started giving them Omega 3,6,9s and Biotin again. I used to do this over a year ago and they both had beautiful hair and skin. My TM has some itching, but not bad - gorgeous coat. The Newfie is miserable and I hope putting her back on the Omega's and Biotin will reverse the issues. Her hair and skin was great when she was on them before, I just wasn't 100% sure it was the vitamins that helped. I will know soon enough and post my findings. Just put them back on them, so it may take me 2 months to update. I have also tried other holistic approaches to helping her with her skin as well as Benadryl - they help some, but not enough.<br /><br />Won't be disappointed and you can't beat that delivery is free, no tax and it comes straight to your door - I enjoy that I do not have to lug the large bags around Sam's. :)

So I just threw out what little was left of the old stuff and didn't bother mixing anymore. My two smaller dogs had no issues. My larger dog got some horrible gas, like she always does when we go through with food changes, and she seemed a bit bloated and crampy. That lasted about a day or two and she's been fine ever since. Well, old Sadie still has gas from time to time, but that's not uncommon for her size. At any rate, she's always gotten a case of the gas from time to time, just like her daddy (me). My bottom line: My dogs like it, my wife is satisfied with the ingredients, and the price isn't insane. I intend to buy it for awhile and see...

review/text: I researched all the medium priced good quality foods made of lamb and rice and this was the only product that actually had real lamb as the first product followed by lamb meal, then has rice, carrots, peas, eggs, etc.  Only nonfood items are the required minerals to balance diet and taurine and glucosmine.  More natural than the natural products.  Couldn't ask for more.  Plus comes in 35# bags not just small.  Definitelt recommend.

review/summary: Superb, top of the line dry dog food
review/text: I got this bag just today. It arrived promptly in a giant box. Opened the box & the bag had no tears, scuffs, or any damage. Perfect condition. I dumped the dry food into my storage box & liked the fact there's no artificial colors. I also liked the small kibble size. It's perfect for any size dog to eat. I mix canned food into the dry & it mixes so much easier with the smaller bites. I add canned tuna or salmon cat food to the dry food. The fish oils seem to be good & healthy for them. Also makes their fur soft & shiney. But, do that only on your own accord, I'm NOT a vet!  My 3 big Labs went bonkers over this stuff. They scarfed it down like it was a hamburger. I got a kick out of them wagging their tails & chowing down on their food so happily. After dinner they drank their water, & went outside as usual. Came back in & were much obliged happy campers. There was no usual rolling around, itching, & scratching all over the place. They were calm, cool, and extremely satisfied & so am I. So I give this a positive 5 STARS!<br />I believe my dogs to have food allergies to the cheap dog foods out there, & will try to keep buying this fantastic food for them.

review/summary: Only Brand I now Recommend
review/text: I have used Premium Edge Lamb Formula dry dog food for years.  While many dog food manufacturers use real lamb - and not lamb meal - in their adult formulas, this is the ONLY manufacturer that uses real lamb in its Puppy Formula as well.  Hounds have sensitive stomaches and lamb digests best without upsetting their stomaches.  It also promotes a shiny, healthy coat while minimizing shedding and flakey skin conditions that are experienced by some breeds.  The food nuggets are small in size and appropriate for all breeds and sizes of dogs; the nutritional values are the highest or on level with that of many so-called "premium" brands - and better than that of some.  I have fed Premium Edge Lamb - both adult and puppy - to my Salukis for 12 years and heartily recommend it.  Read the order of ingredients in your pet's food; they are listed in the order of most to least included in the product.  "Lamb meal" contains ground bone and other waste as well as the meat itself; this manufacturer uses only the Meat.

review/text: I have an older Newfie and he has had skin problems most of his life.  Unfortunately, he is also a very picky eater, so finding a balance between what he will eat and what is good for him has been tricky.  He really likes this food!  Finally, my worried mom's heart can rest.  His skin issues are clearing and he doesn't scratch like he wants to peel off his skin.  I highly recommend if your dog shares these issues... get this food, mix it with some sensitive skin wet food or even salmon... your dog with thank you!

review/text: My dog is 3 and he has been chewing and licking his paws for as long as I can remember.  Probably half his day was spent chewing and licking.  He has had many steroid shots and has been taking claritin twice a day for several months.  Nothing has worked....I decided to try this dog food before taking him to a specialist and it has been amazing.  He has been eating the salmon and potatoes formula exclusively for about a week and a half and now he is hardly ever licking his paws!!!  Today I even skipped his claritin and he has not licked his paws all day.  No more grains for my dog!

It sounds like fabulous food, with quality ingredients, but, I am afraid to give him any more, since I don't know if he can handle/tolerate it.  I still have about 32 lbs. of this food left at my house :)

review/summary: Not so great..Expiration date soon..
review/text: I decided to try this dry food on my two dogs, because of all the great reviews.<br /><br />However....Neither dog will eat it.  One dog took a couple bites, and refuses to eat it..The other dog wont even take a bite.<br />I tried mixing it with their favorite can food, but this only made matters worse.  They would not even touch it.<br /><br />I was confused about this, since one of my dogs will eat just about anything, while the other will eat dry food mixed with cannned.<br />The reviews were all good, so...<br /><br />I checked the package...And, I think I may have found the answer...There is a last sale date of April 11, 2012....That's only about 6 weeks away.<br />I would never purchase a food that was going to expire so soon, even on sale in a store.<br /><br />I now have a huge bag of dog food in the kitchen..I have tried daily to give each dog a little, but no go.  They will not eat eat it!<br />The pieces are all the same size and color...Not appealing, and there is not even a smell that says "eat me, I am food".  Could be cardboard, judging by<br />the dog's reaction.<br /><br />Kind of hard to return, since it is opened and is 18 pounds of dog food.<br />I have a feeling it is either because the food is so old, or it is tainted.  Dogs can sense when there is a problem with food!<br /><br />Sorry about the bad review...But, This was money that will just end up getting poured into the rubbish.<br />Maybe I was only the unlucky one...Check the last sale dates on your package if any of your dogs wont eat it!<br /><br />I will stick to Pedigree and Mighty Dog..less expensive, not as healthy, but both my dogs love it.<br />I cannot recommend this brand..I have two large dogs, mixed breed and are not usually choosy about what they eat.<br />Except for the Premium Edge, which they give  a paws down to!

review/text: I have an 8 month old shepherd puppy, and he absolutely loves this food. I had been feeding him Iams previously, which his stomach could not tolerate it (every other day he would have diarrhea :( poor baby). Then switched him to Acana, which was an improvement but still not the best it could be. So I bought him this food hopeful that the prebiotics would help with his digestion. Since switching him, he has not had a single bathroom issue. This food is 100% worth the money, My pup is happy and so much healthier (and his coat shows it, too!).

review/summary: Top Tier and Best Buy
review/text: Fallot is one of the top five usually available.  If you cannot find locally, this is the best buy on Amazon.  It is fine in flavor and properly strong.  Shipping is expensive, but stale on the store shelf is 100% waste.<br /><br />Fallot is one of the top tier because of several factors:<br /><br />It is an independent mill in Burgundy.<br /><br />They source their particular strains of Brassica seeds carefully.<br /><br />They use verjuice instead of other liquids.<br /><br />The three pack is a better deal.  But, unless you use a lot of this mustard and fairly regularly, big is false economy.  Do not get a 13.5 oz jar if it takes you six months to use.  It will go first flat and then in another six months completely dead.  So stick with 7 0z. unless you really need it.<br /><br />Dijon is time, heat and light sensitive.  If you buy the three pack, keep all in the refirgerator.

review/summary: Amazing Food
review/text: First Off, I have to say not only am I impressed with royal canin but my dogs love every bit of it! I've used holistic, natural, and raw diets for many of my dogs. Currently my two cocker spaniels are both on Royal Canin: Cocker Spaniel 25 and have been for years. They started out on Merrick then moved to Nuto, Wellness and finally Royal Canin. All of which are a high grade dog food. My dog stopped and would not eat merrick (when he did he would pick the little life bits out.) Nutro and Welness both of which very good foods caused mild allergies in my older spaniel. Finally Taking On Royal Canin my dog gained the weight he lost from not eating and all around improved his skin and coat without using a supplement. Now I don't know what the other reviewer was looking at but in this one in particular does not contain any corn, It contains Corn Gluten Meal which is incrediably different than corn (Actually Definition Copyed Below). Not to mention the website that gives it bad reviews and "flags" ingrediants goes on to explain that the red flags are Ok and a few are actually supplements with improve the over all wellness of the dog. Which this food actually contains added A and B vitamins for cocker spaniels ear, And extra Omega 6, 3 Fatty acids for their skin and coat. For those of you that have a cocker you know how hard it is to maintain healthy and clear ears and how easily it can be to get an ear infection. Over All One AmAzInG Food!<br /><br />Corn Gluten - that part of the commercial shelled corn that remains after the extraction of the larger portion of the starch, gluten, and term by the processes employed in the wet milling manufacture of corn starch or syrup.<br />In A Nut Shell Its The Middle (Digestiable) part of the corn removed from the shell. (Is not a cheap filler as alot more expensive to add than corn its self.)

review/summary: Terrible Food!
review/text: Beware if your Cocker is allergic to wheat or corn.  This food is full of grains that are known to cause allergies in dogs.  I bought this for my niece's Cocker Spaniel who has skin allergies.  Initially there was no problem and not only did the dog love the food, but so did the 3 cats in the household!  Within a couple weeks, however, the dogs allergies were back with a vengeance!  I believe RC just makes the food tasty to animals, but the nutrition is questionable.<br />I have tried Royal Canin cat food for my cat and she had the worst gas imaginable.  Switched her to Wellness and the problem cleared up.  Note the ingredients are not listed here on Amazon; look elsewhere for that on sites like dogfoodadvisor.com and you will find that Royal Canin foods in general do not get good grades.  There is much better food on the market for about the same price; Wellness, Blue Wilderness,Taste of the Wild to mention a few.  It's a great idea to develop breed specific food, but in the case of Royal Canin I believe it is nothing more than a marketing ploy.

It's a 6-pack of 25g bags, 150g TOTAL<br /><br />So you're getting about the equivalent of one bag of chips for your money. Still, not a terrible deal for something a little exotic.<br /><br />The chips themselves were good, though!

review/text: I ordered this product on Amazon to get some of the flavors we can't get in the US, namely, bacon, worcestershire, and prawn cocktail.  The photo of the product was so small and the description was so vague that I didn't realize until it came that what I was getting were actually 3 flavors of crisps that I can get down the street from my house:  cheddar cheese and onion, salt and vinegar, and regular flavor.  I was VERY disappointed.  Instead of trying again to order online, I will ask friends in the UK to shop and mail them for me.

review/summary: Great Popcorn
review/text: I found this stuff at WalMart. It was cheaper than my normal brand and the only brand they had in stock, so I tried it. I love it! Even better than other name brands. The Light Butter variety is perfect for my taste, and I like the fact that they use Canola oil which is more "heart healthy" than cocoanut oil or some of the oils used in other products. Was looking on-line since the last time I was in WalMart they were sold out. I think it is cheaper at WalMart, so I will keep looking there.  Highly recommend that popcorn lovers give this stuff a try.

review/summary: Very tasty and "Olivy"
review/text: I use a lot of olive oil and bought this to refill a previous smaller bottle of Baja. It has a pretty distinctive olive taste, which I like for salad dressings. Not too acidic.  It seems to have a high smoke point for use in frying. Good value for money. As usual for large bottles of oil: keep cool or in refrigerator and squeeze in a few capsules of Vitamin E to slow down oxidation and keep fresh.

review/summary: Been searching high and low!
review/text: A few years ago, I had a shrimp with squid ink pasta dish in Barcelona that has stuck with me so I have since that dinner vowed to replicate it in my kitchen.  Problem was that squid ink pasta was amazingly difficult to find... not even my specialty stores carried it so I turned to Amazon, which solves all my "I can't find it anywhere" problems.  I was a little skeptical having never ordered from Al Dente so I didn't want a sub par pasta to ruin this memory but I gave it a shot and as soon as the package arrived, I attempted my Barcelona culinary heaven... and it was everything I had remembered... a beautiful balance of flavor and color for a dish full of delicious and beauty!  For those who want to try it, here's the quick and dirty: fresh shrimp, shallots, garlic, cherry tomatoes, and a quality olive oil tossed with this pasta... you won't regret it!<br /><br />Happy cooking!

review/text: I disagree with other reviews that call this mushy. It cooked perfectly fine for me, but I followed the directions: brought water to a boil, and then cooked for 3 minutes. I served this with little tomatoes and asparagus (the red and green really popped against the black). One thing: it smelled a little fishy (?) when I strained it. However it tasted fine. We did not get a strong squid ink flavor.

review/summary: Good News- No Reflux, Bad News- Taste is Very Mediocre
review/text: This review is for the Vanilla flavored Puroast. First, I have to admit I'm not a coffee connoisseur, my favorite stuff is probably Dunkin Donuts Vanilla brewed at home.<br /><br />I have pretty severe reflux disease. At one point I had a choice between drinking coffee or sounding like I smoked eight thousand unfiltered cigarettes a day because of the hoarseness and wheeziness. For what it's worth, I chose to eliminate the coffee and keep my voice and lung capacity. Problem is, I love coffee both for the flavor and for the mood boost and, as my only vice, it was terribly hard to give up. I looked at a few options in low-acid coffees and went with Puroast for the good reviews on here and other sites.<br /><br />I'm not sure if the reviews lauding the flavor are planted or what, but this stuff tastes like watered down Folgers even when brewed strong. When I do brew it strong it's bitter and needs a lot of creamer and sugar. When I brew it in the coffee maker at home there is no intoxicating coffee aroma wafting through the house like you get with a normal coffee. I also don't feel a strong buzz when I drink it, but then again I don't, and I'm trying to be polite here, have the same sense of "urgency" to use the washroom afterward.<br /><br />Probably the biggest complaint I have is that the stuff simply does not taste like vanilla flavored coffee. Does not taste like it, does not smell like it. At all.<br />I don't know if this has anything to do with it, but the bags I bought simply had a "Vanilla" sticker on top of an old label that said "French Roast". Maybe they changed the contents along with the sticker but there is no real way of knowing as again, either the vanilla they put in is extremely weak, or they just sold me some old french roast tarted up as vanilla flavored.<br /><br />On the plus side, and this is a big plus in spite of my complaints, I can drink coffee again. I even tried the "acid test"; orange juice and two cups of this coffee in the same day. I had very minimal reflux and it was the orange juice. If this had been normal coffee I would have been doubled over with chest and gut pain and would have sounded like a wizened female truck driver the next day. I have been drinking at least a cup of this stuff a day for over a week and have not had an episode. This is a notable difference for me.<br /><br />In summation, if you have reflux and are craving coffee, give this stuff a shot. It's not perfect in flavor, doesn't provide a great buzz, but it's coffee and you can drink it without killing your insides.<br /><br />I hope this review helps someone.

review/text: What other yummy snack has no added sugar, 100% natural, stays fresh in storage, convenient, no added colors, no preservatives, not messy for kids and is fun to crunch? Whether you like this flavor or not, freeze dried fruit is where it is at. Compared to dehydrated, it locks in more fresh flavor and nutrients. Try different freeze dried fruits and find what works for you. I personally enjoy the funky sour flavor of pineapple with lime but you won't know until you crunch one.

(For you quumquats, the lime juice/acidic keeps the nice pineapple from turning brown and is a great preservative.) There is just a hint of lime and a strong pineapple flavor.  It is sweet, but naturally so!  I have this with my oatmeal in the morning and think of Hawaii!!  I went ahead and subscribed for the monthly shipment for the Jive A Lime and hope I don't run out!!

It may be better if your Keurig can be set to brew a small cup size...ours is fixed at roughly 8 oz.<br /><br />I personally prefer:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0IZBW">Timothy's World Coffee, Rainforest Decaf Espresso Extra-Bold for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>,<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFT88">Coffee People Extra Bold French Roast Decaf for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a> and<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0GVAO">Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf Coffee for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a> for decaf coffee.<br /><br />For caffeinated, I like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L444OQ">Coffee People Organic, Extra Bold K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>],<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GQ220I">Coffee People Santa's Buzz K-Cup for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups</a> (when it's available), or<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0IZBM">Emeril's Big Easy Bold Coffee for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>.<br /><br />I think all six have much better flavor than Tully's French Roast.

review/summary: My Favorite Decaf
review/text: This is my favorite decaf, after trying several. It has a very rich and full bodied flavor. I can dilute it with the 7 oz size drink on my Keurig and it is still a great rich cup of coffee.

review/summary: My favorite
review/text: I have decided that Tully's coffee is my favorite.  Their decaf is smooth and full flavored - no bite like I seem to get from Emeril and Newman.  Will buy again. I also love my Keurig - but its brain seems to be having trouble deciding how much coffee needs to go in the cup.  Quirky - yet worth the fiddling.

review/summary: Cant believe its decaf!!
review/text: I am a strictly caffeine free coffee drinker. I have tried many different brands. Green Mt., Timothy's, etc...This is one of my favorites. It has a very strong yet smooth flavor. Most Decaf brands are on the weak side. I do not have to sacrifice flavor with Tully's.

review/text: If you enjoy your coffee on the stronger side, try this one.  The taste is bold without some of the bitterness or bite that you find in other dark coffees.

review/text: Of all the K-Cups, decaf, that we have tried this is our favorite.  We use about 40 per month so automatic delivery really works well for us and we save an additional amount.

review/summary: Tully's decaffeinated coffee
review/text: Having tasted numerous coffees in the "K" cup design and suffered through diluted, bitter tasteless coffee, this French Roast  from Tully is really hard to distinguish from non-decaf coffee.  I drink between 6-8 cups a day, and I'm pretty finicky as to what I drink.  Frankly, I could drink this all the time and not suspect it's decaf. I like the aroma as it's brewing and the taste which calls for two cups instead of one!!  You can't go wrong trying this coffee and I think you will like it.

review/summary: A decaf that's really good!
review/text: I'm a fan of Tully's in my Keurig, and coming up with an evening brew has rounded out the single cup beauty of the machine.  If you like the "medium roast" type of coffees, this one will please, as you hardly notice any difference in flavor except that you know that only the caffeine is missing.  It's really nice to enjoy a late night brew without the fear of a sleepless night.  Good, smooth, bold flavor, one of the best I have tried so far.  Amazon service is great as always.  The double pack saves money, and stocks the shelf as well.  I'll reorder when the first box is gone, its that good.

review/text: I'm not a big fan of this coffee.  It has a slightly bitter flavor as well as the proverbial decaf after-taste, so I won't order again.

review/summary: Tully's French Roast Decaf
review/text: I was thrilled to find Tully's French Roast Decaf back in stock through Amazon.  In my opinion, it is better than Starbucks.  I like rich, bold coffee, and Tully's has a smoother finish without leaving a bitter aftertaste.  The best decaf I've ever found!
