review/summary: THE BEST!
review/text: I have a dog who until we adopted her never had oral care,so her teeth were in bad shape. We brush her teeth every 3 weeks and give her 1 booda bone weekly . Not only are her teeth cleaner but some of the staining has gone away. Our vet told us that these are the best thing for her because they digest easily and do not contain plastics.

review/summary: Yummy in my tummy!!
review/text: What an amazing candy, all of the kosugai product are very good anyway but these are something I've never heard of before... WTF is a mangosteen?!, wow is all I can say, definitely the queen of fruit, wish I could actually try the real thing. At first I wasn't sure what to think, its was just so different, but after a few oh yeah definitely amazing!<br /><br />All of the Kosugai product are very high quality, the flavors are incredibly juicy and true to life, mainly because the actual fruit is a main ingredient, but its not anything like those 'fruit leathers' this is an actual candy, it is the closest thing to eating the actual fruit as it gets in terms of juiciness and flavor. I buy these all the time now, I love all the flavors, particularly the Mangosteen, Lychee, kiwi, and strawberry.

review/text: My husband is a gummy candy fanatic. I had bought this in the hopes of finding a new brand he enjoyed but neither of us were all that thrilled with this one. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't horrible by any means and we did eventually finish the bag, but we didn't love it enough to want to pay $6 for more. If you want to try something new, I would definitely recommend this but I think you can find much cheaper gummy candy around that taste the same if not better.

review/text: I saw a negative review for these candies and thought it was far too harsh<br />now i have never tasted fresh mangosteen so I cannot say wether this candy taste like it or not BUT as a candy in general it is not bad and certainly not disgusting.<br />the taste is very unique, sweet at first and bitter at end, its pleasant. I was skeptical to try them at first, but i am glad i did, they are like nothing i have tasted before, come in the most adorable heart shape, have a very unique chewy texture and best of all is that they all come individualy wraped :D<br />the taste is not very kid oriented and more for a mature sweet tooth. and it gives off a very fun sour scent<br />this product is great ... talking about them is really making me want one so I shall go treat myself right now.<br /><br />also buyer beware: they are pricy and should only be eaten in special occasions ^^

review/text: I have been buying the 100 calorie packets of almonds and walnuts and came across these on Amazon.  I had not seen these in the stores and was surprised I hadn't.  So I purchased some from Amazon and they are really, really good.  A nice even mixture of almonds and walnuts coated in a sugar and cinnamon glaze with a hint of apple flavoring. YUM!!  The packet is not small like the 100 calorie packs and this is a great pick me up in the afternoon to tide me over until dinner. A perfect size to put in your lunch or purse or even a gym bag.  I plan on buying more of the Walnuts and Almonds with the apple cinnamon glaze.

review/summary: Excellent Marinade
review/text: We have used Claude's brisket marinade and there is nothing better for brisket.  That experience made us want to try this Hickory Marinade.  We paid about $3.15 each for six bottles ($18.87).  We marinated a rib roast for about 10 hours then cooked it on a rotisserie to 133 degrees.  It was fantastic.  It did not overwhelm the flavor of the meat.  I highly recommend it.  However on the downside right after we purchased this product the price increased to about $6.29 each for six bottles ($37.69).  I don't know what could justify a 99.74% increase. Anyway if you can purchase this item at a decent price... it's well worth it.  You can go to Claudessauces.com and pay $4.56 per bottle including shipping but get 12 bottles.

review/text: I didn't buy this from Amazon, but I have bought this before. I use it for Cake Pops. It tastes better than the colored candy melts they sell at the stores and it hardens better too. The candy melts are hard to melt and stay chunky and clumpy making it necessary to add shortening. The shortening makes it harder for the candy to quickly dry and harden. It's also difficult to use edible markers on the candy melts because of the shortening (makes it oily).<br />With this almond bark, it melts down to a silky smooth consistency and you can write perfectly with edible markers. Also, the candy dries to a nice crunchy candy shell (the way it should be).

I make my espresso with a Jura Capresso super automatic machine- the warranty and instructions indicate you should not use oily beans. I won't buy this again as its bad for my machine.

review/summary: Kicking Horse Coffee - Cliff Hanger Espresso
review/text: First picked some of this up on a whim on the way back from a trip to Toronto.  So glad to see Amazon is carrying this as I wasn't sure when I'd have a chance to get some next.  I've found these beans require a less fine grind (using a KitchenAid Pro burr grinder and my Gaggia Baby) than my go-to espresso beans from my local roaster, and they seem to be especially forgiving if I'm rushing in the morning.  Overall, a really solid espresso blend leaning towards the milder side in terms of flavor.  Hope the bulk pouches are back in stock soon!

review/summary: Best Value Espresso Hands down
review/text: Oh my! After years of Lavazza, to which I have been devoted, flirtations with Illy, roasters in NYC, North Carolina, and beans shipped straight from the source, I've found a sane, balanced, bold, not bitter, full espresso coffee that is affordable and made by a smaller company. Amazing. It works in a stovetop coffee maker (Bialetti) and it is particularly gorgeous in my Delonghi 702, producing a rich crema, dense flavor, smooth. Wow. Oily beans? Well, I guess they are a little oily, but no more than a Lavazza, Gaggia, or Illy bean...  I've had NO trouble grinding (and I don't have a fancy burr grinder) to a mid-espresso grind, tamps well...it's running through the machine just fine...don't over grind or over tamp especially with an entry level 15BAR machine.<br /><br />Seriously, I just don't think it gets much better.

review/summary: Not medium, that's for sure
review/text: I'm assuming the "Medium" in the product label was supposed to indicate a medium roast. That, it certainly is not. This is a very-dark roast, very much like Starbucks. Now, this is nothing more than a personal preference but worthy reference point for others who have my coffee preferences: I hate super-dark coffee. Espresso or brewed. Starbucks has perfected that most disturbing ultra-dark-roast that tastes a bit less like coffee than it does, oh, the stuff that's left in a fire pit at the camp site after the fire has burnt itself out. Really, any kind of bean, seed, pine cone, or pulpy wood roasted to an appropriately unrecognizable state would produce a similar charcoal flavor (with a touch of lighter fluid?).<br /><br />Now that I've perhaps indicated how well-disposed I am towards super-dark-roast coffee, I have to say, this stuff is going for that reprehensible Starbucks recipe. "Carefully roast it until it's pitch black and the flavor is essentially unrecognizable as coffee, but still holds the coffee bean shape."<br /><br />I prefer mediums for espresso and medium or light for brewed coffee. I like the smell and flavor of the beans. The way the coffee actually smells when you're roasting it (I do roast my own from time to time). I like the COFFEE FLAVOR. Treat yourself and try it sometime. Very nutty and rich and warm... not acrid and bitter like this type. Try Illy medium-roast espresso as a point of reference for what great coffee should taste like.<br /><br />So there's my tuppence worth of product review. This is an ultra-dark espresso that's indistinguishable from Starbucks or any other roast that takes the same approach to roasting espresso beans. They all taste the same. Some might be cheaper, some might be more expensive, but this one is... that. Extremely dark and burnt-tasting when brewed. That fact could be good or bad, depending on your own preference for coffee!

review/text: Yummy. If it was any better, they'd have to make it illegal. I use a cuisinart home espresso machine with the average 15 bar pump. Nothing semi-pro or fancy about it. This espresso gives a decent layer of crema on top of my double shot. The beans are medium dark, and oily, but not overly so. The flavor is excellent, clean, acidic, bright. There is a nice tart bite at the back of the tongue.I make a tall capuccino (sort of a very short latte) with whole organic milk and microfoam. I haven't had a plain shot of the espresso because I don't usually drink it that way. Still, I am comparing the same style of drink that I always make with other brands of espresso beans. I'm very pleased! (I am a vine reviewer, but I bought this coffee and didn't receive it free for review).

review/text: This is very good dog food. I have a little background story, but the bottom line is that Lelu doesn't get sick of this stuff. Period.<br /><br />I try not to feed my dog pig products, but somehow there has been pig in all of the past foods ive bought only to find out later to my own dismay.<br /><br />But this time, I took Lelu to the pet store and let her sniff out the kibbles and after 2 rounds of sniffage, she preferred spots stew salmon, so i got it. I was amazed to also find out that she'd selected one without pig in the ingredients after i failed to notice it four times before.<br /><br />The kibble looks awesome and has these dried veggies in it. I would totally eat this stuff, but then again I am a college student--it would probably be an upgrade.<br /><br />It's been about 3 weeks and Lelu still eats this stuff as it is being poured which she never used to do to the other kibbles after the first meal.

review/text: I searched for nearly two years trying to find a healthy, tasty, dry dog food.  They were eating soft food and I was concerned about their teeth.  There are hundreds of promises out there but Spots Wild Salmon for small breeds is even better than hoped for.  If you have a finicky eater do try this brand.  My dogs were used to food I made from dark-meat turkey, brown rice, mushrooms (peeled and cleaned) and celery plus Wellness vitamins and minerals for dogs (per their Vet).  This was the only dry food (out of 6 we sampled) they actually beg for - every time.  An added benefit, none of the other dry food I tried for them helped with the dark eye-tearing marks.  After five weeks on the Spots they are both back to being totally white little dogs.

review/text: Halo is a good brand of dog food , my pug loves both the Salmon and the Chicken. She had looser stools with the Salmon , so I will probably put her back on the Chicken.  It has really healthy ingredients and I feel good about giving my girl this brand. I feed her half homemade food and half of the Halo. Halo in the morning , and homemade in the evening. She has a beautiful coat , shining eyes and is full of energy! Highly reccomended.

review/text: These paddywacks are actually dried pieces of buffalo neck meat.  Paddywack seems like a nicer name though, huh?  Regardless, they last longer than most chews, and my puppy loves them!  They have a slight smell, but they don't smell anywhere near as badly as bully sticks.  They also don't make her sick, like some other chews.  As soon as she sees me pull one of these out of the bag, she goes nuts.  They are great chews to keep her occupied, and are all-natural.  I highly recommend this brand!

review/text: I use this at hotel breakfasts all the time while traveling and the quality is great. So, I ordered them for myself to use at home for portion control.<br /><br />I received the shipment in a timely manner but in all the cups I have used so far, when I open the individual cup the oil is sitting on top of the peanut butter, and the peanut butter is grainy.  If I stir it up it becomes very runny and not easy to spread.  So then I pour the oil off and the peanut butter is very dry and hard to spread.<br /><br />I was very disappointed.<br /><br />Thank you.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YVGNFG">Heinz Peanut Butter Spread, 0.5-Ounce Cups (Pack of 100)</a>

Here is what they replied to me which immediately relieved my worries. They also sent me documentation of their checks on the products and pictures of the non-caged chickens.<br /><br />ello Karen,<br /><br />Thank You for contacting us here at DOGSWELL�.<br /><br />The DOGSWELL� manufacturing facilities meet the highest and most strict sanitary conditions.

We regularly visit our manufacturing facilities to ensure the quality and safety of our products.  We are always looking to bring the manufacturing over to the United States, we have just not found a supplier who will add all of the vitamins and nutrients that we want at a price the consumer is willing to pay, once we find one, we will definitely bring it back over to the US.<br /><br />We don't determine our source country for ingredients based solely on the country of origin; we find the best quality ingredient combined with the highest quality supplier and testing specifications and select them.

Please see attached for an example of test results for our treats; I have attached one of our VITALITY(tm) products that were tested recently.<br /><br />Our material suppliers are certified clean and clear of any contaminants. If raw ingredients do not meet their specifications and pass safety tests, then the ingredient is rejected immediately and never enters our processing facilities. Moreover, we strive to use products from suppliers that treat their animals humanely.  Please see attached for an image of our chickens in their barn.  I do not know of a reliable site that describes the process.<br /><br />Please know that we honestly believe that pets are family too and we feed our products to our own pets regularly.  Again, we test product from each batch that is produced and have never had our results come back positive for ANY harmful ingredients.<br /><br />Please don't hesitate to contact me with ANY questions.<br /><br />Thank You,<br /><br />Jeff<br /><br />Jeff Haluck<br /><br />Marketing Assistant

review/summary: DO NOT PURCHASE THESE STRIPS IF YOU WISH TO KEEP YOUR DOG ALIVE!!!
review/text: BUYER BEWARE! This caused severe intestinal bleeding and an inflamed stomach lining in two of my toy poodles who had to be taken emergency, to my nearest animal hospital! The vet bill cost me $1,200 for a $25 6 pack of death strips! I have the remaining 5 packs that are sealed and was going to return them to amazon, but they don't accept edibles..<br /><br />I always buy Mellow Mut and wanted to give these a try. I don't know what possessed me to switch, but I'm so sorry I did!!! They seemed a bit rough, like an old piece of leather, very coarse, not the usual kind of texture my dogs have been used to. I didn't think much of it at first, because they eat these types of treats all the time and they are supposed to be the ''nautral choice'' only healthful, not harmful! But, I never knew the damage they would cost my dogs. They began to become very listless after digestion, severe bloody vomit and explosive, watery diarrhea with blood followed, almost to the point of shock!!! I just got home from a long night at the hospital with them and they are in a very delicate state and still not in the clear. I have to return with them if the vomiting continues for futher investagation!<br /><br />I don't know what to expect in the next couple of hours! They are on very strong medications and must follow a very bland diet for three weeks that is, if no more complications arise! I pray my babies make a full recovery! I urged amazon to pull these off the website, before this tragedy occurs with another innocent life! They are poison for dogs, maybe this batch was just the contaminated one? Either way, you don't want to take that chance with your beloved pooch! Please stay away! I don't even care if I lost my money on this order, you can't put a price on your best friend! I just want everyone's dogs to be safe! Vitality brand dog strips are toxic!!!!<br /><br />P.S. I just found out Mellow Mut and Vitality dog chews are made in China and manufactured by the same company Dogswell! I will never EVER purchase their products again! I'm reporting them to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration!

review/summary: I gotta admit, these are great.
review/text: I first came across these while buying a variety of treats and toys for my new Australian Shepherd puppy. The lack of fillers and bad stuff, and very simple (essentials only) ingredients list was impressive.<br /><br />My dog loves these, and they have been very helpful for training purposes. As soon as he hears me open the bag, he comes and sits and waits in anticipation.<br /><br />They are slightly dry, which may account for some slight constipation, but like anything, treats should be given in small quantities and in moderation.<br /><br />My only real disappointment with these treats (and this apparently applies to all treats made by this company) is that they are made in China. While this isn't necessarily everything, if it were not for the great bullet point list of qualities these treats have, I would be looking for a US-manufactured product.<br /><br />It is my understanding (based on statements by Dogswell) that their China-based facilities are highly inspected, etc.  Hopefully, this is true, but there's no real way to know without flying to China to take a look.<br /><br />Either way, if Dogswell were to move its<br />Manufacturing to the US, and keep or even improve its standards, I would give these treats a 5+ rating, as the concept is really great, and my puppy loves them.<br /><br />Hopefully, the company will consider doing this soon.

review/text: At first, I was very hesitant to buy this treat for our dogs. I was expecting these to be hard, because they look very similar to the one I usually buy from PetSmart. The "hard" treat I'm used to break up in to tiny sharp pieces, and sometime choked our dogs making them cough up.<br /><br />However, I took a leap of faith based on the great reviews on Amazon and bought the Chicken Breast flavor.<br /><br />To my surprise, they were soft, and easy to bend and tear apart. The dogs seems to love them, and I was able to cut up 1 strip in to smaller bit-size to use them as a training incentive.<br /><br />They will do anything for this treat, so it's a great product to our dogs motivated to do tricks for treats.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

review/text: Dogswell Vitality Chicken Breast are healthy and tasty treats that are not just good for my dog, but she loves them. All I have to say is "chicken strips?" and she goes crazy for them. I also found that I could purchase this product on Amazon for half the price that I would pay in a pet store.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00141QYMC">Dogswell Vitality Chicken Breast, 5-Ounce Orange Pouches (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: My dogs love these!
review/text: These treats are an absolute MUST for my dogs. They would probably stop eating dog food if I gave them more of these, but one nice aspect of these treats is it tells you on the back how many they can have (by dog's weight) daily. My two toy poodles will do just about anything, including chewing the bag open for me, to get these. Except, maybe, eating their dog food dinner first. Dogswell has these treats for vitality, but it  also has these treats for arthritis and other problems too. And besides chicken, they also have duck breast, which my dogs are crazy about. It's so convenient to get them thru Amazon, too.

review/summary: 4.5 Stars: Healthy Treat with noticable benefits
review/text: I bought Dogswell Vitality for Dogs Chicken Breast for my finicky Boston Terrier after visiting my mom's and she gave him a dried chicken meat treat which he devoured. But I didn't like how brittle and hard the jerky treat was and made me concerned about him choking on it, even after breaking them into bite size pieces. I found Dogswell Vitality for Dogs at Target and gave it try after feeling through the bag that it wasn't as hard as the other dried meat treats with a slight bendable feel to it plus the disclaimer that the flaxseed and vitamins included helped dog's healthy eyes, skin and coat. The reason the disclaimer appealed to me is my dog has dry, flaky skin and occasionally gets dry patches.<br /><br />I have tried all types of shampoos, both prescribed by the vet and store bought, even RX fish oil pills from my vet, which I disliked giving my dog because I don't like putting pill in mouth daily since I couldn't trick him by putting it on his food. I can say none of them worked near as well as Dogswell Vitality for Dogs Chicken Breast for his skin problems.<br /><br />I've been given my dog, who weighs approx. 18 lbs., two to three strips a day broken into bite size pieces for nearly two months now. After about two weeks, I noticed the flaky dry skin scales weren't as noticeable and now it's barely noticeable at all. When I noticed the difference at two weeks I started ordering Dogswell Vitality for Dogs Chicken Breast through Amazon's Subscribe and Save program because I knew this treat was going to be a regular part of my dog's daily meal plan going forward and the program helps cut the cost of these expensive dog treats.<br /><br />I do recommend in an additional to this treats zip bag, putting the treats in a second ziploc type bag to help keep the jerky strips from drying out further and loosing it small bit of moisture. I have found this keeps the jerky strips as moist as when you first open the bag. And even though these jerky treats aren't as brittle and hard as it's competitors, they are still brittle enough that I feel I need to break them into bite size pieces for my dog.

review/text: From :[..]<br />FDA issues health warning to veterinarians, pet owners about chicken jerky products from China<br />Nov 21, 2011<br />DVM NEWSMAGAZINE<br /><br />Rockville, Md. -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning to veterinarians and pet owners about chicken jerky products imported from China, after seeing an increase in dog illnesses over the last 12 months.<br /><br />The illnesses, attributed to consumption of chicken jerky products from China--also sold as chicken tenders, strips or treats--were reported to FDA by both veterinarians and pet owners.<br /><br />FDA first issued a cautionary warning about chicken jerky products in September 2007, and again in December 2008. Complaints dropped off in late 2009 and for most of 2010, FDA says, but the agency is once again seeing a rise in cases.<br /><br />The agency is advising consumers who feed their dogs chicken-jerky products to watch for these clinical signs:<br /><br />* decreased appetite,<br /><br />* decreased activity,<br /><br />* vomiting,<br /><br />* diarrhea (sometimes with blood),<br /><br />* increased water consumption,<br /><br />* and/or increased urination.<br /><br />If the dog shows any of these signs, FDA says pet owners should stop feeding the chicken-jerky product. Pet owners should also consult their veterinarian if signs are severe or persist for more than 24 hours, FDA says.<br /><br />Blood tests may indicate kidney failure (increased urea nitrogen and creatinine). Urine tests may indicate Fanconi syndrome (increased glucose). Although most dogs appear to recover, some adverse event reports have involved mortality.<br /><br />FDA says it is working with several animal health diagnostic laboratories to determine why the products are causing illness. Despite extensive chemical and microbial testing, FDA adds it has not been able to identify a contaminant yet.<br /><br />FDA is also asking veterinarians to report cases of animal illness associated with pet foods to the FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinator in their state or Click here<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:I've been awarding this "Chicken Breast, Flaxseed & Vitamins" strip of chicken jerky to my 25 pound mixed breed dog for over a year without any problem. In fact, this is her favorite dog food treat, valued almost as high as freshly cooked chicken or sliced Swiss cheese. The instructions say she can have up to two a day and if it were up to her, she would happily devour the entire bag (including much of the packaging).

review/summary: FDA says pet death toll from jerky treats now at 360
review/text: Dogswell jerky treat come China.  They are not safe.  I've had a subscribe and save subscription for the product, but I've calcelled after reading this story from September 15, 2012.  (Just search for the article's title, which is the same as my review.)<br />----<br />The FDA now says 350 dogs and one cat have died in the last 18 months, reportedly after eating chicken jerky treats made in China.<br /><br />An FDA report released this week says they've received 2,200 reports of illnesses linked to the treats - the deaths are included in that number. There is no geographic pattern to the illnesses and deaths - cases have been reported from all 50 states and 6 Canadian provinces.<br /><br />The FDA says the majority of complaints involve chicken jerky (treats, tenders, and strips), but others include duck, sweet potato, and treats where chicken or duck jerky is wrapped around dried fruits, sweet potatoes, or yams.<br /><br />The report goes on to say that in the past 10 years, there has been a dramatic increase in importation of pet food from China. It is estimated that nearly 86 million pounds of pet food came from China in 2011. Pet treats, including jerky pet treats, are currently considered the fastest growing segment in the pet food market.<br /><br />The FDA has been investigating the reports of illnesses, but no definitive cause has been determined.<br /><br />"The ongoing global investigation is complex, multifaceted and includes a wide variety of experts at the FDA including toxicologists, epidemiologists, veterinary researchers, forensic chemists, microbiologists, field investigators and senior agency officials," the report says.<br /><br />The FDA says product samples have been tested for contaminants known to cause the symptoms and illnesses reported in pets, and they are now expanding testing to include irradiation byproducts and they are consulting with NASA experts about it.<br /><br />In their report, the FDA says jerky treats are not necessary for pets to have a balanced diet - basically advising people not to feed them to their pets. But if you choose to give your pet the treats,  watch them closely for any or all of the following signs that may occur within hours to days of feeding the products: decreased appetite; decreased activity; vomiting; diarrhea, sometimes with blood; increased water consumption and/or increased urination.

review/summary: Dogs FAVORITE treats - stinks that they are sourced from China!
review/text: Far and away these are my dogs favorite treats - and I've always liked the fact that it's really just pure jerky with a few added beneficial ingredients. She really loves the "Duck" Happy Hips the most for whatever reason, but she also likes the Chicken Vitality Treats and sometimes the Chicken Happy Hips.<br /><br /> She started eating these intially (when I first brought her home) because my local Safeway used to sell them at a decent price buy one, get one free. I would stockpile like crazy whenever they went on sale and as she got pickier and pickier as she got healthier these remained one of the few treats she would eat.<br /><br />Unfortunately I know that "free range" chicken (or duck, or any poultry, really) doesn't mean a thing as the requirements for a farm to be called free range are not stringent at all. Pretty much they will pile them up on top of each other but so long as they can "touch the ground" (not in cages) it's "free range." (Ugh, now I remember why I've been a vegetarian for 15+ years....)<br /><br />I have heard of a number of issues with the jerky chicken treats sourced from China and I keep closely monitoring her for any changes; in the interim I limit the amount of treats she gets anyway and the air dried raw food she eats is sourced from New Zealand. Hopefully I will eventually be able to find something to replace these with, but until then I'm fairly confident about them.<br /><br />After all, I feel better feeding these even if they ARE sourced from China because they are (at least) not irridiated and I feel better feeding these than the biscuit-style treats that have little nutriotional value.<br /><br />Unfortunately my Safeways finally stopped their buy-1 get-1 sales and raised their prices accordingly so I started orderign online via Amazon. I'm cautious whenever I open a new package of ANY kind of treats so I really like the fact that I now buy the larger packages for "bulk" discounts. It means I am using the same bags longer.<br /><br />Of course not all treats are for all dogs, and if I was starting from scratch I'd probably avoid feeding her these. (I really like Jones Natural Chews and would love to try their USA-sourced jerky) However, considering I'm on a very tight budget at the moment and she is picky beyond belief I have to made do.

review/text: Enough of these misinformation.<br /><br />The FDA has investigated this product since 2007 and have not found any problems with the product.  FDA recently issued updated report dated 3/9/2012.<br /><br />Google:<br />"Questions and Answers Regarding Chicken Jerky Treats from China" by March 9, 2012 issued by FDA<br /><br />"<br />What is FDA testing for?<br />Since 2007, FDA has been actively investigating the cause of illness in pets reported in association with the consumption of chicken jerky products. Samples have been tested by FDA laboratories, by the Veterinary Laboratory Response Network (Vet-LRN), and by other animal health diagnostic laboratories in the U.S for multiple chemical and microbiological contaminants.<br />Product samples were tested for Salmonella, metals, furans, pesticides, antibiotics, mycotoxins, rodenticides, nephrotoxins (such as aristolochic acid, maleic acid, paraquat, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, toxic hydrocarbons, melamine and related triazines) and were screened for other chemicals and poisonous compounds. DNA verification was conducted on these samples to confirm the presence of poultry in the treats. Samples have also been submitted for nutritional composition (which includes glycerol concentrations), vitamin D excess and enterotoxin analysis. Some samples from recent cases (2011-2012) have been submitted for multiple tests and we are awaiting results. More samples are in the process of being collected for testing.<br /><br />What are the results of testing?<br />Samples collected from all over the United States have been tested for a wide variety of substances and to date, scientists have not been able to determine a definitive cause for the reported illnesses.<br /><br />Has there been any indication that metal contamination in chicken jerky products may be the cause of illness in dogs?"<br />FDA's previous testing of chicken jerky product samples did not show toxic levels of metals. In addition, results from March 2012 toxic metal analyses, which included tests for heavy metals, have again shown samples of chicken jerky products to be negative for toxic metals.<br />"<br /><br />Amazon,  please continue sale of this product.  I have been a loyal buyer for the past 4 years and this has consistently been her favourite treat, second only to home-made Chicken Jerky fresh from the oven.

review/summary: Your dog will love these!
review/text: My dog got hooked on these pretty young, and now they're the only "treat" he'll eat. My mom had been giving them to her dog, and when he stayed over there he got a taste of them and went crazy. They seem to be relatively healthy, and we can make them last a long time. My dog is a wanderer, and the best way we've found to keep him close, is to give him a piece of one of these when we whistle and he comes home. Since we've gotten him trained, he always comes back to a whistle. He's a small dog so we usually only give him about 1/3 of one of these, and one bag will last us a month. If you do the subscription plan with Amazon, the price ends up being very reasonable.

She looked pitiful when I got her. She had never had a treat of any kind, but soon understood what it was. These Dogswell Vitality treats with Flaxseed and Vitamins have contributed to transforming her (Brees) coat and skin. She looks beautiful now. I like that this treat has no added hormones, no fillers and no byproducts.  The only downside is that it is made in China.

review/text: My beloved black Lab recently experienced liver failure. The vet said he was 24 hours away from death.  At the time he was eating the Dogswell Vitality Chicken<br />strips as a treats.  Though it would be impossible to say that these treats caused the problem, I would proceed with caution.  If it does not say that the product ingredients come from the USA and that the product is also made in the USA, I no longer buy it.  I will pay more for a product made here rather than risk this happening again.  In all fairness, I cannot be 100% sure this product caused the problem.  All other food my dog gets is organic meats and vegetables that we eat as well. And we have had no liver problems. I will gladly pay more money for USA products that support USA jobs. Which is why I switched to the Colorado brand treats.

I tried other brands, but he didn't like them, so I know they are not all alike.<br />I decided to do the 3 month regular orders from Amazon, that way I won't forget and Max will be a very happy and healthy dog !!

review/summary: Inconsistent moisture content
review/text: We've been giving this treat to our little Yorkie for over two years and she absolutely loves them. However this is the second time we've had to arrange for a replacement shipment because the manufacturer isn't able to provide consistent quality. When ideal, the treats are moist and chewy, like jerky, but the treats in this last shipment were as hard as bricks...essentially devoid of any moisture. Our little dog knows what to do with them but it breaks our hearts watching her try to eat them.<br />I talked with the manufacturer the first time there was a problem. They were very apologetic and explained they were correcting the issue. Guess their old nemesis has returned. Amazon is also very nice about it and is replacing the most recent shipment at no additional charge. We'll have to see whether our dog can enjoy the replacement.

review/summary: A healthy treat that makes me feel like a good mom!!
review/text: These treats are absolutely wonderful.  When looking at all of the treats that are available in the supermarket, I can not bring myself to deny my puppy the taste or the nutrition that these treats offer.  Nothing compares!

review/summary: Should Be Zero Stars
review/text: This product is made in China. Although it is distributed by a company in the US, it states "Made In China." I see that nowhere listed on the ad to buy it and thinking I was doing my dog a favor, I did him harm; he has been ill for two days, after eating two of these "treats" when I received them two days ago. Because the label touts health and wholeness does not mean it is made by people with health in mind. It is made in China. The same nation which put melamine in food; melamine reads as protein in analysis of the food so it was a cheap and shameless method to advertise more protein while it caused misery and tears and death to countless. And this is an item Amazon does not accept as a return so purchase at your own (dog's) risk.

review/summary: DO NOT BUY
review/text: DO NOT BUY.... These are made in China!  I do not know if you have seen or read the recent information about dog treats (Chicken Jerky) that are made in China, but they are killing dogs.  I advise you to contact your vet if you do not believe me.  This company states right on their website that they get their treats from china, because they do not want to cause more waste.  I am sorry your company is called DOGSWELL!!!! If you cared about dogs well being then STOP getting your chicken from China and get it from somewhere safe in the US.<br /><br />They are only getting one star because it is needed to post a review.

review/summary: Made in China?!?!
review/text: Bought these at my local pet store not even thinking to look at where they're made (because everything in that place is usually super high quality stuff).  Came here to see what others think and that's when I saw the other reviews about being made in China - CAN NOT believe I bought these.  My dog has had one and now they're in the trash.  DO NOT give these to your dog!!!  0 stars

review/summary: I too, am justifiably wary of this MADE IN CHINA pet product!
review/text: I just purchased a bag of this Vitality Chicken Breast dog jerky product from a large national retailer today (I liked the natural, wholesome ingredients), and was VERY concerned and upset when I read that is is made in China. Given the many unecessary and unethical pet deaths that occured fairly recently due to melamine and other toxic ingredients in Chinese made pet products, my concern is quite legitimate and justifiable. You just don't know if you can trust any pet products from China anymore. And here I thought that I finally found a good, heatlhy, wholesome pet treat for my dog. I had to throw out the bag. Bummer.

review/summary: Danger in every bag.
review/text: Both my dogs love this product, but until the source changes from China I would recommend giving it a miss. Our precious pets deserve the best, and this is packaged and marketed like it is, but Chinese food products, and pet products in particular are potentially very dangerous.<br /><br />I threw out a half a bag when I read where it came from.

review/summary: MADE IN CHINA
review/text: Does anyone here really want to feed their dogs anything made in china????  I love my dog.  I would never do it.<br />I contacted Dogswell.<br />I've done hours of research on dog food.  Here is what I found.<br /><br />Australia is trying to break into our market with a dog food called ZIWI PEAK.  Check it out.  I can't imagine Australia wanting to kill our pets as china does. This food is supposed to be awesome.  It is not dry but dehydrated.<br /><br />Also Orijen and don't forget Wellness all made here in the good old USA.
