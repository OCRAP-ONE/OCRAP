review/text: Forgiven energy drink is a step above other energy drinks I have tried on the market, this drink has no after taste, no sudden jolt and jitter and no drastic let down. The taste is like no other and the price is more realistic then any other energy drink available. We are huge fans of this drink and happy to see that it is now available to purchase through Amazon, point click and drop it on my door, what a great idea. I can't wait until the other flavors are available on here too.

review/text: This is QEB Knewsome aka RaV from Philly and I was recently out in Los Angeles. While out there I got a chance to play ball wit the homies and I was introduced to FORGIVEN ENERGY. After playing all day in the hot sun, we were approached by a guy from FORGIVEN ENERGY and he offered us a sample and he then handed us a cold can. It tasted way better the Gatorade I had copped up before we got to the courts. I felt reenergized and ready to run a few more games. It truly blessed my path and fueled my soul. FORGIVEN ENERGY is what I'm sippin on now......

The packaging was awesome, way above the rest and the taste is AWSOME! It was much better then any other Energy drink I have tasted, it was clean, crisp and there was no gummy taste  when you drink it. Also I did not feel bloated and did not have a sugar crash. The pricing is much better then others and I think these guys are going to give Red Bull, Rockstar and Monster a run for their money! Highly Recommend!

review/summary: Howards Relishes are the Best
review/text: Am a New England Gal and have used Howard's relish for years on everything. It's one of the best on the market out there! Having looked in Arizona for it, none to be found anywhere, I used this relish on hot dogs, hamburgers, and lunch meat sandwiches.  I tried other "sweet pepper relishes", and unfortunately, none have stacked up to the one I loved and used for years... Howards.  Howards website will let you place orders, but they only take checks and it takes a lot longer to get your order. They also make other condiments that are great! The cost is high due to shipping charges from Hometown Favorites but it's based on weight. The cost is still around $4-$5/jar in the grocery stores back in Mass so when you do cost this product out with the shipping it does come to a hefty $8-$9/jar. I ordered enough to last me a bit but am glad to at least find it available on Amazon.  Now to find some good New England style Duck Sauce for Chinese food...

review/text: When I was a kid (no, I'm not going to tell you how long ago that was!!) we had steak relish with our grilled meat.  I remember it fondly and was hoping this relish would be similar.  Alas, it's not the same, but still very tasty.  It came very well packaged and arrived quickly.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because of the amount of high fructose corn syrup.  Although, I have to admit, it was almost impossible to read the list of ingredients written in incredibly small print on a shiny label.

review/summary: Good but could be much better
review/text: I grew up with this kind of relish in Massachusetts. We called it Piccalilli.<br />The brand we used was Cain's.<br />Howard's is good but it would be much better if they didn't use high fructose corn syrup which is an additive widely used that is destroying the health of many people (obesity, diabetes, high blood sugar). Also Xanthan gum gives it an unctuous almost greasy texture. Cain's never used these additives back then and I hope doesn't use them today. That brand is not available here in Florida unfortunately, otherwise I would but that in preference to Howard's.

review/summary: Too much grain, not enough meat
review/text: Just like the human food manufacturers, the pet food industry is also all about the<br />bottom line and cheapest manufacturing.<br /><br />While I can understand cost control, I can't understand the junk they are putting into our pets' foods.<br />Then again - they don't mind chemical cocktails in our human foods, so guess this doesn't bother them!<br /><br />I had given some thought to buying this food, at least for snacks, because it sounded like something<br />the cats would like. The commercials are certainly cute enough as well, and led me to at least look at the<br />product.<br /><br />Well, I won't be buying it at all.<br /><br />For those who are not aware, cats are carnivores. That means they mainly eat meats.<br />This does NOT include fish even, and it is a common misconception that all cats adore fish.<br />Not true (as any cat owner can tell you), and fish are also something that should be limited.<br />Cats need ZERO grain in their diets. They do not stalk the farmers' fields, pouncing on that low ear of corn<br />or stalk of wheat! They do not require it and it can cause health problems ranging from allergies to hot spots<br />on their skin to diabetes due to blood sugar issues with the high carb grains.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients for this product - they aren't listed here, I had to go to the manufacturer site<br />and look them up. Note how loaded with grain this product is - it might be okay for feeding a stray or some feral<br />cats who will supplement their own diets with mice, but for the average indoor housecat, it would be a mess.<br />Note the addition of not one, but FOUR named food dyes, many of which are already known to cause health problems<br />in people - why put it in our pet foods?! Lots of grain, meals (soybean hulls? really? cats don't need soy either),<br />and yuck, with a few vitamins tossed in to meet the minimum standards. It's like they use all the discards from<br />every other food process to make our pets' foods.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />Ground Yellow Corn, Corn Gluten Meal, Chicken By-Product Meal, Meat and Bone Meal, Beef Tallow Preserved W/Mixed-Tocopherols (Form of Vitamin E), Turkey By-Product Meal, Powdered Cellulose, Animal Liver Flavor, Soybean Hulls, Malt Extract, Phosphoric Acid, Salt, Dried Cheese Powder, Potassium Chloride, Choline Chloride, Added Color (Yellow 6, Yellow 5, Red 40, Blue 2 and Other Color), Parsley Flakes, Calcium Carbonate, Taurine, Zinc Sulfate, Ferrous Sulfate, Vitamin E Supplement, Niacin, Manganese Sulfate, Vitamin A Supplement, Calcium Pantothenate, Thiamine Mononitrate, Copper Sulfate, Riboflavin Supplement, Vitamin B-12 Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Folic Acid, Vitamin D-3 Supplement, Calcium Iodate, Biotin, Menadione Sodium Bisulfite Complex (Source of Vitamin K Activity), Sodium Selenite.<br /><br />They could do so much better by your pet.<br />So can you. I recommend passing on this grain filled food.

review/summary: LaChoy Beef Chow Mein - Disgusting Product
review/text: Years ago, when our family was younger and starting out, we usually purchased LaChoy products as a meal perhaps once a week. It actually was a pretty decent product. We hadn't bought any for quite some time now, as the family has their own families now but this past week (6/2012) my wife and I saw the familar bi-can products at the grocer, and decided to buy the Beef. I have never seen a product cheapen out quite like what we ate. The thick, rich, favorful sauce of the past has been replaced with some type of colored water, pretending to be gravy. Absolutely no favor to speak of. This meal was junk. A total disgrace for the company to pass off as food. I, like other reviewers I've read from, would update this review if I ever found the product improve, but... that will never happen as we'll never buy this product again.  All you companies out there that make changes to your products, water them down, modify the ingredents, etc. to maintain high profits, at the expense of peddling a cheaper product to your consumers, we hope you lose all your business. It takes a long time to develop a product following.  It only takes one incident of eating junk to stop the purchases forever.

review/summary: A Rose By Any Other Name . . . .
review/text: ....is just as delicious!  When I was a kid, these were sold as Scooter Pies.  I believe Moon Pies was the original name, but locally (New Jersey) these were branded as Scooter Pies, named after NY Yankee shortstop Phil Rizzuto, who was nicknamed "The Scooter."<br /><br />Whatever their naming legacy, these are every bit as delicious as I remember as a child.  Coated in sweet chocolate on the outside, soft graham cracker like "pies" on the inside, layered with soft, gooey marshmallow.<br /><br />These are pretty large by today's standards, so one is plenty as a snack, and some kids may be fine with half of a "pie."  Each pie is 2.75 ounces, big enough to fill the palm/fingers of your hand.  They are NOT a healthy treat, at 300 calories each, and containing 7 grams of fat, 5 of which are saturated.  They have no trans fats.<br /><br />If you want to give your kids a taste of something you ate as a child, and give your taste buds a taste of nostalgia, try these!<br /><br />Whether you knew them as Moon Pies, Scooter Pies or something else, these are every bit as good as when you were a kid.

Less adventurous drinkers can add lots of milk or cream to this and still get a bold cup.<br /><br />It won't take the paint off the walls--unless you come over and let me make it.

review/summary: 3 out of 4 Paws
review/text: First Impression: The friendly folks over at "Exclusively Dog" heard about my website and sent me 5 of their products to test.<br />Let me just start off by saying that I Love how sweet all of these treats taste. Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4.

review/summary: Great Ham
review/text: I must admit to having some amount of reservations about ordering hams of any kind from Omaha Steaks.  After all, I had never seen Omaha Steaks ads for their hams or for any other food product except for their steaks.  The hams, all three me and my wife ordered, arrived within the scheduled time span.  Curiously, the instructions how to heat them up (they were already cooked and frozen) were not with the hams.  We called customer service and got the directions from a most nice rep.  Followed it and the hams came out just great.  No loss of moisture and our extended family enjoyed the hams very much for Easter.  We have no regrets and the price was actually cheaper than if we had gone to Honeybaked, about 6 miles from our home.  This included price plus delivery charge.  Would recommend these hams to any- and everyone.

review/summary: OMG, best x-mas ham ever
review/text: Was actually off from work x-mas and needed to feed my family so on a whim and going off of other reviews I dropped the $60 this spiral ham cost. At $8.57 a pound I was worried and having a ham delivered by mail worried me too. Our fellow Amazon customers reviews reassured me that it would all be OK. Well, my order arrived in 2 days plenty of time before the big day and still plenty of dry ice still in cooler to last another day. I cooked it as directed and served it to the hungry ones waiting. The ham was/is amazing. Not salty like most that you buy and seasoned/cured perfectly!! My 5 year old and 7 year old had seconds and I had fourths lol. I am a big fan of x-mas ham and would not be giving this review if unwarranted. BEST CHRISTMAS HAM EVER!!! Yes I said it.....

review/summary: Strange...
review/text: Let me just say that this tea is about average. I feel like the tea wasn't made to high standards, but then you have the fact that they're whole leaves. I think this creates a weird situation where you have a bad product of high quality. I'm a supertaster, so I will describe the product as best as I can. It has your typical oolong bass notes, but the higher notes are very grassy (sometimes oolong is sweet, bitter...etc etc etc, this is grassy). It has a fair balance between bitterness and boldness. Incase you aren't gathering what I'm trying to say... it's a very neutral flavor and doesn't really 'wow' me at all. The grassy flavor taste exactly like wheaties cereal (no frosted).... and that sounds stupid but when you try it you'll instantly make the connection.<br /><br />So, in conclusion it's a plain tea that I won't really hold up high on my tea shrines, but it does have one last unique quality. It taste odd, but I can't stop drinking it. It's like raman noodles... you never say "man I can sure go for some raman", but when you are actually eating raman you make sure you eat every last noodle. It's like that.<br /><br />12/10/11 EDIT: After drinking a few of these, I can say that it's a great tea to drink without anything added. I normally add sugar to most of my teas in some way or another (honey, sugar, guava), but I find that this tea is actually really good without anything added. I'm not going to officially change my 3 star rating, but I am tempted to bump it up to 4 stars.

review/summary: Kibble size - 8 lb. vs. 16 lb. bag
review/text: UPDATE: No word on the kibble size, however the 16 lb. size lasted about 6 - 7 weeks for my Westie. Then the remaining 1/4 bag turned moldy. If you have a small dog, stay with the 8 lb. bag!<br /><br />My 11 yr. old Westie loves this food. His breed suffers from skin issues. We see improvement with his skin, he's more lively - and he's definitely more enthusiastic about eating!<br /><br />I bought the 8 lb. bag to try it. This time I bought the 16 lb. bag. There's a big difference in the kibble size with the 16 lb. being not quite double - but significantly bigger. Westies are not big dogs. He's doing okay with it. I've contacted Laughing Dog to see if that's normal. I didn't see a difference in the product description or on the bag - unless I'm missing something.<br /><br />Anyway - great product! I feel better knowing he's getting good natural ingredients and extra nutrition.

review/summary: Gentlease has 1/5 the lactose of milk-based formula
review/text: A good way to start shopping for this product is to call Enfamil to see their current pricing, keeping in mind any differences in can size and number of cans in a case in the event that you might buy in bulk. I have purchased this product through Enfamil, Amazon and a few other places, always taking advantage of the best deals. I've purchased single cans of all types and cases too.<br /><br />Next... The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding until six months of age. But here in the U.S. after your 3 months maternity leave, are you able to pump enough and store in a refrigerator at work? And you might need formula anyway as we do. I mention this because some imply their formula is as good as human breast milk.<br /><br />We're blessed with twins. They started out colicky and we found that Nutramigen worked at that time. They got through that phase and we've been using Gentlease and solids. After they're a year old it will be all solids. Our pediatrician recommended Gentlease. It has 1/5 the lactose of milk-based formula.<br /><br />I really researched formulas. There are even organizations promoting the sale of human breast milk and there are organizations wanting to stop the sale of human breast milk for fear of health hazards that the FDA cannot control. No matter, those offering breast milk do so at prohibitively high prices - nothing charitable about it.<br /><br />All the brands that I've seen have DHA and ARA, nutrients found in breast milk that promote brain and eye development, iron which is necessary for growth and many more ingredients. The government requires them to have certain ingredients. The major brands do not seem highly differentiated to me except for their specialy models. Gentlease is one of those.<br /><br />Gentlease is one of the special formulas because it has a much lower amount of lactose as well as broken down proteins to make it easier to digest.<br /><br />The prices vary and so do the size of the cans and the number of cans in a case. Unfortunately, I haven't seen Gentlease in big cans at the big box stores. One can also check at the local pharmacy or grocery store for comparison purposes. Keep an eye out for coupons too. You've got to keep constant watch for the best price, and there have been times when the Amazon price prevails.

THEY ARE PERFECT for someone that likes a strong, bold, delicious cup of coffee (and not that mild brown water some others drink)!  If I could afford espresso all the time, I'd do that, but this is a very close second and the taste is consistent.  Not one ground has come through into the cup (whereas other k-cups do).

review/summary: Love the coffee but...
review/text: My wife and I love the Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic (Extra Bold) coffee and have been ordering it for our Keurig for months but have always purchased it in the smaller boxes (25 K-cups).  When we saw this box of 50 K-cups for about the same price per cup, we decided to order two and that way place fewer orders.<br /><br />However, we have thrown away more defective K-cups from this one box than we have from everything else we've purchased in the 6 months since we bought our Keurig machine.  And we have bought A LOT of coffee & tea, much of it from Green Mountain.  I don't know if its a problem at the factory or if its an issue with the packaging but 1/3 of the K-cups in the first box had to be thrown away.  Frankly, these things are too expensive to accept that kind of waste...not to mention the hassle of cleaning up the mess they make first thing in the morning when all I want to do is sit and enjoy a cup of coffee and wake up.<br /><br />I hope that its from the packaging (the K-cups are not as tightly packed and therefore get bounced around a lot more during shipping - I HOPE that's the root cause of the problem) and not an issue with manufacturing because I would HATE it if we had to stop buying Green Mountain products altogether. Dark Magic and Triple Black Diamond have become our two favorite coffees, replacing Newman's Own Special Blend. As it is, I will go back to ordering the smaller packages and hope that this solves the problem.<br /><br />I give the coffee five stars but only one for the packaging so I compromised by assigning 3 stars to this product.

review/text: Just finished off my first Amazon packaged (50 count) box, and am impressed with the quality of the k-cup (ZERO wasted cups - no cups with broken seals, and no cups that resulted in a cup full o' grounds).<br /><br />My 5-star rating comes with a caveat.  It's not the best coffee I've had, but it is very good.  I almost gave it 4 stars, but then realized that out of all the x-bold offerings I've tried (and I've tried quite a few), it's one of my favorites at its price point.  It is a good coffee with good, bold flavor... and I did just put in an order for a second box.  My favorite from Amazon was Coffee People's Oraganic x-bold coffee (yellow foil cap).  Not sure what happened to this one, but I only see it rarely, and then at a ridiculous price (just saw it at $99 for a 24 pack... that's over $4/k-cup!!).

A bit smoother than Green Mountain's Double Black Diamond but stronger and more complex than both Nantucket Blend and Newman's Own Bold, it is full bodied even when brewed on the 14 oz setting.  It is my first cup, make that mug, in the morning as I sit in my sunroom and watch the fox make tracks into the woods and the finches and cardinals arrive at the bird feeder.

review/text: I don't know that I've ever tried anything quite like this.  I like it though, although I probably wouldn't drink it every day.  I find it a little difficult to describe, but it's kind of like the difference between milk chocolate and dark chocolate, with the Dark Magic being the dark chocolate.  I intend to pick up a box for those days when I feel like something a little different.

review/summary: Dark Magic is a great cup of coffee
review/text: I am just 1 week into owning my Kuerig B60 and this was in the sample pack. When I brewed it up, coffee grounds were in the cup and I was hoping this was just one faulty package. It smelled so good and I didn't want to throw it out I strained it twice added my cream and it was really good! This was a keeper and I went back today after church to B3 with my 20% off coupon and purchased a box and promptly had a cup while I was preparing my lunch.  I determined I could buy 3 boxes-18 count each with coupons for $24.28 once I finish this box and the two others (French Roast and Butter Toffee) I bought at the time I purchased my Kuerig. Dark Magic along with French Roast are my morning travel mug brews, and I will usually finish the evening with a smooth Butter Toffee.<br /><br />Update 7/25/12: Dark Magic is the only K Cup I am drinking.Truly a great cup of coffee, I have a 10 oz travel mug on my morning commute and then a 6 oz in the evening either before or after dinner. At either amount and a little cream it taste great, not bitter or weak. Love it!!! New owners definitely want to register your Kuerig and receive the  buy 2 get 2 free k cup offer, I paid $29.68 for 4-(24)count Dark Magic k cups

review/text: Green Mountain Dark Magic is one of my favorite Keurig pods. I make the big cup, add 1/4 c. skim milk, 1/4 sugar free Vanilla Coffee Mate, 1 Sweet and Low, and it's still strong but delish--my version of a latte. And the price is great. A friend warned me to check the expiration date--mine had plenty of time left. All is good in my coffee world.

review/text: What a great purchase.  I was originally looking for the ice coffee k-cups but they are ridiculously expensive (I feel).  After reading that their is not much of a difference and I was most concerned of the "watered down" taste so I thought and "extra bold" strength would do the trick, which it did!!!! I will be buying more soon and in a larger quantity now that I know how well it works ;)p

review/summary: It is Extra Bold and Extra Acidic
review/text: I love bold, robust coffee and decided to purchase Green Mountain Dark Magic k-cups. Definitely a bold coffee, but so acidic it's not enjoyable. Severely disappointed in this coffee. Am trying other brands but because of this experience trying to steer clear of all coffees distributed by Green Mountain; and that's a shame because they offer so many choices. Money is too hard to come by to blow it on coffee you can't drink!

review/summary: Gave this a try after GMC Espresso Blend was discontinued...
review/text: I'm on the second k-cup in the box and find myself comparing it to Green Mountain Coffee Espresso Blend which I've been drinking for over a year now.  The box reads, "offers the rich aromatics and flavor qualities of espresso".  Even Keurig is recommending Dark Magic to those who previously purchased the Espresso Blend.  Another reviewer wrote this coffee was: "Strong but flat, lacking definition".  Well, it does taste watery compared to the espresso blend and lacks that burst of flavor in every sip.  I'm not a big coffee drinker but love making daily lattes and cappuccinos from my Green Mountain Espresso Blend and now Dark Magic coffee.  This coffee is barely acceptable for this purpose but it is acceptable for someone who likes a strong/bold cup of coffee.

I would recommend this but then again it's the matter of personal taste.

review/summary: Nice Bold Flavor
review/text: Not as strong/bold as I was expecting based on other reviews, but still a nice strong flavor when brewed at the standard 10oz setting. I like a nice strong cup of coffee, black. Dark Magic (Extra Bold) competes with Starbucks Verona and also Barista's Italian Roast for my "go to" morning coffee choice. If I was to rank these 3, I would say #1 Barista's Italian Roast, #2 Starbuck Verona, #3 Green Mt. Dark Magic. Emeril's Extra Bold dark roast is also a good choice.<br /><br />Costco (my local store) sells Starbuck Verona. My next purchase will probably be Barista's Italian... If I catch Dark Magic on sale, I may buy some more of that brand.<br /><br />I give it 8/10 on 1-10 scale. If you like strong coffee, you will probably like Dark Magic.

review/text: I've enjoyed the Dark Magic coffee and re-ordered several times.  What I like about it is the strong taste and dark roast.  This is definitely one that I brew on the biggest cup size (12oz on my unit).<br /><br />The only negative I have is the lingering flavor is not quite as good as some of my more favorite k-cups.  However, I still put this in my top 10 and will continue to order occasionally for variety's sake.<br /><br />Overall - I recommend this to anyone who likes a strong, dark brew.

If you are a fan of SB Verona than you should like this too. If you like Nantucket, Breakfast Blend or Coffee Shop it might be too bold for you. It's perfect for a 12oz cup or even a 14oz travel mug.

review/summary: Excellent dark coffee...
review/text: I think what I like about the Dark Magic blend is that it has a slight complexity in its flavor that isn't there in just regular "bold" or dark roast coffees, at least none of the k-cups I've tried.  Some people here and there insist that it's terrible, but I guess that's just how it goes with varying tastes.  It didn't come off to me to be over acidic or any of that stuff, and I'm usually pretty picky and sensitive about my coffee.  The flavor is definitely at its peak with an 8oz brew maximum, but you can still make 10-12oz cups without really losing much of the quality.  I love it.
