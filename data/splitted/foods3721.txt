review/summary: Coffee newbie loves it!
review/text: When I selected this, the description at the time did not say it was pods, or I would not have chosen it. I don't have a pod coffee maker (as much as I think they are adorable!)<br /><br />I just started drinking coffee beverages last year, I've always hated the taste of coffee but found I can stand it with cream and some flavored syrup (thanks McDonald's and Starbucks!). Cost being what it is, we started making these drinks at home, with coffee we bought at the store or Sam's. (Folgers and the like) So, since I'm a coffee newbie, I'm not up on all the varieties and tastes and roasts, and just thought that all coffee was the same.<br /><br />I brewed up a small batch of coffee in my pot, using one pod and 2 cups of water. I took a sip of the coffee before putting anything in it and I was shocked that I actually liked the taste of this. Normally coffee is so bitter and strong tasting to me, but this had a sweet floral-tinged taste to it. When I made my usual cream/syrup contribution to it, I found that the background taste was wonderful! It was so smooth and didn't have any kind of bitter aftertaste as I am accustomed to when making coffee.<br /><br />The package is pretty enough that you could give this as a gift to a coffee lover! I would serve this to company and be proud that it tastes better than the Folgers I normally have. This was a nice surprise, and opened up my taste buds to the possibility of better quality coffee than I am used to.

review/summary: Marley "One Love" organic coffee pods: Better than a cup from the donut shop
review/text: Marley "One Love" organic coffee pods are targeted at hip people who like Bob Marley, only need to brew one cup of coffee at a time, have pod-compatible coffee makers like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GW873G">Hamilton Beach Personal Cup One Cup Pod Brewer</a>, and prefer organic coffee for health reasons (no pesticides, more antioxidants), political reasons (you support the organic foods movement), or aesthetic reasons (no bad-tasting additives, you like the cool packaging). It is advertised as 100% Ethiopian Yirgacheffe coffee -- Yirgacheffe is a coffee-growing region in Ethiopia, and Ethiopian coffee in general is known for its fruity or wine-like notes.<br /><br />My impressions? Be warned that I am not a coffee connoisseur and I don't have a pod coffee maker. I brewed one cup in a mug in the microwave, which I subsequently turned into a reasonably satisfying cafe mocha. I cold-brewed several additional cups by letting pods soak in water for 18-24 hours (6oz water/pod), which I drank cold with ice, milk, and sugar. I found the cold-brewed iced coffees to be very tasty, clearly better than the cups I've made with the much-cheaper <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1KJO">Folgers Classic Roast Coffee Singles, 19-Count Single Servings (Pack of 6)</a> for example.<br /><br />Are the pods worth 67 cents apiece? Well, you're not going to find a better cup of coffee at the donut shop around the corner for 67 cents. Beyond that ... you're going to have to try it yourself.

review/summary: Okay, for a not very strong coffee
review/text: I like my coffee kind of medium, not too strong, not too weak, and these pods made fairly weak coffee.  I compare them to my own home made pods (using the "Ecopad"  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007INM5A/ref=oh_o01_s00_i00_details) which I use in my Senseo, and I was fairly disappointed.  It was easy to see that the Marley Coffee Pods made much weaker coffee (lighter color, almost watery appearance).  I think I will stick with my Ecopad coffee pods.<br /><br />Incidentally, I want to put in a good word here for the Senseo coffee maker.  It is great for making a single cup of coffee (or maybe even a few cups of coffee but not at the same time).  The Ecopad pods are just as economical as regular coffee (you just spoon ground coffee into the Ecopad and make coffee as usual).

review/text: I didn't realize this was a single brew coffee.  However, I cut open four of the filter packs and used it in my drip coffee maker.  It worked beautifully.  Delicious coffee!  Ahhhh....I love coffee.  I would compare the quality of taste to that of Starbuck's dark roast.  It may taste differently if used the intended way.<br />If you have a single brewer, this is definitely coffee you will want to try.  Or, if you're like me, I will be taking some of these individually wrapped foil pouches with me on my next trip.  They will work great in the hotel' room's coffee maker--You know, they never do give you enough coffee for those things.

review/summary: A Work of Art
review/text: The box containing Marley Coffee Single Serve Pods is exquisite -- a work of art. The description of the product is fascinating. There is one little problem though. Nowhere on the package or on the individual packets can I find instructions as to the way to use the product. I determined that information by experimentation.<br /><br />The square packets inside are also works of art. There is only one little problem with them: the absence of a notch in the edge to make it easy to tear the packet open. When I manage to open  a packet with a knife, the aroma takes me away. Every time I open one, the marvelous flavor makes me rush to make the coffee, which is as good as it smells.

review/summary: Surprisingly Good
review/text: So I must admit that when I ordered this coffee, I thought it was one of the new fancy instants like Starbucks now has.  When I got it and found that it was pods, for which I do not have a maker, I almost sent it back.  But what I wanted it for was those afternoon coffee emergencies at work, where single serves would be perfect. Soooo - I used one of the pods like a tea bag, steeped it in very hot water...and ended up with a great cup of coffee!<br /><br />The flavor is very rich and fruity - not over burnt or weak like I would have expected given my McGyver-type preparation.  I enjoyed the coffee a great deal and will keep this at my desk for more than just emergencies.

review/summary: Great Coffee (from a non-coffee drinker)!
review/text: I'll admit outright that I don't normally like coffee.  I'm a big drinker of hot tea though (and that's usually what I drink).  The only coffee I've ever had seemed terrible to me (then again, cheap crappy coffee probably really is terrible).  I wouldn't have normally ordered this, but the description sounded so nice and tasty that I decided to give it a try.  I went in not expecting to like it much though.<br /><br />So, I pulled out my boyfriend's tiny coffee pot to brew up some of this coffee.  The first thing that struck me as nice was that each packet of coffee is individually sealed, and each packet is contained in its own little filter (which is very convenient).  When I first brewed up a batch, I accidentally brewed it too weak (I made about 4 cups when the directions say to only make 1 cup).  I liked it a lot anyway; it reminded me of my favorite blend of carob tea.  To be fair to the coffee, though, I decided to brew it again following the directions properly.  It came out stronger (and I didn't enjoy the coffee bitterness as much) but it was still good.  I was able to drink it with only sugar and no creamer to dilute it's flavor.  I must say that in my limited experience, this is the best coffee I've ever tasted, but I think that I much prefer a light brew coffee.<br /><br />So, this is a great coffee for people who don't normally drink coffee.  Would a coffee lover actually enjoy it?  Well, if you like a really strong bitter coffee, then you really wouldn't care for this.  If you like a light or medium strength coffee, then you'll really love this one.  If you are just starting out with coffee drinking, this would be a good one to try out to ease you into it.  I liked it well enough that I'd even consider drinking it regularly along with my tea!  So, if any of this sounds appealing to you, go ahead and give it a try!

review/summary: Surprisingly good brew.
review/text: This coffee smells a bit like Starbuck's Breakfast Blend, but it doesn't taste anywhere near as strong which, in my opinion, is preferred.  There isn't, however, any guidance whatsover on the box regarding preparation.  Thus, when I made my first mug of Marley Coffee, I wasn't sure how much water I was supposed to use or how much time I was supposed to wait, so I chucked in two packets and let them steep for two minutes.  The result tasted fine; not the best I'd ever had, but good enough for a sample run.  My second go with the coffee was a bit more involved, but met with better brewing results.  My household had run out of ground coffee, so I cut open several Marley packets to use in our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002S4DI2S">Technivorm Moccamaster Coffee Brewer With Thermo Carafe - Technivorm 9587</a>.  I measured out coffee as I usually would with a scoop and brewed it up.  My wife and I both enjoyed the result.  I would get this product again.

review/summary: Best Pod Coffee I've tasted
review/text: Wasn't expecting much but these pods make smooth lattes. I used the pods in my Krups psuedo esspresso machine. They worked fine. The coffee came out great. Add some milk and froth it, and you have one smooth latte. No mess, easy clean up. The pods smell pretty strong when you open the individual packet so that's a good sign. I also made some for friends just using the pods like tea bags. They were happy and said it was smooth coffee. So you have several options how to use them. I just might be buying more though I am usually a grind my own beans kind of guy.

review/summary: made my Saturday morning.
review/text: I don't have a coffee maker that takes the individual little packages this comes in so I undid them and placed them as regular grounds in my regular coffee maker. Each portion was more than the spoonfull I might have used, very generous portion, and made a grea tasting smooth brew with just the right amount of bitternss that even my wife commented on the taste being "really good". I did the same on Sunday morning and diluted the amount to almost half strength and it still more than held its own as a great tasting brew. Don't know if I would use it as a replacement to the one I use consistently but would most definetly buy it as a replacement if I was unable to find my brand.

review/summary: Marley Coffee is tasty but needed a lot of trial and error to make it
review/text: I selected Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee, 15-Count based solely on a five sentence blurb in the amazon.com/VINE offering to me in its monthly newsletter to sample and to review. There were no instructions on how to prepare the brew. I did not worry. I expected the shipped coffee to contain enough instructions on arrival. It did not.<br /><br />If, however, I had gone to the non-VINE website of Amazon I would have received a clue how to brew the coffee: "Directions<br />For Use only in Single Serve Home Coffee Pod Brewers."<br /><br />I don't own a "single server home coffee pod brewer," so the test was going to prove difficult at best, although I did not think so at the time.<br /><br />Then came in the mail an attractively packaged, colorful cardboard box, full of small print texts extolling various aspects of the product with Lion of Judah logo, photo of a Rastafarian man and a statement from musician Bob Marley about how he had founded his organic coffee and tea company as a tribute to his father who had come from Nine Mile, Jamaica.<br /><br />Very instructive. But no brewing instructions anywhere. I scissored open the air-sealed plastic cover for one of the 15 small pods enclosed of ground coffee. No instructions.<br /><br />Here are the various ways I went about making Marley coffee:<br /><br />(1) Were these 15 like similar pods I had seen in motels with DIY coffee makers?Where you toss pods in a plastic  filter and add hot water into the back of the machine. Then throw a switch. Expect two cups of coffee to emerge. So I scissored open four plastic bags, detecting in the process a beyond faint aroma that I had years earlier come to associate with kidneys for breakfast in bed and breakfasts in Ireland. I tossed four pods into my Mr. Coffee Machine<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041847R4">Mr. Coffee CG12 12-Cup Switch Coffeemaker, White</a> and added enough water in my to make eight cups of coffee. No paper filter. Result: tasty, several ingredients detected. Very weak!<br /><br />(2) After discussion with my wife, I next decided to make a mere two cups of coffee using only two pods in Mr. Coffee, this time placing a paper filter beneath the pods. Same initial urine smell. Same good taste. Stronger.<br /><br />(3) Still my wife and I, in the absence of written instructions, decided there must be a simpler, cleaner way. We next treated a pod as if it were a single serving tea bag -- minus a string. We therefore put one pod in a coffee mug and poured boiling water over it. Same Irish kidneys smell. Decent taste when done. Rather a mess, however, fishing out the pod with a spoon.<br /><br />Bottom line: even when weak, Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee, 15-Count offered a strikingly better than average taste. I would drink it again if only I had the right equipment.<br /><br />-OOO-

review/text: This coffee is good, and because it is organic, it is worth the price. It's got a nice, round flavor but could stand to be a little more robust. The pods of course are ultra convenient, but I would quibble with the fact that the individual pouches do NOT have a notch in them for easy opening. I have to cut each pouch with a pair of scissors.

review/summary: Nutty and Intense
review/text: First impressions of this coffee was not positive as the box contains no instructions what-so-ever as to what kind of coffee-maker is required for these pods. Additionally there is no mention of how much water to use with each pod, or whether it is a single or four cup serving.<br /><br />HOWEVER... Once that was settled (It is recommended between 6oz and 8oz of water per pod and it can be used in any traditional drip coffee machine, or used in the same fashion as a tea bag)... I was ultimately surprised and delighted at how dark and rich the resulting coffee looked. I brewed it at full strength the first time, to see what its got. I don't normally like my coffee super strong, but I was overwhelmed with the delicious aroma of this product. The first waft was clearly rich and nutty, although the packaging says exotic floral and berry. The taste was beyond anything I could hope for. I was shocked at how much flavor this coffee contained since it is also very smooth without being bitter. The second time I brewed this coffee, using the tea bag method and hot water, I actually let it soak until I was finished dressing for work, so around 15 minutes or so. Keep in mind I do not usually care for coffee that is overpoweringly strong, but the addition time only created a more intense flavor and aroma which, after only two experiences with it, I found myself craving a repeat experience. I added a little Splenda and plain creamer to it and rather than masking the flavor, the coffee-nutty-berry flavor came through with perfection.<br /><br />All in all I would say this coffee has performed better than any other brand of coffee I have had my hands on in the last year or two... which is saying something since I am considered fairly obsessed with quality coffee. The price is around sixty-three cents per cup and is MORE than worth it!!

review/summary: Good if you like Coffee
review/text: This coffee is moderate in flavor (not to weak, not too strong) and I would recommend it to coffee drinkers who want a flavor in that range. It is "coffee flavored coffee", in other words, no fancy flavoring. Being organic, it is (hopefully) sans all of the nasty chemicals that tend to get added. I want to note I used it unconventionally. I cut the packets open and ran it through a regular coffee maker. Five packets for a 12 cup pot. Came out just fine doing that. If you're looking for organic coffee, this one will do nicely.<br /><br />My only real issue is the packets do not have an easy open to get the little coffee bag out. I had to use scissors. That might make you mad if you're jonesing for that cup of coffee to wake up in the morning.

review/summary: Coffee good. Packaging not.
review/text: When I chose the Marley Coffee and Tea One Love coffee, I did not realize they came in "pods". (I don't even know what a pod brewer is and wikipedia was no help.) The box containing the coffee does not have any instructions as to how to brew the pod. When I researched the Marley website, it referred only to pod brewing. So, with only an espresso machine in my possession, I decided to be inventive and brew the pods that way.<br /><br />I like my coffee STRONG, and I found that 1 pod was too weak for my usual morning cup. If I can see through the coffee, it's not strong enough. Two pods are perfect; I just jam both into the ground holder. The taste is smooth, dark, slightly bitter, but still enjoyable and makes for a nice caffeine buzz. It's 100% organic and Fair Trade-very important to me. With the grounds contained in pods, it is easier to remove and keep the ground holder clean.<br /><br />The downside of the pod coffee is the separate foil packaging for each individual pod. I would prefer it packaged as a group in the box, like tea bags. However, the company does offer bags of beans which I find more preferable than ground coffee in a pod.

review/summary: Pretty good, if you have the right brewer
review/text: I'm not a coffee connoisseur, but I do enjoy a good cup of coffee (with creamer) every now and then.  While I did not like the aroma of the organic coffee pod straight out of the foil pack (the box says it is 'Exotic Floral and Berry' whatever that is), I did enjoy the taste of the brewed coffee, once I figured out how to brew it.  Like others, I was unaware these were for 'pod' brewers, although this has been since updated to state in the product description.<br /><br />In fact, the box has NO instructions whatsoever.  I had to come back to Amazon to find out about using 8oz of water per cup.  A little less Marley/Jamacia on the box, and a few more instructions would be helpful.<br /><br />Since I don't own a pod brewer, I tried using a pod in my 'cup at a time' brewer.  All I got was slightly flavored hot water.  Not recommended.  Next I tried brewing one directly in a cup by adding boiling water.  While I got flavor, I also got sediment and aftertaste.  Again, not the recommended method.  Finally, I tried snipping open a pod and just using the loose grounds in my 'cup at a time' brewer with a standard paper filter.  I realize this is not the way the manufacture intended their product to be used, but as I said, since I was unaware this product was for 'pod' coffee makers, it was the best I had to work with.<br /><br />At last, I got to taste Marley's Organic Coffee in a good way.  Overall, I did like the taste (I drink mine with creamer).  Although I have to admit that I would not buy these at such a high price for just 15 cups of coffee.  Maybe if I had a pod brewer, I would.  But I really don't taste that much different to any other cup of good coffee.  As I said, I am not a coffee connoisseur, just someone who enjoys a good cup on occasion.<br /><br />This box of Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee includes 15 individually foil wrapped coffee pods, so that each cup will be as fresh as the last.

review/summary: Good smooth coffee for the right machine
review/text: My husband and I both enjoyed this coffee, it was smooth and easy to drink. I especially enjoyed it with a little bit of almond milk, it was perfect. I'm usually not much of a coffee drinker, I need it sweet or extremely smooth, so I was happy to find that this coffee was not as bitter as most. For those who need a nice, fresh easy coffee, I think this is perfect.<br /><br />It's important to note that these packets are for pod brewers, not your regular 8-10 cup coffee maker. They come conveniently packaged and my first thought upon opening them was that they're perfect for the small business! Hotels, bed & breakfasts, small offices, etc would all love this style of coffee that is convenient and individually made. I would definitely recommend it for someone in need of a good coffee for use at their small business. But also if you're a 1-cup a day sort of drinker, or someone who occasionally likes to make a very small pot of coffee--this is the perfect set up for you!

review/summary: I had to improvise but I LOVED it
review/text: By improvising I mean that I have no coffeemaker other than my humble gold mesh basket that fits into a cup. So I put the pod into the bottom of the basket, added a little water to pre-prime it -- and then added hot water. With a soup spoon I imitated the process that a coffeemaker that uses pods would do: I pressed the spoon into the pod several times, and VOILA!! A WONDERFUL brew emerged in the cup. I enjoyed a cuppa with NO residual stomach acid and no bitterness -- I didn't even need sugar. Later, I added some soy milk and the taste was just as enjoyable.<br /><br />I liked reading the dedication on the box. This coffee was grown with care, and lovingly dedicated to an incredible individual, Bob Marley.<br /><br />Even though I will continue to have to improvise when brewing this coffee, I look forward to enjoying every single pod.

review/summary: OK coffee, but there are better alternatives
review/text: I like to experiment with different coffee, and these pods seemed to be nice to try on my pod machine. However, I found them not exceptionally good, and not a better value than some of the Senseo ones.<br /><br />The coffee itself it OK. It's not too bitter, and not too light. However it leaves a sour aftertaste. It's organic, which means, it's not from an acidic preservative they add, but probably the coffee itself contains this sourness.<br /><br />And also the pod size is interesting. They seem to be 1.5 the size of the other pods I have, and it difficult to have the right amount of water. The  (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QTVS5K">Senseo machine I have</a>) has two options, single pod (8 oz), or double (16 oz). Neither fits these pods well. I compensate the difference by changing the amount of cream I use, but it would be better to have the right amount in the first place.<br /><br />While it's better than some Senseo pods, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001ES9FI">Senseo Dark Roast</a> -- which I find "burnt", and bitter, it's still inferior to many others (for example <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XZMD2G">Senseo Kona Pack of 4</a>. And the 4 pack offers better value per pod (even if I use double in a single cup), so there is little reason to prefer these over what I'm already used to at the moment.<br /><br />Unfortunately experimenting with these coffee did not end well. They are not better tasting than regular Senseo pods, they have a bitter after taste, the size is not right, and the price per pod is not as cost effective. It still is OK coffee, so I'm rating them 3/5 stars.

review/summary: Good coffee, good price, NOT for a Keurig!
review/text: First, I have to admit that when I was offered this coffee to review, I saw that there were 15 single serve pods and assumed that meant it was for a Keurig. Not so. Apparently there are actual coffeemakers that take these pods. Duh.<br /><br />I received them and had to do a bit of maneuvering to actually USE them, but it worked out fine. I just cut open the pod and put the coffee into one of my reusable Keurig cups and it brewed perfectly. I would imagine they would also work well in the proper machine ;)<br /><br />The coffee itself is a tad more bitter than I normally like, but that's just my own taste. I was able to try the medium roast, so I would personally go for the light, if possible. The flavor is great and I absolutely love that it's Fair Trade Certified, Organic, AND that partial sales are put towards youth soccer programs (kicksforcause.org). I love me some Dunkin Donuts coffee, but they are definitely not fair trade, organic, or donating any of their money.<br /><br />The packaging is perfect for the pods and the box is actually quite attractive.<br /><br />If you have a pod coffeemaker, I would definitely recommend this coffee for it's taste and the company's moral values. If you're buying pods anyways, you might as well make it from a company that offers portions of their money to charity and pays it's workers well!<br /><br />I was impressed!

review/summary: "Get Up, Stand Up, Stand Up For Your Coffee"
review/text: Bob Marley's son Rohan, besides being a noted athlete and musician, is also a successful entrepreneur, having started "Marley Coffee," the maker of "Marley Coffee, Stir It Up, Exotic Floral and Berry, One Love, Organic Medium Ethiopia Yirgacheffee," (fifteen single serve pods).<br /><br />Everyone in my family tried some of the coffee this morning and the results were generally very good; "smooth" x3, "nutty," x2, "nice taste," "I like mine a little stronger."  Pretty good comments from these life long coffee drinkers.  No one gushed that they were going to rush out and place another order, however.<br /><br />Bob Marley's name has been used to sell lots of things Bob probably wouldn't have endorsed while he was alive. To his credit, Rohan's signature actually appears on the outside of the box, so he is not technically appropriating his father's name.  He is asserting his own name and standing behind the product himself.<br /><br />Several of the drinker's this morning were hoping for a little THC mellow-out over their bacon and eggs.  Didn't happen.  However, everyone agreed that this coffee (which curiously doesn't smell that attractive before the pod is brewed) is worthy of the high-end packaging and its Ethiopian (and Jamacian) heritage.

review/summary: rich and smooth coffee
review/text: Marley Coffee in individual cup pods is something new for me. I have a DeLonge espresso maker with the feature to use it with coffee pods. So my review is based on using this device to make the Marley coffee. I made very large cups of coffee and tried them with cream and sweetener (stevia or agave)and also just black. I generally drink coffee with half and half with or without a sweetener. Marley coffee could be compared to a strong brew of coffee house coffee such as Caribou but without the bitter taste or the hollow taste I find in many of the coffee house brews. The Marley coffee is very strong with that tingling sensation in the mouth but does not have the bitter taste. It is very rich and smooth. This is one of the few coffees that I would likely drink black because it lacks the bitterness but has a strong flavor. It is very likely the best coffee I have ever tasted. It is not cheap. At about 75 cents a cup, it is for me not an option to drink several each day. I strongly and smoothly recommend this product.

review/summary: Good coffee, but no directions for use or preparation.
review/text: I ordered these thinking they were an instant single serve coffee beverage similar to the Starbucks Via product. (Just add hot water and dissolve the single serve packet.) When I went to prepare my first cup I heated 16 oz of water to near boiling in the microwave, and added 2 pods to my cup and let it steep for about 3 minutes while stirring occasionally. That resulted in a weak but fairly tasty cup of coffee. You see, there are NO DIRECTIONS ANYWHERE ON THE BOX OR INDIVIDUAL PACKETS!<br /><br />I finally did a search on the internet and found the Marley website which explained these are coffee pods intended for use in a machine brewer. This would have been nice to know ahead of time. I don't even own a pod brewer. I ended up cutting open the pods and brewing them in my Bunn commercial coffee maker. The coffee is delicious this way but insanely expensive.<br /><br />I think if Marley provides some brewing instructions on the box and individual pods, this could be a good product as the coffee is very high quality, and rich and tasty.

review/summary: Intended for pod brewer; works used loose in French press
review/text: Packaging is very inviting, but there is not one word of instructions on the box or on the individually wrapped pouches.  When I opened the foil packet,the coffee fragrance was tantalizing. One side of the little pouch of coffee did say, "This side down." Not realizing they were for a pod brewer, I put them in my single cup drip maker with the appropriate side down--this yielded tasteless brown water like bad motel coffee that I threw away. Finally I saw one line on the Amazon product page that indicated these were for a pod brewer. Unfortunately, I do not have one, so I cut a little coffee bag open and dumped it into my single serve French press. This brewed a good, very strong cup of coffee.<br /><br />This is a decent product, but cries out for directions!!

review/summary: Great taste, but the packaging is strange to me.
review/text: The coffee has a very nice, chocolaty taste, very smooth, but the drawback was the packaging.  It comes in individual serving coffee bags, and I just have no idea how to use it.  I tried one cup like tea, pouring the water over it and letting it simmer, but by the time it got dark enough (I didn't know how long to steep it) it was cold.  I tried some other bags in a glass tea press, and that seemed to work better, but again didn't know how long to steep it.  There are no instructions on the package.  We usually make drip coffee, so maybe next time I'll just try stuffing a bunch of the coffee bags into the coffee maker.  I see the Amazon page says &lt;&lt;For Use only in Single Serve Home Coffee Pod Brewers>>.  I guess my problem is I have never heard of a Coffee Pod Brewer.<br /><br />FOLLOW-UP:  Today I put 8 of the pods in my drip pot and made 8 cups' worth and it was very good.  I called it chocolaty before, but maybe it's more like a mild cocoa flavor, slightly almond.  Very smooth and not at all bitter.  Great!

review/summary: Jamaica Mon
review/text: Four and One-Half Stars<br /><br />This coffee's packaging is a send-up of Jamaican style down to its name:  Marley Coffee.  (By the way, I actually saw Bob Marley walking by himself on West 57th Street in the late seventies).  Anyway, this coffee is meant for Pod coffee makers - did not realize this when I requested the coffee.  I do not own a pod coffeemaker.  You get 15 individual pod packets.  Each pod holds a single serving/cup of coffee.  To enable brewing in my coffee maker, I just cut the pods open and dumped into a coffee filter, and voila!  Coffee has nice rich aroma, and it has a full flavor.  It's definitely a better coffee than I had been drinking, which was your basic old school supermarket stuff.  For reference, I am not someone who tolerates strong coffee well.  Starbucks can give me a panic attack!  So, I thought the kick and richness was very nice and just right for me.<br /><br />As others have commented, if you're into that deep & dark, caffeine laden French roast, this may not be the coffee for you.

There are no instructions on the box on what to do with the pods, how much water or what machines it might work with.<br /><br />Evaluation:<br />Comes in single serving pods.<br />Nice packaging.<br />Light to medium strength coffee.<br />Tastes very slightly burnt.<br />Unlike what the advertising says, I taste no "berry notes".<br />No acidic taste (a plus).<br />Organic<br />Fair trade certified means farmers are paid a fair price for their coffee beans.<br /><br />In my opinion, there's better coffee out there, but worth a try.

review/summary: Nice coffee but a little acid
review/text: It's always great to find a special product, and Marley Coffee is just such a find.  The pods are handy, and organic is a good thing as is Fair Trade.  I'm going to disagree, however, with the reviewer who found the coffee too weak if the pods are used like tea bags.  I found just the opposite.  The coffee produced in my machine was far weaker than that produced when I just stuck the pod in the cup and poured boiling water over it.  The result from the "tea-bagging" approach was strong and a little more acid than I like, but it had a good coffee flavor.  In the machine I got more of a "coffee-flavored water" result even when I used three pods together.<br /><br />It's worth a try if you have a single-serve machine and it's a handy way to carry your own coffee on trips as it truly does do fairly well in either machine or tea-bag use.  I suspect the flavor will be a matter of personal taste, so give it a try and decide for yourself.  There are other Fair Trade organic coffees out there, but this is the first I've come across in pods.

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: Unfortunately I got this coffee through the Amazon Vine program and nowhere in the description did it state that this product was for pod-type coffee makers. Also unfortunately, while the box says it holds "single serve pods" it does not specify that they're pods for a machine, or in fact what machines they work with.  The packets themselves say nothing at all about pods or machines.<br /><br />So here's the problem: I have a box of single serve coffee pods which don't really tell me much of anything, requested because I thought they were simply single-serve coffee bags, not unlike tea bags.  And I don't own a pod coffee maker.  I don't like them very much.  I'm going to have to improvise in order to do any sort of review.<br /><br />I tossed a couple of pods into my standard drip coffee maker and added two cups of water (The classic 6 oz cup by which coffee is still measured in spite of the fact that we now live in a world where 16 oz cups are considered small.) What I got back out was a brew that would make church coffee laugh derisively. So then I just threw two bags into a cup and added 12 oz of hot water, and let them steep until the brew looked darker, and that actually worked pretty well.  With due respect to the gentleman who said "teabagging" with these things doesn't work, I have to disagree.  It makes a decent enough cup.  The coffee isn't strong, but it is smooth, and has has the classic African warmth and brightness.<br /><br />In all fairness, the truest test of this coffee would be to use it in a pod-style coffee maker, but absent that, you can actually make a decent cup without much work.  Just remember that it's 1 pod to each 6 oz of water, no matter what the instructions say.<br /><br />Which brings me to a gripe.  Where the heck are people finding instructions?  There are none on the box, none on the individual packets.  The only instruction I found was on the pod itself.  One side says: "This side down"  Seriously, even if your product is for a machine, it's a good idea to be clear about how to use the product in that machine.<br /><br />All in all, Marley Coffee got points for flavor but lost them for unnecessarily vague packaging and the fact that it's kind of pricey.  I don't honestly think that I'd change my review substantially even if I had a pod-style coffee maker to test it with, however if I do manage to find one and it changes my opinion, I will absolutely update this review.<br /><br />Amazon, you need to give a bit more information in your descriptions for Vine reviewers.  At least to the point where you let us know if any special equipment is required to use a product.

review/summary: Great Concept, But Where Are the Directions?
review/text: There is really nothing I love more than a great cup of coffee. However, if you want to make a great cup of coffee, then you need directions to show you how to get the most out of the coffee you are using.<br /><br />Although this coffee should be foolproof,(they are single serving bags, similar to a tea bag) there are no directions in the package to tell you how to make the best cup of coffee possible.<br /><br />I would like to have known things like:<br /><br />How much water do I use?<br /><br />Will filtered or distilled water make a better cup of coffee?<br /><br />How long should I soak the little coffee pack in the water?<br /><br />How hot should the water be for the best brewing?<br /><br />The company has a great concept. They want to offer you a great cup of coffee, that's environmentally friendly, and they want to help kids at the same time. You've won my heart. However, they had all the information you need to know about the company, its ideology, causes they support, and even where the coffee comes from and how the coffee is produced.<br /><br />Like I said, there were no brewing recommendations/directions on the package or in the box. If you don't mind a little trial and error, this is a great product. Get it right, and the coffee tastes great.

I have been using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1KJO">Folgers Coffee Singles</a>, which resemble tea bags. I place water in the coffee cup, heat it in the microwave, and then plop the Folgers in the hot water.  The result is acceptable, but not great,<br /><br />Although, the Marley coffee may not be designed for tea bag use, that is how I tried it.  I have found that the flavor is good and the taste is strong enough depending on how long the packet is left in the water.<br /><br />On the plus side, the Marley coffee can be used in a tea-bag manner, has good taste, and is fair trade coffee.  On the minus side, it costs around twice as much as the Folgers.  I will have to continue to experiment with it to see if it justifies the extra cost.

The largest box on the bottom is the size of my hand and, obviously, it gets smaller as it goes to the top. And, because of the box sizes, there wasn't much in the plastic bags inside each one. They stuff some of the boxes with shredded tissue to make it look like there's more too. The pro's about it are that it's definitely asthetically pleasing with the "gold" boxes and red bow, and the treats inside were very good, though very few. My suggestion would be to skip this product and find something that isn't such a huge rip-off.

review/summary: Like syrup-way to sweet. Buy Coco Lopez
review/text: I purchased this thinking it was a better deal than the Coco Lopez, which was excellent with just a little bit added to my strawberry protein shakes.  As another customer mentioned this is just like syrup.  I keep it in the refrigerator and it stays that way, no separation of any true coconut fat (which would have been fine with me as that is where the true coconut flavor is).  So now I am stuck with 24 cans of this.  Next time I will spend the extra money and get a much better product!!

review/summary: Cheap price, mediocre quality
review/text: I live in a small town and can find coconut cream and coconut milk, but I can't find cream of coconut in town.  I have to order it online...I need it for a coconut cream cake I make.  I chose this product, because it was the cheapest price and was available with Amazon Prime.  The cans arrived and most all of them were dented and labels were falling off the can.  The quality didn't seem great, but the product worked just fine and cake was fantastic.  I think next time I will pay more, just to try a better quality.  I feel like for how cheap it was, the quality was equal to the price.  I don't cook with this very often, so I would rather have better quality cans for storage.

review/summary: Is De Cecco the best dry pasta?
review/text: I love De Cecco's pastas. Last night I  tried their linguine fini with a simple EVOO and garlic sauce. It was just wonderful. In the last month, or so, I've tried their linguine, linguine fini, penne rigate, and orecchiette. All four are great.<br /><br />Let me make it clear that I do not consider myself an expert on pasta (or any other food, for that matter). But I've cooked a lot of pasta in my life and at least two things about De Cecco pastas stand out. First, I've always been advised that you only get one chance to flavor dry pasta and that is as it's cooking, so be sure to add plenty of salt to the water. It never seemed to make any difference before: no matter how much I added, I never tasted the salt. That's a big mistake with De Cecco pasta. This stuff does indeed absorb the salt flavor, and the sauce as well! Second, even when cooked according to package directions, De Cecco pastas will be more al dente than the normal store-bought pasta. Both the flavor absorptive and firmness of texture properties are claimed to be designed into the production process. Check out the De Cecco website for more details.<br /><br />So, is this the best dry pasta in the world? I don't know, but I'm never going back to store-bought. It costs more, but let's face it: no one is going to go broke because of the difference in price. Give it a try. Just be careful with the amount of cooking salt!

review/text: When this went on sale at my local grocery store, I decided to give it a try. For the most part these heat and eat Asian meals are unsatisfying. They have a ton of calories, lots of salt, and yet the portions are small and the flavor is kind of meh. This one is different from the others I've tried. The noodles have a nice texture--they are soft in the package not dry. The flavor was tangy sweet. The nuts add a nice crunch. And the prep time is less, because the noodles are pre-cooked. Overall, it was a decent buy. It's a little too high in calories and cost for me to buy/eat for lunch on a regular basis. But for something different, it's a nice choice.

review/text: I very rarely write reviews, however, this is the best thing I've found on Amazon. This is the real deal and the only way I can get fresher lobster is to go to Maine or order live lobsters, which is what I usually have to do.  Not only is the lobster fresh, tender, and extremely delicious, but the seller is exceptional as well. This seller knows what customer service is and that is rare these days (especially online). Lobsters were shucked yesterday afternoon, shipped overnight (for free), and I had them by lunchtime today. How nice to not have to deal with the mess of shucking the lobsters myself! Maine seafood is the best seafood in this country in my opinion and I will be buying it from Cape Porpoise often. I can't wait to get some steamers!

I appreciate the work invoved in picking the meat from the shell etc. The delivery and packaging is excellent, but I want fresh lobster.  I also know how easy it is to overcook lobster even marginally.<br /><br />I ordered more of this lobster, after discussion with the vendor, and no I did not get it free. This time the lobster was excellent, very tender, and with less water surrounding it. I conclude that it is fresh not frozen.

review/summary: Refreshing Ayala water
review/text: I saw this product at my local whole foods and decided to try it,  because I thought it would be interesting to try lavender flavored water.<br /><br />I actually smelled the water before I tried it and the scent was just great, mostly lavender-mint scented, but not too strong.<br /><br />When you drink it at first you can taste the lavender and then comes a little kick at the end with mint and then the lemongrass. I couldn't detect too much of the thyme but that could just be my taste buds.<br /><br />The water is pretty unique in that it's not sweet tasting and it's not bitter. It doesn't taste minty or like spearmint gum. It's smooth and soothing. Not fruity like some of the other flavored waters.<br /><br />I love the fact that there no calories and isn't artificial. I don't see anything that mentions sugar or sweetener. Best to stay away from  artificial sweetener anyway if you ask me. It is also certified organic.<br /><br />I think it could be really great chilled with some lemon wedges (which is good for your skin too!).<br /><br />I would buy it again :)

But, it was still great. I don't buy anything with fruit or acids or sugar added, so this was a great and tasty alternative. I'm wondering if the flavor varies with the batch, since other reviewers have not mentioned a strong lemon flavor. I will buy it again, because it is so refreshing.

review/text: We and our guests had wanted to try an authentic Virginia ham.  We ordered a Smithfield (large, bone-in).  The ham was 15 pounds (advertised as 13-15 pounds).  If a ham can be beautiful, then this one was, as we pulled it out of the oven.  We chose to use the 2nd recommended preparation method which was to soak for 24-36 hours and then roast.  The 1st recommended preparation method was to soak and then prepare in a steam pot (something you would see on a buffet line somewhere).  The ham was delicious, but very salty.  If I had to do it again, I would have soaked longer and changed the soaking water several times.  We are using leftovers in beans and in potato soup and letting the meat do the salting of the dish.

I probably will not be buying this sauce again unless the plastic container is changed to a more safer type.

She is a high energy 3 year old and her coat is beautiful since we switched. I do not give this food to our 10 year old cocker.

review/text: This is a great, grain-free canned dog food.  I have two small dogs who love<br />to eat and was trying to get their weight under control.  They've made big<br />improvements with this in their diet, plus the dry food made by Wellness.<br />The cans show up without any major dents, and the food itself actually<br />smells relatively appetizing (for dog food).  Good for picky eaters, as well.

review/summary: Happy Dogs
review/text: I have a 3 year old that can eat pretty much anything, but I have a 15 year old that has a very sensitive system.  I was feeding them Neuman's Organic Turkey and brown rice and realized that my old guy was having issues pretty often.  So, I have been mixing this in to transition them to just this grain free food and they LOVE it and he has had no issues at all so far.  It has been well over a month, and all is swell.  I am glad I made the switch.  And ... I just remembered, the reason I bought this was because a friend's dog was staying with us and that Golden is super allergic to grains, but was not really eating her food.  I mixed in a small amount of this with her regular dry food and she gobbled it all up.  I could not have her lose weight under my care.  I told her family and I believe they bought it to mix in her food now.  I am glad we switched!

review/summary: Good for picky dogs
review/text: I've tried many different dry foods with my chihuahua mix. She does okay with them for a little while, but then won't touch them. Even when she'll eat them, she takes her time and is not enthused at all. I decided to try a canned food to see if it might be more appealing to her, and since I like Wellness I tried this first. I started by mixing it with her dry food, but she went straight for the wet food, picking around the dry. She would eat some of the dry food at the end if I stood there and watched her. I kept this up for a couple weeks, then switched her over completely to the canned food, since my cat was eating her dry leftovers. She still gobbles it down after about a month, and still licks the bowl clean every night. I was concerned about switching her over to a completely canned diet, as I've heard not feeding dry food can cause problems with the teeth and gums, but I think brushing her teeth and giving her dental treats will be sufficient. It's nice that now she eats her whole meal within a couple of minutes, so I don't have to watch the bowl and make sure the cat doesn't eat it for her. I'm sticking with the turkey recipe for now, but if she starts getting picky again, I'll try the fish recipe.

review/text: My picky dog has never taken to a wet food so readily as Wellness Core. She really springs to breakfast with this stuff. We have put her on about a quarter-can a day of this along with a grain-free kibble. We're getting all grain-free in an attempt to address her flatulence. Yeah, it's worked like a charm. No more barley in my pup's diet!<br /><br />A couple cans were dented. I hope Amazon picks up direct selling of this item so I don't have to deal with Marketplace vendors next time.

review/text: Wellness foods, in general, seem to be as fine a quality as you can give your pet short of a completely homemade diet. A grain free diet is helpful to my golden retrievers (food allergies) and Wellness Core offers several protein options in a grain free formula. I think its important to feed canned along with kibble (and some fresh veggies - usually green beans - as well). There are many fine ways to feed dogs and cats, but this works for mine. Wellness Core is a consistently excellent product and the doggies love it.

I thought I'd try all varieties and I am glad I did.  All flavors are good by themselves but the onion ones are great topped with hummus, and the blueberry ones  with almond butter and blueberry jam.  You can eat quite a few by themselves and feel satisfied with a very good nutritional value and low calories and carbs. You don't have to be 'dieting' to appreciate them.

review/summary: GREAT dog food but HORRIBLE pacsevere from Amazon!
review/text: This dog food is fantastic! A premium quality at an affordable price.  I have 4 special needs Min Pins, and I've finally found one food that I can feed to them all.  The two boys are diabetic and blind, but they HATED the Sciend Diet W/D food.  And frankly, I did too.  It was so expensive for, in my opinion, a much inferior product.  So now I feed my two boys a combination of this plus the Diamond Senior dry food, and they are doing great!  One of my girls has both a heart condition and allergies, as well as only a couple of teeth, and after a few weeks of feeding her this, the allergies have all but disappeared.  My other little girl was a former puppy mill mommy that we rescued, and clearly she had been neglected and abused.  She was in such bad shape that we had to remove all her teeth, one eye, and shave her whole body. For the last year and a half, we could count how many strands of fur she grew back. She also had food allergies.  But after being on this for a few months, her allergies are cleared up, and she's getting a soft, silky coat of fur - at long last.  I'm not saying this food is responsible for that or that it's a cure-all miracle, but to me it has been!  I've got a happy and healty (well, as healthy as they can be) pack, and I hope that Amazon continues to carry this food.<br /><br />HOWEVER, be advised:  they do not provide enough protection in the way they package the product when they ship it, so I end up with a few dented cans.  In my last order that I just opened today, 13 of the 24 cans were moderately or severely damaged, and I'm contacting Amazon about this because that is just unacceptable.  They need to use the air bags instead of paper filling, and that would solve the problem.  But the food, in my opinion, can't be beat!

review/summary: Great for lamingtons!
review/text: This is the best tasting shredded (= dessicated) coconut I have found anywhere in the USA.  It is organic and sulfite free.  This is the unsweetened, finely shredded, very small pieces of dessicated coconut which is used in South East Asia, Australia etc.  This is not the same product as American style coconut, of which the most common type is  Baker's sweetened angel flake coconut.<br /><br />I like to buy finely shredded/dessicated coconut because I often bake Australian, British and European style cakes and cookies, which do not work well when made with flake coconut.  I have also discovered that finely shredded coconut can be used to make your own coconut milk or coconut cream at home.<br /><br />Flake coconut and dessicated coconut have a different taste and texture.  A cup of sweetened angel flake coconut has about 2 tablespoons of sugar added to it, so it is very sweet compared to shredded/dessicated coconut, which has no added sugar at all.  The shredded/dessicated coconut is drier and the pieces are very small compared to the flakes, so it has more surface area. Because of these two things, 8oz of dessicated coconut will absorb more liquid than 8oz of flake coconut.  Some recipes will work quite well with either kind of coconut, but others will not, even if you compensate for the sugar and liquid.  Its better, especially for baking, to use whatever the recipe originally calls for.<br /><br />The coconut I received from Amazon tasted very fresh and had a good use by date.  If you want to increase the shelf life of the coconut, throw the bags into the freezer or the refrigerator.  They will keep there a year.  Once a bag is opened, I always keep it in the refrigerator.  I don't like buying this kind of coconut from health food stores, as it often comes in bulk bins and has been exposed to the air.  Unsweetened organic coconut can get stale or even develop a rancid taste if it is stored open to the air. The sweetened flake coconut is much more stable because it contains preservatives and sugar.<br /><br />If you are an Australian wanting to make things like lamingtons or coconut ice, you need to use dessicated/finely shredded cooconut.  Flake coconut will not give the right results.  Dessicated/finely shredded coconut is also excellent for replicating those little coconut macaroon cookies that you find in many Chinese buffet restaurants.<br /><br />Shredded/dessicated coconut can be mixed with water to make your own coconut milk or coconut cream.  I find this is useful because I rarely use more than 1/2 a can when I cook with coconut milk (curries, soups, laksa etc).  Sometimes I only want a spoonful or two, to add a little flavor to a smoothie or a banana cake.  I have tried making coconut milk from flake coconut, but for my taste, it was way too sweet and did not have a good texture.<br /><br />To make coconut milk from dessicated coconut:<br /><br />Method 1.  Put equal parts of coconut and hot water by weight into a blender (eg 8oz coconut to 1 cup of hot water). Whizz in the blender for a minute or two.  If desired, you can strain and press it through a cloth or a fine sieve when it has cooled down.  This is not necessary for most recipes, unless you require a silky smooth texture for the end product.  For a lighter coconut milk, use 8oz of coconut to one and a half cups of water, or you can use "lite" shredded coconut to start with.<br /><br />Method 2.<br /><br />Simmer equal parts by weight of coconut with hot water until froth appears.  Do not boil.  Remove from heat and let it sit until it cools down.  If desired, you can strain it through a cloth bag or a very fine sieve, pressing out as much liquid as possible.<br /><br />To make a thick coconut cream from dessicated coconut:<br /><br />Use either method above, but use 4 parts of coconut to one part of water.<br /><br />I thought the price from Amazon was excellent, especially for an organic product.  At the time of purchase, it worked out at one dollar forty two cents per 8oz bag and in my case, shipping was free.  I can't find organic dessicated coconut anywhere else at this price.<br /><br />Overall I was very pleased with the taste, freshness, price and quality of this coconut.  I don't think that I will have any problems using up the 12 packets in one year, especially as I won't be buying any cans of coconut milk.

It's nice to finally purchase a quality functional food that's cheap.

It makes for an extremely dry coconut.  Some may like that quality but I don't and I took to moistening it with coconut water or coconut milk.<br /><br />I purchased the pack of 12 from Amazon because it was such a value compared to buying it from the local health food store.  That's a lot of coconut not to like.  I ended up donating the rest of my case to a local food bank so at least it would not be wasted.

I mix 15 raw almonds (soaked in spring water for at least 8 hours) with 3 table spoons of coconut flakes and 1 table spoon of raw unheated honey. Try it... it is one of the best desserts for me. I don't eat white flour products or ice cream so this satisfies me just fine.  I was unable to find how they dessicate/dry the coconut flakes.  I am hoping that it is not very high temperature. It would be the best if they are air dried but most likely not the most practical way for commercial production. if someone knows how they are dried please leave a note.

Organic, no sulfites, no sweetener, and it is whole coconut, not the leftovers from the coconut oil factory. I ordered this on a Thursday night and received it Friday afternoon, so typical fast shipping via Prime. This will be a subscription from now on.<br /><br />For coconut butter I use 2 bags. One slightly toasted in a cast iron skillet and the other right into my Vita-Mix. Add a pinch of Himalayan pink sea salt and blend on 7 until desired smoothness is reached.
