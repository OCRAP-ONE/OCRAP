review/summary: Lightening Fast!
review/text: The SD starter shipped the same day I ordered it and arrived in just a couple of days. I fed the culture immediately and it showed signs of life within six hours!  I have fed it regularly as directions stated and it continues to thrive and grow. I'm looking forward to baking a loaf of bread in a few more days. Thanks for a great product!

review/summary: Great starter
review/text: I received this package in the mail and followed the instructions; a day or two later, I had a very active sourdough starter.  I'd previously tried making my own starter from scratch (according to the instructions in Peter Reinhart's excellent "Artisan Breads Every Day" book), but my bread never tasted sour.  This product works perfectly and greatly improved my bread.

review/summary: Great Sourdough Starter
review/text: I bought 2 because I was afraid one wouldn't work (or I would kill one accidentally) -- it's not that much more since you have to pay shipping anyway. Total came out to $16.74.<br /><br />Anyways, both starters did fine, and I've had months of tasty sourdough now.<br /><br />The only thing I'm sad about is that my sourdough is probably more Madison now than San Francisco. I don't know, my palate/expertise is not good enough to recognize authentic sourdough. This really has nothing to do with the efficacy of the product. 5/5

review/summary: Some things are just not meant to be
review/text: Received quickly. Watched videos at Breadtopia and followed included directions. Nothing happened. This is the first time I have ever had a starter fail completely.<br /><br />I am going to order again and give it another try since it is so cheap and easier than trying a return. Will update.<br /><br />=================<br />Update 2/22/2012<br />=================<br /><br />I purchased another starter from same seller. Same as the first. Absolutely no signs of life. I was very careful to follow the directions extactly. It was only a few bucks so I just tossed it out and will try another vendor with a different strain. I seem to have no luck with the Breadtopia guy. I was looking forward to eating some of this bread.

review/summary: Sourdough Starter - Live
review/text: This one died on me so I can not give a better review on this one...I did not contact the company who sold me this nor their supplier because it might be my fault. I just did a sourdough starter myself and was happier with the result. I have frozen two of my own starter in the freezer after I got sick of making sourdough bread and baking almost everyday. It was fun making my own though.

review/summary: Delicious, but pricey
review/text: I loved almost everything about this gift set.<br /><br />It comes with a stainless strainer.  The strainer drained more slowly than my plastic colander, but it does drain thoroughly.<br /><br />I enjoyed both pasta types, but my favorite was the Bumbola, which really holds the pasta sauce, because of its rough surface.<br /><br />I believe the Pomodoro-Basilico Sauce was the best sauce I've ever had!  I love that it's organic, but the flavor is where it really shone.  Not too sweet, but very flavorful.  I only wish Amazon sold the sauce separately.  I'd definitely order it on a monthly basis.<br /><br />I normally don't like biscotti, but the Almond and Anise Biscotti really is quite good.  It has a creamy feel (even though the biscotti is quite crisp), and a nice almond flavor to it.<br /><br />There is also an apron.  I think it works better as a towel, and reminds me of the old-fashioned flour sack towels.<br /><br />It also came with a recipe card that uses the pasta and sauce (included in the set), grapeseed oil, cubed mozzarella cheese, salt and pepper.  I altered the recipe slightly by sauteing 1/2 pound of mushrooms and a handful of chopped onion) in butter (instead of the grapeseed oil), and I used shredded cheese, instead of cubed.  It was delicious!<br /><br />Because of the price, I don't think I'll buy it for personal use, but it will make a wonderful gift for the Italian food lover.  In fact, I've got a sister with a birthday coming up, and I've ordered one of these gift sets for her gift.  I'll report back when she gets it, and let everybody know if she likes it as much as I did.<br /><br />7/21/2012 UPDATE:  As mentioned, I bought this as a gift for my "pasta snob" sister (pasta snob are her words, not mine.  She loved the pasta, which didn't offer  up any off-flavors of its own, and because of the rough surface, really grabbed the sauce.  She gave the sauce 4 out of 5 stars.  She said it was a bit acidic, and could have used a pinch of sugar to tone down the heartburn it caused.  She said the Roma tomatoes were awesome, with a robust flavor.  She would have added onions, but she loved the basil flavor.  She said the biscotti had a nice flavor, with a crisp (but not hard) texture.  Her favorite part of the set was the colander.  She said that a good quality colander will thoroughly drain the water from the pasta, but will do so slowly.  I already knew I liked the way this pasta drains my pasta (not just the pasta that came with the gift set, but the cheap stuff from my grocery store), but I never knew why.  My sister explained to me that the trick to properly draining pasta is to do it more slowly, thus giving it a better texture.  All in all, this gift set was a hit with my sister and her family.

review/summary: Great gift idea for the foodies in your life
review/text: What a wonderful gift this is for any foodie or pasta lover!  I enjoyed the marinara sauce especially, it has a distinct, fresh flavor that exceeded my expectations.  Not too sweet and just the right amount of basil to elevate any pasta dish or other creation you make.  The pastas were very fresh, and seemed to be high quality and came out excellent too.  The dish towel is an added bonus, although thin, is a large size and good for having in the kitchen for cleanup.  The colander is a very decent size but dented easily since it's quite thin.  All in all, it makes for a very thoughtful present for food-minded people and would be well enjoyed.

review/summary: An ideal gift basket for premium pasta lovers--as long as they ditch the "basket."
review/text: A nice change from the usual gift baskets with the spreadable cheeses and the designer crackers, the Wine.com Francis Ford Coppola Pasta gift set serves up the makings of a gourmet pasta dinner, creatively ditching the obligatory gift "basket" for a colander.<br /><br />We're going to steal that idea for the next gift basket we assemble, but we'll use a better colander than the noticeably flimsy stainless-steel one that has already started to rust at the rivets after just one wash.<br /><br />We have no other complaints regarding quality of the contents, with our particular "basket" containing two packages of Coppola's Mammarella Pasta Rustica--a Gemelli and the whimsical organic, bumblebee-shaped Bumbola.  There's also a jar of Mammarella organic Pomodoro-Basilico pasta sauce that packs a nice little kick and contains whole basil leaves, a Mammarella cloth hand towel (presumably to drape over your pasta pot to keep the contents warm?), and, for dessert, a small package of very tasty Almond Anise Biscotti from Biscotti di Suzy.<br /><br />The only thing missing would be a nice bottle of chianti!

review/summary: Great Collander, but Everything Else is Mediocre.
review/text: For Forty-Five dollars, you're not really getting much with this gift basket. The centerpiece of the gift basket is a MASSIVE collander dwarfing the other four we have in our house. Unfortunately the food products contained with in just weren't very good.<br /><br />Here's what you get:<br /><br />1 12 oz. boxes of Bumbola Pasta. We really weren't impressed by this as the pasta retained too much water and was rather tasteless.<br /><br />1 12 oz. box of Gemelli pasta. Again, this was rather flavorless and although both pasta were eye-catching, they weren't very enjoyable to eat.<br /><br />1 package of almond anise biscotti. This package held three of the biscotti and they were...okay. Not good, but not bad either. Just sort of mediocre.<br /><br />1 25 oz. jar of Tomato Basil Pasta Sauce. This wasn't enough pasta sauce for both pasta. Again, the sauce really lacked any discernable flavour.<br /><br />1 apron. This was useful as it also acts as a towel. Perhaps the best part of the package after the collander.<br /><br />1 recipe card that is for a dish that doesn't use either of the enclosed pastas. Why include a recipe for something not in the gift box? This makes no sense.<br /><br />1 awesome collander.<br /><br />All in all the food was bland and forgetable, but the non food items are still getting use in my household. I wouldn't recommend this basket at all, and you can get a comparable collander and apron/towl for well under ten dollars.

review/summary: Apocalypse Now Gift Choice
review/text: The "gift basket" is actually a "gift colander" that is not too well constructed.  It has a light, cheap feel with holes so small a trained chef using it will curse and your grandma will go on strike.  Most of the items are sitting atop filler for that "it looks so pretty but buyer beware" feel.  Included are:<br /><br />- 2 12 oz. boxes of dry organic pasta - I have to admit the pasta varieties (Bumbola and Genelli) are unique and fun.<br />- 1 package of 3 almond anise biscotti - very pronounced taste that I liked.<br />- 1 25 oz. jar of Tomato Basil Pasta Sauce made from organic ingredients with a heavy cayenne pepper edge.<br />- 1 recipe card for a pasta variety not included in the basket - I still can't figure that one out.<br />- 1 "apron towel" 32-1/2 inch X 28 inch with Mammarella face on it.  You are supposed to wrap this around your waist & tuck it in your pants.  A very "homey" Italian visual but the towel has a funny feel to it - like it needs washing.<br /><br />I notice that other reviewers have mentioned that the sticker on the colander is difficult to remove and I agree with them.  It wouldn't peel off so I used a paring knife that scratched the surface.<br /><br />This would not make a bad wedding, housewarming or shower gift except for the price.  The only thing that justifies the $45 price tag would be the Francis Ford Coppola name and I'd only pay that if a bottle or two of his wine was included.  I found this product to be very disappointing.

review/summary: Over priced and underwhelming.
review/text: Probably the best way for me to review this basket is to list each item included and state my reaction to it.<br /><br />Pomodoro-Basilico sauce, 25 ounce jar -- This is a very chunky tomato based sauce with a flavor totally different from jar sauces available in the grocery stores in my area.  I couldn't figure out what gave it that peppery taste until I saw that the ingredient list includes cayenne pepper.  There is enough there that we could definitely notice it.  There is also so much olive oil that it can be seen around the edges of the sauce.  Too much?  I don't think so, but I could see it quite clearly.  I think everything in the ingredient list was called "organic" with the exception of the spices.  The basil leaves were often still whole which wasn't exactly a pleasant thing to see and they felt slippery in my mouth.  A good sauce and probably fabulous when freshly made.  The jar was large enough to make a total of 4 servings with ample sauce on the pasta.<br /><br />Bumbola pasta, 12 ounce box - Made with organic semolina in antique bronze molds Coppola calls this shape "playful".  He is absolutely correct that it is rarely seen today and also correct that the shape allows it to hold lots of sauce easily.  This is the pasta I used with the jar of sauce provided in the basket.  Cooking half the box yields a generous amount for two servings.  I'm sorry to say I couldn't discern any special *taste* of the pasta but it is unusual visually.<br /><br />Gemelli pasta, 12 ounce box - Made with durum semolina on the antique molds this is a long, thin, spiral pasta which Coppola says has rough edges because of being made in the older molds so it holds sauces well.  I haven't tried this one yet.<br /><br />Almond and Anise Biscotti -- There are three pieces of biscotti and the anise flavor is quite pronounced.  I don't like anise so this was not a hit with me.  It was a little disconcerting that the sticker on the packet stated a sell by date of 03/01/13.  That is eleven months from now.  I was not pleased with that.<br /><br />Stainless Colander, 5 quart -- This is a large colander but please notice that it never claims to be stainless steel.  And it definitely isn't.  I picked it up expecting it to be stainless steel and almost threw it across the counter because it was so much lighter than I had expected.  My sticker on the bottom says Made in India and that sticker is super hard to remove.  The draining holes in the colander are very small and I have several colanders which are much superior in both quality and usability.  This was definitely not a hit.<br /><br />Kitchen towel/apron -- This is 31" x 26 1/2" with two selvage edges and two hemmed edges.  There is a color rectangle with the Mammerella picture logo on one lower edge.  This is so thin you can actually see through it.  It could be used in any way you chose because cooks normally have their own habits they follow when preparing a meal.  The texture is rather rough so I will definitely wash it several more times before I use it.  Probably not going to be used very much by me unless it softens up enough for a drying cloth.<br /><br />Recipe Card -- For Quick Mozzarella Pasta Sauce -- Let me just save you some trouble here.  Cook some pasta according to package directions, cook one clove of chopped garlic in a HUGE amount of Mammarella Basil Grapeseed oil (1/4 cup), add the Pomodoro-Basilico sauce, melt in 4 ounces of cubed mozzarella cheese, season with salt and pepper.  Not exactly what I would call an innovative recipe.  Certainly not anything special to be included with this gift, especially if you are sending it to someone.<br /><br />The packaging is all in greens, browns and other earth colors, probably to signify organic to the consumer's eye and brain.  The entire colander was filled with balled up paper or the zig-zag cut brown paper filler with all the items then arranged on top.  The whole thing is encased in shrink clear plastic wrap.  The bow is two strands of the very narrow paper ribbon.  I tried to "pouff" the bow up to make it look pretty but had no luck.  It is simply too narrow to have any fluff in it.<br /><br />Would I send this as a gift basket to a friend?  Definitely not.  For this price it is simply much too expensive for what you get.  The Francis Coppola name does not make up for the high price.  The sauce was good and the bumbola pasta was fun to look at and it held a lot of sauce.  Otherwise I think it is overpriced and underwhelming.

review/summary: Lackluster Italian pasta gift basket for an exorbitant price
review/text: This gift basket consists of mostly Francis Coppola Mammarella brand products. The "basket" arrived in one big box inside another big box. The gift itself is shrink wrapped in plastic and tied with a very cheap stringy straw-like bow on top.<br /><br />Included in the gift basket I received was:<br /><br />- 1 pkg of 3 almond anise biscotti<br /><br />- 1 12 oz. box of Bumbola Pasta Rustica made of organic ingredients<br /><br />- 1 12 oz. box of Gemelli Pasta Rustica made of organic ingredients<br /><br />- 1 25 oz. jar of Tomato Basil Pasta Sauce made of organic ingrediets with first 3 ingredients being organic tomatoes, organic tomato puree, and oganic onions<br /><br />- 1 recipe card for Farfallone pasta not included in the gift<br /><br />- 1 "apron towel" 32-1/2 inch wide by 28 inch long with Mammarella name on it.  This towel should be used to wrap partially around your waist and be tucked into your pants as you cook.<br /><br />- 1 5 qt stainless colander made in India.  The tag did not say stainless steel only stainless; whatever that means.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />The pasta sauce tasted good; more like Classico than the cheaper Ragu or Prego.  The sauce was good only for one box of pasta, however.<br /><br />The Gemelli pasta I tried tasted like any store-bought pasta and to me that was good.<br /><br />The biscotti tasted fine as well, especially dunked in tea.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />The towel-like apron is made of a thin feed-sack material.<br /><br />The colandar is very light, very thin and almost felt like tin. In addition, I couldn't get the glue mark from the decal off even after I used the adhesive remover Goof Off.  The paper towel I used to wipe on the Goof Off also became stained gray which has not happened before when I've used this remover previously on true stainless steel--which I doubt this is.<br /><br />The gemelli pasta box I opened filled only half the box, which means the packaging is large to give you the impression you are getting more.<br /><br />The rest of the gift is all shredded cardboard stuffing.<br /><br />In summary, at the current price of $44.99 with the cheap colander and apron towel and the lackluster brown boxes of pasta, you could have paid around $27 to make this yourself. For instance, a similar box of the same brand of pasta (Francis Coppola Mammarella Quadrefiore Pasta Rustica) is currently listed for $2 on Amazon. A comparable colander is currently listed for $9.99(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00555ETXY">ExcelSteel 242 5-Quart Stainless Steel Colander</a>). The actual pasta sauce (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQHJFI">Francis Coppola Pomodoro-Basilico Sauce</a>) is currently listed for $6.49.  So if you added all that together plus threw in a few dollars for the cheap towel apron and 3 biscotti, I doubt you would be have paid more than $30. The mark-up is just too high at the current price.<br /><br />If this gift were priced at $27 or $30 max, then I would consider this an okay buy (3-stars) realizing that at the price you should expect the quality of the non-food items to be cheap, cheap, cheap.  The food is fine but are 2 boxes of pasta, 1 jar of sauce and 3 cookies worth this price?  In my opinion at the current price, this product isn't even worth considering.

review/summary: Nice Gift Collection
review/text: First, let me discuss what you get.  2 large boxes of pasta, mainly of the twisted/bowtie variety, one large bottle of sauce, some biscotti (3 pieces)and a kitchen towel that's sufficiently large to qualify as half a bath towel.  All of this comes in a large 10 inch or so colander.<br /><br />Now for what you don't get -- the pasta shown in the picture at Amazon.  I got two boxes as described above, not the larger pasta as shown.  No real difference, though, pasta is pasta to me.<br /><br />My father tried the sauce and found it to be medium spicy, not so spicy it'll leave you tasting it all night but just enough spice to make it memorable.  It's also sufficiently thick that it doesn't end up on the plate more than the pasta.<br /><br />Nice gift basket and a definite for those who recognize Coppola's name (if you don't, look up the Godfather movies).

review/summary: Tasty and Pricey
review/text: This gift basket came double boxed and securely packaged.  Inside the second box was a cellophane wrapper package with 2 boxes of pasta, one jar of sauce, one package of biscotti, a towel, and colander.  One of the packages of pasta had a tear that caused a couple of pieces to fall out.  Other than that the presentation was quite nice.<br /><br />Now on to the important part, the taste!  We tried the smaller pasta, it retained it's firmness when cooked, and had a pleasant flavor.  The taste is definitely superior to generic grocery store pasta.  The sauce was a real winner!  It had large chunks of vegetables and had a fresh full flavor, one of the better jarred sauces I've tried.  The biscotti was almond anise flavored, the anise was quite strong, I like that flavor so enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />The down side is that the price is pretty high for what you get.  Gift baskets tend to be pricier than what you'd buy individually, so I'm not sure it's out of line for the genre.

review/summary: Great cat food.  It's a keeper!
review/text: All 3 of my cats love this food.  They were previously on Wellness Turkey and when the cans were recalled I tried this on the suggestion of a family friend since their one cat has the same crystal issues our oldest does.  He eats his prescription dry in the morning and this at night.  Normally he's content to let the other two cats get to their food first and hold back with patience for his own, but with this it is the first time I have seen him muscle away the other two cats to eat.  I'll be sticking with this and the turkey flavor.<br /><br />Also there is no fish in this or the turkey flavor wet or dry foods which is excellent!  My cats don't tend to enjoy food that has fish in it and this is one of the few foods I can find that is both good for them and has no fish.  One of them does not like the peas in the food, he will eat around them, but one of the others eats them when he's done.  So if your cat hates bits of veggies they may not really enjoy it as much.<br /><br />Oh and one more point, it doesn't have that funky wet food smell a lot of other foods (even good ones) have.  I really can't smell it once I stand up after putting it in the bowl.

review/summary: Excellent choice for my finicky feline!
review/text: Since my elderly cat has started eating a wet food diet, she's become extremely finicky. She used to eat anything I'd put in front of her, until about a year ago when she decided nothing was good enough.  I'd been through every brand in the store...she doesn't like fish, plain chicken or lamb so my choices were limited.  When I found this, I gave it a try since she primarily likes beef. The ingredients were excellent and I read great reviews from Vets about it online.  She has been scarfing this food down from day 1 and still loves it. There are peas and carrots in it and the  consistency of it is very mushy. She likes it that way, so she doesn't have to chew much. I also noticed it doesn't dry out if there's any left in her bowl for several hours, like other brands have.  I definitely plan to continue giving this to her. I've been ordering on Amazon since it's been difficult to find it in my local pet stores lately.

review/summary: Cats are obligate carnivores
review/text: Whole peas may seem appetizing to a human but to cats, they're junk food. Cats get all their nutrition by eating the whole animal. Cats have hard time digesting plant matter. This is closer to dog food than cat food since dog's physiology will allow digestion of many plant based food itms. My cats ate about half of the yellow goo around the peas and carrots. If you want a true holistic approach for cats, veggies gotta go.

review/summary: Great cat food
review/text: After my cat was diagnosed with renal failure, he refused to eat any of the canned versions of his vet prescribed food for kidney disease although he would eat Hill's Science Diet k/d dry food, but he was vomiting it up regularily. Since his diet requires low protein after searching online I finally found Spot's Stew. My cat really likes it and readily eats the chicken, turkey and salmon varieties. Granted sometimes he eats around the carrots, peas and green beans, but he does eat them. I really like that Spot's Stew is an all natural cat food with no by-products or fillers, and especially that it is an alternative for my cat that he really enjoys.

review/summary: Dog Food Masquerading as Cat Food
review/text: My cat loved the dry version of spot's stew.  When she was sick with a UTI, I purchased this in hopes of adding some additional fluid to her diet.  When I dumped it in her bowel, she looked up at me as if I were mad, and I couldn't blame her.  It is literally "stew," with whole chunks of peas, carrots, etc. in it.  Cats are carnivores.  I have owned several, and I have never seen one of them willingly eat a piece of fruit or vegetable, grain products excluded, that hadn't been completely ground up and disguised in something else.<br /><br />She took one sniff and walked away.  Of course, cats are unpredictable creatures and YMMV.  But there are loads of good quality pate-style wet foods and all-meat wet foods that most cats are more likely to prefer.

review/summary: Cats review
review/text: I purchased this for my 15 year old cat who has health issues. Unfortunately, this cat decided after about 2 cans that she was not going to eat any more health food. She didn't eat the first cans very well even though I tried giving it in the morning when she's the hungriest and she licked a couple times and then followed me around meowing for something else. I finally gave up and gave it to the other cats. Two of the seven other cats will eat it but they leave the peas and anything else that is not mashed. So as far as I'm concerned it is great food, but the cats weren't impressed.

review/summary: My cat loves Spot's Stew, and I know it's good for him.
review/text: I've seen other reviewers say their cats wouldn't eat the vegetables in Spot's Stew. Before deciding for or against this product, try just a couple of flavors from Petco or Petsmart first. My cat goes ga-ga for all of this product, including the vegetables. Every cat's different. I know this product is healthy from looking at the label. I used to buy Blue, but one of the top Blue ingredients is chicken meal, which, if you look that up on the internet, is chicken skin. Uggh! I wouldn't ever want my furry loved one to eat skin - that's like feeding a human infant McDonald's, no offense to McD's.

review/summary: Wow! Cat Food That Seems Yummy!
review/text: Wow! I have the pickiest cats in the whole universe.  The only wet food they eat is Spot's Stew Chicken.  I can get them to eat the Chicken/Beef flavor if I add some shaved Bonito but with three cats Slinky, Jester and Regal, only Slinky and Jester scarf the food down.  They will eat the chicken without the Bonito but Regal is another story.  She won't eat it at first but might come back later and eat some.  She will ONLY eat the Chicken and does not like Bonito so with her, it gets a little more tough.  However, this food is a wonderful consistency, smells good (to me the human) and I assume to the kitties as well because they LOVE this stuff.  For the vegetables, I don't know if cats really need them however, I mush them up with the meat and they don't notice.  If I miss mushing some, then yes they try to eat around the peas/carrots.  All I can say is thank goodness for this food.  I spent lots of money and time trying to find something they would like.  I also feed them a mix of Halo dry Sensitive Formula Turkey and Purina Dental Health.  In order to prevent urinary symptoms, I give my cats only fresh bottled water every day that I put in bowls all over the house.  With the good water, the good food and lots of petting, I have the happiest cats in Arizona!  Thank you Halo!!

review/summary: Chicken and Beef
review/text: I have 5 cats and they all love this Chicken and Beef Recipe. Whenever I put it out at feeding time, there is a rush to the bowls that have Spot's Stew in them. With 5 kitty mouths to feed, the whole case would be gone in about 4 or 5 days if everybody got the Spot's Stew, so I put some other favorites out also and pretty soon everyone is satisfied. Since no cat eats a whole can at one sitting, those poor things that had to "settle" for Trout or some such later wander over and get their fair share of the stew. I have been so pleased with it, that I plan to order in other flavors that are also 5 star winners.<br />But, at our house, WHOLESOME CHICKEN AND BEEF are definite winners and we all recommend them to all who are looking for something to hit the spot with their felines!

review/summary: Picky felines love this canned food
review/text: My two cats somehow never figured out how to use their teeth to bite into their food--given dry food, they'll just use their tongues to lick it up and swallow the kernels whole, with an occasional bite with the teeth to crunch on food that's already been delivered into their mouths.  For a while I despaired of getting them to eat wet food, as they would just sit there and lick up all the juices, without getting much of the meat.  Typical canned food is just packed too tight, and the texture is not amenable for breaking off little bits with just their tongues.  Finally, I tried out Spot's Stew, which solved the problem.  This food is much looser, I think due to the inclusion of peas and other veggies, and the meat part is just the right consistency where they can lick it up successfully.  At first the cats would eat around the veggies, but they now lick up every morsel, and even prefer the Spot's Stew over the Wellness pouches.  I also like that the food doesn't contain any fish, as one of my cats is allergic to something or other (his back legs are always itchy, and he'll pull out the hair), and the vet suggested it might be fish.  Anyways, thank goodness for Spot's Stew, otherwise my teeth-challenged cats would never have been able to enjoy wet food!

review/summary: Cats love it!
review/text: I wasn't sure what would come of my venture in buying this food for my 2 cats that can eat poultry after reading the mixed reviews, but thought it was worth a try.  I am so glad I did!  I was expecting a stew like another reviewer said, and I guess you could refer to it that way.  When I opened the first can that is what I was expecting to see, but instead it is a course pate with chunks of veges in it. Kind of like a toddler food.  Cats are tricky to please for sure, but mine loved everything about this food.  They not only ate the chunks of veges, but licked their bowls clean.  I love the fact that it was such a hit, and will continue to buy it for them.  I also love that is like something you would make for them at home, only with all the right vitamins and minerals added.  Very user friendly.  My 3rd cat cannot eat poultry, so until Halo makes one without chicken in it, she will be fine with her Nature's variety instinct rabbit and Tiki foods.<br />UPDATE - 11-16-2011  My cat has been eating this now for a little while and she always seems hungry when she gets this!  I don't think I will be buying more for her.  I do think it is a good food and probably perfect for cats that need the lower protein, but mine need less moisture in the food and more meat.  I always add about a tablespoon of water on their canned food anyway.  Cost wise, this is about the same as Natures Variety, Natures Logic and even Addiction which are wonderful foods.  I like it better when I add the moisture and am paying for meat in their food.

The soft texture, and good nutrition, is excellent for (1) the elderly cat (2) the cat who's sick and (3) the cat who will literally eat anything, but you'd prefer he eat something healthy!<br /><br />This is "human quality" cat food, meaning the ingredients are pure enough for a human to eat, and it smells a little like chicken pot pie filling!

review/text: I have a kitten that just LOVES this stuff. The breeder I got him from didn't give me any of his old food, and I had heard that switching food quickly causes stomach upset... but I read about Spot's Stew being great for problem tummies and it's true! My kitten has never had any problems on this food since we brought him home. Also, from the human perspective, this stuff smells like chicken/turkey/fish and not like dog vomit, like certain brands of cat food. Big plus for me.

The other one though continued to chow down, and again left the veges, but came back later and ate most of them.  The next serving -what do you know -neither of them wanted it anymore.  I don't get it -I've never had cats like something so much one day and the next day be turned off from it.  I'm very disappointed, I wanted them to like it, knowing how good it is for them.

review/summary: A much-missed favorite.
review/text: A few years ago, my cats and I relocated to Germany. And while my four-pawed trio generally took the move in stride and quickly adapted to their new home in a manner that filled me with new love and admiration for them, there is one item now, several years later, still sorely lacking in their lives: Pounce Tuna Treats! For as long as we've been together (and in the case of the two females, that means their entire life), there has never been a better way to reward them or just show them my affection than by giving them some of these - my cats loved them, and I knew that due to the treats' many healthy ingredients I was actually doing something good for my kitties in addition to making them happy. But Pounce is nowhere to be found on the shelves of German stores! My cats are not overly picky in their food choices; they willingly accept almost everything appearing in their food bowls. But they have made it quite clear to me that a decent substitute for Pounce is yet to be discovered. In the meantime, what's a poor cat owner to do???

review/summary: decent, but not as "dental" as I expected
review/text: I bought this product hoping it would help keep my cats teeth clean and their breath fresh. I wish I had read the ingredients before I purchased it because it doesn't seem to have any enzymatic ingredients found in true, working dental treats. It also doesn't have any breath freshening ingredients. I think the only reason why they are "dental" treats is because they are crunchy and not moist treats, which is very good. These are MUCH better than the pounce soft and chewy varieties or any soft and chewy treat that can stick to cat teeth and cause bad breath and tooth decay. Another issue I have with these treats is that my cats only like this product while its very fresh. They seem to go stale really easily, like within a week, and then after that my cats don't care for it. I always close them tightly and I've even tried putting them in a separate bag- in container, but still no luck. If your looking for a real dental treat I would Crunch n' Clean with DentaShield. Greenies brand doesn't have many beneficial dental ingredients either, but they are another pretty good one as they too contain vitamins but with a little bit of added breath freshening ingredients in them, so they are much better than these. This treat my not help teeth, but they definitely won't hurt them. Also there are vitamins in these, which is pretty cool. They really are pretty decent treats, and I would probably give them 3 stars if they were just treats. However, to be marketing them as "dental," they really should have at least one dental ingredient.

I regularly store wine for lengthy periods of time in my basement which keeps a pretty constant temperature of 50-60 degrees F. The remnants in the bottle still had bubbles in it hours after it exploded. Fermentation was still taking place in the bottle, clearly. The small amount I could have was tasty, but the packaging and process needs some work. Disappointed with the clean up required!

review/summary: Rip-off
review/text: I have ordered different knotted bones from Amazon before and been very satisfied. I ordered almost $80 worth of bones from this company and the quality is inferior. They are practically hollow and extremely light. My German Shepherd and Coon hound will make their way through these in minutes. I am very disappointed.

review/text: Let your puppy naw on these for a month each. They will last for months. Alot less expensive than buying them one at a time at your local pet store. Save, Save, Save! Only complaint I have is it would be nice if they had a beef flavor added. Ever the less, my Lab chews on these rawhide bones alot.

review/summary: Tasty and extremely valuable!!!
review/text: These are cheap considering they are an expensive delicacy in Chinese cuisine, and they are much more expensive in China, although I've never tried abalone before, but these are tasty and sure is a delicacy.<br />So I've tried the South American abalone, now I have to try the Chinese ones to compare, the Chinese abalone as far as I know are dried and they do not use fresh abalones and it takes days to prepare them.<br />The shop was nice and friendly and threw in a free seafood product for me to try, it's a nice marketing approach to give away freebies since the product is about to pass its "Best Before" date(about one month left), now I'm not trying to abash anybody or anything like that but I'm just being blunt and candid, but I still very much appreciate the free product. The most pleasant thing is that the seller wrote in pen to thank me for ordering, this is what is very personal and heartwarming to me because most thank yous nowadays they just type it on the paper, but you got someone who wrote thank yous by hand is just very touching, and at the end of the thank you note there's a little smiley face which is very cute lol and I'm sure to order some more in the future. Thank you Allen!!! ^o^

review/text: To me, this is nearly the perfect tea! It is a green tea, so just light caffeine. The light fruity taste is just right, and love the little bits of papaya to give it that extra flavor. I love it hot, but have also discovered it makes a fantastic iced tea. A touch of sweetener seems to bring out the hint of strawberry even more. I have so many teas, but this one is truly my favorite! Plus you have the benefits of it being a green tea - who could ask for more?!

review/summary: Dog and Cat Like this Jerky,  We Don't
review/text: We have found one cat and one dog who like this jerky.  Every human I've pawned this off on thinks it stinks, so the two animals keep having the opened packages offered to them. I added a couple torn into bits to a squash stew last night, and it almost snuck into the family meal.  It added a "meaty" texture as it rehydrated and the flavor fortunately was minimized.  Straight out of the bag, these little disks are nasty in flavor and the texture is very, very spongy.  The diameter is larger than a nickel, smaller than a quarter.  The two animals give it a star, but be careful you only give them one at at time so they don't get sick.  Humans polled don't even give it one star.

review/text: Whoever formulated this couldn't tell the difference between pepperoni and soy.  At the risk of looking low-class, pepperoni gets its flavor from salt and oil, not eleven all-natural herbs and spices.  Even worse, the flavor is truly vile beyond the ability for words to adequately describe.  I shall save this so-called food for torturing the next classmate who says we should, for the good of the environment, discontinue ranching.

review/summary: Worse than I expected
review/text: The other reviews are right on the money.  I have tried several types of vegetarian "jerky" in an effort to find one that had a good taste, provided a good approximation to the typical beef jerky consistency and was reasonably priced.  I was suckered into buying this product because of the Amazon price break and several positive on-line reviews (that I now believe were probably placed by the manufacturer).  Anyway, I can't give this stuff away - my wife and kids won't eat it and I don't want to be accused of mistreating my dogs by feeding it to them.  This stuff tastes bad and chews as if it was made from a piece of old leather.  Definitely not worth it.

review/summary: Tastes great to me, but Amazon sells moldy food!
review/text: I was excited to find these on Amazon, and greatly amused by the negative reviews.  Does this jerky taste like dogfood?  I don't know, because I've never had dogfood before.  (har, har.  Sorry couldn't resist.)  Seriously though, not everyone is going to like this jerky.  It doesn't taste ANYTHING like the real stuff, and consequently is a very poor alternative.  However, if you can get past that and see this as a savory chewy snack in it's own right than you may just find that it's pretty tasty.  (Then again, my mom is a total health nut, and I grew up eating things like carob and whole wheat cake, so maybe I'm not the best judge of taste.  haha.)<br /><br />I did have an issue ordering these off Amazon, so maybe that's where some of the negative reviews are coming from.  Nearly every pack I ordered was moldy.  Customer service was great, of course, and I received my refund, but I'd be wary of expired foods if I were to order again.<br /><br />(These snacks are flavored with Bragg's Liquid Aminos which is a condiment used primarily as a soy sauce alternative.  Whatever you put Bragg's in makes it taste like Bragg's.  That's what these taste like.)

review/text: Don't think the previous reviewer is wrong, jaded, or somehow a veggie jerky competitor.  These things really are rubbish.  What's worse?  This good deal through Amazon means you'll have plenty of these meat flavored sponges to impress your friends with how bad it can get.  I will say that my friends and I found that if you leave them out to dry for about 48 hours, they do get a little better in the texture department.  But to quote one friend, "well, that made them easier to spit out."

review/summary: A good chilled matcha
review/text: There are so many fruit flavors and I couldn't pick one, so I went with this blend of tropical fruits called "Tropical Matcha". When I first got a whiff of the matcha it smelled very fruity, almost candy sweet.<br /><br />I put 1/4 teaspoon in a water bottle a shook it up to give myself a nice fruity drink. The flavor is very light on this one. It tastes a lot like a fruit punch of some sort. It's hard to specifically point out one type of fruit over another. If you're a fan of punches, I'd definitely give this a try. Since I was having a hard time detecting the flavor, I added another 1/4 teaspoon of matcha. The flavor was a little stronger, but I didn't really get that overly strong matcha taste, which is good. I bet tossing some sweetener in here would bring out the fruit taste even more.

review/text: Organic freeze-dried corn is a wonderful snack. I eat it instead of tortilla chips. Organic freeze dried corn tastes great and I usually eat it right out of the bag.<br /><br />Organic freeze dried corn has a light, airy texture that practically melts in your mouth. It has a fresh taste that reminds me of sweet corn right from the garden.<br /><br />Freeze-dried corn can also be added to your favorite recipes. And it will remain fresh when stored for long periods of time.<br /><br />But Sensible Foods Organic Sweet Corn, at several dollars for 0.75-Ounce, is way overpriced.<br /><br />Check out "Organic Just Corn" by a company called Just Tomatoes. Amazon sells it now. The product is just as good as this one and you get about 5 times as much for the price. The quality is as good or better IMO.<br /><br />Another option is Now Food Non-GMO Freeze Dried Corn -- but that is not organic. It tastes great, but I prefer organic.

review/text: If you have not tried these marvelous sweet yellow corn treats (and you don't mind paying the asking price), you will find one of the most delicious snacks made! I MUST ration my consumption of these, because I "could" easily eat a whole boxful in a week, or maybe a day. :) So, I saved a few dollars by using the "subscription plan". Now I should always have a supply. Another point, if you share a bag, be prepared to have that person "eat it all". Everybody loves this stuff. I don't know for sure what the process is to make this, but it is NOT full of chemical junk. It is literally like having the taste of whole kernel corn (with the water removed) in a bag. Very lightly salted, too.

review/summary: Eh? Not crazy about it.
review/text: Again I took plunge ordering 12 pack of snack I never tasted.  Is not that they taste bad, I guess they taste like corn, just not an exciting snack and a bit messy, is hard pick them up with fingers and not spill them, I've ending up with corn pieces all over, you might not want anyone eating this in your car esp if you're into keeping it really clean or anywhere that someone isn't over a table and being very careful.  Little pices of it slide off.  I think like regular corn I feel like they get stuck a bit in my teeth.  But being couple months post op jaw surgery I was able to eat these, they have a light crunch and a lil bit of sugar.  But when I'm craving a snack, my mind is just not craving this so much, but still prolly healthier than most of what's out there, might be good mixing with something else for variety.  Just after few bites I'm already sick of them. But could be good if you want a snack that doesn't leave you going out of control eating more and more.  You might want floss after these so makes them a pain if you're out and about and don't want feel like corn stuck in your teeth the rest of the day.

It's like eating sweet corn that's fresh off the cob but with a pleasantly light crunch!<br /><br />This corn snack is lightly salted and is 100 percent organic. It's all natural with no fat or gluten - just organic sweet corn and sea salt - produced in the USA.<br /><br />The 12-count pouches of sweet corn are shipped in a lightweight 'Sensible Foods' box.  This ensures that the contents remain intact.  Although sweet corn can take a fair amout of knocking around, I am always happy when care is taken to package products for shipping.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED: The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EYRBSQ">Apple Harvest snacks</a> taste great!

review/summary: Great Item, just so expensive
review/text: So I bought my first bag of Sensible Food's Sweet Corn today. I bought the bag for $2 dollars thinking that was way too much. For $2 I can buy a whole lot of born in the supermarket, well at least more than what was in the bag. I went to Amazon thinking if I buy in bulk I can save more, but nope it's around $2 a bag. Which is way too much. Great product, taste wonderful, just not worth the price.

review/summary: Best snack I've had in a long time!
review/text: I picked up a bag of these in an airport newstand shop... needed to find something light and tasty to take with me on the plane.  Wow, these are great!  The texture is very light, soft/crunchy, and the little bit of added salt make it PERFECT.  I am pleased to find them on Amazon and will be setting up a repeat order.  Wonderful!

review/summary: A bit of an after taste, but great snack alternative
review/text: My child didn't go crazy for these like I thought he would because he loves corn.  It is not hard at all, which is a bonus for small children.  It does have a bit of an aftertaste, but it's not unpleasant.  It's a great snack alternative to sweets.

review/summary: Not For Me
review/text: Everyone in my office loves these except for me.  It definitely does not suit my taste.  I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I really don't like the taste of these.  Since everyone's tastebuds are different, I recommend that you try them for yourself.

review/summary: Dried Fluff
review/text: It is mostly a bag of air, with an itty bit of freeze dried corn.  The corn is supposed to be "organic" but it had a slight chemical taste to it.  I think you're better off just snacking on a piece of fresh fruit, or some nuts.  It is a REALLY expensive way to get your vegetables.  The texture is sort of an "aquired taste" - dry and dusty.  Although this is considered "natural" there is very little actual nutritional value to this item.  You could probably make your own home made version of this with a food dehydrater at 90% lower price.  I took a class on dehydrating produce - just use the pilot light of your oven - put very thinly sliced fruits or vegetables on a cookie sheet - put it in the broiler section of your oven to dehydrate veggies and fruits.  I tried it at home as an experiment with corn fresh from the cob - and it worked fine.

review/summary: I use it  on everything
review/text: First what this is not, it is not Habanero powder.  It is what it says it is, it is hot salt.  Think of it as a really good reaplacement to seasoned salt.  In fact even though it does lean heavily on the salt, if you are a user of seasoned salt like I am, because of the heat, you will find that you use less of this than you do normal Lawrey's type salt.  It has a really good flavor and if you have never purchased this before the shaker is quite large.  Usually any Habanero based seasoning is pretty small, but because of the salt they are vert generous and even though I use this almost every day, the shaker will last 9-12 months.<br /><br />I still ordered two regardless of how long it lasts.  As I write this it does not qualify for Prime free shipping so if you order a second one it is like you get free shipping on one at least.

review/summary: Hot Salt Could Be Hotter
review/text: I have been looking all over for a hot salt to replace one that has apparently been discontinued.  The Habanero Hot Salt is adequate but not as hot as I would have liked.  I'm still searching but using this occasionally while looking.

review/text: This was a great sample of decaf k-cups which can be hard to find in most stores.  It has a good assortment of different roasts and a few flavors.  It came in a nice, organized box that made it easy to see what you have and make a selection.  I have enjoyed all of the varieties that I have tried.

review/summary: Decaf coffe sampler K-Kups
review/text: I am so glad that I purchased the sampler pack.  My Keurig coffee machine is a recent purchase. The sampler pack gave me the opportunity to trial different brands and blends to get an idea of K-Kup likes and dislikes.  None of the coffees were horrible, but I definitely learned which ones I liked and which I really didn't care for.  It's a great way learn the ropes of K-kupping. It was worth the price.

review/summary: Convenient but not Gourmet
review/text: I was looking for packets of dressing to take with me when I travel.  Recently I was on a trip and none of the restaurants had dressing for my salad that I wanted.  Everything available was a vinagrette which I do not like.  These are very handy and small enough to take anywhere.  Also very handy for taking a salad to work for lunch.  No need to refrigerate or have to mess up a storage container.  Flavor is satisfactory, but not gourmet.

review/summary: Kool-Aid Canister
review/text: If you drink alot of Kool-Aid, this is for you!!  I used to buy this at Sam's Club, but it wasn't always there.  My family goes through so much of this I can't just buy little packages and mix all day long!  This behemoth is the best!  We love it!  It's 9 1/4 inches tall and just over 5 inches diameter.  It already has the sugar in it.  It comes with a scoop inside.  And directions to make a glass or a pitcher.  It is so easy.  It's kind of big for cupboards.  But since we use it so often, I just leave it on the counter top.  Also, this IS a 2 pack.  So, the second one, I just set in my laundry room which is around the corner from my kitchen.  We are even on the the plan to have it sent to us every other month.  Seriously, if you drink alot, this is really wonderful!

review/text: I am the kool-aid, tang, and lemonade mom on the block. I order this product about 3 times a year for my family and my kids friends. The cannisters always arrive in great condition. The kool-aid mix is never clumpy as you would expect when shipped in heat or cold. The directions for mixing are clearly printed on the label and a scoop is included with each cannister. My youngest son prefers this over lemonade and it fills his sippy cup at least once a day.

review/text: I received this item as advertised, i.e. pack of 2.  No problems with quality nor quantity, just the containers themselves.  Either they were damaged prior to packaging and Amazon still shipped it as is or during actual shipping as neither container was effectively, securely packaged.  A quadrant of the top section of both containers was compressed.  No punctures/holes were found, so content was not compromised.

review/summary: To large package
review/text: I placed this order on April 7, 2009 the package did not arrive by delivery; the package was damaged in delivery. The single piece of tape that was place on top of the package was damaged. The box was splitting in half and the items almost came out of the bottom of the package. The items were damaged from the box being to large for them and the stuffing did not work.
