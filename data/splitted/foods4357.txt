review/summary: For my Dad
review/text: I bought this candy as a"happy" for my 89 yr old dad.  My mom said when he received it in the mail and opened it, he smiled real big, sat down in his chair, opened the bag, took a "slice" out, and closed hiseyes as he slowly chewed it(which brought a smile to my face).  This is one of his favorite candies.  He said it was fresh and sweet with a real orange taste.

review/summary: Light and Relaxing Tea
review/text: I love this tea. Granted, I am a very unsophisticated and uncouth tea drinker, but I still get an opinion, right?<br /><br />Pom & Petals has a subtle, gentle, floral taste to it, with a tiny hint of berry. I first tried it in a sample stacker tin and then had to order the full size, because I absolutely love it. When I take a sip it makes me think of shades of pink and Victorian gardens. It's one of those rare teas that works for me nearly any time of day - it's optimistic enough for the morning and afternoon, and relaxing enough for the evening. I love that it's caffeine free, as well as organic. And it comes in a cute reusable tin.<br /><br />But really, I love it for its flavor. It's romantic and subtle and flowery and fragrant. I'll definitely order it again.

review/text: I didn't get a chance to sample these organic cookies myself, but I sent a box to my sister in law as an advance Easter pick-me-up surprise and they have been a phenomenal hit. The cookies are delicious and look great, and  Beautiful Sweets has a whole variety of themes for year-round occasions.<br />One very minor issue, I wish the product page had specific information about shipping times. It took Beautiful Sweets about a week to ship my order; there's nothing wrong with that, but it would just be nice to know, especially when you're used to Amazon shipping everything so quickly.<br />On the positive side, they emailed with tracking number as soon as the package shipped.<br /><br />I will definitely be ordering more from Beautiful Sweets in the future. Sister In Law doesn't know it yet, but she's getting the Halloween special!

review/summary: A sugar-free vegetarian snack!
review/text: Note: This is a pre-cooked Moong dal SNACK. These are not the raw beans for cooking!<br /><br />I'm always on the lookout for healthy, sugar-free, vegetarian snacks. These taste great. I'm in love. They taste somewhat like a cross between potato chips and the crunchy fried onions you might find on green bean casserole. They're mildly salty, and not spicy at all (unlike some of the other Haldiran snacks). These do cause a bit of gas in the average person, so just be prepared. But they're easy to eat and I now carry them everywhere. I can't say enough good things about them. If they're sold out here on Amazon, they do sell these moong dal snacks at Indian grocery stores, if you happen to live near one. (That's where I first discovered moong dal.)

review/text: I'm usually pretty attentive when I make a purchase on Amazon.com. But not this time. When I purchased this, I thought that I was buying moong dal, the type you have to cook. Actually, this product is a crunchy snack. (Yes, I know now that it does say "Snack," but I wasn't paying a lot of attention.) This is dehusked split green "gram" or mung beans that are fried in vegetable oil. They are crunchy and salty. Not a bad snack, but I don't recommend this product, especially since there are five pouches, and I'll never eat them. I'm still working on the first bag. :)

review/summary: Bag of Beans Eaten by Beetles; Awful
review/text: I made the mistake of purchasing this bag on Amazon's "Subscribe and Save" deal, figuring it would be a good deal. Lesson learned. No returns allowed on "Subscribe and Save;" I learned that important point after the product arrived.<br /><br />The garbanzo beans were filled with bug holes and many of them are eaten away by beetles or whatever species of insect they are, still crawling in the plastic bag. How can someone clear this product for sale? Thee bug holes are clearly visible through the clear plastic bag and there is a pile of bug eggs/larvae/garbanzo dust at the bottom of the bag. Very disappointed. As if the bug infestation wasn't bad enough, many of the beans are also shriveled, meaning they won't re-hydrate properly. The beans also have a generally unfresh odor, as if they were sitting on a warehouse floor for months (which they probably were).<br /><br />I will not be purchasing any products from TASTE Specialty Foods again. Clearly, quality is not a hallmark of this company. Be warned.

YIKEs I thought I had made a huge mistake but I just went ahead and added straight milk to it - NO WATER!!!<br />Can you believe it - this stuff is GOOD! Coconut MILK hahah. I am sure you can pull this off with any milk product or almond, soy etc.. HEY maybe even COCONUT milk!<br />Oh and you know how I said sangria frothed up well?? WELL ... This frothed up SUPER easy!

review/text: This matcha kind of snuck up on me. At first, I wasn't sure if it was very coconut-y, and I was just sipping away. At the end of the cup, I found myself wanting so much more. It is SO coconut-y, which is funny since I found myself kind of going "where's the coconut?" at first. It's not a toasted, bake-y coconut, but a fresh young coconut taste. If I didn't know better, I would swear this was made with coconut milk instead of water!<br /><br />This is really a tropical vacation in a cup. Sweet, creamy, super fresh coconut flavor! It is the perfect combination with matcha, one of my absolute favorite flavors so far.

So, I love it when I find new and exciting flavors of Matcha - and Red Leaf Tea seems to be THE PLACE to get the newest and most exciting flavors available!<br /><br />This coconut matcha is really good.  I notice that my first couple of sips were not quite as enjoyable as my subsequent sips ... I guess my palate needed to acclimate to it ... but now that it has it is difficult to stop drinking it long enough to type in my thoughts about it.<br /><br />The coconut melds beautifully with the sweet flavor of the matcha.  Both are creamy, sweet flavors and together they create something that is beyond creamy and sweet ... it's absolutely scrumptious!

I lost a lot of weight the last time, eating this for breakfast and then for a late snack if I got hungry.  So when I saw the price of this hot cereal,  was hopeful that I had a winner.  However, it is absolutely awful.  It cooks up to a brown, pasty consistency and has a bitter-sweet aftertaste.  No matter if you thin it out a little and add your favorite low-carb milk + some Splenda, because it isn't sweet enough either....you can't help frowning when it gets into your mouth.  Yuckaduckdoooo!  If you buy this product, just order one box and try it first.  I'm stuck with 5 boxes that went straight to the trash!!

review/summary: Artificial taste and smell. Naturally flavored with other natural flavor (?)
review/text: This syrup is as fake as they come. There is absolutely nothing in it that has to do with a real raspberry fruit, not even remotely.<br />It tastes horrible, it smells a little bit better, it is full of bright red dye. Sugar free version has a weird aftertaste, though I have not tried a regular one in order to compare two.<br />If you care about what you consume, do not buy this. If I were told that for the rest of my life I cannot use sugar or use this in my drinks or as a food topping, I would go sugar free.<br />It is a pathetic excuse for a raspberry syrup. Honestly, a food for hummingbirds I bought earlier (Mills Brothers Hummingbird Food) has better ingredients and smells better than this.<br /><br />I cannot wait for the regulation agencies to enforce some kind of a standard for food related purchases made online.<br />To begin with, every product should clearly list all ingredients from the label (or having a photo of the back side of the label would be sufficient too).<br />Then, going step further, I would want all food companies to show % of every ingredient used in their products.<br />There is a reason why every 3rd American is considered to be obese. There is a reason why there are so many people with diabetes and other diseases. From 1980 through 2010, the crude prevalence of diagnosed diabetes increased by 176%(!). It is what we consume. Lately, we consume pretty much preservatives and different dyes while food companies shamelessly pocket extra profit.<br /><br />Ingredients for this DaVinci Raspberry syrup are<br />water, natural flavor, cellulose gum, sucralose (splenda brand), sodium benzoate (preservative), citric acid, red 40, blue 1<br /><br />The front label states "Sugar free Raspberry Syrup Naturally flavored with other natural flavor." You can add an extra line and write "which has nothing to do with raspberries or anything natural".<br /><br />All 3 bottles will go straight to the garbage. A costly mistake to make, but I cannot blame anyone but myself for buying this syrup without finding out what it consisted of.

review/text: called a colon (oops, I mean collon), well this is it!  Seriously though, I ordered these because, well, it's funny and the chocolate ones were not available (and those are REALLY funny).  I love the chocolate ones and wasn't really expecting much from the cafe au lait flavor.  Turns out these were super yummy--very sweet and much tastier than I was expecting.  I think I'd choose these over the chocolate ones from now on, which is saying a lot.<br /><br />Unexpectedly, Highly Recommended, and not just for the funny factor!<br /><br />JTG

review/summary: Actually tasty!
review/text: I have tried all the commercial brands of Hemp Milk. The second best to Tempt is Hemp Bliss by Manitoba Harvest, which is more "green" tasting. Tempt Unsweetened Original is delicious enough to drink straight with no grassy notes. After a few mornings of breakfast with Tempt, I feel like I am almost eating cereal with milk. By itself it is refreshing.<br /><br />What's greatest of all is that there are no pesticides or herbicides, and no GMOs and hemp is grown on sustainable farms. The ingredients are free of gums, preservatives, chemicals and flavor enhancers and this one has no sweeteners. The only real downside is, like almost every commercial producer, they insist on adding traces of cheap vitamins to produce an unbleak "Nutritional Analysis." I take exception to the addition of "Vitamin A Palmitate" in particular as having no health benefits whatsoever.

review/summary: Great Tasting Omega 3 Non-Dairy Milk Product
review/text: I really enjoy both Living Harvest Original Hempmilk Unsweetened along with Living Harvest Hempmilk Vanilla Unsweetened. Of all the Milks that I have tried (Almond, Coconut, etc.), these are my favorite for just drinking and for baking and cooking with. They are both Low Carb, which is a big plus, (only 1 Carb per cup of milk) (2) Two they both taste good,(It has a refreshing nutty taste, closer in taste to real milk)(3)three they don't have any sugar cane or any other sweeteners mixed in or any odd chemicals or ingredients that would be bad for you, which is a huge plus for me, and (4) Fourth I love the fact that it has Omega 3's packed naturally into the milk. Hemp naturally has its own Omega 3's, so it's not added it's there naturally. AND Omega 3's are really important for the brain. So, since I can't drink Raw Milk, because of Casein sensitivities. . .I now choose Living Harvest Original and Vanilla unsweetened to drink and cook with. I hope they will continue to make these two milks.

review/summary: Excellent alternative to milk for toddlers (and adults too!)
review/text: We switched to hemp when my milk supply dried up (daughter was 15 months old at the time, and she's 19 months now). She loves the taste. We can give it to her cold or heated. Before we found hemp milk, we tried cow's and goat's milk, which gave her a diaper rash. We tried rice milk too, but there are so many natural sugars in rice milk, so she was pooping more and therefore more prone to a rash. We haven't had any issues with the hemp milk (note that we only give her the unsweetened original kind, which has ZERO sugars). It's expensive, but worth it for the health benefits. Amazon has the best price by far, if you do the subscribe and save option. We go through a case about every 3 weeks. One carton fills about 3.5 8-oz bottles, and she usually drinks two bottles per day. Living Harvest is the only brand I've found online or in stores that has the unsweetened original version. All the other brands or varieties have sugars.

I was very pleased with the taste and texture of this product, and my wife and son loved it too! Tastes good in cereal, and if you throw some ice cubes and a bit of extra sweetener in it, it has a very nice milkshake-like taste. Will order again.

review/summary: Like The Product, Maybe Not Through Amazon Though
review/text: I ordered a case of this product because of the Subscribe & Save pricing in August 2011.  I have been drinking Tempt's hemp milk for a couple years, so I had already liked this product and there was no question about its taste.  However, when I received the order, one pack had a hole and its content had spilled.  1 out 12, still not a bad deal as far as its per-pkg price was concerned.  I threw away 1 package and cleaned 11 others.  By the time I finished all 11 packages in November 2011, I found 2 had already gone bad even though expiration was some time in 2012.  I thought my experience was an isolated case as well, but being apprehensive about my own, I just peeked into this website to see if anyone else had encountered something similar, bingo!  The Subscribe & Save reordering date is approaching, but I just now canceled the subscription.  It's unfortunate that the bulk-buying doesn't seem to work for this item and I need to start buying it from a local grocery store.

review/summary: Horrible experience
review/text: My wife bought this because she likes drinking Hemp Milk, but this purchase was bad.  I'm not sure if this is an isolated incident or not, but this experience was not good.  First, when the box arrived, at least one of the containers was broken as there was milk all throughout the box.  We did not report it to Amazon thinking it's just one and we could live with it.  But after a week or so, my wife noticed that at least a couple of the containers were bad already.  The expiration date on the containers say April 2012, but when she opened them to drink them, they were bad.  No where does it say to refrigerate before opening and even when we could find these in the stores, they were not always refrigerated.  We're not sure if we're going to order these again and I'd hope this is an isolated incident.

review/text: I was addicted to this kind of instant noodle when I was in Japan 2 years ago and since then I have been looking everywhere to find an instant kitsune udon.  Needless to say, I was very happy to find this on Amazon.  The noodles reheat to be perfectly soft, the fried tofu square is heavenly, and the soup base is also amazing - just as I remember it in Japan.  It certainly isn't healthy (97% of your daily sodium in one of these bowls), but it's perfect as a treat.  Even though I am giving this product 5 stars (because the instant noodles themselves deserve it), I will say that this product took nearly 2 weeks to get to me and they are kind of expensive with the shipping costs added on, so this was a bit annoying.  But next time I will just buy these in bulk.<br /><br />For anyone who hasn't had this type of instant noodle, buy it! Seriously, it will take you to a whole new level of deliciousness.

review/summary: A much-missed favorite.
review/text: A few years ago, my cats and I relocated to Germany. And while my four-pawed trio generally took the move in stride and quickly adapted to their new home in a manner that filled me with new love and admiration for them, there is one item now, several years later, still sorely lacking in their lives: Pounce Tuna Treats! For as long as we've been together (and in the case of the two females, that means their entire life), there has never been a better way to reward them or just show them my affection than by giving them some of these - my cats loved them, and I knew that due to the treats' many healthy ingredients I was actually doing something good for my kitties in addition to making them happy. But Pounce is nowhere to be found on the shelves of German stores! My cats are not overly picky in their food choices; they willingly accept almost everything appearing in their food bowls. But they have made it quite clear to me that a decent substitute for Pounce is yet to be discovered. In the meantime, what's a poor cat owner to do???

review/summary: terrible treat, but cat approved
review/text: The only good comment I can give on these treats is that my cat loves this stuff, and its really cheap! I can usually find these treats for under two dollars at the store and lasts a long time because I won't give my cats very many at a time. I only give them no more than 1-2 a day as apposed to the recommended 6-8, which is just crazy. It would be nice if pounce treats had healthier ingredients, maybe some vitamins or a dental cleanser, but no, its just junk food. They smell really gross to me but my cat loves it. My biggest reason for not liking this treat, aside from the terrible ingredients and smell, is the fact that it is soft and chewy and not crunchy. Soft treats reek havoc on pet teeth as the sticky particles just sit on their teeth and gums and just rot there. Crunchy treats at least crunch off and don't stick to their teeth. For a really good dental product, I recommend Crunch N' Clean brand with DentaShield. Greenies brand doesn't have a beneficial dental ingredient either, but they are crunchy and they do have vitamins in them, so they are much better than these.<br /><br />Pros: taste and price<br />Cons: smell, nutrition, and texture

I did not cook with them or bake with them so I cannot say what they would be like in that scenario. I can say they were very delicious just by themselves. In response to the reviews that the caramels were putrid or greasy, I must admit they were greasy and this is probably due to the butter used as a main ingredient. Overall, despite the fact that the grease from the caramels permeated the package, these things are quite tasty. I have not decided if this makes them worth the price, but the caramels are of the highest quality. So you decide! (Four stars for the price!)

While they might seem pricey, you get what you pay for- We feel the value is fair for the quality of the product. We'd rather feed quality raw foods to keep her healthy- because health is priceless... Stella and Chewy's understands the importance of a raw diet that is easy to handle and dispense... these little freeze dried steaks make AWESOME treats if broken into pieces, as well as a nice easy dinner if served whole. Terrific for traveling, convenient, really nutritious, and - most importantly- Abi loves them... no turned up nose EVER when we hand her a Stella and Chewy's steak!

review/summary: finicky yorkie puppy
review/text: My 9 month old Yorkie puppy is a finicky eater.  When he is in the mood, he gobbles down Stella & Chewy's dreeze dried patties.  He likes the beef the best, but will occasionally eat the duck-duck and chicken.  I have a friend who has larger dogs and they are on a raw food diet and love these patties.  Their coats are so shiny and I have found that my Yorkie's coat is beginning to also shine.

review/summary: Finicky senior kitty loves Stella and Chewy's products
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CIRMM">Stella & Chewy's Freeze Dried Dog Food for Adult Dogs, Lamb Patties, 32 Count, 16 Ounce Bag</a><br /><br />First time reviewing on Amazon so not sure on inserting links, but Stella and Chewy's is a terrific product. I was always curious about "raw foods" but was also very leery. For those in the fence who are interested for their cats or dogs, this product removes all the guess work. I am down to one cat now, a 17year basically healthy kitty, known by her finicky nature as she's had some health issues. I had tried another product which she sniffed at and walked away from, this stuff she LOVES even pulling the bag out from the cabinet. I give her about 1/4 a patty, with a traditional canned food, and she generally inhales it. If I put her bowl down without it, she sits and looks at me, plainly demanding "where's my Stella's" and does not eat until it's added.<br />4 stars as I have only been using it for about a month, but her coat and behavior is great, she's back watching out the window in the morning, she has tried the chicken and lamb so far and loves both. Patties are easily broken up and can be fed as treats or as a meal.<br />So far purchased locally but anticipate purchasing here, I got samples from a local pet shop initially.

review/summary: Awesome product. But CRAZY expensive.
review/text: My dog LOVES this stuff. He wasn't eating his regular food and I got this and crumbled one burger on top and he attacked it! Also he is a nervous stomach kind of dog but there was barely any upset when I introduced this food. Really amazing.<br /><br />After feeding frozen raw for years, i got tired of preplanning every meal (and sometimes forgetting...) so i switched to dehydrated raw--much easier! Just add water!<br />So I researched a lot of dehydrated raw dog foods and this one gets dogfoodadviser-dot-com five star rating. Really an excellent product.<br /><br />BUT--my small (20lb), moderately active, adult dog would eat 6 burgers per day. 12 burgers sells for $12+ per bag! (This item I'm reviewing is the double bag--a teeny bit less $) So I'd be paying around $40+ per week to feed him. It's pretty excessive. I'm not sure how they stay in business with these prices. Do they only sell to people with tea cup sized dogs? Not sure. But I know I wouldn't feed a Large or Giant dog this stuff. OMG it'd cost a fortune.<br /><br />Anyway, if you have the money, it's a really great product. If they ever lower the price, I'll give it 5 stars.

review/summary: Great Product But Expensive
review/text: I order one bag of the freeze dried beef patties to try.  I found these better than other freeze dried raw food products and my dogs loved them.  They come in a form I can store on the shelf and are easy to break up and mix with a little warm water to re-hydrate.  My only "beef" is the cost.  I would like to have some of this on hand for emergencies or travel but it is way to costly to feed on a daily basis.

review/summary: My picky eater LOVES this!
review/text: I'd been searching for a while for a food my picky little maltipoo would eat. Someone suggested a raw diet. I'd been trying the frozen Primal Raw food (also very good but requires enough forethought to defrost each day's portion overnight in the fridge) for a while and got a sample of this stuff. Not only did my dog eat it, he snatched right out of my hand and devoured it! He absolutely loves these. After just a week on this food, I can already tell he's feeling better. The sales clerk at the local doggie boutique said to start with these dry and work up to re-hydrating the patties.

review/text: I received a sample here in Los Angeles, and I couldn't BELIEVE that my toy poodle actually ate this!  She is the PICKIEST, worst eater, ever!  I've tried every dried and wet food imaginable, but the only thing she'll eat is real chicken or the occasional filet mignon piece.  I've talked to a few poodle owners who have the same (exact) feeding problem, but I can't keep giving her chicken because I know she's not getting the proper vitamins/nutritional value.<br /><br />The food looks a little gross, but hey, if she eats, I'm thrilled.<br /><br />I actually run the pieces under warm water in my hand, then break it up with a fork, add a tiny bit more water, place in the micro for 10 seconds (only) and it's good to go.<br /><br />I say give it a try!

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: My dog loves this stuff and I quite like it myself. I always try any food I'm going to give to my dog first. If its horrid I won't feed it to him. The difficulty is that I don't find most dog food that tasty and in consequence he mainly eats what we do. We eat lots of fish and he loves it. Turbot is his favorite but it's very expensive and sometimes it's not available at my store. Trout is also hard to find and getting all the bones out Is a pain. He's not a great fan of Talapia, or most farmed fish now I come to think of it. As for meat, he just loves a nice bit of steak. He prefers New York over Fillet which is strange, but there's no accounting for taste, right? Anyway back to this dried food. Dried is right! You really have to moisten this stuff. For a hurried snack rushing to work, I usually just pour some cold milk over it and scarf it down, but it's best if you save a little gravy from your Sunday roast.

review/summary: My Dog Is Addicted To These
review/text: I'm always on the hunt for a dog treat that my picky manchester will eat.  Most everything he will just turn his nose up and walk away.  One day I explained my dilemma to a sales lady at a dog product sales website and she sent me a free sample of Stella and Chewy's Beef Cookies.  Well, she knew what she was doing because my dog went crazy for these treats.  She made us a customer for life.  He is literally hooked on these!  I crumble one up in this dog food at every meal.  In fact, he will not touch his dog food if I don't put one of these cookies in it.  They are so expensive, and I've tried to break him away from them.  I've tried other treats.  I've tried looking for treats with similar ingredients.  He won't accept anything else.  So, now I am forced to keep him stocked in Stella and Chewy's Beef Cookies.  If you have a picky eater and you don't mind the extra cost, try these.

review/text: I have fed Stella and Chewy's to my six year old 14 pound Pekingese (his normal weight - a muscular, active dog) over the past year and he loves it. His coat is glossy, he is full of energy and has no health problems. In general, he is very picky when offered dog food and I have offered him many, many kibbles and moist dog foods (almost all were rejected). His appetite is excellent for roast chicken, grilled salmon, salads, etc. He also eats a semi-moist dog kibble daily (small dish). Very pleased.

review/text: I have two cavalier king charles spaniels who are pretty picky eaters.  The only way to get them to eat is to mix this freeze dried in with it.  Personally I take the time to mix in a little hot water to reconstitute it and then mix it with kibble.  My wife just sprinkles some on dried.  Either way they love it.  It's a little pricey, but we only use half a disk at a time to mix in with kibble.  So it lasts.

review/summary: Wonder-food!
review/text: I have an extremely picky 20 lbs French Bulldog/Boston, it took a year to find a food that she would actually eat on a regular basis...that is up until 2 weeks ago, when she just refused to eat. I went to a wonderful natural dog food place and they gave me samples of this along with others. To my shock she gobbled it ALL up and then proceeded to look for more! It is very pricey, but is worth it! It recommends feeding a 20 lbs about 5 pattys/day. To cut that down, I have been feeding her 1-2 pattys soaked in water (then mushed up) and mixed into her dry food. I highly recommend this product (and Dr. Becker Bites - treats) for any picky eaters and caring owners!

review/text: This was a pricey gamble because my 4lb chihuahua is a very PICKY eater. She now gets excited at meal times & wont eat anything but this food. Yes its expensive but its cheaper then having to throw out food cause she wont eat it & shes not that big so she eats only 2 patties a day max. If you have a small picky eater this is GREAT & seems to be very healthy. If you have a large dog this might be a healthy thing to add to their dryfood (not to mention a nice way to spice up their food). I highly suggest the freeze dried Duck, Duck, Goose Stella & Chewy's version. I tried the frozen version & my dog wasnt as interested.

I too did not get the organic product.  I have seen it in the stores, and it has a much lower sodium content per serving.  I haven't been able to find it in a while so I thought I would buy it through Amazon.<br /><br />The product was the old stuff with an expiration date of 6 months from now.  Usually the product in the store carries and expiration date of a year, so that tells you something right away.<br /><br />The noodles are okay.  My family is not that particular, so it's a good side dish on ocassion.  If you are an expert on peanut noodles, this dish is not for you.  It's slightly gummy and thick.

review/summary: Not as heathful of a snack as you might think
review/text: The good news is that the peanut butter flavor of these granola bars is really good.  When I first bit into one, I immediately thought I was eating a peanut butter cookie.  They're very reminiscent of a Girl Scout peanut butter cookie, minus the cream filling of course.<br /><br />That brings me to the bad news.  While a serving of these granola bars has a tad less fat and sugar than a cookie, the difference isn't great.  If you don't believe me, just look at the nutritional information for a Nutter Butter cookie here.  That doesn't mean that this isn't a good snack to have on occasion.  These are a healthier alternative than a candy bar, for example, but they're really not much different than a cookie.  In other words, even though most people would equate granola bars with health food, one must be careful not to overindulge in these.

review/summary: The brightest star in the Heaven of Nature Valley Granola Bars - which are the best in the Universe!!!
review/text: For an earlier reviewer, I don't see anywhere on the package where it is claimed that this is a "health food". However, whole grains should be an important part of our diets, and I'll bet your Girl Scout cookies and the Nutter Butters are not made with whole grains. I love peanut butter and I really appreciate how much peanut butter flavor there in these granola bars, but the calories per serving are only 180. For anyone who has never had a Nature Valley granola bar, they come 2 in a pouch and 2 are considered one serving. In size I would say the pouch would equal 4 small/medium cookies. A tip on the crunchiness: These almost crumble when you bite into them, and depending on where you are eating, that can be inconvenient. Here is what I do with ALL of the NV granola bars, whether I'm at a table, in a recliner, or driving down the road. First, I break both the bars into 3 crosswise. I then break each of those thirds once, crosswise. Then I open the pouch along the lengthwise seam. There are far fewer "crumbs" left in the pouch then you would have created preparing to and eating them any other way I can think of.<br />Thank you AMAZON, and thanks for the new subscription service. I live in a very remote area and it is a real crap shoot what flavors will be in the stores any given week.

Must be a bad batch or the way they're stored that made them this way. Beware of buying in such quantities if you haven't purchased a particular food product from Amazon before.

review/summary: I love these - but the ones from Amazon were stale tasting
review/text: I get these from the grocery store all the time, so getting them in bulk made sense. The first one I ate tasted stale - it was super hard to bite into and had that stale texture, like moisture got into it. I thought "oh no!" my bars had been compromised! The next one I ate was totally normal - crunchy and fresh. ??? I would say about half of the shipment was stale (although the expiration date was for next year) When I open a stale one, I give it to my husband who doesnt seem to care as much, but he definately notices the weird texture also.

review/summary: Thrilled that these are gluten free!
review/text: These aren't the healthiest of snacks, but they are conveniently portable and tasty--and gluten free. They're one of the few easily-available granola bars out there that have no gluten OR whole nuts/seeds (thank you, gluten intolerance and diverticulosis). I kind of wish they would package the individual bars separately for when it's just me, but they're a perfect quick snack for two people.

review/summary: Great for lunch packers, a little hard
review/text: I have these on subscribe and save since we go through so many. They are a great, easy, snack to either pack in lunches, or to grab when you are on the go. Sure, they may not be a health food, but at least they are a filling snack that can tide you over to the next meal.<br /><br />They are quite hard so it'd be nice if they were a little softer, but nonetheless I still enjoy them. I enjoy how they have real peanut butter slathered around the outside of them. Overall, a tasty snack for a good price, especially when you use subscribe and save.

review/summary: I crave these more than candy bars
review/text: They are THAT good. They are a mouthful of crunchy, peanutty, deliciousness!  In fact, I went through an entire box in less than one week.  If you really want to be bad, smear some peanut butter on these, and you'll be hooked for life.<br /><br />I actually ordered a case of the same type of bars, but the Barbara's Bakery brand because I like eating organic.  They're really good, too, but I must say that they're not as scrumptious as these.

review/text: Many of our troops try to eat healthy and would rather have granola bars than candy and this was a great item to buy in bulk from Amazon to send to them.

review/summary: HARD AS BRICKS
review/text: I can barely eat one of these without risk of breaking a tooth.<br />I think they have been sitting around too long.<br />I was expecting crunchy. I received rocks.

review/summary: Filling Snack - Highly Recommended
review/text: These Nature Valley "Crunch Granola Bars, Peanut Butter" are a tasty mid-afternoon snack and are filling enough to hold me over until dinner. These are, as the name suggests, very crunchy and can be a little messy (crumbs) when eating. Since these are somewhat dry, they also travel well in the heat or in a pocket.<br /><br />My kids will eat these in place of candy, which is another plus, but these are too hard for my wife who has sensitive teeth.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Great granola bar!
review/text: I absolutely love these bars. Like the other review said it is gluten and dairy free which is hard to find these types of food that actually taste good! They may be a little high in fat and calories but they fill me up most days. They are a bit hard to bite into at times, but great on the go bar for breakfast. They do make quite the mess when eating in the car but that is easy to get over! Great for the price too.

review/summary: Good and convenient snack
review/text: I tried these based on other reviews and am glad I did. However, I am a little disappointed in that the peanut butter flavor isn't stronger. But otherwise, they taste great and are a great alternative to snacks at work or on the road. I like these a lot but would love them if the flavor were stronger.
