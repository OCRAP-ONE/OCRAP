review/summary: Seedlings didn't grow
review/text: Although 8 / 10 germinated (indoors in earth plugs), the seedlings didn't do too well. Most of them didn't survive transplant. Perhaps I should have sowed them directly in soil. But the seeds are too expensive to order again. Sad because I would have loved to see these geranium bloom.

review/text: Got two orders of these around Christmas.  Arrived Quickly.  Put them in a decorative jar that I had saved from a gourmet jar of Kalamatas bought previously somewhere else.  I put them in fridge, use them in greek salads, and mediterranean pasta salad I make all the time.  No pits, great flavor, great portion value,  highly recommended.

review/text: I eat these on salads or just as a snack. You get a big bag and dump the whole thing, juice and all (drain off some of the juice), into a large tupperware container that I keep in the fridge. Olives stay fresh and delicious for a month or two. Every now and then you find an olive that still has a pit in it but it's like 1/1,000 olives.

They loved them too & will be ordering more in the future.  I used to buy them in small jars at publix and we would go through the jar in 1 day. Now that we can buy them in bulk at Amazon, we add them to salads & throw them in with just about any meat or vegetable we are cooking.

I'm not even sure they were<br />packed in vinegar ... tastes like water.<br /><br />I can't very well return them ...<br />but I will NEVER purchase these again.<br />A waste of my $50.<br />I can only remark, "What happened?"<br /><br />I will try to contact the seller ...<br />if not to get a refund, then to at least let them<br />know someone has messed up badly.

review/text: I love kalamatas. I had a honey moon in Greece last year and tried the freshest local kalamatas. I know which type of kalamata I enjoy more at the olive bar in my local supermarket. So when I saw this deal I had to give it a shot.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these kalamatas are only average-low quality in my opinion. They have a more bitter taste than most, and when I tried the first one I was surprised by it. Wish I could say they are tasty, but at least you get a lot for the price.

review/text: The olives are excellent but you need to repackage them as soon as you open them.  I bought some pretzel nuggets and used that jar.  There wasn't enough liquid to cover the olives once I transferred them to a jar so I added olive oil but it thickens up like butter in the refridgerator.

review/summary: The "Green Pearl" of Tea.
review/text: Gunpowder tea is green tea, most of which comes from a city named Pingshui in the Eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, south of the Yangtse River Delta, where it has been cultivated for centuries and is known as the "green pearl" of tea. Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area's gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself "home of silk and tea" for its two primary natural products.<br /><br />The name "gunpowder" derives from the tea's elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.<br /><br />Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream.

Numerous attempts to notify the company and request a replacement were ignored, so my advice to anybody ordering from this company: 1. read the description carefully, 2. order with the intention of never returning the product, and 3. be prepared for slow delivery.

A big let down, no one seemed to know anything about them, we searched the entire store to no avail. I'm very happy to learn Amazon and other sites do have them. They are the best lemon wafers you could hope for, wonderful mild lemon flavor and crispy wafers. I didnt realize they were from Italy until I read the small print back side the package. That tells the story why they are heavenly good. Keep them coming Amazon!!

Yes, it is true lemon flavor, and I found myself reaching in the bag for more. They are especially refreshing when put in the refrigerator.  It is surprising to know that the larger stores (in my home area) do not carry these, while the smaller, remote store (miles away from home) is the one to sell such an excellent treat. I was glad to find that Amazon.com offered this product, and I will be trying their other flavors, also.

review/text: I love this brand and hate buying single packs,  because we go through it at the rate of knots...  I find it refreshing and just chewy enough - strong enough to be interesting,  soft enough to actually chew,  and the flavor lasts for ages.  I've bought this size before but can't get to that place anymore and then found them on amazon and snapped them up.  To be honest,  I can't recall what I last paid for them,  but under $12 feels reasonable for 40 packs of gum (approx 30 cents per pack of 5 sticks).  I even like the 5 pack size,  the larger sizes start to fall apart in my bag and I end up with gum covered in weird bag lint (never a good thing!)  These ones feel more under control.<br /><br />So very happy that amazon carries them and will buy from them again.

review/summary: Best Almond Biscotti
review/text: These Ghiottini brand almond biscotti are the best-tasting biscotti I have ever tried. Loaded with real almonds, the ingredients are all legible and natural, which seems like a rarity these days. Similarly, I recommend Cantuccini brand "almond cookies," or biscotti. These gourmet Italian imports are the finest and make great gifts.

review/summary: Truly Sugar Free = NO maltodextrin! Yummy in Pumpkin Spice Tea
review/text: I have a strong family history of type 2 diabetes and though for the past 10 years, I've mostly eaten foods with good glycemic index ratings, despite my efforts, recently I was diagnosed with type II diabetes.<br /><br />It's very hard to find anything sweet that is truly safe for diabetics because many products that call themselves sugar-free contain maltodextrin - like powdered sugar free jello, sugar free liquid coffee creamers, etc. Just last week I had to have some labs done and some days I noticed my BG (blood glucose) ratings were all over the place though I had not thought I'd eaten or drank anything that was on my list of foods to avoid. On the day I had the labs I'd only had fat free clear chicken broth and sugar free Jello that I made from a box mix. For some reason my BG was high. How?? When I'd only had jello and chicken broth for over 24 hours (I was a bit under the weather so that's why I was eating almost nothing).<br /><br />Anyway, I had the lab test my BG on their lab equipment and from the same blood sample I used my meter. The meter said 183. The lab test was 186! I later found out it was from the maltodextrin in the jello. Even the powdered Splenda that measures like sugar has maltodextrin in it. If you are ingesting maltodextrin, then your pancreas is working to "clear" it from your body just as it would have to do with table sugar is what I've been told by my endocrinologist. My GP (general practitioner) doctor didn't mention that, nor did my diabetes educator. I'm not sure they even know.<br /><br />Sorry for all the "extraneous" info but I just think it's important info to know if you are diabetic, pre-diabetic, have family history of diabetes or just don't want to burn out the beta cells in your pancreas then AVOID maltodextrin. According to the ingredient list, this product does not use maltodextrin.<br /><br />I ordered this syrup because I love the taste of brown sugar and thought I'd eventually find a use for it. It's okay in coffee but it's absolutely YUMMY in Stash brand Pumpkin Spice tea. It's like having a dessert and for me, it totally satisfies when I want something sweet. Since the tea is caffeine free and the syrup truly is safe for me, I can have it pretty much whenever I want.<br /><br />So long as they keep making this, I'm going to buy it.

review/summary: Strange Aftertaste
review/text: I received very good service from Amazon and fast shipping through Prime when receiving this product. However, I was not as satisfied with the syrup itself. In comparison to Torani's other sugar free syrup's, I would say that the brown sugar cinnamon variety is lacking. Whenever I use it in hot cocoa or coffee I get this strange sour and slightly bitter aftertaste. I have tried using less of the syrup to avoid this, but I then find that I can't taste the brown sugar cinnamon flavor at all. I was a bigger fan of the hazelnut sugar free syrup, which is probably what I will go back to after I finish off my supply of this flavor.

review/text: I use the Torani syrup to flavor my morning oatmeal.  I had been using carmrl and chocolate flavors, but wanted to try a different flavor.  The brown sugar cinnamon is pretty good - but not my favorite (I like the chocolate the best).  I was surprised that these bottles were quite a bit larger than the 750 ml bottles I had been getting.  Hence the reason for the slightly greater price.

review/text: My husband and I just started Atkins so we've purchased quite a few of the Torani Sugar Free syrups. I thought this one would be one of our favorites, but so far, I just haven't really found anything that it's great in.. I tried it in a MiM (muffin in a minute), but the taste is really mild..I can barely tell it's there.. I tried it in an italian soda...not good at all... I mixed it with softened cream cheese for a "frosting" on a cinnamon MiM, but again, the taste is really mild, hardly noticable... It does taste like brown sugar and cinnamon, but it's just so mild, if I didn't know what it was, I don't think I'd be able to tell by tasting it... My husband said it was good, but asked what flavor it was.. When I told him, he said "really?"...he said he'd never guess that one..<br /><br />Wish I hadn't purchased 3 bottles.. Hope this stuff lasts a long time cause that's how long it will take to use it.

It doesn't have a weird aftertaste, and really does have a delicious brown sugar taste.

review/summary: Excellent flavor
review/text: As some others have said, this is one of my favorite sugar-free flavors if not my new favorite. As with all the sugar-free varieties, I find that I need to use less in order to keep the artificial sweetener taste from overpowering, thus allowing a little less actual flavor to shine through versus the sugar varieties. Even so, you still get quite a kick of tasty brown sugar/cinnamon flavor with this syrup.<br /><br />Used it so far in cappuccinos, Pellegrino, and oatmeal all with good results. Also tried it with spiced rum and it didn't work well, perhaps my ratio was too high. Tasted like drinking an air freshener. I think if I dial it back, it will work better, or maybe a different combination. Most of the other syrups work very well in cocktails.<br /><br />This variety will be regularly stocked in my kitchen from now on.

review/summary: Great source of black sesame for Chinese medicine believers!
review/text: If you're familiar with chinese medicine/herbs, you'll know that it's believed that (black) sesame seeds are great sources for hair and vision health.  However, it is very hard to make it into my normal cooking because you can only put a little bit of it in the dishes, not enough to make any impact.  I'm very glad to have found this snack.  It's simple, pack with black sesame seeds and not too sweet.  I'm able to eat a few pieces a day without worrying about the sugar content.  I've ordered two batches now and have shared with my parents.  They loved it too! On another note, sesame seeds are supposed to taste like sesame seeds.  If you don't like or are not familiar with the sesame seeds taste, you should not buy this large package.  Mrs. May's snacks all have pretty original taste and I'm glad that they're not trying to add other stuff/flavoring to make it taste "better" or like something else. I'm glad they've made it in a way so that people who do like it can eat more without taking in other unhealthy ingredients at the same time.

review/summary: Steep too Long and It's Bitter
review/text: The mint in this tea is very good, but it's not the oily strong mint that I get with some flavored teas. The mint leaves are dried and they are a bit weak. When steeped for too long or if too much tea is used, the tea gets very bitter. However, I can put in a spoonful of the leaves in the hot water, and refill or top off the cup two more times without losing major flavor of the tea.<br /><br />This mint teas is wonderful for after dinner. I love the way it seems to settle my stomach. It's become a regular after-dinner tea. I received it as a gift, and while I have tasted some teas with a stronger, oilier mint flavor, this one is nice in that it doesn't have the essential oil floating in it that can sometimes irritate the lips or the stomach. This has the real mint leaves dried in the tea to steep. Adding a few sprigs/leaves of fresh mint to the tea and lightly mottling/crushing them in the cup right before adding the water makes a huge difference and really enhances this tea.<br /><br />But even without that, this is a great tea, high quality green tea, delicate flavor. Just don't use too much of the tea so it doesn't get bitter. As for steeping time, I just throw the spoonful in with the hot water loose, so I steep it the whole time I'm sipping it and it doesn't get bitter or lose flavor at all. I prefer that to using a strainer or bag for brewing. I love drinking tea and herbal mixes loose like that.<br /><br />I think most people, especially for the price, will like this tea if they like mint teas in general.

review/text: This tea is great, but alas, it has a big flaw for me, there is a lack of strong mint flavoring in this mix. I definitely expected a strong mint taste mixing well with the green tea, but there's a lack of mint taste here. You can see the leaves in there, but the taste is lacking.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a great green tea. I suggest steeping it for longer than the directions say, but definitely not longer than 3 minutes. Maybe even adding a bit of spearmint herbal tea will help?

review/summary: TRICLOPYR is the "GOOD STUFF," killls Poison Ivy DEAD!
review/text: This contains Triclopyr, which is more aggressive than Glyphosate.  It is also more persistent which means that you don't want to spray it close to plants you value.<br /><br />Triclopyr is what you need to knock out Poison Ivy. Poison Ivy and a lot of other shrubs or trees can take a swig of Glyphosate (Round Up), gargle twice with it and spit it back into your face just for giggles.  I've used this and the Bayer Brush Killer Plus.  They contain the same active ingredient and I haven't observed any significant difference.<br /><br />This stuff is the real deal - I found it when I was trying to locate a product called Vine-X (discontinued?) and found out that it was 13.6% Triclopyr in a penetrating oil.  You simply brush it onto cuts or active vines and it would kill the entire plant.<br /><br />This is where it is really nice to buy the concentrate instead of the pre-mix.  I spray the diluted version but also use the concentrate in a small bottle.  If I cut a thicker vine or trunk, I simply drip the concentrate on it and it will kill the roots and vine.  Besides PI we also have wild grapevine, Buckthorn, Box Elder, and many other invasive and nuisance plans in the woods.<br /><br />Because Poison Ivy is a creeping vine with multiple roots along it's length, eradication is helped with a higher concentration than the label instructs. (My observation) I use it between 50% to 100% (double) strength.<br /><br />It appears that if you spray it in one spot you will kill that part of the vine, but if you hit it (in enough places) with something strong enough you can kill the whole plant down to the roots.<br /><br />Make sure you spray it when you think it won't rain for at least a couple of days or else you will probably need to spray it again. Make sure you get all "sprouts." From extensive hand pulling, My observation is that for every "sprout" there is another ~3 feet of vine lurking around and another sprout hiding somewhere nearby.<br /><br />If you've found this review helpful please let me know! iew helpful please let me know!

I used the specified dilution. Brush-B-Gone has completely killed the plants and roots; every year needs a little maintenance because birds eat poison ivy seeds from other places and make new little seedlings. Brush-B-Gone is also very selective; I have not had any neighboring plants die, and there is sometimes a little bit of overspray. It's also effective for other invasives I have: bittersweet and porcelain berry. Plus it is also a terrific stump rotter. I had a tree stump 3 feet in diameter. Wanting to save $1000 and not hire a stump grinder, I painted the concentrate directly across the stump. Six months later it was completely denatured into punky fluff, and was easily chopped out with a mattock.<br /><br />Brush-B-Gone has disappeared from my local store's shelves, not sure why.

review/summary: Nice change of pace
review/text: I have my kitchen stocked with all kinds of ramen/ramyuns and this is a nice change of pace when I want noodles without the broth. I usually mix the sauce components in the bowl I'm going to be eating out of and add a few tablespoons of the liquid I used to boil the noodles in to it. Just have to add the drained noodles and mix. I only use about three tablespoons of water to get the sauce the consistency I like, but you can add more/less depending on how you like it. This noodle is traditionally eaten with a side of slices of pickled radish (the yellow stuff you might find at your asian grocer). If you don't have pickled radish, you might enjoy it with a side of sliced cucumbers or other fresh vegetable because the sauce might be kind of heavy. I find this sold at my store for $5.99 per pack of five so the price on Amazon is not bad.

review/summary: And now for something different... (and oily)
review/text: A longtime fan of Nong Shim's excellent and popular spicy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LQLV7E">Nong Shim Shin Noodle Ramyun</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LQJT5K">Nong Shim Kimchi Noodle Ramyun</a>, I was curious to try something different. And different it is. This is the first Nong Shim product I didn't take a liking to right away.<br /><br />Chapagetti is "chajang" + "spaghetti", chajang myun (noodle) being a Korean interpretation of a Chinese dish. Chajang literally means "fried sauce". It's a thick, black, soybean paste that's slightly sweet. For the instant version, Nong Shim replaced the paste with a mix-in powder. Inside the bag are 3 flavoring packs: a packet of sauce powder, an oil packet, and a dehydrated vegetables packet. Preparation is easy. Just add the vegetable pack to the noodles when cooking, drain, then add the other 2 packets and stir well before eating. The instructions say you need to boil the noodles in a pot for several minutes, but just pouring boiling water on the noodles and letting them rehydrate works just as well. I add the vegetable pack after I've drained the noodles so as not to pour it all out accidentally with the water. The residual heat and moisture will reconstitute the ingredients.<br /><br />The first time I tried this, I added everything. It tasted very oily and the powder seemed to be too much compared to the quantity of noodles. The noodle platform is hearty, thick, and elastic, like Nong Shim is well-known for, but I particularly dislike the oil because it made them greasy and runny. Now, I add half a bag of the powder and discard the oil, saving a few calories along the way and cutting down on some sodium. The tangy taste is very similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OEH48W">Myojo Ippei-chan Instant Yakisoba Noodles</a> and other Japanese instant yakisoba because of the same Chinese culinary influence.<br /><br />Chapagetti contains less than 1/2 the sodium of the regular spicy Nong Shim ramen, so as a quick meal, it's not as bad for you. You can also add cooked cabbage and slices of chicken or other meats to bulk up the meal and make it more filling, as well as improve the nutritional value.<br /><br />Verdict: still a good noodle, but it may not be what some shoppers are expecting.

review/summary: Great noodles with lower sodium
review/text: This is my favorite Nong Shim to date. It not only tastes great but also has about half the sodium content of the others (40% vs. >90% for whole package). It's not healthy per se, but is probably a lot better for you. The dried veggies seem more substantial than the mere onion flakes in the other packs; this one has carrots, some tofu-like pieces, and green things. The sauce is also more savory than salty which is a good change of pace. Just be warned that it's korean style chajang noodles with a dark sauce. The sauce is a bit difficult to mix evenly and tends to clump up, so sprinkle it evenly on the noodles when you mix rather than just dumping it all on one spot.

With that said, for about $1 a pack (or less), these are AWESOME. Great texture, consistency, and flavor.<br /><br />A tip for you all: Don't boil the water first and then add the noodles. I recommend having the noodles in the cold water as you bring it up to a boil. For some reason it adds another level and the noodles come out tasting better.

I have to say that I am addicted to it though, but the taste does not appeal to everyone.  It is definitely worth a shot if you can find a single package rather than buying 20 on amazon if you might not like it.  That being said, this is my favorite nong shim ramen!

I sprinkle some pepper powder, and it boosts the flavor.  :)

review/summary: Its OK
review/text: Maybe it's due to my tendency to prefer noodles with a little more "kick", but I found this product to be very bland and not very flavorful.  Of all the noodles produced by Nong Shim, this is my least favorite. The flavor is extremely subtle (it almost has a chocolate taste!) and its almost like eating noodles plain.  If you like even mildly spicy noodles you will probably not like this at all and I would suggest going with any other flavor -- they are all good.<br /><br />This honestly is the very first Nong Shim noodle that I was disappointed with and I've tried a lot of them.  Of course with food its all subjective.  If you don't mind a very subtle flavor you might like this.  I would recommend finding a single packet to try before you buy a package of 20, unless your tastes lean toward the less flavorful side.

review/summary: If you think it taste bad you are probably not preparing it in the right way
review/text: I bought a 20 pack bundle of this noodle. I make it the way I usually do to a normal instant noodle and hated its taste, but wait! It was not until the last couple packs when I realized THE CORRECT WAY to make these noodles, and they are delicious if you make it the right way.<br /><br />Notice that it is called Chajiang noodle, which means it's not noodle in a soup.The right way to make the noodle is, you put the noodle in a bowl, pour in boiling water and wait. Don't put in the seasoning package yet. When the noodle is ready, pour out the water, and then add the pack of seasoning. The remaining moisture on the noodle will turn the powder into a thick sauce, and you mix well and serve. It's the same way you make Low-Mein if you know what I am talking about.<br /><br />So, this is actually good-tasting noodles if you read the instructions on the package and do it correctly. Sadly, sometimes we are like "I feed on instant noodles since I was 5 and I know how to make them", and we don't read the instructions...I hope you can try the method I mentioned above and enjoy it ^-^

review/text: These noodles came out of the microwave smelling fantastic. I then strained off a lot of the water down to what seemed right, and added the soup base and oil packets. I tried a bit of each of these and the soup base had a taste simlar to cocoa at the time, and the oil tasted nice as well. I was quite intruiged to get things together and see how it tasted.<br /><br />It tasted utterly fantastic. I am not sure how people could not like these noodles, but then again I am not a picky eater. At the same time though, these are probably the best tasting packaged noodles I have had, alongside others such as Shin Ramyun and etc. These also have left me full for several hours.<br /><br />Some reviewers say that you may not like these if you are not Asian, but I am not and love them nonetheless. It might depend on how much Asian cuisine you have eaten and how picky you are though. Those who generally eat Westernised Asian dishes like general tso's may be in for a surprise; pleasent or otherwise. :D<br /><br />Five stars for being tasty and quality packaged noodles. Cannot ask for much more at this price.

review/summary: Couldn't love it more
review/text: One of the comfort foods of Korea. I rarely have time to make the original recipe from scratch (pure heaven)but this a very good fast meal.<br />Some of the reviewers downgraded it because they don't like the taste of black bean sauce. I keep a container of it from the local Korean store on hand at all times.
