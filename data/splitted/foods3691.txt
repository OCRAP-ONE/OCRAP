review/summary: Taste GREAT
review/text: These bars are very good for you with an awesome taste!! I love them, I try to eat one for breakfast every day and already have lost a little weight. I wouldn't recommend eating more than 1 per day because of the fiber, well you know!! But they are delicious!! Peanut Butter isn't my favorite flavor but is very good!! I love the caramel ones the best!

Certainly better then a candy bar but the inclusion of High Fructose Corn Syrup among other things ruins the health value.

review/summary: High fiber isn't necessarily a good thing!
review/text: I recently cut fiber one bars out of my diet after I noticed that I get all the fiber I need in a day just by eating whole wheat bread, fruits, vegetables and nuts. If you don't have many of the aforementioned foods in your daily diet, then one or two of these a day may be a good fiber supplement. However, this comes at the cost of making you extremely gassy all through the day, which can be embarrassing and sometimes even annoying when it's more frequent than the occasional toot that slips out. IMHO, it's better to get the daily dietary fiber your body needs via the more natural means that I mentioned above.<br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind, especially when dieting, is that these bars are pretty high in sugar. (As much as 10g added sugar per bar!) Considering a "healthy" amount of added sugar per day maxes out at about 40-50g per day, eating a few of these bars will chew right through that cap in no time. There's also emerging research showing that eating high-sugar foods (like fiber one bars) will make you crave more sweets, leading you to eat or drink even more unhealthy things like candy bars and sodas. So if you're on a diet, eating these bars probably aren't as great for your diet as you think!<br /><br />I've been fiber one free for two weeks now and I'm happy for the decision. (And so are my friends!)

review/summary: Fiber-None Bar
review/text: Fiber one bars actually don't have real fiber.  They contain inulin (from chicory root) which is technically fiber because the body can't digest it.  Unfortunately fiber is defined by anything that can't be broken down easily.  These bars do not contain REAL fiber. (The real fiber usually found in whole grain breads and cereals) So if it says "chicory root" or "inulin" in the ingredients, you can be sure you aren't eating the fiber your body can actually use.  So if you want lots of sugar and fat without fiber, this bar is for you.

review/text: Panda Bars is a candy my husband remembers loving from childhood and it has now become a favorite of mine and my 2 year old son also. These arrived quickly and now I wish I had ordered 2 boxes because at the rate we are eating these, they will be gone within a week! The Panda Bar's main ingredients are Molassess and Wheat flour - you won't find any high fructose corn syrup in there! I consider other brands like Twizzlers to taste waxy and hard whereas these Panda bars have a nice chewy texture. I love having a box around so I can make sure the diaper bag is stocked with these ready to eat snacks. I like that my 2 year-old son considers these a special treat and I have no guilt about letting him enjoy one. These are sold locally but they are cheaper to order by the box on Amazon.

It's technically edible and it's technically peanut brittle, so I guess I won't worry about returning it, but I don't like being misled.<br />Product is a bag of brittle pieces shipped inside a box, someone mentioned it arriving smashed up, well honestly, I think it was supposed to arrive somewhat smashed up and not as a solid sheet which is what I think that reviewer and I were both wanting.

review/text: This Old Dominion Peanut Brittle tastes fine the way it is but... ever since my teeth fell apart and several expensive dentist/oral surgeon appointments were mandatory (along with a couple emergency surgeries and potential hospital visits if said oral surgeon wasn't working at the time- thank God it never got to THAT point and he hadn't gone home yet!) I haven't really been feeling much of a desire or craving for brittle.  In fact just the name of it makes my teeth quiver.  Just the thought of biting down on peanut brittle sends a sharp chill through the few teeth that have remained.  My imagination runs wild and I think about what would happen if my teeth were to suddenly shatter.  No more eating anything.  Anyway, this is actually really good brittle.  Just... I can't eat it anymore. :(  Alright, maybe I can still slide a little bit of brittle in my mouth when I'm in one of my "Who cares how my teeth feel tomorrow?" moods, but these are very rare times. :)

review/summary: Loses flavor SUPER FAST; but good tasting while it lasts
review/text: My dentist recommended Spry, so I thought I'd give it a chance. It's pricier than most of the sugarfree gums I frequent, but it came recommended by an oral expert, so I figured it would be worth a try.<br /><br />NOT WORTH IT.<br /><br />Literally, after less than 4 minutes, the flavor is completely gone, and the gum itself reverts to a stale, slightly metallic, tough-to-chew state of existence. I'm not sure how much teeth cleaning the Xylitol in the gum itself is doing because it seems to lose flavor so fast. Correct me if I'm wrong, but xylitol is a sweetener, so if the sweetness of the gum is lost after a good (or bad?) 3 minutes, then there really wasn't that much Xylitol to begin with?<br /><br />Also, further research showed that you actually need more xylitol than the amount in the gum itself before it proves to be beneficial.<br /><br />Given how much xylitol is in the Spry gum, it's neither good nor bad to be chewing Spry, and what tips that balance towards "No Thanks" is the fact that it is not worth its value.<br /><br />Also (this is USEFUL), out of the three Spry flavors I've tried, inclusive of Green Tea, Spearmint and Citrus, I do have to say this flavor is the best tasting. It's original, not too artificial tasting, and does taste pleasant. Unfortunately, it only lasts for a couple of minutes, so it's a fleeting pleasure at best.

review/summary: Kids love it.
review/text: I love this gum because it's at least comparable in taste to the sugar free gums on the market that contain nutrasweet or other chemical sweeteners.  I've explained to my son why we don't buy Tri-dent and other brands, and since I give him a viable alturnative he's satisfied to just have a decent gum.  I like this flavor in particular, as compared to the other Spry flavors (peppermint, cinnamon) because, for some odd reason, this one doesn't get hard like the others.  It stays soft for a long time and, despite what other reviews have said, I think it keeps a decent flavor for a while.  Obviously not as strong as the first few minutes, but it keeps a neutral pleasant fruity taste for a while.  Try a pack from a natural food store first if you don't want to invest in a mega box.

It looked awesome, our guests loved the salt water taffy WAY more than those crummy tasting jordan almonds or custom printed M&Ms, plus a few people have told us that they freeze well. This salt water taffy is some of the best I've ever had, and I've had some other taffies. I have one word of caution, though: An adult sized human body can successfully digest fifteen pieces. Sixteen is too many.

review/summary: A wonderful dessert and here are some tips:
review/text: The flavor and texture of tapioca is something I've liked for years. Kraft and their recipe makes it quick and easy. But here's an even faster way: forget separating the egg white, whipping it, and adding sugar. Just mix it all at the beginning. Here is a great addition for flavor and stretching the amount: double the recipe and while its coming to a boil mash 2 large fully ripe bananas into a paste and add that once it boils. You end up with full bodied banana flavor. It makes about 6 cups.

review/summary: Makes tapioca a lot faster
review/text: My grandmother and I shared a deep love for tapioca pudding. I know a lot of people don't like it but it's always been one of my favorites. I use a modified version of her recipe.<br />This doesn't cut tapioca time to a minute, but the soaking time and cooking time isn't as long. You can decide at 3 you want tapioca for dessert tonight and actually make it by dinner time instead of the 24 hour soaking time that the regular tapioca pearls can take.<br />The grains of tapioca are smaller than regular pearls so you'll have lots of little bits instead of bigger chewy bites. It's more like the commercial preparations. I'll still take the time to make the pearl kind occasionally, but this makes a sudden whim for tapioca doable.

review/summary: It's tapioca, but it has other uses than pudding
review/text: I actually don't like eating tapioca pudding normally, but it does make an excellent thickener for fruit pies (about 3 heaping tablespoons is what I use). Has worked well in raspberry, blackberry, blueberry, and mixed berry (combination of those three) so far for me. It certainly is far superior to having the juice run all over when you cut into a raspberry pie made out of juicy frozen berries. I got a several year supply during one of the big discount specials on Kraft stuff about a month ago (along with a very large supply of Shake 'n Bake for chicken & pork at the same time).

UPS threw it over my locked 10 foot fence on to my back patio with no notice and with disregard to the 2 stickers on the box "Fragile" and "Perishable". I wrote O & H to complain, but received no response.  Despite the fact the danish was tasty, I will not order again from them.

review/summary: Dog's favorite toy!
review/text: My 30 lb beagle is rough on toys, especially the soft and fluffy kind. He loves to rip them open to find the squeaker and in the process leaves stuffing everywhere.  He usually can accomplish this in minutes.  So we stopped buying them.  The problem is, he doesn't really like hard toys, bones, or balls.  So all the Kong stuff goes to waste.<br /><br />I saw this advertised on TV by another name and thought I'd give it a try.  My dog loves this thing!  He carries this thing around, stalks it, pounces on it, and drops it in front of me all the time to play fetch or tug-o-war. The "fur" on the toy is now matted due to all the dog slobber. It does have squeakers in it (in the head and tail), but he hasn't really figured out how to get them out, yet.  This is the 1st soft toy that he hasn't destroyed in minutes.  It has been a week now, so far so good...

review/text: Not stuffed so there's no fluff to pick up. Very soft and realistic. My Jack Russell loves it. Plush toys were not made to endure a dog's aggressive ripping and tearing, so it won't hold up forever. Still, this was a very good buy and I will purchase again and again.

review/text: Interestingly, "stuffed" toys without stuffing hold up much better and far longer than stuffed toys do with my Miniature Schnauzer. Of course, ears, legs and noses eventually are chewed off. I no longer buy toys with stuffing for him.

review/text: This toy helped us get through a difficult welcome for a high-energy pound rescue. After weeks of high intensity chewing one of the ends (and its squeaker) finally came apart, but the rest of the toy still works.<br /><br />I'm impressed with the durability and for the price it is well worth it.

review/summary: Perfect for an active dog
review/text: This is perfect for an active dog that needs toys for entertainment.  The squeak attacks my dogs attention, and then she throws it around in the air herself,.  It keeps her busy for 20 minutes or so at a time.  Plus, it's great not having to clean up all the stuffing she always pulls out of her toys.

review/text: This product is a great buy for the low price.  I've seen this product in pet stores at a much higher price. Toy is very durable, sturdy and washable.  Makes a great "throw and tug toy" for both dogs and cats.  Bought a plush toy on the advice of my Vet for a teething puppy and it works great.  After washer and dryer use,  it is still a strong tug and teething toy with no stuffing loss.

review/summary: Identity Crisis for my Golden Retriever!
review/text: My husband brought two of these home for our two dogs.  Goldy is a Ridgeback mix and Lucky is an allegedly purebred Golden Retriever.<br /><br />Goldy didn't have much interest but Lucky did.  And after he had one in his mouth for a few minutes, he started whining.  He doesn't whine often, maybe when the kids go outside and leave him in or something, but over a toy??  Never.  As time went on (maybe a day or two) he became extremely possessive of the toys yet at the same time, he would retrieve them when they were thrown over and over.  He's not much of a retriever, he prefers a hardy game of keep-away, something he learned from Goldy. The other weird thing was the way he would pick up one or both.  He would gingerly stand over it and gently pick it up, sometimes folding it over, then he would bring it back with his lips over the sides.  When told to "Give" he would put his head over my hand and slowly open his mouth, careful not to use his teeth on it, and would push it out with his tongue, often having to open his mouth wider to expel the item unharmed.<br /><br />At times, Lucky would pick up one or the other (we have a fox and a raccoon) and walk around whining.  The look in his eyes was of confusion, it was almost as if he had retrieved a dead fox (or raccoon), but wasn't sure what to do with it.  Was he looking for the shooter?<br /><br />The only time Lucky has been caught actually using this as a toy was when he snuck it out of the house and into the backyard where I observed Lucky and Goldy in a rousing game of tug-of-war.  Unfortunately, once a toy goes outside it becomes an outside toy so I had to retrieve it quickly.  I don't know if he was playing tug-of-war, or simply trying to rescue the toy from Goldy who wanted to play, but he doesn't play with it like that in the house except for the one time I finally got him to play tug-of-war with me.  Usually though, he'll just lay down with it and do this weird grooming thing with his teeth where he seems to be using his front teeth to "feel" the fur, like he's looking for anything that might be stuck in it - the same way he chews at his own fur from time to time.  One note of caution - these things get covered with slobber and drool fast.  And when they dry, they're kind of 'crunchy'.  So they probably need to be washed pretty frequently.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say for a non-retriever/hunting breed, this toy is probably a good idea.  But for hunting dogs like Retrievers, this toy can cause confusion, like some primal or instinct to return it to whoever killed it has kicked in, and he seems to question his life and it's meaning as he walks around with his soft lips over the dead corpse in his mouth, worrying about what he's supposed to do with it and seeming to be confused and at odds with himself.  These toys don't seem to have changed Lucky much, though he handles them as if they were recently-dead animals, he is mostly gentle with them and at times confused about them.  I'd caution owners of retrievers to watch for instinctive retrieving behaviors.  On the other hand, for those training their dogs to retrieve their kills, these are probably the best for the job next to the real thing.

review/summary: Not good quality
review/text: Our 15 pound dachshund absolutely loved this toy but in less than a week he had the face chewed off, the eyes chewed off, the tips of the ears chewed off and a hole in the tail, plus had removed both squeekers. I don't recommend this at all. I'm just going to keep buying the $2 toys that last the same amount of time.

review/summary: Squeakers don't last, okay toy
review/text: One squeaker didn't work upon arrival, the other was silent after ten minutes with a pug mix puppy.  Possibly a puncture, but my guess is that the part that allows for air to pass and "squeak" is defective or poor quality.  Our dog plays chase with this every now and again, but the thrill of a new prey toy was gone as soon as it was silent.  No obsessive chewing to get to stuffing, however, so I gave it two stars.  Company would have a lifelong customer if it upgraded to sturdier squeakers.  As is, we won't buy again.

review/summary: Torn Up in 5 Minutes
review/text: I was thrilled to buy this for my Lab, but within five minutes of letting him play with it he had broken both squeekers, actually torn one out, and after 10 minutes had shredded the poor fox to pieces.  Don't waste your money.  Pick up a 25 cent stuffed animal at a yard sale and take the stuffing out of it.  It will last just as long.

review/summary: The best GF/CF rice spaghetti we've found yet!
review/text: Having a child on a gluten free, casein free diet has proven to be quite challenging, and we continue to try new foods.  I must say, Mrs. Leeper's Organic Rice Spaghetti is by far the best rice pasta we have tried yet!  Unlike other rice spaghetti we have tried, Mrs. Leeper's does not fall apart into little rice pieces while cooking, and it even stays together if it gets overcooked a little bit.  The texture is great, taste is excellent, and I'd highly recommend this product to others, including those on gluten free / casein free diets.

review/summary: Tasty and filling... Can be frozen after cooking
review/text: I am not on a gluten/wheat free diet. Instead, I came across this brand while shopping in my grocery store organic food isle. Since then, I have eschewed all other brands of spaghetti for Mrs. Leeper's Wheat/Gluten Free Organic Spaghetti. Here is why:<br /><br />1) I find it more filling then "regular" spaghetti. Typically, pasta leaves me craving more pasta. Not so with Mrs. Leeper's.<br />2) Tastes like the real McCoy.<br />3) Can be frozen after cooking. I boil the entire bag (6 servings) and place what I do not use in individual plastic containers. I defrost as needed.<br /><br />TIP: do not freeze with sauce. If you do, upon defrosting the noodles will break up into tiny little pieces (each less then an inch long). If you freeze the pasta by itself, either defrost it in the fridge, or put in the microwave on the defrost setting. I finish it off by adding the noodles to the sauce in a frying pan. Stir gently and the noodle length will be mostly preserved.<br /><br />4) Easy to cook. The box says boil 8-9 minutes. I find it needs full 12 minutes. At that point it is still slightly al dente.<br /><br />TIP: I do not bother with adding butter/oil. I have never had this pasta stick. Just make sure the water is boiling before you add the pasta. And stir. When I store, even if it seems like the noodles are sticking, once you heat them up, they will come apart. Be gentle, do not force them.<br /><br />One last TIP: initially, I thought the single servings seemed smaller then they are with "regular" pasta. However, once you place the serving on your plate with sauce, it is actually adequate. Enjoy!
