review/text: The best jerky I've found for a low price. I'd rather have the organic/free range/etc jerky but am a poor grad student, so this stuff works for me. The best deal I can find for jerky anywhere is here on Amazon.<br /><br />They are so easy to carry around and are very filling. Sometimes they are a little tougher than others, but it's not so bad you'll rip your teeth out eating them. I only have 2 complaints - a ridiculous amount of sodium and a few other additives (like SUGAR) that I'd prefer not to be eating. But still... so good for what you pay for.

review/text: I picked one of these up at a convenience store for a snack. It was just the right amount for a mid-meal bite. I bought a whole box from Amazon to keep in the office. Other reviewers said that they thought these were too salty, or old. The box I received wasn't old, and as for salty - it's beef jerky stuff, what do you expect? Calories and fat content aren't bad either.

review/summary: Best Jerky / Beef Steak! Best to buy it from Amazon!!
review/text: I have not yet purchased this product FROM amazon, BUT as soon as my box from the Jack Link's Site is gone I will forever buy it from Amazon alone! This (Jack Link's ORINGINAL Beef Steak) is my absolute FAVORITE jerky and has been for years! I've spent way to much time and gas looking for it at near-by stores only to be disapointed and settling for either Jack Link's other products or O'Boy Oberto which are both fine, but for me it does NOTHING for my beef jerky cravings! It is true it is quite salty but what good beef jerky isn't???? My husband a fitness/gym nut LOVES this jerky as well as the high protein content! I also LOVE the extremly low fat content as I cannot stand chewing on leather or fat that never chews away! This product is not only healthy (aside from salt), filling, great tasting, and a great snack thats easy to eat it is also CHEAP! At least in my perspective! On Amazon it is an amazing $10.00+ cheaper (when including shipping cost) than the same box from the Jack Link's website(kicking myself in the butt for that)! I will absolutely be setting up auto shipping for this product!

review/summary: Less Additives than other Packaged Jerky
review/text: It's tough to rate a food item as everyone has their own tastes. However, I think when it comes to store bought beef jerky, Jack Link's is about as good as they come. Most companies add a ton of extra garbage to their jerky, including sugar. You'll sometimes find 8-10 grams of sugar in some other brands. But with Jack Link's you are getting only 2 grams, and a taste that is comparable. And while all jerky is high in sodium, I realized these are a bit less than most competitors.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this is just good beef jerky without all the hoopla. A perfect healthy snack for someone in need of a little extra protein during the day. It won't beat the stuff coming direct from a butcher, but it's better than most of the other one's you'll find at a convenient store.

review/summary: Good but salty!
review/text: It's a nice price for a good jerky.  I try to keep loaded up on protein, and these jerkys are easy to just have lying around in case I feel like having one.  They taste pretty good, they're very low in carbohydrates and fat...<br /><br />But they're too salty.  I don't mean in a "Gee that's more than the Surgeon General recommends" kind of way, but in a disgusting kind of way.  Maybe if you have a really high tolerance for salt it's no problem, but I think most people would agree...anyway I get the Teriyaki flavor, with 440 mg of salt per oz.  The Pepper and the original flavors, at 770 per oz, are just too salty for me to want to eat.<br /><br />Amazon also has like alligator and elk and duck jerkey for sale...think I might give those a try once I run through this box.

review/summary: Thick and chewy, not traditional jerky but delicious nonetheless
review/text: I am in search of a good jerky and just had to try these.  I guess I paid little attention to the label "Beef Steak" versus beef jerky.  These pieces are thick and chewy and very peppery (in the original flavor).  I [personally find that I have more of an affinity to the regular, thinner sliced jerky over these "beef steaks" ... but we bought two boxes and are certainly enjoying them.<br /><br />These 2-ounce packs are filling, packed with protein and provide a great mid-day energy boost.  They travel well and the Jack Links brand has not let us down.  With so many varieties, we will be trying more.  These were a pleasant surprise and were different.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this is a thicker cut, 2 oz packs have 1280 mgs of sodium per serving.  Quite a lot!  Also, keep a toothpick or dental floss nearby, you'll need it!<br /><br />Very enjoyable nonetheless.

review/text: I've picked up the smaller size at convenience stores and have always liked them.  I read some of the reviews and one person mentioned how very salty they were, but I bought this pack of 12 anyway.  I thought maybe he was just a little sensitive, but, wow, he was right!  I like the flavor, but cannot eat much of it at once. I eat only a small amount each time and close the package back up.  The small ones I get in the convenience stores don't seem this salty.

review/summary: That's what she said!
review/text: This is big!  It's about a foot long and they has a pretty good girth to it (that's what she said)!  It's not as soft as normal jerky you find in the bag - I think this stuff is made differently.  It's tough and salty (that's what she said).  It's not the best tasting Jerky I've ever had, but for the price it definitely exceeds my expectations.  I've tried the Oberto brand jerky sticks and they were not very good at all.  And with 23g of protein and only 2g of fat in each stick it's pretty good for you!  One stick is pretty much a meal, though.  I find myself working on it for about 30 minutes before I down it all (that's what she said).<br /><br />Goodnight everybody - i'll be in town all week!

review/text: I've tried the hickory and peppered so figured I'd try the cajun too since I like spicy food. It has a nice kick to it but it's not too hot, at least in my opinion. The spicy taste lingers in your mouth for a bit but it's not a hot burn. It's not as tasty as I'd like but overall it's good and I'll order it again. My favorite is the peppered though, great taste and just a little spice from the pepper.

If you send any to the heat like that, this is a much better product so there's a little time allowed to still have decent jerky arrive.  Steak strips and jerky are better liked than the nuggets tho..

review/summary: Try it in strip form and from somewhere else
review/text: I usually buy the Sweet&Hot jerky strips at Walmart and love the taste. I decided to try the 2oz stick from Amazon and was disappointed for 3 reasons:<br /><br />1. They came with expiration date only 48 days away. I've bought a couple of grocery items from amazon and this seems to be a common pattern. I've also read reviews complaining about the expiration issue on other Amazon grocery products. I love shopping from Amazon, but this reason alone may stop me from buying perishables from them again.<br /><br />2. These sticks are not nearly as soft in texture as the strips. Maybe it's because it's almost reached its expiration date?<br /><br />3. The flavor is not exactly the same as the strips. It tastes more or less the same as regular beef jerky. A bit of hot (as most jerkies are), but not much sweet. Again, is age a factor?<br /><br />I've tried many brands and flavors, and Jack Link's Sweet&Hot is by far my favorite. Get it in strips.. and get it from you local grocer.

review/summary: Eating Salt Jerky
review/text: I thought this was similar to the Jack Links Peppered Beef Jerky, boy was I wrong.  This stuff is like eating pure SALT.  Nasty as hell.  One package serving is 57% of your recommended daily intake of Sodium.  This is one of the highest content of sodium I've found in Beef Jerky.  I don't recommend this unless you really really like SALT.

review/summary: Rokeach Memorial Yahrzeit Tumbler review
review/text: These memorial Yahrzeit candles by Rokeach definitely last longer than some of the cheaper ones I can get in a supermarket. I agree with the reviewer who writes that these always burn for a few hours longer than 24 hours; that makes these a superior brand of memorial candle. The candle burns well and safely after you light it but I usually place it on a dish on my stove or any other surface that is not flammable just in case.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

These are SPECTACULAR.  Fresh, juicy (not dried up and hard, which has been my lifelong objection to raisins), and mellow, without the slightly bitter off-putting taste I had always associated with raisins in the past.  The resealable bag is easy and convenient (although a little sticky, because these raisins are very moist).  Frankly I don't know how it's done, but Nell Newman is to be congratulated.  NO ADDITIVES, and still DELICIOUS!!  Will keep in stock at my house.<br /><br />STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!!

review/summary: Finally Tried
review/text: Being a fan of the American candy bar, especially those that have been around a long time, I'd heard of Idaho Spud and had seen it on the stock lists of old-time candy sites but had never had one. I ran across them today and bought one after first perusing the ingredients.<br />It seems to me that I read about a spud-shaped fudge from Idaho that actually contains potatoes, but this isn't it; Idaho Spud is made in potato country and is shaped like a potato, but the resemblance ends there. (Real) chocolate enrobes a cocoa-flavored marshmallow center and the whole is covered with dessicated coconut that keeps your jaws engaged longer than they'd otherwise be with something of this type. What's nice is that this marshmallow contains no gelatin--just agar agar and egg albumen. There's no hechsher but it's appropriate for lacto-ovo vegetarians (there's very little such marshmallow to be found).<br />This is a nice, gentle sweet (translation: it's not sickeningly sweet) and I can understand why they've been around as long as they have. Will I consume them on a regular basis? Unlikely, because although my affection for candy bars is perpetual, my consumption is occasional--a little goes a long way with me (you know you've finally grown up when even the thought of consuming too many sweets is mildly nauseating). But I do think they're very good and I absolutely recommend them. I'm tempted to pick up another one so that I can try a previous reviewer's suggestion to freeze them. I suspect they'd be really good that way. :)<br />I'd prefer to assign 4+ stars but I'll bite the bullet and give full marks.

review/summary: A Unique and Amazingly Delicious Candybar
review/text: It's a coconut-crusted chocolate coating over chocolate marshmallow, in the shape of half an Idaho potato. Yes, it sounds strange, but if you like chocolate, coconut, and marshmallow (and it isn't truly marshmallow but a bit more jelly-like), you may just love the Idaho Spud like I do. I ate my first Idaho Spud candy bar in 1964 at age 5 at the opening of a new bank in Moscow, Idaho, and I have been enjoying them ever since. When I lived in Spokane I would buy them by the boxful at the local grocer's outlet; now I live in Phoenix, and yes, I could buy them from Amazon, but this time of year they'd arrive in a puddle of chocolate goo. So I'll wait out the summer and start buying them again, and this time I'll buy enough to last over the summer in the freezer. They freeze very well!

review/text: Having been born in Idaho, I grew up with these.  I absolutely love them!!! I have not lived in Idaho for years but my grandmother and aunt used to send me a box of these every year for Christmas.  I guess my opinion may be a little biased because I feel a lot of sentiment toward anything that reminds me of home - but these are truly tasty.  If you can find them, this company also makes small, bite-sized Spuds that are pretty good as well.  I like the actual candy-bar sized Spuds better because you get more of the chocolate marshmallow flavor, but if you like the chocolate/coconut outer covering then you would probably really like the bite-sized ones a lot.

review/summary: Better than Sex?
review/text: Dilettante Chocolate is from Seattle, where I moved away from about six months ago. I make my own Mocha in the morning and when I moved, I couldn't find any product, anywhere, at any price, that truly replicated the flavor of Ephemere. As an aside, this stuff tastes great on ice cream, on a spoon... or what have you. Anyway, I find the Semisweet better for coffee drinks than Bittersweet (even though I prefer very dark chocolate for eating- usually between 75-85%.) Somehow, the little extra sugar brings out the chocolate flavor in the drink better. I use less of this than the Bittersweet, which saves both money AND calories, and what's not to like about that?<br /><br />On the price front, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016LEU2Q">Dilettante Semisweet Ephemere Sauce, 22-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a> is less expensive than the best price I ever found at a store actually IN Seattle. I know, now that I've said this, that the price will go up, but I'm positive it will still be cheaper.<br /><br />Several years ago, Dilettante reformulated Ephemere to be ALL-NATURAL, which is awesome. The only drawback, if you can call it that, is that it used to be shelf-stable. Now, you have to refrigerate after opening, which makes it very, very dense. This observation leaves me wanting to share this little aside: My sister-in-law finds the visual texture of this stuff off-putting; I will not say what she compares it to. It's so thick, however, that you have to microwave it for about 15 seconds after about a quarter of the bottle is empty, so her unappealing comparison is moot. If you like dark chocolate IN things and not just for eating from a bar, you will not be disappointed in Ephemere. If you like milder chocolate, go for the Milk Chocolate version. If you like Bittersweet, your decision between semi and bittersweet, like mine, will be a little more difficult.<br /><br /> I feel so strongly about this product that if I could give my phone number out to anyone who disagrees with my assessment to call and berate me, I would.<br /><br />WARNING: Do not be surprised if you find yourself pattering off to the fridge half asleep in the middle of the night for a dollop of this on a spoon. You've been warned.

review/summary: Everlasting Treat?
review/text: After the recommendaton I had received for the toy these treats were made for, I had high hopes for it.  Especially high hopes because I had recently purchased the Everlasting Treat Ball and expected the quality and texture to be as good and as durable as the cookie inserts for that toy.  My pup managed within a few minutes, to chew off and eat the cookie rod end and remove and eat both cookies plus the cookie rod.  The treats from the Everlasting Treat Ball last at least one week, but these didn't last one hour, so I was disappointed.  These cookie inserts appear to be softer and easier to eat and finish than the Treat Ball inserts.  I'll buy these inserts again, but will monitor his use of them.  I had hoped they would be as durable and difficult to finish as the other toy, but they aren't.  If my 6 month old beagle puppy was able to demolish these within an hour, I hate to think what an older, bigger dog could do with them!  In my case, it should have been "let the buyer beware" !

review/summary: Good idea, but doesn't work like it should.
review/text: I originally purchased the triple crown treats without the locking piece. That's how they come with the ball or toy. The first one worked okay and I thought I would have a great long lasting treat toy for my rottie. Well, he got the first treat out of the toy in about one hour. The second one was out in about three minutes. Reading the package instructions I saw that they offered the locking piece. Thinking this would be great, I purchase three packages of two treats and the locking piece (six treats and three locking pieces). When I received them, it took me all three packages to get the pieces to fit together without breaking the locking piece. Still, didn't work for my rottie. So, if you have a little dog without much spunk, this might be a good treat toy, but if you've got a big dog that won't stop until he gets what he wants, don't bother with this.

review/summary: Does not live up to claims
review/text: I was very disappointed with this product after using the Everlasting Treat Ball inserts and really liking the Everlasting Ball.<br /><br />The initial problem was screwing the two ends onto the rod. I'm not sure if there is some special trick to this or what because I spent a longer time trying to figure out how to screw it all together than it took for my dog to chew through it.  The pieces don't seem to fit well together and the first time I tried to muscle the whole thing in place the end pieces cracked.<br /><br />One of my dogs who is admittedly a strong chewer was able to get through the  ends and rod in under 15 minutes.  She can pretty easily bite the rod down to the end cap and has figured out that if she licks the ends enough the two end pieces will easily pop out because they don't fit in as snuggly as the everlasting treat ends do for some reason.<br /><br />I would recommend skipping this and just using the Everlasting Treat Ball inserts if your dog is not a really aggressive chewer.

review/text: My dog loves the actual treat, but it doesn't lock well at all. The long part does not easily twist into the treat's screw shapes. It does not easily go into the everlasting treat ball. If you just insert the ends in as you would an original everlasting treat ball and have the end sticking out, that will work, but it definately defeats the purpose of it being "everlocking". I would just stick to the original.

review/summary: Good sauce for those that are not vegetarian
review/text: Mexican is one of my favorite foods and smothering a bean burrito with red sauce and onions is one of my quick, stand-by dinner options.  With such a simple meal, it is imperative to have fresh and tasty ingredients.  I've tried many red sauces and some were quite good.  According to my husband this has been the best sauce.  He says it beats the enchilada sauces he has had in most Mexican restaurants.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I cannot offer my own taste appraisal because this product is not vegetarian.  Frontera makes two red sauces -- one that is in a pouch <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IFVCM">Frontera Pouch, Enchilada Skillet Red Chile, 8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>and this product that comes in a jar.  The product in the pouch is vegetarian.  The product in the jar is not.  After examining the ingredients on the pouch, I had made the assumption both products were equal and purchased the jar (because it was a better price) without rechecking the ingredients. The sauce in the jar has chicken in it.  If you are vegetarian, don't purchase the jar option unless it is for family/friends.<br /><br />My husband's rave reviews of this sauce have led me to order <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IFVCM">Frontera Pouch, Enchilada Skillet Red Chile, 8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>.  My husband says that the product has a rich tomato taste and the roasted garlic inside the sauce complements the sauce well.  The sauce spreads easily and is not thin or tomato paste thick.  The 16 oz. jar was perfect for covering eight burritos (using six inch tortillas).<br /><br />I purchased my Frontera enchilada sauce in the 16 ounce jar from my local co-op for about four and a half dollars.  The price on the vegetarian/pouch version on Amazon is cheaper than my co-ops (which was charging about three dollars for the eight oz. pouch).<br /><br />Ingredients:  Water, Tomato (fresh tomato, tomato juice, calcium chloride, citric acid), roasted tomato, New Mexico Chile Pepper, Apple Cider Vinegar, Salt, roasted onion, roasted red bell pepper, roasted garlic, sugar, chicken base (cooked chicken and chicken juices, salt, sugar, maltodextrin, chicken fat, dehydrated onions, citric acid, turmeric, natural flavors), vegetable oil, xanthan gum, and spices.<br /><br />Another good place to buy this item is iherb.com.  The company offers free shipping over certain thresholds. If interested in iherb, you can use code LEK375 for a discount.<br /><br />Made in the United States.

review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: I LOVE my Baby Brezza, but I wouldn't recommend the cutting board.  The white surface absorbs colors and has cut marks all over it after only a few uses.  If I had to do it all over again, I would simply continue to use my regular wood board instead of spending money on this one.  The fit over the machine is handy, but not a necessity.  Generally, I would need to put the cut up items in a separate bowl while waiting for a previous batch to finish in the Brezza anyway, so the handy "fit" doesn't really do me much good.  A good idea, but would be better if made from a more durable, non-staining material.

The hole is really helpful for putting the food into the brezza unit or blender.  I really like the grooves, too, because they really make cutting the fruit so much simpler.  The nonskid bottom really works well, too.  It's now one of my favorite kitchen items.

review/text: My son loves Hot Cheetos and we try to minimize his consumption of junk food. On special occasions we will let him eat them, and over the past 2 times he has thrown up this red liquid afterward. He says he feels immediately better. The first time we figured he had a flu bug and he didn't eat the hot cheetos for weeks. Yesterday he came home from camp and as a special treat we let him eat some on the way home. Needless to say he threw up the same red stuff after his chest was burning and stomach hurt. The ingredients say they contain monosodium glutamate so MSG. Parents beware if your child has done the same with specifically the "hot" brands of chips .<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FQ4G2Y">Cheetos Flamin' Hot Crunchy 2.0 oz (Pack of 5)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ARKE14">Flamin' Hot Mix - 30 ct</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ARKE14">Flamin' Hot Mix - 30 ct</a>

review/text: The chocolate melted amazingly quickly and evenly. So much easier than cocoa or baker's chocolate with fats, etc, in a double boiler! Just put them in a microwave safe bowl, zap em, and set out some parchment paper for easy clean-up of the dipped items.<br /><br />However, it is much sweeter than other dark chocolates. Certainly it is sweeter than I would have preferred.<br /><br />In addition, the bottom of the container had broken just as I lifted it out of the box in which it had been mailed - it was extremely thin, thinner than the lid, and the sides are sharp and basically cut the bottom in a circular pattern. So the remainder is now in Tupperware and luckily I caught it before too much fell out.

I'm very glad that there are companies making products like this.  Unlike some others I do genuinely enjoy the taste.  But in the end I feel that at nearly $2/ea, they are pretty over-priced.  There are other products, like from Atkins and South Beach that are just as tasty and healthy, but much less expensive.

review/summary: Choc/PB Delight are the best...
review/text: These are a staple in our house of one diabetic and one trying to lose weight. We do the subscribe and save here on amazon, and chocolate peanut butter delight seems to be the flavor we like the best.<br /><br />One unfortunate thing, as pointed out in another review, is that there isn't a mixed "sampler" box that could include 2 or so of each to try. We bought an entire box of the apple and they were really not good to us. If that was the only flavor someone ever tried, I could see a one star review.<br /><br />We had tried the chocolate delight and the peanut delight from our local Walgreens after reading about them online...both were good, but much more expensive there and only 5 in a box...and they only had those two flavors. So we ordered a box of the choc pb delight and the apple...we have been ordering 1 or 2 boxes a month of the choc pb delight for over a year.<br /><br />Wonderful for bedtime, as my DH struggles with high fasting BG readings when he sleeps too long, or for snacks [dips in his BG when he goes too long without eating].  We both use them as a quick and easy breakfast when we have no time to make something.  Decent protein amount and not much sugar, so no crash like with some high carb bars.<br /><br />I would love an almond flavor...maybe toffee almond? Maybe an oatmeal banana...? Anyhow. These are awesome, just need a sampler box.

review/text: My son's diabetes educator recommended extend bars after we mentioned several low bg readings during swim meets and basketball games. He gave us a couple of samples and they worked great!  My son just eats a bar right before he swims and although we have to monitor him for a while afterwards, he no longer experiences lows during swimming.  He's now playing football and eats just a half bar since he has to disconnect from his insulin pump to play.  So far so good with football also.  My son has has type 1 diabetes since the age of 2 so it's really great when we find something to make his life a little easier and allow him to be as active as he wants without fearing low bgs. Bonus: he actually really likes how they taste!

review/summary: Very Good Tasting Diabetic Friendly Snack Bar - Highly Recommeded!
review/text: The Extend "Peanut Butter Chocolate Delight" bars are among the best tasting low carb snack bars I have tried since becoming diabetic. While the Atkins bars are generally very good, these taste even better and also do seem to control my blood sugar longer.<br /><br />These bars have 150 Calories each, 11g of Protein, and only 1 Net Carb. The high protein load really helps to control my hunger, making this a great snack for mid-day munchies or after workout "pick me up", as well as a bed time snack.<br /><br />One note of caution, these do have Maltitol which can cause "gastric distress" in some people.<br /><br />Highly Recommended! I also like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QUTRLW">Extend Bar Chocolate Delight, 15-Count, 21.16-Ounce Box</a> even more than these!<br /><br />CFH
