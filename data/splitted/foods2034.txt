review/summary: not what I expected
review/text: For the longest time I've been looking for something that compares to Illy espresso (medium roast) at a lower price. Thought this was a deal as I've been paying $14+ per can of Illy. I read all the hype & tried to order via Amazon only to be told they will NOT ship this product to Hawaii.I found the Crema e Gusto somewhere else for less than $9/pack; sadly, I was disappointed with the slightly bitter undertone and will most likely go back to Illy. Any Illy addicts out there who found something as good at a lower price?

review/summary: Terrific Coffee: So-So Packaging
review/text: I received my order of four (4) packs of this coffee yesterday and today, upon opening the bricks that were shrink-wrapped together, I noticed that one of the individual packages was clearly not vacuum sealed.  Sure enough, at the bottom of the package, I could see a slice from what was most likely a straight razor used to open a box.  Hmm...out with that package.  (I should add that the shipping box was was in perfect condition.)<br /><br />Understandably, this type of thing can happen with packaging / stocking.  Still, I'm a little disappointed that on my first order, only 3 out of 4 packages are any good.

My kids think I'm strange that I get so excited every time an Amazon box shows up with more coffee in it. Amazon's subscription service is awesome. The coffee just keeps showing up to my door for less than it would cost to buy inferior coffee at my grocery store.<br /><br />I love this coffee!

review/summary: not good...
review/text: I tried to learn to like the taste, but it did not happen, no matter how hard I tried.  The coffee has a strange aroma and after taste (like some sort of a strong chemical), and I have been drinking Italian espressos all my life.  After I ran out of the 4 bricks, I also stopped getting the runs and stomach pains every morning.  No more rushing to the toilet after breakfast!  I initially believed I was beginning to have unknown health problems, but after quitting this coffee, I realized that my health was fine.  For some reason it worked out terribly for me.  Espresso drinking has always been a ritual of delight for me.  Aroma, color, taste, and the feel-good-effect after drinking the coffee should all combine to bring forth a unique moment of goodness.

review/summary: Grind Is Too Fine
review/text: Unfortunately, I haven't found anything I can make this coffee in where the filter doesn't become instantly clogged.<br /><br />The filter on my French press is quite tolerant being a decent model but the grinds still get through the filter quite excessively.<br /><br />With a drip coffee maker, a permanent gold filter has no chance, as the fine grind blocks the filter and quickly causes the coffee maker to overflow. Paper filters are even worse, clogging up almost instantly.<br /><br />I'll end up giving it away since I can't actually make a good batch without excessive messes.

review/text: Once I started using this coffee I realized that the coffee maker is not what makes good coffee, it is the quality and flavor of the coffee you are using.

Plus, I can get four 8.8 ounce bricks for the price of 2 Illy 8.8 ounce cans... Glad I switched!

review/text: I make espresso on a Krups machine with Cafe Lavazza. In comparison to Cafe Bustelo, which has a boring, but tolerable strong dark roast espresso flavor, Lavazza espresso has a more unique, rich syrupy flavor.<br /><br />However, if I compare Lavazza to the beans that I bought at Four Barrel in San Francisco last week, Lavazza's flavor seems pretty boring. I give it 4 stars because it is a great deal for the price and has good flavor.

review/text: I had been using Bob's Red Mill coconut flour for all my gluten-free baking but decided to try this brand because it was cheaper. And, let's just say you get what you pay for!! This coconut "flour" isn't flour at all... it's coconut meal. It's much more course than Bob's Red Mill and leaves all my baked goods with a undesirable grainy texture. I would absolutely not recommend this brand, however, I do recommend coconut flour in general. It's an absolutely wonderful substitute for grain flours.

review/summary: 3rd. order - been using for a year... now has a finer grain
review/text: When I first started using this product yes, the grain was coarser but around 6 months ago, they improved that. The price initially enticed me to this product (currently about 80 cents cheaper/lb. than BRM) , but the *no sulfites* keep me coming back. Two major factors that attracted me to coconut flour were high fiber and low oxalate. I believe it's also lower in sugar on the GI/GL tables. It's also nice that there are 6 bags per carton - don't have to order it that often (vs. 4 bag cartons).<br /><br />There was a learning curve when I first switched (hint: bump your leavening up) in spite of buying Fife's coconut cookbook; don't waste your money unless you have no concerns over cholesterol and eating exorbitant amounts of eggs. I substitute flax "goop" from ground flax seed (and water) and knock the egg requirements down by at least 1/2 or 2/3! Initially, I used only coconut flour for all my baking and pancakes; I even put a Tlb. in my rice farina. Recently though, I have branched out to adding rice and/or tapioca flours to make my own gluten-free flour blend. Tip: Go to an Asian supermarket for the rice flour (non-glutenous type has less starch) and tapioca flour if you're on a budget. Also, sift your flours 3x before using/baking.<br /><br />Yes, it's more work and more money than wheat flour, but my quality of life has improved drastically and that's worth it!!!

review/summary: This coconut flour is a great source of dietary fiber!
review/text: I used to buy organic coconut fiber to add to smoothies as a source of dietary fiber, but it became unavailable.  The manufacturer suggested I substitute coconut flour, which is really the same thing but more finely ground. This is the fiber left over from coconut after most of the oil is removed, and it is an outstanding low carbohydrate source of dietary fiber.  It absorbs a great deal of water, which is excellent for elimination.  The coconut fiber cured my 87 year old mother's problems with constipation after years of trying other remedies that didn't work.  I've tried other finer ground coconut flours in smoothies or mixed with yogurt, but none were as palatable as Let's Do Organic because they were too finely ground and over-thickened the mixture.  This brand also has the best coconut taste of any I've tried, and it is excellent in my low carb, high fiber and protein pancake recipe. It also makes an excellent low carb, high fiber coating for fried or sauteed seafood, especially when mixed with rice protein powder. More people should be aware of the health benefits of coconut fiber.  I'm sending a six pack of this to my mother.  Since the other coconut fiber is no longer available, I'm sure she'll be relieved!  lol!!

review/summary: Best Coconut Flour
review/text: I have tried several brands of coconut flour.  This one is clearly the best in flavor, texture, and ease of use.  I love the convenient one-pound packages(I usually buy in groups of six and refrigerate all of them). The packages are not so easy to access on a daily basis, so I open one and pour the entire bag into an airtight container which I store in the refrigerator. Works great!!

review/summary: NOT Coconut Flour
review/text: This stuff is not coconut flour just like the other reviewer said  it is just ground shredded coconut, it almost is just a very fine shredded coconut (but still not very fine) Not at all like coconut flour! Do not make the mistake I did and buy it thinking it is, because you cannot return it.  It was a big waste of my money!

I use a combination of Dana Carpendar's recipes and the latest "Low Carb Among Friends" cookbook.<br /><br />I don't find a pronounced coconut flavor, just adds a wonderful texture to low carb breads, cookies and cakes.<br /><br />I was not disappointed and doubt you would be either, if you try it!

review/summary: Coconut Flour dream!
review/text: This is high quality flour. I was initially worried about using an unfamiliar product, but my risk definitely paid off. This is the best way to buy Coconut flour, in bulk. It definitely saves you money in the long run as opposed to buying a pound at a time. As I previously stated, this is high quality flour that can be used to make pie crust, brownies, pancakes, crepes, and limitless other baked goods. I strongly recommend this product!

review/summary: Great stuff!
review/text: A good product at a great price.  I waited for the lowest price over 3 months then locked in the price by subscribing.  The product itself is great.  Coconut flour is by nature a bit more "granular" than wheat flour but vastly healthier.  Since it has not gluten don't expect to have a crumb free, sturdy baked good like you get with even AP flour.  It won't happen.  This is best used for shortbread-type recipes or as a dredging material for frying (and in this role it can be a little "grainy").<br /><br />Compared to similar products this one is good.  And the price, while a little high, is competitive with anything I can get locally.  Just watch the price in our cart and pounce when you see a value!

review/summary: Delightfully Fragrant and Deliciously Smooth Tea !
review/text: I love this green tea!  When prepared correctly (especially with delicate teas, such as green and white teas) you will experience the most delightfully fragrant and smooth tea ever!<br /><br />Jasmine is believed to be the world's most popular flavored green tea; since I love the scent of jasmine anyway, I thought I'd give it a try.  My first cup was at a local Chinese restaurant in Richardson, TX (of all places, right?...but true!).  The sweet scent of jasmine enveloped the restaurant; my guests and I were immediately presented with this beautiful Chinese Tea Setting of jasmine green tea (already steeped and strained).  OMG! First sip and I was hooked!  With a dash of sugar the green tea  and jasmine flavor just popped. Absolutely delicious!<br /><br />I was advised that one tea bag will yield 2.5 cups (OR a small tea pot).  Brewing good tea requires good preparation. Start with cold fresh water and bring kettle it to a boil.  Let hot water settle for awhile.  Next, prepare your tea pot with one tea bag.  Pour hot water into tea pot.<br /><br />Follow these guidelines for appropriate water temperature and steeping times for jasmine tea varieties.<br /><br />  * Green: Use 160�F water and steep for 1 to 2 minutes<br />  * White: Use 185�F water and steep for 5 to 8 minutes<br /><br />Adhering to the appropriate water temperature and steeping time is critical for making good tea. Too much steeping and your tea will be bitter; too little and the tea will be thin and weak. Water that is too hot for delicate teas like green and white will compromise the tea's light flavor.<br /><br />Hope this helps in brewing a perfect cup/pot of Jasmine Green Tea!

We drink it with a bit of sugar and milk, it's just like the same type of milk tea you buy at those little asian tea shops, only cheaper and better tasting!<br /><br />It is wonderful hot as well, with a sweet dessert.

review/summary: The scent of heaven
review/text: I first had this tea at a vegetarian Vietnamese restaurant. I ordered green tea, and as the waitress came out of the kitchen with the pot I could smell it already. It has the most heavenly aroma; in fact, I find just the smell relaxing. The taste is also very nice and unexpected. I find, now that I know I like jasmine green tea, that there are very few "jasmine" teas where you can actually taste the jasmine. Usually the only ones that can do that are the very expensive loose teas from tea shoppes, and Stassen's tea. It's altogether a lovely experience, and I wish that I could get it in decaf too.

I took it out and it filled three 1-gallon glass jars, plus a small amount left over that fed 3 people.<br /><br />When I read that most pasta today is put through machines with nonstick coating like teflon (the same stuff they say causes cancer) I decided to try this one because it does not use that process.<br /><br />This is what pasta was before they started cheaping out and making it with out any love, care, or thought.  This is what pasta was when the people making it cared more about making a good product than a quick buck.

review/summary: It's Just Curry To Us
review/text: We spent a few weeks in Morocco last year and bought ras el hanout in six different places--in Fez, Marrakesh, Rabat, and Meknes, at spice stands and supermarkets. The name means "head of the shop"--it's a blend of up to 100 spices and every place has a slightly different formula. With all six, we got a mild, aromatic, subtly perfumy seasoning with a tremendous depth of flavor. We love it on steamed lamb shanks. It has an outstanding affinity for whole roast chicken: brush melted butter all over the chicken, then coat generously with ras el hanout and a little salt and pepper. Roast at 365� for 1 hour and 45 minutes, turning it over after the first hour. Fabulous! Ras el hanout is about the same color as cumin. (See the article in Wikipedia for info on the main ingredients.)<br /><br />We were sorry to find out that this product is nothing like the real deal. We bought it because our Morocco stash is running out. It looks and tastes like ordinary curry powder, including a fair amount of hot chili pepper, not at all like ras el hanout. We threw it out. Don't waste your money.

Everyone loves these Ferrero chocolates especially our mailperson.  It's been a traditon. I gave it four stars because the price could be a little lower.

This box looked amazing because of some triangular cut-outs making it look like a gemstone so I didn't mind the difference. Of course, the chocolate was delicious. Please remember to share!

Oh, the gift box was not a flat one layer as pictured.<br /><br />UPDATE: Item image now represents the gift box. However cracked, chipped boxes are still sent out BUT the candy still is good! Watch out ordering during the heat wave so you don't get melted mush.

review/summary: cost-cutting?
review/text: I have been wanting to do a review for this chocolate for months now and finally got to it. I have always loved this chocolate to the extent my husband buys it for me whenever he sees it and I also buy my own. Used to be, the smooth chocolate coupled with crunchiness of the hazelnut were delectable! However, it seems to me as evidenced by its taste now that the maker of this chocolate has compromised its taste. I thought I just got a bad or old batch when I first noticed the taste about 7-8 months ago but I didn't. I still did not believe that the taste has changed, I bought this chocolate many times after and in fact, has about 8 pieces left from the 36/pcs/pk I got from Sam's Club. The taste has definitely changed in a way that first; the chocolate tastes more like sugar instead of tasting the chocolateness of it and second; the hazelnuts are smaller and seems to not be as fresh as it used to be. I am very sad that if ever the manufacturers of this chocolate was trying to cut cost, it has altered the quality taste of this chocolate, then it won't be worth buying it anymore. After the batch that I have with me, I don't think I will buy anymore out of my own pocket unless somebody gives it to me. I hope they will bring it back to its original taste as I am an avid fan of this chocolate for over 20 years now.

review/text: I had not realized until just now that these FERRERO ROCHER HAZELNUT CHOCOLATES 48 COUNT GIFT BOX, were made by the SAME Ferrero Company that makes "Nutella" Hazelnut-Chocolate spread, (which I totally love to eat!)  I had some of these individual chocolates once, and did NOT like them!  Those who share my taste in chocolates will not like them either!  For these Ferraro Rochet Hazelenut<br />Choclolates, have bits of hazel nuts, (finely chopped...but NOT finely chopped enough for me), embedded in a chocolate coating, the whole surrounding a whole hazelnut.  I'm one of those people who likes FILETS....boneless fish filets, boneless chicken filets, etc.  I, (and I know I'm NOT alone here), like my chocolate mixtures to be complete MIXTURES....like Nutella spread, (or "figaro" hazelnut chocolate pieces...also called "chocolate truffles").  Biting through<br />hard, embedded "pieces" of things -- even such tiny pieces of hazelnut as the chocolate-hazelnut coating has here -- is NOT for me, or others like me.  In this, I have discovered, I, (or make that, "we"), have true "preppy" tastes, (even though I did attend plain old Queens College in NYC -- part of the very public<br />City University of New York where, it seems, (to me, at least), egalitarian has gone from good to exremes -- and even fraternities and sororities are officially outlawed!  To some, this may seem only "fair" and "equitable".  But to status-seeking me, it seems SO unglamourous!  I guess I'm not the typical Queens College of the City University of New York student, though I do sincerely laud them for making eduction more available for everyone.  I only wish they had more of what private universities have.  To me, "equality" is equal luxuries for all, not equal utilitarianism for all.  Same goal, different methods, I guess....)  In "The Official Preppy Handbook", it states that preppies like filets...no bones to slice through, or fat to trim away. (Why waste the time, why spend the effort?)  The same has to go, (at least for me --and others with "preppy" tastes), for these otherwise "gourmet" quality confections.  Those little bits of chopped hazelnuts in the coating -- not to mention the BIG hazelnut in the centre -- make eating DIFFICULT, and spoil the pleasure of eating. Rather than have a (fancy) chocolate that I must chew through, I would prefer a plain old Hershey choclate bar. It, like the more expensive Nutella, IS a chocolate "filet".  I suppose this liking of the "ordinary" Hershey bar, (and a plain one please -- not one with almonds),  proves I am NOT a snob -- I, (and others like me), simply have TASTE!<br /><br />I thought I was alone in this.  But since reading "The Official Preppy Handbook", I know that others -- far richer than myself -- also have these tastes.  This, of course, vindicates me, and I feel glad of it.<br />Enjoy "Ferrero Rocher Hazelnut Chocolates 48 Count Gift Box" if you wish...and give it to friends, if that is your desire. But this sort of chocolate, because of the way it is formed, is NOT my choice for either myself or my friends.  And, no matter how excellent the chocolate itself is, it will NEVER be of "gourmet" quality, to me!

review/summary: My Little Kittens Love This/Shipping Bad News
review/text: I got two new kittens who were 8 weeks old. They had been raised on Mom's milk, kitten kibble by Iams and a little wet food now and then. They were in good shape when they came to me. One is a black kitten (all black with not white anywhere) and the other is a brown tiger. I am not positive of their sex yet and have had the flu so they have not been for shots and to have a professional assess the situation; however, I think they are both boys. I like to feed boys wet food to make sure they are getting the water they need to keep their urinary tracts clean and healthy. So, as soon, as I knew for certain they were mine, I ordered some kitten food from Amazon.<br />One variety is this Chicken and Liver flavor. I ordered three cases of food in three different flavors and of all of them, the kittens prefer this. Chicken and Liver entree is their Very Favorite. The two of them scarf down an entire can of this mix without a second breath. The little black one, who was the runt of the litter, growls the enitre time he eats this. He plans to get his Fair (Fare for fun) Share! The little brown tiger does not back off, but keeps nibbling away.<br />The other two varieties I ordered were<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFVXYU">Pro Plan Canned Cat Food, Kitten Classic Salmon and Ocean Whitefish Entr&eacute;e (Pack of 24 3 Ounce Cans)</a>The other variety I got was the following.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G0NL2W">Fancy Feast Gourmet Kitten Food, Tender Turkey Feast, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br />The Kittens will leave one bite of the Pro Plan Salmon in order to play, and will leave two bites of the Turkey. I think that indicates their preference pretty clearly: 1. Pro Plan Chicken and Liver 2. Pro Plan Salmon and Whitefish and 3. Fancy Feast Turkey (My older cats, who were raised on the Turkey, say it is a bit bland. but they were healthy on it!)<br />So, if you have kittens, I definitely recommend this ProPlan Chicken and Liver Wet food, especially if you have little boys. Keep that urinary tract in good shape.<br />One other thing I discovered about the use of this Kitten food is that it is Super for Pregnant Queens, especially if they are younger than one year, or have had frequent litters so that their own nourishment has been depleted. My kittens' Mom was a "drop off" in our retirement neighborhood (Don't you know those old folks will take in a p.g. female. She looks so sweet!) And we did take her in and provided homes for all six kittens, but, as an aside, it is really a diry trick to play to kitties and people, just because the irresponsible will not take their obviously healthy female to a free spay clinic...but then that is not about the food.<br />Anyway, the sweet lady who took in the Mom fed her this Kitten Food plus Kitten Kibble and Cottage Cheese to make certain she got adequate protein and vitamins. Fending on the street was temporarily a hard life for a p.g. mom. But she picked her weight back up on this and Kitten Kibble and gave us good healthy babies.<br />So, this is Definitely recommended for kittens and as an "off Label use" also for pregnant and lactating females who need the extra nutrients. This is a good one.<br />I am only going to give it 4 stars though because it is almost $8.00 for shipping; thus, it is obviously not on Subscribe and Save and that needs to happen. Kittens can stay on this food for up to a year! But I do recommend it for apparent good taste and stated good nutrition.

The kittens devour it, which is also good.<br /><br />But best of all, it doesn't upset their tummies, so i don't have to clean up nasty messes.

review/summary: Love these herbs
review/text: The first time I had Herbs de Provence was when my daughter brought some back from Paris with her.  I fell in love with the flavor.  Now, I use it in all italian sauces, put it in marinades for chicken and pork, etc.  This was not a bad price, either.  Grocery stores are much higher priced.

review/summary: Excellent!!
review/text: I was not sure if this would leave my food smelling and tasting like potpourri because of the lavender. I was wrong. This is an excellent product that can be used on more than just meats. I used it on fish, chicken and on scrambled eggs. Full of flavor without adding salt. This is a great blend of herbs and spices. I only wish I bought a larger amount before. Getting the large bag with my next order. Highly recommended!
