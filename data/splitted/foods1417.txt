review/summary: Love my li'l Grains!
review/text: My husband and I have been enjoying the benefits of dairy-based kefir for a few years now, but maybe I wasn't enjoying it as much as he was, because frankly I don't care for dairy products - they feel heavy to me.  So I decided to give "water kefir" a try, and was thrilled to find out that you can get them online because they can be dried and shipped, unlike the dairy-based kefir grains.<br /><br />These came with very good instructions on how to get started, and it didn't take long at all - maybe two days - for the grains to reconstitute and get active.  Honestly - and maybe it sounds a bit silly, but - it feels like they are now a member of the family.  Members??  Anyway, they and I now  have a nice working relationship and I have successfully made many batches of fruit-flavored kefir that I use for a morning tonic.<br /><br />I was thrilled to find out that the drinks produced are NOT sweet.  I hate sweet drinks.  I suppose you could add sweetener to them if  you wanted to, but why ruin a good drink?  These are just plain refreshing!  And if anything, the probiotic benefits are even greater than those from the dairy-based kefirs (at least, they are for me.)<br /><br />After a couple of weeks in our home, the grains increased enough in size that I was able to drop a few into a gallon of apple juice and produce a really fine hard cider that everyone in the family likes a lot.<br /><br />Now that the grains in the cider have built up a nice population of yeast,  I am experimenting with making beer.  The probiotics produced by the grains prevents non-beneficial bacteria from forming, so that you don't have to be so scrupulous about keeping everything absolutely sterile during the brewing process.  Brewing beer with kefir is MUCH more forgiving than the "regular" way.  My results so far are OK, but I'm still working on finding a recipe that I really like.  (That may be hard to do, because well, let's face it, Guinness is hard to top!)<br /><br />Anyway, I'm so glad I have discovered these grains, and can't wait to learn more.

review/summary: Great holistic, easy to digest cat food
review/text: Cats are strictly carnivores, they're not meant to eat a grain based diet, yet that is primarily what the mainstream cat food manufacturers make their dry cat food with. It causes all sorts of issues with allergies, poor skin and coat condition, and digestive upsets. I have a couple of cats who have a gluten allergy to corn and wheat, any time they eat any dry food containing those they would bloat up and have horrendous bloody diarrhea. One even got a skin allergy and would get an eczema-type condition and scratch bald spots on himself from the itching.<br /><br />My vet recommended this food and it does great for my cats. It's easily digested, high quality protein, and with the "Yucca Schidigera Extract", the litter box smell is reduced greatly. The price on Amazon, even with shipping, beats the one local store that sells it. And the best part is, my cats actually like it day in and day out. My cats no longer have skin allergies or digestive upsets, which makes everyone happier.

review/summary: Something Unique
review/text: Lapsang Souchong - 'Russian Caravan' as it is commonly known - is a truly exceptional Chinese tea, and it is done proper justice by the ladies at Culinary Teas. A generous teaspoon of Lapsang Souchong steeped for about three and a half minutes in roughly 190-200 degree water will yield a strong, flavorful cup of the Fujian Province's most notable tea. What is so respectable about Culinary Teas' Lapsang is that it manages to contain immense flavor with very little of the aftertaste common to lower-grade Lapsang Souchong.<br /><br />But how does it TASTE? The answer is both mysteriously complex and blindingly simple. A quick sniff of the pine-needle-roasted leaves brings forth the aroma of a campfire; this flavor carries well into the brewed tea, creating a strong, smokey aroma and flavor that does not fade as the tea cools. Culinary Teas' evenly fired, full-leaf Lapsang Souchong ought to be placed at the top of any tea enthusiast's shelf as the strongest, most impression-making tea in Culinary's collection. One does not forget the first experience with Lapsang. Do it right by using this brand.

review/summary: A fine cup of smoky tea
review/text: This Lapsang Souchong from Culinary Teas has a rich, complex flavor that surpasses quite a few other brands at a price that is comparable to or better than most.  A pound of loose tea can take a while to get through, though, so this may not be the best choice for someone looking to try smoked tea for the first time.  If you are already a fan of Lapsang Souchong and are looking for a satisfying cup, this is a great find.

review/summary: Less smoky flavor than some other Lapsang Souchongs
review/text: What first attracted me to the Lapsang Souchong variety of tea leaf is the distinct Latakia-like smoky flavor. This particular variety strikes me as unusually light on the smokiness. Granted my experience has so far been limited to the Twinings variety that comes in tea bags and the variety sold by Le Pain Quotidien bakeries. I thought that perhaps letting this tea steep a bit longer might help, but I've found that by the 5 minute point, the tea becomes disappointingly bitter and sour. I guess if you're looking for a more subtle, mild version of Lapsang Souchong this might be perfect.

I always get compliments on my pies and their crusts.<br /><br />It is sad that I must buy pie crust mixes from Amazon.  None of the 3 groceries in my town stock the mix any longer.  I make a lot of pies and quiches so I usually keep 4 or 5 mixes on hand.  This sells in a pack of 12 mixes so I have put the extra mixes in my freezer.

review/summary: Not great.
review/text: Now I don't consider myself a genoa salami expert, nor do I really know what separates genoa salami from any other kind of salami, but I do eat a lot of cured meats and love them. I have eaten everything from the cheap presliced salami in the grocery store sandwich supplies to boars head to high-end, "fresh" artisan products. This is the worst thing I have tasted. Slim jims are better than this. It smells exactly like canned dog food and tastes exactly how I would expect canned dog food to taste, but saltier. Maybe this is what genoa salami is really supposed to taste like, but if you don't know exactly what your getting don't buy this.<br /><br />Update: I let it sit out of the plastic package and air out over night and it was actually decent. Nothing special but edible at least. It still had the dog food smell. I made three other guys at work eat it and the one who eats anything said he loved it (although he wouldn't give me $5 for the whole case). Another guy walked around with a sour look on his face for 3 hours and the third agreed with me that it was decent and would be OK with crackers and a sharp cheese, but was nothing special. Because of these experiences I have updated my review from 1 star to 3 stars.

review/summary: Great Little Snack !!
review/text: Like the previous reviewer I am not a Salami expert but I love all forms of Salami. I don't agree with the previous reviewer that it smells like dog food but the smell is not so pleasant but it's cured meat most don't smell too great and what can you expect from meat that has been aging in a cellar. I enjoy these little Salami chubs as a little snack to tide me over til Dinner or whatever. Flavor wise it can be a bit salty. My main gripe about this Salami Chub is the oily-ness that's on the outside. I usually dab or wipe the chub with a napkin before eating to remove some of the oily-ness. Overall it's a great snack to have on the go. It's perfect for a romantic picnic @ the park. A bottle of wine, some cheese, crackers, and fruit with this Salami chub can make a great park-side brunch. (n_n)

It delivers what's advertised, each peace has the same beefy hazelnut in it.

They are so chewy that I could not bite off a piece. They have to be torn off with your teeth. Then there is the flavor or more accurately the lack of flavor. I guess with a good imagination, they might be said to taste like peaches, but they are pretty much tasteless. At 151 calories a serving, why bother?  Now I realize there is a terrible aftertaste!  Whoa, these are bad!

review/summary: lucy's cookies variety pack
review/text: I found all of Lucy's cookies to be awesome.  I am trying to avoid wheat and I love cookies and sweets,  I eat very healthy, and I only allow myself 2 cookies a day with almond breeze milk.  They taste great and also satisfy my sweet tooth.  Definitely worth getting.  I am on automatic send every 2 months. I might have to change it to every month!!! The Box of 4 variety pack.

review/text: I love these gluten-free cookies.  I used to buy them at Starbucks, but they are much more affordable through Amazon.  The only issue I have with them is that several cookies in each box are broken.  They obviously taste the same, but I can't use them for guests.  Will definitely buy again and again!

review/text: My all time favorite treat! These cookies are so amazing.  I found them at my local Starbucks.  It is great to find a treat like this that is not only gluten free/vegan, but tastes great, too. At around 130 calories a serve - you can't beat them.  I highly recommend these fabulous cookies!

review/summary: GP Chews Wrap in Plasic vs Parchment
review/text: All of Ginger People packagings can be difficult, It depends how they are stored. I love the flavor of all of their chews, I am a Ginger freak, I Love the health aspects of the product. Regarding their Packaging, It doesn't matter it they are wrapped in Plastic or Parchment Both styles can be a pain in the but. If they are stored in a cool dry p;ace, I find they are easiest to open, If they are warm to hot, Forget it, you will have a problem with both wrappers due to the nature of the product itself. I actually prefer the Plastic packing to the Parchment double wrap. Just pinch with your fingers just right or left of the center and they open right up. I order 22 pounds at a time, what does that tell you about the product.

review/text: I love Ginger Chews, I go out of my way to Las Vegas to buy Ginger Chews from this company. However, the Hot Coffee flavor isn't what I thought it would taste like. Yes, it is coffee but the candies are not wrapped in parchment as the Ginger Chews are but in mylar or somekind of wrap and it sticks to the mylar packaging. I may live in AZ but never had this issue with Ginger Chews. I have 23 remaining packages so I guess you know how I feel about this product.

review/summary: Childhood Scars
review/text: My Mom would buy me and my sister a box of Chocolate Pop-Tarts each.  My lovely sister, would eat her pop-tarts immediately, while I would wait till the weekend to eat mine (because I wanted to savor them.)  On Saturday morning, I would sit down to eat my pop-tarts and my sister would complain because she had no pop-tarts.  I tried to explain to my Mom that the reason she had no pop-tarts is because she had already eaten all of hers and that this box of goodness was mine.  Mom didn't care and made me share my pop-tarts with my little sister.  The sad fact is this didn't happen once or twice, it happened all the time.<br /><br />I'm now a grown up and I send my sister pop-tarts for her birthday.  The story isn't really a review but more a testomony to the greatness of Chocolate Pop-Tarts.  Be a kid again and order you a box or send some to someone you shared your childhood with

Mine showed up just fine being delivered in late may to south Alabama.  I ordered WAY too many though, so now they will become gifts to my friends.  What's better than a Pop-Tart?

review/text: I bought these pop tarts to stock my dorm room with breakfast material for when I rush out in the morning with 10 minutes until class starts.  They work perfectly fine for this purpose - they arrived in a large box with 8 smaller boxes in it, as stated in the description.  There was no damage to any of the 65 Pop-Tarts I have ate thus far since purchasing them, and none of them were stale or anything like that.  Do note you might get a little sick of them after a while though.

I've loved these things for 40+ years and quite frankly, don't really care about any of the other kinds except, of course, the cookies and cream which has ALWAYS been my absolute favorite!  What's really great about these though is that they're marvelous for desserts.  Just crumble them up really fine to make a better graham cracker chocolate crust, or to use as ice cream sundae toppings.  Golly, you could just paste them to the inside of your mouth and let them slowly dissolve too!  A chocoholics dream, but with vitamins!  Hey, we need all the excuses we can get, huh?  Highly, highly recommend!

review/summary: Spot of tea?
review/text: This is great tea. It is by no means Viagra, but it never claimed to be. It is all natural. The taste is ok. Not like Green tea. It has it's own unique flavor that takes some getting used to.<br />Since everyone is different, I'll speak about the effect it has on me. I felt the same at first. I drank about 3 cups a day for a few days and then drank about 1 a day. After about a week I tested it out on a lady friend of mine. I must say it made me feel 20 years younger! I'm late 49 years old now going on 30. Mind you, I was healthy before. I run 7 miles a week, Lift a few weights 3X a week (Light)I also don't drink and don't have ED yet. I hope it makes your package younger like it did for me. There is the chance that it may not work for you at all. By the same rules, it may make you even younger than me! I keep it in my toolbox at work so I'm always supplied. I found that my attitude is much more relaxed and calm. It's like going from a 6, back to an 8 cylinder motor. They'll both get you there. One just burns more rubbers!! Have fun and stay safe from child support and other annoying disasters.<br />One thing that happened with my order was that I received only 1 of the six boxes. The paperwork said that the shipment was complete! The box they shipped it in could only hold maybe 3 boxes if there were no packing cushions. I called Amazon and they quickly resubmitted my order of 6, meaning that I got a free box for my trouble. Since they corrected it on the spot, I gave them and the tea 5 stars. I'm all about good customer service. Order soon, or I'll order the rest.

review/text: I know this is a blend of all kinds of beans from wherever, but it is my favorite K-Cup for a good old fashioned, delicious cup of quality American coffee. It's like the donut house blend K-Cups or the stuff you get at your favorite diner, but from a source that has much higher quality standards, so it just tastes better. It keeps that same flavor profile you know and love. On the smallest setting, it's still not as strong as some of the more extreme extra bolds, but those are usually the nastiest tasting K-Cups. My wife likes a lighter cup, so she usually puts it on the medium or large size and adds milk or cream accordingly. It's perfect for people searching for that high quality "cup of joe."

review/summary: Tasty Bangers, but shipping/packaging issues detract
review/text: Our family loved the breakfast sausages that we had in Ireland, so I wanted to see if I could find them here. Tommy Maloney seems to be the leader in the States.<br /><br />My family and I really enjoyed the Moloney's sausages. Made in NY, they have much the same flavor and texture of the real thing in Ireland. I couldn't taste a difference. Note that these bangers are of the skinny variety -- about finger thickness. They brown up nicely in the skillet and have a satisfying snap when bitten. If you want thicker bangers, Maloney has those as well. We ordered five of the skinny link packages and two 8oz. tubes of the black pudding (also good, if you like black pudding of course).<br /><br />While we love the product, there is room for improvement in shipping. Our first shipment came on time, shipped by 2nd day air. Unfortunately, the meat arrived at a temperature of over 65 degrees Fahrenheit, not a safe temperature, so I had to discard the shipment. I should note that the temperatures in Texas at the time my shipment arrived were over 100 degrees F, and the package sat in the UPS truck all day long before being delivered to me. The meat was shipped in a cardboard box with a reflective bubble-wrap type of insulating bag. Inside of the bag were fully thawed ice packs and four fully-evaporated dry ice bags. The insulation just wasn't up to the challenge.<br /><br />I called Maloney's and received friendly customer service. They promised that they would reship the sausages when they could (they only ship to Texas on Mondays). I requested that they ship with more dry ice and insulation.<br /><br />The replacement package arrived as promised at a safe temperature. Still only one bubble-type insulating bag, but with extra dry ice bags. The dry ice had completely evaporated, but the standard ice packs were still mostly frozen.<br /><br />Maloney's has a great product, but shipping & packaging is critical to their mail-order customers. I'd suggest some improvements. First, consider double bagging the shipments in the bubble wrap or using styrofoam. Both of my shipments had a lot of condensation on the outside of the bubble wrap which made the cardboard box soggy. A lot of condensation on the reflective bubble wrap means that the bag isn't doing a good job insulating. I've had luck getting frozen pizzas and other meats shipped to me in styrofoam boxes with no problems. Styrofoam is probably more expensive, but when shipping in the summer, especially to the South, styrofoam is the right tool for the job. Second, consider using more dry ice; the dry ice isn't surviving for the two-day trip. Third, the plastic containers on three of the five sausage packages were cracked open in shipment. The plastic containers are too brittle to be stacked in a shipping box without some other kind of protection or support (cardboard, perhaps?). The cracked containers meant that juices from the sausages leaked into the bottom of the insulating bag, which made things a bit messy and required me to repackage the sausages for storage. Ultimately though, the sausages were delicious.<br /><br />Summing up, I love the product, and will order it again. If you miss your full Irish breakfast, now you can get it in the States. Customer service is great. Shipping, at least to hot parts of the country, could be improved. I hope that Tommy Maloney takes my suggestions in mind for its future shipments.

review/summary: Does work, leaves hole in pocket
review/text: I hosted a Flavor Tripping party at my university with about 60 people using these tablets. Needless to say, the tablets are quite a bit more sketch than offering berries, but considerably easier to obtain. The taste of the tablet isn't great, but isn't so bad anyone spit it out. After dissolving, I had a variety of foods for tasting available... about 95% of those who tried it seemed to enjoy it and have a noticeable difference with their taste buds. Some foods that worked well from my experience:<br /><br />- Grapefruit (this was by far the most impressive)<br />- Lemons<br />- Limes<br />- Apple Cider (nearly became too sweet to drink)<br />- Orange Juice (tasted particularly good)<br />- Vinegar (might give you a stomach ache, but hammers home the idea of how warped your tastes are)<br /><br />Many other foods had little or no effect (as expected): pretzels, chocolate, monster energy drink, peanuts, mints, etc. One or two were uncomfortable with what the tablets did to their taste buds and refused to sample anything more. Was not a big deal as it wears off in 15-30 minutes.<br /><br />Final verdict: A very fun one time treat, but far too expensive to use for anything other than parties. Amazon will get these tablets to you quickly, but if you have time before your event I would try to obtain some actual berries to avoid the sketchy factor.

review/summary: Miracle berries aside, these tablets are WEAK!
review/text: I decided to buy a packet of these to try because they are way easier to get than the actual berries, and a bit cheaper too.  So mistakenly, I ordered the double pack, 2 packages for 30 bucks.  TOTAL waste of money.  Ive tried real berries once about 4 years ago, and they were pretty good.  Granted, this isn't going to change your entire life perspective on food or anything, but some stuff does noticeably change, like lemons, grapefruit, beer, vinegar, etc...<br /><br />Now skip ahead to last week. We got the packages of MBerry's, and they came decently quick (I think it took like 8 days?), so no complaints there.  I opened the one package, and decided read the product description and such to make sure we did the tablets right.  The sellers/manufacturers recommend eating a 1/2 to 1 tablet, and mention that you can eat a 1/2 and get the same effects for less time.  BULL!  We all took one tab, let it fully dissolve on our tongues, being pretty particular about letting them sit and the saliva being swooshed around..you know the whole 9 yards to make sure we got max bang for our buck.  THEY SUCKED.  After about 15 mins we started trying foods, and even the things like lemons, grapefruit, etc.. that work with normal berries felt like they were working at HALF strength!  I could definitely tell the lemons were a little sweet, but they were also still tart!  And this wasn't just me, similar if not worse effects reported by 5 other people!!!<br /><br />Overall, I was really disappointed with these tablets.  Total waste of money, especially now that im stuck with an extra box as well.  Do yourself a favor and either A) Try another brand, or B) Get the read deal.  Hopefully Ill be able to sell my unopened package on ebay or craigslist....or to any of you!  So if your really set on a package, email me ill sell it to you for less than listed for sure! =)<br /><br />Hopefully someone benefits from knowing ahead of time, because i was also under false impression from the amount of glowing reviews, which all turned out to be PHONY.  WATCH OUT AND SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOMETHING THAT WORKS!!!

review/text: We tried this with grapefruit, lemons, limes, and sour candy. We will definitely be trying this again with more of the food that is listed in the description. Everyone seems to have their own reaction to miracle fruit, varying sensitivity but most people had a very positive experience after taking a whole tab, not just half. When you let it dissolve on your tongue it's a bit gross as it is mostly corn starch, but that passes quickly. We will definitely be buying this product more and having more "flavor tripping" parties, and I would recommend that anyone tries it at least once.

review/text: I had a very interesting experience with this product. And all of the claims are pretty true. But i will advise that the more liquids you try, the faster they wear off. My expirements with these tablets lasted about two hours. My group tried full tabs and i think that was a mistake; i would recomend a half. These tantalizing taste changers only work on sour things. P. S. -try some ice cold lemon juice, it tastes delicious.

review/summary: Tablets suck - look for pure miraculin
review/text: Like others, I found the effect really weak with these, even with two tablets per person. It was the same for everyone who tried them. I've used both the real fruit and the pure miraculin granules from the UK - both work much better. The fruit is great but expensive so you're probably best off trying miraculin rather than miracle fruit tablets.

review/summary: Good Product Good Bargain
review/text: If you plan on eating things good for you but not so tolerable on your tongue, this is the product for you. I can eat things I hate and things I just can't tolerate as though they were a glass of water or my favorite food when I pop an MBerry tablet in my mouth. Give it a minute and then eat. Whether it's something bitter to most like a lemon, or things I personally hate like eggplant or kiwi, this will do the trick for you.<br /><br />So, if your doctor recommends you eat something you do not like or tells you to reduce your sugar intake or eliminate it altogether; Drink your tea sugar free and eat those rice cakes (or whatever advised) and do it with ease if you bother to take one of these. I plan on buying more, and making them a part of my dietary routine.<br /><br />I purchased the 2 pack because you get more product for less money overall, and it was more than worth the buy.

review/summary: Great for those avoiding sugars
review/text: I first had these at a party...I was (am) doing South Beach and am in a still restrictive stage, though not a solid stage one and really thought this could make a difference after trying it with a lemon (that became lemonade) and a blander grape tomato (which became a sungold) and some goat cheese, that just got sweeter.<br /><br />My plan was to have a grapefruit and plain yogurt be a sweet treat and it totally worked, even the plain yogurt is sweeter. Gin, lime and soda water tastes like it's sweetened (not as much as say, Sprite). Same with unsweetened flavored seltzers. It's pretty amazing with the foods it works with. They are expensive, but it's doing wonders to keep me on track. And since they don't last very long with items as creamy as the yogurt I can't really overdo it, which is a total bonus. It also takes the bitterness out of teas and coffee. Dark stout beers get really sweet. Be careful. They're not all good, as in an all-the-time-thing, but it certainly is fun.

review/text: I originally saw these Miracle Berries on the Science Channel and thought they looked so cool. So I found these online and ordered them - and 20 tablets for $20 is a pretty good deal. They are supposed to make everything a little sweeter. I tried pickles, lemon juice, grapes and any other random food in my house. Over all, it was kind of anti-climatic. It's not all that exciting. And the tablet itself doesn't taste all that good. But I guess this berry would be good for people who love sugar but are trying to stay away from it.<br />You can go and buy it, it's worth a try. It's just not exciting as you think it will be.

review/summary: I'm sold!
review/text: Have been trying to figure out a way to quit smoking without the historical weight gain that follows when my body starts craving sugar like crazy in the absence of nicotine. So I ordered the M-Berry tablets in the hopes that they would enable me to consume things that are good for me and that will help in the detoxification process without feeling like I'm losing my mind and without wanting to eat everything in sight.<br /><br />I got my order today, was really hoping they would work, but was a little skeptical after reading some of the reviews, so I guess I was cautiously optimistic. I tried 1/2 a tablet, and a slice of lemon expecting it to , best case scenario taste "sweet-ish". Oh my gosh! The lemon tasted like a nice sweet lemonade, not "sweet-ish"--sweet. I was blown away. So I tried it with my pomegranate/aloe vera juice mix--amazing! The final test was my MSM/C mix which tastes very sour (from the vitamin C) and very bitter (from the MSM). I plan to start my day with the M-Berry tabs because they enable me to get those supplemenatal drinks down effortlessly. My husband has never heard of the miracle fruit, so I decided to do the lemon taste test with him, without telling him why I had him dissolve this 1/2 tablet on his tongue between his 2 lemon samples (I cut it in front of him and had him eat a piece before and after just so he could see that I had not added anything to the fruit. He was amazed as well. Had no clue why such a thing could be valuable, but at least I know it wasn't the placebo effect for me. I usually have challenges drinking enough water. I added some lemon to a bottle of water it tasted like lemonade. I am really excited.<br /><br />Yes, the tablets are a little pricey as supplements go, but M-Berry's pricing is very competitive with other sellers out there, and now I know the quality is good, and I don't have to worry about perishability like I would with the actual fruit.<br /><br />I will continue to buy them until my plant starts to fruit, and probably even after that just because they are so portable. I think they're great.

review/summary: Interesting product
review/text: I've had these tablets for a couple of years now and have used them a few times on occasion.<br /><br />I think it's a really interesting effect it has but it's really more of a one time thing.<br /><br />I can't imagine people having regular flavor tripping parties.  The fun factor would wear off very quickly.

review/text: This is the second time having a party with the miracle fruit!  It's so incredible that a Guinness tastes like a chocolate shake!  Lemons are incredible but the winner for the latest party is definitely GOAT CHEESE!  It tasted like FROSTING!!
