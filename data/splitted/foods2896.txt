review/summary: Great all around product
review/text: I bought this at my local health food store, not Amazon. It was on sale for a little cheaper. So far I tried this mostly on my skin and it is wonderful. It's slick, not greasy or heavy at all. I used it to soften my cuticles and I've never seen my nails look so radiant. Still haven't used it for my hair yet but I'll get to that sometime in the future.<br /><br />As for taking it as a supplement. The taste isn't bad. I do love the taste of coconut and for some reason I expected it to be slightly sweet but its not. It was hard to swallow a spoonful because the texture felt like I was eating lard. However, when spread on toast it is rather delicious. It's still to early to notice any difference on my health. Would buy again as a lotion though.

review/summary: I wish this worked for my Eczema :(
review/text: To be fair, I'm not the "Patch of Eczema here, patch of Eczema there" kind of person.  I'm head to toe, since birth - so I'm fairly used to things not working very well :)  However, I was really hopeful for this after seeing the reviews.  It smells like a handful of fresh coconut, which I thought was nice!  I liked the smell.  It's very mild.  You do have to scrape it ouf of the container and let it melt in your hands before applying.  You get used to it.  It doesn't absorb as well as other oils.  Kinds of sits on the surface, so before bed is best.  I still use it occasionally mixed with other creams and lotions.  On it's own, it wasn't enough for my skin.  No miracle cure here.  But its still a nice smelling body oil.<br /><br />I did not eat it.  I have stomach issues that make that easier said than done :)

review/text: I can't use this on my skin because it breaks me out and gives me pimples, but it's fine for my hair and I love the smell. The only negative about this is that it goes back to its hardened state in the cold and dries my hair, scalp and lips out which is why I'll probably switch to Jamaican black castor oil after I finish this up. Other than that I love this stuff. It makes my hands soft and my nails really nice, too.

review/summary: Great for dry skin/eczema!
review/text: I don't generally review products, but this works so well for me that I wanted to write about it in hopes someone with the same problem will read this and give coconut oil a try.<br /><br />For years I've been trying to find some sort of moisturizing lotion, ointment, or oil that would relieve my extremely dry skin. Lotions required constant reapplication, so they were expensive and inconvenient. Ointments were too thick and would make my skin hot and sometimes exacerbate itching. Baby oil didn't seem thick enough. The best solution I found was dissolving a bit of ointment in sesame oil with a dab of steroid ointment to control itching. It was okay, but not great. Plus, I quickly tired of smelling like popcorn.<br /><br />My dermatologist recommended that I try coconut oil. I've been astonished by how well it works. After only two days of use, my eczema rashes had faded considerably because they longer itched. Patches that I had for months were suddenly gone. The rest of my skin no longer feels dry and tight, which means no new rashes! I only have to apply coconut oil in the morning and after my shower with no need to reapply throughout the day. Best of all, I smell (quite literally) like a fresh coconut right after I apply it, and the scent fades rather quickly (so I don't get sick of it).<br /><br />I realize this sounds too good to be true, and I'll be sure to update if the product suddenly stops working. But for the time being, I'm absolutely thrilled with the improvement I've seen in my skin!

review/summary: Can't Ever Be Without
review/text: I don't want to ever be without this coconut oil. I have been using it for quite some time now, and am 69 yrs of age.  I went to see my doctor for my six mths check up,  and she was amazed at my colostrol levels.  She said they were perfect, and wondered what my secret was.  I didn't tell her my secret,  but I do stay away from fatty foods,  and use this cooking oil for frying,  and also baking,  and it gives my food a wonderful flavor.  Tasting this oil alone,  has a delicious coconut taste,  but that same taste doesn't show up in the foods that I use it in, and I don't think one can beat this price anywhere.  I was paying twice as much as this from another company,  plus shipping and handling, but this is a super deal,  no postage,  and half the price.  I just hope Natures Way will never stop having this coconut oil available, I also like the fact that it is organic.  I will continue ordering this oil as long as it is available.

review/text: So I started using this the day I received it in the mail (fast shipping btw) and I'm glad I made the purchase.  I use this 1-2 times a day when I have a smoothie, sometimes as a little spread on my toast, and for my skin.  I have very sensitive skin (on my face and back) so I tend to use it everywhere else on my body.<br /><br />In regards to the supplement, it does in fact suppress your appetite, which will than lead to smaller portion control if you were ever to stop using this as a supplement.<br /><br />My next step would be to use it for a replacement of cooking oil but hopefully the meat won't have that taste of coconut...I love coconut but not to that extent.

review/summary: Different from Nutiva
review/text: I have always used Nutiva brand coconut oil and ordered this brand to try because it was on sale. From now on I will probably keep both brands in the house as I found them to be pretty different from one another and useful for different purposes. The Nutiva brand definitely has a lot more coconut flavor, adding a lot more flavor to smoothies or in cooking. This brand absorbs into the skin a lot faster, without leaving the oily film on top of the skin, so I will continue to use this coconut oil for skin and hair care.

review/summary: Great Product for sealing moisture in your hair!
review/text: I love this product! I usually mix it with shea butter and olive oil and apply it to my hair over my conditioner to seal in the moisure. I works great because I have been retaining hair length and I rarely experience any breakage. The smell is okay and its texture is good. I also use this same mixture as a skin moisturizer and also to wash my face using a oil cleansing method. I haven't had any new breakout since I starting using it. Overall, its a good buy!

review/summary: Coconut Oil
review/text: I chose this coconut oil because of the many positive reviews it received. I love everything about this product! I am a college student, and the water that I use here at school (to shower) is very drying to my skin. This coconut oil combats the drying effects of the water and leaves my skin feeling so soft. It glides on smooth and absorbs quickly. It also smells wonderful! Everyone in my family LOVES it. I would highly recommend it to others.

review/text: I have been using this as a moisturizer (less than a teaspoonful) for my entire body and it hasn't caused any breakouts, even on my face. For this price, it is very economical and a purer moisturizer compared to many lotions. It melts in your hand and a little bit goes a long way.  It has a very slight coconut scent which reminds me of the beach and suntan lotion. It doesn't have a greasy feel and it doesn't transfer to clothes as long as you use just a little bit - you won't need much.

review/summary: Smooth and Tasty
review/text: I have been using this coconut oil for the past few days and I am happy with the results.  I first tried it on its own and the consistency was not too appealing to me, so I began putting it in my meals and that works better for me.  I have also used a portion of it with some Shea Butter as a moisturizer and it works great as well.  It seems to me the uses are endless.  I can see that I will be purchasing another container of this because it is so versatile and all natural.  I really love that and I love this coconut oil.  It does have a slight coconut taste and smell.  I get a hint of it when i cook with it but it is does not over power any of the dishes that I make with it.  Also it absorbs very quickly into the skin leaving it soft but not greasy and there is slight coconut smell but it fades quickly once absorb into the skin.  It is a bit pricey and is definitely an investment.  The serving size of 1 tablespoon 3-4 times a day is a bit much and will contribute to the necessity of purchasing another jar quicker than I would like.  Overall, very happy with my purchase.  As always thanks Amazon for such a wide and wonderful selection of products.

review/text: I have been using this stuff for 2 months and I absolutely love it for cooking.  I also use it for my body, face and hair.  Not sure about all the healthy hype but it is a must try product.  You do have to get use to the consistency depending on the weather it could be in a liquid form or hard.  It is a great moisturizer I have very dry skin, after 2-3 minutes you no longer feel oily and the slight smell of coconut also disappears.  I do moisturize before I go to bed not sure if I would do it in the morning before I get dress for work, I would be worried it might ruin my clothes.  So far I don't see any oily stain on my clothes of bed sheets. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003B3OOPA">Nature's Way Organic Coconut Oil, 16 Ounce</a>

This has a very very mild flavor. It almosts tastes like a creamy butter spread. I'm loving it. It's great for skin as well, although I recommend if you're getting this for eating and skin/hair care either buy 2 different tubs, or take out some and put it in a seperate container for your skin care. You don't want to have germs in it. I think it's a great price for a great product.

review/summary: The many uses of coconut oil...
review/text: I purchased this item about a month ago. I wanted to wait until I had an opportunity to really use the product in many ways and to gauge the results.  I started out taking tablespoon as soon as I purchased it...and soon discovered that other reviewers are correct - some people have to work their way up to taking a tablespoon. Now I take a table spoon in the morning mixed with a protein shake. Sometimes, I mix it in hot coffee or tea. I have also started taking an additional tablespoon in the afternoon either spread on crackers or a small piece of bread.  As a food, it gives me an extra boost of energy and seems to make me more alert.  I have begun to lose weight but I am not certain if this is because of the coconut oil or because I have implemented a walking routine. Either way, it gave me the energy to want to get up and get moving! I also use it as a moisturizer on my skin. It does go on rather oily, but it absorbs quickly. I just have to make certain that I give myself enough time for the oil to absorb before putting on certain fabrics. I was in awe regarding how soft my skin felt. Rough patches are now smooth.  I have stopped using a popular African American hair moisturizer on my son's hair and began using this.  All I can say is his hair loves coconut oil. It improved his texture.  I have also used it on an area of his head that seemed prone to razor bumps.  It is healing well. Finally, I read that this is safe for dogs.  I gave some to my dog and now he demands it each morning. He loves it too.

review/summary: Smells fresh and moisturizes well
review/text: This oil smells like fresh coconut, which is what a good-quality coconut oil should smell like. It had a few pieces of real coconut floating at the bottom, which actually made it feel much more "authentic" to me. Interestingly enough, it arrived in liquid form (it's hot here) and I slathered it on my elbows right away. It worked great! Softened and smoothed them and got rid of that leathery feel. Can't wait to use it as a full-body moisturizer after a shower (just not on the face--never put coconut oil on the face if you don't like clogged pores).

review/summary: great for diaper rash and whatever ails you!
review/text: I bought this product because I read that organic coconut oil helps heal and sooth diaper rash.  Not only did it work amazingly, but I love how it smells. I've used it on my baby for massages and an all-over moisterizer.  It also worked when my baby had a little bit of dry scalp.  I have used it in for me in my hair as a de-frizz serum, on knees and elbows for healing really dry skin, and also as chapstick.  Great product at a great value!

review/summary: Wonderful stuff!
review/text: I use this coconut oil on my face and body as a moisturizer and I love it!  The smell is wonderful (yes, it smells like coconut).  It arrived as a solid but if I put it in the sun or set it in some warm water it becomes a liquid oil. I find I can put it on my skin in either liquid or "solid" states because even solid it is still very soft.

review/text: This product is pricey, but is a much healthier alternative to many other cooking oils. I used it in my hair conditioner, my lotions, and for cooking and it works great for all. I even brushed about a teaspoon into my dog's fur and it made her coat softer and shinier and helped her to smell much better. I am happy to have purchased this item.

review/summary: Great in smoothies!
review/text: I didn't realize that coconut oil could be used as a moisturizer? I put a tablespoon in my smoothies and I can't even taste it. I add it because of the health benefits for your immune system, maintaining cholesterol levels, prevention of other illnesses & I thought I read somewhere that it helps alleviate stress. I like this brand, and it's organic.

I have been using the oil both in my hair and on my skin and there is such a stark contrast from  being dry  to moist, especially my hair.

I use it for cooking, drop a plop into a smoothie, use it on my skin and hair...all great so I won't revisit all of that.  This product specifically is a very high quality and the price on Amazon is phenomenal. It arrived promptly and in good condition.  Nature's Way sells some great products.  This is no exception.

review/summary: Nutiva fan now in love with Nature's Way!
review/text: When buying coconut oil, I often research every option possible and compare the price per ounce.  I make and sell granola and need to get the best price possible without sacrificing quality.  I decided to try a jar of this, because it was the lowest price, yet still organic and extra virgin.  I am so glad I did!  I actually prefer it, because it stays liquid until you open it.  In order to use coconut oil in my granola, I have to melt it first.  This brand, I did not have to melt first, only if I used some from an already-opened jar.  So it is just fine with me, actually better, that it comes in small jars. I ordered quite a lot more after trying it, afraid the price would go up after all the EVCO fans caught on to the deal.  Thanks, Nature's Way, I love it!!!

review/summary: Miracle Stuff!
review/text: It cured my dry, itchy, bumpy skin (arms & legs) by second day - just use it like lotion after shower while skin is still moist/damp (I used loofah scrub first).  My skin feels like baby skin and itching is gone.  It really smells nice after soaking into your skin, which happens pretty quickly, and greasiness is gone - I can't stop smelling my arms.<br /><br />Also use this in cooking a lot.  It was great with banana bread - just substitute 1/4 to 1/2 of melted butter called for in the recipe (don't substitute all the butter, I believe the bread will be drier if you just use coconut oil).  As a kid, we used pure coconut oil as hair conditioner in my hometown.  So tonight, I will use it on my heels because they are always dry since I wear sandals a lot.  I bought this in Amazon a while back and it was very cheap compared to WholeFoods price.

review/summary: Wonderful EVCO Product
review/text: This is my first time purchasing coconut oil, and I have no prior experience with it.  It is white and in solid form, but easily liquifies in the palm of your hands, and it has a light and very pleasant coconut smell to it.  It tastes good (a light coconut flavor), but I use this product mainly for my hair, nails and skin.  It makes my skin soft, and my nails and hair are subjectively stronger and healthier looking.

review/summary: It's a Liquid?
review/text: I'm confused. I planned to use this product in place of butter and as a lotion. Unfortunately, it arrived in a liquid form. I guess our climate is still too warm. I put it in the refrigerator but it got way too hard. I love the potential, but not sure it's really going to work for me. For now, I've been spooning it on my pancakes and bagels, and it tastes just fine. Hopefully, it'll act a little more like butter in a couple of months when the house cools down to around 70 degrees.

review/summary: Stained bedsheets, but overall good for face/neck area
review/text: I was very excited when I had read all the reviews, and so far no negative comments.<br />I experienced a slight break out , but nothing to worry out, as many others stated, definitely sticking with it. As it feels very smooth on your face.<br />Just try out how much to use, not more then half of a small nail size for sure, otherwise it will be to oily.<br />I was reluctant to try tasting it, but it really tasts very good, unless you hate coconut.<br />Will definitely try it for cooking as I have two different containers.<br /><br />When I had a small acne breakout, and one of those undercover pimples that threaten to come out and stay around for days it was gone in 3-4 days and never surfaced. So so far very good. Will keep using it and update accordingly.<br /><br />Only thing I want to caution everyone, after showering I decided to use it as all over body oil, I recall rubbing it in , but obviously not good enough , as I did go to bed an hour or so later, and the next morning I noticed dark grey stained spots on the bedsheet, I tried to wash them and use stain remover but no luck, I also saw there were some stains on the bathrope. So just be cautiouse when you apply it, how much etc.
