review/summary: Not high quality tea
review/text: I'm not sure why Tazo tea is so popular. Their tea is low-quality and bitter. The K-cups are no different than the bags, however, if you are looking for a comparison. I'm not really a tea person, though I have tasted around the UK and Hong Kong, so I know a bit about tea. Tazo is awful! Particularly their green tea or Zen.

review/text: High quality dutch processed cocoa.  Unique packaging also - the inner paper liner is attached to the top carton flaps in a way that helps prevent spilling the powder while you are scooping it out and also provides a better closure/ seal when you close the box.  Great results with the very first cake I made using this powder.

review/summary: Hard to find summer stick ice pops
review/text: These FlavorIce stick ice pops have been a favorite since my youth, and are still around today though VERY hard to find in local supermarkets.  Unfortunately I think most stores don't stock them because they want you to purchase the costlier popsicles and ice creams that only last a short while, instead of these long-lasting, cooling, refreshing low priced skinny pops that you freeze as needed, and are always a satisfying low calorie treat.  It is nice to see them available on Amazon, as in New York the only supermarket I can still find them in is Pathmark, and they run out fast.  Kids love these too.

review/text: We LOVE gnocchi! We discovered it many years ago, and are always on the look out for it at restaurants.  The brand we used to purchase, we could no longer find, so I turned to trusty Amazon.com, and found the DeCecco brand.  We are always skeptical of anything new in the gnocchi area, and I have to say, we have decided that this brand is even better than what we were using before!  We LOVE to have gnocchi with pesto sauce for dinner, and this particular brand is awesome!  You will not be disappointed in the flavor, and the price is not bad either!  As a matter of fact, I think I am nearly out of gnocchi, and will be needing to place another order very soon!

review/text: I love gnocchi, but I am terrible at making them.  I have been spoiled growing up with my mother (from Italy) and aunts (from Italy) all making the most amazing gnocchi.  That being said, I have to say that the DeCecco gnocchi, although not tasting "homemade," are the best purchased gnocchi I've tasted.  I've already ordered 2 packs of 12!  Its great for a last minute meal if you have sauce in the fridge as they cook in a few minutes.  Great with bechamel or white sauce too.

review/summary: Good, but not a re-order item for me
review/text: These gnocchi are good.  The texture is right, a nice balance of springy and fluffy.  (Watch them continuously while they're cooking.  They cook very quickly and can be overcooked easily.)  But of the three packages I've cooked so far, all had a very slight sour taste.  They weren't spoiled in any way, just had a slightly tangy flavor that I don't associate with gnocchi.  It's not noticeable with a red sauce but is with a lighter flavored sauce.  I don't know if this taste is typical of the brand.  I probably won't re-order these because I like dried pasta for tomato sauces, but they are definitely worth trying.

I've tried to eat them twice and both times my stomach was upset for hours.

review/text: I'll be honest... King Arthur (KA) is actually my favorite, but I really cannot afford it in this economy. Good old Gold Medal (GM) works okay for me in its place.<br /><br />The only problem I have with it is that Amazon's GM is too expensive. At the time of this writing, the price would be $4.58 per 5 lb. bag and my local Walmart sells it for about half that. Heck, you can buy KA's brand at their official site for $4.95 per 5 lb bag. Why would I pay almost as much for a lesser brand? Truth is, I'm not going to.<br /><br />Anyway, if you can find it cheaper, it's a good deal. The present price is too expensive, so I wouldn't recommend it.

review/text: Being allergic to dairy, gluten and not wanting to eat soy due to the health problems associated with heavy soy consumption, I looked into hemp protein as a source of easily digestible protein to help bulk up when working out.<br /><br />Thankfully I was pleasantly surprised and have ordered 4 more canisters of ruth's hemp protein powder(2 just hemp, 2 with sprouted flax) and will order more of the Maca when I run out as this one contains Maca and it's advisable to only take 5g of Maca per day(1 serving of this has 5g) since it's just an effective energy booster.<br /><br />The taste isn't bad at all. I mix a scoop of the powder with some unsweetened almond milk, just a bit of fruit and some chia seeds and it tastes good. It does have a bit of an earthy taste, a kick of sorts but it doesn't bother me at all and I'm glad that you don't have to add tons of sugary fruit to cover up the taste.<br /><br />As far as how it works, the powder is a great meal replacement or another meal if you're trying to gain weight. The powder itself provides 11g of Protein(with the sprouted flax one providing 13g and the standalone hemp powder one providing 15g) and they all have about 120-140 calories so adding 2 scoops, some milk and some fruit and even some nuts is a good calorie boost. It also provides a lot of energy due to the protein being easily assimilated and the maca being an excellent energy booster on its own.<br /><br />Nutritionally, this thing is a champ with a great Omega 6:Omega 3 ratio(3:1 which is the optimal healthy range) as well as being a great source of dietary fiber to keep the intestinal tract healthy and having many vitamins and minerals(being an excellent source of Zinc and Vitamin E, 2 minerals which can be hard to get in our daily diets). Overall, this a great product that I recommend wholeheartedly and will continue to use for a while.

I use this with 10oz of almond milk, 5-6 frozen strawberries and a 1/2 frozen banana (Blended up in my Vitamix).  The only thing about this powder is that it does have a distinct taste, I like it but some may not.

This is the BEST JARRED sauce I have found - better than Rao's, and better than Francis Ford Coppola's brand (my two previous faves). This tastes FRESH from the garden and can be used for so much more than a pasta sauce. I use it for grilled vegetables, ratatouille, cous cous, soups, mediterranean bean dishes, and imitation meat products. The flavors will blow you over. This is truly exceptional.  I can't believe it sells for $5.95 in Florida (based on the other reviews). Here in California, we get to pay $10 a jar, but it's worth it. Highly recommended!!!

Whole cloves of roasted garlic and fresh basil leaves made the sauce look like I spent the whole day cooking.<br /><br />We purchased it at Publix for abour $6.50 for a 24 ounce jar.  Yep, it's pricy compared to the $.89 Hunts Four Cheese tomato sauce, but I think it was worth it. I look forward to trying other varities of Mom's.

review/summary: Mama Mia!
review/text: When I first looked at this sauce at our local Publix, I was a startled to see large cloves of garlic and whole leaves of basil floating around. Well, I just had to try it. Delicious! A wonderful, fresh taste but not highly acidic (as young/fresh sauce can be) as I'd feared, which is a good thing because of my acid reflux. The garlic pieces weren't at all hot or bitter. They were soft and creamy and, with the basil, added a sweet element to the sauce...which is a good thing because there are plenty of them, and I didn't relish the idea of picking them out.<br /><br />A bit pricier than what I normally buy, but the taste is worth the extra expense. Like the other reviewer said: very chunky. So bear that in mind if you buy. I put mine in smaller one-cup containers and froze them as I'm cooking for one and didn't want any excess to go to waste. Thawed perfectly and with no discernable difference in taste or texture.<br /><br />Love it plain with rotini.

review/summary: The best
review/text: I've been buying commercial pasta sauces all my life and rarely have found any I especially liked.  The few I did like were too expensive to buy on a regular basis. When I heard about Mom's, I was skeptical and the price was higher than I'd usually consider paying, but after reading the rave reviews, I gambled and bought some.<br /><br />Wow!  Apart from the fact that it's the best I've purchased, it's not as expensive as it seems because I use less of it than I do with other commercial pasta sauces. I don't seem to need as much as I do with other sauces I've bought.<br /><br />I knew from reviews about the whole garlic cloves and basil leaves it contains, but I was skeptical until I saw them in person.  Impressive!<br /><br />I'll definitely buy more.

review/text: These particular cookies are difficult to find and my family loves them.  We have had them before and found them available on Amazon.  Cookies tasted great, came in a reasonable time - I even send a 3 pack as a gift to my parents also.  The only complaint is that the cookies were not intact when either of us received them.  They were crumbled; still tasted good but could not have served to guests.  Even though they were not whole cookies upon receipt, I would still recommend this item to anyone who likes shortbread cookies.

The texture is sublime, the taste is sweet without being cloying, and the versatility of this product is unparalled; it enhances any dish that's savory or spicy, it's not limited to Indian food although it does pair magnificently with that type of cuisine, of course.  If you've tried the rest, now it's time to try the best.

review/summary: Staple in my diet
review/text: I have been using this product for about 3 years now.  When I was on Weight Watchers I would use no-fat egg substitute instead of eggs and apple sauce instead of oil, and each muffin would only be 2 points.  And They.Are.Yummy.  Now that I'm off WW, I still make them the same way because they taste just as good, and who needs the extra fat.  I also like them because of the fiber and that's all I'll say about that.  I used to get them at a warehouse store (3 packs), but that store stopped selling them.  They are not cheap in the regular grocery store, so a friend recommended I see if they sell them through Amazon's subscription service and they did!  Still not as cheap as they used to be at the warehouse store, BUT with the free shipping, they are much cheaper than going out the store and buying them.  I eat two muffins a day, every day.  LOVE them.

review/text: My grandaughter received her giant gummy bear for her birthday in Soldotna, AK.  We viewed the gift opening via web cam.  The squeels and laughter could have been heard in Wisconsin, even without the web cam.  The whole family was oohing and aahing.  My daughter clued me in on the wish and that Shannon (my granddaughter was told, no way on the bear.  "It's the best birthday ever!", Shannon proclaimed.  She wants to keep it whole for awhile, before she starts sharing her bear with friends.  According to my daughter, Shannon's friends, both kids and adults were also blown away with the giant Blue Raspberry Gummy Bear.  My other son-in-law loves gummy bears too, and I have given him the giant bags in the past.  This might be a good idea for him this Christmas.  You really made the day for a lot of kids and adults.<br />Sincerely, Grandma Linda

review/text: This gummy bear was absolutely delectable. I'm so tempted to buy another one, but I can't, as I'm trying to get into better shape. Sorry, but it's simply unhealthy. That said, if you have no concern about that or no need to better maintain that, then I absolutely recommend this product. It was absolutely delicious.<br /><br />I actually took a strong pair of kitchen scissors I have and used them to cut off slices of the gummy candy and ate it that way. It was easier to eat and gave better acces to the favors of subsurface candy.<br /><br />Seriously, I wish I could eat ten of them. If I'm at a place where I feel I can afford the slack, I will absolutely buy another one, especially at $20. The price is a good price/oz. The regular $30/bear is a bit steep.

review/text: Besides spending $30 on a gummy bear, my friends are all shocked when they see me carrying around a gummy bear the size of a football. And not to mention, it weighs a lot more than one! The raspberry flavor is sweet, but not overly sugary- and I love it! My teeth are sensitive, but I love sweets(hence the issues) and it doesn't make my teeth 'sting' because of high sugar content. I would buy this for my kids if I had any, but I'm having enough fun nibbling on the ears as I carry it around. If you have the money to blow, buy one now!

review/text: I bought this for my husband, but had no idea the kids would love this, too!  The yogurt covered clusters are delicious and they mistook this for a kid cereal.  I'm so happy since it's full of whole grains and fiber.  This one is a HIT!

review/summary: Yummy
review/text: I ordered through Amazon Subscribe & Save.  The cost savings over supermarkets was significant enough considering there are no shipping charges, tax or wear and tear on the car.  The yogurt chunks are delicious and when combined with the cereal and milk are great tasting.  I also like to eat dry as a healthy alternative to snacking on junk food.  They have a high fiber content and are a good alternative to other similar cereals.

review/summary: Yummy in my tummy, and my wallet is happy too!
review/text: I really like this cereal, and my local grocery store cells it between $4 and $5 a box, so this was a big deal for me. My sister says Target carries it for around the same price per box, but I'm not going to go to Target just for cereal, it's so much easier just to have it shipped to my front door! Not to mention, Amazon grocery is super cool about returns if you have an issue. Save yourself the time, energy, and maybe some money, and order it online.

review/text: Got this for 1/4 the price of my local supermarket, and it was delivered right to my door.  Seem to go through a box so quickly, so having the extra bulk around the apartment isn't so bad. Plus, I'll dump two into a sealed cereal saver, and keep it nice and crispy.  Get a couple more items and Super Saver Shipping, and it's a steal.

But this Special K fruit and yogurt is soooo good! I find myself eating if for two meals a day sometimes. I have it on auto order for monthly delivery and that isn't enough. I end up having to go buy one box before my next delivery some months. I'm addicted!

review/summary: 3/4 cup, Don't Kid Yourself!
review/text: The latest addition to Special K cereals is Special K Fruit & Yogurt, which consists of "rice and wheat flakes, oats & fruit clusters and yogurt-coated clusters" which together give a great tasting cereal. It's crunchy, and has a variety of textures due to the berry oat clusters, the yogurt and the flakes.<br /><br />I definitely preferred this variety over the Special K Low Carb Cereal, which I did not care too<br />One serving Special K Fruit & Yogurt cereal is 3/4 cup, and that's important to remember. I recently took the time to actually measure out 3/4 cup of cereal - it's really not much! I thought before that I only ate about 3/4 cup cereal, but it turns out that I probably eat more like 1.5 cups. By the way - have I ever mentioned that every healthy kitchen should at least have cup measures, teaspoon measures, and if you're really healthy - a scale too?! But back to the nutrition label. One 3/4 cup serving has 120 calories, only 1 gram of fat, 11 grams of sugar and 35% of many vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />I'm adding this to the list of my favorite cereals!

review/text: We really like this cereal.  The fruit clusters are actually dried apples according to the ingredients.  The yogurt clusters are just flavorfull enough to really make this cereal delicious.  We mix it with Kellogs Real Fruit cereal which has strawberry and blueberry in it.  As good as it is though, the price is too high for what it is.  We only buy it when it goes on sale, which is sometimes as low as 2 for $5, and then we buy a years worth of it.

review/summary: gotcha
review/text: Kellogg's Special K Fruit & Yogurt Cereal, 17.5 oz<br />Although the box shows red and blue berries, this "variety does NOT contain berries.<br /><br />Instead there as tiny snippets of red apples that could appear to the eye to be tiny specks of "berries".<br />The product label does not list any fruit other than apples, and LOADS of sugar -honey,malt etc etc<br /><br />To top of their gotcha, Kellog has reduced the size of the box by 5 ounces, from 18 to 17.6 oz.<br /><br />While introducing this Fruit variety some 2 weeks ago, the strawberry special K variety was "temporarily " unavailable . It is now again marketed - as Special K with berries -  strawberries just like the original , but  with size reduced to 16.7 oz.<br /><br />Instead of offering a reliable and consistent product, Kellog seems to have resorted to introducing ever increasing variations, each one more sugary-sticky  than the other, each one cut by a few ounces. Confusing the consumer with name brand loyalty. Or shall we call this marketing approach "fooling"?<br /><br />TRUST BUT VERIFY

review/text: I started my Maine Coon on this food when he was a year old. A  year later, I got another cat and needed regular food for the second one.<br />The Maine Coon actually prefers this food as opposed to the smaller kibble.<br />He is now 5 years old and very healthy with a soft shiny coat and still active and playful. I contribute his health and well-being in a large part to this food. It can be hard to find in pet stores, so I purchase online,<br />No problems with delivery at all. If you have a Maine Coon, trust me, buy this food and start them early.

review/text: My MC like-d only one brand of cat food prior to bringing this food home for her.  SHE LOVES THIS FOOD!!  We just got a 2nd Maine coon, and the breeder suggested this food...  Not sure what is in it, but she goes crazy for this food.  She is a smaller Maine Coon, so it will be interesting to see if she begins to fill out a bit on this food. It is pricey, but overall worth the $ as she's eating more and her coat after 2 weeks is already looking fuller and prettier!  The kibble is bigger, but she is able to handle it and doesn't seem to mind the size. Definatly worth a try if you have a Maine coon.

review/text: Reviewing a cat food seems... I dunno, a bit strange and obsessive. Still, our MC Cleo likes her crunchies---she's a slave to crunchies of any kind. But for some reason, this particular brand and type are the cat's pajamas. She'll do anything at all for "Formula 31" crunchies and has been known the gnaw the bag if it is left out. The kibble is a bit larger than average. Who knows if it is actually better for her? But she eats it like a lion.

review/summary: Yeah they like it because it is just junk food.
review/text: After feeding this cereal to my Maine coon who was 6, for only 8 months, he died of bladder stones. URI After his tragic death, I decided to research what caused his demise.l I found that dry cat foods are in now way suitable for any cat because of plant based proteins, not animal based. Cats can't digest plants they are carnivores.  high usage of grains, high levels of carbs and of course no water. Do Yourself a favor and feed only wet food to your cat. This stuff or any dry food is  nothing more than meat flavored cereal, made the same way as Capetian Crunch. If you don't beleive my review, do your own research. My other cat who is just a year will only eat wet food now which is low in all the bad stuff and roughly 75% water. Hydration in cats is everything.

review/text: One of my Amazon reviewer friends called my attention to birch beer after I had posted a review of Mexican Coca Cola (surprisingly good, by the way). I had heard of birch beer in the distant past, but hadn't seen it or reference to it for at least 3-4 decades. I guess it was one of those old fashioned things that had largely faded away. Out of curiosity, I stopped in at the local Bevmo store and there was a variety of birch beers. Ibought a couple bottles of Sioux City Birch Bear, just to give it a try. Well, it's old fashioned, all right, coming in bottles, but modern in having the newer twist-off caps. I looked at the ingredients and was dismayed to find High Fructose Corn Syrup listed. I expected all cane sugar. I also noticed artificial flavoring and coloring. Hmmmmm. What's so old fashioned here? I drank the sodas. It was a nice refreshing taste that reminded me of a weak, watery root beer. I was also surprised that it had very little carbonation. Is this the way birch beer is supposed to taste? I'm somewhat disappointed. I doubt if I'll buy any more of this brand, but I may well try some other brand.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Herb-y and Unusual
review/text: ****<br />This Green Tea Energy from Yogi Tea is a "natural energy boost".  It's an unusual, rather herb-y tasting natural herbal tea made from organic green tea leaf, Asian (Panax) ginseng, organic lemongrass, organic spearmint leaf, ginseng-eleuthero extract (Panax ginseng, Panax quinquefolium, Eleutherococcus senticosus), and kombucha . The taste is very difficult for me, and the kombucha comes across extra strong. I predict that you'll either love or hate the taste of this tea; try it first before you buy it in large quantities.<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Green Tea Energy comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site, yogitea.com, is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />According to Yogi Tea, this tea is 70% organic and is intended to enhance the immune system and to fight fatigue. It contains 28mg of caffeine (compared to 90mg in an 8oz cup of coffee).<br /><br />I gave this tea only four stars because the taste is so hard for me to handle. It is, however, a quality tea, and if you like it, there are many benefits to be gained.<br /><br />Recommended, if you can stand the taste.<br />****
