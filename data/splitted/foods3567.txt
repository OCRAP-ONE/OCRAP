review/summary: Coffee People Jet Fuel Dark Roast K-Cup
review/text: I was looking for a suitable substitute for my favorite k-cup coffee which was no longer available (Green Mountain Organic Espresso).  Jet Fuel appeared by its description to be a possibility.  Delivery was prompt and the price for 60-cups was competitive (much less expensive than the Green Mountain Espresso).  It is indeed a robust smooth tasting coffee, although not a "suitable substitute" for the Green Mountain Espresso.  I am enjoying the Jet Fuel, but will continue to look for an Espresso k-cup.  I hope Coffee-People will do something about replacing the Green Mountain Espresso favorite with an Espresso of its own.

review/summary: Great Flavor, perfect early morning wake up coffee!
review/text: I drink a cup of Jet Fuel every morning. I have found that this has the perfect amount of caffeine. I drink a cup of this and a cup of standard coffee (Starbucks) every day. Jet fuel does a great job waking me up without giving me the shakes however, I have found that if I drink more than 1 cup, I do get a little jittery. I've been drinking this stuff since day one of my Keurig purchase and I will continue to order it. I love bold coffees and this fits right in there. I recommend this to anyone looking for a full roast bold tasting coffee.

review/text: This is ok coffee, I love their donut shop coffee, but this jet fuel is very unique and I am not a fan (were they going for a fuel-y taste?).  I like Green Mountain Dark Magic much better for just very strong, not as bitter taste.  I don't plan on purchasing again.

review/text: I inherited my Keurig from my late mother. Store coffee pods seemed too weak. I read the reviews for "Jet Fuel" and decided to order 50 pod package. I like a bold coffee but this has a very bitter taste. I'm going to try again, after descaling the coffee maker. If flavor improves, I'll gladly retract my remarks. If not, I won't be buying THIS coffee again.<br />06/27/2012: Descaled Keurig coffee maker. Jet Fuel coffee was STILL too bitter for my taste. Perhaps my taste has changed. Whatever the reason, I WON'T be buying THIS coffee again.

review/summary: like espresso, black? try this one
review/text: I'm an espresso guy, but I just got tired of cleaning up the mess. So I've tried about 5 high-quality Keurig options by now, trying to find that dark taste without going into gross and overdone. I'd never have guessed it from the name, but this one does it.  Obviously, it helps to try them out yourself. But for what it's worth, I find a lot of the ones labelled French or Italian roast aren't dark, they are just overly strong...like dumping hot sauce on a dish, not getting the flavors right.<br /><br />The bonus of the K-cup system is, I can make myself a cup of coffee so fast I don't really lose the momentum of my work.  The downside is, I don't have that nice espresso-making ritual to give my eyes and brain a rest.  ALMOST enough to make me dig out the espresso maker.

review/summary: Burnt, Not Bold
review/text: We really enjoy Bold and Extra Bold Coffee so I bought a box of Crazy Cups Dark Roast Keurig Cups which has several different brands/kinds of dark roast coffee. Jet Fuel is by far the least tasty of the brews. The coffee was on the weak side for a Bold Blend, but had a burnt aftertaste. This coffee is not for those who enjoy a really rich, bold taste. So far, Dark Magic has been our favorite of the varieties in the box.

review/summary: Our favorite extra-bold K-cup--dark, rich, full-bodied
review/text: Jet Fuel is our favorite of the Coffee People "extra-bold trilogy"--Jet Fuel, Wake Up Call, and Black Tiger. It's dark, sweet, and rich, with a fuller body than Wake Up Call or Black Tiger. It has a clean finish and notes of chocolate and honey.<br /><br />We also love the new packaging. Since K-cups are nitrogen-packed, the coffee doesn't go stale, so the last cup is as good as the first. If there are a couple of dark-roast lovers in your family, a box of 50 will be slurped down in no time. And I have to say that, even though we store them in the back of a dark cabinet, the box graphics are a nice touch. It probably cost them a fraction of a fraction of a cent to make it a little more attractive, and I appreciate that!<br /><br />When you first got your Keurig brewer, you drank through the sampler coffees... and if you asked yourself, "Is that as dark as it gets??" then I think you'll go for Jet Fuel or one of the other Coffee People EBs.<br /><br />P.S. You might look into <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0IZBM">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a> as well. It was the first big hit for us, and still one of our faves.

review/summary: The absolute best so far!
review/text: I really like Coffee People Donut Shop coffee, but since it is a tad on the weak side for my tastes, I decided to try the Coffee People XBold variety pack.<br />For reference, I have a Keurig B66 which has 3 cup sizes (5.25, 7.25, 9.25oz), and I always use one K-cup for one 9.25oz cup, and I drink it black. I don't make smaller cups to make it stronger, nor do I run extra water to make it weaker. I judge each k-cup in 9.25oz. It should also be noted that I use spring water exclusively in my machine; done for both taste and machine longevity. (The tap water where I live is brutal. Life span of a water heater is 5-8 years.)<br /><br />I tend to like full-bodied/full-flavored coffee (that doesn't always mean "strong"). Therefore, I tend to like the dark roasts better, which is why I find Donut Shop just a bit lacking (but I like it enough that I still drink it).<br /><br />After trying the variety pack (and having since bought this item by itself as verified above), I can honestly say that by far my new favorite K-Cup is Jet Fuel (and I've tried at least 15-20 different varieties, not including flavored or decaf coffee). It has full flavor that is really good, but has no "strong" characteristics IMO (i.e. bitter, burnt, dense, etc.). When I took the first sip of Jet Fuel, I immediately thought, "Wow, this is good coffee!"<br /><br />Highly recommended if you like a full-bodied coffee that doesn't have any bitterness or burnt characteristics, and is not too dense.

As I work my way through the box, I am throwing out about every third cup.  I "believe" the problem is a thinner than usual foil top, a larger hole is created, during the punch,  and the water is not regulated at the same percentage.  I called to talk to "the coffee people", 2x - never got a human, left my phone number both times, and have never gotten a call back in since the orginal call 10 days ago.

review/summary: A Cross Between Starbucks and the Truck Stop...
review/text: If there is a weakness with the Keurig coffee system, it's that most of the K-Cups--even the Extra Bold varieties--tend to brew a weaker cup of coffee, lacking the full flavor of a regularly brewed cup of Joe. I've therefore learned to order sampler packs if available, so I don't get stuck with a bunch of K-Cups I don't like. So I got the Coffee People's Extra Bold sampler pack which included, Black Tiger, Wake Up Call, Organic, and Jet Fuel. And I found them all purdy good.<br /><br />But with the Jet Fuel, I found myself thinking, "Wow, I've finally found a satisfyingly full-flavored bold coffee!" I even had to put two creamers in my cup instead of my customary one, and I found myself savoring every sip. If you're looking for a full-flavored bold cuppa Joe, this one is for you!

review/summary: Coffee Snobs READ THIS!
review/text: I will keep this one short and sweet. In the past 15 years going from my late teens to 30's I have become somewhat of a snob over what Joe I will allow to pass over my lips. The Keurig seemed like a fine idea but I was afraid, as with many of my snobs, that the coffee could not be strong enough to penetrate the morning fog around my brain on a Monday morning. I'm sorry to say that many K-cups fell flat on their faces and my confidence in Keurig was nearly lost. Well fret no more my friends because Jet Fuel is delicious and boy is it STRONG! There is no need for these silly shenanigans where people are starting the brew and then lifting the handle for longer steeping. Although I think if you did that with the Jet Fuel your eyes may literally shoot out of your head. Just pop in the cup and consume with smile. I bought this Keurig for my office and am already planning on one for home and my travel trailer. If you are as picky as I am about your morning ritual and like a nice strong cup of coffee please try the Jet Fuel. I guarantee you will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Terrific coffee at a (relatively) great price
review/text: I confess that I never would have actually purchased a Keurig coffee maker, but I received one as a gift and I have found it to be a useful and enjoyable toy. Being able to brew one high-quality cup of coffee is indeed one of life's little luxuries.<br /><br />Like other single-serving, prepackaged food technologies, however, Keurig k-cup coffee tends toward the expensive when compared to whole bean or tinned ground coffee. If for this reason alone the Amazon "subscribe and save" approach to buying K-cups would be a fabulous institution. By having the coffee delivered at regular intervals (with free shipping!) the cost is reduced considerably.<br /><br />But which coffees to buy? I selected Jet Fuel partly, I confess, because the name is so darned cute. The (relatively) non-wasteful packaging also was an attraction, though let's face it, there is plenty of plastic residue associated with this brewing technology. The Coffee People at least minimize the waste, however, and for this I salute them.<br /><br />What about the coffee itself? Jet Fuel is a dark, rich, full-bodied coffee that to me is reminiscent of the "industrial strength" coffee I can get at Peet's, my favorite west coast coffee purveyor/establishment. In other words, it's amazingly delicious.  The Keurig system allows you to select the strength you want.<br /><br />Overall, Jet Fuel is a winner for fans of robust coffee. Bon appetit!

review/summary: Great coffee at a great price
review/text: I've been buying this coffee for a while and have found it to be my favorite of all the K-Cup coffees I have tried.  It is nice and strong but not bitter or too acid.  The price in the new 50 pack is also better than the smaller package sizes.

review/text: Yes, Jet Fuel is plenty strong, dense, bitter.  However, for me it lacked aroma and richness.  I love dark and bold but I prefer Tully's Italian Roast or Newman's Own Organic Special Blend Extra Bold.  I'll pick up some Emeril's Big Easy Bold when I find a sale.

review/summary: Best Keurig K Cup!
review/text: I have searched long and wide for a really good K-Cup brand.  Drank the Starbucks variety for a bit, but didn't really like the taste or the aftertaste. Then my sister-in-law turned me on to Jet Fuel and I was hooked.  The coffee always fresh, the taste both strong and smooth.  Hands down the best K-Cup out there.  I buy the 50 pack! :)

review/summary: A Top Favorite - Strong Coffee
review/text: I love the variety of choices you get with the Keurig and this is another fine example.  My family tends towards the darker roasts and have settled on a few favorites.  We've been trying to make our way though most of the varieties and Jet Fuel has landed solidly in our top 5.<br /><br />This is a strong, flavorful cup of coffee.  We only use it on the largest cup size setting as it is too strong for smaller cups.  However, being strong should not be equated with tasting like burnt dirt.  There are some great flavors in this cup and a nice long smooth finish.  I love it when a sip of coffee lingers on the tongue for a few moments and makes you want to take another sip.  Jet Fuel meets the bill.<br /><br />Pros:<br />o strong dark brew<br />o nice flavors<br />o long smooth finish<br /><br />Cons:<br />o a bit too strong for smaller cup sizes<br /><br />Overall - highly recommended - a family favorite.

review/text: Jet Fuel is a bold and slightly acidic offering from Coffee People. I prefer its higher [than other roasts such as the "donut shop" blend] level of acidity in the morning to leave a sparkle on the tongue and kick in my step. The taste is robust even when brewed at the 12 oz size, and it has a clean and satisfying finish. Highly recommended.

review/summary: I really LOVE Jet Fuel -- but can we talk price?
review/text: When I first ordered Jet Fuel a few people told me it was way too harsh a coffee, and to only get it if I wanted to be wired for the rest of the morning.  To tell you the truth, I didn't find that thought unappealing, so I ordered it.<br /><br />My verdict?  It's a delicious coffee, and though stronger than a lot of coffees, I found it very drinkable and am entirely happy with it.  It's strong, but not at all offensive.  I think it has a pleasant taste, no strong aftertaste, and though I will admit it probably has a bit more kick than, say, my wife's Donut Shop coffee, I'm not buzzed on it.<br /><br />Incidentally, I think the only way to get K-cup coffee is to order it on subscription in order to get the 15 % markdown.  Be aware that even subscription prices are available to rise (and fall, I suppose) with the market.  I had thought the price was locked in, but I was wrong.<br /><br />I love K-cups, and I also love Amazon, but unless the prices drop soon, I'm going to have to buy them at Bed, Bath and Beyond...they're not too expensive over there, and they're always having 20 % off or $5 off coupons, as well as sales, and that is about the only way to get K-cups cheap.  I'd rather use Amazon, but paying 60 cents and more for each cup is ri-freaking-diculous.

review/text: The coffee is great. It is my favorite K-Cup so far. However, there were coffee grounds all over most of my K-Cups. Oddly, they were all intact, so I'm not really sure where the grounds came from. I tried cleaning them off. Still, when I brew them I get more coffee grounds in my cup than any other brand I've tried to date. It is still a great flavor, but I wish the manufacturer or Amazon would be more careful with the product.

review/text: I like strong, dark coffee, so I am usually disappointed by k-cups, which tend to be a little on the weak side.  I usually pack my own coffee cups (using a Keurig adapter)so I can get a strong brew, but my Keurig sometimes malfunctions when I use the adapter.  I decided to try Jet Fuel instead, and I was not disappointed -- smells rich, tastes great.  If you want that strong coffee smell and taste, you won't go wrong here.

review/text: I was searching for the perfect K-Cup to make lattes at home. I wanted one that tasted the most like coffee shop espresso. Jet Fuel is the hands-down winner! It's rich, bold and slightly bitter, which is perfect for lattes. I brew it on the smallest setting so that it is more concentrated. I heat milk with flavored creamer and pour it into the Jet Fuel. Then I whip it with my little hand-held frother. It tastes as good as, if not better than, a coffee shop latte at less than half the price! So wonderful! I would not drink Jet Fuel straight, but it is the perfect choice for lattes.

review/summary: Best K-Cup for Strong Coffee Drinkers Yet
review/text: I've had my Keurig for a year, and my only complaint has been the quality of the coffee made:  Not bad, but not nearly strong enough for people who think their coffee should run like molten lava rather than a fast trickling stream (OK, not really sludge, but you get what I mean).  The closest I came to finding a good cup was Dunkin Donuts' Dunkin Dark, but they are pretty expensive from the store.<br /><br />After reading the reviews here, I decided to give Jet Fuel a try.  WHOA!  This is proper coffee that will put hair on your chest, but also tastes DELICIOUS.  Buying in packs of 50 for a family with 3 coffee drinkers (and frequent visitors) also means fewer trips to the store for coffee.<br /><br />Very happy I chose to buy this brand, and now enjoy my morning hassle-free cup of coffee!

May put away our Keurig brewer and haul out the ol' drip maker from the back of the cabinet.  The taste of the coffee rates five stars.  If factoring in the price, it would be fewer stars.

review/summary: Gets me going in the morning!
review/text: I was drinking Timothy's San Lorenzo Dark, but apparently it's no longer sold in the US market, so I was looking for a replacement. Jet Fuel is a little stronger, but very good! Many of the "bold" and "strong" K-Cups have a bitter or burnt taste that I don't like, but this one is perfect. It's strong and gets me going in the morning but still tastes good.<br /><br />I took a bunch in to share with my co-workers and they all liked it as well. Definitely a winner in my book!

review/text: We normally drink treehugger by coffee people in the office.  I purchased this one to try with the order and the office really enjoyed it. The coffee is really similar to the taste of tree hugger; the office has added this one as a favorite.  Not bitter and very smooth finish.  Excellent coffee for an excellent price as these are 50 cup packs which is a great price and perfect packaging.  Thanks to amazon for continuing to expand their offerings.  Yum Yum.

Ironicly, my wife likes the second cup through the little K-cup of grounds after I get the powerful drink of the first cup.

review/summary: Excellent!  Holy Grail of Keurig coffee
review/text: Recieved today, opened, made a cup and was really impressed.  My Keurig coffee maker finally makes a cup of coffee that will wake me up in the morning.  This brand reminds me of the coffee from Urth Caffe here in Los Angeles which charges almost $3.00 a cup which I was happy to pay.  After a couple of these  I am putting in a reorder right away.  I want to make sure we never run out and have to resort to some off the shelf brands from the grocery store here.

Highly recommend and have ordered this exclusively the past three times I have ordered coffee.

review/summary: My fave extra bold coffee
review/text: I don't like bitter coffee, which I associate with the term "extra bold". Jet Fuel is anything but bitter! Now, I use a B-60 and I make a couple brews off the same kcup on the large setting because I drink a lot of coffee and I'm cheap. I'll brew both into the same (rather large) cup to even out the tastes. It still tastes very good, but not as bold. A little creamer for me and I'm good to go! I now drink this more than the Kona blend from Coffee People. I also appreciate how cheap it is!

review/text: This coffee is OK, I have yet to buy a k-cup that has the same body that a regular brewed cup of coffee has. While this is strong in taste (almost too much), it lacks something that a regular drip brew has, almost kind of watery. Still a better k-cup than some that I've had. I do like the bulk amazon packaging though.

review/text: Got this to try another type.  I have been drinking the rain forest extra bold and that is pretty good.  I can make a decent cup of coffee that fills a mug.  Even the largest size on the Kurig is OK.  Anyway, the Jet fuel is quite similar and I can't tell much of a difference.  They are both strong enough for my taste.  One problem I did have, is the cardboard box was so large it would not fit in the kitchen cabinet.  It is one of the "frustration-free" Amazon boxes.

review/summary: fixed the grinds problem; great coffee!
review/text: Jet Fuel is nice and strong coffee with excellent flavor!  Once in a while the kcup releases coffee grinds into the liquid. I contacted Green Mountain Roasters, who make Jet Fuel, and they suggested this fix:  when inserting your kcup into your coffee machine, push the kcup DOWN onto the little puncture needle until it is sitting firmly in place.  Then continue as you normally would for your Jet Fuel cup.  The grinds-into-the-coffee should not happen again.  Reason: pushing DOWN releases some of the pressure in the kcup which prevents the problem.  This has worked for me and I haven't encountered the problem since.  If you have a problem with quality, go to the Green Mountain Roasters website and send customer service an email. They were very responsive when I emailed them!  They'll want the lot number on your Jet Fuel, so be prepared!

review/text: I love the flavor of this coffee, but I agree w/ the post that it may be poorly manufactured.  I frequently have to clean my Keurig from blown out K-cups.  I suspect that problem is more of a coffee maker issue than the K-cup though.  My biggest complaint however is a recent apparent manufacture error.  I received K-cups which show they are Coffee People Jet Fuel but they have a distinct, nasty sweetened mocha flavor.  They're definitely not Jet Fuel flavor.  I cannot find a place to post a complaint to either Coffee People or Amazon, so I guess I'm stuck w/ 50 nasty flavored K-cups.
