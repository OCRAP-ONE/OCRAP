review/summary: Good Alternative-Don't Care for the Organic Mumbo Jumbo
review/text: Annie's Natural Shells are a good alternative to the pasty white flour Kraft Mac & Cheese. Flavor is good for boxed Mac & Cheese when you just want something quick and easy, although the white cheddar is not my favorite flavor of Annie's. Kids will not know the difference.<br /><br />What I really don't care for is all of their organic and the "I'm saving the Earth so I'm a better person for buying this product" mumbo jumbo. There are those of us that just want healthy alternatives without all of the being green political correctness.<br /><br />The fact is that the dairy products that Annie's uses come from cows that eventually end up in a saluter house. "How nice is that Mr. Rabbit?"

review/summary: Beyond Heavenly
review/text: The Fantasicake triple chocolate bundt cake is divine, beyond heavenly! I was not sure what the texture would be like because these scrumptious cakes are shipped to your home. When my cake arrived we put it in the freezer for a few days because we had birthday cake that night for my son's birthday. I wish now we had served this cake instead! I took it out of the freezer and thawed it. Fantasicakes triple chocolate bundt cake is rich but not over done and moist. Included is a pack of chocolate icing to drizzle on it and the portion was just perfect. I recommend this cake for any special occasion or just  because you want a great cake. I am planning on ordering one of the coffee cakes and possibly a torte too from Fantasicakes!

review/text: I am in LOVE with FantasiCakes!  FantasiCakes make handcrafted pastries and baked goods. My family and I tried the Triple Chocolate Bundt cake tonight and it is so good that I lost all sense of portion control.  I try to be good about eating small portions when I have desserts, but this was soooo good that I had two pieces.  The extra calories were worth it though because I enjoyed it so much.<br /><br />The cake arrived in a box at my doorstep.  It was absolutely perfect when I opened it. (I love perfection!)  It came with a container of frosting that we heated up and drizzled over the top of it. I had a little extra frosting that I used to thickly coat one piece upon my husband's request for extra frosting since that was his favorite part. I love how the bundt cake has the design that I could cut smaller or larger pieces.  The cake was so rich that a little went a long way.  This cake is just so good that I don't trust myself, so we froze the rest of the cake. Plus, I love having a good dessert in the freezer for special occasions.

review/summary: Had a weird smokey smell/taste
review/text: I have tried three different brands of coconut oil: Barlean's, Nutiva, and Tropical Traditions. The VIRGIN coconut oil has a nice, light coconut flavor.  The EXPELLER pressed coconut oil has no flavor. So, if you a buying virgin coconut oil here's my tip: Barlean's had the best flavor and smell...I wanted to eat it right out of the jar it smelled so good, tasted phenomenal!! Barlean's was the most expensive of the three but for the flavor worth it. Nutiva was a close second in taste & smell and is more economical. Tropical Traditional (which I have always loved their products in the past) did not measure up in flavor. In fact it had a strange, burnt taste and smell...something was off about it. If you want no coconut flavor at all, get the expeller pressed coconut oil. It is less expensive than virgin coconut oil...all three companies use proper, healthy, non-chemical practices to extract the oil, so I would go with the best buy for the expeller cold pressed oil but pay a little more for the virgin coconut oil.

review/summary: Tropical Traditions Gold Label Organic Virgin Coconut Oil - 1 quart
review/text: Whatever this is, it is NOT 100% coconut oil. I contacted Tropical Traditions, and they said region, and method of preparation can cause variations in taste. However I have been using coconut oil for years and this oil does not behave like any other coconut oil on the planet. It "solidifies" CLEAR!!??  instead of white and has almost no smell, whereas ALL 100% coconut oil is completely white when "solid", and definitely smells like coconut. I was very tempted to send this out to a lab to see exactly what the product in the glass jar was, because I am POSITIVE that this is NOT 100% pure coconut oil. My advice see Coconut Oil expert Bruce Fife's article "How Do You Identify a Good Quality Coconut Oil?" before purchasing.  [...]

review/text: I read the marketing hype on the Tropical Traditions website and ordered this product through Amazon.  I'm quite disappointed - the taste is not great.  I have a jar of organic expeller-pressed unrefined coconut oil (which is supposed to be inferior to this Tropical Traditions Gold label) but tastes much better.  While I don't regret this purchase, because I needed a high-heat cooking oil (and the expeller-pressed oil that I have is only suitable for medium-heat cooking), my hopes are somewhat dashed.  I was hoping that I could use this Gold Label as a substitute for butter on toast, etc., but the taste is so bland it could not possibly substitute for butter on toast.  From the marketing hype, I would have thought the stuff tasted like liquid gold.  Nothing doing!

Even after many years of research I've done on coconut oil, TT's stuff is still coming out at the top.<br /><br />I also love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VWLQE6">Tropical Traditions Organic Coconut Cream Concentrate - 1-Quart (32 oz)</a> - which is simply ground up organic coconut meat. It's almost like fudge if you warm the jar, pour it out into a shallow pan, smush it around to even it into a block, then refrigerate for a short time so it firms up again. Just cut off small squares and it's such a yummy, filling low sugar treat. You can add a few toasted nuts or bits of chocolate or whatever you like before chilling, but I like to eat it straight. :)

review/summary: definitely a unique flavor.
review/text: I bought a bunch of this stuff because it's reputed to be "the best" of the coconut oils. That seemed completely plausible since the company seems to be run by a small group of awesome humans rather than a huge corporation. While the product made it to my doorstep intact and with no leaks, I'm not thrilled with the taste or smell of the oil.<br /><br />I keep trying to like it. I keep trying it in various states: cooked, chilled, at room temperature, as a "magic shell" on homemade frozen yogurt pops...but there's just not really a coconut flavor. It has the texture of coconut oil but is overwhelmed by a singed flavor - almost like burnt plant material or burnt skin. Not really cool if you're trying to eat this stuff on its own!<br /><br />This weird non-coconut flavor is nice for cooking dishes that are not particularly flattered by a coconut flavor, like eggs or certain veggies. I'd be really disappointed if I tried to use this for a curry-type dish. The oil seems to work wonderfully as a skin moisturizer, but even then you don't quite get that lovely coconut smell.

review/text: I have been using Natures Way evco, as my local Sprouts always has them on sale. $18 for quart and sometimes $5.99 for a pint,(I load up on pints when that price). Although I wish i could get this Tropical Traditions as easy and as cheap as Natures Way because I believe it is really minimally processed and organic. Tropical Traditions gold coconut oil has a good smell and still has small pieces of coconut at bottom of jar. Its also not as clear as Natures Way when in liquid form, both turn solid white when temperature is low leading me to believe it is very minimally processed. Been using coconut oil for years, in my morning cup of coffee, over-easy free range eggs, as lotion, and supplement in my child's eczema treatments. Im 30 yrs weigh 185 5'10 and my latest physical showed my triglyceride levels to be normal, blood sugar perfect and blood pressure normal. That last bit of info was for the people who still believe coconut oil is bad for you. Its not. Great product.

review/summary: Nuts for Coconut
review/text: I agree. High quality virgin coconut oil should be snow white in color when it is solid (cooler temps) and water clear when liquid (warmer temps), and Tropical Traditions actually got it down pat, that means, No yellowing or graying, NADA! So far, base on my experience using Tropical Traditions VCO, I trust that this company has the best virgin coconut oil, and NO, it does not have a strong roasted or smoky taste or smell but a very mild coconut aroma and flavor and never overwhelming. Some virgin coconut oils have a very strong flavor or smell and these are almost always of 'poor quality'. I have seen REAL results using this miracle oil--my skin feels soft and silky, freshens breath, weight on check, sluggishness--GONE, THE BEST oil treatment for my waist-length chemically processed hair. Skeptical about using it as an added supplement, hair & skin care and for weight loss? Visit Dr. Oz's website and watch his LIVE video how coconut oil is actually good for weight loss, hair, skin (eczema, psoriasis). This is because one of coconut oil's active ingredients, lauric acid, is not only an antiviral, is an anti fungal as well.

review/summary: Used it for years
review/text: After doing research for some time on  coconut oils, I settled on Tropical Traditions. I've been using it for years and usually put some in my oatmeal. I've also used it on my skin after extended sun exposure. I've been very happy with the product. In my research I found that Coconut Oil has very strong anti-viral properties. A friend of mine's daughter came down with a bad case of Mono. She was told she would be out of Softball for several months. I gave him a jar and instructed him to start her out with one spoonful in the a.m. and then work up to 3 a day. Within several days she was showing signs of being better and within two weeks was back in the Texas Summer heat playing softball and never had any issues. Was it the Coconut Oil? I think yes but regardless, sometimes, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain by trying what Native Islanders have known for many centuries.  I can't speak to the flavor of other VGOs but I've have good results with this one so I'm sticking with it.

I decided to go with the Double Coconut Chocolate Chip Cookies. With little ones you can't go wrong with this recipe. So, I followed the recipe and to my surprise they were actually really really good. Hubby and the kids also loved them within a few days they were all gone. It was super easy to use in the recipe. It didn't take me long to start trying it in other food as we were cooking.

At first you may get gas but once the candida subsides gas will go away. I use it topically on my whole body and do oil hair treatments as well once a week.

review/text: I've recently discovered Health Warrior Chia Bars.  My first purchase was the chocolate peanut butter flavor.  Since I was new to these bars, I didn't have much grounds of comparison.  My overall thoughts on those were just OK.  I would eat the bars mainly because it was a healthy snack, not because I actually enjoyed it.  So when I ran out, I tried to by another box and found that they were sold out of the chocolate peanut butter flavor. Turns out it was a blessing!  I found these coconut flavors instead. Although, I was a bit hesitant at first to purchase these, after reading another review about how great it tastes, I took a chance.  Boy am I glad I did!  These are DELICIOUS!!  I will NEVER go back to the peanut butter again.  I highly recommend these to those who like the taste of coconut because it tastes very coconutty. So, if you're not a big fan of coconut to start with, these are probably not for you.

Within a week my urine started to burn badly. I didn't know that Chia seeds are high in oxalates. Darn it! If you have problems with oxalates, kidney stones, etc. I don't recommend anything with Chia seeds. If you don't have those issues, then give them a try.

review/summary: Healthy, Tasty Low-Cal Snack
review/text: This coconut chia bar makes a wonderful portable snack. Unlike like some health-type bars, its not so sticky that you can't handle it without making a sticky mess on everything; and unlike others, it's doesn't crumble into a thousand little pieces that fly all over; it's not too hard like the jaw-breaker that some are.  Nope, it's none of those things.  It's "just right." It holds itself together perfectly, isn't messy or crumbly when you bite into it, and its easy to bite off and chew without cracking a tooth. Nor would it melt in the car if left inside a warm car for awhile.  (Not sure about the choco-peanut butter one, tho, since I haven't tried it yet).<br /><br />It's very small, however, but because its chia, it still has that long satiety and satisfaction level--for hours, actually, much like drinking the gel does.<br /><br />This seems to be made from white chia seeds, so it doesn't leave any visible dark residue in the teeth in case you can't brush after eating.<br /><br />I would give it five stars, but because the price seems high for 15 tiny bars, it's not that great a value in my opinion.

review/summary: Dilutes fast in liquids, tastes good though.
review/text: i bought this trying to duplicate a famous coffee shop's caramel macchiato, when they were sold out of their own caramel sauce.  it tasted better than having no caramel in there, since you could still get the caramel flavoring, but it did not live up to my expectations.  it would probably do much better if used as a dessert topping instead of in a drink.  it diluted fast instead of coating the sides of my glass and staying thick on top of the whipped cream, as i was hoping it would.  overall, the taste was fine.  the consistensy was lacking though.

review/summary: Product of USA, China, or Egypt
review/text: As stated on their label, this garlic can widely vary in source. You just don't know the source. Since most garlic in the USA is now imported from China it is likely that this garlic is often from China.<br /><br />Skip eating questionable food from China and demand USA grown food. You can get garlic grown in the USA at your farmer's market. You can also get it from farmers online and distributors such as: spicesinc.com. Or you can search under "garlic not grown in China" like I did. It does exist.<br /><br />Please join me in encouraging Amazon to get an organic source of garlic that is from the USA; they currently have none. Let's help our own economy and not buy food from communist China.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/14/12: spicesinc.com carries USA garlic whenever possible, but they can't always find it. When I wrote the review, they had it in stock. I spoke with Greg, the CEO, today and he is searching for more USA sources. Just call to verify when you place your order.<br /><br />Another way to search the internet is to list a state such as: "California organic garlic powder".

review/summary: Glucose plus Fructose equals sucrose
review/text: I don't understand why this sugar is considered any healthier or lower glycemic value than regular cane sugar. It tastes a lot like  rapadura, dried cane sugar. Taste is more like brown sugar. But when you have a glucose molecule and a fructose molecule together you have sucrose. Sugar is sugar.  Certainly less processing is better at retaining natural nutrients but sugar is not healthy and should be used in very small amounts. I don't believe this product is any different.

review/summary: Taste was okay, but...
review/text: my crackers arrived all broken into small pieces.  The shipper had put plenty of bubble wrap on the top of the crackers, but not on the bottom.  I called the shipper and they immediately sent out another package, well-protected this time.  Unfortunately, once I opened them I discovered that they too were all broken.  So apparently the breakage is happening in their warehouse, and not during shipping.<br /><br />I won't purchase these again, even though the broken crackers didn't go to waste.  I took out my rolling pin and rolled them into fine crumbs, and used them in meatloaf and meatballs.  They worked well for that use too.<br /><br />I have since found gluten-free crackers that are much better, in my local grocery store.  I highly recommend Diamond Nut-Thins in all different flavors.  The crackers are made from nut flour... hazelnut, almond, etc.  My favorites are the cheddar cheese almond crackers... completely addictive.

review/text: I bought a package of these at my local grocery store and found them to be really similar to Ritz or Clubhouse crackers but without that buttery feel and flavor.  They have a mild taste that goes well with mild to medium flavored cheeses and spreads.  They're delicate in texture, though.  My package had some breakage, probably just from handling because I noticed they broke pretty easily just in eating them.  Probably not a good cracker for heavy spreads but for most stuff they would be fine.  Too bad they're so expensive.

Cause I know this corn water CAN'T taste better than breast milk! Smells totally gross!<br />But without any lactose it is easier on my baby's belly than breast milk.<br /><br />The main ingredient is corn syrup solids and it DOES contain some soy, both highly dissapointed me when I received the product, but when my baby got full easier, ate slower and fell asleep right away I had a change of heart.<br />She is still colicky, but not as bad and we haven't cut the breast milk out yet, so we will see how much better she gets after that. She is getting happier and more content already with only eating 4 ounces of breast milk, and all other feeding Neocate, today. I feel TERRIBLE giving up breastfeeding, but if synthetic food makes her feel better than that is what we'll do for her. i am worried about her gut flora being properly propagated, but I will have to do some research to see if I can do anything to help that. Will update later...<br /><br />-Jaek's Wife :)

review/summary: The only formula baby would drink
review/text: My daughter was allergic to milk and soy (so we thought). We experimented with other formulas, but this is the only one she would take. It smells gross, but all formulas do more or less. She was very content with Neocate. Its expensive as heck though!

review/summary: I like the Antioxidant blend!
review/text: Try it you will like it. I have tried this blend of muesli and it comes out great when 1/2 cup of cereal is soaked in 1/2 cup milk overnight and a little yogurt is added in the morning. Far from "mushy"! I have been buying this from my local co-op (Lexington in Buffalo, NY.) Now that I see that Amazon carries it I may save myself the trip when the Antioxidant mix comes back in stock or when I need a filler to get to $25.  Bob's Red Mill is flavorless in comparison.

review/summary: Excellent for low sodium diet
review/text: First, if you purchase directly from edietshop you will get their products cheaper (at least, for the shipping cost).<br /><br />The Bernard Sugar Free Biscuit Mix is pretty good. Not great, but good enough.<br /><br />If you use the whole can the directions tell you to simply mix in three-fourths of a cup of water, then form into biscuits, and bake. Result: about a dozen rock-hard biscuits (they claim you will get 21 biscuits, which I guess is true if you like then half-dollar size). They simply do not rise on their own.<br /><br />Here is what I do: I use a full cup of water (sometimes a little more). I also mix in some YEAST (at least half a tablespoon; no more than a tablespoon). Mix well and let it sit for an hour to rise; then mix again and let it rise again.<br /><br />Now, form into biscuits on your cookie sheet. LET THEM RISE AGAIN FOR ABOUT AN HOUR.<br /><br />I normally get 16 'average' sized biscuits using this method, large enough for me to make sausage-biscuit sandwiches.<br /><br />The taste will still not equal the biscuits you buy in a store. However, they are sugar-free and very low sodium (also pretty low fat). Using the yeast-method they will not be as hard.<br /><br />Pretty expensive biscuits, when all is said and done. However, if you need biscuits that are sugar-free as well as very low in salt content, then Bernard's will fit the bill.

review/summary: Decent taste - 5 servings per box
review/text: I get tired of labels selectively enhancing numbers to mislead, so these get a star off for that.<br />Big bolded letters it says: "10 bars" below, in smaller letters you'll see a small pack has 2 bars. At least they have the decency to call a serving (at the back on small letters: 2 bars).<br />The bars are very small, so it's no surprise that this is the case.<br /><br />On a positive note, the oats are organic, as are a lot of the ingredients. The bars crumble a bit much, so you might lose a piece or two to the floor.<br /><br />Overall, given the quality of the ingredients, and the decent taste, these are a good choice. However, a lot of the time the cost per bar* (10 bars in a box, 2 per pack) is close to a dollar, an honestly, anything over 50 cents is way too much for the size of these, and you would be better off with any of the other products out there that fill you up even more (1 dollar protein bars come to mind - they weigh a lot more than 2 of these).

review/summary: Not a fan of granola bars, but the taste of these wowed me
review/text: I don't typically buy or snack on granola bars. They are often more chewy than like a crisp cookie and taste of honey and artificial ingredients. In fact, I would never have tried these were there not a sample bowl of them at a local grocery store.<br /><br />I was more than shocked...it almost tasted like a homemade oatmeal cookie.  In fact it was so good I returned for seconds and bought 2 boxes of these and 3 other flavors as well. Although the chocolate chip is a close second, these are hands down the best in my opinion.<br /><br />Surprisingly the calorie count on the box is for TWO bars. While many manufacturers try to sneak in calories by doing things like saying there are 2 servings in soda can or 2 servings in a single frozen dinner so the calorie count looks smaller, they were more than generous. TWO bars of most of their flavors have only 160 calories and for a mega sweet fix that satisfies me plenty with just one bar, that wowed me.<br /><br />This is an organic bar and they are actually vegan. Not that they advertise this anywhere, I just read labels and was surprised to see no dairy or eggs listed. One servings gives you 40% of your daily recommended serving of whole grains yet it tastes like a cookie or dessert...and that also means a nice doce of fiber.<br /><br />While I wouldn't fool myself into thinking that I'm eating HEALTHY just because of the whole grains and organic ingredients...it is, afterall, sweet and has 11g of sugar (but that's for two bars, remember, and one is plenty filling for me so that's not so bad for a sweet snack.) I do feel I am eating healthier than most alternatives when I'm craving a sweet snack that I can tote in a purse or keep in my desk drawer. Most bow far deeper into the less healthy alternatives of preservatives to keep them shelf-stable, or far more sugar.<br /><br />Not to be confused with a protein bar or one packed with vitamins, of which it's not, it's still a healthy alternative to the afternoon candy bar or morning donut in the break room and in my opinion it tastes way better than either.

review/text: I'm not stupid. I have nearly a degree from a major university. I read this description over and over, and still it didn't make any sense. Ten bars! Pack of two! Two boxes! Forty-eight! Hike!<br /><br />Like me, you'll probably be surprised by the dearth of product. You get two boxes. Each contains five packets. Each packet has 2 bars, sure -- but the weight of each packet is 1.5 oz, which is less than two-thirds the weight of ONE regular Clif bar. These bars are maybe 1 1/2" wide, 4" long, and 1/4" thick. You'll be tempted to use them to file your nails. Why would Clif suddenly decide that humans can't take a granola bar that weighs more than .75 oz -- and package two of them together? Gosh, let's all think.<br /><br />Anyway, now you know. On the plus side, if you don't like these -- I'd give them a 5 out of 10 on taste -- just hold the box in your open palm, and a hefty breeze will take them away.

review/summary: Great taste, but not very filling
review/text: I am a huge fan of Clif products, and consume them almost daily. My breakfast every single work day consists of a standard Clif Bar, and I also occasionally eat a Clif Builder's Bar after a strenuous workout. Happy with all previous Clif products, I purchased a couple boxes of these Clif Crunch Bars, in the Chocolate Chip flavor. Like other Clif products, the whole ingredients list consists of real, natural items; nothing on the list that you can't pronounce or identify.<br /><br />If this review were based on taste and taste alone, there is no doubt in my mind that these bars would deserve a full 5 stars. Given that the bars are relatively healthy, with a solid ingredients list, they taste wonderful; I wouldn't have them change a single thing. Unfortunately, the big downside to this product is the fact that they just aren't nearly as filling as other Clif products. Each pack contains two separate bars, and as far as satisfying hunger goes, I need to eat two complete packs of these Crunch Bars to get the same amount of satisfaction as a single normal Clif bar. Granted, these are lower in calories than the normal bar, but they just don't seem to cut it if I want a quick snack that will fill me up.<br /><br />Another product I have used that is about the same nutritional content as the Crunch Bar, but seems to satisfy my hunger better, are the standard Nature Valley Granola bars. I will keep buying Clif products, but these Clif Crunch Bars will likely not make it back onto my shopping list anytime soon.

review/summary: Overpriced! Not what you are expecting.
review/text: My main beef with this product is with the labeling.<br /><br />The box is labeled very deceptively. This goes double when inspecting the packaging from the Web (as you are doing now). "10 bars" is prominently displayed on the box. Lo and behold, once you open the box, only five bars are present. Upon further inspection, you see that printed in mice-type on the box is "5 two count packages". The net weight of the entire box is 7.4 ounces. That's less than one cup of granola. That's when you realize you've been had.<br /><br />You can buy a mega-size box of Nature Valley granola bars from a warehouse club for less money than the "Pack of 2" you'll find here. I mention Nature Valley because in a blind taste test you won't be able to distinguish that brand from these Clif bars.<br /><br />Seriously, if they are selling them for this much on Amazon, I'd be shocked and chagrined to see what they go for at the camping stores which is their retailer of origin.<br /><br />I consider myself embarrassed to have been duped so badly on this one. Clif has seriously damaged their brand credibility. Live and learn.

review/text: I have been trying to eat better. And I have been going on photo walks. I find that I need something with me in case I get hungry. Fruit doesn't travel well. Granola bars do well in my bag. But chewy bars get too sticky. And most crunchy granola bars are so hard I am always worried I would lose a tooth or two. I saw these at Nutrition S'mart yesterday and picked them up. I tried one before I got home. They have a great crunch, not too hard, and a wonderful flavor. Now I want to try the other flavors but my local Nutrition S'mart only had 2.

Probably the finest compliment I can offer is that if I was going to make a crunchy peanut butter granola bar at home, I'm not sure I could make them better than these. Anyway, these are highly recommended if you want a delicious crunchy peanut butter granola bar that just happens to have all the nutrition we've come to expect from CLIF. Yum-O!

review/summary: crappy
review/text: the best part was the white chocolate, but you can buy that anywhere for cheap<br /><br />this crap crumbles into thousands of pieces when you take a bite, so you can't even anywhere with you. Gotta eat it over the kitchen sink as it is so messy<br /><br />avoid this at all costs. Buy the chewy counterpart instead

review/summary: Amazing bar! Too expensive @ amazon!
review/text: Why is the box of 10 $10 @ Amazon when I can buy this for $4 at the grocery store? Is there a pricing problem?

review/text: great snack, with a great price! I would recommend, I enjoy the cliff brand especially this flavor. It is neutral and not overwhelming.

review/text: These bars are awesome. The White Chocolate Macadamia is the only one I've tried, but it's goood. The only complaint is they break part too easily, but I can say, much better than Nature Valley. I hope these stay around for a while.
