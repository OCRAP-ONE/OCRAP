review/summary: This is a great brown sugar substitute
review/text: This creates a flavor just like the real thing. Unfortunately like the real thing, it was partly hardened when I first tried to get some out. But it was pretty easy to massage the package and loosen it up to get out one teaspoon which was all I needed. They tell you what the equivalents are, but I can't remember. It's on the package.

Each was sealed in plastic bag with label and smaller one on back denoting flavors. Would recommend this vendor.

review/summary: THE BEST TASTING!
review/text: Lundberg Mocha Sweet Rice Cakes are the best tasting rice cakes out there. If you get bored with just eating them with a spread, try breaking up a couple of the rice cakes in a bowl, drizzle olive oil over and sprinkle with sea salt and microwave on high for 22 seconds.  You'll never miss popcorn.<br />Deb

review/summary: "Let them eat (rice) cake!
review/text: I am a big fan of the Lundberg rice cakes: I enjoy all the varieties, depending on what I am in the mood for; but the mochi sweet rice it the the best all-purpose one, and the one I buy most often.  (BTW, don't even THINK about grocery store "rice cakes"--pleh!).  Even though I am the one who eats the most "natural" type food,everybody in my family loves these Lundberg rice cakes.  They eat them as is for snacks, or with toppings.  They go great with anything I can think of:  peanut butter, sesame tahini, Nutella, cream cheese, tuna or chicken salad, cold cuts, and more!<br /><br />I like having a case of these rice cakes because then I always have some on hand, and don't have to drive across town to the health food store whenever I run out. They are well packaged and remain fresh until you are ready to use them. I generally keep one package in my car incase I get hungry, because I hate fast foods. (they don't have a lot of calories, so I also have peanuts, V-8, and other stuff).  My sons sometimes take them along too, because they would rather eat the rice cakes than potato or corn chips.<br /><br />In my opinion, Lundberg rice cakes are a better choice than bread. They are low cal, fat free, whole grain...plus you get plain good food and not the yeast and the many chemicals that are in the breads that are offered in grocery stores these days.<br /><br />Let us eat (Lundberg Organic Mochi Sweet Rice) CAKE!!!

review/summary: Tasty Gluten-Free Rice Cakes
review/text: The Mochi style is my favorite of the Lundberg rice cakes I've tried so far. The "leading brand" that's sold in all the grocery stores tastes like styrofoam, and isn't gluten-free(processed on shared equipment in a facility that handles wheat/gluten products)...<br />I'm ever so glad that Lundberg's rice cakes are gluten-free!!! I only wish that more supermarkets carried them. The closest one to where I live is over an hour's drive.<br />When Lundberg says "Purity you can taste."...they mean it.<br />I've read a lot of reviews complaining about their crumbly nature, which is true. You do get quite a pile of rice cake bits at the end of each bag, and they can be a bit messy to eat, if they fall apart.<br />I don't mind. I look at it as gluten-free puffed rice cereal at the bottom of every bag of rice cakes. Grab your favorite milk substitute/milk and enjoy. *Note: If using "Rice Dream" as your stand-in for milk...It still contains a small amount of gluten from barley. They did not change the recipe...only the label, which should be called false advertising, but there are no standardized rules for labeling products gluten-free in the USA!

I love a good tart granny smith apple but these don't even come close. Stick with Sour Patch Kids and those only if you like sour.

review/text: Checking nutrition info on this product today at the Eugene, OR Costco, these snacks appeared to be remarkably healthy for a fruit snack. I did a double-take, and  a triple-take on the number of servings per box. Number of servings is triple the number of pouches in the box! Serving size = 9 pieces. If the snackers in your world are sufficiently disciplined, or smallish of appetite, to be satisfied with a third of a pouch of fruit snacks, bon appetit!<br />Sidebar: If you could be so polite as to not add to Costco's excessive packaging habit by re-packing your fruit snacks into Baggies-of-Nine, well, that would be appreciated and more power to you.

review/text: I ordered the Maple Walnut fudge.  The pricing was good for 6 pounds  It's been almost 3 months since I ordered it, and it still tastes very fresh - still very moist.  I think there was a great ratio of walnuts to fudge - you won't have a walnut in every bite, but they aren't just sprinkled on top either.  The fudge was very creamy (yet still solid) and came in a large 6 lb block, in a ziploc type baggie.  I would definitely order from here again.

review/summary: You can do better homemade
review/text: I paid 3.49 at the grocery store for this, which made me almost not buy it.  That was on sale.  Just because it's set up like a kit, that seems to give them a reason to charge more for it.  The other quick breads by pillsbury, for instance, never cost that much, but they give you just as much.  You're not really getting all that much in the way of ingredients.  A packet of mix, a packet of glaze, and a pretty small can of carnation evaporated milk.  If you don't put all the glaze on it, the bread doesn't seem to have much in the way of flavor.  It's not that sweet and it's not that lemony by itself.  You can make a better quick bread from scratch.  Quick breads are very easy to make, unlike cakes, for instance.  Plus you can put lemon zest in it and real fresh lemon juice.  You'll get a much better bread that way.

Those of us who grew up on Hormel and Armour have no idea how good canned chili can taste.  The meat is firm and substantial, and the spices let you know that someone used a real recipe for this.  Definitely worth the cost.  Try it and and become a believer!

review/summary: Wolf Brand Chili Awooooooo!!!  As good as canned chili gets!
review/text: OK all you little buckaroos out there, gather round the stove for a little bit of Texas traditional chili on the go.  Is it as good as you have ever had?  Well, if you have had lots of chili and both home made and canned varieties, probably not.  If you have had only canned varieties, then maybe it is.  I have had a lot of chili in the day and of course, nothing in a can is going to beat a pot of honest to gosh down home made goodness in a pot but for a quick and easy version, WBC is about as good as I have ever seen it.  I'm not going down that "beans or no beans" debate road since everything is subjective in that regard, but if you just want a quick bowl of chili (and you can hot rod it if you like with fresh tomato chunks, sauteed onions, etc..) then here's your guy.  Used to be made in Corsicana Texas, south of Dallas.  Not sure these days..  With some crackers and some good cheese slices you got yourself a nice little lunch going on there.  You can always shop around and sometimes find these going for about a buck a can just before fall tailgating weather hits.  In the meantime, enjoy whenever you feel like it..

review/summary: Choclate Bar Fantastic Taste and Quality
review/text: I used to buy these in the grocery stores in Germany.  Got my stateside sample at REI store in St. Louis (who only stocks it seasonally).  For those concerned that alcohol is not good in choclate .. try again.  I'm not a big choclate eater or fan, and seldom drink alcohol, but for quick energy and fantastic flavor try one of these. The europeans know cooking, and they really know choclate .. their pastry and choclate puts others to shame.  The rum is a flavor enhancer that adult tastes will enjoy after a long hike, climb, or outdoor trip; and it takes me back to sitting in a little sidewalk cafe sipping coffee and watching the tourists walk by .. another quality product from Germany with love. I do outdoor photography and like to stick a candy bar in my bag to keep my energy up .. this one keeps my spirits up too!

review/summary: Move over "Jell-O"...
review/text: There's a new gelatin in town!!<br /><br />  I've made a concerted effort to watch what eat the past couple of years.  Because "Jell-O" contains dyes in their products, I decided to search for a healthier alternative.  Being that this was on sale, and had good reviews, I ordered this and the instant vanilla pudding.  Both are fantastic tasting; I'm extremely pleased!  I actually ended up ordering a second pack of the (regular) strawberry before it sold out.  It's great plain, but if you really want a decadent dessert, try adding a touch of whipping/whipped cream over top =>O<br /><br />  I hope to continue ordering from this company in the future-- so please keep selling it Amazon!!  Also, if anyone from "Better Bowls" happens to read this, please try and expand your gelatin line!!

review/summary: Great product
review/text: Like other reviewers, I was initially interested in this product because it did not contain food dyes.  The fiber and vitamin C were an added bonus.  After making it, I think the flavor is great and I would definitely buy again.  I have a 10 month old who likes to try all kinds of foods, and I like that I can share this with him without giving him anything artificial.  Even though this is the only flavor available, I like to add different fruits/toppings to change things up a bit.  It is very easy to prepare--I just heated my water in the microwave and while it was not quite boiling, it still dissolved the packet and it set up quickly.  Try it--you won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Yeah! No food dye!
review/text: I've been really wanting for gelatin lately, but I try not to buy the type at the supermarket because of the dyes and artificial everything in them. I searched Amazon and found Better Bowls Strawberry. It turned out perfectly and had a nice color of red (without red #40). Honestly, I don't care what color it is as long as it tastes great and sets up well, which this does.<br /><br />Would love to have more flavors (like lime or lemon) available so I can recreate some of my grandmother's gelatin salads. Very happy there's a more natural alternative out there, will be ordering some of the puddings next!

review/summary: Say What?
review/text: Like the silly consumer that I am there is plenty of information that always seems to escape my knowledge base. Dye's and complicated chemicals that appear in the most common foods like, in this case, Gelatin. Dye's, artificial ingredients and the now famous or infamous Red #40, it kind of puts one's defenses up for who would want to be ingesting (together with the rest of the family) this supposedly harmful chemicals in something as legendary as jello, gelatin, call it what you will. And the funny or tragic thing is that the famous Jello we all come to know and love, where If I am not mistaken, even the wholesome Bill Cosby was a spokesperson for, seems to carry on its ingredient list some unsavory, not recommended ingredients that some savvy people seemed to have discovered as a threat and nicely shared with the rest of us. How was I to know the danger lurking in an everyday bowl of what I had categorized all these years as friendly and even healthy dessert. The company never addressed this harmful dyes and numbered Red?. So enter Better Bowls...They are obviously offering a healthier product from the old basic one. They advertised the difference and these days every one likes to be on the safe side (I know I am, my reckless demeanor a thing of the past now) so I bought Better Bowls Gelatin Dessert Mix, STRAWBERRY, Natural, Heart Healthy, High fiber, High Vit C, Gluten-free, All natural colors & flavors, (4 oz Pouches) Pack of 8. Found it to be a little pricey, buy hey, when it comes to a superior quality there is really no comparison. Kind of like drinking purified water to the riskier types perhaps? Yes, a few cents or even dollars for the best sound like good return for the hard earned cash. Specially when some of this chemicals may cause irreversible damage. Frankly I never worried about jello containing unhealthy items in its preparation. But why would it be mentioned by others unless it was true. So there it is. I received the order and immediately made a batch. Everyone liked it and color wise it fooled us all we were having strawberry jello. Added some fresh fruits, a dollop of safe whipped cream and dessert was served. So for selling a better jello and tasting almost like the now maligned one I must give it 5 Stars.

review/summary: human quality ingredients, unique manufacturing process-- my goldens enjoy it
review/text: My two goldens approve of this product. Blue Buffalo uses top of the line ingredients, human food grade-- there's a chicken version and a fish version. No yucky meat "by-products", meat and meat meals are the top ingredients, no indigestible corn or wheat, a wide variety of wholesome and varied vegetable ingredients and several probiotics to promote healthy digestion and absorption of nutrients. On top of that, this is a very palatable food.<br /><br />Blue Buffalo also uses a unique process to manufacture "lifebits" which are added to the basic "kibble" food. These smaller, darker pieces are cold formed in order to better maintain nutrients. I don't believe any other company incorporates this kind of element into dog food.<br /><br />I respect what they are doing, and I've changed to Blue Buffalo food for my cat, too.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional information:<br /><br />-One cup contains 462.8 calories<br />-NO animal by-products<br />-NO artificial preservatives, colors, or flavors<br />-NO corn, wheat, or soy AND gluten-free (great to know after last years' pet food scandals and deaths with other brands, in which added glutens were contaminated with melamine)<br />-Crude protein 25% minimum<br />-Crude fat 14% minimum<br />-Omega 3 fatty acids 0.25% min<br />-Omega 6 fatty acides 3.5% min<br />-Glucosamine 400 mg/kg max<br />-Major ngredients, in order:<br />Deboned chicken, chicken meal, whole ground brown rice (very digestible grain source vs. the usual corn), whole ground barley, oatmeal, rye, whole potatoes, tomato pomace (natural source of lycopene), chicken fat (preserved wtih natural mixed tocopherols), natural chicken flavor, whole carrots, whole sweet potatoes, blueberries, cranberries, flaxseed, barley grass, dried parsley, alfalfa meal, kelp meal, taurine, l-carnitine, l-lysine, glucosamine hydrochloride, yucca schidigera extract, green tea extract, turmeric, garllic, sunflower oil (natural source of Omega 6 fatty acids), oil of rosemary, the whole bunch of expected vitamins and minerals, and several probiotics (lactobacillus acidolphilus, bacillus subtilis, bifidobacgterium longum, enterococcus faecium).<br /><br />I hope this helps you evaluate whether or not this food would be a good match for your best pal.

review/summary: The ingredients and concept look great
review/text: I'm on the fence with Blue Buffalo.  Our 2 girls like it okay, it has unique life source bits that make the vitamins very available to the system, high quality ingredients which  means they will have better immune systems to fight off diseases, yada yada.  Of course, I want them to live long and healthy lives.  They are our best friends.  I am always on the lookout for a food that is "better" and I try samples of many and yet come back to the tried and true.<br />Anyway, on with the review.  The girls were on this food for less than a month and I have to say they really enjoyed eating it. My biggest complaint of this food was in the potty dept. with soft, sometimes runny movements that didn't get better with time.  Now, I could have added things like pumpkin or bran to firm things up but I feel at Blue Buffalo prices I should not be adding a thing.  Also, it seemed coat quality went down as well.<br />I do like the Blue Buffalo concept and may sometime in the future try a different formula in their line up or wait and see if they decide to 'fine tune' the Chicken and Rice a little more to be more agreeable.

review/summary: If you want the best for your dog - this is IT!!!
review/text: We've been feeding our dogs BLUE products since they were puppies. We have two Boston Terriers; Boston's have notoriously sensitive digestive systems and are very prone to gas.  A diet without corn, wheat and soy (as well as no by-products) is best for them. (FYI- chicken by-products include head, feet, beaks, lungs, spleen, kidneys, brain, liver, stomach, bones, blood, intestines, and any other part of the carcass not fit for human consumption)  Our dogs LOVE it and I feel good feeding it to them.  I know that they are getting human grade foods; quality chicken, anti-oxidant rich fruits (blueberries,cranberries), healthy veggies (tomato,whole potatoes,sweet potatoes,peas,whole carrots) as well as high quality grains (brown rice,barley,oatmeal,rye,flaxseed).  BLUE also has glucosamine for healthy joints; sunflower & fish oils for a natural source of Omega 3 & 6 fatty acids. Essential amino acids (L-carnitine and L-lysine) for fat metabolism, calcium absorption and the building of muscle. The BLUE-exclusive Life Source Bits have vitamins, minerals and holistic supplements like rosemary, garlic, kelp, dried parsley, alfalfa meal, yucca, turmeric and chicory root. BLUE also adds healthy digestion-promoting cultures - lactobacillus, acidophilus, Bacilus subtilis and enterococcus faecium. Dogs love it and it's good for them - what else could you ask for?  (It's also available in an economical 30 lb. bag, too.)

review/summary: Great food ... if you enjoy cleaning up diarhhea
review/text: I would give this food -100 stars if possible.  Bought this about a month back.  Slowly transitioned my 7 yr old lab to the food.  First time I gave her more than 1/2 cup she had horrendous diarhhea.  Not just once, were talking many times throughout the night.  Stopped the food.  Got her back on her last food (Iams...allegedly inferior yet never gave her 12 hour diarhhea).  Tried the Blue one more time with the same result.  Google "blue dog food diarhhea" and you'll see that this is not an isolated incident.  I don't know what the story is, but I have never seen my dog so sick from a dog food.  Not worth it.  No thanks. Proceed with extreme caution.  Don't say you weren't warned.<br /><br />Oh and I live in an apartment.  An apartment I just moved into a month ago.  An apartment that is very nice and had brand new carpeting that Ill need to steam clean to get spots out?  Yeah, not too thrilled with Blue.  I'm blue allright.  Blue in the face from the mess I cleaned up tonight.

review/summary: Runny Stools
review/text: Although this food does have good quality ingredients, my German Shepherd never really had any solid stools while on it.  While switching him to this food, he had diarrhea even though I switched him over VERY slowly.  I still stayed with the food thinking that the diarrhea had to do with switching the main meat component from lamb to chicken.  After three months on it though, his stools are still mostly runny.  I have since change to the Taste of the Wild which he actually love to eat (it smells pretty good too) and his stools are improving.  This does not mean that Blue Buffalo is not a good choice for your dog.  Rather I would try it out and see how your dog does on it.  If you find that their stools are not improving then switch.

review/summary: Great Buffalos!
review/text: After doing some research, and having a general feeling that I needed to get our beloved Shih Tzu off of a store bought brand that touts itself as being for "Pedigree" dogs in their small crunchy bits formula, I wanted to switch her to something of high quality.<br /><br />One of the things that started to steer me towards a new quality dog food was the content and lack of consistency of our beloved fur baby's little poos.  They were always very dry, pebbly, crunchy and small.  Sometimes she would go multiple times when out walking in one day just to empty out her "system".  Sometimes she would go 2-3 days without pooing a nugget.  When she would go, it looked like she was having to put a monumental effort into it, with straining, grunting, eyes bugging out, etc.  Since this had been the norm all her life, and she certainly was never in a state of dehydration, we finally asked our vet what the deal was, and she pointed at the food.<br /><br />Enter Blue Buffalo.  After a very, very slow and successful acclimation process, things got much better (you really must do this over 6-weeks).  We never had any of the issues some folks in other reviews of mentioned of overly runny poo, diarrhea, etc.  What we did notice was that her poo became very consistent, regular, and she now poos something the size of a BUFFALO patty.  O.o  They are huge, a bit moist, tender and very fragrant now!  The straining and grunting is gone.  When she goes now, they just shoot out of her like a well oiled, long rocket exiting a missile silo.  You can also smell it from 20' away on an upwind breeze.  Just how you'd expect a fresh mound to be.  We are still shocked that something of that size could even emanate from a 12lb precious.<br /><br />We were a bit surprised at the size of the food itself.  We started with the small breed sized food and it was way to small.  The normal sized food was more on order of being comparable to the old food.  To give a comparison, the small breed size is about pea sized.  The regular is more like the size of irregular shaped, small marbles.  She liked the normal size much better, as she could actually feel like she had something to chew on, which is better for her teeth anyway.<br /><br />We have also noticed a significant improvement in her coat and skin.  She has long suffered from hot spots and dry skin patches that she would sometimes incessantly chew on.  We used to have to give her a medication from the vet (a form of steroid) to cool her skin at times during the summer to keep her from chewing herself raw in certain areas.  This has all disappeared!<br /><br />In summary, the food is great stuff, and has worked several wonders on our beloved Shih Tzu.  Hope it does the same for your fur babys!

review/summary: BEWARE!!  Made my dog Sick!!!
review/text: I am writing this review to warn other dog owners of Blue Buffalo for dogs and what it has done to my 5 yr. old Miniature Dachshund named "Calla". Back in late October 2011 I switched to Blue Buffalo after it was recommended by a family member. By mid-November Calla started to cry out at night. We thought it might be a back issue and our "Three" yes three Vets agreed that it could be Intervertebral Disc Disease. We had blood work done in November and everything looked fine with the exceptions that she was a "little" dehydrated. After months of treatments, with little to no improvement we thought it might be a stomach issue and I started to think about the timing of the change to Blue Buffalo, then I went and goggled "Consumer complaints about Blue Buffalo Pet Foods" and started to really connect the dots. Yesterday she was diagnosed with "Pancreatitis" and needs to be in the hospital for days for treatment. I have spent over 3K to this point and do not know if Calla will ever recover fully from this. She was a completely healthy dog before we changed to Blue Buffalo and since have been living in Hell with nighty episodes. Please read up on this issues people are having with this product before you buy. I wish I could give a product -minus 5 stars!!!!

review/summary: Highly recommend
review/text: After slowly transitioning to this food over the period of a week, I did notice some looser stools just as many other people reviewing this product.  Towards the end of this transition time the stools became normal and it is a dogfood that he loves to eat.  I can't say that the "lifebits" that are in the mix is his favorite thing to eat, but most of the time his bowl is clean.  If he leaves anything in his bowl, it would be a few (2-3) of those which is a very small percentage of what was in the bowl to begin with.<br /><br />My dog IS a PICKY eater and with other brands I have often had to add a small treat to his bowl in order for him to eat it all, but I do not have that issue with this brand.  The one thing that I have done is to add some warm water to the bits which makes them softer as well as release the aroma and flavor.  My dog reacts the same way as he would have if I put some gravy on top of his food when I do that.<br /><br />He has gone from walking up to his bowl and looking at me wondering where his "treat" is so that he can eat to jumping up on his hind legs, bouncing around excited that he is about to be fed.<br /><br />The only downside I can think of with this product is that just like some other posters pointed out, there was evidence of some loose stool during transition and that the lifebits does not seem to be something that he enjoys eating.

review/text: If you eat healthy, why shouldn't your dog? This brand is SO great at providing natural and healthy ingredients in my dog's diet. I own a large dog that has a sensitive stomach and is prone to allergies. We started him off slow with Blue Buffalo and he has had no problems whatsoever. He LOVES the taste of it too if gobbling it up as soon as it hits the bowl is any sign. He is usually not the type of dog that eats RIGHT AWAY. We've tried to keep him on a schedule so he doesn't just eat whenever he feels like it. It's been tough, but this food has helped to encourage him to eat his food when it's set out. As a family we have been trying to eat natural, organic, and whole unprocessed foods. We decided our dog should get the same great diet and results we've been feeling.

review/text: I was feeding my dog Wellness brand food and he seemed to be bored with it after a few months so I bought this. He was so excited about the new food and didn't hesitate to scarf it down. He has never had much problem eating anything I buy him, but keeping his interest can be a bit of a problem. The food smells nice (for dog food), kinda earthy and natural. He is still interested in it after several weeks and his energy seems good. He is white and has a sensitive coat and this stuff does well to keep his coat shiny so far. I gave it four stars because it gives him gas (not fun for him or me) and he is not fully adjusted yet (some loose stools). I'm not sure if we will get it again.

review/text: I have been eating these since I was a kid and I still love them to this day. They make me happy just seeing them in the bowl, what a comfort food! Love the little franks...I save most of them for last like a little kid. I am amazed that Amazon can ship something this heavy for such a low price. These are usually about $1.49 a can at the grocery store plus 9.25% sales tax so getting them for this price (including shipping) delivered to my front door is a real deal.

review/text: I've been looking for noodles like these for years. Found a bag on sale at the local grocery, but they're not always available. With the order from Amazon I can keep them on hand. These noodles are delicious. They withstand lots of time in the soup pot. They are wonderful in soup or with stew. My family loves them.

review/summary: Best Noodles
review/text: We discovered Mrs.Millers Noodles on one of our periodic visits to Ohio Amish country, and always make it a point to stop by the factory store when we're in the area.  I like a noodle that still has some chewiness after it's been cooked, and these fill the bill.<br /><br />That said, from now on I'll probable get my fix of Mrs. Miller from Amazon. Even though they are still more expensive than the average mass-market product,  as a Prime member (and anyone who buys more than 2 or 3 times a year should be), the price per bag for a case of the noodles is significantly below retail.  Sadly, one of the most expensive places to buy online is direct from the factory, because their shipping rates are sky high for single cases.  A retailer in our area recently began to carry this product, but at a cost of 90 cents a bag more (when they're in stock).<br /><br />Great product, but always check the price before you buy.

review/text: I was expecting whole peanuts and was disappointed when I received 10 lbs of broken peanuts wrapped in 2 layers of large plastic bags.  The Superior Nut Company said they did not have any whole organic peanuts but this kind.  They were willing to refund me if I still had the original whole package.  If you want to purchase this item, do not believe what you see in the product picture.  The peanuts that I got tasted fresh and sweet, but they looked like leftovers. Make sure that you get what you intend to get before order this product.

review/summary: Saves a lot of calories and money
review/text: This might not be as great as the coffee down at your local cafe or Starbuck's but it is the next best thing, low in calories and fat. With all the calories you save, you can dress it up with your own cocoa powder on top and still be ahead of the game. Buying in bulk means saving even more money. Just keep in mind that the pack will be half milk discs and half coffee discs so it will be more expensive than buying just straight coffee. You might want to use only half the milk disc by brewing two cups and then splitting it.  Some people find Gevalia bitter, but it is certainly better than Maxwell House. I love the House Blend Starbuck's discs myself, with one of these creamers. Still a fraction of what you have to pay in a shop. Enjoy!

The seller at least emailed me to let me know that (after of course the product was already on its way).<br /><br />The product itself isn't that great. The milk discs don't always work correctly and it doesn't taste nearly as good as most of the other Tassimo drinks.

I won't be buying this again.

I would return this product if it wasn't such a bother. I can't believe this product made it through product development. Do yourself a favor and don't repeat my mistake in ordering this product.

It has a bold sweet flavor, not bland and gooey like store bought clover honey.  There is no strange smell or aftertaste.  It's just good honey, we pour it right on our bread, ice cream, pancakes, margaritas, and anything else we like to sweeten up.  The consistency is nice as well, it's not gloppy like rubber cement, it's nice and syrupy. I've bought several honeys on line and this one is my favorite to date.

review/summary: All three of my cat's rate it a BIG 10! 10! 10!
review/text: Simon, about 7 years old has some kind of adversity to most foods and throws up shortly after eating canned or dry cat food and nearly died from, can you believe, bronchitis? ...2 years ago. We have gone through many foods, dry and canned until I found Holistic Select canned cat food(He gets the Salmon or Ocean Fish). He loves it...and does NOT throw it up!!! ...even tho he only gets about 2-3 teaspoons morning and night and not a lot of dry, 2 x's day. He somehow still manages to weigh 14 pounds.<br /><br />Bella, a mostly gray with white chest and paws, about 10 years old would most likely fit within the widest part of a 16 oz soda bottle, in other words she is soooo skinny ...and might I mention FINICKY!  Her biggest nick name is Princess. She "cautiously" walks up to a new food I put down, sniff's it and IF she likes it, adjusts her sitting position, sometimes moving to a different angle before she slowwwly starts nibbling. She USUALLY does NOT like them and has this look on her face that says "You've GOT to be kidding me if you think I will EAAAAT THAAAAT!!!!! EWWWWWW!!!". She stands back up, shakes her paw and glances at me as she runs/hops off like a deer into the woods. Bella IS the reason I tried the Holistic Select. When I put the HS down for her, my eyes nearly popped out of my head. She QUITE eagerly, without hesitation or any adjustment to her seating spot or angle dove in as if she had not eaten in a week or more. She will only eat the Salmon or Ocean Fish. I have tried the Duck and the turkey and "no way!" I would so like for her to gain at least one pound! I think she still weighs about SIX pounds and eats as much as a fly. To make sure she is the only one eating her food, I bought her a bird cage "dining room". She is the only one of the three cats that fits thru the entrance.<br /><br />Then there's Bob, a brown tabby! What about Bob is what we always say. Bob doesn't run from much and eats more than he runs from. The least picky, doesn't throw up and is, like Simon about 7 years old. They're best buds, btw. (Bob also nearly died about 2 years ago from liver disease.) Usually, Bob quietly hangs out by his bowl near the stove, tripping us or getting stepped on. Knowing he is going to get HS, he has frequently becomes quite vocal in anticipation of his "Happy" meal.<br /><br />I, THE cats so recommend trying Holistic Select. Petco, when they kept it ON their shelves, sold it for $2.49 a can(even if you buy a case of it!). They said they did not sell enough for them to stock it and encouraged me to order it thru their website. I always have to "shop around" and found it on Amazon for $1.90 a can. I'm IN and Petco is losing OUT! (Initially, I would encourage buying a can, if you can find it at petco to see if your cat will eat it. They will order some for you but u have to check back &lt;they don't call you when it arrives!>, they just put it on the shelf and it disappears FAST). Once you know it's good to go, order online. If you do the Prime shipping thing on Amazon, most everything you buy is shipped free.<br /><br />Merry Christmas!<br />~Yvonne

review/text: Desperation led me to try this food although I wasn't crazy about the brewers dried yeast or potatoes. I needed to try something without fish in it for my kitties when 2 of my 3 cats started to get flaky skin from food that did contain fish. I found it quite a challenge to find a good food that doesn't include some type of seafood.  As this one did not, I reluctantly decided to give it a try.  All 3 cats seemed to enjoy it, but I will not be buying it again.  Even though the moisture is only the usual 78%, it is so mushy and just awful to work with.  My girls didn't seem to mind, but between the consistency, yeast and potatoes this just doesn't cut it for my cats.  I'll have to be satisfied with fewer foods in their rotation.

review/summary: Simply the best
review/text: No Pudge Fudge fat free brownie mix is simply the best brownie mix I have ever been fortunate enough to discover. I loved it so much I bought a case of it! No one carries it where I live. I actually discovered it at a great store called Wildberries in Arcata Ca, where my daughter is attending Humboldt State University.<br /><br />This mix is so fudgy, chewy and rich tasting but with no fat. All you add is vanilla and some yougert. The ingredient list is short and full of real foods, no preservatives, junk, high fructose corn syrup, nada!!<br /><br />If I met this woman I would squish her with hugs. I have to only make them once in a while but I am a good girl, I only eat one a day.<br />The last batch I made into mini cupcakes and they were the bomb! I add crushed walnuts, hazelnuts and some sunflower seeds to mine.<br />I will buy these until they no longer make them and that better be when I am gone from this great planet!!<br />You can't go wrong with this mix. I am also going to try the other flavors but I love mint the best.<br />I am a brownie lover and these are the best ever.They are better than homemade!

review/summary: Chewy w/ a nice crust
review/text: I'm not a fan of cake mixes because I usually find the end result tastes like sugared cardboard. However, No Pudge makes nice brownies that are both chewy and crusty. No, they don't taste like brownies made from scratch, but they are the next best.

review/summary: Delicious but hard to bake evenly
review/text: These are so yummy!  And sooo easy to make.  The only downfall is that we find it difficult to bake them evenly.  We have begun making them in cupcake pans and this seems to work great.  If you have a mini muffin pan it might even work better.  When you use a cake pan the outside is baked nicely but the center is gooey.  If you try baking the center the edges get burnt... at least in our experience.

review/summary: Perfect Brownies
review/text: I have noticed as I have grown, my tastes have become more particular in some areas. Brownies are one such area. I developed an increasing dislike for most brownie mixes, but I love brownies. With this problem, No Pudge brownies were a blessing, as they are exactly how I believe brownies should be in texture, not too dry nor too gooey. The addition of mint flavoring (I adore mint) is simply a bonus.<br /><br />As the store I've been buying this mix from seems to have stopped carrying them, and I'm not sure where else still carries them, I was very pleased to find them on Amazon. Though I will keep an eye out at appropriate stores for this item, I am certain I will buy the 6-pack here.

review/summary: SO tasty and chewy
review/text: These brownies are beyond great.  I make them in ramkins and they stay delicious for days.  You can scoop with a spoon and it feels like a special dessert - not like a substitute for a real brownie because it tastes  it is better than boxed brownies.

review/summary: Back to Nature Crispy Wheat Crackers - 8 oz.
review/text: These crackers are made by Back to Nature Foods located in Madison, WI--made in the USA! I give these crackers 4/5 for flavor, 5/5 for texture, 5/5 for maintaining Earth conscious integrity, 0/5 for truth in labeling--score 3.5<br /><br />The carton is made of 100% recycled paperboard and the ink is derived from vegetables. The company supports the Nature Conservancy (Protecting nature, preserving life).<br /><br />These are crispy wheat crackers with a sweet and mild flavor.  These are super crispy crackers that will hold up to any dip or topping.<br /><br />The sweetness adds just enough flavor to make your toppings pop.  I personally serve them with fish dips (salmon) and cheese toppings--yummy!<br /><br />The crackers are made of unbleached enriched flour and contain wheat flour, niacin, reduced iron, thiamine mononitrate (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), folic acid, safflower oil, raw sugar, defatted wheat germ, cornstarch, brown rice syrup, sea salt, malted barley extract, leavening (monocalcium phosphate, baking soda), natural turmeric flavor.<br /><br />The 8 oz package contain 8 servings--17 crackers.  Each serving contains 130 cal., 4 g fat, .5 g polyunsaturated fat, 2.5 g monounsaturated fat, 230 mg sodium, 55 mg potassium, 22 g carbs, 1 g fiber, 4 g sugars, 2 g protein.<br /><br />The package states that the crackers contain no artificial perservatives or flavors and no hydrogenated oils.  However, the product does contain Thiamine mononitrate which is a 'synthetic form' of vitamine B1, and medical and nutrition experts recommend a daily potassium intake of 4.7 g per/day.<br /><br />Don't forget to recycle the box!

review/summary: Sweet and Sour Rice
review/text: I just happened to pick up some of this rice from the christmas tree shop a few weeks ago.  It really is the best chinese rice outside of a restaurant.  Needless to say, I was really bummed when it has been currently not available for some time now on amazon.com.  I have checked all of our local grocery stores and no one carries this item, so I went back to the christmas tree shop and purchased all 12 of them that they had left.  Amazon, please make this rice available again.  It really is the greatest and also super easy to make.

review/summary: not strong enough
review/text: I have to admit that I am quite picky when it comes to rice, so there's a good chance you'll enjoy this more than I have.  Having said that, I am not a big fan of this particular rice.  The sauce is not nearly strong enough to overpower the plain white rice taste; I would have liked the sauce to be a bit thicker and stronger in flavour.  I generally love sweet and sour anything, but this didn't do it for me.  If you're like me and have a palette for strong flavours, I'd recommend getting the Taste of India Spiced Rice with Raisin instead.

review/summary: Soooo Good
review/text: These bars are great.  I bought them thinking that they were not going to be good and I was pleasantly surprised.  I keep one in my purse everywhere I go so I never find myself without a gluten free snack.  This helps me not trip up and have something with gluten if I am stuck in a situation where I can't find something good to eat.

review/summary: $27.00 at stores
review/text: I have several cats that had been on top shelf foods. I had to make cuts, and after quite some time weaning them off one, and then another, found Taste of the wild, trout, to be very good. The ingredients and nutrients are comparable to higher priced foods. They even list the PH on their website (can't remember, but just right).<br />Some threw up with the venison.<br />Tractor and Farm Supply stores (not just in the country) carry this, so do our natural pet stores for around $27.00.<br />I would suggest shopping around.

review/summary: best gum i've ever chewed
review/text: this was literally the best gum i had ever bought. i am not sure why it became discontinued, but i cannot find it in any stores anymore, which is annoying. i can only buy it on amazon now it seems, but i don't like to buy food and the like online. its hard to believe this gum would have become unpopular, since it had a truly long lasting flavor, and it was mouth watering too. i hope stores decide to start selling again.
