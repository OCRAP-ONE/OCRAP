review/summary: WHAT?
review/text: I just recieved 54 Starbucks Caffe Verona KCups from "Oranges to Dollars", LOOSE in a cardboard box! AND many of the cups are swollen; the aluminum lid has ballooned up!  There is no way to tell the freshness of the product and I am going to assume that because many have popped tops they are NOT fresh product.  Having ordered many cases of Kcups over the years I have never seen the likes of this.  It looks like they have taken these cups from many other boxes and threw them into a box without a care whatso ever to the quality of said coffee containers.  First and last time.  I felt like I have been slapped!  Fortunately, I happen to have two storage cases for kcups, what if I didn't and I wasn't even afforded the "luxury" of simple product packaging to have some form of containment?  Done.  Oranges to Dollars...you made lemons into lemonade and a nice profit.

review/text: Cafe Verona is my favorite of the Starbucks coffees and I was delighted to see it available in K Kups; however, I do not understand why the price is so high on Amazon when it's available at Costco for $34.95 for the 54 count package.  This price difference boggles my mind.  I've also noticed the Starbucks KKups available in grocery stores for a lower price per unit than Amazon.  This is why I gave the product one star only.

review/text: I was looking for a "manly" gift to give my husband for Valentine's Day.  This item was perfect.  The black and red gives it more of a masculine look to it.  It was nicely arrange with each heart stacked on top of each other, wrapped in cellophane and tied with a black and red ribbon. The chocolates were delicious, smooth and creamy.  Everything in the boxes was pretty tasty.  I was surprised that the bottom of each box was filled with shredded red paper so they are actually filled half way with goodies.  The heart shaped boxes are made of quality cardboard and make perfect gift boxes to use again.  There is no writing on the boxes that specify "Happy Valentine's Day", so this is a great gift for any occasion or just to simply say I love you.

review/text: The price was right but the coffee is very one dimensional and has a flat taste.  I'm on my 4th bag and I've tried using less coffee-(it tastes watery) using more coffee-(it's way too strong).  It's hard to explain, the coffee is not bitter and not acidic but it's boring, there is very little aroma when it is brewing and no sign of oil on the top of the cup.  I no longer look forward to my morning coffee, I would not buy again.

When you open the pack you have to restrain you self from sniffing it up your nose. I keep the open pack in the frig; not like I have to as the family plows through a pack a week. For store bought coffee this rivals some of the more exotic sourced coffee.

review/summary: Pleasantly surprised
review/text: After trying another Jacobs coffee and disliking it very much I was fairly sure that we would feel the same about this one. Wrong.<br />Is it fabulous? No, it isn't but it is a very nice coffee.<br />These bags are tightly vacuum packed and stay that way. No air gets inside to spoil the coffee.<br />The first thing you notice when opening the bag is the delightful aroma of fresh coffee. It sort of jumps out at you.<br />Next you will see that the grind is about the finest I've ever seen other than espresso powder. The coffee inside the bag is quite powdery but it was not dry and actually packs into the coffee measuring scoop.<br /><br />On brewing the first pot I saw that the water ran through quite fast producing a rather weak pot of brew. For future pots, after the grounds were a little wet, I stopped the brewing for a minute allowing the grounds to 'bloom' then started the brewing process again. A MUCH better pot of full flavor, robust coffee with a slight acidity was produced.<br /><br />One should note that the price of this imported coffee is very good and much more reasonable other imports.<br /><br />Jacobs Kronung coffee is not my favorite coffee but it is very good and drinkable.

review/summary: Hassle free, great on the go food
review/text: The Keebler PB&J crackers are extremely difficult to find in major grocery chains but when you do find them, hang onto them. They are the perfect travel food for just about everyone. You can taste the grape jelly even though you can't see it. It tastes like a mini PB&J sandwhich! I like the way it is packaged and if they used actual grape jelly the crackers would be soggy and just be a mess. This way the crackers stay fresh and aren't soggy, I don't find the crackers greasy or crumble in your hand (the PB actually holds it together). If you are looking for a hassle free snack or something to keep handy this is the food for you.<br /><br />I ordered from Amazon and signed up for the Subscribe and Save program! Happy eating.

review/text: I have only found a few gluten free crackers I like, this IS NOT one of them. I purchased these at Sam's Club, in a box containing 2 bags. These crackers were hard, not crunchy, almost seemed stale. The first bite didn't taste too bad but they left an awful, odd after-taste, similar to burned grain. The texture wasn't too bad, not the usual prepackaged gluten-free grainy texture. My husband went Gluten-Free when I had to, he almost almost anything and he doesn't like them either. We tried them plain, with cream cheese, with cream cheese/olives, in salad, with cheddar cheese, nacho cheese but nothing would conceal the after-taste, in my opinion they were Horrible! I would say it is just my taste buds but...I not 1 of my 5 kids, 4 of which will eat pretty much anything, liked these. We offered them to friends, family, and neighbors but after trying them no one would take them. It could be possible that we purchased a bad batch, there were 2 packages in the box, but I don't think we want to chance buying and wasting another box. After reading some of the other reviews it appears many people love them, I guess you never know unless you try them. We hated to toss them in the trash so we occasionally used them as dog treats, the dogs did like them.

review/text: This porridge arrived with the tab/seal on the box already opened which I thought was a bit strange, nevertheless this is my babies favorite breakfast so I thought maybe it will be okay and give him some to eat, that day he threw up a number of times which was uncharacteristic for him. Perhaps this wasn't the fault of the porridge but because the packaging was opened when I received it I felt like an idiot and threw it out, I was not going to take any chances!!!

review/summary: Ideal diet for a Rhodesian Ridgeback
review/text: This is the only food our 12 year old Rhodesian Ridgeback has ever eaten (plus a single square of Kraft American cheese daily as a treat and a few chicken breast treats.)  Kramer is in great health and people are always amazed at how fit and strong he is.  That he still has all his teeth is surely attributable to the Active Care hard kibble diet and the near absolute lack of any signs of arthritis must be one of the benefits of the "healthy joint formula."  Both Kramer and I cannot recommend Active Care highly enough.

review/summary: Good chips but flavor not as strong as bag bought locally
review/text: I just bought myself a bag of these shrimp chips from a local market.  I grew up with these and enjoy them a lot.  Thought I would try to save some money by buying them in bulk through Amazon.  Good deal but having just had a bag of these, I could immediately distinguish a blandness of taste in comparison.  Still the same good shrimp flavor but only about half as strong as the bag I got locally.  Not sure if it's maybe because the ones from Amazon aren't as fresh.  The 12 pack I received have an expiration date of Aug 2011.  I didn't think to check the expiration on the bag I bought locally.<br /><br />How I'm going to eat 12 bags of these by Aug 2011 I have no idea.  And I worry I might actually succeed!

review/summary: Arrowhead Mills flour may not be gluten free.
review/text: I think I've turned into a troll when it comes to this company; it turns out they don't use dedicated gluten-free lines in their production.  So, if you're baking with this because you have celiac, it might make you sick.<br /><br />And, to echo, "Gritty" above, I'll raise you one, 'gritty' and add, 'so gritty it's inedible'.  I spent a week of evenings trying to make gluten-free shortbread with this stuff:  it's like sand.<br /><br />After a long search, because a lot of what is sold as gluten free, either isn't, or is only 'legally' gluten free, meaning that on the day samples of it were tested it had only 20 ppm (or the company is claiming that), I found gluten free rice flour:  Koda farms in California only mills rice--and they are not expensive.  Look for their white rice flour under the name, "Kokuho Rose Premium Rice Flour" or "Diamond K", either from the Asian section of your grocery store, Koda farms online, or occasionally on Amazon.

review/text: I purchased 4 pkgs of rice flour.  The rice flour seems to be of good quality.  I purchased other items from a different seller the same day which arrived much sooner than the rice flour did.  The flour was sent in a large box with only one air pocket plastic.  The flour had lots of room to slide around and at least one bag was punctured and leaked flour.  I was disappointed at the short expiration time on all four bags of flour.<br />I was not pleased enough to reorder.

review/text: Ok, it is just rice flour so it is hard to write a review that raves of the amazing power of it etc. Howe4ver, clean organic product that comes packaged in nicely--free from contaminants when stored well. I use this flour in all my gluten free recipes and it works exactly as rice flour should.<br />Tip: when baking something that requires a wet ingredients you can add that wet ingredient to the rice flour and let it soak for a while to remove some of the "gritty" texture rice flour can have in baked goods. So, if for example, the pancake recipe calls for milk, add the milk to the rice flour and let soak in the fridge for a few hours before using.

review/summary: Terrible packaging!
review/text: When I received my order the box was totally fine and undamaged.  The bags of flour were wrapped all together in a green plastic which also looked to be in good condition and there were also several of those air filled shipping bags in the box.  However there was flour everywhere!  Once opened we found that 3 out of the 4 bags had rips all the way down the side.  It was pretty clear that amazon did fine in packaging the product but the packaging from the actual manufacturer is what was terrible.<br /><br />I won't be buying from Arrowhead Mills anymore which is too bad because they are typically cheaper than Bob's Red Mill or other GF flour companies.  However this is not the first time we've had issues with their packaging (when bought from a brick and mortar store) and in the past I've also ordered Arrowhead Mills products that were expired before I even received them.<br /><br />Spend the extra money on Bob's Red Mill or another company that packages it's product appropriately and takes care to make sure their products are fresh.

I generally use as little rice flour as is necessary. (My disllike is not for Arrowhead Mills, but for rice flour in general.) My hubby's preferences are the whole grain flours like amaranth, sorghum, teff, etc.

review/summary: Beautiful idea, but not that great in person
review/text: I drop shipped these "Award Winning" hazlenut chocolates to my mom when she was in the hospital. About a month later I was able to visit her. In person, the rectangular chocolates are more like fudge squares, and they had a fudgie consistency. I thought the flavor was kind of bland. My mom--who loves chocolate--only ate two candies out of one of the boxes and left the rest.<br /><br />Several months earlier I had also sent an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PUQOQY">Empress Gift Box, Assorted Gem Gift Box, 11.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>, and my mom had said she liked those. (She also ate them, so I never got to try them myself.) I think the Gem candies were more like normal chocolate and might be a better choice if you are looking for chocolates to send over Amazon. I had taken the chance on the Hazlenut Truffles because the Gems had gone over well.<br /><br />I'm giving the Hazlenut Truffles two stars, because I love the idea of several small boxes of chocolates in a bundle, where you can order nice candy and give a box to as many as three people for a reasonable price. (The Empress Chocolate prices seem to fluctuate between ~$14 and ~$25.) I thought the presentation was decent, but the hazlenut candies themselves just weren't that good.

review/summary: Perfect afternoon snack to help avoid a feeding frenzy
review/text: I love the fact that these pretzels come in 100 calorie packs. It is just the right amount for an afternoon snack. We have a bunch of pretzels, peanuts, almonds, etc. on a snack table at work. Around 2:30 every afternoon my resolve to stay away from the salty, filling (and fattening) yummy goodness on the table would start to wane. By 2:32 I would be coming up with reasons to hover around the snack table. By 2:40 I'd be covered in peanut shells, done with my feeding frenzy and figuring out how I was going to avert a repeat performance tomorrow. Then I found Snyder's of Hanover 100 Calorie packs. Seriously, folks, they are my saving grace. And they have just the right amount of salt. I thought 60 bags would be a ridiculous amount if pretzels to purchase, but it worked out great, they lasted a couple of months and I've already purchased another box.

review/summary: Smashed !!
review/text: I will never order this item from Amazon again!  The carton was delivered with no protective box or wrap around it.  The carton was mutilated and at least half of each bag of pretzels was smashed to crumbs.  Worst of all, this item can NOT be returned.<br />From now on, I'll buy my pretzels from Target.  They cost about 3 cents a bag more, you can buy fewer than 12 bags at a time and the pretzels come whole.

review/text: I would love to give this product 1,000 stars but I can't because I'm actually addicted to these! So yes, these are the best pretzels bar none (I guess I don't care for salty pretzels), but I can eat a whole bag in one sitting and doing so is about 900 calories. I cannot seem to stop at a single serving. Help!!!!

review/summary: Mini Pretzels
review/text: I had been looking for these unsalted pretzels for awhile.  I try to limit sodium, but love pretzels.  I used to live in PA (Snyder's headquarters) and could get them all the time.  Since moving to the midwest, I have not been able to find them.  I was very disappointed in them when they were shipped.  About 1/4 of the bag was pieces and crumbs.  Another reviewer mentioned this and I should have known, but I really had been craving pretzels and was hoping that Snyders had fixed their problem with shipping. Pretzels, great; shipping not so goood.

review/summary: Salt Free Pretzels
review/text: It had been more and more difficult to find decently priced Salt free pretzels in the stores.  The price offered by the case plus the free shipping made it possible to have a continual supply of unsalted pretzels in the house, without paying an arm and a leg.  The only problem was that, with the change of the expiration date on the credit card, Amazon's instructions resulted in my buying two cases instead of one.  But, the product is worth the price.

review/text: Not all pretzels are created equal.  These are fat free, and made from, if I'm not mistaken, a whole grain flour.  If I had a bag on hand, I'd look at the ingredients label and tell you exactly what kind of whole grain flour, but we're out at the present time (what a surprise).  My daughter loves to snack on these, and as a snack item, they beat a bunch of alternatives hands down.  The only thing..... they're addictive.  Get yourself a little bowl and don't go back for more!  Moderation in all things......

However they are bags with 3 servings each, each bag has 330 calories and 3.5 ounce bags.  I called twice, my order was re-sent only to find that they are exactly the same.  I wanted the 100 calorie pack so I can know exactly what I am eating in a setting.  Customer service person seemed foreign and did not understand my concern.

review/summary: Wild for this stuff
review/text: This is the awesome sauce you've heard about. In a cheesy not saucy kind of way. This processed cheese food come closer to the taste of cheddar than most processed cheese foods. It's what cheddar would taste like if it were a cheese food and not actually a cheese. The tip has little notches in it like a star tip for a pastry bag so when you push down on the tip it dispenses in a fancy star shape or a nice looking line instead of just a plain line. It's decorative and tasty. It's like cheese frosting for crackers, meatloaf or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5NHE">Spam</a>.<br />My favorite way to eat it is on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F9XBD4">Wheat Thins</a>.<br />For parties, I recommend serving it on crackers in a star shape, and topping the crack with half of a pimento stuffed olive. It will look very classy!

review/text: I bought this pack of Apple juice but I think should of gotten a 100% juice bcuz this is 60% juice but has a strange after taste. Your mouth feels a little oily after drinking this and leaves your mouth feeling like you popped a Fish Oil capsule in your mouth. I think you should buy a different brand like Motts or TreeTop and/or go for an Organic Apple Juice jug. I would not recommend this to anyone tastes okay but the after taste is gross.
