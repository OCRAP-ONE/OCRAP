review/text: I absolutely LOVE white chocolate so I was extremely happy to see this. That was until I actually tasted it. 2 words, WATERED DOWN! I have the platinum keurig, so I have a choice on the cup size, and even the smallest size is too watery. It helps to add some half & half or milk though. Or use it as a way to spruce up a coffe, then your coffee will have a semi white chocolate java feel going on.

review/summary: A drink that's unique and versatile
review/text: Having tried this product yesterday, I can definitely recommend it.  First, as others have pointed out, white chocolate is not the same as regular chocolate, so if you are expecting this to be a cup of Nestle Hot Cocoa you will be disappointed.  It is a sweet drink, and looks like hot milk, but I found it very tasty and was quite pleased.  Second, it's great for mixing with other stuff:  I tried some with Baileys Irish Cream (YUM!).  I also put in a packet of instant hot cocoa with caramel in the mug first and then made this - my 11-yr old took the mug and wouldn't give it back!  I plan on experimenting with other combinations as well, but so far this has my stamp of approval.

review/summary: Artifical sweetener
review/text: To keep this short, like all K-cup cocoas I've seen available this one contains artificial sweetener (sucralose aka Splenda), presumably to offset the smaller portion vs. packets with a sweetener that's sweeter than sugar. Since I hate the taste of acesulfame potassium & sucralose I've disliked all the K-cup cocoa varieties. According to Timothy's website the standard packets of their White Hot Chocolate don't contain artificial sweeteners so that may be an option, but I'll stick with mixing cocoa powder & sugar in a cup and lose some convenience.

review/text: At first glance, Timothy's White Hot Chocolate was not what I expected.  It is actually white, which may disturb some folks.  However, it is very good.  It is very sweet, and a good alternative for the non-coffee drinking crowd.  I personally like to make it on the small setting and then add a small setting portion of flavored coffee.  (Gloria Jean's Sleigh Ride and the white chocolate are awesome!)  I have hooked many of my co-workers on the half white chocolate/ half coffee concoction and they love it!

review/text: I know many reviewers thought this was too sweet, but I loved it.  It's not a milk chocolate drink, but a white chocolate drink.  It has a hot sweet milky taste that I love on the weekends when I don't want or need a caffeine fix.  It's great with brunch, donuts, popcorn and a dvd or even by itself as a late night comfort drink.  I love hot chocolate too, but this is a different taste and a wonderful yummy experience if you like something new.

review/summary: A dessert in a cup!
review/text: I really love my Keurig and when I got a chance to get the White Hot Chocolate I jumped on it! It is wonderful. It isn't coffee, so it doesn't have the same kick or taste. It has a wonderful white chocolate flavor and aroma. I use the 8oz setting. You can try it many ways (just read the box for more suggestions) and enjoy it. The kids add stuff like whipped cream and sprinkles to it to make it fun. I add a little 1/2 and 1/2 to make make it sweet and creamy. It doesn't do for hot chocolate what it does for coffee, but it does brew it easier and the flavor of white chocolate is very unique and satisfying as an after dinner dessert. If you want hot chocolate then brew just a cup of hot water and add powder. If you want something a little more unique, then buy the White Hot Chocolate.

review/text: A sample came with my Keurig one cup brewer along with other hot chocolate k cups. I read the reviews of this white hot chocolate and was not prepared to like it. I have to tell you that a cup of this satisfies that craving you get for "chocolate". No it's not brown, doesn't come wrapped in foil nor does it float in the air but boy is it good! The other hot chocolate varieties were weak and watered down...not worth the money. Would be interesting if Giardelli made k cups but alas just packets.

review/summary: Not sweet enough or strong enough
review/text: I knew the white hot chocolate by Timothy's was not going to be perfect because I have not found any k cup products to be as strong as I would like. However, because of the low price I thought I would try it anyway (it's a lot better than paying $2.00 apiece price at Dunkin Donuts). The white hot chocolate was not as strong or as sweet as I would have liked. I put a pack of sugar in it to make it sweeter. I still think it is a good value for an occassional "non Dunkie's" white hot chocolate. I can have 2 for a lower price and less calories than Dunkie's small size drink.

review/text: I have been a fan of these pistachios for a while so I am not going to go into how great they taste, that is obvious. I will go into the actual packaging since these pistachios usually come in larger bags that are hard to seal. The breakdown of the same amount of pistachios into 4 smaller bags is a stroke of brilliance. They are in my opinion the appropriate serving portion per bag and make it so much easier to keep the remainder freshly sealed. Give these pistachios a try and I promise you will be surprised at how much better they are compared to Planter's Pistachios.

Note that since it has a higher cocoa to agave ratio the calories per serving (two tablespoons) is higher (20 calories more) than the regular chocagave.<br /><br />My strawberry consumption has gone way up! Indeed, I am using these products to increase my fruit consumption by drizzling a little on my fruit.<br /><br />Also check out the vanilla-flavored agave by the same company. Also excellent (I used it recently to make a fat-free vanilla ice cream).

review/text: I am from the U.S(I'm 19), and after watching the yogscast I got curious about what jaffa cakes were. So I ordered them from here and they are seriously... these are the BEST cookies/biscuits/cakes I have ever tasted in my life. It's a shame they don't sell these in the U.S. This seller should sell these in Bulk. So then people like me from the U.S can save time and money. BUY THESE

review/text: Jaffa cakes arrived very fresh, and way ahead of schedule. Because of the hot weather, I will probably will not order these again until fall, as the chocolate melted the cakes together. No fault of the manufacturer or shipper. Also, the size package that I ordered was out of stock,so they sent the next bigger size at no charge.

review/summary: Good quality salt at a great price.
review/text: I've been using Himalayan salt for cooking and bathing for several years but I had never tried the larger granules until now.  It can be used similarly to kosher salt in cooking or sprinkled on a steak but it's not really good for using as you would smaller granules.  However, it can be put in a grinder and ground to be the size that can be used at the table.  I think the flavor of Himalayan salt is superior to every other salt I've tried, even the French and Irish salts that are quite pricey.  One of the advantages of Himalayan salt is the abundance of minerals it contains and the lack of processing.  It is simply mined and packaged, not taken from the ocean, dried, adulterated to keep it from caking then packaged.  Much closer to nature.

The shipping was excellent, and the tree came securely enveloped in a nest of packing peanuts.<br /><br />As for the tree itself, I have christened him Mr.Miag-Tree, after that infamous sensei that introduced the world to these majestic miniature arbors. Sitting on my desk, it brings me peace, serenity, and balance and at times makes my humble cube feel like the ancient boreal forests of the Orient.<br /><br />This coniferous fellow is a source of extreme merriment and joy, a beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak backdrop of masonry and anguish. So long as my juniper persists in this the harshest of environs, then so too can I.

review/summary: Not what I expected, but acceptable.
review/text: Well it could have been worse. The bonsai was in a healthy condition when it arrived(using standard 4-6 day shipping). However; it was all misshapen and contorted into a very un-bonsai state. The needle foliage was thin(Charlie Brown Christmas tree thin), but very green and vibrant. I know not every juniper bonsai will be the same, but this case is a little shameful to say the least.<br /><br />And at least put a "This side up" sticker on the box respectful to the bonsai's orientation, for Pete's sake.  If it's too much for you guys, I'll do it pro-bono. It's already bad enough the plant is subdued to stress in a dark, stuffy, box. You lose stars for that because now I have to train this juniper back to it's natural state--I could be wire training the older parts by now. How about getting familiar with a ruler before going on about 9" tall juniper in the description. This poor thing doesn't even reach 5" at best. The pot and the tree combined just make 7"<br /><br />I really hate to be mean, but this dishonors the respected Brussel's Bonsai name. I only bought this because of the Brussel's name-like most people. What I got can't be 3 years old either. Way too thin- almost a 1/3 of an inch. Thanks for the $20(shipping included) sapling+glazed pot and soil.<br /><br />I could have bought a juniper sapling for a few pennies on the dollar instead of one of these over-priced price pieces of feng shui.<br /><br />All my displeasure set aside- it arrived in good condition and quality(for a sapling). I was hoping for a natural, unpainted pot, but blue is nice. It arrived at a good time. And I'm looking forward to watching it grow over the years to come.<br /><br />One more thing please be honest in the description, thank you.

It may seem like a lot to shell out for Gatorade at first, but when you realize you're getting Gatorade at $2.15 a gallon with shipping costs included, a smile begins to show.

review/summary: Delicious, practical and easy to use
review/text: I had never cooked with fermented black beans before but I had seen them in several Thai and Chinese recipes.  For this price, I thought I'd give it a try.  Now I won't be without it.  It lasts forever, a little goes a long way, and combined with Sichuan peppercorns, really packs a flavor punch.  Highly recommend for stir fries.  Use your food processor to grind up a teaspoon or two then toss with garlic into your oiled wok before adding anything else.  Yum.

review/summary: Good flavor
review/text: I miss the shrimp & lobster sauce I ordered at restaurants when I lived in Maryland.  Moving to NC, the first place I ordered shrimp & lobster sauce at, I was so disappointed with the lack of flavor, a white bland sauce they call what is supposed to be this delicious dish.  So I did an online search for my recipe.  I remember black specks in the food I bought in MD saw that it was fermented black beans.  I purchased these to re-create the dish I missed so much.  These beans made the dish.  What I cooked looked & tasted almost exactly like what I used to order and am so happy that I can now make my own shrimp & lobster sauce at home.

review/summary: Fermented black beans
review/text: I used to be able to buy a fermented black bean paste that I loved.  I can't find it anymore.  So I tried these.  I always see the beans in my favorite "house tofu" dish at my favorite Chinese restaurant, and so I just dumped them in when I tried making it myself.  That didn't work.  The next time I'll definitely mash half the beans into a paste and add them early, then finish with more beans at the end.<br /><br />The bag is quite large.  I hope I can use them all up someday.  As for taste, they taste fine.  I just needed to mash some I think.

review/text: I was having a craving for chicken in black bean sauce, but there isn't a Chinese grocery nearby and the local supermarkets don't carry odd ingredients like this.  They are overpriced at Amazon compared to what I'd pay in a big-city Chinese grocery, but it beats driving all over trying to find them.  And, the bag is big enough that it will last me years.

review/summary: These bars are amazing
review/text: I recently tried both the Peanut and Almond varieties of the Nature Valley Roasted Nut Crunch. These bars are amazing! Imagine the flavor and crunch of brittle, but with just enough of the syrup to hold the nuts together. Also the nuts are a little salty, so the contrast is nice. This bar is all nuts. With just 7 and 6 grams of sugar respectively per bar, the 7 grams of protein and 2g of fiber are really attractive.<br />My daughter likes these as a snack before swimming because they give her an energy boost. I like the fact that they are more nutritionally balanced than most snack foods. They tend to crumble when you eat them, so eating them in bar form can be a challenge. I break them before I open the package, and pop the pieces in my mouth. Either way, they make a great snack.

review/text: I think these are great! The flavor is good...I love the combination of salty and sweet, and the sugar content is low compared to other bars I have eaten. They also have lots of protein and fiber. They are definitely a good alternative for those of us who are gluten free, especially since they are very affordable. The only criticism I have is that they are pretty hard, so I break them into little pieces so it's easier to eat.

review/text: These are good, but beware.  It's roasted nuts, so it's about 60% fat.  That's good for active people, and would be awesome as trail food, sports snacks, or for my kids, but for those of us who sit on our duffs all day, these don't meet our dietary needs.<br /><br />Even so, these are very tasty.  They're not too sweet, and not too salty.  All told, I like the Almond Crunch much better.  Both have peanuts.  Both are the same amount of protein, fat and sugar.

review/text: This is a very nice nutbar to have on hand for those rushed days, as this and a cuppa tea will see you through a missed lunch. They used to be 7 g of protein and the bars were a tad bit larger, but they kept the same sized wrapper and shrank the contents, so it's now 6 g's. That notwithstanding, it's a great alternative for kids who might otherwise eat junk.

Okay, so they have 6 grams of sugar in them, but that is better than most snack bars or even yogurt.

review/summary: Great Idea, Poor Execution
review/text: I typically enjoy other Nature Valley products, like the peanut butter granola bars and sweet & salty nut bars. I thought I'd give these a whirl.<br /><br />They do have quite a bit of flavor, although I could do without the sunflower seeds. Also, I appreciate that Nature Valley is producing products that are gluten free, which can be hard to come by. But why do they have to be so hard and dry? They crumble very easily and are extremely messy; do not attempt to eat them in the car. Because of this even opening one package can be dangerous, as they are typically not whole once they've been shipped. They tend to crumble inside the package.<br /><br />I'd like to see Nature Valley improve upon these, because they do taste good and they are gluten free.

review/summary: Good product but wrong package
review/text: The Nature Valley bars are in general very good.  They are healthy crunchy and taste good.  However, I didn't see anywhere, but at Costco, the big package with 48 bars.  Since I am a Costco customer, the obvious solution would be to buy at Costco.  Unfortunately they only offer one type of bar on that package size, which is the peanuts with peanut butter.  I don't like much this type because the peanut butter makes it too sweet.  At Amazon, I can find most types, but why do they only sell a 6x6 package and not a 1x48?  They would be able to sell more, 48 versus 36 and the packaging would be cheaper.  In addition by buying in large volume, we wouldn't have to buy as often, which would translate into a shipping and handling savings as well. They could then pass some of that savings to us, the customer, making us happier.
