review/summary: House Blend- (Arabica Beans) Kirkland Signature 2LB bag
review/text: Coffee is smooth not overly robust like starbucks. On the bag, it says"store in airtight container".  I haven't done this at all.  I kept the beans in the bag and used a vacum seal on it to keep it fresh...and wahla!!  It stayed fresh for over 8mos and continues to make a fresh blend when grinding the beans.  I have used other gourmet coffee beans and I must say that this Kirkland Signature House Blend coffee is absolutely delicious.  Currently, my bag is getting very low.  Since I live less than 8 miles from Costco, I will go to Costco to purchase.

review/summary: Tasty but not caffeinated enough
review/text: This coffee is really, really delicious, quality-tasting and fresh, but it does NOT wake me up.  Doesn't seem to have much caffeine.  If I drink some in the afternoon before work, I notice no difference in energy.  I just found out today that there is actually more caffeine in light roast coffee, so I'm gonna get Starbucks Breakfast Blend.

review/text: I love Starbucks but I don't like paying the price for espresso from Starbucks. When I was looking around on Amazon and found these beans were brewed by Starbucks and made by Kirkland, me being a Cosco lover and a Starbucks lover I was sold! Verrry glad I decided to go with these beans! They taste like high quality espresso beans, I get compliments all the time when I make friends and family lattes. You can not go wrong! purchase these beans!

review/summary: BEWARE!
review/text: BEWARE!! As usual everything about the deal went great because of Amazon; prompt delivery, etc., etc. However, this coffee will expire in less then 3 months. So, clearly, this has been sitting around somewhere. I buy other Kirkland coffee's at my local Costco and they usually don't expire for 12 to 18 months. Unfortunately, the Kirkland Espresso hasn't made it to the East Coast (last year or so far this year), at least not at the Costco's around me, and I wanted to try it, since, even at this inflated price it's priced about the same as 2 pounds of Lavazza, etc.<br /><br />So, hopefully it will be fine when I open it, but don't buy this expecting to use it this winter!

review/summary: Excellent quality white peppercorns
review/text: I was told years ago by many of the chefs at whose restaurants I dined in France and Italy that the quality of the spices in Europe is much higher because of the demand for the higher quality; as a result, we apparently do not receive the grade A spices in the US.  I was impressed by the quality of the spices at Hediard, Fauchon, etc...until recently.<br /><br />Many of those same chefs use either a large amount of, or exclusively, white pepper in their cooking, which was very surprising, as I had tried many sources, usually finding a fetid/fecal aroma in the background (sometimes the foreground!) of much of the product that I had purchased.  I commented on this to the previous head of Spice Hunter, who said that the problem is in production.  The least expensive method is the soak the peppercorns in ponds to remove the outer covering; the ponds become stagnant and the stagnant (read: fetid) aroma becomes part of the peppercorns.  The more expensive method is to soak the peppercorns in running water, which overcomes that problem.<br /><br />There is no comment about the production of this product, but I would be amazed if it were not the latter.  The aroma is so very exciting, with floral and spicy tones, and not a hint in the least of the off-putting aromas of other sources, even such well-known sources as Penzeys.  My wife and I are very delighted with this product.

review/text: Living in a very isolated area gives me few options as to where I purchase items such as these peppercorns.  Of the several I have tried, the quality and freshness of these are by far the best.  I use white pepper in many of the dishes I make and having good quality peppercorns is a must.  I was extremely satisfied with these.  As to the cost, I have found that you pretty much get what you pay for.  Yes, the shipping is outrageous but it is outrageous for everything these days.  You can by a used .01 cent paper back book, and still end up paying almost four dollars.  The cost here is well worth the price.

review/text: I was unfamiliar on how much peppercorns I would get with a 1lbs bag. Holy cow, I have enough to last the rest of my life.<br /><br />The white peppercorns I got were exactly what I was expecting. I bought a white salt grinder for the white peppercorns. Now I have three grinders, salt, black, and white peppercorns.<br /><br />White pepper isn't as spicy as black pepper. Also if you bite into a white pepper crackle it wont burn like black pepper does.<br /><br />I love it on eggs. Also white peppered shrimp is amazing.

For the price of 8.99 plus 3.99 postage you get 16 oz. It came to the house in about 3 days and works great in my peppermill.

review/text: I received my white peppercorns today. I was very happy with them. They were sealed in an airtight plastic bag. And the shipping package was secure so as not to damage the products. When I opened the bag the smell of the peppercorns was amazing. They were all whole(none broken). I can't wait to cook with them. I use white pepper in potatoes,salads of any kind; just about anything you'd use regular pepper on. The white pepper adds a buttery taste to all foods.

review/summary: PEPPERCORNS FROM JR MUSHROOMS & SPECIALTIES ARE GREAT!
review/text: I ordered these white peppercorns from JR Mushrooms & Specialties via Amazon.com, and I have to say that these are the best white peppercorns I think I've ever had!  The amount you get (one pound) for the price completely blows local specialty shops and grocery markets right out of the water!  (Sorry local guys, but a rip-off is a rip-off, and frankly, JR's peppercorns are more fresh and flavorful!)  You won't regret shopping at JR's via Amazon.  The packaging is excellent, the delivery timeline is excellent, and the product is... well, I've already sung those praises above!  Oh, and a tip for you who order these, once the plastic bag is opened, just fill your pepper grinder(s), and put the remainder in a canning jar with a tight fitting lid, and store in a cool, dark place.  They stay fresh that way!!

review/summary: Good root beer
review/text: Ok, this stuff is not thick and chewy like the other reviewer posted. My husband likes root beer more than I do and he likes this brand. We very very rarely ever buy soda but when we do we buy this brand and Santa Cruz Organic as well. He usually chooses this root beer over all the other flavors. We only consume organic foods and so we do not care for chemical tastes or high-fructose corn syrup. If you are not used to organic and natural sodas than this may not be the right choice for you

review/text: Started buying Blue Sky organic for my husband. He wanted a soda without high fructose corn syrup in it. Tried the cola first and it took a few days to adjust to the taste but he said it was good. Then I bought the root beer and he fell in love with it. If you are older and remember the old A & W root beer joints this tastes just as good. He prefers it over the cola now. Thumbs up Hubby is happy :)

review/summary: Ignore the poor reviews
review/text: I don't know what some of the negative reviewers are used to drinking, I'm guessing major name brands with HFCS as the main ingredient.<br />We bought this at a local organic store, and loved it. We also love the New Century Cola by Blue Sky. It tastes like real root beer. It does not have a heavy licorice taste, nor does it taste like cough syrup. Maybe they reformulated the recipe since the negative reviews were posted. But I also think that if someone is used to commercial soda by major manufacturers, which tastes nothing like REAL root bear, cream soda or ginger ale, then they will not like this.<br />If you aren't sure about don't buy the 24 pack. Find it locally, try it, then buy it in bulk.

review/summary: Blue Sky Organic Root Beer is disgusting. It tastes like bitter cough medicine. Awful experience. DON'T BUY! WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!
review/text: Blue Sky Organic Root Beer is absolutely revolting, and tastes like cough medicine. A truly bad experience.<br />This beverage is beyond just awful, the taste and smell is so strange and bitter, that it is alarming! I was even wondering if I was having allergic reactions to it! It made me feel nauseas and sick to my stomach. And strangely, I wondered if it raised my blood pressure? I just read that too much licorice can do that.  Well, if that is the case, then there must be way too much licorice root in this stuff. So much licorice in fact, that the liquid is very thick (almost chewy) and dark brown in color. I felt excited for hours after drinking it. Whatever the nebulous "natural root beer flavor" is, it could very well be some type of rare herb that is dangerous to some people, like Ephedra or St. John's Wort for example. (Beware of potential drug interactions with unidentified herbs).<br />It was a surprise to drink this, because it doesn't taste like root beer to me at all. It tastes like crap. I could barely drink this stuff. I had to choke it down, and quite frankly, I felt like I was going to regurgitate it back up. I bought a whole 24 pack of it from Amazon before even testing it. A huge waste of money. I will never ever in my life by this product again, nor recommend it to anyone. What I do recommend though is:<br />A), never buy Blue sky Organic Root Beer.<br />B), Do some research first on root beer before buying it over the internet.<br />Subsequent to my purchase, I discovered several websites that rate the flavor of root beer on the internet, and Blue sky Organic Root Beer was at the bottom of every one. I have true "buyer's remorse" and regret after purchasing this product. I rate this product triple F-!!!

review/summary: A big hit with my picky girls
review/text: My cats love Weruva's Love Me Tender Pouch.  They are super picky and this one is a huge hit.  We also feed Pumpkin Lickin' Chicken and while they like it, they will leave bits of the chicken about.  The Love Me Tender is all gone, even if they aren't starving.  I've fed it to some foster cats who love it as well, but they seem to leave one particular bit on the plate consistently.<br /><br />It is made in Thailand - which shouldn't be a problem.  I was hesitant at first, I generally only buy my cat food from American produced sources, but I did my research and found that Weruva did their research and Thailand has very good protections to make sure your animals will get safe food - possibly it has more protections than the U.S.  I won't link here but do your research if you are concerned.<br /><br />Opening the packet is easy.  The food is kind of chunky with a lot of gravy, for those of you who have gravy loving cats.  I wish this was around when my cat with kidney failure needed food because I think it would have given me a nice way to get some calories and liquid down her.  Remember, if you are feeding only packets, they usually have fewer calories per ounce than a comparable pate style food.  I generally feed it as a "Please don't wake me up early asking for food" treat late at night so I'm happy with the lower calorie content.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this review 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is difficult to get every last bit of product out of the packet.  The food itself is a 5.  The packets have those folds at the bottom so they can stand upright and the food and goo get stuck in there.  I use a spoon to get the last bits out but I feel like I always leave a little in there.  It isn't cheap so I want to get every bit of yumminess out. I also would be open to buying bigger packets.

review/summary: Dark Chocolate & Ginger
review/text: Two of my favorite things, extra special together. The product itself is delicious and I love this shortbread combination. This was my second time to order this product so I was looking forward to receiving them. Unfortunately, I live in a very warm climate area and the packaging did not compensate for this, so the chocolate melted and much of it stuck to the shortbread package. I was very disappointed about this. Other items that I have ordered that might present a similar problem have been package with cold packs and insulation at no extra charge (recently ordered Cadbury Chocolate Eclairs). I rate the product very high but feel the supplier fell short.

review/summary: Not Best of Walkers
review/text: The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005V9ZB8Q">Walkers Shortbread Dark Chocolate, Ginger Royals, 4.4-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> arrived in time for dessert so I was very excited to immediately open the package and break out the cookies to serve with vanilla ice cream.  The chocolate had clearly been melted at some point, with a muted color, irregular coating, sticking to the packaging.  These cookies were very unsuccessful and a great disappointment. My Dad loved the two types of Walkers shortbread cookies I brought to him, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPQ18K">Walkers Shortbread Lemon Thins, 4.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GCVLVI">Walkers Shortbread Assorted, 8.8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, so these were much anticipated for a dark chocolate and ginger lover.  They were absolutely lousy and ended up in the trash.  The cookies were extremely chewy, sticking to the teeth, but I'm not sure if this is the nature of the cookies or simply the batch we received.  We opened each box, finding all cookies in the same condition -- messed up chocolate sticking to the package, cookies overtly sticky.  If I can find these in a b&m store, I'll update, but won't order online again. Trader Joe's triple ginger cookies have a better texture and taste so we'll have a piece of dark chocolate with those for the desired combination. I may try dipping those cookies in melted bittersweet chocolate, leaving an edge free for easy holding.

review/summary: Crunchy Tasty Light Snack!
review/text: Yesterday my friend shared with me a bag of this Pom-Raspberry snack from his 12-pack box. The bite-sized crunch is lightly sweet and delicious.  I was instantly hooked and got online to do a lot of research because I had a serious doubt about food products made in China. I really hoped this product would have a clean bill of health so I would feel comfortable buying it regularly.<br /><br />I should say that Mrs. May's website erased a big part of my concerns. First of all, most ingredients were grown in US and Canada. Only three ingredients are sourced from China (rice malt, sesame seeds, and sea salt).  This is important because chemical contamination of China's natural resources is so serious that I won't want to eat a lot of food products grown there without endorsement from very reliable inspection agencies. The company seems to have done a lot of work to make sure the manufacturing process would be safe from microbiological hazard as well.  They also use two 3rd party international inspection agencies.  That being said, I've learned from multiple sources that Chinese factories are known for staging for health inspections. So I cannot just rely on the company's own words.  However, what makes me more convinced is that Whole Foods is one of their buyers.  I think this is an important endorsement for the product.  It makes me feel a lot more comfortable about making the purchase myself.  With the overall food safety concerns removed, I will give this product 4.5 stars.<br /><br />A good reference is Mrs. May's website FAQ on general production.  Since Amazon does not allow pasting of the link here, you can just google the website and check it out.

review/summary: "Fresh Mixers" to "Lunch Express" Not Good For Consumers
review/text: Very disappointed with the direction Healthy Choice has taken with all of its former "Fresh Mixers" line, especially the ones that contain chicken.  I am changing my rating on all of these products from 5 stars to 3 stars.  With the switch to "Lunch Express," apparently they decided to lower their production costs and make more on each unit.  First, they removed the handy green plastic strainer -- consumers are now supposed to be able to judge the exact amount of water that can be absorbed by the pasta or rice, aided by a lower water line in the container.  Second, in case you haven't read the fine print on the sauce containers, they have replaced the nice large chunks of white chicken meat with smaller, diced pieces of dark chicken meat.  I saved a few of the old green plastic strainers and they still fit the newer containers.  The convenience, taste and portioning are still attractive, so I'm continuing my subscription for now -- which is probably what Healthy Choice is counting on -- but just wanted to state my disappointment over yet another company placing greed over customer satisfaction.

I've actually enjoyed most Healthy Choice meals that I have experienced in the past, but I knew there was something wrong with this product. If you look at the reviews for the line of Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers, this one in particular scores way lower than the rest. I doubt that I will be trying any of the other fresh mixers unless I get them for free, like I did with this one, but I just had to find a place on-line to express how awful it tastes. I hate to throw away food, but this was simply inedible. My stomache and head were both hurting after just a few bites. My body was completey rejecting this garbage from the time I started eating it. I hope that Healthy Choice contacts me to offer me a job as a taste-tester, because I would never let any food-maker release this product with confidence. Stay away from this product.

review/text: I think some reviewers must have got into a bad batch, or maybe did not read the directions.  I found this quite easy to prepare (fill water to the fill line, clearly marked, and microwave for 3 minutes 30 seconds).  The topping should be heated for no more than 30 seconds.  I found that the flavor was very good.  It will not compare with good Chinese take out, but is OK for a quick lunch if you don't have time to go out.  It is listed as having 13 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber.  It has 600 mg of sodium which is somewhat lower than competing brands.  Overall, this is the best brand that I have found.  I usually add something like a fresh apple after the microwave meal.<br /><br />For those worried about the environment, the steamer tray (with lid) can be saved and reused for preparing instant rice or other meals at home.<br /><br />An alternative meal is the Healthy Choice Sweet and Sour Chicken which I have also tried.

review/summary: What little flavor is in this dish is not great
review/text: I'm not sure what the flavor people over at Healthy Choice are up to, but this one sure doesn't taste like teriyaki.  Really, it doesn't taste like anything at all.  Bland, bland, bland.  When you're dealing with rice as the main base of the dish, it helps to have some bold flavor to add some zing--not happening here.  The water chestnuts seem out of place and even though they provide some crunch (which I wasn't expecting, and isn't listed on the package), they add no flavor--actually it seems as though they're just bitter.<br /><br />I couldn't recommend this dish any less.  I will not be buying this one again!

review/summary: Mushy. Not a fan of this one.
review/text: Even though I followed the directions to a "t", my lunch was a bit saucy and mushy because of the extra liquid.  The taste was fair.  It did the job and kept me full for 4 hours. I liked that it didn't require draining. I also like that I can reuse the container. Not a fan of the price per serving. However, in a pinch...it's worth it to have a semi-healthy lunch that I can make in my office.<br /><br />I usually don't eat much sodium and this has way more than I would normally eat. I was impressed at how many grams of protein are in this though. That is what sold it. Next time though, I'll probably opt for a little tuna fish lunch kit instead.<br /><br />I like the idea of being able to buy something semi-healthy at a 24-hour drugstore. This flavor is not for me though.

review/summary: I was feeling nostalgic
review/text: On a nostalgic whim, I wanted to see if my favorite lollipops from my childhood in the mid-70's were on Amazon.  The answer was: of course they are!  Unfortunately they're not quite as I remembered, in look or taste.  Not as much sour to contrast with the sweet, which was was the main thing I really liked about them (hey, I was a weird kid.)  Granted my tastebuds were much younger and more sensitive then, so maybe it's just me.  Different packaging, too.  I remember an opaque, colorful, square wrapper that was just "twisted" on, instead of the clear, sealed, somewhat less tamper proof plastic.  In fact I have a heck of a time opening them, but at least I won't be inhaling the whole box anytime soon.  Sadly, the wrapper may just be a sign of the times. All in all it's still a good product but I probably wouldn't buy this again.

review/summary: We LOVE these crackers!
review/text: These are the greatest crackers, either alone, or with a slice of cheese, or with a dip.  There's just enough wasabi to spice up what could otherwise be a dull-tasting rice cracker.  Yes, we like some of the other Ka-Me flavors OK, especially the black sesame <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YHMWS2">Ka-me Rice Crunch Cracker Black Sesame And Soy Sauce, 3.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> and the seaweed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPMP36">Ka-Me Rice Crunch, Seaweed, 3.5-Ounce Units (Pack of 12)</a>.  But these wasabi ones are our favorites!<br /><br />We can buy these in the New York area;  in Michigan, we can get some other Ka-Me flavors but not wasabi;  and in Southern California we can't find Ka-Me crackers at all!  Go figger.  So it's great to have Amazon supply our "cracker fix" when we travel to the many places where these crackers seem to be extinct.<br /><br />By the way, they are also gluten-free, if you care about that.  Some folks think avoiding gluten, even if you're not actually allergic to it, can help weight control.  I look at it a different way - these crackers are only 7 calories each, and satisfying far beyond their calories - so they're sort of a diet food.

review/text: Maybe I am the only one, but I give my dogs pig ears to keep them occupied for a while. It takes both of them a good 5-10 minutes to eat one. But I know they aren't the healthiest thing on the planet, so when these better than ears came out, of course I tried them. Both of my dogs love them, but they can eat one in about 30 seconds, defeating the purpose of a chew type treat. For the price, I'd rather just buy them regular dog biscuits that are eaten in the same amount of time. That being said, the Amazon price is MUCH cheaper than any in store local price I've seen. Maybe these are better for small dogs that can't devour them so quickly, but my 70 pounders eat them like they are a regular old dog biscuit.

review/summary: Pretty Good for the Price
review/text: My two dogs both love pigs ears but I rarely buy them because they can be expensive and (I'm not sure if it is true or not) I've heard that some pigs ears are preserved with formaldehyde.  I decided to try to find a nice alternative to pigs ears and I came across Better Than Ears. The price was fantastic and I ordered a package of them right away.<br /><br />One thing I thought was great about the Better Than Ears was that it is a very clean and mess-free treat, it also has a nice aroma that my younger dog went wild for.  My older dog is a bit more picky about treats and she wasn't too impressed by the Better Than Ear that I gave her.  She just guarded it for a long while before she ultimately decided to eat it.<br /><br />The one thing that I am docking a star for on this product is that it doesn't last nearly as long as a real pig's ear.  The material is very soft and easily eaten and I was hoping for a treat that takes a little while longer for my dogs to eat, in the way that natural pigs ears do.  I've been freezing my Better Than Ears, which makes them a little tougher and last a little longer, but not by much.

review/text: I first found these about two years ago at Sam's Club, and being that I had two dogs that loved pigs ears I was interested.  My elder dog (now passed away) was getting up in the years and having a hard time with the regular pig ears and had lost all interest.  I got these, and she loved them.  She had a few teeth pulled but still could tear these up.  My younger, bigger dog loves them too.<br /><br />And I'll tell you this too.  My hubby forgets to close the bag properly (or simply doesn't notice, you be the judge!), and these things do stay soft for a few days (nay a week or so) even if you don't get it closed quite right.<br /><br />They don't last too long in this house, but if you want a good treat for your doggies give these a go.  Good sized bag for the price.

review/summary: Did anyone else's dogs get sick after eating this treat?
review/text: I am writing this review to see if anyone else's dogs have gotten sick after eating this treat.  Please be aware, right away, that I am not 100% positive that this treat was the cause of my dog becoming seriously ill, but I did not introduce anything new into his diet before he became so ill, I thought we would lose him.  After purchasing for a friend, and soon after giving my 10-year-old dachshund at his "free sample" from Kmart online on a Saturday morning a few weeks ago, and by Saturday night, he became violently ill.  My vet kept asking if I gave him anything different, and this treat was the only thing I gave him.  I gave this treat to my dog, because he LOVES to chew, and I guess I really lost my mind by not reading the ingredients before giving this to him.  I did believe the package when it said, "easily digestible," but I didn't read the other ingredients closely enough.<br /><br />I told my family member, who I gave the bag from Amazon, not to feed his dog this product until I hear if this has happened to others.  It is difficult not to associate what happened to my dog with this product now!<br /><br />I also have to wonder how something man-made can be safer and healthier than a pig ear, which is all natural?  I don't get it.<br /><br />Stick to high quality bully sticks and raw bones (NEVER cooked!) people!  I know after a hospitalization due to an enlarged spleen, pancreatitis, and dehydration, weeks of watching my dog suffer in pain, and seeing that look in his eyes as if he is going to leave us at any time, giving him five different meds, trips back and forth to the vet, and finally, an ultra sound to rule out a cancerous mass, I will!  One thousand dollars later, you can bet I will!  :(<br /><br />I am interested in hearing from others.  Wish I could put my email here, because I have to know if his illness was related to this product or just some very strange coincidence.

review/summary: My big & little dogs love these!!!
review/text: My dogs love these treats.  My little dogs "ask" for them at least once a day.  My big dogs (outdoor) love these too!  When I give them one I have to watch for my fingers!!!  This is the only treat they get so excited over.  They are always whole ears and I love the resealable bags.  If you haven't tried these for your dogs...I say "go for it!"

review/summary: My dog loved these treats
review/text: My dog loved these treats and I would purchase them again for her in the future.  The only problem is my dog would leave small pieces on the floor which isn't a problem with hardwood floors but with carpet could get annoying.

review/summary: Not as hard as I was expecting, but my guys love them!
review/text: I've never given my dogs real pig ears, so I don't know how tough they are, but I assume they are like rawhide.<br />Instead of gnawing on Better than Ears for a long time, they eat them pretty fast.<br />Not a problem, just not what I expected.<br />Man, do they go crazy over these things. But then again...who can resist bacon flavor?

review/summary: My Shih Tzu Loves Em and I don't have to feel guilty
review/text: Apparently yummy to my dog, and no guilt on me for feeding her pig ear.  Not to mention there's no leftover mess or smell.
