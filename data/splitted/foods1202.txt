review/summary: Great Bread--if they send the right one
review/text: This was a great Subscribe & Save product, but 3 times over the last year I've received the WHEAT bread mix instead of the white.  The wheat one never rises well in my bread maker and for us is a much less enjoyable loaf of bread.

review/summary: "A Slice of Heaven!"
review/text: I have to admit I was somewhat skeptical in deciding to purchase a bread mix brand that in all honesty I had never heard of.  However, after baking my first loaf in my automatic bread machine, I was shocked to find that the bread is as soft and light as a cloud! The outer crust maintains a perfect crispiness even though the inside remains airy days after baking, assuming your family hasn't gobbled it up by then! And the fresh bread aroma filling the house as it bakes is better than any of the plug-in air fresheners that we're all guilty of buying, especially when you add cinnamon to the mix! I've only tried the white mix thus far (best if adding spices to the baking cycles) so I can't address the other varieties but have to assume they're equally tasty and aromatic.  I have baked additional loaves for family and friends and they love it too! Looking forward to receiving future shipments of this "Slice of Heaven."

review/summary: Very easy bread machine mix
review/text: We used this to make a large loaf of white bread for dinner accompaniment.  The bread is very tasty and even the kids did not know how good it was for them.<br /><br />In disagreement with the other posts, I am happy to pay for a homemade loaf of bread just to get that fresh baked bread smell in our home!<br /><br />I only gave it 4 stars because I truly think for convenience, it should include the yeast packets even though that would make product dates difficult.

review/summary: It's white bread
review/text: We purchased this for a new breadmaker we received since you can't really buy breadmaker mixes in stores anymore. The price is great, they come in a six-pack that is not all that large and we find it convenient to be able to just quickly make a loaf of bread without having to pull out the recipe book and add lots of ingredients.  These make a 1 1/2 pound loaf if you're interested and it is pretty easy to make, just dump in the water, then the flour mix, some butter and the yeast...turn it on and wait! Overall, though, we found the taste to be pretty bland.  There is nothing special about the bread from this mix at all, but they have other flavors that are much tastier in my opinion for about the same price.  If you are looking for plain, white bread, then this will work out just fine.

review/summary: GOOD STUFF
review/text: this white bread mix tastes very good, I went though 3 loafs in one day. this mix worked great in my bread machine all the loafs turned out the way they should they had a nice color & the crust wasn't to hard or to soft & it had a light texture not heavy like some breads. I had the settings on the machine set on light crust & set on 2 pound loaf size. just remember to have the water at the right temp if the water is to cold the yeast would work and the bread will not rise. if the water is to hot it will kill the yeast. I find the best water temp is 100 to 105 I will be buying this mix again.

The crust has just the perfect amount of crunch. I ate a whole half loaf by myself in one day because it was just that delicious! Definately alot better than any store bought bread and I have to say bakery breads too.

review/text: My daughter was diagnosed as Gluten intolerant.  Finding a good bread that wasn't sticky was hard.  This bread is the best. We tried the plain bread mix and will now try the white bread mix.  My daughter loved the flavor, toasted or un-toasted.  She was so glad to be able to eat sandwiches again.  This is a great product and through Amazon the price is greatly reduced.  We will be ordering more of this.  Follow the directions exactly and you will get really good results.

review/text: While it makes good bread, I've been very disappointed with it due to every single box that I've opened to date (4 boxes so far) having its plastic packaging inside not sealed along the vertical seam. Apparently the adhesive used to seal the plastic bag containing the mix didn't hold, or if heat was used to seal the seam, that technique didn't work either.

review/summary: Can't stop eating it!
review/text: There's nothing like waking up at 8:30am to the smell of a fresh loaf of bread awaiting you.  I had my first loaf waiting for me this morning in the bread maker and, simply put, I couldn't stop eating it!  It's soft, chewy, the crust is thin, and it tastes delicious!<br /><br />The only other bread I've made is Krusteaz because that's all the local grocery store sells.  The biggest difference I've noticed is that Krusteaz bread has a really thick crust, the softness/texture of the bread doesn't last as long, and the bread seemed to shrivel up a bit after I took it out of the bread maker, cut it up, and let it cool down.  The freshness just didn't seem to last very long.<br /><br />The Hodgson Mill bread was perfect for my needs and it will the brand of choice for now on.  Looking forward to trying their other mixes.

review/summary: Oregon breadmaker
review/text: Hodgson Mill white bread mix is extremely easy to prepare in our Cuisinart 200 breadmaker.  I add a tablespoon of sweetner to enhance the flavor.  I'm going to experiment with splitting the dough into two pans for both shape and making it last longer.  It does stay fresh much longer than "store bought" bread.  We bake a loaf about every week to 10 days...there's just the two of us retirees.  A really great product!  We buy a carton of six from Amazon for additional savings...delivered promptly to our home.  Amazon was the only location we found this outstanding bread mix.  Thank you, "A"!

review/summary: Great Bread!
review/text: My family loves this white bread mix.  We used to buy a bread baked at Farmer Jack grocery store called 'Farmers Bread' & this is pretty close (Farmers bread is dense, soft & moist).  To achieve this you need to set the crust to light & pull the bread with about 12 minutes left on the cycle (still bakes through).  Also makes great french toast.

Also used it to make some Pecan Rolls and again liked<br />what happened.<br /><br />I made a mistake when placing my order and ended up with 12 sixteen ounce boxes so I'd best<br />develop a taste for this particular product.

review/summary: Perfect for Bread Machine
review/text: The first time I use a recipe in my bread machine, I always check to see if it needs adjusting. This one did not - it was perfect the very first time.<br /><br />It made a wonderful loaf of bread which raised very well and had a good texture. It was very moist and very light. I used the 1 1/2 pound setting on my 2 pound machine and set it on light crust. From the amount of raising I had, I suspect a 1 1/2 pound machine pan MIGHT just be a bit too small for this particular bread.<br /><br />What I love about it is the fact that even though it is white bread, it uses unbleached flour, making it healthier. In fact, the ingredients on this mix are all healthy choices ...<br /><br />Here's the ingredients:<br />Unbleached and enriched flour (wheat flour, malted barley flour, niacin, iron, thiamine, riboflavin, folic acid), sugar, vital wheat gluten, soy flour, salt, and Vitamin C. The enclosed yeast is "Fast-Rise" yeast.<br /><br />I not only would recommend this to a friend, but have already sent some to my daughter.

I tried mixing it is the machine, and mixing it by hand and cooking it in my machine and I get the same results.  I have not tried making it in the oven which is another option.

review/summary: Orderd White but Received Rye
review/text: The title says it all!  The outside of the box was marked white but when it was finally opened there was rye inside.  I bought a bread machine and the Hodgson's in July but did not use them until I moved in December.  Now I'm stuck with bread mixes I won't use.  Let this warn everyone to look inside a shipping box even if it is marked as the item you ordered.

review/summary: garden time packaging
review/text: In response to the previous review -- I've bought bulk Garden Time pasta from other stores and it arrives exactly the same -- a cardboard box lined with a plastic bag and all of the pasta in the plastic bag with no separate packaging.  It's one of the things I like about buying the pasta in bulk -- you don't have all that wasted plastic packaging.  I've been buying their bulk pasta for about 4 years and it's always been of great quality with no problems.  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Dated Product, Questionable Packaging
review/text: I ordered this assuming it would be factory packaged and labeled, or at least arrive in an airtight container. Instead, I literally received a giant, plain brown Amazon box filled with loose Rigatoni, with no labeling, organic certification seal or any indication of its origin (how I do I really know it's Garden Time or even organic?), and nothing between it and the cardboard other than packaging tape, other than a thin bag that resembles a trash can liner. (Mine arrived badly ripped up; with half the pasta in the bag, half out.)<br /><br />All in all, very odd, and unsettling. Even more worrying is the lone mark on the box was a stamp that stated it had been "packaged on 3/3/10" ... That's almost TWO YEARS before I ordered and received it. And, again, NOT in airtight packaging. Some of the pasta pieces literally looked dirty/dusty. Disgusting! Makes me deeply concerned about any and all food items I've purchased through Amazon.

review/summary: A wee bit mild
review/text: I am a FULL-ON tea drinker.  I drink green tea and black tea all day long and when it comes to my breakfast tea, it HAS to be a one-two punch or I'll revert back to my bad coffee habit.  I quit about a year ago but I do still ache for that incomparable aroma that only coffee can give!!  I am having a pretty good go of my Twinings Breakfast Tea and TAZO's Awake still does it for me but I'm always on the look-out for a stronger breakfast tea and TAYLOR's is NOT IT!  I wan't the equivalent of starbucks for my black tea so sometimes I double-up on the tea bags.  I could have dumped the entire box of Taylor's in my cup and it still would have been too meek and mild for me.  So, if you enjoy a cup of flavored water with a tinge of black food coloring, this is just the tea for you :)

review/summary: Not quite sure..
review/text: This rice had a definite earthy flavor, but it also had a slightly musty undertone, and a slight bitterness. I rinsed it well before cooking.  The color was nowhere near ruby, but it was more of a medium dark brown with a reddish or slightly purple blush.  I'll eat it, but I won't buy it again. It's too expensive and not special enough to justify the cost.  I much prefer Lotus Foods Forbidden rice.

review/summary: A BIT OF FUN NOT A TON!
review/text: Thank God, I had the package delivered directly to my home before handing it over as a gift. The package is a wonderful idea; However, I was slightly disappointed in the presentation and the lack of items used. This gift is a bit of fun not a ton of fun nor a pound of candy! I was underwhelmed with how little of product received for the cost paid. The excitment of opening the package was taken down a notch or two by the tacky paper used and the poor presentation of the items within. The chocolate seemed old and a lot of the candies were unidentifiable due to perhaps it being from the East Coast rather the West. I strongly suggest having the gift box delivered to you before giving. This will enable you to locate and fill the box completely with more nostalgia goodies unlike what the company claims to be included. It was a blast reminising on the past! Now, my only hope is that this gift box brings the receiver the same joy I got after the box was completed with more candy and festive decorations purchased from Target and the Dollar Store around town. Overall, this is a fun gift that lacks charm due to it's presentation and lack of candy! Eat responsibly!

review/text: I got this box for my wife's 41st birthday.  The top of the box is stamped "Do not open unless you were a child of the '70s."  This was a nice preview of what was inside.<br /><br />She was thrilled with the gift, and we spent an enjoyable half hour or so going through the contents and sharing stories with our kids about all the different kinds of candy inside.<br /><br />She was so happy that she insisted that we bring the box to her birthday dinner with 3 other couples so she could show them what she got.  All of the candy inside is fresh, and there is a LOT of it.  My favorite is the candy cigarettes, but there is so much that we are constantly discovering new items.<br /><br />In short, this is highly recommended as a gift for anyone.

review/text: I got the 70's box for may dad, who was born in the 60's but grew up in the 70's. I wasn't there when he got the box, but he called me right after. He was shocked that I even found something like this and was really happy with it. After later talking to my mom, she said he wouldn't stop talking about it and almost every piece was a trip down memory lane for him. She also mentioned that a lot of the items included in the box were very hard to find now a days, such as the candy cigarettes. But there were a few items you still see on shelves. I asked if any was stale, after reading the reviews on here...but they both said everything they ate was all in good, fresh condition. This is obviously only really good for a one time gift. The shipping price did bump this up to over $40 and almost made me not get it, but at the end of the day it was worth it.

You can't ask for much better than that from a long distance gift! They all found favorites and something for everyone in the box ~ none of the candy was stale or inedible. We used our Amazon Prime for the shipping & were able to send it next day for only $3.99 - that is a total bargain! I'll do this one again.

But when he called to thank me, he said that it was really awesome and he and everyone who saw it thought it was really great.  A lot of the stuff in there is still easily found today, but there were some harder-to-find nostalgic items in there as well.  But I guess it isn't realistic to think that we might find 70's candy in there that has since been discontinued, right?  ....so no one is really lamenting that aspect. Also, no one mentioned anything about the freshness (or lack thereof) of the candy, so I'm assuming that everything was fresh.  The Amazon price, even with shipping, was a lot better than the price charged when you order direct through the Hometown Favorites website, FYI.  I would definitely order again.

Comments were "what a fun gift, we spent all evening going through the box, our friends shared memories connected to some of the candiew, it was our favorite gift..." and many more.  I will use it again as a gift for other children and relatives.

review/summary: Wow, Candy Cigarettes!
review/text: I got this for my mom on Mother's Day, and she loved it.  They sure made some neat candy back then; a wide assortment of candies and bubble gum.  Check out the candy in the "sack of gold."  My delivery also arrived earlier than the estimated time, which is always a plus.

review/summary: Childhood memories re-lived!
review/text: Without giving away too much information on my advancement in years, I may say that I was a child of the 70's and recall with great fondness and slight nausea the intemperate consumption of many of the candies contained within this gift basket.  At almost five pounds, this basket not only represents a good deal, but also the potential for hyperglycemic diabetic coma for the unaware and foolish.  Of course, most of those who would actually be nostalgic for 70's candy would be in their thirties and forties, and thus have sense enough to not indulge to the point of fatality.<br /><br />As I gleefully pulled out the contents of this basket I was struck by how many of these candies were either metaphors or candy copies of nonpharmaceutical and, in many cases, highly addictive and illegal drugs.  The most obvious examples are the cigarette candies.  Since when was cigarette smoking considered exemplary behavior to be modeled in candy form to encourage impressionable youngsters?  Granted, they may be novelty candies and claim innocent fun, but I'm sure the Surgeon General would not be overly pleased at the kid-targeted promotion of a habit that increases both mortality and morbidity for millions and incurs health care costs in the billions.  But that's not the worst of it.  Can anyone claim that candy buttons are anything other than practice in the consumption of LSD blotter paper?  Pixy Stix are long tubes filled with pixy dust, which in actuality is flavored sugar but metaphorically represents angel dust or PCP.  Like PCP, pixy dust can be sprinkled on other confections to enhance their effects.  Wax fangs are just softer versions of real fangs, and real fangs are used to pierce skin, just like hypodermic needles.  Likewise, licorice pipes are only one step away from both marijuana and crack pipes.<br /><br />Looking back at the candies of my youth I began to wonder of a possible conspiracy between confectioners and drug pushers (especially the tobacco companies).  I seem to recall a shredded bubblegum product called "Big League Chew" and a cooked extract from unripe poppy seed pods called "Opium Den Smoke"--more evidence of a possible conspiracy and the perfect opportunity for the FBI to step in and apply the RICO statutes to bust this putative criminal collusion wide open.

review/summary: no red dye
review/text: I ordered this product, as I had ordered the 3x32oz bags of the same product, which were excellent.  When the item was delivered I was surprised to find it was dyed red.  My first thought was I made a mistake and "oh well, eat up and enjoy", but the mistake wasn't mine.  I have eaten one bag so far, they do not have a great taste and the dye,...... the dye is unbelievable.  It stains metal bowls and Formica counter tops.  I have shelled them with plastic gloves, to have the gloves tear,they stain my hands my mouth.  I tried washing the dye off, to find I stained the sink and bowls and hand and counter.  I probably should have sent the remaining 5 bags back, but did not, thinking maybe in months to come the dye will be less of a problem, just don't know why a wonderful product was dyed.  I have and will order more of the natural 3x32 oz bags, but if a mistake is made again and I get red dyed I will return the order.

review/text: These were great pistachios, and the ones I got weren't dyed red.  There were very, very few unopened or impossible to open pistachios in each bag.  The nuts were fresh and not overwhelmingly salty.<br /><br />I was able to give a bag to 5 different family members for Christmas and everyone loved them.  I kept a bag for myself that I unfortunately had to share.<br /><br />Great price and a great product.  I hope it becomes available again really soon.

review/text: I've ordered Greenies two times now and both expire within a week of receiving them. I sent the first one back and won't see my money for 4-6 weeks. Guess I have to do the same yet again. Spend the extra dollar at the grocery store to be sure they aren't going to expire before you can use them. I don't plan to feed my one dog 30 greenies before they expire on the 4th.

review/summary: poor quality
review/text: The packaging was intact and all but when I opened the box I found that the greenies were stuck together and wouldn't break apart (even when I tried smashing them against the concrete). At some point they must have been moist that they had become so cemented together.  It is a struggle trying to pull one at a time out of the bag and they break apart. Not exactly what I wanted.

review/summary: Perfect treat for my pup
review/text: I have a 12lb mutt that i give one greenie roughly every day.  He loves the fact that he is getting a special treat, and i love the fact that it is good for him and helps fight bad breath.  I have heard some people complain that they think Greenies upset their dog's stomach, but i have not had that problem with my guy at all.<br /><br />I highly recommend that you order Greenies from Amazon because of price.  They can be a little expensive so i have shopped around and found them to be A LOT cheaper to buy from one of the sellers on this site instead of getting them from PetCo or PetSmart.

review/summary: Doggie Crack
review/text: I bought a single Greenies Tennie for my puppy, just to see if she likes it. Surprisingly enough, she loves it. At first she just licks it curiously, then she started to grab it and take it to a corner and start licking and chewing on it. It keeps her busy for a long time. It's good for her teeth and make her have a better chewing habbit than chewing table legs and my fingers. I went out to my local pet stores to get this big pack. They price is actually the same as Amazon, I wish amazon would have this product for cheaper though.<br />But if you want your dog to be busy, help them to have better teeth, curing chewing habbit and ease seperation anxiety, you need to give this a try.<br /><br />But of course you need to becareful choosing the right size. If the treat is too small, when they woof it down, they might get chocked. The teenie is right size for my Mini American Eskimo puppy because she is really small now. When she is older I will switch to a size bigger.

review/text: I believe Greenies to be an excellent product. It tastes good and is good for my dogs. However, these large ones and the petite ones I ordered were soft and seemed old. I did not send them back. They apparently still tasted good to my 4 canines, but as far as a dental aid, they were just too soft and spongy.

review/summary: Great way to prevent "dog breath"
review/text: Within days of starting a routine of one petite Greenie each day (my dog is 20 pounds), dog breath is gone.  It did not upset his GI tract, and he loves the taste.  The price is much more reasonable if you buy a Mega Treat Pak from a vendor online compared to a smaller amount in a pet store, although a trial with the individually wrapped ones is a good way to start out.  They arrive in slide-zipper lock bags, which helps to keep them fresh.  I recommend this product highly.

I still supervise them when they chew their greenies and I feel safer knowing the chew is fully digestable and healthy for them.  I wish they were not so pricey, or that my pups didn't like them so much; but they are and my pups DO like them!

review/summary: Tartar Reducing Dog Treat
review/text: One of my favorite aisles in the grocery store is the pet aisle. Shopping for healthy treats for my pets is something I do almost every trip to the store.<br /><br />Recently I've been giving these healthier treats to my Shih-Tzu puppy. He takes off with them, usually to his bed where he can relish them all by himself. And he does relish them.<br /><br />When I sniffed one, they smell minty and meaty at the same time. I worried at first that he might get confused by the smell and not like them. I was wrong, he loves them!<br /><br />They help scrape off tartar build up too. So why not make fewer vet appointments for teeth cleaning?<br /><br />I recommend this nutritious treat highly.
