review/text: When I was advised to not take in any caffeine at all, I thought I'd die.  But in order to get rid of migraines, I would have tried anything.  I'm glad I did!  With the help of this tea as a part of my morning routine, I am doing GREAT!  I take the hot tea and pour it over a glass of ice.... YUM! What a nice pick me up!

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I have seen other reviews that say that this tea is really strong. For me, the flavor that stands out the most is cinnamon, however, I put quite a bit of honey in my teas. Being from the south, I'm used to pretty sweet tea. I can only say, that I wish I had started drinking this sooner. From what I have read, because of the Dong Quai in it, it is really not good to drink if you are trying to conceive. Seriously though, delicious. It reminds me of Christmas or Thanksgiving.

The two cases I purchased arrived chewy and clumped together.  They probably cooked during shipping and are not a "Raw Food" and not as "Nutritious" anymore.  Two of the bags were more bits and powdered fruit clumps than chucks of fruit and one was opened.  Amazon.com does not accept grocery returns.  It was a waste of $40.

review/text: I like this snack, though it is not without its negatives. First, it is expensive... but then again it is suppose to be healthy, so that's a plus that makes up for some of the expense. Also, it seems like a good snack for kids. However, sometimes there is an unpleasant flavor with the "Tropical Fruit" flavor. It is not pleasant when you get a bad piece of dried fruit in your mouth. I also tried the "Organic Strawberries" and like those better, probably giving them a 4 out of 5. The strawberries are good to eat with dark chocolate.

review/summary: don't buy for travels
review/text: I really wanted these to work for travels where I pack all my own food.  However, they are a decidedly poor alternative for travels, since most of the outer coating of the fruit turns into very messy powder.  The strawberry flavor is slightly less of an ordeal in that regards but still messy.  They are probably good for you if you want a stowaway fruit you can use when you haven't gotten to the store for awhile or want it out of season to sprinkle into something, but otherwise the price and messiness are both much too prohibitive.  I've bumped it up from two stars to three, however, after considering how they keep the enzymes intact and don't add sulfites.

review/text: These taste wonderful.  They are a little powdery, which is to be expected since they are freeze dried, so don't breathe in as you're eating.  Fresh blueberries are better, but these are very good.  I saw a few reviews that mentioned everything arriving as powder, but mine arrived in good shape.<br /><br />One thing I really like is that the only ingredient is blueberries.  There's no sulfur (which I'm allergic to) or corn syrup.  These are good in cereal and as a snack, though you might want to have some water on hand in case you breathe in some blueberry dust.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Best of the freeze dried, and my whole families favorite flavor
review/text: I started buying these as a "to go" snack for my baby/toddler who is allergic to a lot of stuff.  He loved fresh mangos so I selected this flavor.  Now he loves these so much, he seems to object to fresh mangos.  Now the whole family loves them.  We buy all the other flavors (except blueberries, tried them once -- they'd be okay for baking with, but not a great snack).  I've tried 2 other brands of freeze dried foods and I'd say Crunchies brand is the best -- size of pieces, texture/look of pieces, flavor.  Only improvement would be for it to come in a large cannister size too, and even the 1.5 ounce would be better if it was in a hard sided container like "Just ___________" brand (also okay, but more shrivled up, less like airy).<br /><br />Good Job Crunchies!

review/text: I was at Costco one fine Saturday afternoon when they were handing out samples of the Mixed Fruit Crunchies. I was immediately struck by how flavorful they are! Crunchy, and crisp, not leathery like most dried fruit. On their own they are a fun snack for kids and adults alike. I've also discovered that they make great flavoring agents for frostings, truffles, cakes, etc. I used a mortar and pestle to turn, for example, the strawberry Crunchies into a powder, then used that for the Triple Berry tea loaves and the Strawberries & Cream truffles I made during the holidays. The intense, refreshing, true fruit flavor is what I love about these. And the crunch, but then I'm a texture person!<br />p.s. the other reviewer: It's the banana crunchies you think aren't good, I would bet money on it. My daughter doesn't like them either.

review/summary: Stale and Poorly Packaged - No Reply from Manufacturer
review/text: I've bought these pineapple Crunchies in my local grocery store and they were good (though very expensive at about 6 bucks per serving). So when I ordered the six-pack of them here, I expected them to taste just as good. That was not the case at all. The outside of each package was sticky but that didnt bother me much. What bothered me is that the actual product itself was stale. Each piece (in 4 of the 6 bags I opened) was rubbery. Chewing the Crunchies only compressed it into a solid wad of what then seemed like hard plastic. The result was something that simply could not be broken up and swallowed. I also noticed that the built-in ziplock seal didnt work on these bags. After 4 bags, I tossed out the rest and contacted the manufacturer via email (twice). I never received a reply. I think the Crunchies people are selling Amazon bad batches. Avoid these at all cost!

review/text: Crunchies Blueberries are my new favorite snack. Mine arrived whole and in good condition. There was some blueberry powder at the bottom of the bags, but this is only a problem if you love them as much as I do and insist on sifting through the powder to ensure you get every last blueberry. I haven't tried rehydrating them, as I like them crunchy, but my experience with other freeze-dried items is that they rehydrate well. Incidentally, freeze-dried blueberries are a lot cheaper than dried blueberries, but they retain almost all of their nutrients unlike regular dried fruit.

I was holding my 6 months old (who has so far refused all forms of baby food and has only agreed to try the gerber puffies) and he grabbed one off the table and shoved it in his mouth.  It melted in his mouth and he was hooked.  He ended up eating 7 pieces before I cut him off for fear of giving him too much of something he's never had before.  But they kept him very happy for a while.

review/summary: Feel Kinda Ripped Off
review/text: Because of the bulk price and the main image on amazon, I thought the packages would be larger, like a bag of Jerky. Turns out that the image you see is not the packaging that you get, the bags are shorter and smaller (see my customer image). At over $4 a bag ($25/6), I'd be better off buying freeze-dried fruit at the local nutrition shop. Plus the fruit pieces are fairly small; good for kids but I like bigger chunks.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I just received a box of the small bags of strawberry and one of the pineapple. The name is CRUNCHIES, but my fruit is anything but crunchy. It is soft and pliable instead of crunchy. I liked the fact that I could get the portion control bags and also that they are made with just the fruit and nothing added.  I had hoped that these would help me keep out of the potato chips, but they are too soft for that. I will use them but will not be purchasing them again. I have had good success with Bare Fruit Apple Chips, but only one flavor comes in the small lunchbox sized bags that I prefer. The Crunchies website said that if air gets to the fruit it will moisten it up and make it soft. I have to assume that the packaging is to blame as how else would air get into unopened bags?

review/summary: Strange chewy-crunchy texture
review/text: Ok, so I have never had freeze dried pineapple before, so I am not sure if they are "good" compared to other freeze dried pineapple. But I found them weird. I mean, they taste like pineapple, but they were not crispy-crunchy like freeze dried strawberries, corn, peaches, and other fruit I have had. The texture of these are not like anything I've had before. As first bite, they crunch a little. Then as your teeth sink in, they are kinda hard-chewy, like those hard caramels. I guess they are just not what I was expecting, based on my other experiences so I was disappointed.<br />I don't think they were damaged in shipment, as it wasn't melted together in one big clump. They were still all individual pineapple chunk pieces.

review/text: Usually I buy freeze dried pears from whole foods but it costs an arm and a leg so I was SUPER excited to see this available at a decent price.<br /><br />Disappointment doesn't even come close...The pears weren't crunchy in the slightest bit, more like stale and chewy in such a way that it brought about a slight "ick" factor. I was expecting the same quality as Whole Foods (my mistake) but when I opened the bag, it looked like someone had taken a pear slice and crumbled it like a paper ball and dried it.<br /><br />We got this to have healthy snacks on hand but no one in my house can get over that slight "ick" taste and no one will eat it. Whatta waste :(

They are not crunchy, by rather they are light and airy. The packages are small, but a great snack and there were twelve of them. That brings me to my recommendation for you to order two boxes, because I just put in an order for a box for my wife. She will be pleased.<br /><br />Also, try the other flavors, I love the pineapple. I was able to buy this set with a coupon that made them a real bargain.

There is some flavor, but not what I expected. Very costly per ounce,$3 for 1.5 oz. It may take8-10 lbs of fresh fruit to make 1 lb of crunchies, but for flavor, texture, and cost, I will definately buy 8-10 lbs. fruit. Sorry I am unable to return the other 5 bags.

review/summary: CRUNCHIES IS DISAPPOINTING
review/text: I've tried almost all low calorie freeze-dried pineapple snacks out there. This snack says it's made in the USA, while most others are imported.  One 1.5 ounce package has 150 calories, which makes it about average on the calorie scale.  "Crunchies" freeze-dried pineapple snacks are not chips, like other freeze-dried pineapple snacks.  "Crunchies" are chunks of freeze-dried pineapple shaped like canned pineapple chunks you buy at the store.  The consistency is very good and it is definitely crunchy.  But to me, the flavor was a little bit off.  I mean it didn't taste like natural pineapple.  The package states that the only ingredient is "pineapple," so I can't figure out why the taste is slightly off.  I opened a second package and tried it, but it was the same.  A third package was the same.  I will not be buying this product again.  If you are looking for a tasty freeze-dried pineapple snack, I recommend "Funky Monkey" or "Crunchy N Yummy" which are both sold by Amazon.

review/summary: you're lucky if you get all the fruits mentioned
review/text: besides purchasing this at the groceries, i ordered twice on Amazon hoping that this product would improve. there is an unequal amount of fruit distributed in each package. out of the six packages only one actually contained mangoes. also, there must literally be only 5 chips of bananas in each package and i have already gone through about 20 by now. the strawberry chips easily get pulverized so if you think you are missing them in your pack, they may already be turned into dust at the bottom.<br /><br />now why, oh why do i still buy them (at the grocery)? my toddler likes the banana chips and mangoes (we now buy the mangoes separately which is another hit and miss on quality). what doesn't get eaten by the little one gets thrown into my breakfast cereal or oatmeal so nothing goes to waste. so for that i'm giving it 3 stars.

review/summary: Unique mix of crunchy dried fruit
review/text: Unlike the usual 'leathery' dried fruit, these freeze dried fruits are crispy.  All have excellent flavor, and are great for diabetic meal plans.  Some of the fruit is very fragile, and becomes powdery- however, the majority keep their shape.  Excellent, healthy snack :)<br /><br />Update:  For Pears...  (my review of the mixed fruit came up for this, so have to add, not do an individual review)<br /><br />The pears are good- but not as crispy as the other flavors. There are only 20 calories per package, so fit into a diabetic meal plan quite nicely.  They also have a gram of fiber per package (good for a 20 calorie item).  The pear flavor isn't really strong 'pear', but they're good. I can see reordering them again.

review/summary: Awesome healthy snack!
review/text: I like these so much I enrolled in the Subscribe & Save over a year ago.  It is not the cheapest snack, but I save money by ordering these in bulk through Amazon rather than buying these from my local grocery store.  There are no artificial ingredients or added sugars; this is just fruit.  Yet, this is a great portable snack that will not go bad sitting in your car, or your child's backpack.  I usually keep a supply in my car to satisfy my huger while driving home from work.<br /><br />I completely disagree with the serving size listed on the package.  It claims five servings per bag.  But, if you're eating these as a snack, you'll only get one serving out of a package, maybe two servings if it's for a child.  If you're using this on top of cereal or yogurt, then of course it will last much longer.  When the bag is empty, you'll find a bunch of fruit powder left at the bottom.  Don't throw it away, this makes a great topping for yogurt.<br /><br />This snack is not for everyone.  My kids and I love them, but my husband can't stand them.  These are not the consistency of other dried fruits, like raisins.  These are crunchy, just as the name implies.  You can happily crunch them like potato chips, or to make them last longer, eat one at a time, and let them slowly dissolve in your mouth, like a sugar cube.  Sweet without the guilt.

However, still good and still worth purchasing as a healthy snack.

review/summary: Freeze dried
review/text: I purchased these because I was curious to what all the different fruits would taste freeze-dried.  I realized that I'm not such a big fan of it because of the sudden transition from crunch to mush in the mouth.  I would rather have actual fruit that retain the crunchiness for me to enjoy as a snack.  However, I think these would be really good to mix into your morning cereal, both dry and with liquid, hot or cold.<br /><br />Half of these packages had a considerable amount of powder at the bottom...so I'm thinking I lost about 10% of the 1.5 oz of product.

review/summary: Tastes Like Toothpaste
review/text: OMG!  They invented a gum that tastes like toothpaste!  It's sweet, unlike toothpaste, but otherwise, that's what it tastes like.  I don't like the taste of toothpaste (but I do brush my teeth regularly), but if you like it, here's the gum for you.  One thing I can certainly give it points for, it really does freshen your breath!  Very strong minty flavor.  It's a definite plus when your breath is really bad.

review/summary: Would you drink Listerine?
review/text: Yesterday I saw a homeless woman taking a swig from a massive bottle of Listerine. She almost gagged from the horrible taste but she was after the alcohol so she didn't care.<br /><br />Well, today I popped a couple of these Eclipse Polar Ice gums in my mouth, and I just about threw up as the taste brought back the sight of the homeless woman drinking Listerine. I can't imagine how anyone would voluntarily wish to swallow that flavour.<br /><br />Vile stuff. Keep away.

review/summary: Cesar Canine Cusine (all flavors) 3.5 oz pkg
review/text: I started feeding this food (all flavors) to my senior Italian Grey when she stopped eating her dry food. I add 2oz of cooked rice to each feeding. She can't eat it fast enough.  I took a pkg to my vet and he looked up the analysis of it. He was surprised at the quality. He said it was excellent for a dog her age and that it was all right for me to continue feeding it to her. He had just completed a physical on her (fecal and blood work). Every area of the blood test was in the normal range. She's a happy, healthy dog. Before this I had to coax her to eat; Today, she demands to be fed and NOW!

review/summary: Only food my little dog will eat!!
review/text: Our little guy, who looks just like the one on the package!! loves this food.  He particularly likes these in the 'sauce'.  I have tried to switch him to less expensive canned foods over the past 3 years, and he just does not like them nearly as much and in many cases prefers to go hungry then eat Alpo or Purina cans.  I put this down on his little plate and it's gone in 2 minutes.<br />I don't know what the other lady is talking about-- I think she has this food mixed up with the Dog Whisperer's line -- mistake.  This is not his line at all.  Just a similar name.<br /><br />Get a subscription for this product and save some money.

review/summary: Whatever's In Them, My Dogs Love 'Em!
review/text: Cesar Canine Cuisine Varety Pack Food Review<br /><br />Grade: A<br /><br />I was questionable about buying these at first, seeing that I'd be paying a dollar for an incredibly small meal my miniture dobermans would surely eat up in a minute. So I took a chance and bought the 12 pack-which includes Filet Mignon and Porterhouse Steak flavors-and my dogs ate them up! Yes, they did eat them fairly quickly, but I found that mixing two of the dinners and a big bowl full of dry food will still be tasty enough for them. Do that, and you'll get more use out of these-dogs seem to like their flavor. So although they aren't that healthy for dogs everyday (I made sure to read the inredients on the back), they're perfect for a snack or to mix with dinner.

The only thing I don't like about the product, is that you have to feed 4 little packs a day per 10 lb dog. The box I have is a 24 pack so you have to have to buy a big box every week.<br /><br />Another thing I didn't like about this is there are a lot of by products in the food.

review/text: My now 6 year old Chihuahua ate Cesar dog food for quite a while and seemed to really like it. But I got so tired of picking out BIG blood vessels that I couldn't stand to feed it to her anymore. The listed ingredients didn't help either so I switched to a healthier brand of dog food. I just couldn't get over those blood vessels and it is quite pricey for such a little can, especially not having better ingredients.

First, the only thing one really has to do to sell dog food is make it so the dogs will eat it.  That the dog will eat it is no measure of the quality or benefit of the food.
