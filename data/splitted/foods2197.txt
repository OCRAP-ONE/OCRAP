review/summary: My favorite oatmeal squares flavor
review/text: So far, I have received two shipments of the chocolate chip oatmeal squares through Amazon's subscribe-n-save program.  The first shipment, the squares were very hard and almost tough to chew.  In the second shipment, received two months later, the squares were very soft.  I actually prefer the hard/tough to chew consistency, because it forces me to slow down when eating them.<br /><br />As to the flavor itself, it is predominately oatmeal.  The chocolate chips add a hint of sweetness, but do not carry a lot of flavor itself (as compared to, say, Nestle chocolate chips or a Hershey's kiss).

review/summary: Tastes good but..Contains products with MSG, unfortunately
review/text: I liked these and the ingredients and vitamins seemed good (even though a tad too sweet) but..everytime I'd eat one I'd become ill.  I couldn't figure out why until I researched the ingredients.  I'm moderately to severely allergic to MSG and it gets worse as I get older.  I kept reading the ingredients wondering if there was something in these affecting me and after a little internet research found that the "Maltodextrin, Brown Rice Syrup, Natural Flavorings, Whey Protein Isolate and possibly a few other ingredients contain varying amounts of MSG.  The combination of all these was enough to make me sick.  I'll have to stick to snacks without such a high combination as other snacks haven't had such an effect on me. They did taste good, however... :(

review/summary: Just OK....
review/text: I bought these after reading all the reviews on Amazon.com and they sounded really good and were offered for a great price.  I just tried my first one and it was OK.  First impression is that they are soft and chewy (a plus) but the flavor is so-so.  I honestly do not taste any of the chocolate chips although I can feel them but the overall flavor is kind of, hard to explain except to say, perfumy. It's hard to describe but its not an oatmeal flavor like an oatmeal cookie.  It's that artificial sweet, kinda malty flavor I find in many processed energy bars.  I was looking for a substitute for the oatmeal/flax bars that I buy at Costco and these are not it.  I am eating my second one as I type and again, the first flavor that pops in my mind is something in the order of perfumy but not oaty or chocolaty. Overall the Costco ones (round tub) are a 5 star in flavor compared to these bars.  Big let down....

review/summary: Bars are not that good
review/text: I bought these bars thinking they would be soft and chewy but they are more on the hard end. I would rather eat a power bar than eat these again. Im a really big health nut but some thing about these just doesnt taste right. Maybe I got a bad batch but if your looking for a snack these are a hit or miss. Overall I wouldnt buy them again unless I knew my batch was bad / old then I would want to try them again.

review/text: Normally I love these chocolate chip oatmeal bars and would give them 5 stars.  They're chewy and delicious and a healthy snack compared to lots of other snack choices.  The reason I only gave 3 Stars is because I ordered these on 7/26/11 and the boxes that arrived say "Best By Jun 2011".  So in summary, they're a great product but you never know if you'll be getting a "fresh" box or not.

Unlike some of the mass-production pineapple shortcakes that use artificial flavoring, Tasselfield's pineapple shortcakes use real pineapples and it makes the whole world difference. You can even taste the fibers from pineapple.<br /><br />I opted for the traditional pineapple this time. I will be interested in trying out the Longan or mango variety next time.

review/text: We settled on these treats after looking for a heatlhier alternative to the ones found in the local pet stores; something natural and meat-free. It was a good change because she seems to love them more than what we were giving her before. The bag is mostly made up of dried slices and pieces of carrots, some smaller some larger, and not the long single strips as the bag image suggests. This is perfect though since the bag is plentiful and perfect for giving treats here and there. Great product, no guilt.

review/summary: Two Paws Up!
review/text: My two cats are, I admit, rather spoiled as far as food goes. I usually feed them Indigo Moon, Weruva and Tiki Cat, and as a consequence they eat a better quality diet than most people do. It's worth it though, everyone who meets them comments on how glossy their fur is. I decided we would give BFF a try as the ingredients list meets my standards and the price seemed right, and I must confess I really liked the label (yes I am that shallow) but I was a little apprehensive about how my two four footed food critics would react. It's probably because I indulge them so much but they are very picky eaters and will turn their backs on any wet food that doesn't please them.<br /><br />But I needn't have worried, they loved it! The Tuna Too Cool is a rich-looking, reddish pate with lots of jelly on top and my twosome were wolfing their portions down and got into a bit of a scuffle over the last couple of mouthfuls. They have no higher praise.

review/summary: They like it!
review/text: I learned recently that cats are not supposed to have GRAINS in their food. It causes them health problems, including weight problems. The first few days of trying this I couldn't decide if they were liking it or not. They had always eaten dry food. After a few days on this canned they really started to show that they were liking it. It is a little chunky, but the chunks are easily smoothed out - it's also better to add some warm water with this to make it a little soupy. If it has been refrigerated, let it get to room temperature. All 3 cats like this as well as the Tuna Too Cool and the one that has Shrimp and Chicken combined - but they didn't like salmon.

review/summary: Please understand what it means to go grain free.....
review/text: This product is a good product and really good health wise for your cats. If you are looking at this product you are probably interested in feeding your cats something better. I just wanted to address some of the negative reviews of this food - many of them by people who don't understand that all cat food is not the same. I took the time to switch my 8 year old street rescue Louie to grain-free food (tried many brands before I arrived at BFF), and here are some of my observations.<br /><br />Cost<br />All grain free foods costs more for the same reason that grass-fed antibiotic free, free range chicken costs more per lb than a chicken nugget. It's better for your cat! Anyone who has a cat that's on a farm - ever see it eating some of the corn or wheat that spills off of the truck? Never! That is because cats don't eat grains. In cheap cat foods these grains are used as fillers to round out the portions and are not of any nutritional value to the cat. When I went grain free my cat ate much, much less - thereby negating the price difference. I even tested it a couple of times - my 13 lb cat can eat 2 - 3 ounce cans of Fancy Feast in one sitting - but cannot eat a 3.3 ounce can of BFF in one sitting.<br /><br />Another point on cost. If you are the type to take your cat to the vet and take care of it when it is sick, then you save so much money and trouble with foods like this it is crazy. When you hear people talk about diabetic cats, food allergies and all the other assorted sicknesses our animals are getting - most of them come from food. Diabetic cats - did they continuously raid the cookie jar? All the money you think you will save (but are not actually saving) will go to the health care of your pet in later years. Its the same way McDonalds and Denny's don't have to absorb the cost of all the diabetics they helped create - the taxpayers pay for it through Medicare and higher insurance costs 30 or so years down the line (and sooner with all the young diabetics we are creating).<br /><br />Smell<br />Most grain free cat foods smell. EVO stank up the house horribly and I had to move the cat bowl from the kitchen. Minus all the fillers and grains - you are getting an all natural product that is better for your cat because nutrition of the cat is put first.<br /><br />Taste<br />Cat's are notoriously finicky. Most cat foods that have grains and other filler ingredients have to add heavy syrupy mixes to get the cats to eat them. They take corn, wheat, soy, barley and gods know what else, add some vitamins and then add a extremely strong tasty syrupy mix to get the cat to swallow it all. So cats fed this for a period of time get used to it the same way babies get used to sugars in their formula. Then, when you want to give the baby vegetables with no sugar added guess what? Baby rejects them - they want the sugar! Same happens with cats fed with cheap filler foods.<br /><br />Poop<br />When switching to grain free a cats habits and consistency may change. Their digestive system is learning how to digest what it was actually made for. Same thing happens to humans - look up the "Whole 30" and see what I mean.<br /><br />Switching to Grain Free<br />Its a process more involved than opening the can and plopping it down. Took me months. Google can help you do it but don't expect to just give this to your cat and have her dive right in thanking you for it. That may happen, but more likely than not you have to mix old and new foods until they are used to it.<br /><br />BFF, EVO, Taste of the Wild.... they are all good brands that will improve the health of your cat. I settled on BFF as my wet food because he loves it. I used to give him EVO wet food and he would eat it but he hated it. I still feed him EVO dry food because he likes it. I tried many brands and did not give up on grain-free food because I cared about my cat. I understood as a street cat for years he was used to eating whatever he could and it all was the cheapest, unhealthiest stuff available given to him by well meaning people. He has improved in every way (coat, activity level, temperament, litter habits, etc..) and now is a healthy and happy cat.

review/summary: Great grain free, high fiber, high moisture food!
review/text: My slightly aging cat has had horrible colitis in the last two years, and was defecating on the floor and my bed. The best solution I found was to switch to a grain free food, and offer more wet food than dry, so he will have more moisture in his bowels. I switched to Natural Care LDT, and it solved his problem...for about six months. After finding another steaming pile in my bed recently, and a few under my desk, I decided to try BFF, as my local pet store  just started carrying it. He is a picky feline, but he sucked the Tuna and pumpkin flavor down like a Hoover. One week later, happy cat, no more poop in my bed, which means happy girl. Great ingredients, and picky cat loves it!<br />Note: yes he saw the vet. The change in diet was the vets idea.

review/text: I just tried my two four footed food critics on BFF's Tuna & Veggies Valentine and it made a big hit with both of them. It's always a risk trying a new food on my two finicky cats, but I hoped they would like this one because they love parent company Weruva's Tuna & Vegetables <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70O2">Weruva Mediterranean Harvest Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 24)</a>. BFF's tuna & veggies is a bit different from Weruva's - it has red tuna instead of white and a slightly thicker consistency, though both are stew like and have visible chunks of veggies. And both have an ingredient list that meets my standards - no by products. My twosome snarfed up every last bit of tuna and veggies valentine that I gave them and they asked me for more - but they will have to wait until tonight for that!

review/text: I've recently switched my cats to all grain free food. (if you still feed your cats (or dogs!) with grain filled food, especially if you have had a problem with bladder or kidney stones, I implore you to look at the reviews and research of grain free food.) That being said, my ragdoll usually only eats dry food and my shorthair usually eats the wet food. Amazon delivered this to my doorstep today and I opened a can and fed it right away to see if they liked it. After taking a shower I came back out and it was ALL gone, and my ragdoll was finishing up what little was left. The cat food box says on the front that it was made in a human food facility, but I don't know much about cat food that isn't made in a human food facility. I still appreciate the fact that they are trying to say it is higher quality. I will probably be buying this brand from now on, I just wish Amazon Prime members got it in two days like usual, but it is shipped from pet food direct so :(.

review/summary: Energetic Cat!
review/text: I recently adopted a kitten just under a year old. At first we thought there was something wrong with her, she wouldn't do normal crazy kitten things. After reading about cat nutrition, I discovered what I had fed to my cats as a kid was completely backwards, as is most 'cat food' even today. I read about BFF and decided to let her try some. Now my cat doesn't rest all day, but is playful and as crazy as a kitten should be. Also of note, there is much more urine in her litter box each day, which is a good sign of how much water is in the food. She's also volunteering her presence more now, not just when she is hungry. I had to take a star off, not because of the product, but since Amazon doesn't let me order more than 2 packs per flavor. I'd give it 6 stars if I could 'subscribe' as you can with other types of food on Amazon.<br /><br />Also, I would recommend the 3oz cans if you have only one cat. You will have to feed him/her more throughout the day, but it can dry out if they don't finish it, which defeats some of the purpose besides being unappetizing to the cat.

review/summary: Really Good !!!
review/text: Awwww another winner from Weruva, i really like the brand and they made the BFF line with us in mind. It's a little cheaper than the actual Weruva brand cause its seafood based. Their seafood has the lowest mercury levels but still this isnt recomended for everyday use on your kitties, you're supposed to switch it around. I only give it to my babies 1 or 2-ice a week that's it. You should hear them begging when the can is popped open ha ha ha.

review/summary: Carrageenan ingredient NOT good !
review/text: If your cat has GI or stomach problems, be SURE to read the ingredients on the label as several of the BFF flavors contain Carrageenan which is not at all healthy for your cat (or people for that matter).  It causes GI problems and heartburn -- the very last thing a kitty needs.  It does NOT appear that Carrageenan is listed in the Amazon description, but if one checks the BFF website, you can find complete product ingredients.<br /><br />In particular, this BFF has the Carrageenan listed towards the top of the ingredient list, so more highly concentrated.<br /><br />My cat needs grain-free food for her IBD and I purchased a few cans of this BFF locally.  The "Carrageenan" on the label got me to sleuthing and discovered some food makers (pet and human) use this as a filler.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Just a heads up for folks ..!

review/summary: Absolute Life Saver!
review/text: My 14 year old kitty's mouth does not work so well anymore, and she has trouble eating most of the grain free wet foods, which tend to be too chunky or solid. This awesome wet food is full of jelly and broth as well as meat, and it's PERFECT for an old kitty's mouth. She has not eaten a full helping of cat food in YEARS, but the very first can of this stuff I set out for her was GONE almost instantly. She is usually constantly screaming for treats, but after having a full 3 ounce can of this, she is happy and scream free. I have never seen her take to a wet food so instantly and so completely. Yes, it smells like tuna...because it's made from tuna? It's pungent but she frickin' LOVES it. How nice to see my poor old girl eat every last bit of something. I am just so grateful I found this food! Will be ordering it on a regular basis. Thanks, BFF!

review/summary: This stuff is kitty crack
review/text: The BFF line is great; my cats adore it (to the point of occasionally going on food strike when I try to get them to eat other things), its fairly reasonably priced and aside from the mercury issues, it's a really healthy catfood lacking all the crud that's usually in commercially prepared foods (bad additives, grains, corn etc).<br /><br />This particular flavor (tuna and shrimp) is their favorite, but I also feed the tuna and pumpkin flavor which is a close second.  The only reason that I don't feed this 100% of the time, is because just like with humans, you have to be a little concerned about the amount of mercury in fish.  Nothing to do specifically with this brand - they do everything right.  It's just not the healthiest thing in the world to feed nothing but tuna - the mercury levels can build up and that isn't good.  So I alternate this with a chicken product.<br /><br />Otherwise - this is top notch catfood.

review/summary: Good price
review/text: My cat is used to eating Weruva and Tiki Cat, so I wasn't sure how he would take to this brand. This doesn't look at all like the previous two brands (which actually look like people food) whereas BFF brand looks like typical cat food. Lou isn't normally picky, but he doesn't eat this food quite as quickly as Tiki or Weruva. I bought two cases of 10 (Tuna & Bonito and Tuna & Shrimp) and while it's a good price, I think next time we'll stick to Weruva for big cans of food and Tiki for small cans (he gets one big can in the am and one small can in the pm!) I'd buy this stuff again in the future if I was in a pinch, as it's not a bad food...I just like my cats food to look more like real fish or chicken vs over processed "stuff". But good ingredients and grain free at a good price!

Even my roommate's cat, who is extremely picky with wet food (to the point that there is literally only one brand he would eat at all) has been caught sneaking tastes out of her bowl now! This stuff is very high grade - if you check out the b.f.f. site, they make all of their items in a human food processing facility, and there is no grain filler in the food. When opening the cans, it really smells like something you'd open up to eat yourself! I love this product and I will continue to buy it for my baby.

Yes it is on the spendy side, but at least I'm no longer giving away the other expensive brands that they wouldn't eat (because I misplaced the receipt or didn't return them on time). I love bff!

I have 2 male cats one 12 yrs and one 7 yrs. The 7 year old has IBS and vomits most cat food up. He has not vomited this up once. (YEAH!) My older cat eats this and leaves most of the Fancy Feast I put in their bowls. I am so glad I found this as I believe that the grains and fruits they put in cat food is not good for them.

review/text: Two of my cats are very picky eaters most of the time and will only eat kibble or straight up canned tuna. They even turn their noses up at canned salmon and sardines. Even though this food is all fish, I was afraid they might snub it, too, and they normally don't like canned cat foods at all. But they love this. The food has a lot of tuna, but you can tell it has the chunks of tilapia in it. My cats didn't hesitate to eat all of it. I intend to try the other flavors to get some variety in their diet.<br /><br />And I liked that this canned food is very densely packed, not soupy. I just add a little water if the cats need it wetter.

review/summary: Extremely high quality cat food at affordable price
review/text: I love BFF by Weruva because it's incredibly healthy, with only quality meats and supplements and no grains or by-products, but is so much cheaper than any other "premium" brand of comparable quality out there.  I don't even know how they manage to keep the price so reasonable.  The difference in quality is obvious when you open the can, as the food hasn't been ground into unrecognizable oblivion but still has identifiably shredded meat and looks a healthy flesh color, not some unsatisfying 'blah' brown.  I'm a student, so I'm on a very tight budget, but it's worth it to me to purchase BFF for my cats because I believe in preventative care.  Feed my cats well from the beginning and they'll live long, healthy, happy lives with less health problems that will leave me with expensive vet bills.  As for now, my cats and kitten gobble it up in a second flat.  It's obvious they love every flavor I've tried with them (and one is even quite picky).  Their fur is like silk, too.  This is clearly a great food.

review/summary: BFF Tuna and Bonito Be Mine, 5.5 oz. 8-pack
review/text: I recently upgraded to higher quality canned food, first trying the standard Weruva offerings and now the BFF (a Weruva sub-brand?) I like that BFF offers flavors with gravies and others with aspic, as it increases feeding time variety. BFF is certainly a good value compared to the other high-end natural and grain-free products, and even my pickiest senior guy enjoyed the tuna and bonito variety. I will continue purchasing the standard Weruva in Paw Lickin' Chicken since my boys love it, but we are happy to mix it up with BFF. The inclusion of the skin on some fish pieces is certainly a confidence-booster that my cats are getting real food, not mystery meat. I also appreciate the 5.5 ounce can size, as we can share a can each feeding and both cats get their fill.

I managed to order the 4Eva through another source, and the kitties like it.  It was something I wanted because the majority of BFF (and Soulistic, made by the same company) are tuna based (other fish added too, but mostly tuna and fish).  Once in a while it would be nice to have something else;  we get tired of the same thing every meal too!  In general the BFF foods are a good choice - better quality, not outrageous prices.

review/summary: My Cats Refuse To Eat It
review/text: My cats have rejected Tuna and Chicken Chuckles, but I'm only docking it one point for that because I don't think it is the food's fault. It looks just fine, mostly red tuna mixed with shreds of chicken, (there is way more tuna than chicken, the chicken shreds are almost like a condiment). My cats like other flavors of BFF, they just wolfed down a plate of Tuna Too Cool for dinner, but they do not like this one. I've tried feeding it to them several times and they just don't like it. One of them ate a bit of Tuna & Chicken Chuckles and threw it up and the other just refused to touch it. My cats are really picky, though. I'll donate the rest of the case of this to my local shelter where I'm sure the kitties will find it a glorious treat and get my feline food critics something else.

review/summary: Nothing but sub-standard tuna from Thailand
review/text: Read the labels before you buy. All the flavors of BFF list the following two ingredients at the top of their lists: Tuna & water. Every can is just low quality, dark gray, shredded tuna.  The company adds a trace of other ingredients so they can claim to have several flavors, but don't fall for their tricks! Rather, when you want to give your kitty some tuna for a treat, just feed him/her some regular tuna--the good kind humans eat.  Not only is it far superior quality, but it's cheaper, too!

review/text: This is a great product and my three cats eat the Tuna Too Cool and the Tuna and Chicken canned food, but they don't like salmon, I guess.  You would just have to try it to know for sure.  This is a very healthy product because it contains NO GRAINS and is produced by human standards.  I know BFF is an excellent product.

review/summary: Look good to me but expensive
review/text: Best Feline Friend cat food cost more for less food. I did not try it but my cat eats few bites and look at me for something else. I found that it has a very strong smell of fish compared to other brand. In other word may be the food is too concentrated.Despite the much higher cost I would have given my cat this brand if he would have liked it.Sorry "Best Feline" but I did not decide. If you want more details ask Wicket, my cat.

review/summary: Not the best flavor of BFF
review/text: My cat completely ignores this flavor. Instead of the normal slab of meat, like BFF's other flavors, this one is soupy, and apparently not very good. My cat looks at me like I'm crazy when I give it to her. I don't know if I got a bad batch. If someone has gotten this, and it wasn't soupy, please leave a comment.

review/text: I've been feeding my cat this food for about 2 weeks and my cat loves it. However, I feed my cat in the dining room and I eat my breakfast in the living room because the food stinks and the smell lingers.<br /><br />My cat seems very healthy and always has lots of energy after his meal. He seems very healthy and excited to be fed and licks the can clean.<br /><br />But I think I'll return to Tiki Cat or Newman's Own. I change his litterbox at least twice per day because I will not have my house smelling like animal droppings. I will not tolerate foul cat food smell either.

review/text: and she will evetually "give in" and eat this food, but she doesn't "dive right in" as I had hoped she would do. Granted, she is a picky eater and an elderly cat, but I had hoped she would really enjoy this brand of organic food. I do better to cook and grind my own food for her. Heck, I made baby food when my daughter was a baby what's the difference for an old, sickly kitty cat? As expensive as this brand of cat food is I probably save money making my own. I am disappointed, but when I am a poor, old lady on a fixed income and have to eat cat food so I can buy my meds under Obama-care this is the brand I want to eat!

review/text: My cat Joshua is 13years old, he has been with me through thick and thin, good times bad times, you name it. When times were hard, he had to rough it with cat food from the ninety nine cents store, no complaints he ate it up. Lately times have been good so I wanted to buy him something special hence my decision to buy Best Feline Friend, Talk about a emotionally based decision!! this stuff is horrible!! it truly smells worse than any cat food I have ever come across not to mention the fact that he will not even come near the stuff, one whiff and he is walking in the opposite direction. This stuff may be good for cats but if they don't even want to eat it, whats the point? Here's some advice save your money and buy your cat what is good for them but at the same time something they enjoy, that's what your best feline friend deserves, not this stuff.

review/text: Obviously pricey outside of Belgium (or Europe for that matter) however the quality is unmatched.  I bought these for my wife on Easter instead of the traditional (and dare I say highly repetitive) chocolate box brand.  First, the milk chocolate is obviously of higher quality and retains its creamy taste even if regrigerated.  The fillings and cremes are superb.  The only problem I have now is that my wife wants them on every insignificant occasion now!

I found these on Amazon and now my daughter thinks I'm the best mom. They are made without preservatives so they need to be well cared for and not kept around too long. That is not a problem since they taste as great as they do. This package offers a variety of flavors and types to try as well. We really enjoyed having it around. Too bad it didn't last very long before it was gone.

review/summary: Amazing chocolates!
review/text: As with other reviews I was worried about spending so much on chocolates.  I was entirely taken back at how amazing these chocolates were!  I'm not huge on the chocolates filled with items (Some coconut and one that tasted like banana).<br /><br />One thing I will mention.  If you are ordering this as a Christmas present, you better hope that you get the box before it's seen by the person you are giving it to!  On the outside of the box it clearly says "Leonidas Belgian Chocolate".  That was an Xmas present ruined but the chocolates were still enjoyed.  Also, and I don't know if this was just my box or all of them, but you don't get a "map" as to what chocolates are filled with what.  This means that if you don't like a certain chocolate you have to gently bite into a piece that you take and hope it's not that certain flavor :)<br /><br />Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase.  The box looks great that the chocolates come in which adds a nice "Fancy chocolate" touch to it.  They were also packaged very well so nothing was damaged in shipping.

The top of the bags have variation in how much pulling force is needed to open the bag. Some open too easily. Some of the bags are not air sealed, and the contents are stale.

That's why these portion controled sized bags are great. They give you just enough to satisfy your need and the will power to prevent over eating. I will continue buying this size as long as they are available. The price is is great from Amazon. They have sold out at places like Ocean State Job Lot, so the only other place you can get them is a places like Trader Joe's - much more expensive and they don't have these sized bags.

I was told the coffee was not for sale other than to restaurants or organizations and required the establishment to use a Douwe Egbert coffee machine.  I was pleasantly surprised to find I could order it through Amazon and have purchased two or three different blends over the past year.  My only criticism is that I have to order beans and grind them myself because the pre-ground coffee is ground too finely to use in my Keurig machine.  The flavor of all the blends I ordered was wonderful!

review/text: :: Davinci Multicolor Tortellini ::<br /><br />Delicious tortellini from Italy. Great experience, like being delivered from a good italian restaurant! This product has great taste, texture, and appearance.<br /><br />My only disappointment was just upon arrival, first opening the case. The boxes seemed so little. I mean, compared to the 12 oz packages of pasta I'm adjusted to buying. It says 7oz right on the web page description, very clear, but somehow that hadn't really registered in my noggin. However, things got better. I soon found out that 7 oz of tortellini cooks up pretty big, more servings than I'd have anticipated from the little boxes.<br /><br />Very happy with the Davinci pastas I've tried so far. I'd be complete if only they also made some pasta sauces for AMZN to send to my doorstep along with the pasta.<br /><br />Anyway, I recommend this tortellini. It's great hot...and come spring, will also give it a whirl for cold pasta salad.

review/summary: Yummy -- easy to have on hand
review/text: Bought these some time ago on Amazon and have come back to them and the DaVinci ravioletti after trying Barilla and other brands. I find these quite tasty and lacking in the fillers some other brands use. Great with just butter and some grated cheese, with various sauces, and makes a yummy Italian salad with cut up hard salami, chunks of provolone, and some Italian pickled veggies, or marinated artichoke, or olives.<br /><br />I love the ease of having these in the pantry for whenever I need them. I cook in microwave by boiling the water in container, tossing in amount I need (often the whole box), and cooking until they are tender. They do double in size when cooked. A great last-minute dinner. And as a salad (above), great for bringing to potlucks.

review/summary: Never should have bought
review/text: This tortellini is dry and grainy and comes in small boxes. I couldn't eat it... the flavor was very strong, but not very good. I ended up donating all 11 remaining boxes.

review/summary: Great Flavor
review/text: Comes in a tiny package, but walloped with big flavor!  So pleased to be able to find organic spices, and Amazon makes it easy to find these.  Thanks for giving us the opportunity to purchase these, especially since some of us live in areas where hard to find spices are not available. Keep in mind that this is a small package...I thought it would be bigger.  However, really enjoying it!

review/summary: Great Chips, HORRIBLE Packaging
review/text: I have always been a big fan of the sour cream and onion pringles, and I was looking for a bulk purchase. I decided since I make a lot of other purchases on Amazon that these would be fine too. I did expect some breakage, but I also expected them to reasonably try to package them to help prevent breakage. When I got the box, they had put one set of bubble wrap on the top of the case of chips, but somehow decided that not putting anything under them would be fine. Needless to say most of the chips are broken. I still ate them as little pieces, but I was pretty disappointed that they didn't bubble wrap them all the way around as most people would think to do.<br /><br />I give it 3 stars just because I like the chips. Shipping gets no stars in my book.<br /><br />I won't be ordering these again.
