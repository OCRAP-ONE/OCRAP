review/summary: Tasty and Healthy
review/text: Many snacks labeled "healthy" today still have hydrogenated oils in them.  Garden of eatin' snacks do not.  The taste is wonderful.  Great with salsa and/or guacamole.  The sesame seeds add a nice flavor without being overpowering.  My favorite chip for all occasions.

review/summary: The best corn chips out there
review/text: Although these are way more fun than regular white or yellow corn chips, they taste pretty much the same as any other color of natural corn tortilla chips.  These chips are blue because the type of corn they are made from naturally grows blue - there's no blue dye here!  Garden of Eatin' is my favorite brand for chips, because they put so much  thought into all their products, from the organic corn to the cold-pressed oils.  They even use filtered water!<br /><br />The chips I got were all really fresh, delicious, and crunchy, except for one bag out of 12, which had a good date, but tasted a bit stale.  To my surprise, not many of the chips got broken during shipping, although I'm not sure I'll be that lucky to get unbroken chips everytime I order these.<br /><br />If you've never tried these, I suggest getting just one bag from a local store, and wait to order from here till you know you like them.  If you already know you like blue chips, get them here, as this price is unbeatable.

review/summary: Deceptive packaging-it does have GMO ingredients
review/text: Either these folks are completely ignorant or they think putting " no genetically engineered ingredients" on the front of the package will cause us to to ignore their list of ingredients on the back.  Canola oil is made from genetically modified rapeseed. They also say it may have Safflower or Sunflower oil, but I'd<br />rather not take part in that lottery. I'd like to send back this lot, but I'm not willing to bet, they would not have the nerve to sell it to the next unsuspecting soul, so it will go straight into the trash can ,where it belongs.

review/summary: The best chips ever invented, truly the pinnacle of human acheivement and civilization
review/text: Fate has smiled upon you today, for you have stumbled upon a review of the best corn chips on the planet.  Yes they really are that good.<br /><br />I'm not in thrall of the whole "organic" thing generally, but I have to say these blue corn chips themselves are somehow FAR better than competitors. Crisp and thick cut, a strong corn taste. You probably don't think a chip can have a strong corn taste, but these do, because unlike competitors they're not cooked in a month old batch of mystery oil.<br /><br />The person who came up with this "red hot" flavoring is a genius, this is the best flavoring for chips ever invented.  It will make your toes curl and your eyes roll back into your head.  It is only a little hot, but it builds up a bit if you eat the whole darn bag, which you almost certainly will.<br /><br />I also recommend their plain blue corn chips for dips, but for the love of everything that is good don't get the unsalted ones.

review/summary: If you want fiber, don't buy!
review/text: I specifically ordered these chips because the nutrition information states they have 4 grams of fiber per serving. They taste good, so I ordered the case from Amazon. (In fact, I even signed up for subscribe and save) When my package arrived today, the bag says they only have 1 gram of fiber per serving! I called Garden of Eatin' and was told that there was new analysis and testing done which shows they only actually have one gram of fiber per serving. That's a huge difference! The customer service rep said the testing was done in September, yet the nutrition information on their own website still shows 4 grams of fiber. To me, that is false advertising. How hard is it to go in change that information on your own website!<br /><br />So, bottom line, if you don't care about the amount of fiber...these are really tasty chips. But if the amount of fiber is what attracted you to them, don't buy!

review/text: I purchased these chips on October 18, 2010.  They were rancid/stale so you can certainly believe the other reviewers.  I had not noticed the reviews about the horrible taste and staleness of these chips.  I wish I had.  I contacted customer service for a refund which they approved but I think Amazon should either stop selling these chips due to such poor reviews or check their stock to make sure they are FRESH. If you order, you should order with caution.  I am trying another brand instead of reordering these.

review/text: I have eaten the varieties of these for years and appreciate the concept- organic, not over salted, good varieities, etc.<br /><br />But more and more often, whether purchased here or in the store, in all varieties, the chips come with a sharp odor and flavor that to more suggests that rancid oil was used.  Sometimes it is subtle, sometimes terrible, and I am sick of wondering if I am eating something that has gone bad- and rancid oils are really bad for you, which defeats the purpose of this product. I can return them to a store but not to Amazon.  This is still a huge pain and not something that anyone should have to do.  I had to throw out a whole case of sesame blues from Amazon, which is a bad deal at any price. I am done with your rancid products.

review/summary: Regular tortilla chips.  Not flavorful.
review/text: I have noooo idea what the "blech" titled review is about.  My bag is not spicy at all, and the chips definitely don't taste bad. They were not too crunchy either.  In fact they are almost plain regular chips.  No big pizzaz here.  I was sad about that.<br /><br />I was actually really hoping for something limey! And Spicy! But don't expect that here.  I've almost gone through a whole bag, and maybe 1% of the bites have a hint of lime?  Zero bites have had a hint of chili.  99% taste like regular unflavored tortilla chips.  Well...a suuupppper small hint of flavor.  I'm almost wishing I had bought the pico de gallo instead.<br /><br />Basically, if you've been eating any chili-lemon flavored cheetos, completely wipe your memory and expectations- nothing that bold and tangy here.  (Which can be good and bad, my hubby hated the cheetos chili-lemon unspicy flavor and was worried we'd get that here, so he's happy we didn't.  I was looking forward to getting that popping taste, and am sad that wasn't there.)<br /><br />** WARNING: If you've never ordered full size bag of chips from amazon, be warned, 12 bags is A LOT!!! I opened the box and my jaw almost dropped, cause I don't know what I'm going to do with all the bags.  I'm sure they'll disappear at parties though.  (I had ordered mini 2oz bags from Amazon, and with those, the bulk amount is more manageable.)<br /><br />** Also, to make you feel good...I was at Ralphs shopping and one bag of 'Garden of Eaten' chips cost $5.39.  I think it was jalapeno cheese, and that's all they had, but regardless, I felt so good that I got the same thing for about $1.25 a bag (yea Amazon had it on sale). Yippy :-)<br /><br />** Chips were not stale, chipped or smashed on arrival, in case you're wondering.  And expiration date (on my on sale ones) is in about 4 months.

But I like the taste of lime and I really like the zing of a good chili.<br /><br />Well, the label is half right. The taste of lime is really quite distinct and refreshing. I really enjoy that part of the equation. But from my experience with these chips, the chili taste is overpowered by the lime (or there was not much of the chili flavor to begin with).<br /><br />Still, the lime test is so refreshing!<br /><br />All in all, a good product because of the lime. But, in the end, rather unsatisfactory, because the pairing of lime and chili doesn't quite work.

These are absolutely amazing. I wish all of the ingredients were organic but i won't be too picky. The 12 bags are quite a bit to get in one order but it is much cheaper than getting it at a local store.

review/text: If they were not on sale, I wouldn't have bought them, having tried other brands of "guac-a-mole" flavored tortilla chips.  I'm glad I didn't pay full price.  The taste is hard to describe - somewhere between gasoline and garbage, neither of which I've ever actually ingested, but which these chips brought to mind by taste and smell.  How do people eat and enjoy this crud?  The only explanation I arrive at is they've never savored the exquisitely smooth and sprightly taste of true guacamole made with ripe avocados and fresh cilantro.<br />I had to give this product one star because Amazon said so.  I guess that star could go for the unbelievably corny (no pun intended) "new look, same great taste" icon on the upper-left corner of the bag.  Its such a quaint reminder of the inane, inconsequential marketing style of the "Mad-Men" era I grew up in.

review/text: I really like these chips. We go through a lot of corn chips in this house and it is important to me that our corn chips are organic as I refuse to eat GMO corn. They have a great flavor and the perfect amount of salt. My only complaint is that this last case we recieved, the chips are so fragile! They are breaking really easily, they are not holding up to any amount of dipping, which is a bummer. I'll still buy these chips, I'm just not as pleased with them as I have been in the past. Perhaps it was just an odd batch, as they haven't always been this way.<br /><br />We have bought several flavors of Garden of Eatin chips and this brand is a winner, overall. Definitely our favorite corn chip brand!

review/text: You watch your mouth!<br /><br />Simply, one of the best things I have ever eaten. Healthy organic blue corn chips with taste that packs a punch.<br /><br />I won't waste your time reading about these when you can be enjoying them instead. Just note that some bags seem to have a more generous allotment of cayenne pepper (the special ingredient that distinguishes Red Hot Blues from the standard Blue Chips). Or perhaps certain bags settle more during shipment, in which case the bulk of the cayenne dust is to be found at the bottom of the bag. You can always scoop up the loose seasoning and sprinkle on the chips (or any food! LOL) as you see fit.<br /><br />P.S. Amazon needs to figure out how to share reviews across products. In this case, for example, there are at least four different listings for Red Hot Blues. The only difference is the size of the bag or the quantity of bags that are bundled together. I am posting this review in those as well because other than one listing, none of the others have any reviews. Hopefully this will be of some help to customers, plus point them toward the main listing (the one with Free Shipping and sold directly from Amazon!).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EQYW0E">Garden of Eatin'� Tortilla Chips Red Hot Blues, 9-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />P.P.S.

review/summary: Those Red Hot Blues are one bad mutha...
review/text: You watch your mouth!<br /><br />Simply, one of the best things I have ever eaten. Healthy organic blue corn chips with taste that packs a punch.<br /><br />I won't waste your time reading about these when you can be enjoying them instead. Just note that some bags seem to have a more generous allotment of cayenne pepper (the special ingredient that distinguishes Red Hot Blues from the standard Blue Chips). Or perhaps certain bags settle more during shipment, in which case the bulk of the cayenne dust is to be found at the bottom of the bag. You can always scoop up the loose seasoning and sprinkle on the chips (or any food! LOL) as you see fit.<br /><br />P.S. Amazon needs to figure out how to share reviews across products. In this case, for example, there are at least four different listings for Red Hot Blues. The only difference is the size of the bag or the quantity of bags that are bundled together. I am posting this review in those as well because other than one listing, none of the others have any reviews. Hopefully this will be of some help to customers, plus point them toward the main listing (the one with Free Shipping and sold directly from Amazon!).

review/text: These are excellent chips, except Amazon couldn't get the order straight and twice sent me cases of Red Hot Blues. Great. What does a single person do with 2 cases of already flavored chips? Yep, give them away. I liked the Red Hots, but wanted these with no seasoning (I make my own salsas) for every day and Amazon just couldn't pull it off. The case was even clearly labelled.  Go figure. Amazon did refund my money fully.

review/text: Be warned that these chips have NO SALT.  That is what I want, so that I can taste the interesting flavor of this unique variety of corn, unadulterated by unhealthful sodium.  The blue color is not a artificial chemical coloring, but healthful anthocyanins.  This corn is a great source of these compounds, which have been demonstrated to have immense and healthful benefits.  Highly recommended, especially for corn lovers!<br /><br />Regards,<br />proclus<br />[...]

review/summary: Vegan Natural [Organic Corn] Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Natural. Kosher Parve. Made with organic yellow corn; canola, safflower, or sunflower oils [all organic and/or conventional]; and sea salt. Great choice for those who like corn chips like Fr*tos. Great with bean burritos, enchiladas, soups, and even as a crunchy salad topping. Like most chips, highly caloric. 170 calories per 1oz/28g serving. Use as a garnish, repackage in smaller snack bag sizes, or eat in moderation.

review/summary: Great Flavour - Excellent Find!
review/text: I've been hunting for snacks which taste good, but don't have BHA,BHT,EDTA,hydrogenated (partially or otherwise) fats, artificial colors and a myriad of other ingredients which are known to be "bad" yet they are still allowed in food production.  I can't express how excited I was to find these!  My husband is a very picky snacker - he loves these.  My children one which likes spicy and one which doesn't (third is too young for this kind of food) love these.  They are great straight out of the bag or as an accompaniment to a sandwich or bowl of chili.<br /><br />I initially found these in our local PCC and Whole Foods.  I'm glad Amazon carries them.  Price wise I'm saving at least $1.00/bag by buying through Amazon instead of from my grocery.

The blue corn version is equally good if not better! If you think the guiltless one's are good,these will leave you speechless. There is NO comparison. The only problem I see is that garden of eatin has a line of about 15 different tortilla chips. The only one's baked are these two. Those that make the decisions what to shelve need to start giving these chips their due. Something so delicious and actually good for you needs the proper availability to succeed. Try these baked chips. If you have taste buds,they'll be happy.

review/summary: Love them, but wish they had a 6 pack instead of a 12.
review/text: I love the salt free blue corn chips. When I lived in Florida I ate salsa/hummus/blue corn chips for lunch pretty much every day. There was so much salt between the salsa and hummus, that I really didn't need it on the chips. When I first started with the salted chips, my mouth would be on fire after a few chips. The salt free was an awesome find, and I love that amazon sold them in bulk so that I could afford them.<br /><br />Only con is because I'm single/live alone, and going through 12 bags of tortilla chips before they expire is a challenge (natural products tend to expire quicker). I ate them after the "best by" date, they just ended up being a little stale. No fault of the product, just my own issue to deal with. Still 5 star product!

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I have always loved these chips and buy them often at the grocery store. Since Amazon offered them at a very good price I purchased a case, However, upon receipt I was disappointed and immediately notified the company (Garden of Eatin). They were not as good as the ones in the grocery store (they seemed to be darker and greasier)and I wondered if they were old. The expiration date indicates they are fine. I do not dislike them, though I love the store ones, and have decided to keep them. Salsa can fix anything. However, I will not purchase them again in bulk from Amazon. My biggest disappointment has been that the company never responded to my email.

review/summary: two small issues
review/text: I have no idea why I ordered these... must have been pretty hungry that day and just needed something to fill the order to get my free shipping.<br /><br />But speaking of shipping, I ordered these "MINI WHITE ROUNDS" and an equivalent order of "TATO SKINS".  The "skins" arrived unbroken while the "rounds" were about half rounds and half crumbles.  I think the difference was that the "skins" people engineered the size of the box just right so the puffy bags held each other in place, while the "rounds" people just threw a dozen bags into the box and only filled it about 3/4 of the way, leaving the bags free to slop around inside.<br /><br />Secondly, just the cursory test, I opened a bag and tasted a few, sort of expecting a "tostitos" or "mission" kind of taste, but they were just a kind of bland corn tortilla taste... which is exactly what they were supposed to be, but ... well you know... expected a taste that would keep me reaching back into the bag until I was ashamed of myself... the "Tato Skins" certainly did!  Maybe they'll be better when I dip them in some quacamole or something.

review/text: A marvelous crunchy treat, acceptable to even the most finicky toddler. Wonderful with salsa and sour cream, hot spinach and artichoke dip, and many more ways. If they used a different fat to cook them (the label currently says safflower and/or canola) they would be perfect. I love that they're free of GMO but I'd be even happier if they contained a healthy fat such as lard or coconut oil, or even olive or sunflower or grapeseed would be an improvement.

review/text: These are great chips!  I also like the red chips.  UNFORTUNATELY, Amazon ships these out in the vendor boxes which are very flimsy.  All of the chips end up broken.<br /><br />It's so funny -- everything else Amazon sends out is in rugged Amazon boxes -- sometimes the item inside is in the vendor box so you get double protection.  The items that should be double boxed (chips) don't get any protection at all and they are the most fragile.

review/summary: Garden of FakeLime Detergenty Flavors and other Natural Flavors
review/text: I'm just going to say it: These CHIPS Taste like DETERGENT.<br /><br />Given that Garden of Eatin' blue corn, and red hots chips are my favorite of all time, it's puzzling how they can produce such an unfortunate product as "Chili & Lime".<br /><br />First of all, where's the chili? I don't even taste it. Even tho I'm an advanced chili pepper user, I have a very keen palate. I detect less than 1 part per billion of chili in these here unfortunate chips.<br /><br />Also, I detect fraudulent lime flavors and *that* my friends is an egregious error from such a reknowned company. The red herring that it's NOT natural is "NATURAL FLAVORS WITH LIME". The translation here is that these natural flavors could be really anything, could be any combination of terpene extracts from 'natural sources'. For example, fake lemon flavor in candies and wood detergent is often an extract from lemongrass because it's cheaper than from lemons. But it's a different chemical also. Fake lime is immediately a mistake, and anyone-not just supertasters-can tell.<br /><br />This fakeLime taste, or 'floor detergent flavor', is reminiscent of a childhood fragrance- the strong chemical citrus waft of mopwater that a theater employee was using to mask the rotting popcorn-soda-slurry smell by the dumpster.<br /><br />In other words, it seems as if Garden of Eatin found the cheapest, strongest floor stripping chemicals from Big Lots, extracted the lime scent component and littered it lightly onto these chips.<br /><br />So if you want to mop floor with a tea of these, or you are considering a colon cleanse, accept no substitute.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------<br />Ok so along the lines of constructive criticism:<br /><br />ATTN: Garden of EATIN'<br /><br />Please contact Tostitos sensory labs scientists. It is imperative that you find out how Tostitos makes their hint of lime chips because they got it right. Use at least 500 ppm nanolimeparticles and same same for chili. Coat those suckers with maybe 1/2 to 100% of the rate used for redhotblues.

review/summary: BEST baked chips ever!!
review/text: I had these chips on vacation and could never find them in any of my local stores including Whole Foods.  On a whim, I checked Amazon and was so happy to find that they sold them and they were a pretty good price too.  I was little worried about ordering chips online, the expiration date, shipping and how we were going to get through all of them.<br /><br />No worries!  Only 3 bags left  - my husband and I love them.  The shipping was A+, with double boxes and air bags.  The chip bags are puffed up and you will need clippers or scissors to open it.  I don't mind because I think that's why they are so good and crunchy, not like the Guiltless Gourmet ones that taste like stale cardboard.  We make it to the bottom of the bag with very few crushed chips at all.  The fresh by date was 3 1/2 months from my date of purchase.<br /><br />The best part of all is the taste and nutritional quality of these chips.  One serving has 120 calories with 3 grams fat, 3 grams protein and 3 grams of fiber which for chips is pretty good.  Yes, they are not like blue corn regular chips with twice the fat, but they are the best ones out there that are baked.<br /><br />I will definitely be reordering again!

review/summary: Garden Of Eatin' Blue Corn Chips
review/text: Corn chips, you can't have just one and therein lies the problem. The crunch, the salt, the flavors are so addictive.  Not only are they perfect by themselves but they are a vessel for deliciousness. Whether its guacamole, salsa, refried beans, hummus, you name it.  My favorite these days has to be blue corn chips, they have a deeper almost burnt flavor to them which I can't seem to get enough of.  Garden Of Eatin' blue corn chips are my chips of choice.  They have the crunch, the salt, the flavor, not to mention they are organic and GMO free. I got so excited when they went on sale that I ended up crushing some of the bags as I grabbed them.  I feel bad for the person who got the bag of crumbs, I have to contain myself next time around.

Texture is wonderful, great corn taste.  I brush excess salt off with a paper towel if I just want to snack dip free.  I won't buy again simply because I don't need 12 bags to have to "clean" before eating.  I will try their salt or low salt varieties though as it really is a stellar chip on it's own.

But you folks might want to revisit your packaging.  You know how you grab a bag of chips at the top and pull apart the seam to open?<br />These seams have been sealed with titanium.  And if you eventually manage to pull it apart, of course the rest of the bag is made of the same far too easily ripped all the way down the side to hope to reseal the bag, as every other manufacturer uses today.

review/summary: not correc size
review/text: This product is not the 9 ounce bag as advertised but is actually 8.1 ounces.  Apparently rising prices are forcing the manufacturer to put smaller amounts in the bag, but this is foolish since if anyone reads product labels it is the people that buy organic foods.  The manufacturer should wise up and just raise their price to reflect the increase rather than skimp on the bag size. Organic food consumers are willing to pay more for a premium product, but get upset when the company or marketer does not deliver on what they say they are going to deliver on. As for Amazon.com, I can only think that this is an honest mistake and that they did not update their product description. But, for a company that specializes in the latest and greatest computer tech, this is falling short of the mark.  To sum up, this is still a good product, but both the manufacturer and the seller need to get it right.

review/text: Like the chips; however this last time the bags only contain 8.1 ounces not the 9 ounces that<br />the ad says.  That equates to a whole bag (10.8 ounces) is missing.  What gives?!?

review/summary: Very  old stock
review/text: I received this product from Amazon who sent me the oldest stock possible. The postage alone cost about $60 and i ordered about $60 worth of the product. Most of the items I received were only 2 to 3 weeks from their sell by date and are rancid or stale. It was a huge disappointment receiving these and I will never order this product again.Neither will i recommend anyone buy this product from Amazon. It makes you think that Garden of Eatin products are not good but I have bought them before at my local grocery store and they tasted great,so I know for sure that the problem is with Amazon stock. For me, thats $120 wasted as returns are apparently not possible. very very disappointed with Amazon.com, because i shop at Amazon.co.uk very often and have rarely been disappointed and even when there have been disappointments, they are immediately rectified. Amazon.com does not allow refunds or returns on this item, so beware!

review/summary: Awesome horsepills
review/text: First off, I think the reviews on this page are confusing.  It seems to me there is a mix of people who bought the container of oil and those that bought the pills.<br /><br />I bought the pills and am enjoying them very much.  I read news reports on how coconut oil may help with Alzheimers, diabetes and diet so I thought I'd try them since I have issues with all of these in my family line.  I feel more mentally focused and alert since I've started taking them a week or so ago.  I definitely plan to continue to take the pills.<br /><br />They are large as many people have noted (see my photo uploaded with the quarter), but they are not any bigger than any other large vitamin.  The pills, like other vitamins, do have a slight smell if you stick your nose in the bottle.  But they have no taste, no after taste and no gross burps later.<br /><br />The bottle calls for 3 pills 3x a day.  9 seems pretty excessive for vitamins.  I'm taking 6 right now, 3 with my coffee in the morning and 3 with dinner since I usually only have 1 or 2 meals a day.<br /><br />I would note that taking these has loosened some things up, you know -- down there.  It's not an emergency bathroom thing but you probably will be flowing pretty freely when you do go.  I'm assuming my body will eventually adjust and become more regular but it's not really bother if it doesn't.

Reading about coconut oils, someone mentioned the gag factor. I had no idea what they were referring to until I tasted this. NOW's a good name, but they fell short here. You'd be better off with Jarrow or Nutiva, similar price, better taste...

review/summary: Excellent product
review/text: My primary reason for buying this product was to help my digestive system.  I have iron deficiency anemia, but I could not tolerate any brand of iron supplement, and the shots were extremely painful. So I became extremely anemic and needed transfusions. Consequently, I couldn't take a chance anymore on not using iron tablets and I had to find a way to take them without suffering.<br />Because I use coconut oil and milk in my cooking and for skin/hair care, I've done research on the benefits of this amazing seed, and I thought that these capsules might help me to tolerate iron tablets.  Well they have, and I am now able to tolerate 3 daily doses of ferrous sulfate, so I'm in compliance with my doctors orders and my hemoglobin level is rising.

review/text: This oil has a rancid, off-putting odor that smells NOTHING like coconut, more like yeast.  It also has a TERRIBLE taste.  DO NOT BUY!!!<br /><br />I consume a jar of coconut oil a week because I take it as a supplement and cook with it.  Jarrow, Spectrum, Nutiva, Vitacost and Swanson are MUCH better.  Their coconut oils smell really good with a fresh, coconut scent and taste great too.<br /><br />I was surprised because I use other NOW products and am happy with them. The quality, judging by my experience & others', is that this may just be a faulty jar but the quality isn't consistent.  I don't see bad reviews from the other oils I use & I have never had a bad batch from the others I have mentioned.

review/text: Purchased this and Flaxseed Oil to help punch up my HDL "good" cholesterol levels. Not sure how it is working yet but they seem to work fine and I feel better taking them. We also use Coconut oil in bulk form for cooking as the fat composition is supposed to be better for you than other vegetable oils. As for capsules, I have read other reviews that say these "taste bad".... but I have never had this problem. Because they are capsules I am unsure how anyone could taste them anyway, unless they were punctured or chewed. They are rather large capsules, but they go down fine. I would recommend them.

review/summary: Coconut Palms and Ocean Breezes: Paradise Rising?
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 9:08 Mins<br /><br /></span>While this review features the book, COCONUT OIL MIRACLE, it displays and describes other products [including coconut oil] which that book catalyzed into a healing synergy. I've reviewed most of the products shown in this video.<br /><br />Johanna Galt, thank you for your comment and question posted under the original written review I had submitted here, which I've deleted and replaced with this video [6/25/10]. Most of the content below was written in response to your question.<br /><br />I had purchased this brand a few years ago, and to be honest, I don't recall much about the flavor.  It was my first experience cooking with coconut oil, and I hadn't yet read any books on it.  The brands I've used recently and favor most for quality, aroma, and flavor are:<br /><br />EFAGold Coconut Oil, Extra Virgin, Organic, 16 oz.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5Q64">Nutiva Organic  Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 15-Ounce Unit (Pack of 2)</a><br /><br />Both of those brands, from my experience, are excellent quality.<br /><br />When I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583332049">The Coconut Oil Miracle (by Bruce Fife)</a> I learned a greater variety of uses of the oil and how to work with its relatively hard texture.  I had kept it in the refrigerator until I read Fife's book and learned the oil [if it's in good condition when purchased] could be safely kept in the cupboard, usually for a year or more.  There's lots of interesting, valuable information in that book, which helped me conveniently expand my usage of this miracle oil.<br /><br />I had recently read the later reviews on this NOW Foods offering and had felt that possibly I was lucky to get a better quality batch than some of those reviewers, because I don't recall the oil tasting off.  But after reading those reviews and experiencing what might be higher quality products [linked above], I will probably stay with EFAGold or Nutiva, but I'm curious enough to try the NOW Foods product on this page again for flavor and purity comparison, in case the poor reviews came from an uncommon occurrence of a bad batch of the product.<br /><br />The EFAGold jar I received seemed to be of slightly higher quality, but Nutiva is very near as good, and sometimes priced more economically.  The information on some of the Amazon product pages for Nutiva is interesting, very helpful, and impressive.  I'm now cooking so much with the oil that I bought the larger size, Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil 54 oz.  But I will also keep the 15 oz jars, as they're convenient to take with me away from home.<br /><br />To be fair, I should buy this NOW brand again to compare it to these others which I've experienced.  I've used other NOW Foods products and have been pleased with them.<br /><br />I've noticed additional brands available on Amazon which look good, too.  From the information in Fife's book, I might try any oil which is cold pressed [ANH, absolutely no heat] and extra virgin.<br /><br />I LOVE cooking with coconut oil.  It seems to me to enhance the integrity of the flavor of the food it's used with, and the savory flavor of beef steaks and other stronger meats can be furthered and the coconut edge removed by use of garlic, onions, and salty spices added to the oil when cooking.<br /><br />Some of my reviews on the above linked product pages give different information from this one, and hopefully more helpful written information from the original one which had been posted here.  In view of some of the comments and the collected "NO" votes on that review, I decided to post this video, to delete the original written review, and plan to include a copy of it at the end of the first 6 comments which had been made on the original review.<br /><br />May pleasant aromas follow your nose,<br />Linda Shelnutt<br /><br />NOTE: If you have a magnesium deficiency like many people are experiencing now, feel free to read some of my reviews on magnesium products for information about ways to retain that index mineral into your system at adequate levels.  Most coconut oil has a lot of potassium in it, which can replace some of the needed magnesium.

review/summary: Awesome Product...
review/text: MY EXPERIENCE WITH COCONUT:<br />A few things first... I have done extensive research on Coconut oil & the benefits it has on our bodies.  I can tell you that the antiviral benefits it has definitely works. After a couple of days of sleeping a ton, being very sick & calling me at work crying because she couldn't stay awake, I took my daughter (13 y.o. then 17 now) to the doctor & she was diagnosed with Mono. The doctor explained to me that it is part of the Epstein Barr family (cold sores, herpes, etc.) and that there isn't any kind of medicine that can "cure" the illness. He explained that she would sleep a lot, that I needed to call her school & tell them what she had & that she would only be there half days for a few months. I was deflated, stressed & couldn't believe there was nothing I could do for her. I had recently read a book that included coconut oil as a way to detox, lose weight, boost metabolism and so many others and had bought some oil to cook with & take daily. I had done a search & read as much as I could about the coconut & remembered reading that it killed the Epstein Barr virus. I went straight to my computer when I got home & did another search & found the article I had read. I decided to give my daughter the oil twice a day to see if it helped her. I called her down & melted the oil in a spoon & had her take it that afternoon & then again later that evening.  The next morning before I left for work I gave her another dose. She called me around lunch time very happy and excited and said she wasn't tired and could stay awake. I remember thinking that the oil was working and was very relieved, but still a bit hesitant.  When I got home to my surprise, she was very excited, wide awake & for the first time since she was sick, was chipper and I could tell she was getting back to her old self. I gave her another dose of the oil that evening & for a few days after and she was all better.  The oil had killed the virus and restored her health.<br /><br />This stuff is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone who has any illness, pain or arthritis type conditions.  My old dog eats some oil, that I cook with, in his food for treatment of possible arthritis in his hip. He has stopped limping & can raise up from a laying/sitting position better than he has in a long time. It is also the first thing he eats in his bowl (I just take about a tablespoon and toss it on top of the dry food). HE LOVES IT!!<br /><br />ABOUT THIS PRODUCT HERE:<br />I have been taking these pills for about 3 weeks now to help raise my metabolism & to help lower my cholesterol.  I haven't been back to the doctor to see how it is working for my cholesterol, but I can say that it has boosted my energy levels more than any other oil or coconut product I have tried yet.  The closest I've come to this level of energy boost was when I drank some homemade coconut milk from a coconut we bought from the store. Also, When I dropped my daughter off at work yesterday, she was exhausted (stayed up late texting or Twittering I would bet)& I handed her one of these pills & told her it would give her energy... As she walked away she stuck it right in her mouth & swallowed it!! When she came home that night I asked her if the pill worked & she said yes!!  From a TEEN mind you!! This is the same child up top there that knows that this stuff works! I highly recommend this product if you are a coconut user and if you're not... What the H E double toothpicks are you waiting for???

review/summary: #1 Vitamin Manufacturer in my Book
review/text: I received the order in a timely fashion and got the most recent manufactured date (so no...it was not stale).  Would do business with anyone who carries the NOW Label.  Haven't taken it long enough to give it my review, but will at a later date.

review/summary: unexpected benefit
review/text: I purchased these in hopes of helping my dry skin.  It has helped, but it took a couple of weeks to really see any difference.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that I was losing weight without even trying.  I thought it had to be a coincidence, so I googled it.  Turns out that weight loss is common with coconut oil consumption.  :)

review/summary: Coconut oil capsules
review/text: These are huge softgels, but if you have a problem swallowing could pose a problem. The quality is excellent, seems to work fine, but I only take one , instead of the recommended three. Gives me a headache if I take the recommended dose. I would purchase again, price is right.

review/summary: On a coconut kick...
review/text: Besides my balsamic kick, I'm kind of on a coconut kick. Purchased a few books stating how good coconut oil is for us. I've been cooking with it which I think actually makes things cook better (tastier). The literature I've read states that coconut supplements are good for you. So, I figured I'd try it. Can't say one way or another if it works. Haven't felt different (good or bad) since taking it. Good news is there is no weird after taste (like you can experience with fish oils).

review/summary: Overwhelming Bergamot Perfume
review/text: ***<br />This Earl Grey Tea from Stash is plain, and definitely not subtle because of a strong bergamot component---way too strong! If you really, really love bergamot you may like it, but I much prefer a more subtle and more complex tea. It tastes like perfumed black tea; I could hardly drink it. I could not tell the difference between it and Stash's Double Bergamot Black Tea---both are just swimming in oil of bergamot. I am an Earl Grey fan, but just couldn't stomach this tea.<br /><br />It seems like the quality of the black tea is very good, though, because even with a longer brewing time, the tea did not become bitter...so, if you can stand being hit over the head with the bergamot flavor, you might enjoy it.<br /><br />Only recommended for those who want a strongly perfumed bergamot Earl Grey.<br />***
