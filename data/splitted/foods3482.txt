review/summary: S O O O O O......G O O D...! ! ! ! !
review/text: When I was little, I coined a word for things that tasted SO good, just about nothing else could compare.  The word is: "scrumptuutious", (pronounced "scrump-TOO-shus", or "scrump-TOO-tee-us", if you prefer an English pronounciation....  Very, very few foods qualify for this appelation --but "ROBINSON'S APPLE & BLACKCURRANT -- also known as "Fruit Squash" -- qualifies with a capital "Q"!<br /><br />If you buy this delicious drink, my first suggestion is that you remove the labels, as much as is possible, from the tall, elegant plastic bottles. (This was not too difficult at all, at least for me, as the bottles I received had their labels very, very lightly attached to begin with.)  Then take the bottle(s), and put them in the refrigerator, and have the refrigerator's light shine through the bottle(s).  The dark-red liquid inside is so extraordinary, that you may see a beautiful, optical illusion: It may seem as if the slim, elegant bottle(s) is (or are), suddenly filled with the most equisitely beautiful and costly ruby....shaped just like the bottle(s)!  Or, if you wish, a non-alcholic beverage that looks exactly like the finest of fine red wine!  Of course, this is really just the pure, transparent concentrate inside, lit up and lit through, by your refrigerator's light....but it really is something quite wonderful, and quite beautiful, to see!<br /><br />I suggest you do this JUST after having received your bottles.  For this way, they are unopened, and you get to see the whole bottle lit up.  However, once the bottle is opened, the wonderful taste within will probably be a precursor to there not being very much left in the bottle, for very long....no matter how much you, and/or others in your household  try to restrain yourself! (selves!)<br /><br />If you like grape juice, you will absolutely LOVE this drink.  (If you don't like grape juice, it is possible you won't like FRUIT SQUASH either,,,but to be sure, give it a try anyway...) There is a slightly more sweet, slightly more acidic taste to this drink than plain grape juice has.  Black currants are, I have learnt, a separate variety of small, dried grapes. (Note too that "currant" is spelt with an "A").<br />Don't let the price scare you off....this is a CONCENTRATE!  The front label directions of this Fruit Squash -- describing milliter servings -- may be a little confusing for those used to ounces, instead of milliliters.... But on another Robinson Prouduct -- the equally scrumptuutious LEMON BARLEY WATER, (also, I must shamelessly admit, reviewed by me for Amazon.com) -- it is more clearly stated:  ONE part Robinson product, to FOUR parts water. Actually, these directions are also on the Apple and Blackcurrant fruit squash....but only on the back label, in far smaller letting.  (Note to Robinson's Sopft Drinks, Limited, and Britvic.com -- PLEASE put these far more clear,<br />"one part Robinson's to four parts water" directions, on ALL your products, in LARGE lettering, on either front or back label.  Your American and other customers who are more familiar with ounces than they are with milliliters, will thank you!) In any event, this means that each 1 liter bottle, (slightly more than a quart), will make FIVE liters of fruit squash!  This is a bit over one gallon & a quart....and thus the concentrate serves to save LOTS of room in your refrigerator, as well as allowing one to add whatever water, (tap, Evian, distilled, etc.), one wishes!<br /><br />Robinson's Apple and Blackcurrant is good either hot or cold.  It's also good to add to recipes....either full or half-strengh...when "grape juice" is called for.  But please....use full or half-strength ONLY for recipes! It is tempting, I know, to try the concentrate full-strenght for drinking...and, (as I am, after all, reviewing this product for the benefit of other people), I did take the liberty to do just that, once or twice, (ok, maybe I tried it full-strenght three or four times....just to make sure, and ONLY for testing purposes, you of course understand...: )  Anyway, drinking this product full-strength led, for me anyway, to my heart beating faster than usual.  A danger sign...so I stopped doing it.  Grapes are used to make wine, after all, and though this product is non-fermented, and thus non-alcholic, a strong, concentrated dose of liquid grapes DOES have a negative effect...albeit, for me, (weighing as I do, some more than few pounds overweight), only a slight negative effect.  On the label of both Robinson Proucts which I have tested, in fact, are words of warning to be sure "to add extra liquid, if given to toddlers, (and children)".  It is far more economical, and far safer, to follow the directions and add the four parts water for drinking, (and perhaps also cooking), purposes.  The taste is remarkably the same to drinking the concentrate "straight"...and if, like me, you like things extra, extra sweet, a small bit of extra sugar, (mixed with the smallest amount of boilt water, to dissolve), and or artificial sweetener, can be added.<br /><br />This is, as I have said, a non-alcholic drink.  But it is SO very tasty, so VERY satisfying, that it can be served with pride to even those trying to moderate, or eliminate their consumption of alcholic drinks -- or to those who, for religious or other reasons, have decided to foreswear alcholic drinks altogether.  Diluting it to five or six parts water to one part conentrate make it, I think, the perfect treat for children's birthday parties!<br /><br />It's kind of difficul6 to believe that only 8% of this product is from comcntrated Apple Juice, and only 2% is from concentrated Blackcurrant juice.  The front label proclaims, however, that there are "NO Artificial<br />Colours or Flavours" inside, and this is true.  In all, the ingredients listed are: Water.<br />  Fruit jiices from concentrate, (Apple 8%, Blackcurrant 2%)<br />  Glucose-Fructrose syrup<br />  Sugar<br />  Citric Acid<br />  Natural Colour, (Anthocyanins)<br />  Preseratives (Potassium Sorbate,<br />  Sodium Metabisulfite)<br />  Acidity Regulator, (Sodium Citrate)<br />  Sweeteners (Aspartame, Saccarine)<br />  Natural Flavouring<br /><br />  CONTAINS A SOURCE OF PHENYLALANINE.<br /><br />All in all, a pretty good label -- especially these days.  NOT entirely natural...but with ingredients found in many other soft drinks, none of which taste quite this good!<br /><br />...................................................................<br /><br />"I can't believe how good they are!"  This is how my sister, visiting my mother and I in New York from her home in Denver, described her first taste of GUYLIAN Belgian Chocolate sea-shells, (also for sale here on Amazon!)  I suppose this was her way of saying "Scrumtuutious"!  Either way, this also describes the delectable, wonderful taste of ROBINSON'S<br />APPLE & BLACKCURRENT.  Five stars....and, (as the company has been in business sine 1823), a Hundred and Eight-Six "Cheers!"

review/summary: Like clockwork
review/text: I use these twice a year on my two live oaks.  My neighbor had two live oaks planted at the same time I did.  After 6 years, the difference is incredible.  Our tree trunks are almost twice the circumference as the neighbors and the tips all have leaves.  Their trees tend to shed their leaves at the tips during the winter.  The only drawback is the bright green grass that appears in patches where they are in the ground. Looks weird compared to the rest of my yard... Maybe I will put them all over the yard to minimize the effect.  Also would recommend getting some sort of easy plugging tool to pull out a plug of earth before dropping them in the ground.

review/summary: Shrubs Turn Back to Green!
review/text: I purchased a house about 9 months ago that had very little TLC done for the landscaping.  Many of the shrubs were not prunned and were looking very unhealthy.  After prunning them, I noticed that it didn't take much to reveal the dry brown dead material beneath the healthy vegetation...and I didn't remove much of the healthy stuff.  I planted about 2-3 spikes per shrub around about 2 feet away from the trunk, and after a few months, the shrubs have really come back to a very natural and healthy appearance.  Many of the sparce sections have filled in, and they have become noticeably more dense.  I would suggest taking something rigid to make a hole with before putting these into the ground.  Depending on the time of year and the hardness of your soil, enough pressure can cause them to snap in half.  Not that it is a problem...you just make a 3-4 inch hold and put both halves back in.  I'll definately be using these next year.

review/summary: Almost killed my tree
review/text: I was duped by this product in a shiny, pretty package that is labeled "for all trees".  I placed FEWER of these spikes than was even recommended and a month later the leaves on the oak tree we planted when my daughter was born turned BROWN.  Now, several months later, a good 1/3 of the tree is brown and after consulting a plant nursery owner I have found out that it was the Miracle Grow Fertilizer Spikes that is burning my tree.  I have tried to find them to dig them up but by now they are all but dissolved.<br /><br />The nursery owner actually recommends no Miracle Grow products because they are a one size fit all approach with no regard to your climate or soil type.  It's one thing to use them on houseplants that are in similar environments but another to put them on plants outside in your unique environment.  Also, we had a soil test that showed extremely high levels of phosphorous in the soil.  The reason for this?  Years and years of Miracle Grow by the previous owner.  Phosphorous doesn't leach out of the soil so it just builds up and up with repeat applications.<br /><br />DON'T buy this product unless you have consulted a knowledgeable plant or landscape person first.  Hopefully my tree will survive this debacle.

review/summary: The only review you'll need to read
review/text: Just bought a brand new home and the landscaping was bare (very new bushes, shrubs, and tree) and I had a family member recommend these miracle gro spikes so I decided to give them a try. I followed the directions as stated on the packaging and what do you know... they work. Their are other brand new homes on our street and I am using their homes as comparison to our bushes since they are the same bushes, shrubs, and trees (due to HOA) and within a year our bushes have almost bloomed fully (they have red berries on them and cover more area than before), the shrubs that we have died (dug under them and noticed they weren't in full clay/mud there were huge rocks beneath them covering them from any contact with clay due to horrible landscaping that came with home), and as for the tree... it still looks the same. Our whole neighborhood came with automatic sprinkler systems but i've read online that trees need a lot of water to grow. I have noticed that other trees in our neighborhood look the same if not worse than ours so maybe with a hose and a lot of water on the tree in the middle of the front yard the spikes will kick in but I'll see within time. Other neighbor's bushes still look bare so i know these do work. I'll be buying more when the time comes (you can only put a certain amount of spikes for certain plant life shrubs, bushes, trees etc and it recommends to do this in intervals stated on the directions on the packaging. I definately recommend this product

My purchase arrived wrapped in bubble wrap and in pristine condition.It also arrived earlier than anticipated. I have been loving the crisp goodness all over again of the best Birch Beer on the market. I have shared my Polar Birch Beer with a few people who announced that " I don't like that pink stuff. I don't like Birch Beer." Every one of them is a new convert and will be ordering the beverage through Amazon.

It's really fun!<br /><br />I followed the directions that came along and after 5 days in my fridge, a soak and daily misting x1 week, I have a handful of mushrooms ready for harvest. I didn't experience any of the problems that other reviewers had, it might be the humid Vermont spring air, but these things are growing like crazy.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this as a gift for a mushroom lover, science nerd, or anyone who likes to grow things- My Dad will be getting one for Christmas.<br /><br />It does take up some space in your fridge during it's dormant stage (think: 8lb whole chicken big), and you need a space for it that is out of direct sunlight, away from heat sources for it to grow. It should come with the caveat that the box needs to be opened within 30 days, important piece of info if you are planning on gifting.

review/summary: Beware of expiration!
review/text: Be aware that nowhere on the website does it say that this item must be opened and used within 30 days.  However, that information was printed on the box so when I received it I called the company to determine if that 30 days is simply a "recommended to be used by" date (I wanted to give it as a Christmas gift).  They informed me that while there could possibly be a 5-7 day "grace" period, the 30-day limit is pretty firm.  The company will not refund or exchange this item. I'm sure this is a good product but be sure you are planning to open and start it growing immediately.

review/summary: grew when I was ready to throw it out
review/text: I actually purchased this some months ago, and followed the directions for about 1-2 months, misting it constantly even putting it in the fridge to try and encourage growth.  I got absolutely nothing.  So I gave up hope and let it sit in it's open bag and didn't mist it, and when I was ready to throw it out, after leaving it alone for about a month, I noticed it had tiny mushrooms.  In total I have about six mushrooms, both on the sides of the log.

review/text: Ok, I thought I was a little lame for buying a mushroom growing kit, but I really wanted to know if I had what it took to grow mushrooms myself.  Nature does it great, me, my thumb isnt so green.  After following the directions and seeing the mushrooms start forming, then growing into the mushrooms we know and love, it felt great!  It was even cooler eating our own home grown mushrooms. It was a confidence booster and worked great!

review/text: I bought this kit several months ago.  It was a lot of bother, and took about 2 months before it produced any mushrooms at all.  Then I got about 9 nice mushrooms--that's it.  Hardly 2-3 lb. as advertised.  It hasn't produced anything since, even though I've carefully followed all the directions.  A good mushroom kit should produce lots of mushrooms and also be easy and fun.  This kit is a dud.  Please don't even bother.

review/text: The company emailed me and let me know that this was back-ordered.  That was nice.  The kits even arrived before some of my other Amazon purchases, which were not back-ordered. My best friend loved it, I gave her one as a birthday-housewarming present.  She is really tough to shop for because she seems to have everything, and buys everything, so I really lucked out finding the perfect gift! She just purchased a condo, and does not get to go out very much these days, so I thought 'fun family project!' However her teenage daughter thought it was "gross"  and didn't want it in the kitchen, so I guess this is a project just for her!  -M. R. ;)

review/summary: Great Product BUT Now Tastes Horrible!
review/text: I've been using Emergen-C for years. It's one of my favorite products - a really wonderful pick-me-up in the late afternoon. I swear by the stuff. Unfortunately, like so many companies that can't leave a good product alone, they have ruined it by changing it to "New Improved Flavor!". The new flavor is absolutely HORRIBLE. I can barely swallow the stuff. I actually needed a water chaser. I don't know why companies always feel the need to "new and improve" products that they know sell well. The new flavor is overpowering and has an artificial aftertaste that lasts for at least half an hour. I am so sad about this because it's a long-time favorite and I will not be buying it any more because it's nearly impossible for me to swallow, even with my nose plugged. I wish they would bring back the old flavor, which had a less harsh, real raspberry flavor.

review/summary: Never leave home without it!
review/text: I am an avid fan of Emergen-C. I do my best to get in 2 a day. I started taking them when I was on a new diet. I was going to a clinic and the nurses recommended them to ensure that I got all of my daily vitamins. Your body absorbs vitamins much more this way rather than taking the huge horse pills. The clinic also recommend them to help curb headaches. I was giving up my beloved 'Diet Coke' and this was the only thing that made it possible. Plus the B vitamins really boost your metabolism.<br />These are also great when you feel a cold coming on. They really help to boost your immune system. I never leave home without Emergen-C! I always have a stash in my purse!<br /><br />I've liked all of the flavors I have tried so far. I love mixing them with Crystal light or something similar. With the Raspberry I mix this with the Lemonade Crystal Light and made it Raspberry Lemonade. It's delicious. I've also put it in with Diet Sprite and it was very good.

review/summary: Beware: they have "improved" the flavor
review/text: I was so disgusted and disappointed by the company's changes to the raspberry flavor, I was compelled to write to them. This is what I ultimately submitted:<br />You HAVE to know how absolutely horrible the "new Improved" raspberry flavor is, and the fact that you all put "new AND IMPROVED" on the box shows a complete lack of ethics. YOU HAVE TO KNOW THIS ALREADY. The flavor does not even REMOTELY resemble the flavor of a raspberry. Please for the love of God, just change the name of this abomination to "berry", as it is insulting to raspberries. I want my money back. I want the previous version back. But how would you market that? How do you go back after saying "new and improved"?  Perhaps try, "we are sorry, we were trying to cut costs and it turned out to be a horrible horrible mistake. We've insulted your intelligence with a marketing cliche knowing full well that, while it was indeed NEW, that it most certainly was not an improvement. At least not to you, the consumer."<br />Does it sound like I making a big deal over something seemingly so unimportant? IT'S THAT BAD.

review/summary: Agreed: New & Improved flavor = horrid
review/text: Like the other reviewer, I've been using raspberry Emergen-C for almost 5 years. Loved it, used it constantly and the results are good. BUT this 'new and improved' flavor is horrible. There's no other way to describe it. The early version was mild and fizzy; the newer one is very bitter and has a rank aftertaste.<br /><br />They had it right, I think they won over a lot of customers with the original flavor and then they messed it up. Fortunately, I found another product that has similar ingredients with a really good flavor.<br /><br />It's a shame...lots of companies end up losing their original customers as they go through growing phases. Try it yourself if you don't believe me. Bitter, sour aftertaste that you can't get out of your mouth. And a 'chemical' type taste to it. Almost as if there was something wrong with the batch.<br /><br />Emergen-C: Return to the original raspberry flavor and you can have a customer back. Keep this version and there's absolutely no reason for me to purchase your product anymore.

review/text: I am a long time user of Emergen-C, especially the Raspberry flavor. I used it everyday and swore by the product. I was always recommending it to others to try it out.

I wish companies would just leave well enough alone. I haven't compared the ingredients between the two, but I've heard there is more unhealthy stuff in the new flavor and that is unacceptable. The last thing I need is to add extra junk to my diet when I'm trying to ward off illness. It's really too bad...for everyone! :(

review/summary: Better than Airborne or  Zicam
review/text: I'm surprised there aren't more reviews on this GREAT product.<br /><br />I used to take Airborne or Zicam whenever I felt a cold or flu coming on, but now I reach for the Emergen-C. This standard variety Emergen-C isn't even marketed as an immune builder, but it sure seems to work better at staving off illness than products targeted specifically for that purpose. Even if I end up getting sick anyway, it's nearly always a milder case than what the people around me are suffering. If I could just train myself to take this once or twice daily instead of when I'm already under attack, I'd probably never get sick.<br /><br />The bonus is that Emergen-C tastes MUCH better than the two above products (especially Zicam's nasty hours-long aftertaste - blecch!) and is quicker and less messy than Airborne. Plus, you get a lot more Emergen-C for your money than you do with the others. I like the two flavors that come in the big box of Emergen-C that I get at a discount club - tangerine and raspberry. The raspberry is particularly tasty.<br /><br />Some time ago, my sister-in-law started giving a pack a day of Emergen-C to my 4-year-old nephew, who was ALWAYS sick, and now he rarely catches anything. My SIL told me about Emergen-C, and now I recommend it to afflicted friends and acquaintances every chance I get. Thank you, SC (you know who you are!), and thank you, Emergen-C!

review/text: I just had my first packet of the "new and improved" raspberry. Firstly, it was SICKENLY sweet.  I got it down, but was dumfounded by the sweetness.  Then the aftertaste began, and 1/2 and hour later, I'm feeling woozy, almost nauseated.  It seems like they have dramatically increased the fructose and other sweetners (perhaps in an attempt to make it taste more like soda, rather than the previous refreshing tartness), but they have failed abysmally.  It was so bad that I went online to see if others have had the same experience.  Looks like it's universal.  I will do practically anything to avoid another taste of this and am hesitant to buy any of their other products now. Feh.

review/summary: I swear by Emergen-C!
review/text: I've been buying Emergen-C for over 10 years now. It used to only be available at health food stores so I am happy to see it on amazon.com. I have warded off many colds because of it, and I consider it a miracle product. The 1,000 mg of vitamin C per packet is awesome and effective; and the flavors are all pretty good, my favorite being raspberry. What's great about Emergen-C is it's relatively inexpensive and it's fast working. If I wake up and feel drained, I drink a glass of it and it gives me a real energy boost. For years I took capsuled vitamins and wondered why I still felt tired and lethargic. The liquid vitamin is amazing because it works so quickly and efficiently within the body. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to feel good and stay healthy.

review/text: I have difficulties with drinking plain water. This lightly flavors the water, it also gives you some vitamins and has very low calories. I have several boxes with different flavoring. It's easy to travel with few pockets for handy use. I also used to keep them in my drawer at work. I like Emergen-C.

review/summary: Tasty, satisfying, good long-term!!
review/text: I'm a HUGE fan of Emergen-C. I started taking it regularly in 2005. Over the past few years, I began to take it every day in the morning. The raspberry is really tasty- not so much the other flavors. I actually crave the vitamin B and tartness in the morning. Also, I've noticed that when I get sick (which has always been a few times a year), my colds are noticeably tamer most of the time; they are less severe and don't last as long. This wasn't the case years ago before I started taking this regularly! It's also a great hangover helper. Just two notes: 1 packet is more than enough of a dosage per day. And for those remarking on it not stirring in so well, it helps to stir it continuously including the last few sips to really blend all the crystals into the water. Love this product!

review/text: Emergen-C is a wonderful and delicious way to get a gram of vitamin C in a good tasting drink.<br />Even Doctor Oz on his show said supplemental vitamin C is good for you and you should take a gram of vitamin C every day.<br />It's so easy, just mix one packet of Emergen-C in 4-6 oz of water, mix it up and enjoy.<br />Emergen-c comes in a wide variety of delicious flavors from lemonaid, to black cherry to tangerine to orange to strawberry and more flavors.

They also help kickstart your day with all of the B-vitamins it has.

review/text: I always find myself getting a little under the weather when traveling.  Maybe it's the airplane air, maybe it's the lack of sleep.  Take these along to help boost my immune system and keep me going.  Honestly, I'm not sure if it's a placebo effect, but I certainly feel better after having one each morning.<br /><br />This flavor is ok.  I'm not really particular about the flavors, honestly.  They all pretty much taste the same to me.  Kind of like a citrus drink with a little bit of "bite" to it.  Not bad, but not exactly sweet.

review/summary: Keeps you hydrated + extra vitamins
review/text: INGREDIENTS (for "raspberry" Emergen-C): fructose, citric acid, raspberry juice powder, malic acid, tapioca maltodextrin, vegetable juice Color, natural flavors, tartaric acid, silica, caramel color, glycine, aspartic acid, cysteine hydrochloride<br /><br />I prefer this raspberry mix as it tastes more "natural" to me.  Also, raspberry juice powder is the third ingredient on the list, which is a good thing.<br /><br />I drink this when I feel like I'm about to catch a cold, and lo and behold, I don't end up with a cold. Of course, this isn't a guarantee that it'd work every time, but I think it helps.  At the very least, it will help to keep you hydrated and give you a good dose of vitamin-c and other vitamins.  This is also quite economical since you get 30 packets in a box.<br /><br />(Tip: if you buy from a merchant other than Amazon, be sure to check the shipping charge, as some merchant has a rather high shipping cost; it would actually be better to buy from a local retailer in that case.)

review/text: Raspberry is my favorite flavor. I hate the Orange/tangerine flavor. These are great if you work with the public & medical field so you don't get ill so often. I like to put a packet into a bottled water, shake it really well, wait a minute, and then drink it. Or you can get the bottles ready and refrigerate them so it taste better cold. Great way to get your vitamin C if you don't have an orange handy.

review/summary: Another Great Emergen-C Flavor but Not My Favorite!
review/text: I've been taking Emergen-C daily for about three months now. Ever since taking this stuff I have not been sick at all. Before meeting Emergen-C I would get sick several times a month. I also take this stuff inbetween meals to keep from being hungry. I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to get out of their sickness faster and prevent sickness from happening.<br /><br />As far as flavors, the Raspberry seems a little weak to me - have to add less water than I do with other flavors to get a sharper effect. My favorite is Lemon-Lime with Super Orange following that. Raspberry and Tangerine are my least favorite due to weakness in flavor. I did not experience a lack of dissolving crystals as other reviewers have mentioned but it may be due to the fact that I pour the packet in first then swirl water in.<br /><br />Definitely recommend this!

review/text: My family has been using Emergen C for years. We were introduced to this product by a Naturopathic Physician to use as a supplement. You just add a packet of the powder to water and drink. Raspberry is our favorite flavor.  The flavor has been changed, I didn't mind the old flavor, but my kids always thought it was sour.  They really like the "new" raspberry flavor, which is a little sweeter. Love that it is available on Amazon at a great price!

review/text: My roomate was getting sick so I thought some emergen-C would really help!  Didn't get it anywhere close to on time.  Ordered this from AmericaRX from amazon prime (2-day shipping) on September 27th.  After some emails, it was eventually shipped on October 14th.  Didn't get it for another week.  I would stay away from this vendor.  I give them two stars because the product was at least what I asked for- although 3 weeks late!<br /><br />About the Emergen-C, this stuff is awesome.  Tastes good and really makes you feel better.  I think raspberry is the best flavor.  I would definitely recommend taking it at the first sign of feeling sick.

review/summary: fructose warning!
review/text: Fructose is #1 on list of "other ingredients"in Alacer's emergen-c drinks--- all of their drinks/flavors have fructose in them. I'm fructose sensitive (actually sensitive to most fruit because of the sugar content & don't drink any kind of fruit juice) I wish Alacer would reformulate this product to be less sweet and substitute real cane sugar or substitute stevia.<br /><br />  From my personal experience, what used to be a problem with  'sub-clinical' hypogylcemia started getting worse.  And my osteopath wanted to know what changed in my eating habits?  I got to thinking, and then realized that for several months, on a weekly basis (not daily),  I was drinking 3-4  Emergen-C drinks (the lemon-lime Lite).  Once I quit this practice, I quit shaking (and being so hungry) between meals.<br />thanks.

review/summary: Great everyday tea
review/text: I have been drinking Good Earth Decaf Green Tea for many years and it is my favorite tea.  This tea is not purely green tea leaves - it also contains lemongrass and other flavors.  It is flavorful but mild.  Ingredients: Decaffeinated Green Tea, Lemongrass, Natural Flavors (Contains Soy Lecithin), Rose Petals and Peppermint.<br /><br />Be aware that the Good Earth Decaf Green Tea does not have the more delicate flavor as real Japanese green tea (and not a roasted flavor like Genmai), but it is great as an everyday tea.  If you are expecting green tea like in Japanese restaurants, this is not it - if you want that, get high quality loose tea leaves and brew it with the correct temperature water in a teapot.  (Although maybe the Good Earth green tea would taste more similar to Japanese green tea if brewed like Japanese green tea should be - read on...)<br /><br />I often leave my tea bag steeping for a long time (I know, not recommended for green tea, but it likely does extract more of the beneficial antioxidants), up to 30 min, and this tea does not get bitter.  It also does not get bitter if the tea sits around before drinking.  One Good Earth tea bag works fine for my large 16 oz mug.  I have found that other brands of tea can be weak and not flavorful if using only one bag for 16 oz water.<br /><br />I also like that this tea is decaf since even the smaller amount of caffeine in green tea affects me.  Decaf green teas are somewhat hard to find.  This company uses a CO2 process for decaffeination, preferable to a solvent extraction process.<br /><br />Note that this product is available in 18-count and 25-count boxes.  My local grocery store has stopped carrying the 25-count and only stocks the 18-count.  I like that Amazon carries the 25-count boxes since I go through a lot of this tea!  It is also a better deal at Amazon.<br /><br />I have tried many other brands of green tea (decaf and regular) over the years and keep coming back to Good Earth brand.  Highly recommended.

Peppermint in my tea is unacceptable and is an important ingredient that should be disclosed.  Shame on you Good Earth.  Because of this, I got a refund from Amazon and will never buy another one of your products online (maybe I'll try you out after I'm able to physically see the box and ingredients myself in a brick & mortar store, but for now you are a big FAIL.)<br /><br />I asked the Amazon rep to please alert Good Earth of this oversight, so if you're reading this and see that they've added the rose petals and peppermint to their list of ingredients, it was done after my call and this review :)

Everywhere we go people comment on how delicious it smells - must be the lemongrass.  We got used to drinking this at one of our local health food restaurants where they serve it with fresh mint sprigs.  So far it's the only green tea we have found that is decaffeinated - great for my husband who is really sensitive to any caffeine.  Totally hooked on this delicious drink.

review/text: Since this product is getting harder and harder to find in local grocery stores, I was very pleased to find it offered here and at a competitive price.  I will keep coming back for order refills as my supply dwindles.

review/summary: Good sugar substitute
review/text: Great product, does what a sweetener should do without becoming cloying or sticky. For those who want to avoid cane sugar, this is the form of saccharine I prefer.

review/summary: NectaSweet 1/4 Grain Sugar Substitute Pellets
review/text: Just reordered this product after first ordering over 2 years ago.  12 bottles takes some time to use -- but there was no deterioration in product quality and the 500 ct. bottle meant unsealed bottles didn't have to be open for months on end.  Many people don't like saccharin because they feel it has an aftertaste.  I find that it is more about the quantity you use.  Most toothpaste is saccharin sweetened but I don't hear people complain about the aftertaste of their toothpaste, probably because the toothpaste manufacturers don't overdo it with the saccharin.  This product works great for sweetening tea and coffee among other beverages. One 1/4 grain tablet is like 1 teaspoon of sugar in sweetness. If you need to sweeten a 1/2 gallon or a gallon of something, adding pellets is way easier than opening a bunch of little packets or even spooning out some other sweetener.  Just pour pellets into the bottle cap and count what you need. For whatever reason, it (any saccharin sweetener) does NOT go well with Kool-Aid brand soft drink mix. It does mix well with Wyler's and Flavor Aid.  For my tastes, I find that 20 of the 1/4 grain pellets sweetens a 2 quart soft-drink packet very well.  If you really feel like you're still getting aftertaste, try 16 pellets and two packets of Splenda.  You can always add more of either NectaSweet or Splenda if you prefer it sweeter. When adding directly to already chilled beverages, give the pellets a minute to dissolve and then stir well.

review/summary: Best Sweetener
review/text: I have tried many sweeteners but the taste of this is consistent and does not leave an aftertaste.  I buy this by the 12 pack case and use it everyday.  The only thing I don't like about it, is that does not dissolve as well in cold drinks.

review/summary: Saccharin sweeter than wine
review/text: I have used Necta Sweet sacharin for decades, and was delighted that I could continue to get this product through Amazon, after my usual sources stopped carrying it.  I prefer its taste to that of any other sugar substitute.

review/summary: Combine this with Equal and it is very tasty
review/text: A trick I learned while living in Europe is that if you combine saccharine (which is what Necta Sweet is) with Equal or some other similar sweetener, the taste is a lot better than either one by itself.  The Germans sold sweeteners that were a combination, and they were remarkably better than what we had here.  You can get the same effect by combining a packet of equal with one of these tablets.

review/summary: How Sweet It Is
review/text: The only thing I use in my morning coffee!  I was having trouble finding this in at the grocery stores. Seems Equal, Sweet & Low, etc. are squeezing out the old reliables.  I was so happy I found this at Amazon.
