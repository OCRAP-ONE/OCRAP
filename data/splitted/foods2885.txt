review/summary: Better than Bigelow's Earl Gray Green
review/text: I was disappointed as I could not taste the bergamot like I can in Twinings Earl Grey. It was much better than Bigelow's Earl Grey Green and there was no bitter aftertaste. Maybe I expected it be more like the original Earl Grey. I was hoping that I'd like it as I would get the green tea benefits with the black tea taste, but the flavor still fell flat for me as it did not have the delicacy of Twinings. I think I'll stick to Salada green tea and keep my black tea Earl Grey. Salada doesn't have that hay like taste or the bitter aftertaste that some green teas have and it's inexpensive. Also, Celestial Seasonings has a Mandarin Orchard green tea that's really good.

review/text: I love green tea, so I am always on the lookout for different varieties.  I really like this tea.  If you let it steep for a while you get a nice taste of the ginger.  This is a great tea to start your morning with or for an afternoon drink.

review/summary: This stuff is awesome
review/text: Seriously, it is so good!  Tea snobs that insist on using a decanter make me laugh.  "Who uses tea bags?", they say.  If you're feeling hip, you could go down to your local shopping mall, go inside a Teavana store, and spend over $100 bucks on a fancy teapot.  Or, you could just buy a stainless-steel electric water heater for $10 and this tea for under $20.  I drink at least 2 cups of the stuff at work.  While it's super easy to screw up a good cup of coffee, it's impossible to screw up a good cup of Stash Early Grey Black and Green!

review/text: I thought I'd finally write a review for others, since I keep coming back to buy this again and again. This black and green chai is my go-to tea, and I enjoy at least a cup or two every single day. I'm happy that Amazon offers it, so every couple of months I can replenish my stash conveniently and inexpensively. My favorite way to drink this tea is piping hot with a generous dollop of local honey. Enjoy!

review/summary: Not green, not good
review/text: This decaf really disappointed me, esp. given the other glowing reviews.  It does not appear green, nor does it taste "green" (ie: doesn't have that fresh "grassy" flavor many describe as found in an authentic Japanese green tea).  Actually, this could be a good paring with seafood, because  I sometimes detect a slight fishiness in the taste.  Yuk.  Stash Decaf Green, the non-organic, non-premium tea, is actually a little better than this one.  What people like is a matter of personal taste, but I won't ever buy this tea again.

review/summary: Cuppa Green
review/text: Like many regular tea drinkers I prefer the loose-leaf variety when I am at home, but the afternoon cuppa at work calls for something a little less complicated.  I am OK with sacrificing flavor for convenience, while saving some pennies at the same time.<br /><br />So far, I have been pleasantly surprised by Stash's brands of Certified Organic green teas.  I have drank both this straight green tea and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDK6">Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey Black and Green Tea</a> combination.  The teas come from the Yamamotoyama Brazilian tea gardens, which were initially planted with Japanese seedlings.  The processing methods and standards are all based on Japanese system.<br /><br />The flavor of this Premium Green Tea is really nice, with a subtle grassy flavor that I enjoy in decent green teas.  I find that too many American-produced green teas are "watered down" in flavor, lacking the oomph that one finds in a true Japanese or Chinese green tea.  This cup, however, is close to the real thing. It also gives off a nice green color, which is always a good sign.<br /><br />By no means the best tea you will ever drink, but this Premium Green Tea might just possibly the best inexpensive tea-bag style green tea on the market.

review/summary: BEWARE - MADE IN CHINA
review/text: I am so appalled at this finding as my dog has been taking these treats for 8 years, now this explains to me why my dog became so ill back in October 2011 and still no diagnosis as doctors kept pumping me for money and told me all tests were negative. I read previous reviews and had also noticed the chicken and apple treat became a quarter size with a very black chicken wrap and me like a dummy gave it to him anyway. 6 months later of my dog vomiting, bloody diarrhea extreme weight loss we started prednizone as it was the last resort, either that or they wanted to operate saying it was a thickening intestinal wall that was stopping food from passing but couldn't guarantee this would work. I so now in my heart believe is was due to Dogswell products. I started ordering them again just 2 months ago, noticed the treats were back to normal looking like they used to look, thought nothing strange of it and starting giving it to him again but being still on prednizone it's hard to say if any further damage was now done. I am stopping the purchase of these treats and throwing the rest away. I wanna thank the public for your reviews and it has helped me so much understand maybe what has been going on with my baby. Sure enough after reading everything and did a google search I ran downstairs to check my bags and sure enough it said made in CHINA, I nearly passed out, This is a huge eye opener for me and from now on I will be buying only homemade dog treats made from people I know and my treats from stores like "THREE DOG BAKERY" here in Las Vegas, Nevada were I now will know what my dog is getting. This country has purely gone to shit and this sickens me that my baby suffered due to greed once again. Let's fight back and NEVER EVER buy anything with the label "MADE IN CHINA" I don't care what it is or how great a deal it is, this must be stopped some how as it seems everything is being made in China, please help the fight, you and your dogs life depends on it. Thanks again for the reviews and concerns of the caring people out there.

review/text: I've purchased the 3 types of treats thru Subscribe and Save.  They are no longer supplied by Amazon and I am not surprised. You can still obtain them from other vendors on Amazon.  Be aware they look nothing like the product pictured. The quality has deteriorated and is now poor at best. The apple treats are now nickel sized pieces of apple(more like little sponges)and the chicken strip around the apple is nearly black in color. It is beyond hard. Whats with this?  The ingredients state this is supposed to be chicken breast!  BEWARE-THESE TREATS ARE MADE IN CHINA!!  I cringe to think what may have been substituted.<br /><br />There was no notice by Amazon that these came from China-known for manufacturing deadly dog products.  I would never have purchased them. I suggest you don't either.  My dog no longer eats them.  I have nearly $100 of product.  I can't with a good conscience donate these to the animal shelter or even toss them out for the crows. Inquire as to the country of origin before you buy - "distributed by" doesn't count.  There are many other safe and healthy treats available and they proudly state 'made in America'!

review/summary: MADE IN CHINA!!!
review/text: I bought these for my Dalmatian for the first time about a month ago. He LOVED them...so much that even though I only gave him the recommended amount per day for his weight class he STOPPED EATING HIS FOOD.<br /><br />I went in to Petco and spoke with a customer service rep who told me a couple of people had come in with similar experiences. He said he was personally curious about it and did some research online and pulled up some reviews (which we looked up together while I was in the store) of people with the same issue. We discovered Dogswell now makes this product in China. Whether or not that automatically makes it unsafe I don't know but given the other reviews and the sign from my own dog I am no longer willing to risk it. Do some research - google "Dogswell made in china" and decide for yourself.

review/summary: Dodger Loves It!
review/text: On occasion, my daughter and son-in-law will go away and leave their Shitsu (Dodger) with us for a few days visit.  When that happens he seems to come with all the material things that help make him happy.  That includes a large jar of assorted treats. Sometimes I'd wonder why they're called treats because he often doesn't get excited by any of the many varieties that jar contains.  I mentioned this to my daughter and she referred me to this product. We ordered it (from Amazon) on his last visit and I was amazed at how quickly he accepted and consumed them when offered. Unlike others which he might shun or sometimes take and may not actually eat, the Happy Hips treats were always eaten right away. Both Dodger and I rate this product as a "buy now".

review/summary: Chewy veggie bliss!
review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered these.  I knew my dog liked sweet potatoes and because I've been buying Dogswell Happy Hips brand treats for years I thought we'd give it a try.  Here's the skinny:<br /><br />They are smaller than the other treats.  This is because they are pieces of dried sweet potato with chicken wrapped around them!  This makes them a bit chewy and thus should work well to aid in the daily cleansing of your dog's teeth.  There is no unpleasant odor, nor is there an oily or greasy residue.  They are the same high quality treats we've become accustomed to buying from Dogswell.  Our dog LOVES them and we'll be buying them again in the future as they are a nice change from the "meat" jerky varieties she has been eating for years.  Next time we'll try apple!

review/summary: Another favorite snack of my dogs
review/text: For them, they just like how they taste.  For me, I like the fact that they have the glucosamine added to them, and that they are just very basic food, chicken and sweet potato.  I would have given this 5 stars if it was made in the US.  I'll probably always, now, be somewhat suspicious of any pet foods or snacks that are made in any part in China.  My older dog is very creaky and arthritic, and so far we haven't found anything that helps ease her pain, so I can't attest to the healing properties of the glucosamine/chondroitin in these snacks, but I figure it can't hurt to feed her foods that contain them.

review/text: Dogswell brand treats are the best I have found. After the gluten scare I searched for natural ingredients treats and found these which he loves. Even though they are made in china they are continually tested here in the US for quality control and have always passed. My dog has alergies and with two basic ingrediants I don't have to worry. He is also a picky eater when it comes to treats and he takes these every time.

review/summary: Our Dog Loves These Treats
review/text: Our vet told us to switch our dog to a treat that contained ingredients he hadn't had on a regular basis because we're working to determine what is producing an itchy allergic reaction.  So far it looks like he may be allergic to chicken and maybe corn, neither is in this treat.  Amazon has a better price on this than any other place that carries them. The only problem we have is now the dog tends to "guard" the hall chest where we keep the treats and gaze hopefully at anyone walking through.  :-)<br /><br />Our dog has been getting them for about a month.  While puppy-sitting, I also gave the same treat to my Mom's dog and my brother's dog.  They both went nuts for the treat too.  I'll admit that's not exactly a discriminating audience (they aren't finicky dogs) but it seems to be quite popular.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00141OWXU">Dogswell Veggie Life Vitality Sweet Potato Chew Treats for All Dogs, 5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)</a>A year ago these treats were perfect and my pooch loved them, "just what the doctor ordered". HOWEVER, the recent shipments have been of inferior quality, poor quality. The product is dried-up and as far as my dog is concerned, unacceptable. She refuses to eat the treats and walks away from them. While the expiration date is in 2012 the product has to be tossed, it is anything but fresh.<br /><br />What illuminates this even more is that the local pet store is now stocking these treats. At the pet store, the products look and are soft and well managed and loved by the pooch. Clearly the treats from the AMAZON vendor is without quality and may have been rejects.<br /><br />While the cost in the pet store is much higher, it is well worth it.  Proves that you get what you pay for. If  it is 'Happy Hips' that your dog likes go the pet store or perhaps AMAZON will find a quality supplier.

I love the fact that these are all natural and my only complaint is that it was a little pricey (over $7 per bag) and a little difficult to find.  Well, amazon took care of that!

review/summary: Dogs love them but ... seems to make them sugar high?
review/text: I have two young dogs, a dachshund (1yr) and  a chihuahua (6mths).  I use these to crate train them.  This treat seems to cause them to be overly excited and even after eating, they would go to extremes to try to get more.  Good motivator.  But I am not sure if it's the natural sugar from the banana. I have many different treats for them before but this treat seems to make them super "high" and they had to race many laps in the yard to get off that energy.  Maybe someone who has the same experience can comment on this observation.  Overall, I am satisfied with the price of the item.  I wish the pieces were a little smaller since they are about a quarter size (too big for my small dogs). Recommended not more than 2 pcs a day for small dog under 20lbs.

review/summary: A FAVORITE Treat!
review/text: My Bichon has to have eye drops twice a day and she hates the procedure, so I looked for a treat that she could look forward to after the treatment.  This is it.  Both my dogs absolutely love these treats and they're large enough to cut in two, thereby doubling the package.  One Bichon and one Havenese give these treats two thumbs up!

review/summary: My golden can't get enough of these
review/text: I have been buying these for awile now for my older golden retriever for two reasons; the glucosamine in them and something less fattening and better tasteing than milk bones.  He just loves these.  They look good and smell good.  As soon as I open the package, he is there waiting.  He seems more active and I am hoping with the glucosamine in these and other glucosamine supplements I give him it helps his arthritis.  Amazon has good prices on these and with ther occasional promotions and free shipping their price can't be beat.

review/summary: My dogs won't eat this!
review/text: My dogs love the Dogswell supplements made from chicken, so I assumed they'd also like the sweet potato supplements.  Neither of them would eat it!  Even my aggressive chewing lab didn't like these.  They're almost impossible to chew (unless I soak them in boiling water for at least 30 minutes, which presumably would leech the nutrients from the chews).  When the lab first tried these, they cut her gums, and when she would leave pieces of the chew on the floor, if I stepped on them before noticing them, they'd cut my foot!  I noticed this about ALL the varieties of Dogswells Sweet Potato Chews.  I threw them all out.

review/summary: Great Substitute for Freebirds Chicken Apple Wedges When You Can't Find Them.
review/text: Our dogs love the Freebird chicken apple wedges, but the economic two-pound bag is too hard to find since I purchased them at here-today-gone-tomorrow Costco.  The small bags are a bit pricey BUT they're not made in China.  My brother always insisted that we only buy dog food made in the USA when we had our three labs.  Now I have a beagle and a blue heeler with my guy, and we are always trying to treat them for good behavior.  I found and buy these at Petco.  The bag has more content than the usual packs of Freebirds, and they like them as well, but I didn't realize until reading other reviewer comments where they came from.  Filled with condroitin and glucosamine for the mature dog with hip problems (the blue heeler), I thought I'd give them a try.  Though I don't see any distinct improvement in our 12 year-old Sydney's hips, I don't see anything detrimental either.  They come to the cupboard after coming in from outside or a bath just as before and gobble them down like a kid with candy.  The China factor makes me a little uneasy, especially at that price, but I see no ill effects thus far.  I asked my vet today what she thought, and she said that they're probably fine as long as they're not recalled, but the laws in China are less strict about what they put in their products.  It makes me wonder if I want to risk my dogs being a recall factor if that should happen, so use your own judgement.  All I know is that my own canines love them, and others here seem to have no problem with them either.

review/summary: Happy Hips makes happy dog
review/text: My granddog stayed with me while my son was deployed to Afghanistan, and I found these special treats for her. They seemed unique, and healthy, so I gave them a try. She loves them! I only give her one a day, after dinner as dessert. She knows what that word means, and will whine if I wait too long to give it to her. She is an older dog, and does have some joint issues, so I really like that these treats have glucosamine and chondroitin. Who knew that dogs like apples!

He'll turn his nose up at filet mignon, but will wolf down a Snausage!  Of course I would rather he eat something somewhat healthy and I have bought many 15 oz. bags of Happy Hips treats through local merchandisers for around $18.99 a bag (plus tax).  Comes to a little over $20 a bag.  Three 15 oz. bags through Amazon with shipping - around $35, vs. three 15 oz. bags through local retailers - over $60.  Same great product - do the math.

review/summary: Treats were stale
review/text: The Dogswell Happy Hips Sweet Potato Chews I bought from Amazon were stale.  I have bought these before, in local stores, and they are supposed to be pliable and "chewy".  Although the bags had expiration dates that were in code, each bag I opened, contained "stale" chews.  They broke like crackers and I could hear my dog chomping on them like a bone.  I buy them so I can bend them over and put them in her toys or bones - she can spend a lot of time trying to get at the "treat".  With these, all I could do was feed them to her like snack crackers.  I was very disappointed.  I will continue to buy them, as they are a good product, just not from Amazon.

I emailed the company and they told me that they had already tested it in a lab and it was found to be starch, which occurs naturally on sweet potatoes. But I still feel uneasy about giving it to my dogs. Why wouldn't they post this info on the bags then?????

review/text: I don't like premade soups or powdered soups, but I found this at a local store on sale and I needed emergency food for the pantry. Running low on time this evening, I pulled this out of the pantry and hoped for the best.<br /><br />This soup was wonderful, beyond belief. I was stunned. Everyone loved it. Even my S.O. who hates peas, slurped down a large bowl of this stuff.<br /><br />After you get the water boiling, it only takes 15 minutes. The soup is thick and rich with an awesome sicilian flavor. This stuff tastes better than my homemade pea soup that I slave over.<br /><br />We enjoyed it so much, I'm now ordering a bunch from Amazon. Even the grocery store sale price isn't as good as the Amazon price. I'm thrilled to see it here.

review/summary: Amazing stuff
review/text: Want a fast, easy, yet satisfying soup? This stuff beats everything. Tastes like something you've been cooking all day - as good as or better than the best I've had in restaurants. Add meat if you like, otherwise it's perfect right out of the bag.<br /><br />You can tell the manufacturer knows how special their product is, by the way. The heavy, insulated packaging materials are clearly designed to preserve the aroma of the ingredients. Just lovely stuff. Buy some and see!<br /><br />PS: Another commenter mentioned the saltiness of the soup. I'm not getting that, but I'd bet it's a question of the water/soup mix ratio. "Too salty" probably means it was cooked too long, or as I say too much mix was in the water. Thing is, many people think pea soup should be, er, 'as thick as pea soup'. But I'd err on the 'thin' side with this soup. (Same goes for clam chowder. Many people think it needs to be thick. But the best chowder I ever had was no thicker than any other soup. Thickness is easier to achieve than good flavor, so many purveyors of pea soup or clam chowder err on the side of chunkiness.)

review/text: I make fabulous homemade split pea soup----even, with sherry, to serve for company.  NEVER have I been able to tolerate any  commercial brands before.  But here I am.....old, alone with my dog, and unwilling or unable to cook anything for long periods of time.  And, rats!! I love split pea soup.  The first time I tried Alessi's, I added nothing!!  I expected a dreary, possibly-OK taste to which I would add carrots, ham, and other things to make it tolerable.  What a surprise....this soup is delicious, prepared directly from the package's directions.  The first time Chablis (my dog who likes soup)  and I tasted a bowl, the soup was of normal soup-like consistency.....even the unexpected salad macaroni added texture...and the flavor needed nothing!  After the first bowl,however, the soup becomes very thick, so I added a bit of cream and a tablespoon of sherry and voila!  I had split pea soup like I used to make--only with hours less preparation time.  I will never be without Alessi Split Pea soup again.

review/text: I had been using Alessi Soups for years, and then learned that some of the markets were no longer carrying the product.  I was lost without them, and decided to check on Amazon.  I was delighted to find the full line of these great soups.<br /><br />I really don't have a single favorite...they are all wonderful.  I often add something like pulled pork or ham to the pea, bean and lentil soups which makes them even richer.  I'd really be lost if they were no longer available.  I add some chicken legs (and escarole)to their chicken soup making it even more delicious. (I also add a pinch of my favorite herbs). In each case,I add a little extra water(and cooking time)to compensate for the extra ingredients. You can use your own tastes and ideas to add to these wonderful soups. These soups are great on their own, but if you are a cook (of sorts) you might enjoy experimenting...like I do.  These products are a wonderful time-saver for the busy homemaker!
