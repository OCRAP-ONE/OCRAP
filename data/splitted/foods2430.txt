review/text: Along with everyone else, may I say THANK YOU for carrying Aromat!  I was so shocked to find out Knorr wasn't importing it anymore and it's been a nightmare trying to find it at a reasonable price.  I discovered it as a 17-year-old exchange student and have enjoyed it ever since (close to 40 years, gulp!).

review/summary: Aromat Seasoning
review/text: I have been using this product for years.  It is wonderful to use in a lamb marinade or in pasta sauces.  I also use it in salads and with tomatos and olive oil. I use it in everything. This seasoning is available everywhere in Europe.  Your price is outstanding as usally it is much more.  I buy the case and use it for stocking stuffers or for hostess gifts. Once one knows about it---you can not get along without it, but it is very difficult to find.

review/summary: Great seasoning
review/text: My Swiss friends introduced this product to me on a trip to their vacation home in Tahoe.  They both grew up with Aromat as a seasoning for everything.  On my night to cook for the group I liberally sprinkled it on the burgers before grilling and they were a HIT.  My local grocery stores don't carry it so I turned to Amazon.com.  Now I use it on everything. Aromat adds an extra layer of flavor that enhances but doesn't overpower.  I use it just like salt.

review/summary: A way to enhance your flavor
review/text: I spent a year in Switzerland and fell in love with this product.  I even bought a lot and packed it for my return to the states.  Once I ran out I was upset.  So, now that Amazon has it available I am happy again.<br /><br />This is a season salt product.  So if you are not a season salt fan this may not be for you.  But keep in mind that it is a more refined flavor than the average season salt product available in the US.  It has porcini mushrooms in it... that should at least peak your interest.<br /><br />I use it in almost any savory dish.  Sometimes instead of salt, but often as well as salt.  It will not replace your pepper or garlic or other spices that you love.  It is just a way to enhance the flavor of your food.<br /><br />I say try it.  You might just like it.  Look at all the people that have searched for this product for years and are now finally satisfied.

review/text: If you've ever wanted that "missing ingredient" this is it! My family is addicted to this seasoning and when I'm getting low on it I start going through withdrawal until I replenish. For salads and vegetables Aromat Seasoning is the ultimate seasoning. It is basically great on almost any dish and only a small amount is needed. It's so hard to find in the stores though, so having found it on Amazon (actually my son found it), has made stocking it so much easier now. We love this seasoning.  P.S. My son is in the military and when he was deployed, I would send him goody/necessity boxes and would always throw in several canisters of this seasoning for a "taste of home"!!

review/text: I was so excited to see the Aromat for sale on line!!  I used to be able to buy it in several local stores but have not found it recently. I have asked the stores to order it in the past but they can't get it any longer. I found it in a German bakery but they stopped carrying it also.  A friend got me hooked on Aromat when she gave me some when she came back from Switzerland...where it originated.  Since it will expire before I could use 12 cans, I will share with my friends.  I use the seasoning in potato salad, chicken salad & chicken stew.  It is a little salty & just adds great flavor to these & other dishes.  I will be heartbroken if you stop carrying it!!  Please don't!!

My whole family uses it now that they are on their own.<br /><br />I have introduced my friends to it, when I have them over for dinner and they ask what the misterious, tasty flavor is that enhances the meal I fixed.

review/text: Aromat is like no other seasoning.  I give out my recipes to others and invariably they will say, "This just doesn't taste like yours!"  It's the Aromat!!  You can tell when it is missing in a food item.  I use it for sauces, for dressings, for meat, for vegetables, for salads, anything that uses salt.  It seasons without adding too much of a salty taste.<br />I have used Aromat for years and one 3-oz container just empties too fast.  I tried to find the restaurant size - and I did.  You can purchase the big 2# can at Euro-Pacific Imports in OKC, OK.

review/summary: Aromat PRICE GONE WILD
review/text: This is my all-time favorite spice; we call it "secret weapon" around our kitchen.  We use it profusely.  Last time I bought this was in September of 2009, 3 flats for a total of 36 pieces.  I was about to reorder today and notice the price has gone through the roof, i.e., there has been a WHOPPING TWENTY-FOUR PERCENT INCREASE.  So I checked other websites which sell the individual, 3 oz. shakers.  Those prices are unchanged.  Next on the agenda:  check the Euro/dollar exchange rate.  In September of 2009, the simple average for the month was ~145 which is ~ where the Euro/dollar is trading now.  Mentioning the exchange rate, though, is only meant for purposes of example  Because Aromat is manufactured by Unilever which is a huge multinational corporation.  Therefore I am ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN that they have currency hedges in place to avoid wild price fluctuations such as an ungodly 24%. Bottom line:  THERE IS NO REASON FOR THE PRODUCT ITSELF TO HAVE HAD ANY WHERE NEAR THIS PRICE MOVE.  So I am going to chalk this up to increased shipping costs, noting that what used to be "1 day shipping" and "2 day shipping" are now more like 2 and 3-day, respectively.  On top of that, the #3.99 flat fee for what used to be true 1 day shipping was modified about a year ago to be #3.99 PER ITEM additional shipping even if they ship in the same box.  I also understand that signing up for regular, repeat shipping of an item does not "LOCK" the price in for the duration.  Amazing.  These not-so-subtle changes over time tell me that we can expect more of the same across the board.  And as consumers, we have to make hard choices. Because next on the agenda, the States will likely push for taxes.  Add that on top of the wildly escalating cost of shipping and it won't make sense for me to do so much on-line shopping because convenience can only offset so much of the cost. And that threshold is approaching fast. I am now exploring ordering this item in bulk directly from Europe.  It used to be available here in 2.2 lb. packages (1 kilogram)but that was discontinued.  However, they still package it like that all over Europe ... and Asia in the large size.  No more Amazon on this one!  Very, very unfortunate.

review/summary: Avoid the Granny Smitth Apple Coffee Cake ... Unless you Like to eat Mold
review/text: Do not waste your money on the Granny Smith Apple Coffee-Cake version, unless you like to eat mold! Just so you know, you won't easily be able to detect the mold except by taste. It shows up adjacent to the apples, and in the cinnamon strip in the center of the cake.<br /><br />The one star that I had to give Granny Smith Apple Coffee-Cake in my review was merited, however. I did not get sick from eating some of a piece of the coffee cake ... the phenolic flavor of which caused me to pull apart the cake, and identify that gray fuzziness which hallmarks mold. No diarrhea. No puking. Well worth one star.<br /><br />My story. The week after Thanksgiving (2009), I received one of the Granny Smith Apple Coffee-Cakes as a gift from my aunt. According to the label, she had purchased it the first week of November 2009 at Walter Reed Hospital (military) commissary. After detecting the mold, I resealed it in its packaging material, what the company describes as a reusable freezer bag. I placed it in my freezer, including the outer box, anticipating sending it back to the company for examination.<br /><br />A note about the packaging. When I first opened the coffee cake's box, the inner (reusable freezer) bag conformed tightly with the cake, and the tape sealing the bag was undisturbed. While the flyer included with the coffee cake advises that the product is stable for up to a year, I believe this could be overly optimistic if the mold eats cake quickly. On the bright side, as the mold progresses, it's likely to become more visible during the course of a year.<br /><br />Know that if you don't heed my warning you're on your own. The company will not stand by their product. When I called their 'customer service' number, the woman advised me to return it to the military commissary where my aunt purchased it. Not being in the military, I can not get on the facility within which the commissary is located. Further, I'm not the boorish type, so the idea of returning the gift to my aunt as inedible was not an option.<br /><br />As we spoke, the customer service woman asked me 'if I had a problem with Campbell's soup would I call Campbell's soup, or take the soup back to the grocery store?' I'd get in touch with Campbell's about defective soup ... if for no other reason than to allow them to recall the product. Bottom line, she could no nothing for me as I had not bought the coffee cake directly from My Grandma's.<br /><br />When I related to the customer service woman that I would endeavor to communicate my dissatisfaction with the Granny Smith Apple Coffee-Cake, and their customer service, to the extent that I was able, she put me on hold. Twice she came back on the line, asking me to continue to hold ... advising that held calls could only stay on hold for a short while. The call disconnected after this.  There was no discussion on either of our parts with respect to the desired resolution. My only option for the moldy Granny Smith Apple Coffee-Cake was to return it.<br /><br />With natural foodstuffs, especially those not chock-full of preservatives, it seems likely that problems might crop up every now and again. I would've been content to ship the coffee-cake back to them (at their cost) to let their experts determine what was wrong, how it likely happened, and whether or not a recall was indicated ... after which I would've hoped for a replacement coffee cake.<br /><br />The crappy customer service ensured this didn't transpire.

review/text: :: English Toffee Flavored Liquid Stevia ::<br /><br />Amazing how intensely rich this is!<br /><br />It totally tastes like sweet english toffee. How thay accomplish so much flavor in these zero cal little droplets, that's a voodoo mystery to me. My one complaint is that they don't give any hints of their tricks to get the english toffee flavor. I know that stevia is already magic in itself for its sweetness power, but wondered about how they managed to get the strong english toffee swing in there. On package label, all they have to say, basically, is "Natuarl flavors". Unfortunately staying more secretive than I'd have preferred. But I can forgive them that one decision. Since overall: this stuff is a great treat, while leaving your conscience clean on matters of substances in the body.<br /><br />Ultimate Summertime Cappuccino:<br /><br />  - Good quality roast coffee, chilled<br />  - Soy milk (frothed, if frother handy)<br />  - Liquid stevia. English toffee flavor for total indulgence!<br />  - Serve over ice

review/text: I wholeheartedly agree with the other reviews (why didn't I hurry and rate this as soon as I got mine a few weeks ago??)! I ordered the Chocolate Raspberry, the Lemon Drop, and this one, the English Toffee. I was used to buying the same brand in the packets of powder, but the health food store was charging like $8 a bottle. The prices here on Amazon is VERY reasonable. I love the Lemon Drop one in my herbal teas, and this English Toffee seems to work better in the coffee. For a nice rich "mouth feel" (like cream but without the bad calories) try cold-pressed Coconut oil, also available here on Amazon. It's amazing what it does for coffee!! I'm trying to cut back on the soymilk because of excess estrogen level issues, and the cocoanut oil in my coffee combined with these WONDERFL Stevia flavors - I don't miss the soy milk at all, let alone regular milk!

review/summary: Who needs creamer with this stuff in your coffee???
review/text: I switched from chemically flavored, non dairy creamers to Silk (Soy) or So Delicious (Coconut) several years ago when my family made the decision to become vegan and stay away from processed foods.  However, upon squeezing about half a dropper full of this flavored stevia-based sweetener into my 20 ounce coffee cup, I don't need creamer at all anymore.<br /><br />I've read periodicals citing that Sucralose and other sugar-derivitives can cause your brain to melt by killing off your cells by the millions, so I would rather just moderately use sugar than any sugar-replacement, except stevia.  My wife even found stevia leaf powder at our local grocer that is so minimally processed, it's still green.<br /><br />In fact, the only concern I have about the ingredients of SweetLeaf sweeteners are the "Natural Flavors" which is an FDA approved way for manufacturers to hide what they are putting into their products.  I know this sounds a bit nit-picky, and nearly impossible to stay away from, as every processed food product on the market has Natural Flavors in it.  Below is the definition of "natural flavor" under the Code of Federal Regulations, which says that it could be derived from virtually anything in nature by just about any scientific means necessary:<br /><br /> "the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional"<br /><br />That being said, I give this product 5 stars for zero calories, taste, and (hopefully mostly) natural ingredients!

I would just caution that, in my opinon, there is a short adjustment period in getting used to the new taste.  Once that happens you'll love it.

review/text: I love liquid stevia, especially the English Toffee!  2nd best is a tie between milk and dark chocolate and the vanilla creme is great too.  Nice addition to coffee,  Best thing is there are no side effects like those of equal, sweet'n low or splenda.  Highly recommend to people w/sensitive stomaches like myself

review/text: This is my favorite flavor stevia so far.  I like the others but I always come back to English Toffee.<br />Flavored stevia has helped me lose 42lbs so far this year.  It is at the top of my list of weight loss secrets.  This has been BY FAR the easiest it has ever been to make good food choices.  The pounds just melt off!<br />I put it in my water and sip it all day.  That way I drink more water and don't feel deprived at all by sweet temptations.<br />I also like to mix berry with vanilla creme to get a red cream soda taste.<br />The best price I've found anywhere is on Amazon.  We get it delivered monthly (or more:) and get 15% off their already great prices.

review/text: I love stevia and was looking for a little something to add some different flavors to my coffee. This stuff smells fantastic! It is great in my coffee, but I discovered an even better use for it. I slice up a granny smith apple and put just a few drops on the slices and stir them around a little. It tastes just like a caramel apple! I was surprised how good it tasted on top of food like that as I've only tried it in liquids. If you put too much it will be bitter and not good. Three drops is plenty. I'd imagine anything that is good with caramel or toffee would be great with this. Stevia makes it easy to cut white sugar completely out of your diet and not feel deprived at all. Great product!

review/summary: Healthy sweetener, nice Toffee flavor
review/text: I only recently discovered Stevia, and I'm a big fan. I've used saccharine in my coffee for years, although I know it's not good for me. I eat a low carb diet so I didn't want to use honey, sugar, or agave nectar, and I've read too many bad things about Nutrasweet and Equal.<br /><br />I bought this 2-bottle pack of English Toffee stevia liquid to try it, and I really like it. It only takes a 2-3 drops to sweeten my morning coffee, and give it a subtle toffee flavor and smell. The toffee flavor isn't as strong as I'd like, but adding more drops makes it too sweet.<br /><br />I don't notice any aftertaste or bitterness after using stevia, although I've read reviews that other people do. The bottle lists the ingredients as "Proprietary Blend, Purified Water, Stevia (Leaf) Extract, and Other Ingredients" which makes me wonder what they've put in there that they can't tell me about. But for the couple of drops per day that I will ingest, I'm willing to let them keep their secrets.<br /><br />I got my two bottles with free shipping with Amazon SuperSaver shipping on orders over $25, and it's also available at a 15% discount if I sign up for Subscribe & Save.

review/summary: Awesome Product!
review/text: The Sweetleaf liquid flavored Stevias became a staple in our home after the first bottle. I have hypoglycemia and have been looking for low sugar alternatives for ages that actually taste good and really sweeten without too much fuss. And I have tried just about everything on the market. While there are some other good sugar substitutes out there what sets the liquid Stevia apart to me is that it has no calories, no carbohydrates and no sugar grams, is concentrated so a little goes a long way, is very easy to use and comes from a natural plant. The small bottles are also easy to travel with and as I mentioned it really does sweeten quite well. As far as the taste, depending on how your taste buds are you may want to combine this with other more palatable sweeteners until you get used to the Stevia taste. It can be an acquired taste for some although the flavored Stevias are much less so that just plain Stevia to me. For me, I was quite happy with the taste right off and only use Stevia now for sweetening our beverages and foods. Initially I mixed it with a little honey or coconut sugar and gradually reduced those amounts over time, using the Stevia as additional sweetening and flavoring, mainly because my husband had to get used to the taste. We had used powdered plain Stevia in the past and he didn't really like it, but these liquid Stevias were more palatable to him and now he loves them. It's all we use anymore except when we have guests. Again, matter of taste and what you are used to and what you hope to achieve by using this product.<br /><br />Of all the Stevia flavors, English Toffee is without a doubt my favorite. They really got it right with this one. It gives a distinct toffee flavor to everything I use it in and I am always happy with the result. I often combine it with the Vanilla Creme (another favorite) and they seem to work quite well together. I also use the English Toffee in combination with a few other ingredients to create a coffee substitute drink that no one ever guesses isn't real coffee or doesn't have sugar. For us it's better than any of the coffee substitutes on the market. You may have to experiment and work with these flavors a bit to find what works for you but that is half the fun. The only flavor so far I haven't been too crazy about was the Chocolate Raspberry which I didn't think tasted chocolaty enough. But I'm going to try the plain Chocolate one to see how that one is. Again, it's fun experimenting with all the different flavors and I hope they continue to add more (I would love a maple one). But I am quite happy with the large selection currently available and for me these products have been a blessing in aiding with my hypoglycemia and sweet tooth. I am quite grateful they exist and I will be using them indefinitely.

I figured it might be weird in something other then coffee, but what ever.<br /><br />I ordered a club soda with lime and decided to toss in a few drops of the English Toffee. It was like a cream soda!! I was so excited as I love cream soda and I don't drink diet sodas or sugar sodas.

review/summary: Sadly Disappointed
review/text: I purchased a bottle of the Sweetleaf Liquid Stevia English Toffee now they are offering a packet of two bottles. If you haven't tried this product before go for one bottle first. Yes, it's true ..  it is sweet with just a few drops. I don't know about the other flavors, however English Toffee tastes NOTHING like you would hope it would if you are a English Toffee lover. Besides ruining a perfectly good cup of coffee, this product has a somewhat bitter after taste. I would NOT recommend that any of my friends buy this, I'd offer mine to them. They will probably return it to me. YUCK!!!! I gave this product ONE star for ME for trying this stuff.

review/summary: Don't bother. Really.
review/text: These Sweetleaf "flavored" products are only for people who want something really sweet with just the very barest whiff of some flavor (you probably won't even be able to tell which one it is). If you're looking for a product that's about half sweetness and half flavor, THIS ISN'T IT. I urge you to save your money and look for another solution.

review/text: I started buying this at our local healthfood store when I wanted something that didn't have the sugar rush like other sweetners have.  I absolutely love this in my tea and I also use it for cooking.  I make homemade salad dressing with this also, so it's nice not having to wait for sugar to melt.  The flavor is light and delicate, a perfect tea sweetner, and not overpowering like some sugars can be.  I'm hooked and won't go back to traditional sugar.

review/text: This is up there in my favorite teas... I love the coconut flavor of this tea. I'm normally a black tea caffeinated tea drinker but since I'm pregnant I've been looking for caffeine-free alternatives. I've been drinking a lot of Rooibos tea and have gotten a bit bored with them... I've also been missing Chais. This Coco+ Chai+ Rooibos is the perfect combo. The coconut makes the tea taste super smooth and it feels like a desert-treat, guilt free.  It is a tiny bit spicy, but not too much (some of the Chais are too potent for me).  And this one smells REALLY REALLY good. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Good quality cat food
review/text: We feed this food to our almost grown kitten. He loves it.  Since cats are carnivores, this food fits the bill as it is mostly JUST fish, not fillers like corn and grains that really are not good for cats.<br />I really didn't like feeding the cat canned food because it grosses me out.  This food smells just a little fishy but is really not bad at all - compared to some cat foods which smell disgusting.  It's also very convenient and not messy.  You don't need to use a spoon to get it out of the pack.  Just rip it open and squeeze it out.

review/summary: Cats love the food (Hooray!) I hate packaging
review/text: I've had them try every type of Whiskas. . .this is hands down the best (this, meaning the Purrfectly Chicken, Chicken/Duck, Chicken/Beef). The purple packages don't even resemble meat so even though my cats will eat it, I didn't feel comfortable feeding it to them. The Purrfectly Fish makes a couple of my kitties violently ill (hence the neon pink vomit everywhere) but the Purrfectly chicken varieties seem to agree with all of them. No vomit, they eat a majority of the meat after lapping up all of the juices and grain free. My diabetic cat is no longer diabetic, and the fact that there is now a food in my home that everyone will eat is pretty amazing.<br /><br />My complaint - the packaging. I've tried the tip mentioned by others (storing them upside down) but there is just no way to get the pack open without a) having the juice squirt out on to one of the eager diners (though they don't let that slow them down), b) having the juice squirt and ooze all over my hands c) the juice splattering the wall d) me having to squeeze the package for the remaining bits of meat and juice as if I am milking a cow. I HATE feeding them because I always end up covered in chicken juice and bits and I know there is more in the package that I didn't successfully squeeze out. This in turn means that all of the pets will be trying to go through the trash when they are hungry looking for a few half squeezed packs so they can get another fix. There must be another interior material they could use for the packaging that would allow an easier 'release' of the food. . .Whiskas, you listening?

review/summary: Slop.
review/text: Maybe my cat is spoiled. We've fed her "Soulistic" brand pouches since the day we brought her home. I saw this product when I last shopped for her food. It looked like a real gourmet scene, so lovely was the image of the food on the packaging. Now, I know there's always a disparity between the box image and the actual fare, but this has to be the most glaring, bald-faced LIE in the history of marketing.<br /><br />When I opened the package (which showed a expiration date well into 2012), I felt confused! Almost like I wasn't sure if my eyes weren't playing tricks on me! The entire brown, gelatinous mess slid out like a giant leech into her bowl. After some desperate prep work, mashing things up, I managed to get this glop to a state where it more resembled something that you'd see sliding down the wall in a monkey's cage.<br /><br />My cat took one sniff, and regarded me with a glance that can only be described as a "how dare you", and strutted away. Hungry, but with dignity in tact.<br /><br />I WILL get a refund for this gunk. Mark my words.

review/summary: The cats love the food, I hate the package (cats win!)
review/text: I have four cranky senior cats who never seem to enjoy the same food (picture an older, more crotchety male cast of the golden girls). One likes fish, the other eats it and throws up bright pink everywhere; one was open to trying a raw diet, the others wanted to eat canned food - though usually just the juice or gravy. Anyone who has cats knows that they will starve rather than eat something they don't like - just to prove their point. Because one of my cats is diabetic, I've been trying to keep them on a grain free diet, only, they don't seem to enjoy any of the fancy grain free canned food from the local yuppie pet store.<br /><br />I've had them try every type of Whiskas. . .this is hands down the best (this, meaning the Purrfectly Chicken, Chicken/Duck, Chicken/Beef).

review/summary: Finally a food my finicky feline will finish!
review/text: My cat is 15 years old, and has NEVER liked a kitty treat in her life - the only non-dry cat food she would ever eat was REAL tuna fish juice, drained from the can (and never mind the tuna). She has also had what I affectionately call a "tender tummy", meaning that every few weeks, since she was a kitten, she has had vomiting episodes that last a day or so and then disappear again. No explanation. Basically, I've just had to find cat food for her that matches the carpet on the way back up. Ew.<br /><br />About a year ago, she stopped eating all together, and I was worried that she and I had reached the end of her long life. In actuality, she had just decided she no longer liked the IAMS senior she had eaten for 10 years, was going on a hunger strike that put her in the ER Vet with failing kidneys due to dehydration.<br /><br />Enter Wiskas Purrfectly Fish Tuna (in the pack of ten, with the sardines and Whitefish/tuna mix). She instantly started eating again, and her health returned in a matter of days. AND, no more random vomiting!! She even deigns to eat dry cat food once a day to supplement the moist stuff - I'm using IAMS young adult (orange bag), and have had no problems there either.<br /><br />She has her preferences with the Wiskas, don't be deceived. She will ONLY eat the purrfectly fish, NOT any other flavor, and really doesn't prefer the sardines (neither do I). The tuna entree with the whitefish is often only halfway eaten, but the tuna entree alone is always finished, which is why I was so happy to see it for sale here by itself.<br /><br />One complaint, though. My kitchen now smells like dead fish. But, to save my carpets, her health, and my sanity, I'll sacrifice a little smell.

review/text: I divide a pack into 3 pieces about once a week for my cats. They are a bunch of American Shorthairs that wandered in from wherever cats come from and my wife started feeding them. Most of them are between 10-15 years old. They love this type of food, and come running when they get a whiff. It does smell good, and in a pinch, I might try it in a sandwich. Just kidding. Anyway, if you are looking for food for a finicky cat, this is the one.

review/summary: Whiskas Won
review/text: My cat has developed an increased appetite since I changed her diet from ONLY dry food to moist food.  She is 17 years old and has lost so many teeth that dry food was becoming too difficult for her to eat.  After two years of serving her "wet food" I never made a distinction among the different brands of wet food until recently.  I always buy different brands of wet food, and she seems to enjoy the ones from a packet rather than a can.  However today, with WHISKAS, after devouring a whole packet,  she wanted another one.  Not only that, but she licked the plate entirely clean.  She kept begging for more and I finally gave in to her wishes. I was very surprised when I just went to look at her plate because she consumed an entire second package.  I better check this out with her vet.  She is not overweight, but I don't want to overfeed her.

review/summary: My cats love it!
review/text: My cats are 10 years old, and have eaten dry food their entire life. I would give them wet pouches once in a great while as a treat. However, about 6 months ago, the female started puking on a daily basis, and let's just say it was not a "normal" type. I tried different brands (they had been eating Cat Chow Indoor Formula), but she is no longer interested in dry food (the male will still eat it). So I started buying Friskies pouches, and they seemed to really like it, but I noticed that little by little, they started leaving more and more food. They would only lick the gravy and leave the food.<br />Finally I tried this Whiskas item, and they seem to really love it, and they eat every bite. I'm glad I finally found something she will eat, because she has visibly lost weight.<br /><br />Oh, and Amazon's price is more expensive than a grocery store, but unlike some other people who misuse these ratings, I am rating the PRODUCT, not Amazon. The 5 star rating is for the cat food alone.<br />I'll go to a message board if I want to discuss Amazon's business practices.

review/summary: Cats love it!
review/text: My five cats all love this food. It's unusual for all five to agree on a food item, but they all run for it when I bring out the bag. Have it shipped on subscribe & save.

review/summary: cats loved the gravy!
review/text: As my title says,my cats LOVED all of the gravy-they lapped it up before eating the pieces of chicken. However i am NOT a fan of these pouches-i think they are a mess to deal with and no matter how careful you are to keeping your kitchen counter neat-some of the gravy always ends up there.A tip after getting the food out of the pouch with a spoon--add some water to the pouch and swish it around and add it to the cats plate to make a little more gravy. I wouldn't buy this again unless it was on sale. That said my cats do LOVE the whiskas fish pouches-you just open up the pouches and the food just slides out-no spoon required.

review/summary: My cats love this
review/text: While my cats love this food, I don't.  I gave it three stars for that reason.  My cats will eat this up in a heart beat but I absolutely abhor the packaging.  Once you peal back the top, the contents almost always spills onto your fingers, floor, counter, wherever you happen to be.  Then, when you are trying to pour the contents into a bowl, about a 1/4 to 1/5 of it get stuck down in the bottom and you have to dig it out with a spoon or cut the sides open and scrape it out.  Very messy process.  If they would fix the packaging, this product would be a real plus.  As it stands, I hate to use it because of the mess.

review/summary: My two kitties LOVE this stuff
review/text: I have a 3yr old and 12 yr old cat.  They both love this specific brand/flavor of cat food.  I've tried other whiskas flavors, meaty bites, chunks, pate etc and also tried Friskies stuff.  But Whiskas Purrfectly Chicken is the only one they wont throw up. And it has a lot of moisture/juice which is great for my older cat who is dehydrated and needs lots of liquids.

review/summary: Cat's Favorite!
review/text: One of my two cats has issues keeping dry food down because for some reason he refuses to chew. As an added snack I started feeding them these once a day, and they looooove them. They have lots of sauce and real chunks of chicken. Highly recommend it!

review/summary: Not Cheap, but Worth It!
review/text: While I'll acknowledge that shipping catfood can be a pricey proposition, with three cats, and an upper-floor apartment, the convenience of home delivery makes it a desirable option...and Amazon's excellent reputation for on-time deliveries makes it a far more reliable choice than the other 'autoship' providers I've used.<br /><br />Whiskas Purrfectly Fish Tuna Entree has been a favorite of my babies for over two years (surprisingly, it's the only 'seafood' item they like), and when you find something they love, you stick with it! While all the grocery chains in my area only offer it in a multi-flavor box (forcing me to pay for food the cats WON'T touch), through Amazon (and other carriers), the Tuna Entree pouches can be ordered individually for shipment, which is another reason I accept the increased price, without complaint.<br /><br />So consider what your options are, and if the 'pros' outweigh the 'cons', I recommend Amazon as your choice!
