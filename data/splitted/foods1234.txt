review/summary: Very Satisfied.
review/text: Our baby (11-months-old) is now on solid foods and we try to feed him a great variety of items. The doctor said he could eat the same foods we eat. Well, that's good to know but we need a things that are easier to eat. In part, we make up concoctions of our own dishes but reduced to a mush. In addition, my wife found this Earth's Best Organic line of baby foods at a local store. They have quite a lineup of foods, but the brand and all varieties can be a little hard to find.<br /><br />One thing he seems to like are fruit and grain mixtures, so we picked up a variety pact as well as individual jars and we include a jar in his daily intake. My wife likes the organic aspect with no preservatives or additives and the baby seems to enjoy the foods. We're gradually trying more and more of the Earth's Best Organic lines of food, and we've been very satisfied so far.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: They'll Eat as Much as You Give Them  But Use Formula for Nutrition
review/text: I jumped into this subscription because here the variety is just incredible, and because "prunes" jumped out at me.<br /><br />My twin 10-month olds just love all 3 flavors of this variety pack: Banana Apricot Mixed Grain, Prunes & Oatmeal & Plum Banana Brown Rice.<br /><br />Prunes and oatmeal had 100 calories and 2 grams of protein; Plum banana brown rice had 80 calories and less than 1 gram of protein; and Banana apricot had 70 calories and 1 gram of protein.  These are energy treats with a laxitive effect and the babies love them, but their only listed nutritional value was a small bit of protein.<br /><br />I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.

review/summary: Not really a variety pack
review/text: We bought this recently and was disappointed because Earth's best in general is a good at giving variety in their bulk packs. The main point for us purchasing jarred foods is for variety. Yet, 9 out of the 12 jars in the pack has banana. I'm not sure how that can be considered a variety.  I would not buy this again. Mainly because bananas are cheap and easy to feed your toddler. Why would you want to be gouged for the mark up?<br /><br />Also, I don't see how they can label them stage 2 when they have the consistency of stage 1 food.

review/summary: The best food for every baby!
review/text: I had a tough time introducing (semi)solid foods to my baby boy who was exclusively breast fed until 9 months. Thats when we tried Earth's best fruit starter pack. My baby loved it (though he was reluctant to eat the banana which he eventually ate after few months). He is now 15 months and Earth's best is the only reliable baby food that I still give him. I would recommend this product to all moms who wish to give their baby the best! Its organic, its tasty and comes in a wide combination of fruit and grain! My baby loves the whole grain combo. Great product!!

review/text: After giving my baby (7 mos old) the prunes and plum combinations, she went very smoothly.  She had some constipation before starting on the prunes and afterwards, she was a happy pooper!  It was also easier to feed her fruits and grains together rather than separately, saving time.  My baby also really liked the taste of these combinations which made it easier to feed her.

There was no packaging in the box and several jars broke.  There was food and glass all over the box.  And, Amazon won't let you return food items.  I did get a partial refund, though.

review/text: Earth's Best makes the BEST organic baby food ever!  I'm a first-time mom and this product was recommended to me by several friends.  What I like most about them is they taste very fresh and high-quality.  A lot of them even smell fresh too.  My son doesn't like the fruit combinations very much, but the vegetable variety are his favorites.  I will continue using this brand for as long as possible.  While a little bit pricier than other brands, but I think it's worth it for your little precious one.

review/text: My baby loved this variety pack of Earth's Best baby food. I was afraid she might not like the prune flavor, but when I gave it to her, she ate it without a fuss. I love it because it's organic and healthy-also, all that whole grain helps relieve her constipation, lol. So whenever she's constipated because we tried giving her a new food--and also when we switched from formula to regular milk--I give her about half a jar of one of these with plenty of water and, well, it comes out. :)

review/text: My daughter pretty much exclusively eats Earth's Best baby food. The stage two fruit and whole grain combo is well-liked by her. It is also one of my favorite varieties because it is thicker than the ones that just contain fruit or vegetables without the grains already added in. Buying them on Amazon has been the most cost effective option for me by far. When I use the subscribe and save option it is significantly less expensive than buying it at a brick and mortar store. All in all I am very happy with this product! I wish there were a few more varieties available, but the product itself is wonderful.

review/summary: Not a hit
review/text: Our 7 month old really did not like any of combinations included in this variety pack. This may be specific to our baby, but it seemed to be a texture issue. Even if he seemed to like the taste-- he made himself gag trying to get it out of his mouth and didn't want to swallow it. He seems to be sensitive to texture anyway, so maybe this just wasn't a good choice for him. He does like the Earth's Best fruit variety pack, but any of the fruits mixed with grains were a definite no go. The nanny and I both even tried thinning down the mixture with breast milk or formula, and he still did not like it and spit it out. I would recommend trying one jar before you buy the variety pack because I had to give these away.

review/summary: Not a great product to get through the mail
review/text: My 2nd child was raised on EB baby foods. They were easy to come by in VA.  I clipped coupons and "afforded" them. Now that I'm living in rural Alabama, I turned to Amazon to get the product that I loved.  I ordered 3 different cases.  It was a mess when it arrived.  At least two of the jars were broken when it arrived at my house.  This sends the price per unit price up.  Two years ago, I got a sliver of glass stuck in my finger. As my body worked to push it out, I developed a tumor that needed to be surgically removed.  To say I have a broken glass phobia is an understatement.  I also through the entire shipment away instead of digging through the glop to find my unbroken jars, but these are tough economic times, and a baby's got to eat.  After sitting back down to the computer I decided that the 16 packs you get with Happy Baby pouches were more cost effective, and they don't run the risk of breaking.

review/text: I lived all my life in the Middle East and visited every country in the Middle East (including Israel) as well as many Mediterranean countries. I am writing this review mainly for people from the Middle East.<br />I always get my pickles from the stores that sell imported Middle Eastern food, and that's usually expensive.  So I thought maybe I can find them cheaper on Amazon. There were only 5 positive reviews when I ordered these pickles, so I was hopeful.  But after trying these with and without food, I am sad to report that they are not even close to Mediterranean pickles!  They are overdone and too salty and they are worse than what you get in North American grocery stores.  If you are looking for authentic pickles, because you miss having them like me, look elsewhere.<br />Many of the cans arrived dented, and none of them had a manufacturing or expiry dates.<br />P.S. for people who lived most of their lives in the US I'm not sure what to tell you other than these don't taste authentic and you might not like it.

review/summary: Best of the Chunky Beefs. Tasty and filling.
review/text: Campbell's "CHUNKY Beef with Country Vegetables" is the best of the beef soups - a meal in a bowl, like beef stew. Shelf stable, so can sit around indefinately, ready for an emergency meal. We keep a case of this at our cabin. Not too salty, either, as soups usually are. It has 300 calories, 3.0 grams fat (no trans fat,) 42 carbs, 20 grams protein, 10 grams fiber, a perfect meal. Yes, it makes popping noises as it heats in the microwave, but the red lid is well vented, and there is no mess. Just give the hot soup a good stir and ENJOY!

review/summary: Best canned soup!
review/text: I'm not sure how a previous reviewer could really complain about the fat content of this soup, it's only 3g per serving, but whatever. The soup is hardy with a thick sauce-like broth. In terms of canned soup, it's well flavored with tender strips of steak that still have a little bite to them. This soup leaves you feeling satisfied with high levels of protein, dietary fiber, vitamin A, iron, and little fat or calories. Like most canned soups, the sodium content is very high.

review/summary: Coffee for those that want STRONG CAFFEINE CONTENT!
review/text: By far, my favorite K-CUP coffee. Followed by Starbuck's Blond Roasts. Donut House is ~15% to 45% cheaper than Starbucks. So hands down, this takes the trophy if you're stocking your office with 1600 K-Cup's/month.<br /><br />FACT:  MILDER ROAST = HIGHER CAFFEINE.  DARKER/BOLDER ROAST = LESS CAFFEINE.  Let's clear up this fallacy once and for all folks.<br /><br />As a serious coffee connoisseur with a naturally hyperactive brain, anything but extremely strong coffee puts me to sleep. Strong as in "caffeine content". Bold/Extra Dark (e.g. French Roast, Columbian, Espresso), sedates me. I like it at night to help me sleep. Typical for those with Hyper-Active brains (i.e AD/HD)<br /><br />Sadly, "Bold" is confused with "Strong". Unless you're implying "strong flavored". This is why people falsely think Espresso Roasts have the most caffeine. Actually, it has 1/3 the caffeine of French Roast and 1/4 of a mild roast. If you have a full cup of espresso, yes, you'll have a lot of caffeine. Who drinks an entire cup of Espresso though? That's 5 shots! In this day and age of the internet, people continue to remain ignorant to this fact.<br /><br />Peete's Coffee came out with a strong cup of coffee and won the ultimate endorsement from Oprah. Starbucks launched their Pike's Roast & only their Breakfast Blend contains more caffeine. Their Extra Dark/Extra Bold coffee became Exotic Limited Reserve Blends.<br /><br />2 "Clover" machines were launched at 2 Starbucks around the country. They make the best cup of coffee on the planet! All because of the technology. The Clover was acquired on the spot after a taste test by Starbucks Executives. Not to serve a better cup of "drip". The Clover could put Starbucks out of business either in a competitor's hands or in their own hands because it takes 10 minutes for a cup of "drip"; whereas the bread & butter for all coffee shops comes from their in & out "drip" customers.<br /><br />K-cup is for those who are fed up with paying $4 for a cup of coffee. Donut House avg. cost is $0.60. Of course, Starbucks is more expensive, between $0.71-$0.99/K-Cup.<br /><br />When Blonde was released in K-Cups, caffeine lovers that appreciate a mild flavor rejoiced! Donut House Mild and Starbucks Blonde wake you up with 1 cup and there's no afternoon drag. Unlike "Breakfast Blends" that make you crash and require a cup of tea to moderate the afternoon effect.<br /><br />Those who drink "roach mobile" coffee on the street corner don't care. Clover enthusiasts are very picky. Donut House still makes the best mild, high caffeine K-Cup. Verona K-Cups are a close 2nd. "In store" made with a Clover machine, I'll buy a Grande and get 3 cups out of it because of the caffeine content. Plus the taste is unbelievably good.<br /><br />BOLD, BITTER flavored coffee fans love the French Roasts and South American and African Coffees. Less caffeine though. Of course, cheers to those of you who love the Bolder coffees. We all have differing tastes but no more Amazon reviews of how "EXTRA BOLD" is the ultimate wake up coffee because of a "high caffeine" content. No more fallacies.<br /><br />Enjoy!

These two snacks had none of the stale and rancid flavor of Sahale's "Dauphine" (walnut) and "Soccorro" (Macadamia/hazelnut) snacks that came in the same shipment.  "Dauphine"  and "Soccorro" tasted much fresher when bought in a local store.

Given all the five-star reviews, I was expecting these to taste MUCH better than they do.  While not too sweet, the strong vanilla flavor overwhelms the flavor of the cashews, pomegranate, and apple.  I love vanilla, but there's just too much in the blend for me.  I bought the pack of six and wish I had bought one pack to try, instead.

review/text: The overload of sesame seeds ruined the taste for me.  The nuts were chewy instead of crispy and it was mostly nuts, not many cranberries.  Thankfully it wasn't too sweet but the texture with the sesame seeds and "chewy" nuts ruined it for me.  They may have been stale but the lack of a expiration date made that unclear so I trust Amazon wouldn't send me expired goods although they have before.

review/text: This snack blend is the best! I tried it on the recommendation of a friend, and have come to love it. It's perfect alone, but I enjoy putting the mix on salads. It definitely spices them up a bit, and the flavor is amazing. I have become a big fan of this product, and would recommend it to anyone who is looking to add a little excitement to their everyday snacks.

review/summary: Indulge Your Tastebuds
review/text: About a month ago, I noticed a new product at my local QFC. It was on sale and I actually did a double take and returned to check out the display. It was filled with bags of fancy nut mixes by Sahale Snacks.  I had been trying to wean myself off sweets by substituting nuts and other trail mixes for candy whenever I got the munchies.  Sahale snack mixes looked like the fancy, upscale "town mouse" to my regular, boring "country mouse" trail mixes.<br /><br />The one that caught my eye was Sing Buri with cashew, pineapple, peanut, lemongrass and Chinese chili. The ingredients definitely made my mouth water, but the picture on the front is what sold me: a heaping bowl of delicious sweet and savory looking cashews and dried pineapple. The bag was pretty expensive at $5.99 on sale for 5 ounces, but I was definitely hooked at that point and decided to give it a try. I didn't even wait to get home, but opened up the bag in the car and started snacking right away. It was amazing!<br /><br />The more I looked into Sahale Snacks, the more I liked. On the website, the story is told of the two founders hiking up Mt. Rainier in Washington State, dreaming of something beyond the regular peanut/raisin/m&m combo that was their trail mix. What resulted was a snack mix that was indulgent and healthy.<br /><br />These snack blends are a little pricy, but in my opinion, totally worth it. This would be a wonderful nut mix to offer to friends and guests when entertaining. This is a high brow snack that you or your guests will love.

review/summary: This is grand, really really grand!
review/text: I first tried this nut and spice delight at Costco........I had some of the samples that were offered that day and I choose to purchase the Sing Buri. My goodness this is good!! The flavors are just right. You know how a really good (Asian or French) sauce holds together and has a progression of flavors? I found that this happens with the nuts and chili and lemongrass.<br /><br />Really, this is a gorgeous snack and healthy too!<br /><br />Now that Amazon is offering this company's products, I ordered 2. And with the nice 10 bucks off, this is a very nice bargain!<br /><br />Depending on your palate (some folks are happy with Planters nuts you know), I think you will be delighted with this choice!<br /><br />Scrumptious!

review/summary: Love this flavor!
review/text: I bought the variety pack and tried this flavor third (see my reviews for Socorro and Soledad). I buy natural snacks for my kids (freeze dried fruit etc with no added sugar), but I find them bland. So I ordered these and I love this flavor. In fact my 4 year old wanted to try and she liked it - it wasn't too spicy for her. They use black pepper which is flavorful, but I wouldn't call it spicy.  The nuts are big and crunchy and the fruit is small and chewy. There is about equal of both nuts and fruit.  Valdosta has 7 grams of sugar in a 1/4 cup serving.

review/summary: unusual but delicious blend
review/text: Ever since I have tried this productI eat some everyday!! It is the perfect blend of savory, tangy, sweet, and a touch spicy.  I know that sounds like a weird combo, but its sooo good, addicting even. I initially  bought this prouct at a local natural and whole foods store, but amazon .com has the lowest price I've seen anywhere and u cant beat free shipping!! It's so conveniant. I have ordered this product from amazon several times and I must mention one order contained multiple expired items that were definitely stale tasting, so I let customer service know and they immediately responded and very pleasantly resolved the matter to my satisfaction. I do suggest the multiple 12  2 oz multiple pack only because this blend is so yummy portion control is helpful!!!

review/summary: Addictive? Yes!
review/text: Be warned - if you like these, then you are setting yourself up for many re-orders! I personally love the marriage of vanilla and cashews, and while I wasn't sure about the pomegranate - it helps to create a unique blend of flavors. They have become my go-to munchie and the only complaint I have is the relatively high cost. Most stores have them for around $5/bag, but ordering this package saves you $1 per bag overall. Go ahead and treat yourself - they are a great alternative to the usual cookie, cake, etc. type of snacks.

I ate the entire bag in one sitting and had to run out for more.  It's a healthy snack and a great alternative to trail mix.  While I haven't tried the other flavors yet I'm sure they are just as tasty!  You won't be let down with this wonderful snack.  Enjoy!

review/summary: delicious.
review/text: I got a variety pack of Sahale mixes, and this was the only one i liked. The others just didn't work for me, though i only actively disliked one (sing buri, my coworkers all hated it too, though they gladly ate the other flavors i dismissed).<br /><br />For the reviewer who said it was too peppery, either they're extremely sensitive to black pepper, they got a badly mixed bag, or by chance grabbed a bit that was more peppery than the rest and didn't explore further. I think the pepper is perfect, strong enough to give it a little kick and sting, but light enough that it's not the primary (or even secondary) flavor. There is some variability, though, and once in a while you'll get a mouth full of pepper.<br /><br />While i gladly eat these for a snack at my desk at work, they are a must-have for long plane trips. The nuts make it filling, and the cranberries and glaze give it a nice sweet touch without being so sugary that i get the jitters trapped in a middle seat on hour 2 of a cross-country flight.

review/summary: Great snacks
review/text: I picked up a bag of these on a whim the other day and I was instantly hooked.  I like almonds, but plain almonds do get boring, salted almonds are usually too salty, and honey covered almonds are usually too sweet and too salty.  And it's hard to find almonds that aren't roasted in some kind of cheap oil.<br /><br />Enter these Sahale snacks. A little salt, a little honey, and dry roasted almonds.  Oh and cranberries.  In my bag I didn't get many cranberries, I don't know if that was a fluke but I didn't care because I was mostly after the almonds.  If you are looking for a  big handful of almonds and cranberries this might disappoint.  For me it's been a great snack to keep around the office (it helps me avoid the 3PM coke-and-potato chip craving).<br /><br />The price seems a little high at first, but a single bag last several days, which put's in line with the cost of bag of chips.  Overall a great snack that's actually pretty good for you.

review/summary: Larger sized bags of the Valdosta Blend are available at Costco seasonally
review/text: The ingredient list made for interresting reading. So much so that I almost left my first bag of these treats on the shelf. The kicker for me was that they did not contain any ingredients I am allergic to, so into my basket they went.<br /><br />Once I tried them I became addicted.  These are great right out of the bag.  I also love them in a tossed green salad with crumbled bleu cheese and thinly sliced fresh pears.<br /><br />I checked Costco yesterday for the Valdosta Blend, but they were out.  They are currently offering another Sahale blend with almonds.  I didn't buy it--I'll wait for the Valdosta to come in.  I am not sure if Costco changes the Sahale snack selection seasonally or if they were just out-of-stock.<br /><br />When we were vacationing in Texas, I bought another Sahale blend to sample.  I wish I could remember the name of it. It wasn't as good and I would not go out of my way to buy it again. I will continue to buy the Valdosta Blend regularly though.

review/text: I have been buying these from Costco for years, but was told a few weeks ago that they were gone and not coming back in the foreseeable future.  I hate it when Costco does that!  Thank goodness for Amazon -- at least I can order from them!  I don't think the ones I received are as fresh as the ones I used to get from Costco.  The cranberries are pretty tough to chew.  But they're still a tasty snack and indispensable on a salad of spring greens, blue cheese, apples or grapes, and drizzled with balsamic vinegar and olive oil.

review/text: I took a chance on buying these snacks despite concerns from other reviewers that the vanilla overpowers the cashews because I really enjoy the Sahale savory nut mix trio.  I am glad I decided to make the purchase because the combination of cashew, pomegranate and vanilla come together nicely to make a tasty but not cloyingly sweet treat. With the exception of fruit, these nuts satisfy my craving for sugar without making me feel guilty, like a chocolate bar, cookies, or ice cream would.<br /><br />I will definitely purchase again.

review/summary: Cheesy, low-carb goodness
review/text: I love salty snack foods, especially cheesy ones, and one of the things that I miss most on a low-carb regime are Doritos. The Sahale Southwest Cashews have all the spicy-cheesy-salty goodness of a Dorito, but are low carb -- 10g carb per quarter-cup. They're addictive. They're quite expensive (one cup of nuts per package), but if you're not worried about what you're paying for your snack food, these are great.

review/summary: Pretty Tasty, but Not as Good as Valdosta
review/text: The Sahale Soledad mix is similar to my Sahale fave mix, Valdosta, in that it's a mixture of nuts, dried fruit, and spices, with a varied texture of chewy and crunchy and a mixture of sweet and spicy flavors, but there is something about it that I'm not quite in love with. It's not the stickiness, because I don't mind that except for the it being a bit messy if I'm snacking while on line, which I often am.<br /><br />I guess, as I've said before in my reviews of Sahale nut snacks, I think every one of them pales in comparison to the perfection of the Valdosta variety. In fact, I'm so crazy about the Sahale Valdosta mix that I posted a Haiku in praise. I know, pathetic. So, take my opinions of the other flavors with a grain of sea salt.

review/summary: The Best of the Sahale Snack Nut Blends
review/text: I really don't know how to describe Sahale's Valdosta Pecans better than L. Thorson did in reviewing the 2 ounce packages (and whre I also quoted him/her): "This is an especially felicitous blend of crunchy pecans and chewy cranberries, spiced up with a little black pepper and orange zest. Good to eat out of hand, and also good to toss into a salad for some extra flavor and texture."<br /><br />After trying this snack I'd purchased away from my usual shpping spots, I couldn't remember the name of it and bought various nut snacks of other brands that I thought may have been the same, but was repeatedly sadly disappointed. Just yesterday I found the real thing again and decided to see if I could get it from Amazon. I was successful at first, but then after receiving them and wanting to get more, found Amazon was out.

The balance of flavors is just right; the combined impression is pretty bold, but no single ingredient is overpowering. It's definitely a salty snack, but the other flavors come through beautifully. Every bite has its own character -- you might get a nice little burst of chili (mild; more pungent than hot) and sweet, chewy pineapple in one bite, and then a cluster of crunchy, tangy cashews and peanuts with a hint of lemongrass in the next. Oh, and be sure to give the bag a good shake before you dig in, to distribute all the good stuff that settles at the bottom.  Enjoy!

review/text: I got addicted to Sahale's snacks from the Tully's Coffee that was downstairs at work.  After pretty much buying them out they didn't restock in enough time so I decided to take matters into my own hands and buy in bulk from Amazon.  My 3 favorites are Socorro, Ksar and Soledad.  If you want a healthy snack that tastes like you're indulging in sinful goodness then this is the snack for you.<br /><br />I give these a 4 because sometimes the almonds are a little over roasted for my tastes but all the girls at work seem to like this one the most so they must know something I don't.

These are the Sahale Snacks that sell out first in the store.  Friends likewise agree that these are the best.  For some reason, in my recent shipment, these "Valdosta" pecans and the "Soledad" almonds were as good as the ones from the store, but the "Soccorro" Macadamia / hazelnut and the "Dauphine" Walnut / blueberry snacks were stale-tasting, even rancid, especially the walnuts, this despite being two to five months pre-expiration date.
