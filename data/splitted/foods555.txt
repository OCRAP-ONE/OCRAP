review/summary: Last Batch Too Dry
review/text: I really like Nana's cookies and have placed several orders.  The Peanut Butter are always dryer than the others, but, unfortunately the last batch of Peanut Butter was way too dry.<br /><br />The Double Chocolate are always very moist and great tasting.<br /><br />I have tried most of the flavors, but Peanut Butter and Double Chocolate are my favorites.  Just wish they would make the peanut butter ones a little more moist.

review/summary: Yummy
review/text: I absolutely LOVE these cookies!  (and, no, I'm not a relative or friend of the manufacturer).  I've eaten the chocolate chip, oatmeal-raisin and peanut butter ones - never the gluten-free, so can't comment on them.  I love that they've no refined sugar or hydrogenated fats like most other cookies.  I've been buying them locally, and my grocery store is frequently out of them, so I was delighted to find them on amazon for cheaper than at the store.  One reviewer commented on the calories.  HUH?  First of all, who on a diet buys then dings cookies?  Also, keep in mind that just one of Nana's cookies is nearly 1/4 pound (hello?).  If you were to eat 4-1/2 regular size cookies, you'd end up with the same number of calories but they wouldn't taste as good as Nana's or be as good for you.  But you can always save what you don't want for later.  Sometimes I'll just eat half a cookie and roll up the plastic bag and tape it so I can enjoy the second half later.  So far they've kept just fine for even a couple of weeks.  No worries.

review/summary: Delicious AND healthy
review/text: Quitting sugar is HARD. Nana's cookies make it MUCH easier. I get to enjoy the sweet & chocolately taste I crave, without the sugar or chemicals in most other cookies. They are delicious and very satisfying. Because they are sweetened with fruit juice, my blood sugar does not get spiked, so I do not get a "high" followed by a crash after eating these cookies. Nor do I feel addicted to them, like I do when I eat products made with sugar. And, I like that they are gluten free, since we are bombarded by products made from wheat, and I crave a variety of grains, like oats and rice. I highly recommend these cookies - I eat them regularly and they fulfill my craving for sweets, which has been so helpful in making better food choices when I am faced with temptation. And on Amazon, they are priced very reasonably, and worth every penny.

review/summary: The best cookie I've ever had!
review/text: I purchsed Nana's Coconut Chip cookies at Amazon and loved them. Incredibly moist, luscious and yummy, these oversized cookies are as satisfying as they are good for you. With wholesome ingredients and no refined flour or sugar, these are truely healthy treats. Chocolate chips and coconut flakes are paired perfectly while the flavor of each is allowed to shine through. Brilliant!  If you love chocolate and coconut, especially together, in one chewy concoction, you would find these cookies addictive. And they are vegan too.

review/text: These cookies are pretty good. I need something to pop in my mouth just before I run out the door to walk the dogs. I want something nutritious which won't send me into a sugar frenzy, and I want it quick.<br /><br />If crunch is your thing, these are not for you. I prefer the softer cookie now......I'd rather not crack my teeth on a harder version.... If you're up and out in a hurry, this little delicacy will do the trick !!!

review/text: My husband and I are slowly becoming addicted to these cookies. While they are, to me, just ok right out of the package, they are delectable warmed up in the microwave for 30 seconds and eaten with ice cream on top! Preferably one that has some kind of chocolate in it to boost the chocolate flavor. A great alternative to sugar free products, which can cause stomach upset, for those of us that want to stay away from refined sugar! Just don't forget that these are not a low calorie food, read your labels carefully!

review/summary: Truly Healthy and Satisfying
review/text: Life with dietary restrictions can be tough. Products like Nana's cookies make it so easy. These cookies are soooooooooo good and truly have healthy ingredients. Some "healthy" cookies are hidden with potentially harmful sugars like evaporated cane juice which is just sugar albeit unrefined. Some can take it and some cant. As a hyploglycemic that needs that is very senseitve to sugar the "good" and the bad these cookies are such a healthy treat. I never feel sick after eating one even if I eat the entire cookie and I couldnt possibly be more satisfied if I ate a homemade cookie with unhealthy ingredients. These cookies all of them I have tried are delicious. The gluten free options are not quite as good but if you must stay away from gluten all together they are a great version. This is the ULTIMATE cookie!

review/summary: My Favorite Nana
review/text: Interesting thing about reviews: you can tell as much about the reviewers as the items they're writing about.<br /><br />I've tried almost all of Nana's products and the No Gluten Ginger Cookie is my FAVORITE.  There's absolutely no guilt for me.  Brown rice and tapioca flour?  Fruit juice?  Canola oil?  What's not to like?  If, like me, you have to avoid dairy and sugar cane, it can be difficult to find a sweet treat that satisfies.  And if your girlfriend is gluten-free?  Well, now you're really in trouble.<br /><br />Fortunately, along comes Nana.<br /><br />This cookie has a great texture (almost like a scone: the real kind, from the UK) and a little kick.  It somehow maintains that perfect balance between spicy and sweet.  (See preamble, above.)  As with most of Nana's products, there's just one problem: I would be happier if the cookie were about as big as my head.  But that's why they come in boxes of twelve: one box lasts almost a week!<br /><br />Nana's other gluten free, dairy free, sugar free flavors - chocolate, lemon, and chocolate crunch - are all wonderful too, but this little wanton want-one is special.  Trust me.  Don't listen to the naysayers.  They just don't appreciate perfection; moist, buttery, spicy-sweetness.<br /><br />(See preamble, above.)<br /><br />Dear Nana: whatever that "natural flavoring" is, which hits the roof of my mouth like a monkey landing on my back, please don't take it out.  I pledge my everlasting devotion to your kitchen.  I'll even wash the dishes...

review/summary: Cookie + soy/rice milk = delicious
review/text: I was diagnosed with severe gluten and egg allergies roughly a year ago and had a hard time parting with my favorite kind of baked good: cookies. I never ate many in the first place but they were a treat or desert and I was thrilled to find a lemon cookie that satisfied my desire for baked goods.<br /><br />The consistency can be off-putting at first but the longer I go without wheat or gluten products the less important the consistency because I have almost forgotten what a real cookie tastes like. These lemon cookies are not tart but have a very nice lemony flavor that is reminiscent of a lemon bar. They are heavy and thick like a dense cake or brownie and incredibly chewy and fresh tasting.<br /><br />I would usually freeze these for a couple hours before taking one to school with me to have between classes. If you're able to drink soy or rice milk then a glass of vanilla or plain flavored milk will go great with these!

review/text: These cookies are soooo delicious!  Due to Celiac Disease and other gluten intolerances, three members out of our family of five must be gluten free.  These cookies sure fit the bill for a treat!  They are delicious, and even though they crumble a bit (if you eat gluten free you would probably be used to this since rice flour is commonly used, and it crumbles), they still have a soft moisture to them.  The ginger flavor is really good and not any spicier than a ginger snap.  My two boys ages 9 and 11 LOVE them.  When I pull the cookies out of the grocery bag, they dance around with joy!  The true test was when my husband tried one.  He does not have to eat gluten free, nor does he care to, lol.  He really liked it, and has since requested them when I shop! A+++ for these!!  Thanks Nana!

Our doctors have told both my husband and I to eat "organic."<br /><br />No they are not gluten free but not everything can be gluten free.  And yes I had a few in each box that were broken  We just broke them up and put them over the top of a dish of ice cream.<br /><br />There is no more broken cones in the boxes than the ones I used to purchase in the store.  Frankly everything I purchase in my grocery store is usually broken such as chips, tostitos, etc.<br /><br />Try them - you will love them.

Had trouble even opening the cans; they were so dented a can opener wouldn't work. If not for the shipping problem, they would be great! Better and cheaper than the ones available locally.

My shih tzu has severe allergies to most grains and to chicken, which is in nearly all non lid dog food. However, she still threw up about once a week - still a major improvement from every day. I decided to go ahead and try the rice and lamb even though I've heard you shouldn't give dogs grains, and he stomache has been in great shape - from both ends (oh and no more an*l gland issues either). So, I guess that rice, as a grain, works for some dogs... Anyway, I was in love with N.Balance before, now I feel like our household really can't live without. Thank you for making such great products.

review/summary: Finally-no more itching
review/text: My little mini-poodle mix has been suffering for ever from allergies, which have been hard to pin down.  She has suffered with inflamed ears, itching feet - everything! I have had her eating grain free, corn free and soy free  for EVER.<br /><br />The vet finally said---she's allergic to CHICKEN!<br /><br />She has finished her first bag of LID Lamb and Rice  and the change is dramatic.<br />No more head shaking and painful ears,  no more licking her legs---nothing.  I have since switched my little male Miniature Poodle over also---may as well have them both eating healthier!

review/summary: Lamp Review
review/text: The lamp is beautiful and much admired by our visitors.  The only problem I had was that I needed to purchase a power supply transformer to use it in NZ costing NZ$45.  The lamp still only cost me a total of NZ$180 though and a similar but slightly bigger tree in a local gift shop is $900.

review/summary: Just bought my second
review/text: I bought this lamp in white from a small shop a few years ago. I and everyone who came to my house loved it. Found it on amazon and bought the red one. THE WHITE IS WORTH THE EXTRA PRICE!!<br /><br />I'll keep the red though, it's still pretty. The box amazon ships this thing in is 4 feet tall though. Seriously 4x as big as it needed to be.

review/summary: Love it, only one downside....
review/text: I love my lighted tree.  It is beautiful and I've gotten tons of compliments on it.  My only wish is that it had a switch to turn it on.  Having to plug it in (in the particular location I have it) is inconvenient.  Other than that, I absolutely love it.  In fact, I ordered the red one after I had already bought the white one.

review/summary: With a little work, looks very nice
review/text: This product arrived very well packed. The branches are all compressed together when removed from the box so some artful shaping is required.  The stems seem to be made of malleable wire wrapped in brown florist tape.  The flowers are cut from some material (silk?) and mounted around each of the tiny "grain of wheat" lamps. The power supply is a relatively large and heavy wall-wart that will tend to slip out of the outlet.  My outlets are old and I had to use a short stub of an extension cord so the power supply could lie on the floor rather than hang from the wall.<br /><br />When illuminated, the tree is really lovely.  The light is fairly dim and it makes a perfect accent piece in a darkish room.  My sole concern at this point is how long the bulbs will last.  As the package insert notes, they are not replaceable.<br /><br />If you have a corner that needs an Asian accent, this could be it.

review/summary: I love this Ghirardelli Mint Chocolate. Perfect for after dinner or dessert. It tastes just right
review/text: This Ghirardelli Mint Chocolate tastes really good. The chocolate isn't too sweet nor too bitter. It is also not too creamy or milky. As far as the mint filling, it adds some more sweetness to the Chocolate, but at the same time the mint is very refreshing. Perfect to have after dinner or as dessert.<br /><br />If you like Mint Chocolate, you might also want to try the After Eight Mint Chocolate. they are very good too. Also try the Ghirardelli Peppermint Bark Chocolate which is kind of interesting taste (a combination of chocolate/dark chocolate with white chocolate and peppermint crust).

review/summary: Delicious! The BEST for movies!
review/text: This mix is really excellent, specifically for that summer blockbuster you've been dying to see!<br /><br />The mix has a very pleasing variety of textures and flavors, all of which work lovely together. It's fun to taste different components together to see what you get. My favorite are the M and M's and pretzels together (I'm a huge fan of Pretzel M and Ms and Flipz!), but, there are quite a few fun combinations. That's what keeps this mix lively and fun, just a variety is nice. This mix was also rich enough that the bag lasted me a long time while even being able to share it. This is a perfect mix, and I hope to see more varieties in the future!<br /><br />My advice is that you give the bag a good mix, even better if in a bowl, otherwise you end up eating all the pretzels and cookies before the m and ms and peanuts.<br /><br />The perfect summer/movie snack!

review/summary: Sugar-free and naturally-flavored? Naturally!
review/text: **NOTE on 08/19/12:  This review was written for the SUGAR-FREE syrup; not sure why it's being linked to the product that contains SUGAR. I assume the flavor is similar, but when originally posted, this review showed up for the sugar-free version.**<br /><br />For those seeking sugar-free products without all of the chemical sweeteners like aspartame, this sugar-free Maple Praline Syrup from Blackberry Patch is a natural solution. A rich praline pecan flavor with hints of vanilla, this syrup is sweet and delicious without being cloying. The thick, slow pouring syrup offers a nice mouthfeel similar to that of "regular" pancake syrup, a nice switch from the watery, too-thin textures of some sugar-free products.<br /><br />A special bonus is the natural flavoring--no off tastes, no strange chemicals!<br /><br />It's important to note that the sweetener here is maltitol, a "sugar alcohol" that can, for some, create gastrointestinal discomfort in large amounts (20-30 grams/day). I don't have this experience (perhaps because I don't consume such large amounts), and I appreciate that maltitol is not carcinogenic... A little online research from credible sources may be useful if you're concerned about this issue.<br /><br />Blackberry Patch makes a number of delicious naturally-flavored sugar-free syrups; this one is my personal favorite. Experiment and find your own favorite!

Pirate's Booty is a little crunchier and not greasy like regular junk food cheese puffs & the white cheddar is subtle, but very flavorful. For 130 calories per 1 ounce bag, you get a generous portion for one person, which is equal to about 4 nice size handfuls.

review/summary: Everyone LOVES these!
review/text: In a family of 7 it is hard to find a snack that no one minds taking with them where ever they are heading.  Personally, as mom, I think I'm a little addicted to them...but that's besides the point.  They are big bags of snacks - and what I liked is that each bag is actually LABELED as 1 serving - usually in bags this size (1oz doesn't SOUND like a lot - but it is) the manufacturers will say it's 1.5 or 2 servings and taking away a bag of snacks from a toddler isn't that easy.<br /><br />I bought these on sale and would do so again - on sale.  I'm not sure if my budget will be able to pay full price - but I would spend my gift cards on it.

review/text: I love the convenience of the Senseo machine but hate most of the decaf pod options. Can't drink much caffeine anymore but still love a good tasting cup of coffee and I've found these Baronet Decaf French Roast pods to be the best to my taste. I like my coffee dark roasted and somewhat strong to balance out the sugar and half&half I put in it.<br /><br />These pods are loaded up a lot thicker than other Senseo pods... so much that I have to use the 2-pod filter instead, which isn't a problem and beats using 2 pods to get a mug full of joe. Also I love that they're individually packaged so that unused pods stay fresh longer.

review/text: I was looking for a replacement for dark roast ( now hard to find in grocery store) senseo pods, this was  a great find. I use one of these pods and one vanilla senseo pod, in a two pod holder, push the 2 cup button twice,  and really enjoy a big mug full of this rich coffee.  Thank you Amazon for offering such a wide variety of pods that are getting harder to find for my senseo machine.

review/summary: Good choice when you need decaf
review/text: I mostly drink decaf, and it's difficult to find many decent dark roast decaf pods. Fortunately the Baronet French Dark Roast pods came to the rescue. I like the taste and the "bitterness". They fit quite well in my Bunn brewer and reasonable well in my Senseo (in the latter, I usually use the double pod holder, and put the bottom half of an Ecopad filter in that to make sure the pod seats firmly).<br /><br />I just hope the cost of these pods doesn't go up any more (a $3.50 increase since the previous Subscribe and Save order) so that I can continue to enjoy these pods.

review/summary: Just like the tub, only portable
review/text: I usually buy it in the tub, and have used it for a couple of years now after a doctor recommended that I use a green drink. I tried a few others, but finally settled on this for the best taste. I travel a bit for my Seven Summits Quest, and thought I might have trouble getting into and out of Russia, where I attempted Elbrus in September 2012, so I was happy to discover that this was available in single-serving size packets.<br /><br />I used them daily on my trip, including while I was in the huts at 12,300' on the side of the mountain, and I'm happy to say they taste as good as in the tub, and mix just fine in cold or hot water. I usually mix mine with a vanilla protein powder, my favorite being BSN Syntha 6, mostly because it's the best mixing powder I've found. I also like adding a pinch of Cinnamon to it, but I didn't on the trip, mostly for simplicity in packing and storing things.<br /><br />I will be using this product for all my hiking and backpacking adventures in the future.

review/text: The packaging is not so great, comes in a flimsy packet, but who cares about that, the contents are awesome! I have been regularly buying these since I first saw them in a Penny Markt shop in Frankfurt Germany.<br />They are crunchy, salted snack, which can be added to soup if u like. But I use them for a substitute in an Indian dish - "Boondi raita" where u add this to beaten salted yogurt before serving with Indian breads or rice.<br />Not just that, but my whole family likes to munch on it generally. Back means baked in german, so I sure hope its baked, that makes it healthy

review/summary: Incredible!!!
review/text: This is one of the BEST inventions for those of us who are gluten free and a good alternative for vegetarians who are health conscious.  These noodles are strictly made from organic black beans and cook up wonderfully in about 6 minutes.  They are very filling and you don't need to eat much to appreciate them.  Each bag contains 4 servings and a serving is all you need. They are just barely a little bit heavier in texture than a "normal" noodle.  But, with the higher protein these contain and the health benefits of eating vegetarian or gluten free, they are a perfect substitute.<br /><br />As with most alternative noodle choices, you cannot cook up too much and store them in a sauce.  They will absorb the moisture and get mushy.  You can cook the entire bag, let them cool and then place them into individual baggies or containers to freeze for later.  They defrost well and maintain their flavor.<br /><br />For people afraid these will taste too much like beans, you don't have to worry; they do not.  I have served these noodles to a couple picky teenagers who loved them and wanted me to give them more.

review/text: I am gluten intolerant, and for me this find was a huge godsend. The flavor is amazing as well as the texture. They cook up really fast and you don't feel gross after you eat them :)<br /><br />And don't worry they don't taste like beans, for those of you who are familiar with the residual bean flavor you get from the gluten free bean flour mix. This is such a unique product and I wish you could buy it in a little bit of a larger bag or container, but other than that I have NO complaints about this product.<br /><br />People should definitely include this on their grocery list!<br /><br />I hope to be serving it at my wedding!!<br /><br />HAPPY EATING EVERYONE!!!<br /><br />P.S<br />goes great with ground lamb!

review/text: This is the best product in its category. The taste and texture are just unctuous. Yam! I hate rice pastas' taste and texture, so this is a great alternative for me. My non non-gluten husband loves it too. The only thing I find is that the cooking time is slightly longer than the package indicates. Try it while cooking to find your own degree of readiness. Best with different kinds of pesto.

review/summary: Organix Organic Adult Dog Food by Castor & Pollux 12.7 oz.
review/text: I purchased seven (7) varieties of the Organix organic dog food from my local whole foods market for $2.79-2.99 plus $2.31 tax = $37.79--12-12.7 oz cans.<br /><br />There are two types of Organix organic dog food grain-free, and those that have grain products such as flaxseed meal.<br /><br />My two ShihTzus Darby and Hampshire prefer turkey and chicken over beef and lamb so I purchased the following formulas:  chicken & vegetable; turkey, carrot & potato; chicken & organic brown rice; turkey & vegetable, chicken & brown rice; turkey vegetable; turkey & vegetable (grain-free); and chicken & vegetable (grain-free).<br /><br />Darby and Hampshire's typical diet is roast chicken with brown rice and mix vegetables.<br /><br />Their snacks normally consist of non-nitrate hot dogs, pan fried chicken livers, butter fried sweet potatoes or mashed sweet potatoes, turkey meatballs, cheese wedges, Bullies, Merrick sesame sticks, 2-TBS of Haagen-Daz vanilla or butter pecan ice cream, and the occasional non-nitrate cold cut.<br /><br />After tropical storm Debbie swept through Central Florida, I knew I needed to find a nonperishable dog food to stock for the hurricane season in preparation for power outages.<br /><br />I had searched for years for a high quality nontoxic and reasonably priced dog food that Darby and Hampshire would actually eat.  The Organix organic dog food was a hit.  When they see the cans they stand up and take notice.<br /><br />When I opened the can, I could clearly see the difference in quality, and I could certainly smell the difference.  A can of Organix organic dog food is 95% organic, and made is the USA!<br /><br />A typical can contains 7.5% crude protein, 6% crude fat, 1% crude fiber, and 78% moisture.  The feeding recommendations are 3/4 to 1 1/4 per 15 lbs. body weight per day.  The dog food also contains several vitamins (Vitamin E, A, B12, & D3)and minerals.<br /><br />Several of the varities contain organic garlic and thiamine mononitrate which is a synthetic form of vitamin B1.<br /><br />I am so very pleased with this find.  After 4 years, and many bad purchases I've finally found the right food for Darby and Hampshire.  What an awesome dog food.  It really smells and looks like human grade food.<br /><br />I also purchased the Organix dry dog food but Hampshire and Darby both had a week of uncontrollable diareau, and Darby was also vomiting.  I returned the Organix dry food to the store, and they gave me a full refund.<br /><br />The Organix dry dog food made their feces very dark and running and the stains were more difficult than normal to remove.  Darby is 4.6 years and Hampshire is 3.11 years.

review/text: Years ago Heinz provoked national outrage in Britain by threatening to discontinue this classic dressing.<br /><br />As you can see, the upshot is that they still offer it! It's a less thick and gloopy mayonnaise type dressing, with a tang of mustard.<br /><br />It's really lovely with fries, veggies, chicken fingers, on a sandwich...or even with salad! ;)<br /><br />You can't beat this deal for 6 bottles in the US, and it will last for a long time.

I dont know why I have asked them I never got a satisfactory answer,and they have never made it for sale in the USA. the only way I can get it, is to order it through Amazon or the local English shops here who sell English items of food that have to be imported.  It is not expensive in England but quite expensive over here. I think Heinz is missing a good bet not producing it here.

review/text: Having grown up in England, I have continued to search for a good supply of Salad Cream since arriving in the US 9 years ago. It has been hit and miss and despite my desire for this product, I won't pay over the top prices and costly shipping..  So it was wonderful to find it being listed on Amazon at such a good price and free shipping.<br /><br />It is hard to describe the product to anyone who has never tasted it. I eat a lot of sandwiches and prefer to have some dressing that stops it from being to dry.. but I do not want the dressing to take away from the flavour of the filling like most of the US mayonnaises seem to do. Salad cream does not do that for me.

review/summary: a magical condiment - - another British gift to this American!
review/text: Let me begin by saying that I purchased this after debating for years because some people say it tastes like Miracle Whip.  I cannot stand Miracle Whip; in my mouth, it tastes like fish.  Heinz Salad Cream does NOT taste like Miracle Whip.<br /><br />It is a tangy, somewhat mustard-y, somewhat egg-y sauce.  It's thinner--like a creamy salad dressing.  So far, I've used it with deviled aggs, potatoes, potato salad, cold veggies, hot veggies, and its named use--on a salad.  Honestly?  It's amazing.  Many, many years ago, people made salad dressings like this for their "lettuce salads" (check out the "I Love Lucy" episode featuring Aunt Martha's Old-Fashioned Salad Dressing, and you will see what I mean).  It's a tangy, thinner variation on mayo . . . but it adds so much more flavor!  Simply magical.<br /><br />This leaves the often-used ranch dressing in the dust.  Give it a try!  I think you'll be happy you did!

He's already adding it to lots of foods. It's such a versatile sauce. Nice and creamy with that little bit of tang and a slightly eggy taste.<br /><br />I've already come back and subscribed to the auto delivery. I can see that between me, him and my mother ( who also likes it) we will be going through these bottles quickly.
