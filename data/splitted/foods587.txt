review/text: These tinnie greenies make the perfect "out the door" bribe for my Cavlier King Charles Babies. I think they almost look forward to me going to work now.  Barkley is 21 lbs & Gypsy is 18 so while they are a bit larger than the recommended size for the product it really works out perfectly helping keep the pounds off.<br /><br />Having shopped around, you are saving about ten dollars by ordering from Amazon rather than going into a big box pet store.

review/text: Did some research because my dogs have bad breath and dirty teeth. I have tried brushing their teeth with doggie toothpaste and have bought all kinds of chewy treats but nothing worked. So I bought these and gave each dog a treat every morning.  Not only does their breath smell better but their teeth look cleaner as well. I quickly bought a second box. The dogs seem to enjoy the taste and they are made so that the dog can't just gulp them down.  They have to chew them.  I would highly recommend these treats.

review/summary: A noticeable difference in dental health
review/text: I've only given Greenies four stars because they're pretty costly at one Greenie per day (and we have two dogs).  That said, we stopped giving our dogs Greenies for a period of time and there was a significant amount of brown-colored build up around the base of our dogs' teeth.  We started giving them Greenies again and within a short period of time the build-up was gone in most areas and, overall, greatly reduced.  I realize that we could brush our dogs teeth in order to avoid the cost, but neither of us wants to take on this chore; plus, the dogs LOVE Greenies.<br /><br />I used to buy this product at Petsmart, but they're much less expensive on Amazon.

review/text: My two dogs love these.  Now as to do they work.  I honestly do not know.  Both of my dogs are right now at what my vet calls stage two on dental health.  Stage four is the worst on his scale.  I am going to monitor and see IF just maybe they will either still be a stage two in a year or maybe better.  If they maintain at stage two I would love it.  Teeth cleaning on dogs is very expensive so if this product works it will save me big bucks.  Here's hoping!  I will come back and update this after their next check up which should be around August of 2013.

review/text: Nothing negative to say about this buying experience.  My dog loves Greenies, and this was a better price than what I have seen elsewhere.  Treats like this, along with regular dental care (brushing her teeth and getting her teeth professionally cleaned by a vet) means that my dog's breath is nice and she is healthier.  My dog is 7kgs (around 15 lbs)and this is a perfect size for her.  The packaging keeps these treats fresh - inside the box is an airtight resealable bag.

review/summary: freshens breath
review/text: I have a (now) 6 month old miniature daschund puppy. I bought these for her about two months ago when I started to be a little bothered by her breath (she's a kisser). I bought them from amazon because they were so much cheaper then at the local pet store.<br />At first, she had no interest in them. I was a little annoyed, having bought a box of 96 that was still expensive for dog treats even with the discount. She either would ignore it no matter how many times I tried reintroducing it, or take a bite then leave it. It took a few weeks and several tries, but now she loves them and eats them as soon as I give it to her. I give her at most one a day but usually one every two or three days. It hasn't upset her stomach or anything like that. The package says they aren't suitable for dogs under 6 months of age, but I stared giving them to her at about 4 months and there were no problems. She has clean, healthy teeth, but I don't think she wouldn't if I stopped giving her these. They do work in freshening her breath, however. We have a 3 year old golden retriever in the house who eats these sometimes too and has loved them since the day they came- I guess it just depends on the dog. Even though they're not the correct size for him, he's never choked and I don't think it's a problem to buy the smaller size for a larger dog. I'd definitely recommend these if you want your dog's breath freshened!

review/text: I bought these for my 9 yr old dog because the vet said she had stage 4 dental disease, and we really couldn't afford the $300+ price of teeth cleaning for her. I decided to give her one Greenie everyday and see if it improved her teeth and gums. I have been giving her one a day for almost two months and her back teeth look so much better! I am very happy with this little experiment and she is too. She reminds me every night when it's time for her Greenie treat. She still has a slight issue with one of her front teeth, but I think it's because she mainly chews the Greenies on her back teeth. Such a great item. Much cheaper on Amazon than at the pet store.

Thanks to Amazon prices, my dogs have this little luxury.

review/text: So far so good. My dog seems to love this things. They do stink when you open the box so beware. I don't know how well they preventing the plaque from building up on his teeth only time will tell. 4stars based on potential good it will do for my dog and the fact that he loves them. You do get alot to last you for 96 days b/c it only says to give one a day so I think that will be adequate time to fully evaluate. I'll update when that time comes but for now it's worth giving it a shot.

review/summary: Our Dogs LOVE These and We Do Too!
review/text: I have been feeding our dogs Greenie bones since they first came out and we have NEVER had a problem.  I have German Shepards, Dobermans and medium sized hound dogs.  They all love their GB's and I find that because our Dobie tends to be a "garbage belly" (meaning she'll eat anything!), so sometimes she doesn't smell as nice as she should, really benefits from the "green" in Greenie Bones.  I would like to know where "E. Antic" gets his/her information from.....as I can find nothing that says they are "deadly", except for those people that haven't done responsible research (not just hearsay from some list).  If your dogs are gulpers or greedy chewers, then I wouldn't feed them ANYTHING, especially RAWHIDE, that could be gulped and swallowed in large pieces or whole.  Do we need to bring up "NYLABONES"?????  Always be a responsible dog owner and supervise your dogs when giving any kind of treats.  Please don't be afraid of Greenie Bones because of E. Antic's post.  You can buy Greenie's in singles, so try one before you commit to a whole box.  I have friends that have dogs that don't really like them and that's okay.  My girls live for their morning GB's and I now give them Greenie "Smart Biscuits" for an afternoon snack.  They love the taste and we love them for the 'benefits'!!<br /><br />I respectfully request that Amazon and Amazon members make up their own minds, and not fall to the 'fear mongers' and ignorance amoung us.  Always supervise your dogs when giving treats - after all, they are the animals and we are supposed to be the 'smart' ones.....don't be afraid, do your homework, it always pays!

review/summary: my lil' beast is crazy for greenies!!
review/text: i still worry about the rumored threat to dogs from these treats, but they have changed the formula so i am assuming all is well with them.  and i am assuming since they are front and center in most pet places that they are safe.  and my italian greyhound is obsessed with them.  they make her (usually hideous) breath smell fresh and clean and have really made a difference in the cleanliness of her teeth.  i always make sure to watch her while she's eating it, not only for her safety, but because it is freaking adorable to watch her chew on it.  just a tip, these are cheaper from entirelypets from amazon.  http://www.amazon.com/Greenies-Dental-Chews-ounce-Teenie/dp/B001CWEC2W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=home-garden&qid=1266273814&sr=8-1

review/summary: My Dog's Favorite- and Amazon's the Place to Get Them!
review/text: My German Shepherd is a complete Greenie addict.  She knows when they're in the house.  She knows which cupboard they're kept in.  She knows what time of day she's supposed to get hers.  Her vet compliments her on her pretty white teeth, although some of that credit definitely has to go to the fact that my husband and I brush her teeth with one of those finger-toothbrushes and kiddie toothpaste (no fluoride, so safe if she swallows it), but I do know my dog chews a Greenie at least enough to get pieces between her teeth, and at four years old, she doesn't have the kind of doggie breath that knocks you over if she breathes in your face.  I do believe that some of the ingredients in Greenies help breath from within, so even if your dog inhales his or her Greenie, there's still some benefit.<br /><br />My only complaint about Greenies is that they're expensive.  There's no denying that.  If you do the math on this tub of 17, we're talking about a dollar and forty-seven cents apiece.  So I can see why that might stop some people in their tracks, and I understand.  As for my dog, she's on a limited diet because she's allergic to a lot of things that are standard ingredients in a lot of dog food and dog treats.  I feel like I've been a little bit trained myself, not to bat an eye at this price, and she definitely makes me at least a dollar and a half's worth of happy every day.<br /><br />If you're looking at the Greenies in the 17-piece tub, considering them for purchase, though, I'm guessing your canine is also a Greenie addict, like mine.  You're going to buy them anyway, and if you get the free shipping, Amazon's the place to get them.

review/summary: Greenies - Catnip for dogs
review/text: I have been using Greenies for years, including the older formula that reportedly had digestion problems. However, we never have had any problems with Greenies. Just make sure you get the appropriate size for your dog. I have never seen a dog that could resist a Greenie. They will start doing tricks never seen before once you bring them into the house. They do help with their breath, teeth cleaning and training and we normally use them as "well earned" treats (they aren't the cheapest thing in the treat world). I just ordered 4, 27 oz. tubs of the Teenies (we have Papillons) and I know our dogs will enjoy every one of them. Never have to worry about our dogs getting fat eating these as we do not give them multiple times a day. The new formula reportedly has solved the digestibility problem and the manufacturer claims is now more digestible than normal dog food. In the original formula, the problem usually involved incidents when dogs just tried to swallow them whole or get it down in 2 bites. Our dogs always chewed them into small pieces avoiding any problems. Believe me, your dogs will love them.

review/summary: such great treats!
review/text: I give these to my dog to help with her minor tartar problems. She LOVES them and they definitely do the job.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about them is that they are sturdy and coated enough that I can freeze them--I put one in a small plastic bag (snack bag folded in half) full of water and freeze it for a few hours. Then my dog has to lick and crunch up the ice to get to the treat, which keeps her busy AND gets her more fluids. Most dog treats tend to dissolve and become mushy when you do this with them, but these guys definitely hold up.

After 2 weeks of using the treats, her teeth looked a lot better and the nasty odor was gone.  The reason for the 4 stars is because of the expense, which for me is times 2.

review/summary: It's like crack for dogs...
review/text: First some history:<br />Our dog can't chew rawhide bones.  She has a habit of breaking off pieces & swallowing them whole.  We have had problems with blockages & constipation as a result -- everytime she has received a rawhide.<br /><br />We have a 13 yr old Beagle which was introduced to Greenies about 2 yrs ago.  We were given a couple of the Large ones from a friend to try.  Through carelessness on our part, our dog destroyed both large treats within 15 minutes.  When we found her, we were scared figuring she would die from swallowing this large plasticky looking treat.  We quickly did some web searches & found out that the newer formula is supposed to dissolve rather easily with water.  After making sure she drank a good amount of water, we monitored her activity.  In the end, she had no problems & we were able to find a treat that is more chewable than your biscuit type treats, but safer than rawhide (at least for her).  We have tried many different treats & toys, but have NEVER had the type of response that we get from giving her a Greenie.  It seriously is like crack for dogs...

review/summary: Addictive to dogs
review/text: It's got something in there that is like crack for dogs. I buy the largest size I can find. I like them better than rawhide, for what they do. Rawhide strips or bones, when the dog gets down to that last part are slimy unswallowable messes that I've had to reach in and remove from the dog's throat. Nylabones edibles gave the dog the runs. Pressed rawhide chunks did the same. Greenies don't affect his digestion at all, and he's crazy about them. He has destroyed a Kong or two in his time.<br /><br />I don't know how much is due to his genes or to the greenies, but my 12 year old dog has better teeth than many 5 year olds.<br /><br />Like any other edible chew treat, however, don't leave your dog unattended until he's finished it.

But there was NO smell! Zilch. Zip. Nada.

review/text: Updates: One Day, One Week, Two Weeks, One Month, Three Months, Six Months<br /><br />One Day<br />-------<br />Ordered these yesterday and they came in today, even with Prime two-day shipping - Thanks Amazon!  I gave one to my dachshund, a short-haired 25-lb ball of energy, and he loved it.  He's 10 years old and had typical dog breath.  I'm hoping that giving these to him will not only make his breath less stinky, but also (and more importantly) help out with his teeth.  Whenever he yawns or opens his mouth wide, I can see some plaque on his rear teeth.  The vet hasn't said anything bad about that when I've brought it up, but he no longer rips on his rope toys like he used to.  Sure, some of his loss of love for tug of war can be attributed to age, but I think maybe his teeth are a bit weaker too.  I'll update this according to the schedule I laid out at the very top and let you know what happens.  I've also seen lots of reviews online (not about this product, but about dog- and pet-food in general) being made out of sub par or even unhealthy materials.  I'll let you know if my dog's behavior or overall health changes as well.<br /><br />One Week<br />-------<br />My dog is still loving these things.  I feed him in the morning so I like to think these are an evening snack for him.  I don't know what exactly the dental chews are made from, but I'm able to bend the little green toothbrush-shaped chews into a "U" and they don't seem to break.  Perhaps it's some kind of gel or gummy chew?  His breath seems a little less "heavy".  His teeth seem to be the same. His behavior hasn't changed either, other than being extremely excited to get a chew at night.  This last bit is important to me, because I know some dog treats can be more like dog-crack!<br />See you in a week!<br /><br />Eventually<br />--------<br />Sorry I didn't keep up to my schedule - I think these things work, though not as well as I'd hoped.  My dog still has lots of plaque and buildup on his rear teeth and more disturbingly these things have caused my dog to frequently urinate in my house.  I suspect they are making him drink a lot of water which he can't hold in.  I walk him three times a day and put him outside two to three more times so there's no issue on my end.<br />My ultimate conclusion is that these are just OK.  They aren't damaging to my dog's health... but to say they were helpful in improving his dental situation would be giving these too much credit.<br />My S&S shipments have been cancelled and I'm out looking for a better product.

review/summary: Buy the sample size first!
review/text: My pekingese loves these!She is known to be quite a picky eater,so I ordered the sample size( called a 'mini-treat pak' of the Greenies first to see if she'd like them.( I believe the sample size =22 of the 'Teenie' size). She ended up loving them,so I kept the small zip-lock pouch the sample size came in. I just take about 20 of the Greenies at a time from the large 96 chews container and refill the zip-lock pouch.*It also is a great way to bring some Greenies along with you when you are traveling with your dog!<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JQCJIG">Greenies Treats for Dogs (5-15 lbs/2-7 kg)Mini Treat-Pak-Teenie 6 oz</a>

review/text: I have three dogs.  They all loved the Greenies.  One dog does not chew her food, but gulps it whole.  I had to cut the Greenies into smaller portions for her.  It does help clean teeth, but caused diarrhea.  I think I'll look for another product for teeth cleaning.

review/summary: Love 'em!
review/text: I buy these directly from amazon because they're always cheaper than I can find them at local pet stores. My dog goes absolutely crazy for the Greenies Lite. I'd originally started him off on the normal greenies but switched to the Lite about a year ago and he loves these just as much. I recently had to get the normal greenies because they were out of Lite and my dog wouldn't go near them; thank goodness I purchased the normal ones at a place where they took returns.<br /><br />I give my guy a few throughout the day as treats so I just bend and twist them in half; otherwise my dachshund/pekingese mix will demand more and at roughly $30 a box, I'd go broke if I gave him as many as he could eat. As long as the box is fresh, the greenies will be nice and bendable... I have purchased a box on a few occasions where the greenies were rock hard.<br /><br />My only complaint is the price. I just wish they were a tad lower. Even still, I will keep buying these as they're my dog's fave treats.

review/summary: My dog loves these
review/text: Greenies are one of my English Bulldog's favorite treats.  They are a bit on the expensive side, but if you get them on Amazon instead of one of the large Pet stroe chains, you get a better deal.  I tried the Costco brand of dental chews (they were about half the price) and they disagreed with my dog's stomach so I came back to Greenies.  I usually break them in half and put it in is kong toy so it's like a puzzle for him to get it out.  If I just give it to him he eats it really quickly.  Overall, Greenies are a great product.

review/summary: Greenies for a picky eater
review/text: I had to pay a fortune to have our dog's teeth cleaned. Plus it was a difficult thing for her...she got very upset and was in pain for a few days. So I started using Greenies, and wow...they have her scheduled for a teeth cleaning that I will cancel, because it has kept her teeth so clean. Best of all, though, she is a very picky eater. Most things that are supposedly flavored to please dogs do not please her. She just won't eat them, but Greenies for teeth...she can't wait to have them. I just ask her if she wants to brush her teeth, and she is ready and waiting. The other night I got out her pills to give her for arthritis and made the mistake of getting out the greenie at the same time. She didn't want the pills although they were covered in peanut butter, which she usually loves. Once she finished the greenie, she wanted the "peanut butter pills."

review/text: Greenies are great dental chews that keep my dog with minimal plaque.<br />My 3 yr old loves it.<br />The price of the 96 Teenie Pack (or more) from Amazon is unbeatable.<br /><br />Of note, my dog didn't like it very much when he tried it the first time when he was 2 months old. He grew to love it more and more. So don't give up and give it to someone else if your puppy is not crazy about them from the first day.

review/summary: Great Deal!!
review/text: Our dogs adore these and they are usually fairly pricey for the amount you get. However Amazon always has one great deal or another for buying these and significantly cheaper than in store prices.<br /><br />We usually buy the 130 or 96 pack of 'Teenies' for our two chihuahua mix dogs (depending whichever has the better sale price at the time.<br /><br />The teenie size is great for our smaller dog (6lb) as he can fully chew on it and savor it. However it is not quite enough for our other chihuahua mix (13lb) she tends to gulp it down like any other dog treat without getting as much benefit from the dental cleaning that Greenies are supposed to help with. Now that she is a little larger (she loved these as a pup) I think we may 'graduate' her to the next size of Greenie.<br /><br />I have always found that our dogs look forward to their Greenie treats and see them as a special treat which is great because keeping a dogs dental health in check is important and I find Greenies do help with this and yet are delicious to the dog.<br /><br />Our larger dog has been given Greenies for two years now and her teeth are still almost entirely stain free and her breath is not as bad as some dogs. However I would not use Greenies solely to keep a dogs breath in check, I recommend getting some other product for that.

review/summary: Greenies are awesome!!
review/text: My dogs go crazy for these!! I was worried for their safety since I had heard some negative reviews for these chews, so I did some research and found that the most common problem is from choking.  They do chomp them down so I have them eat it while I'm nearby in case they choke (haven't yet).  Their teeth and gums are clean and strong so that saves $$ on dental bills.  I don't like the idea of having them go under general anesthesia just to get their teeth cleaned (seems much riskier), so I will continue to take the "risk" with Greenies. Amazon price for these, even with shipping costs, are still the lowest. And my dogs get to bark at the FedEx guy!!

She wants one all the time! Her bowel movements are not affected by them in a negative way. The only thing I would say that is a con is that they don't last very long! She eats them pretty quickly even though the material of them is pretty rock solid and her mouth is tiny.
