review/text: My puppy Jake has had these treats since he was very young.  He is now 7 months old and still goes crazy every time I put my hand in the package.  Great for training.  I love that they sell the larger bag on Amazon as I can only find the smaller size in the Pet stores.  All natural and wheat and soy free is the best feature.

review/summary: My dogs love them!
review/text: I tried Zukes Minis after they were suggested by a vet tech as a great treat for training my new puppy.  They are soft and easy to cut into even smaller pieces so you can use a lot of them during training sessions.  The price through Amazon beats the pet and feed store prices by a long way, so I bought 3 large bags of different flavors.  The bags zip shut, so the treats stay fresh.  I just take out a handful and cut them in quarters, and keep them in another ZipLoc bag, enough for a few training sessions.  I cut them using both a pill cutter and a knife; I think using a knife is easier.  In their whole uncut size, they are only 4 calories each, so they are not a fattening treat either.  A great product I feel good about using.

review/text: Zuke's Mini Naturals are a favorite at our house.  They are small and very low in calories so you can treat generously.  They are perfect for training rewards.  My dog seems to enjoy the soft, chewy texture versus hard biscuits.  They come in chicken and salmon flavors as well.

review/text: My rottweiler-mix loves these treats!  Each morsel is about the size of your pinky fingernail, so these treats are perfect for training.  It's a struggle to keep my big girl svelte.  I don't have to break the treats in half, and I can give her these treats  without worrying that she'll turn into a sausage.  Because she likes them so much, I never feel like I'm depriving her.  The bag is re-sealable and keeps the treats soft.  If the treats happen to dry out, just put a moist paper towel in the bag, and they will re-absorb the moisture.

review/summary: Great size, but not my dog's favorite
review/text: I bought these treats for the size. We go through a lot of treats on walks with our dog, who has some leash issues. I get frustrated with crumbs in my pockets and breaking up treats during walks. He is a picky fellow when it comes to treats. These are, in fact, a great size, but they dry out quickly as others have commented. I can live with that, but I think they may also lose flavor. My dog has become less and less interested in them, and it's to the point now where he seems to eat them as a favor to me. For the price, I can find more appealing treats elsewhere and live with permanent crumbs in my pocket.

review/text: These treats are small and are perfect for training treats. Plus, my dog absolutely loves them. She can get distracted by other dogs when walking, but when I consistently use these as a reward, her behavior quickly changes for the better. Her trainer recommended making small cooked hot dog treats. I think these are just as attractive, but a lot healthier for her - and easier for me.<br /><br />Do use the bag seal. She doesn't like them nearly as well if they get dried out. I use a small ziploc snack bag to put some in when walking her.

review/summary: The perfect training treats
review/text: Training usually requires lots of positive reinforcement (read: treats) for young dogs, so these treats are the perfect bite size rewards to use when training or rewarding your dog. They do give off an unpleasant scent when you open the bag, but hopefully you aren't the one eating them so this won't matter. And for those of you label-readers, these things are made with all-natural ingredients that are great for your dog.

review/summary: Zukes Mini Naturals
review/text: During training of Kaylee, our 75 lb. German Shepherd, we found that she does not like anything (treats or food) in large chunks. She is just a "dainty" eater and even the smallest Milk Bones dog biscuits were too big for her liking. When my neice gave her a bag of Zukes Mini Naturals for her 1st birthday she went crazy for them! They are PERFECT for training and she responds wonderfully. I highly recommend these if your dog is a "dainty" eater (I've never had one before) and even if they will swallow a hot dog whole (like my last dog, a Lab) these Mini naturals will be loved.<br />Bob

review/summary: Perfect training treat!!
review/text: This treat amazing for training!<br /><br />I'm writing this in regards to my 5 month old puppy, somewhat food motivated, and my 12 year old lab mix, extremely food motivated.  I can't say how the treats would do for a very fussy dog.<br /><br />It never crumbles in your pocket but splits easily for giving small training rewards.  It's tiny enough to use a bunch without filling up your dog.  It has good ingredients.  It doesn't mess with the puppy's digestion.<br /><br />The only possible drawback is that it's smelly.  Not gross, just smells like fish.  They love the treats and I'm sure the odor has something to do with it, but they also can smell it on you, so you can't surprise them with a treat.<br /><br />Overall, the go-to treat for training, rewarding, and stuffing in toys to prevent separation anxiety.

review/text: My 5 month old Lab mix enjoys these treats (but he seems to enjoy any food) and I love the small size since we're still training him.  The smell isn't so great so you can't just stash a handful in your pocket unless you want your pocket to smell like them.  I knocked off 1 star in my rating just because of the smell, but if you keep the bag sealed at all times, you won't smell anything and it will keep the treats fresh.  I found the same item at my local pet store in NYC (Tribeca area) for $1 less than Amazon so I was a bit shocked that it's cheaper there than Amazon.

Plus they are absolutely tiny (pencil eraser size). I am surprised other people cut them up, when they are so small already! I also prep and freeze a Kong for her overnight to have while we're at work, and these are the perfect size to plug up the smaller hole in a Large sized kong!<br />We have only tried the chicken flavor so far, and she loves them! They do dry out if left out, but that doesn't seem to decrease their delicious-ness factor with her. Finally, Amazon does have the best price around on them, so if you're looking for healthy, dog approved treats, go for Zuke's minis!

These treats will dry out if left unsealed for a pretty long period of time (many days, a week?), so don't take out too many at once, but even dried she still loves them.<br /><br />If you're on the fence, definitely get them :)

I like it because it is easy to tear the treats down to smaller sizes to make the product last.  The treat is semi smelly which is good because it helps focus are dog.<br /><br />The reason for the 4 stars is that my dog is very picky and she will defintilty try harder for certain treats.  She does like the Zukes but  she does respond better to more raw types of meat treats that we get at a specialty dog store.

review/summary: Great training treat! Puppy loves them.
review/text: We are using these treats for training and they work great.  Small treats so you can do a lot of training without a lot of calories.  Recommended for sure.  We are also giving the puppy the chicken flavored ones and mixing it up for her. She likes those ones also.<br />I did leave a couple of treats out of the pouch and they did dry up, so keep them in an airtight container, the pouch the come in, or a ziplock baggy.

review/summary: Great Quick Treats
review/text: I love these treats for training! They are small but very tasty (or at least me dog seems to think so). Since they don't require her to chew, she does not get as distracted when being rewarded, so I am able to keep her focus better while teaching her. I haven't tried the other flavors yet, but will definitely give them a shot.

review/summary: perfect for training
review/text: My dog does agility so we give her Zuke's when we train. The treat is pretty smelly which is why we use them (a smelly treat will keep her attention).  She will pefrorm for Zuke's they dont seem to be her favorite treat (she performs best for bellyrybs a freezed dried liver which is too big to give as a regular treat)however in training she may eat 10 -15 treats so perhaps she gets tired of them.  The reason for the 4 stars is the treat is semi moist they do tend to dry out if left exposed for too long or if you improperly seal the bag.  Also my rating is based on my dogs preference for several other types of treats (on treats she will love she will knock our other dog down to get the treat).

review/text: I just opened a bag of these mini naturals in chicken flavor, and did some training with my two shelties.  Within a few samples of the treat, my dogs were doing whatever I asked, quickly, and for quite a long time.  I've never had their undivided attention for such a long training session.<br /><br />I will keep ordering these for training.  Clearly my dogs see these as a high value reward.  I will swap flavors to keep them interested.<br /><br />Good price for such a quality product as well.  Nothing made in China.

review/text: This is such a great treat -- really small but enough to satisfy.  The only thing I'll warn against is that they can harden up within a few weeks.  So, I would suggest buying more of the smaller bags as opposed to the 1 pound bigger bag that they sell, unless you have several dogs and will go through these pretty quickly.

review/text: I bought these at a pet store prior to amazon and paid probably double the amount ($6 something). My dog loves it, and I give it to her as a reward for staying while being groomed, or pooping and peeing outside. She always wants more. Of course I only give her 2 at a time. These would last forever since there are so many in a bag. Amazon has these for like $3 something, great for getting up to $25 free shipping thresh hold too. My dog loves these and they do not irratate her stomach in any way as the ingredients are natural, meaty, no filler and healthy for her. The treats themselvesa re moist and smells like meat. Dogs do love moist treats more than dry treats, so the yare great for training. Highly recommend it.

Although it took a few sniffs to get him to try them, he now loves these.  We just used them to teach him to shake hands, and it took less than a day for him to learn his new trick with the Zuke's.  I would definitely recommend these.  (BTW, we also tried the beef Z filets, which he also loves).

No "doggie junk food" to be had in our household, no corn, no by-products, no treats pressed and colored to look like mini T-bone steaks (unfortunately, I don't eat as well as she does.... Doritos can pass as a meal for me).  She's been known to spit out treats that didn't meet her standards.<br /><br />Not so with these Zuke's Mini Naturals.  These really get her attention, and they were vital in training her to go potty as soon as I let her out into the backyard, to let me brush her teeth, and to walk nicely on a leash (nothing on our walks is more interesting than Mama or Daddy in possession of Zuke's Minis).  My little sheltie comes running at the crinkle of the bag.<br /><br />She loves all three flavors: Peanut Butter, Salmon, & Chicken.  It's amazing to find a product like this, where the flavor of the treat, chicken, comes from chicken being the first ingredient on the ingredient list.  The texture is soft, not crunchy, and they don't fall apart in your pocket, nor are they greasy or stinky.<br /><br />These Zuke's Mini Natural treats are the best, I'll continue to buy them again and again.

review/summary: Best dog treat - great for training
review/text: We have a 10-month-old boxer and found a trainer to work with us.  The trainer recommended these treats for training because they're small and the dog doesn't have to stop and chew and chew between activities.  Also, these chicken and salmon treats seem to have healthier ingredients than most other dog treats.  Truthfully, I am not an expert on what's good or bad for dogs nutritionally, but I'm sitting here looking at two dog treat bags.  One has dried whey, palm kernel oil, sugar, dicalcium phosphate, maltodextrin, defatted peanut flour, salt, soy lecithin and caramel.  Basically sounds like candy.  Mini naturals have chicken, ground barley, ground rice, lots of vitamins...no detectable sugars.  Maybe dogs don't need the grains, but the protein-based, no-sugar recipe seems like a better choice.  Try a bag and if you don't like them, you can return the unused portion to the company for a full refund.

review/text: This is one of the few brands that have treats appropriately small enough for my Chiuaua-mix. But, having been the owner of a large dog, these would also be great for training large dogs.  Dogs don't really have a sense of size- they're as happy with a small bite as a much larger treat! And you don't want you're dog to be too busy chewing when you want to keep his/her attention and repeat a behavior.  These treats are just the right size!

There was a cute yorkie that we were petting and we told the owner we had Chihuahuas. He was buying Zukes and absolutely raved about the treats. He recommended the chicken but we purchased the peanut butter treat. We keep the treats in the fridge. My dogs LOVE these treats. If we open the fridge they are right there. The size is perfect for training. I can't say enough great things about the product, healthy and it makes my dogs happy.

review/summary: Great Training Treat
review/text: My dogs loves these soft and stinky treats! They are great for training because they are small enough you can give a lot of  them and not be concerned about giving your dog to much food. They also have healthy ingredients and are one of the treats my sensetive GSD can have =0)

review/summary: Great size for training but absolutely unbearable smell
review/text: I thought these looked perfect for training so I gave them a try.  The problem is that even in a sealed bag inside a separate sealed ziplock, the smell of these treats is unbearable.  We tried keeping them in the car, but the car would retain the horrible smell for days.  We eventually ending up keeping them in a sealed container in the back yard until the bag was gone.  If you touch them with your fingers, your hand will smell of them until you can wash your hands.  Disappointing as they are a perfect size for training, but I will not buy them again.  I wish they would make a similar treat without the odor.

review/summary: Great for training and dogs who just love getting treats!
review/text: I originally bought a 6 ounce bag of these treats at my local pet store for 4$ a bag.  The owner recommended them because they are made from healthy items, and they are only 3 calories a treat.  The low calorie and healthy ingredients are a big plus when you are feeding them to your dog as a reward for training.<br /><br />The treats are moist, but do not leave a greasy residue on your hands if you are holding a bunch as rewards. The treats have a slight smell, but not anywhere near as much as some of the other moist treats on the market.  They are small in size, but provide quick satisfaction to my 50 pound dog and have really helped her learning process.<br /><br />As an amusing anecdote, my 6 pound Siamese/tiger mix loves the treats as well! Whenever she hears the bag, she comes running and will sit and "assist" me in training the dog, as long as she gets her fair share as well!

review/summary: They sound great but...
review/text: They smell HORRIBLE!  I bought a bag of these, expecting them to smell like chicken but instead I got a huge whiff of some gross chemical smell.  I didn't even give them to my dogs because I felt like the smell was just too wrong.  Call me crazy but "natural" dog treats shouldn't smell like chemicals at all.  Plus, what the heck are all of the chemical names at the end of the ingredients list?  Doesn't sound very natural to me.<br /><br />I think I'll be sticking with Natural Pups since their treats actually smell like the flavors they're supposed to be and they're way healthier.

review/summary: Salmon Treats have strong smell
review/text: Sadly my dog is NOT fond of these even though she does like salmon and anything smelly! She will eat them (the first treat she rolled on as she'll do if I give her lox) but she won't do tricks for them and acts as if they were a run of the mill dog food instead of a treat. Both my mate and I found the smell rather unpleasant similar to old B vitamins or really old liver treats, not like salmon..<br />(FYI My is dog is medium sized black mutt.)<br />UPDATE:My dog seems to be getting used to these to some degree she will now do some tricks perhaps she prefers them a little dried out (they are still soft)or even maybe she was addicted to other treats though I usually only give her wheat and gluten free treats like freeze dried liver and dogswell treats..Perhaps she's stil not crazy about them because these treats do have natural gluten in the form of malted barley and ground barley (Not that good for me in terms of cross contamination as I am gluten sensitive and perhaps she is too?) Left a message for Zukes' but never heard back from them.. They are convenient in that they are small

review/summary: Perfect treat for training and other things
review/text: I've bought Zukes Mini Treats, chicken for such a long time.  I heard about it on TV series.  So when I checked at a store, they, to me, were expensive, some sites are better.<br /><br />BUT Amazon, so far, beats all prices.  I never thought that these treats would work so fast, it's amazing. Yes I saw it on TV, since I'm not sure one is allowed to say which series it is, I won't say what it is.<br /><br />First time I bought Zukes, 1 pound, (got two dogs), I bought it long ago, with other products, and like I wrote, both dogs learned fast, everytime I train, or make sure they always are good, mainly outside, they actually know I have those mini Chicken treats...probably the smell, and we have 2 Labs, so I guess it's the smell.<br /><br />First time I used them, it was only when they gave positive reaction.  I was quit surprised it didn't take long as dogs do remember, so when I give command, and they listen, I praise them, give them each the treat.<br /><br />I also got one of those treat packages, comes in handy outside.<br /><br />I have to say they remember better than I do, meaning when I say something new, a new learning thing, it seemed, at at least to me, that they knew if they did it, they'd get a treat.<br /><br />I want to make clear that although on occassion on some dogs, it takes longer to learn, but they do.  But also, there WILL come a time that they just do what they're told, like "not try to dig under fence, or try to go after Cats", that they actually do listen, but when they come inside doggie door when I call them, they sit and wait before going in the house.  So, yes, I give each of them one mini chicken treat.<br />Then they go in the house, and they both play.<br /><br />But in the house, if or when things get out hand, like door bell ringing, the best word for me that I taught was a stern "NO!" that takes their attention off the door.<br /><br />Here's a tip, another thing I used a long time ago...because dogs do what dogs do, meaning we have so many cats in the neighborhood, not easy to get them in the house.<br /><br />I started with a clicker, inside house, they know that clicking sound they get the mini chicken treat.  That, at last for us, WORKS ALL THE TIME.<br /><br />I really don't know what else to say, other than if anyone is going to try the treats, make sure you try the chicken first, they seem, at least our dogs, love that chicken.  One pound of those treats are far better price than 8oz.<br /><br />Just make sure it comes from Amazon, anything over $25.00 you don't pay postage. (unless you don't care about postage, or you're rich..lol )<br /><br />The 3rd parties also, I found, but ONLY SOMETIMES, they also don't charge postage.  What I'm trying to say is if economy is hurting you, then just take the time, as I do, and just check out the prices.<br /><br />If anyone has any questions, or even suggestions as I always like suggestions, please feel free to contact me.<br /><br />Now I feel better doing the review. I should have done more reviews, I plead guilty to that.  In a way, this was fun to do.  Thank you for reading my review, and hope, especially if you have hard time training, hope you try these treats.<br /><br />Just remember THIS, never YELL, or NEVER EVER hit your dog, that is so wrong, especially if it's trained, and somebody wants to pet him/her, the dog will DEFINATELY think he or she might be hit.  Dogs are, indeed, smarter than people realize, and from 1967 til present, I always find out new things about our dogs, as we adopt them, they are wonderful animals to have, they WILL protect you, LOVE you, and do anything for you.<br /><br />I know this to be true..., so believe me when I say Dogs are great, my view is GREAT for us Senior Citizens, they do protect us, and in my case one literally saved my life in July, 2008.<br /><br />So reminding you if anyone has any questions, please ask, or recommendations, that's cool too, always listen to recommendations. :-)

review/text: These treats may be great for some dogs, but my golden did not like the taste.  I had hoped to use them as small training treats (such as the BilJac liver treats), but she would have nothing to do with either the peanut butter or the salmon flavor. The salmon variety has a very strong "fishy" smell, too.

review/summary: Sour Smell emailed company
review/text: I received the Zukes Chicken Mini's a couple of days ago. I opened the bag and the smell that came out of it was a sour almost vinegar smell, much like pickles in away. I fed the dogs one each then thought I better not give them anymore. I emailed the company and asked if that was normal. Matt the contact sent this message:<br /><br />Hi Kerrie-<br /><br />They are definitely strong in smell. If you have not smelled them before<br />they may seem a little odd smelling. The dogs think they are candy! They<br />should be perfectly fine. One thing to check is the bottom/underside of<br />the bag and make sure the "best by" date is still good. If that is in<br />range I would say everything is good to feed to your dog. Thank You for<br />your inquiry and for supporting Zuke's!<br /><br />Matt Porray<br />"Bone Counselor"<br />Customer Service<br />Zuke's<br /><br />They date on the bag is for November 2013 so they are well within the expiration date.<br />But I emailed a friend (who in the past has donated many bags of Zukes treats to the dog club I used to belong for training classes) and I asked her the same question she felt they were not safe to feed with them smelling sour (vinegar like). I had never fed the chicken flavor before.<br />I think Iwill be sending these back. I am very disappointed, I don't mind treats that stink I feed a freeze dried green trip treat those really smell. The Zukes didn't smell like something even dogs would eat.

review/summary: Who Says Dog Treats Are Just For Dogs?
review/text: Once again, Zuke's has made a snack that'll give you an attack. I have always been a fan of dog food for as long as I can remember. It is cheap, delicious, and for the most part very easy on the bowels. Zuke's Chicken-Flavored Mini Naturals remind us all that dog treats are yummy for people, too.<br /><br />Zukes is taking us back. Back to the basics. 16 ounces of pure chicken delight, crisp and crunchy. And if you happen to have a dog, this is a treat you can share with your pet. It does not actually taste like chicken, more of a seitan meatloaf, but it tastes better than most chickens I have eaten. (I grew up on a farm in Virginia, so that's a big deal!)<br /><br />Treat yourself to Zuke's chicken-flavored treats. And maybe you can give one to your dog, too!

review/summary: Zero stars if I could
review/text: Less than 24 hours after my four year old dog ate a Zuke's "all-natural" bone, she developed pancreatitis!!! There was no other change in her diet, environment or anything but that Zuke's bone. When I took her to the vet, she was dehydrated from vomiting and diarrhea... and she had to stay at the vet for three days. Over $1,000 in vet bills later, I gave Zuke's hq a call to let them know. While symphathetic, basically Zuke's gave me a $15 check to cover the cost of the bone, but failed to take responsibility for the incident, even though the vet wrote a note saying the bone was the most likely cause. Stay away from this and all Zuke's "all-natural" products!

review/summary: First Ingredient: Peanut Butter.... My Dog Loves Them
review/text: WOW.  NOTE:  No Wheat, Corn, Soy, Artificial Colors, Flavors and no Added Fat or By-Products.  On the Label, the first ingredient is Peanut Butter.  Made in USA.<br /><br />My chihuahua loves these things.  Although they are small, they are not as tiny as the berrybuddies we tried first (I don't even know what to do with those, they fall out at alarming rates from the buddy-toys hole).<br /><br />These - - he can chew, it's like he's eating peanut butter for a moment.  He doesn't just woof them down - he actually eats them.  I give him one at a time, and he sits and chews it for 10-20 seconds - much like peanut butter I would imagine.  They fit perfectly in the KONG toys (but not the busybuddy ones, they are smaller holes).<br /><br />The chicken ones were a bit too flavored for him - so I pinch them in half and add a few to his food - then he loves it - mixed with his food & warm water.  I want to try all the flavors!<br /><br />I also like that the company supports a cause with each bag purchased.  Very natural, very chewy little things, and my dog LOVES them.  Very good value.  Will be keeping these around for sure.

review/summary: Perfect!
review/text: The Zuke's Chicken Flavored Treats are just what I was hoping they would be! I got the chicken flavor (despite other claims of serious odor) because it was the cheapest flavor. My dog LOVES them. Her affinity for them, coupled with their size makes them perfect for training.  They are small little cylinders which are about 1/4" thick and less than 1/2" wide. They are enough to keep her interest, but not too substantial that they distract from training as she's chewing, as usually happens with a biscuit-type treat. They are also great for use inside the Kong Genius Leo (I have a size Large). They are thinner than a similar treat by a different brand which I found at my local Petco. I like that they're smaller because the other ones would get stuck in the tube of the Leo. These slide in and out without much friction at all. I don't find the odor to be as offensive as others have described. The odor is about average for moist treats, in my opinion. In fact, they smell very similar to my cat's treats.  So much so that my cat tries to steal them when I lay them on the floor while the dog is practicing "stay."  Also, you really can't beat the value! Treats can go so quickly when used during training and it's nice to find a quality treat that doesn't break the bank! I will definitely be buying these again!

review/text: These treats are relatively healthy when compared to the competition. They could be better by excluding grains and salt but they are treats after all. These are made in the USA which is a big bonus and they do not contain ethoxyquin which is a harmful preservative found in many dog foods and treats. I usually split these treats into 2 pieces, which is easily done just by squishing the 2 ends together. This makes my puppy feel like he's getting more treats.

review/summary: gave my dog the runs
review/text: the ingredients and reviews for these treats seem great, but they gave my dog the runs.  (peanut butter)  Every dog is different, I guess.  These treats are also not grain free, if that's important to you.

review/summary: Excellent training treats - Perfect for my goldendoodle pup
review/text: Zuke's Chicken Flavored Mini treats are perfect for training dogs, especially a puppy in my case.  I picked these treats for my new 8 week old goldendoodle puppy.  She immediately loved them.  Since puppies have such short attention spans and require so much training, I need to use them frequently!  They are very reasonably priced compared to most products found in pet stores and have all natural healthy ingredients.  The small size of these treats allows you to get great use out of them, while giving them to your dog frequently for good behavior.  You won't need to constantly replenish your supply either.
