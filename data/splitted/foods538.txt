review/summary: Better than the standard "Yellow" Guayaki
review/text: Guayaki organic yerba mate' was the first organic mate' I ever purchased. The flagship label in the Guayaki line is their traditional "yellow" organic label, which is ok but has about 25% stems, seeds, and whole leaves. I like this San Mateo Guayaki organic "green" label better. It is, at least to my taste, a fuller flavor than the standard Guayaki. As of 5/28/11, it is substantially cheaper than the standard Guayaki label. The San Mateo label also seems to show less yerba stems and seeds. The reason I deducted one star is the presence of (even still) too many stems and seeds as well as the uncompetitive price. Guayaki badly needs to filter their Yerba leaves in their existing products or offer a different label with pure, refined leaf. Other yerba mate' vendors offer this and it is a gaping hole in Guayaki's product line. Even though this product is more affordable than the rest of the Guayaki yerba mate' line, it is still very expensive compared to other organic and traditional yerba mate' labels from other companies. An adjustment to competitive pricing as well as attention to filtering the yerba leaves would give this product 5 stars.

review/summary: Unsmoked Goodness
review/text: The "San Mateo" blend of Guayaki's loose leaf yerba mate is lighter -- less harsh -- than their more readily available "Traditional" blend.  I can drink either blend but much prefer San Mateo because it clearly dried without smoke (they do not say whether the traditional blend is or not) and has a more "refreshing" flavor to my palate.  Long time drinkers of more traditional blends available in South America (Argentina, Uraguay, etc.) may not like it and may even find it bland or undrinkable, but from my limited experience with other types of yerba mate and my more "American" (United States) taste combined with the fact that I do not smoke (I have tried, but never liked it) I can barely stomach the more aged "smoked" or "roasted" types of mate.  If you feel the same way there is a good chance you'll like the San Mateo blend.

review/summary: Didn't work for my dogs
review/text: All my dogs reacted badly to this food.  They seemed to like the taste but it gave them diarrhea.  I gave it a while but saw no improvement.  However, they are now on Castor & Pollux's Organix, and I've never had such a great experience with a food.  The ingredients are high quality and their stool is now perfect every time - much easier pick-up for me!  So Castor has good products, just this one didn't work for me.  Every dog is different though, so yours may have a different experience.

review/summary: Great natural dog food!
review/text: My shelties love this food. My 6 year old sheltie has allergies and I have been feeding him natural and/or organic foods for the past year, in an effort to eliminate things in his diet to find out what he is allergic too. I tried a few different natural and organic brands but he did not like them. Since I tried the Natural Ultramix, he eagerly eats it on his own without me having to sit down with him to eat. (Yes, I Know.... he is spoiled rotten) He also is doing better with the allergy problem and his coat is getting better. I would highly recommend this dog food for anyone who cares about what their dogs are eating. No By Products, No Fillers, No Wheat and No Corn. All of these can be harmful to your dog.

I've tried Apricot, Cherry, and Strawberry, and the Apricot seemed to be the most popular amongst my friends (not what I would have expected).

review/text: Now this review is based on taste only, not nutritional value or any of the other qualities or selling points of these cookies.  I bought them because I have a sweet tooth and wanted some cookies and these were on sale plus I had a coupon.  I purchased the crispy cookies, the vanilla sandwich cookies and the chocolate sandwich cookies.  I thought they were all very good and would not hesitate to buy them again. I found these cookies to taste very good, similar to a chipsahoy but a little crispier.  Now they do have splenda in them as the last ingredient, not sure why because I think they would have tasted fine without it, but you can't even taste it.  At least I couldn't.  If they ever go on sale and you have a hankering for a chocolate chip cookie, try a box!  You might like them too.

review/summary: Matador original beef jerky
review/text: I bought a bag of this for 3 dollars and 50 cents at WalMart. I hadn't seen it before. The jerky softness is medium. The taste is like a jerky stick. It's not amazing in flavor or tenderness but it's very edible and still delicious. This doesn't have a real salty flavor some brands do and it doesn't have a very smoky flavor either. It's good to see a little bag of mid-priced jerky. Most jerky here is $4.50-$9 a package.<br /><br />My favorite jerky that's the most tender and has the best taste is made by a company in Sonoma, California called Krave Jerky. That company's Basil Citrus jerky is the best I've ever had!!<br /><br />Matador jerky is 3 stars.

review/text: There is no better pectin around!  I've used Certo, Sure-Jell, even Pomona's (which is the messiest, least user-friendly product ever) and MCP is the only one worth my time!  It makes no sense that it's always so unavailable.  Walmart used to sell it here in Vegas, but even they have stopped carrying it.  I either have to get my mom in California to buy me some or purchase it online--the price and the convenience of purchasing it on Amazon.com is far superior!

review/text: MCP is the best -----HOWEVER---- if you can't buy it anywhere, what good is it.  Almost impossible to find, what gives Kraft?  You would think that a premium product like this would be available for sale everywhere.  Very disappointing.  Kraft tells me that it is still being produced but could not tell me where to find it other than to check the local store that recently ordered it.  If the store has as much luck as everyone else has, they won't find it either.

review/summary: Convenient canning
review/text: Received the box of 8 2-oz boxes of pectin for our canning, and it was really nice not to have to leave the house to find it at a decent price (just pennies above $2 per box, shipped). Would have given 4 stars, but one of of boxes had a tiny tear and was leaking powder. Used it anyway. Also, a couple of weeks later, found the same product for $1.50 at Winco (on sale, probably), but driving that far to Winco isn't convenient, and after paying tax and gas, perhaps the savings isn't that much unless you buy a lot. Amazon's much more convenient.

DO NOT trust the mild rating, this is crazy hot! best with rice which helps to quiet down a funny aftertaste that is no doubt a byproduct of the ready-to-eat technology. Not a big deal anyway.

review/summary: Super Hot Sauce
review/text: The label on  Frank's Hot Sauce says "The Perfect Blend of Flavor and Heat" and I must say this is an accurate description of the product.<br /><br />Frank's Hot Sauce is outstanding.  It's a Cheyenne Pepper based hot sauce that is not too hot, not too sweet, but has just a perfect blend of "flavor and heat."  It's not like Tobasco sauce which is very hot and you sprinkle on items.  It's a different kind of sauce (I love Tobasco).  Frank's is a hot sauce you can use more liberally to your liking because, while it's hot, it's not so hot you can't really dig into it and enjoy the rich flavor and spices.<br /><br />I like to use this sauce to dip chicken tenders in, but you can also use it too cook buffalo wings, put it on eggs, French fries, burgers, whatever you like.<br /><br />This size really is way too small to purchase.  If you like hot sauce you will be done with this size bottle in no time and kick yourself for not buying a larger, more economical size.<br /><br />I highly recommend this hot sauce.

review/text: I love spicy food and I use Franks RedHot sauce on a lot of different items.  It is good in Mexican dishes, soups, bean soup, Buffalo wings, baked beans, and many other foods.  I like to even add it into barbeque sauce to spice it up and grill out using the mix as a basting sauce.  Sometimes I even mix it up into other sauces to make a hotter taste and you can really jazz up your cooking.<br /><br />I added a photo of the nutrition label for your help.  There is a good recipe for Buffalo chicken wings on the bottle.  You should note that one teaspoon of this sauce does contain 8% of your daily allotment of salt.<br /><br />This is a good hot sauce and it is one of many that I enjoy.

review/summary: Natural OR Artificial Flavor, your choice
review/text: So, there is a bit of confusion here about the ingredients in this product. Upon speaking with The Good Earth directly, I have learned that the 18-count Original Sweet & Spicy Tea (both caffeine-free and regular) have artificial flavor, whereas the 25-count boxes do not. It seems like a stupid way to differentiate, since the boxes look exactly the same, with the same exact name. I think they do this so as not to highlight the fact that any of their products have artificial flavoring. I learned from them that they originally had artificial flavor in the blend, then removed it, and received complaints because it tasted different (though probably only slightly). They then added it back to their formula, but only in the 18-count boxes. It is a "spice flavor not found in nature," they claim, so I guess there's no other way to please the people who like that flavor. The first box I got was from an outlet grocery store that was produced during the in-between period when the artificial flavor had been removed from all boxes. It was really good just like that; I still enjoyed the flavor of the new version (technically the old version) that I received from Amazon, but actually not quite as much, and I'd rather have the natural version since it's natural and I like that one anyway.<br /><br /> As a note about the flavor--I really like this tea. It is, as described, sweet and spicy. It has a very cinnamon-y flavor with a lot of dimension added by all the other flavors included. I drink a few cups a day, either caffeinated or the rooibos version, depending on time of day. The flavor between these two are slightly different, but comparable. I love the fact that it is delicious without sugar and/or milk (though also delicious with either or both as well)--this is coming from someone with a serious sweet tooth. So that helps a lot, but apparently it has 3 calories per serving.<br /><br />If you like this, you may also enjoy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63LDS">Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea, Bengal Spice, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>--another spicy herbal tisane that I like without sugar.

review/summary: Sad replacement of original recipe
review/text: With the new packaging came cheap flavor. I WAS a major fan and promoter of Good Earth Tea to my family and friends, drinking it once or twice daily. But, since Good Earth changed their product "wrapper", I can hardly stand the stuff. It has a bland and artificial flavor now, even though the package indicates all natural ingredients. Think twice before buying this! I would go back to drinking Good Earth in a second if they would return to the previous recipe, because I loved it!

I am not sure if it is a texture thing as he also doesn't like hummus (lentils and chickpeas are maybe a similar texture), but he loves the Peach Pumpkin Pie flavor as well as tolerates the Black Beans and Corn. These are the only 3 we have tried.  I would recommend not getting a whole case unless you know your baby likes it.  I have to say that of the three this was my least favorite (I try everything my son eats).  My personal favorite is the peach pumpkin pie though.  It tastes like Thanksgiving but it is very healthy!  I might squeeze a few of them into a pie crust and see if anyone notices it is baby food - I guarantee they wouldn't!

review/summary: My Earths Best Baby spits it right out...
review/text: My daughter has been eating earths best since she was 10 weeks old, in addition to her formula.  I gave this to her and she spit it back out immediately.  I made several attempts at future lunches and dinners and she refused to eat it.  I even tried to mix it with something else, which always works... except with the ones from Sprout that she hates.<br /><br />My guess is that the chemicals from the packaging gets into the food..?  Or it just tastes like garbage.  She wasn't picky, until now.<br /><br />:-)  Good Day.

review/summary: My favorite candy!!
review/text: Of all the brands & types, this brand & packaging is the best buy!!!  Since I was a child, I have loved & eaten the LaFlorentine brand in the cute little packages with the 3 flavors.  It is a wonderful candy worth 5*, but I often wished they had the candy in a bar instead of the more expensive & wasteful packaging.  I tried the LaFlorentine pistachio bar, it was good, but only had half the wafer as the Bellino bar.  I would give it 4*.  The vanilla flavor is my favorite, but it would be nice if they also added the lemon & orange flavors.  The Bellino bar is soft, chewy, & melts in your mouth.  WARNING: Don't get the hard nougat-ONLY the soft!  Once you try this delightful candy, you will be hooked!!!

review/text: I am in constant pursuit of the best nougat and have tried several.  This one I purchased because it was cheaper but you get what you pay for.  It is too sweet and is very soft and airy - reminiscent of eating marshmallows.  The almond flavor was so intense that it tasted artificial.  Very disappointing.  I will not buy this product again.

This brand is not the same as those but it tastes identical and is an exceptional candy.

review/summary: Great food, supposedly made with real chicken
review/text: My smaller female Persian thinks this stuff hung the moon, literally.  So much so that my mother and I spend time scouring the local kroger store trying to find this stuff for her.  It's a bit difficult to find here in forgotten Ohio so when we do find it, most of whatever is left on the shelf winds up in the cart.  There are only a few things the "Queen" likes so when you find one, well, we have to grab it fast.  This stuff actually looks real - just as if you'd made it yourself.  Plus, 9 Lives has changed many of their foods to actually contain real meat instead of all the by-products.  Their tuna and egg version looks like you'd use it for people, minus the red color of course!  Anyway, give this variety a try - it certainly is my female's favorite.  Highly recommend!

Not me. Have one cat show has been on this for year - and have not had hairball #1 out of her. Definitely recommend buying from Amazon - aLOT chaeper than any other place I have found.

review/summary: Good brand, good size bags
review/text: When my husband first got our cat a few years ago, he started feeding her cheaper cat food.  She threw up one day all over the carpet, and it was really hard to get the "red" stains out from the color in the cat food.  He then switched her to Iams, and now on the rare occasion she has those problems, the carpet isn't stained like it was before.  Iams is a little more expensive than other brands, but it's definitely worth it.  Your cat doesn't cost that much money to keep anyway, so you might as well feed them better quality food.<br /><br />I defintely recommend buying this product from Amazon (the pack of 8 2-lb. bags).  You pay more up front, but it averages out to about the same, or maybe even a little less, as buying the 4 pound bags from the local stores.  Plus, your cat gets "fresher" food more often, which is especially good if you only have one cat and don't go through the bag as fast.  Yes, our cat is a little spoiled.

review/summary: Suitable for all types of cats
review/text: I had a cat with renal failure who had 1 kidney removed several years ago. The doctor recommended the KD dry for her post-surgery. She live nearly 9 years on one kidney and this food alone! I now have three rescued cats of diverse backgrounds, including 1 longhair. They all eat the Iams dry food at will, with no portion control. None are overweight and though the longhair gets frequent hairballs, that is not a result of the food, but rather how frequently I brush him. More brushing = less hairballs.

review/text: GREAT DEAL, CONVENIENT TOO.  Much cheaper than WalMart and I don't need to lug it home, it appears on my doorstep.  Cats hack up fewer hair balls and instead of adding petroleum products (ie-vaseline) like most HAIRBALL formulas, which causes diarrhea and blocks vitamin absorption, this one has probiotics, which make the digestive tract work better, thus eliminating most of the hairball problem in a healthy way.  (Nothing can prevent 100% of hairball hacking, it's just something all cats do once in awhile.)  A great deal on a great product, plus free shipping when you order over a certain amount.---Coos Bay Sandra

review/summary: Update: She got her first hairball
review/text: I have been feeding my cat all sorts of cat food.  She has long fur and hasn't had any hairballs.  If she gets hairballs on Iams Proactive hairball formula, I would definitely update this review.<br /><br />This food is different from any cat food I've ever bought because the kibble is shaped like tiny balls.  Up until now, my cat has eaten foods shaped like starfish or "Y" and "X."  She doesn't seem to mind the shape, though.<br /><br />My main beef with cat food is some of them smell so horribly bad (dead fish).  This one is fine.  That's what I buy for -- that and price.  If it does what it says, make my cat lose weight and controls hairballs, I will be a happy cat owner.<br /><br />Will come back in the future to update.<br /><br />____________________________<br /><br />UPDATE:  Well, this formula must not work.  After being on it for two months, my cat suffered her first hairball.

The vet asked what type of food we feed her and my sister informed that we use Iams Weight Control (she has trouble loosing weight) The Vet told us that she has had a few animals come in lately with the SAME problem and EATING the same food!!!! we were told to stop feeding her Iams and use an all natural cat food with only half a cup of food in her bowl each day.. I DO NOT RECOMMEND! or your pet too can start getting cysts on their body.. no good

review/text: If you have a multi-cat family and are struggling to find common ground to minimize digestion disturbances amongst all of them, this is a good bet.  My cats don't *love* this food, but they all tolerate it well and don't run away from it immediately after I pour it.<br /><br />Amazon's prices are unbeatable too, even for the small (2lb bags).  While it seems weird to get so many small bags, my cats appreciate it because the these bags don't reseal well, so with smaller bags, the food is fresher in general.<br /><br />As mentioned in the subject, this only applies to the Chicken flavor, my cats don't care for the others.

Suddenly after years of good health & a beautiful coat we have to find something else she likes besides occasional raw fish or shrimp.  She will not eat IAMS salmon & brown rice, barely will touch the Chicken Proactive Health. I've finally backed down to Purina Tuna & Fish but I know it is not as healthy as IAMS. Why is the IAMS Tuna suddenly not available in HEBs, WalMarts, K-Mart, Feed Stores nor on-line?
