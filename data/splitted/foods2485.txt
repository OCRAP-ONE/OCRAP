review/summary: The Mix Is Great.
review/text: First things first -- I don't remember seeing it sold at this price tag at Target stores. Maybe food price has gone up.<br /><br />Anyway, it is the only Archer Farms Trail Mix I buy. Other mixes either contain non-seed mix, such as chocolate, or less variety of seeds. I am a vegetarian, so plant seeds are an important source of proteins. I'd prefer less cranberries and raisins, however.

review/text: If I could give this a ZERO I certainly would.<br />You will only receive the product in 2 plastic boxes and NO GLASS BOTTLE as the add specifically states. The seller is a cheat and knows full well you will not get the bottle but he still charges for it. Another seller has 2Grm of Spanish Saffron for $6.99 and it is most likely that same as this rip off is selling. Don't waste your money but get it elsewhere.

review/summary: Fantastic breakfast on the go-- healthy and tasty
review/text: Our morning routine isn't perfect-- sometimes our little one wakes up later and we end up rushing around trying to get the day started. These Plum Organics pouches are a lifesaver-- they are a yummy combination of protein, grains, and fruit. A complete little smoothie that tastes great, is 100% organic, and healthy. Fantastic solution if you are traveling, on-the-go, and need a healthy snack that will complete breakfast.<br /><br />Super helpful to have these in toddler-sized portions that little ones can easily hold and squeeze on their own.

review/summary: Tastes Nice if your tot loves BANANAS!
review/text: My toddler son loves these on the go Plum Tots snacks.  However, I have to say that the first ingredient (and main ingredient) is Banana..not blueberry!  It tastes very sweet too.  I feel that the packaging should at least label this as banana/blueberry Quinoa as the packaging is misleading and the product does not taste like blueberry that much, if at all.  I'm a huge fan of most Plum Baby/Tots products and will continue to buy but I'm very careful not to be duped anymore and so I assess all ingredients..especially the first one because that's the largest content of the product.  I love Earth's Best smoothie yogurts as content/taste reflects in the product name.

review/text: All the Plum Organics pouches are great! This one has 2x the protein compared to the other fruit only pouches and seems to be sufficient to stop th e whining and tears until meal time. One watch out is that this particular variety has very little vitamins and calcium compared to other varieties. So not good if you're using this as a fruit substitute.

review/summary: yummmm
review/text: Our 17 month old loves to self feed and the fruit/veggie pouches are wonderful for that. Generally they are mess free, except when he decides to squeeze and it's not in his mouth. :) I was looking for new flavors that our Target and grocery store might not have, and came across the Mish Mash line. He truly loves blueberries so I thought this would be a fun one to try. They came in yesterday and he saw the box and said "mmmm!" so we gave him one and he sucked it down quickly. So while I haven't tried it myself, my 17 month old gives it the 5 star rating. :)

review/text: I give this Mish Mash to my son often as an afternoon snack on the go. I like it because it has some grain in it, which keeps my baby  full longer than just veggie/fruit pouches. I also like the fact that it doesn't have any natural flavorings added to it, because I believe that many natural flavorings are as bad as artificial ones. My baby thinks it tastes great too!

review/summary: My kid loves it
review/text: But a few warnings - the packaging might lead you to believe that this product is primarily blueberry, oats, and quinoa.  However, the first two ingredients (and hence the most prevalent) are actually apple puree and banana puree.  I'm not a fan of companies with misleading labels and product names, and so I deducted two stars for that.  Like I said in the title, though, my kid loves it. I just want to make sure you know what you're actually getting.  From my experience, most of the Plum Organics line starts with apple something or other, despite whatever the name of the product is or what is pictured on the label.

review/text: We had been buying these nonpareils and sprinkles for a while, but sometime in the last year they changed their formula and now the colors are so muted when you put them on food you can't even tell they have color. Poorly done Let's Do Organic! Especially when there are so few choice for naturally colored sprinkles and nonpareils. So, I'd have given them a lower start rating except that they still are the only naturally colored sprinkle I can get at the grocery store and I will continue to buy them.

review/summary: just barely ok
review/text: unfortunately, this oatmeal doesn't really fit the bill for me or or my kids. while the ingredient list looks good, the added sugar is a bit high (but no worse than the norm) and i wondered why they added the extra vitamins. also, the packages are a bit smaller than quaker, and while that isn't a problem in and of itself, each package has as much simple sugars added as the slightly larger quaker (even though the box says: "now less sugar")! but the kids are the final judge on this one, and my kids don't really like it. my 6 yr old wouldn't eat either flavor without adding maple syrup. they are pretty high in sugar to start, but adding more sugar just to get her to eat it completely minimizes the nutritional value. my 14 yr old says she doesn't like the texture AT ALL and has basically refused to eat it. i would definitely recommend buying just one box to try it before spending the money on a case as i did!

I always feel more alive and awake when starting my day with 6 to 8 ounces of this amazing product.  I really can't say in words how well it works for me... it's just something you'll have to try for yourself!  I will continue using this product as long as it is on the market.  God Bless!

review/summary: bacon... Bacon... BACON!!!!!!
review/text: O.k. I was a little nervous ordering the half slab here on Amazon for a few reasons: Not Prime, not direct from Amazon, shipping.  Have to say that my purchase was super smooth and that the bacon is (was) excellent!!!  I posted some pictures so check them out if you want the nutrition information from the label or a look at the package.<br /><br />I ordered on a Tuesday and the bacon arrived Thursday afternoon.  Was sent a tracking number right away, and it shipped UPS 2 Day which was included in the price.  As I live in California it was tax free also.  The package was left on my door step in the sun when I arrived home in the afternoon.  It was very warm to the touch and I was worried and dreading what would be inside.  However, when the box was opened the bacon was cold to the touch - though  not frozen.  Just like you would get it from the store.  The outside of the box was wrapped in a heavy shrink wrap, the box was a thick cardboard and sealed with tape well, and inside the box was an inner styrofoam cooler, with a strofoam lid, that fit the dimension of the box perfectly.  Inside the styrofoam cooler were two ice packs and the bacon.  The bacon is shrink wrapped also.  It arrived in perfect condition.  My half slab weighed in at 5.12 lbs.<br /><br />So I have never "cut" my own bacon from a slab before.  I used a shaprp Henckel butcher knife and cut slices about 1/4" thick.  The slicing is a bit of a chore and a bit of a mess as compared to the pre-sliced.  Still the bacon cut easy with the sharp knife and I just used my shrink wrapper to re-package the bacon into 3 smaller packages to put into the freezer.<br /><br />It cooked delicious!  Crisp and slightly crunchy and moist and a bit meaty inside.  Even before cooking the aroma was delicious.  A slight smokey aroma.  Upon cooking over a low heat the smell just ROCKED!!!  Again flavor was great too.  Better then store bought bacon?  Yes!  Worth 4x the cost?  Well that's up to you.  I think so.  Mail order bacon can only be described as a luxury item anyway.<br /><br />I will order from Burgers' Smokehouse again.  Next purchase will be a ham.  Or more bacon.

I expected some sort of slab bacon similar in texture to a store bought bacon package looking like the photo. Not so, 99.9% pure fat, barely hints of "meat". I was planning on using this bacon as seasoning for pea, lentil and bean soups, but it's completely unusable and ended up in the garbage. Not worth it.

review/summary: So far, so good
review/text: I've been using this product for a week after taking the advice of my cousin and the other 5 star reviewers.<br /><br />I have never tried any supplements or powders in my life since Flintstones vitamins as a kid and a brief stint of One a Day Womens. So my advice comes to you as a complete novice.<br /><br />Honestly, I shudder to think what the normal flavor tastes like if this is berry. I do not get that flavor at all! My cousin says she loves mixing a scoop in her yogurt so that is the first way I tried it. It was very gritty and tasted almost like grass clippings. Bleck.<br /><br />Since then I have been making a smoothie with 1 scoop, yogurt, frozen berries, half of a banana, a small squirt of honey, and fruit juice. It tastes very good and is a great start to the day. Only once in awhile do I get a hint of graininess, but it's now tolerable in this form.<br /><br />In the week since I've started this I've noticed a boost in energy. I used to become so worn out I needed to nap every afternoon, which was I was NOT happy about, hence me seeking out energy boosters and my cousin recommending this. I have not napped once since starting Amazing Grass and only layed down one afternoon for a short rest. The other days I was able to remain awake, active, and energized. This surprised me b/c I didn't expect it to be noticeable or work that fast.<br /><br />I have yet to see any skin improvements I read about elsewhere. In fact, I've noticed a slight increase. Perhaps detoxing? Not sure.<br /><br />As another rater mentioned - being regular takes on a whole new meaning w/ this Amazing Grass! I've been using it once a day and my BM have increased, which perhaps is detoxing again and definitely could attest to more energy. Be warned - the first few days you will have some gas so maybe start over a weekend.<br /><br />I hope this will continue to work for me. My only cons so far are the flavor (which I wish were tastier so I didn't have to disguise it so much) and the price. I'm not sure why the berry flavor is $8 more than the other tub? At nearly $40 every two months it's a pretty pricey supplement, but hopefully will be worth it if the positives keep adding up.<br /><br />UPDATE: Have now been on it for a few months and LOVE IT! We left our tub out of state so I went without it for a week and felt horrible. When I reordered a new tub and started up again I felt better again within 2 days. My skin has now evened out, also the regularity has too. Another unexpected and added benefit is my chronic headaches have DISAPPEARED! I used to get 2 or 3 a week and have only had about 3 in 3 months time when the weather is horrible. Have since been able to tolerate it mixed in with fruit juice, even though it is still grainy. If taking regularly I suggest subscribing delivery - now we get ea. 60 day tub for about $32, much cheaper than anywhere else I can find!

review/summary: Amazing Grass Amazing Product!
review/text: I have been using the Berry flavor in smoothies regularly for about 10 months, and Amazon is the best place to get it. The first couple of times I tried it, it was okay. By the third time, I was really looking forward to it in a yummy way and missing it if I didn't have it. I started on it after a friend was treated for breast cancer, and her cancer doctor told her to get and stay on a green superfood. My husband had lung cancer and needed all the help he could get. I researched green superfoods on the Internet, and preferred the contents of this one because it had both fruits and veggies (most have only veggies) with great extras and minimal filler. I bought all the flavors to test, but he didn't like the smell (friends say it smells like wheat grass) and refused to try any of them. My daughter and I tested each and preferred the berry flavor in daily smoothies. The chocolate flavor tastes good, but has less fruit/veggie value. In blender: approx. 1/2 cup of orange juice, 1 banana, squirt of honey, 5 +/- frozen strawberries and Amazing Grass green superfood. Add ice cubes if you like it thicker. It's great! On the cancer subject, I studied cancer survivors and what they attributed to their survival. Result: Consume lots of Flax Seed or Whey, lots of fruits/veggies, remove stress, and remove white sugar and processed foods from the diet. Cancer loves white sugar and fake sugars (Splenda, etc.). The American diet is killing us. Amazing Grass Green Superfood contains flax seed along with lots of natural antioxidant and immunity building fruits and veggies to ward off illness. I used to average two colds per winter. Since taking this (10 months), I can't remember the last time I was sick. My body feels good taking it, and yes, it does keep you regular in a good, natural way as it flushes the toxins out of your system. Just what the doctor ordered. Unfortunately, my husband refused to do any of the things learned from my studies and he succombed to cancer. I'm staying on the Amazing Grass Green Superfood because I don't want that to happen to me. And because it keeps my body feeling good.

review/text: Been using this for 3 weeks now. I was using another brand for about a month prior to using this. I liked the other brand but i wanted to see what else was out there and get the best. Well I'm done searching. This combines fruits and vegetables! I've been using this to supplement my breakfast and lunch throughout the day and i feel great!  I have more energy than before. I'm not getting tired halfway through the day anymore and i feel i have more mental focus.  I feel healthier than i ever have. I thought being "regular" was going once daily. Well since i've been taking this I go an hour after i eat usually. Overall hands down best product bar none. Get it from amazon too - in my local stores they are usually a good bit pricier.

I ordered some PH strips but have not received them so I don't know how my PH is, but I am sure it is great.  I actually have lost 6 pounds, because it actually fills me up a little.  We use the Magic Bullet, and Strawberry Banana Juice to drink it, cause it is a bit gritty, and not very tasty.  I explain it this way though.  It is worth the 10 seconds of distaste to drink the drink, to change your life.  I highly recommend it.

The berry flavor actually just comes from the dried, powdered berries that are in it, so don't expect to get punched in the face with Kool-Aid flavoring.<br /><br />Honestly, who cares about the taste of something should take you less than 15 seconds to drink?  If you'd rather choke down ten servings of vegetables each day, be my guest.  The negative reviews here remind me of the ones you see on the pages for quality liquid fish oil.  People give it negative reviews because of the taste when I get no fishy taste at all and IT TAKES LESS THAN A SECOND TO SWALLOW.  Come on!<br /><br />This stuff tastes just fine, seems to be rather good quality, has a GREAT price tag and I get a nice energy boost from it.  I also have yet to get sick this winter, so I think I'll be ordering this product for quite awhile.

review/summary: Great pick me up!
review/text: I am 6.5 months pregnant and often feel tired and fatigued.  When I drink this product (and I just use water) I am shocked how instantly great I feel.  I brought it into my OBY/Gyn and she okay'd it.  It is a great pick me up and actually puts me in a better mood.  When you are pregnant and not drinking, not smoking, no caffeine your system is pretty clean so you can actually feel the results faster.  I did use this product when I was not pregnant got great results as well, as this product does alkaline your system and helps your skin stay clear of pimples.  Yeah the taste is acquired but imagine if you had to eat vegetables all day long to get the same results...hope this helps!

review/text: I add a scoop of this or the chocolate flavored Amazing Grass to my morning shakes. I use almond milk, add a serving of ground flaxseed, this green powder, a protein powder, and a few ice cubes. This makes for a very healthy and satisfying start of a day. I have tried other green powders before buying this one, and the taste of this one is the best. I have also noticed that I get sick a lot less often since I started adding the green superfood to my daily routine.

review/summary: Amazing Grass IS AMAZING!!
review/text: I LOVE this product! I find the taste very pleasant and am quite surprised to see so many negative comments on the taste. I suppose you must be used to eating natural foods to feel the way I do. Yes, it does have a "grass" smell and taste BECAUSE it contains grass and algae. Algae has a very strong taste and smell and I do not notice it in the berry flavor. I mix the powder in about 6 oz. of organic white grape juice using a shaker and it tastes fantastic. It does have a grittiness to it as, again, it contains grass and algae and it does not dissolve, so be warned if you think you are buying a dissolvable product. I begin my day with Amazing Grass before eating anything. The ingredient list is impressive and contains a wealth of superfoods that are so important for optimal health and vitality.<br /><br />As for the effects on the body, you will notice BM regularity due in part to the wealth of probiotics, you may feel more energized, notice clearing of your skin, and a detoxing effect. I am a bodybuilder and a nutritionist. I cannot express enough how much I recommend this product. I feel great and would not want to be without Amazing Grass!

I actually don't mind the flavor and can have it just mixed with water, but it definitely tastes better in a fruit smoothie. I have noticed, however, that it makes me really thirsty after I take it so I drink plenty of water.

review/summary: Good alternative to growing drink grasses
review/text: I cannot give this a 5 star rating simply because the taste is slightly unpleasant. However, I definitely like this product and will continue using it. I add Grass Berry Powder, raw Cacao Powder, Chia Running Food, Hemp Oil, local raw honey and two fruits to my green smoothie every morning. I have to have the Cacao to mask the taste. I really don't mind though since I love chocolate!<br /><br />I am adding a second smoothie in the afternoon this month simply because I accidentally started losing weight and I think it is because I am better nourished so I do not eat as much. Therefore I doubled the amount of berry powder I am buying. I wish they could get a handle on the slightly bitter taste of this, however, the nutrient profile is impressive and that just may not be possible.

review/summary: A convenient way to get more raw food in your belly
review/text: I give this 4 stars only because it has fewer vegetables, sea greens and other stuff that my other powder has (Green Vibrance), although this has a better taste and does have a few things that my other drink does not. In both cases, it is mostly "grass" you're drinking so I'm not sure how delicious one should really expect it to taste when mixed with only water (but it's really not that bad). You can indeed taste the berry although you won't be fooled into thinking there isn't any grass in it...unless you mix it with something like organic apple juice (what I usually do). I've also used this as a "tea" and added a little lemon too. I keep this one in the office and my other powder at home. I sometimes add a little mulberry powder for more flavor. I really like the convenience of powdered fruits and vegetables. It allows me to stay more consistent with keeping raw foods in my body. And I don't have to worry about food going bad before I get around to eating or juicing it.

review/text: I don't know the true medical benefits of this product but I can sure tell you that after using the smaller size container I could for sure notice my body reacting to not having the Amazing Grass product.  I was much more worn down at the end of the day vs. having it regularly.  So I'm now convinced and drink this stuff every day, sometimes up to 3x's a day.  I love it and won't stop using the stuff, I love mixing it with Gatorade.  My body is much stronger and more regular now after using this product daily.  Thanks Amazing Grass... (Not a paid comment) I'd recommend you just try it once and drink it everyday for a few weeks.... You'll notice a big change for the better.

review/text: Tastes good to me.  Well I'm trying to keep a healthier diet lately.  Been doing a green smoothie (kale, fruit, rice milk) and wanted to add some green/powder to the mix.  Was excited when this arrived to try out the next day in a smoothie.  Read many of the negative reviews about taste on most green/powders so was a little worried...but I figured in a smoothie you probably couldn't taste this.  Well my 1st day I didn't have time to do a full smoothie...so I just took some Vanilla Rice Milk and a scoop of this.  Mixed it in as much as possible and looked rather green (duh).  Overall I enjoyed the taste (didn't really have a problem with it).  So I'm a fan.

I have lost 20lbs in a couple of months starting my day with this mixed in a 33oz bottle of water. i freeze about 4in of water in the bottom of the bottle the night before. In the morning i put in a scoope of greens and fill up the rest of the water bottle and shake. I make a point of not eating or drinking anything else until this bottle is done. I have more energy and am not craving those high fat sugary breakfast type things. You have to stick with it at least 3 days to get used to the taste/texture but now I actually get up in the morning craving this. Amazon has the best price as well. Try it youll love it!

review/text: I have tried the Berry flavor and the regular flavor. The berry tastes much better to me. I don't dislike the 'normal' flavor but I actually like the berry flavor. So this is the one I will be sticking with because I drink it more often.<br /><br />There are a lot of great sounding ingriendients. I don't have the best overall diet and sometimes lack in what I should be getting for fruit and vegetables. This is a really easy, nice tasting way, to make sure I am getting a lot of the good things I need on a daily basis. I do feel better after having one. More centered, more energy, it even improves mood a little for me. And no jittery feeling whatsoever. Amother nice benefit is a full feeling much greater than the calorie count.<br /><br />This is a highly recommended product and among the best products I have gotten at Amazon. My wife also called with a question and they provided very good customer service.

However, I trust that I am getting the vitamins and minerals that the label says I am.<br /><br />This stuff cost half as much as the other superfood I was eyeballing (Boku).  Probably because the Boku has twice as much vitamins and minerals.  One of these days I am going to try Boku to see if I like it better than Amazing Grass.  If not, I will continue to buy Amazing Grass.<br /><br />The local Whole Foods sells Amazing Grass but it cost twice as much.  I'd love to support a store in my town by spending more money there, but because it is half the price on Amazon I can't justify buying it at the brick n' mortar store.

I would not recommend this on an empty stomach though, I tried it once and it didn't stay down even five minutes. I seem to do best taking this with protein rather than a light salad.<br /><br />I make two of those drinks a day and have never felt healthier in my life.

review/text: I have been using super foods for 20 years, and although there are several good ones on the market, Amazing<br />Grass Berry Flavor Drink Powder is the one I like best.  I take only half the recommended serving because I am small (115 lbs)and that seems to work for me. I have read where some people have had diarrhea when taking this, so I think you may have to try the amount that works best for you.  I put the serving in a small shaker container and add 6 ounces of orange juice, shake it up, and it tastes great! Shaking it in orange juice makes the difference; otherwise it tastes grainy.  It gives me energy, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002G7US5W">Amazing Grass Berry Flavor Drink Powder, Green SuperFood, 8.5-Ounce Container</a>detoxifies and boosts my immune system.

Typical of this type of product, it tastes very "green". When mixed with apple juice it was ok.  However, Emerald Balance tastes much better.

review/summary: Amazing Grass Berry Flavor vs. Lemon Lime Flavor
review/text: I purchased three single serving packets (7g) in the following flavors: berry (burgundy packaging), lemon lime (energy version, green packaging), and regular (orange packaging) from a major grocery retailer. I bought the single serving packets because I'm new to this product, and I wanted to try all three flavors to find out which I'd like enough to invest in the two-month supply. As of this writing, I've tried berry and lemon lime. And I have to say, lemon lime is way more palatable than berry; however, it's just as grainy (I'm consuming it with water only). The downside is the lemon lime flavor contains caffeine (approx. 85mg according to the packet) because of its inclusion of matcha and yerba mat&eacute;. So those with sensitivity to caffeine may want to steer clear. I've given the berry flavor three stars merely for taste. As this is my first day trying the GREENSuperFood products, I can't yet attest to the effect on my overall health, but will update this review when I can attest to it.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TJERRG">Amazing Grass Energy Green Superfood Lemon Lime Flavor, 7.4-Ounce Tub</a>

review/summary: Tastes like a well-mowed lawn with a touch of fruit
review/text: Amazing Grass Berry Flavor is well-named. It really does taste like grass clippings, with a touch of sweet fruit, but not very much. It also does not blend very  well, with some of the "green" floating on top or remaining at the bottom of your drinking container of choice after you finish. Personally, if I want something this green, I would rather drink Green Magma barley powder or similar product. The Amazing Grass product is drinkable, but it's definitely an acquired taste.

review/summary: Not Bad
review/text: I purchased this product because I already eat well, but I wanted to give myself a boost and hopefully increase my energy and immunity levels by getting in more vegetable servings.<br /><br />The taste is fine with juice or milk.  I usually make it with frozen mixed berries and half low fat milk and half h2o.  I have never tried it with just water and I probably never would since when I opened the container it had a very strong bad fish smell, but otherwise it tasted and smelled fine in the drink prepared as I described.  No grittiness that I noticed, blended very smooth with the other ingredients.  Make sure to refrigerate your container, as I almost missed that fact on the label.<br /><br />I did not see any signifigant difference to my energy levels, but I did notice an improvement so far in any winter illness - I am definitely not catching as many colds as I did last year, even when my 3 1/2 year old son has been sick.  I've been trying to get him to drink a shake in the hopes that it would improve his resistance to winter colds, but he wants no part of it (he's a very picky eater).  I of course am not relying on this to prevent me from getting sick, but I only wanted to try it and see if it was worth adding it to my arsenal of tools against winter illnesses.  I think it is, although I do think that this is not to take the place of taking care of yourself by eating whole, unprocessed foods, eating your regular fruits and vegetables, sleep and exercise.  I do think in additon to these practices, the Amazing Grass is a good product that could help your body get a little boost when compromised in the germy illness months.

review/summary: Berry bad, wheatgrass good
review/text: I love wheatgrass (my favorite breakfast is banana smoothie with applesauce and wheatgrass) but really dislike this flavor.  The "berry" bits don't taste like real berries at all; instead, it tastes like someone is desperately trying to cover up the taste of wheatgrass with imitation berry flavor (I know its all natural, etc., that's just my opinion on the overall taste).  Also, I like the flavor of wheatgrass.<br /><br />Last note : as a scientist, I like to see the hard facts about supplements.  Cancer.org has a decent review of wheatgrass ([...]).  It's not a miracle powder, but it has been proven in clinical studies to help with bowel issues.  And it tastes good, if you don't buy the berry one.

review/summary: Two Paws Up!
review/text: My two cats are, I admit, rather spoiled as far as food goes. I usually feed them Indigo Moon, Weruva and Tiki Cat, and as a consequence they eat a better quality diet than most people do. It's worth it though, everyone who meets them comments on how glossy their fur is. I decided we would give BFF a try as the ingredients list meets my standards and the price seemed right, and I must confess I really liked the label (yes I am that shallow) but I was a little apprehensive about how my two four footed food critics would react. It's probably because I indulge them so much but they are very picky eaters and will turn their backs on any wet food that doesn't please them.<br /><br />But I needn't have worried, they loved it! The Tuna Too Cool is a rich-looking, reddish pate with lots of jelly on top and my twosome were wolfing their portions down and got into a bit of a scuffle over the last couple of mouthfuls. They have no higher praise.

review/summary: They like it!
review/text: I learned recently that cats are not supposed to have GRAINS in their food. It causes them health problems, including weight problems. The first few days of trying this I couldn't decide if they were liking it or not. They had always eaten dry food. After a few days on this canned they really started to show that they were liking it. It is a little chunky, but the chunks are easily smoothed out - it's also better to add some warm water with this to make it a little soupy. If it has been refrigerated, let it get to room temperature. All 3 cats like this as well as the Tuna Too Cool and the one that has Shrimp and Chicken combined - but they didn't like salmon.

review/summary: Please understand what it means to go grain free.....
review/text: This product is a good product and really good health wise for your cats. If you are looking at this product you are probably interested in feeding your cats something better. I just wanted to address some of the negative reviews of this food - many of them by people who don't understand that all cat food is not the same. I took the time to switch my 8 year old street rescue Louie to grain-free food (tried many brands before I arrived at BFF), and here are some of my observations.<br /><br />Cost<br />All grain free foods costs more for the same reason that grass-fed antibiotic free, free range chicken costs more per lb than a chicken nugget. It's better for your cat! Anyone who has a cat that's on a farm - ever see it eating some of the corn or wheat that spills off of the truck? Never! That is because cats don't eat grains. In cheap cat foods these grains are used as fillers to round out the portions and are not of any nutritional value to the cat. When I went grain free my cat ate much, much less - thereby negating the price difference. I even tested it a couple of times - my 13 lb cat can eat 2 - 3 ounce cans of Fancy Feast in one sitting - but cannot eat a 3.3 ounce can of BFF in one sitting.<br /><br />Another point on cost. If you are the type to take your cat to the vet and take care of it when it is sick, then you save so much money and trouble with foods like this it is crazy. When you hear people talk about diabetic cats, food allergies and all the other assorted sicknesses our animals are getting - most of them come from food. Diabetic cats - did they continuously raid the cookie jar? All the money you think you will save (but are not actually saving) will go to the health care of your pet in later years. Its the same way McDonalds and Denny's don't have to absorb the cost of all the diabetics they helped create - the taxpayers pay for it through Medicare and higher insurance costs 30 or so years down the line (and sooner with all the young diabetics we are creating).<br /><br />Smell<br />Most grain free cat foods smell. EVO stank up the house horribly and I had to move the cat bowl from the kitchen. Minus all the fillers and grains - you are getting an all natural product that is better for your cat because nutrition of the cat is put first.<br /><br />Taste<br />Cat's are notoriously finicky. Most cat foods that have grains and other filler ingredients have to add heavy syrupy mixes to get the cats to eat them. They take corn, wheat, soy, barley and gods know what else, add some vitamins and then add a extremely strong tasty syrupy mix to get the cat to swallow it all. So cats fed this for a period of time get used to it the same way babies get used to sugars in their formula. Then, when you want to give the baby vegetables with no sugar added guess what? Baby rejects them - they want the sugar! Same happens with cats fed with cheap filler foods.<br /><br />Poop<br />When switching to grain free a cats habits and consistency may change. Their digestive system is learning how to digest what it was actually made for. Same thing happens to humans - look up the "Whole 30" and see what I mean.<br /><br />Switching to Grain Free<br />Its a process more involved than opening the can and plopping it down. Took me months. Google can help you do it but don't expect to just give this to your cat and have her dive right in thanking you for it. That may happen, but more likely than not you have to mix old and new foods until they are used to it.<br /><br />BFF, EVO, Taste of the Wild.... they are all good brands that will improve the health of your cat. I settled on BFF as my wet food because he loves it. I used to give him EVO wet food and he would eat it but he hated it. I still feed him EVO dry food because he likes it. I tried many brands and did not give up on grain-free food because I cared about my cat. I understood as a street cat for years he was used to eating whatever he could and it all was the cheapest, unhealthiest stuff available given to him by well meaning people. He has improved in every way (coat, activity level, temperament, litter habits, etc..) and now is a healthy and happy cat.

review/summary: Great grain free, high fiber, high moisture food!
review/text: My slightly aging cat has had horrible colitis in the last two years, and was defecating on the floor and my bed. The best solution I found was to switch to a grain free food, and offer more wet food than dry, so he will have more moisture in his bowels. I switched to Natural Care LDT, and it solved his problem...for about six months. After finding another steaming pile in my bed recently, and a few under my desk, I decided to try BFF, as my local pet store  just started carrying it. He is a picky feline, but he sucked the Tuna and pumpkin flavor down like a Hoover. One week later, happy cat, no more poop in my bed, which means happy girl. Great ingredients, and picky cat loves it!<br />Note: yes he saw the vet. The change in diet was the vets idea.

review/text: I just tried my two four footed food critics on BFF's Tuna & Veggies Valentine and it made a big hit with both of them. It's always a risk trying a new food on my two finicky cats, but I hoped they would like this one because they love parent company Weruva's Tuna & Vegetables <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70O2">Weruva Mediterranean Harvest Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 24)</a>. BFF's tuna & veggies is a bit different from Weruva's - it has red tuna instead of white and a slightly thicker consistency, though both are stew like and have visible chunks of veggies. And both have an ingredient list that meets my standards - no by products. My twosome snarfed up every last bit of tuna and veggies valentine that I gave them and they asked me for more - but they will have to wait until tonight for that!

review/text: I've recently switched my cats to all grain free food. (if you still feed your cats (or dogs!) with grain filled food, especially if you have had a problem with bladder or kidney stones, I implore you to look at the reviews and research of grain free food.) That being said, my ragdoll usually only eats dry food and my shorthair usually eats the wet food. Amazon delivered this to my doorstep today and I opened a can and fed it right away to see if they liked it. After taking a shower I came back out and it was ALL gone, and my ragdoll was finishing up what little was left. The cat food box says on the front that it was made in a human food facility, but I don't know much about cat food that isn't made in a human food facility. I still appreciate the fact that they are trying to say it is higher quality. I will probably be buying this brand from now on, I just wish Amazon Prime members got it in two days like usual, but it is shipped from pet food direct so :(.

review/summary: Energetic Cat!
review/text: I recently adopted a kitten just under a year old. At first we thought there was something wrong with her, she wouldn't do normal crazy kitten things. After reading about cat nutrition, I discovered what I had fed to my cats as a kid was completely backwards, as is most 'cat food' even today. I read about BFF and decided to let her try some. Now my cat doesn't rest all day, but is playful and as crazy as a kitten should be. Also of note, there is much more urine in her litter box each day, which is a good sign of how much water is in the food. She's also volunteering her presence more now, not just when she is hungry. I had to take a star off, not because of the product, but since Amazon doesn't let me order more than 2 packs per flavor. I'd give it 6 stars if I could 'subscribe' as you can with other types of food on Amazon.<br /><br />Also, I would recommend the 3oz cans if you have only one cat. You will have to feed him/her more throughout the day, but it can dry out if they don't finish it, which defeats some of the purpose besides being unappetizing to the cat.

review/summary: Carrageenan ingredient NOT good !
review/text: If your cat has GI or stomach problems, be SURE to read the ingredients on the label as several of the BFF flavors contain Carrageenan which is not at all healthy for your cat (or people for that matter).  It causes GI problems and heartburn -- the very last thing a kitty needs.  It does NOT appear that Carrageenan is listed in the Amazon description, but if one checks the BFF website, you can find complete product ingredients.<br /><br />In particular, this BFF has the Carrageenan listed towards the top of the ingredient list, so more highly concentrated.<br /><br />My cat needs grain-free food for her IBD and I purchased a few cans of this BFF locally.  The "Carrageenan" on the label got me to sleuthing and discovered some food makers (pet and human) use this as a filler.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Just a heads up for folks ..!

She has not eaten a full helping of cat food in YEARS, but the very first can of this stuff I set out for her was GONE almost instantly. She is usually constantly screaming for treats, but after having a full 3 ounce can of this, she is happy and scream free. I have never seen her take to a wet food so instantly and so completely. Yes, it smells like tuna...because it's made from tuna? It's pungent but she frickin' LOVES it. How nice to see my poor old girl eat every last bit of something. I am just so grateful I found this food! Will be ordering it on a regular basis. Thanks, BFF!

review/summary: What a great treat!
review/text: I don't feed fish to Hanx too often, but this has become a go to occasional treat for him! He loves this stuff and devours it in a flash! I trust Weruva as a brand and so far like b.f.f. a lot, so does Hanx.

review/summary: This stuff is kitty crack
review/text: The BFF line is great; my cats adore it (to the point of occasionally going on food strike when I try to get them to eat other things), its fairly reasonably priced and aside from the mercury issues, it's a really healthy catfood lacking all the crud that's usually in commercially prepared foods (bad additives, grains, corn etc).<br /><br />This particular flavor (tuna and shrimp) is their favorite, but I also feed the tuna and pumpkin flavor which is a close second.  The only reason that I don't feed this 100% of the time, is because just like with humans, you have to be a little concerned about the amount of mercury in fish.  Nothing to do specifically with this brand - they do everything right.  It's just not the healthiest thing in the world to feed nothing but tuna - the mercury levels can build up and that isn't good.  So I alternate this with a chicken product.<br /><br />Otherwise - this is top notch catfood.

review/text: My cats love this food.  They pick at other brands or won't eat it at all so I decided to try this brand. I can't find it locally and when I was ordering the Weruva decided to try a case.  I mix half a can in with the dry Blue Select and they inhale it and want more.

review/summary: Good price
review/text: My cat is used to eating Weruva and Tiki Cat, so I wasn't sure how he would take to this brand. This doesn't look at all like the previous two brands (which actually look like people food) whereas BFF brand looks like typical cat food. Lou isn't normally picky, but he doesn't eat this food quite as quickly as Tiki or Weruva. I bought two cases of 10 (Tuna & Bonito and Tuna & Shrimp) and while it's a good price, I think next time we'll stick to Weruva for big cans of food and Tiki for small cans (he gets one big can in the am and one small can in the pm!) I'd buy this stuff again in the future if I was in a pinch, as it's not a bad food...I just like my cats food to look more like real fish or chicken vs over processed "stuff". But good ingredients and grain free at a good price!

review/summary: My cat loves this, and even I think it smells good!
review/text: I've bought several flavors of the b.f.f. line for my cat, and she chows down on every one of them! Even my roommate's cat, who is extremely picky with wet food (to the point that there is literally only one brand he would eat at all) has been caught sneaking tastes out of her bowl now! This stuff is very high grade - if you check out the b.f.f. site, they make all of their items in a human food processing facility, and there is no grain filler in the food. When opening the cans, it really smells like something you'd open up to eat yourself! I love this product and I will continue to buy it for my baby.

review/text: and I am happy to know that it is a product manufactured with cat health in mind - it's all good.  Purchased through Amazon I save big bucks and buy three different 8 packs at once.  I use BFF to supplement her dry food in the a.m. and p.m.  My kitty (a former under-weight pound cat) always licks her plate clean! I will never buy grocery store cat food again.

review/summary: Pleased picky eater with this food
review/text: I have 2 picky eaters at home and have bought many of the other very expensive popular brands of cat food without luck. I was thrilled to find these, and thrilled to know that my cats love all the different flavors that they offer. Yes it is on the spendy side, but at least I'm no longer giving away the other expensive brands that they wouldn't eat (because I misplaced the receipt or didn't return them on time). I love bff! And very cool that there is a veggie option to throw into the mix.

review/summary: My cats best friend
review/text: I was looking for a cat food without grains, and read the reviews on this line of cat food. So I took a chance and ordered it hoping my cats would like it. YES they do. I have 2 male cats one 12 yrs and one 7 yrs. The 7 year old has IBS and vomits most cat food up. He has not vomited this up once. (YEAH!) My older cat eats this and leaves most of the Fancy Feast I put in their bowls. I am so glad I found this as I believe that the grains and fruits they put in cat food is not good for them.

review/summary: A winning combination
review/text: Two of my cats are very picky eaters most of the time and will only eat kibble or straight up canned tuna. They even turn their noses up at canned salmon and sardines. Even though this food is all fish, I was afraid they might snub it, too, and they normally don't like canned cat foods at all. But they love this. The food has a lot of tuna, but you can tell it has the chunks of tilapia in it. My cats didn't hesitate to eat all of it. I intend to try the other flavors to get some variety in their diet.<br /><br />And I liked that this canned food is very densely packed, not soupy. I just add a little water if the cats need it wetter.

review/summary: Extremely high quality cat food at affordable price
review/text: I love BFF by Weruva because it's incredibly healthy, with only quality meats and supplements and no grains or by-products, but is so much cheaper than any other "premium" brand of comparable quality out there.  I don't even know how they manage to keep the price so reasonable.  The difference in quality is obvious when you open the can, as the food hasn't been ground into unrecognizable oblivion but still has identifiably shredded meat and looks a healthy flesh color, not some unsatisfying 'blah' brown.  I'm a student, so I'm on a very tight budget, but it's worth it to me to purchase BFF for my cats because I believe in preventative care.  Feed my cats well from the beginning and they'll live long, healthy, happy lives with less health problems that will leave me with expensive vet bills.  As for now, my cats and kitten gobble it up in a second flat.  It's obvious they love every flavor I've tried with them (and one is even quite picky).  Their fur is like silk, too.  This is clearly a great food.

review/summary: BFF Tuna and Bonito Be Mine, 5.5 oz. 8-pack
review/text: I recently upgraded to higher quality canned food, first trying the standard Weruva offerings and now the BFF (a Weruva sub-brand?) I like that BFF offers flavors with gravies and others with aspic, as it increases feeding time variety. BFF is certainly a good value compared to the other high-end natural and grain-free products, and even my pickiest senior guy enjoyed the tuna and bonito variety. I will continue purchasing the standard Weruva in Paw Lickin' Chicken since my boys love it, but we are happy to mix it up with BFF. The inclusion of the skin on some fish pieces is certainly a confidence-booster that my cats are getting real food, not mystery meat. I also appreciate the 5.5 ounce can size, as we can share a can each feeding and both cats get their fill.

review/text: After one of my cats experienced some tummy problems, I decided to look for some grain free options.  My cats love this stuff.  I've tried several flavors, and they like them all.  They are excited again at meal time.  The best benefit is that the "tummy problems" are so much better.
