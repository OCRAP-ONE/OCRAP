review/text: Chocolate tastes great! But that goes without saying--I mean, its Ghiradelli!<br />Bought it as a gift for a chocolate lover, so the gift was well appreciated!<br />Unfortunately though, the chocolate was broken upon receipt :( :(  that was the most disappointing. Otherwise all good!

review/summary: STAY AWAY!
review/text: I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas. It arrived in a Ghiradelli box ONLY - no outside packing. Great thing SHE didn't answer the door when it arrived! however, in the end it made NO difference. The box looked like it had been opened and retaped shut - it was actually ripped in several places and the tape was NOT neat. Add to that the fact that the bar was broken b/c the packing was completely insufficient for a fragile item like this PLUS the fact that it was inside the box in a plastic bag that was ripped open! SOMEBODY enjoyed the chocolate, but it certainly wasn't my daughter. I do NOT blame Amazon for this - they actually credited me the full amount AND gave me an additional credit since I will never be able to find this again at the sale price I bought it at. But SHAME on Ghiradelli - I can see they did an amazingly bad job on most of the orders. I will NEVER order from them again now, seeing how this was handled. Really - who ships something like that without extra packing and bubble wrap to ensure it arrives whole????

review/summary: Decent chocolate and mine arrived fine
review/text: My bar was completely intact, delivered by UPS. I think I got a pretty good deal on it as well at less than $5/pound, but I wouldn't pay much more for it. The chocolate itself is good but I wouldn't say it's "exceptional". Overall, 4 stars. A lot of chocolate and the biggest bar I've probably seen.

review/summary: Not Broken
review/text: Not broken at all.  But it didn't take us long to start breaking off chunks and enjoying it.  Perhaps the shippers learned from the first reviews, this had bubble wrap as well as plenty of crumpled up paper protecting it in shipment.<br /><br />We used to get these at a local store back in the 90s for about 20 -25 bucks but they don't carry it anymore.  Not really a surprise that the price has gone up.  It was nice to get it again, but I don't think we would have paid the "full price" if you get it directly from Ghiradelli.<br /><br />We break off chunks between the size of a quarter and a 1/2 dollar and put them on a tray with other holiday treats.  This is an excellent milk chocolate and it really goes fast.

review/summary: Amazingly effective with no irritation
review/text: I have very sensitive skin, and have tried all kinds of deodorants to find one that wouldn't irritate my underarm. This product is the one! From day one when I started using it I was dry all day long, and over a month later I still have no irritation of my skin. If you have sensitive skin, or even if you don't are are just looking for a powerful anti-perspirant, this is the last one you'll ever need to buy. One lasts just about 1.5 months with daily use, so this two pack would last you just about 3 months. Now all I want is Amazon to put this on subscribe and save.

review/text: This stuff seems to protect me as well as the other clinical strength anti-perspirants that I've tried. However, the smell reminds me of an old cosmetic or something that I would find in my grandmother's bathroom. There is no joke intended there, I swear that this is the same scent. My girlfriend agrees, it smells like a grandmother. The smell is not overly strong, so it's not a gigantic problem, just something to consider before buying. I would recommend smelling it at the store before ordering.

review/summary: Protects well, but it "leaks"
review/text: I've been using these for a while now, as I have sensitive skin and regular deodorants irritate me.<br /><br />It works well, I don't sweat as much, but the dispenser it comes in "leaks". How to I describe this... I keep it on my counter top, and every time I lift it to use, there is a round ring of greasy stuff under it, and you can wipe the bottom of the dispenser with a paper towel and see that this is where it is coming from.<br /><br />I can't even find a link on Dove's website to ask if I am doing something wrong.<br /><br />It is in my bathroom, not exposed to sun, or extreme heat or cold. If it didn't leak, I would give it 4 stars, but because of it, only 3 stars. I would give it 5 starts if it wasn't so pricey compared to regular, scented sticks.

review/summary: Anti-perspirent is okay
review/text: I have used better antiperspirants, in fact, I sweat less under my arms when using the non-men version of Dove's clinical protection deodorant or with a normal daytime deodorant. Keep in mind that you put on this deodorant at night, so if you don't sleep with your arms by your side, you get deodorant on your sheets.<br /><br />The good thing about this is that it works as a really good moisturizer and the smell is weak and pleasant.<br /><br />But I wouldn't recommend it, it lets me sweat too much and is messy when sleeping.

review/text: These vanilla raisins are a very tasty, low-fat treat; they are pleasantly sweet and chewy.  Although yogurt raisins make a healthy snack, be aware that there are several servings in this one little bag, and the calories can add up very quickly if you do not pay attention to portion control.  Aside from this, these raisins are an excellent choice as part of a healthy diet, and I've found that the Mariani Brand are just as good as the Sun-Maid but at a lower price.

review/summary: Best Taste
review/text: Pomegranate is the best tasting out of the Five-Hour Energy drinks.  I have been drinking these for quite some time now.  I only consume approx. half of a bottle and save the rest for later.  I enjoy consuming these during work or before an early morning workout when I may need that extra boost.  No GI side effects, no jitters, no headache.  I have not experienced not one adverse side effect.  The bottle states  that it is equivalent to one cup of coffee, but one cup of coffee would not produce the same amount of clear, pure energy that this drink provides.  Also, no sugar, which is a plus!  Highly recommended.

review/text: I love these things. 5 Hour Energy has been my energy supplement of choice for several years now. Although they all taste a little odd, pomegranate is my favorite flavor. If you really don't like the taste, combining with a soft drink or even just a bottle of water will mask things well. Functionally, they are wonderful. I notice less usefulness when taken in the morning, but a great boost for those nights that you know you will need to be awake until 1 or 2...as long as you remember to take one 4 or 5 hours earlier! As usual, Amazon prices beat convenience stores, so I keep a few stashed away (laptop bag, car, work) so they are around when I need them!

review/summary: NOT worth the money..make your own!
review/text: We were given this product as a gift. OK, I can forgive the fact that I'm a pastry chef and I was given a MIX for a gift :-0 but I have always made my own frosting from scratch and have for years. It's one of the EASIEST things to make!!! Make your cake from a mix if you want but....I looked at the back of this box to see what was in it and...SERIOUSLY it's just powdered sugar (.80 cents worth), salt (.05 cents worth) and vanilla (maybe 20 cents worth). I mean, I 'm glad that this small company is making themselves some money but really you should spend your money on other more difficult to make items. (Or all the medical bills that come along with the issues of gluten allergy.)<br /><br />  Honestly folks here is all you do for AWESOME frosting:<br /> 1 box (16 oz) of powdered sugar (put it in a bowl)<br /> 1 pinch salt (put it in the bowl<br /> 1 teaspoon vanilla (in the bowl)<br /> 1 Cup margarine  (at room  temp,in the bowl)<br /> 4 TBL soy milk or other milk (in the bowl)<br />Mix it all up with a mixer till it is light and fluffy (about 5 minutes)<br />  ...if you want chocolate add 4 tbl of cocoa powder and another tbl of milk

review/text: I found this frosting pretty disgusting.  And I'm not one to be very likely to put the words "frosting" and "disgusting" in the same sentence.  It ended up tasting mainly like butter.  When I scraped it off into the sink, it just stayed in one clump and wouldn't even rinse down the sink very easily (like you'd expect from butter).  And even if you like the taste of a bunch of butter on your cake, save yourself some money.  The only ingredients in this mix are powdered sugar, vanilla, and salt.  You can buy all those very cheaply and still add all the butter the directions call for (2.5 sticks!).  Gross!

review/text: I just read all the other reviews before writing my own.  I found it funny people were complaining about the butter being used.  What exactly do you expect in a butter cream forsting?  If healthy eating is your concern, don't eat frosting!  Having said that, I used a box of this to frost the chocolate cake mix Cherrybrook makes.  I made cupcakes.  I used 1 cup softened butter and some lite cream cheese.  I too looked at the box and went, hmmm do I really need to spend money on boxed sugar and vanilla?  Ease of use is the reason for this product!  Mine whipped up just fine.  I split the batch in half and colored each differently for variety in decorating the cupcakes.  I do not like frosting at all.  My family loved it!  There was WAY MORE than enough for 12 cupcakes.  I still have a bowl of it in the fridge for those graham crakers.  I will most likely not be buying a case of this stuff, but for emergencies and when traveling it is handy to have safe ingredients my peanut allergic son can eat.  Plus, no measuring!  :)  Amazon has an amazing price right now compared to my local grocery.

The price is a little bit high and the shipping is extremely high for a 7-ounce package (at the time of this writing the 7-ounce package of noodles cost $3.69 and the shipping was $5.25). I only hope that the shipper does not charge an individual shipping cost for each package. I will be e-mailing the seller this question before I place my next order. The cash involved is the only reason why I did not give these noodles a 5-star rating.<br /><br />UPDATE: I contacted the seller. The shipping price goes up as the quantity increases. It was not stated by how much per package.

I used to order the "crunch" cereal also by Kashi, until I noticed the amount of sugar in each serving.  It was way too high.  But the Heart to Heart cereal does not have way too much sugar, and it does still have fiber and even protein.  I like the fact that I can pour milk directly into the package.  I paid somewhere around $12 for a package of 12, and received free shipping with my Prime membership.

review/text: This tastes about the same as Quaker oats cereal. You get 12 cups for $11.90 which is just about a $1 a cup. It's a decent portion. Each cup is a little smaller than the size of a coffee cup (1.4 ounces). If you're watching your weight, it has 140 calories in each cup. The sodium content is 100 mg which is not bad. It also has some (not all) essential nutrients such as calcium and vitamin A. It can also be used as a snack at any time or as a breakfast cereal.<br /><br />The only problem with this cereal is the dull taste. To me it's bitter. Oats to me does not have a pleasant taste. To fix this I add cinnamon, a few slices of a banana and a packet of stevia (a low calorie sweetener). Sometimes I even add a little honey and mix it in with a small amount of skim milk. If this had been done already I would have given this a higher rating. For the price Kashi should have considered making their cereal more tasty. Since the taste is not at all appealing to me, I will not buy this again.

review/text: Love the product and came so quickly and efficiently. The single size servings are perfect for portion control and for taking in my tote bag for on the go. I love being able to buy anything in small individual packages. I know it's probably wasteful, but for me it's easier since I'm always on the go and it's handy and easier for me. I'm glad Amazon has these available, plus other items and I'll definitely be buying more in the future. Thanks!

review/text: I ordered this as a gift for my husbands birthday.  While i saw the picture of this item i didnt actually expect to receive what i did.  The package itself weighs over 15 pounds and the array of pasta was faboulis.  My husband it a big fan of pasta but honestly we almost never actually buy it so this was nice gift and much bigger than i thought it would actually be. Honestly it was worth the money for him.

Perfect as is over pasta, but you can add your favorite extras or take a tried-and-true recipe to a new level of yum. Very smooth. Not too sweet. Just all around delicious. It is the only marinara sauce we eat. Better than anything I make myself.

review/summary: Good Pilsner Base
review/text: This is my 3rd Coopers malt concentrate used and it produced good results. I did not use dextrose, but instead purchased Weiss unhopped malt extract and use that instead. I also added 3 cups of turbinado sugar to bost the ABV and an additional 1 oz. of Saaz hop pellets. As is the case with any of these kits the 1 week for bottle carbonation/conditioning is the bare minimum. I let mine bottle condition for 3 weeks before chilling and drinking with very good results. It produced a good refreshing "pilsner like" brew. A little cloudier than true pilsner, but great feel and flavor. True pilsner has to be fermented at pretty cool temperatures, and we don't see those very often in Tampa, so this is as close as I can get in a home brew. It was very refreshing, and with the summer heat and pool parties 6 gallons was gone in a flash.<br /><br />I have had good results with all the Coopers malts so far, and this is a great one for your friends who are used to macro brews. It has very good taste, but isn't so hoppy or malt heavy that it will give them pause.

Then I bought these tea bags on a whim and I haven't gone back. It's easier, there's less mess and it tastes just as great. I go through as many as six or seven cups a day.<br /><br />I buy mine at a local grocery store instead of online and as long as Bigelow makes them and my local grocery store sells them, I'll continue to buy them.

review/text: This is a breakfast food that simply cannot be beat. Sure, I like my own homemade waffles better, but for a store-bought brand, this is really good. It tastes great with other things like peanut butter, jelly, or honey. It stays crunchy for a decent amount of time if you toast it long enough (but don't worry, it doesn't need THAT much toasting) Toasting amount of time for this product is really a personal choice. This also tastes great with just butter and syrup, though add eggs for a nicely-balanced meal with a glass of almond milk or healthy OJ.

I've had to use these on several occasions for my morning sickness, and the 7 or so bags I've used so far have worked perfectly. They're very cute and discrete (as opposed to these bags <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TMW47W">Blue Emesis Bag 40 Oz. (1000ml) 12 Per Case</a> that draw a little more attention from co-workers and others) and have a nice wide opening as well. These are not "self sealing" like some others but they do close up perfectly well after use.  Also they are not really one-handed, but I haven't found that to be an issue. They are a bit pricey, but so are all of these type of bags. All in all, they are a great buy and work as described. I will definitely be purchasing more when these run out.

review/text: I first learned of this product in a unique pet store that sells foods for dogs and cats that are extraordinary.  These treats by Plato's Farmers Market are so pure that once you open the bag, the smells of raw fish and fresh vegetables fill the room!  I have three dogs and all three love these treats!  Dog lover's know that when one dog turns particular with taste, others will follow due to pack mentality!  However, these treats have been consistently appealing to these four footed ones of my  heart.  I have been feeding them these Plato treats for one year now and they are always enjoyable.  The ingredients are abundant with wholesome things, and probiotics to aid digestion.  They are not hard chews nor are they soft, so they appeal to dogs with all types of oral problems.  They are easily ground up for my little five pound poodle!  Excellent product with excellent results!  Thank you Amazon for offering these treats at a reduced price with free shipping!!

The sardines are a bit larger than those we typically buy at the grocery store and are also a bit more mild.  They offer a delicate sweetness and have a very nice texture.  If presentation is a concern when serving, they also seem to stay whole more easily and are more beautiful (plumper and with cleaner, with more of a shimmery skin) than others we have tried (I know that's a strange thing to say about fish, but it might matter if you're planning on serving these to guests).

review/summary: Is this one of the greatest rip-offs on Amazon?
review/text: It is really too bad that Trader Joe's doesn't sell their products on line.  I love this item, and when we go to California I always purchase these.  If we are driving I purchase a number of these treats and bring them home, so when I saw them on Amazon I was excited.  Then I looked at the product description. $15 for only ONE 1-lb bag!!  I doubled and tripled checked the description.  I had hoped it would be for at least 3 bags.  Is the price set so high because of the "free shipping"? At a Trader Joe's store these sell for $3.69 per bag.  (in 2012)  What a rip-off!  I would never pay over $11 more per bag for this, or any treat.  If the price actually includes shipping and handling, then let's not call it "free shipping."  Avoid this price scalping unless you just can't live without them.  The three star rating is because the price brought down my desire to purchase these yummy snacks.

review/text: The sauce (POORLY named) sounds W-A-Y worse than it is!  The flavor is hot but also DELICIOUS. I don't like a fire only.  . . . .but prefer some fire with lots of flavor like this has. A small opening in the bottle top let's you control just how hot you want to go. Use 1-2 drops for a saucerful of food if you are a wimp (like. . . .light to MAYBE medium heat buffalo chicken).  Add more if you are used to some heat. I've tried many, many hot sauces and no one can beat this flavor!!!  VERY NICE!<br /><br />No side effects for me. If you have a tablespoon or so per saucerful then it might have a healthy cleansing affect on you. ;-D  I'm glad to see Amazon sells this! Now I can stop being stingy with my last botle and order up some more! It's really a fair price because one bottle lasts a long time. Great in soup, chili, Chinese or Spanish dishes, with omlets Etc. . . .Etc.

review/text: My son was delighted to receive this as a gift for Christmas.  Awhile back we were given a gift pack of various salts and this flavor was his favorite.  It quickly was consumed and he commented about how much he missed this item.  Now he has a replenished supply.  We paired it with a bamboo salt box for a really unusual gift.

review/summary: Excellent quality white peppercorns
review/text: I was told years ago by many of the chefs at whose restaurants I dined in France and Italy that the quality of the spices in Europe is much higher because of the demand for the higher quality; as a result, we apparently do not receive the grade A spices in the US.  I was impressed by the quality of the spices at Hediard, Fauchon, etc...until recently.<br /><br />Many of those same chefs use either a large amount of, or exclusively, white pepper in their cooking, which was very surprising, as I had tried many sources, usually finding a fetid/fecal aroma in the background (sometimes the foreground!) of much of the product that I had purchased.  I commented on this to the previous head of Spice Hunter, who said that the problem is in production.  The least expensive method is the soak the peppercorns in ponds to remove the outer covering; the ponds become stagnant and the stagnant (read: fetid) aroma becomes part of the peppercorns.  The more expensive method is to soak the peppercorns in running water, which overcomes that problem.<br /><br />There is no comment about the production of this product, but I would be amazed if it were not the latter.  The aroma is so very exciting, with floral and spicy tones, and not a hint in the least of the off-putting aromas of other sources, even such well-known sources as Penzeys.  My wife and I are very delighted with this product.

review/text: Living in a very isolated area gives me few options as to where I purchase items such as these peppercorns.  Of the several I have tried, the quality and freshness of these are by far the best.  I use white pepper in many of the dishes I make and having good quality peppercorns is a must.  I was extremely satisfied with these.  As to the cost, I have found that you pretty much get what you pay for.  Yes, the shipping is outrageous but it is outrageous for everything these days.  You can by a used .01 cent paper back book, and still end up paying almost four dollars.  The cost here is well worth the price.

Holy cow, I have enough to last the rest of my life.<br /><br />The white peppercorns I got were exactly what I was expecting. I bought a white salt grinder for the white peppercorns. Now I have three grinders, salt, black, and white peppercorns.<br /><br />White pepper isn't as spicy as black pepper. Also if you bite into a white pepper crackle it wont burn like black pepper does.<br /><br />I love it on eggs. Also white peppered shrimp is amazing.

review/text: I ordered these white peppercorns from JR Mushrooms & Specialties via Amazon.com, and I have to say that these are the best white peppercorns I think I've ever had!  The amount you get (one pound) for the price completely blows local specialty shops and grocery markets right out of the water!  (Sorry local guys, but a rip-off is a rip-off, and frankly, JR's peppercorns are more fresh and flavorful!)  You won't regret shopping at JR's via Amazon.  The packaging is excellent, the delivery timeline is excellent, and the product is... well, I've already sung those praises above!  Oh, and a tip for you who order these, once the plastic bag is opened, just fill your pepper grinder(s), and put the remainder in a canning jar with a tight fitting lid, and store in a cool, dark place.  They stay fresh that way!!

review/summary: Buy This Chocolate
review/text: I am a hypoglycemic and have recently decided to respect my body's need for very low amounts of sugar so that I do not end up as a diabetic. Before beginning this new lifestyle my occosional sweet treat was a piece of chocolate, but because ALL of them are made with sugar / sugar alternative that raise insulin, I thought I had to give it up for life. Xylitol doesn't require insulin to metabolize so this chocolate is a god-sent. I love having it at the office when I want something sweet after lunch. I eat 2 pieces aftr lunch & I'm good to go for the rest of the day! I like having multiple flavors so I can try all of them. My favorite is the coconut.<br /><br />They are a little watery in the mouth BUT when you balance what you're getting (xylitol + herbal ingredients) it's a total win from all other alternatives, which will only raise your insulin and prevent your body from operating at it's best. Garbage in = garbage out. I'm happy I found a product that I can feel good about eating!<br /><br />They are expensive, roughtly $1 for each piece of chocolate, which is about as long as your index finger. If you're willing to pay, this is a fabulous product.

review/text: 5-Hour Energy Drink actually does work.  If I am exhausted, it does not make me feel great, but it will get me through.  It creates enhanced alertness, also seems to have a positive effect on eyesight and helps with tired eyes.  It does take most of the "awfulness" out of being overly tired, and can make it possible to do the things I still need to do if the day is not over, even if I wish it were.  The first time you take it, everything may seem "brighter" for a few moments (light sources may seem to "pop" slightly more than normal).  This passes, and it feels like you were able to take a 90-minute power nap.  For me, it lasts a bit less than the full 5 hours, but it is a very welcome boost.  There really is no crash for me when it wears off, as advertised, and it does not make me feel "wired", just more alert.  Not bad for something that comes in a little bottle for a couple bucks.  As with all good things, be sensible, and if you choose to try it, use in moderation.  I do not and would not use this every day, but it is nice to know it is there when needed from time to time.

review/text: I was skeptical about this product until I was on my way home during a very long business day and felt sleepy at the wheel. I stopped for a soda and thought I might get one of the energy drinks that the kids seem to like so much. While the drinks are loaded with sugar (calories), 5 Hour Energy is not. It worked and without the calories. I used the whole bottle and returned home safely in about three hours of driving. I have since used it the same way and had the same results. I don't use it regularly -- typically while driving and feeling more tired than I prefer. I have had no side effects and the lack of calories is a major benefit.

review/summary: Ok, it works, but the important thing is WHY it works
review/text: SUMMARY:<br />Ok so this is a long review, but the short summary is that although i regularly consume 5-Hour energy i do so with the knowledge that the effect i am feeling is mostly from the caffeine, and this effect is the same as caffeine consumption in coffee form, this also includes the "crash" later. The vitamin-B's added have as far as i have been able to find very little evidence supporting any effect, and at large doses some are toxic. I buy it in general because of the convenience of the concentrated form, and the fact that it is not calorie laden to the extreme (a la Starbucks). That said i could not find any evidence suggesting that 5-hour energy has any effects which makes it preferable to coffee<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Let me start out by saying that i am an avid 5 hour energy drinker. As a university student i go through at least a few every time a major exam week is coming up. Being a Psychology student with a focus on Neuroscience i decided to actually have a look at the contents of 5-Hr and and the scientific basis which merits its inclusion in the energy drink. Drugs that affect the body are intrinsically very complicated with many different effects on different parts of the body, so this is not a complete picture and will often be a very simplified one, but i think it will do for our purposes here.<br /><br />Caffeine:<br />5 hour energy contains caffeine, this i am sure comes as no surprise to anyone. What might be a surprise is that caffeine is a drug, this only means that it has a physiological effect on the body, but it is important for several reasons. One is that there is quite a lot of evidence for the buildup of both addiction and tolerance to caffeine, most people that regularly consume caffeine do build up tolerance, requiring larger consumption for the same effect .Without getting too technical caffeine works by effecting receptors on cells called "neurons", caffeine is what is called a "direct antagonist" to adenosine receptors. That means caffeine inhibits neurons from reacting to adenosine (it sort of works like a "cap" on top of the receptors stopping adenosine from attaching there). this inhibitory effect "increases" cerebral (brain) blood flow, as well as decrease the effects of adenosine on the brain, adenosine builds up in the body over an entire day, and seems to play an important part in promoting sleepiness. By blocking these receptors caffeine temporarily reduces the feeling of being tired. It does however in no way reduce the need to sleep overall, as adenosine is still building up in the body even when you have consumed the caffeine. It is like being under water, caffeine can act as a "air bubble" isolating us from the water for while, but once the air is used up you still need to deal with the water, in the case of adenosine, this means sleeping.<br /><br />The "crash" after caffeine consumption is simply the neurons again being affected by adenosine, so you are now feeling how tired the body really is, as caffeine has built up while you have been under the influence, the subjective experience is from a higher high then you were before to a lower low. The importance of this is that as far as i know there is NO WAY to remove this effect, unless more caffeine is consumed. As such the claim that there is "no crash later" sounds very disingenuous to me. There is also conflicting evidence as to whether or not caffeine improves mental alertness or just increases cognition in addicts back to a non-addict baseline, however as far as i know there is no consensus in either direction, and i am not willing to spend hours interpreting the papers dealing with this issue.<br /><br />Various vitamin B:<br />There is a lot of misconceptions out there as to what vitamins actually are. Vitamins are defined as any organic compound needed in tiny amounts that the body needs, but does not produce. So by definition we need Vitamin B, however that does not mean taking lots of them is good for you. Its a bit like saying "well the body needs carbohydrates to survive, so the more i eat the healthier i will get". So the question is not if vitamin B are effective (they are) but if they have an effect in large doses. Virtually everyone gets all the vitamin B the body needs, the one exception is usually pregnant women and vitamin B9.In general there is little to no evidence of positive effects on cognition or attention after consumption of any vitamin B, vitamin B is liquid soluble so most of it simply passes right through the body. The one *possible* exception is that there are some exploratory studies finding that vitamin B6 consumption in children with ADHD leads to better attentiveness and cognition. However these studies (at least the ones i was able to find) are generally small (30-50 participants) and thus unreliable. Even if there was a link this would most likely be linked to a specific deficit in people with ADHD, not the population as a whole. I also found several meta-analyses (papers reviewing other papers) that suggested no link between vitamin B6 (or B12) and increased cognition or attention.<br /><br />There is however a danger associated with some vitamin B's if consumed inappropriately. Overdosing on vitamin B6 and B3 is toxic to the body, so don't consume more than 2/day (recommended max from 5-hr themselves) for extended periods of time, it is well documented that vitamin B3 overdosing is associated liver damage in large quantities, while vitamin B6 is associated with nerve damage at high quantities the FDA sets their upper daily limit at 100mg which is roughly 70 times their recommended dosage, a bottle has 40mg B6 so you can do the math from there.<br /><br />Energy Blend:<br />So this is the shortest section because there is not really a lot to say, Glucuronic acid is sometimes used for more effective delivery of drugs, but doubtful that that is effective here. The much touted Taurine is also a non-story with the EFSA (think european FDA) stating that there is no effect positive or negative from the levels presented in energy drinks. at least one study suggests Citicoline might have some positive effect on memory in people with dementia, but i was unable to find a study which dealt with a healthy population.<br /><br />So why do i continue to consume 5-Hour? even though the vitamin B has little proven effect, the caffeine does, in the sense that it acts the way one would expect it to. I consume it because it is more convenient to bring around then coffee, is consumed faster, and tastes quite good (in my opinion), and at $1.70 a bottle, its cheaper than Starbucks and far less unhealthy.

review/summary: Caffeine Pills vs 5 Hour Energy
review/text: I have a job with a 3:30am start time.  Getting 8 hours of sleep is a rare thing and the job requires lots of focus and quick reactions.  I thought nothing was more powerful than a caffeine pill at 200mg per pill.  I've been known to break a pill in half thinking 100mg was enough in many cases.<br /><br />After finally trying 5 Hour Energy, I'm shocked at how it seemed to exceed the boost I got from one 200mg caffeine pill AND had the unexpected bonus of feeling an instant pickup with the very first couple of sips from the bottle! I drank it on a empty stomach with no problems. There was a very gradual let down of energy after 3.5 hours for me but not the infamous quick crash associated with caffeine. With a caffeine pill, I start losing the boost after about 4.5 hours.<br /><br />The problem is a bottle caffeine pills is 80% cheaper than 5 Hour so I don't think I will switch completely over to it but rather use it on occasion.<br /><br />NOTE: These supplements are no substitute for a full night's sleep for long-term health. That's also how the immune system is boosted.

The B vitamins help the cells in our body metabolize energy.<br /><br />In general, enhances your alertness.

review/text: I tried 5 Hour Energy for the first time today. Waking up quite groggy, I drank the whole thing at around 10am on my way to a meeting. I had the orange flavor, and while it wasn't the tastiest thing I've ever had, it wasn't the worst, either. Anyway, after seeing these commercials for years, the only reason I actually decided to buy one to try was because of all the surprisingly positive reviews here on Amazon. I took it fully expecting it to work... and it didn't. I did feel a slight perk, about what you'd expect from drinking a little less than half of a coffee, and given that the shot contains roughly the same amount of caffeine as a cup of coffee, that's no surprise. For the following 5 hours, I felt...pretty normal -- normal as in, "I don't feel any more energetic right now than any other day." I don't know how they get away with selling these little shots for $3 retail (about half that here on Amazon, if you buy in bulk), but you should save your money and just drink a cup of coffee, instead.

review/text: So, I am coming from the perspective of being rather addicted to caffeine. Now I am addicted to these 5 hour energy drinks. I use this to replace coffee or red bull, etc. It tastes better than any other energy drink I've tried (not saying a lot, but still doesn't taste that bad). It is small, so you don't have to commit a lot of time to drinking it. It has basically no calories or sugar, so it won't ruin your diet. And it even has vitamins! The "no crash later" claim is not 100% true, but it is definitely a gentler come down compared to anything else.<br /><br />Overall, gives a really nice kick without any real negatives!

review/summary: Makes Your Heart Race! It Doesn't Even Work that Great!
review/text: I bought a two ounce bottle today because I have to stay up all night finishing up a paper. I've never had one of these before so I followed the directions and drank only half the bottle first. After just 10 minutes I noticed my breathing was getting stronger and I felt very strange. My heart feels like it's racing so fast and it's making me feel very uncomfortable. I notice I'm not as tired as I was before, but not as focused and alert as I get when I drink a can of Amped. Besides that, I know it claims to be sugar free, but when I looked at the bottle I noticed it had a sugar substitute. To me, anything with sucralose is equally bad for you. Several people told me not to drink this and I foolishly ignored them. I will not drink this again.<br /><br />Ps. I drank this on a full stomach

review/summary: Seriously?
review/text: I honestly don't get the popularity of this item. It is nothing more than B complex in liquid form. I guess it's something to take if you don't carry around a small bottle of B vitamins. Maybe I drink too much coffee and that is why I can't appreciate the energy effects of a B complex, I think taurine and guarana are much better energy sources. Whether you prefer B vits, caffeine, taurine or guarana, below are products that will give you what this product gives you(or more) at a much more reasonable price.<br /><br />B supplements:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00020HQAU">B-100 Complex 100 caps</a><br />Super Stress B Complex 100 Caps<br /><br />Liquid B supplements:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NOUDE">Nature's Bounty B-Complex Sublingual Liquid 2 fl oz (59 ml)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00125W1AO">World Organic - Liquid B Complex, 16 fl oz liquid</a><br /><br />Caffeine, Taurine & Guarana:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MTM0WK">Red Bull Energy Drink, Sugarfree, 8.4 Ounce Can (Pack of 24)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J2O4YC">Diet Rockstar Energy Drink-Double Strength Energy Drink 16oz, 24 Pack</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DNBYXK">Monster Lo-carb Energy 16-Ounce., 27.5 LBS Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BQSQ68">NOW Foods Taurine Pure Powder, 8-Ounce</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000703AU0">Super Guarana 1200mg - 90 tabs,(Good N' Natural)</a><br /><br />Personally, I  think it's silly to cough up two dollars for one shot of this when you can have the same level of energy, through the same vitamins at a much cheaper price.

review/text: Need that extra energy drive?<br />Pop one of these and you will be good to go!<br />Again it will depend how well you respond to energy drinks/supplements. So before you comit to buying a whole case of these, you should def go grab one and see how it affects you! Everyone is different. As a red bull drinker, the 5hr energy shot is a nice change up and It gets me thru the day when I'm exhausted!

review/summary: Not consistent; not for everyone
review/text: I tried this for 5 days. I did one a day just for pushing through workouts. The first time was great! I felt great and I worked out really hard. I never had so much endurance to keep pushing. My mood was good too.<br /><br />The second day, things started to slide downhill. I started to get irritable, my heart rate felt slightly wrong (I'm only 22), and I became very angry. The following days, I felt really depressed. After pulling myself off of these I felt better.<br /><br />You can't expect these to work for everyone. It's great as a one-time thing where you know you'll need to be up an entire night. But consistent use may cause problems even if it's just one a day.<br /><br />Take these with caution... and pay attention closely to how your body responds to them even over time.
