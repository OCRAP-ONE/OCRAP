review/summary: My favorite flavor so far...
review/text: I received a Keurig machine for my birthday last month. I have tried so many types of k-cups I've lost count! But, the Green Mountain Pumpkin Spice is one I'm sticking with. I wish it was offered year round, because when I run out; I am really going to miss it! It may not be an extra bold flavor, but it is full of flavor when used on the 6 ounce setting. I've been using two teaspoons of non-flavored liquid creamer and one teaspoon of sugar to a 6 ounce cup, and it tastes really good! It's the closest thing to a pumpkin spice latte I can make in the comfort of my own home. As a person who is relatively new to Keurig, I have learned that it is best to use exact measurements with cream and sugar, so you can figure out exactly how you like it and stick with it, so you can have a perfect cup of coffee every time. I should also mention that I do not normally like flavored coffees, but I love this one!

review/text: These are my favorite K-cups by far.  I stock up every fall so that they will last me the whole year.  But, save your money and buy them at Bed Bath and Beyond.  They're $11.99 for 18 cups there, and you can use a 20 percent off coupon to make them even cheaper...

review/summary: Weak.  Odd "spice".
review/text: One of the weakest KCup varieties I've tried.  It was like drinking spiced water.  No creaminess at all.  The spice is also a little off - very clove-y.  Brewed on the smallest setting it's drinkable but definitely not what I was hoping for.

This is definately not the same coffee that I've enjoyed so much over the last 2 years. I really hope they bring back the original flavor!!! What a shame!!!

review/text: My husband brought home a pumpkin spice k-cup for me to try. I was excited, as I love pretty much anything pumpkin. One sip of this, and I nearly gagged! It was so awful! Whatever spices they use to flavor this are way too overpowering. My husband thought I was over reacting and he took a sip and choked too! It really is one of the worst flavored coffees I have ever had. I would rate it a 0 if I could.

review/text: Green Mountain Pumpkin Spice K-cups only come out once a year usually in the fall. This is a favorite for me and my husband. I like to add some coffee creamer and a couple splenda or a little sugar.  Doing that turns a simple cup of coffee into a wonderful treat.  It's like having guilt free pumpkin pie!! You should defiantly try Pumpkin Spice K-cups when they are available.

review/text: I was so excited for the return of Green Mountain's pumpkin spice K-cups this fall, but when I received my large order of pumpkin spice k-cups, I found the coffee to be much weaker and thinner than I remembered last year.  It had been a wonderful rich, full bodied coffee and now I'm stuck with boxes of weak, thin coffee.  Save your money or try before you buy - it's not the same.

review/summary: More "spice" than "pumpkin"
review/text: For years I've been buying pumpkin flavored coffee beans every fall from the coffee shop in my local Borders. Its a flavor I look forward to every year! Well, Borders closed, but we just got our Keurig machine so I was excited to try the pumpkin spice flavor from Green Mountain.  The flavor is disappointing to this pumpkin fan, though.  It is very heavy on the spice; the pumpkin flavor is negligible. I would call it cinnamon coffee rather than pumpkin spice coffee.

review/text: Actually ordered these K-cups for my daughter who likes them. I kept a couple of them to try and although I'm not big on flavored coffee, I kind of like this taste once in awhile. Probably would not buy a whole box for myself but keeping a couple of cups around is good for me. I think this is a taste that you would either like or hate. But I can see how it's really different from the sweeter flavored ones.

review/text: I love pumpkin spiced coffee and this one is good but not great, in my opinion.  I don't know what "spice" they used but it's drowns out the pumpkin taste (kind of like "allspice" does).  I like my coffee with just a little milk and many people are recommending this with a flavored creamer so that may help.  I like it enough to finish the box but probably won't buy it again.  I make my OWN pumpkin spice lattes (VERY EASY- look online for recipe) and will stick to that in the future.

My taste buds are happy stopping in for a WaWa or Royal Farms flavored coffee and creamer.  If you have similar tastes, and like pumpkin pie, you'll enjoy this coffee, especially during October/November.  Coffee Mate puts out a Pumpkin Spice creamer that I use with it and it's sinfully good!  I will probably be happy to move on to other flavors come December, but for now I'm lovin' life.

I should say, though, that I am NOT an avid coffee drinker, so if you are and want something strong, this isn't it. But if you love yummy flavors and aromas, add it to your cart! I'm a big fan!

review/text: I bought a box of this so called coffee and it was so bad I threw out all but the 6 cups I tried to drink.  At first I thought my Keurig was going out but not so.  This coffee was so weak it was little more than slightly off-color water.  Maybe it was a bad box.  I don't know but can't waste any more money finding out.

review/summary: Weird After Taste
review/text: I was really excited to see this flavor of coffee in K cups because my hubby loves anything pumpkin and thought this would be a great surprise to him. Unfortunately it has a really odd after taste. He thinks its the type of coffee used with the pumpkin flavoring but I'm not too sure. Either way we'll never buy this product again.

review/summary: Terrible....possibly the worst ever
review/text: I tried this flavor 2 years ago right after I bought my first Keurig machine.  It had a good smell but the taste was completely awful.  It was so heavy on the cloves that it obliterated everything else.  The pumpkin flavor was barely discernable as was any other spice...where are the cinnamon and nutmeg flavors?  There was nothing I could do to make this kcup palatable.  I tried flavored creamers, syrups, whipped cream, cinnamon and nutmeg.  I mixed it with other kcups (french vanilla, caramel drizzle, obsidian, french and italian roasts).  The result was it ruined my favorite flavors/brews! I had to toss the last few kcups and the box (after a year of it sitting on my shelf and taunting me).  I would not let anyone else drink this vile swill.  I found one recently hiding in my storage draw that I no longer use for kcups.  I resisted the urge to beat it with a baseball bat and just tossed it in the garbage.  Top 3 worst ever:  Pumpkin spice, Wolfgang Puck Sumatra Kopi Raya (another spice problem), and Folger's Vanilla Biscotti (incredibly artificial).  Honorable mention goes to Caribou Mahogany.  Trust me on this...NEVER try a coffee that describes it's taste as leather and tobacco. Sometimes, there actually IS truth in advertising! If you want good pumpkin coffee, run out and buy the Dunkin Donuts kcup.  It's everything the green mountain pumpkin spice should have been....smooth, balanced, a hint of spice and you can actually taste the pumpkin.

review/summary: Bad Buy
review/text: I think that, unless there has been a change in the recipe, people who rate this product highly are confusing aroma with flavor.  This "coffee" has a wonderful aroma as it brews, but it has no taste at all.  In fact, while I can smell the pumpkin spice, I can not distinguish the taste of this stuff from simple hot water.  To give it any flavor at all, I need to add a creamer and/or some sugar to it, or maybe even a little brandy.  That is a very bad thing (not the brandy), since I like my coffee black without any additives at all.<br /><br />If Green Mountain wants to make a mild "flavored" coffee rather than a medium or bold flavor, that's ok, but the very least they should do is use their breakfast blend as a starting point and work from there with their various spices. Until then, I'm sorry, but as much as I would like to do so, I can not recommend this product to anyone who likes the taste of coffee.

review/summary: It's okay
review/text: I really enjoy my coffee, but usually do not like flavored coffees.  (I'm actually a bit of a snob with my coffee, getting fresh-roasted beans, using my french press, raising my nose at drip makers...  yet sometimes I do find the convenience of a single-serve Keurig cup irresistible, and not bad at all in a pinch).  The one exception to my "no flavored coffees" is SB's Pumpkin Spice Latte.  YUM.  So, I was tempted by this and tried it.<br /><br />It definitely smells better than it tastes.  The smell takes you right back to SB's Latte and sets your expectations high.  The taste, well, not so much.  It's that typical discourse between smell and taste that makes me not like flavored coffee to begin with.<br /><br />But the truth is I will likely come back and have one of these every now and again... it's just not as good as I was hoping.  The fact that a flavored coffee gets any respect from me at all should actually be considered a "win", so take that for what it's worth.  If you dig flavored coffee as a rule, I wouldn't be surprised if you loved this.  And even if you aren't usually a flavored coffee person, if you like the P.S. Latte, you may make an exception for this.

review/text: I purchased a large box of this Pumpkin Spice coffee for my family without first trying a sample and not one of us said anything more positive than "it has spices I do not like".  Most of the comments were  "I hate this stuff, where did you get it , I like things with pumpkin but I cannot taste any pumpkin"  Long story short,  with my family, I wasted my money trying to give them a treat.. instead it turned into a sad trick.  Not for me and mine.. but  perhaps that is why Baskin Robbins has 30+ flavors of ice cream ?

review/text: I had to write something after seeing the negative reviews.<br /><br />I tried this only recently, but this is an excellent pumpkin-flavored k cup; it tastes like what you hope it should. I highly recommend a pumpkin spice creamer (which they always sell this time of year anyway) if you want to truly replace the Starbucks experience.<br /><br />Is it weak? In flavor, no. In potency, yes. This would make a good evening coffee to share with company or a relaxing cup in the middle of the day. It wouldn't be my first choice for the morning wake-up. I don't see any reason why that should take away from this coffee's quality, however. It's a flavored coffee; if you want strong, you generally don't look to these flavored blends anyway.

review/text: My wife and I purchased this to try a little different taste from our Keurig coffees, and overall, it delivers on what you would expect.  It has a distint pumpkin taste without being overbearing.  It is not our favorite Keurig flavored coffee, but it is enjoyable for something different.

review/summary: Back for More...
review/text: Let's start by saying I generally don't like pumpkin flavored items. Let's next say that I LOVE this coffee. It is by far my favorite Keurig Flavor of the moment. We have purchased this several times and keep coming back for more. Unlike Hazelnut (which tens to be too sweet) this is a nicely robust coffee, with a touch of spice that you might expect in a pumpkin pie and tastes wonderful. Being an avid coffee drinker this one gets a hearty thumbs up.

review/text: This coffee is fantastic. I dont even like flavored coffee, but I think this one is the exception. I tried it on a whim, because I am a sucker for pumpkin anything, and now I am hooked on it. I brew it using the medium size selection and it it perfect every time.

review/summary: Not the strongest coffee, but a nice fall flavor
review/text: Generally if coffee has flavor, I prefer it to be sweet rather than spicy (I do not even like cinnamon flavored coffee or creamers), so I was a bit unsure how pumpkin flavor would blend with coffee.  It is actually a nice blend.  The pumpkin and spice flavors, while apparent, are not overpowering and blend well with the coffee, rather than competing with it.  It smells wonderful, and if I could pump the smell through the house 24/7, I would.<br /><br />The coffee itself is a bit on the weaker side.  I realize that flavored coffee is not going to have the same bold flavor as a dark roast, but this is weaker than other flavors I have tried (and there have been many!). As with most k-cups, I recommend brewing on the smallest setting.  The smallest setting on my Keurig is 6 ounces; if your model has a smaller size setting, I would suggest trying it.  It is definitely worth picking up a box if you enjoy the flavors of fall.

review/text: I'm not a flavored coffee lover, but I decided to try this.  I love cinnamon and tried the cinnamon roll coffees and hated them.  Green Mountain Pumpkin Spice is the perfect blend of holiday spices.  It's spicy but mild and delicious.

review/text: We love this tasty fall inspired brew, its a light and aromatic brew well received at breakfast or as an afternoon alternative to tea, coffee or hot chocolate. We loved this brew so much we stocked up just in case others did share our same opinion and the product. I even promoted the k-cups so heavily I brought one in for each of my coffee loving office mates and friends.

review/summary: The luxury of a pumpkin spice latte without the calories!
review/text: I sampled Green Mountain's pumpkin spice coffee and was immediately hooked. It's a lighter roast but still not washed out, but best of all the cinnamon and clove flavor comes through at just the right intensity. So now I get the luxury of a pumpkin spice latte by adding warm skim milk and save all those sugar calories! What I especially love about this blend is that the clove comes through nicely. It's not overpowering but you can distinctly make it out. I love that, and if you love clove too I think you'll love it as much as I do.

I bouught 4 boxes in 6 weeks, and usually, I could care, maybe 1 or 2 cuppas daily. This is a winner. Complex notes of nutmeg all spice and sugar like you are face first in pumpkin pie.

review/text: Love this flavor. A splash of my standard French Vanilla non-fat creamer and it's the closest thing to a pumpkin spice latte I can make at my desk. It tastes good without being too sweet, which can be hard with coffee. Perfect for warming up in the fall and winter.

review/text: I was leery of this flavor, but really tempted also because of the 'fall-ness' of it and I love the whole pumpkin spice idea.  I bought it elsewhere cheaper, and glad I did because the price wasn't worth it.  It is basically a hot nutmeg drink.  No coffee, no pumpkin - just nutmeg.  I'm not a huge fan of nutmeg so this won't rate at the top of my list.
