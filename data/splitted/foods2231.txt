review/summary: More Mild than Medium. Smooth. No Aftertaste.
review/text: Green Mountain Nantucket Blend is a palate pleasing mild-medium blend.  I would put it more towards the mild side than the medium side.  It is very smooth and has no aftertaste.<br /><br />As a comparison, the blend is about the same strength as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TC7WN4">Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Breakfast in Bed (Medium Roast), 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewer</a> and is slightly stronger than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004GN8NP6">Green Mountain Coffee Our Blend, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a>.

review/summary: Delicious medium-roast blend with complex tones
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:30 Mins<br /><br /></span>The name belies an intoxicating medium-roast blend that fuses flavors from Central America, Indonesia and East Africa. The Nantucket Blend is deliciously complex - a m&eacute;lange of four coffees from three continents - opening with the aroma of berries, spice and wine and soft floral undertones and finishing smoky and sweet with a touch of French Roast.<br /><br />According to the Green Mountain Coffee website, the blend's origin dates back more than 20 years ago, "created at the request of a loyal customer who lived on Nantucket Island. The blend proved a winner, and the name stuck."<br /><br />I drink Nantucket Blend black, using Keurig's small mug (7.25 oz) setting. My wife, who will often add creamer to darker roasts, also enjoys this blend black.<br /><br />In summary, this medium-roast blend is a new favorite in our house. We first purchased Nantucket Blend during an Amazon sale for about 55 cents per Keurig cup. Regular price is about 66 cents, 15 cents higher per cup than other brands. Is it worth the additional price? Yes, but keep an eye out for sales.<br /><br />Added bonuses:<br />Nantucket Blend is certified kosher by the Orthodox Union.<br />Green Mountain Coffee is Fair Trade Certified.<br />Green Mountain Coffee is organic.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.<br /><br />BTW: Here are other K-cup coffees I've recently reviewed for Amazon:<br /><br />5 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFUDC">Coffee People Donut Shop Medium Roast</a><br />5 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039556K2">Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle</a><br />4 stars: Green Mountain Coffee Wild Mountain Blueberry<br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL68Y">Tully's Coffee Kona Blend</a><br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XNW">Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic</a><br />3 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KKS">Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend</a><br />3 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00390VIQI">Green Mountain Coffee Fair Trade Gingerbread</a>

review/summary: A saving grace for Green Mountain Coffee...
review/text: When we received our Keurig Elite for Christmas, we were so excited to break open the sample pack of pods to try out different blends and flavors. Of the 12 pods we had in the box, four were Green Mountain Coffee brand. I'd never tried anything from this company before, but from what I had researched online, they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee. We tried their Dark Magic, Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming, to say the least. I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther.<br /><br />We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of waste-not-want-not, I figured I'd give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely. And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee. It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent (unlike some of the other GM blends we tried). I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go-to Caribou Blend pods. Almost. All in all, this is a very standard cup of coffee which, while it isn't anything new or exciting, is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we've been able to test out. When we run out of all the pods we've accumulated, I'll probably pick up a box of these as well.<br /><br />Now that I know Green Mountain isn't completely disappointing I'll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees (with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I3Y4IE">Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> to try as well) and see how it goes from there.<br /><br />If you're looking for a go-to choice, this is your cup!

review/summary: Fantastic Yellow Corn Grits, recipe included below
review/text: As a native Southerner, I've eaten grits all my life but I'd never had yellow, coarsely ground corn grits before I tried Bob's. From the moment my family tried these grits about two or three years ago, we've eaten no other grits. We cook these grits every weekend, usually Saturday and Sunday mornings. Oh, we've tried a few good regional products, but they're just not as good as Bob's (for instance, Lakeside yellow grits are good, but because they're more finely ground, Lakeside is a bit too creamy, tasting almost like a corn porridge). I prefer the more coarse grind of Bob's yellow grits, and the flavor is exceptional. The corn flavor in Bob's comes through, but not in an overpowering way - not to sound like a geek foodie, but Bob's yellow grits have a fantastic taste and mouthfeel. It's hard to explain, but I recommend you try them. If you're not sure you want to bite off a bulk multi-bag purchase via Amazon, then check your local grocery store (Publix in the Southeast carries Bob's, as do many organic/gourmet grocers). Regarding price: Bob's Red Mill products aren't cheap, but the company fills a very unique niche (Gluten-free products, unusual flours, etc.) and I'm willing to pay the price to keep the company from disappearing. Plus, every product from Bob's Red Mill that I've ever tried has been superior, including these grits.<br /><br />Oh, and NEVER follow the cooking directions on a bag or box of grits - that's the primary reason non-Southerners think grits are nasty, because they make grits without the necessary amounts of butter, salt and milk or cream. Also, these are not quick cook grits, so it will take about 15-20 minutes from the time the water boils to achieve smooth, cooked grits. To feed four people (assuming you also have pancakes and a meat for breakfast), use three cups water brought to a boil, then gently shake about 2/3 cup of grits into the water. Once the water/grits combo comes to a boil, immediately lower the heat to simmer and stir frequently. [A note about lumps: if you don't stir often enough, you get lumps; if you dump the grits in, rather than shaking them in slowly, you get lumps.] Add two or three tablespoons of salted butter, then an unholy amount of salt. I'm afraid to measure how much salt we actually use (we salt to taste as we cook), but I would guess we use two or more teaspoons of salt. To avoid oversalting, start with one teaspoon of salt, taste when you're almost done, then add additional milk and salt to taste. Depending on how thick you like your grits, add additional water (we prefer to use 1% milk) to thin them out a bit. You can also add chopped bacon or country ham to your final product for flavor.<br /><br />A word about polenta: Any Southerner can tell you that grits left in a pot to cool become polenta... so go ahead, and impress your Yankee and West Coast friends by "grilling up" leftover slices of your breakfast for dinner. Remember, the Americas introduced corn to Europe (including Italy), so grits came first.

Then, for some reason, the grocery store discontinued it....so I went looking on line and found this person and HIGHLY reccommend them and their product.<br /><br />The Polenta came promptly, was wrapped carefully.....I am very satisfied and happy to have found a good new source for this wonderful, nutritious polenta.<br /><br />Do give "Bob's Red Mill Grits Corn Polenta" a try if you like Polenta and have never tried thier brand....I think you will be very pleased as I am.

review/summary: Organic doesn't always mean quality.
review/text: There are 4 primary sources for cinnamon used in cooking. Ceylon cinnamon is "true" cinnamon and is not toxic, the Saigon, Cassia and Burmannii contain high amounts of coumarin (1200x the amount of ceylon) a toxic compound that affects the nervous system. Simply organic uses the latter of the four because it is cheap do to having an extremely low oil content. Basically it is junk. If your cinnamon is bitter and not sweet (and this is) it is toxic. So just because it is "organic" does not mean it is good for you. I bought some hoping that it was right because none label their sources and am severely disappointed. On a side note the same is true of imitation vanilla having dangerously high amounts of coumarin from using the Tonka do to the fact it contains a lot of vannillan.

review/summary: Horrible Taste
review/text: I bought this at my local grocery store. I now have it bagged to go back for a refund of my money. It has a horrible flavor - sort of how you would expect a pine tree and cinnamon to taste if they were ground together. I smelled it after I had decided to take it back, and it doesn't even smell like normal cinnamon. It has a medicinal smell. You can smell the cinnamon, but there is something else there that is not pleasant.<br /><br />I will never by this product again, and I wouldn't advise anyone else to buy it.

review/summary: sweet
review/text: I'm surprised that all the reviews here are not positive. This cinnamon is the best I've tasted out of 4 varieties, including McCormick's Saigon and roasted Saigon. This is the first organic cinnamon I've had. Without trying more varieties, I can't say it's the best, but it very sweet compared to the others I've tried. It's good enough to eat on plain bread so that you really taste the flavor. I would recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />To those who mentioned they thought this product contained something harmful, you did not get that information from the product's page, because it states exactly what type of cinnamon is in the bottle, and it's not the kind you are worried about. Check your facts!<br /><br />UPDATE: The second bottle I tried of this did not taste as flavorful as the first, so this inconsistency can explain why some people say it barely tastes at all while others are saying it is flavorful enough.

review/summary: Concerned for the consumer
review/text: I did some research on just exactly what kind of "cinnamon" is actually used in this product because I became concerned when I read a few of the reviews. Eight paragraphs down on the Simply Organics website they state that they use Korintje (Cinnamomum burmanii). To quote the website "The most commonly found cinnamon in American kitchens is Indonesian cassia. It is sourced from higher elevations and is harvested a bit earlier than Chinese and Vietnamese cinnamons. Korintje translates as "thick quill" and is judged for quality based on the part of the tree that is harvested (trunk vs. branch) and on the length of the bark peeled from the tree. We bring you the highest quality Korintje cinnamon available."<br /><br />So they DO use Cassia and not the Ceylon, true cinnamon. They also state that Cassia and Cinnamon are not the same, they start with that. Then they end the product description explaining all the health benefits of TRUE CINNAMON, not the Cassia that they are really selling you. I really wish I had known that they used the Cassia, because I would not have bought it. And I do realize that they are trying to confuse you, the consumer into thinking that their product is really good for you. This is why everyone should research the products that they use and inform themselves of what they are consuming!<br /><br />[...]

review/text: This is the best variety of ribbon candy that I have found.  It is available from a variety of sources before Christmas, and there is a significant variation in price.  Christmas candy is fashioned to look like holiday ribbons, and is often used for a holiday decoration displayed in a glass container (preferable a shallow bowl).  The thin ribbon candy is fragile, and is easily broken, but pieces need to be broken off to eat the candy.  If purchased in bulk, from a wholesale source, it can be used for a variety of purposes (customer and client promotions, distribution to groups of children, etc.)

The food - Earthborn Dry food  is excellent for my 8 years old and the date on the bag shows its optimal freshness , always well ahead of delivery. Also cost is reasonable and lower than some competitors on line.

People that don't eat hot sauce on a daily basis will probably find this enjoyable.  Pepperheads will find this to be really weak, tangy and disappointing.  It's a showpiece bottle that I wouldn't buy again.

review/summary: Tasty decaf
review/text: My physician has suggested that I try to use more decaf and less regular coffee. Indeed, I have experimented with a number of decaf products over the past several months. Some are good, some aren't. Some have a nice coffee taste; others are pretty bland.<br /><br />I have tried some of Newman's Own K-cup flavors and have generally found the whole line pretty satisfying. This decaf is no exception. It has a nice coffee taste (it is labeled "extra bold). It isa organic, to the extent that that has value for the person wishing to try a cup out. For me, though, the key thing is that it has a good coffee taste and I like starting the day off with a decent cup.<br /><br />So, if you'd like to trey out a decaf, this isn't a bad starting point.

review/summary: Great tasting coffee!
review/text: I'm really surprised that it's just as good as the caffinated coffee I've been drinking for years. Being organic and water processed is what sold me..and I can tell the difference between the Newman's and other regular decaf. Newman's is the best, at least for me anyway. It may be slightly milder in strength than the Starbucks but it didn't take me long to get used to it. It's still a great flavor, less acid for sure - and no caffeine.  I'm a satisfied customer!

review/text: I bought this decaf coffee for my wife and she was surpised at the flavor (it actually had great flavor). I tried it and it was very good. Clean and crisp, and enough coffee in there, that you can brew a large cup (press the small cup selection, let it brew, then press the small cup selection again) and it is still very good coffee. In fact, I'm going to go brew some now for myself :)<br /><br />I bought this from Amazon and have always been very happy with their shipping, packing, etc. This order was no different! Thank you!!

review/text: Well, sorta brown, at least.  More like a light tan, maybe.<br /><br />I purchased on the strength of reviews here and on the strength of the Newman's Own brand.  Swing and a miss on both counts.<br /><br />I made my cups on the standard 8 ounce setting, and even that couldn't produce any concentration of flavor. A tiny dab of milk reduced it even further.<br /><br />The worst decafs have all the allure, flavor and aroma of melted brown crayon, and this K cup struggles even to meet that very low bar. Good decaf isn't that difficult to obtain, but it was apparently a cup too far for this brand.

review/summary: Typical Great Newman's Product--K cup Coffee
review/text: As usual with Newman's Own Products, I found his Special Blend Decaf K-cup coffee to be great. Strong enough for me, without being very acidic.  I continue to be a K cup lover, despite my feelings of overpaying for "home-brewed" coffee.  The K cups are just so darn convenient and easy to make.  I keep my K cup cooker right on my bedroom lavatory shelf.  Turn it on when I get up and the coffee is ready to brew before I have finished with my morning tasks.  And the Special Blend is oh so good.

I'll have to try a smaller setting, but really, it feels like it'd just be a waste as I'd like more than just a 6 or 4oz cup.  It's is quite lght however that I'm not optimistic that I would make much difference.  *FYI : I drink my coffee black.<br /><br />Good news: I purchased these for my teens who sometimes like a cup of creamy coffee, and... this satisfies their coffee cravings.  So three stars because it's not what I would usually purchase again, but the teeners like it.

Taste very much like a cheap restaurant coffee, watered down with hardly any coffee taste. I happen to like robust coffee taste, and this one doesn't even qualify as "medium".<br />If you like good coffee taste in your decaf coffees, I would highly recommend the Green Mountain Robust Magic and for a little lighter touch the Donut House Decaf or Tully's.<br />Also, of all the different brands I tried, the Newman's Own was the only decaf that gave me an acid stomach reaction.<br />NOT recommended!

review/text: Okay, so it wasn't one of my proudest moments.  I didn't check my order or I would have realized I had ordered Newman's Own "DECAF", when I meant to order Newman's Own Extra Bold!!!  My bad!!  Needless to say when I got the order I was very upset.  That being said, I kept the DECAF and found that now I can enjoy the awesome flavor of Newman's coffee late at night while I read or watch TV, and I can still go to sleep when I'm ready.  It is a double edged sword though.  I am disabled, and therefore I can't afford to order what I intended to, which was Newman's Own Extra Bold.  It is absolutely THE BEST coffee ever.  Add a little Bailey's Creamer and what a great way to start your day.  Those 80 decaf K-Cups are going to last me well into the cold weather, which is great.  Lord only knows when I can get my Newman's Extra Bold.  I love ordering from Amazon though.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LSM98O">Newman's Special Blend Extra Bold (24 K-cups) Keurig</a>

review/summary: One of the finest cream sodas available
review/text: Boylan Bottleworks Creme is one of the finest sodas available anywhere in North America.  It is quite sweet, but the cane sugar used gives it a very even flavor that compliments the heavy feeling of the pure vanilla extract.  This is a cream soda with a robust character, completely unspoiled by any discordant notes.  The only nationally available cream soda I can recommend over this one is the more complex Henry Weinhard Vanilla Cream, but truly each has their merits.<br /><br />Boylan's attractive clear-glass bottles compliment the fabulous caramel colour and the beverage is Kosher, so these make a fine addition to any social gathering.  Perhaps the only downside to this product is the 11.6 ounces in each bottle; with a soda of such phenomenal caliber, it's a shame to be missing even 0.4 of the usual 12.

You do have to be careful of some of the "flavored" varieties as they may have some corn or wheat in them, but the plain rice ones do not!  Very Good!!!

review/text: I am a newly diagnosed celiac, changing my entire food world ( and inadvertently that of my family ).  My goal is to experiment with creating my own baked goods and avoid going bankrupt buying shelf-items that are gluten-free.  Meanwhile, these wee crackers are helping me with the transition.  I LOVE the version with sesame, but these (1) are plain enough to go with a variety of dips and cheeses, (2) are part of the "subscribe & save" program on Amazon, and (3) my whole family and all the kids who come to our house love them.<br />That's a win-win-win!

review/summary: Let It Snow
review/text: For those of you who can make chili from scratch, I salute you.  Nothing--and I mean nothing--beats a hot bowl of spicy chili on a frigid day.  The ground beef, the seasonings, the mixings, the ingredients:  chili is a celebration of zesty flavor.  And for those less talented (or less inclined) than the lucky souls who can whip up a kettle of home-made chili, I recommend HORMEL.<br /><br />HORMEL CHILI has been a kitchen staple for generations.  Fully cooked, containing 100% USDA beef, HORMEL really hits the spot when it's cold outside.  Granted, it's chili from a can, but its seasonings and blendings are the next best thing to home-made.  A steaming bowl of HORMEL CHILI, augmented by some saltine crackers, is the perfect ending to clearing the snow off the driveway, raking all those leaves, or even coming home from a winter sporting event. Just heat, serve. . .enjoy.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.

review/summary: Yummy for chili cheese dip too!
review/text: This is one of our family favorites for making chili cheese dip in a slow cooker.  These smaller cans are nice because you can start with 3-4 cans, then add more as needed instead of buying the huge institutional size can.  To the chili, just add an 8 ounce block of cream cheese, a 4 ounce can of chopped green chilies, 4 tablespoons of chili powder, stir and you're set.  For more spice, add some cayenne or even jalapenos instead of chilies, but that would be REALLY hot.  Nice for feeding a crowd a hot appetizer.  Just put a bowl of tortilla chips next to the slow cooker and watch it disappear.  Bean appetit! ;)

review/text: My children love this variety pack! It has all of their favorite little treat snacks. My only complaint is that occasionally a bag may only contain a very minuscule amount of the product. My children have a tendency to pour their bag of cookies out on a paper towel and count them out for fun or to trade one with a sibling. Inevitably I get the "mom my bag of cookies only had 4 inside and my brother got 6"! I dont really understand why they dont just put an equal amount in each bag but...what can you do?!
