review/summary: A pet favorite in our home
review/text: Our 4 year old mutt is loving this hearty dry dog food!  We had always been fans of the Chef Michael's wet canned food, giving it to our healthy dog since she was a year old.  But this new dry food is a great addition with thick, tasty chunks and nutritious ingredients.  The combination of veggies and meat make for a well balanced meal.  We don't add water to make it juicy since our dog loves sinking her teeth into the crunchy pieces, but for an occasional variation the added water mixes a nice soupy texture.  One thing I particularly like is that the food doesn't stink really badly like other commercially prepared pet foods.  An affordable, healthy choice for your pup.

review/summary: Great flavour and the dog seems to love it!
review/text: We feed our black lab in the IQ treat ball (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ARUKTG/). There are always a few final bits he would leave in it, but when we tried this Grilled Sirloin dry food, he would bring the ball to me to try and get even the final bits out! So it must taste pretty good. The beef pieces are a bit -odd shaped and might get stuck in those treat ball holes, but otherwise, it's fine.<br /><br />The daily feeding recommendations are 1 cup per 10lb body weight which seems a bit high for beef-containing dog food. For a 50 lb dog, the 4.5 lb bag might last for ~ a week (One cup of this food is ~70-75g).

review/summary: Real beef is first ingredient, puppy loves it
review/text: I'm slowly weaning my puppy off Puppy Chow, so I've been adding Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin dry food to his dry food. Pooper, my puppy, is a picky eater and he loves to steal cat food and he will hardly eat dry food unless I mix wet food into it. Though, he will eat this dog food without any wet food added to it. This dry food actually smells good even to me. My cats even tried to steal a piece of this dry food.<br /><br />I have 4 dogs, 3 outside my husband's coonhounds and my one inside dog,Pooper, who is a lovable mutt who is 1/2 German Shepard, 1/4 Boxer and 1/4 Cocker Spaniel. I will continue to buy this dog food for my inside dog. Though, it's too pricy on my budget to feed all of my dogs.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this for any picky dog. My picky Pooper loves it.

review/summary: Woof! Woof! Woof, woof, woof! (... or, apparently tastes great, but...)
review/text: Normally my daughter's Pomeranian is fed a diet of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W5U5H6">Taste of the Wild Dry Dog Food, Hi Prairie Canine Formula with Roasted Bison & Venison, 15-Pound Bag</a>, or another of their variety's of dry dog food.  Thanks to some previous recommendations (a nice chart/web site that compared the various dog food products and rated them based on meat content, grain and other by-product inclusion, etc.), we'd settled on that as one of the better quality products to feed to our furry little friend.  Unfortunately there were issues with a recall related to possible salmonella in the dog food that required taking back one bag of the T.o.t.W. food, but even that was quickly enough resolved by the local store we tend to get her food from (that bag was accepted back for store credit, with me already having obtained a bag of another flavor T.o.t.W. product that wasn't on the recall list), and at this point the recall issues are long resolved for us.<br /><br />To get back on topic, our furry friend crunches through the small handfuls of the T.o.t.W. product about as quickly as we give it to her.  Like most dogs, she has no concept of "full" and will eat whatever is put in front of her and then come back for more.  Normally it is probably more correct to say she inhales her food, though I do hear her crunching on each piece so I know she's at least chewing it up before swallowing it.  Trying out a different brand is something we do cautiously as making too drastic a change to the diet seems to wind up providing us a dog that is capable of some pretty nasty biological output of the very odoriferous type (how a smell that potent can be emitted by such a small dog, I don't have a clue, but whew!).  On the other hand though, we do like to offer the dog a variety of food so she can enjoy something different and not just be stuck eating the same old dry food again and again.<br /><br />This Chef Michael's food, a product from Purina, a pet food manufacturer I remember from many, many years ago (back in my youth), sold itself to me in the "Grilled Sirloin" name.  Meat in general seems to be a favorite of the family dog, but especially beef flavors, so it seemed an easy assumption that she'd like this product.  In that area, I wasn't wrong.  As I gave her a good sized handful of food in her bowl she pulled out a chunk and went off to the side where she went to work on chewing it up and savoring the taste a bit before she decided it was something she needed to go back to get more of.  Sure enough, that chunk was quickly enough swallowed up and the rest of the bowl was soon emptied.<br /><br />When I put the handful of food in the bowl I noticed that the food itself did seem to resemble pieces of meat.  Definitely not a dry kibble type food, but more along the lines of a moist meat product, perhaps along the side of say a stick of pepperoni or perhaps a Slim Jim (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004DT3VHS">Slim Jim Giant Slim Pepperoni, .97-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a>).  Or, perhaps more along the lines of something I'd expect to see in a beef stew.  In that area, well, lets just say that if there was a category for "visual" appeal on the part of the human, this product would get a decent score.  But, well, there's the question of just what is in the product and that is where I'd have to say I'm not as inclined to consider purchasing this product too often.<br /><br />This would seem to be a product that falls more on the lower (half) end of the quality scale when it comes to not being comprised of too many fillers and products that aren't as necessary in a dog's diet.  From past experience in researching what to feed the dog, I'd long ago learned that many of what I'd call lower quality foods are filled with, well, lots of fillers.  While dogs will eat it and not really care, they don't need those fillers and given that it isn't that much more expensive to buy higher quality products, I've tried to keep our pet on a diet that would hopefully be better for her in the longer term.<br /><br />As an occasional change of pace in our dog's diet, I think this would be an ok product.  Perhaps just as a "treat" every now and then, but I just don't see myself rushing out to get more bags of this product instead of the Taste of the Wild products, or other products that I tend to have a bit more respect for.

review/summary: Maggie Loves It!
review/text: It's dog food, so I really have to take Maggie's word for it.  She eats it, she doesn't seem to get tired of it, she even does a sort of doggie buffet where she grabs a mouthful, takes it a couple feet away from the bowl and puts down a line of the dog food then eats it.  I won't guarantee that your dog will do the buffet thing - she's a bit peculiar. Anyway, Maggie gives it 5 stars.

review/summary: Truly natural
review/text: I always read the ingredient labels on my food to avoid product preservatives like sodium benzoate.  Any food for my dog needs to meet the same standards.  Costco's Kirkland branded dog foods have met my budget needs as well as provided quality nourishment.  Was Chef Michael's quality enough for me to shell out twice the price?  No.  But then again, I'm cheap and I know it.<br /><br />I personally dont have a problem with grains and soy.  I grew up on the same ingredients in mom's cooking.  And if it's good enough foe me, it's good enough for my dog.  As long as my dogs likes the taste and receives the essential nutrients he needs, mission accomplished.

review/text: I generally don't give my dog food with corn or other grains because dogs are not supposed to eat them! I actually didn't realize that this food had corn until it arrived, I didn't read the list of ingredients carefully and since it wasn't the first ingredient, I was excited and quickly made the order.<br /><br />My dog usually eats high quality food - either all natural foods or home made meals consisting of raw meats and vegetables. She loved this food, and ate it right away. She doesn't do that with typical dog foods unless she's really hungry so I think she enjoyed the taste. 4 stars was because it has grains in it - AND SOY!!

review/text: Our dog loved this food.  He does like most food, but he really seemed to get excited about this stuff.  It was his first adult dog food after puppy food.  He actually seemed to get a bit thin on it at times, maybe because it doesn't pack down and I was feeding him a bit less than I thought I was.  His stool seemed very healthy while on this food.  It's a good product.

review/summary: A Nice Change of Pace.
review/text: Sometimes I feel sorry for our dogs having to eat the same kibble every day. We can tell that they also hate having the same stuff every day. One of the worst problems for a dog owner is getting them to eat once they become disenchanted with their fare. The problem s that once we lose them, they stay lost. But with this dry food they take an interest and dinnertime becomes competitive once agin as everyone tries to glom the kibble so as to deny the other a good meal. And we'd rather see that than watch them ignore their food altogether.

review/summary: Tasty, soft and crunchy, DOGGIE Approved
review/text: My dogs, a jack russell and chihuahua, like this dry food,  the jack russell loves eating most of the soft meaty bits first then eats the crunchy veggie bits.  The chihuahua prefers the soft meaty bits and will nibble on the crunchy veggie bits last.  I can also use both the soft and crunchy bits as training treats for the dogs.  Chef Michael's dog food also has a nice aroma, quite organic and does not smell arificial and funky like some dog food, just smells natural.  There is also a lot of natural and healthy ingredients with the food.  I would definitely buy this for my dogs again.

review/text: Despite the fancy gourmet name, it's generic dog food. Lots of fillers and average nutritional value. Chewy ate it, but for the premium price I would expect higher quality ingredients. As my vet likes to say, "How much corn do you think wolves eat in the wild?" All these grain fillers added to dog food have zero nutritional value for your pet and can lead to pet obesity and digestive problems. Better option is something like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P9XFWS">Blue Buffalo Healthy Weight Large Breed Dry Dog Food, Chicken and Rice Recipe, 30-Pound Bag</a> (But get it at your local pet shop for half the price Amazon is selling it for!)

review/summary: Better as a Treat
review/text: I know this dog food is supposedly healthy and packed full of nutrients, but I just can't shake the pet-owner's gut feeling that it's not necessarily the healthiest. It is though, a GREAT little "appetizer" that I add to the top of my dogs' regular food that gets them to start eating (they're both a little picky). They love the abundant chunks of meat and I think it adds a little variety to their meals. I will probably keep a bag on hand to add a little to their regular food as a way to encourage them to eat, since they obviously really, really like it (I caught one of my dogs with his head in the bag in the laundry room).

review/summary: Good
review/text: I'm not entirely sure if I can give an objective review for this product. Why? Well, unlike me, my dog is not a picky eater. He'll eat anything we give to him, including carrots and the occasional licking of a yogurt spoon. I think his voracious appetite was passed on to him by his predecessor, who once ate a pound of cheddar cheese my mother and I naively placed on our kitchen counter before going out to run a few errands.<br /><br />So for that reason, I don't think my review is going to be all that helpful for those considering buying this product. My dog was on another brand of dog chow, but we slowly began the transition from his food to this product. When James is usually fed breakfast, lunch, or dinner, he eats it pretty fast. But once he was fully on Chef Michael's dog chow, James inhaled his meals. I have never seen my dog eat his food so fast.<br /><br />So I guess it was a hit, after all!

review/summary: Looks Good Near the Top . .
review/text: . . .but when you get to the middle of the bag, all the larger pieces are gone and all you're left with are small pieces of dog food, even pebbles.  The food at the top of the bag contains larger, "fluffier" pieces of dog food that look very appetizing, and when these pieces fill our dogs dish, she eats the food rather quickly.  But as the bag is emptied and you get to the middle and bottom of the bag, all those larger pieces are gone and all that's left are small round pebble-like pieces of dog food, that my dog usually lets sit in her dish for a while.  Shaking up the bag, or mixing it up could help, but it would be nice to see an even consistency to the food, rather than having all the "good stuff" at the top, with crumbs and pebbles at the bottom.  I also don't think the food is very nutritious or filling, as our dog is always looking for more food or appears hungry after eating this. We seemed to go through the bag rather quickly, even though it was a large bag.  Perhaps this is meant to be mixed with regular dog food or only as an occasional "treat" and not part of a dogs regular diet.  In my opinion, it's not worth the extra cost if my dog doesnt appears satisfied after eating, which she rarely did with this food.

I scanned the ingredients and saw that, yeah, that may be true.  However, we live a very active lifestyle (to stay trim and slim) and this is a food that they devour nearly before the bowl hits the floor.  Amazing.  Pedigree?  Not so much.  Purina?  Nada.  Blue?  Yeah, right.<br />With Chef Michael's, I actually garnish their bowls with fresh steamed brocoli and they adore it.  Highly recommended as a food solution.

review/summary: Better than many other dog snacks,but still too many chemicals & filler
review/text: My dog loved it, and so did my cats! (They got into the bag when it first arrived)<br /><br />But then again, my dog eats bugs and sometimes his own poo... despite being a purebred, he's not exactly what I'd call a connoisseur.<br /><br />At first I was quite impressed with this latest development in processed foods - Chef Michael's sirloin bits really look like real steak, and it doesn't need to be refrigerated. However, the "realistic" shape & texture of the food isn't important to my dog, but the ingredients ARE important to me!<br /><br />This is better than most dry dog foods, with beef as the first ingredient. But it's also has too much corn & grain fillers, preservatives, & chemicals.<br /><br />So if you have a super finicky pet who won't eat the healthy stuff, this is super tasty and not as bad as most. However, I won't be buying it, as there are too many healthy & natural alternatives which my dog loves just as well (and for about the same price) ... Nutro, Newman's Own, and Nature's Variety, just to name a few.<br /><br />Hope this helps!

review/summary: Picky Dogs Like Chef Michael's
review/text: My two senior dogs are very picky eaters, they even turn down some treats! When dog food was tainted and recalled a few years ago I switched my male cockapoo and female cairn terrier to a fresh cooked diet from a pet "deli."  It is expensive and an hour from my home but they have remained on this diet because every time I tried to change back they went on hunger strikes.  I have been incoorporating Michael's dog food into their diets slowly over the past few weeks and they both have been eating every morsel.  These dogs hae been offered no less than six other brands of dog food in the past and usually they just walk away from their dishes. I finally told my family to remind me next time I complain about their food price that they will not switch and just bite the time and money bullet to keep them on the deli diet. I ordered a sample bag from the Vine review program and I am so happy to report the dog reviewers really like it. Just remember to introduce a new food gradually to ease the stress on any dog's digestive track.

review/text: This dog food has made my dog very happy.  I have been using a quality dog food before trying the Chef Michael's, and he liked it just fine, but would eat the chewy pieces first and sometimes the dry pieces would sit for a while before he would finally eat them.  With Chef Michael's dog food, he not only eats the chewy pieces, but also the crunchy potato and green bean kibble.  It even smells better than other dog foods and I feel pretty good about feeding him something he enjoys so much.<br /><br />Beef is the first ingredient listed, which is great, and unlike some dog foods where corn is the first ingredient, corn is the 7th ingredient listed.  Also listed as ingredients are 23 minerals and vitamins, including Vitamins E, B-12, and D, folic acid, niacin, calcium, manganese, potassium and lysine.  However, it also contains a few strange ingredients such as "animal digest", and it has a lot of "meals" and "flours" in it. I do not know if they are optimum for dogs or are just used as fillers.<br /><br />Pricewise, it compares nicely to Purina One and Beneful, which I have also fed my dog.

review/text: OK - So I haven't tasted this myself, and my dog can't type, so I can only go by my impressions of my dog's behavior.<br /><br />Ingredient-wise, it's nice to see that beef is number one, though one assumes that is only the red pieces. The others have ingredients some folks want to avoid in pet foods, but that's personal choice of course. I'd suggest closely reading the ingredient list to see if it suits your needs.<br /><br />As another reviewer said, there are a lot of calories in a serving, and that serving is only 28% protein: surprising if the first ingredient is meat, though understandable when you factor in the vegetable kibble. Again, these are all choices pet owners need to make for themselves.<br /><br />What it really comes down to in the end, assuming the issues above are acceptable, is how a dog likes it. In my case, our dog likes it quite a bit up to a point: she picks out the meaty bits and leaves the veggies behind. I suppose if we just left those bits there she'd eventually eat them, but that doesn't seem like a balanced way to feed her.<br /><br />So for us, obviously, this food simply won't work. What our dog eats she loves, but she avoids more than she enjoys.

And, this is a very big bag of dog food for two little dogs.  However, when I put it in their dish they started eating right away.  Because the pieces are rather large for small dogs, they can only eat one piece at a time.  The food seems to be a bit chewy, so it takes a while to eat one piece.  There's no real oder that I can smell, but because it doesn't smell like Pupa-roni they aren't fighting over it.

review/summary: Good dog food, but a bit pricey
review/text: If they're picky eaters dogs may care about the size, shape, texture, smell, and/or taste of a food; or, if they're like my dog, they care that it stays still long enough that they can gobble it down.  Owners should care about calorie content, that the food is intended for the proper age group (puppy, adult, or senior), and that the food is certified to meet the nutritional requirements set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). And, unless you are independently wealthy, price.<br /><br />Because my dog is not a picky eater, I can't comment on the taste of Chef Michael's. However, it is much higher in calories than a basic dog food such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005M16UG0">Pedigree Adult Complete Nutrition Small Crunchy Bites Original Beef Dry Dog Food, 30-Pound</a>, which means that a much smaller amount should be fed, something that she definitely objects to.<br /><br />There is one notable point about Chef Michael's-<br />All pet foods produced in the United States must meet certain minimal nutritional requirements, which are set by AAFCO. Somewhere on its bag or can each food will have a short statement saying that is has either been *formulated* to meet AAFCO standards, or has undergone *feeding trials* and been shown to meet AAFCO standards. AAFCO has set standards for 2 life stages; growth (i.e. puppies) and reproduction, and adult. (Senior is not recognized as a separate stage.) Because feeding trials are so expensive, such foods are usually formulated to meet the needs of *all life stages*. Growth and gestation/lactation have much higher nutritional requirements than a normal adult dog has. Therefore, such a food may not be ideal, particularly if you pet has a weight problem.  Foods that are *formulated* (i.e. do not undergo feeding tests), are more often designed to meet the needs of a specific life stage. Chef Michael's is the only pet food (dog or cat), that I have ever found that has undergone feeding trials AND is designed for a specific life stage.<br /><br />The importance of feeding trials, formulations, and life stages is debatable, and in the end is an individual decision.<br /><br />Finally, despite what some people claim, it is not possible to assess the quality of a food from the ingredient list. Ingredient descriptions, for example any listing of a meat product or by-product, are vague and there can be huge variation in the quality of a product with the same name from one food to another. In the same vein, claims that certain ingredients shouldn't be in dog food should be taken with a grain (or large jar) of salt. When chosing a food for your pet, talk to your vet, don't believe a stranger on the internet with unknown qualifications.<br /><br />As for me, although my dog enjoyed Chef Michael's, both the calorie content and price are too high to make it her normal dog food.

review/summary: My dogs love it!
review/text: I have two dogs, both Pomeranians. One is 16 and has no teeth, and the other is eight and an extremely picky eater. My older dog will eat just about anything, so it was no surprise to me that the minute I poured this into a bowl he beelined straight for it and tried to chow down. Only -- poor dog -- these pieces were too hard and too large for him.<br /><br />The picky eater, on the other hand, gave these a whiff and timidly tried a few bites. In my household, this is a success! It's a rare story for him to even try anything new we buy for him. We leave these out all day for the dogs to eat whenever they get hungry and I will spy the picky dog going for a nibble throughout the day.

review/summary: It's Canine Crack
review/text: Mickey, my toy poodle..who is overweight by the way, has been eating Beneful (healthy weight) not sure why, since he is as I stated overweight. I was trying to save this bag for when I ran out of the big bag I already have. I noticed that Mickey eats all of the soft pieces from his bowl, and leaves the others there until he is starving,so I thought why not try it out.<br /><br />Well he was excited by the bag itself..and it does look good enough for human consumption if you just look at the bag, so he probably thought it was real food, I don't think he caught the "Chef Michael" but maybe he did since he sometimes acts as if he can read. Anyway, he was jumping up and down and ready to eat.<br /><br />I only give him half a cup, but he munched it right up. Afterwards, I caught him going in the bag..which he never does, so I had to lock it up! This am, he was so ready to eat that he came straight in from his morning business..I didn't have to call him or hunt him down!<br /><br />I don't know if it's actually good for him..I don't read labels..sorry but from some of the other reviews..it ain't good for him! If Mickey were writing the review I think he would give it 10 stars..maybe his old food is boring. If you are concerned about the ingredients, you may want to pick another kind. Mickey is 8yrs old..so I treat him like a senior citizen and let him eat almost whatever he wants. :)

review/summary: The Chef is in, but is he cooking my dog "fast food?"
review/text: Tested on RUGER, 11 year old male neutered beagle type dog, 17 inches high and 25 pounds. Moderate activity level.<br />Slightly crazy, very lovable, goofy disposition, quite the momma's boy.<br /><br />Over a week I offered this food to my dog along side a bowl of his regular diet. His regular diet is Purina D/H mixed Loyall Lamb and Rice kibble.<br />He is a pretty predictable dog, and every day he chose to eat his D/H chunks out first, then a few kibbles of the Loyall, than he would eat a few bites of the Chef Michaels.<br />So, he did like it, and he did eat it.<br />There were a few things that drew my attention.<br />1. No where on the bag does it say where the ingredients are sourced. Is he eating American beef? Mexico?<br />Now, it doesn't say where his food is sourced on his D/H (Purina Dental Health) BUT, he loves that food SO MUCH and it keeps his teeth so nice I do continue to feed it to him. After all, I can't source where all the ingredients I EAT come from, so why should my dog eat better than I do? So, it isn't a major issue, but for those who really want to know, well, you will have to contact Purina.<br />2. The food felt FLUFFY and a bit greasy, and the red dyed beefy bits drifted with handling to the top. So, you have to shake before serving to get the kibbles to mix in a more uniform way before feeding. Otherwise, your dog gets a bowl of soft beefy bits and no kibble.<br />3. The kibble pieces did not seem crunchy enough to prevent tartar build up. Hummm. Perhaps after a long feeding diet of this your pet will NEED Purina D/H. I may be on to something here. I doubt this diet will do anything for dental health for your dog.<br />4. Why add artificial colors? Really? He doesn't even look at the food. At 11 years old, His sight may be questionable anyway and as a BEAGLE he doesn't look in the bowl before eating. He sniffs everything. To my dog, smell is everything. And for most dogs, I've never seen them eye each piece of kibble before chowing down. I seriously doubt dogs care if the potato bits are brown, the green bean kibbles are green, or the meat is red. Actually, after cooking, it should be brown as well. The colors can be left out, they are unnecessary. BUT, then again, as a kid who grew up on Kool-Aid, Mom enjoyed mixing up all those great colorful drinks for us, and we grew up fine (twitch twitch) but I state again, no sense in my dog eating better than me. (Now I want some red fruity punch just writing this)<br />5. Serving size is WAY too much. Each cup of this food has 270 calories. THAT IS A LOT! 28% protein and 16% fat. That is a bit more protein and fat than my guy is used to, so, it may be a bit "rich" for some dogs. ALSO, take notice, not all that protein is from those dried beefy looking chewy chunks. There are other sources of proteins in here, from Chicken by product meal, corn gluten, and soy. These are all sources of protein, but it may seem misleading if you think the protein is all from beef (which is, by the way, the number one ingredient)<br />6. The fat is "animal fat" so your guess is as good as mine. Emu? Llama? Pig? Sheep? Deer? Bison? Snake? Who knows, they should just label it "mystery fat" and I hope soylent green is not some of the green bits.<br /><br />I know, it sounds like I am knocking the food, and I really am not. It is DOG FOOD. My dog goes outside and eats rabbit poo, so I feel this bag of food is at least more nutritionally complete than rabbit poo.<br />And again, some of our human foods aren't much better, so I don't feel guilty feeding this to my dog while I enjoy a cool glass of Kool-Aid and chow down on some McDonald's Fries-- OCCASIONALLY.<br />In a perfect world, we would all eat nuts and berries, and fresh protein sources. If you want to feed your dog dog food you are pretty limited on types and styles. This is the junk food style dog food. I would give it occasionally as a treat (as I also do everything in moderation, I am not eating fries and KoolAid daily)<br />But I don't think I could feed this in good conscience to my dog daily, unless I added some FRESH raw meat and some pureed veggies, and probably I'd have to add something crunchy for dental health.<br /><br />This diet would probably be good for dog with rotten teeth already who find it too painful to eat regular foods and whose owners would rather put them on this instead of looking into their mouth problem.<br />Also, it would be good for picky eaters, whose owners would rather feed them this than find out why their dog's appetite is lacking.<br />This diet would also be good for training, you can take the bits out and use them as training treats. But take a rag, they leave a residue on your hands.

review/text: First of all, I really like this dog food because the first ingredient is real beef, not grains or gluten.<br />Second, the meat has a really interesting texture - like a cross between beef jerky and a puffed snack.  The vegetables are like regular dog kibble.<br />Third, my dog really loves this!  We have a 13 pound dog and the pieces aren't too big for him.  Usually he gets tired of his dog food after a while, but so far he still loves this food!  Unfortunately he keeps begging for it when it isn't time to eat, haha...<br />I would definitely order this food for our dog again.

review/summary: If you were broke, you might eat this stuff yourself!
review/text: I used to tell of the tales when I worked as a stock boy at a local grocery, and wondered about all the old people in the dog food aisle, looking at the better canned brands.  I remarked to one of the other stockers that old people must really love their dogs they are always buying the best stuff. I would never get anything beyond dry for my sisters cat.  They basically told me I didn't understand the situation, these people were on social security with no savings and could barely afford utilities.  They bought good dogfood cause they got it for themselves!<br /><br />Well that said, the gal Karine, that takes care of my poodle while I work in Chicago said that if she got to that bad in retirement, she would condsider eating this dog food, Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin. Because my poodle Sandy would pick it off the top of the bowl, she mixed it with the other dry food. Sandy stays in a large pen during part of the day, his food and water are there.  When Karine returned to walk Sandy, she noticed that the food was spread over one of the pads in the pen, and all the Chef Michael's stuff was picked out!<br /><br />The very top or the most prominant ingredient in this food was beef, and the stuff looks like it, and apparently the dog has judged it to be better than the average fare.  Smart dog, it looks pretty healthy too from the rest of the ingredients. I will likely buy this one, as a good suppliment to mix with the EVO I usually buy.

review/text: My dogs really seemed to like Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin dog food, judging by the way they gobbled it up.  The company that makes this has a come a looooong way in choosing the best ingredients with nutrition in mind.  Real meat is the first thing on the list of what it's made from, and they use a vitamin E preservative instead of BHA or BHT.  (I won't feed my dogs anything made with that crap)<br /><br />I was happily surprised with the high quality of this food, and I bought another bag for the pooches the other day.

review/summary: Neither the dog nor I cared much for this
review/text: I have a large mutt who is a fairly fussy eater. When I was offered the opportunity to review this dog food, I thought Buck was in for a treat from some fancy dog food - a nice change from the usual kibble. And, my first impression, when I opened the bag of dog food, was "Oh, this looks good."<br /><br />But, it was all downhill from there. First I looked on the bag to see how much I was supposed to feed my dog. One cup per 10 pounds. One cup per 10 pounds! That's 8 cups/day for my large dog. There's a lot of filler in this dog food. I feed 3 1/2 cups/day of my regular dog food.<br /><br />So, I thought maybe the Chef Michael's would be better used as a replacement for just a small portion of the regular food to give Buck a treat. Based on the appearance, I was sure it must taste good. Much to my surprise, my dog did not really care for this dog food. He didn't hate it and did eventually eat what I put out, but was not at all enthusiastic about it.

Zoe usually turns her nose up at anything other than her regular food, but not this time.  She dived in and did't stop until it was gone.  Not wanting to change completely, we mixed it with her life long food - Science Diet.  She picked out the Chef Michael's pieces and at them first.  It's softer than regular dry and I think she liked that, and it smell good, even to me.<br />There is a variety of shapes and we saved the bigger chunks to give her as a treat.  That's how much she loves this food.  My picky eater picked  Chef Michaels!  And at 15, she get anything she wants.

review/summary: A wonderful treat for your dog
review/text: If my dog could write this review, I'm pretty sure she would say "This is the best dog food EVER!".  Zoe is 7 years old and a very healthy eater.  She eats her food as soon as we put it down.  We normally feed her a dry, grain-free food because I think it's the most nutritious for her and the best for her teeth. We alternate between a turkey and sweet potato food and a salmon and sweet potato food. She eats it just fine.  But, let's face it, our dogs would rather be eating what we're eating. I think she thinks Chef Michael's is people food.  I've never seen her more enthusiastic about breakfast and dinner times.<br /><br />But, as her father, it's my job to make sure she's getting the best food for her.  I'm not 100% convinced Chef Michael's is it.  There is no consensus on whether grain is good for your dog. But, we've decided to go with foods that don't include grains.  Chef Michael's, #1 ingredient is beef.  So, that' good. But, that's followed by soy and then a whole host of grains.  So, if I had to guess, I would say this food is largely, if not mostly grains (if you add all the grains up together).  Ingredients are listed by the which is the most first in descending order.  But,  just because an ingredient is first  doesn't mean the others don't add up to more than it. The longer the list of ingredients, the more likely that is.  Just like with people food, I think generally, the shorter the list of ingredients the better (except for when you get into the added nutrients at the end- vitamins, minerals, etc.).  As for potatoes and green beans, those follow sirloin flavoring on the list of ingredients. Since sirloin flavoring is added, that probably indicates the beef isn't sirloin steak (I know you're shocked).  So, don't be lulled into thinking you're feeding your dog a sirloin, green bean and potato dinner here.  You're feeding her beef, grains and some bits probably colored and flavored to looks like green beans and potatoes.  Another thing about the food that your dog will probably love is it's semi-moist and semi-soft.  I think dogs prefer moist foods over dry.  We feed dry because I think it's better for her teeth. Also, when  you buy moist food, you are paying for water as opposed to nutritional ingredients.  This food only has about 15% less calories per cup than the food I feed my dog. But, the feeding instruction on the bag say to feed one cup for every 10 pounds of your dog's weight.  I don't know how much you feed your dog.  But, we feed our 70 pound lab-mixed breed a cup in the morning and a cup in the evening.  I cannot imagine feeding her 7 cups of any food per day.<br /><br />Personally, I wouldn't serve this to my dog every day for the reasons stated above.  But, I'm sure she'd love it if I did.  I think it's a great treat for her and maybe a little break from the boring dry food we feed her.  I don't think it would be a horrible choice for a long term food though.  For those reasons, I give it four stars.

When I saw Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin, I thought, yeah right, no way there's meat in there.<br /><br />It is more expensive than beneful, but my dog really, really likes this brand. I'm sure there are a gizzilion bad things in this, but if you add a bit of water, the meat pieces do get soft & has the consistency of wet dog food. It's not all meat, the filler pieces of green & yellow kibble are the same as beneful (vegatables & soy & fillers, etc - green beans - really???).<br /><br />This is a nice treat for our dog, she likes it almost as much as canned food, but this has the convenience of dry dog food.

review/summary: My Dogs Eat This Up
review/text: Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food claims to be more than your boring kibble and they are right.  The pieces come in a couple different shapes and sizes.  It has round crunchy kibble and more jagged shaped tender pieces (although the "tender pieces" started to get harder the less there is even though the "Best if Used By" is about a year and a half after I got the bag).  Of course the look and feel of the food does not mean anything if the dogs refuse to eat it, but both of my dogs dug right in right when I put their bowls in front of them.  The only problem I ran into was that one of my dogs is an elderly Chihuahua with many of his teeth taken out due to rotting who was slower to eat the bigger "tender pieces" and since it took him much longer to finish his dinner than my other dog, they sometimes would get in a growling match because my other dog would sit and try to finish off the bowl for the Chihuahua.

review/text: Here is one of those products that is marketed more to the consumer (human). It is almost as appetizing to the human food critic's eyes with both eye appeal and color of the food. With that being said... My dog liked this Purina dog food, by Chef Michael's, just fine. He finished the bag off completely, without discrimination. Honestly, he does this with just about any quality of food. I guess I got lucky that way. It is unfortunate that my dog does know what it's like to be hungry, thus he is less likely to be finicky.<br /><br />I do believe in healthy foods for my pet and not so much those filler ingredients. However, these foods can be supplemented in his diet by adding veggies and whole meats to any brand of dog food that is not fortified or primaried with such, and Purina is no exception.<br /><br />In addition to their bagged dog food, I like to give my dog a hearty beef rib once a week. This only costs an additional $10.00 for a rack of 8-12 hearty ribs. Not to shabby for a 2-3 month supply.<br /><br />As a consumer, I rely mostly on the marketing of what is in the packages ingredients list and trusting that Purina is using the ingredients of the highest quality in this and all of their products. And when they list beef as the first ingredient, that it is the primary ingredient and not made with the least amount. And down the near future, I do not hear about a recall on this pet food because it was tainted with... who knows what.<br /><br />As far as the dog food goes, it was liked by my pet and he did seem to enjoy it, that's what matters most. I truly hope it is benefical for him and that my pet gets a good nutritious meal out of it.

It's just weird; all these odd chunks of this and that, none of which looks natural. You know they're doing the odd ball manufacturing for doggie owners, not doggies, and that made me a little suspicious.<br /><br />My dog ate it all right (but then, my dog pretty much will eat pizza crusts she finds on street curbs.) Since she's been eating it, though, I've noticed she's droopy and draggy. I'd say that's cause of the weather, but I don't think so, since she's been inside since it got hot and muggy out.<br /><br />This doesn't mean that this food is to blame, but then again, nothing has changed in a past few weeks BUT this dog food.<br /><br />I won't be buying it.

review/summary: The family dog gives it 5-stars...so I'll go along with her
review/text: We recently changed our dog's normal food because she has gotten picky and no longer wants to eat the premium brand we've bought for several years.  We've tried several types thus far and she likes them all (who says dogs don't need variety in their food?).  Since the Chef Michael's was offered as part of the Amazon Vine program, I decided to give it a try.  The first day of trying Chef Michael's, as soon as I mixed it with her current food, she gobbled the whole bowl.  That's different for her.  She usually leaves some of her food so she can eat throughout the day.  As time has gone by, I've noticed she will dig through the bowl of mixed food and pick out the Chef Michael's pieces, eat them first and then nibble on the other brand in the bowl.  If she leaves any food in the bowl to come back and eat later in the day, it's always the other food, not Chef Michael's.<br /><br />Yes, the Chef Michael's food is expensive but it's not out of line with other the other premium dog foods we've been buying at the pet store.  As a matter of fact, it's considerably lower priced than some of them.  So price is not really a big factor in buying this dog food if you've been buying premium brands all along.<br /><br />The ingredients are consideration, however.  Some of the ingredients in the Chef Michael's is not exactly on the politically correct list for healthy eating.  For that reason, we will probably continue to follow our current procedure of mixing a little of the Chef Michael's with a larger quantity of another type of premium and better nutritionally balanced food.  Our pooch loves it and adding a little pizzazz to her meals brightens up her day.  That's worth a lot.<br /><br />If this review was based on nutritional value alone, I would probably give it 3 stars.  It's not really bad as far as nutrition is concerned but it's not as good as other foods within the same price range.  But I bow to the family dog whose opinion is paramount.

review/summary: picky eaters beware
review/text: fancy packaging, but same ol fillers used in most low priced dog food.  My small dog is not only picky, but upchucks most foods loaded with fillers, and this was no exception.  Some dogs can eat anything, other dogs have sensitive stomachs and picky pallets, so not an easy product to review... but if my dog could write reviews, it would be a "pass" in his book...

review/summary: Dogs loved it
review/text: This Chef Michael's grilled sirloin flavor went over well with the dogs, while both are older the lapdog has a hard time with some dry foods, he was able to chew through this. I like to change dog foods often to avoid a build up of any one ingredient or vitamin, some dog foods give the dogs loose stool, but we had no problems with this. First ingredient is beef, soy, animal fat, brewers rice, corn coming far down the list which is something I prefer, we will buy this dog food again.

review/summary: who is Chef Michael?
review/text: Apparently Chef Michael is not a real person, it is supposed to reflect the care Purina put into it's ingredients.  Looking at the food, it is not much different looking than Beneful. It has pieces of "tender" sirloin, which is tender by dog good standards.  It also has pieces of "potato and green bean" kibble.  Sounds like they are eating better than I do.  Looking closer at the ingredients there is a lot of soybean meal, ground corn, and corn by-products.  It contains 28% proteins, which is a lot higher than Kibbles N Bits and slightly more than Beneful.  However, the price is also higher.  I don't think the higher price is really worth it.  If you are concerned about what your dog eats, you are going to want to find a product with real ingredients and less filler.  I have had dogs for years and am not terribly concerned about it, so I stick with Beneful.  It is the most nutritious in the affordable price range.

review/summary: My dog loves this but.....
review/text: I'm not sure I do.  Her normal dog food is Iam's Healthy Naturals with wholesome chicken.<br />When I first put this in her bowl, she scarfed down those red dye-colored beef pieces first.  Later she did eat the potato and green bean kibbles.<br />I compared the first 10 ingredients to Iam's and also compared price per pound and Iam's is actually cheaper.  A bag of Iam's this size would cost only  $7.29.<br />I don't like soy nor do I like gluten which this contains and it also has added dyes.  Iam's has no artificial preservatives and has enough vitamins and minerals to actually list them in the Guaranteed Analysis list.  I feel the vitamins and minerals are important.  Chef's Michael's says it has 23 essential vitamins and minerals in there somewhere but not enough to list, I guess.<br />Chef Michael's contains green beans and potatoes and Iam's has tomatoes, peas, brewer's yeast, flax meal, dried apple pomace and spinach and whole grain sorghum and barley, although I don't like grains either.  How many dogs have you seen out chewing on wheat or barley in a field...lol<br /><br />So much to my dog's chagrin, I'll not be buying this dog food in the future.

review/summary: Dog Tested
review/text: I have two large dogs and a relative budget.  So this maybe terrible of me, but I don't mind a little filler.  And my dogs are healthy and active (even the senior) and they've been fed on easily accessible and relatively affordable brands all of their lives.  Though there are some questionable ingredients in Chef Michaels, and some known fillers, the number one ingredient is beef and this flavor also includes filet mignon flavors, green beans and potatoes. I should say it's a pretty small bag for the cost, so over the long term this may cost twice as much. However, they really did seem to enjoy it.  I would purchase this again.

review/summary: Three dogs: two didn't like it, one loved it
review/text: Firstly, let me start by saying all three of my dogs love Chef Michael canned food.  So I was surprised that I didn't have a better result with CM dry food.<br /><br />This CM dry dog food looks appealing to the eye (my eye), with what looks like vegetables and 'jerky' meat bits, but there's something about the taste or the smell that doesn't appeal to two of my three dogs.  Admittedly, both those are somewhat fussy eaters.  I was able to coax one of these to eat the dry crunchy bits, but she refused to eat the softer 'meaty' parts paws down.  The third dog seems to enjoy all of it just fine, which is the reason for my 3-star (average) rating.<br /><br />One thing I noticed was that the bag was as large as an 8lb bag of dry kibble, but only half the weight.  I guess all those soft and fluffy meaty bits are to blame for that.<br /><br />Overall, it's hit and miss in our house.  3-average stars.

review/summary: Chef Michael's dog food - a hit at this dog house
review/text: Our 2 dogs tried Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Steak Flavor dog food, made with real beef.  One is a Basset and one a smaller Terrier.  Both ate without any hesitation.  The food is colorful (for the human appeal) with crunchy kibbles as well as tender pieces.  I prefer to feed our dogs crunchy kibbles if they are able to eat it, because I think it keeps their teeth cleaner.  There seemed to be more large tender pieces than crunchy, but the dogs loved it all.  The food size was fine for both the large dog and the small dog.  The large dog transitioned from her regular food to Chef's with no trouble.  The smaller dog had some digestive issues for a few days (very soft stools) until that cleared up and she was fine.  The bag claims "23 essential vitamins & minerals" and a "well rounded meal for adult dogs".<br /><br />One nice packaging plus was the bag shows the actual size pieces of food, something helpful to me with 2 different sized dogs.  Overall, I could say the food was a hit at this dog house.

review/summary: Great on taste
review/text: This is a rather expensive dog food for those of us who have XXL dogs. It doesn't come in 20-40 pound bags, so buying 4.5 pounds for that will last maybe four days isn't cost effective. I decided to try this via the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />First I will say my dog loved it. She snarfed it right down and then looked at me like "Mom, MORE MORE MORE." However, the dog food itself is heavy on soy, animal fat and corn products. Will I buy it again? Yes! However, that said, I do generally feed my dogs a high quality expensive kibble with some raw food thrown in. I will use Chef Michael's in a mixture of the high quality/expensive kibble and the raw. Due to the smaller sized bags and the high soy and corn content, I would not feed this as the only kibble.<br /><br />My dog, however, would love for this to be her only food!

review/summary: Great for Kong stuffing
review/text: My dog really loved the taste of this food.  It has meat chunks mixed with kibble, although the meat looks a bit like pink play-dough.  I've found it to be a perfect treat to stuff inside her Kong to keep her busy, since it is tasty and attractive but not messy and won't stick to the inside of the kong. I wouldn't use it personally as her main food however since corn and soy and corn and soy products are at the top of the ingredient list.  (Although meat is the first ingredient which is a plus, since many commercial pet food has corn or soy as the number one ingredient).  However, since pretty much all US grown soy and corn is GMO, I try to limit that in pet foods that I use as the main food for my pets.  Dogs are omnivores, however they are not intended to eat a majority of their food as grain so always avoid foods with corn as number one ingredient.  This seems like a higher end commercial brand, but nutritionally there are much, much better options (Innova, Solid Gold).  As a treat, however, I think this is a great product and probably less fat and junk than most dog "treat" products.

review/summary: My Dogs Loved It...
review/text: My dogs are always begging for table scrapes.  As we all know that own dogs it is not good to give in to them.  We have many dogs and as I said they are not crazy about any dog food that we offer them. I keep telling them they are not people, but they just don't seem to get the hint. I brought the bag of Chef Michael's food into the kitchen and opened it up, to my surprise I had 5 dogs around me within minutes. How could they smell food that fast? Amazing.  I put a cup full in each of their dishes and set it down for them. Before I had the last dish down the dogs had finished the first ones. What?  My dogs hate dry dog food, what were they doing eating this?  I decided to do a little experiment and put down some of their regular food and some of Chef Michael's, side by side.  They all tried to get chef Michaels and totally ignored their regular dog food. I put it up and decided I'd try again the next day knowing sometimes they gobble up something the first time just because its new.  The next day I did the same thing and again they all charged for Chef Michael's food.  There you have it. My dogs loved it, and since it is dog food they have the final say.

review/summary: Nice for a change or "treat"
review/text: Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin was a very nice, tasty change that our dog absolutely loved.<br /><br />He has been eating grain free Taste Of The Wild for a few months. He picks at it, and eats what he needs to, I guess, but he never "gobbles it up."  I never get the impression that he eats it and likes it - it is more like he eats it because he knows it's his food and he has to eat. He would always be really impatient, licking his lips and sitting by my feet at the stove,  when I cook dinner because he so much looked forward to his steak, pork chop or chicken breast. (Yes, I cook a fat trimmed meat serving especially for him, without seasonings, etc, and he eats dinner when we do. His food bowl is always filled as well though and he can graze as he pleases. Alot of people think this is bad, but as long as he is as healthy and muscular as he is, the vet said we are doing fine for him.)<br /><br />Moving onto the new stuff...I filled his dish with the Chef Michael's and he really went right into it and cleaned the bowl. It looks and smells like it would be tasty/appealing to a dog. It certainly looks more appetizing than the other food that is all one shape and size. It definitely has a meaty (although processed/artificial) smell.<br /><br />There is no doubt that he thoroughly loved every bit of it. He was excitied from the moment he sniffed at it as I poured it in his bowl. He sat there wagging his tail and licking his chops as I filled the container to his automatic feeding bowl - he knows he has to "wait" and keep his nose out of the bowl as I fill it. I could tell he was happy and excited to try something yummy and new. For the few days this bag lasted, he wasn't as anxious when he knew I was cooking dinner. This dog food must have satisfied his taste buds much better than the Taste Of The Wild.<br /><br />I do think it is more of a "treat" or junk food though and not something that I would buy continuously and feed exclusively. It is fairly pricy and the nutrition content is not totally on par with what I like for him. I mean, it's not absolutely terrible nutrition-wise, but it isn't the healthiest either. It does have some fillers, but I have seen much, much worse on the market. This at least has actual meat as the first ingredient.<br /><br />I plan to buy these smaller 4.5 bags occasionaly and add a handful or so into his regular food once a day or every few days, for a little extra flavor or treat. Taste Of the Wild is good for him, but it really doesn't seem as appealing as something like this Chef Michael's. We all like a little junk/fast food every now and then and I imagine our dog does as well. This 4.5lb bag lasted him about 3.5 days while he ate it exclusively. It just seems like this would be pretty expensive to feed as his regular food. If it was totally nutritious and healthy for him, I wouldn't mind the cost. Plus, I could definitely see a pet overeating it just because it (apparently) tastes so good and/or because it would provide empty calories and he would end up hungry more often/sooner between meals - just like when people eat fast/junk food.<br /><br />Overall, I give it a good 4 stars. I knocked the one star off for the cost/nutrition ratio.

review/summary: Hey, It's Great Dog Food
review/text: Boy, am I so tired of reading reviews bemoaning the ingredients in dog food these days.  All the whiners claim that such-and-such is too corm or soy heavy, or that it is not gluten free or some other such crap.  Guess what...It's DOG FOOD! For the love of all that is holy would you tools quit your whine-fest and go away!  For the record, this product did exactly what it was supposed to do.  Do you know what that is?  It fed my dogs.  Furthermore, they all seemed to enjoy it and have not shown any ill effects or digestive ailments (Not a single degree higher on the dog-fart scale, so I am happy).  Sure our dogs are our babies, but the same people who cry about dog food ingredients are the same ones who took the score out of childrens' sports and think everyone is a winner.  Total and complete imbeciles.  Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food will always be welcome in my home.  Our pets are only given a short time with us on this planet, so why not let them enjoy their little lives to the fullest.  Give them what they want.  If this dog food makes them wag their happy little tails, then have at it.  I found this to be a great product and I hope you do to.  The naysayers need to get a grip on reality or just raise children instead.  They don't deserve dogs!  Highly Recommended!

review/summary: Good mixer but not as the primary food for my dogs
review/text: Like many folks here, I, too, got a sample 4.5 pound bag of Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food. I've always thought that dogs must get tired of the same old foods, and I try to mix up what we feed ours. So I have been adding a handful of Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food to augment their daily rations of Nutramax or Iams, and the dogs like this stuff. I cannot see any harm to offering some variety, especially when one considers that this species will happily snack on found foods such as road kill, sacks of fast food remnants, and whatever one leaves within reach on the counters when possible.<br /><br />I do think it is quite silly for Purina to blather on about crafting recipes and claim that they have the key to what dogs love to see, smell, or taste. The needless addition of food dyes to this food ticks me off, proving that Purina is pandering to people, not pooches.<br /><br />And the marketing hyperbole "All thoughtfully prepared, so it can be thoughtfully served" is nearly enough to send me into a fit of laughter as I thoughtfully grab a handful and throw in with the rest of the dogs' food before adding a bit of cheese, leftover chicken, or even pasta to the mix.<br /><br />I think this food is a good mixer, but I will not use it as the primary food for my dogs. Purina, get rid of some of the fillers and dyes, and I will give you another star in my rating. As is, this stuff is OK as a flavor enhancer, and I will likely buy a bag of it whenever I find it on sale.  (Hasn't the cost of dog food gotten totally out of hand recently? In part, I suspect, this gouging is because of the money spent devising silly descriptions for the foods such as Purina's efforts for this product.)

review/summary: Not particularly healthy, but my dogs loved it
review/text: Chef Michael's includes a number of filler ingredients, which are a big no-no among today's pet-savvy folks. And, in general, my two dogs eat organic kibble, which is a bit more pricey, but they end up eating less, so it all works out.<br /><br />However, giving them a bit of this food on occasion as a variation can't hurt. They did seem to enjoy it, zooming right into the bowl the very moment I first poured it in, scarcely even giving it a questioning sniff before devouring every bit.<br /><br />One of my peeves with this product is the packaging - unlike many other bagged dog foods these days, there is no ziplock top! So, after you've opened the bag, you either have to find a large plastic container to pour it into, or else fold it over and use a chip clip, which is less than ideal. The folks at Purina may want to look into this, since they do have a ziplock seal for Beneful and some of their other foods.

review/summary: Junk food
review/text: I ordered this without first reading the ingredients--was suckered in by the name and the packaging when looking at amazon's vine program offerings last month.<br />As a compulsive label reader and nutrition researcher this was completely my bad and I own it.<br />That said, this is one of the more expensive "junk foods" for dogs that I have seen lately.  While it may have beef as the first ingredient, when you factor in all the remaining negative ingredients there is simply no way to offset the good with the bad.  Other reviews have gone into great detail on the ingredients and their negative impact on your pet's health so I'm not going to repeat that.  Just chiming in!<br />It frustrates me when people say they can't afford to feed their families or pets good quality, nutritious food (as opposed to factory produced calories packaged in grocery stores and served in restaurants).<br />When you factor in the cost to your health and the fact that you are nutritionally starving yourself (or your family/pets) the cost for good food (and I mean FOOD, not calories) is actually less expensive.<br />Off the soapbox...

review/text: My older dog loved this dog food, maybe because it is soft and easy to chew. My "puppy" scarfed it down, but she had bad runs afterward (though to be fair, I have heard that anytime you switch up your dog's food that can happen).<br /><br />I researched this dog food at Dog Food Advisor. They analyzed the ingredients in Chef Michael's, concluding that it uses soybean meal, soy protein concentrate and corn gluten meal to boost the protein content, and that it likely only has a modest amount of meat. They do not recommend it. Based on my experience, that is good advice.

review/summary: It's The Talk Of The Dog House!
review/text: This was a big hit at the kennel that masquerades as our home.<br /><br />Here's some background on the test subjects:<br />We have 3 dogs (basset hound, black lab, rottweiler) that vary in size from 50 to 75 pounds.<br />They go through a 15.5 lbs of Beneful Healthy Weight dog food every week at a cost of about $15.<br />The basset and rotty eat everything in sight. The black lab is a very finicky eater.<br /><br />With that in mind, here's my review:<br /><br />Chef Michael's food is chewier, the meat bits anyway, than the dry food that we use.  The dogs love that and they scoffed it up, even finicky Ashley.<br /><br />It's pieces are also smaller in size which they apparently like because they eat it much faster.<br /><br />Based on our dogs eating habits, we would need about 3.5 bags of Chef Michael's awesome food per week.  This would cost about $35, an increase of $20 per week to feed the hounds.<br /><br />It's a great product. However, if money is a factor, I would recommend it for owners that have 1 small to medium size dog.<br /><br />Also, if you're going to pay that much, the bag should be resealable.  This and the cost is what made me knock it down to 4 stars.<br /><br />UPDATE: 8/28  While this food is expensive, it turns out that my one dog Ashley after eating this wont eat the other food that we usually have to doctor with parm cheese and bread crumbs. We gave up and bought another bag today.  Ashley ate it right up.  We have decided to feed Ashley this and the other dogs can eat the Beneficial.  We paid 2.00 more at the grocery store for this food so we ordered to more bags via Amazon.  For a picky eater it is worth it.

review/summary: Perhaps the dog must be the one who decides?
review/text: This is a challenging review because it is a product for an important member of the family, our 13 year old dog.<br /> As she has aged, she has come to prefer moist canned food and we balance it with dry to help her teeth, breath and overall diet.<br /><br />I find I agree that " Chef Michael's Sirloin Steak" product does appear to be candy-like  for dogs. The product, while seemingly liked, does seem to be varied in overall value when one looks at the total  ingredients.  A product called " Chef Michael's Sirloin Steak" does sound balanced, but the bag content shows a large amount of soy and corn and by-products.  Other reviewers have commented on the specifics of what many of those by-products actually contain, and it gives one pause.<br /><br />I do wonder why the product has "added colors" as I was always told dogs were color blind, which implies a marketing spin rather than a quality perspective. One must understand the spin to the ones who make the actual purchase.<br /><br />The positives:  dogs seem to like the product and beef (as contrasted with fillers and by products) is listed as the #1 ingredient<br /><br />The negatives:  the supplementary fillers, a less than great aroma and the cost at $2.20+ per pound makes one need to evaluate<br /><br />Dr. John Hogan CHA CHE CMHS<br />HospitalityEducators<br />Hogan Hospitality

review/summary: A Joy To Watch My Dog Enjoy His Food
review/text: My Jack Russell Terrier has always been a grazer.  No chugging down food for him.  We feed him twice a day, a.m. and p.m. and the food goes slowly when he's hungry throughout the day and evening. We've been giving him a dry organic kibble mixed with a wet organic canned food.  He likes it well enough but I don't think he gets much pleasure from eating.<br /><br />I decided to try the Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food. What a surprise.  My dog, Sky, went to town and ate it all at once.  I was a little nervous that his digestive system would be upset but he's as good as new.  No upsets.  What is really nice is that he enjoys eating his food.  It's there and gone quickly.  He savors his food and eats it in one sitting.  It's nice to see that.  I will be using this dog food in the future.  If Sky could talk, he would thank Vine and Purina for the opportunity of trying this dog food.<br /><br />By the way, I switched all at once from one diet to the other and there were no repercussions.

review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: I'm always a little challenged to review something my dogs eat, but in this case, my dogs have enthusiastically communicated that they enjoyed this product.  So as far as taste goes, this is a winner.<br /><br />But what about nutrition?  Most of the leading ingredients are proteins, which puts this in a different category of quality from the more corn based dog foods (this still does have corn and rice, but they seem to be about a fifth of the content).  Much of the protein is from soy instead of animals.  It's also been dyed, which doesn't seem necessary to me.  It looks pleasing to people, but there's not much reason to give a dog colored food.  But in my opinion, a dog can be healthy eating this as long as it's part of a balanced diet.<br /><br />I would add veggies and actual meat from my own dinners to my dog's diet.  I tend to give them both at least a serving every day, but then they eat some kind of normal dog food for the majority of their diet.  This approach has led to my dogs being healthy and living long lives.<br /><br />There are more expensive and healthier dog foods, but Chef Michael's dog food is a healthier and apparently tastier alternative to the other grocery store brands.

review/summary: Dogs Love It......A Little Pricey
review/text: I have to admit up front that I don't own a dog.  But my fianc&eacute;e and my neighbor do. A Golden Retriever and a Datsun respectively.  Both of them are fussy about what their dogs eat, but not what I would call fanatical.  Both of them also agreed that this dog food is very far from the worse that they have tried as far as quality goes.  But at the same time for the price they are suggesting the nutritional value could be much better.  As for the dogs review, there is no question that they both loved it.  Not only did they both savor it fully, but there were no side effects noted in either dog as to gas, bloating, belly aches, etc.  My conclusion based on their reviews and remarks is that this is a medium to very good quality dog food that carries a premium price.  But also one that both dogs in the tests here seem to gobble up enthusiastically.  My suggestion would be to perhaps buy this for a delicious treat for your dog, and pick up something else a little more reasonably priced for their everyday diet... : )

review/text: My dogs LOVE this food. In fact, if I fill their bowls with it, they won't stop eating until it is gone. So I have started putting a little bit on top of their regular food, Wellness, as a little treat. They can't get enough of it! They actually make a complete mess digging through the bowl of regular food to find the Chef Michael's food, spilling their food everywhere! They think this food is better than the actual treats I give them.<br /><br />It also looks good. Kibble is usually these nondescript little balls of unidentifiable substance, but Chef Michael's LOOKS like real food! My dogs are picky about their kibble, but they certainly love this stuff!!

review/summary: Sirloin yes, potato-and-green-bean, not so much
review/text: I have two maltese dogs, a male who is 13 and a female who is 11.  The female will eat nearly anything that doesn't try to eat her first.  The male will hardly eat at all unless you beg him.  Both of them liked the grilled sirloin part pretty well.  The "potato and green bean garnish" part tended to stay in the bowl a while, though my little girl would eventually eat that, too, usually.  Dogs are not fans of veggies of any kind and so I was not surprised.  But overall, they liked it pretty well, which is saying a lot for what is mostly a dry dog food.  I have not seen this in the store where I buy my dog food.  When it does (and if it does) the price will determine for me whether I'll start buying this brand or stay with the brand I was already using.  I think my dogs liked this enough that I'd be willing to switch, but only if the price was the same or not much more.

review/summary: It's OK for kibble
review/text: The first ingredient is, indeed, BEEF. Following that is soy this, soy that, cereal this and that, preserved animal fat, animal digest (another name for poop?), etc.<br /><br />The first time I served it to my dogs they totally ignored their Pedigree Chicken and Rice Dinner (canned food) and focused on this product, which surprised me since they normally ignore all forms of dry dog food. Within two days they were digging through the kibble to get to the soft chunks (not sure what they are made of, but I wouldn't eat 'em). By day 4 they ignored everything, including their wet food. I kept a fresh bowl of this down every day since just to see if they'd get interested, but as of day 7 they are still ignoring it. At least now they're back to eating their other food.<br /><br />It's possible that this product was messing up their digestion, and the package clearly warns that it should be introduced slowly. Unfortunately I can't get my dogs to keep from digging through what they're served in order to get to what they want to eat, then leave the rest.<br /><br />Lots of bad reviews indicate the ingredients are bad, but my dogs won't get near food like Science Diet. Just how 'good' does dry food need to be for a canine? They're not humans and have a completely different digestive system. For the average dog, whose ancestors ate raw meat from the weakest animal in the herd, rodents, and less than fresh leftovers off the ground, this product should work well. But today I'm still searching for a dog food that my finicky ShitZu and Poodle will eat. Unfortunately this product was not the answer to my feeding dilemma.

review/text: Take a celebrity chef, "gourmet" dog food that looks almost tasty enough (resembles homemade stew) for humans to eat; add some zesty advertising (i.e., "Whenever Chef Michael cooked at home, Bailey would dance in anticipation at his feet, her tail madly wagging"), and, no bones about it, I just had to get some of Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food for my finicky toy poodle Crouton.<br /><br />I couldn't wait for Crouton to ... to ... one sniff and ... leave it to those nose-in-the-air poodles ... another breakfast ready to go to the cats; that is, until the cats actually try and eat doggie's morning chow ... dog-centered Crouton reluctantly eats at least half of the meal - anything so the cats can't wedge too much into his nibbles.<br /><br />So much for the allure of appearance, this certainly helps pad the cost of this pricey product.  I mean, smart as he is, would Crouton notice the meaty bits sprinkled with potatoes and peas in his dish? ... Come on, if the food was real steak, you could color it green and doggie's bowl would be clean lickety-split.<br /><br />Then, upon further investigation, the dog food ingredients translate into an overdose of soy and some questionable by-products.  I've crossed this Purina product off my future shopping list and, thus, left Chef's Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food "in the doghouse."<br /><br />Stacy Lytwyn, Marketing Guru/Motivational Speaker/Journalist<br />Author: CONSUMMATE CONNECTICUT: DAY TRIPS WITH PANACHE

review/summary: The finicky dog was not impressed
review/text: I have two dogs--a Weimaraner who eats anything, including sticks, and an old German Shepherd who has always been picky and grows more so in her 13th year. I have fed them Pro Plan Chicken and Rice on the recommendation of several dog people, to generally good results (a 13.5 year old German Shepherd!). I frequently need to doctor up the Shepherd's morning food--sometimes I use dessicated liver, sometimes pork rinds, so I thought this sounded like a healthy way to spark some appetite.<br /><br />Well, no. She eventually ate it, but not any faster than if I hadn't fixed it up. It doesn't smell particularly like "Grilled Sirloin"--just like any softer serve dog food. It's a mix of kibble and semi-soft bits that look kind of like shredded pot roast. The Weim loved it, but then she eats mulch, too.<br /><br />Your mileage may vary, but my tester dog was not impressed.

review/summary: A Unique Looking Dog Food
review/text: I have to state up front that my dog is a very picky eater, so judging any kind of food with him is tricky.  The first thing I noticed is that the bag I received was not resealable.  The scissor cut line is below what looked like a zipper line, but the bag did not open until I cut below it.  The food itself is very different looking and smells very nice, as far as dog food goes.  My dog initially turned his nose up at it, but went back to eating virtually everything put in his bowl within a few hours.  That's more than he will for almost every dry dog food I've tried with him.  Most likely, I will try another bag of Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dog Food in the future.

review/summary: Gourmet dog food for sure.
review/text: My dog is not the most persnickety dog I've ever met; she eats raccoon poop sometimes, but then again she won't eat just anything--won't touch half the veggie food that I serve at the table.  But this food, she loves.  She usually eats most dog foods just until she's full and then leaves the rest for later.  But this food she eats like a kid eats candy.  I think she would eat the whole bag if I let her.<br /><br />The food pieces are moist and tender, not as moist as canned food, but not crunchy like other dry dog food.  There are little pieces that look like meat, but when you look closely you can tell it's some sort of conglomerate food, sort of like a chicken nugget idea.  There's obviously food coloring in here-- the pieces are different pretty colors.  How do dogs do with red 40?  She seems fine after eating one dose anyway.<br /><br />Okay, personal problem here... is it ethical to be eating a vegan diet myself and be serving sirloin beef to my dog?  I can justify serving the dog the leftover meat stuff that probably wouldn't be used for anything else and would probably be thrown away otherwise.  But to kill one mammal to feed another?  Even if she is my best buddy, that bothers me.  She likes it.  So, whatever, I'll think this over and see if I keep buying it.

review/summary: Nice balance of food, vitamins and minerals
review/text: This is good stuff for our paunchy pug! For a while our dog, Ruby, wasn't eating hard food, due to problems with her teeth, but now that she's able to again, Chef Michael's by Purina� seems to suit our canine just fine. In fact, she eats it with gusto (like most everything else!). This blend smells like normal dog food but is more varied than the typical stuff we give Ruby. It's got the "grilled sirloin steak flavor," which she's used to, but the "potato and green bean garnishes" are something different -- and I think she likes the added taste. The kibble colors are an interesting mix of bacon-looking brown, light brown and green (which I assume is the green bean portion).<br /><br />I get the feeling that Purina� puts a lot of effort and sincerity into its products, and I like the fact that there are 23 crucial minerals and vitamins to enhance Ruby's health. The food is a mix of "tender pieces" and "crunchy kibbles," which again provides some diversity compared to what our dog is usually fed.<br /><br />Authentic beef, protein, veggies and important nutrients -- what else could your lovable pooch want in a meal? Well, except for your table scraps, of course!

I even tried mixing Science Diet with other dog foods and she would spit the Science Diet pieces out. Also, a former dog of mine ate Chef Michael's on a regular basis but not this flavor. She liked chicken and filet minion. I would suggest those flavors over this one.

The food looks and smells appetizing.  The drawbacks are that the cost is fairly high, it has very questionable ingredients including poultry by-product meal and animal digest, and it is soft, thereby of little use in cleaning their teeth.  I will probably not continue with this food.  Instead, there are truly dry foods, with at least as good ingredients, that cost less and that will help with their teeth.  For treats, I'll continue with regular treats (Milkbone for example) or canned food.  This food might work for some picky small dogs.

review/summary: my dog inhaled it
review/text: If my 46-lb. Golden Retriever puppy is any indication, this food tastes wonderful to dogs! She sniffed her bowl cautiously the first time we fed it to her, then eagerly wolfed it down and practically licked the bowl clean.<br /><br />Since I don't plan to taste it myself, I can't say much about the flavor.  The appearance is more attractive than most dry dog foods, with bits of vegetables and meats mixed together, rather than monotone brown bits that other dry foods have. Puppy doesn't particularly care what it looks like, of course.<br /><br />I feel foolish even writing it, but I will say this... since we're still in the puppy phase, she still has some accidents in the house.  While we were feeding her Chef Michael's food, we noticed that there was none of the normal foul odor normally associated with her bowel movements... we only discovered that she had gone by visually spotting the accident.  I don't know exactly what that means, but my guess is that this food is providing better nutrition than our prior brand.<br /><br />We're just about ready (per the Vet's instructions) to switch our puppy over to adult food.  Chef Michael's is definitely one we will consider!

review/text: I got this dry food for my Labrador who has a bad pancreas.  When I read the loving description I expected a more wholesome product with better ingredients.  I specifically hoped for a food with less animal fat.  According to the vet, our dog should not have more than 12% fat in his diet.  Of course, this is our issue, not everyone else's.  Let me provide you with the top five ingredients listed:  Beef, soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat, brewers rice.<br /><br />Label Facts:<br />Crude Protein:  28%<br />Crude Fiber:  3.0%<br />Crude Fat:  16.0%<br />Moisture:  12%<br /><br />All the pieces are the size of a pea except for the "tender pieces" which are not quite as large as a quarter.  Frankly, they feel spongy and are very dry.<br /><br />The bag, although made of a sturdy plastic is not sealable.<br /><br />Hope my review provided you with the information you were looking for.

To be honest, it isn't likely that we ever would have tried this product if I hadn't been sent a sample package for review.<br /><br />Our dog is an 80 pound mixed Sharpei and Great Dane, and Chef Michael seems to be targeted more to smaller dogs; we would have to give our dog about eight cups a day, and that would get to be a much more costly proposition than his regular dry dog food, a generic brand (which we've lately started mixing with Purina Beneful, which I've reviewed separately).<br /><br />Chef Michael claims to have sirloin steak flavor with potato and green bean accompaniments. In fact, it is 26% beef, and the other items are there, but the mix contains quite a bit of filler. I just don't see the need to feed the dog much in the way of filler, or for that matter to pay for it.<br /><br />Certainly, the dog loves it and it serves (for us) as a great treat item rather than a mainstay of his diet. If you have a smaller dog, and don't mind the higher cost, this could be a regular meal item.<br /><br />But a lot of the makeup of the product seems pitched to a human taste. The beef pieces, which are processed meat, are made up to look like little pieces of steak, complete with grill marks. That's nice, but do you think your dog will notice? Will your dog recognize the potato and green bean accompaniments as he's enjoying his meal? Our dog, frankly, just eats it. He loves it but I doubt that it's because there are faux grill marks on the beef pieces.<br /><br />A comment on the packaging: it would have been nice if the package was resealable. And whoever came up with the photo on the front of the package really needs to go into another line of work. It makes the product look incredibly unappealing.<br /><br />My bottom line is that this is a nice but ultimately unnecessary product. If you want to move up from generic dry dog food, try something like Purina Beneful instead. It's less expensive, less pretentious, and the dog eats it just as eagerly.

review/text: Our two dogs are not very picky eaters but when we first put this in their dishes they didn't stop until the bowls were empty; they even went to check each others bowls out to make sure they were empty. I read the ingredients list and was not too happy that there was so much "other" materials in the food.

review/summary: Actually Smells Like Steak
review/text: I don't know about you but my husband was really impressed with the smell.  But I checked it and it does smell like steak.<br /><br />Small kibble mixed with a larger kibble that I'm assuming is the source of the steak smell...and possibly taste.  (I didn't try it).<br /><br />All three of my dogs loved it and were looking for more.<br /><br />Guess I'll be buying more.... but maybe save it for special occasions when we have steak.<br /><br />Thank you.<br />MEF

review/summary: My Dog Loves This!
review/text: Got this the other day and have been mixing it with my dogs regular food so as not to be an abrupt change and let me tell you she loves this food.  It's dry but soft and puffy but it's nice to see some veggie like looking pieces in a dry dog food.  I can smell the sirloin beefyness more than any other dog food I've come across.<br /><br />I do like the fact that it is made by Purina which is my favorite company for my pet foods and I like the fact that I can give Maxine something that tastes good and not like saw dust.  I use just a bit more of this that her usual food because it is puffy already but if I compacted it I'm sure it would come to just a wee bit less that what she usually eats.<br /><br />My only problem with most dog foods this one included is the amount of crude fat.  Even though my baby is only eleven pounds and a bit small so doesn't really need to worry about a few extra calories it does stand that it would be nice to see more protien and less crude fat in the current dog foods out there.  My baby likes this and that counts for quite a bit.  Better than giving her table food which I do not believe in.

review/summary: Pros & cons, but the pros win out.
review/text: The # 1 ingredient is beef -- a rarity in today's bagged dog food -- but with the price running a little over $2 per pound, I'm not going to use this in place of the high quality kibble I've been feeding my dogs (for which I pay about $1 per pound). However, my dogs LOVE this stuff, so I see two good uses for it:<br /><br />1.  Add a small handful as a flavor booster to their regular kibble.<br /><br />2.  Because it's easy to handle plus chewy and not crunchy, it makes for great rewards during agility training.<br /><br />If I were using it strictly for their regular food I'd give it a lower rating (because of price), but for the purposes I just stated, I think it's excellent and therefore I'll give five stars.  A bag of this stuff on hand is a lot cheaper than the other products I've been using for agility training rewards!

review/summary: Dogs weren't as enthusiastic as I hoped
review/text: We normally combine small packets of moist food with our dogs kibble, since they are picky eaters. I had hoped that they would enjoy this gourmet variety, making it a bit easier on us.<br /><br />I used it for two meals, and they treated it like they do regular kibble, just grazing a bit. They didn't finish it until we added their regular favorite on top of it.<br /><br />I give the food top ratings for being healthy, however given the price and the fact that it will just substitute for regular kibble in our home, I won't be purchasing more.

review/text: I have bought chef michael's "wet" canned food for my dog.  It's quality stuff and my dog never passes it up in his bowl.<br /><br />Was glad to see a dry food sampling offered on Amazon Vine.  Like the wet food, this dry food doesn't disappoint.  The pieces are a decent size for my dog to chew (He's an 11 lb. Maltese)and eats it all up when in his bowl.<br /><br />A great dry food to mix in with wet food or other good dog-friendly foods like rice and green beans!<br /><br />Another quality product by Chef Michaels!

review/summary: Yum, yum, getcha some!
review/text: My two dogs are Purina dogs so when this new Purina product became available, I snapped it up. Upon opening the bag, my puppies began their happy dance, spinning and hopping around as the smell of sirloin wafted through the air. A real food hound, Finn always dives head-first into his dish and inhales his kibble and this time was no different though I think he actually ate a bit faster than usual. Fiona, on the other hand, is a bit of a princess, especially when it comes to her kibble. She usually gets excited then sits around and waits for her brother to finish so she can tease him. This time, however, she couldn't wait and immediately started snarfing down her kibble.<br /><br />A great product that I will definitely purchase for my furry kids!

The downside, as many other reviews mention, are the ingredients are grain heavy so I have been mixing it with their regular brand of meat heavy foods.

review/summary: Makes my dogs happy
review/text: I can start out by saying that my two dogs both love this food, and by their reaction, I could say it's their favorite.  There are things I like about it too.  It smells decent, and has a texture unlike any other food we've ever tried.  It is a bit softer and easier on my older dog's teeth and gums.  Most importantly, my dogs have absolutely no digestive problems after eating this, unlike some other brands we have used.  The ingredient list on the package, however. indicates it is more in line with other supermarket brands, but so does the price.  I would love to say I only buy the most premium products, but realistically I want a food my dogs like, that makes them feel good and has adequate nutrients, and this fits the bill.  I feed my dogs real meat on occasion, and buy the premium brands when I can get a sale, but I feel comfortable that this dog food is fine for most of my dog's needs.

review/summary: My PICKY dog loved it!
review/text: My dog is PICKY! She only eats deli turkey meat. When she gets hungry, she will eat a few grains of dog food, but grudgingly.<br />I normally feed her Blue Wilderness and other natural dog foods. I've tried many brands, but can't find any that she likes, so when I got the opportunity to review Chef Michael's dog food, I thought, "Why not?"<br /><br />Results: She liked it! I was amazed. She ate the whole bowl. Based on likeability - I give it 5 stars.<br /><br />When I compared it to Blue, I do see a difference in nutritional value. Blue has 36% protein, 16% fat and 6% fiber. Chef Michaels' has 28% protein, 16% fat and 3% fiber. The difference is the amount of soy and corn products included in Chef Michaels. The first ingredient is beef, but after that, it contains soybean meal, soy flour, yellow corn, barley, etc. A lot of plant fibers. Blue on the other hand has Chicken, chicken meal, turkey meal, then vegetables like potatoes, peas, etc. Blue is grain-free. Based on nutritional value, I have to give it 3 stars.<br /><br />Blue is about $19.99 for a 4.5 lb bag; Chef Michael's is $11.99 for a 4.5 lb. Bag.<br /><br />Bottom line: If I want my dog to eat something besides deli turkey, I will continue buying Chef Michael's. At least she eats it. I will limit how much as I don't want her to get overweight. The cost may also be a significant factor for some buyers.<br /><br />UPDATE: One week later. My dog really likes this dog food, but she is having trouble adjusting to it and has loose stools. WIth Blue, her stools were never loose (when she ate it). I'll post later and let you know if and when she adjusts.

review/text: I need to start by saying I have three dogs, a senior citizen golden retriever who will eat anything, a 7-year old pug who is somewhat of a picky eater and really likes moist food the most and last of all a 2 year old papillion that is a little princess who is quite the picky eater.<br />I just received this dog food today and put it out for their dinner tonight.  I always feed the youngest dog off by herself so that the big dogs don't disturb her.  She loves this food and ate every bit of it!<br />The two other dogs never looked up from their bowl until all the food was gone.<br />I'm telling you this stuff looks good enough to eat myself.<br />We as a family have discussed that this brand and flavor is now our "go to" food for our dogs at this house.<br />This is well worth your consideration....gave it a 5 star rating.

review/summary: Shaggy Dog says yum
review/text: Shaggy dog thought this was human food, I think because of the way it looks.  The picture on the bag is pretty accurate - there are meat pieces, veggie pieces and kibble.  He seems to like the taste of it, too. That may be beacuse it is so different from his usual limited ingredient grain free foods. This food agreed with his sometimes testy digestive system,so it's a food we'll rotate into his diet from time to time.<br /><br />Here are the stats: crude protein 28%; crude fat 16% crude fiber 3% moisture 12%<br /><br />and the top ingredients: Beef, soybean meal,soy flour,animal fat preserved with mixed tocopherols, brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, yellow corn, glycerin, poultry by-product meal ---- and the list goes on.  You might want to compare this to the food you currently use for comparison.(the first ingredients are those in greatest concentration in the food)

review/summary: My Dog Loves This Stuff
review/text: My old dog, who can be a bit of a princess, loves this stuff.  The "sirloin" bits are soft and chewy while the other bits are crunchy like traditional kibble.  My dog is big, but the bits are small enough that a very small dog would enjoy it as well.<br /><br />I usually wet my dog's kibble (she doesn't like it dry) and add a scoop or two of canned food.  With this, and because she isn't one of those dogs who immediately eats as much as is put down, I can free-feed her the food without it spoiling.<br /><br />So, it's a success with her.  With me, it's almost a success.  I'm not crazy that the food contains animal digest which, according to Wikipedia, can contain all sorts of things I don't want my dog eating, including product from dead, dying, diseased, or disabled animals.  Or roadkill, rats, animals euthanized in "shelters."  I don't know what this particular animal digest contains but that is part of the problem.  I want to know exactly what is in the food I give my animals.  Unfortunately, it is hard to find dog food that doesn't have something nasty in it.  And also unfortunately, this food isn't an exception to the rule.

I mix one cup of Chef Michael's with 1/6th of Beneful Prepared Meals and she eats every bite.  My only problem with Chef Michael's is that it is hard to find in my area.  I would have to drive over 100 miles (round trip) to buy it so I order it thru Amazon.com, I'm a Prime member so shipping is free, and I get it in a couple of days.  If your dog is a fussy eater, try Chef Michael's.  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Definitely worth trying for your dog
review/text: I must say that in my dog's 2+ year lifetime so far, Chef Michael's Dry dog food is the ONLY food that my dog has liked more than once. We made a mistake and fed our dog human food for the majority of his lifetime, which he then developed an obvious taste for people food and would turn down any dog food we tried to feed him. We've tried tons of $$$ worth of dog food that he just sniffed and left, and Chef Michael's he actually eats when hes hungry.<br /><br />We went through two rotisserie chicken bags that he finished and now he's about halfway done with the beef one. I cannot tell which one my dog prefers but I would highly recommend to buy both of them to give yours a variety rather than just one flavor for their lifetime.<br /><br />I would 100% recommend this dog food for your dog. You can find it in your local supermarket (try different ones if one doesn't carry it) or obviously buy it on amazon.

review/summary: Looks Nice, My Dog Likes it, Not Great Nutrition Though
review/text: I often wonder how much time is invested in making dog food look like something we feel better about giving to our pets. This food looks nice, different colors, 'meaty' looking moist chunks and my dog loves eating it.<br /><br />It's over $2 a pound so it should be great right?<br /><br />But, after reading up on the food at dog food advisor dot com I would never get this food again. It can be deceiving that beef is the first ingredient. But as it is explained in the review at dog food advisor, that is the weight of the beef before drying and processing - which contains a lot of water. So after processing, it is probably a much lower percentage of ingredient. Then there were other questionable ingredients including animal fat - the origin can be from a number of gross places, and a high corn meal content.<br /><br />So, I think much of the high price comes from the processing to make it look better to us and therefore make us feel better giving it to our dogs.<br /><br />I think I'm going back to my 4/5 star Kirkland dog food.

review/summary: Don't Be Fooled
review/text: The advertising is seductive.  A handsome young chef prepares a wonderful meal of quality food for his adorable little dog.  You too can do the same by buying his premium dog food.<br /><br />Unfortunately the food does not live up to the hype.  Even though beef is the first ingredient, the protein  count is boosted by plant ingredients, to wit, soy and corn gluten meal.  Additionally, it contains other questionable ingredients incuding animal digest (chemically hydrolized by products sprayed on the food to improve the flavor), chicken by products (essentially rendered slaughterhouse waste) and artificial colors. It also includes menadione which is a form of vitamin K suspected in allergies, liver toxicity and abnormal breakdown of red blood cells.  The food itself had little odor and an relatively attractive appearance. Luckily my dogs, who usually don't show the best judgment with their food choices,weren't too enthusiastic and only nibbled reluctantly.<br /><br />I believe what you feed your dog impacts his health. I have a few friends who actually prepare the food for their dogs but that is largely impracticle for me.  So I will continue investing in Fromms and Innova, both premium products.  Expensive, yes but worth it as an investment in the pet's health and well being.

review/summary: Who's the customer?
review/text: Five out of five dogs agree, this stuff tastes great.<br /><br />Even my picky eater will eat it dry, which is saying a lot.  The fact that my non-picky, eat anything as long as it's not moving too fast, dogs will eat it, says nothing important.<br /><br />At more than $2/pound even at discounted rates, this food is out of my budget.  I feed nearly 300# of dog, total.  We don't spend $2/pound on food.<br /><br />Read the other caveats re ingredients.  In addition, I don't like the extreme marketing to people.  I can smell this stuff.  (I can't add BOLD on the "I" there the way I want to.)  I have very poor smell-ability; this dog food smells to me like something I might eat.  That means, IMO, it is OVERWHELMING my dogs' noses.  Dogs don't need that much flavor.  I am concerned that I will have trouble getting my picky eater to go back to her normal kibble when this bag runs out.  (She's only getting it straight for breakfast; I mix it with kibble for dinner.)<br /><br />"Grilled sirloin"??  Why do my dogs care about "grilled" or "sirloin"?  They'd just as soon have squirrel, mole, vole, rabbit....  in other words, "dead animal."  When a product is marketed with people words, it is being aimed at the entity with the wallet, not the end consumer.<br /><br />"Do fish like these lures?"  "I don't sell these lures to the fish, Charlie..."<br /><br />The food is soft; therefore, I can't see it helping keep teeth clean in any way.<br /><br />In other words?  This dogfood competes favorably with any of the training treats on the market, but I can't see it as daily dogfood in this household.
