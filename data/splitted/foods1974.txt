review/text: There are a lot of filled wafer cookies out there, and more than one organic option. These are hands-down the best I've tried.<br /><br />The cookies are wider than the usual wafer cookie sticks (about twice as wide), though about the same length and thickness. Each has three thin and crispy wafers sandwiched with two layers of creme. They are sweet, but not cloying, with a strong lemon flavor.<br /><br />These are ideal trip food - they don't need refrigeration, the pack is relatively robust polypropylene, not coated paper (getting more common in European packaging these days), and the "best by" date on the package indicates they keep for about a year.<br /><br />I can hardly wait until Amazon has the cocoa version as well.

review/summary: Tastes great, healthy and easy
review/text: OK, so I bought this on a whim as I was tired of the "taste of india" packets that I normally get (that are Ok, but overly salty and oily - I guess a lot of preservatives to maintain the shelf life, heck I don't even recognize some of the ingredients).  I bought the multi pack easyindian(of the same vegetable mix), bottom line probably one of the best options out there for eating healthy (Indian or otherwise), this stuff is all organic, really I checked the ingredients, everything is organic, I've seen others slip a couple of non organic (ingredients) into the mixes - this stuff is the real deal, also there was no filler - all ingredients I recognize (and yes I'm Indian so that helps).  I tried a couple of variations first with Cauliflower (had to saut&eacute; them first) and then cook with the spice, and the second I tried one of those multi veggie, pre-cut frozen bags (peas, carrots, beans etc) - both were exceptional!  My quick take on this easy Indian packets.<br />Pro's<br />- 100% organic (this is Rare to find and I've looked)<br />- Simple instructions and ability to get creative.<br />- There is a website that has a bunch of suggestions, but it was simple enough that I kind of did my own thing, I like to experiment<br />- No extra salt and oil (I can vary according to my taste .. I like that, usually other mixes have that stuff is all crammed in and gives it a very "pickle / achaar like" flavor .<br />- Very authentic and flavorful taste (I realize that is subjective but best way to describe it) but you may have to adjust the vegetable quantity according to your taste.<br />- Kinda like the name, it was surprisingly easy, I've been making Indian food for a while, so I know how time consuming it can be.<br />- These guys seem committed to healthy living and eating, hard to find these days!<br />Con's<br />- I'd like a sample pack (want to try the other ones as well but not sure if I'm ready to buy multi packs of all of them) but that is just me as I like to experiment<br />- I like that the instructions are very clear, but you should know the basics of cooking, like potatoes will take longer than mushrooms to cook - so you have to adjust your vegetable strategy accordingly<br />- Finally make sure you pick healthy vegetables as well (luckily Wegman's and Trader Joes near me have a huge organic vegetable selection), but if you use poor quality veggies or protein it kinda defeats the purpose.<br /><br />Very satisfied with this choice, highly recommend!!!  Hopefully these guys have a bigger selection than the three they have as I'll probably try them all at some point, most definitely going to get some of my friends to give this a try.  I may be looking to add this to my subscribe and save list.<br /><br />Overall #AWESOME

review/summary: Pretty Easy, Fast and Delectable
review/text: Cooking for myself is pretty much non-existent.  I usually pick up take-out in my neighborhood.  It is easy and so convenient.  So when a friend of mine gave me a sample of Indian spices to try at home, I just threw the package on the counter-top and forgot about it.  But one night, I got home from work after midnight.  Chances of scoring take-out was impossible.  Searching my fridge for anything to eat, I found only some leftover vegetables.  What to do?  Sleep or reheat?  Dreading the boring taste to follow, I noticed the packet from Indian Spice.  Moments after tossing in the spices, a nice aroma filled my kitchen.  My mouth began to water as I waited for the vegetables to warm.  The first taste sent my taste buds spinning.  The meal was fantastic.  Within minutes I had eaten everything, a very uncommon experience.  The following day I bought more packets of Indian Spices.  Thanks for waking me up. What a terrific product!

review/summary: Perfect for the healthy or Meat & Potatoes Guy!
review/text: I found this little gem in SF from the market at Arguello and Clement. I was with my girlfriend and debating on something healthy to cook for a few friends and jumped on this nice little organic Indian seasoning based on its enticing packaging and healthy appeal.<br /><br />It was fabulous!  We made this guy at home with some basic vegetables and quinoa, served 4 of us, and everyone loved it!  Including our meat and potatoes irish buddy who fears anything labeled "healthy".  It was definitely a big hit and I will be buying it again, trying out the Tikka Masala next.<br /><br />Thanks Easy Indian!

The most important part is staying hydrated, no more flakes for me.<br /><br />Thank you Alba & Amazon!

review/text: I was so excited to find Shade Grown, Fair Trade, Organic, Decaf coffee.  But it's not good.  It just tastes bad, that is the only way to put it.  Coffee should have a certain flavor, even cheap diner coffee tastes like coffee, but this coffee not so much.  It's definitely a light roast, and maybe I put too much in the pot when I made it, but both my husband and I right off the bat said this taste is gross.  I love Paul Newman's Organic coffee, but while I love the message and even the name of Tiny Footprint, I don't think I'll buy it again.  Now what to do with 2 pounds of coffee I can't stand to drink?

review/summary: Great Medium Roast & Chocolate
review/text: This is not an overly sweet coffee out of the brewer, so you can adjust sweetness to your taste. The chocolate is not over-bearing like some specialty grinds at the grocery store and it's not as strong as a cafe mocha. It's a perfect morning cup of coffee to start the day with a bowl of oatmeal or a donut.<br /><br />The only negative I have is the smell of the chocolate when it first comes out of the brewer. It goes away in a minute or so, but it smells artificial and reminds me of every bad product with "chocolaty" in the name.

review/summary: Best creme center I've ever had.
review/text: I had to report my opinion about these cookies even though I didn't order them on Amazon-- I bought them from the grocery store.<br />I left a box of the fig cookies with my Mom and was unable to try them, but she said they were really yummy and not super sickeningly sweet. Once I saw a chocolate creme cookie, I had to indulge.<br />And oh my goodness it was worth it.<br /><br />The cookie outside is a little stiff and crumbly, but that's to be expected with a gluten free cookie. I remedied the problem by microwaving the two cookies for 30 seconds (which turned them into warm delicious amazingness). They softened up quite a bit this way.<br />The flavor doesn't taste hazelnut-like to me, however, it isn't fudgey. The chocolate center is more of a ganache flavor and is really generous considering the calorie count - about 170 calories for 2 cookies is pretty good. These cookies taste more sinful than that.<br />I also want to mention the cookies come in a box with pre-packaged sets of 2. This is great for packing in lunches, taking on the go, or moderating your snacking ;)<br /><br />Overall, I really love these cookies. Not disappointed at all.. they are one of my favorite gluten free chocolate cookies available!

review/summary: Inherently Good - Not Great...
review/text: These are a very crunchy cookie with a creamy center.  The cookie part crumbles into many bits.  There is no neat way to eat them.  I even tried putting a bowl under me.  This method catches a lot of the mess, but not all of it.  If you don't have something under you, you will spill tons of crumbs all over.  It is rather ridiculous & frustrating.<br /><br />I'm not crazy about the flavor.  The chocolate cream has an odd taste that I found somewhat familiar.  Once I looked at the ingredients it made more sense - hazelnuts.  If you are familiar with the chocolate hazelnut spreads, you will have a good idea of how it tastes. I happen to like the spreads (Rapunzel makes an organic version thankfully you do not need to buy the GMO pesticide crap) but I don't care for it in these cookies.<br /><br />While the ingredients are mostly good there is room for improvement: organic soy flour, NON organic soy lecithin (GMO anyone?) & natural flavors.<br /><br />The ingredients as per the box are as follows:  organic cane sugar, organic palm fruit oil, organic rice flour, organic tapioca starch, organic potato starch, organic eggs, organic sunflower oil, organic cocoa, organic rice starch, organic rice syrup, organic soy flour, organic hazelnuts, organic arabic gum, organic egg yolks, leavening (monocalcium phosphate, baking soda), salt, soy lecithin, guar gum, natural flavor.<br /><br />Since there are so few organic gluten free options these are a better choice than many & the flavor is not bad though it could use some improvement. Hence my 3 star rating which means, "they are okay."<br /><br />As for their other cookies, I have tried their fig cookies & their vanilla cream filled.  Out of all 3 I would say the vanilla cream have the best flavor.  They suffer the same overly messy crumbs as these cookies do.  The fig have very little taste & the cookie is soft.  So soft, that it falls apart in your hand before you can even take a bite!  At this point, I have satisfied my curiosity in the Jovial line & am not likely to purchase any more of their products.  I think I'll be sticking with my old stand by; organic milk chocolate covered raisins.  Yum!

Judging on nutrition and taste alone, I felt like they should have tasted better for the number of calories they had.

They weren't horrible, I did eat all of them, but I probably would not buy them again.

review/text: My cat was continually getting hot spots after we go a second kitten.  We couldn't figure out what is was.  We eventually ended up trying this food because it was "Limited Ingredients".  It worked like a charm, and he didn't have his hotspots coming back.  We figured out it was grain because one morning he drank some milk with Mini-Wheats in it and the next day he got a hotspot after not having one for a while.<br /><br />So if your cat might have a grain allergy definitely try this food. The cats had a problem with it at first but they love it now that they know they aren't getting the other stuff anymore.<br /><br />I took 1 star off for the price, though it is cheaper then going the raw food route, I still feel it's excessive.

Lower than the other brand (Her-something), but still  200mg == 50% daily per can.<br />- Preservatives.  Not a big deal to me. A bit of sodium benzoate, which is probably needed to keep the color nice and green.<br /><br />Would be 5 stars with a bit less sodium.

I am self-employed, I work from home, and MANY times this has "filled the hole" till I can finish what I'm doing and cook a more substantial meal.<br /><br />It is somewhat "healthier" than the standard ramen / cup 'o' noodles product: 2.5 grams fat (4% daily allowance), Sat Fat 2.5 grams (3%), Trans Fat (0 grams), Sodium (47%)...so maybe a healthier option is to eat all of the noodles but leave some of the broth.<br /><br />I just can't, in good conscience, encourage you to pay almost double the cost of what you'd pay in a local market.

review/text: I bought the product and several flavor extracts from their actual website.  I don't want anyone else to have to go through the same frustrations for lack of information.  The extracts I received are so far off from the intended flavors that I doubt the solution's even edible.  The site claims natural flavors.  These were destroying all my senses.  Let's start with the vanilla, probably the most common extract people use.  Their excuse was every company has different flavors.  I've shopped for vanilla extracts from so many<br />different companies, natural, imitation, etc.  The faerie finest one I got was WORSE than the WORST POSSIBLE IMITATION vanilla.  I<br />called them to explain and ask for a refund.  I can understand where shipping cannot be reimbursed for those who mis-<br />ordered.  Unfortunately the INFLATED shipping costs cannot be reimbursed even if you're extremely unsatisfied with the<br />products, even though I was willing to ship it back to them out of my own pocket.  So the products I got will be going<br />into the garbage.  This has destroyed my confidence in shopping with them.  BE VERY WARY!! I don't want someone else to<br />have to go through the same frustrations I did.  I know it's cheap and very tempting, but for me, it was still a WASTE OF MONEY because the products I received are COMPLETELY UNUSABLE.

review/text: This is my favorite K Cup.  If you are a flavored coffee lover and like your coffee sweet and creamy this K Cup is for you. But I do not make this K Cup as a cold drink.  I make it as a hot coffee drink and it is yummy.  SO keep that in mind, also I make a large cup and then make a small cup using the same K cup.  Just don't take it out the machine.

review/summary: Getting Pass the Superficial
review/text: Most of us (girls mostly) grew up running away from, chasing, or killing this little insect. You'd never think of actual eating one. Most people have a problem with eating crickets or any insect not because of the fear of how it may taste, but the fact that it's an INSECT. People also see these little guys as dirty and not worth being food for humans. This is understandable looking at some cricket or other insect that wanders inside of your home, but it's different when they are farmed especially for human consumption as these. I mean, you wouldn't just chuck some random insect into your mouth, even if you were into eating insects. It's like gnawing on a cow while it's grazing and this clearly isn't the case.<br /><br />This product is one of the first "alternative-protein" foods I've tried. Like almost everyone, I had to get over the shock of putting something that could also have die in the soles of my shoes into my mouth. Once you get past the looks and the no no thoughts, they pretty much taste like roasted, flavored peanuts though a bit hollow. The more you eat the more "normal" it feels. I even had a friend try one ( I paid them $1), they popped it into their mouth, Fear Factor face and all, and asked for more. The only drawback for me is that it takes more than one at a time to make it feel as though you're not eating air and I didn't get my dollar back.<br /><br />After eating crickets, I wanted to know what else there is to try and so I've sampled just about every other bug Hotlix has to offer. If you're an adventurous eater like me, this is a must. Absolutely. If not, they're great for gag gifts, party icebreakers, and pranks.

review/text: This crickets are a terrible value, have no flavor, and come in very small portions.

I bought these Crick-ettes as a novelty, and for that they have served their purpose, but judging by any other criteria, this product is terrible.

review/text: These were purchased when they were being offered at a very inexpensive price. I had never tried this product before and was concerned it might not be very good considering the very inexpensive price.<br />The bottles arrived in great condition. I tried some of the dressing on a salad and found it to be very tasty. The tangy mustard, sweet honey, and the vidalia onion make a great combination. I've since used it as a light sauce for pasta, drizzled over steamed vegetables, and as a marinade for grilled chicken. In each case, the results were very tasty.<br />They are priced higher as of this review. But at just over the current price price of 6.00 a bottle - they are still a good value. The bottles are quite large and will last a long time.<br />Very pleased with this purchase.

review/summary: These pears are delicious.
review/text: I was ordering the yellow nectarines and decided to try these ones too. I don't usually like dried pears because the texture of the ones I have had in the past has been a little grainular, and I don't enjoy that. These are smooth and more succulant as well. The flavor is not overly sweet and happily it tastes like 'pear'. Don't laugh, we all know they don't always taste like they are supposed to, these do. I have a great little fruit and nut stand near my place but they don't do the yellow nectarines, which is my favorite fruit. Along with Ranier cherries, but I couldn't find those so I tried pears instead and am glad I did. I will order these again.

review/summary: Absolutely Awful Cat Food
review/text: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy they catchy jingle from the commercials. My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with cats and dogs." Basically, corn cannot be fully digested, it is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.

This does not replace regular or sea salt in a recipe.  I don't know if I can let my salami just hang at room temp or not, so it's all in the fridge at the moment.  I guess I should sacrifice one and see how it fairs just hanging in my walk in pantry.  I'll come back and let you know if it goes rotten.  Okay, I just checked on my salami hanging in the pantry for 3 weeks.  Not a speck of mold or discoloring.  We can't eat it as it has totally dried out but it's cured.

review/text: I 1st got this flavor as a gift along with my new Keurig. I am extremely upset that the flavor is discontinued. Granted I am not a Cappuccino drinker, never even tried it. I do like regular coffee but I normally need a ton of sugar or Equal to be able to drink it. I've tried numerous K-cup flavors and this was the ONLY one I could drink without really any sugar in it. I used to drink it as a dessert or just as a treat and now it's gone. Thanks to a bunch of people who complained about having no foam like the regular stuff. REALLY PEOPLE?? Get a freakin grip and get over yourselves. Big deal, something doesn't look or taste EXACTLY like the originals and you have to bust chops about it. If you didn't like it, drink the regular stuff. Why complain about it to the company and on reviews? Now the people that actually like the flavor won't be able to get it anymore after a while and now it's at a ridiculous price due to the supply and demand factor. So thanks a bunch to you people. It always has to be the complainers to ruin it for everyone else. Another great flavored product gone by the stupidity of others.

It is a smooth blend of coffe that just needs a little cream and it is like comfort in a cup for me. They must have discontinued after I started drinking it because I was searching high and low for it after getting some at a Macy's. Just when I thought all was lost Amazon sent me an email to say it was available. Of course now I am shocked that the price is up there like a rare jewel but guess I will bite the bullet and get some until it is gone. Sad day for us Cappuccino lovers. Once they see that everyone is buying it up perhaps they will consider making it again.

review/text: I love coffee. In the K-Cup world I'm not brand loyal. I used to frequent Gloria Jean's while growing up in So.Cal and like their icy sweet drinks before Coffee Bean or Starbucks had a comparable offering. Fast forward to today. In my honest opinion, this K-Cup tastes like dirty coffee warmed over. I wasn't expecting a cappuccino. I know what a Cappuccino is. I've been to France & Italy half a dozen times and fully enjoy espresso drinks while dining there. That said, what I was expecting was something that tasked vaguely like espresso perhaps or a full bodied roast. That is not what this delivers.

review/summary: NOT a good flavoring!
review/text: I tried this extract in several types of baked goods and was dissapointed every time. There seemed to be no flavor at all! I eventually used 4 tsp in a sugar cookie recipe and STILL could not discern any flavor hazelnut or otherwise! I tried it in a simple sugar and milk glaze thinking perhaps cooking had influenced the flavor. There was only the slightest vaguely bitter taste to the glaze. There was no flavor, pleasant or otherwise in anything I tried this product in.

review/text: I've never had any caramel wafers before so when I saw these at BJs Wholesale Club, I was intrigued. Picked up a box of 48 for $10, which seems like a great price.<br /><br />They are sort of crunchy on the outside with a creamy caramel on the inside. If you put it over your cup when your drink is hot, it softens the caramel. If you don't have a hot drink, you can just microwave it for a few seconds and get the same effect.<br /><br />They are tasty and perfect as an afternoon treat. Once seems to do the trick of satisfying a sweet tooth. They would be nice for company after dinner too.

The bags themselves are far larger than any tea bag, and they don't have a string with tag attached.  For a traveller, like myself - this product is super convenient.  Since there is both Tea and Coffee being brewed from a single pouch, the taste is somewhat of an acquired one.  Should I have Coffee, or should I have Tea?  Well, no need to agonize over this dilemma, because you're having BOTH. I, for one, is getting quite accustomed to it.  High Tea, any one?  Cheers!

review/summary: Tasty, but not like your typical ginger cookie
review/text: I'm a fan of ginger snaps and cookies. I can't have dairy, so I give a thumbs up to Lazy Day for making them dairy-free.<br /><br />Think twice about ordering these through the mail, though. Mine arrived with the chocolate melted everywhere. Only half of the cookie is covered in chocolate, so your fingers won't get messy holding onto the other half. I happily ate these melted and messy, though! I loved them, but they didn't taste like your typical ginger cookie... more like a shortbread cookie. Either way, I recommend them and I'll keep an eye out in stores where they're stored at safe temperatures.<br /><br />If you like trying different brands like I do, I also recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DZFMIM">Pamela's ginger cookies</a>. They're soft, rich, and even taste like they're made with chocolate (but, surprise, they aren't!).

review/text: I was really disappointed by these cookies.  Yes, they are gluten and egg free but they're also somewhat tasteless other than sweet.  The chocolate was completely melted and they were delivered on a day when the temps were in the 70s.  I let them get to room temp but the chocolate never solidified again.  The texture was what I would expect; soft and a little grainy but not bad.  I would have liked more ginger in the taste and less sweet.  I was not able to find a nutrition label other than the ingredients.  If you cannot have gluten, eggs, etc., you might like these cookies as a treat once in a while but you'll want to get them from a local store so you might have a chance to eat them before they melt.  Overall, I was unimpressed.

review/summary: Tasty chocolate but very light ginger flavoring
review/text: The box contains 8 cookies, with each cookie just a little over 2 inches in diameter. About 1/3 of each cookie is covered in chocolate. I had the same problem that others did - the cookies arrived and the chocolate had melted and then hardened, making it difficult to eat a single cookie - they kept breaking into pieces.<br /><br />Taste-wise, I did find that they had a slightly gritty texture, not uncommon with vegan cookies. The cookies are soft with a light ginger flavoring. While I don't care for a strong ginger taste, I would have liked a bit stronger flavoring as these seemed rather bland. Even though it had melted, I found the chocolate to be rich and tasty. The combination of the rich chocolate and the ginger taste works well together.<br /><br />These cookies are a product of Scotland. While there is a list of ingredients, nutritional information is not listed on the package.<br /><br />If you're looking for vegan or gluten-free cookies, you may want to try these cookies. I think if you're just looking for a tasty cookie, you probably want to pass.

review/summary: Ginger Without The Snap
review/text: It's hard for any cookie to be considered truly bad (to me, at least), so the question becomes "is it worth the calories?" Sadly, the Lazy Day Dark Chocolate Ginger Cookies don't clear this hurdle for me, though in fairness I'm not gluten intolerant, and these cookies may be ideal for someone who is.<br /><br />Like another reviewer noted, the cookies don't fare well in a hot mailbox (which isn't their fault, but did result in the cookies being welded together by melted chocolate). The cookies have a somewhat soft and chewy texture, and each has a half-dip of dark chocolate. Unfortunately, there's not enough ginger in these cookies for me to have identified them as "ginger" in any way without the label. Overall, the impressions I got were simply "soft and sweet" - and, in fact, TOO sweet.<br /><br />Considering their rather steep price, I'd pass on these in the future...though as I said, if it's really hard to find gluten-free cookies these might be worthwhile for someone who has more restricted dietary choices than I do.

review/summary: Decent-tasting, but some problems
review/text: I love ginger and dark chocolate, so I was excited to try these cookies.  When I received them, I did what I always do with a new food product:  I looked at the nutritional info.  Unfortunately, it is written European style, so the amounts are NOT listed per serving size; in fact, a serving size is not even given.  Values are per 100 grams, and the package is 125 grams total, with 8 cookies in the package...that is quite a lot of math!  However, to the best of my ability, that means each cookie has about 92 calories, 4.2 grams fat (2 grams saturated), 13.1 grams carbohydrates, and 8.1 grams sugar.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed in the texture of these cookies.  First, they were crumbly and stuck together in the package, which was a bit messy.  Second, they seemed to have lost their firmness, like a cookie that is past its freshness.  The taste itself wasn't bad:  the dark chocolate--which covers half the cookie, in a dipped fashion--was good, and the cookie part had a nice flavor, although there was only a very slight hint of ginger; as a ginger lover, I would have appreciated a much stronger bite.<br /><br />Overall, I found these cookies to be just okay.  Perhaps they would be better purchasing them fresh from the grocery store, but I would not order them myself online.

These cookies are so yummy and such a pleasant surprise. They are soft; not hard. It doesn't taste like what I thought vegan cookies would taste like - like cardboard. Half the cookie is covered in tasty chocolate with just enough sweet to soothe your sweet tooth. I looked up the makers on the cookies online and saw that they are made in the UK. Damn! I was so hoping I could find them in stores but you can order them on Amazon which is a huge plus.<br /><br />The calorie count is decent - 6 cookies is 589 calories. I only ate 3 cookies in one sitting and felt satisfied.<br /><br />These cookies go perfect with a hot cup of tea. I will be definitely adding the Lazy Day Ginger Cookies to must buy list.

Sadly no. Ginger? What ginger? The dark chocolate isn't bad, but the cookie tastes like nothing. I was really looking forward to eating a ginger cookie, but there wasn't even a hint of it.<br /><br />If you're on a gluten-free diet, you might find these tasty. I'm not and didn't.

review/summary: Ginger + Chocolate should = more
review/text: I was excited to try these cookies as the combination of two of my favorite flavors sounded unbeatable.  Unfortunately, they weren't quite what I had hoped.<br /><br />The texture was the greatest disappointment:  they were coarse, granular cookies without the snap.  To be fair, making the texture of any gluten-free baked good is challenging, but there is room for improvement.  Midel<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPP588">Mi-Del, Swedish Style Ginger Snaps, 10-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> does a better job getting the texture right for a gingersnap.  I was actually hoping the texture would be more like Pamela's Spicy Ginger Cookies<br />with Crystallized Ginger<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DZFMFU">Pamela's Products Spicy Ginger Cookies, 5.29-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  Those have a firm texture with a bit of give in the middle.<br /><br />I was also hoping for a stronger ginger flavor, as found in Midel and Pamela's products.  The ginger is there, but it is  initially subtle, gaining in heat with more chewing or a greater quantity.  I think the idea of the cookie half dipped in chocolate makes it special, but there again, the chocolate was not  as strong or rich as it might have been.<br /><br />I shared them with two other people to get their response.  One thought they were just okay, lamenting the mildness of the ginger; the other liked the texture and flavor, and was very happy to finish the box!

review/text: The flavor of this cookie is pretty good for gluten-free fare. Texture is nice, too. Not gritty like some cookies I've had in the past. I wish it was crispy like it says in the description. They were soft and crumbled. I could blame it on California weather but it wasn't that hot today (85 degrees maybe). Any way, the chocolate was completely melted and reformed.<br />The ginger cookie is not particularly strong in ginger or spice flavor. The cookie to chocolate ratio is chocolate heavy. What makes it so palatable is probably all the super sweet chocolate they use to cover up the slightly bland ginger cookie underneath. There are 8 cookies per box and four boxes per pack, if you buy them from Amazon. Tip for those who want to try these, order them on a chilly day or you'll get a box of crumbly goo like I did.<br />I gave these three stars because I think they have the potential to be good. And for how limited gluten free cookies and bread options are out there, this is not bad at all. Could have been a lot worse.

review/text: Like so many other reviewers have noted, the cookies I received had melted chocolate that had hardened all over them. The cookies were stuck together, so I couldn't truly indulge in the flavor - some bites were pure cookie, some were pure chocolate.<br /><br />These cookies were a bit tasty - the ginger and chocolate fit well together. The texture, like so many gluten-free products, was disappointing. They were very mealy, gritty - almost sandy. Not the fault of the cookie, but the problem that every gluten free product has due to the flours that are used (rice, tapioca, etc).<br /><br />The cookies were just a little chewy, which made me wonder if they were stale or if they're just not supposed to be crunchy. The chocolate was very good, high quality chocolate, which was a nice touch.<br /><br />These aren't cookies I'd keep in my house all the time, but they weren't bad. My main issue was the condition in which they were delivered, which was disappointing.

review/text: If you like ginger and you like dark chocolate, you will enjoy these cookies.  The cookie is basically a ginger cookie that has been dipped in dark chocolate so that half the cookie is covered in choc and the other half is plain.  The combination is fantastic!<br /><br />The only issue I had with them is that the chocolate melted in transit, resulting in the cookies themselves being stuck together and are now difficult to separate.  I'm not sure if there is a solution to that other than packaging that would make them a pain in the neck to get into so I can live with them as is.<br /><br />Update:  I wrote the above before I had read the packaging carefully and once I did, I am SOOO impressed with these cookies.  The cookies are free of gluten, wheat, dairy and egg so are suitable for coeliacs and vegans, yet you would never guess that they are missing these ingredients that I would consider staple ingredients in any cookie.  I don't know how they did it but I am really impressed that they did without losing the taste or texture of a regular cookie.

review/summary: Good flavor but needs improvement - chocolate melted
review/text: I thought these cookies had a lot of flavor (a touch on the sweet side) for a vegan/gluten free treat - they were very gingery in a good way.  However, when I opened the package, the chocolate had obviously melted and re-solidified during shipping so the cookies were stick together and chocolate was all over.  This made them difficult to eat, and the cookies were more soft then I think they should have been.  I like my ginger snaps crisp on the outside and soft on the inside - these had no crispness at all, which would be fine if you like soft cookies but along with the melted chocolate, they were just too soft and messy.  These would be a great product if the manufacturer made some improvements to the chocolate and packaging. I didn't feel like I was eating something gluten free, though, so they at least got the flavor right!

review/summary: Gluten Free Cookies on the Sweet Side
review/text: I enjoyed these cookies but found them a bit too sweet for my taste.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />*Gluten-, dairy-, and egg-free.  Very impressed with product on that score.<br />*Really good dark chocolate.<br />*Made in facility that doesn't have nuts but box states they cannot guarantee cookies are free from nuts.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />*Very sweet; might not be to everyone's taste.<br />*Not much ginger flavor.<br />*A bit crumbly.<br />*Pricey.<br /><br />If you cannot tolerate gluten or are a vegan, these will prove an excellent sweet treat.  I would have preferred a bit more ginger and less sugar, but I still found them quite tasty.

review/summary: Very tasty, but chocolate melted in my package
review/text: I actually liked these cookies very much, they were a hit in our office.  But the chocolate completely melted in my package and became this frozen goo at the bottom of the box.  I had to use a knife and cut out the cookies and the chocolate mess.  But.. the flavor is great and I would buy again, only in a store so I can be sure the cookies are intact and not melted.  This could be something that only happened to me since I scanned other reviews but did not see a similar problem.

review/summary: different..not the same.
review/text: Not you typical run of the mill ginger cookie dipped in chocolate. Given the fact that this is gluten free product which has a unique taste all its own, it may take some getting use to. Texture wise, its not bad and the dark chocolate is great, its those initial first bites where your goin.. 'uh, this is weird? If your a fan of gluten free products, or have to have them due to health issues, this product is at least worth the try.

review/summary: Liked the chocolate, didn't like the 'ginger cookie'
review/text: These are organic healty cookies, and I like the concept, however I didn't particularly care for the taste. The chocolate was the best part, but I found the ginger part tasted grainy mealy and had an unpleasant aftertaste. It also didn't taste much like a ginger cookie. it lacked the real snap of a ginger cookie in taste and texture. The box also arrived with several cookies melted and some damaged which made them unattractive to boot.<br /><br />If you have dietary limitations and need a gluten free item, or want a vegan cookie, thse might appeal to you. For me, I didn't find them that good and they weren't my favorite. There are better cookies out there- and ginger cookies are fairly easy to bake yourself.

review/summary: Sadly, these were awesome.
review/text: Why sadly?  Because now I will want to buy and eat these every day and they are not kind to my diet.<br /><br />A gluten-free cookie with a delicate ginger bite that is half-covered in chocolate?  I'm just not sure you can get any better than this!  I didn't have high hopes because I've tried gluten-free treats before, and they generally leave something to be desired.  The texture and consistency of this cookie was tender and spot-on.  I'm not sure your average person would even notice or care that this cookie is free of the gluten.  Personally, I don't have a problem with gluten, but I was so excited to share these with my gluten-intolerant friend!  Sadly for her, I ate them all before that could happen.<br /><br />Nom nom nom nom.  I am totally buying some.  Maybe my gluten-hating friend will get one this time.<br /><br />The chocolate did get a little melty at some point and had resolidified later, joining the cookies in a deadly embrace of chocolate, but that didn't stop me from eating them all.  You might consider buying these in the cooler weather, though.

review/summary: Quite tasty
review/text: I'm a fool for a ginger and chocolate combo, so I was excited to find these gluten-free cookies.  I was disappointed when I received them, as they were a bit smooshed and melted.  I'm in the dregs of a southeastern Summer, so I can't fault them on the heat too much.  However, if you're in the business of shipping something around the world delivering the product in good condition regardless of climate is a plus.  The cookies need to be better packaged for shipping and possibly kept cooler.<br /><br />I could always turn up the degree of darkness in the chocolate and gingeriness in the cookie, but they were tasty.  To note, they are not at all crispy as the packaging indicates.  I'm fine with that, but either the cookies I received weren't in top form per their description, or the description needs reworking.  Also, if I wasn't told they were gluten-free, I wouldn't have known.<br /><br />All said, it's a good cookie.  I'd have them again, and hope for better packaging and weather.

review/summary: Four star for *potential*...not the cookie's fault:(
review/text: This cookie could just beeee....so much more than it was! It wasn't the cookie's fault; I'm with the majority of the reviewers who stated that the condition in which they were received was severely lacking. Same as the others, the chocolate on my cookies appeared to have melted, then re-hardened (due to...storage conditions? Shipping conditions?). The chocolate was also white-ish in color (due to less than ideal storage conditions). Because of that fact, the cookies were stuck together.<br /><br />On a positive note (which is why I gave them four stars), the taste of the ginger cookie was wonderful! Not too spicy...just enough. The description states that it's dark chocolate. I think mine was milk chocolate. Even with the condition of the chocolate, I could tell it wasn't dark. That's okay too..but they could have been more decadent:)~ the ginger cookie could have had a crunchier texture, similar to a regular ginger snap cookie.<br /><br />We enjoyed these cookies for what they could be! In my opinion, they didn't taste gluten free ~ and that's a good thing! Try them. You may be lucky enough to get a batch in the condition they SHOULD arrive in and I think you'd be pleasantly surprised!

review/summary: Great taste, but don't pass these cookies around
review/text: Lazy Day Chocolate Gingers are small ginger snaps generously covered with Belgian chocolate. Guaranteed to be free from gluten, wheat, dairy and egg products, they are said to be suitable for "coeliacs [sic] and vegans," as well as a tasty treat for the rest of us.  The dark chocolate is luscious, and I really enjoyed this sample of the Scottish-made cookies.<br /><br />Even though they are fairly well packaged, the cookies had become mashed together during their trip to the U.S. They were hard to separate without crumbling. Although they are delicious, and satisfyingly rich and sweet, I wouldn't necessarily count on serving them to company.

review/summary: Tasty, but healthy?
review/text: I have to start out by saying that I am not a huge fan of ginger, but I have a book club that I meet with all of the time and we like to share goodies.  I originally found these cookies in a store (maybe Whole Foods?) and decided to give them a try.  I appreciated the chocolate part of the cookies and passed on the other half to my friends.  Everyone enjoyed the taste, except one who said it tasted "buttery".<br /><br />After my initial experience with these cookies, I wanted to treat everyone again.  They were the same yummy cookies, but where shipped terribly.  It's still very hot in California, and that should have been taken into account when shipping chocolate.  The chocolate was completely melted which made it difficult to extract the cookies with chocolate left on it and not the packaging.  Since the chocolate part was the part that I enjoyed, I was extremely disappointed.  I would recommend waiting until the weather cools down to order these online.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: These are great! I seriously could eat a whole box in one setting if I allowed myself. The ginger cookies are really tasty and have a great texture, the dark chocolate sets it off perfectly and you could just the right amount of both so nothing is overpowering. The chocolate is also very good, not bitter but not overly sweet. They are just delicious.

review/summary: Quite good
review/text: I was a bit skeptical about the chocolate and ginger snap combination, but these were actually quite tasty. I appreciated that the chocolate only covers half of the cookie as that allowed us to share the ginger half with our two year old (who loved them by the way--"More? More?" he kept asking).<br /><br />As a previous reviewer noted, there is margarine in these, which I'm not a fan of for health reasons, but otherwise the ingredients are good. Aside from that the only negative comment I have is with the shipping as however it was done allowed all the chocolate on our cookies to melt, thus sticking them together and coating the packaging with chocolate.<br /><br />As someone who needs to eat both gluten- and dairy-free foods, these were a welcome surprise and an enjoyable treat.
