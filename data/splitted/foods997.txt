review/summary: Love me some Bliss!
review/text: Honestly, I really enjoy this product.  B6 and B12 are great for boosting the mood, so I have read, and chamomile has always worked extremely well for me as a sleep aid/anxiety reducer.  I'm not sure about the other ingredients.  I suffer from fairly severe anxiety, and this drink definitely helps to take it down a notch and put me in a calmer, more contented mood.  I tend to drink 2 or 3 a week, though I'd love to drink it daily.  Of course, I suppose this could be placebo, I can't prove that it's not, but it seems to work pretty well for me.  Also, from researching the ingredients and from experience, it does not mess with my SSRI, which one needs to be careful about when taking supplements. And I happen to like the light, slightly citrus taste.<br /><br />I give this four stars because every so often when I have this it makes me feel a little out of it for maybe a half hour.

review/summary: This is not my idea of "happiness"
review/text: After lunch, I drank about 1/3rd of the bottle (the flavor is pretty good) and stopped when I started feeling like my world was closing in on me. I started getting a headache and felt really drugged.  Not a good thing when trying to work...typing was something I had to really concentrate on.  I'm finally coming back to normal after about 45 minutes but the headache still lingers.  Unless I'm sitting on the couch with nothing to do but eat, I won't be drinking it again!

review/summary: Works For Me!
review/text: The first neuro drink i had was neuro gasm, right before my sister and I went into our local state park for the trails. It was like everything was in ultra-color, happy, joyful, and  it was the first time in awhile that I did not have to take one break while walking the trails. I drank neuro bliss while helping my friend with their course work and throughout the session I was calm, really happy, and considerate.

review/summary: Natural anti-anxiety solution
review/text: I used to be on anti-anxiety medication but recently decided to get off of them.  I started drinking Bliss after it was recommended to me by a friend.  It works wonders with concentration and stress.  I have Bliss every morning and can easily tackle a stressful day of work and work more efficiently as well. This is much safer than taking a prescription pill (or even an over the counter one) and tastes great too.

review/summary: What A Bad Trip!
review/text: I downed a bottle of this in about two minutes, and man was I glad that I tried this at home. It gave me a feeling within minutes like I was in the Twilight Zone or some horrible nightmare. Like the walls were moving farther and farther away. This only lasted for about ten minutes then I actually started to feel stoned. It was like I smoked some illegal green herb and did a few shots of espresso on top of it. It was very nice for about an hour. Then the terrible part happened, the crash! It felt like I had a few glasses of wine and then took a short nap like a mild hangover. If you want to try it, try it at home! I am not messing with this stuff again.

review/text: I was very skeptical of this product, but I purchased it since the Neuro representatives were so friendly.  I was en route to my college graduation when I picked this up, and sipped it until I got to the site.  I was surprised by how relaxed I was because I expected to be a ball of nerves through the ceremony.  After my experience with the other drinks, I do believe that the Bliss helped me.

review/summary: Bliss can't be sold in a bottle
review/text: The tag line on the back of the bottle sold me-- it was something like, "what's wrong with wanting to feel happy?" I was feeling blue, and thought maybe trying something new would make me feel better, even if the drink didn't.<br /><br />I drank about a 1/4 of the bottle. It tasted pretty good ! But then five minutes later got a BAD headache. I wound up going to bed early,  woke up the next day and STILL had the headache.... and it stayed with me almost all day!!  I NEVER get headaches!<br /><br />I never use energy drinks, so maybe I'm sensitive to it,  but it didn't seem to me that this was even advertised as an energy drink-- it's just vitamins, right?  But I'm definitely not trying Neuro drinks again-- I'll stick to my usual vitamin supplement. Time is too precious to risk being crippled by a headache!

review/summary: Great complement to seafood and fish flavors
review/text: If your cat is like mine, they'll really like one flavor a lot, and will eat it for a while. And, then, for whatever reason, they'll want a change. This duck and green pea is always a hit with my shorthair. It is a lot different from the other flavors, and he never ever grows tired of it. This is a smooth creamy cat food, with a lot of moisture in it -- highly recommended for adult male cats prone to urinary problems. Those males often don't drink enough water, so this food helps by adding some water to their diet.

Therefore, my cats give it 5 stars and I subtract a star for all the ingredients I don't want my cats to have.<br /><br />But I might have to buy some to have on hand when I want to coax them from under the couch to go to the vet.

review/text: I aim to feed my cats only the best nutrition. I received a sample of this with an order from Pet Food Direct and let them try it (like humans, I believe the cats can have "bad" treats in moderation, as long as their diet on the whole is a healthy one). I have never seen them go so crazy over treats. They were literally jumping on me for more. So the cats would give this 6 stars, but I just wish it didn't have so much "junk" in it. I still buy it and give them a few a day.

review/summary: It's like kitty crack
review/text: I don't know why cats need "treats," but I got some sample size packets of this product in with my regular shipment of Wellness cat food, and offered them to my two cats. One is usually game to try anything and begs for human food, the other has thrived on Wellness wet and dry food, but is not adventurous about trying other brands.<br /><br />I have never seen a reaction like this to dry kibble before with either these or any of my previous cats. One bite and they were hooked! Now whenever they hear the cellophane packaging being opened, they come running and meowing. They don't seem to bite or chew the stuff, just swallow it down.<br /><br />I haven't noticed any of the digestive upsets others here blame on the product.  Still, I'm not convinced it's a food I'd want to feed regularly; the ingredients don't impress me, which is why I deducted one star. I guess it'll be off to kitty rehab for my two addicts when the freebies run out.

review/summary: Goodlife Catnip Treats Good
review/text: Whatever the ingredients, given to your cat as a treat (ie 3-4 pieces at a time once per day)it will not be harmful to your cat's digestive system, and the plain truth is, my cat loves them. She is very finicky, but when it comes to these treats, she will eat them before anything else. We give her Wellness brand food, which is very healthy ingredients-wise, so the small bit of by-product and other ingredients in these treats are more than balanced out by her regular diet. Just like humans and their treats huh?

review/text: I have given my cats Goodlife twice--the first time on purpose, the second on accident. All Goodlife products give my cats severe diarrhea. I only gave them a few pieces of this cat treat before I remembered that this brand was bad. It was not a pretty picture. I believe the problem might be all of the vegetables they have put in this. It looks great to people (vegies are supposed to be good, right?), but cats are obligate carnivores, and all this grain and vegies isn't good for them. Don't buy this unless you enjoy cleaning crap off of your floors.

Strangely, his sister seems to be refractory to the treats, maybe she doesn't respond to whatever ingredient that makes cats go crazy for catnip.

review/text: Again... these are CAT TREATS, not an AUDIO CD as the review title states.<br /><br />I got these as a trial size treat in an order from another vendor and my female LOVES THEM. They are easy for her to eat because the pieces are very small and softer than a normal kibble. She begs for them, very unusual.<br /><br />Thanks to the other reviewer, Rachel, for reminding us to be very careful when introducing changes into our pets' diets. They are all unique and react differently. I forgot that treats are not "food" when I let my kitty eat a whole trial size pack of these in one day because she loved them so much. No adverse effects, but since I'm so busy cleaning up barf piles from my other cat's delicate tummy (not from these, just a regular thing), I needed the heads up.<br /><br />Also, thanks to Pat for letting me know I can buy them locally right down the street.  There's nothing like paying more for the shipping than for the product.  No problem when I'm buying other things from the vendor too but if all I want is a 3 ounce bag of cat treats... I'll pass.

review/summary: Wow...A truly high quality malted milk ball ... totally unlike the junk that passes for malted milk balls @ your local drugstore
review/text: I have memories, as a child, of malted milk balls purchased by the ounce from a local candy store, and of how delicious they tasted.<br /><br />As an adult, I have often wondered if my memories are tainted by age and time, since every malted milk ball I've had the pleasure (?) of eating as an adult has only served to remind me of why I don't buy malted milk balls as an adult. We're talking mostly of the stuff sold by Brachs and the like at the drugstore, but also of the many no-names who package up such candy around Easter. They can all be summarized this way: Some malted taste surrounded by waxy brown cr*p that bears a third Cousin twice removed relationship to chocolate.<br /><br />I bought a box (a 10 POUND BOX) of these Jelly Belly malted milk balls on a whim: Amazon had them on a "cheaper than dirt" sale. (Well, maybe not quite as cheap as dirt, but close). I wasn't expecting much, and figured if I didn't like them I'd just bring them into work and become the hero of both those with low blood sugar and dentists everywhere, for at least a day.<br /><br />They arrived quickly: Two resealable zip-lock 5lb bags, nicely packaged in an official Jelly Belly box. (Ooh...) So far, so good.<br /><br />About the taste? Oh man, my memories WEREN'T faulty. These are GOOD malted milk balls. These are worth eating. These are worth the calories. Well, perhaps on that last point. But they are truly good. The chocolate tastes like...good chocolate...not brown colored wax. The malted milk crunchy inside is tasty. And there's a LOT of chocolate on each malted milk ball, which is to say, not only do they use good chocolate, but they don't skimp on it, either.<br /><br />If you have ever thought you liked malted milk balls, but have wondered for years why...give these a try.

Perfect for drinking after a workout. Amazingly, they have no sugar and are pretty low in fat. You would never guess that from the taste.<br /><br />In comparison to the Chocolate, which doesn't taste that chocolaty, the Vanilla Ice Cream tastes just like it says. Creamy and it doesn't have that sweet aftertaste that sticks around like you get with shakes that have a lot of sugar.

review/summary: Best RTD on the market
review/text: I think hands down this is the best RTD on the market.  Have had no issues with "chunks" as on review states or with product separation.  Keeping it cold may help.  Also, if past expiration date for any reason, send it back.  Fast, convenient and tastes great.

review/summary: Fantastic Protein Shake
review/text: I have to rely on protein shakes to meet my protein quota of 80 grams a day.  I tell you this product makes it very easy to meet my goals.  IT TASTES GREAT!  I love Lean Body's shakes and this is the best of them all.  I usually would not reach for Vanilla flavored anything...just chocolate.  I tried this one because it was all that was left in the gym and now I know I had been missing out.  This is the best protein shake and ...it is filling, full of nutrition, and has 40g of protein.  It is low in carbs also.  I was once an EAS Advantedge user.  This has double the protein and taste.  Warning: the air bubbles that may form while you are drinking can make you feel like something is in your drink but it is just an air bubble.  Also, it tastes good when is served cold.

review/summary: Fantastic Tasting RTD
review/text: After doing some research on the best RTD Protein Shakes, I've come to the conclusion that Labrada's Lean Body is the best tasting RTD out there.  I was a fan of Muscle Milk, but Labrada tastes better and gives you more protein in a similar drink size.  I also like that the drink doesn't sit in your stomach.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of the price.  But if you're looking for a quick protein drink on the go, look no further.

review/summary: A great shake and a great value
review/text: Personal tastes vary, but this is one of my favorite ready-to-drink shakes. Lean Body shakes have the consistency of milk, are mixed well, and have only a minimal aftertaste. If you are a fan of really thick shakes, this probably won't appeal to you. If you are looking for a shake that provides a nice level of protein and vitamins for the price, this is a good choice. If you are looking for a post-workout shake, this is easily digested 15-25 minutes after a hard workout.

These shakes make dieting a lot more pleasant by reducing hunger and keeping your protein intake up, even while calories are reduced.

After all, it is protein - and if it gets too hot - (like when the delivery people leave it in the hot Sacramento sun in the summer) - it will clot.  I just called the company and they shipped out a replacement order.....no problem<br />Or, like the reviewer said.... just order the powdered version.

review/summary: Buy the powder instead
review/text: If you're loooking for a ready-to-drink shake, try a different brand. Over the course of two months I ordered two 12-packs of the Labrada shake. Delivery was prompt, but in both cases the whey protein and other solids in every carton had separated from the liquid, congealing into a chunk that couldn't be remixed by shaking the container for as long as a minute (as the manufacturer recommends.) In one instance, getting the contents out required slicing open the carton. Once the contents had been put into a blender, the shakes were satisfactory --- creamy. delicious and filling. But not RTD. If you're going to end up using a blender or shake bottle anyway, buy Labrada meal supplements in powdered form to begin with. I've found them equally tasty (although made with sugar,) equally nutritious and you'll be getting what you expected.

Amazon vowed to send me my REAL order the next day--when I received it, the box had been tampered with (mangled on the front corner)--I was short a bar-probably the original case they'd pulled the single bar out of! I couldn't believe it! All I wanted was a nice COMPLETE little box to give as a gift--this is embarrassing to give away. What a raw deal.

review/summary: Excellent Spice Blend (Deserves 10 Stars)
review/text: I have tried more than one spice blend from this company (via grocery store and their website) and thus far, it has never failed to be delicious. This particular one is probably my personal favorite. It is a little bit spicy but contrary to what many people believe about Thai cooking, it is NOT always outrageously hot. This has a spicy sweet kick to it. I'd rate it about a 5 on a one to ten heat index.<br /><br />  Try using this on chicken breasts that you are pan sauteing. Put your chicken breasts (boneless/skinless) in a hot frying pan that you have put about a tablespoon of oil into (can use cooking spray also). After one side has browned, flip it, add the seasoning blend, brown the other side, put on your plate and season that side. It goes wonderfully with rice noodles or brown rice. The seasoning itself also goes great IN the brown rice or stirred into the noodles. It's a great way to make a relatively low fat/low calorie meal taste outstanding.<br /><br />If you like this blend, you have to try their others! Deliciously Dill is also a personal favorite.

Was looking for someplace intellectually stimulating like my previous thrifty winter-avoidance trip to Yemen, but while the food was great even Chiang Mai was way too touristy so I gave up (perhaps too hastily?). The point is I know a little bit about Thai food and if I could give this blend six stars I would.<br /><br />Also, here are the ingredients from the label:<br />Sesame seeds, chile pepper, coriander, onion, red pepper, shrimp extract, garlic, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon oil.<br /><br />Shrimp extract?

review/summary: Subtle flavor and a few surprises
review/text: The pumpkin flavor is on the subtle side, but these noodles have an appealing golden tint and chewy texture even when slightly overcooked. The noodles are tangled together when dry, but are divided into four moderate size servings so you don't have to cook the entire box at once if you're cooking for one or two.<br /><br />Several things surprised me. After opening, the manufacturer suggests refrigerating any uncooked leftovers, which I have never done for dry pasta before, and the noodles are packed with an "oxygen absorber" packet that could easily end up in the cooking water if you're not careful. I was also slightly taken aback by the amount of calories (340) and sodium (830 mg or 35% of daily value) each not very large serving contains.<br /><br />The box suggests frying the noodles or adding them to soup. I tossed them with vegetables and a spicy sauce and they were very tasty.

review/summary: This does 50% of the hard work for your red sauce
review/text: The other 50% is to not do something stupid to ruin your otherwise delicious sauce, like make a red wine reduction using Yellow-Tail.<br /><br />Short review: Great stuff/best of its kind by far. No good reason not to use this unless you've got a ready supply of fresh veal-stock.<br /><br />I'm a hardcore foodie, but not a professional. My friends all think I should open a restaurant because I really can cook (when I'm motivated), but I'm too lazy for that.  I've learned the hard way how to make Demi-Glace and, frankly, it's a pain in the ass, not to mention expensive (Veal stock? Really?). But since I'm too narcissistic to make a dinner for friends that is nothing short of awesome (not to mention how competitive and snobby some of my friends are), I will practice/test/rehearse something to perfection before I'll share it.<br /><br />In search of the perfect red wine redux/sauce, I came across a friend who knew the chef for a restaurant in wine country that made one of the best Wagyu/Kobe filet dishes I've ever had that has stayed on their menu for years.  After two years, I finally met the executive chef and after a lot of drinking, he revealed to me that there are two ways to make a great demi-glace red wine sauce - the hard way, and the really really hard stupid way.  The really hard stupid way is to do it all from scratch, which if you know what Demi-Glace really entails, you had better have all the stock-making ingredients already on hand on a regular basis.<br /><br />Or you can use someone else's well designed, fine tuned reduction ready to go.<br /><br />I've tried several of the others and had varying success, but nothing that would sing out to you "yes, this is the real deal".  The other premade Demi-glace (or similar variations) I've tired were as if you were eating Select-grade sirloin when you were wanting to get Choice-grade rib-eye.  I always just assumed you just had to do a real demi-glace to get the real-deal result you needed.<br /><br />Then I came across this chef and he reluctantly told me that this was his "Secret ingredient".  So I tried it.  And now I'm a believer too.<br /><br />The best thing you can do to make sure this stuff works (eg, to not screw it up) is to use a quality wine in your reduction.  Don't use that 30 day old rancid yellow tail crap. Don't use 1 hour old Yellow-Tail. And if you drink Yellow Tail then you probably don't care about this product anyway.  I recommend adding something to bring up the sweet level, not to make it sweet per se, but as a seasoning agent - like a port or a cognac mixed in with a Cab, Merlot or anything in the Bordeaux family. The flavors will really sing at you.

review/text: This is simply the best ready prepared demi-glace you can buy.  I was disappointed when Amazon stopped selling this for a while, so I'm happy they brought it back.  This is a must-have for amateur chefs since so many classical sauces use it as the base.  There are a multitude of quick sauces you can make from this without the 2-3 days needed to prepare your own demi-glace base.  Worth the money if you want to make classical sauces without investing a lot of time in the kitchen.

Amazons price is less than half of what I was paying for this, it used to be a splurge and now will be a regular at our table. Used as a base, you can make many different sauces with ease, you'll be the hit at the table.

review/summary: A Must For any Cook
review/text: I have used all of More Than Gourmet's products, and this staple has to be my favorite, or at least my most used one.  I probably use this on a good 20% of all my main course recipes.<br /><br />There are two main reasons I am a fan.  The first is practical.  I now work overseas, and I need products with a good shelf.  Sure, I can ship via Amazon directly here, but I like to ship to my US address and then bring products with me on the plane.  And all of More Than Gourmet's products have extremely long shelf lives.  With the smaller 1.5 ounce packages, I use one as I need it and keep the rest in my small pantry.  And if I am going to a diner party where I will cook, it is so easy to bring an individual package. (I also buy the larger 16 ounce container as well, and keep it in the fridge after opening.)<br /><br />The second one, and this one is the most important, is that it tastes great.  It does not have that artificial aftertaste which I find in most powered demi-glace.  There is a richness in it which makes everything taste better. I not only use it in typically French-type dishes, but in Italian pasta sauces, all stews, some egg dishes, pot roasts, and even Mexican, Arabic, and Chinese dishes.<br /><br />Working in SE Asia, getting good beef is problematic and quite expensive.  But pork is good.  I have discovered that adding some of the demi-glace to a pork pot roast or to a bourguignon goes along way to make it richer and "beefier."<br /><br />Frankly, I could not do without my More Than Gourmet demi-glace.  It iis a must item in any cook's pantry.

review/text: I don't like all the controversy surrounding rawhide bones and don't want take the risk of my Lab getting a blockage so I exclusively give him Booda bones which are safe. My lab is an aggressive chewer and considering this is edible it makes him that much more excited as he LOVES food. He enjoys these bones but devours them in less than 20 minutes. I usually give it to him for a few minutes until he eats half of it and then I take it away to save for next time. This obviously would get very expensive so he has his non-edible Nylabones most of the time and these are special treats.

review/summary: Goodbye Rawhides! Hello Peace of Mind - & Dogs Love 'em!
review/text: Love these! Well, because...we have 3 dogs (2 were unplanned children ;-) & our 60-LB German Shepherd AND our 40-LB we-have-no-clue-what-she-is dog have both choked on various shapes & sizes of rawhides. The Shepherd choked so badly that, this time, it wouldn't come up. She couldn't cough & started to literally choke to death. I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do - the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway? Well, I tried anyway and thank God it finally did dislodge & we got it out! Was it the Heimlich? I don't know. Probably not. I mean, she still won't tell me... After all, I guess it was very traumatic for her.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, what I do know, is that was the last time any of my dogs have had any kind of regular rawhide bones! Which, I really wanted to let everyone know of my personal experiences; I believe anybody who is at all concerned about giving their dogs rawhides and/or experiencing a similar problem is on the right track to avoid them.<br /><br />Our small part Chihuawa/part something else, first 2 times in-a-row, threw up repeatedly w/rawhide pieces and w/foam. He was VERY sick the 3rd time, so we definitely stopped that! The ONLY kind I did finally take a chance with were granulated rawhide munchy sticks, & they're all fine w/these; though I'm still nervous about them choking on a piece, but neither of them have had any problems with Boodas so far, & they don't swell up in their throats like regular rawhides.<br /><br />So, now... It's Booda Bones!<br /><br />Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially for my 2 larger aggressive chewers. I agree with some other reviewers that they are not very long-lasting. But it's all I'll give them now. But, for my half Chihuahua/half something else(20lbs), I give him the smallest ones and they are like mega-saurus bones for him(it is my hope that the manufacturer will start selling these in bulk packages, for less $). I get 3 different sizes for my 3 different whatever-they-are-dogs. They absolutely love them! This includes the assorted flavors, the bacon-flavored, and the yogurt-flavored. Whichever is cheaper at the time and shipped by Amazon.<br /><br />And I owe a big thank you to Brian Amazon, all of you for all of your reviews, Booda Bones, and Amazon!<br /><br />** Confession: This was originally a comment I posted to a reviewer by the name of "Brian Amazon" a long time ago. I have been buying Bones from Amazon, and, only Booda Bones, ever since. They are so great that I've been wanting to write a review, & now finally have the chance to (I have, however, resorted to copying and pasting much of my original [brief... LOL] comment, with some editing).

review/summary: More of a treat then something to keep your dog busy.
review/text: Let me start by saying our dogs love these. As soon as they see the bag they stop whatever they're doing and run to their crates (where we typically give these to them). However, for our dogs these are definitely more of a treat then an activity. I have one dog who is an aggressive chewer who finishes these in under five minutes. He doesn't chew them as much as bite of chunks of it. My other dog isn't quite as strong of a chewer but it usually takes her just around fifteen minutes to eat the whole thing (this review is specific to the Biggest Boodas). So for my dogs this is less of a chewing experience and more of a treat. And when the eat them this quickly, they do get expensive quick.

You can't go wrong with these, they are reasonibly priced, safe, help reduce tartar, and dogs seem to love them.

review/summary: THE BEST!
review/text: I have a dog who until we adopted her never had oral care,so her teeth were in bad shape. We brush her teeth every 3 weeks and give her 1 booda bone weekly . Not only are her teeth cleaner but some of the staining has gone away. Our vet told us that these are the best thing for her because they digest easily and do not contain plastics.

review/summary: disappointed
review/text: These took FOREVER to ship and when they did arrive they were not as durable as advertized.  Was looking for a bone to keep our dogs busy, these were more like a snack.

review/summary: Where's the peach?
review/text: The taste of tangerine overpowers any peach flavor that may be in this tea.  We've only made iced tea, and we enjoy it, but I was really looking for a white tea with peach flavor.  The title is a bit misleading, since the tea also includes orange and tangerine.
