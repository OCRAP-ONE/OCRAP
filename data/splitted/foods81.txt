review/summary: Maple Syrup
review/text: This maple syrup is delicious and so flavorful -- Did you know grade B maple syrup has so many vitamins and minerals you could almost not feel guilty about having french toast for breakfast. I also try and use maple syrup where I can for sweetener instead of sugar. The company was wonderful about the shipping and the product arrived packaged well and on time! Enjoy.

review/summary: Very good syrup
review/text: This is only the second time I have ever tried grade B maple syrup. I liked this one better than Now Foods grade B. I think it has more maple flavor. I only give it 4 stars because of lack of experience compared to others. I think its priced well and it was shipped well.  I really love it on plain yogurt as well as pancakes and waffles. Would definetly buy again.

review/summary: yuck!
review/text: Normally I buy the Fruztio Freeze Dried Apricots made by Crispy Green Co. and they are DELICIOUS- but the store I was getting them from was out of stock for a very long time. So, I decided to try the cantaloupe since I like fresh cantaloupe...how bad could they be?<br />My only choice was a large multi-pack bag, so I forked up the money with high hopes.  I tore into the bag, appreciating the single serve sized bags inside. I opened one up and took a bite. Blech! yuck! These tasted like green, under-ripe canteloupe! I was hoping for that super sweet-I could eat this whole melon- sort of flavor....but no.<br />These were so bad that I threw the whole multi-pack away, and that's saying A LOT, because I'm very frugal with my food purchases. I just knew I would NEVER eat the rest of them. Wish I could give a better review, but i can't.<br />But I do recommend the apricots that I mentioned....they are super flavorful and delicious if you love that tart apricot flavor!

review/summary: Beware of Overpriced Items
review/text: In recent months I have become an Amazon.com Prime Fanatic.  Why? Because you can buy a lot of good stuff cheap (meaning "cost effective")and have it delivered in two days for free!  How can you hate that?  But, Beware!!<br /><br />As President Reagan once said "Trust but Verify". I have actually corrected his intent because I think he was trying to be too Politically Correct; that is "Distrust and Verify". You must ALWAYS shop and reshop, internet and retail, to see what makes Price Sense.<br /><br />To the point: I can buy the 40 Oz. (2-1/2 Lb.) bag of B&J Kona Blend coffee beans in the decorative bag for $16.99 (No Sales Tax in MA) at my local BJ's.  An aggressive Amazon.Com Marketplace Seller is offering the same item for $40.69 plus $8.24 shipping, $48.93 Total.  I will not dignify the sellers price by speculating what the profit margin might be or what the final Unit Price results in.  You be the judge. All I can say again is "Distrust and Verify".<br /><br />P.S.  I defend the right of a company to gouge their customers.  That's what Capitalism and America are all about.  Flip side is that others will see the gouging and decide to sell the same product for less money- that's also Capitalism and what we're all about.<br /><br />I would encourage readers to comment on my opinion.  Thank You.

review/summary: great detox tea
review/text: I have been using this for awhile now. Unfortunately the local stores where I used to buy this stopped carring it and I was able to find this deal on Amazon. I love this tea. I think it tastes great (I do prefer to drink herbal tea without much additions maybe a little organic cane sugar here and there or some almond milk or rice milk).<br /><br />When I was drinking one of these tea bags every day I felt great as I noticed a feeling of "well being" it was like many different body systems were working as they should be. I have been diagnosed with the genetic form of fatty liver and I have a lot of allergies. This tea really helps me. I take this tea in addition to the Himalaya Herbal Healthcare LiverCare for LIver Support (aka Liv.52). I take the LiverCare once daily by mouth. Between one of these tea bags daily and one pill by mouth of the LiverCare...I feel great.

When we went out shopping, we happened upon the local health foods supermarket and went inside.<br /><br />I thought I could find a milk thistle tea that could help me. None could be found. I saw the Triple Leaf Detox Tea and figured it couldn't hurt, so I bought.<br /><br />I was amazed at how well it helped. My allergic reactions have nearly gone away. It has worked better than the any of the meds I've used to counter them previously.

review/summary: Incredible face mask too
review/text: I've been having trouble w/my skin lately and thought this tea might help. I steeped one tea bag for a few minutes just to wet the leaves and then tore it open. I combined the wet tea leaves w/one teaspoon plain organic yogurt and spread the mix on my face. I soaked a washcloth in the hot tea water and when it was cool enough, placed it over my face and relaxed for 30 min. My skin feels so much better in just one application; much less irritated and it feels moisturized and calm. I highly recommend giving this a try for anyone who might have acne and have "tried everything." If you don't want the mess and might be having a breakout in just one small area, simply place a warm teabag on your skin without removing the insides and let it sit for 15-20 minutes. Of course, drink the tea as well to cleanse from the inside out.

review/summary: Actually surprised that it is this good.
review/text: I was not expecting much from this tea. After all there are literally dozens of products out there each day claiming to be magical cure-all. So, does this detox tea work? I have no medical training other than first aid, but I will say that I do feel refreshed after drinking it. I have tried it hot, warm, cold, sweetened (with honey) and unsweetened. The tea has a very light chai flavor to it, which I enjoy. But I have to say that around $20 for 120 bags (about .60 per bag) that if you are not a fan of tea then I would have to say that this is not for you when you can go to the grocery store and buy plain old tea (that also has 'detox' properties to it) for around $5 for the same quantity. But for something different from the usual, which what I was looking for, I have to say I am pleased.

review/text: after reading the other reviews, i'm confused and don't think that anyone was talking about THIS TEA! (sounded like most comments pertained to prince of peace green tea, and don't have anything to do with the instant dong quai and red date tea that i clicked on...that being said, this is a remarkable tea...it's delicious, it's instant (so you don't have to wait for it to steep) and it's really good for you...i just love the taste of this, but then again - i enjoy the uniquely-bitter flavor of dong quai (but this isn't bitter, it's yummy!)...for those who don't know, dong quai is considered to be "ginseng for women" beceause it's very high in vit B12 and helps to keep women from becoming anemic (due the their monthly cycle)...it also is said to help regulate irregular periods, when used on a daily basis...that said, this tea is special because it helps to "draw one's energy" downwards (and the red date, adds to this effect in that red is the color of the 1st chakra)...in other words, this tea has aphrodisiac qualities and will create pleasnt feelings when taken before bed (and it's "good for you" and it tastes good and it's a snap to make)...so what's there to be quibbling about?

review/summary: After at least a year drinking this tea, some thoughts.
review/text: My household has this tea stocked up at all times.. not to say it's my favorite tea, but it's my favorite day to day tea. We tend to drink Green Tea for its health benefits and as Green Teas go this one is affordable and fairly high quality for tea bag types. A few notes.. you have to be fairly careful about steeping this tea, it doesn't have a whole lot of tolerance from "crisp and delicious" to "overpowering and slightly off-putting". I guess I attribute that to the freshness of the tea. I'm not sure. I've had a lot different results with loose tea in a ball and some herbal teas. While this tastes good when you get it right, if you forget the cup for a few minutes, it's not forgiving. That said, that's the only real drawback to this tea. Yes. I've had teas I would rate five stars, six if I could. Yes, they also cost 5-6x more than this easily for a quarter of the amount of tea. Bottom line, if you drink a lot of tea, this is a good brand to buy. If you don't drink a whole lot and would rather buy something really high quality for the few times you do partake of it, I'd look elsewhere.

review/summary: Good tea, very gingery
review/text: This tea has a wonderfully strong ginger flavor.  The bags come individually wrapped in foil packets.  It steeps fast and the resulting mug of tea is murky and delightfully aromatic.  I love it and will undoubtedly use every bag in the next month or so.  The one thing I think anyone buying this product should be aware of is that they add stevia to the bags.  I am usually not a fan of stevia (to me it has a bitter aftertaste) but it was not overwhelming here.

review/summary: Good tea wish it came in loose tea too.
review/text: I am sensitive to Caffeine and supposedly the White teas have 1/3 approx. what Black teas contain. And about half of what the green teas contain. This probably varies all over the place however. Often a decaf tea isn't. If you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks. I find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas. My husband and I can't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it's astringent properties. But we temper that with milk or 100% Cranberry Juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered. Good both hot or iced. Looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags. Look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the Prince of Peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable. I hope they don't up the price just because everyone else's white tea is higher. I wish it was available in a loose tea too. A smooth flavored good tasting tea that reminds me of teas I had as a child and at Chinese restaurants. Beats anything I can buy in local supermarkets.<br /><br />I did try the organic version and no way. This one is better for some reason. Stronger and overall a better product even the bag it'self is better than the organic's.

review/summary: Wrong Product wrong Name
review/text: Gold Prince has made a terrible mistake.  There are two products.  COLDAID and FLUAID.  THey are different formulary.  Unfortunately they display Fluaid picture on the Amazon website and their own website but the words are COLDAID.  THere is a separate product for Coldaid.  Regardless -- if you order the FLUAID on AMAZON you will get the COLDAID...the picture is not the product...the words under the drop down menu are worthless...as they all default to the same product COLDAID.  If you want FLUAID, which is the superior product, don't buy it from AMAZON or off of the sellers website.  It is a mistake.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002P936UK/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title

review/summary: Bought at my local supermarket
review/text: I found this in the organic aisle at my local supermarket.  $[...] for one box of 100 opposed to 3 boxes being sold here with no shipping or waiting.  I would just like to know if anyone knows if this is a good quality for being a bagged tea.  I'm not a Pu-erh expert and I am looking for something as authentic as I can get without paying an arm and a leg.  Can anyone suggest a good quality??  The only reason I gave this a 3 is because it is something you can find at your supermarket without buying a pack of 3.

I would not give this product a single star; it deserves zero stars in my opinion.<br />This tool is not allowing me to continue without giving the product at least one star.

review/summary: Delicious, worth the money
review/text: I wanted a candy that would last me more than 5 seconds and wouldn't double my weight over the course of eating it. Caramel apple pops fit the bill perfectly: 60 calories, and they last long enough to satisfy my sweet tooth!<br /><br />I went looking for these in local grocery stores and couldn't find them, but luckily Amazon saved the day. The pops came in the packaging that is shown in the picture but (as another reviewer pointed out) they look like they were home made. The pops vary in size, shape and mixture. However, it didn't really bother me and unless you NEED perfectly shaped pops with just the right combination of caramel and hard candy, I doubt it will bother you either.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended! Just wish stores would start carrying these again!<br /><br />BTW, here's the nutrition information in case you want it:<br />Calories - 60, Total Fat - 1g, Sodium - 15mg, Total Carbs - 15g, Sugars - 10g, Calcium - 2%

review/text: These were local during Halloween and then we couldn't find them. Of course they were here at Amazon. They look like they were made in your kitchen as they are not uniform in shape or size, but they are amazingly good. It's like going to the fair and getting a tart green apple covered in yummy caramel. They last a really long time which is good as they are 60 calories each, but they stop me from wanting a 300+ calorie desert so they're a good deal. I do find myself smiling while I have one; they make you feel like a kid.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DNJTQI">Tootsie Roll Caramel Apple Pops 48 count</a>

review/summary: Inaccurate Product Description!!!
review/text: I ordered this product thinking it was going to come in a box of 24 (as it is described in the product description). I was a little unsure of whether or not this could be too good to be true, but when I saw that the weight of the item was marked as 6.1 lbs and the shipping/handling was $8 I felt pretty confident that I would be receiving the 24 count box that I thought this to be. When I received the package there was only ONE bone in it. So pretty much I spent $10 on ONE bone that I could have gotten at the store for $3. Dont make the same mistake as me! VERY poor product description by Ozbo!

review/text: Bel Paese Cheese is an excellent soft Italian cream cheese.  These medallions arrived in excellent condition and were allowed to rest for a day under refrigeration.  The taste, while a bit bland, was very good and was spreadable on water wafer crackers.  The ordering process through Amazon.com was a troubling and difficult to complete, but the shipping was relatively quick.  I would recommend this product.

review/text: This is the best tasting cereal I have ever had in my entire life!  We eat it nearly every day for breakfast, usually adding a half a banana and some chopped up walnuts.  Some of my family even put blueberries on it!  I would never do that!  I occasionally buy it at Sam's or Costco (usually while traveling) but it ends up cheaper here at Amazon, especially with the wonderful Subscribe and Save option.  My shipments magically arrive!  One thing to note - you must keep your granola refrigerated to make it last - especially if you buy this 6 pack!  The oils will go rancid if you store it in a warm location.  This goes for nuts and seeds too!

review/summary: Excellent Organic Granola Cereal for All
review/text: Pros:  flax seeds, organic, fiber, pumpkin seeds, taste!<br />Cons:  price<br /><br />Yum.  I used to avoid granola cereals because they were hard to chew.  A friend visited, brought a box of Nature's Path Pumpkin Flax Granola, and forgot to take it when he left.  So, I tried it.  I was hooked immediately.  Not only was it tasty, but it wasn't jaw-breaking hard.  It wasn't mush either.  Perfection.<br /><br />The only problem with this cereal is the price.  For someone on a fixed income trying to eat right, it's expensive.  It is hard to find it for less than $4-5/box and that's just too much for me to spend on a small box of cereal.  I bought this bulk package from Amazon when it was on a super sale, but on accident I didn't hit auto renew and the price went back up.  When it goes back down I'll renew, but until then it's other places that are cheaper.  These are Fred Meyer in bulk and Trader Joe's ($2.89/box).  The best price is Fred Meyer.<br /><br />Make sure that you chew the cereal good.  The flax seeds are whole.  If they enter the body whole, they EXIT whole as well, and that means you get zero nutrient from them.  So, chew it up!<br /><br />It's EXCELLENT with So Delicious Coconut Milk, a non-dairy, non-soy drink.  I just use it for this cereal.  I have stomach problems and this combo is one of the few things during the day that doesn't ache me.

review/text: We have bought this gyro meat several times. It's good and since we don't have a greek deli for almost 60 miles, it's as good as we can get for now. My problem is the shipping. Yes it has to go by next day air, that is fine, but we'd buy 4 or 5 loafs if they would combine shipping. But they do not. It's $50/loaf shipping. I know it does not cost much more to send 5 as it does 1. Other than that, it's good meat.<br /><br />Note: this is the sliced version. It's sliced very thin. Too thin for my tastes, but others love it. I prefer to buy the load and carve thicker pieces.<br /><br />Either way it's good, but we can only afford it for special occasions due to the price of shipping and the lack of combining shipping options. They really need to add this item to prime program.

review/summary: Have ordered before but this shipment was unusable
review/text: The 4 pounds of sliced meat itself are contained in a single cardboard box; no vacuum seal or even plastic wrap.  That box is placed in another box that is lined with styrofoam sides, styrofoam peanuts, and three frozen "ice" paks.  It was shipped FedEx 2 Day (that's what the label says), not Overnight or next business day, which begs the question, what exactly did the $52 in shipping charges for 4 lbs of meat and minimal packing materials actually go towards?  I think I know, and it wasn't shipping.<br /><br />Years ago "Grecian Delight" (the brand on the box) was sold in a local supermarket chain in Gyro Kit boxes - each contained a pack of sliced gyro meat, one pita, and a small container of tzatziki sauce.  I loved them, but I haven't seen the kits in decades and was happy to find a way to once again stock the freezer with gyros-in-waiting.<br /><br />The gyro meat itself, which I have ordered before, tastes just like ... gyro meat!  As I said, I love gyros, but there's no place nearby where I can drop in and enjoy one.  So I have ordered the product in the past, but in this case, I've ordered for the last time.<br /><br />I've gotten the individual 1 lb vacuum packets before 3 at a time and they've arrived frozen or nearly frozen. Not so this box.  The meat was not only thawed, it was only slightly cool. I'm afraid I'm going to be throwing it out.  Too risky.  For $52 shipping charges, it should have arrived in perfect condition. Overnight. I won't make this mistake again.  I can't afford to.

review/summary: Gyros Anytime!
review/text: I love a great gyros platter, but there aren't many Greek restaurants/pizzarias where I live.  So I was excited to see this offered here!  The meat was still frozen when it arrived, and the styrofoam-lined shipping box can be reused, ice packs and all.  I bought it pre-sliced, and the slices separate easily from each other in the box so you can keep it frozen and just use a little at a time.  My only complaint is that I like thicker slices; but in terms of flavor, well, I challenge you to make it at home yourself and have it taste this good.  I have a feeling I will keep a box of this on hand from now on.  One note:  the box does not contain heating instructions.  I tried it in the broiler and over-browned it.  I wish I had read the instructions here before that first attempt!

I have tried other 100-calorie things and it is like you get some pitiful amount, but the popcorn seems like a real treat!<br /><br />I see it is currently out of stock and not available for subscribe and save :(  I hope they get more because it is really the most tasty/buttery flavored of the brands I have tried.

review/summary: Cheaper Price - But Popcorn Older and Stale
review/text: Pop Secret is by far my favorite popcorn and I eat about 2 bags a day. I normally get the homestyle, but is was always to dry when I ordered on line so I went to the Butter thinking it wouldn't be so dry. No such luck. When I buy from the grocery store it is much more flavorable and fresh and it doesn't cost that much more. I checked the dates and the store vs online bulk was about 6 months different on average which probably causes the difference even though they both are in the sale by date range. with this said, I am going to have to discontinue buying this product online unless something changes and I'll really miss it coming straight to my door since I eat so much. I waited for 3 months of getting this product before posting because any company can have a bad batch of anything. Sorry. I hope this changes in the future!!

So now I can have a healthy organic warm bowl of comforting soup whenever I like and if I purchase it through amazon by the case, shipping is free making it a lot less expensive then my local market.  Give it a try!

review/summary: no salt soup ad says no cholesterol; the facts are different.
review/text: This is for the Health Valley Tomato Soup No Salt Added, 15 Ounce Cans (Pack of 12).  I purchased this specifically for a person with heart problems.  One of the problems with canned foods is too much sodium, so the No Salt Added is a good feature.  Another problem is cholesterol content.  The ad for this product states 0 mg cholesterol, which is a false statement.  Apparently the supplier did not update the ad when Health Valley changed their recipe for their No Salt Tomato soup and is now adding cholesterol.  The cans I received have a "NEW" on the label, which the can shown in the ad does not.  This is an honest mistake on the seller's part, but he should correct it, and he should list the true contents.

It's definitely not like Kraft nor Road's End, but there's something distinctly cheese-like about it and I found it to be delicious!  I added both peas and broccoli and was pleasantly suprised to find that the cheese sauce was plentiful enough for all of the pasta, peas, and broc.  I also must say, as my first time trying to cook gluten-free pasta on my own, this was painless and didn't crumble apart (like it could have).  I gave it 4 stars, not quite perfect, but definitely a great treat (every once in awhile, for those of us on a budget).

review/summary: Over priced but really good.
review/text: I really like this Namaste Foods "Say Cheez" gluten free, vegan macaroni and cheese style dinner. It's not Kraft Mac & Cheese but I like it a lot better than Kraft! It's zesty and peppery and it does taste like cheese.<br /><br />I thought that the 3 tablespoons of oil they say to mix the "cheez" sauce with was excessive.  I used one teaspoon of oil and 1/2 cup of the cooking water I reserved from the pasta and let it simmer while stirring for a few minutes to thicken.  Then I added the pasta and green beans that I cooked with the pasta.  It was really tasty!  The macaroni, which was a nice texture and cooked up beautifully, has ridges to hold the sauce.  Do not over cook the pasta though, it needs maybe 8 1/2 or 9 minutes.<br /><br />It's just way too expensive.  I really think Namaste Foods could make money and still price this much better to be affordable for the average person.  No need to price gouge people who have food sensitivities and parents who have children with Celiac Disease.  I know this type of product costs more to produce because of the need for a dedicated facility and the special ingredients but your prices are ridiculous.<br /><br />Most families are on a strict budget especially in these days of poor economy and job losses.  Even on Subscribe & Save this product was almost $4 a bag!  Come on Namaste Foods.  You don't understand the meaning of "Namaste" if you charge such exorbitant prices.

review/text: When we found out my daughter has celiac disease, we were on the hunt for a reasonable mac&cheese. We tried everything we could fine. This was one of the worst. The cheese flavor was pretty bad. I took one bite and had to spit it out. My daughter didn't like it either. I am keeping a spreadsheet of items we tried so we don't waste our money on it again in the future. The best mac&cheese we found was Annie's rice pasta and cheese.
