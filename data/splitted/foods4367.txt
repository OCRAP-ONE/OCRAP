review/summary: Exactly as expected
review/text: This is my first batch of goji berries and I have not been disappointed.  I put a heaping tablespoon in my morning protein shake and my husband puts them in his oatmeal.  I haven't notice any smell, but I also haven't stuck my nose into the bag.  They give my shake (smoothie) a slightly sweeter pleasant taste.  I will definitely buy them again.  I do a lot of healthy things, so I can't say that I get a boost from them or anything like that, but I have noticed that I'm having lunch later than usual, so the added protein might be making the shake more filling.

review/text: I liked <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFPL1I">Navitas Naturals Sun Dried Incan Golden Berries, 16 oz</a> and decided to try these. Frankly, I don't think I'll be buying more. They don't have much of a taste, but solo feel quite revolting to me - the texture is unpleasantly rough and the smell/taste remind me of hay.<br />On the plus side, the weak taste means they blend well into smoothies.

review/summary: After taste Goji Berries
review/text: I was really excited to try something new and healthy and after hearing Doctor Oz rave about them i decided to give them a whirl. First off, I blame myself b/c I should have noticed how many ounces I was really ordering but I didn't and soon wound up with an overload of Goji's! As soon as I opened the bag the odd aroma seeped out and it was less than pleasant. I was expecting an acidic or sweet aroma but out came an earthy, scent. The scent was tolerable compared to the taste! The taste is awful and leaves a bitter aftertaste that is hard to remove! If you want the health benefits I suggest a pill form unless you don't mind choking down a few berries!

review/summary: Not as good as the one sold at wholefoods
review/text: I brought Navitas goji berries at wholefoods a few times. They are drier than the those I got from amazon. I agreed with some of the reviewers that some of goji berries in this bag tasted kinda funny! But i assure you that the one I got from wholefoods tasted much better. um....not sure why there is the difference. Same brand....the only reason I decided to buy from amazon is the price. Wholefoods sells this 8oz bag at ~$11 while amazon sells at $16 for 2 pks. I will continue to buy my goji berries, because they are good sources of vitamin A and they taste good to me. But I will go back to wholefoods instead.

review/summary: Chewy pellets provide fruity flavor
review/text: I have bought several brands, always "organic", these seem to be the freshest and least dry of the bags I have tried. I like them after lunch, without soaking, just for something sweet. I chew them one at a time to try to get the most flavor and to chew them well to get all the nutrients. They taste similar to other dried berries, but initially I thought they were a little bitter with an after taste like other reviewers have noted. My first bag lasted over 3 months, the second bag over a month opened (maybe that was the problem?). I no longer experience that, not sure why, now they taste great and I look forward to them and each a bag in about 5 days or so. If they really have all those antioxidants, they are worth the price!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFLHSY">Navitas Naturals Organic Goji Berries Himalayan Superfruit, 16-Ounce Pouch</a> this brand seems to be the best so far for me...

I actually incorporated these into a dried fruit compote recipe not long ago (soaked the berries in merlot - had a bottle open) with some apricots with organic honey.... YUM!<br /><br />Vitamin content is good.  Snacking fruit these are not - I like 'em for that though.  Troubling that a review from 4 years ago is still on top.<br /><br />'Wolfberry' as these are known naturally are a good health food.

review/text: I've been getting these berries for years.  The second to the last bag I had I noticed had a foul odor - very strong, very chemical, not at all appealing.  I gave them a second chance and when the most recent bag had the same order I cancelled by "subscribe and save" automatic order.  I strongly doubt they are organic if they come from China (then why are we paying the price for "organic"?) and if the smell is any indication they likely have been sprayed with chemicals.  I'll be looking for another source (and will try growing my own too).

review/summary: Gross!
review/text: These berries are just gross. When I opened the bag, the odor turned me off immediately. Also, they aren't just dry, but rather like small stones. They made me think of the stuff you put in the bottom of fish tanks. Again, not something I was looking forward to eating.<br /><br />Their texture is again very dry. They feel like small pebbles in my hand. After tossing them into my mouth, and crunching a bit, they are very juicy. I'm not sure if I like the flavor because I'm thrown off by the nasty after taste, like grain. I don't know if you've ever smelled rabbit food or grain for horses. (I grew up with horses.) This is what the stuff smells like to me. Moreover, I imagine had I tried grain, it would taste like that: grain and berries. Gross.<br /><br />I got the pack of two so I could give a pouch to my sister-in-law for Christmas. I hope she likes the berries. Perhaps they would be better in smoothies, but I'm reluctant to try.<br /><br />If they didn't have the funky after taste, I'd like them better. Oh, and the smell. Gross.

review/summary: Fresh light scent, works well & no stinging sensation as with Nizoral
review/text: My husband and I both occasionally use the new Clear Haircare products but for different reasons.  He wanted to try this since he now wears suits much more often to work and wanted to make sure he had no stray flakes visible.  Skin flakes build up for a variety of reasons and many people run straight to the anti-fungal shampoos such as  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000Y3CRY">Nizoral Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, 4 oz.</a> which is formulated to deal with only dandruff caused by a common fungal infection of the scalp.  It is appropriate if that's the case but expensive and stings both your scalp and burns your eyes which can be inconvenient.  My husband merely has dry scalp since we live in Los Angeles under very dry conditions.  He found this new Clear Men Scalp Therapy shampoo to be gentle enough for every day use and that a very little amount will clean his just below the ears, curly but conservative hairstyle.  In fact, he says it rinses cleaner than many other shampoos we have product tested that claim to moisturize the scalp in order to prevent flakes.<br /><br />My husband liked the refreshingly light Mint scent that didn't overpower his other toiletry products and has found that using this as his new daily shampoo is saving us money.  It doesn't seem to strip his hair of its own natural oils so he doesn't need to use heavy duty conditioners.  We're more than pleased with the new formulation.  The flake-zapping ingredient is the Pyrithione Zinc but the addition of traditional used Tea Tree Oil as  a natural anti-fungal and anti-bacterial  is safer than the ingredients in Coal Tar Shampoos or Shampoos such as Nizoral.  The latter product relies on formerly prescription strength antifungal Ketoconazole.  If you do not in fact have the Fungal infection that Ketoconazole is intended to combat, you could actually be ruining your chances of that solution working should you become infected with the highly common fungus that lives on our bodies naturtally and sometimes grows out of control due to health issues or too-frequent shampooing with harsh detergent type shampoos.<br /><br />Clear Men Scalp is a terrific down the middle choice at a good price point!  Highly recommended!  However, if you truly do suffer from the common fungal cause of serious flakes, you will need to eradicate the cause with a product like Nizoral and perhaps discuss it with your Primary Care Physician as well.  If your scalp is merely dried out from too frequent washing, this is a nice mild shampoo when used in moderation.  It works well and you may find that soon you can even skip shampooing to every other day and merely rinsing your hair clean of common pollutants, dirt and sweat that build up during the day and saving a good washing for the second day.  When my husband first noticed his scalp was overly dry, limiting his shampooing to every other day was the recommendation he got from his doctor.  However, he finds this shampoo, used in small amounts, gets the job done without stripping his hair.  he also now uses their conditioner.<br /><br />I used the shampoo on my own long hair "Ethnic hair" but found I was better off sticking to the same company's new Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty line of nourishing products for Women of Color or even fair skinned women who simply have textured, dry hair and dry scalp  in need of proper nourishment and moisture protection such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9E2">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a> and the shampoo and nourishing hair Oil that goes with it.  Clear and all its products are passing muster in our household!  Rack up another win for them with their new line for men!  For more information on their line Google their website using the terms: Clear Haircare and their wbsite will show up under that name smooshed together.  We can't list outside websites in reiviews anymore.  They have several other lines for all types of women too so give them a look!

review/text: This is a great shampoo.  This creamy smooth product leaves your hair super manageable, and it really works for me to eliminate dandruff.  My only criticism is that the label indicates that it contains mint, and that it is refreshing.  I can neither smell or feel the presence of mint.  I have a shampoo from Paul Mitchell that is called Tea Tree and it really feels great on the scalp.  I wish this product had enough mint in it to give a similar experience.

review/summary: Better than Head & Shoulders
review/text: I've used Head & Shoulders and the Walgreens white-label anti-dandruff shampoo products for a long time and not really been enamored with either, mainly due to the scent and variable success at eliminating dandruff. I've tried this over the last week and think it's an improvement on what I had been using. The lid is well designed, making it easy to open in the shower, and the scent is much more pleasant too. Best of all it does seem quite successful in eliminating dandruff so I think I'm going to convert to this brand. As another reviewer commented, it's pricey but these products usually are.

review/summary: A refreshing type of clean
review/text: This shampoo is marketed for men, which basically means it has more of a masculine scent and is designed for men's hair. This shampoo by Clear has a very pleasant smell. The shampoo is made with a combination of tea tree, natural mint, ginseng and a very subtle hint of coconut. Theses fragrances combined really promote an appealing aroma, without being too over bearing. It is also designed as an anti-dandruff product, I don't have dandruff, didn't have it before this product and don't have it as I type this. I guess it works.<br /><br />The shampoo itself looks like glue but works in very well into hair and suds up wonderfully. It should be respected that with this product, a little goes a long way. My hair felt very clean and refreshed after using this shampoo, I attribute that to the mint. Oh and never fear, this product will not leave your scalp feeling like you rubbed Vicks vapor rub on your head. I have used a hair product that had mint in it and that was the result. This is not the case here. Overall a great product that I could see myself using again.

review/summary: It Works & Is A Bargain!
review/text: Five dollars for 12.9 ounces of shampoo struck me as being an awfully good deal.  I do have dandruff, so I had nothing to lose.  As far as the ginseng, mint and other natural items, there is a fresh smell but nothing seems truly pungent.  It is a subtle smell with no lingering smell after rinse.  I was also surprised at how little it takes to use.  It is very concentrated and instead of a foamy lather, you obtain a creamy lather.  After one week and wearing the same dark or darker shirts I normally wear, I saw little evidence of dandruff on my clothes.  I even wash my goatee with it now and when I rub it, there are no more tiny flakes.  I'd say this company and product will go far.  This is a very good bargain.

review/text: I suffer from mild dandruff. I can keep it under control by using a typical Pyrithione Zinc (1.0%) shampoo every other day. This product is no different to me as it uses the same proven active ingredient and drives the same positive results.<br /><br />Pros: This one has a nice/strong minty scent and does create a nice/slight tingle when using. It washes clean and I've had zero flakes while using the bottle.<br />Con: The bottle is a pain to open and when it is nearly empty it is a pain to get the last bit of shampoo out of it.<br />Bigger con: The cost per ounce vs. some of the competing products is high. Nothing comes close to 40 ounce pump bottle of Head & Shoulders from Costco.

review/text: This shampoo has a nice,  light scent and I like it much better than Head and Shoulders. (Yes, I am a woman and I have used it). My hair was very clean and bouncy. Controlled my mild dandruff very well. My husband has a more moderate case and found this shampoo to be beneficial as well. The bottle is sturdy and the unique design has the bottom  click open for greater control (no water can get in either!). We will be buying this again!

review/summary: Good, gentle shampoo that smells a little too much like bubble gum
review/text: I used to have serious dandruff problems.  Fortunately, those have passed for the most part.  Now my issues are only minor, but the Clear Men shampoo resolved the little I had left.  It's kind of weird to describe a shampoo as soft, seeing as it's a liquid and therefore would be regardless, but it just feels very very soft.  It doesn't make your hair any softer, but it's pleasant to use.  It also cleans very well and is gentle so it won't damage your hair.  (At least, that's been my experience.)  The only downside is the smell.  It's not bad by any means, but the scent is reminiscent of bubble gum.  If you like that, you're good to go.  I'd prefer something a little more subtle.  That said, everything is else great.  It's a very reasonably-priced, functional, good shampoo.

review/text: I like this stuff and I've already bought another bottle.  I don't have dandruff or flakiness, but I do have itchiness and hair that breaks off.  After using this for a couple weeks straight I noticed that the itchiness on my scalp stopped.  I also noticed that my hair was no longer breaking off and in fact is stronger and fuller.  I highly recommend this for men whether or not you have dandruff or not as they seem to use ingredients in this that are more appropriate and effective for men.  I often will leave it in my hair for 1-3 minutes as well so that my scalp as an opportunity to asborb it.

review/text: I was using a different product and my scalp was irritated, red, and flaky. This felt like a milder, calming version that cut back on those symptoms. There is a slight tingle, but it is less irritating. The smell is also nice which is a huge plus. If you have an irritated scalp I would highly recommend this product.

review/summary: OOOhh!  Tingly!
review/text: Let's cut to the chase:  The active ingredient in this shampoo is Pyrithione Zinc (1.0%).  It is the same active ingredient and concentration as another popular anti-dandruff shampoo, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GCY2PG">Head & Shoulders Classic Clean Dandruff Shampoo with Pump 33.8 Fluid ounce</a>.  If Head & Shoulders works for you, so will CLEAR.<br /><br />Why, then, buy CLEAR?  It's got a whole host of botanical additives including ginseng (who knew your hair could be more ALERT?), tea tree, natural mint (more on this one below), vitamins B5 and E, sunflower, soybean, almond and coconut oils.  Sound delish, but don't mistake this for an ice cream topping.  How much of these additives actually make some sort of positive difference for your hair, well, who knows?  One thing I have found, though, is the addition of natural mint may make your scalp tingle.  If you leave this shampoo in for a few minutes, you may notice a tingly sensation eminating from your scalp.  It's pretty cool and quite invigorating first thing in the morning.  Does it actually make one's hair more lively?  Unlikely, but it feels GREAT.  If you want to spend a little more and get a super shot of tingly scalp check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002F34YG6">American Crew Daily Stimulating Conditioner, 33.8 Ounce</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4CXTC">American Crew Citrus Mint Cooling Conditioner 33.8oz</a>.  (Now there's a dramatic jump start for your scalp.)<br /><br />Overall, I've been very happy with the aroma, feel, and dandruff-control effectiveness of this shampoo.

review/summary: Very good anti-dandruff shampoo!
review/text: I have used many types of Dandruff shampoos - mostly Head & Shoulders brands or pharmacy store equivalent generics. This product works just as well, if not better than those shampoos at eliminating dandruff, plus is smells a whole lot nicer and left my hair feeling a bit lighter. I've been using this product (and others of the same variety but with different fragrances) for two months, now, and can honestly say that it is the best anti-dandruff shampoo I have ever used.

review/summary: Lathers well, cleans nicely, smells good
review/text: I've been using this new "Clear" product each day for about two weeks.  Before using this product, I used one very similar to it for about 3 weeks: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JT7AEY">CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY 2 in 1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner, Clean & Refresh, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a>.  Honestly, I can't really tell the difference.  I guess the other one was formulated to fight dandruff more, which I used to have, but that has not been an issue for me for some time now.  Before using the "Clear" products, I used to use Head & Shoulders.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Nice design for the bottle; dispenses cleanly without leaving a mess on the bottle (H&S can clump up over time, and their caps are not as easy to use as the Clear product)<br />- Smells clean, not too strong (H&S has an OK smell to it too in my opinion)<br />- cleans well (I have oily hair, and Clear cleans it well, and does so quickly)<br />- lathers up nicely! (I'd say it lathers up better than H&S)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- the only issue with this product is that a small amount of it leaked out in shipping.  That was not the product's fault, but be aware that buying a liquid anything, and having it shipped to you, might leak.  In all fairness, I don't blame Amazon or the product's packaging for the leak, and for the small mess that I had to clean up, things just sometimes happen during shipping, it's a risk we all face when we purchase this way<br /><br />Interesting:<br />- I will say that this shampoo feels and looks a bit like Elmer's(r) glue when you put a little in your hand; sort of fun!

It's a lighter feeling shampoo that doesn't seem to weigh hair down and rinses away well.

review/text: My husband has a dandruff problem and uses Head and Shoulders so when amazon offered this product I said why not give it a try. It might actually work. And guess what? It actually does. It's much cheaper than Head and Shoulders and smells great as well. I very rarely give 5 stars on Vine products but this one does deserve its 5 stars. We've mostly grown up with the impression that cheap stuff rarely works but in this case this isn't true. After using it for close to 2 weeks (not on a daily basis) his dandruff is not as prominent as it once was. He's decided to scrap H&S and stick with this for now.

review/summary: Clear Men Scalp Therapy does it again!
review/text: After using H&S for many years I thought it was high time to try something else and see if I couldn't improve my current shampoo situation. Clear Men Scalp Therapy sounded interesting so I figured "what the heck" ! You get almost 11 ounces in this bottle which is a bit less than my current brand.<br /><br />The bottle is easy to grasp and manage in the shower without becoming slippery from the water and opening is a breeze thanks to the push down lid. I found that while the consistency of this shampoo seemed a bit thin to me, very little was actually needed to achieve a full head of suds and to clean my overly oily hair and scalp.<br /><br />After using Clear Men Scalp Therapy for 45 days I can happily report at least the same dandruff reducing results as I got my my mainstay Head and Shoulders. But since the shampoo is apparently more concentrated, I used less and it actually rinsed out faster.<br /><br />I wanted to try the Clean & Refresh variety and it feels both great to use and leaves a nice subtle scent. As with all my other Clear shampoo products this will leave your hair thoroughly cleaned but not oily feeling. Plenty of lather and an easy rinse off are what I have found to be the case with all the Clear shampoos I have tried so far.  (I have tried AND used 3 varieties) They all smell good and not overpowering and they ALL get my hair very clean.<br /><br />Basically all the varieties of Clear I have used employ a varying special formulation that includes tea tree among other ingredients. Some with conditioner, some without. Now I am no expert but honestly my hair is much more manageable after a weeks use of Clear brand shampoo as opposed to H&S and the anti dandruff ingredients do the trick 100%!  Give it a try! I like it, maybe you will too.

review/summary: Just Right
review/text: The Clear Men Scalp Therapy Anti-Dandruff Shampoon Clean & Refresh works as advertised.  The fragrance is pleasant but not overly deafening like many of the new shampoos that have come out in recent years.  I've used Head & Shoulders for years and this one works just as well, perhaps a little better, no flakes so far.<br /><br />What I really like about it is that with a small amount one can generate a great deal of lather, which makes washing one's hair far easier, and this also makes the bottle last much longer than the competition.<br /><br />As far as the refreshing feeling it's supposed to generate, it is indeed invigorating, unlike other anti-dandruff brands that claim the same but actually produce a burning sensation instead.  This one is clearly designed for those of us who have more chemically sensitive scalps.<br /><br />Design wise the bottle's quite utilitarian, easy to open, store and it doesn't wobble over easily, which isn't a major concern but nonetheless it's an added bonus.<br /><br />I'm usually reticent when it comes to trying new products in this genre, but I've definitely found a worthy alternate to my usual shampoo.  Highly recommended.

review/text: Shampoo is shampoo, right?  Wrong, this product has a luxurious thick texture.  Since it is made for dandruff or other issues with your scalp, it provides an agent which leaves you with a fresh feel.<br /><br />Because of the thickness, you don't need as much to provide a typical cleaning.  The container is ideal for the shower as it can stand up or fit inside your accessory tray.  If you are seeking to an alternative for hair/scalp treatment this product is worth trying.

review/summary: works on dandruff and smells good
review/text: I normally used head and shoulders dandruff shampoo, which prevents dandruff and also smells nice. This shampoo also worked to prevent dandruff on my hair. In fact its smell is somewhat similar to head and shoulders as well.<br />The shampoo itself is creamy white with the smell being a nice clean scent. The smell starts fading after half a day but its still there by the end of the day, just faintly. The bottle is easy to open, you just press one end and the other end pop ups. Which is great because the H&S bottles are a pain to open; you know what i mean if you use H&S. It also works up a lathe quickly.<br />Overall i can heartily recommend this product to others to purchase; i dont believe you will be disappointed.

review/text: I received a recommendation awhile back that you shouldn't use the same shampoo every single day because of buildup on your scalp. I use anti-dandruff shampoos because I don't want build-up and flaking so I took that to heart. I typically use head and shoulders but I wanted an alternative for the days I switch off. This one has done well. It keeps up with the anti-dandruff job it has. When I use it, I don't need conditioner (I have long hair). And best of all, it doesn't smell fruity. It's another reasonable shampoo for guys.

review/summary: It Works...It Really Works
review/text: Many men my age have a retreating hairline.  Mine didn't just retreat, it unconditionally surrendered!..many years ago...and left only a few lonely sentinels on the great plain of my balding pate. What hair I have left is a semi-circular rear-guard on the back of my head and above my ears.  And it's sensitive.  After a defeat like that, who wouldn't be?<br /><br />In fact it's so sensitive that the usual dandruff-removing shampoos (the kind that's supposed to make your scalp "tingle" when it's working) irritate my skin so badly that it turns red...or maybe it's just blushing after its former defeat.  So I quit using dandruff shampoos...and quit wearing dark shirts and coats as a result.<br /><br />Along comes CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY. I thought: what the heck, why not try it.  The worse that can happen is nothing...or my skin turns the color of fall leaves in the mountains again.<br /><br />It's been less than 2 weeks since I started using CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY and already I've noticed a tremendous difference.  It works.  Not only does it work, it does so without irritating my skin.  Two weeks and no rash or itching...and NO dandruff.  YUP...this stuff works.  It REALLY works.  I like it.

When he came out he was so happy and darn if his hair didn't look glossier.  There is not a speck of dandruff in his hair since he's been using it.

My scalp has felt less itchy, dandruff hasn't been noticeable, and my hair feels almost as silky smooth as if I used Pantene.<br /><br />My complaint with this product has do with the packaging.  The item came in a padded envelope.  When shipped, as much as 1/4 of the shampoo had leaked all over.  The cap just isn't secure enough.  Even after washing the bottle off, turning it upside down would result in leakage.  Despite the flaw in the packaging, I would still recommend this product -- but consider purchasing this at your local store instead.

review/summary: Works well, even on ladies' hair.
review/text: I have somewhat short, fine hair, (but a lot of it) and my husband has fine thinning hair.  We both occasionally experience issues with dandruff and dry scalp, so I wanted to try this shampoo as an alternative to our usual brand.  While billed as "shampoo for men," I found the scent of this shampoo to be pleasant and mild, and not at all "medicine-y."  The shampoo itself was rather thin, like my regular shampoo, rather than the toothpaste like consistancy of our usual brand of dandruff shampoo.  I was very pleased with the results on my hair, it washed away any dandruff I had, and my scalp was totally itch free.  This is not a "2-n-1" shampoo, so those with very dry hair may want to follow up with a conditioner; although the formula is not drying, and I don't think conditioner would be needed unless your hair is very dry.  Overall, this shampoo does what is advertises, which is get rid of dandruff, and it leaves a clean, fresh scent behind.  I think this is a very good product.

review/summary: Effective anti-dandruff.  Great scent and lather.  Leaves hair a bit dry.
review/text: My review title pretty much sums up my experience.<br /><br />I found this Clear Men Scalp Therapy to succeed in combating dandruff as well as the dominant marketed product (I'll say it  . . . Head and Shoulders).<br /><br />I really like the application experience.  A nice rich lather (more creamy than foamy, but rinses clean easily).  The label boasts of gensing, tea, and mint ingredients.  I love the scent and I'll just say that it is quite herbal-like and really reminded me of apples more than anything else.  Nice bottle by the way, which sits up securely and easily on either end.<br /><br />Now, to my only negative on this shampoo, for which I deducted a star --  It seems to leave my hair more dry and straw-like than the other shampoos I use.  I've tried Clear with and without conditioner.  The conditioner helps of course, but all else being equal, it seems to leave my hair feeling dry.<br /><br />In all, for anti-dandruff shampoo needs I like the Clear scent and lather.  I think I prefer my old standby (Head and Shoulders) for final results with hair feel.  Both are effective against dandruff.

review/summary: Very mild scent (a positive for me), but a bit thin
review/text: I like this shampoo.  It works well, just like other anti-dandruff shampoos that contain zinc.  It is also very mildly scented, something that I appreciate.  (I cannot stand bath products that have too strong of a scent.)  I am deducting one star from my rating because I think the product is a little thin/watery.  It does lather fine, though, even when using a small amount.

review/summary: Nothing special for me
review/text: The product is a light lotion shampoo that has a subtle fragrance, and imparts a slightly cooling effect when used. I've used it for about a month, and don't think my hair feels any cleaner than before. I don't have a bad dandruff problem, so maybe I'm not the best person to test this product. I do need to use a conditioner after using it, since it does seem to dry out my hair.... or maybe it's just the hot, dry summer weather doing its thing. I probably won't be looking for this product on the shelf in the future, but if I find it on sale, maybe it is worth another try.

review/summary: Good product
review/text: Though it has been years since anyone in our family has had dandruff, we do have a couple with other scalp issues and this shampoo did help with them. It does a great job of getting hair squeaky clean and looking great. I also believe it may help prevent future outbreaks of dandruff and other scalp problems. Whether you have a normal scalp or need therapy for your hair issues, it is a great product to have on your shelf as a 'just in case' treatment or preventative. Also, it says 'men' but I used it as well and liked how my hair looked and felt afterwards. I don't know how it would work on someone who has greasy hair issues, this type might cause more problems in those cases.

review/summary: A Product That Gets It Right at a Fair Price
review/text: What should a dandruff shampoo do?<br /><br />First (& probably 2nd, 3rd, and so-on and so-on)...it should control dandruff.  Clear is, foremost, an effective treatment for mild fo medium dandruff (I don't know if its efficacy is actually higher, but it simply works well).<br /><br />Second, it helps if the fragrance is decent, Clear goes beyond decent and is noticeably aromatic, yet understated, .  Simply put:  This stuff smells very good in a "natural" way that is never too heavy.<br /><br />Finally, the strenght of this shampoo speaks for itself, but you will not have a pile of dry straw as it seems to leave hair soft and pliable.<br /><br />So, Clear gets a definite recomendation as it is a product that does what is purports to at a reasonable cost.  No reservations...Highly recommended.

review/summary: Quality shampoo
review/text: Clear Men Scalp Therapy is described as an anti-dandruff shampoo that is "clinically proven to help eliminate dandruff symptoms at the source with pyrithione zinc." Okay. After approximately a week of use, I cannot say with any certainty whether that product description is true, but my hair sure feels clean after using it. It also seems to be less dry after shampooing although that could also be the result of my tendency to use only a little dab, having found that with shampoo, like Brylcreem, that'll do ya. I can't say that I agree with the claim that the natural mint ingredient will leave "an extra cooling sensation." My head did feel cooler but I attribute that to the ice cold showers I have a habit of taking when the temperature is in the 90s, as it's been too often of late.<br /><br />There are a lot of ingredients that sound impressively healthy, including ginseng, tea tree, vitamins B5 and E, sunflower, soybean, etc, but, not surprisingly, when you squeeze it into the palm of your hand, all you see is a white cream. Nonetheless, I assume this is all good for the scalp.<br /><br />This seems to be a quality shampoo. I recommend it.

review/summary: Nice alternative to Head and Shoulders
review/text: I have been a longtime user of Head and Shoulders shampoo to control my dandruff problems.  Clear Men's Scalp Therapy shampoo is a fresh, pleasant alternative.  It comes in an elegant and functional bottle, easy to open and shut, even with wet or soapy fingers!  It has a nice texture - thick and creamy, and a subtly pleasant aroma that increases as you use it.  It does an excellent job cleansing the hair and scalp, leaves no appreciable residue, rinses completely. The dandruff control is effective 24 hours after showering, which puts this treatment head and shoulders over Head and Shoulders.  Good product!  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JT7AIA">CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY 2 in 1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner, Dry Scalp Hydration, 12.9oz</a>

review/summary: Good Mild Anti-Dandruff Daily Shampoo
review/text: The Clear Men Scalp Therapy is a good shampoo for hair and beard. The Bio 10 Nutrium formula with ginseng, mint, and tea tree leaves the scalp and face skin somewhat moist without the tight dry feeling that I get after using other shampoos. It produces a mild tingling sensation probably related to the mint ingredient. The shampoo has a very subtle flowery fragrance, not overpowering as in other products. I have only minor flaking in scalp and face skin and this shampoo effectively ended that minor problem. The product is white and milky prior to use and does not produce much in the way of suds. The consistency is like a mild skin cream/moisturizer and can be used every day. I think this feature helps to end flaking at the scalp and skin sources rather than just washing away flakes that have been produced already like other anti-dandruff shampoos. I would highly recommend this "scalp therapy" as a mild and effective anti-dandruff product.

review/text: My husband has bad psoriasis on his scalp. Nothing made the flaking go away until this shampoo. He only has to wash his hair every other day and no more snow storm on his shirt. I am not a fan of all the ingredients. Sodium lauryl sulfate is bad. It has a lot of chemicals in it. We try to do no chemicals in anything. Since this works so well, he will continue to use it but less frequently. It tingles the scalp for a refreshing wash.

review/summary: It's All Good
review/text: Dandruff does not hang around when this shampoo comes acallin'. It was fun watching the Olympics today and leaving the scalp scratching to someone else. This product has a mild but very pleasant odor. A small amout of this creamy substance will suffice for a thorough cleaning. The lid is designed to easily open for extracting the shampoo and just as easily closes back down. No shampoo that I have used in the last few years has been as satisfactory as this Clear.<br /><br />I received this shampoo from the Amazon Vine program. Some of the contents spilled out all over the shampoo bottle, the packing slip and both the inside and outside of the shipping carton. I would guess that approximately 1/3 of the contents were spilled out. The lid was closed so the spillage was not from the normal opening but seems to have been from the sides of the lid. I still have a lot of shampoo to use and appreciate the opportunity to use this fine product. I mention the leakage only as an alert that it could happen to someone who purchases this product in which case it would need to be returned. Do not let my experience deter you from buying this product. It is a winner.

review/summary: I'm quite pleased with the results
review/text: When given the opportunity to try this shampoo I was low on my anti-dandruff shampoo anyway so thought why the heck not.  I don't have a real big issue with dandruff so typically use an anti-dandruff shampoo only once or twice a week although I typically wash my hair daily or near daily.<br /><br />Upon the product's arrival I immediately liked the pop open and snap closed top, one of the better designs in my opinion.  When smelling the shampoo for the first time I very much liked the light and clean scent.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed when using Clear Men Scalp Thereapy anti-Dandruff shampoo is that a little goes a long way.  I live in an area of the country where the water hardness is among the worst in the nation.  Even when softened with a salt-based softening system many shampoos or soaps do not produce a nice lather.  Each time I've used the Clear Men Scalp Therapy shampoo I've reduced the amount I use and am now down to a pea size amount which produces great lather on my medium length hair.<br /><br />So, how are the anti-dandruff results.  I've not seen any flakes since I started using this shampoo so that to me says it's working.  But, I've also been flake-free when using Head and Shoulders and only notice flakes when I go 7 to 10 days without an anti-dandruff shampoo.  However, I do like the clean scent and clean feel better than I do when using Head and Shoulders.  My hair is very fine and I normally use a moisturizing rinse after shampooing.  I've tried comparing this to Head and Shoulders without a rinse and with a rinse.  Either way, the Clear Men Scalp Thereapy Anti-Dandruff shampoo is my choice.  My hair is clean and less dry than when using Head and Shoulders.  I can finally kick the "Head and Shoulders habit".  Go ahead and try some, I think you'll like it.

review/summary: Review for Clear men's anti-dandruff shampoo, clean & refresh version
review/text: I found this to be similar to head & shoulders shampoo, which I use regularly. However, I did find that head & shoulders performed a bit better in preventing my scalp from itching for a longer period. In terms of being anti-dandruff, both shampoos worked about the same. I thought this shampoo would feel minty/cooling from the name and because mint and tea tree are written on the bottle, but it actually wasn't. The first time I used this shampoo, the fragrance was stronger than usual and lingered for several hours, making me worried that other people would notice the smell and get annoyed. The smell was not bad. I'm just not a fragrance person. However, this only happened the first time I opened the shampoo bottle and the fragrance was at normal levels the other times I used it. The fragrance was unisex and neither super manly or girly.

While Head & Should worked for my husband it did not work for my son. He still would have dandruff. After using Clear for 3 weeks now, my son has no dandruff. It doesn't have an overpowering scent. It's smells clean and refreshing. I plan to switch from H&S to Clear. I highly recommend trying this product for men who suffer from dandruff. It may work for you.

review/summary: Clean
review/text: I have been using the CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Clean and Regresh, for about a week. It comes in a 12.9 ounce bottle with convenient flat ends on both top and bottom, which means that when the bottle starts to empty, it can be stored on its top in order to get the remaining contents out easily. The ingredients include: ginseng, mint, and tea tree.<br /><br />The shampoo itself is a milky cream which emerges readily from the container. The shampoo is not oily or greasy and appears not to leave residues. Any odor is not apparent to me. After one week of use, my scalp feels clean. My hair tends to curl, especially in the rain-forest environment where I live. However, this shampoo seems to flatten my curls. You may or may not like that effect. On the negative side, the shampoo is irritating if you get it in your eyes. Maybe this is caused by the mint. Altogether, I like this shampoo and plan to continue to use it.

review/text: Finally a dandruff shampoo that doesn't have a weird, medicated smell. The lid has a pop up part so you don't have to unscrew the top to get to the shampoo. It's not a deal breaker, but it is a nice feature. This shampoo doesn't make a lot of suds, but just a little shampoo seems to go a long way (the shampoo is rather thick). It does help with dandruff. I don't have this problem, but my daughter does. After using this product for a week I have to say it works as well as Head and Shoulders without the stinky smell.

review/summary: 4 1/2 Stars - Handles Dandruff with a Subtle Scent
review/text: Clear Men Scalp Therapy Anti-Dandruff Shampoo Clean & Fresh comes in an easy to handle bottle with a modern pop-up cap. The Clean and Fresh scent can be spotted on the shelf because the cube on the front is surrounded by blue (as opposed to green for the Cool Fresh Mint scent).<br /><br />Pros:  The product does make a difference in dandruff. Having used the product several times, I see a difference. The Clean & Fresh scent has a more subtle smell than the Cool Fresh Mint even though they are both made with ginseng and tea.  While the traditional whitish color of dandruff shampoo, it feels lighter and more like regular shampoos than a medicated dandruff shampoo and it leaves your hair feeling soft. Note, a very small amount works up a large lather, so the bottle lasts a long time.<br /><br />Small issue:<br />The tilt cap can build up a slight crust that is a bit hard to wipe off because only a small space tilts up, putting it in running water cleans it up easily.<br /><br />I recommend the product for clearing up dandruff with a subtle or no scent left behind. If you like to have a stronger scent of "clean" after shampooing you might try the Clean Fresh Mint scent too.

review/text: This shampoo has almost no scent, perhaps because it is intended for men.  It also seems to have low suds, at least less than some I have tried. It appears to work as anti-dandruff also, at least as well as the coal based shampoo that I have been using that my wife dislikes. While I have only used it twice so far, I like the way my hair feels after I use it. I have never before heard of this brand, but I will have to insure I can find where I can get it.

review/text: Let's dig right in...<br /><br />++ THE PROS ++<br />+[APPLE SCENTED]<br />This has a nice, pleasing scent of apples. It's also very light scented and not at all overpowering<br />+[COLOR AND TEXTURE]<br />It's milky white and about the consistency of coconut milk<br />+[LIGHT LATHER]<br />This is meant to be a daily shampoo, so you're not going to get as thick a lather as a conventional shampoo.<br />+[WASHES OUT CLEAN]<br />It washes out easily and thoroughly, no feeling of leftover residue at all<br />+[FLAKES ARE UNDER CONTROL]<br />They're not completely gone, but so far this shampoo is doing a good job of managing and controlling it and keeping it to a minimum.<br />+[ITCHING IS UNDER CONTROL]<br />The Tea Tree and Mint are certainly doing their job here. I find I'm scratching much less with this shampoo.<br /><br />-- THE CONS --<br />-[PRICEY]<br />Sadly though, this is usually the case with any anti-dandruff shampoo you buy. So I can't fault this product too much on that.<br /><br />As far as scalps go, mine is very itchy and flaky. I have black shirts, but I'll only ever wear them at home as they serve to only remind me of just how bad my flaking can be.<br /><br />I won't be so bold as to claim that I've tried "every" anti-dandruff shampoo out there, but I will say I've certainly played the field in search of the holy grail. Head-n-Shoulders, Selsun Blue, Denorex, Neutrogena and quite a few others I can't recall at the moment. I don't know what the heck is going on up on my scalp, even when I do seem to find something that works it doesn't take long before my scalp seems to develop an immunity to it.<br /><br />I finally did find that holy grail of anti-dandruff product that works EVERY time, the VERY FIRST time but unfortunately it's completely unconventional and to put it mildly it STINKS!...And that product is Apple Cider Vinegar. That's right, that yellowy-orange cousin to White Vinegar. It's usually recommended to use a mixture of 50/50 ACV with water to dilute the smell...But sometimes the itch and flakiness on my head gets so bad I don't care and just douse at 100% ACV. Basically my head ends up smelling like Salt-n-vinegar chips and the BURN is intense and washing it out is a hassle and leaves your hair feeling like dried out branches...But man it WORKS!<br /><br />So far I'm having good luck with this product, so I haven't had to go the route of the Apple Cider Vinegar, and that's a blessing! Well recommended.

But I heard it's good for your hair to switch it up and use different shampoos so the hair doesn't become accustomed to one thing. And then Clear caught my eye.<br /><br />I feel like I have itchy scalp sometimes, so I've given Clear a shot because of the scalp therapy. I've been using it for a few weeks now and I like it. I think it's too early to tell if the shampoo is truly helping my scalp, but it's not hurting. The scent is pleasant and I was initially concerned since a lot of shampoos "for men" have strong scents. I don't care for that.<br /><br />My hair feels good, I'm hoping my scalp feels even better, and it should be interesting how my hair reacts as it grows.

It lathers nicely, if you like that, and rinses clean.  You don't need much to do the job.<br /><br />As far as the dandruff control, I've been using it a week and it seems to be working just fine.  It's not overly harsh, and doesn't irritate my skin.  Overall I'm very impressed with the Clear line of products, especially for the price.<br /><br />My only complaint is the pop top on the shampoo bottle.  While I like the ease of use in the shower, when I got my shampoo shipped to me I lost about 1/4 of the bottle because the pop top had been pressed inside of the bubble wrap envelope at some point and some of it leaked out and made a big mess.  Maybe it was the way it was shipped (in an envelope instead of a box), but on the other hand I could easily see this happening if I bought it at the store and it was in a bag with other things that were on top that could do the same thing.  Just a word of caution.

review/text: Tried this shampoo for several days and I am pleased with it. Cleans you hair well, no gooey residue when it rinses out and although the shampoo has a pleasant smell to it, it doesn't leave a notable odor in your hair.

review/summary: Head and Shoulders Watch Out!
review/text: Just got it today and had to use it after being caught in a near hurricane type shower here in central Florida.<br /><br />So far I've been impressed with products from this company and this product keeps up the tradition.  Has the consistency and near coloring of Head and Shoulders and appears to carry some of the same formulation along with a few other naturals and botanicals tossed in for good measure.<br /><br />Left my hair manageable with having to resort to conditioner and has a scent that's sort of fruit oriented but I can't quite place it.  Do like the "push to open" top as opposed to others that often leak if you turn them upside down in a vain attempt to  get the last drop out.<br /><br />Price wise, in line with the brand names and I've seen it at several retail stores at sale prices so the competition is on for those others.<br /><br />As for dandruff control, I'll have to wait and see so that may be an update in the future.

review/summary: Good and Relatively Inexpensive
review/text: I thought I'd give this a try because I have a dry, flakey scalp; the fact that it was $1 to $1.50 cheaper than the Axe Anti-Dandruff shampoo I normally use also influenced my decision (and free 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime).<br /><br />I'll have to say, I'm not disappointed. This shampoo has a pleasant "clean" fresh scent that I find agreeable. It lathers up well with just a small amount of shampoo.<br /><br />As far as controlling my flakey, dry scalp - it has been almost 2 weeks and I've seen a noticeable improvement in my scalp. I think the Tea Tree ingredient makes this shampoo so gentle, but I can't be sure.<br /><br />Overall, for the effectiveness and reasonable price, I give this product 5 Stars. I hope it works as well for you!

review/summary: Smells nice for an anti-dandruff prodcut and works well
review/text: I got this for my boyfriend who likes to use the anti dandruff shampoo every once in a while, as picky as he is about shampoos I was glad to see that he liked this one so I had to try it myself a few times, it's for men but hey its still shampoo hehe. The consistency is creamy white and has a slight clean scent, nothing medicinal at all which is nice since many anti dandruff products smell like a chemical lab even when scents are added. This felt nice and smooth while I used it, created a nice lather and washed out clean leaving the hair feeling fresh and clean and once dry my hair was moisturized but I always use conditioner. I wish it had more of a minty punch to it since it has tee tree oil but that can smell a bit antiseptic when too strong so I have nothing but positive things to say about it. According to the bf it works really well to curb any scalp dryness but I would advise to sill use conditioner even if an ultra light one. I will definitely check out the women's products from Clear since my teenage sister is a fan and her hair has been extra shiny lately.<br /><br />- Kasia S.

review/summary: Smells good and works well
review/text: So I don't really have dandruff, but I do have scalp itch from time to time.<br /><br />What this shampoo has done for me is to remove the scalp itch from my life.<br /><br />Compared to Head and Shoulders, it uses the same active ingredient. You have to decide if you care about all the extra stuff, like ginseng, being included. To me, it hasn't really changed the way my scalp feels between the two.<br /><br />For me it all comes down to price. I'll buy whichever is less expensive when I need to purchase new shampoo.

review/summary: compared with "Head & Shoulders"
review/text: The CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY (clean and refresh anti-dandruff)...<br /><br />Both this product and "Head & Shoulders" use the SAME active ingredient.  The difference is this product claims the inclusion of ginseng, mint, and tea tree ("Bio Nutrium 10").<br /><br />Is the extra two dollars difference (at the time of this review) worth it?  It depends on you.<br /><br />IMPRESSIONS: The product had leaked (minor) in shipping.  The shampoo has a light fragrance.  I personally like the fragrance.  The product felt "greasy" to the touch (closer to conditioner) and does not lather (compared to Head & Shoulders).<br /><br />RESULT: The hair did not have the "hold" I'm used to from "Head & Shoulders"(does not have conditioner). It also made my scalp itch (noticeable and annoying).<br /><br />I'd recommend a small sampling before purchasing.

review/summary: GOOD ITEM BUT SHORT SHELF LIFE
review/text: This are not greasy & taste better than the big brands in supermarkets. Taste great in scrambled eggs & topping veggies. The subscribe & save feature would be a good bargain but when you get these 6 packs, they carry an expiration date of about 2-3 months. Supermarket brands are usually about a year. So if you will use up quickly, get these.

review/text: I was shocked at how small the bags are and how small the crumbles are. Not chunky enough for us for a salad BUT that said they are great for cooking with! They add a nice zip to scrambled eggs, hot dishes etc so I am happy with that. I would purchase again if they were on special again because I got a good price plus they are not fatty and gross like the Hormel bits, very lean.

review/summary: love it ~
review/text: I bought this organic whole grain pasta from a local grocery store Mothers & really liked it's flavor & texture.  I almost gave up on whole grain pasta b.c. the few I've tried simply tasted horrible & made me hate my dinner; and I love pasta!  This one didn't give me a bloated stomach & sleepiness as compared to conventional carb-ladden overly-processed pasta.<br /><br />Normal grocery stores don't seem to carry this.  Wholefoods has some varieties but I didn't find this particular one in my local Wholefoods either.  Overall I am very happy that Amazon offers this at a great price with the subscription service, which is totally flexible allowing changes of frequency or even cancellation.  Subscription service shipped it free, the box of 12 arrived lightening fast!  I'm seeing my waistline going down with this and other home-made wholesome food with moderate exercise.  I highly recommand this product.

review/summary: Unbelievably Great New Flavor
review/text: I was so pleased to see Ocean Spray introducing several new flavors, all quite nice.  This new Cranbery Peach flavor is absolutely perfect.  It's incredibly pleasing, quenches my thirst, does not irritate my throat as some packet drinks do, and I never tire of it.  My only gripe is that I wish the grocery store chains would give Ocean Spray as much shelf exposure (percentage wise) as they do the other guys.  The price is in keeping with other like products and the flavors are superior.
