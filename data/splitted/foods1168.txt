review/summary: a cup of warm comfort
review/text: My granddaughter bought my Keurig Brewer and it came with a huge box of various coffee's. I enjoyed them all, however im not the dark coffee lover. I do not like that sour, acid taste you get from some coffee as an after taste left in your mouth. This Nantucket Blend of Green Mountain is excellent and never leaves that undesirable after taste. I do like Neuman's Extra Bold, but its not my number one choice.  With this coffee you loose none of your flavor from adding cream. I just love it and its that one little extra I do for me....hope you enjoy.

review/summary: Yummy, smooth coffee
review/text: Nantucket Blend is perfect. It's a smooth medium blend with just the right amount of caffeine to wake me up in the morning. It's almost creamy and it almost tastes to me like it has a very slight vanilla flavor to it. But don't take my word for it being slightly vanilla as I'm definitely not a coffee connoisseur. I guess I think this because it's so creamy and yummy-tasting.

review/text: The name is not very exciting, but don't let that deter you from tyring it. It is a great cup of coffee. It is not overly strong but absolutely not weak. No bitterness and no aftertaste. It has some very subtle flavors that I can't quite identify and that makes it a unique experience. This is one of my "go to" blends and I keep more of it on hand than the other varieties.

review/summary: Great coffee but k-cups are becoming a luxury!
review/text: Coffee is great, delivery was great BUT k-cups are quickly becoming a luxury.<br />Now that many of us know what we like, the price of the k-cups is through the roof.  I know the price of coffee is way up, but at  .62c cup, or $60/month for at-home coffee (about the lowest I've been able to find for k-cups),  this 3-4 cup a day user is likely to be filling her little make-your-own-k-cup device far more often.

review/summary: Nice coffee to start the day
review/text: I enjoy starting the day with a cup of coffee. Once upon a time, I just used instant. Some were decent quality; some weren't. Then, I tried Mr. Coffee. Sorry, not my cuppa! Back to instant. Maxwell House had some nice instant.<br /><br />But my family wanted a Keurig coffee maker, so--for the holidays this year--I bought one. The coffee that came with it was a Newman's Own blend. Pretty bold and tasty (better than instant and quite a bit better than my memory of Mr. Coffee). I recently ordered this through Amazon. It is not quite as bold as the Newman's Own k-cup coffee. But it does have a smooth taste that starts the day off nicely. So, I have encountered two good coffees for the Keurig coffee maker!

I use half and half and splenda but I was be good with just cream,milk,half and half etc no sugar or sweetener needed. 48 cups for the price is a little much considering there are places that sell 96 for 51$ also you have to factor in the cost of shipping. If your looking for K-cups in bulk try coffeeforless.com otherwise this is fine.

review/summary: Didn't buy on Amazon but
review/text: Since getting my Keurig machine I have been experimenting with variety of K-cups.  I didn't get this on amazon but caught it on sale at the local market.  It's a good basic cup of coffee.  While trying to figure out flavor preferences (with things like caramel, blueberry, etc.) it's nice to have a basic that you can rely on.  Some of the flavors aren't strong enough and some of the other brands or roasts are way too strong.  Nantucket blend is a happy medium.

review/summary: I Like These A Lot
review/text: For a long time I thought I just didn't like coffee.  Turns out that I just don't like the stuff that my mom bought.  I don't know what she used to buy for the old coffee maker, but now she likes the Donut Shop K-Cups.  I can't stand that stuff without drowning it with vanilla creamer.  It's just too bitter.  The Nantucket Blend is a lot smoother.  Although the Dark Magic blend by Green Mountain is. . . interesting, of the coffees I've sampled, I prefer the Nantucket Blend.

review/summary: Solid, versatile cup of coffee
review/text: Green Mountain's Nantucket blend is a great cup of coffee for almost any occasion. It can be your morning coffee, your afternoon wake-up, or even your after dinner brew. It has a medium body with a smooth flavor. I don't care for dark roasts but I also wanted something that packed more of a punch than a light roast; the Nantucket blend definitely fits the bill.<br /><br />My only complaint about this coffee is that it does have a stronger aftertaste than I would like. I enjoy drinking the coffee but I am sometimes left with a bitter taste in my mouth.

Not too strong, not too weak--a nice, medium blend with a<br />wonderful aroma.  Buying it in the 50 count size gives me a better "per cup" price<br />and allows me to order less often.

review/summary: A Perfect Coffee Blend, Our Favorite
review/text: If a milder, smoother taste is what you are looking for, you won't find anything better than Green Mountain Nantucket Blend. This is the first coffee I ever tried in my Keurig and it's been a staple in our variety of K-Cups for two years now. The quality is superb - I wouldn't expect anything less from Green Mountain. In fact, a friend who has a relative who works there says the quality control is so strict they throw out cups that have even a tish more or less coffee than the cups are supposed to. At less than 0.60 cents/cup, this is a bargain. With Prime Membership, to have these delivered to my door is too good to be true.

review/text: I have to say I was expecting a lot. I had been giving my dog Greenies but they were becoming outrageously priced. I thought I'd try these ones and admittedly, my dog loves them. The only problem is the treats stink. As in they smell, bad. I was hoping with a name like "Freshies" they would help with bad breath but so far they just seem to mask whatever he'd eaten before them. Don't get me wrong, they don't smell totally awful, I just had expectations of "fresh" not chicken smell.

review/summary: Great...if you Must Drink Decaf
review/text: Due to some ongoing stomach issues of late, I've had to minimize the amount of caffeinated coffee I drink each day. As such, I decided to give the Cameron's Decaf French Roast a try, just to see if I could handle decaf for my late morning cup-o-Joe.  I am very happy to report, I can - easily.  I am a BIG fan of the Cameron's roasts, having enjoyed the high-octane French Roast version for quite a while now.  Switching at least partly to decaf, a task which I've not enjoyed in the past, I thought I'd at least give Cameron's a shot.  This coffee is fantastic, and I honestly cannot tell the difference between the high octane and this version.  As a long time coffee fanatic, I can tell you assuredly that with almost any coffee drink I've had over the years, I KNOW if it is decaf or regular. This coffee is indistinguishable, and tastes GREAT! It is highly recommended for those poor souls, such as me, who must start incorporating more decaf into their lives. As a bonus on Amazon - it is subscribe and save.

review/summary: For Mr. Picky Kitty
review/text: I have 4 Kitties and am quite accostomed to someone turning his or her little pink  nose up at the carefully picked out choice I have make for them. Plus orange and white feral kitty lives ot back and gets a mixture of left overs for supper in addition to one or two cansof friskies to round off of his diet.I consider him a voting member when it comes to deciding whether the 4 regular house cats just cot too much of something or actually did not like it.<br />Chicken, Tomato and Pasta entree has been favorite here for the last 6 mo. Everyone likes it and there are rarely left overs, so I have to have a compassionate day and give Mr. Feral A WHOLe can of his own from time to time. He gobbles the stuff while the others tend to eat it more politely. But Everyone is well fed. though not chubby. 4 cats<br />just got a thourough vet check and all was well. Mr. Feral is not afforded that luxury as he is quite costly anyway, loveable though he may be..he is truly Feral, so no playing or petting.<br />So, my 5 kitties give this Pro Plan 5 stars! Hope your kitties like it as well as mine do!!!

review/summary: It's Hard to Do Better than Wellness
review/text: Wellness is among the best cat foods out there.  It is grain-free and it has ingredients of high quality. There are no meat by-products.  My only caveat is that Wellness' products with fish are not so good.  Quite frankly, cats don't eat fish in the wild, so their digestive systems are not designed for consumption of fish.  That being said, this is a fantastic specific product.  The meat is fresh, and I know my cat loves it.  I adopted my cat (he is five), and within weeks his coat was softer, the colors more vivid and I began seeing markings and colors I never saw before.<br /><br />On another note, I can't help but take a dig at one of the worst, if not THE worst, foods out there...Science Diet.  Take a read on the ingredients.  In doing so, you will the natural, very high grade, pure ingredients of Wellness contrasted with the low grade, artificial, even mysterious ingredients of Science Diet food.  Hill's chooses the name "Science Diet" to lend it credibility that it just doesn't have.  Finally, cats can't digest grains and soy.  Hill's food is riddled with that stuff.  Bottom line:  stay WITH Wellness; stay AWAY from Science Diet.

review/summary: a very good decaffeinated coffee
review/text: I am on a course of chemotherapy; and I am therefore not allowed to drink regular coffee because it has caffeine. I tried Nescafe Taster's Choice decaf coffee and I was very much in love!<br /><br />This coffee can be made in any coffee pot or coffee maker. The coffee is consistently tasteful.<br /><br />You probably should refrigerate the container after you open it; but I have left it outside on my kitchen countertop and the coffee I make with this still tastes fine. If you're lucky enough to catch a great sale on this terrific decaffeinated coffee I would suggest that you stock up. You can even put the unused containers in your freezer for up to several months, maybe even a year. It will stay fresh and taste every bit as good after you let it defrost.<br /><br />All in all, Nescafe Taster's Choice is an excellent decaffeinated coffee and it remains extremely popular. Buy some and try it today--you won't be disappointed!

review/summary: New Decaf House Blend quite different from old Decaffeinated Blend
review/text: In an earlier version of this review I gave this product only 1 star.  I have now changed my mind and I now give it 4 stars.  What I originally said was:<br /><br />"This is a warning to those who, in the past, greatly enjoyed the DECAFFINATED BLEND.  Taster's Choice switched to a new blend, called DECAF HOUSE BLEND.  Yesterday I finished the container containing my DECAFFINATED BLEND (whose aroma and taste I had greatly enjoyed) and opened the new container of DECAR HOUSE BLEND.  I noticed immediately that the smell was very poor.  It has an unpleasant, burnt smell.  It smells also a bit like chocolate mixed with earth.  Then I noticed that it has more of a chocolate taste than a coffee taste!  Gone the coffee flavor and smell I used to enjoy.  It was at that point that I pulled my old container out of the trash and then noticed that the BLEND has CHANGED from DECAFFINATED to DECAF HOUSE.  What a disappointment!"<br /><br />Why have I changed my mind and now give it 4 stars?  Well, I noticed that, over time, the smell and flavor was improving!  I figured that the surrounding moisture in the air must be altering the aroma and taste, so I poured the contents out, spread them and let them sit for an hour.  What an improvement!  Also, during the time of my disappointment, I tried Trader Joe's 100% Columbian Instant Decaf Coffee and it was terrible!  No taste or aroma at all!  So then I tried Sanka's Naturally Decaffeinated Instant Coffee and, while better than Trader Joe's, it is very inferior to Taster's Choice.  So I now recommend Taster's Choice but, in my opinion, you have to first let the granules "breathe" in order to eliminate that initial unpleasant, burnt, earth-like odor.

review/text: I've been drinking coffee for a little over 50 years. I started too young with the strong, black kind. No cream or sugar, just super straight! Lots of it, every day, daylight to dark. I built up such an immunity to the caffeine no way it kept me awake. Didn't give me any extra energy either. What it did do was help raise my blood pressure! So, along comes Taster's Choice. It's instant, oh God, not brewed, not dripped, not steamed, it's instant. That can't be good now can it? On top of that it's {{{shudder}}} DECAF! I've had to give up so much. Smoking, refined sugar, white flour, salt! It isn't fair that I now have to settle for Instant Coffee and Decaf to boot. **sigh** I begrudgingly fixed a cup, followed the directions. I looked at it for a bit before that first sip. I finally put it to my lips and *slurp*. Hmmm, not too bad, but then it was still pretty hot so I waited again and then took a gulp. I waited for the gag reflex to set in. It didn't happen. Hmmm again. As it turns out, it was pretty darn good. I have to be fair, it's darn good and I can easily live with it. It's well worth the price (compare the same in the stores, weight etc. and all) I just may actually live longer as a result and as Martha says "That's a good thing".

review/summary: Best Decaf on the market
review/text: Taster's Choice regular is the best instant coffee and now the only one I buy.  Not surprisingly, the Decaf version is the best on the market too.  Actually, I could be fooled into thinking it is the regular version at times.  One possible reason is that although it is Decaf, it is not caffeine free.  If it is your first cup of the day or late at night, you can feel the buzz of the available caffeine.  So, one of the reasons for the good taste may be a lower level of processing. I'm not telling you that this is the equivalent of a cup of Decaf Starbuck's or Peet's but it is cheap and convenient - just what an only coffee drinker in the family needs.

review/summary: Sure It's Not the Best, but I Still Love Decaf Nescafe
review/text: Though Nescafe has been on the fringe of my coffee radar since youth, I never gave it much thought until my first trip to India several years back.  The average coffee drinker is crazy for instant Nescafe, and boy do they make it strong and milky.<br /><br />When I switched to decaf (like 99% of the time), I was saddened at the loss of one of my favorite coffees.  I'd never seen Nescafe in decaf, but admittedly I'd never looked.<br /><br />On a recent trip to London, I happened upon instant decaf Nescafe and felt like an explorer stumbling upon the fortune they unknowingly sought.  As soon as I returned State side I found my tasty treat on Amazon and placed the order.<br /><br />I won't convince coffee connoisseurs that this coffee is the best, but it is pleasing both to my palette and my sensibilities...I'll always dream of India when I sip my Nescafe.

review/summary: bad taste when used as an instant coffee
review/text: I bought this coffee based on the superb reviews it received at amazon. I wanted instant decaf coffee. This one tastes very bad. This is because the roast intensity of the coffee is between light and medium, so the coffee looks brown (rather than dark). This information is on the canister itself but not in amazon's online description. It dissolves instantly but tastes like wood. Now I am left with three gigantic canisters of wooden coffee, not knowing what to do with them. I wonder if anyone knows an easy way to change my wooden coffee into dark coffee (can I microwave the canister?? or use oven??).

I switched to Sea Salt for everyday use a couple of years ago but continued to use Lawry's Seasoned Salt for a bit of punch. This is the only salt I use at the table now.<br /><br />Its a combination of Alae'a and Rock Salt with a soft peachy orange color to it. The coarse grain adds a bit of crunch.<br /><br />I was thrilled to find it listed with Amazon at an affordable combined price for 3.

review/text: These jelly beans were very unusual when they showed up.  They came in a package without a jelly belly logo, the jelly beans themselves had no jelly belly logo, and I don't really know if they were actually jelly bellys.  I got them as a gift, so I didn't try any of them, but it was odd giving a gift where it didn't seem like they were anything special, like I'd bagged up some licorice jelly beans from the grocery store or something, big woop...so I was disappointed.  And because they were a gift I had no idea what they tasted like.  So were they really jelly bellys?  Who knows?  I felt silly giving them though.

review/summary: A nice pick me up and throat soother!
review/text: There are so many benefits to ginger that I don't know where to start!  I had a bit of a sore throat due to a lot of singing I've been doing with the band.  I opened this matcha and absorbed the spicy scent and put it into a tin to keep it fresh.  The small size fits perfect in the tin with a little wiggle room...enough to be able to get the measuring spoon in.  I had been saving this matcha for the perfect time and after a day of singing I needed to bring it out.  Not to mention the fact that I could use a bit of a pick me up.<br />I decided to prepare this matcha hot first since I wanted to sooth my throat.  I added just a pinch of sugar and a generous helping of honey (I love my honey)!  I did take a sip before adding the honey just so I could get the original flavor.  This matcha is very smooth and spicy.  It is not in your face spicy, but just enough to give it a little flavor.<br />This matcha was very soothing on my throat so I think I'm going to save this one for next week when I have to sing again.  Sorry friends, no sharing of this one!<br />Red Leaf Tea mentions this for treating motion sickness when suffering from an unsettling stomach among other things so it's definitely useful for everyday use.  Think I might have to save a bit for my hubby to try.<br /> Here is how I ordered my Ginger Matcha from Red Leaf Tea:<br />Size: Small<br />Quality: Classic Starter Grade<br />Flavor: Delicate<br />Storage: Air tight refill flat pouch - would definitely recommend purchasing a tin for your matcha to keep it fresh.  I did not order one this time since I already had a tin.<br />To get your own tasty Ginger Matcha from Red Leaf Tea - GO HERE NOW!!!!<br />[...]<br />A sore throat soother!

review/summary: Good, but can be messy
review/text: I made the mistake of opening one of these right after they arrived following several hours inside a delivery van in 90� heat. It was a gooey mess, but tasted OK.<br /><br />One thing that puts me off bars of this type in the seeming inevitability of "stale peanut" taste. I got none of that  from Planters Big Nut Bars, Double Peanut even though the "Best when used by" date was less than a month away. I'm not a big fan of candy bars or granola bars in general; my snack food temptations are salty: almonds, spanish peanuts, and various chips. However, I would probably  choose Planters Big Nut Bars, Double Peanut if I found it in a vending machine filled with less-healthy alternatives.<br /><br />As peanuts are the first ingredient and peanut butter is the fourth, it's probably safe to assume that most of the 13 grams of fat is derived from nuts. Palm kernel oil and coconut are probably the source of the saturated fat. There are also 22 grams of carbs, 12 from sugars.<br /><br />Having one of these a day as a snack or even quick meal substitute would be OK, but the low melting point of the peanut butter makes it impractical to carry in your pocket, your car, and maybe even in a backpack.

review/summary: Great peanut bars!
review/text: First off, I'm not the biggest peanut fan in the world. I like peanut butter, but peanuts themselves don't do a lot for me.  I usually won't eat brownies or blondies if they have peanuts in them and although I can eat them by themselves, I generally don't.<br /><br />Now, having said that, I've done the 'bar' thing to death.  I did the weight watchers bars (which are good and three of them make one snack), done the south beach bars. Tried about a dozen different kinds, all in an effort to watch my calories, fulfill my hunger and do so with something that tastes good.<br /><br />These peanut bars were terrific.  The bar itself is well put together. I know some people found their bars sticky inside the wrapper, but I did not.  What I found was a delicious snack with 7g of protein (and yes, there's a fair amount of calories here too) that was plentiful. Essentially, one bar became breakfast and I enjoyed it thoroughly despite the peanuts.  Not only will I eat the rest of the box, I'm ready to order more.<br /><br />If you like peanuts, you'll love this bar. If you, like me, are only passable on peanuts, you'll probably like it too. If you hate peanuts, well, you're probably not reading this review.<br /><br />Let me know by comment your thoughts!

review/text: If you're a lover of things peanuty than this snack is perfect for you - it's almost entirely peanuts.  It says 'peanut granola bar' on the package but there really is minimal amounts of granola - after taking a bite I was like 'there's granola in here?'  You can't really taste it and can hardly see it.  I would say if you're looking for a healthy granola snack than you might want to look else-where, but for a great-tasting peanut snack this is perfect - just the right size to satisfy a peanut craving.

Now if it tastes good we're all set I thought....well, not to worry, Planters knows peanuts and this bar is full of them in a nice chewy bar that is a perfect balance between sweet and salty.  On the bottom of the bar is a peanut butter coating.  Delicious!  These bars come in at 220 calories and pack in 7g of protein.  I would definitely buy them and would recommend them to people that love chewy granola-type bars.  I think these would be perfect for putting in your pack for biking, hiking or purse when you need a little something.  Excellent bar!

review/summary: Pretty Good Tasting But Too High in Calories, Fat and Carbs For Me To Buy!
review/text: Let me start off by saying that I am not a big fan of granola bars but I enjoyed the big nut taste and peanut butter flavor in the Planters Big Nut Bar. On a taste basis alone, I'd give this product a 4-star rating. The only negative I had is that after eating it I was left with a quite dry taste in my mouth and had to drink a lot of water to get rid of it. If I wasn't a person who is trying to carefully watch my intake of calories, fat and carbs I'd be looking to eat Planters Big Nut Bar on a regular basis when I wanted a good tasting, high protein snack. However, given that each 1.62 oz. bar contains 220 calories (110 from fat), 13 grams total fat and 22 grams of carbs, I'd only give a 2-star rating to the nutritional qualities of this product; thus, resulting in my overall rating of 3 stars. While I liked the taste of the Big Nut Bar, the product's amount of calories, fat and carbs will prevent me from being a buyer on anything more than a very occasional basis. However, if you are not carefully watching these nutritional factors and you want a good tasting, high protein snack bar, than I think you will find that the Big Nut Bar will satisfy your needs.

review/summary: Nuts over Big Nut Bars!
review/text: I'm a big fan of sweet nut bars like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00275EWGO">Odwalla Sweet & Salty Almond Bars</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMOCDA">Nature Valley Sweet & Salty Nut Granola Bars</a>.  On flavor and consistency, this bar falls somewhere in between those two-- it's not quite as sweet as the Nature Valley, but definitely sweeter than the somewhat bland Odwalla.  It has a perfect mixture of crunch and stickiness that comes from the caramel-like sugary glue that holds the peanuts and oats together.  If you're a fan of the Odwalla or the Nature Valley Sweet nut bars, give these Planters bars a try.  Bonus--the name is fun to say too.
