review/summary: My kids love these!
review/text: My kids LOVE these chocolate moon pies, so I order a few boxes 2-3 times a year. (They are not available locally - in Northern California.) The secret to receiving them in pristine condition is to order them during cooler weather months. If you order in the summer they will arrive melted.

review/summary: My Wife Could Become Addicted, But Not At 110 Calories Per "Pie"
review/text: Before my wife and I were married, her favorite dessert was - of all things - Moon Pies. When we left Southern California in 1964, we couldn't find them anywhere. So, with the advent of Amazon and online shopping, I looked them up, and although I had to order from 2500 miles away, I surprised her yesterday with a "just for the heck of it" gift.<br /><br />She was elated, and she said that they were just as she remembered them. Delicious!<br /><br />But, these were a THIRD the size of the ORIGINALS, and the calorie count of 110 for what is basically a marshmallow-filled cookie, she may have to wait another 45 years to get another batch. The look on her face was worth the $25 it ultimately cost me, but neither of us can afford the intake of those calories today. If only they had put the "Only 110 Calories" in small print on the side and not in big print on the front, top, and back! Ignorance is bliss...

review/text: My dad and I love moon pies, so when father's day came I decided to order him a box. To my dismay the box came and we opened it up to find 12 melted, crushed, and smooshed moon pies that looked completely inedible. I felt horrible and was very upset at this. On top of that, my father says it tasted like they were 10 years old. I will never order this product again.

review/summary: Magnet gets stuck!
review/text: Enjoyed upon receiving.  Not a night and day difference, but using with scotch seemed to provide a smoother finish and reduce the "burn" quality (i drink it neat.)  HOWEVER, after about 5 uses, pressing the button to release the scotch through the aerator no longer worked!  I pressed it several times, to no avail - then held it in place to see if it would eventually free itself, also to no avail... poured the scotch into my glass out of the top, so that i could then shake and smack the aerator and the stopper eventually freed itself.  But the stopper - which appears to be magnetic - has not worked well since, and i would inevitably have to smack it a couple of times prior to pouring to get it to work (since you can't smack it while there's anything in the glass.)  Anyways, I call the manufacturer for a replacement and I have to pay to ship it to them.  They pay return shipping for replacement - fair enough - but i'm still paying extra for dealing with the hassle.  Hopefully the next one will not have this issue, as this seems to be the first mention of this problem.  I will update if the next one has this issue.<br /><br />Take note manufacturers, if YOUR product has a fault and it has inconvenienced a customer for a legitimate reason, consider paying for their shipping to soften the hassle of an exchange.

review/summary: A nice tool to add to ones go-to drinking set
review/text: I had my skepticism, I start with that because if you like what you already drink what could an aerator do to it?  Well it does enough for me to keep this little tool out and nearby my good alcohol.  I did the old side-by-side non aerated to aerated single shot taste test.  For the really cheap clear alcohol all I can say it does is make it have less of a burn while drinking and actually smooths out the after taste to a nice fade off.  As for higher end, scotch in my case, I tried a 12 year single malt & a 17 year old single malt.  Starting with the 17 year old scotch, this stuff is smooth and great to begin with, the side-by-side test concluded with the aerated scotch being much more floral/aromatic, the after taste was MUCH more enjoyable as it seemed to melt into a buttery feeling and just faded off into bliss.<br />The 12 year old scotch, it's good on the rocks and a splash of water.  With the aerator it turned a 12 year old scotch into a very close 15/16 year old scotch.  All the little notes of flavor came to live, I won't way it is perfect but a cheaper bottle of scotch in my cabinet just payed for this little aerator.  All the harshness and lingering after taste of the 12 year old scotch, just melted away.  Again not on the same level as the 17 year old but pretty darn close.  I can put the max of 2 full jiggers, or more :), and know that what comes out will be a nice drink all around.<br />For the $$, I'd suggest you give this a shot (or 2) if you like to enjoy a fine liquor.  I know I will defiantly be keeping this at close hand when making my drink, or drinks for others.  I'm very tempted to by a few for some good friends and family to spread the enjoyment.  The stopper and release button are NOT mechanical!  An ingenious and fool proof design of two opposing magnets creates the opening effect while the weight of the magnet closed the stopper.  Truly is machine washable and pretty durable.

review/text: I must admit I was a bit skeptical about this product and the promise that it will actually enhance the spirits that flow through it.  After now using it for a few weeks I can testify the product really does work.  Side-by-side tests confirm.  My bourbons poured through this product have more "nose" and I can clearly pick up on nuances that otherwise would not come through.  If you are a serious bourbon drinker, this product is a must.

review/summary: Works amazingly well!
review/text: Spirits I've tried with the Vinturi Spirit Aerator: Bowmore Legend, Glenlivet 22 yr, Johnny Walker Blue, Deleon Reposado, Don Julio 1942, Hanger One, Remy Martin XO, Patron Silver, Patron Anejo, Lagavulin 16 yr, Burichladdich 12 yr, Stranahan's Colorado Whiskey, Leopold Bros Rye, Silver Tree, Maker's 46, and Bulleit Rye. Basically, I've tried it with scotch, whiskey, bourbon, vodka, tequila, and cognac. Every single one of these was smoother and had more intricacies after using the Vinturi than without. Now that I am spoiled by what the Vinturi does, I get mad at myself when I am too lazy to grab and use it. The reason I am not giving it five stars is due to the button/plug on the device sticking (the button is pressed to release the plug, allowing the spirit to be aerated). Every once in a while, even after cleaning it after each use, the plug does not open when I press the button. Once the spirit is poured into the Vinturi and the plug does not open, there's nothing left to do than pour the spirit into the glass without aerating it and then pound the Vinturi against my palm to get the plug to unstick. It seems like a common problem and it is quite annoying. However, the Vinturi works well enough to overlook the infrequent annoyance.

Something volatilizes off. What is left is very smooth and mild. If you pour a jigger thru the device try it.  Then try a tiny amount not passed thru.  You will be amazed!!!  Worth every penny.  Especially for that guy who thinks he has everything and also knows it all.  I promise he will learn something is indeed new under the sun. A word of warning.  This device MUST be washed after every use otherwise it sticks closed and does not work!  But, it is well worth the extra effort. The comments about the device sticking closed are true and therefore it must be washed with clear water after each use.

The Vinturi helped bring out the smooth notes and the oak barrels.<br />Great for mixing, too! Like for a whiskey sour. If you like spirits, you need this.

review/summary: Worth it for whiskey aficionados
review/text: I have owned this product for a month now and have not had any of the problems stated in other reviews.  Since I am an enthusiastic whiskey drinker the device has seen heavy use in that time. I purchased the device from a local wine & spirit shop and for it's utility it seems to be perfectly priced.  It saves valuable tasting time swirling whiskey about in the glass.  If something happened to it I would replace it and am recommending it to all my whiskey drinking friends.  If you muddle whiskey with cola or slam it down just to get toasty, this is probably a waste of money for you.  If you truly enjoy whiskey and other fine spirits and actually take the time to taste it on the way down the hatch you will get a lot of utility from this device.  At first, I would put it back in its box after I went through a gill or so.  Now I just rinse it off and leave it on the counter.

review/summary: Works to an extent, but not convinced of it's value yet
review/text: I have a Vinturi Aerator for red wine and it worked wonders so I decided to pick up the spirit version mainly for use with scotch.<br /><br />The product seems sturdy enough and is dishwasher safe.  It is a bit larger than I had anticipated, measuring about 6 inches without the base.  The magnetic release is convenient in that it allows you to measure exact servings of either 1 or 1.5 oz, but the mechanism itself feels as though it may fail eventually.  The magnetic mechanism has not misbehaved yet (the product is only a week old), but it is the only concerning structural point.<br /><br />Now the real question, "Does it work?"  Well the answer depends on what you're expecting of it.  I use it for single malt scotches, and I will say that it drastically reduces the amount of time I need to let a scotch breathe before imbibing.  As of yet, I have not found a magical dram where this product opens it up and reveals scents and flavors heretofore hidden, but I am willing to give it a shot.<br /><br />If you're on the fence, you might want to wait and see if the product goes on sale or you develop a strong urge to perform science and test aerated vs straight spirits for yourself.

review/text: I'm a long-time wine drinker and we regularly use the Vinturi Wine Aerator -- which works great in the aromatics and flavors of wine.  So I figured it makes sense for Whiskey / Bourbon.  My husband tried this Spirit Aerator out with a small batch rye bourbon (doing a before/after taste) -- he said he could defintely taste the difference. After a few uses it appears to work as consistently as the red wine Vinturi Wine Aerator.  I'd recommend both products if you don't want to wait for your drinks to open up on their own.

When I saw this item online, I thought it was a great "excuse" to get one since it'll serve both as a shot glass and an aerator (expensive one at that..!!!)  It actually works.  You can tell the difference when pouring straight out of the bottle vs. through this aerator.  Just like the one for wine, this brings out the bouquet of the spirit and the taste is slightly more pronounced.

I've tried more than a dozen different beans in the past year and even invested in a burr grinder under the assumption that surely, the best coffee will only come from that which is freshly ground (and preferrably recently roasted).<br /><br />I originally bought this coffee as an accident--again, I didn't want anything pre-ground.  The price was highly suspect as well--I'm used to paying around $10-18 for a good pound of coffee.<br /><br />What stuns me is that this has clearly become my favorite espresso.  I don't tire of the flavor and it doesn't taste bitter or harsh or acidic.<br /><br />Give the coffee a try.  I'll be pretty surprised if you don't believe it's the best $20 you ever spent on espresso.

Especially in drinking espressos, rather than lattes, etc., the coffee flavor on this blend is superb and the absence of any bitter taste is immediately noticeable.

review/summary: Kind of natural, at least my dog doesen't throw it up
review/text: My dog pukes on just about every canned dog food.  I can feed her a little of this on some dry food and she almost always keeps it down.  As far as being natural, it looks just about ( and smells) like all the other dog foods.  But you do see an occasional piece of rice or vegetable in there, if those are expensive parts of this dog food, I guess it is better than whatever the other dog foods put in that make Brandy throw up

review/summary: Best value on an outstanding Assam tea!
review/text: If you are a demanding tea totaller as am I, this Assam is a fantastic value. One of the best Assam teas available in the USA - certainly one of the best I've tried - and I've tried many. It has a thick, complex, fruity and malty taste that's strong enough to say "here I am", but not so strong that it masks the classic flavor of a very good black tea. I've paid four and five times more for teas half as good.  This is an excellent choice for breakfast and lunch, taken with milk and sugar, and with honey and lemon it is a delectable treat in the afternoons.

review/summary: I'm a loose tea fan
review/text: I have used loose tea instead of teabags for years.  There is no comparison between the two for flavor.  I buy several different kinds and sometimes mix them together.  The Ahmad tea is a fine base tea for adding other flavors or to stand alone.

review/summary: Made this non-fan of "English breakfast tea", a fan!
review/text: There is a lot of indifferent quality tea out there, and as a sometimes fan of Asian Green, White, and Oolong teas, I should have considered that before I decided that I didn't much like Assam ("English Breakfast Tea"), except as one ingredient in that heady, spicy tea blend called Chai.<br /><br />Okay, I'm wrong.  I just don't like "meh" teas, and even the expensive stuff sold in bookstores and "gourmet" stores can be pretty meh.  I take it that Ahmad Barooti Assam tea doesn't exactly position itself as an ultra-premium blend, and it does tastes pretty much like what any other English Breakfast or even Lipton Yellow Box tastes like -- only much, much sweeter and richer, with a depth of flavor unfamiliar to many of us in the U.S. who would hardly recognize something as tea if it doesn't come in a paper pocket with a tag stapled to it.<br /><br />For newbies to loose tea:  use an infuser.  Those tiny ones you have to pack to get any in there are of no use; tight packed tea resists water infusion.  Some pots have a ceramic infuser, or you could just live with a few leaves in the bottom of your cup -- they won't hurt you a bit.  I'm happy steeping this tea at a ratio of 2 tspns (3-4 grams) per pot, with my pot holding about 2.5 cups of water.<br /><br />As a side note, I'm also fascinated by all the translations to Arabic, Cyrillic (Russian) and what all on the box.  I know that this might reflect a bit of snobbery towards my own country, but I take it as a good endorsement when a tea product is loved in many nations, including the top tea-consuming ones.  (U.S.A. is more of a coffee country, although I'd say we are not picky enough about our coffee, either -- but that's another conversation.)<br /><br />Brook Bond (an Indian favorite) was my previous, and perfectly acceptable choice for Chai blending, but now I have (temporarily) set aside my spices and am enjoying Ahmad Barooti on it's own, or chilled with a splash of ginger syrup.  (Don't know where to refer you to get that; I make mine by whirring chopped ginger root in a blender with water and sugar.  It keeps fresh tasting for a long time, too, in the fridge.)<br /><br />Nice, nice stuff.  Buy loose tea.  Shop around.  And look for recommendations over trusting a fancy container or a fancy price.

review/summary: it is blended low quality, it is not barooti ahmad tea at all
review/text: I have been drinking tea for at least 30 years. I never use tea bags and always make tea using traditional method. I know all different kinds of tea like barooti, etc better than everyone else. I received the package in time but the quality is really bad. I am 100% sure than this is not barooti. Do not buy this kind of tea if you really want good quality. I had to blend it with other kinds but it did not help at all. You can easily see that it is rubbish.

review/summary: Good but not quite good enough
review/text: This product is reasonably easy to make but it is not as easy as similar products available in Ireland (example: Odlums Brown Bread Mix).<br />It also does not have the texture of the Irish made product. Garvey's product uses finely ground flour while Brown Bread in Ireland uses a coarse ground whole wheat flour, giving the final product a "nutty" or "chewable" texture. I was able to reproduce this texture to some extent by adding some whole wheat bran to the mixture when making the bread.<br />Also, I was surprised that I had to obtain buttermilk to add to the mix. This is a requirement when making brown bread from scratch (which I have done) but this is not needed in, for example, Odlums Brown Bread Mix where water is the only ingredient needed.<br />There doesn't seem to be any great advantage in buying Garvey's product over buying ingredients in any grocery store and using any commonly available recipe.

review/summary: Simple and healthy
review/text: I love this bread and bake it every week.  It is incredibly easy, just put the mix in a bowl, add milk and bake for half an hour.  I modify the recipe a little using non-fat milk instead of buttermilk, it is probably slightly less tasty but at least I always have it in the fridge.  Sometimes I add some unflavored greek yoghurt as well.  Also I add a 1/4 cup quaker oatmeal to the mix and am considering trying it with added wheatbran as well.  These create a little more texture and add more fiber. It is pretty common to add oatmeal to this bread in Ireland (at least with the home made recipes - my dad and the neighbors).<br /><br />I try to avoid sugar and white flour; this bread does not contain either of these.  This makes it much healthier than most breads you buy in the supermarket.  I grew up in Ireland and my father used to bake fresh wheaten bread for us every week.  This mix is great, although not quite as good as in Ireland. It is delicious toasted with butter (try Kerry Gold from Trader Joes) and jam.

And, although this snack mix does taste mapley the BBQ taste is still flavorfully evident and it does still taste good:  So, since I tend to dislike maple that says a lot!<br /><br />  Also, this 1.5 ounce bag has less than 180cals and a lot of protein: 15grams Protein per bag, so it's recommended!

review/text: From my wife Sarah: The flavor is decent though not outstanding, but I still use this product since it satisfies my need for variety and I think it's a good choice if you're:<br /><br />1. ON A DIET - I love the 1 ounce packs. They're portable and only 120 calories which is great for a snack or meal replacement if you're keeping low calories and you're out of the house. I find that by the end of the bag I'm very satisfied.<br /><br />2. LOOKING FOR A LOW CARB TREAT - I carry protein bars too, but these have crunch and it's oh so satisfying as a treat with a reasonable carb count.<br /><br />3. EATING GLUTEN FREE - Speaks for itself!<br /><br />4. ON A LOW SUGAR DIET - It's extremely low sugar, and they don't contain the sweeteners that cause a laxative effect.<br /><br />5. NEEDING PROTEIN - 12 grams of protein makes this product a good pick-me-up.<br /><br />I recommend this product, and I think Amazon has a reasonable price - better than what they charge locally and on some other sites I saw. I have Amazon Prime so I don't pay additional shipping, so that helps keep it reasonable.

The Rainforest Mate was one of the three teas we could choose for the service. It is excellent! Before we left Dallas, we bought out the Whole Foods Market (at least the four boxes they had on the shelf). I am glad to see that it is available through Amazon's "Subscribe and Save" program. The flavor is subtle and not at all bitter. As the previous reviewer indicated, I enjoy it with a little bit of sweetner.

I've been drinking 2 cups of this tea daily since 11/21/2009 and I have lost a little over 12 pounds. The inches have come off more than the pounds. I've dropped nearly two pants sizes and one shirt size smaller. I have changed my eating habits a little bit. I'm eating more fruit and vegetables and Weight Watcher approved meals. But I still splurge on pizza and ice cream. I truly believe that the tea has helped burn calories. My complexion is better, my hair is healthier, I feel over-all more energized. I highly recommend this tea to anyone who has had difficulty losing weight, hates exercising, and wants to feel like a million bucks!

review/summary: Better Than Lipton, I Been Duped !
review/text: This is THE best tea that I have ever had, and trust me Ive had my share in my days! From tangerine, to apple spice, and even mint. We wont even talk about the fancy white teas that been floating around these days. But this wu yi tea is very light and refreshing for those who dont like harsh tea that needs thousands of sugars before the bitter black taste fades away. I just put 2 tea spoons and thats it. What makes it better is that I even made iced tea with it, and I found it to get colder than the other brands which make it more refreshing. Dont waste another dollar on Lipton or Celest. This tea is lighter, healthier, and cost less.<br /><br />  As for the weight loss I went from 180 to 173 so far, but I drink 2 cups a day. One cup on my way to work because NYC subways are really cold durring the summer due to air condtioners, and later in the evenning like 6pm cause I keep the air high in my home. But overall I love the price, love the taste, I say go for it!

review/text: Both boxes of Tea came packaged very well. The classic has a rather strong taste to me so I cut it with lemon and add more water. Over all I do enjoy drinking them. I did not buy them for weight loss so I do not drink the tea every day. So I have no idea if they are effective for weight loss.

review/summary: Too expensive and too little flavor.
review/text: If you live close to a Chinese market, you can find the same two products for less money. You can also find higher quality Oolong for 15-20 cents/bag (e.g. Ten Ren or Yama Moto Yama brands)... which are just as economical, since Pier brand takes 3-4 bags to reach the same richness of flavor as the others.<br /><br />If you tend to stick to Lipton and Stash brands, you will probably find these Oolongs refreshing and flavorful.<br /><br />My tea drinking credentials: I drink 3-10 cups daily and have two shelves of loose tea and 3 drawers of teabags. I prefer Oolongs to Black, Blacks to Greens, and have yet to taste a White worth the price.

Because it is not overly sweet, I find it to be more refreshing and thirst quenching than alternative sports drinks. The green tea in it gives a nice little energy boost. It seems to have a good vitamin/electrolyte profile and I have found it to be quite addictive!

review/summary: Easily the highest quality bagged teas on the market
review/text: Mightly Leaf Tea should be considered in a class of it's own for tea.  The leaves and herbs used are extremely fresh.  When you open a plastic (not paper that breathes) pouch, you are immediately hit with the sweet aroma of fresh tea.  I have never smelled another tea bag that even comes close to the freshness.  Even most bulk teas are not packaged correctly or quick enough at the manufacturer to keep this much freshness in the tea.<br /><br />Mighty Leaf Tea is a bit more expensive than other organic tea, however the quality of the leaves and herbs is the highest.  Might Leaf Tea uses large pieces of leaves, herbs, and flowers - unlike most teas that use shreds of leaves.  Shredded tea oxidizes very quickly due to the increased surface area.  This results in tea that loses flavor and smell very quickly.<br /><br />Mighty leaf uses silk bags which have larger pores than paper bags.  This means that the water penetrates the tea bags more fully, allowing the newly tea-infused water to spread to the cup more quickly.  Brewing tea too long will create a bitter taste.  The problem with most paper tea bags is that infused tea water cannot spread quickly enough through the cup to create a bold, full flavor before the 3-5 brewing time has passed.  This means that either your tea is not full flavored or is bitter.  Mighty Leaf solves this problem by using silk bags.<br /><br />Each Mighty Leaf Tea bag is sealed in a plastic pouch.  Since plastic is less porous than paper, these pouches keep the tea and herbs fresher longer.<br /><br />There is nothing to not like about Mighty Leaf Tea.  I only wish that Mighty Leaf Tea started selling Tulsi tea and I would be in Heaven.<br /><br />Mighty Leaf Tea is clearly the creation of tea experts who appreciate the highest quality organic ingredients.  They have created a tea bag system that is far beyond what any other company has done.  Every type of tea that Mighty Leaf Tea offers tastes incredible.  So choose your favorite flavor and enjoy tea as it should be experienced - fresh, bold, and delicious.

review/text: There's a reason France is famous for its cooking.  Those foodies in Provence know what they're doing, and they've concocted a perfect harmony with Herbs De Provence.  Lots of people market this, but Rodelle's is the best, by a mile. You will go crazy for this, especially if you're a cook who has always been a bit hesitant to blend seasonings together.  This one jar has it all, and you can use it a zillion ways-- on fish, chicken or beef, in omelettes, sprinkled over pasta, on salads, stirred into otherwise bland soups or gravies, even stirred into butter so you can use it on veggies, baked potatoes, etc.  It will elevate your food to another level, I promise.  Just two shakes and suddenly you're a French chef!

Fortunately I can now purchase this online from Rodelle.  So happy to be able to once again use Rodelle's Herbes de Provence.

review/summary: Not Bitter at All
review/text: I have tasted several brands of barley tea.  All of the following were cold brewed, including the one I bought here.  One of them was a gift from Japan and wasn't roasted, so it wasn't bitter at all.  One of them was roasted and VERY bitter.  Another one was a mixture of lightly and deeply roasted and tasted okay (not very bitter).  This one I am reviewing however, is excellent in taste.  It isn't bitter at all, even after cold brewing for several days.  The package says it is gently roasted in small quantities.  That, plus the fact that it is organic, I believe is the reason it doesn't have the bitter taste.  If you don't like bitter drinks and want to drink barely tea, this is a great choice.

review/summary: Very Flavorful with a Hint of Spice
review/text: We found this in a spice shop while on vacation.  Being the Maker's Mark lovers that we are, we couldn't resist buying a bottle.  My wife decided that she wanted to make barbeque chicken last night, but realized we were out of barbeque sauce, then she remembered that we had this sauce.  The chicken turned out wonderful.  This sauce has a slightly sweet flavor with a hint of spice.  This is a must try for the Maker's Mark lovers out there.  Well, I have to run, I'm off to buy a case of this sauce on the Web!

review/text: I bought this for my bf since he loves Maker's Mark.  He loved this sauce too, although the bottle is kind of small.  We marinated chicken in it and also used it to dip steak in.  It has a great flavor.  I need to buy more!
