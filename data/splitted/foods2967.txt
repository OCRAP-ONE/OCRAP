review/summary: Not a "Chew", its more like a Jaw-breaker!
review/text: I like Dogswell products and have purchased the "Vitality" Chicken Chews before (which are actually chewy). But these sweet potato chews are hard as a rock! I seriously couldn't even chew them, it was like biting a lolipop or jawbreaker - way too hard.  My dog and my roomie's dog didn't care for them one bit.  I purchased them because they were on sale (deeply discounted) and now I know why....<br /><br />Buy other Dogswell Chews, just not these sweet potato ones...

review/text: Any dog puppy to senior and any breed dog loves these treats.  They go crazy over them!!!  They are healthy too.  I have been buying them for a few years now.  How I first found out about them is I read an article online about the oldest dog to live ate these treats.  So that made me want to buy them for the health of them.  So I do feel good about feeding healthy treats that dogs really like the taste of!!!

review/text: In my search to find yummy treats for my dog, that don't make him sick, I stumbled upon happy hips, which is perfect since my dog is a lab mix predisposed to hip problems.  He loves them!!  In fact he has gotten to the point where he refuses other dog treats.  I love the fact that these are all natural and my only complaint is that it was a little pricey (over $7 per bag) and a little difficult to find.  Well, amazon took care of that!  They came quickly and were quite a deal.  I will purchase again and again.

review/summary: Dogs love them but ... seems to make them sugar high?
review/text: I have two young dogs, a dachshund (1yr) and  a chihuahua (6mths).  I use these to crate train them.  This treat seems to cause them to be overly excited and even after eating, they would go to extremes to try to get more.  Good motivator.  But I am not sure if it's the natural sugar from the banana. I have many different treats for them before but this treat seems to make them super "high" and they had to race many laps in the yard to get off that energy.  Maybe someone who has the same experience can comment on this observation.  Overall, I am satisfied with the price of the item.  I wish the pieces were a little smaller since they are about a quarter size (too big for my small dogs). Recommended not more than 2 pcs a day for small dog under 20lbs.

He just loves these.  They look good and smell good.  As soon as I open the package, he is there waiting.  He seems more active and I am hoping with the glucosamine in these and other glucosamine supplements I give him it helps his arthritis.  Amazon has good prices on these and with ther occasional promotions and free shipping their price can't be beat.

review/summary: My dogs won't eat this!
review/text: My dogs love the Dogswell supplements made from chicken, so I assumed they'd also like the sweet potato supplements.  Neither of them would eat it!  Even my aggressive chewing lab didn't like these.  They're almost impossible to chew (unless I soak them in boiling water for at least 30 minutes, which presumably would leech the nutrients from the chews).  When the lab first tried these, they cut her gums, and when she would leave pieces of the chew on the floor, if I stepped on them before noticing them, they'd cut my foot!  I noticed this about ALL the varieties of Dogswells Sweet Potato Chews.  I threw them all out.

review/summary: Great Substitute for Freebirds Chicken Apple Wedges When You Can't Find Them.
review/text: Our dogs love the Freebird chicken apple wedges, but the economic two-pound bag is too hard to find since I purchased them at here-today-gone-tomorrow Costco.  The small bags are a bit pricey BUT they're not made in China.  My brother always insisted that we only buy dog food made in the USA when we had our three labs.  Now I have a beagle and a blue heeler with my guy, and we are always trying to treat them for good behavior.  I found and buy these at Petco.  The bag has more content than the usual packs of Freebirds, and they like them as well, but I didn't realize until reading other reviewer comments where they came from.  Filled with condroitin and glucosamine for the mature dog with hip problems (the blue heeler), I thought I'd give them a try.  Though I don't see any distinct improvement in our 12 year-old Sydney's hips, I don't see anything detrimental either.  They come to the cupboard after coming in from outside or a bath just as before and gobble them down like a kid with candy.  The China factor makes me a little uneasy, especially at that price, but I see no ill effects thus far.  I asked my vet today what she thought, and she said that they're probably fine as long as they're not recalled, but the laws in China are less strict about what they put in their products.  It makes me wonder if I want to risk my dogs being a recall factor if that should happen, so use your own judgement.  All I know is that my own canines love them, and others here seem to have no problem with them either.

review/text: My granddog stayed with me while my son was deployed to Afghanistan, and I found these special treats for her. They seemed unique, and healthy, so I gave them a try. She loves them! I only give her one a day, after dinner as dessert. She knows what that word means, and will whine if I wait too long to give it to her. She is an older dog, and does have some joint issues, so I really like that these treats have glucosamine and chondroitin. Who knew that dogs like apples!

Of course I would rather he eat something somewhat healthy and I have bought many 15 oz. bags of Happy Hips treats through local merchandisers for around $18.99 a bag (plus tax).  Comes to a little over $20 a bag.  Three 15 oz. bags through Amazon with shipping - around $35, vs. three 15 oz. bags through local retailers - over $60.  Same great product - do the math.

review/text: The Dogswell Happy Hips Sweet Potato Chews I bought from Amazon were stale.  I have bought these before, in local stores, and they are supposed to be pliable and "chewy".  Although the bags had expiration dates that were in code, each bag I opened, contained "stale" chews.  They broke like crackers and I could hear my dog chomping on them like a bone.  I buy them so I can bend them over and put them in her toys or bones - she can spend a lot of time trying to get at the "treat".  With these, all I could do was feed them to her like snack crackers.  I was very disappointed.  I will continue to buy them, as they are a good product, just not from Amazon.

I use this Rajah Mild Madras Curry Powder in the recipe and it turns out fantastic. I've made it numerous times now and we always serve it with peach chutney which really makes it delicious. This curry powder has a full flavor but the recipe I use still calls for cinnamon, paprika, grated ginger and garlic. You also add in tomato paste, yogurt and coconut milk. After you make the sauce you just cook pieces of chicken in the boiling sauce for ten minutes and your meal is ready. The ingredients in this curry powder include: Coriander, Turmeric, Mustard, Bengal Gram (Black Chickpea), Cumin, Chilli, Fenugreek, Black Pepper, Garlic Powder, Salt and Fennel.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: If you're undecided between purchasing this mild variety and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JSM178">Rajah Madras Curry Powder (Hot) - 3.5oz</a> because you don't like your curry *too* hot, I'd suggest starting with this one.  It has a nice flavor and more of a kick than expected - which gives me the idea the hot one would be really hot.<br /><br />The cannister looks like a short version of a baking powder can with no shaker holes on top.  When you take off the lid, there's your curry.  I had kept my last empty McCormick bottle that has a shaker top, so I just filled it with the Rajah curry powder for easier dispensing.<br /><br />I was looking for curry that was cheaper than what's in my local stores and at the time of purchase this was 5 bucks with free shipping.  I've used it on rice and popcorn already and it was delicious on both.  AND it's good for you.  Google "curry powder health benefits" and you'll find plenty of results; it's best known for its benefits to digestion and for anti-inflammatory qualities, but also said to boost memory and protect against Alzheimer disease and cancer.

Only get alittle morning and evening sun, full shade rest of the day. Please do your research about these plants, very toxic, I planted with surgical gloves to protect my hands from possible sap. Can't wait for my flowers to bloom.

review/summary: Lovely!
review/text: When my first shipment arrived, it was during the hottest time this year. So I was sad to open my box to find I had sent my little plants to their doom. I contacted the seller "9Greenbox" immediately and informed them of what had happened. I got an email the next day asking if I wanted a refund or another shipment to send. I had picked the plant of course, and shortly after I had my new plant. I was very pleased with the customer service. My plants arrived packaged very well. A damp towel had even been placed inside the pot of my olive tree which I had ordered with my desert rose to prevent over-heating from happening a second time. My desert rose is beautiful! I had sent it as a gift to my boyfriend and he is so pleased with how much it has already taken off. I have many new leaves shooting out and I am looking forward to seeing it bloom. This plant is wonderful, I intend to find and purchase more since it has been so easy to take care of. Thank you 9Greenbox!

review/summary: Beautiful plant, but NOT Miss Beauty
review/text: I had ordered the Miss Beauty Desert Rose.  According to the picture, the flower clearly has red boarders with a distinct white center.  I received my plant about a month ago, which came in decent condition (understandably most of the leaves had yellowed and fallen due to shock), potted the plant, and it has been responding well.  Since then, I had ordered THREE more different types of Desert Roses from this seller.  I have waited a month now for the plant to finally bloom (i live in nyc, where the climate is not ideal), and to my dismay, the flower is the usual PINK and not the red one pictured!  I am going to give the seller 2 stars for now, as I am waiting for a response on how this can be rectified.<br /><br />-UPDATE- The seller has contacted me in a timely manner and has offered to give me a full refund or to send me the plant I wanted at no charge.  I'm crossing my fingers and hope that all will work out smoothly.  From 2 to now 5 stars, I can't ask for anything more!  Plus the other adeniums I ordered are all doing well, although they just haven't bloomed yet.  If they all turn out to be what I ordered, I will definitely order from this seller again!

Until it does I wont know which one it is as none of the 3 I received, all different, had its individual name on it.<br />With living in the Dominican Republic I can say they were in transit longer than normal and their leaves had fallen off. Very quickly though they grew new ones. Since being here they have been subjected to tropical daily downfalls of rain which bothered me being as they are a dessert plant. It dosnt seem to have affected them though as they continue to grow. I did plant them with lots of stone chippings in the pot. They seem to be doing very well.

review/text: Over the past many years I have used several different electrolyte solutions and Vitalyte works the best for me. Using Vitalyte I find that I stay far better hydrated and energized than drinking water alone or when compared to many other electrolytes that I've tried. It isn't too sweet and only mildly sticky. The less sweet taste and electrolyte blend makes it easy on your stomach and that is important on long rides when water or other brands can cause stomach upset.<br /><br />In summary...I have found the product that works for me and no longer need to look for a better solution.

review/text: ...this is no better than the competing brands (Tully's, Green Mountain, etc.) that have been out long before Starbucks decided they (finally) had to jump on the Keurig bandwagon. In fact, to me it tastes very close to Newman's Own Extra Bold blend. So while it's good, it doesn't have the intensity of flavor that you get at their stores, and therefore not worth the higher price. I'm still going to try their Sumatra and House Blend but Pike's Place k-cup is a little disappointing. My personal favorite is still Tully's House Blend.

review/text: Starbucks Pike Place Roast provides the advertised Medium Roast blend.  The bonus is that it has a slight kick to it, so it makes for a nice morning cup of coffee.<br /><br />However, the downside is that there is a slight burnt coffee aftertaste to this blend, so that is the reason for my 3 star rating.  For nice medium blend, slight kick coffees with no burnt coffee aftertaste, try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VXFKSA">Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Vienna Coffee House (Medium Roast), 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Coffee People, Donut Shop K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>.

review/summary: The price is NOT right
review/text: As avid Keurig users - and Tassimo converts - we were thrilled to finally find Starbucks K-cups had arrived. I purchased 1 box of 16 K-cups for $21.90  - Pike's PlaceRoast - here on Amazon.  And the taste didn't disappoint. We were very satisfied with it and feel it rivals the taste of a cup purchased at a Starbucks store. Unfortunately, the price also rivals that of a cup purchased at a Starbucks store.<br /><br />Here's the math. We have been drinking Caribou Blend coffees to this point.<br /><br />Caribou Blend on average = $0.67/cup<br />Starbucks =  $1.37/cup<br /><br />We understand that Starbucks is a "premium" coffee and don't expect it to be cheap. Caribou is also premium coffee and we can afford to by either. But on principle, suspecting Starbucks Corporate folks set the price, we've decided to stay with Caribou. Based on our household coffee consumption, we would pay a whopping $1,660.00/year more to have Starbucks. So we're going to vote with our $$ and stick with Caribou.  (For those of you who are Kindle owners, this feels like the publisher price gouging we experienced when they set prices at 50% more than Amazon's.)

Yes, they are a bit pricey, but they were just released, to give the product a 1 star review just because they cost a bit more then the average k-cup, is just ridiculous! Besides, it is way cheaper then going and getting a cup at Starbucks!

review/summary: Delicious & Healthy Dark-Chocolate Almond Treat
review/text: A nutritionist recommended Kashi products to me. If you're hankering for a Snickers candy bar, these might not satisfy you. However, I actually prefer the taste of these to a candy bar now. They're not heavy. And you feel good after you eat them. If you want a crunchy, nutty, dark chocolate treat that is actually healthy for you, you may want to try these. One bar is 4g of fiber or 15% of your daily requirement. 80% of adults don't get enough fiber, so these are an easy and tasty way to get some. They are low in sugar--only 6 gms--about the same as in a cup of Cheerios or Total.<br /><br />The nutritionist said to think of sugar as poison--your body wants to eliminate sugar before fat, so stay low in sugar. I keep one of these bars in my purse when I'm out doing errands in case I get hungry. I love the dark chocolate chips and nutty crunch of the almonds. Almonds are a great source of vitamin E and are recommended for nutrition. One bar at 130 calories is quite satisfying and is a great go-to treat when you want a little sweetness in your day. These are great for after dinner, too, when you want something semi-sweet and not heavy.<br /><br />One bar is only 3 points on Weight Watcher's point system. I took a box to my Weight Watcher's meeting to recommend them for a healthy snack. I've lost 30 pounds and reversed diabetes in the past 2 years eating healthy foods: low-sugar, low-fat natural vegetable/fruits/protein/dairy diet with little to no artificially flavored and processed foods. These bars are my treat when I'm desiring a little fun without the guilt. Now that nutritionists say a little bit of dark chocolate is good for you every day, these are a non-guilty pleasure.  I haven't found a chocolate dessert treat that's lower in calories/sugar and healthier. I always keep a box of these chewy dark mocha almond granola bars in the house.

review/summary: Healthy, delicious and addictive [crunch, crunch]
review/text: I was suspicious [crunch] of another wholesome snack promising a "nourishing mix of goodness" [munch, munch]. What a tasty surprise...[crunch, crunch]...cocoa and a hint of cinnamon. Seriously. Where's the milk? [munch]<br /><br />Marketed for health & wellness customers, the package touts whole grain oats, sesame seeds and whole brown rice. One serving of Sweet Cinnamon Crispy Thins is 46 pieces (there's plenty of snacking) and only packs 120 calories.<br /><br />Health benefits aside, this snack can attract fans based on taste alone. The texture reminds me of breakfast cereal more than granola. The cocoa and cinnamon match adult tastes, i.e. the flavors are rich without becoming overwhelmingly sweet after you eat a couple pieces.<br /><br />The company also offers a Red Raspberry flavor and suggests pairing its "Savory Sea Salt" flavor with a glass or red wine. I agree. Either the Sweet Cinnamon or Red Raspberry flavors would taste great sprinkled atop yogurt.<br /><br />On another positive note, I didn't detect the artificial sweetener aftertaste so common with health & wellness snacks. Eat.Think.Smile uses dried cane syrup in their crispy thins.<br /><br />Eat.Think.Smile products are produced by Apure Foods Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Hershey Company. The snacks, manufactured in the United States, come in a re-sealable pouch. I read this eye-catching information from the company website:<br /><br />"We blend Cocoa Lavado with natural cocoa to create a premium blend of cocoa present in all Eat. Think.Smile(tm) products. Cocoa Lavado literally means "washed cocoa." The Cocoa Lavado beans are washed by hand on a small scale, possibly how the Mayans processed it traditionally. The cocoa powder produced from these beans delivers higher levels of flavanol antioxidants than the alkalized cocoa powder commonly used in food products. Our natural cocoa powder delivers higher levels of flavanol antioxidants than alkalized cocoa powder commonly used in food products. The natural cocoa in each serving delivers more antioxidant power than a cup of green tea."<br /><br />In summary, the Sweet Cinnamon Crispy Thins win on two counts: they are all natural with a lot of antioxidant power and, more importantly, they are delicious. In fact, [crunch] I'm still thinking about pouring milk over these for breakfast [munch]; or maybe I'll open a bag and pop the cork on a bottle of red wine.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.

review/text: I love chocolate, and I love cinnamon.  I, of course, for sure thought these would be a huge win.  Sadly, they're kind of not.  Its not that they're bad.  They aren't.  Its just that they're not really good either.  They're forgettable.  You don't want to eat the whole bag - which could be a good thing if you have self control issues.  My problem - I feel like 6 bags of these will last forever.<br /><br />They have an impressive serving size (46 pieces per 120 calorie serving/appox 6 per bag) but then I doubt I'd even want to eat that many.  About the size of a goldfish cracker, in the shape of a triangle, you'll find a kind of chocolate tasting, kind of cinnamon tasting cracker cookie with sesame seeds on the top.  It tastes confused.  Not really like chocolate, not really like cinnamon.  Why are there sesame seeds?<br /><br />They're just okay.<br /><br />I ate them in desperation when I had nothing else that looked good to snack on, but haven't touched them since.  They're doomed to remain open but forgotten.<br /><br />I was honestly hoping for something that tasted like a marriage of the chocolate/cinnamon teddy grahams - but healthier with less sugar. Sadly, these are nowhere close.

review/text: Being on a health kick for the last couple years, I am always on the lookout for tasty snacking alternatives.  The Eat Think Smile brand boasts an all natural snack with the natural antioxidant of cocoa.  The product is small bit size and fun to eat except for a flavor that is listed as Sweet Cinnamon you can barely taste the cinnamon at all as the taste is vastly overpowered by the taste of cocoa from the first bite to long after you finish thanks to a strong aftertaste.  It is alright but the type of food I would only reach for if the rest of my cupboard is bare.  It is also nice that the bag is re-sealable to keep the food fresh.

The great thing about the product is I could identify & pronounce all the ingredients in the crispy thins. And if the claim is true about having antioxidants, then all the better! Even if it doesn't, it's still a great snack and very different from what is normally on grocer's shelves.

review/text: The combination of cocoa, cinnamon and sesame seemed like an odd one, but it works!  The packaging also indicates there are oats and brown rice included, although it's the cocoa and cinnamon which are most noticeable.<br />While I'd say the 120 calorie serving size, with six servings in a bag, is optimistic, this snack is probably healthier than most, so the calories are well spent.

review/summary: A Sweet Snack
review/text: I tried both this flavor and the sea salt flavor, and have to say that this was the better of the two.  These snacks are basically puffed grains mixed with cocoa, and covered with cinnamon and sesame seeds.  I expected to like these.  I love chocolate.  I love chocolate mixed with cinnamon.  That said, these snacks simply weren't all that good, and I'm having a hard time on putting my finger on why I don't like them.  I think perhaps it's that there's too much chocolate.  The good thing about these snacks is that I have no desire to keep eating them- there's no addictive impulse here, so I'll quit eating them once my satisfied.  That's also the bad thing, though, as if I'm going to eat a processed snack food I'd like it to be tastier.<br /><br />As for the claims surrounding this product, I think claims of "antioxidant power" in processed food are always questionable.  I certainly think they're questionable here.  Without the cocoa (which is what supposedly provides the antioxidant power) this would be a pretty good snack.

review/text: I have to say, after eating the bars that I got through vine here:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005BPVE5Y/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title<br /><br />I really was afraid to try these.  The bars are AWFUL, but surprisingly, these are pretty good.  They taste a bit like a cinnamon cereal.  They have a nice crunch, and I like the sesame seeds on them.  You can't really taste any of the cocoa in them, all you taste is the cinnamon.  (Which is good, because I don't think chocolate and cinnamon flavors mesh very well.)<br /><br />My husband, who despises any of the stuff I get with natural ingredients, really liked these.  And also my 5-year-old did as well!  They're a good snack, and I would get them again.

review/text: If you like the flavor of cocoa, you will probably like these. They are light and crunchy in a way similar to another snack product that has a cheetah for its mascot. They are all sort of triangular in shape and about a quarter of an inch thick.<br />I didn't really notice much cinnamon flavor, but the cocoa comes through quite strong.<br />They have sesame seeds on them, but still taste sweet through and through. The sesame seeds add texture than flavor.<br /><br />I'm a choco-holic, but not a big fan of cocoa.<br />I thought they were ok. I didn't feel the need or desire to eat handfulls of them at a time, which is really a good thing.

review/summary: A surprisingly addictive, all-natural chocolate-intense snack.
review/text: If you think healthy "natural" snacking has to be synonymous with bland or unpleasant, think again.<br />Eat. Think. Smile. Sweet Cinnamon Crispy Thins are actually a fun, tasty, surprisingly addictive treat--that is, once you get beyond the first bite, which does admittedly have an initial "health food" vibe.<br /><br />But the lasting impressing on your taste buds is one that comes surprisingly close to the taste of the tops of brownies.  Despite the so-called Sweet Cinnamon flavor, what really comes through is a generous kick of cocoa, provided by the company's trademarked blend of two cocoas--one African and the other an anti-oxidant-packed Meso-American variety called Lavado.<br /><br />For those who aren't dark chocolate fans, it could seem overpowering, but I like it.  I also appreciate the fact that each six-ounce bag gives you approximately six 120-calorie servings of a generous 46 pieces each--although your chocolate craving should be satisfied long before popping that many.<br /><br />Personally, I could live without the sesame seeds on top, which sort of conflict with that brownie-like experience, but it's a minor quibble for a healthy snacking alternative.

review/text: ETS's crispy thins are basically 1/2 inch triangular snacks that pretty tasty and good bang for the buck.<br /><br />The treats are very crunch and can be eaten as a cereal if desired.  They aren't too sweet and one serving (around 46 pieces) is pretty filling while only packing 120 calories.  (The snacks are so filling that I almost wonder if this accurate).  They have a very subtle cinnamon taste and like all ETS products, they also have a very subtle cocoa taste as well.<br /><br />The packaging easily opens and closes and keeps freshness.  Out of the three ETS products I have now experiences, this is by far my favorite.

review/summary: I like these a lot
review/text: Something about these puffy little cinnamon-chocolate snacks reminds me of eating breakfast cereal as a snack. They're not quite crackers, they're not quite cookies. They're also not very "thin" despite the name. They're more puffy than that. They're sweet, crunchy, and tasty, with a nice chocolate punch. A single serving serves me as a satisfying treat, without having a lot of fat or calories. Some vanilla soy milk or green tea is a nice accompaniment. I haven't tried red wine yet, but I bet that would be good too.<br /><br />My husband thought they seemed a bit too "health food". They're definitely not candy, like he was hoping for. But if you want something that is sweet, salty, crunchy, and chocolately, while still being relatively good for you, these are perfect.<br /><br />The chocolate is pretty intense. I do wonder if eating a lot of these would have a stimulant effect.

review/summary: A healthy snack with subtle sweetness
review/text: I have to say that I wasn't a fan of these at first; they tasted a bit too much like cocoa powder, but over time they've really grown on me.  They tasted best when eaten right after a slightly spicy lunch, so maybe this made them a bit sweeter.  Overall, though they are not a very sweet snack, although they do have a hint of sweetness due to the dried cane syrup.  The most predominant flavor is the cocoa, followed by a strong hint of cinnamon, and the texture is very crunchy.<br /><br />This is probably not the snack for someone with a monster sweet tooth who likes a very sugary flavor to their snacks.  But for those preferring a more natural, slightly sweet flavor, this snack will be a good match.  What really sold me on it was the nutritional value.  A serving size is pretty decent for only 120 calories, and that comes along with 8% of your daily fiber, 10% of your daily calcium, and, according to the package, "more natural antioxidant power than a cup of green tea."  I also like that the ingredients are natural and that it's made with whole grains.  I'm glad I didn't give up on it after the first try, because I've been very pleasantly surprised by the taste which has grown on me, and best of all I can feel good about eating this snack.

review/summary: If you're not into "super sweet," these might be for you
review/text: When I first tried this product, I did not really care for it. I decided to give it a few more chances over a week or so, and now I'd have to say that I like it more than I did at first (hence the 4 stars instead of 1!).<br /><br />First of all, I am a person who likes things that I consider super sweet. I am a health nut and my craze for sweet foods is a killer; I've tried so many times to rid my place of sugary stuff, only to have chocolate given to me as a gift or falling to temptation while grocery shopping. I decided to give these treats a try; while not exactly 100% healthy, they are a much better option than eating that candy bar or piece of pie.<br /><br />I was not happy with these at first because they really aren't *that* sweet, and like I said, I really like sweet things. I've only recently begun to like dark chocolate in the past few years; these remind me of the amount of sweetness you'd find in various types of dark chocolate. I wasn't sure how I felt about the hint of cinnamon, and the sesame seeds threw me for a loop.<br /><br />After giving myself various opportunities to try this product, I decided that once I knew what to expect (only a hint of sweetness instead of a slap in the face of sweetness!), they tasted better to me. I like the hint of cinnamon. I'm still not 100% crazy for the sesame seeds (that keeps me from awarding the 5th star), but it's not like they're so horrible that I refuse to finish the package.<br /><br />Overall, I say that you should know what to expect when eating these, and then you might not be as thrown for a loop when you try them. Don't expect them to be as sweet as, say, Cocoa Puffs cereal, but DO expect them to give you that slight hint of chocolate that might just satisfy your craving (without going crazy on calories).

review/summary: They are addictive little critters...just make sure you are eating an ounce
review/text: I really love these crispy thins.  They remind me of really good dark chocolate bars with chili and cinnamon in them.  Yes, I even added some chili to get a true Mayan taste out of these.  I did however think that there weren't six servings in a bag.  I did measure it out and an ounce is about 39-40 thins not 46 like the packaging claims.  Which makes five servings, not six.  I measured this a few times with my scale and got 39-40 thins in an ounce.  I think one of the addictive properties of this blend is the cane sugar and it has a lot of it, so I tend to only have an ounce at a time, if I can drag myself away.  I could easily eat six ounces of this product without thinking...just eat without the think but I would be smiling! :)  It has a good sweet cinnamon taste, if they added a little chili or had a chili cinnamon flavor, it would probably be one of the best treats ever.  This also works as cereal or blended with oatmeal, I've tried eating them a lot of ways.  They do remind me of a luxury level Count Chocula, the cocoa used is very flavorful and the addition of rice and sesame seeds works with the cane sugar and cocoa.  I am not sure if this is health food, but I don't really care.  I love it anyway.  :)

review/summary: Tasty, but not exactly a health food bomb
review/text: Everything about this product seems to scream health food.  From the product name to its packaging to its touting of the many healthy ingredients used, it looks like it's some sort of wonder health food.  Yet a quick look at the ingredient list reveals that the very first ingredient is...sugar.<br /><br />Now, I'm not saying that this is necessarily a problem in and of itself.  If you're looking for a sweet treat and you're debating between, say, this and a candy bar, I'd definitely urge you to go for this.  However, it's certainly worth noting that this product has a lot of added sugar so, for all its otherwise fairly healthy ingredients, you'd be better off eating some fruit or a slice of whole grain bread with whole fruit spread.<br /><br />However, as a treat, I think these little bites are nice.  I like the crunch and the contrasting textures of the oats and sesame seeds.  The serving size is generous--over 40 bites--but the pieces are small, so you may not be getting as much as you think you are.  Still, because these are so full of contrasting textures, I find that I only need a small amount to satisfy a serious chocolate craving.  They have a nice cocoa flavor without being overly sweet, and the cinnamon adds a nice, warm touch.<br /><br />It didn't really surprise me that I liked these crackers; the real challenge was my kids.  Both my eight-year-old and my two-year-old like them, though, so they serve as a decent alternative to graham crackers.

review/summary: A Tasty, Healthy Snack
review/text: The Sweet Cinnamon flavor Crispy Thins from Eat. Think. Smile. are an interesting snack idea.  The underlying concept of all of their products is that their cocoa is not alkalized the way that most is preserving more natural antioxidants.  That is all well and good, but it still comes down to taste, right?  I like chocolate and cinnamon, and I found these to be pretty good.  The texture is a little different, but I don't mind it.  The only thing I would change would be to make the pieces bigger.  If you wish to stick to a single serving, you would be stuck counting out 46 (that is not a typo!) pieces.  They should triple the size to make the serving come in around 15 or so, and it would be like most snack crackers.  Otherwise I think they are a hit.  If you are looking for a healthy sweet snack and like chocolate and cinnamon, give these a try.  The taste starts out chocolate with a cinnamon finish.

review/text: I am pregnant, so I am trying to eat as healthy as I can for the baby. When I saw this, I thought it would be a great snack for me to snack on at work when I get my chocolate cravings. They are very chocolatey, almost reminds me of the cereal coco pebbles but more bitter chocolate taste than sweet, an adult version. I get a touch of the cinnamon taste as well in each bite. I like them, easy to eat the bag in one sitting if you are not careful though.<br /><br />I was a little weary of sesame seeds and chocolate but it I like the combination. Although, on the front of the bag it shows a lot more sesame seeds on a crisp than it really is in the bag. Actually the front of the bag makes the crisps almost unappealing because at first glance it looks like meat instead of crispy thins, especially with the sesame seeds on it. But, you can't judge a book by its cover because once you open it up and get a whiff of the chocolate and start eating it, any thoughts of meat are gone.<br /><br />It is 46 pieces per serving and it has about 6 serving in it. 120 calories, 4g fat, 30 mg sodium, 9g sugar.

review/text: This is the perfect snack when you're in the mood for something chocolatey and something crunchy.  The snack has a rich chocolate/cocoa taste with a hint of cinnamon; if you're looking for a strong cinnamon flavor, you may be disappointed. i found it to be a lighter flavoring which I though was just right. Though the first ingredient is sugar (dried cane syrup), these aren't very sweet and i think they would appeal more to adults than to children.<br /><br />A serving size is 46 (!) pieces, with about 6 servings in a bag. Each triangular piece is about 1/2 inch. A serving has 120 calories with 35 calories from fat. Total fat for a serving is 4g (of which 0.5g is saturated, none of which is trans fat); no cholesterol, and 30 mg sodium (1% of your daily value); total carbohydrate is 22g (7% of your daily value) of which dietary fiber is 2g (8%) and sugar is 9g.<br /><br />Though a serving size sounds large, these are really addicting - it's easy to just keep eating them.

review/text: I've used this product for recipes and it does a good job flavor-wise. However I purchased in the airtight can with resealable lid and if you are fortunate enough to get a loose powder when you first open the can, it doesn't stay that way long. It becomes rock hard and unable to work with. I believe it's just as simple to resort to the simple standby of milk with a bit of vinegar for recipes that require less than a cup of buttermilk. If a recipe requires more than that, just get the real thing. I still keep this product on hand as standby but I know to not anticipate getting more than 1 TB out by scratching it from the chunk. There comes a point when even that doesn't work tho. Flavor and convenience-wise, this product would be ok if they could conquer that issue.

review/summary: Finestkind!
review/text: The 8:00 coffee brand was originally imported by the Atlantic and Pacific Trading company back when ships were powered by sail. They opened up trade routs to Asia and Africa and were known for the finest imported goods and spices. They later became the A&P grocery stores which today have another name but their coffee continues to be some of the best around. It is also some of the least expensive bean coffee available in stores. Since they sell a lot it is always fresh which is very important. I have used it for many years.

review/summary: Good Coffee, but not the best
review/text: I got this on the subscribe-and-save program and used it for a couple of shipments. It is a rather mild blend, and I really prefer a more robust flavor, hard to find in a decaf. It could not be made stronger by adding more, either, it just got more bitter. So, I shopped around and found I could get other brands of decaf that were a bit stronger-tasting for about the same price, so I cancelled my subscription.  I don't think this coffee is bad, just not my taste.

review/summary: Great whole bean coffee
review/text: Purchased this because we switched to Decaf on doctor's recommendation..  Signed up for the bi-monthly automatic shipment plan.  The coffee is great, the plan ISN'T!!!  One shipment and then messages stating temporarily out of stock, we'll let you know when, etc. etc....<br />Finally cancelled... Don't know why AMAZON offers something and then can't deliver... This is definitely not the norm...  Would have been only one or two stars, but the coffee is good.

review/summary: Least disappointing decaf
review/text: Let's face it, there's no such thing as a really good decaf coffee.  I've tried EVERY brand that I've heard about and the Eight O'Clock 100% Decaf whole bean is the least disappointing decaf I've tried.  I give it four stars because it is at least tolerable (my doctor told me that I HAD to quit caffeinated coffee).

review/summary: no aroma...no flavor
review/text: I bought this because others have said that this was really good decaffeinated coffee.  When I opened my package,I was disappointed that there was no aroma.  None! I was also disappointed with the lack of flavor.  I checked the expiration date on the bottom of the package and the date was three months from expiration.  Perhaps I received a batch that had been mishandled somehow.  Basically it had little flavor and in my opinion it was also slightly more acidic than what I expected.

review/summary: Amazon never followed through
review/text: I ordered 4 bags of Eight Oclock coffee with the agreement that I would be shipped 4 bags each month.  I received the first order.  THen I got an email telling me there was a problem with my card and they would not ship the next shipment.  After some investigatory phone calls, I found there was nothing wrong with my card.  Amazon couldn't make good on their committment to me as a subscriber.  They told me it was their fault and would send it when they received the product.  Sounds to me like they made a deal and can't keep it.  Haven't received anything or a word from them.  Totally dissatisfied with this deal.

review/summary: Some trouble along the way, but great in the end.
review/text: I originally ordered this product under a listing offering a pretty deep discount, which turned out to have been a pricing error.  My order was canceled, and there was some confusion getting things straightened out, but Godiva called me today to let me choose an equivalent product free of charge.<br /><br />The quality of Godiva chocolate was never in question for me personally, and I ended up being quite happy with their quality of service as well.

review/summary: Ok but not the best
review/text: A friend told me that this was for all chocolate lovers and the best. It took forever getting here, the shipping and handling bump it to a unnecessary $20 and the candy wasnt spectacular. The box pretty and gold but the 8 pieces were small for $15. The milk chocolate was good but rest with that jelly filling esp white chocolate with raspberry was nasty so basically I just paid for the name and special packaging! Like paying for a cold big mac when you could of gotten a whooper or whataburger for the money worth! Ill stick to caramello, dove, gharardelli, or low budget reeses!!

review/text: I suppose it depends on what your tastes are, but these were not my faveorite. The milk chocolate was very smooth which was a plus. I don't care much for dark chocolate. maybe these weren't the best selection. They were good, but I would rather buy Lindt.

review/text: I had no problem receiving these chocolates on time. They didn't cancel anything, so I don't know what all these reviewers are talking about. These are the best chocolates I ever ate. They are actually worth the 14 bucks and in a whole 'nother league than Hershy or Nestle.

review/summary: yuck
review/text: I advise to take a look at the ingredients in this tea. I believe there are licorice and fennel seeds, among other things.<br /> When I drank it the first time, it was just yucky. The second time, I tried mixing it with black tea and I just couldn't handle it.<br />I have no idea if it helps breathing because I cant get through a cup of it.<br /><br />I will, however, mention that other Yogi teas are great (my favorite is the Vanilla Spice energy).
