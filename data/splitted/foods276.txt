review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I bought these beans hoping they would be good quality, but I was disappointed upon opening the package to see how many broken beans there were and how much dust was at the bottom of each bag.<br /><br />Those which weren't split in the bag came apart during the soaking.  This means my cooked beans will look even worse<br /><br />I am used to Greek 'giant limas', which soak to become huge and remain whole in the process. Now I've got a huge quantity of a product I don't want.<br /><br />I was annoyed to see that Amazon will not accept returns for food products, because I think this is really inferior quality.

review/summary: SUPERB!
review/text: Ordinarily, you have to pick through packages of lima beans and sort out the chipped, split and discolored ones.  Not so with these ivory colored limas, all perfectly formed and unblemished.  All you have to do is rinse.<br /><br />I didn't soak them overnight as per instructed.  Just soaked them in hot water for an hour, rinsed, and then cooked until done.  They worked out fine and they make a very smooth, tasty bean.<br /><br />There is a most interesting recipe on the packets called "Cool Lima Beans and Couscous Salad" which I can't wait to make.  It requires olive oil, sherry vinegar, ground cumin, red and green bell peppers and other ingredients.  The couscous they recommend is Golden.  Bob's Red Mill also has this product.  Yum!<br /><br />These beans are natural and, of course, they are large.  I'm going to make them a permanent staple in my home.

review/text: This are the nicest dry large limas I have ever seen. Definitely keeping them on subscription. The bags are big enough I get two pots of beans from each bag. The beans are clean and smooth, not broken up or dirty, I didn't have to pick them over at all. Made a delicious pot of bean soup with ham bone, onions garlic a little diced bacon, diced carrots, a little salt and water to cover. Didn't even have to soak the beans and the soup was done in about 90 min, thick, creamy and delicious. Not a bite was left. Highly recommend these! Nicer than any I've ever bought in the grocery store.

review/text: I was making the "Marinated Gigante Bean Salad with Shrimp" from Gwyneth Paltrow's Cookbook ("My Father's Daughter") and needed some large, white beans.  I wanted to use the Gigante Beans from Navarro, but they're a bit pricey for a small jar.  (I'll use those occasionally.)  I found these as a nice alternative and I don't think I've ever seen them in stores??  I noticed someone said they're getting harder to find, so I'm glad to have gotten the bulk size.  They worked out just fine in the recipe (quite good, in fact) and if I'm missing something by not getting the special beans from Navarro, from our local Spanish food specialty shop, I don't know it.

review/summary: Surprisingly Good, Even if You Aren't a Caffeine Addict
review/text: I bought Kicking Horse 454 Horsepower coffee for my mother after reading the reviews on Amazon, and I'm glad I did.  She's a hard woman to shop for, with few hobbies but an endless capacity for drinking coffee, not quite mechanically-advanced enough to roast her own, but a coffee snob for sure.  When my mom opened up the gift bag with these tins of coffee, she popped the lid on one and stuck her nose in, inhaled deeply and immediately left the room to brew a pot.  This was a Christmas morning gift; she literally brought our gift-opening to a complete halt because she wanted a cup of the Kicking Horse coffee instead of what had already been brewed.  It was a well-received gift, to say the least.<br /><br />Dark, oily, velvety and rich beans produce a cup with the same quality.  My mother was in whole bean coffee heaven and the whole house filled with the intense aroma.  I'm a coffee drinker too, though compared with my mother that's sort of like looking at the Titanic, flipping your kayak, and saying you've had a boating accident too.  Nonetheless, I was pleasantly surprised to find the brew palatable to me.  Many of her dark roasts either taste too bitter in my mouth, or wind up upsetting my stomach; I didn't have either problem with Kicking Horse.<br /><br />I highly recommend Kicking Horse Coffee.  With my mother's birthday on the horizon, at least I now know to give her the coffee at the very end of the party!

I was introduced to it by Canadian friends of mine when they gave it to me as a gift.<br />Well, it took the first pot that we made to know that this was a keeper. The flavor is wonderful - dark and intense but not so much that it has no taste. Some of the dark roast coffees that we have tried have very little taste.<br />I am ordering this on a regular basis now from Amazon, of course.

review/text: I've been taste-testing a few different coffees on Amazon: this one, Kicking Horse's Kick A$$ Dark, and several of Raven's Brews.  This one has the best flavor so far for my taste: strong, rich, smoky, and low acid.  Not super complex, maybe very slight hints of chocolate, but no off flavors or unpleasant background or aftertaste.  This roast is stronger and darker than the KickA$$.

review/text: Been drinking ALL the Kicking Horse coffees exclusively since we visited British Columbia three years ago. The 454 was the first I tried, and it was love at first drink. It's still my favorite. It's a very strong coffee. None of the coffees give me heartburn like that extremely popular Star[something] does. I use the Krups grind and brew system on "strong" and I wake up looking for the "ON" button. If you like less strong coffee, try the "Hoodoo Jo".<br />Glad I can save $$ through Amazon now.

review/summary: A stout cup of coffee! Oh Yeah!
review/text: I like the Kicking Horse brand of coffees and Three Sisters is my usual all-day choice. There comes a time when one needs a bit more power to start the day and 454 Horse Power totally punches the starter! The full body & flavor with low acidity is true. There is no "burnt sox" smell to these beans. Its a dark and rich blend with excellent flavor. I have tried several cans of the Kick Ass Dark with no complaints but no real bonding either. The 454 Horse Power Dark is perfect for when a richer, darker, brew with "wake-up!!" powers is needed! The beans are nicely dark-roasted & fresh. My 454HP is med coarse ground as needed and done in a french press - yes, I want all the oils & flavors possible! It should provide serious espresso too. Normally, I don't use added condiments to my coffee, but 454HP will be fine for those wanting sugar or cream. I've placed 454HP into subscription!

review/text: I ordered this coffee based on all the positive reviews.  I was looking for a robust roast that would work well in a French press, which I started using about a year ago.  I have tried many different sourced beans and blends and grind them coarse in a burr grinder.  I have a few favorites, but I can't always travel to the stores that carry them.  Finding this particular coffee on Amazon was great!  It is the robust but smooth brew I was looking for.  That it is shade grown and fair trade is a major plus, as I will always search those out as a responsible consumer.  I will be ordering this again and again.

review/text: I ordered based on the reviews, and while it is better than the likes of most coffees, I'm not really impressed.  I think I'll try Kick Ass next.  Being this coffee is at the highest roast temp, I assumed it would be very smokey, but I find that the Diedrich French Roast is more smokey and more smooth.  The beans did not seem as dark as I expected them to be.  They look more of a typical dark roast, below a French or Italian roast.  Who knows, maybe I'll like Kick Ass better.  And BTW, Diedrich is much cheaper ($9 for 12 oz).

review/text: I love coffee. For years I've roasted my own green beans (purchased via internet). I used an espresso mix which I liked. Lately, I think the mix has changed, so I started looking around for a replacement. I tried 5 different espresso blends from Sweet Maria's; Starbucks dark espresso roast; and green beans from Whole Foods (where I once had the best espreso ever, but haven't been able to duplicate). This 454 Horse Power is whole bean, dark oily roasted, and powerful. It will cut through any milk or cocoa mix. If you like your lattes creamy and light, don't buy this. If you want something that will kick your taste buds into submission, then this is for you. The tin it comes in is nice.

Hats off to Kicking Horse crew for the quality of this roast.<br />I make this in a standard drip coffee pot in the morning as well as French press when I'm not fumbling around in the morning like a fool. Using a French press definitely wins out in the war of full flavored, but it very much impresses with standard drip.<br />I shared some with co-workers the other day, and I think they understand why I am slowly becoming an idiot coffee snob.

review/summary: Lack of Flavor
review/text: This review has nothing to do with the suppliers, instead it has to do with the product. I didn't enjoy the texture of the outside part of the cake nor was there much difference in the taste between the fillings, an exception was the matcha. I have spent a good portion of my life eating Asian deserts particularly living near Chinatown in New York City. I understand that this is a Japanese assortment, but I believe the fillings lacked flavor, in particular the red bean. I adore red bean, chestnut and taro (taro wasn't included in the assortment but just saying), and so while the product was fresh and delivered on time. The quality wasn't there.

review/text: Earth's Best makes good baby food that my child likes. However, I am rating their product here as it is available through Amazon. I'm very disappointed, like the other reviewer said, about the very short expiration date.<br /><br />A few days before I ordered this, the page said it wasn't in stock and that it would be available Sept. 15th. I ordered on the 15th, and it arrived on the 17th as promised with the free 2-day shipping. My case was supposedly the restocked pears, but the expiration date is Nov 09. New stock shouldn't have an expiration date that is only 2 months away, even if it is on sale! In the grocery store, the expiration date usually is 1 or 2 years away.

Generally I just make this with boiling water.  Their taste is superior than the average grocery store hot cocoa offerings.  These are a real treat and taste like hot cocoa from a coffeehouse.

WRONG. first off, they are not double-stuffed. it just looks like there's more icing than usual because they've made the cookies thinner. secondly, the vanilla cookie part does not taste like the Golden Oreos. it virtually has no flavor at all. thirdly, the texture of the cookie is really weird. it's very hard and crunchy and just plain gross.

Local stores here only carry the major brands: Jose Cuervo, Margaritaville, Mr & Mrs T, etc.  All of those taste like pure sugar and chemicals.  I tasted this on its own and was worried...  But, when mixing with good tequila, it was just right.  I'm very pleased.  Will buy again.  Note that this comes in a bottle, just like other mixers.  I was not clear on that based on the item picture above.  I thought maybe it would be a dry powder mix because the picture only shows the brand sticker.

review/text: This brand of chips has been my favorite since I found them down in Pennsylvania when I used to travel that way.  A few years ago they started to sell them in New England and I was thrilled!  I've been buying them weekly since they made there appearance.<br /><br />But now I found I have entered those years were I have to watch my salt intake and the first thing to go was my beloved chips.  I have been depressed.  UNTIL I found quit by accident via Amazon that Herr's makes a lower salt chip.  And it is delicious.  I have been buying  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052Y7YL2">Lay's Lightly Salted Potato Chips 10 oz</a> and while they are good, they are not GREAT like Herr's.  The Lay's taste and appearance can be inconsistent, you may find overly greasy chips one day and  unsalted ones the next.  And you never find those good slightly browned ones.<br /><br /> Herr's is consistently tasty, has some browner ones mixed in and you may even find some with skin on the edge of the chips. They are truly delicious and to be able to get them from the comfort of my home while still in my PJ's isd a treat.  And these chips are a treat I can't pass up.

review/summary: Not Challenging -- Too Easy for Most Dogs
review/text: Sorry I bought this -- my terrier mix was not challenged in the least.<br /><br />It is a good idea, and I liked that it provides the opportunity for three different games because I thought the variety would be a plus, but all three games are too easy.<br /><br />The basic problem is that for two of the games -- the two where the treat is uncovered by sliding a piece -- the sliding pieces are so easily displaced that they pose no challenge.  The slightest touch makes them slide.<br /><br />The remaining problem is that the third game -- the one in which the covers have to be lifted -- requires the dog to do nothing more than what a dog does naturally:  pick up something with its mouth.  No biggie.<br /><br />I can see how this toy would be valuable to an extremely old, arthritic dog, who would appreciate the minimal effort needed to attain a treat.  Other than that, I think it is a waste of money.  An average dog would be unchallenged and a smart dog would be positively bored.

review/text: The toy is sturdy and well constructed but my Havanese puppy took no time at all to figure out the three games.  Certainly not a brain teaser.  Because there are small pieces the owner must be involved in the game to be sure a puppy doesn't eat them.  My dog much prefers the ball with treats inside that fall out as he noses it around and so do I as it keeps him independently amused for at least 15 minutes.

review/summary: Fun game for dogs
review/text: My 5 month old aussie/border collie mix puppy liked this game a lot. It's pretty durable. You hide the treats in the cups and your pup has to find them. I think the best part about this game is that it is 3 games in 1. Some of the games were easier for him to understand how to play quicker than others. My puppy was able to learn all 3 of the games pretty quickly. The instructions and set up are simple. I wish there were more of the green cups though. One more note i got mine from CVS for 13$ and change...but that was the first time i have seen a dog game sold in mainstream stores so buying online form amazon might be a good option if you dont feel like store hopping to try to find it. Overall i am happy with my purchase and love the idea of playing games with my puppy!

review/summary: Love it
review/text: I don't know why people with larger dogs are complaining its not challenging enough. On their website and YouTube video it states it's intended for small to medium breeds, AND it's for owner and dog to play together, it's not like a kong that's you leave them with it and go out and expect your dog to be busy for hours.<br /><br />I personally loved it and so did my dog. I have a Maltese, and she's really smart so she can get the treats in less than 1 minute, but she still can't get it as fast as a large breed because they have huge snouts and easily knock down the cups.<br />I use the game as a reward, after we come home from training or a walk, I take out the game and she gets excited, and I get down on the floor to play with her. It's just a way of rewarding her and also practicing training, because I have her sit and wait while i put treats in it again, then I tell her "ok" and she goes to get them.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-it's built really steardy<br />-it's easy to clean, way better than the wood ones<br />-it has four little suction cups at the bottom so it doesn't move around<br />-it's 3 different games for basically the price of one!<br />-fast shipping<br />-a great bonding experience and offers the dog something to look forward to after doing training or following commands<br />-it's great for the price<br /><br />Cons:<br />-it's obviously not ment to keep your dog buys by him/her self for a long time, if you want something challenging go for the $40 games. (I don't find it to be a con, but some people will)

review/summary: Kind of Boring
review/text: This was alright. My dog destroyed the tennis balls on the rope in about ten minutes. The frisbee is very fun. The three games are ok, just kind of boring. I guess it could be fun for a puppy or an older dog, but my dog only took about 3 seconds to find the treats.

review/summary: Horrible quality
review/text: The tug-a-war toy and the frisbee disk look like they are nice online, when they arrive they are terribly made. The tennis balls fall apart almost immediately and have a strong toxic smell to them. My dog is only a medium size dog and he had the rubber pulled off of the frisbee disk in a matter of seconds christmas day. We could not give him either toy back in fear of him choking on the pieces that were coming off. The game has held up so far. it is made of plastic and we always supervise him playing with him. We will see how that goes. If you don't mind paying the amount for just the game and throwing away the other two toys than it's not a big deal. I was just disappointed in the quality. There are better brand name games out there for your dog.

Oscar has tried a number of different foods -- all top of the line.  And while he initially seems to like them, his early enthusiasm fades quickly.  We're still giving Halo a chance -- sort of a last effort before adding canned food to the mix, something we desperate want to avoid.  So far, so good.  Certainly worth a try for those starting out and those contemplating a switch.

review/summary: An exotic delight
review/text: I recently went to dinner at a Moroccan restaurant and has the most delicious fruit salad there.  What made the dish so special was the combination of orange blossom water and mint that the fruit pieces were stewed in.  I bought this product to recreate the dish, and love it.  I also put it in a combination of espresso and hot milk, along with cardamom, to make an authentic north African-style coffee and it is far better than anything you can buy in a fancy cafe.  Granted, orange blossom water is and acquired taste, and I would not recommend tasting it by itself.  It is much better served in small portions, mixed with fruits, nuts, coffees, teas, and pastries.  A superb product!

review/text: This green tea has an excellent flavor and is one of four Lipton teas that we keep in our pantry. The taste is flavorful and distinctive and is a favorite for afternoon tea time.<br /><br />We alternate between this green tea, Lipton's black tea, and the Orange Spice tea. My wife is more of a tea connoisseur than I am as I will occasionally defect to coffee, especially in the mornings.<br /><br />By comparison with some other green teas that we have tried in the past, the Lipton Green Tea is much better with a richer taste by far. What is interesting Lipton achieves this without the addition of flavorings.

My daughter, who does not need to eat gluten-free, commented that she likes these better than vanilla wafers for that recipe-they don't get all soggy when the pudding is refrigerated overnight. I had been looking for a gluten free cookie for this banana pudding recipe for awhile and was very pleased with the result.  My husband thought they were great too.  I would have rated these a 5 star, except Amazon did not package them well and every single cookie was broken in shipping.  They refunded my payment promptly when I reported the problem, though.

I miss eating those darned cookies, as much as I know they're not good for me in so many ways.  Well, now they can eat their adorable little hearts out, because I've got THESE!  Sunstart has performed a small miracle, and I'll be forever grateful.  One cookie bar is rich and filling enough to be a perfect dessert, and since there are 12 per box, there are enough to serve when company comes for tea.  These are also pretty enough (and tasty enough!) to serve as a part of an elegant dessert to a dinner table full of guests, too. A case of these will last for awhile, and storage in the freezer works really well - I know, because I tried it!  And the cookies are even good frozen, just like the ones those little angels on the sidewalk are selling!  Go for it, my gluten free friends.  And hey, you know what? Even if you AREN'T gluten free, you will love these, too!!!!

It has lots of packets of flavor including a spicy chili oil and soy sauce and some msg-powdered seasoning and hot chili powder and even dehydrated fried onions as garnish.<br /><br />It is subtly sweet and the spicy-heat just hits you in every bite and the flavors all merge into deliciousness.  This is a flavor unlike any asian bistro cooking, and yet, it's so-oooooooooooo so, so good.<br /><br />I must admit that I have often wanted to find other flavors that were just as tasty and spicy and have only found 1 that is nearly as tasty but it's not a similar sweet-n-hot-savory, it's got heat but it's very different.

review/summary: I really like these; nutty snacks
review/text: Let me start by saying I really like these snacks. I've not tried the salt or cocoa flavors, but the pepper and salt taste very good. Very nutty with just the right amount of black pepper bite. These snacks are derived mostly from wheat and sunflower seeds with some sesame seeds. In addition to the black pepper flavor there is a slight hint of jalapeno and even less of garlic. While these are a great alternative to peanuts, they are not a low fat or low caloric snack. Each piece, or cracker, is about 10 calories and a serving has 10% of your RDA of sodium. Indeed, they taste very salty and suspiciously are difficult to stop eating.<br /><br />If I like Somersaults so much, why just 3 stars? If you look at the ingredients it seems odd that a high sodium snack has salt as its last ingredient. In fact, modified food starch comes before salt. Where is the rest of the sodium coming from? Look closely at the "seasonings." In parentheses the seasonings used in the snack are listed in order of abundance. The very first "seasoning" is "spices" and the second seasoning is "yeast extract." Yeast extract is an analog for MSG (processed free glutamic acid). In short, the sodium is mostly coming from a form of MSG. Please be careful eating these if you are sensitive to MSG.<br /><br />So what do we have here? A tasty snack that contains too much sodium and has a flavor enhancer derived from a form of MSG. I still really really like these snacks and I will continue to buy them, but with so much sodium and the use of yeast extract I can't rate these any higher. Note that this company is not by any means alone is labeling something as "all natural" while using a form of MSG.

review/text: At Cyber Sprocket ([...]), we are always buying and trying new healthy-alternative snacks to offset the pounds of M&Ms, Skittles, Starburst and other assorted sugar bombs we buy every month.  We've tried fruit leather (moderately popular) various trail mixes (fairly popular) and now the Somersaults Salty Pepper Crunchy Nuggets.  That was a couple of weeks ago and the entire batch is gone.  Everyone likes them, myself included.  The one bag I took home for my wife to try was gone in 24 hours.<br /><br />Personally I like things like salt & pepper pistachios better, but they are more work and less filling.  Salt & vinegar Cape Cod chips are also delicious, but push me even closer to looking like Homer Simpson.  These Somersaults are a great alternative.<br /><br />We're going to check out some of the other flavors next.

review/text: I happened upon these snacks in my local Wegman's, and I wasn't sure if they'd be very tasty since they're "healthy." But these are among the best snacks ever!! I bought one bag of salty pepper flavor, and I kept the bag in my car to munch on when stopped at lights. My 3-year-old, who is a snack-a-holic, thinks they're "too spicy," but not me! I haven't tried the other flavors, but I'm so excited to see I can order them on Amazon! I originally bought them up because my daughter is allergic to peanuts, and it's hard to find snacks that don't have peanuts in them or aren't manufactured with peanuts. So when I saw that these have sunflower seeds, I had to give them a try. I also love the texture and size. They are perfect for picking up and don't crumble or create a mess like so many other snacks. The only problem is I can eat too many in one sitting.
