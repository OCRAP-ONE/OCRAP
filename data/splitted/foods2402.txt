review/summary: Bar NONE! The best baked....
review/text: Tortilla chip in existence. If you like popcorn and tortilla chips but are interested in eating healthy,this chip gives you all three! The blue corn version is equally good if not better! If you think the guiltless one's are good,these will leave you speechless. There is NO comparison. The only problem I see is that garden of eatin has a line of about 15 different tortilla chips. The only one's baked are these two. Those that make the decisions what to shelve need to start giving these chips their due. Something so delicious and actually good for you needs the proper availability to succeed. Try these baked chips. If you have taste buds,they'll be happy.

review/summary: Love them, but wish they had a 6 pack instead of a 12.
review/text: I love the salt free blue corn chips. When I lived in Florida I ate salsa/hummus/blue corn chips for lunch pretty much every day. There was so much salt between the salsa and hummus, that I really didn't need it on the chips. When I first started with the salted chips, my mouth would be on fire after a few chips. The salt free was an awesome find, and I love that amazon sold them in bulk so that I could afford them.<br /><br />Only con is because I'm single/live alone, and going through 12 bags of tortilla chips before they expire is a challenge (natural products tend to expire quicker). I ate them after the "best by" date, they just ended up being a little stale. No fault of the product, just my own issue to deal with. Still 5 star product!

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I have always loved these chips and buy them often at the grocery store. Since Amazon offered them at a very good price I purchased a case, However, upon receipt I was disappointed and immediately notified the company (Garden of Eatin). They were not as good as the ones in the grocery store (they seemed to be darker and greasier)and I wondered if they were old. The expiration date indicates they are fine. I do not dislike them, though I love the store ones, and have decided to keep them. Salsa can fix anything. However, I will not purchase them again in bulk from Amazon. My biggest disappointment has been that the company never responded to my email.

review/summary: two small issues
review/text: I have no idea why I ordered these... must have been pretty hungry that day and just needed something to fill the order to get my free shipping.<br /><br />But speaking of shipping, I ordered these "MINI WHITE ROUNDS" and an equivalent order of "TATO SKINS".  The "skins" arrived unbroken while the "rounds" were about half rounds and half crumbles.  I think the difference was that the "skins" people engineered the size of the box just right so the puffy bags held each other in place, while the "rounds" people just threw a dozen bags into the box and only filled it about 3/4 of the way, leaving the bags free to slop around inside.<br /><br />Secondly, just the cursory test, I opened a bag and tasted a few, sort of expecting a "tostitos" or "mission" kind of taste, but they were just a kind of bland corn tortilla taste... which is exactly what they were supposed to be, but ... well you know... expected a taste that would keep me reaching back into the bag until I was ashamed of myself... the "Tato Skins" certainly did!  Maybe they'll be better when I dip them in some quacamole or something.

review/text: A marvelous crunchy treat, acceptable to even the most finicky toddler. Wonderful with salsa and sour cream, hot spinach and artichoke dip, and many more ways. If they used a different fat to cook them (the label currently says safflower and/or canola) they would be perfect. I love that they're free of GMO but I'd be even happier if they contained a healthy fat such as lard or coconut oil, or even olive or sunflower or grapeseed would be an improvement.

review/text: These are great chips!  I also like the red chips.  UNFORTUNATELY, Amazon ships these out in the vendor boxes which are very flimsy.  All of the chips end up broken.<br /><br />It's so funny -- everything else Amazon sends out is in rugged Amazon boxes -- sometimes the item inside is in the vendor box so you get double protection.  The items that should be double boxed (chips) don't get any protection at all and they are the most fragile.

review/summary: A rare low-salt chip
review/text: My wife says that she can taste a mild sweetness from the blue corn -- I cannot.  Honestly they taste like regular corn chips to me.  The difference is that without a thick coating of salt attached, like essentially ever other chip on the market, I _can_ taste what's on top of my chips.<br /><br />Me, I like 'em with nacho cheese.  It's amazing to not have my lips searing from the salt as I eat hot dipping dressings.<br /><br />I wish I didn't have to buy a case at a time to get the good price, but the bags are fairly small, so you'll go through them fast at a party.

review/summary: Garden of FakeLime Detergenty Flavors and other Natural Flavors
review/text: I'm just going to say it: These CHIPS Taste like DETERGENT.<br /><br />Given that Garden of Eatin' blue corn, and red hots chips are my favorite of all time, it's puzzling how they can produce such an unfortunate product as "Chili & Lime".<br /><br />First of all, where's the chili? I don't even taste it. Even tho I'm an advanced chili pepper user, I have a very keen palate. I detect less than 1 part per billion of chili in these here unfortunate chips.<br /><br />Also, I detect fraudulent lime flavors and *that* my friends is an egregious error from such a reknowned company. The red herring that it's NOT natural is "NATURAL FLAVORS WITH LIME". The translation here is that these natural flavors could be really anything, could be any combination of terpene extracts from 'natural sources'. For example, fake lemon flavor in candies and wood detergent is often an extract from lemongrass because it's cheaper than from lemons. But it's a different chemical also. Fake lime is immediately a mistake, and anyone-not just supertasters-can tell.<br /><br />This fakeLime taste, or 'floor detergent flavor', is reminiscent of a childhood fragrance- the strong chemical citrus waft of mopwater that a theater employee was using to mask the rotting popcorn-soda-slurry smell by the dumpster.<br /><br />In other words, it seems as if Garden of Eatin found the cheapest, strongest floor stripping chemicals from Big Lots, extracted the lime scent component and littered it lightly onto these chips.<br /><br />So if you want to mop floor with a tea of these, or you are considering a colon cleanse, accept no substitute.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------<br />Ok so along the lines of constructive criticism:<br /><br />ATTN: Garden of EATIN'<br /><br />Please contact Tostitos sensory labs scientists. It is imperative that you find out how Tostitos makes their hint of lime chips because they got it right. Use at least 500 ppm nanolimeparticles and same same for chili. Coat those suckers with maybe 1/2 to 100% of the rate used for redhotblues.

review/summary: BEST baked chips ever!!
review/text: I had these chips on vacation and could never find them in any of my local stores including Whole Foods.  On a whim, I checked Amazon and was so happy to find that they sold them and they were a pretty good price too.  I was little worried about ordering chips online, the expiration date, shipping and how we were going to get through all of them.<br /><br />No worries!  Only 3 bags left  - my husband and I love them.  The shipping was A+, with double boxes and air bags.  The chip bags are puffed up and you will need clippers or scissors to open it.  I don't mind because I think that's why they are so good and crunchy, not like the Guiltless Gourmet ones that taste like stale cardboard.  We make it to the bottom of the bag with very few crushed chips at all.  The fresh by date was 3 1/2 months from my date of purchase.<br /><br />The best part of all is the taste and nutritional quality of these chips.  One serving has 120 calories with 3 grams fat, 3 grams protein and 3 grams of fiber which for chips is pretty good.  Yes, they are not like blue corn regular chips with twice the fat, but they are the best ones out there that are baked.<br /><br />I will definitely be reordering again!

review/summary: Garden Of Eatin' Blue Corn Chips
review/text: Corn chips, you can't have just one and therein lies the problem. The crunch, the salt, the flavors are so addictive.  Not only are they perfect by themselves but they are a vessel for deliciousness. Whether its guacamole, salsa, refried beans, hummus, you name it.  My favorite these days has to be blue corn chips, they have a deeper almost burnt flavor to them which I can't seem to get enough of.  Garden Of Eatin' blue corn chips are my chips of choice.  They have the crunch, the salt, the flavor, not to mention they are organic and GMO free. I got so excited when they went on sale that I ended up crushing some of the bags as I grabbed them.  I feel bad for the person who got the bag of crumbs, I have to contain myself next time around.

Texture is wonderful, great corn taste.  I brush excess salt off with a paper towel if I just want to snack dip free.  I won't buy again simply because I don't need 12 bags to have to "clean" before eating.  I will try their salt or low salt varieties though as it really is a stellar chip on it's own.

But you folks might want to revisit your packaging.  You know how you grab a bag of chips at the top and pull apart the seam to open?<br />These seams have been sealed with titanium.  And if you eventually manage to pull it apart, of course the rest of the bag is made of the same far too easily ripped all the way down the side to hope to reseal the bag, as every other manufacturer uses today.

review/text: This product is not the 9 ounce bag as advertised but is actually 8.1 ounces.  Apparently rising prices are forcing the manufacturer to put smaller amounts in the bag, but this is foolish since if anyone reads product labels it is the people that buy organic foods.  The manufacturer should wise up and just raise their price to reflect the increase rather than skimp on the bag size. Organic food consumers are willing to pay more for a premium product, but get upset when the company or marketer does not deliver on what they say they are going to deliver on. As for Amazon.com, I can only think that this is an honest mistake and that they did not update their product description. But, for a company that specializes in the latest and greatest computer tech, this is falling short of the mark.  To sum up, this is still a good product, but both the manufacturer and the seller need to get it right.

The "Used By" date is March 2011, but I had to cut this bag open as it was sealed up so tightly (this is the first bag of chips I've had to cut open..if I really reeked on it I could have got it, but I didn't want it to explode in my face).  No worries, you will be happy you got these.

review/text: I have used the tropical flavor for the last 11 years. Yes I realize that the formula has changed. Does it taste the same? Close enough for me. Does it taste awful? No it is not awful whatsoever. Is the same performance in this jug? Yes it is. It still delivers a great performance boost. Now I must say, that I have literally never tried any other flavor at all ever. The tropical tastes just as good to me now as it always has. The choice is yours, but I recommend this product with no reservations.<br />BG

review/summary: It Delivers...
review/text: I'm an avid road cyclist and have been using Cytomax for about the past three years. It does appear to make good on its claims of reduction of perceived exertion and longer sustaining of energy levels. I've sufficiently experimented with other products to be able to determine, for me at least, that the benefits obtained from Cytomax are not a placebo effect.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers who've stated that the salutary effects of Cytomax tend to be especially noticeable during hot weather.<br /><br />The consensus among several of my fellow local riders is that the Tropical Fruit flavor is by far the most palatable, and I have to agree; I personally noted very little difference in taste when the manufacturer began using Stevia as a sweetener. It's light, and never cloying, even when I increase the concentration a bit for very hot days. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Definitely notice a difference when cycling
review/text: I have only used the tropical fruit, but I absolutely love this flavor! I just started using it in the last couple of weeks, so I cannot attest to the old recipe.  However, performance wise, I start drinking a 1/2 scoop per 12 oz of water (according to the company 1 scoop = approx. 3 TBL) a few hours before I'm going to exercise, and keep up the 1/2 scoop regiment probably every hour before I actually exercise. Usually I don't like to drink any fluids while I'm exercising as it upsets my stomach, but I do take a few sips of this drink during the ride, (for the ride, I do 1 1/2 scoops per 16 oz of water) and I feel it definitely helps my performance.  There were times prior to using Cytomax where I felt completely fatigued at the 13th mile of a 15 mile challenging bike ride. But after I started using this stuff, I felt fine at the 13th mile and even felt like I could another 7 miles.  I've had no stomach issues either.  I do 15 mile moderate and challenging bike rides approximately 5 times a week.

review/summary: Works for a competive cyclist
review/text: I typically ride about 5000 miles a year (would do more but live in New England).  I usually do a handful of pro/am races a summer (I fall into the am category!).  I use Cytomax exclusively.  I've tried others - Hammer, Gatorade, Accelerade, etc, but find Cytomax best for me.  It's easy on my stomach and not and provides the needed energy/electrolytes for long rides.  My personal preference is to do 1 1/2 scoops per water bottle rather than the 2 that they reccomend because 2 scoops makes it too sweet for me.  The deal on Amazon is great for the 4.5 lb container too!

review/text: I have used Cytomax for years and it is a great product.  Re-energizes you quickly and helps sustain you for those long runs.  Pomegranate Berry is a little on the sweet side, but all in all it is a great product.  Purchased as a subscribe and save and it is very well priced.<br /><br />The only negative to Cytomax is it doesn't dissolve well in cold water.  So, mix your drink with tap temperature water and refrigerate ahead of time.  I usually prepare mine immediately after my run so it is always ready.

review/summary: Fresh Apple it Isn't
review/text: The CytoSport energy drink is a helpful sports supplement. It does give a noticeable boost to help power through intense hour long cardio classes such as Spinning, Cardio Kickboxing and Zumba. There has been overall improvement in fitness, performance and an ability to increase workout frequency & time from using this supplement. It definitely helps in post workout recovery, little to no muscle soreness. Beats the muscle burn from Spinning and Kickboxing.<br /><br />I have previously used the Pomegranate flavored powder and it tastes more like 1980's Red Kool Aid punch than Pomegranate.<br /><br />The Fresh Apple flavored Cytomax is supposed to be a green apple flavor. Unfortunately, it tastes strongly of plastic with a hint of green apple. I would return it if I could.<br /><br />Also, if you use a sports bottle that holds 24 oz. count on using two scoops of the powder per bottle fill.<br /><br />The Cytomax works better if you drink a small amount 15 minutes before your workout, as directed.

review/text: "New" cytomax formula doesn't taste quite as good as original, but still not bad.  New formula doesn't mix as well, tends to clump and settle on bottom of bottle.  Requires frequent shaking to adequately mix.  Product does seem to work well for hydration, electrolyte replacement, and lactic adic buffering.

review/summary: Live off of this stuff
review/text: First off, Tangy Orange tastes like sh imho. Tropical Fruit hands down. Lived off this stuff for a little over a year now. Tropical Fruit got me through crazy work. Canvassed door-to-door seven to eight hours a day rain or shine, excessantly drank almost every day for a while, worked out and exercised like a monster or beast, and most recently been working as a server for nonstop four to six hour shifts continually active.<br /><br />This is my recover-all cure-all push-on-all. Co-workers always ask me what the hell I'm drinking, sarcastically joke I'm drinking/taking drugs, but most directly, always tell me to slow down. Without this stuff, I wouldn't be able to be the me I really am, high-energy, high-energy spending, high energy to be calm, and high energy to be active. Friend used to tell me about this stuff way back at least 10 years ago, and now I know what he means. If you have any questions leave me a comment below. -Alvin

review/text: I used to drink this stuff when I had triple days (3 practice a day for 11 days straight) in college water polo.  I didn't drink this the first year and despite eating enough and drinking lots of water, I was exhausted.  The following year I drank the Cytomax just as directed I noticed my recovery was much improved as way my overall performance.  I don't compete at the same level anymore, but I still notice the benefits in my daily workouts. The taste is great as well when mixed correctly.  Even if it's a little watered down, it still tastes better than water alone.

review/text: I used Cytomax for about a month and didn't like it.  It gets great reviews from the majority of people that use it & I beleive most of them are cyclists & long-distance runners.  I play hockey, do interval sprinting, & weight training so I thought it would be good for me. I guess it was okay, but I find for my type of training that Gatorade G-2 PRO Series works better.  I do NOT use the pre-workout or the post-workout G-2 PRO Series, I use just the "Perform" which is for during the workouts. I have other supplements that I use for pre & post workout. The Seller, Shipping & Price Get 5 STARS *****.  The product, for me particularly & my experience gets 2 Stars.

review/text: I have been a loyal user of the Cool Citrus flavor for years, but recently tried the Fruit Punch in the new formula. The old formula Cool Citrus always had a bit of a soapy taste, but the flavoring was good, much better than gross Accelerade. I don't notice any soapiness with the new formula Fruit Punch, nor do I find it to have any kind of off-taste, which I normally notice with artificial sweeteners. I have always been a fan of Cytomax due to its lack of sugar in favor or more complex carbohydrates, plus the easy mixing. Many people swear by Accelerade, but the foul taste, pour mixing, and crazy amount of foaming have always turned me off. Looks like I will stay a Cytomax user with the new formula.

review/summary: Absolutely THE best athletic performance drink on the market
review/text: As a family, we started using Cytomax while training for a backpacking trip into the Grand Canyon, back in the Winter/Spring of 2006.  It was recommended to us by the owner of the local high-end bicycle store.<br /><br />The flavor is smooth, and the drink doesn't leave you with that cotton-mouth feeling that even water can produce, especially when it's hot.  I'll warn you up front, this stuff is addicting.  Once your body gets a taste of it, you WILL NOT exersise again without it. In fact, just the smell of the powder while you're mixing it will trigger a pavlovian response that you suddenly have the urge to go do something strenouos, and, you just want a huge drink of Cytomax.  Weird, I know, but true.<br /><br />About the flavors.  We've found the Cool Citrus to be the smoothest, truest, taste.  Sort of a nice lemonade flavor.  To us, all of the other flavors have some sort of a weird before, or after taste.  For example, the Tangy Orange has sort of a powdery thing going on.  The fruit flavors like the punch and the grape have a perfume thing going on.  We haven't tried the apple or the chocolate, and won't.<br /><br />I'll be honest and say that I'm not loving the "Natural" and now I see it's coming with "Stevia" as the sweetner.  Haven't tried the stevia version yet, and really, I'm not interested.  Personally, I don't think the "natural" is as good as the original, definately doesn't taste as good.<br /><br />Now for my "Cytomax Story."<br /><br />In August of 2006 we did our first backpacking trip into the Grand Canyon.  We didn't drink anything but Cytomax.  It was brutally hot down in the gorge, and being first timers, we not only brought a ton of stuff, but we brought a ton of heavy stuff.  We just about got laughed off the shuttle bus because our packs (especially mine) were so stupid huge.  Seriously, picture a Low Alpine 75L pack filled to the brim, to the point that it has to be bear hugged, lifted up onto a rock, and then backed into, in order to put it on! What can I say, we were rookies.<br /><br />The cytomax kept us alive and well, but the real story is that during the hike out, we came across a young couple on the Bright Angel Trail, somewhere below 3mi House.  As is typical for the Bright Angel, they were in tank tops, tennis shoes, no hats, and had come down with a 16oz bottle of water, each.  It was 100*F+, and the girlfriend was broke down on the side of the trail with heat stroke.  The boyfriend was talking about how he was going to run to the top to get her a soda.  She was angrily complaining about what she would and wouldn't drink (one of the signs of heat stroke is lack of good judgement).  I filled her 16 water bottle with Cytomax, and told her she could drink it, or wait for a helicopter.  She decided to drink, and in about 10 minutes her lights came back on.  We gave them both some snacks that we had, saw them one more time at one of the other rest houses, and I think they beat us out to the top!  Seriously, that's how great Cytomax is.<br /><br />We use it year round now, for whatever exersise or sport we are doing, whether individually, or as a family.  It's gone with us to the Grand Canyon, 5 years in a row, including just last week where my 70 year old mom went with us, rim-to-rim in 3 days, fueled by Cool Citrus Cytomax!

review/summary: Works good
review/text: I was looking for an improvement over others I've tried. I liked this better than Gu Brew or the other two I tried (can't remember the name right now) I would say Hammer Heed is a little better than Cytomax imo. Neither Cytomax or Heed left that nasty film in my mouth, but Heed was very light in flavor and texture and no stomach problems at all<br /><br />I thought this size container would last longer. I went through it pretty fast

review/summary: Energy!
review/text: I read a lot of positive reviews about Cytomax being the better version of Gatorade so I decided to try.<br /><br />Boy boy boy, it was GOOD. I use it during workout to keep my stamina up. I feel the difference on the days I do not use it. I could not sustain myself as long as I wanted. By the way, I do Insanity Workout. So that's insanely difficult. With Cytomax, I can definitely keep up with the workout better. Without it, I find myself panting for breath.<br /><br />The good thing about Cytomax is that it is highly refined. When you pour the powder down into your bottle, you can see white powders in the air and you see fizzing in the water immediately. It is so refined. That means it mixes quickly. The only thing that annoys me is that even though it mixes well in general, sometimes you get clumping of it stuck at the bottom of the bottle. That's the only bad thing about Cytomax.<br /><br />The taste is brilliant. I have tried the grape, citrus, and pomegranate with grape being the tastiest one. Eventually, after using Cytomax, I do not want to use any other product. The dosage of Cytomax also decreases as I become stronger and could sustain myself longer without additional aid.<br /><br />Give it a try. You won't regret it. The electrolytes help me to not get cramping because high intensity cardio movements usually wear me down quickly and without replenishing all the sodium, my muscle will get really tired and tense. Cytomax helps with that.

review/text: I started using this product in 1994. Wasn't really sure if it worked until I smoked my friends that I rode with 5 days a week at a MTB time trail. Miss the heydays of MTB races. I use it on long rides by mixing 2 bottles. first one to drink from and second one that is 4X concentrated. beats carrying around a a bag of powder. =When Bottle 1 use empty I fill bottle 1/4 full with x strong mix. Again, I swear by it. Don't train or race wit out it. plus these prices rock! Happy trails and safe roads><br />Justin

review/summary: Good Hydrations
review/text: I've used Cytomax for the past couple of years now and have found it to be the best rehydration product I've used. Everyone is different but this product has by far worked the best for me at keeping myself going on those long or difficult rides, hikes, cross country ski and snowshoe outings. This also helps to prevent cramping and bonking on those hot humid days when your tend to lose more fluids. I've only had the cool citrus flavor as that is the flavor I've used for years with other hydration products as well, and the flavor though a bit sweet for me is more than acceptable. While cycling I always alternate between a bottle of Cytomax and one of water. For other activities where I carry only one bottle I use a little less the recommended amount of powder per X ounces of water. This product like others like it, require a bit more time to mix than the original hydration powders, but it's more than worth the few extra seconds it takes to get it to properly mix.

review/text: Here in Louisiana, we get hot during the summer. I started taking Cytomax about 10 years ago when I was preparing for a 100 mile ride. I trained for months riding longer and longer distances but would deplete my bodies energy. I would just run out of gas and cramp. With Cytomax, I was able to extend my miles without cramping. Because of the expense, I tried many other brands but for my body, Cytomax was the best.

There is not a better product on the market that literally and completely defeats any and all lactic acid buildup in your muscles. I would have paid twice this much too have had this product when I was still bodybuilding and powerlifting. Now my workouts consist of bike riding, Muay Thai, boxing and some light to medium circuit weight training. Cytomax never fails to alleviate the lactic acid build up from any and all of my workouts. I think it tastes great. These whiners are lucky they do not have to drink the swill that us older athletes had to drink back in the 70's & 80's when your only choice was Weider products or making your own shakes at home (which was the best option)

review/summary: New formula fails
review/text: I started using Cytomax back around 2001, and it was the most amazing sports drink I had ever had. Taste, performance, ease of use; it had it all. I read the reviews here discussing a formula change, and went ahead and gave it a shot. I'm halfway through my newest container, and it's just not working. The taste is subtly off, and viscosity/texture of it is subtly off as well. Finally, and I have no way of explaining this at all, I think it actually gives me a light headache when I'm drinking it. Performance-wise, I think it generally still works, in that it provides some calories and hydration for longer workouts. But I don't like drinking it. All said, I will never buy it again. I will test out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054S4HMK">Accelerade Lemon Lime 60 servings</a> and hammer products, etc, and see which one is the best, and go with that. New formula fails.

review/text: This product did not work for me. I live in New Orleans and purchased this product with the intent of increasing my electrolyte intake during/following my Crossfit workouts. We workout in a renovated warehouse w/o AC, so it's hot and I lose TONS of liquid/electrolytes daily.<br /><br />I think that there are a few reasons that this product did not work for me.<br />1) I was using it for Crossfit, not bike riding. The advertisement of this product mainly states that it's for riders.<br />2) I eat about 90% paleo. There is simply way too much sugar in this product for my body. It literally made me exhausted because my body was spending so much energy digesting the sugar.<br /><br />So, I am not sure whether or not this is a good product. I have friends who love it who ride for triathlons and Iron Man events. A few of them use a more natural product called Nun (noon: not sure of the correct spelling), which they say is amazing. All I can tell you is that if you're like me and don't take in a lot of processed sugar...ever... this will send your body out of whack.

review/summary: Tastes great?  Really?
review/text: OK, let's start with the most important aspect of a performance drink - does it do what it advertises to do.  For me, the answer is a resounding YES.  Cytomax does everything the marketing department says it does for beating the burn and fast recovery.  I've been using this stuff off and on since the product came out, first discovering it in a local bike shop.  Once in a while, I tried another brand because of their marketing or the advice of a cyclist/athlete.  Every time, I came back to Cytomax; it's the only one that seems to do the job (for me).  The one disagreement I have with the other reviewers, and this is a matter of personal preferences, is that it does not "taste great".  Not even close to great.  Orange?  Really?  Whatever.  Tangy?  Pffft.  To me, it tastes like a flat diet soda. If that sounds appealing to you, dive in.  I mix it with green tea instead of water, my version of an Arnold Palmer, and it is reasonably presentable to the palate.  Use Luzianne Green Tea and you get the added benefit of antioxidants.  Yep, Amazon has it.  The 1.5lb Cytomax container provides 27 servings, or about 9 rides, so you may need to buy more than one.  Additionally, if you live in a humid locale, like I do, it has a short shelf-life once opened, turning quickly into a big rock.  Buy a size that will get you through a month.  You might pay a little more for three 1.5lb containers, but that's better than throwing away half of a 4.5lb because it soaked up all that moisture and is now useless.  Yep, I've been there.  Grrr.  Get the big bottle if you are an animal, share with others, or live in Colorado.  Where it's dry.  Now go ride!

Mixes well with water, and provides adequae nutrition for endurance workouts.  There is a slightly odd aftertaste that is a bit chalky.  I haven't tried other powdered drinks, so I'm not sure if this is normal for the product type or specific to this product.  Either way, I like the stuff and would purchase again.

review/summary: Wouldn't be my choice
review/text: Definitely too sweet.  Only purchased to get used to drinking during runs as an upcoming race is serving this on the course. I would recommend something "cleaner" with much less sugar to avoid gastric upset.

review/summary: Tastes nasty
review/text: I am a 37 year old male who exercises avidly (6 days a week, both cardio and weight lifting).<br /><br />My review is based on the Tropical Fruit flavor. It tastes nothing like fruit or fruit punch. The only way I could describe this horrible flavor is if you took pink hand soap, diluted it tremendously and then dumped in a bunch of sweetener. That and it has an equally nasty mediciney aftertaste.<br /><br />Now, to be fair, I have not tried any of the other flavors (and I have heard that the Tangy Orange is better). But I do not plan to try them for a few reasons. One, the workers at my local vitamin store said they don't sell much Cyto Max. Two, my experience with the product (flavor aside) was that it didn't hydrate me any better than water, nor did I notice any significant improvement in energy, power, endurance, or recovery. Three, the label makes the dubious claim that it reduces soreness by reducing lactic acid (when science has known for quite some time that lactic acid has nothing whatsoever to do with muscle fatigue). And four, this stuff is 90 calories per serving, and you will likely drink more than one serving per workout. For those trying to burn fat, this means you will be getting your energy from the drink, rather than stored fat.<br /><br />I am still searching for a better tasting and lower calorie sports drink.  Ultima and Accelerade both look promising. But I'm done with Cyto Max.

review/summary: Colored with insect soup! Carmine!
review/text: GREAT just dandy Frickin' Cytomax uses carmine as a color additive. Here's how carmine is made:<br /><br />To prepare carmine, the powdered scale INSECT BODIES are boiled in ammonia or a sodium carbonate solution, the insoluble matter is removed by filtering, and alum is added to the clear salt solution of carminic acid to precipitate the red aluminium salt, called "carmine lake" or "crimson lake."<br /><br />Carmine is insect soup. Yummy!<br /><br />For crying out loud Cytomax. take the danged bugs out of your mix!<br /><br />And AMAZON posts what appears to be a list of ingredients that does not list carmine.<br /><br />Cytomax, most of us are adults and aren't overly concerned with color of our drink. We are not children squawking about the color of our kool-aid being off and refusing to drink it.<br /><br />If I had one complaint about Cytomax, besides the bug soup, it would be the color is ridiculous! Who needs such a fluorescent orange color to drink it! It goes is an opaque bottle anyway...who really looks at it.<br /><br />Cytomax is another company that has over thought the entire deal and basically ruined an other wise great product.<br /><br />Sending mine back.<br /><br />W
