review/summary: Doesn't taste like English Breakfast to me.
review/text: I usually drink Twinnings or Bigelow English Breakfast tea in bags, but I'm trying to switch to loose teas and this was my first attempt at English Breakfast.  The dry tea smells like English Breakfast to me, but once it is brewed it smells and tastes totally different, and I don't like the taste at all.  I followed the directions and I have tried different brewing times (2-5min), adding different amounts of milk and/or sugar.  Other people might like it, but be aware that it may not taste anything like what you expect.

review/summary: Tastes good, high yield, but salt and kernels combined
review/text: I bought this because Great Northern popcorn was out for quite awhile(my usual brand). The price seemed fair so I gave this a try. Initially I was disappointed because when I opened the box the packets didn't have 3 separate chambers like the picture shows, it just had 2...the oil on one and popcorn and salt were combined in the other. I like the separate salt so I can control the amount more precisely. I made a batch and this is what I noticed! The popcorn was a little smaller than what I usually get but the yield was allot better. More of the kernels popped! Any lastly it tasted very good. By the end of the case I should know whether this will be the preferred brand.

review/summary: Red Salt...You'll need it for Kalua Pig
review/text: Honestly, I'd never heard of Red Hawaiian Sea Salt until I was looking for something interesting to make for the Super Bowl, and found the recipe for Kalua Pig (on [...]).<br />The recipe called for three simple ingredients, Liquid Smoke, Hawaiian Sea Salt, and of course some sort of Pork Shoulder roast.<br />Well, who would believe that by slow-cooking this pork with these two simple ingrients added, that I would have one of the best roast porks I've ever had?  The Hawaiian Sea Salt has a really nice color, and distinctive flavor, which is supposedly due to the addition of a Hawaiian red clay, which is mixed into the salt, and I did in fact notice that it has a more interesting flavor than regular sea salt.<br />The jar actually mentions that this salt is particularly good on roasted meats...and it's a nice jar.<br /><br />The only thing I can say that is negative is that it is quite expensive for salt, and some people may not notice enough of a difference in taste between this and regular sea salt.<br /><br />So, if you're on a budget, you may want to try another brand, but I needed mine two days before the Super Bowl, and as such, I had to have it fast, and no other brands were available for fast shipping on such short notice.<br /><br />Quality stuff, but if I had the time, I would have tried a different brand for less money.  Who knows?

review/summary: Contains MSG - very disappointing
review/text: Well, so much for finally getting around to reading the fine print. These Peregrino olives are packed using MSG (monosodium glutamate). I thought that I was getting an exceptional tasting product, only to find that the taste is enhanced using the chemical MSG (to which many persons are sensitive.) The Ybarra Anchovy Stuffed Olive supplied by La Tienda also contains MSG.<br /><br />My opinion is that a superior product should not require artificial flavor enhancement. Unfortunately, the competition (Roland - American Roland Foods) contains MSG. Evidently, the anchovy stuffed product is not tasty enough without the addition of MSG. I can find no other olives at La Tienda or at Roland that contain MSG. So, I guess that my future martinis will no longer be graced with anchovy/MSG olives.

review/summary: Love it but.......
review/text: I really like this tea!  It has great flavor and is really easy to make.  I like it with just a tiny bit of sweetener and a wedge of lemon.  That being said, to get the amount and strength I like for my tea I have to use 2 k-cups for one cup of tea.  I usually do two 6 oz brews and it is just right.  I can go up to an 8 oz brew and still have good flavor but I want more than 8oz at a time.  For me it is just too expensive to use 2 k-cups at a time.  I have compromised with myself and still keep the k-cups around to use if I am in a hurry (or just extra lazy) but I mostly just use the tea bags of the same flavor.  I find it really isn't much more difficult or time consuming to use my keurig machine for hot water to steep a tea bag in.  The tea bags are just much more economical for me.

review/text: I'm a new Keurig user and this is by far my favorite flavor of tea.  I've tried 8 flavors of tea and the Mandarin Orange Spice is the most flavorful.  In addition to drinking it on its own, I pour a "small" cup of the Mandarin Orance Spice mixed with a "small" cup of the Lemon Zinger.  I like mixing flavors, but still my favorite is the Mandarin Orange Spice on its own.

review/text: This is my favorite tea.  I like it because it is caffeine free and I like the taste.  I do add a packet of Splenda.  If you want to make iced tea, my advice is to first brew it in a mug, then add the Splenda, then pour it over ice.  If you brew it directly over ice, then add Splenda, the Splenda doesn't mix as well.<br />I paid $16 for 24 k cups through Amazon.  This is about what I used to pay when I ordered from Keurig, except that I also either had to pay shipping, or order several boxes in order to get free shipping.  The Amazon Prime membership is a great deal.  It is worth the yearly fee, especially at Christmastime.

review/summary: MY NEW FAVORITE DRINK !!!
review/text: I used to be a strictly "morning coffee" person. NOT ANYMORE. Coming from TN/AL, I only drank tea in good 'ole Southern style: ICED and SWEET. But I jumped off the java wagon to try this as I love mandarin oranges and thought it sounded good. Well it's not good...it's WONDERFUL! Some days, I find myself having 2 or 3 cups; a couple in the morning and one at bedtime. The taste is perfectly blended with all 3 flavors equally represented. A bit sweet so some folks might even be able to enjoy it straight up. All-in-all, this is the best K-cup of ANY kind I've had thus far.

review/text: I bought this tea because I absolutely love tangy lemons, and wanted a tasty tea that wouldn't keep me up all night.  Based on other reviews, I knew it would have a strong lemony flavor, but the tea is lacking some tanginess that would probably make it perfect.  Still, it is probably the best lemon tea I have had from a K-cup or tea bag.  Next time I will add some fresh drops of fresh lemon juice.  With the bit of honey I already added, it will be perfect.

Used it in the bread machine and came home to a house that smelled terrible!  Tasted the bread and it had a strange and unpleasant bean flavor and mushy consistency.  I have talked to people who like the bean flavors in GF products, but its not my thing.  Yesterday I made bread with Pamela's Bread mix and it was WONDERFUL!  Tasted like the bread I made pre-GF days.  Will be ordering bulk Pamela's baking mix (AWESOME--made muffins and they were great!) and bread mix on Amazon from now on.

review/text: I've made several loaves of this bread.  It definitely has that "gluten-free" taste and texture - not comparable to wheat bread at all.  It also tends to rise too much during baking and then collapses somewhat during cooling.  This creates an odd shaped slice of bread.  I recently tried Pamela's bread and it is great.  I'm waiting until I've baked a few more loaves of it to give a final verdict, though...

review/text: This is the first loaf of GF bread I've attempted to bake, I followed the instructions to the letter and it was better than expected. I did have a problem with a large air pocket at the center bottom of the loaf, causing an implosion when I removed it from the oven. I think the rise time may have been too long, so I will half it if I make this one again. The taste is good, the texture smooth and elastic, slightly like egg bread. It was moist, not crumbly.  It's a little beany, but if you aren't expecting it to taste like white wheat bread, then it's fine. I wouldn't put jam on it, but I think it would do well for french toast or for a sandwich with hearty robust fillings. I've been eating yummy artisan wheat breads all my life until I was forced to remove gluten from my diet, and in comparison, this wasn't awful. I give it a B-, surely it could improve but it's edible and my picky 8 year old likes it.

I discovered a lifelong undiagnosed Gluten intolerance when I changed my diet to GFCF diet in support of my son.. We are currently Gluten/Wheat, Dairy, Casein, Soy, Corn and Egg free and this mix is a wonderful to have on hand with all of the "from scratch" baking that I have to do. SO great to have a convenient mix..

review/summary: Great texture, bad taste.
review/text: It is interesting to me how many great reviews this product got, as I was not satisfied much.  Granted, this is the first gluten-free bread I have made, so I do not have any gluten-free breads to compare it to, but compared to regular wheat bread it is bizarre, and it taste nothing like the homemade bread I am used to.  I will say the texture is great for being gluten-free - it really holds up well compared to the store bough white bread made from rice flour (which is crumbly and tasteless).  In fact, it its texture is comparable to wheat bread, and the bread is certainly not tasteless.  That being said, the taste, imo, is pretty bad.  It is extraordinarily beany tasting that totally overpowers anything else.  It really tastes like eating a spoonful of garbanzo beans, which is fine, but not for bread!  When I want bread, I want it taste like bread, esp when making a sandwich.  This is terrible sandwich bread, as you will not be able to taste the ingredients adequately.  You'll just taste the bean flour.

review/summary: Absolutely the best AND the easiest!
review/text: This mix saved my life.  After being diagnosed with celiac disease, I tried all the "great" gluten-free bread machine recipes I could find (I am awful at baking bread by hand).  They were all uniformly and unequivocally TERRIBLE.  They were dense, didn't rise properly, caved in at the top or sides, etc etc etc.  They also all tasted very gluten-free.<br /><br />This mix, though is wonderful.  It rises, sticks together very well for a fluffy gluten-free bread (it still has the tendancy to fall apart if not toasted), makes wonderful croutons and stuffing, browns properly and only occasionally caves in a little bit.<br /><br />Things I have learned with this mix that help it a great deal:<br /><br />1. Let the loaf sit in the bread machine for at least 20 minutes after it stops baking. (I have the standard Oster bread machine that was popular when the bread machine rose to popularity.)<br /><br />2. Make it with rice milk.  To me, cow's milk and almond milk taste funny with this recipe.<br /><br />3. Let it cool for a good long while, it is very moist and will fall apart if you try to slice it immediately.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this bread as much as I do!

review/summary: Better options available
review/text: I love many BRM GF products, but this is not one of them.  GF baking is tricky stuff and if you have only tried rice/starch blend mixes, you'll probably love this because it does rise well, isn't gritty like rice mixes, doesn't get "hard" at room temp like rice, and is much spongier.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is still more to want and like in GF bread. First, there is so much bean flour that it's noticeable in the taste.  Seems that some people like this (or don't notice) and others truly detest it.  We're in the detest category.<br /><br />Second, there is actually too much rise in this unless you put it in the oven after a very short rise.  I was making dinner and was about ten minutes late putting it in.  It rose higher than you would think possible, but then collapsed in the middle - not the top, but think of someone sucking in air in their mouth and making that hollowed cheek look.  That makes for a weird shape!!!!<br /><br />Usually, this oddly shaped bread only happens when you either add too much water or when you use a lot of bean flour.  This bread could be so much better with less bean and more sorghum, millet, Montina, amaranth, quinoa, buckwheat, or almond meal.  Probably, with a combination of the above, it would be fabulous.<br /><br />I knew there was this much bean flour when I bought it. I usually make my own and have some delicious recipes.  I try mixes for two reasons: to see if I'm missing anything and to support the companies that go out of their way to make GF products.<br /><br />I've answered my curiosity...I am not missing anything and will not be buying this again.  While too sweet, Pamela's is much better choice if you do not like the beany taste and the odd shape.

review/summary: You'd never guess it wasn't wheat bread
review/text: I've just made my first loaf. This bread has great flavor and texture: nice and spongy, not grainy like rice flour breads. It rose very nicely and didn't fall much during cooling, so you get normal-looking slices for sandwiches. I look forward to adding herbs and seeds to the next loaf. After you grease your loaf pan (if you use the oven method), add a sprinkling of rice flour to bottom and sides of pan. I've found that greasing the pan isn't enough to keep the loaf from sticking, and what a shame to lose part of loaf taking it out of the pan.

review/summary: The bread you can actually enjoy!
review/text: This bread mix really is "homemade wonderful"!!<br /><br />After so many disappointing frozen loaves of gluten free bread, I decided to try to make some at home. I took a chance on this product and I am so glad I did.<br /><br />It doesn't seem like it will work out as you are mixing up ~ it seems like batter bread rather than a traditional yeast bread. Just follow the directions on the package and you won't be let down. Remember to remove the loaf from the pan as soon as it is done or else the bottom of the loaf will get soggy. (cool it on a rack)<br /><br />I found out that this bread doesn't store well for me. It gets stale/moldy very quickly (due to the fact there are no preservatives). I slice up the whole cooled loaf and freeze it, defrosting slices as I need them. Then you can enjoy the whole thing without waste.

review/summary: My son's favorite bread
review/text: My son is gluten intolerant and allergic to eggs, milk, soy and several varieties of nuts. I make this bread with rice milk and replace the egg with flaxseed meal and water, and he loves it! The taste and texture are superior to anything else we've tried. It is very easy in the bread machine, but it can be mixed and baked by hand, too. If I'm not using the machine, I prefer to mix it truly by hand (300 strokes with a sturdy mixing spoon), as the dough tends to climb the beaters of my mixer.

review/summary: This is not bread
review/text: I have made my share of GF bread mixes - and while most share the "cake-like" texture of this mix, they at least don't taste like bean-cake. This mix has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It has the cake-like texture of most GF breads, is almost as sweet as Pamela's bread mix, and tastes like dried, crushed beans.<br /><br />I have made this in the oven and in a Zojirushi Virtuoso, and the result was nearly identical both times. I'm not sure what one could call it, but it is NOT bread.<br /><br />The closest I have come to finding "real" bread in a ready made mix is King Arthur's GF bread mix. Pamela's is a tolerable second, and could rival King Arthur's if it just weren't so incredibly over-sugared. I generally like Bob's products, this however is just terrible.<br /><br />Sidenote: I wish the manufacturer's of these GF mixes would take the time (and $$$) to send a small "research" team to Freiburg, Germany. Once there, visit any family-owned bakery and closely examine all the products therein. Take pictures, notes, samples - whatever it takes. Then make a day trip over the French border into the Alsace region and do the same there for Baguette. And finally make a last excursion to Basel, Switzerland and repeat the above procedures.<br /><br />Document your findings, bring them back home, work on your recipes, and then sell us mixes that produce proper bread (it IS possible, even without wheat and rye). That'd be worth five or six Dollars a box/bag.

review/summary: Good with modifications
review/text: I have made this bread about 10 times so far. I like it well enough, however, I did have some trouble with it at first. It was terribly dry the first couple of times I made it and did not rise all that well on several occassions.<br /><br />I found out that using almond milk was what was causing the rising issue. It appears that the little yeast devils really prefer more sugar. I was out of almond milk and used skim milk instead and the bread rose twice the size and had a much better texture. I will also be trying the almond with a tsp of sugar to see if that alleviates the problem but since I tolerate dairy I may just stick with the skim milk.<br /><br />I use four whole eggs rather than the one whole plus egg whites called for in order to give the bread more moisture and a less crumbly consistency. I whip the heck outta those eggs too. I stick them in by big mixer and let em go for a good 5 minutes. The eggs are whipped up to a pale yellow, light creamy texture.<br /><br />I heat my milk and let the little yeast devils multiply while the eggs are whipping away. Sometimes I let them multiply for 5-10 minutes to really give them a chance to get going.<br /><br />I also use double the oil called for on the package. The loaf was so dry and crumbly the first few times I made it that it was almost inedible and could not be cut without crumbling all over the place before I did this. HUGE difference in texture and moisture now! I was only able to grill it with butter before so while this adds fat it really is better all the way around for me.<br /><br />I use a very long loaf pan to make this as well. It measures 5 inches by 15 inches. It gives a nice long loaf and will fill the pan with a lighter loaf than what you get from a regular loaf pan so long as you leave it to rise a few hours. It also slices great about 20 minutes out of the oven into a good 30-35 slices with this kind of pan.<br /><br />I bag the slices flat and stick them in the fridge until I need them. If you are not going to use all of the bread up within a week, at best, you will want to do the same because it does mold pretty quickly otherwise (5 days on the counter one time).<br /><br />I know there are other mixes out there but they all seem to use rice or corn flours which I can not tolerate so this one works well for me with the modifications above.

review/text: Just made my first loaf of this bread and was so pleased with the results.  I have not eaten bread this good since I went on my gluten-free diet.  Compared to the ready-made bread sold in some stores, it is heavenly!  Making it in a bread machine took very little time and no effort.  It can be sliced thin for sandwich bread or thicker for open-face sandwiches.  It holds together well and just tastes darned good!  I would call it the king of bread mixes for now.

review/text: We got a very serious reaction to this bread.  Anybody else experience problems?  Any idea what we might be reacting to?  The bread was wonderful, in smell, texture, and taste.  I just skipped the egg + egg whites thing and used three eggs, adjusting the other liquid which was trader Joes rice milk.  I wish we could eat this.  It is so good.  People who are having trouble with the final product might try calibrating their ovens temperature, i.e. find out if your oven thermostat runs hot or cold.  Another trick if you have an old oven is to preheat it to 50 degrees more than required, put in your pan, and immediately turn the oven down to the correct temperature.  Anyway, anyone have any idea why this bread makes us violently ill?

review/summary: a bread that works
review/text: This bread has a great flavor. One of the biggest things is the way the dough handles. There are some things that should be noted.<br /><br />The first is to add at at least a tablespoon of rapid rise yeast to it. The packet is fine but it takes a long time to rise. The second is the water. the amount is CRITICAL. Third is the mixing. when the mix gets thick look for the stringers from the ball of dough to the pan. The mixing is done. Spray the mix in the bread pan with a spray canola oil or something. the purpose is to seal the dough so it will rise correctly.<br /><br />I am thinking about cutting the water back slightly and dumping the finished mix onto a large "commercial" type of baking sheet. I want to make a large french loaf.<br /><br />The result is a high rise "commercial" type of loaf. It looks like wheat bread and works like wheat bread. I have been looking for a mix like this for a long time.

review/summary: Cooks up well, but bean flour is hard to digest
review/text: A year ago I swore off of eating  bread for good. I am gluten intolerant and I just thought there was no point in eating GF bread which was, imo, terrible. I could never understand why people were so hooked on their bread that they were willing to eat a far inferior version of it rather than let it go. I have since gotten married and am trying to get my husband to go GF too, since it is a healthier lifestyle. One of the things he doesn't do anymore is buy bread, but sometimes still yearns for it, especially for hamburgers. I caved and bought some of this mix since BRM has been good to me for other things GF and I thought I would give this bread a chance. Boy am I glad I did. My first time baking it and it turned out wonderfully. It is fluffy, soft, with a hard crust on the outside. I let it rise too much and it rose way far above the bread pan, but that didn't seem to do much except give me a nice big loaf. The batter was *very* sticky when I was mixing it up and it all stuck on the blades, but once I got it off the blades and into the pan, it turned out very nicely. I did add slightly less butter than was called for (simply because hubby spilled a little accidentally). Maybe the less moisture helped the bread to stay together without caving? Who knows. All I know is that it worked.<br /><br />Of course, since the batter heavily leans towards bean flour, there is a slight taste difference than regular bread, but imo, that makes it even better. I am glad to have my other packages of this on hand. I won't make it all the time since even gluten-free carbohydrates are still bad in excess. But as a treat or when my husband plans to have hamburgers, it will be the first place I'll look for good GF bread.<br /><br />*edit July 12, 2012* After eating this a few times, I found that the high amount of bean flour contained within makes it hard for me to digest, with unpleasant side effects. It's really too bad as the bread itself bakes up beautifully and tastes good. However, the bean flour is just too hard on my digestive tract, so I probably won't be buying this anymore, once I use up what I have. Unfortunately I had to mark down my review from 5 stars to 3 because of this.

This is the only gluten free bread we've had that actually makes a good sandwich.  We feel good about eating it too, because it's healthy.  There are 3 grams of fiber in each slice and it's animal product free as well, because we make it with egg replacer.  It does not get hard when it cools off like rice based breads.  It's soft and chewy with a fantastic brown crust. I know some people complain about the garbanzo bean smell.  We don't notice that, but maybe it's because we really like chick peas.  Anyway, I'm so thankful we found this bread mix.  :)
