My dogs normally do not go for any kind of treats (I guess they just dont like them) but they sure love these!<br /><br />I recommend these to everyone that has a dog, it just shows them one more way how much you care about them! :)

review/summary: Smokey Treats
review/text: Perhaps a bit too much liquid smoke and corn syrup, these treats are about 1/2" x 1" and come about 40 in each 4oz bag.<br />"Made in the USA without any by-products. Wheat Gluten, artificial flavors or colors."<br />The dogs love them and with 25% protein and 10% fat you can feel good about giving them. The highly scented smoke aroma really gets their attention so no worries about them forgetting you have something before they finish the task. You will surely be able to use these to reward good behavior if you can keep your pet from switching into a feeding frenzy.

review/summary: Great Treats for your Googie!
review/text: I received Bit-O-Luv today and decided to use it as a training treat for my puppy Jager.  The pieces are a soft jerky type in nice little rectangular pieces that can be used as training treats.  My Jager liked the Bit-O-Luvs, they are not smelly and look very much like jerky.  I gave Jager half a rectangle to see how they taste, he definitely like the taste since he was happy and jumped up for the rest of the treat.

review/summary: Nice dog treat that was enjoyed by all three of our four-legged pals
review/text: Not bad!  All of the dogs in our house enjoyed the treats.  Most dogs aren't used to beef treats if they're used to milkbones, etc. so be sure to gradually introduce these into their diet if you haven't used these kind of treats before.  In regards to the price, if you are buying a pack of 6, then they are pretty decent especially if you get a good deal on the shipping charges from Amazon.  Oh, most people will probably think they taste alright too, I checked.

review/text: Man--this stuff smells good enough to eat, and from the package, it probably is. My dog snarfed them right down--no surprise there--my Weimaraner eats sticks and stones and egg shells, so this was gourmet fare regardless!<br /><br />The problem arose when she wouldn't bug off the whole rest of the evening. She really really likes these. Really. Bird dogs don't give up easily. I'm going to take them along on the next walk in the woods for those times when she disappears after deer and I wonder what breed my next dog will be. I'm sure I'll have no trouble getting her to come back with these in my pocket--if I can resist eating them myself!

review/summary: Command you dogs attention with these treats!
review/text: So, I opened my bag while my two labs were eating their dinner...i.e. they didn't see me.  However, they smelled them as soon as they got near me and boy were they ready to try them!  These treats are probably best suited for training treats as they're small and can easily be broken into smaller bits without crumbling.  That's really nice.  You can feel pretty good about them as they're fairly healthy.  However, the bag says I can give my two large dogs several treats a day, and that's just not gonna happen at this price.  If you have a small dog the bag will go a lot further for you.

review/summary: Miss Cookie approves.
review/text: What can I say? These treats smell good, even to the human handing them out, they're soft and meaty and apparently taste good. Having not tasted them myself I shall have to rely upon Cookie's opinion, which is very favorable. She appears to wish that these treats were much bigger, and came with a very distracted human who might possibly set the open bag down and wander off. With all due respect to my sweet Cookie, she's very easy to please in the treat department, but I can't imagine any doggie not liking these nummies. Actually, the cat likes them, too, to Cookie's dismay. Cookie and I think your best buddy needs these treats, too!

review/summary: Doggone Good
review/text: The bag contains 4oz of treats - my bag had 38 treats that measured about 0.5 by 1.5 inches. They smell like beef jerky but feel a little moister. The first two ingredients are beef and chicken which is good, but two out of the next three ingredients are sugars. Still, they're certainly better than a lot of treats out there - the ingredients list is fairly short and pronounceable.<br /><br />I think these would make good training treats - they're easy to tear into smaller tidbits. My greyhounds were very attentive when I opened the package and gobbled down the offered treats in short order.<br /><br />The price is comparable to some of the higher end soft jerky-style treats I've bought before. Made in the USA and inspected beef is a nice touch, especially with the concerns about imports these days.

review/text: As soon as I opened the package and my German Shepherd got a whiff of the treats (which are very aromatic) he was sitting eagerly to receive a treat. The treats are a nice size and shape - about 1/2 the size of a stick of gum. They have a pepperoni type smell. Wheat Gluten free, and made from natural ingredients.

review/text: Ok, not that I really ate these fabulous litte treats!! However, if you love beef jerky products, you may want to nibble one when you smell the contents of the bag! The first two ingredients listed are beef and chicken, a great sign for good protein content. The bag is easily resealable as well. The size of the treats are perfect for a medium sized dog. Softer than a true "Jerky", your dog will gobble these goodies down. I think if my doggie could talk he'd say "more please"!

review/summary: Not great for the big dogs
review/text: I rarely ever review products here on Amazon, and this product I'm not sure how to rate.  My dog (Ralph) did eat these treats and seemed to enjoy them, but I'm not sure just how discerning are his tastes.  On the other hand if you are reading my review for a dog treat then I imagine that means that you are (as am I) what normal people would call one of those "dog people".  We may be a little eccentric, but we just want what's best for our fury little companions, and this treat seems to be just that.  With natural ingredients this makes for a healthy treat for any dog.<br /><br />My only problem with this treat is that with a 70 pound Sheepdog this little bag does not go far at all.  These snacks were made for a smaller breed because if you are like me and like your medium to large breeds then you would spend a fortune keeping these little treats around.  So, if you have a 30 pound dog or less then these will be great, but for dogs much larger you may want to keep looking.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I love the packaging; it's playful and hip. I hope the product meets my expectations--and by "my" I mean my dog's. He's a Rottweiler and not particularly picky, but you never know. I read the ingredients and nothing alarming stands out. I open the bag and the smell is fantastic. Like beef jerky, but smokier. My dog starts to salivate as he watches me. I pull out a treat and examine it. It looks like processed beef jerky, about 1/2 by 1 inch each, with a firm texture.<br /><br />I think about it for a second, and then I go for it: I nibble a piece off the end. The flavor is not as strong as I'd expected--it's not as salty as real jerky. But it tastes perfectly natural so I go ahead and finish the treat, taking just a second to wonder whether I should even give these to my dog. But that would be just TOO weird, right?<br /><br />I give one to my dog, and he wolfs it down. I give him another, then another. To be honest, he doesn't seem much more impressed than usual. But you know what? I am.<br /><br />The verdict: I love them, and I will buy them again. You know, for my dog.<br /><br />Update (the next day): He must have liked them, because today he was VERY excited to get more.

review/summary: Zoey sez: "YUM!" ... Mom sez: "Er, there's corn syrup in these..."
review/text: Made in the USA, no by-products, no wheat gluten, no artificial flavors or colors.  The company is based in Albany, Oregon, a couple hours drive from where I live, and a portion of their proceeds goes to help pets in need.<br /><br />Obviously, my sheltie, Zoey, loves these treats.  They smell and look just like beef jerky made for humans... even I thought they smelled mouth-watering.  These Bit-O-Luv beef treats are a far better treat for your dog than most of the dog treat offerings in the grocery store.<br /><br />The only downside is in the ingredient list - my dog would've loved them just as much if they didn't have added sugar (dextrose and corn syrup).  She's fed a half kibble, half raw food diet, so she gets a lot of broccoli, cauliflower, green beans... low sugar, low calorie veggies, as a way to help her lose/maintain weight.  Even with exercise, it's easy for her to gain weight and hard for her to lose weight, so I'm lucky she looks at these veggies as yummy treats.  She's picky, and she will snub treats/foods.  I don't want her to get conditioned to sweet 'n' salty snacks (like I am!!) and start to look at her veggies as bland (like I do!!).<br /><br />So, these will be given sparingly to Zoey, couple times a week.  I think the salt is low enough on the ingredient list, but the dextrose and corn syrup seem to come too closely behind the beef and chicken.  My go-to treat for Zoey, given daily for all the little good things she does, will continue to be Zuke's Mini Naturals.  She loves the Zuke's Minis in all flavors, and there's no sweeteners.<br /><br />As a yummy treat only given once in a while, it's fine enough that I wouldn't knock a star off my rating.  Also, people with healthy, lean dogs who never gain an ounce won't mind if there's sweeteners.  In any case, in terms of quality, these Bit-O-Luv treats are still amongst the best, in my opinion.<br /><br />**From the package**<br /><br />"Ingredients:  Beef, chicken, dextrose, water, corn syrup, soy protein isolate, natural smoke flavor, salt, potassium sorbate (preservative), paprika oleoresin, and sodium nitrite (preservative).<br /><br />A percentage of our proceeds go to help four legged friends at local charities."

review/summary: The dogs gobbled them up
review/text: At the time of this review, Amazon offers a multibag pack that comes out to a bit under $5 per bag.  If you have a smaller dog and you use the treats as just that (limiting the number they get a day) it seems like that's not a bad deal to me.<br /><br />The short version of this review is that the treats look and smell like beef jerky and your dogs will gobble them up.  The ingredients appear to be of above average quality though there are some sweeteners and preservatives that might make some raw (pet) food diet fans look a bit askance or might not be good for pets with certain health issues such as diabetes. (Talk to your vet about it.)  Ultimately, the treats appear to be just fine for a reasonably healthy animal even if they're on a raw food diet.<br /><br />The Long Version:<br />I tried the treats out with three different animals all of whom are on raw or partially raw diets.  Two very different breeds of dog and a cat.  (Yes, I know they're dog treats but I didn't see anything on the list that made me think it would be bad for cats.)  The cat sniffed at it and walked away, coming back later and eating it when he thought I wasn't looking.  (Typical for a cat.)  He didn't get sick and he didn't smell bad later.<br /><br />The two dogs were an English Bull Mastiff and a Pomeranian.  For those not familiar with the breads we're talking about a dog the size of a person and a dog the size of a bread box.  The Mastiff was very excited about whatever was in the bag as soon as it was opened.  Ultimately, one treat (or two) isn't even barely a mouthful for this breed.  And while she really seemed to enjoy them, you would go through the bag much faster with such a large dog.<br /><br />The Pomeranian also gobbled up the treat, and with a smaller dog you could probably make the bags last longer.<br /><br />The Ingredient list is as follows:<br />Beef, chicken, dextrose, water, corn syrup, soy protein isolate, natural smoke flavor, salt, potassium sorbate (preservative), paprika oleoresin, and sodium nitrite (preservative).<br /><br />The higher up an ingredient is on the list the more of that item there is in a serving.  Dextrose seems like a strange thing to have in there but what little I've discovered in researching it says that it's easily broken down and used as energy by the body.  The down side is that if you have an older pet who is diabetic, this is NOT the treat for your pet.<br /><br />The other possible downside is that the treats are essentially identical to beef jerky.  So if you yourself are inclined to eat jerky, your pets might confuse your treats with theirs and become bothersome when you're trying to have a snack.

review/summary: 3 dog review - they scarfed it down, owner has reservations
review/text: "Sit, stay..."  Three pairs of eyes look up.<br /><br />I sniff the bag - the smoke scent is overpowering.  My test subjects anxiously await the treats and are more than willing to contribute to this review.  Two black labs and one miniature dachshund all give these treats their unqualified seal of approval.  BUT, they can't read the ingredient list...and I can.<br /><br />The front package labeling claims "bistro beef recipe dog treats", and the back label reads "...bit-o-luv dog treats are made in the USA without any by-products, wheat gluten, artificial flavors or colors.  We even have our beef and chicken inspected by the USDA..."<br /><br />Sounds good, until you read the ingredient list: "beef, chicken, dextrose, water, corn syrup, soy protein isolate, natural smoke flavor, salt, potassium sorbate (preservative), paprika oleoresin and sodium nitrite (preservative)"<br /><br />I think I'll skip feeding my dogs GMO soy and nitrites...and go back to making them homemade treats.

review/summary: They smell good enough (for me) to eat!
review/text: These look and smell like beef jerky. But! They have sugar and corn syrup in them. They also have nitrites = preservatives. Why would I want to feed those to my dog? Did she LOVE them anyway? Yes. Most definitely.<br /><br />My Jack Russel is blind from diabetes. (It doesn't slow her down.) So for real - we did a blind taste test on 3 different days (and I monitored her glucose levels).<br /><br />I placed an assortment of treats on a clean paper plate using a spoon (so my scent would not affect the outcome): Bit-o-luv, Alpo LivaSnaps, a small Milkbone biscuit, a Milkbone marrow bone treat, a liver-flavored vitamin <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BXZ6Z0">Vetri-Science Canine Plus Multi-Vitamin</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009RSOVG">Joint Treats</a>�. She went for the Bit-o-Luv first -- except once. On the third day, she picked up natural, rawhide "straw" and dropped it - the Bit-o-Luv was first to go again.<br /><br />The Bit-o-Luv smell like the best bacon you ever smelled! But because of the sugar and the nitrites, I would not give these to her more than 2-3 times a week.<br /><br />Her vet-recommended treat is the Alpo Livasnaps. Comparing labels:<br /><br />Bit-o-luv --- LivaSnaps<br /><br />Protein max 25% --- Protein max 18%<br />Fat min 10% --- Fat max 4%<br />Fiber max 1% --- Fiber max 3.5%<br />Moisture max 30% --- Moisture max 12%<br /><br />With more fiber and less fat, I think LivaSnaps would be a good choice for an older or inactive dog.

review/text: Well, first I would have to say that I did not personally taste these treats.  Not that I wouldn't have been willing but as a vegetarian they just didn't appeal.  Next, my dogs are not fussy so will eat anything.  What would have surprised me is if they hadn't eaten them.  With all that said, the ingredient list shows high quality ingredients and that is important to me - high quality ingredients lead to good health which means fewer vet visits.  These treats look like soft little beef jerky rectangles, about an inch long, 3/4 inch wide, and very thin - really best suited to little dogs.  My dogs are large dogs and they go down so fast I wonder if they even taste them.  But they must, because they are effective dog trainers - carry a few of these in my pocket when walking the dogs and they will sit, stay and come with alacrity to get their treat.

review/summary: Good but not as good as peanut butter biscuits
review/text: What I loved about this product:<br /><br />--All natural and high quality ingredients, gluten free and nothing artificial<br /><br />--Nice package size to carry on trips to the dog park or even out of town<br /><br />--Nice treat size--about the size of a return address label, a little longer than a postage stamp. Just large enough for our dog to be forced to chew at least once, but not a huge sized piece that's too large a portion.<br /><br />I tested this with other treats our dog loves. This will vary from dog to dog, but here's the results:<br /><br />We tested each treat 5-7 times against this treat. We put our dog in a down stay, put the two treats a few feet away from her, and released her. We recorded which treat she ate first for the majority of the 5-7 times we repeated the exercise.<br /><br />She liked the treats over her dog food. No surprise there.<br /><br />However, she liked her peanut butter biscuits over these beef treats.<br /><br />She also preferred hot dogs and chicken over these treats (we weren't surprised at that, either).<br /><br />While these treats are a bit easier to carry than her peanut butter biscuits, which are larger, and a lot easier than carrying perishable (and slightly oily) hot dogs and chicken, we are more likely to use peanut butter biscuits, hot dogs, or chicken when doing training with her because she's more likely to obey and learn if her reward is something she really likes. For example, her recall training is much better with chicken than hot dogs because she likes the chicken better.<br /><br />So, we have to say that these treats don't quite work for our dog. They might work great with other dogs, and they're a very convenient size and package, but we need treats our dog will really love, and while she eats these, they aren't her favorite.

review/summary: My pooch isn't excited about these
review/text: My dog isn't overly picky about treats, but she won't eat anything put in front of her.  There are some treats that I buy that she just can't wait for the next one to come out of the bag.  These don't fall into that category.  She eventually ate a couple, but it took a little while for her to do it, and she didn't seem very excited about these treats at all.  If these were a health food, I'd give them at least three stars because she will eat them - but as a treat, I'm giving them two stars because she doesn't seem to like them.  I figure that a treat should be, well, a treat - and she should be excited to get them.<br /><br />This might be a great product, but my only experience with it is through my dog, and she seemed indifferent at best.

They would be great for dogs 15 lbs and under, but for my 55, 65, 80, and 85 lbs puppies, they were a tease and gone in two sittings. They swallowed them whole. For one or two small dogs, the pack could last several days, depending on how much you spoil your babies. :o)<br /><br />Overall impression: great product that dogs love but costs a lot. I only wish they made these in big-dog size. They are too small for me to buy for my pups.

review/summary: Tasty, All-Natural Treats Dogs Love
review/text: My dogs love these treats! They are pugs, so they go crazy for anything that is food or could be construed as food, but they went especially nuts for these.<br /><br />The treats are small, half-inch to inch-long beef jerky pieces. The smell is high-quality and appetizing to dogs, and the pieces are slightly juicy and moist, but not messy. I didn't have to break them up for my pugs, but they did have to chew slightly. For smaller dogs, they could be good to chew on, and they might be good training treats for large dogs.<br /><br />I also really liked that the treats are all-natural and are made in the U.S. I try to feed my dogs natural food and treats, especially after the food recall scare a while ago, and this was a definite plus. The treats are also gluten-free, and I loved that they said that a portion of their proceeds to go animals in need!<br /><br />The package doesn't say that they are organic or made from cruelty-free beef, and those are the only things that I think would make them better.<br /><br />I think any dog would be grateful to receive these to enjoy!

review/summary: Bit-o-Luv is a resounding hit with my canine friends
review/text: First of all, I no longer own a dog. However, I have a very eager pack of dog friends who expect that I pay them my respects in the form of treats as I ride my electric scooter around the retirement community we live in.<br /><br />To satisfy this following I have tried at least half-a-dozen different dog treats. Beggin Strips was by far the favorite until Bit-o-Luv came to me via the vine system.<br /><br />Mitzie was a bit put off when she noticed that something other than the Beggin Strip was coming out of the package. She turned away and seemed to do a bit of pouting, and really let me know that I had diminished greatly in her estimation. But, she relented and took the offering and since then I can do no wrong with Mitzie.<br /><br />Siggie wasn't nearly so hard to sell, but I fear he will be very disapointed if I don't get an abundant supply of Bit-o-Luv very soon.<br /><br />Foo Foo, who rides majestically in a basket behind her master's bicycle seat, didn't hesitate a bit. She recognizes a good thing when she sees or smells it.<br /><br />Red Ruffus was the most circumspect of the lot, but has become a dedicated Bit-o-Luv follower.<br /><br />Rusty makes a great fuss if he doesn't recieve all three of his Luv bits quite as soon as he expects them.<br /><br />There are others that I am not yet on a first-name basis with who have now decided that the old coot on his red run-about is a person who rates consideration.<br /><br />Indeed, Bit-o-Luv has elevated me to a position of unexpected popularity, and has put me in a position I dare not retreat from. My order for a case of this stuff will follow as soon as I find where Amazon has it listed,<br />,

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HN5Z4K">Bit-O-Luv Bistro Beef Recipe Dog Treats, 4.0-Ounce Pouch (Pack of 6)</a> gets 4 paws at my house! Actually 12...I have three dogs who all just loved this product.<br /><br />Made in Albany, Oregon without artificial colors, flavors, wheat gluten or by-products, upon opening the bag I was tempted to try them myself as it smells just like the beef jerky I eat! It does have sugar in the form of corn syrup. Soy protien, sobate (a preservative), salt, and sodium nitrate (a preservative) are also in the product, but certainly meat is the main ingredient in these tasty smelling dog treats.<br /><br />For a dog under 10 pounds it is recommended that you only give them 1/4 to 1 piece a day. The 4 ounce bag looks to have approximately 30, 1.5" long pieces in it.  They will want more! My dogs loved there first taste and sat at my heals begging and looking from me, back to the Bit-O-Luv bag over and over again. They said it was M UCH nicer than those Milk Bones!

review/summary: an odor that lingers on your fingers
review/text: The first thing I noticed about the Bit o Luv dog treats was the smokey meat smell.  It was also the last thing I noticed, as the smokey smell stuck to my fingers until I washed it off.<br /><br />The treats are flexible rectangles that look like beef jerky - about 3/4" wide and 1.5" long.  My dog loved them and showed off his best manners as he waited hopefully for an extra treat, so they must taste pretty good.  If you are working out cost per dog treat, my 4 oz bag had 37 treats inside.  As a premium dog treat, this seems to be about an average cost, but we'll probably stick with a cookie/biscuit type of treat around here because of the odor, cost, and "kong-ability," but might buy these occasionally as a special treat.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* flavor really appealed to my dog<br />* feels/appears/smells to be a premium/special dog treat<br /><br />Cons:<br />* odor<br />* can't hide a pill in these - not "smushable"<br />* flexible, so it doesn't work in a kong, and probably not in a planet pet or other dog toys that dispense treats

review/summary: "Raising the bar"??  Really?
review/text: This company advertises this as a healthy product that's good for your dog.  A quick look at the ingredients says otherwise.  True, there is no wheat gluten but there are two different types of sugars, dextrose and corn syrup listed in the top ingredients.  There is also soy protein isolate, a dubious ingredient in a food or treat for dogs, IMO.  Leaving out one bad ingredient while adding in three more isn't exactly brag-worthy!!<br /><br />On the plus side my raw fed, extremely picky dog loved this food!  This is a dog who will literally spit something out she doesn't like but she gobbled up as many as I would give her.  The fact that she will eat this treat made me give it three stars instead of two, but lets be real, this is still junk food for dogs!!  OK in moderation but it doesn't live up to the nutritional hype by the manufacturers.

review/summary: Healthier for your four-legged friend!
review/text: I started feeding my dog a healthier diet without meat by-products, wheat, and artificial colors and flavors several years ago and was rewarded with a happier, healthier dog. I had not come across BitOLuv products before but was glad to try one to see how she liked it. We tried Bistro Beef treats, and once I smelled them I guessed that she wouldn't be interested in them. She had never liked spicy, pepperoni-ish treats before, and this one seemed similar. It has a smoky, slightly spicy smell.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong! She was very excited by them and enjoyed them very much. They are very moist and tender, not tough like run-of-the-mill snacks. They make my dog very happy.

review/summary: Dogs love 'em (at least mine did)
review/text: Originally I wanted to do a video review for the Bit-O-Luv treats that showcased the tests that I did with my dogs, but alas it was not to be as my daughter proceeded to disperse them all before I could get to it...lucky dogs.<br /><br />Having said that, here's what I have: Border Collie, Japanese Chin and a Miniature Datsun/Terrier mix.<br /><br />All of my dogs loved the treats; in this case the Bistro Beef Recipe. Personally though I believe all dogs will enjoy anything out of the ordinary and eat it eagerly too, so I decided to do a test.<br /><br />I took three different treats (names omitted to protect the innocent...lol) and then lined them up in a row, spaced apart about two feet. I then let the dogs free to see which one they'd run to first. I did this three times. Each time the dogs ran to the Bistro treat first, however, they didn't run to the other treats after as I'd expected them to, instead they came to me looking for more -- well, that's what I assume anyways, I'm far from a Dog Whisperer.<br /><br />All in all, the treats were good and the dogs enjoyed them and at roughly about four-dollars a piece through Amazon, they're comparable in price to your local store.

review/summary: Interesting
review/text: These treats got an good reaction from the 9yr old Australian Cattle Dog I gave them to. She seemed very into the way they smelled as she immediately came running as soon as she smelled them, and she eagerly gobbled them up when offered as a reward for training. She however wasn't as tempted by them as some things as she was not as eager to come to them as some other treats when we needed to distract her from chewing on something she shouldn't have been chewing on. Whether this was because they did not taste as good to her or she just wasn't used to them I don't know, and she is pleading the 5th.<br /><br />I don't usually feed her homemade treats or anything so I wasn't too concerned with the ingredients list (as some other reviewers have mentioned), as it seemed to be better than most store bought treats, but the spices seemed weird to me, and I don't know if that was a drawback for my dog. Overall though, I would say they are pretty good, and would be good to use for training (The smell sure gets their attention!).

review/summary: Bit-O-Luv? Bit-O-Wonder say the dogs
review/text: Now, admittedly, my dog would eat uranium waste liberally doused in used motor oil, so how can I judge (or my dog more accurately) the quality of these dog treats? The blind taste-test was the method o' choice. Three bowls - once containing Bit-O-Luv dog treats, one containing his usual Brand-X, and the final bowl containing left-over vegetarian chili (don't ask). Since he's a bit short sighted anyway I dispensed with the blindfold (he'd only pull it off and chew it to death) and let him loose. Like a laser guided smart bomb he immediately took off outside to relieve himself and bark at the trash can. Following that brief sojourn, he sniffed all three bowls and settled down to consume, yes, you guessed it, the Bit-O-Luv Bistro Beef Dog Treats. (Swiftly followed by Brand-X the Chili and the innards of a stuffed toy that he'd been working on liberating for the past few days). So the results are in. Bit-O-Luv Dog Treats are loved more by one dog out of, well, one...

review/summary: Just the right size for my little guy & almost natural
review/text: I have a little Boston Terrier mix (rescue) who is a more like a CHOW HOUND than a terrier! We walk 5-7 miles a day and my spoiled monster (gotta love him, he's SO cute!) likes to get a treat every 20 minutes or so on a walk (he'd LOVE to get one every minute, but it's not always a dog's life, hehe).<br /><br />When I give him these jerky treats, I tear them into little bits, so he really only gets 1 per trip (he hasn't learned to count or weigh out food yet, lol!).<br /><br />The dog is 6 1/2 now & is of course perfect weight and health due to all that exercise (hasn't hurt me a bit, either).<br /><br />I only feed him natural foods & treats, he's on a holistic, though not raw, diet. If I had the time & storage space, I would feed him what I fed my previous dogs, chicken, broth and brown rice made at home. My 90 pound Weimaraner lived to be 14 1/2 on that diet.<br /><br />I am a major fan of Cesar Millan and after reading Member of the Family I will NEVER feed anything with 'meat byproducts' to my dog again (read it, by law in 20 states it's LEGAL to include euthanized DOGS in dogfood as a meat byproduct (gag!!!)).<br /><br />As another reviewer stated, yes, there is dextrose in the treats, but my dog isn't diabetic and isn't overweight, so I have no problem with it.<br /><br />Is it identical to beef jerky? Probably. I know that I don't eat as healthily as my dog does, though I try.<br /><br />Does my dog bother me when *I* eat beef jerky because I've given him these treats? Nope. Why? Because I never feed my dog from 'my' food, so he doesn't beg at all, ever. That's just a matter of proper training..dogs don't beg from 'the pack leaders'. Although we regularly invite the dog onto the bed, he never even looks at our food if we are snacking in bed.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the treats. Of course, he adores them. I don't know that I would pay this much for them, I also give him Chicken Chips made by another company that cost $9.99 for a huge bag. The ingredients in that one? Chicken. Period. They also make Banana Chicken and Duck Sweet Potato, etc...with no preservatives at all.<br /><br />I got one bag free (thanks Amazon) and I still have most of it because I only give him 1 or 2 max per day. I might buy them again, haven't checked the price for them in Petsmart yet..though I suspect that Amazon is probably a bit cheaper.<br /><br />Be sure to limit treats for any dog who is not regularly exercised. The vast majority of pet owners do not exercise their dogs anywhere near enough (and no, throwing the ball around the yard doesn't count).<br /><br />I would have given 5 stars if there had not been any preservatives in them and if they were a little less expensive.

review/text: To keep this short, I'll present it as a two-part review:<br />My two fox terriers vote 5 stars for taste.  They absolutely love the idea of having their own jerky treats, instead of needing to beg little pieces of my beef jerky from me.<br /><br />The other part of the review is from me.  I'd give it 4 stars, because I think the price is a bit steep.  At close to $4.00 per 4 ounce bag it's nearly as expensive as beef jerky I buy for myself.  But the ingredients minimize fillers and preservatives, and the treats come in small enough pieces that Bit O Luv is really not as expensive as it looks at first.<br />OK, I'll make that 5 stars from me too.

review/summary: The pugs approve!
review/text: Given what has happened in the recent past with dog food, even "premium" dog food that turned out to be toxic, I have become increasingly wary of giving my pugs mass-produced treats or kibble. Bit-O-Luv Dog Treats are an exception to the generally awful grade of dog food products available for purchase by pet "parents." These treats are made in the USA of generally high quality ingredients:<br /><br />USDA inspected beef, chicken, dextrose (sugar), water, corn syrup, soy protein isolate, natural smoke flavor, salt, potassium sorbate (a preservative), paprika and sodium nitrite (another preservative).<br /><br />The pugs LOVE these, but please note the sugar/syrup and salt ingredients -- also the sodium nitrite. Think of these as little jerky-type treats for your dogs. This is "high value" food -- that is, your dogs will compete to get it if they are food-motivated. We find them very useful for training as our pugs will do literally anything for a little morsel of the Bit-O-Luvs. So, an excellent treat, but use sparingly (just good common sense). We will definitely purchase again.

review/summary: Premium Dog Treats has the dog begging
review/text: These are high grade dog treats and could pass for human food. I was going to try one but didn't. The dog loved them and enjoyed chewing them for a few seconds until she could swallow them. These might be a bit expensive, but if you want to feed your dog like you would eat yourself, these are a good bet.

review/summary: Dogs Like it
review/text: Our five dogs wouldn't write this so I did.  The dogs seem to like them, but lets be honest they will eat anything I drop on the floor from hotdogs to lettuce to stuffed animals.<br /><br />What I do like is the meat is USDA inspected and the product is made in the USA, it makes me nervous if the product is from China, Thailand, etc.  The setback is they are small and if you have big dogs they don't last too long and are fairly expensive.<br /><br />A percentage of the proceeds go to charities according to the bag but they do not say which ones. Just local ones according to their website.  Does that mean local to them or me?  I cannot find out on the their website which is pretty basic.

review/summary: What a Lucky Dog
review/text: This is a wonderful product.  Following the problems associated with dog and cat foods last year we have been hesitant in buying a lot of the treats we previously bought for our animals because we haven't been convinced they were altogether safe.  When this product says it's good enough for human consumption but made for our pet we gave it a try.  It's all that and more... our dog loves these treats.  Our dog is a well trained and wonderful pet, truly one of the family.  I actually placed one of these treats on the floor along with three other kinds of treats she really likes.  I told her she could have one.  She sniffed each of them and when I told her to "go ahead and take one.... just one", she returned her attention to the Bit-O-Luv Bistro Beef treat and took it over the others.  Just to ensure it wasn't an uneducated selection I repeated this "game" three more times over the next couple of days and the results were always the same.  I'm convinced... she really likes these treats.  Last night I opened her treat bin and selected another treat for her.  She nudged past the treat in my hand and went for the bag containing the Bit-O-Luv treats.  These are the perfect size for training or reward treats even thought they seem somewhat small for our 95 pound adopted German Shepard mix.  It seems size doesn't matter when they like them.... I'm thinking I will be able to get her to do some chores around the house if I promise her these treats as a reward.  I don't think anyone will be disappointed in this quality product.

review/summary: Our dog loved them as well, also good value
review/text: These treats were a big hit with our dog. If I can read dog body language one of his favorite treats I have yet to give him. Tail wags just a bit more vigorously when he sees this bag. The treats also, frankly, smell pretty good to me.<br /><br />As others have mentioned they look, feel, and smell like beef jerky. I like the size they are, a size any dog could eat although bigger dogs will probably need at least a few pieces per treat (there is a serving recommendation versus dog size printed on the bag). They are a perfect size for our Shih Tzu. At 4 ounces per bag they are a pretty good value for a quality dog treat. For our Shih Tzu who weighs about 20lbs (big) one bag can last a couple of weeks easily if we ration them out.<br /><br />Overall, I was also impressed with the ingredient list and no artificial colors or additives and real beef. As others pointed out dogs probably would have liked them just as much without the corn syrup though. I will be buying these again as our canine loves them, the size lets you ration them however you would like (just a little or a lot per serving), and they are a good value.

review/summary: Tails Wagging!
review/text: We have 2 Labradors, both hunting dogs, one yellow, short & a bit heavy, the other black, tall and lean.  They are both very good dogs and are house trained.  They both are able to sit, shake, lay down, roll over ... and BEG!  Boy are they good at that last one!!<br /><br />I opened the back of Bit-O-Luv Bistro Beef Recipe Dog Treats and both dogs were instantly very attentive to me, sitting up nice and pretty, and sweeping the floor with their tails!  Then they tried the treat that looks just like beef jerky ... whoa!  You want me to shake? Can I roll over for you? Anything - just give me another one!!!<br /><br />They were a hit!  Both dogs go crazy any time we go near that bag!!  Now, they are used to getting treats at least once a day ... but this bag is a different color than the ones they are used to - and they KNOW it!!<br /><br />Highly recommended for dog owners everywhere!<br /><br />-1smileycat :-)

review/summary: Dog loved them
review/text: I handed out samples to my parents toy poodles and my Newfoundland and they all thoroughly enjoyed them. The size of the treat is more appropriate for a small to medium dog than my large Newf, though that didn't stop her from wanting one when I picked up the bag.<br /><br />The ingredient list is pretty basic, which is good. Preservatives always make me a little uneasy, but the list is much better than the typical grocery store brand. If they were a snack for me, I'd say they went a little too heavy on the smoke flavor. The dogs didn't mind, and the smell didn't seem to stay on my hands for too long.<br /><br />I won't be buying them again, but primarily because of my dog's size, and because she would much rather have a piece of broccoli or some beans than something out of a plastic bag (odd, I know).

review/summary: GREAT treats for your four legged friends
review/text: These Bistro Beef treats remind me of beef jerky. but for dogs! Heck, it even smells like beef jerky. The ingredients are very healthy and it's actually made with real beef.<br /><br />My dogs go crazy every time they see the bag with the funny looking dog taken out. They are willing to do almost anything for it and they try to steal it from each other. Each piece is a pretty decent size and I have medium-sized dogs. One of them has to chew at it a little bit before he's able to take it down. The pieces may be a little bit big for smaller dogs but as long as they don't gulp it all at once, it should be OK.<br /><br />I have a black lab mix and a border collie mix and both enjoy it immensely. They have forgotten about their other treats.

review/summary: Popular item
review/text: I offered this product to my panel of independent testers, a Golden Retriever, a Jack Russell/Lab mix and a cat.  All three gave the treats enthusiastic praise, although to be fair the two dogs are quite easy to please.  They are though, so taken with these treats that they will come tearing into the house as soon as they hear the bag open which indicates a higher than usual approval rating.  Incidentally the cat usually materializes at the same time - high praise indeed.<br /><br />From my human point of view this is a great product.  The packaging is easy to open and close, and seals to keep the treats fresh (and keeps the cat out).  The individual treats are moist but not sticky or messy to handle, like some pet treats.  They appear very much like beef jerky.  The individual treats are a generous size and easy to tear into two or more pieces so I have been feeding my two or three testers smaller bites which they have not seemed to notice.  Although the product is labeled 'dog treat' my feline tester seemed to enjoy his samples, and in fact was discovered conducting his own independent test on the packaging (the seal seems to be cat resistant).<br /><br />Overall this is an excellent product, one that will be stocked in this household if for no other purpose that convincing the canine panel members to come into the house when called.

review/summary: Luv 'Em, but can't Afford 'Em
review/text: I feed a home prepared diet to my dogs, so treats made in the USA with high quality standards caught my attention. The Bit-O-Luv beef treats are fabulous; in fact my husband thought they were for him when I 1st opened the package. Needless to say, my dogs do luv 'em. I also like that the company supports 2 charities (I checked their web site to find out more).<br /><br />Alas, the down-side is price, price, price. If I did my math right, the cost per pound is nearly $16.00 when ordering the box of six 4 ounce pouches through amazon.com. That's a deal breaker for me for routine use.<br /><br />I did buy them for this year's Christmas gifts for my 4-legged, tail-wagging friends. And I'm sure the company set the most reasonable price they could, so if you can afford them, go for it ... your pups will adore you!

review/text: It's hard for a human to review a dog treat aside from gauging your dog's response to them. My dog really went for these and I'm going to buy them for her again. Most of the treats I've bought for her in the past were buried first and dug up later when she was hungry. She ate these right away.<br /><br />The treats are a little unusual in that they resemble beef jerky rather than being a soft, rubbery treat. Despite this, my old dog had no trouble chewing them.

review/summary: Rolly gives it two paws up
review/text: This package of Bit O Luv Bistro Beef Dog Treats contains 38 treats that look and smell like beef jerky measuring about 3/4 by 1 1/2 inches each.<br /><br />It's safe. The package states that this product is "made in the USA without any by-products, wheat gluten, artificial flavors or colors". This apparently is in response to last year's pet food fiasco where tainted wheat gluten from China added to pet foods resulted wide-spread recalls, near panic and the unfortunate death of cats and dogs.<br /><br />It's tasty. The package also states that it is "slow roasted to mouthwatering perfection". Despite the yummy, beef jerky aroma, I can only relate my dog's reaction: Rolly loved it! He wagged his tail the entire time as I fed him several pieces, one at a time. I then handed him one of his favorite biscuits, but snubbing that he wanted more of Bit O Luv treats.<br /><br />It's kind. Also stated on the package is "a percentage of our proceeds go to help four legged friends at local charities".<br /><br />Everyone's happy! You'll feel good giving your dog a safe, well balanced treat, your pooch will be happy with the enticing aroma and obviously delicious treat, and other critters will be happy when they receive benefits through local charities.

review/summary: Dog loves 'em, but I still prefer Oberto...
review/text: My cocker spaniel absolutely loves these.  When she sees I have the bag she refuses to leave my side.<br /><br />The main ingredients in the treats are beef, chicken, dextrose, water, corn syrup, soy protein, and salt.  Although I enjoy many of these ingredients in human jerky, I am not sure of how they are needed in dog treats in order to make them more palatable to dogs.  Bit o' Luv is a dog treat however, and the jerky similarities are fun for both dog and human.  I tried some and found it somewhat bland and flakey, so I'll stick with my Oberto brand.<br /><br />The spaniel's opinion of the Bit o' Luv treats is utterly positive.  The treats are fun, appealing, made in the USA in Oregon, and the maker donates a percentage of proceeds to canine non-profit organizations.

review/text: I have a small dog, 8lb malt about 9 years old.  He most recently became very finicky about what he eats. Some treats he'll try and then turn his nose to them, never to touch them again.  This is not the case with Bit-O-Luv.  My dog loves these treats.  I can get him to do things he would never do on his own, just by waving one of these in front of him.  Now no more strugling to get him to go into his kennel when I leave for work.  They have a good, but strong beef smell.  You can't hide them once you open them.  Keep them in a tightly closed container and/or out of reach of your pup or it will have tunnel vision till he reaches them.

review/summary: Stand in line to review these Dog Treats...
review/text: Okay - if you haven't yet clicked to find out what the "Vine Voice" program is I want to add this disclaimer. Amazon has used a ouija board and crystal ball to choose a handful of amateur reviewers who they consider helpful to the whole Amazon process. I don't know how many of us there are - I'd guess less than a couple thousand. Anyway - once a month Amazon sends us an email with a list of items we can try out in exchange for a review. 80% of the list are books and DVDs you probably never heard of. Every now and then some novel item shows up.<br /><br />Anyway, this month these dog treats appeared, and it appears that a large number of vine reviewers chose them. We have a Shi-tzu Maltese mix (yes, he is as cute as you'd think that combination makes.) We treat him for good behavior. (Mainly pooping and peeing outside.) We mixed these little babies in with the other flavors,and he likes them just fine. (Another disclaimer - this is the same animal that trolls kitty litter boxes looking for "treats".) So - the Bit-O-Luv beef treats are just fine at our house, and now they have a legion of adoring reviews from Amazon vine voice reviewers, which seems a little like getting Sam Seaborn to write a birthday card, if you know what I mean.

review/summary: Number one choice of my rotten little chihuahuas
review/text: My dogs are pigs, but they are finicky little pigs, and majorly obsessive-compulsive about their "biscuits." Juliet, my 21-lb. chihuahua with Cushing's disease, will holler for hours until she gets her biscuit. (Daylight savings time? Hey, she knows what time it REALLY is!)<br /><br />I decided to do an experiment: I gave Juliet a choice of her ritualistically favored biscuit (Milkbone for small dogs), a Beneful biscuit I'd just bought with a coupon, and the Bit-O-Luv Bistro treat. Juliet almost snapped my finger off to get the Bit-O-Luv treat and then started begging for another one, totally ignoring the other treats that were right there in front of her.<br /><br />Uh-oh. Methinks we have created a monster here....<br /><br />I then used one of the Bit-O-Luv treats to help trick her into taking her pill for her Cushing's disease, which she mightily detests. (Pill pockets did not work but a few times; peanut butter and bread have stopped working, too.) I just let her smell the Bit-O-Luv treat, crammed the pill down her throat and then gave her the treat immediately. She didn't do her usual trying to spit the pill out and gobbled the treat down. So that's good.<br /><br />Well, let me describe the treats. They look like jerky strips. Real jerky strips, like I make in my food dehydrator with real ground beef. They are soft enough to break into small pieces, so I may make it part of our ritual to toss little bits of treats to the dogs when they are doing their usual infernal begging for dinner-table scraps, instead of the more fattening stuff (like fried chicken skin) they insist on but should not have. They seem a bit expensive at first, until you realize how much meat is in them. Price human-food jerky next time you're in the store and you'll realize these are reasonably priced.

review/text: The dogs love these treats. The ingredients are mostly natural. For kicks, I even nibbled on one, and it wasn't too bad. Tasted like beef jerky. I would use these as occasional treats. I don't want the dogs getting too used to anything besides their kibbles and carrots for snacks. The only downside, and the reason it got 4/5 stars, is because it gave 1 out of 3 dogs gas. I would buy these in the future.

review/summary: Dexter the Pug Loves these things!
review/text: According to Dexter, these treats are to die for. He is quite fussy about treats but he really has a big Bit-O Luv for these doggie treats. He comes running when he hears me opening the package. He is quite a fat Puggy, so I have to give treats sparingly. They smelled very good to me with none of the unpleasant odor of treats that are not USA made.Good ingredients. I will defintely buy these when they come to my pet store.

review/summary: Happy Puppy
review/text: Bought these for my Min-Pin, he's a real treat hound. Usually I give him treats after coming inside right by the door & then he takes then into another room to enjoy. The "Bit-O-luv" treats he wolfs down on the spot & goes looking for more. So I'm guessing he really likes them. Someday I may try one myself. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HN5Z4K">Bit-O-Luv Bistro Beef Recipe Dog Treats, 4.0-Ounce Pouch (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Passes "Lab" Testing
review/text: It's difficult to know how to rate this product as I have to confess, despite my personal pledge never to review a book I haven't read or a product I haven't used, I wasn't willing to try these dog treats and even if I would, I wouldn't have enough experience with other treats to make a fair comparison.  (OK, there was that one incident in college involving <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000633TU4">Milk-Bone Large Original Dog Biscuits</a> but the less said about that, the better!)<br /><br />So, in this age of high technology what better way to test something than to send it out to "the lab".  Of course in this case, it's a 70 pound Yellow English Labrador Retriever named Casey, but you get my point I hope.<br /><br />The results are in and "the lab" approves.  The size of the treats are smaller perhaps than what a larger breed would normally want, but there's nothing wrong with doubling up for them.  The aroma of the treats were enough to send Casey into a full cycle of sit, stay, lay down, roll over and shake hands and to hold her attention during training and normal rewards.<br /><br />The packaging is convenient and resealable.  A good product experience and I would consider purchasing them again in the future.<br /><br />5 barks!<br /><br />Bart Breen

review/summary: My 2 dogs LOVED Them!
review/text: I have a lab and a golden retriever/lab mix.  As soon as I gave them one of these treats, they acted as though they'd been given something REALLY special.  One ran off to hide with it, and the other ate hers quickly, and looked around for more.  It was as though I'd given them steak, and not the usual dog biscuits.  As others have said, they're like a piece of beef jerky in shape and size.  I have to keep them hidden from the dogs or they would find a way to get to them.  That rarely happens with the bones I buy them, but these they REALLY loved.<br /><br />They seem a bit pricey to me, but no doubt they're worth it for those who like to spoil their pets.  It's hard to speak for my dogs, but this treat was definitely a step above the usual treats I give them.  They normally only run off and hide with the really good stuff, so, obviously this product would fall under the category of "really good stuff", to my dogs!

review/summary: My pup LOVES them, but I find them a little too smelly!
review/text: I only wish I had a digital camcorder so that I could have done a video review of this product, because my 11-month-old Shih Tzu pup, Missy, goes quite bonkers for these treats!  I have been using them as training treats (cut in 2-3 pieces) and it is safe to say she is motivated to do what I ask because she wants that beefy bite!  In fact, she often gets SO excited and consumed by the thought of getting the treat that it is hard to get her to pay attention to my commands!<br /><br />The good:<br />1.  Made in the USA without by-products, gluten or artificial flavors/colors.<br />2.  First two ingredients are BEEF and CHICKEN!  (USDA inspected, too!)<br />3.  A % of profits go to help animals at local charities.<br />4.  Missy LOVES them!<br /><br />The not-as-good:<br />1.  They use natural smoke flavor in the treats and it is VERY STRONG.  It hit me like a ton of bricks when I opened the bag.  I have to immediately wash my hands after giving Missy the treat or else she will continue to pester me because she thinks I have more treats in my hand.  Plus, I just don't want to go thru my day smelling like that!<br />2.  Though I haven't eaten one myself, I get the sense that they may be a bit too salty.  Missy often heads to the water bowl right after she's had one of these treats, and she never does that with her other treats (granted, though, her usual treats are a biscuit-type treat vs. a meaty-type treat).<br /><br />The day the treats arrived from amazon, another box arrived at the same time.  When I brought both boxes in the house, I told Missy that one of the boxes was for her.  She immediately honed in on one box, sniffing madly, and when I opened it, sure enough, it was the dog treats!  The natural smoke flavor, no doubt.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very happy that it's a good quality treat and that Missy loves them, but the smoke smell is just a bit too much.  Hence, 4 stars vs. 5.

review/summary: Scientific testing is fun
review/text: One reviewer fed his dog vegetables and then observed that it likes these treats. Let's see, you are a dog and your owner feeds you broccoli and brussel sprouts and then offers you smoked and spiced meat. You think you might like really go for Bistro Beef? Doh!<br /><br />I, on the other hand, formed a scientific review board to test this product. This consisted of me, my two sons,  a dog, Bubba, an active bug-eyed Boston Terrier, and Max, a large friendly orange cat.<br /><br />First, we reviewed the ingredients. Sounded good to the humans what with the smoky flavor and all. My initial theory was that it was really beef jerky byproducts of some kind.<br /><br />The humans tasted the treats and were surprised that the taste was very mild and the texture quite soft. Clearly these are not beef jerky byproducts. The smoky flavor was noticeable, but not dominating. The spices not at all forward, actualy almost absent. The beef flavor is very subtle as well. We were surprised and a little disappointed that they weren't all that flavorful or delicious to us.<br /><br />Max sniffed the treats and walked off. This is an animal that eats mice. Hmmm. Humans and cats don't like this product. Time to try an actual dog.<br /><br />Bubba was quite happy with the Bit-O-Luv dog treats. He inhaled his share instantly and begged for more.<br /><br />Our scientific tests prove that The Bit-O-Luv Bistro Beef dog treats are just that; a treat for dogs. The smoked flavor and natural ingredients are there to attract humans and make them buy this product. You could serve these treats to deserving humans as a form of childish amusement, but that would be wrong. Your cat won't eat them, so don't even try that.<br /><br />Our suggestion is that this product is an excellent reward for a dog that has been good and obeys commands, like Lassie. It is too expensive for bad dogs and I have to resent the smoked meat and spices approach. Enough to take off a star for me, others may disagree.

review/summary: It's for the dogs!
review/text: These treats conveniently arrived this morning while I was dog sitting for my friend's golden doodle and maltese. I opened the package and I instantly had her two dogs and mine (a black lab/rottie mix) at attention with noses in my lap. And when I told them all to sit, they plunked those bottoms right down as they quivered in anticipation.... even the little maltese who thinks she's above such things as obeying commands. All three dogs loved the treats and were anxious for more. The treats are about an inch and a half long, making the ideal size for training larger dogs and, as I discovered today, the dogs will do practically anything for one. The fact that they are made from 100% beef and have no artificial colors or icky fillers mean a healthier treat for my pooch, hopefully adding years to our life together. I'm sold on these and plan to keep ordering them for my four legged friends.

review/summary: Wonderful New Snack
review/text: Bit o Luv is the new dog treat on the block, one that appears to be of high pedigree. With just a whiff from the newly opened bag, our three girls were definitely interested. And why not?  The maker tells us that these treats are made from human grade meats and USDA inspected. You'll find no artificial ingredients here, no wheat gluten, and no by-products. The fifth ingredient listed is corn syrup, so you don't want to overdo it with too many snacks.<br /><br />Each rectangular treat is an inch and a half of doggy heaven according to my taste testers, Evie, Piper, and Bella. The intense smoky aroma wafting from the package hooked them instantly. Each eagerly grabbed the new treat from my hand and gave it their seals of approval. They're actually a little too big for the shih tzu pair, so for them I tore the treats in half. Bit o Luvs seem to have the texture and consistency of dried jerky.<br /><br />I'm happy with the recipe of these new, high quality snacks. The girls love the flavor. It's a win-win situation.

review/summary: Jerky for dogs
review/text: So, my Norwegian Elkhound likes most treats - some more than others. I have used a variety of treats to work on training with her as well. Things from yogurt drops, milkbones, and pupcorn.<br /><br />I knew these were a hit when I opened the bag, turned around, and when I looked back at her she was drooling. She will do pretty much anything for these treats.<br /><br />These are basically mini-beef jerky strips for dogs. There are quite a few in a 4 oz package (more than I actually thought there would be). There is a little bit of an odor, but I have ran across other treats that have a more offensive odor than these.<br /><br />All in all a good treat, and Elkhound approved!

review/text: These treats are about 2.5" by 1" rectangles of beef jerky. They looked tempting to me when I received them - but I didn't actually try them myself. Here are the dog's ratings:<br /><br />Simon, a Covelo hound (a pit, lab?, Australian shepard?, ?, mix) who eats pretty much anything he is given, gave these treats a 7.5 out of 10.<br /><br />Rajah, a Tibetan Terrier and a notoriously picky eater, gave them an encouraging 6 out of 10.

review/summary: A Soft Slim Jim for the Dogs
review/text: In addition to our cats, we have a fussy chihuahua who is generally not very food motivated. That is, she'll go nuts for breakfast and dinner, but isn't much into treats. In fact, she walks away from roughly 9 out of 10 treats that we've tried.<br /><br />When it comes to Bit-O-Luv, she takes a mild interest in it. That's not a slam against Bit-O-Luv, it's just the way Bettie is. Point is, the fact she paid attention at all is pretty great!<br /><br />Each piece is a soft, 1 inch strip that looks and smells like a flat slim jim or some other type of jerky. There's enough toughness to make it a good chew for dogs, but not tough enough probably for teeth cleaning. There are probably better options out there.<br /><br />All in all, a quality dog treat and good value for the price, but probably best for medium or large dogs. Would love something like this to use for training, that is if my own dog *wanted* to be trained.

review/summary: Both my dogs love these treats!!!
review/text: We have two dogs, a younger black lab and a older chihuahua who has lost most of his teeth.  Both dogs love these treats.  They are soft enough for my old dog (the one who has very few teeth left).  And the younger lab?  She usually takes treats ever-so-gently from my fingers (no risk of bites with this gal).  However, she gets so excited about these Bit-O-Luv treats that she nearly takes my fingers off!  I'll definitely have to be more careful when giving these to her.  But, to see the look of appreciation on her face -- it's worth risking life and limb to give these to her.<br /><br />These cost a bit more than the other treats I've purchased.  However, because both my dogs love them so much, I'll definitely keep a supply on hand.<br /><br />An added benefit is that "they're made in the USA without any by-products, wheat gluten, artificial colors or flavors."  The package states that "we even have our beef and chicken inspected by the USDA."

review/summary: Gormet treats any dog would love
review/text: Obviously my dog loves these but he loves milk bones too. If you are concerned with your pet having a more natural diet these would be a step in the right direction. They smell very tempting but I guess that is my problem with them. It seems like they are making a product targeted for the pet owner more than the pet. Dogs really love old road kill. Why not sell that? What cold be more natural? Of course I'm being sarcastic. I have enough problems keeping my dog from dragging his "treasures" in.<br />My point is why put a sugar sweet barbecued  taste to a pet treat? I will only help to decay his teeth and I spend enough money on his teeth. Once or twice a year my dog needs a anesthetized descaling and cleaning. Why feed him a product with sugar? As I said, my dog loves milk bones and dental rawhide chews as much as these, so I guess I will stick with them. I gave 4 stars because they make what they claim, but they need to leave out the things that are targeted for the owner rather than a dog.

review/summary: All Paws Up in my 3 Dog Household
review/text: I am a certified "dog nut" and have been all my life.  When it comes to anything foodwise for my canines, I have pretty well bought and taste tested it on my dogs.  Luckily, they don't seem to mind too much.  This treat is at or near the top of their list.  They smelled the bag when it arrived in the shipping box and have been begging for it ever since.  The treats themselves are a good size for medium dogs and I tear one in half for each of my two Pugs.  The texture is a little moister than beef jerky, so it holds together but is not too difficult for them to chew.  I will say I think the treat size is too small for larger dogs.  My Rottie gulped his down so fast (no need to chew) he never even got one chomp out of it.<br /><br />The ingredients seem okay for sensible treating, but I wouldn't use them for training or overindulging as they seem very highly flavored and have a deeply smoky coating.<br /><br />I am leary of the claim that says their meat is USDA inspected.  Truth almost every meat is "USDA Inspected" these days, what they don't say is if or not it passed inspection and if so, what grade it passed with.<br /><br />Dogs seemed to love it, but I would use it with a light hand.

review/summary: He LOVES them!
review/text: Our 5� year old Carolina Dog (if you don't know what they are - Google them - they're fascinating!) absolutely loves these.  He's very polite, never whining or insisting for "just one more" of anything - until now.  From the first one, he almost refused to just eat one.  They're small, handy, and almost smell good enough to eat for humans (if you like things like Hickory Farms smoked sausage).  And the ingredients are excellent - not just a bunch of grain fillers.  We won't feed our dog (or previous dogs) "junk" snacks.  Will we get these again?  You bet!  I've never seen any of our dogs go for a "treat" like ours has with these.  Our reviews only get 5 stars if they're truly superior - and this easily rates the full 5.

review/summary: So happy I placed this order!!!
review/text: I have been looking for Arrowroot starch everywhere.  If and that is a big IF a local store carries it, it costs about $5 for a tiny bottle the size of a spice bottle.  I know how helpful Arrowroot starch can be in cooking so I knew I wanted more and didn't want to pay so much for so little, especially with summer pies and things coming up soon.  I almost ordered the McCormick  brand it was like $38 for two 20 ounce bottles and is a brand I trust but it wasn't available right away.  I'm glad it wasn't now because I bought this instead and couldn't be more pleased with the quality of the product.  I use it to thicken everything from soup to fruit cobblers/pies.  It's does a wonderful job quickly thickening and stays clear so it doesn't effect the look or taste of your dish.  This was a much better price than the McCormick and while it comes well sealed in plastic bags instead of a resealable bottle that's okay with me.  It was a heck of a deal, I just opened my first bag and put it in a resealable lock and lock container for storage.  I got it earlier this week and have already used it several times.  I would not hesitate to order this again or to try any of the other products this company has now that I see the level of quality they produce.

review/summary: Lower Carb substitute for cornstarch
review/text: I enjoy cooking and need to watch carbohydrates because of my husband's diabetes. I was shocked to read the label of cornstarch and see how it is loaded with carbs. This arrowroot powder works just fine in all of my recipes; it is smooth and silky and much lower in carbs. Being vegetarian, it is also handy for thickening all kinds of sauces and tofu-based recipes.

review/summary: Another great Bob's Red Mill product
review/text: I have this item on automatic shipment receiving 3 boxes per month for our larger family. We all eat a GF/DF + diet. Because there are multiple food allergies in our family, grocery shopping can be a bit pricey. Amazon's prices allow us to buy the ingredients we need at a price that doesn't break the bank, and Bob's Red Mill provides the high quality products that provide consistent tasty results every time.<br /><br />This arrowroot flour is a must have in the gluten-free kitchen. We pair this with the Bob's Red Mill Garbanzo Bean flour, using equal amounts of each in our recipes, for fantastic results every. single. time.  My daughter professionally makes allergen free cakes and goodies, and this product, with the garbanzo bean flour, are her go to pairing for almost all of her treats. Everyone enjoys the end results - even those who do not follow a GF diet. That's the true test, and Bob's Red Mill ingredients pass the test every time.

review/summary: much better than wheat flour and corn starch!
review/text: After reading Wheat Belly I decided I want to consume much less wheat and wheat flour products for my health. I also realize that until products carry the GMO label that I need to avoid wheat and corn based foods to avoid GMO crops.  Arrowroot powder is a very appropriate replacement for flour or cornstarch for thickening, plus it contains other beneficial properties as well.<br /><br />I discovered through trial and error that it is possible to make a "white gravy" utilizing arrowroot powder and either nut milk ir coconut milk along with sea salt and other seasonings.  Experiment with arrowroot powder and let your creative juices flow.  At this price point per pound you cannot go wrong.  Sauces and gravies require much less arrowroot powder as a thickener than when using flour or cornstarch.
