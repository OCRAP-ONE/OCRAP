review/summary: Worst cup of coffee I've ever had
review/text: I've really enjoyed every Starbucks Via variety I've tried -- the Italian and Colombian roasts, caramel and iced coffees especially. However, I've been hoping for a more mild blend since Starbucks can be a little too strong at times. So I was really excited to try this Breakfast Blend via, which is labeled as "mild." Sadly, it's anything but. It's not only still strong, but also bitter, and leaves an awful sour aftertaste. I can't bring myself to drink another cup, even if it means a waste of money. Horrible.

review/summary: Made tasty popcorn
review/text: I purchased this to make "popcorn", which I saw on Andrew Zimmern's Bizarre Foods (Ethiopia episode, season three). I placed a small pot with a lid on medium-high heat with some canola oil. I added the sorghum, and then kept the kernels moving. Amazingly, they actually started popping. I half-expected them to simply burn, but they popped quite nicely. Sorghum kernels are very small, producing a miniature "popcorn" that is slightly larger than an unpopped popcorn kernel. Popped sorghum has a heavier, fuller taste than regular popcorn. Best of all, there are no kernel husks in the end result... just little fluffy popped sorghum. I experimented with popping different quantities and found that keeping the amount limited works best. With larger quantities, a significant number of the kernels did not pop. However, this wasn't all that bad... as the unpopped sorghum kernels were very delicious as well, not at all hard or crunchy. The unpopped kernels had a nice toasted flavor, a lot like corn nuts.<br /><br />Sorghum is one of those "wonder grains", that is used for everything from making sugar, molasses, animal feed, alcohol and biofuel. But, I now know that it makes a nice popcorn as well.

Google high temp cooking oil and get it to the point where it is starting to smoke just a little.<br />At that point you put in the grain and POP it goes.

review/text: I am giving the sorghum a three only because I did not know how or what to do with the product.  There was no instructions sent in with the product.  I wanted to make popcorn out of them but I did not know how much oil or how much time or on what heat setting.  I tried several times and it was a complete failure.  My girlfriend was waiting to see how it tasted before she ordered some.  It was too hard for us to figure out on our own so now I have a bag of sorghum siting in my cabinet taking up space.  Anyone out there know how to pop sorghum?

Mix it with a little ketchup and you have QUICK Russian/Thousand Island Salad Dressing, the list goes on.

review/summary: Pamela's Bread Mix
review/text: At last a really delicious bread mix that tastes like real bread.  I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and added 5 tablespoons of ground flaxseed.  I don't have a bread machine and it was a bit tricky to mix with my old hand mixer but it rose beautifully and baked up perfectly.  The smell of freshly baked bread was wonderful.  We couldn't wait and cut the loaf before it was completely cool.  No problem!  The loaf was moist and tasted like real bread.  Maybe the flaxseed and coconut oil helped.  The bread was fresh for days right up until the last crumb was gobbled up.  Sliced thinly, it makes great toast too.  I'm not a fan of those bean flours and this bread was much better than the others I have tried.

review/text: I purchased a case of this bread mix because my daughter has celiac and I find it so hard to find products at a reasonable price. I have made 3 out of the 6 packages and only 1 turned out.  There is no date on the yeast packet so on the last one I finally decided to use my own yeast and that did rise properly.  My packs are dated May 22, 2010 but like I said the yeast has no date on it like other products I have bought.  My bar code is 93709 30060.  So needless to say when I thought I was saving money it actually cost me just the same price as when I show at the store.  I will continue to look for products on the website.  Thank you for letting me vent a bit.

review/text: I've taken the gluten-free baking classes from the CIA and, although you're taught to make good gluten-free bread, this is much better.  Simply because it is so quick & easy.  You don't have to worry about the bread rising.<br /><br />Make sure you use a mixer.  If you try to mix it by hand, the bread won't rise properly.  Additionally, the pizza dough is great with diced olives, homemade roasted red peppers, basil & garlic - all in the dough.<br /><br />Finally, I'm also allergic to corn, soy, beans, nuts, and a ton of other stuff. So, unless I make it myself, this is my only choice (other than some of the Namaste products).

review/text: Yes, people will like Pamela's gluten free bread mix.  I did too BUT do the math on the very high amount to sweetener in this mix.  9 grams per slice (based on their stated 16 slices per loaf)!  This is 144 grams for the loaf which comes to 1 1/4 cups of sweetener.  As you know that's 15 tablespoons in the mix (approximately) so compare that to your favorite recipes.  I see no one else coming even close to this in mixes or recipes.  I can't think of any reason they are doing this except for taste - to make it more sellable.  Just a heads up since we need to be cutting back on sugars not ramping up.<br /><br />:-)

review/summary: my GFCF son's favorite bread
review/text: My son is on a GFCF diet and most of the premade breads he can eat are really pretty terrible. This stuff is awesome. Its moist and pleasantly dense, with a slightly sweet flavor reminiscent of potato bread. It couldn't be easier to make, especially using a bread machine (and I have a 10 y/o cheapo machine). He has been eating this bread over a year now, and it consistently bakes up beautifully. The 2-lb loaf this makes works out to about the same price as a 1-lb loaf of premade bread, when bought via Subscribe and Save.<br /><br />The recipe calls for eggs, which is fine for us because my son can eat them. My nephew also eats this bread but made with Egg Replacer. It still comes out ok and he likes it, although its a little denser and flatter than when using real eggs.

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: I just made this bread for the first time, and it is awesome! Tastes just like the real thing! My 15 month old is gluten free and I wanted to make him a PB&J (well almond butter and jelly -- peanut allergy as well!) he is allergic to eggs too so I used Ener-G egg replacer and baked it in the oven. I didn't cook it long enough though, although I think my oven isn't as hot as it should be.  My 4 year old loved it as well, told me she wanted 2 slices in her lunch for school! I am so excited to have found a bread mix!

review/summary: Great bread if you tweak the recipe a little - then you get Challah!!
review/text: A kind friend bought a six pack of these for us to try out. My pre teen has Celiac and our kitchen is GF and we are always willing to try out different GF items. Our current bread standby is from Glutino and, while it is not perfect, my kids enjoy it - especially when used to make french toast!<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVG8H4">The Gluten-Free Pantry Favorite Sandwich Bread Mix, 22-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />The first four packs I made I followed to the letter. I was a little disappointed that the instructions on the back for using the bread mix for oven baked bread, bagels, pizza dough, cinnamon bread and egg free bread all stated in large bold lettering that it required the use of a heavy duty stand mixer. I don't have one and so those options were out for me.  But still, using the recipe for breadmakers turned out decent (if fairly flat) loaves. I made the basic recipe and the sweet bread. The instructions state that you should make this on a Basic White bread setting instead of the Gluten free setting on your breadmaker and that is what I did.<br /><br />(Note that if you are buying this mix to bake in your oven, the package states that you need to use a stand mixer!)<br /><br />My child said that the bread was okay but that it had a wierd texture and taste to it. I think the texture was due to the grainy nature of the 3 rice flours in the mix. The flavor, I think, is the Millet flour which tends to have a bitter aftertaste. Millet does have good nutritional value but if the flavor turns off the child from eating it what is the point??<br /><br />Anyway, I still had two packs to go so I decided to tweak things a little. I made the sweet bread recipe again but this time I used butter instead of oil and baked it in my Zojirushi breadmaker on a programmed gluten free program and Voila! The bread rose beautifully! It had a light airy feel to it; a bit spongy - almost like a cake. The 1/4 cup sugar covered up the bitterness of the millet, home made butter (could use unsalted) instead of the melted oil made it rich - and it tastes almost exactly like Challah bread!<br /><br />So if you are just GF and not CF as well, this is a sure fire way to make some excellent sweet egg bread.  And if, like us, you miss your Shabbat Challah, this bread mix will be a wonderful addition to your kitchen!

review/summary: Amazon's Convenience Store
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DZFMEQ">Pamela's Products Wheat-Free & Gluten-Free, Amazing  Bread Mix, 19-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a> I buy (and need) a variety of gluten-free grocery products--mostly in the baking category.  I've been fortunate to find the desired items in my local shopping area, but that effort is tarnished with too much time, travel, and occasional disappointment with product availability. Amazon came to the rescue with quite a few gluten-free cooking and bakery items advertised on their web pages. Now I've come to depend on several of my favorites, most importantly Pamela's Wheat-Free & Gluten-Free Amazing Bread Mix. I love it, and I say that while speaking from the experience of being on a gluten-free diet for over nine years. I've been baking bread at home all that time, using various recipes having around a dozen ingredients. The results with a few of those chosen recipes have been quite good, certainly a far cry from the comparable  products in the stores. For some time now I've baked with the bread mixes offered by several out-of-state companies. The results--passable but nothing to rave about. Then I discovered Pamela's products in local stores and couldn't believe the high quality, great taste and density (2+ pounds per loaf) of the amazing gluten-free bread mix (just four ingredients plus the mix to bake it).  Now I opt for that continually and the big surprise came when I saw that Amazon.com carried it on their Web site. More satisfaction developed over the fact that Amazon delivered a six-bag box in just a few days and with a  very satisfactory and competitive price that changed me from a struggling on-the-road shopper to a stay-at-home baker. Thank you Amazon--for the bread mix, cookies and oatmeal, all gluten-free.

review/text: So far this is the best gluten free mix I have tried.  The first time I tried it the bread didn't come out that good, I was wondering what I had done wrong, sure enough, I read the instructions again and I noticed that it states not to use the GF setting on the bread machine, to pick the basic white.  My next bread came out perfect.

review/summary: No longer the baking mix that I used to love!
review/text: When my son and I were diagnosed with Celiac's Disease, I was on the hunt for a bread mix that would make good bagels. I finally found it with Pamela's baking mix. Always enjoying the texture and taste up until January 2011. When I baked up some bagels with the new batch something changed in their mix...and I just couldn't quite figure it out. The color was lighter and the bagels would no longer rise as they used to. The smell was nauseating while it baked and left me with a bad aftertaste and sour stomach. The texture was not chewy and the bagels did not have that beautiful golden brown color to them anymore. I was so disappointed and upset that they changed their mix which was Amazing just the way it was!  The company may receive their flour from another manufacture or they may have changed flour ratio. Whatever they have done, PLEASE change the flour back to the way it used to be! You have lost a dedicated customer! Such a Shame! =(

review/summary: This Bread Mix is Aces!
review/text: This is by far the best GF bread mix I've tried. I have made some super tasty "from scratch" GF loaves in my Zojirushi bread machine but none of them hold together for hearty sandwiches as well as Pamela's mix does. It is fabulous toasted or untoasted, and even works in the panini press without breaking up and falling apart. I follow the directions on the package and it comes out perfectly every time. Lately I've been using the seed bread recipe, although I don't care for poppy seeds so I just put in extra sunflower seeds. I always add extra sesame seeds for the top. When it has fully cooled I slice it up and freeze it so it stays fresh and ready to use for toast and sandwiches. This mix also makes surprisingly good bagels! Better than any supermarket bagel, frozen or fresh. I make this bread so often that I have the six-pack set up here on Subscribe and Save for a discounted price and free shipping. Highly recommended!

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I absolutely LOVE this bread-maker bread mix.  It is very easy to use, with the yeast included in each package.  There is no measuring except for the oil and water, and it is delicious.  I had been discouraged with the taste of many gluten-free breads, but this is enjoyed by my non-gluten-free friends, also.  In fact, if I bring a fresh loaf to a pot-luck, I usually do not have any to take home for myself! This is the best thing I have found "since sliced-bread". (Haha)In addition, buying a case of six from Amazon is much cheaper than buying 6 packages from off the store shelves.

review/text: Honestly, I wasn't expecting much... I was expecting it to taste like gravel dust! I was seriously mistaken. This bread is awesome! I couldn't tell that it was gluten free... tastes like homemade bread, more like homemade dinner rolls. Even though I'm not sure I put enough water in the mix (I fluffed the eggs and it threw the measurement off) it still turned out simply wonderful. Also, this bread has other variations you can do with the recipe, raisin bread, pizza dough, dinner rolls, pretzels, garlic bread, et cetera... I look forward to trying the whole lot. The only bad part... it's expensive to be gluten free, but if you've got to have bread, this is the bread to get.

review/summary: Makes great bagels!
review/text: This mix works very well for making bagels.  The recipe is on the side of the package.  I haven't had great success with making bread with it.  It's too heavy and it falls after baking.  Maybe that's an altitude problem or something?  Anyway, I use it frequently for making bagels and toast the bagels and use them to make open faced sandwiches or anything that I need bread for.  The flavor is very good - a little sweet with a whole grain flavor.  I've used it to make pizza crust too and that's pretty good too.  The bagels are my favorite though!

review/summary: Maybe I did something wrong here...?....
review/text: I ordered this stuff in bulk, because the reviews looked so good, I had no doubt that it would be great.  Maybe I'm a little hard on it because I'm like a champion bread maker.  I was almost destroyed when I figured out gluten was causing my psoriasis.  My bread turned out mishapen and like a brick.  Just super heavy, and like week old regular bread.  Kinda crumbly.  It takes like an hour and a half to finish cooking on the inside.  I guess gluten free bread is so bad, that this is the best we could come up with.  I must say it had a nicer aroma than the other bread I tried, but I just am not impressed.  I'm going to bake another loaf, and pray that I did something wrong the first time.  I don't mean to be a "debbie downer", but if this is the very best out there, and I've heard that it is, I may just be giving up sandwiches all together!  I hope your bread turns out better than mine.  Is there a way to repost a review if my next loaf turns out great?  Oh well... just don't be surprised if your first loaf is a disaster, because I'm a kitchen queen, and it was no good.  P.S.  I'm vegan and had to use an egg substitute.  Maybe the secret is in the eggs?

I woofed it down so fast that I don't recall tasting any difference from any of the non-gf breads I used to make before diagnosis. I did not even care that it fell during the baking process (supposed to create a 2 lb. loaf and I made it in my 1 1/2 lb. machine and it was less than that after falling). I read somewhere that someone else had this problem and added a little extra yeast and it had worked.

review/summary: Very good bread, even for non-GF people
review/text: My sister has been gluten-free for a while now, and while she was able to find an acceptable pasta (try the Tinyaka or one made from a blend of grains), she gave up on bread because all of the store bought loaves were completely inedible and very expensive.  I wound up making breadcrumbs from all the loaves that would have gone to waste.  When my mother told us that a friend of hers loved this bread mix, my sister went out and bought a bread machine and ordered the Pamela's wheat-free/gluten-free bread mix.  She wanted to try one and fully expected to give the rest to mom's friend.  Much to her surprise, this bread was better than good.  It was very good!  I am not gluten-free, but I would definitely eat this bread.  It has the taste and texture of a dense whole grain bread.  Be sure to follow the directions exactly!  I don't think you'll be disappointed.  The only downside is the price.  Next time we'll order the bulk mix.

review/text: Pamela's gluten-free bread is THE best!  It is miles ahead of other gluten-free brands.  The bread is delicious and moist.  We use a bread maker and add in raisins or cranberries to enhance the enjoyablity of the bread.  It is also excellent toasted.

review/text: I've been trying this bread mix for around six months now, firstly by mixing it manually and then in a bread maker; both come out first class but the bread maker version just has the edge! The baked loaf has a superb flavour as well as retaining it's moisture for days. If you are thinking of using this great gluten free product then don't hesitate, just buy it and enjoy.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DZFMEQ">Pamela's Products Wheat-Free & Gluten-Free Bread Mix, 19-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Try the bagels!
review/text: My son has celiac and I've tried many bread products since his diagnosis 6 months ago.  I hated all of them except this one.  The bread was good, but I tried the recipe on the bag for the bagels and they were great!!!! I was so pleased to have a decent bagel to pack in his lunch instead of those horrible smelling frozen ones.

review/summary: Best gluten-free bread!
review/text: I'm a big Pamela's fan and this bread mix does not disappoint.  It rises and bakes nicely every time, forming a delicious brown crust.  Important to note is that the bread does come out a bit sweeter than I remember regular wheat bread tasting when I used to bake it.  But I have used this bread for garlic bread, sandwiches - you name it - and it's fantastic!  My kids love it for grilled cheese.<br /><br />The first time I baked it, I made it in a bread maker and I remember being unimpressed - it seemed too moist and dense.  But I tried mixing it in my stand mixer and baking it in the oven (which, by the way, was hardly any more work that just throwing it into the bread machine) and it has come out perfect every time.  I've done the cinnamon bread variation on the back of the package (which I made into french toast... yum) and also made bagels with this mix.  All turned out very well.  The bagels, while a little labor intensive with the boiling, were tender and delicious (and made fantastic roasted red pepper and herbed cream cheese sandwiches).  Purchasing this with Amazon's subscribe and save will save you a lot of money... you can't go wrong!

review/text: I try to always have a loaf of bread in the freezer for my daughter who has a gluten intolerance.  We prefer the taste of this gluten-free flour over others I've used so far, so I also use the mix without yeast to replace almost anything that I used regular flour for in the past...to make gravies, hush puppies, breading for things like chicken fried steak, etc.

review/summary: pamelas Vs BRM
review/text: I feel bad for alot of other gf bread/baking flour makers because if more peopl discover the goodnes of pamela bread mix they would go out of business my sister and I are celiac and believe me we tried it all. We tried baking our own to purchasing about every different mix we could find and It came down to pamelas or brm because they are more readily available at local grocery stores. Let me tell you Pamela blows them all away. I've had family member and co-workers (who by this time were pretty scared of taste testing my gf baked goods) completly surprised some even said they preferred over wheat varieties. The Sweet bread recipe taste almost like a moist potato bread. Sorry BRM

review/summary: finally gfcf bread that actually tasted like bread!
review/text: My son just started the gfcf diet due to severe intolerances to both.  We've been on the diet as a family so finding a good sandwich bread has been a top priority for the past month and a half.  I've tried countless recipes in a cookbook I have as well as a couple of mixes and none of them were what I was looking for even though my 2 year old would eat them.  None of them were terrible just they didn't taste like the bread I remembered.  My mother in law was kind enough to buy me this mix at the health food store near her house as mine only sold the big $15 bag mix which I didn't want to buy unless I knew we'd use it.  I am so glad she bought this!  I followed the bread machine instructions.  Baked one night and let it cool while we all slept.  We had sandwiches for lunch the next day and boy was I surprised when the bread actually tasted like BREAD!  I still have a few recipes I want to try out but this is definitely going to be a staple in our house!  Thank you Pamela's for gfcf bread that actually tastes like bread!  It's a lifesaver!

review/text: I've tried a number of gluten-free breads and bread mixes and they all tasted like sawdust...but this mix from Pamela's Products is the exception.  It is moist and heavy but is close in texture and taste to "regular" bread when used for sandwiches and such. I slice mine real thin. I cannot get it to toast, but it's still good with jelly. It makes easily in the bread-maker.

review/summary: Nearly Perfect Wheat-Free Bread Mix
review/text: Pamela's mix is the best on the market.  And though it's machine made, this bread is heavenly, especially a fresh, hot slice slathered with real butter.  I've found that when sealed in a gallon-size ZipLoc bag, a loaf will stay fresh for 5 or 6 days -- but it rarely lasts that long because it's soooooo good for peanut butter & jelly sandwiches.  Why "nearly" perfect?  Well, gluten is the "glue" that holds bread together and, when there is none, bread tends to crumble -- true for all gluten-free breads.  Pamela's ingredients, however, keep the bread moist, and crumbling to a minimum.  For another taste treat, I'd also highly recommend Pamela's wheat-free pancake mix.

review/text: I was recently diagnosed with sensitivity to wheat (the Doc stopped short of a full celiac test and diagnosis). I used to love eating bread. This product is terrific if you follow the instructions for the machine. The last loaf I made I used olive oil instead of canola. What a difference! The problem now is how to keep a loaf for a week - it gets eaten so quickly! I thoroughly recommend Pamela's Products.

review/summary: A sigh of relief
review/text: My child was re-diagnosed with a gluten allergy a few months ago.  I had went through changing his diet when he was an infant/toddler, but I knew that doing it again as a six year old was going to be more difficult.  It is important to note that my child also has Aspergers; so change for him has been difficult.<br />I, like any other mother, frantically searched to find foods that my child could and would eat.  I am embarrassed to tell you how much I spent on breads alone.  I couldn't find any that he would eat. After resolving that we just wouldn't eat anything similar to bread, I stumbled on this mix in a different health food store.  I have been familiar with Pamela's products and recommend their products to anyone who hasn't tried them.  I was amazed by the outcome.  This bread has great texture, looks like the real deal, and a taste that rallies the real deal as well.  Amazon.com also has the best price if you use its free super saver shipping.  HIghly recommend

review/text: This is by far the best Gluten-Free, milk-free bread I've had since going GF. It's easiest to bake in a bread maker; however, I have been very successful baking it in an oven (I had never made bread before).<br /><br />This bread does NOT need to be toasted!<br /><br />This is so good that I serve it to friends and family. In fact, I now make it for my church and they serve it to everyone for Communion. We tried many different kinds for Communion and this is the only one that has received approval from the congregation.<br /><br />Tip: use warm or hot water.<br /><br />Note: The way I make it, the bread is free from seven of the eight major allergens (gluten, milk, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish). In theory it can be egg-free also if you use an egg replacer, but I haven't tried that. To get it soy-free, I use canola oil.

review/text: We've been using this bread mix for about a year, as it's the best gluten-free bread mix I've found.  I usually make the sweet bread and it's very good, although it would make a great savory bread with herbs as well.  I didn't even think to try to make pizza crust with it, as we were using a mix specifically for pizza crust from another popular gluten-free brand, which I didn't really like (too light and thick like a deep dish, but without flavor).  I just tried Pamela's bread mix for pizza crust and it was amazing.  Not too thick and a bit chewy just like "real" pizza crust.  I did add the italian spices which are optional but suggested in the directions, and it was wonderful.  The first decent pizza we've had since we've been gluten-free!

review/summary: It does make an AMAZING bread !!!
review/text: This past December my 7-year old son was diagnosed with allergic to wheat. This is a little guy that LOVES bread !!! He is also allergic to dairy. So, I searched and tried many kinds of wheat free bread mix/recipes and he might eat 2 bites and then stopped with sad face or he would cry. He said "it's yucky, grainy, tasted bad...". I often hid my tears, 'cause I knew I needed to be strong for him. Once I even ordered a bread from a bakery chef, $6.50/loaf, and my son took one bite and that's it!<br /><br />Then in June I checked out Amazon, and found this product. The review said it's moist and not grainy, and I was so desperate, so I ordered a box of 6! That ended my search!!<br /><br />When I put the 1st loaf on the dining table, my son could not stop eating it (and of course, I cried secretly in the kitchen!). I also ordered the cake mix, and chocolate chip cookies mix. I can't express how thankful I am to see my son's bright eyes as he enjoys his bread. By the way, I like it too. Thank you to the people that make Pamela's Products !!!!

review/summary: Good texture, flat flavor
review/text: I had high hopes for this gluten-free bread mix, and although it had many good qualities, I probably wouldn't buy it again because I didn't care for the flavor. I made it in my breadmaker and it rose nicely and held its shape reasonably well after I took it out of the machine. I let the bread cool before I cut it as all gluten free bread can fall if cut while hot, and the bread sliced very well. Each individual slice had a spongy, soft bread texture. Actually it was almost a little TOO soft for me, but those who like soft bread might enjoy it. I cut a slice and put margarine and honey on it, expecting to have a tasty bite of fresh bread- but something about the flavor bothered me, and I had difficulty enjoying it. I have had almost every kind of gluten-free bread on the market and have been gluten free for a long time, but I don't know how I feel about this new Sorghum craze. Although it yields decent nutritional value and good texture, similarly to bean flour, if there is too high of a ratio of sorghum to neutral flours (White rice, tapioca, etc.) I think that the flavor is negatively impacted. I prefer a more subtle mix, like Bette Hagman's four flour blend, which has less sorghum and thus gets the good qualities of the flour without negatively impacting flavor. I toasted the bread for sandwiches for a few days and my husband ate it without complaint (he is not gluten-free), but because I didn't like the bread and it reminded me a little of playdough, I don't think I'll buy it again. My entirely subjective opinion aside, if you are looking for an easy gluten-free bread mix for your machine, I would recommend that you try this mix, because only trial and error will help you find a bread mix that suits your palate. I prefer homemade bean flour blends, Bob's red Mill GF bread, or The gluten free Pantry's favorite sandwich bread, but you may find this mix fits the bill perfectly!<br /><br />One other note- Most of the 99 reviews listed for this item are actually NOT for this specific mix- they are for the full spectrum of Pamela's products on Amazon. So, while people like this mix- 99+ people have not (yet) rated this item.

review/summary: Yay Bread!
review/text: I discovered that I was gluten-intolerant about a year ago and have been looking for good-tasting wheat-free products ever since.  My primary roadblock has been bread - every single loaf of gluten-free bread I've tried has been beyond disgusting.  I've been to health food store after health food store and haven't found a single loaf that I can eat without gagging.  I thought it was hopeless until I read the reviews of Pamela's Amazing Wheat-Free Bread Mix.  I decided to give it a shot, so I borrowed my sister-in-law's bread machine and fired up a loaf.<br /><br />Simply put, I was amazed at the results.  Does it taste like regular bread?  No.  Well, almost.  Is it light-years beyond any other gluten-free breads?  A hearty, resounding YES!  If you've eaten other gluten-free (GF) breads before, let me give you a comparison: it holds up better than pre-made GF bread, but it still feels like it could fall apart easily.  Putting a slice in the toaster helps with that.  It's a little on the chewy side.  It tastes like it doesn't have any salt in it, so adding some butter really helps.  It kind of looks like banana bread, if I were to compare textures.  Make sure to have some milk on-hand because it makes you pretty thirsty when you eat it!<br /><br />I would say this is 90% - 95% as good as "real" bread.  Thank goodness, my search for wheat-free bread is over!  And Amazon sells it for nearly half the price as my local health food stores!  If you're the only gluten-intolerant or Celiac in your family, I would recommend picking up a bread machine.  It makes one loaf automatically.  All I did was to follow the direction on the package and the loaf came out perfectly.  It was as simple as dumping the ingredients in the machine, making sure the settings were right, and hitting the "On" button.  So easy, even a caveman could do it!  I put the bread machine to work at about 9pm at night and woke up the next morning to freshly-baked GLUTEN-FREE bread.  EDIBLE bread.  Awesome!  I used a older Zojirushi machine, but some of the newer models like from Breadman actually have a Gluten-Free setting on them.  There is hope for decent-tasting bread for us gluten-intolerant people!  THANK YOU Pamela's Products!!

review/summary: An excellent GF bread mix
review/text: Gluten free bread mixes are often disappointing. They come out too dry, don't have a good flavor, fall apart when used for sandwiches. But Pamela's Bread Mix tastes good, has a good texture, and doesn't have to be toasted to be enjoyed. It makes great sandwiches, and the several variations offered on the bag make for a nice variety of breads. My husband especially favors the cinnamon bread for breakfast. As a sandwich bread he really enjoys the plain bread recipe with about 1/3 cup of added sesame seeds in the batter and extra sprinkled on top. Since we found this mix we have stopped experimenting with the various GF recipes we have collected. It does it all and is easy to make.

review/summary: best bread mix on the market
review/text: I have been using this mix for about 8 months now. It makes all types of incredibly good breads. I throw in all sorts of things such as nuts, cranberries, raisons, etc for variations. I have added ground almonds or peanuts for a hearty filling bread. I have purchased and tried about 20 other mixes and many were inedible so it was such a treat to find this mix. I set my bread maker for just plain white bread. I do not use the gluten free setting since the white bread setting gives me the best bread.

review/summary: Pamela's Wheat -Free Amazing Bread mix
review/text: This makes unusually good bread that is bendable and chewy and a hint of sweetness probaby from the sorghum grain they use.  It makes really good, "normal" pizza crust and flatbread too. My favorite GF mix. Also dairy free.
