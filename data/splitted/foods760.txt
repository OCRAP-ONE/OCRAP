review/summary: Almost too good
review/text: I have two mini schnauzers. One is super picky and doesn't generally like chews. The other one will go ape over them. This is the first chew that I've found where both dogs really enjoy it, right down to the nubs... I don't know what is in the center, but it must be really good. Unfortunately, I probably won't be ordering them again. The problem is, the super picky dog has decided she really likes the bone and she will snarf it down, then attack the other dog as she's working on her bone. They're not safe without a lot of supervision, to keep fights from breaking loose. The bones do keep my dogs occupied for several hours, but beware that they must be amazing--if it causes my two pups to break into a fight.

review/text: My dog LOVES these.  He takes days to work his way through one.  I don't think they are messy, like other reviewers thought.  He eats up any pieces that fall off.  I got these through Amazon, for a good price.  There are a lot of chewnolas in the box, and they may last him half a year at the rate he chews them up.  He is a small size sheltie, and they are a good size for him.  Any larger would be too large.

review/text: These Chewnola's are the only product I have found that is worth giving my dogs. I have two Timberwolf breed dogs that chew through everything in a matter of seconds that I have given them. These treats will last around 30 minutes. Also, they are healthier then other choices. It is more expensive for this product. But I find it well worth it.

review/summary: First one star ever sorry
review/text: I have a 10 month old Weimaraner that loved the Regular Busy Bone Chewbone threat so I thought I would give the Chewnola Dog Treats a try thinking it would be even better. He took it right away when I gave it to him and chewed on it for about 2 minutes then left it alone. He will eat if it is the only choice he left it laying in the living room and went and got one of his rawhide bones. I gave it to him yesterday and you can barley tell he has eaten any.  There is only a little granola missing. I am starting to think he scratched the granola off. I don't think he likes the texture of the granola because it is a little sharp. This morning he was soaking it in his water bowl then eating it and it looks like he likes it a little better now that it is slimy, softer, and less sharp. I will not be getting this type again I now have a sticky mess to clean up.

review/text: Great product!  I buy them by the box because my two Belgian Sheepdogs LOVE them!  I think smaller dogs would be entertained for quite awhile with the Busy Bones, but my Belgians are only entertained for about 10 minutes before they have inhaled them.  I only give them out about 1-2 times weekly to make sure they get completely digested before the next round, but my dogs can't wait until the next time they get them.

review/summary: Unique tasting water
review/text: After reading reviews and comparisons of mineral waters I decided to try this one.  I ordered Badoit in the 750ml glass bottle size from a local distributor in S. Florida.  Price was approx. $3 per 750ml bottle and the case had 12 bottles. It comes with a crown cap so you must have a cork handy to seal it back and preserve its natural carbonation, unless you plan to finish the bottle right away.  The TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) is approx. 1200 mg/lt so it ranks as a High Mineral water which is good.  Although there are other waters with 3000 or more, many times a big part of their TDS is sodium. The opposite end would be distilled water which leaches the human body from its store of minerals - very harmful.<br />Badoit has a good amount of Bicarbonate at 1300 mg/lt and it has a PH of 6 both of which are considered to aid digestion.<br />The main charactestics of this water are that it has i) natural carbonation, ii) the bubbles are indeed mild (compared to say Perrier where the first two gulps hit even your nostrils with gas) and iii) it has a unique almost herbal aftertaste, so, unlike other waters you could never mistake it for any other brand.<br />If price is not an issue go for it.  Another excellent choice is Gerolsteiner also comes in 750ml glass bottles with its own carbonation and a good taste. It has a little higher Bicarbonate and TDS than the Badoit but you might miss the Badoit's unique taste.<br />Avoid San Pellegrino and Perrier as they both have very low Bicarbonate and Perrier has very low TDS as well.

Otherwise, this is a reputable company, with safe, fast delivery, and they are highly recommended.

review/text: I think this is the best carbonated water ever.  I became addicted to it while spending a summer in France... and I still am!  There's a store in NY that sells this water, and another one in Washington DC.  Can anyone relate to the pain of seeing this water for sale in a store and not being able to take any with because of the TSA regulations?  It really hurts.  I don't know if I'll ever order it by mail, but I'll keep looking for it in the store of the Chicago area.

review/text: I really like my bottled waters - and Badoit is at the top, the best by far.  Where most carbonated waters are slightly hard with "big" bubbles, Badoit has a much softer feel on the palette and the carbonation is not as overpowering - (smaller bubbles) and the effect is awesome.  Taste is great and the overall experience is highly refreshing.<br /><br />If you have the money to spare, I highly recommend!

review/text: Badoit is refreshing and has delightfully small bubbles. Is it worth this much money? Well, writing from Paris, where Badoit is cheap and plentiful, people seem to like Perrier and San Pellegrino just fine. Given that home carbonation can make perfectly good soda for very little money, I would have to suggest saving your hard-earned cash for a decent bottle of wine.

review/summary: Excellent chestnuts available in the US
review/text: Briefly, I agree entirely with the previous reviewer.  I have tried a few sources of fresh chestnuts and several brands and types of peeled chestnuts (in water, in syrup, dry, etc.) and none comes close to Clement Faugier's, whether one uses them to make turkey stuffing, chestnuts in syrup, marrons glaces, or in other productions.  I have been buying these marrons for well over a decade, and this is a very good price for them.

review/summary: The best chesnuts of all!
review/text: These French chestnuts are the best type to use for baking and as stuffing. They have a very pure flavor and are subtle enough for desserts. I have tried all other types of chestnuts, but these are the best. Italian fresh chestnuts ( which are available fresh in my grocery store) are smaller and have a less sophisticated and subtle flavor. The difference is akin to that between a California Red Zinfandel and an aged, French Bordeaux. If I lived in France, I would use fresh Chestnuts, otherwise- I use only the Clement Faugier brand. ( NOTE: these chestnuts are in water, not sugar syrup. Be careful when you buy canned chestnuts, many come in a syrup which is not at all suitable for some dishes.)<br /><br />This order was received within a few days of ordering and was very well-packed.

review/text: While the transaction with the vendor purchased from was perfect I was disappointed in the taste of this product.  I'm not sure what I expected, maybe a little firmer of a chestnut?  I was going to put these in my Thanksgiving stuffing but didn't as I thought the whole thing would turn into a mushy paste in the middle of my delicious bread so I left them out.  I only opened one can - now I have another can and I don't know what I'm going to do with it.  My mistake, but if you are expecting a firm texture you won't get it with this product.

It's a 6-pack of 25g bags, 150g TOTAL<br /><br />So you're getting about the equivalent of one bag of chips for your money. Still, not a terrible deal for something a little exotic.<br /><br />The chips themselves were good, though!

review/summary: "Jar" Description Fooled Me
review/text: This was not what I thought that I had ordered.  When I read "24 oz. Jar" I assumed that these were shelled and in a brine liquid.  These were just dried fava beans and required a lot of work to prepare.  I must say that if the dried beans were what you were looking for, they were good.

review/summary: Smoky Russian Caravan Tea
review/text: I ordered this tea as a substitute for Twining's Russian Caravan Tea<br />which is no longer available. This one turned out to be excessively<br />smoky, masking the richness of the Assam Black tea that it is made<br />with.  I will need to blend it with an equal amount of some other<br />tea to make it enjoyable, I hope.

review/summary: Bear loves Bravo
review/text: My high drive dobe becomes Mr. Perfect when he gets a whiff of the Bravo Freeze dried venison liver, buffalo liver and trail mix buffalo bites.  They seem a bit pricey per ounce but there are plenty of pieces.  More importantly, this is a high quality product -- no fillers or non-essential ingredients.  These Bravo products are easy to carry on walks or for training -- not greasy or crumbly so can just put a handful in my pocket w/out having to wear a treat bag.  I don't like the dry roasted venison liver -- very hard and the pieces have spikey edges that I didn't like.

review/text: I bought this as a gift.  It was much nicer than the Bentley's tea box I have.  It has a higher quality wood finish, is heavier, and has better hinges.  The hinges are especially important so the top stays open, but doesn't flop backwards.  After about three months, the hinges on my Bentley's box were pretty much shot.  I would buy the Bigelow box again.

review/summary: You'll love this one!
review/text: I was looking for a great tea box for my girlfriend as we were coming up on a special day in our lives, and I came across this one. I read all the reviews, and compared it to just about every other tea box out there and finally decided that this was the one. Bigelow is her favorite brand of tea, plus its gluten free, and I knew the slots would be plenty big enough for other brand tea bags to fit in as well. The fact that it comes STOCKED FULL of tea bags was an awesome add-on! (I was plannin on stocking it myself an this saved me a lot of time and money too!)<br />The price is very reasonable, and soooo worth it!<br />It arrived within two days and was packaged VERY VERY well. It was even better than I thought it would be!<br />When I presented her with this gift, she absolutely LOVED it and could hardly wait to tell the family and all her friends/coworkers...she uses this all the time, she LOVES IT! LOVES the variety of tea flavors (so many new ones that we didn't even know were out there), and we both highly recommend this tea box to others looking for something just as great :)

review/text: This honey is addictive. I was reminded of caramel when I first tried it -- it was enticingly sweet and ended in a licorice flavor, which I wasn't too fond of (because I hate licorice) until I continued to use it in my tea.<br /><br />As it turns out, it is addictive and I prefer it over my other raw organic honeys. It has to be that caramel note. This honey is decadent and definitely gourmet -- if you want something natural that tastes like a dessert, then this is it.<br /><br />The only downside is the lid to the glass jar. There is a 'food liner' underneath the lid. If you're familiar with Ball jars, they have a plastic layer on the underside of the aluminum lid that contains BPA. It's the same with this lid.<br /><br />I emailed Heavenly Organics and asked them if it contains BPA. They have not replied and it's been about a week.<br /><br />I planned to buy from their website because I'll save nearly fifty dollars by buying a case directly from their website. However, if they don't reply I'll just be spending my money on something else.<br /><br />Also, if you're easily offended by little specks of 'whatever' in raw honey, you might not want to order this. There's lots of debris in the jar that made me think the bees were harmed in the process of harvesting. I checked the website and they have a video that shows how the honey is harvested and I think they're trying their best not to harm the bees. This is obviously unfiltered but I have absolutely no problem with it.<br /><br />I think it is a big deal to buy from companies that treat the bees with respect and avoid the ones who are careless and harm the bees. I'm not 100% sure about this one, since the video is showing how most honey in India is harvested and isn't showing a video of this one particular company's methods, but their website suggests that they are very careful and pride themselves on how they treat animals with care and respect. I trust them enough.<br /><br />They have two other types of honey for sell on their website that I really want to try, but first I need to know about those lids.<br /><br />**Update 20/08/12<br />They replied to my email and confirmed that the lids DO contain BPA.<br /><br />"I apologize for the delay in response.<br /><br />The closures from Techno Cap have BPA in the plastisol liner. The information I have<br />is that the BPA is an under coating in the plastisol liner and doesn't come in direct contact<br />with the packaged product. They also point out that the process to manufacture the closures and<br />the process to manufacture polycarbonate bottles are completely different. Apparently they have<br />tested these liners in Europe where the standards are very stringent. They have ruled them safe<br />as regards to BPA."<br /><br />Plastisol contains "PVC." PVC is worse for your health than BPA. It is in NO WAY healthier than BPA. I asked another company recently what their food liner consists of and I got the same answer. The coat that comes into contact with your food is plastisol, and beneath the plastisol is the layer that contains BPA. I'm going to avoid these types of lids from now on since they all seem to be lined in plastisol.<br /><br />I would pay more for this product if they would use a safer lid. It's about fifty-three bucks including shipping for a case of honey from their website and I would throw twenty more dollars at them if they'd use safer lids. BPA and PVC in lids makes it hard for an organic buyer to find a product that is truly organic.<br /><br />Organic honey with BPA and PVC free packaging:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK08OC">Certified Organic Manuka</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Y3ZECM">Really Raw Honey, 1 X 16 Oz</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OMJWXU">Wee Bee Naturally Raw Honey -- 1 lb Each</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BC740A">Hnz Organic Clover Honey, 1.1PoundsJar</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H89EWK">Himalaya Herbal Healthcare - Soliga Forest Organic Honey, 8.8 oz gel</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006GV6O34">Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Raw Honey, 16oz</a>

review/summary: I'm a Tully's Fan! The House Blend Is Becoming One Of My Favorites.
review/text: If we had a 'I'm A Fan' button to push, I would definitely be a fan of Tully's K-cups.<br /><br />Usually I drink lots of Tully's French and/or Kona, and Italian is a new favorite that I know I'll be drinking now that I've tried it.<br /><br />When I think of Tully's Coffee House Blend, I think of going into a restaurant and smelling that wonderful aroma of freshly-made coffee. It tastes delicious!<br /><br />At first I didn't think of it as one of my all-time favorites, because it's just an excellent cup of coffee. Good flavor and aroma, not too dark, not too strong, not too bitter, just delicious. I just came back to edit this review and say that it is becoming one of my all-time favorites, just another great option from Tully's.<br /><br />I used to say that I like to keep it around to drink after I've burned out my taste buds on stronger blends and want to calm my taste buds down a little. Now I've found that I enjoy it pretty much any time.<br /><br />One thing I would say about Coffee House Blend is that it will probably please more people in a household or guests visiting than my all-time favorites, which are way too strong for many people. This is a good choice to please more people. It should please just about everyone!<br /><br />EDITED once more. I came back later to say that with all of my other K-Cup options available to me, I keep reaching for the Tully's House Blend. I don't know if it's just a mood I'm in right now or what, but the others just seem like they are trying too hard. Whatever the reason, I'm enjoying House Blend.<br /><br />EDITED still once more to say now my favorites are House and Italian, both Tully's. It's the best!

review/summary: Bold But Not Extra Bold.  Smooth, Flavorful & Not Bitter..
review/text: Tully's House Blend falls squarely into the Bold category, but it is definitely not an Extra Bold coffee.  It is smooth, flavorful and does not have a bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />**** For those medium blend coffee drinkers, this blend may be too strong.  For those that like a jolt in the morning, this coffee may not be bold enough. ****<br /><br />This blend, taste-wise, is not quite as full-bodied as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M62D5S">Tully's Italian Roast, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> yet it is bolder than the Kona blends, which are no longer available.  I also find that it has a just a little more kick than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0GVA4">Timothy's World Coffee, San Lorenzo Dark, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>, which is one of my favorite blends to-date.

review/summary: Great coffee, excellent price
review/text: I've been drinking the Tully's House Blend K-Cup coffee for a few years now. I occasionally buy a different variety just to try it out, but always find myself wanting the Tully's more. I have to admit, I do like the new Starbucks K-cups, but they are almost as expensive as going to a Starbucks and buying coffee there, so I'll stick with my Tully's. I find the blend to be just the right mixture of smooth and bold. I can use a single K-cup twice to fill my 16 oz to-go mug and find that it's still strong enough.

review/summary: Full of Rich Flavor
review/text: I've been drinking bold flavors such as Timothy's Rain Forest Expresso and Coffee People's Wake Up Call but have grown tired of the somewhat chalky taste of both.  I recently tried Tully's Kona Blend and it's good but expensive and not available via the "Subscribe and Save" program.  So I took a chance on their House Blend and like it even better than the Kona Blend!  It's a "Bold"<br />K-cup so contains enough coffee to make the larger size cup without it's being weak and the flavor is nice and rich without being bitter or chalky-tasting.  It's my new favorite K-cup!!!

review/text: I first tasted this at my uncle's house on Christmas morning, after he got a Keurig and hooked it up for everyone's enjoyment.<br /><br />I can say without a doubt, that this is the best coffee I have ever tasted. It's absolutely *perfectly* balanced, without a hint of bitterness. Just smooth as silk, it's the kind of coffee that makes you take a sip, curl up in your chair and sigh in satisfaction at the taste. This coffee is actually prompting me to buy a Keurig of my own now, and this will be the very first blend that will go in it.

review/summary: Simply the best K cup out there
review/text: I have been thru them all and Tully's simply makes the best K cups out there. The house blend is great, breakfast blend as well and the hard to find Kona is in a class by itself. Better than Green Mountain, Timothy's, Gloria Jean and Newman's Own. They simply use better coffee beans and the cups are all very consistent. All of their coffees are "Bold" (even the breakfast blend) but the are never bitter like some other Bold varieties. The superb reviews on this brand are accurate.

review/summary: Solid Gourmet Cup of Coffee
review/text: Its just dark enough for my tastes to be brewed on the 7.25oz setting. It has a dark chocolate and brandy aroma. The house blend has a boldness falling in between a medium brew (gloria jeans hazlenut) and a lighter bold brew (newmans organic). The taste is pleasant and has notes of cocoa and malt, and an aftertaste of walnuts. I would recommend this as a keep around the house brew, but not for something to impress guests.

review/summary: Less expensive alternative to the Kona Blend
review/text: I have long been a fan of the Tully Kona Blend coffee. I was disappointed when my local retailer quit selling Kona products!<br /><br />I actually ordered this house blend by accident, thinking that I was ordering the Kona Blend. I had more than 4 cups of coffee before I noticed on the packaging that it said House Blend instead of Kona Blend. I would not have known that it was not the Kona Blend had I not seen the packaging. One caveat: I make "lattes" by adding an equal amount of steamed milk to my coffee, so the coffee flavor is probably diluted for me.  Someone drinking it straight up may notice a difference in the flavor.<br /><br />My bottom line is that it is much less expensive than the Kona Blend, due to vendor and shipping costs, and it is more than good enough for me.  I've since ordered another box.

review/summary: Starbucks is great, but Tully's is THE BEST!
review/text: Here in Seattle you can't turn around without bumping into a great coffee kiosk, but there is nothing like being able to enjoy a terrific cup of coffee first thing in the morning while still shlepping around in my slippers at home.  As a new Keurig owner, I taste-tested a variety of brands (since it was so easy to do) but my local favorite, Tully's, came out on top.  If smooth, rich, full-bodied coffee can be called comfort food, Tully's has it nailed.  Happily, Amazon shipments arrive promptly.  Yes, K-cup packs are pricey, but life is short.  Drink good coffee!

review/summary: Tully's Coffee House Blend, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)
review/text: I've always appreciated my Keurig brewer but didn't realize how much until I was away from home, no brewer and NO K-cups! I hadn't anticipated the level of 'separation anxiety' I suddenly experienced. Undaunted, I purchased a package of Tully's freshly ground coffee and returned to a conventional coffee maker.  The result was ok - :} but not really the usual great.  Then came reality.  THE GROUNDs.  What a mess! Not only totally inconvenient to measure, but annoyingly difficult to confine to the basket since they always seem to prefer the counter, the sink, the floor, anywhere but where they're supposed to be.  Then, the challenge of disposal-what a mess. Next,the mixing. TOO weak(like "stump-water" I over-heard,) TOO strong...ugh!!!! It was back to that awful trial and error period  which had been so quickly forgotten.  Oh, and don't even ask about the bottled water.  Fortunately the trip was abbreviated and I was soon re-united with my Keurig brewer and my treasured Tully's K-cups.  Lesson learned.
