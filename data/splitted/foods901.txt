review/text: This mango syrup was nothing but bad. It does not sweeten only flavors so you have to add sugar plus the syrup. I made a batch of it and the whole family wouldn't drink it. Had to dump it out and now the pretty bottle sits on a counter waiting to give it to someone who might like it. Maybe i did something wrong... dunno...

review/summary: Expiration Date
review/text: When I was checking into this product I wondered about the expiration date.  In the end, I figured it is a spice so even if it was close to the expiration date, would it matter?  Anyway, we ordered this in mid-April of 2011 & the expiration is July 30 2012.  No worries as it is over a year from now.<br /><br />Boxes look just like they do in the store.  Much, much cheaper than we would spend buying 1 box at a time locally.

review/summary: Best Scotch I ever tasted.
review/text: I actually ordered this from a local distributor and just cracked it open yesterday for a special occasion.  At $350 a bottle I am sure most have theirs locked away as an investment scotch, what a waste.  This is the best sherry cask, single malt I have ever had.  It is all 21 year old, cask strength, non-chill filtered, single malt scotch whiskey.  But it would be a mistake to judge this whiskey by its age.<br /><br />Very high alcohol content (55.6%) but drinks much smoother than their regular 21 yr. old.  The initial sip started with a heavy alcohol burn and then the flavors just flowed through.  A larger sip, held on the tongue, had an almost syrupy texture, thick and smooth.  Two online reviews differed on whether or not to use water.  I agree with the one that advocated drinking it neat, preferably at room temp.<br /><br />Will buy another ASAP for the next special occasion!  As far as I know there are only 1,823 bottles left now (bottle 398/1,824 is almost gone!), and I have dibbs on one more!

Try making a quesadilla with monterrey jack cheese and this salsa, accompanied by your beverage of choice.  We love the raspberry flavor heated by the chipotle and smoothed by the cheese.

review/summary: Good, but not much variety overall
review/text: I'm not going to comment much on the quality of the chocolate, since it's Ghirardelli-- it's good stuff, and you're probably already pretty familiar with it.<br /><br />The thing to keep in mind about this basket is that it relies very heavily on the square chocolates; the other products are an afterthought. There are four types of squares in this basket: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G0MFZQ">Milk & Caramel Filled</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G0MG14">Dark & Caramel Filled</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G0MG00">Dark & Mint Filled</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G0MG0A">Dark & Raspberry Filled</a>. (The item description claims that it also contains <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0053ZT9M2">Milk & Truffle</a>, but the basket I ordered did not have that item.)<br /><br />Besides the squares, there are also two chocolate bars: one <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H9NBA4">Dark & Caramel Bar</a> and one <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H9N9VU">Milk & Caramel Bar</a>. However, the individual "components" of these chocolate bars are exactly the same as the individual chocolate squares; they're just joined together to form something bar-shaped.<br /><br />So basically, if your intended recipient likes chocolate squares, then great! Just keep in mind that there are no solid chocolate pieces, no truffles, no nut-based chocolates, etc. All of the "solid" chocolate is just squares.<br /><br />The only non-chocolate-square product in the basket are the three individual serving packets of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H27NU6">Double Chocolate Hot Cocoa Mix</a>. It's good hot chocolate. Three packets is a very awkward number, though. It's too few for a family of four, and if the basket is for a couple, one person gets two packets and one person only gets one.<br /><br />Or you can do what my wife and I did: Have one cup of hot cocoa each, then make chocolate pancakes with the last packet of powder!<br /><br />My wife and I enjoyed this basket, but I was just a little bit disappointed at the overall lack of variety in the items and the fact that there was an odd number of hot cocoa packets.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br /><br />Pros: High-quality chocolate; pretty good variety of flavors of squares; reasonable amount of treats for the money; attractive presentation<br /><br />Cons: Not much variety overall (just square-based chocolate and some hot cocoa); amount of hot cocoa is awkward (either too much or too little for most cases)<br /><br />(If this review was helpful for you, please choose "Yes" below!)

There's a distinct taste of the fire roasting that is unique to this salsa.  It is medium-hot as advertised.  Your mouth won't be on fire.  They also make a hotter version if your tastebuds can take it.

review/summary: Feed Raw!
review/text: The previous reviewer is obviously unfamiliar with the benefits of feeding freeze dried and raw or low processed foods. Most dogs cannot easily digest kibble and those that seem to don't get all the nutrients they are meant to have. Consider living on a diet of fast food versus cooking at home with whole foods. Your pets are meant to kill, scavange and eat whole foods, NOT ultra processed kibble! Yes it is more expensive then kibble....but it is so worth it. I have a dog with chronic allergies and digestive problems, the only thing that has helped is keeping his diet as natural as possible and supplimenting with digestive enzymes and an essential fatty acid. Please don't read the previous review and dismiss the wonderful benefits of freeze dried raw diets. Do your research, then decide which food is best for your dog.

review/summary: The naysayers overstate the 'problems', and the bottom line is, this stuff WORKS. No sugar, no crash. It's true.
review/text: Alright folks, so I'm just gonna lay all my cards on the table, because that's what you're supposed to do in an honest review right? I'm terminally ill, and I mean REALLY sick. I'm fighting hard, but it's a rough time. Part of that includes loss of muscle control, which includes the bladder, etc... Sheesh! LOL I was watching a review one morning on Fox News, after having been using this stuff for awhile, where the doctor they had on just TORE the energy drink business apart. He talked about how dangerous all of them were, and untested and how they basically don't work...<br />Well I'm here to tell you otherwise. I went and got the EXACT bottle of 5 Hour Energy, Extra Strength, that I always buy, and which he was talking about. He was going on and on about how it was loaded with caffeine and was therefore bad for your heart. PLEASE! I've got the bottle IN MY HANDS right now folks. It states right on it, and this is the extra strength mind you, that it contains caffeine comprable to 12 oz. cup of coffee. That's not much! And yes, he was right that most of them work by being LOADED with sugar to go with the caffeine, and come with a REALLY bad crash afterwards. I experimented with some of the other products, and they taste delicious, but come with an AWFUL crash. This stuff doesn't taste so great because it has NO SUGAR, but it's just a tiny shot, and it works dammit.<br />And then the doctor told the audience that it stimulates the nerves, and has been shown to cause nerve damage. I literally did a spit take. I was HORRIFIED. But low and behold, I talked to my own team of FIVE Neurologists that work on my case, and they disagreed. They said that a lot of the other drinks are unhealthy, diet-wise. This stuff causes what is called a Niacin Flush, and most of the energetic affects are from megadoses of vitamins. My Neurologists said that this stuff wasn't going to be hurting me, and at worst just might not work.<br />But it DOES WORK! As I mentioned, I'm very sick. And that includes days when I am so weak I can't get out of bed or my chair. When I'm having nerve spasms, and can't control my muscles, I will sometimes have accidents when I fall asleep. I know the feeling well enough now to know, without doubt, when it will happen. Come on folks, I just admitted something really personal, and you can't get much more down in the dirt than that. LOL So when I feel that feeling, but am also really tired, I will drink one of these. It will keep me up and focused, and most importantly accident free, for between 3 and 5 hours while my nerve medications can kick in. And as those of us who have these problems can attest, that peace of mind, that time that is bought for us, ANYTHING to not make us incontinent if we can help it, is worth a LOT. Certainly the price of these little gems.<br />The drink wakes me up, and it does NOT give me the jitters or make me edgy. I do not feel overwhelmed or hyper. It simply gives me the energy to get through my rough patch without falling asleep and waking up in a mess. LOL<br />If there is one downside to this, it's the price. But I ask you this... How many of us are Starbuck's or expensive coffee fanatics? I was for YEARS. And we buy those mostly to help us to stay alert and awake through our day, and also because they are delicious. LOL These cost, per bottle, less than a Venti coffee. And seriously, they work. And that's what they are advertised to do, and that's JUST what they do. And that's all I NEED them to do. Not every product out there does what it says it will do. So that's a boost in my book right off the bat.<br />I thank you for your time folks. Give these a try if you were needing a safe and least minimally harmful boost to your day during the more tired moments that we ALL have. I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br />Sincerely, R.A. McDowell

I dont feel they work as well if your drinking one before a workout or if you have to do manual labor. I think overall great product! I just bought 50 a few weeks ago!

review/text: My Grandchildren love these Necco Wafers in Chocolate.  They remind me of the ones I used to get when I was a child, only there was just the multi-flavored ones at that time.  Sure, there were a few broken wafers in some of the packages, but that can happen to any kind of candy (or anything else) that is breakable.  Will be sure to remember where I got these so the grandchildren and I can enjoy these Wafers for a long time to come.

review/text: I inadvertently stumbled on to these chips while looking to purchase Avocado oil and I'm so glad I did.  Most companies label their potato ships as "Natural" which is bunch of hooey - and even if they actually start with truly natural ingredients - most oils become damaged when heated and Avocado oil has one the highest smoke points when it comes to oils.<br /><br />They taste GREAT - I only wish they came in larger bags and:<br /><br />AMAZON PLEASE PUT THESE ON SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE!  The olive oil version is so I don't know why these aren't.

review/text: Good Health Avocado chips with light sea salt are fantastic!  These chips are available in health food grocery stores, but they cost much less if you buy them here.  My dad doesn't like avocado and he's a very picky eater, but he even loves these chips -- and only three ingredients -- potatoes, avocado oil, and light sea salt.  If you're trying to eat healthy, but love a good chip, these are the chips for you.  I've also tried the sweet potato chips from this company and they are good if you like sweet potato chips. Love these chips!

review/summary: Good taste and healthy too
review/text: Found these at TJMaxx and liked them and wanted more.  Glad to find them available at Amazon, so I ordered a box of 12 5-oz bags.  They arrived in short order and have a long outdate - Jan 2012 - and come tightly packed with lots of air in the bag to keep them from getting crushed.  The amount of salt is low - 100 mg per serving - which brings up the challenge, limiting your consumption.  I like the smaller size bag - reminds me to eat less and also takes up less space.  Baked potato chips is another option for lowering the saturated fat but they are expensive and they don't go on sale very often.

review/summary: Agree; Best Chips I've Ever Had; Uber High in Vitamin C
review/text: I am an instant convert.  I would never purchase any other chips but these.<br /><br />The 12-pack of 5-oz bags shipped in a carton-inside-a-carton, arriving in great condition.  The chip bags are a sturdy plastic, and all chips appear to be in good condition.  Notably, these appear to have hardly any broken chips.<br /><br />A 1-oz. serving has only 140 calories, and 40% of your daily Vitamin C!  If eating only 1/5 of a bag of chips sounds unlikely to you, it's possible you could do it with these, since they are rich and leave you feeling sated.  I think that is because these are real food, rather than junk food.<br /><br />The individual chips roughly average 2 inches in diameter, some of them being folded in various shapes, and some flat.  The chip size is much more consistent than you usually see.  It's hard to tell, but I think these are unpeeled potatoes, of the variety that has a light-toned skin.  They are definitely thin chips, but I would say they are slightly thicker than Lay's potato chips.  The sea salt is used in balanced proportion, and adds nice flavor.  The avocado oil lends a very tasty, extremely subtle flavor that hints of citrus and fruitiness.  However, don't get me wrong - these don't taste fruity or sweet; they taste like regular potato chips.  They just have what I'd describe as a more sophisticated complexity in their simplicity.

review/text: Potatoes are good, bad, or somewhere in between.<br /><br />These are very good. They will endanger diets all over the country - if not the world. Delicate, compared with most "kettle" chips - not teethbreakers. Most from small potatoes, a few from medium-sized, and the slices are thin and will sometimes fold in the cooking process. Most will fold when the diameter is above 1.5", and when they fold, there is more oil.<br /><br />They are a hazard. And a luxury.

review/text: I was hopeful when I tried these cinnamon apple slices since I like dried fruit, and thought they would make a good snack.  They have a good cinnamon taste, but are too sugary sweet.  There is a oversweet aftertaste that overpowers the apple taste.  They could use a whole lot less sugar and dextrose in the formula, and have a tastier and better for you snack.  I don't like them, and my kids do not like them.  Sorry to say that I will not order this product again.

Since I have a gluten intolerant family member, I don't like spreading cracker dust around the kitchen counters.<br /><br />4 instead of 5 stars because I don't think they taste exactly the same as Seedlander flatbreads. Maybe it's my imagination? Maybe it's this production batch?<br /><br />Cost: When I compared per ounce (these have less weight per box than flatbreads) their price seemed favorable.<br /><br />I do appreciate the convenience of being cracker sized. Overall, I'm glad I purchased them.

Thanks to Amazon for great service, and to Kellogg's for still making them!!!  Any chance of coming back with strawberry, cherry, and apricot flavored in unfrosted too???  Perhaps an ad campaign noting the lower sugar content (and therefor a bit healtier) alternative while still being delicious!

review/text: These blueberry unfrosted Pop-Tarts are just awesome.  I don't like the frosted ones anymore and also most of the other flavors are fakey tasting and just plain awful.  But this mainstay blueberry unfrosted is really great.  I recently set my toaster for a longer toasting period of time and noticed when I put in the Pop-Tarts it was even yummier when it has a light brown toasting on it (but never near to burning).  When it is toasted to perfection, it seriously tastes almost comparable to a homemade blueberry pie out of the oven (which, no, I do not make).  One of the best buys I have ever done was buy this particular Pop-Tart on Amazon, because there really are no retail stores that carry unfrosted anymore.

review/text: I have bought Blueberry Pop-Tarts from Amazon twice now.  This was my first purchase from AMAZON and I found it to be so easy to order from them.  My husband loves pop-tarts, but he doesn't like them frosted because that is too much sugar.  I can only find the strawberry in the stores, but his favorite is blueberry.  The closest store that come up on the internet that carried them was a mile from my home; however when I went to get them, there were none.  I asked to have a case held for me when they came in, and after three months, I figured I'd never get them.  The next store was 75 miles away.  So I tried Amazon.  Very easy shopping.  My husband is happy, and we share them with our son's family.  Hope they keep carrying the NOT FROSTED pastries.

I'm glad I don't need to convince you.  When you describe one to an uninitiated friend they just don't believe how good they are.  And they look at you funny.<br /><br />Like me, have you become discouraged by the decreasing availability of your favorite food at the grocery store?  They've been crowded out by a hundred varieties of frosted Pop-Tart and boxes of sadly generic, doughy imitations.  Don't despair--You've just hit the mother load that will feed you until the end of your days.<br /><br />These are real, live Kellogg's Pop-Tarts shipped straight from the factory.  They are fresh and delicious.  And they are delivered right to your door.  Don't forget to call in sick the day they arrive.  Not only can you get them next day air, but you can actually subscribe with your credit card and they just keep coming.  Forever.<br /><br />Life just doesn't get better than this.

review/text: Why is it so hard to find unfrosted plain Pop-Tarts in stores nowadays?  Is everybody so sugar-addicted that they have to have their processed cardboard covered in a hardened glaze of frosting?  Actually unfrosted Pop-Tarts can be made much more delicious and even more non-nutritious if you toast them in a toaster oven slathered with butter, so that it sinks down into the tiny holes on top. Yum!  Truth be told, my husband must have Pop-Tarts for breakfast, period.  At least on Amazon, they can be found in the traditional, unfrosted form--so we became subscribers.  Keep those plain, fruit-filled treats coming!  I'm still waiting to see my husband dance for joy like the cartoon kids on the TV commercial, but so far, nothing yet!

Subscribe and Save is something of a life-saver, allowing us to have my husband's favorite breakfast on hand almost all of the time.

review/summary: unfrosted blueberry ....at last I have found you!!!
review/text: We haven't had unfrosted blueberry pop-tarts in the Chicagoland area for at least 10 years.  For a while there were places to order them and then they too dried up.  I tried off and on since, even writing to Kellogg's, to find them...but it appeared they simply weren't made any more.  oh the despair!  My lover was especially hit hard by this turn of events as she doesn't care for any of the frosted versions.  She was lamenting the loss yet again last month when I decided to search the web again.<br />Imagine my surprise and joy when I discovered them here!  I kept it a secret, ordered a case, and the look on her face when they arrived was, as they say, priceless.

review/text: these are very delicious but they are not my favorite one i have to tell you. i like all of the unfrosted ones alot. i will have no problem devouring these blueberry ones in the coming weeks. the price was great and i love getting them delivered right to my house. subscribe is sure the way to go and always watch for sale prices. i have had very little damage to any pop tart since i started buying them but it could happen. they are fresh and delicious. i like to put mine in the toaster and get them lightly toasted so that they are crispy and delicious. i love the pastry crust.

review/summary: Simple breakfast
review/text: As other reviewers have noted, these are difficult to find out in supermarket land, so I'm grateful Amazon is carrying them. The Subscribe & Save price is the best I've seen. The Pop Tarts generally arrived in good condition. If I have any complaint about crushed or broken Pop Tarts, I blame those who shipped the box. It's a sturdy box and it would take a lot of rough handling to damage the Pop Tarts inside. It happens. Doesn't make the Pop Tarts taste any differently.<br /><br />It's true, high fructose corn syrup is the third ingredient listed on the package. Since when did any of us consider Pop Tarts "healthy" anyway? I eat them because I like the taste and they're easy to prepare when I want a light breakfast. I wash them down with a cup of hot tea and I'm ready to get on with my day and the kitchen isn't a mess. Let's face it, there is no way to make Pop Tarts "good for you" but unless someone intends to sit down and scarf up the entire box in one sitting, and I don't do that, I haven't found they're all that bad for me either. Enjoy!

review/summary: Has zero basil flavor and tastes burned
review/text: I have never purchased spices online in my life. I've always had great service from Amazon and thought I would buy this product.  It was labeled as sweet, certified organic. First of all, it is not sweet. When added to tomato sauce a bitter after taste results on the tongue that does not go away. It barely smells like basil, it's bitter, and by itself, just placed on the tongue, tasted burned. I am not sure that even if it was not burned it would taste like basil. There is something off that goes beyond whether or not the basil burned in the drying process. Further, the leaves don't look burned or different than basil would generally look. The only way to tell that something is wrong is by noticing that the basil smell is very weak, that there is no basil flavor, and that using this product in sauce caused all the other ingredients to take on a bitter taste.  Even my husband, whose taste is off to begin with, said the product was flavorless. And because I opened the product and used it, I am not sure what to do about returning it. I've contacted Amazon and will wait and see what they say and will add more to this post depending on their response.  It doesn't seem enough to simply give me a refund. This basil was part of a larger batch and I can't see how they can continue to sell the existing items. It seems as if the entire batch/lot should be pulled.

I feel great since I have been using this product. I can't really be sure if it is due to the royal jelly, but if it's not then what an awfully strange coincidence.

review/summary: Rice Is Nice But Couscous Is Better
review/text: Israeli couscous was developed during an austerity period in Israel, when rice was scarce. It is a combination of seminola and wheat flour. Israeli couscous are small, round, pasta-like granules, and is twice as big and is toasted rather than dried. This gives it a nutty flavor and a sturdy composition that gives it a chewy bite and makes it stand up to sauce.<br /><br />Israeli couscous has become a real favorite in my house. It is easy to prepare and can be mixed with so many other food items.<br />Israeli couscous is like an entirely different food. It plumps up into luscious individual pearls that pop in your mouth. It is much different than regular couscous, so be prepared for a treat!  If you're not familiar but wanting to try it, you can buy Israeli couscous at Amazon!<br /><br />I like to use chicken or vegetable broth in Israeli couscous, it gives the couscous an almost creamy, hefty base. Mix it with pine nuts and parsley or whatever herbs you like best. This couscous is so luscious and now takes the place of other grains or other pastas.<br /><br />Highly Recommended prisrob 02-27-12

review/summary: Excellent ginger, excellent service
review/text: Chimes ginger is the best ginger candy I've ever tasted, that's why I bought it!  I had a sample of a ginger chew a month ago and I liked it so much I tracked down the company and found a distributor that sold it in larger quantities.  I bought a pound which is a good amount for me, the little bags don't hold enough.  This product is really fresh, it's made with real, natural ginger root, sounds shocking but it's true, and it tastes delicious.  You can tell it's fresh, raw ginger because it has the little 'zing' feeling that you get when eating raw ginger root, and it has a strong natural taste.  Raw ginger root is great for ulcers and digestion I've heard.  So this ginger candy is healthy and only one or two can satisfy my sweet tooth without providing so many calories.  I think it's a great find, a high quality, gourmet-style, well-priced candy and I plan to always have some on hand.<br /><br />Link:  [...]

Well I found it with this product, I also used the puppy formula of this and it was an easy transition from puppy to adult food with this line.  This 6 lb bag of food lasts my Chi-Apso approximately a month and I feed her twice a day according to the feeding instructions on the bag.  I like the fact that there are not a alot of fillers in this product and chicken is the first ingredient on the package, so I'm happy to know that my dog is getting the nutrients that she needs.  I also like alot of the other Bil-Jac products, treats, etc.  If you get this product, you will not be disappointed and feel safe knowing that your dog will get all the nutrients they need.

I have always used high-end foods (Wellness, Blue Buffalo, Avoderm, Neutro-Ultra, etc etc.). Yes, we've gone through many brands over the past 6 years but my dogs absolutely LOVE this food. When it gets to be around meal time, they will go and start licking their bowls because they know the Bil-Jac is coming.<br /><br />I am absolutely blown away by how much my dogs love this food. I 100% recommend this product. Added bonus, it's must more cost effective than the raw and/or whole food diet I was going to switch to so I'm even happier about the savings to me.

review/summary: A Big Ripoff!
review/text: I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real "premium" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real "premium" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real "premium" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. I ended up buying Blue Buffalo Wilderness and I have not looked back.

review/summary: Good ginger
review/text: I'm happy with the amount of organic ginger I was able to get by ordering through Amazon.  This ginger is of good quality, and in reading the Indus Organics website, I am glad to know it's from India, and that their plantations use sustainable methods to grow their spices.<br /><br />I did have a small hiccup in my order.  When I received the 2 containers, both of them were not properly sealed inside (the paper label under the lid that says "sealed for your protection.")  I called Indus, and dealt with them directly to send them back for a replacement.  I received great customer service by telephone, and a prompt replacement which was properly sealed.<br /><br />I'll gladly buy Indus again from Amazon.

review/summary: Excellent Quality
review/text: Great smell, great taste, great value.  The ginger is simultaneously strong but not harsh or overpowering.  I mix it with apple cider vinegar and water every morning, or when my stomach is upset, and it's quite delicious that way.  Haven't baked with it, but it should be great in baked goods.

review/summary: Beware ! Picture doesn't match the product as sold by Amazon.com...
review/text: Even though the picture of the product shows the little Recaldent logo, the gum I have received is in fact the old "recipe" and does not contain it. Newer packages don't have the Recaldent logo on the front anymore, but do list it as an ingredient on the back (as "calcium casein peptone calcium phosphate"). The box of 12 packages I have received was the older stuff, with none of that.<br /><br />If you're specifically looking for Trident White with Recaldent... Be warned ! :)
