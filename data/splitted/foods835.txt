review/text: I make lots of cake pops, and I always had problem with white chocolate crumpling up n drying too fast, adding a small teaspoon of those crystals changed the texture of the white chocolate, it's as smooth as the dark one, so easy to dip the pops in it, and drys just as well when placed in the fridge. If you are having any problem with chocolate or candy, this is the product u r looking for

review/text: These are amazing!  They make dipping chocolate so much easier to work with.  Using the proper amount does not adversely affect the flavor, but does make the chocolate very smooth and easy to coat or use with candy molds. Great item, glad I found it and purchased it.

review/text: I lived in NOLA years ago... well just outside anyway, in Marrero. Hey it's close enough to say New Orleans, but I digress... New Orleans, I get back as often as I can -- every morning. The timer starts my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005IBX9">Cuisinart DCC-1200 12-Cup Brew Central Coffeemaker, Black and Brushed Metal</a> dripping and in about 7 minutes, 12 cups of my own personal taste of The Crescent City--robust with just the right amount of spice.

review/summary: Rich, Full-bodied, but Never Bitter
review/text: Being a native of Louisiana, I am a diehard coffee drinker; however, during my nine years in the Navy and 11 in the Army, I developed the habit of drinking whatever coffee was available. Then after all my travels, I had a double homecoming: I came home to Louisiana and to Louisiana coffee, in particular Community New Orleans Blend of Coffee & Chicory.<br /><br />To those of you who may be trying New Orleans blend for the first time, let me tell you that you don't prepare or drink this rich, smooth blend the way you would even the best of other coffees.  First, you use approximately one-half as much coffee as you are used to using with other types.  Right away, you begin to save money, but that's just a side benefit.  Even by using much less coffee, you experience a warm, dark, satisfying drink with never a trace of the bitterness that you would have even if you used more of even the most expensive, faddish brands.<br /><br />People who prefer their coffee "black" will immediately notice that this is not your ordinary cup of coffee; in fact, some may shy away from it because they simply aren't accustomed to the pure, strong flavor of a serious coffee beverage.  I urge those who experience that surprise, to try drinking it with--and I know this is somewhat like heresy to the black coffee drinker--warmed milk (or even better, half and half)and sugar to taste. Suddenly coffee drinking becomes an event, not just a habit.  You'll find yourself holding it in your mouth just a little longer than usual, savoring it much like a beautiful cabernet sauvignon!<br /><br />Now, regarding saving money! I buy my Community New Orleans Blend Coffee & Chicory on subscription from Amazon.com and save about $2.00 per pound over even discount store prices who often don't even carry the full 16 ounce package.<br /><br />So do yourself a favor if, instead of the habit of grabbing a cuppa Joe, you truly enjoy a flavorful coffee treat AND enjoy saving money:  Subscribe to Amazon.com's easy automatic purchase plan.  It's so nice to know that when I open my last "brick" of coffee my fresh two-month supply of this great product will arrive before it's even half empty!

review/summary: Tastes different?
review/text: I live in New Orleans and shipped 10lbs of this from Amazon to my Aunt in KY because it was cheaper than we could find locally. However my aunt reports something different with the way it tastes? Says the bags had the word Premium printed on them, which none of the other bags we have ever received had that on them? The grind seems finer too she reports? I have been shipping this brand of coffee to my aunt for several years without incident until this first batch that was sent from Amazon, not sure what the deal is, maybe that bag had the wrong blend added by mistake, who knows. Still a good value, if you get Prime shipped, its better too.

review/text: My wife and I fell in love with coffee with chicory when we lived in New Orleans.  Now that we're back home in Texas, we get the best of both worlds -- living in Texas and drinking New Orleans coffee!  :)  This is the BEST coffee and chicory to be found.  The folks at Community Coffee KNOW their stuff and always get the perfect roast on the beans and mix the perfect amount of chicory with it to make the perfect blend of rich, deeply flavored coffee.  Not bitter at all.  Got to warn you though, if you're like us, you'll be hooked on it and will feel like kicking the TV when you see an ad for watery coffee substitutes like Folger's, Maxwell House (we used to drink Master Blend but this is WAY better) and all the rest of the big commercial coffees.

review/text: Hi I'm Tammie I live in Abita Springs, Louisiana about 45 miles from New Orleans, Louisiana I dranked Cumminty coffe since I was a little girl when my dad and mom would say Tammie go get me a cup a coffee or go make a pot of coffee. Well every morning since I half to have a coffee maker with a timer so I can have a cup of coffee first thing when I wake up. The parenting experts say children should'nt have coffee, Well their wrong my children 1 girl and 2 boys would wake up every morning to a cup of coffee at breakfast. It would move their bowels before school. When they wouls get to school they would have no need to half to use the bathroom at school. Also it gives them that little pep they need to get a great start for school. Well recently my husband retired after 30 years on the New Orleans Port as a Long shorman at the age of 49. When or little girl Kimberly 12 years old passed from Pro Long QT Syndrome the doctors mis diagnosed her with Epilespy. On June 29th 2007. We drink alot of coffee up to 3 pots a day. We had to cut back on the cost of everything we consumed so he bought Folgers another New Orleans coffee brand, Well it's so nasty to where I could'nt drink it no more. He tried Rouses brand, walmart brand, and others that was cheaper, then found out there's toxins in some of the cheaper brands. Well finally he bought Maxwell House well it was better than the others. But I really wanted my Cummunity New Orleans Chickory Blend coffee. So I'm addicted to Amazon so bad it's to where I have so many others getting addicted to Amazon also. My children included they love and enjoy amazon to. they like their wish list I set up for them. I found the site about Cummunity Coffee I could'nt believe my eye's. I found out how resonable priced it is. Well you ought to know what i did well I clicked summit order payed and could'nt wait for arrival. It was here in no time. The only thing is if you have the right coffee maker where it rains on it and 200 degrees tempature you only need 1- 1/2 to 2 scoops for 12 cups where if you use a coffee pot that spits out the water you half to use more than 3 to 4 scoops of grounds. By the time you do the math with the right coffe pot and scoops needed to make a pot coffee it is cheaper are dam near the same price for that terrible heart burn, burnt flavor, bad flavor running out of coffee grounds facter COFFEE. The only thing I enjoy more than my children (? HaHa) maybe more than my children is a good flavor Coffee to start the day off. And my 2 sons are happier because they even enjoy the better flavor to because it just makes they morning go off like a hitch.  SO IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT ORDERING WELL YOU WILL BE MAKE A GOOD DICISSION. I Hope this was helpfull Thanks for reading Tammie from Louisiana.

There are much more small pieces (with two circles) than any other sizes. I got clear treat bags from art store and the colorful pieces looks reatlly great in the bags.  The colors were slightly different from the picture.  They were pink (or muted red), light blue, mint green and bright yellow, no whites or browns as shown in the picture.  As for the taste, the candies are hard, like the Sweathearts.  However, my son who has very picky taste for sweats loved the candy.  He usually won't even eat similar candies. So, I could vouch for the taste.

review/summary: lego candy blocks
review/text: These were purchased to go in goodie bags at my sons 6th birthday party.  When the kids arrived the found their seats and started building with them and eating them.  The flavor is like smarties, and you can really build with them!  I had plenty to go around for 10 kids at the party and they all also were given about a 1/3 cup to take home.  I would buy these again and recommend them for any lego loving kid!

review/text: These candy blocks were much harder than others I have had; you can't even bite into them immediately without breaking your teeth. The bag was almost exclusively made up of yellow and green blocks with a few reds, no orange, white, or blues :( This is one of my favorite candies but I would not buy these again.

review/summary: Lego theme Party Candy....kids loved it!
review/text: The kids at my son's 7th Birthday loved these sweet-tart flavored, stackable, Lego-like candies.<br /><br />My Son had a Lego themed B-day party and as the kids stragled in I sat them at the table and gave them a bag(labeled with names) of these block candies.  They busied themselves with building and eating.  When everyone arrived I set a timer and had them build the talest stack of candy they could by the time the buzzer went off.  The party started off with the apparent Lego theme, an activity, a game, and leftovers for the goodie bag!  Would buy them again....I did not buy from this company.

review/text: I purchased these for a Lego themed party for my son and they were a great addition to the treat bags.  All of the blocks were in excellent condition.  They are very hard, however....almost impossible to chew.  You have to suck on them until they dissolve or risk damaging your teeth.  I also think they are a little pricey.  Overall, a good novelty item for show, but if you're planning on having children eat them, I might choose something else.

review/text: These were the perfect addition to the goody bags for my son's party. We loved how they can actually be used to build with. They came in four flavors (cherry, banana, green--sorry don't recall the flavor, and blue raspberry). My kids didn't love the banana flavor, but that's okay because I did. They are kind of sweet-tart like but not really sour and quite a bit harder. I'd buy them again.

review/summary: exactly what I thought it would be
review/text: This product came on time.  It was a large quantity of candy.  The colors were not as bright as the picture but there was no denying it was lego candy.  I made 35 little bags out of the 2lb package.  I got the bags from a craft store and tied them with lego colored ribbon.  I don't think you would want a child eating more than the 2 oz in one sitting.  It is hard candy that is clearly all sugar.  You could build with the candy which was cool.  I did have a peanut allergy at the party and the mom said she checked it on line and he was able to eat it.  Which he did with no problems.

review/text: The cats do love this food and I feel good feeding it to them because it is high quality food.  Read the ingredients and you may forget you are looking at a pouch of cat food, no ambiguous contents like "poulty by-product meal" here.  My only caveat is the cost.  Yes, I know you pay more for good quality cat food but I have read that even a lower quality wet food is better for your cats than the best dry food any day.  I feed my cats wet food once daily and they have "grazing priviledges" with a bowl of high quality dry food (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C1WE5O">Solid Gold Indigo Moon Holistic Cat Food</a>) that I typically have to fill once a day.  I may buy this once in a while as a treat but they seem to enjoy the less expensive leading brand just as much.

review/text: I bought this tea yesterday. I was a hot day and since I'm pregnant, I've been avoiding regular and diet soda, and I think water, at least here in Akron, tastes terrible, so I've been making sun tea. I drink almost an entire tea jar every day. But the delicious red tea I'd been drinking was getting tiresome and I was looking for something new when I saw this tea. It is SO refreshing as an iced tea. I'm SURE I'd drink it even if I wasn't pregnant because it tastes so delicious. As far as the "claims", who knows... the ingredients like raspberry leaf, etc, seem harmless.

review/summary: A Tasty Tea, and More
review/text: My first-time pregnant wife saw this tea and thought that it couldn't hurt, even if she doubted the efficacy of its claims. She offered me a sip of the tea, and I must say that I liked the combination of mint, fruit, lemon, and spicy flavors. I bought some more tea, and together my wife and I would each enjoy a cup in the evening while sitting out on our back porch and watching the sun set.<br /><br />About a month after drinking this delicious tea, I woke up one morning feeling very queasy. When I told my wife why I looked green in the face, she smiled at me with great compassion and love. "You're having sympathy symptoms." I looked at her blankly. She continued, "It's called Couvade syndrome, from the French `couver', meaning `to hatch'. It's when men feel and experience the physical symptoms associated with pregnancy." "Oh," I said, "I wonder how far it goes." My wife looked at me with loving eyes, laughed, and gave me a hug. "I love you," she said.<br /><br />A few weeks later I found out just how far Couvade syndrome can go when I gained twenty pounds; began suffering backaches, stomachaches, cramping, and mild incontinence; and started craving some foods while finding others nauseating. My wife found my symptoms amusing and endearing, and in that spirit I took a home-pregnancy test, for fun. When the results came back positive, I became concerned. My wife thought I was playing a joke on her, but when then next two tests also came out positive, she also became worried. On our next visit to her OB/GYN, we asked her doctor about my positive results. She looked at me with some concern and told us that elevated human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG--the hormone tested for in at-home pregnancy tests) levels in men are sometimes indicative of testicular cancer. I think I fainted, because I next remember waking up on an exam bed. The doctor recommended an oncologist to me and I set up an appointment right away.<br /><br />The oncologist explained how hCG may be produced by germ cell tumors and had some of my blood drawn for tests. That night was the most terrifying of my life as I waited for the lab results. When I saw the doctor the next day, she gave me the happiest news of my life: besides the hCG, all the other tests were negative for the most common testicular cancers. She still wanted a biopsy to be safe, and I consented, even though the idea of extracting it was not pleasing, to say the least. The biopsy results also came back clean, but the oncologist recommended that I come back in a month to monitor any changes. In the meantime, my wife and I went back to her OB/GYN for an ultrasound, and just for fun, I asked if I could have one too. The doctor humored me and scanned my lower abdomen. When she saw the screen, however, she nearly dropped the probe. "What is it?" I asked. "It looks like you have a uterus," she said, "with a fetus inside of it." I think I fainted. When I woke up, my wife and her doctor were both looking down at me with concern. "Is he always like this?" the doctor asked. "Yes," answered my wife, "but it's been especially bad since the pregnancy." "Whose?" the doctor asked. Everybody laughed. I asked her how this could have happened, and she mentioned intersexualism and chimerism, but I assured her that I was as male as male can be. Nonetheless, she suggested genetic testing.<br /><br />I began to think very hard about when my pregnancy symptoms began, and I realized they all started with the tea. I immediately stopped drinking it, and I began to notice my symptoms slowly disappearing. I had the genetic testing done and all my cells were typically XY male, with no abnormalities. The second ultrasound showed only the appropriate abdominal organs for a male, with no trace of a uterus or fetus. In fact, the only evidence that I had ever been pregnant is a grainy photo from the first ultrasound. The medical community has dismissed my case as mass hysteria, or "folie &agrave; deux". They may be at a loss to explain what happened, but I know the truth.

review/summary: REAL Italian Pasta for Lasagne, made the old fashioned way!
review/text: These are authenic Italian lasagna noodles, not at all like store bought! You will notice the difference the first time you use them. First of all, they are 100% semolina (the best, most expensive, pasta flour) - then they are carefully made the way they were 100 years ago: drawn thru bronze dyes and dried slowly to bring out the best flavor and texture. The bronze dyes leave a rougher surface which makes the pasta easier to handle wet, and the cheese and sauce cling better, so you get a firm easy to cut and serve lasagne. The flavor and quality of your dish will be noticed by everyone. There are ten packages in this case, but the pasta keeps well for two years or more, so that is not a problem at our house. PS Still, if you prefer a less expensive lasagne noodle, a good American brand to try is Muellers: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00260030O">Mueller's Lasagna, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>.

review/summary: FAMILY ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS PASTA!!
review/text: The pasta itself is easy to handle - I did not precook it. No problems. I like the size - it is a bit shorter than my regular store bought lasagna noodles which I like. The texture is smoother in your mouth. This pasta was definitely a hit at our house - along with the REAL Tuscan sauces.<br /><br />I had planned an authentic Tuscan Anniversary party for our family. Researched authentic recipes online. I ordered this lasagna after reading about Italian Pasta on my favorite Italian cooking blog Over a Tuscan Stove. DUH! Didn't realize there was a difference. BIG DIFFERENCE!<br />See  - divinacucina-blog dot com<br /><br />She pictured Garafalo brand - but Amazon didn't have that brand of lasagna. They still don't. They have several other pastas. I believe Costco carries some as well - but not lasagna.<br /><br />So, I tried the De Cecca. I was not disappointed. I understand the wheat is different in Italy. I can't compare it with Garafalo - but I can say that it gave a unique texture to my lasagna and the whole family loved it. IT WAS WONDERFUL!<br /><br />I am glad that I chose to order this pasta instead of using the 'usual' store bought variety. This really is different. It has a lovely texture that truly complimented the other sauce ingredients. Of course, I used an authentic Tuscan sauce recipe that required hours of simmering as well. But the finished dish was one of my best efforts! It was not only beautiful - but absolutely delicious. My husband said it was the BEST lasagna he had ever tasted. It was worth all the effort. It was made with a Ragu (red sauce) and Bechamel (White sauce - instead of ricotta).<br /><br />Ragu recipe (red sauce)[...]<br />For Bechamel: [...]<br />Edited note: OBVIOUSLY they aren't going to allow me to post where I found my recipes. Sorry. An authentic one isn't hard to find.<br /><br />This isn't difficult - just takes some time. You can do the final simmering in the oven - no chance of it burning. Anyone can do this. IT IS SO WORTH IT!! Of course, I can now Never go back to my old way of doing lasagna. I don't ever want to!<br /><br />Buon Appetito = 'ENJOY YOUR MEAL!'

It is so digestible that dogs can be switched to it without problem, I see that all the time when someone else's dog comes over and has a meal here -- no problems at all. I've been feeding for 15 years. When new foods come out, we always try them, but end up going back to Royal Canin as it keeps their weight just right and they love it. I raise Whippets and Brussels Griffons. [...]

review/text: Good quality food proves to be worth the extra cost. I have an eleven year old Cairn who had been showing his years. I bought this food on a reccommendation and now he is playing with the other dogs, going on our walks, and generally more spunky. All three dogs love it. Two Cairns and a Aussie/Lab mix. Good product.

I recently got hooked on rooibos and when I saw this in the Market Spice Pike Place shop I decided to give it a try. It is different from the original cinnamon-orange tea, not as strong or sweet in flavour, but equally very good. I like to leave the teabag in to steep while I'm drinking the tea.

(Thank you to the writer who accurately described the charming little shop in Pike Place Market.) MarketSpice products are high quality and delicious.<br />For tea lovers, once you try MarketSpice tea, you will keep coming back. This tea has a distinctive orange spice flavor that is irresistible! It's makes a wonderfully unique gift for friends and family who enjoy teas as well. The traditional MarketSpice blend is fabulous - this cinnamon-orange rooibos tea is my favorite - over the black or green teas. Try the decaf tea too. MarketSpice has lots of great tea variations. I'd recommend trying other MarketSpice products too, especially the orange-cinnamon honey.

review/summary: Great food with no corn
review/text: This is probably the best dog food you can buy at Petsmart. I'd say 95% of all the dog foods at Petsmart are garbage, but this food gets a 4 out of 6. I really like that it does not have corn. My pug loves this food and the kibble is a good size for him. I started out by feeding him Royal Canin puppy 33 and eventually switched him to Pug 25 once he was over 10 months, but I did not like that both had corn and the kibble seemed too big for his size. Since day one he's loved Blue Buffalo. I've heard of some dogs not eating the darker "life source bits", but my dog eats everything. No diarrhea or gas and his poop is firm every time. I'm glad I switched to this food. It is cheaper to buy it at Petsmart than online AND if you go to the Blue Buffalo website you can get a coupon for $5 off. Also, there is a good amount of protein  in this food and works well. Other foods with super high amounts of protein can be too much for certain dogs. Large dogs that are super active would do well on super high protein and calories, but I have a pug and this food works awesome for him.

It is all I will feed them because of quality, ingredients, method of cooking (cold-formed bits), and smell/flavor.<br />I do keep it in an airtight container so it stays fresh longer but I recommend you buy the size that will last a month or so. After a month of being open, it loses it's 'oomph'. The food is still good, but it won't smell as strongly (I'm not sure how smell and flavor diminish but I know every time we open a new bag my dogs act very happy and jump around)<br /><br />I have two doxies, one is 10 lbs and one is 8 lbs. This bag lasts me a month and I feed them each 3 oz. a day.

review/text: Since my furry friend was a pup, she has had a very sensitive stomach.  I tried various dog foods and regardless of the time frame she was on the food, she still had stomach problems.  A friend told me about Blue Buffalo and once I switched her to this food, her stomach problems are few and far between.  The life protection pieces she is not a fan of, but she scarfs the rest of the food down.  The all natural ingredients and no fillers is also really great.  I definitely recommend Blue Buffalo to anyone looking to change their dogs diet.

This "Blue Buffalo" brand kept coming up as a recommended brand so I decided to give it a try.  Must be something to it as my dog began eating it on the very first bowl.  I was impressed and he was a happy camper.  What more do you need?  We're now on our second bag and he still likes it.  Combine Amazon's decent price with free shipping (Prime Member)and I can save gas on the trip to the store.

review/summary: BEWARE!!  Made my dog Sick!!!
review/text: I am writing this review to warn other dog owners of Blue Buffalo for dogs and what it has done to my  5 yr. old Miniature Dachshund named "Calla".  Back in late October 2011 I switched to Blue Buffalo after it was recommended by a family member. By mid-November Calla started to cry out at night.  We thought it might be a back issue and our "Three" yes three Vets agreed that it could be Intervertebral Disc Disease.  We had blood work done in November and everything looked fine with the exceptions that she was a "little" dehydrated. After months of treatments, with little to no improvement we thought it might be a stomach issue and I started to think about the timing of the change to Blue Buffalo, then I went and goggled "Consumer complaints about Blue Buffalo Pet Foods" and started to really connect the dots.  Yesterday she was diagnosed with "Pancreatitis" and needs to be in the hospital for days for treatment.  I have spent over 3K to this point and do not know if Calla will ever recover fully from this.  She was a completely healthy dog before we changed to Blue Buffalo and since have been living in Hell with nighty episodes.  Please read up on this issues people are having with this product before you buy. I wish I could give a product -minus 5 stars!!!!

It has protein content of 37% and a fat level of 23% (which is a little higher fat level than I would like but...).  I use an independant dog food advisory site when considering any dog food I buy and the Wellness canned dog food was rated a 4.5 (out of 5) stars and was highly recommended.<br /><br />I feed my dogs dry food (consistently the same), but for their evening meal I split a can for my 2 large dogs.<br /><br />The bottom line for me is it is a very good quality dog food and my dogs love it.

review/text: After months of trying, my wife finally developed a potato soup from scratch last year that was pretty tasty. My wife agrees that this soup base is as good or better than her recipe and it is VERY easy to make. Before simmering the soup per the instructions, we added two bunches of raw broccoli, 5 small potatoes (diced and boiled for 8 minutes), added some fresh ground pepper and a small amount of salt and served it with crumbled bacon and cheddar cheese over the top. It was fantastic. We highly recommend this soup, it is now a regular part of our meal rotation.

review/text: I really love Bear Creek Soup Mixes.<br /><br />I just wish I could still get them in the cans with the largest number of multiple servings.  2 of these large packs is too much while 1 is just not enough.<br /><br />JABC

review/summary: EXCELLENT soup!
review/text: Have tried most all of Bear Creek soup mixes and it is hard to tell which one is my favorite. This one tops the list for sure. Nice cheesy flavor with a great bite of potato. I like to boil up a few new potatoes and dice them into the soup while it is simmering. Guess I just like a tad more potato. This soup, as others have stated is a great base for any addins that you would like! Experiment with it and come up with your families favorite mix. Can't beat the taste and the price is comparable to the supermarket. Occasionaly comes and sale and when it does I stock up!

review/summary: Vegetarian and creamy
review/text: I had this Bear Creek Cheddar Potato Soup Mix in my pantry for ages, unsure whether a powdery mixture could constitute a real bowl of soup. Finally, I gave it a shop and found that this soup is surprisingly rich and creamy!  It has a lucsious, rich flavor and is vegetarian to boot. This soup takes about 25 minutes from start to finish, and only has 3 steps (boil water, whisk mix into water, stir occasionally).  I made 2 pouches in one week and wish there were more vegetarian soups by Bear Creek.<br /><br />**WARNING**<br />Please note the plain POTATO soup by Bear Creek is NOT vegetarian.  I bought a 6 pack and will not be eating it because if the chicken in the ingrediants.  As far as I have been able to find out the Cheddar Potato is the only soup they make that doesn't have beef or chicken parts.
