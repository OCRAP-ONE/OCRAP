review/summary: These things are ridiculously tasty
review/text: I recently moved to a new area and there's a Vietnamese grocery on my block -- lots of new stuff to try: different vegetables and vinegars and fruits and such.<br /><br />And snacks.  Different snacks.<br /><br />These rice crackers are like the large version of the orange squares that sometimes show up in trail mix.  Nothing too exotic, really -- just a rice crisp with what seems to be a light sugar glaze.  But oh, man, are they good, and addictive, and pretty inexpensive.  The individual wrapping is handy, too; I can buy a bag of these for the work room and they stay fresh for the one or two days or single afternoon until they're all scarfed up.<br /><br />Hoepfully, they're not too nutritionally sketchy.  I wouldn't subsist on these, or anything, but they're great, great snacks.<br /><br />P.S. If anyone knows if Bin-Bin makes T-shirts, I'd snag one.  One of their pacakages features a character named "Yappy" which has a really nifty design.

review/summary: May Be The Flavor You've Been Missing
review/text: Try this on/in your poultry dishes and see if it doesn't satisfy and make the food you're eating just taste like you think it should! It really makes chicken taste like chicken.<br /><br />I put this in my turkey tetrazzini, on baked chicken, and in chicken/turkey gravy. I do still add my own other spices to things, including some salt and pepper, but putting this Emeril's Chicken Rub in first and then adding whatever else I want seems to yield a balanced, flavorful result, much better than I could get without it. I know tonight if I hadn't had this, my latest batch of tetrazzini would've been lacking despite my adding other flavors and spices. It's called a rub, but I've been sprinkling it in and on things without any rubbing, heh.<br /><br />Note: There is red pepper and paprika in this, the bottle says, so if you're heat sensitive, you may want to try to go a little light at first to see how it seems to you. I like it and have no problems, though I can tell there's a heat sense to it.<br /><br />Note also: I haven't seen this in lots of local grocery stores (I've been looking; hence, the reason I'm on the internet and at Amazon, trying to find out where to get it now.) You may have to find out who carries it near you or order it online.

review/summary: tasty, human grade ingredients, unique manufacturing process
review/text: Blue Buffalo Spa Select is great! Top of the line ingredients, human food grade-- there's a chicken version and a fish version. I'm really careful to keep on top of the literature about pet foods, and so I'm confident that this food meets a high standard. No yucky meat "by-products", meat and meat meals are the top ingredients, in addition to a host of wholesome and varied ingredients and probiotics.<br /><br />On top of that, this is an incredibly palatable food. My cat LOVES it. In fact, she scarfs it right down, when she typically has just grazed on a piece or two at a time of other premium foods. I have to be careful to use a measuring cup and not overfeed her, 'cause she will seek me out and meow for more!<br /><br />Blue Buffalo uses a unique process to manufacture "lifebits" which are added to the food. These smaller, darker pieces are cold formed in order to maintain nutrients. I don't believe any other company incorporates this kind of element into cat or dog food.<br /><br />I came across this cat food at the local Tractor supply (I was there to buy chicken feed!). I'd never heard or read about Blue Buffalo, but I respect what they are doing, and I've changed to Blue Buffalo dog food for my golden retrievers, too.

review/summary: Cat allergic to chicken; this food works
review/text: I adopted a cat last year from the SPCA.  They sent her home with a bag of Hill Science Diet.  Luckily, she was at the SPCA less than one week before I adopted her.  She became very ill once home.  Trying different things, I finally decided to try eliminating certain foods.  Every cat food you buy at big box stores has chicken in it, no matter the flavor.  So started reading lables at a leading pet store.  Still difficult finding one.  Petsmart had a store brand with turkey, and my cat ate this for months.  Then she wouldn't touch it.  Tried several other types before I came across this food.  No chicken.  She has been gaining weight since eating this food.  I am just keeping my figners crossed she doesn't tire of it.  Not many options out there.

review/summary: Cats are in love!  Very good food
review/text: We had first heard of Blue Buffalo on the internet.  We don't have any place where we live<br />that carries this food.  So, I ordered one online (a little different from this one).<br />The cats loved it.<br /><br />I wasn't sure how much they'd love it or tolerate it, so I filled their treat ball with this.<br />The food is a nice size for cats, and it is just smelly enough for them to be interested and<br />humans to not mind it.<br /><br />I do wish Blue Buffalo would be a little more clear on what the difference is between the various<br />types of dry cat food. We bought the Spa Select the first time, and I got this one this time.<br />I don't know what the difference is, and I didn't save the bag.  More clarification or a comparison<br />chart from the vendor would be nice.  Even their own site does not really do a good job of this.<br />They compare against other cat food brands, but not within themselves.<br /><br />Anyway, the cats both love it, and the ingredients are very healthy for them.  Little if any fillers.<br />We fill their treat ball with this food, and feed them wet once a day.<br />This is the food they go after at 3 in the morning.

review/summary: My finicky cat will barely eat this
review/text: Having seen the TV adds for Blue Buffalo pet foods I was very optimistic to try this for my adult cat. She is very finicky, preferring canned shredded meat to dry food though she will nibble on food like some major brand Cat Chow during the day. So, I ordered a bag of this and she hardly touches it. If I offer it her in the morning and then fresh servings at lunch and dinner, she barely nibbles at it and sits by her bowl and mews.  Usually it's not until close to dinner time when she;ll actually start nibbling on this. I was very disappointed because I really liked the health benefits for he but if she won't eat it then that really dos her no goof.  I will have to try the wilderness variety next.

review/summary: Awesome semi-dry salami
review/text: We sampled some Creminelli Salami al Tartufo this morning at a better supermarket in Virginia. The flavor was incredible. The infusion of black truffles smooths out the spices. The trick is to slice this almost paper thin to really enjoy the flavors. Too thick, and you'll have more of a challenge breaking this down as it is a fairly dry meat. This has some slight to moderately deep earthy tones, and coupled with an excellent meat/fat balance, and top notch selection of spices, makes for a wonderful experience. We bought a 1/2 pound stick and couldn't wait to get home. Pair this with your favorite Cabernet or Bordeaux and be prepared for a delightful experience. I will definitely be getting this again.

review/summary: Best Ramen
review/text: As a college student who lives in the dormitory, I often get bored of the food that school provides. They always have same menus and it does not taste good. Also, as a Korean student, hamburgers, pasta, and bread are too greasy and cheesy for me. Thus, when I do not feel like going down to the school cafeteria or want to eat Korean food, I cook Shin ramen. It is not cheesy or greasy like burgers, and eating Shin ramen makes me feel I am home.<br />On the front wrap of the ramen, it has picture of cooked Shin ramen with Red coloring which indicates it is hot and spicy. On the back of the wrap, it has recipe, ingredients, expiration date, and etc. By just looking at the wrap, my mouth gets watery and I get hungry. I can imagine the taste and its spiciness while I am writing this review.<br />For those people who are not good at cooking foods, you do not have to worry. Cooking this ramen is very simple and it can be cooked in less than five minutes. Basic way to cook this ramen is to follow the direction on the back of the wrapper. First, boil the water and put noodle and two packs of seasonings. Anybody can cook this. If this direction is still hard for you, you can get Shin ramen cup-noodle. You just need to pour boiling water in to the cup.<br />Other than simple recipe, there are many different ways to cook this ramen. The spiciness of the ramen can be controlled by putting how much seasoning is put. Also, adding different ingredients, such as mushrooms, hot peppers, meats, or eggs can make the soup taste much better. My recommendation is putting all the seasoning and adding Kimchi to make the ramen spicier. For those people who are not so good at eating spicy food, I recommend putting raw egg to make the soup less spicy.<br />Also, I recommend try eating Shin ramen raw. Crack the noodles before you open the wrapper. Open up the wrapper, do not put the vegetable seasoning, but put spicy seasoning. After, you shake them up together and make spicy ramen chip. Instead of eating as a meal, you can enjoy it as a snack while you watch movie or TV.<br /> As a ramen lover, I have tried many different ramen from different countries. After I have tasted most of the ramen, I made a conclusion that Shin ramen shows superior quantity and quality from the other types of ramen. Compared to the most common ramen in the United States, the Maruchan ramen, Shin ramen has more filling and spicy. Other than its better quantity, its quality is also superior. Shin ramen has two seasonings, which includes dried vegetable seasonings and spicy seasonings. However, Maruchan ramen do not have vegetable seasoning.<br />Although it shows superior quantity and quality from Maruchan ramen, it is quite expensive compared to Maruchan ramen. It is fifteen dollars per pack of 20 ramen, when Maruchan ramen is fifteen dollars per pack of thirty six ramen. Although the price is higher than Maruchan, I strongly recommend Shin ramen for those who want spicy hot soup with better filling.

I also advice adding some baby bok choy, dried mushrooms, egg, beef etc... you can make a damn good meal out of these.<br /><br />They aren't perfect but they're as good as you can get at home.

review/summary: The only ramen I'll eat
review/text: The Malaysian postdoc in my lab introduced me to these. I've never been a huge fan of ramen, but I love spicy food and I needed some cheap meals, so I tried them. She suggested that I start with half the spice packet which wasn't nearly hot enough for me (she was impressed by this, actually), so I added the whole packet. I would suggest half the packet to anyone who hasn't tried them before, though...I have a very high heat tolerance. I think they actually taste pretty beefy, too, though I'm a little frightened by what is lending it the beefy flavor. At any rate, I'm sending the box of 20 to my brother-in-law who is on deployment. He's in the Navy, loves ramen and spicy food, and finds the meal choices on the ship a *bit* limited. He has the ability to make ramen or cup-o-noodles on the ship, and since they're not perishable, they're perfect to send to someone who's going to be trapped on a ship for 6 or 7 months.

Although it took a little while for my stomach to get used to them, I love these noodles ! Although I didn't purchase them for this reason, they assisted me with losing some weight. I am currently stationed in Kuwait; however, shipping was very fast. I ordered 2 cases thus far and I am going to order 2 more at the beginning of next month. I highly recommend these noodles !!!

review/text: I love this stuff, but sadly just received a phone call from my mother who was watching Taiwanese news -- they recently were warning consumers in Asia NOT to buy Shin Ramyun (this brand specifically!) because of the increased risks of cancer...<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />See this older study.

review/summary: Feeling a little under the weather?  Break out the Shin!
review/text: My wife has a tender stomach.  When she's sick, it's lightly buttered toast and baked potatoes until her stomach is ready.  Me?  Spicy.  The hotter the better.  Whether it's a head cold or a stomach ailment, I go to the store and grab a pack of Shin Ramyun and doctor it up.  A bag of frozen veg is great, and leftover pork chops, steak, or chicken is awesome.  For the seafood one, I also keep pre-cooked frozen shrimp on hand.<br /><br />Note:  If you wanna amp up the heat (as I like), ditch the whole soup concept and put in just enough water to soften the noodles.  Make it more like lo mein than a soup basically.  The heat is WAY more intense and you'll feel your lips tingling for awhile afterward.  (Just finished a bowl now and my belly is quite happy.)

review/summary: dog gives 5 star for taest I give 3.5 for mess
review/text: I have a 10 month old Weimaraner that loved the Busy Bone Chewbone treat. He has some separation anxiety and they can help keep him calm. It takes him about 15-20 minutes to eat but it is long enough for him to calm himself down. I just make sure he keeps it off white stuff. The red  center bleeds a little if he drops the wet side down or a piece gets broken off and falls on a light surface.  My dog will chew on one end then leave it if he gets distracted then come back and chew on the other end and the wet side dies surface he is on. I have been able to clean it out of stuff easily enough but it is a little bit of a annoying that I have to. I also wish they were cheaper.

review/summary: Definitely have had better oatmeal raisin flavored bars
review/text: I like to choose protein bars as a nutrition-dense breakfast option. I tried the Carrot Cake flavor earlier this week and liked it (really does taste like Carrot Cake!), so I thought I would try this flavor as well.<br /><br />The Oatmeal Raisin Walnut Clif bar had more sugar than I normally would have like in a bar (20 grams, or about 4 teaspoons).  However, the rest of the bar's nutritional profile was decent: 10 grams of protein (although a bit more would've been nice to offset the 43 grams of carbs), 5 grams of fiber (excellent!), and 5 grams of fat (1 gram saturated).<br /><br />Regarding the taste, this bar wasn't nearly as good as the Carrot Cake version.  It is dense and chewy, and it wasn't bad, it just didn't have much of an oatmeal raisin taste to it at all (there was a slight walnut flavor).  On the plus side, the ingredients for this bar are mostly natural, including plenty of soy (of course, this might be a negative for someone trying to avoid soy products), rolled oats, raisins, and walnuts.  In the end, though, I probably wouldn't buy this bar again.<br /><br />One final note:  after I ate the Carrot Cake Clif bar earlier this week, I felt rather dizzy and sick to my stomach about an hour later.  I thought this was just a fluke, but the same thing happened today when I tried the Oatmeal Raisin Clif bar.  My blood pressure tends to run low, and I don't know if there is some ingredient in these bars that is somehow interacting with it; it's odd because I don't usually have food sensitivities, but I just thought that I would mention it.

review/summary: Best Tasting Maple Syrup Ever
review/text: I have never been a big fan of maple syrup but I set up an Amazon subscribe and save subscription for this product because everyone else in my family loves maple syrup and I wanted to get an organic product since we go through it so fast.  Also, my husband kept complaining that the maple syrup I was buying at Costco just wasn't all that great.  You can imagine my surprise when I tasted this maple syrup and discovered how amazingly good it is.  I never used to put syrup on my pancakes but now I want to make pancakes simply so I can eat some of this syrup.  It is that good.  I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: The REAL Maple Syrup
review/text: I have had products from the Coombs farm in my pantry for years.  This is what Maple Syrup tastes like.  This is the best Maple syrup I know of.  I use the Grade B for cooking (it has a stronger flavor that withstands cooking) - everything from breads to cookies and glazes.<p>This Grade A syrup is wonderful with anything, but I love just a tsp or two with real oatmeal.  I hear that some people make &quot;Mapletinis&quot; out of this syrup and vodka, but I can't say that I have tried one.

review/text: We try to keep our diet organic as best we can. This is one of the few organic maple syrups that I could find. Luckily, it is also one of the best tasting. For those who are still unaware that there is a HUGH difference between maple syrup and the "maple flavored" sugar c**p that lines the grocery store shelves, you owe it to yourself to try genuine maple syrup. To those who already appreciate maple syrup I highly recommend Coomb's.

review/text: We use this for pancakes and waffles every morning and it is absolutely delicious!  If you are looking for real maple syrup instead of an artificially flavored table syrup, this is the way to go.  I tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013E21V8">Highland Sugarworks Pure Organic Grade A Dark Amber Maple Syrup, 32-Ounce Jug</a> but found that the Coombs Family brand has a smoother, more maple-y taste.  This Grade A Dark Amber provides a flavor similar to a table syrup, without the artificial chemically taste associated with those.  If you are considering a maple syrup for baking or just like a stronger flavor, I would go with a Grade B.

review/summary: Excellent Syrup - !00% Pure, Natural, & Organic! As Maple Syrup Should Be!
review/text: Seeing as there was an unfortunate negative review left by an unknowing person, I felt compelled to not only respond to his review directly, but to balance it out by leaving a review of my very own. I'm also bored at work, so it gives me something to do. LOL.<br /><br />I love real maple syrup, and I've tried most major brands, as well as many smaller, local brands (I live in the northeast). The taste and consistency of Coombs is perfect and in line with all high quality maple syrups. This is how the real deal tastes and feels. I prefer a deep, rich maple flavor, so I keep a bottle of dark amber on hand at all times. If I'm feeling particularly sassy, or a frigid winter morning is threatening to keep me from work, I will actually use a dark grade B syrup. Generally speaking, that's reserved for cooking, but I love the robust, often complex taste and structure. It can become a transformative experience - I imagine the old growth forest that gently watched over the land for generations before, and who will continue its watchful eye for generations yet to come, and I find myself reconnecting with something much greater than myself. It is humbling and deliciously wonderful to be brought to my knees by the enormity of it. Who knew pancakes could elicit such a deep introspection. Pippa's pancake philosophy - It could revolutionize the world! It truly baffles me that the darker ambers are considered "sub-par" or of generally lesser quality. But hey... that's just me, I suppose. If you want milder flavor, go for a medium amber. If you just want a sweet coating for your pancakes, go for the light amber.... and never come to the northeast. LOL - just kidding (sort of).<br /><br />If you find yourself balking at the taste and/or consistency, I suspect that you are overly accustomed to the cheap crap you find in a general grocer's aisles. They add a bunch of nasty chemicals, fillers, and thickeners to their products. Or worse, as is the case with such brands as Aunt Jemima's and Mrs. Butterworths, there is ZERO actual maple syrup in the "formula." That is not an exaggeration. Look at the ingredient list and you will see it's basically high fructose corn syrup with a synthetic "maple" flavor.<br /><br />It's a disservice to the Amazon rating system when people give a good product a one-star rating simply because they do not know any better - don't get me started on the troglodytes who stammer on about nonsensical bull-shite that has nothing to do with the product or its inherent quality, or lack thereof. Although, in all honesty, it's far more disconcerting that Americans have become so disconnected from their food that they react negatively when offered the real thing. But I digress - that diatribe is best saved for another time.<br /><br />Overall, this syrup is some of the best around. And the price is pretty decent, esp. if you use the "Subscribe and Save" option. You'd be hard pressed to find a better deal in the store, and Coombs is probably the best offering here on Amazon.

review/summary: So Faboo: Dangerous for those prone to Chips Binges!!!
review/text: I ordered these this week from my organic foods delivery service. OH MY WORD! Spicy (but not burning spicy, more like tongue-warming), sweetish, salty...a really strongly-flavored and delicious chip. If you like barbecue flavor, this is a nice sweet-Mexi-fied barecue.<br /><br />I also like that it's organic.<br /><br />I ate the 5 oz bag in less than 15 minutes. My bad. But dang, if they're not sinfully delicious.<br /><br />Granted, 5oz is not a whole lot (it was skimpy for the price, which is often the case when it comes to organic), but it was 750 calories at a pop. Geesh.<br /><br />Yes, 150 cals per 1 oz serving. That's about par for the course for fried chips.<br /><br />Verdict: Fattening, crispy, flavorful, delicious. Best to stick to very small servings on the side of a low-fat sandwich or soup.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />Mir

review/summary: The best tortilla chips I have ever eaten!!
review/text: I can't say enough good things about Plocky's chips!!  I have purchased this flavor and the black bean flavor <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GWKO7G">Plocky's Tortilla Chips, Black Beans 'N Rice, 7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> and I love them!  They taste better than more well known brands and are very satisfying.  I have never eaten a tortilla chip that didn't make me feel guilty afterwards.  Not with Plocky's...I always eat less and feel satisfied.  I actually prefer these eaten by themselves..no dips...and I keep a bag in my desk at work.  I have even had them for lunch when there is no time to grab something.  I bring them to work to share with friends and they love them too.  I am a fan of Plocky's chips and will continue to purchase them on Amazon.

review/summary: WRONG FLAVOR - got Country BBQ instead of Chili Chipotle
review/text: I was so excited thinking they had my favorite discontinued Kettle flavor, but was disappointed when I opened the box and found this substitution. I am keeping them but would not have ordered 15 bags of this flavor. It is a very good bbq chip but I could get this flavor at the grocery store. Why oh why do my favorite food items always get discontinued??? The one star is for the substitution. The country bbq is a 4 start chip, but not the chip I longed for.

review/summary: Plocky's Rice and Beans Tortilla Chips
review/text: I bought these chips, and wanted to try if they were tasty. It sure is!  Unique and different flavor and the right thickness.<br /><br />It remains crunchy, spicy and flavorful with a hint of tabasco and paprika sauce for heat. There are some rice granules embedded with the tortilla chips. However, some of the spices are lacking from this chip. But I liked this very much.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try a red beans and rice tortilla chips. Go ahead-- you can put other ingredients as nachos except the cheese.  Maybe some el pastor, shredded meat, tomatoes, etcetera.

review/text: The first time I ate these chips was in Aruba in 2007.  I couldn't find them in our area (CT) so you can imagine my joy when I found them on Amazon.  I love these and hope you continue to carry them.  Your prices are terrific too.  I pay $2.99 in Aruba and they run about $2.46 a bag when I buy the case of 12 through Amazon.  Good job!!!!  Only problem is, now everybody wants them here and they steal my bags when the case comes in, but that's ok...sharing is good.

review/text: These chips are delicious. If you like salt & pepper flavored chips with a solid crunch, then you can't go wrong with these--they are the tastiest bag I've come across. The sea salt is easier on the palette than regular salt, in fact I have trouble cutting myself off mid-bag even though I normally enjoy a low sodium diet. I would feel like less of a lush if they had them in the 8-9oz bags.

review/text: We ordered these only because the Black Beans and Rice,which we really. really love, was out of stock.  After about a week, we finally opened up a package and then kicked ourselves for not having tried them earlier.  There is a little kick to them after you swallow them to let you know you have had a hint of hot pepper of some sort.  We took them to a pot luck that night and came home with an empty bag.  I used them, from another bag, as a garnish on a salad that I took to the pot luck and we came home with an empty salad bowl!<br />We will definitely order these again.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GWLUGU">Plocky's Tortilla Chips, Red Beans 'N Rice, 7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Perfect tortilla chip goodness!
review/text: My husband (who, being Mexican, is very picky about his tortilla chips) and I absolutely love these!  The texture is light and crispy, rather than thick and crunchy. He actually usually prefers a very hearty, cruncy chip (Like El Ranchero), but the flavor of these is so fantastic that we're both thilled with them. The bean, rice and corn base makes them incredibly flavorful, and they have a touch of onion and garlic in addition to that. We go through an embarrassing amount of them.  I never, ever like plain chips, but these I can eat without anything else, although they're particularly amazing with a fresh salsa.  I highly recommend these!

It's just derived from a different source, but it has all the same toxic properties. Kettle still advertises their products as containing "No MSG" while they acknowledge that their chips are not safe for people with MSG sensitivities.

This may well help in shipping, but when paying a premium price for 'organic' it just seems more deceptive.

review/text: I bought this come because it said it would help with your teeth but I found most chewing gum carries the same ingredients so I don't suggest buying it for their advertised reason. As far as taste goes it tastes rather fruity for maybe 20 seconds and then the flavor quickly fades. In my opinion not worth buying better off just buying a regular packet of gum. You'll find most sugar free gum contains xylitol. The set look at the packaging.

review/summary: Delicious and Pure! No allergens added!
review/text: In dealing with food intolerances, many products have one or two things added that most people even don't notice. They are not worried about what is in the food. After all, if they look they see these seemingly innocent ingredients in so many things they HAVE TO BE SAFE, RIGHT?<br />If you don't have a reaction to that small amount of added ingredient, you see it as no problem. But for the vastly growing number of us in the population, sudden onset of food allergies and intolerances leaves us with very little to eat. What seems to be an innocent ingredient, or even a welcome one if you feel it keeps the product fresher longer.... there is no innocence for those who cannot tolerate it.<br /><br />I was THRILLED after finding I am corn/soy/gluten/dairy intolerant, that I can actually have SOMETHING fun and interesting to eat! Its pure. Nothing added. Its safe!!!<br /><br />This Coconut Cream is lusciously delicious! It can be whipped for whipped cream for those who cannot have dairy. It is very close in consistency to dairy whipping cream.<br />I can finally have a latte again!<br />And my coveted coconut chicken just like the Chinese buffets serve!<br /><br />It should be used within two days of opening, or frozen. Freezing does not harm the consistency in any way.<br /><br />This coconut cream is to die for! The free shipping is a plus!

review/text: I posted this review about the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008ZWILNS">AROY-D 100% PURE Coconut Cream, 33.8 Oz package (3-pack)</a> also.  But I ordered this first, as I wasn't sure if it would work for me.<br /><br />I am on a diet that requires me to temporarily be dairy-free and needed something for my coffee.  But I didn't want canned coconut milk, as I understand that the BPA-free cans contain BPS, which is nearly as nasty.  I wanted something in aseptic packages.<br /><br />When I first used it in coffee, it did taste slightly coconut-like, but not in an overwhelming way.  I am someone who can't use virgin coconut oil cause it's too strong, I get expeller pressed.  But this did not taste like too much coconut for use as a healthy coffee creamer.<br /><br />The package says to refrigerate after opening and to use within 2 days.  I do neither of these and it remains quite yummy & edible.<br /><br />I have also used it in a few recipes calling for coconut milk just by diluting half way with water.<br /><br />But my new FAVORITE is adding a tablespoon or two of this to a mug of homemade chicken broth and a bit of sea salt.  THIS IS INCREDIBLY YUMMY!
