review/summary: So far, So Good
review/text: I bought these thru warehouse deals to  marinade chicken to barbeque during the summer.  I just opened up a bottle the other night and had chicken marinating for a few hours before grilling.  The chicken tasted good when done and was nice and tender.  Next I will try this on a salad but my main reason for purchasing is I do like Italian dressing on chicken.

review/summary: Excellent Tea
review/text: This tea is of good quality, and quite tasty. It is vegetal and sweet, with a medium body. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that the leaves were a little bit broken - an issue I seem to have with most varieties of Japanese green tea. I was hoping that leaves processed in this style would fare a little better to shipping than sencha and they did, but not a whole lot<br /><br />EDIT<br /><br />After a few more days, my opinion of this tea has only gone up. You absolutely need to steep this tea at least twice. The first time for 1-2 minutes, and the second for 30-45 seconds. The first steeping seems to extract a lot of the bitter and tannic components which hide the real flavor. The second steeping although short, its much more flavorful than the first

review/text: This is the best margarita mix I have ever tasted. On a budget after buying the mix we used cheap tequila and triple sec and in less than 3 hours we drank over a gallon.<br /><br />We discovered this after vacationing in Overland Park, KS also known as Kansas City, MO and staying in a Drury Inn and Suites whose afternoon happy hour offers three free drinks and we fell in love with their margaritas. The bartender was unable to tell us what brand but a call to the manager last week and he happily returned our call and told us.<br /><br />Thanks Drury Inn!!!

review/text: These hard, yet chewable sweets are akin to the hard & shiny Sweetarts candy, but in bottle form. To me, the orange ones are to reminiscent of orange-flavored aspirin, but I dig the blue & white ones... even the red ones are ok - but a little too cherry-tasting for me. The white ones taste like the old sticks in the Lick-a-Maid candies and the blue ones taste a bit like blue raspberry.

review/text: This was just what I wanted. Something that quenches your thirst, has no weird aftertaste, but gives you the same zing as coffee.  This is the less caffeinated product (avitae has stronger versions) but I found it worked for me just great. One of my coffee-addicted friends didn't feel the same punch as I did, likely due to her high caffeine tolerance. This probably means if you are the kind of person who drinks many cups a day, you might want to go to a higher Mg quantity.  That being said, I thought this was great and as an extra bonus it won't stain your teeth or give you coffee breath!  Will definitely keep buying this.

review/summary: Good product, flavorful, easy to use, wonderful time saver in a pinch
review/text: While I prefer the old fashioned way of making pot roast in the crock pot, on occasion, I don't have all the ingredients handy and/or I'm in a hurry to get it done. This is a lifesaver on a hectic day. It is flavorful, easy to use, and gets the job done. Food tastes great. The family does like a lot of & thicker 'juice', so the second time around using this product, I used 2 packets and reduced the required water by a little...well, the pot roast and veggies were stellar, although a bit 'peppery hot'. I can't explain the reason for it other than I didn't use all the recommended water for the product, but it was as if I accidentally dumped a whole pepper shaker full of pepper into the pot. The meal was edible, and on a cold, Nor'Easter night it was comforting - but it also helped drain all our sinuses....word of caution: stick to the instructions on the back of the packet. I'll continue using 2 packets vs 1 for my pot roasts, but will most definitely use the recommended amount of water from now on.<br /><br />p.s.I also love McCormick's Slow Cooker Beef Stew packets for the same reasons mentioned above, but I've not yet messed with those instructions!!!

I use about a 1/4 cup of water because the pot roast & veggies are going to sweat in the slow cooker anyway.

review/text: Well, having grown up in a household where my Nonna Lucia made ALL her pasta from scratch, I consider myself a pasta epicure. There was definitely a difference between  Nonna's pasta and anything coming off the shelves, and the Durhum wheat pasta definitely has a different taste then a multi-grain pasta has.<br /><br />So when I tried Barilla Plus I was surprised at how "full" it tasted -- there were definite "nuances" of flavor contributed by the different grains and flours that make up this pasta -- I suppose saying that it's a healthy way to enjoy pasta might sound demeaining to my also-loved durhum wheat pasta, but in no way is it meant to cast aspersions on my "other" pasta-eating habits.<br /><br />Barilla Plus goes well with any kind of sauce you might want to put on it -- white sauce? great!! Tomato sauce? Wonderful! Butter and Permesan only -- sure, go ahead!! Aglio e Olio? Fine!!<br /><br />Mangia Mangia, la Bella Barilla!!

It is delicious...not overly spicy.  The well-balanced spiciness hits you on the sides and back of the tongue after the sweet, slightly creamy smoothness of the dark chocolate is appreciated.  Wish it were easily available online!

review/summary: Dark chocolate with a spicy twist
review/text: I bought a bar of this chocolate at Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian gift shop in DC. It was so very good that I'm really disappointed I can't find it online anywhere to buy more. If you can get your hands on some, it's well worth the price. I paid $10 for 80g bar (2.82 oz). The flavor is strong, so just one square savored a little at a time was enough to satisfy my chocolate craving at the end of any meal. The red pepper and spices add a wonderful rich blend of flavors to the fine dark chocolate. For those who do not like things hot, don't worry. The spice is just right: not too hot with just a little bite. It was a real treat.

review/summary: Good source for Soursop (Graviola) Tea
review/text: I love Soursop tea (another name for Graviola) , and was looking for a place to buy it for a while! It is a real black tea (as oppose to some fruit or herbal tea) but with the touch of Soursop accent. It is similar to bergamot in Earl Grey in this sense - still real black tea with the touch of the other flavor, but does not have an effect of something overpowering or artificial.<br />The price is pretty good as well - even ebay items seem to be more expensive.

review/text: Flavored teas often sacrifice quality of tea itself. Not in this case. High quality black tea with strong, but not overwhelming Soursop (Graviola) taste.<br />Worth every penny.<br />If you were looking for a good Soursop tea, you are in luck. If you don't know the taste of Soursop yet, do yourself a favor - chances are you will be hooked like I am!

review/text: After reading about Regeneration USA Anti-Aging bar being one of the top products of the year in the Vitamin Retailer Magazine I had to give this bar a try.  The bar was a great, and Amazon got it to me faster than I expected, which was a nice surprise!  It's great to see a company that is dedicated to TRUE healthy products with out all the garbage and added sugars like the other so called "healthy" bars out there.  I love their tea too, I can't wait to try more of their products!

review/text: These bars taste great and are what I call do-able nutrition.  They are not 100% healthy (most products aren't), but they are a healthier alternative than a candy bar for example and have great taste compared to other protein bars.  Even though the amount of protein is not that high, it's still better than no protein.  I use them as a meal replacement or a snack.

review/text: Yes.. they are basically a candy bar because of all of the sugar.  I do NOT recommend using them a few times a day.  But when you need a pick-me-up, or if you're dieting and get those candy cravings, try this.  They are vitamin & mineral packed, and they taste so good!<br /><br />I was doing Nutrisystem, lost 15 lbs in one month, and used these occasionally as my breakfast instead of using the NS entree.  I still lost, and felt great!  And no, they do NOT taste like "hay".  The chocolate Special K protein bars are great as well, but these are my favs

review/summary: Supplementing your diet
review/text: I was advised by my doctor, MD,  that my protein intake was too low and several supplements were available on the market shelves, After reviewing what is available together with factors of cost, taste and ease of procurement, I tried the Kellogg's Special K Strawberry Flavored bars to supplement my daily meals.  One bar accounts for about 20 percent of the daily requirements and is quite easy to eat, tastes about as good as a regular candy bar and fits my needs for more diet protein.  I normally eat one per day, as a between meals snack, either mid-morning or afternoon.

review/summary: Nice not so sweet gluten free vegan tea biscuit
review/text: I am gluten free and vegan AND I have a sweet tooth BUT I'm trying to avoid eating too much sugar.  It's a dilemma! I like to have a few cookies with my coffee or tea and these fit the bill.  They don't have a lot of sugar but they are still sweet enough to feel like you're having a treat.  The label bills them as having fiber but they don't have as much as you would think.  Still, I'm not eating them for fiber's sake but as a snack.<br /><br />Another thing I do like about these is that they can be used to make a really nice gluten free cookie crust for pies.  It's hard to find a gluten free cookie crust but I found griding these up in the processor, mixing them with some melted butter and baking in a pie pan sets up a great crust for key lime pie, etc.  So I'm making the most of these little cookies!<br /><br />I didn't give them 5 stars because they're a bit pricey but I would buy them again.

review/text: Having bought several boxes of Cinnamon Chex at my local supermarket I was pleasantly surprised to find the same cereal on sale at Amazon for a lower price.  Cinnamon Chex might not exactly be a health food breakfast cereal, but you can certainly do a lot worse, and it tastes great.  It has a few pieces of Chex cereal mixed in that have a cinnamon sprinkle coating.  There is just enough that it gives the cereal a pretty strong hint of cinnamon but not enough to be over the top and too sweet.<br /><br />The 12 boxes of cereal arrived quickly and damage free with expiration dates about a year long.<br /><br />All in all... if you love cinnamon, you'll love Cinnamon Chex.

review/text: I bought this to try because I thought it might work as an alternative to the Wanchai Ferry orange chicken kits that are no longer available here.  I crush the very hot chilies in the kit to make it spicier.  This sauce is not nearly as spicy, and doesn't have as good of a flavor.  It works well for orange chicken, just not nearly as spicy as I hoped

review/summary: DE-licious.
review/text: This sauce is seriously delicious. I've cooked every type of meat with it. The first time I used it, I glazed a piece of fish--the first bite I took almost brought me to my knees. This sauce makes you look like a pro cook, making all your dishes tasty.

review/summary: Skip of the mixes
review/text: This is a great little kids oven.  I had one as a kid.  However, I hate the expensive mixes that are full of transfats that come with the oven.  You would think that Hasbro would create mixes that are free of transfats.  Isn't this the way most food companies are going.  This item is especially for kids...you would think they would have done this by now. As a mom, I try to buy food without transfat and preservatives.  I threw away these (made in China) mixes and bought the cookbook-'Baking with Mommy Cookbook'.  I think this toy is much more educational and fun when you make the mixes yourself-great way for kids to learn the basics about cooking with flour, baking soda, etc.

They are a little small (especially if the child has EVER helped Mom, Grandma, etc bake), but the ability to do just about all of it without help is worth the small result.

review/summary: overpriced kits-
review/text: Packages are way overpriced. When I was little, my Mom would measure out the first package kits-then buy cake mixes & measure from there. LOTS CHEAPER!!! Walmart has Betty Crocker mixes for 4/$5.00 & get the snack cookie packages for $1.00. Buy frostings & marshmellow jars. It's just as fun using that. Just keep the original mix packages for mixing instructions. Easy---Easy Bake.

review/text: I bought this for my 6 year old.  She had a blast baking the sugar cookies.  Her little hands and face got dirty and it was good to see her enjoying the whole process.  But when the mixing was done, the comment from her mouth was "That's all?"  For all the work that got put in it made 4 cookies.  The cookies were good but my little girl was somewhat disappointed by the quantity that she was able to make.  Oh well, we can call it "enforced portion control" right?

review/text: It isn't just this product where the prices are high. If you go the Hasbro site you will see that all the product prices are EXTREMELY OVERPRICED! I looked at "plastic food" and they were trying to sell it for over $50 dollars in some cases. Toys are a bad buy at Amazon plus the shipping is outrageous. I would suggest toys are something worth driving for if Amazon is the alternative.

review/summary: Overpriced & arrived opened!
review/text: This is meant as a Christmas present for my daughter who loves her Easy Bake oven. I feel that the image and title of the item are deceptive. The box is thin and only has 12 small pouches of mix inside (I expected 12 SETS of mix for $25)! What's worse is my box arrived with all four pieces of protective tape ripped open. It's not advisable to give children edible gifts when the outer packaging has been opened. I wonder if another shopper ordered this item, opened it, and then returned it to Amazon? Unfortunately, there are not enough days until Christmas for me to exchange the gift. My advice to other buyers is to look elsewhere for your Easy Bake mixes.

review/summary: Great taste, and they're whole grain wheat, too!!!
review/text: I was looking for a whole wheat cookie without too much sugar, but with a great taste.  (I also don't want soybean oil or hydrogenated anything.)  These have whole grain wheat flour, evaporated cane juice, palm oil, sea salt, natural flavor, lemon oil, and baking powder.  That's the total list of ingredients, in order.  2 gram of fiber, 2 grams of protein, and 9 grams of sugar for 5 cookies - 140 calories.  And they are SO GOOD!!  Unfortunately, they're also addicting.  I'm going to put 5 cookies per snack baggie to keep myself from indulging too much.  They also make a chocolate chip cookie, which is pretty good, but for some reason the lemon hit my taste buds just right.

review/summary: Where is the lemon flavor?
review/text: Don't call your product lemon cookies if the lemon flavor is barely perceptible. It's not an expensive or unhealthy ingredient so why skimp on it? And it might help hide the cardboard aftertaste of the other ingredients. I could barely taste lemon and that's what you should expect if you buy these. Is the "California" some sort of qualifier that's supposed to let people know they won't taste much of the advertised flavor? Boo. Do better next time. Because slapping "Back to Nature" on your boxes doesn't give you license to taste worse than all the cheap, unhealthy garbage out there.

review/text: I usually prefer from most brands the sausage sticks over jerky, but I'm finding with this brand that their jerky is better.  In fact this is the second sausage product by them I've given 4 stars, while almost every jerky product I've given five.  To be fair, I did like these a bit better then the short shots, although I still gave those 4 stars as well.  I just don't quite like the flavor or texture of these as much as their jerky products overall.  They aren't bad, but I would suggest trying the jerky first unless you truly only like dried sausages.  I've also tried the teriyaki flavor, and found I enjoyed it slightly more then the honey stung, but that's straight personal preference I think.  I found their teriyaki jerky to be my favorite so far of their country cut line of jerky for instance.
