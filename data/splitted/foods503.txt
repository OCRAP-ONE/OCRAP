review/summary: Best tea ever . . . for the benefits
review/text: I think people these days would benefit from being schooled in writing an appropriate review.  Really now.  I'm on here because of the person that gave this product 2 stars.  This product is well known in the voice over/singing  business - as the best tea for the benefits it provides.  You do have to steep it a while before drinking & in my opinion, the tea is not very paletable.  But I am willing to drink it for the benefits it provides.  If you are a singer or voice over artist - it does exactly what it says: it coats your throat & you can sing or talk for a very long time.  It's worth a try & the Slippery Elm DOES indeed coat your throat.<br /><br />Thanks ~<br />Rose of Rose Recordings, LLC<br />rosecllc dot com

review/text: I never rate things on here but I had to make an exception for this tea. Usually any hot drink will alleviate some discomfort in a sore throat, but this throat coat tea goes above and beyond that. No matter if it's a sore throat from sinus drainage, a cold, or whatever else, this tea has always cleared up all the itchy, scratchy, and painful problems I've had for at least a couple of hours at a time. That's more than a lot of medicine is able to do.

The DHA is derived from Tuna Oil which is not so bad, however it also contains Gelatin, derived from pork, not vegetables!.

review/summary: Good product, best price...
review/text: We've been eating these pears for over 2.5 years at least twice a day.  Gerber's organic variety is the cheapest price per oz I've found for an "organic pear-only" baby food.  Amazon's price (without Prime) is slightly less than our local grocery store when purchased at regular price.  This is the best price I've found outside special sales.  Contrary to the other review, almost all baby food is "cooked" via some method, usually steaming - even if homeade - which I did for a long time before switching to packaged versions for convenience and inaccessibility to organic produce.  The homeade raw puree works better for her child, but this product has been great for us.  It's been solving our constipation issues for over two years, and it works wonderfully!

review/summary: Gerber's fruits are cooked
review/text: I've been giving my daughter Gerber fruits, veggies, and meat as everyday-meals since she was 6 months old, thinking that she's got enough vitamins and prebiotics. However, she developed digestive problem and chronic constipation; she almost stopped gaining weight since she was 9 months old. I took her to GI and she told me that those packed fruits are all cooked! And there are additives to keep them fresh for long period of time! I started to puree fruits and veggies using Vitamix, and only use Gerber fruits&veggies when we are out and about. Now, after half a year of probiotics and wholesome food, she's slowly getting better and opens her mouth to food.<br />Now, think about this: if you puree an apple and leave it alone for 5 minutes, it'll change color due to oxidation. So, how can Gerber's apple puree keep the same color for so long a time?

review/text: When you get this home and read the ingredients list, you will see: This product has "organic" stamped all over it, but when you read the ingredients list, it includes tuna oil that is not organic. I called the company, and they said the product "does not have harmful levels of mercury."  I prefer my bananas with NO mercury, thanks. They include tuna oil to provide a source of DHA, but there are several baby products that have plant-based sources of DHA. We are vegetarian, and I don't want to feed fish oil to my baby. I recommend other brands like Earth's Best which seem to be more careful about their ingredients. I'm sure this is fine for people who are feeding tuna fish to their babies anyway, but we don't plan to give ours tuna fish.

review/summary: My all-time favorite licorice
review/text: I first tasted this licorice in a Cracker Barrel country store.  It's everything I associate with great tasting licorice and has among its natural ingredients (both for color and flavor) beet juice.  There's also a hint of molasses flavor, and possibly prune.  If you have an aversion for these flavors, you may not like this licorice.  Try one of their stranger (as in not-black) licorice flavors--apple, mango, strawberry--something along those lines.  This licorice is very flavorful, and only suitable for those who really like the taste of licorice.  It's not tough or slick or shiny. In color it is black/brown. In taste it is wonderful, and this price is much better than purchasing it a pack at a time.<br /><br />I should also mention that true (not artificial) licorice has a property which prompts the body to retain fluids.  It's NOT recommended for those with high blood pressure.  Which prompts me to wonder why anyone would salt licorice.  But that's a subject of a previous review.

review/text: I recently went on a trip to the Portland area and had the pleasure of seeing a Fred Meyer in the area and when I was there the hotel coffee was this dismal packet that no one who really drinks coffee will tolerate ..so I wandered in the store and saw the Folgers french vanilla and it was pretty cheap for a small one so I was like hmm why not and I swear its some of the best coffee I have had in ages I usually grind my own but for a pre-ground coffee this one is my fave now, when I got home I was so sad because no stores here have it so I checked on amazon and here it was and its super cheap on here too so I am now a happy camper and recommend you try this blend of coffee its really smooth.. I know its french vanilla but it kinda reminds me of maple syrup a bit too.<br /><br />update- 03-2012 I did eventually figure out a place thats sells the coffee and I have actually moved from the area I couldn't find it in.. so no longer and issue but if your having trouble finding it locally go to if you have one your local target..they had it and it was cheap too. so yeah hope this helps :)

review/summary: Vruit Juice, Orange Veggie Blend, 27-Count 8-Ounce Cartons
review/text: ASIN B000LKVT4U - A friend of mine owns an organic grocery store near me, and she's always introducing me to new foods and drinks I've never heard of - usually these introductions don't go too well.  Vruit's Orange Veggie Blend is a surprising exception.<br /><br />Falling into the newly-popular vegetable drinks that taste fruity, Vruit is a bit overpriced on the store shelves for what it is, particularly since it's not alone on that shelf.  Amazon's price is quite good, and with free shipping, you can't go wrong.  Vruit loses points from me, though, because - as an all natural product whose largest consumer base is likely to be the organic, save-the-planet crowd - it bothers me that the stuff comes in single-serving juice boxes instead of a less-packaging, more-eco-friendly recyclable bottle.<br /><br />The Orange Veggie Blend actually reminds me of an apricot juice, although a bit more tart.  There isn't exactly an after-taste, but there is an after-effect, in that my mouth feels a bit puckered and strangely dry after I drink one.  Healthy?  Yes.  Tasty?  Surprisingly, yes.  Thirst-quenching?  Not really.  A glass of cold water goes further and doesn't require me to sip from a tiny straw like a toddler.  I won't be buying these any time soon, but I'll still recommend them to others!<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks

review/text: I am not normally a fan of flavored coffees but this is one that I enjoyed immensely.  A good cup of coffee starts with (surprise) excellent coffee beans. This may seem a truism but it is impossible to substitute "coffee crystals" (how natural) or beans that are not Arabica and obtain a satisfactory brew.<br /><br />Secondly is the roasting of which Gevalia excels and finally, for flavored brands, the subtlety of the infusion of flavors.  In this case there is no comparison with the many rivals - it is the best - deep, throaty, refreshing aftertaste, a superb offering.

Unfortunately, I was sent a box of bars that are just days away from their expiration date. They're old and stale, which is really disappointing since I was really looking forward to them. I guess I'll have to learn to make them myself or spend more time in Boulder, where you can get them everywhere.

review/summary: Great low-fat snack
review/text: This is a great-tasting, low fat product that is not available in the supermarkets in my area.  My favorite from Genisoy is the salt & pepper, but this product is right up there. I'm always skeptical of the soy based snacks regarding taste, but these, the salt & pepper variety and Glenny's BBQ fit the bill.

review/summary: Good deal for the price
review/text: Jelly Flops are about half the price of first quality Jelly Belly beans.  Almost all of the Jelly Flops are edible and generally they taste the same as their premiun counterparts.  There are some factors to consider:<br />1) There are a lot of the same flavors and none of others.  For example, in one bag, there can be more than 25% of a single flavor.<br />2) The predmoninant flavors vary from bag to bag but there always seems to be a lot of red, green and purples.<br />2) Most flops simply don't have the JB logo imprinted.  The remainder consists primarily of 'doubles' and a few 'triples'.  JB must reject anything larger than 3 beans since I've only rarely found these.<br />4) Almost all of the beans are the most basic flavors.  There are virtually no special flavors, including: tropicals, alchohol, cinnamon, licorice and all mints.<br /><br />If you buy these from Amazon, not only do yo receive free shipping but also the occasional discount.

review/summary: Quaker Oats Oldfashioned Grits
review/text: It is awesome to find a product still exists from when you were a child.  Quaker Oats Grits have been around for quite some time and are still as wonderful as ever.  These grits do take 45 minutes of cooking time and stirring, however, the outcome is well worth the time and trouble.  These oldfashioned grits, I think, are much better than the quick variety.  I believe that once you try them, you will not return to the quick grits.

review/text: Eukanuba is junk with crap ingredients. They have good marketing and packaging to make you think it is high quality when it is actually the exact opposite. The same can be said for IAMs. Eukanuba gave my perfectly healthy boston terrier skin problems which although weren't his cause of death, it was the first domino that led to his death. If I had not fed him this junk, he would still be alive today. Im not a random case. The problem is byproducts, fillers and the use of corn. You mind as well feed your dog alpo and save yourself the money. No dog food should contain byproducts,soybean or corn.

review/summary: Cheapest Price Around For A Great Dog Food
review/text: If you are looking at this page then you probably already know that Eukanuba is a great food for your dogs. About ten years ago it was recommended to me by my vet and breeder and we haven't used anything else since. We have 2 1lb+- chihuahuas and are always struggling to keep them fattened up as they run around like the energizer bunny. This is the only food that has managed to put at least a little bit of weight on our smallest one. At $27 shipped this is the lowest price I have been able to find anywhere locally or online. The lowest place I could find locally was $35+tax normal price and I found one "on sale" for $30+tax. I imagine this will probably be the case for you as well so if so don't hesitate to pick it up here. I ordered it on the 8th and it was at my door on the 11th which was a very nice turn around.

Plus, the aroma is superb.<br /><br /> Now, that would be enough but to have a large 12 oz. cup is another bonus.  This is what my significant other refers to as a "real cup of coffee."  We use rather heavy 6" tall mugs that keep the coffee hot.<br /><br /> Sunday mornings with the NY Times and a cup of this coffee are the best.  Enjoy!<br /><br />  - Gail Cooke

It's listed as "medium" but I find it weak and tasteless.  Full disclosure: I like bold coffees.<br /><br />UPDATE:  If you find yourself with a box of this coffee, here is a workaround for lack of flavor.  Turn off your machine when the coffee level is at the level of a normal 11 oz. cup of coffee.  You will find something to taste when you leave out the rest of the water.

review/text: This coffee's main advantage is its size!<br /><br />The coffee itself is nothing special and it certainly does not deserved to be labelled as a "medium" roast coffee.  In fact I wonder, how weak must Gevalia's mild brews must be.<br /><br />I was excited about the variety of coffees when I purchased my Tassimo but so far I have been disappointed by all except the Starbuck's blends (which are pricier).  I made a special trip to the US to purchase a few packages of these since many comments pointed towards a comparable alternative to the Starbucks.<br /><br />Having gone through a few now, I'd argue that it's the same as the Nabob Morning Roast sold in Canada.<br /><br />Now back to the size argument, if you had an extra 3oz to the Starbuck's house blend, you will have much richer tasting 12 oz cup of medium roast coffee.

review/summary: Drink is too big
review/text: [...]<br /><br />A nice mainstream coffee with no unpleasant flavors. Not too mild, not too bold, and not unduly acidic. But you had better make sure you have a large mug, because these T-discs are programmed to make a very large cup of coffee. if you have to make one drink then start your commute, then that's justifiable, but for at-home drinkers, you may get a better experience from less liquid. It won't get so cold and lose its optimum taste-delivery temperature.<br /><br />Why do you want 12 ounces of coffee in one shot? 8 ounces twice, a half-hour apart will be a much better experience. However, if you have these T-discs if you hit the button when the mug is filled to around 7 ounces, you get a nicer drink. Less over-extracted and a bit more bold. If you are looking to quench thirst, drink water before your coffee.<br /><br />As with all the T-discs, you can improve your experience by starting with a warm cup/mug/glass and by never using the add more-water-to-overextract-the-grounds feature. If you feel you must add extra water to your cleverly designed coffee drink, do it with plain water using the yellow cleaner disc, not through the spent coffee disc.

review/summary: Top-quality extracts
review/text: The flavor and scent of Simply Organic's flavoring is strong and true.  It is really a light oil extract, so it also seems to have a much longer shelf-life. Considering that the price rivals many of the artificial extracts on the market--yet is clearly better quality--I find it to be a superb value.<br /><br />I love this whole line of extracts, and specifically the lemon extract.  I use it for both baking/cooking purposes (I often replace or supplement vanilla with lemon, as the two flavors really seem to enhance the overall product), as well as to make organic concoctions.<br /><br />One example: I love the smell of Bigelow's Lemon Body Lotion as well as Tutti-Dulce's Lemon Merengue line, but they are pricey. I find it's more cost-effective for me to just buy an inexpensive vanilla-scented body cream, melt it down in the microwave, mix in some of this extract, and when it re-sets it smells just like the expensive stuff!<br /><br />I am also going to try a new toning mask of witchhazel and the lemon extract, which is supposed to help clarify and minimize pores.  Considering the low cost and high-quality of this product, I find myself looking for all sorts of ways to use it.

review/summary: Best of its kind
review/text: This tea is similar to Market Spice, Good Earth Original and Hobee's Cinnamon Orange iced tea, but I prefer it to any of those. It has a very smooth character and full body with a nice balance of cinnamon, cloves and orange. It's not subtle by any means and honestly the actual black tea flavor is a bit steamrolled by the aromatics, but I really like it. It is surprisingly sweet; I don't know if there is sugar in here, but it tastes like it.<br /><br />The packaging is very attractive, though I recommend cutting the adhesive band that holds the lid on--if you try to peel it off, it'll split and leave white adhesive residue on the pretty black tin.

review/summary: cozy, delicious tea for the cinnamon lover.....
review/text: What a lovely tea this is!  The tea is a blend of three types of cinnamon, cloves and orange mixed with black tea.  It is perfect for a dreary day, or as we get out here in the bay area, those foggy days where you just want to cozy up to a nice cup.<br /><br />I especially love this tea with a bit of sugar and just a splash of milk.  It's definitely for those that like a bold tea, full of aromatic spices.<br /><br />This also was my first tea purchase of Harney & Sons teas.  I had tried a tea-room that used their teas and they were so wonderful that I felt I had to bring one home to try that I hadn't had a chance to sample.  I would most definitely purchase more teas from Harney & Sons.  They are highly aromatic, delicious and would make a nice purchase for yourself, or pair up with some other tea goodies, for a lovely gift for a friend.

My sister gave me some to try and I can't get over how good it is.  It's like eating some kind of sinfully, delicious dessert, only without all the bad, empty calories.  I add honey to it, but really- you don't even need to add a sweetener.  It can stand alone.  This has the most heavenly aroma too.  But if you're only so-so on cinnamon- BEWARE.  This has intoxicating amounts of cinnamon.  Delicious!  Now, where can I get some more...

review/text: These bars would have been perfect had they not been so heavily loaded with sugar. I had better satisfaction with a 3 Musketeers bar, no kidding. Why not a "diet" version, or a diabetic version using artificial sweetener?  Maybe they possibly do fill you up but only for a few minutes...  they set off that blood sugar spike:  Eat one then you want another!  That's the  infamous "high glycemic index" in demonstration for you. When I realized I couldn't maintain with them, I gave them to the whole family. They all went through them super fast.  At least it was a tasty good riddance!  Will be buying any sugar free high protein MR bars instead.

review/summary: good product, satisfies my hunger :)
review/text: I already wrote a review for the chocolate chip ones, though I thought I was writing it for this flavor, so I will just copy and paste. THe both taste good.<br /><br />I bought these bars as a meal replacement, since I am usually hungry about 4 hours after I had lunch, or 2-3 hours after breakfast, so I have to survive before the next meal. This does the job well. I can stay without eating for another 2-3 hours. It also depends how much water you drink, sometimes all you need is water to get rid of the "hunger". It's the way your body tells you you need water as well.<br /><br />My stomach is somewhat sensible and doesn't like a lot of stuff, but these bars never bother me.<br /><br />I also think they are tasty, but only the chocolate ones. I tried the strawberry ones, but they are too creamy. I also liked the chocolate chip ones, they both taste similar, though the chocolate chip ones have more fiber than these ones :P

review/summary: Big fan of these bars.
review/text: These bars are very tasty.  I mean, they're not a candy bar, and they don't taste quite so good as a candy bar.  They are a bit drier on the inside, in particular.  However, they are much more satisfying than a candy bar, and they are still very sweet.  While a single bar is not a whole day's worth of food, one can get by for quite a while on one, without the sugar crash I experience after eating sweets.  The only gripe I have about Special K is that I wish they could have a "diet" option in which they reduce the calorie content with the addition of some artificial sweetners.  Nonetheless, these are the best "meal bars" I have had, and I have tried a bunch of different brands (south beach, atkins, fiber 1, etc.).

review/summary: Staple of my diet
review/text: I eat these on a daily basis, they're that good. I can go weeks of having one or two a day until I start getting burned out, and after a couple of days I'm always ready for another. Special K meal bars have just the kick to last those extra two hours at the end of the day, or replace a junky fast-food breakfast. I feel like I've had a lot less problems with fatigue and stress since I've started keeping one handy all the time; when I start to get tired and grouchy I pop one open, get a short jog around the building, and I'm good to go. I go through about 2-3 boxes a month. After hundreds of bars I'd say the taste and texture could be improved just a little, but they're the only bar I've liked so much, while costing so little, that I eat it constantly. Never had a stale one. Get the subscription, it's so worth it.
