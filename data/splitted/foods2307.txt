review/summary: Unappetizing Pink Biscuits Torpedo This Odd Variant on Shredded Wheat
review/text: It's not quite as bad as I expected, but the Strawberry Delight flavor of the Frosted Mini-Wheats suffer most from how it looks, the unnatural pink color dyed into the wheat biscuits in such a way as to make them wholly unappetizing. Otherwise, it offers a sweetened taste that barely reminds me of real strawberries, at least to the point where you wonder what the point is to this variation from Kellogg's. One 42-gram serving, a mini-box, equals a higher-than-average 140 calories but only five are from fat. The other good news is that there is no measurable sodium and cholesterol to the cereal. I would think adding real strawberries or even dried berry variations would be preferable to this cereal, so I think I'll leave this as a pass.

review/summary: Too sweet for me to snack on
review/text: I don't drink milk but I do snack on cereals directly from the box.  This product might be just fine with milk--I can't tell.  But, as a snack it was too overpoweringly sweet for me.  I like strawberry as much as the next person.  Of course, there's tons of wheat (they ARE min-wheats) so lots of gluten.  As a commercial (vs. health-type) food, it's got sugar as it's second largest ingredient.  It also has bunches of questionable ingredients--artificial this and that, but some added vitamins too.  You might very well love this; I didn't.

review/summary: A little bit different type of mini wheat.
review/text: When mini-wheats first came out in the grocery store, I tried them. However, I found they were bland. It was like trying to eat sticks in milk.<br /><br />Then came "frosted" mini-wheats. Okay, I decided to give it a go. Now I had sticks and sugar in milk. However, I did find out that if you forego the milk and just eat them straight from the box, like potato chips, they are excellent!<br /><br />Now Kellogg's has added fruity flavors to the mini-wheat. THESE I CAN EAT IN MILK! Yippee! Finally!<br /><br />I picked up the "Strawberry Delight" in bite size. Even though I can eat them in milk, I find that I still prefer just to eat them straight from the box, like potato chips, a type of chex-mix, or square wheat thin snack.<br /><br />Each serving has 140 calories. Compare that to other cereals and you'll see it is about 60 - 100 calories less. No saturated fat. No trans fat. No cholesterol. No sodium. Total fat is only 0.5g according to the box. I don't see how, since zero and zero is, well, zero. But I can live with 0.5g.<br /><br />Here is the bad news, the carbohydrates. There are 35g of carbs here. But that is about the same as all the other brands. Diabetics may want to pass on this due to the 10g of sugar per serving. And remember, a single serving is about the size of HALF a base ball. Not much. So if you are just pouring cereal into a "cereal bowl" without measuring, you are probably getting 2 or 3 servings in that one bowl.<br /><br />All-in-all, unless you are diabetic, this mini-wheat is terrific!<br /><br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.

review/text: As a fan of frosted Mini-Wheats I love trying all the new flavors and the strawberry delight flavor was on my mind. I expected them to be a little sweeter, but they have a delicate strawberry flavor that tastes very natural. The pink milk looks pretty with these little bites of tasty crunchy wheat floating around. Sort of a pleasing aesthetic experience that makes these perfect for an afternoon snack.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: A fast-track ride on the sugarland express!!
review/text: Okay, they are loaded with sugar, but I rather like a little sugar with my fiber.<br /><br />Having been raised on the typical late 60s/early 70s diet of sugar, grease and salt, I'm unable to choke down a bowl of tree bark and seaweed at 0-dark-thirty. Healthy as it may be, I am not able to live on nuts and berries and chewy, hard foods.<br /><br />The strawberry flavor is quite artificial (which is a pity), but it also has a little zing and if you don't think about it too much, it does kind of remind you of strawberries.<br /><br />Frosted Mini-Wheats are a nice compromise between eating chocolate cake for breakfast (my favorite) or the other end of the health-conscious spectrum, gnawing on those hideously awful grape nuts (otherwise known and described as bite-size gravel bits).<br /><br />As other reviewers have stated, I do NOT eat these with milk, for many reasons. One, I find milk to be one of the nastiest food substances around. Ick. Secondly, it's just not a healthy thing for a human to ingest. That aside, I thoroughly enjoy eating miniwheats right out of the box like a snack. They're full of fiber, quite tasty and not too hard to chew. Speaking as someone who gave up raw vegetables years ago (due to dental woes), the miniwheats are easy on the teeth and good for the body.<br /><br />Another plus is the nutritional ratings. Now, I know these vitamins are just sprayed on in a massive chemical shower whilst rolling down the conveyor belt, but hey, vitamins are vitamins. One serving (24 little miniwheats) have 25% RDA of all the good stuff and 90% of your daily iron needs.<br /><br />Of all the flavors, the organic miniwheats are my favorite but they're a little harder to find than the super-sugary flavors.

review/summary: I like these
review/text: I saw these advertised on TV a couple of months back, and finally got around to giving them a try only last week.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I normally just buy the non-frosted variety of mini-wheats, but find myself having to add so much sugar to them in order to make them edible that it ends up being a very unhealthy breakfast.  Whilst the frosted strawberry delight mini-wheats do have about 10g of sugar per serving, I figure that I'm still getting less sugar at breakfast than I would if I were adding it myself.  So it actually works out as a healthier alternative for me.<br /><br />I can see why many people might find this product too sweet, but for me, it's just about right.  I don't like too much sweetness with my cereal at breakfast time, but neither do I like things too bland.  The mini-wheats are fairly evenly flavored, and whilst they don't really taste all that much of strawberry, they do taste sweet and nicely fruity.<br /><br />Be warned that these will send your milk pink, though!  The pink coloring might be a bit off-putting to some people, but it doesn't really bother me.<br /><br />A single serving size is about 24 wheat pieces, which is more than enough for me at breakfast.  Then again though, I do not have a particularly big appetite-especially not at breakfast-and others might find the amount a little lacking.<br /><br />My husband rather enjoys eating these as a snack, without milk.  In fact, he's almost consumed half a box already just by "grazing" whenever he goes into the kitchen.  I can't complain too much though-at least it's getting him his daily fiber allowance!  I don't really enjoy these without milk.  I find eating them to be too much like eating sugared straw.  Even when I add my milk, I always like to wait a few minutes for them to soften before I start eating.<br /><br />In finishing then, these are pretty good, so long as you're willing to accept that their so-called "strawberry flavor" isn't all that strong.  If you're looking for a healthier breakfast choice, this probably isn't for you, since the sugar content is quite high (and doesn't include milk!).

review/text: I don't find these to be too sweet, but I am a bit of a sugar addict, so I don't know that my opinion counts in that matter. I wouldn't put these into the same category as regular mini-wheats; these are definitely different. They do have a bit of an artificial taste to them, but you really don't notice it unless you're really thinking about it. For me, it's a nice alternative to those boxed strawberry shortcake rolls that are so amazing. The color and flavor of the biscuits leave your milk with a Nesquick flavor, which I find rather pleasant. If you're looking for something sweet in the morning but don't want to go as far as donuts, this is great! I find the best time to enjoy them is late night when I'm craving something like ice cream. It's nice to get that flavor and sweetness I'm looking for without ruining my diet. I would definitely recommend.

review/summary: Sweet, but good
review/text: This is just okay for me.  I love Mini Wheats but some of these new flavors like this one are just a wee bit over the top. The sweetness probably isn't any moreso than the other sweetened variety, but with the strawberry flavoring, it really heightens that sugar taste and really needs to be taken down quite a bit.  It's good, but I'd like it better if they'd just make it less sweet and I know they can because they did it with Special K.  Hope you're listening Kellogg's!  I recommend them, but for adults, it might be a little much.

I have always liked Frosted Mini-Wheats, but there's nothing like this. Once you try it, you'll be hooked like me.<br /><br />Now, I've tried the other two flavors... Cinnamon and Brown Sugar something or other... neither do Strawberry Delight Justice and actually both are a bit too Cinnamony.

review/summary: What are these cereal bits in my candy?
review/text: When I opened my first box of Strawberry Delight Frosted Mini Wheats this morning, I thought I had bought something other than cereal by mistake.  I was expecting something like the usual Frosted mini wheats, with the exception of some pink frosting and perhaps some strawberry flavor.<br /><br />How wrong I was.<br /><br />Instead, I got a little square of frosting, colored by a pink not found on this Earth and "scented" the with the strongest chemical candy perfume that I have ever had the misfortune to come across. It hovered over the box like a pink cloud before taking out a mallet and knocking me into a diabetic coma. There were a few twigs of what was supposed to be cereal, but it was abundantly clear that the frosting is the reason for this stuff, and the twigs are merely a crumb being thrown to caring parents, so they will serve this stuff instead of a nutritious meal. Indeed the only nutritional claim on the box is wrong: the box says that one serving contains 25% of a day's allowance of fiber, when the nutritional information clearly says a serving of this stuff  has only 20% of a day's allowance of fiber. Which one is it?<br /><br />I don't think that the fiber question will matter to the other reviewers,  with most of them eating the confection out of hand as a snack.  Sadly that means they are getting a whole heck of a lot more than the suggested serving of 24 tiny squares of frosting. Happily, that means they'll likely get a whole day's supply of fiber, but they'll also end up with a week's supply of sugar.<br /><br />Once in a while, I have order food from Amazon that does not suit my taste.  This cereal is one of those items.  Usually, I donate the unopened packages to the local food pantry and count it as some good coming from my lesson.  I can't even do that with these this so-called cereal.  In poor homes, the children already consume too many processed foods and simple carbohydrates (sugar, in this case).  I am not going to add to the bad eating habits of the next generation.

review/summary: Good Vaue
review/text: This is a good working blanket.  It is well made, good materials, and nice and warm but breathable.  I bought mine for my young dog who has no undercoat for when we walk in the pre dawn cold, and for my older dog who just can't regulate his body temperature as well anymore.  My older dog seems comfortable lying down in it, but I've noticed it does restrict shoulder movement in my younger dog.  Make sure you measure your dog and go with the sizes recommended by the manufacturer.  I bought the XL for my guys, though I wouldn't consider either of them "extra large" dogs (65 and 70 pounds).  For five stars I would want to see better tailoring around the back so that it "hugs" the dog better, and cross straps instead of the single strap around the body.  And some people won't like not being able to pick the color, though that wasn't an issue for us.

review/summary: Works great! But how does it compare to Solofill?.... Read on
review/text: This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups.  I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive.  I really love this product and I really can't find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you're curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it's compatible with both of these products.  If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :)<br /><br />EcoBrew VS Solofill<br /><br />First off, I'd like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew.  Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker.  These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they're reusable!  I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product.  The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it's very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it's capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn't be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own "stand" in order to fill it properly.

review/summary: This filter works PERFECT!
review/text: Seriously, I love my Keurig. I love the convenience and the coffees. But what I don't love is buying $50 dollars worth of coffee every month. I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the "old fashion way" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size.<br /><br />I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Amazon, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don't feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won't be sorry.<br /><br />The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse. No scrubbing or anything. I may buy another to have one handy to fill while the other is brewing since I make about 3 Kcups worth of coffee in the morning to fill for two travel mugs for the wife and I. THANK YOU ekobrew!

review/summary: Ekobrew Washer Hack
review/text: When first ordering a couple of ekobrew cups, I had high hopes that they would make my recent hand-me-down Keurig B44 a viable alternative to my Cuisinart drip machine. But, my hopes were quickly dashed upon first use. The second cup wasn't much better. Third time's a charm, right? Wrong. Things were just not good.<br /><br />I experienced many of the same problems that are mentioned in other reviews: leaky, messy brew, and weak coffee. I was pretty disappointed in the prospects of my new Keurig adventure, but was also determined to make this work and, after some experimentation, I did. The solution is a tiny washer.<br /><br />If you look inside the upper clamshell of your Keurig machine, you'll see the injector needle that punctures the top of standard k-cups. Around this needle is a gasket that presses against the top of k-cups to form a seal. This gasket is the problem. It does not put enough pressure on the cap of the ekobrew to form an adequate seal, causing water and coffee to spew out from the cap. To fix this, slide the gasket down and off of the injector needle (use caution as the needle is sharp), slide a washer up onto the needle, then slide the gasket back on. Your leaky, messy brew should now be a thing of the past.<br /><br />The washer hack also made my coffee noticeably stronger, but additional solutions may be required to satisfy your desired strength. Prior to putting in the washer, I began tamping the coffee in the ekobrew cup. That helped, and I still continue to tamp even after the installation of the washer.<br /><br />The washer I used is rubber, 1/16" thick, 5/32" inside diameter, and 3/8" outside diameter. Specifically, I used a washer from Lowes with item number 136493.

review/summary: Good Product and Excellent Customer Service
review/text: At first, we did not get along.  It spit and spewed in our B60 and made me mad that I had paid full price for two of these new K-cup replacements.  Good coarse grind, check.  No grounds around lid before closing, check.  Not too full, check.  Seated properly in Keurig, check.<br />My best guess was that the lid was not sealing properly because there was a little wiggle room when closed, so I contacted the company by email and asked if a replacement seal would help.  I was delighted when they offered to send replacement Ekobrews.  The next morning, we tried something different.  We removed, cleaned and replaced the rubber piece that surrounds the needle that inserts into K-cups in the top of the machine.  That helped, a lot.  The next cup we decided to try turning the Ekobrew around so that the hinge was at the front of the machine.  Perfection!  I cannot explain why, but it worked.  I did let them know right away that replacements were not necessary, but they were already in the mail!<br />We now have an alternative to K-cups that makes a great tasting cup of coffee, can handle enough to brew a nice strong travel mug full and is easy to fill and clean.  We will continue buy K-cups when the price is right, but when it isn't we can still have great, single cup coffee without breaking the bank.<br />Just as a note, we tried the Solofill, which is a good product, but it just did not hold quite enough coffee for a happy mug.

First off, the flat bottom makes it easy to fill. I usually run two cycles for a larger cup of coffee. With the Ekobrew the lid stays shut and doesn't leak water at the top. I was surprised how easily the grounds came out and just a quick rinse and it was ready to go again. Seems to be the best choice around for avoiding the high cost of K cups.

review/text: This one is well thought out - perfect in every way!  I threw my old "My K-cup" out in the trash.  Did you know that some of the new Keurig brewers, such as the B-40, were redesigned a little?  Yes, and the new brewers don't allow the My K-Cups from Keurig to fit properly.  I called Keurig on this - and their customer service team says "some of the brewers were redesigned with slight changes that don't allow the My K-Cups to fit.  You have to move a small gasket down each time you switch between your K-Cups and your My K-Cup.  We don't have a new My K-Cup that works - so you need to just use this "work around" for the time being."  Now with my Eco-Brew - problems solved!  That's because it's the exact same size as the K-Cups!  No more changing the adapter in and out.  It works better too!  Coffee is stronger!  No more "hole down the middle" with weak coffee and wasted grounds that were never used.  Whoever designed this was a genius..... and too bad for Keurig they didn't think of it!

review/summary: AH-MAZING!!
review/text: WOW - we got our keurig as a gift and with the gift was a big box of the k-cups with all the eh, average tasting coffees...but once those ran out we would never be the people to spend that much money on coffee every month. so we have been using the solofil for about 8 months. we hated it and because of it, hated the keurig. the coffee we buy (the strongest roast from starbucks) was always watery and the solofil would leak all the time and it was such a pain to clean. but we put up with it. ENTER the ekobrew! omg this thing is amazing. i don't know what makes it so much different and i don't care -i just care that we get an amazing cup of coffee from our machine now!  SUCH  a difference. we used to use the solofil twice for one cup of coffee - we would make two of the smallest cups to make it as strong as possible. not anymore!! highly recommend! buying 2 more!

review/summary: Techno-BEST
review/text: My disclaimer- I'm a coffee geek.  There's a few precursors to this Keurig brew basket, including what Keurig sells at Costco with the machine.  The advantages to all of them is getting the coffee you want, getting it at less than 1/2 the price and saving the planet with less waste. Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup.  This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion.  It's easy to hold and get out of the machine.  The puck comes out clean without digging out crevices as an earlier.  This is the first one I've seen with a rubber O-ring that seals the cup shut.  Ingenious.  Kudos to these guys.

review/summary: Excellent brew, economical too!
review/text: With the price of coffee continually rising, I've been on a search for a replacement to the expensive K cups for some time.  Their recent price increase is outrageous IMHO (I mean, how much coffee is really in there to justify the recent 15% or so increase?).  I've tried the My K-cup from Keurig.  It did ok, coffee was a little weak, and it was a bit of a hassle to swap out the holder and then cleaning out the grounds as well.<br /><br />I moved onto the EZ-cup pod holster, using tea filter bags.  This eliminated much of the mess, but the coffee quantity is a little low resulting in a weaker cup (but similar to the My K-cup).  Plus, I had to buy the bags and we're trying to save money here.<br /><br />Next came the solofill, but again, the coffee quantity is a little lower than I like.  Cleaning out the solofill isn't hard, but it takes longer than it should, due to the nooks/crannies in there.  Still better than the My K-cup as you don't have to pop out the holder.<br /><br />Ok, on to the the ekobrew.  They obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this thing.  The cutouts are exactly where they need to be and the water flows out more evenly thru the grounds.  Because of this design, there is a little more room in there for the grounds resulting in a better brew.  I've only used this a few times, but cleanup is easier than the My K-cup and solofill.  I would guess it's because the design is flatter on the bottom and the sides seem straighter.  Not quite as convenient as the EZ-cup, but it's a better cup and cheaper.<br /><br />I'll be looking into getting another one of these!

review/summary: Delicious - and there's plenty of it!
review/text: This stuff is extremely tasty and can sometimes be hard to find in anything larger than a rather-expensive 2oz bottle.  I finally took the plunge and bought myself the gallon.  I can now dispense it liberally on whatever grub I so choose, and the fact that this stuff is now practically "on tap" in my kitchen means that I'm now trying it out in some recipes - I tossed some chicken wings in this, let them soak in it for a while, then stirred in some melted butter, plucked the wings out and put them under the broiler - delicious.<br /><br />One thing - Tabasco - if you're listening - start selling a pump that screws onto the bottle.  We'll use it faster and buy more sauce.

review/summary: Super Sized for convenience
review/text: This bottle Is Definately a Supersized Convenience for anyone that uses a Lot of Tabasco. I've had mine for a couple of months now and have only used about a quarter of it, and I use a lot of Tabasco (about a standard 5oz bottle every three to four weeks). I've been refilling my standard size bottle as needed (twice so far). I also add direct from the Gallon to my ketchup via a 60 cc MONOJECT syringe which I also use to refill my standard 5oz bottle (Pull the plunger and replace the cap to fill it then replace the plunger). It's not a very convenient size unless you use a lot of Tabasco, but if you do, it the best way to buy it.

review/summary: The Best...
review/text: I am a fan of spices... No one has what Tabasco has. The healthiest out there. Only 30 mg of salt per spoon. Others not only cannot compete with Tabasco's taste but they have 200 plus mg of salt in each spoon. That is ridiculous amount of salt. Do not need to refrigerate the Tabasco bottle for one year at all so you can leave it outside at room temperature.  I have been using Tabasco for 40 years all over the world. I add <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HNS55A">TABASCO brand Pepper Sauce - Original Red Gallon</a> to all my dishes since it is the spiciest of all. It is not thick like the Chipotle but it is very unique test when I am making dishes that have many different ingredients since it mixes well. I add <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HNZRKQ">TABASCO brand Chipotle Pepper Sauce - Gallon</a> to the tortilla pizza that I make with cheese and herring since this is heavier and tastier but not as spicy as the original red or green. I add the green <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HNQV2Y">TABASCO brand Green Jalapeno Pepper Sauce - Gallon</a> with anything that I make with eggs including the egg sandwich in between tortillas since this is the best with eggs. I love beans and lintels so after cooking those I add serrano chilli pepper deeped in Italian vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, eggplant and the Habanero <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HO0F1Q">TABASCO brand Habanero Sauce - Gallon</a> and I can tell you that becomes real hot. I place the mix in between hot tortilla with avocados for consumption. Now that does not mean that I am limited with these food selections since many times I may mix all those Tabascos together. Regardless, I have never been disappointed since it is truly delicious, spicy, hot without all the garbage and additives that it is out there in other brands without the taste. I have a very healthy diet and I consume healthy food without additives. Thanks and Double bravo to Tabasco.

I thought the price was more than reasonable for a package, but I incorrectly assumed (because I did not read well) that I would be getting about 12 whole nutmegs, instead of 12 packages of 4-6 nutmegs each.  Thankfully this product will last forever if kept in a cool dry place. I will be sharing with my friends, since I don't believe I could even finish 2 packages by the end of my life. The taste supersedes any of the ground product I have purchased.

review/summary: Better than fresh
review/text: I am on disability and do not get out frequently (once every 3-6 weeks) so I have been experimenting with longer shelf life foods that I can buy for a reasonable price that are delivered to my home.  For years, I have been making quick microwave soups from scratch and I have found that while meats can be easily frozen, vegetables can not be bought in bulk for long term without a lot of waste.  There are all sorts of veggies available at Amazon, a bunch at this vendor, that are remarkably flavorful AND economical.  This clelery tastes to me just like fresh when used in my soups and for $2 you can't go wrong.  Barry Farm Foods also sells dried jalapenos (excellent--kept for cooking only cause I ALWAYS have 5-6 cans on hand for table use), onions, shallots, sour cream powder, cheese powder, etc. which I have all tried and endorse.  There are also dried mushrooms but I have not hit on the type that suits me as yet.  The trick to these dried vegetables is to soak them before hand in boiling water, if planning to cook the entree quickly, to ensure that they get fully rehydrated. Longer cooking times don't require soaking.  Beef stew made with dried vegetables, frozen peas, frozen strips of beef and some sour cream powder makes a wonderful dinner in less than 1/2 hour, with prep since anything dried will already have been chopped, diced, sliced or maybe smashed to ensure effective drying.

review/summary: Excellent Flavor....Buy Multiple Units.
review/text: I have many reviews for Barry Farm products here on Amazon.  Maybe a dozen or so.  If they are not the largest distributor of dried veggies, spices, herbs, etc, than they have to be very close.  I became familiar with Barry Farm products many years ago when I first started doing a lot of hiking.  Their freshness, convenience, and flavor has made them a regular staple carry along on my hikes.  This dehydrated celery stalk and leaf is one that I probably use the most for any camp cooking.  Simply because there is not a soup or stew that I make that doesn't include celery at home. This stalk and leaf product is an excellent alternative to fresh celery that for obvious reasons is not a practical take along on the trail. This product is very flavorful, and a little of it goes a long ways.  I would even  venture to say that in the wilderness, or even at home, this dried celery has even more flavor than fresh any time.  I think it may have something to do with the fact that this is dried from both celery stalks and leafs.  The leaf being something that most of us don't bother with at home.  Every time I have used this in a stew or soup I have easily tasted the celery distinctly in the most delicious of trail concoctions.  As I said before, a little of this goes a long ways. A 2 oz. package gets me easily through three large one pot meals on my hiking trips.<br /><br />The only downside to this and all Barry Farm items is the shipping.  This celery goes for around $2.00 a package but costs around $7.00 to ship.  All Barry Farm products are expensive in the shipping sense for a reason I have never really figured out.  But it's very easy to make this and any other Bary Farm purchase easily a bargain by combining either 3 or more bags of this, or anything else from them.  You can actually order 6 of these celery bags for around a dollar more in shipping than the cost for just one.  I routinely order at least a couple of several products at once and end up paying close to the actual price per unit that way.  I highly recommend this very flavorful and convenient celery talk and leaf, as well as combining the shipping on this and or all Barry Farm products.  It will help make you some of the best one pot meals you are to ever enjoy...

review/text: Despite the, previous, scathing review from someone who does not even like black licorice...(What kind of dummy eats black licorice and then complains about it tasting like black licorice???)...I have to say that these are very good, fresh and not too sweet little dogs...They are truly the taste of American licorice as opposed to the European varieties that differ in old fashion licorice taste.  The texture is chewy, but not too soft or sticky.  They are a tad less sweet than &quot;See's Licorice Medallions&quot;, but just as flavorful.  The only reason I don't give them a five star rating is because I believe that it belongs to the &quot;King&quot; of all licorices, the discontinued, Heidi/Hershey dome shaped drops, with the imbossed diamond on the top. They were what real, old fashion, American licorice was all about and what made several generations of Dentists rich with their, &quot;near Ju-Ju-Be&quot; chewy-ness and deep licorice flavor... I'd sure appreciate it if someone were to start making them again! In the meantime, these little black dogs will impress the licorice lover, but not the dummies who eat what they don't like!

review/text: I needed a grain free canned dog food (to mix with grain free dry food) for one of my dogs because of allergies but I also wanted diet bacause I use it to entice my dogs to eat their dry food and the canned makes this easier, so smell and flavor is important.  The quality of the food is very good and they seem to really like the flavor of the diet chicken and sweet potato.  I mix it with the Natural Balance LID Lamb and Brown Rice.  So far I am really pleased with the quality of the food and my dogs seem to like it.

review/summary: Ended huge health issues! great product
review/text: We rescued an abandoned dog that was in very poor health condition. We had to give him a bath everyday because he smelled, and he was constantly licking, digging, scratching, it drove us crazy, not to mention scabs all over. The vets were no help, told us to keep his hair short and give him the pills he prescribed, after a few months of this it didn't improve and we were desperate.<br />As luck would have it, we found a relative that happens to be a graduate in Animal Science and told us that the issue was related to food allergies, and recommended this brand. We balked at the high price but decided to try it for a month.<br />What a miracle! Oddie (that is what we named him) rapidly healed, and by the end of the month was almost 100% cured. People can't believe it is the same dog, he is much happier and his coat looks beatiful.<br />I highly recommend this for anyone, it truly has made me wonder what junk is in the "main stream" food products for pets. Well worth the extra cost.

review/summary: My old almost toothless dog loves it!
review/text: My 12 year old Toy Fox Terrier who is missing all but 6 teeth also has a sensitive stomach. The wrong food will make him vomit or go on a grass eating fast. The ingredients in this food are quality, and the limited ingredients are easier for him to digest. I have also been told that grain free is easier on aging kidneys and liver; both of which have been a problem for my old dog. This is his favorite flavor, but the Venison is also yummy (to him, I've never tried it)

review/summary: Vet Recommended Food
review/text: Our Vet is very much into quality nutrition for our pets and recommended this dog food.  Right away you can see the difference from a good quality food as opposed to the bargin brand.  The food is so clean and doesn't stick to the can like the cheaper ones that are filled with grease and fat and all kinds of other horrors you need to know about.  Do you know that our dogs and cats have been eating diseased animals, in addition to eating the remains of their own species who have been euthanized.  Did you know that the makers of dry dog and cat food spray used grease on the food to make it more palatable?  Well, they do.  These things and more are what we've been unknowingly feeding our pets...food so dangerous that the incidents of cancer amoung our cats and dogs is running rampent.  Quality food may cost more, but I'd rather pay a little extra than have one more of my pets die from cancer.  Do yourselves and your beloved pets a favor, feed them a good quality food.  Others besides Natural Balance include Royal Canin and Blue Buffalo, plus more.  The higher priced foods in your grocery stores (Iams, Science Diet) are on the list of BAD foods.  Do a little research, you'll be shocked by what you discover. I highly recommend this food.

review/text: I really hate that I bought this stuff.  I originally bought it to try the Master Cleansing diet.  After I read the book it sounded like a bad idea so I put it on some pancakes instead.  It was so good I'm not sure I can ever go back to that flavored corn syrup they sell in the stores.  Now my pancake habit is sure to cost me both extra dollars and extra pounds.  I'm not sure why anyone would buy grade A...grade B tastes incredible.

review/text: I was a little hesitant to order ths, since Grade B is described as having a "stronger" flavor than Grade A, and often used in cooking.  I am delighted to report the flavor is NOT to strong, and is perfect on pancakes and waffles.  This syrup is of excellent quality at a good price, and I will continue to order it.  I pity those folks out there who think Log Cabin or Mrs. Butterworth's is what you're supposed to use on your pancakes.

review/summary: Very high quality
review/text: We have been using this brand of maple syrup for over 6 years.  The B grade has more minerals than A grade.  We use this syrup when we fast occasionally; I use it in cooking muffins weekly and my husband loves it on bread and even uses it to sweeten his cereal.  We have tried other maple syrups but find Shady Maple Farms Organic Maple Syrup to be superior.  I also love ordering this product from Amazon because the shipping is sometimes zero and often very low and therefore is cheaper than buying in local retail stores.  JJ, Fairview, TX

review/text: There are a lot of good real maple syrups available, but this is the best syrup bottle design I've ever come across.  The cap pops open and has a nice spout set into a "well" - somewhat similar to the design of a no-drip laundry detergent bottle.  Any excess syrup goes back into the bottle, and it doesn't build up around the edge of the cap.  No sticky caps - even on the last pour.

review/text: I love the thickness and robust richness of this syrup.<br />However, it has a slightly bitter edge to it that takes some of the maple joy out of using this on pancakes, waffles, and oatmeal.  I give it 3 stars for using on these foods (which is what most people use syrup for).<br />It is a very good syrup for baking...rich enough that it doesn't get lost among other ingredients.  I give this 5 stars for baking.

review/text: I buy this maple syrup every time I do a Master Cleanse.  I love that it is organic and the taste, to me, is perfect.  Some grade B syrups are very disappointing by being too dark and on the molassas side, not this one.  I might also add that my kids love this and always steal it for their pancakes.  Of course that makes me happy because I hate for them to use processed fake syrups since they are so bad for them.

review/summary: Delicious. Why Organic?
review/text: This real maple syrup is FANTASTIC! I'm confused though as to the benefits of it being Organic. I want to believe that it being organic makes it better quality, but it tastes the same as natural maple syrup. Neither has added ingredients, preservatives, or residual pesticides to my knowledge. So while I love this organic version, I will probably opt in the future for a cheaper natural alternative, unless someone gives me a good reason for sticking to the organic kind.

review/text: This order arrived in a timely fashion and in one piece and not broken due to being packed improperly (as has happened in the past). It is delicious maple syrup and has a deep maple flavor.  Grade B has more flavor than Grade A.  If I could order grade C with an even deeper maple flavor, I would order that, if possible!  I am very happy with this syrup. The local stores has 32-oz of maple syrup for the same price, but they only carry Grade A.

Before I placed my second order tonight I found an off brand of Grade B MS at a local store I shop at once in a while. It was 14.00 for a 13 oz bottle, that convinced me what a great buy this was, and with the order of two there is no s/h charges!

review/summary: It works!
review/text: I dont take it to lose weight, this is a laxative tea, as all the ones labeled "weight loss tea" .I'm very constipated and taking this tea everyday has helped me very much, with no cramps or other negative effects. It's strong and dont recommend it for ocassional constipation or for losing weight. Warning: when it works you "have" to go.

review/summary: Watch out for this tea
review/text: Oh my gosh.  I bought this tea and drank my first cup in the late afternoon.  By evening I was having the worst stomach cramps and diarrhea.  I belatedly looked at the ingredients and the first one is senna leaves.  During internet research I discovered that some individuals may experience discomfort or cramping after using senna products.  Also the following admonition - don't take senna for more than a week or so or your body could end up relying on it to contract your bowels.<br /><br />Side effects can include:<br />*diarrhea<br />*intestinal cramps or gripping pains<br />*rash<br />*severe weight loss<br /><br />Senna should not be used by persons with Crone's disease, Diverticular disease and other similar diseases.<br /><br />Senna is not a daily or causal supplement and excessive use can cause liver damage.<br /><br />I wanted to die my insides hurt so bad.  Any weight loss you may accomplish with this tea may not be worth the pain.  Be aware before you use.  I threw my remaining 29 tea bags away!

review/summary: Horrible!
review/text: This is the worst coffee I've ever tasted.  I always buy amaretto-flavored coffee in June for my wedding anniversary since it reminds us of our wedding cake.  This is just terrible.  It tastes a bit like plastic.  I have three unopened bags, and I certainly not going to brew and drink them.  I thought about giving them away, but I don't hate anyone that much.  Is a refund available?

review/text: This coffee had good ratings on Amazon,so I thought it would be a good purchase. I was excited to find the almond amaretto coffe for a reasonable price. I can not find this flavored coffee where I live. When I opened the bag,I was pleased with the aroma, but when brewed the coffee had a very bitter taste. I thought I had just added too much coffee. Next morning,I tried again using a little less coffee. It was still bitter.I have tried different amounts and every time it is BITTER. I have 3 more bags of coffee that I don't like.Can I send them back or get a refund?

review/summary: Oh, It's So Good!
review/text: This amaretto coffee is wonderful, with a nice mellow flavor. The almond flavors are layered between toasted almonds and amaretto flavoring. It became one of my favorite coffees as soon as I smelled it, and when I tasted it, I was hooked. If you like flavored coffees with a true, rich blend, you will love this one.

review/summary: Heavenly!
review/text: Rich, smooth taste with just the right amount of almond flavor.  I wasn't sure how much flavor it would have, but I love amaretto and was very pleasantly surprised.  I usually buy whole bean and grind some as I need it, so I wasn't sure how the ground would work - if it would stay fresh and have a decent taste.  My taste buds were excited as the aroma from the first pot wafted throughout the whole house!.  It keeps well in the freezer, and the last pot from the opened bag was just as good as the first.

review/summary: Best Treats for Your Dog
review/text: These are the best treats for your dog.  I have a very finicky Shih Tzu who thinks she is the Queen of England and is very fussy about food.  She will not touch "dog food" and the only dog treats she will eat are the ones made by Pet 'n Shape.  Amazon's price for these is the lowest anywhere online.  The best price I got the last time I ordered them was $12 for each 16oz container based on an order of 6.  That I got them for $1.40 less for each container with free shipping was positively amazing.  I seem to be doing most of my shopping on Amazon these days and I think Amazon is the best.<br /><br />Fran<br /><br />Westbury, NY

review/summary: My dog loves these!
review/text: They are great as treats. The only thing that I thought was kinda weird was the fact that there seems to be some kind of red coloring or something. At first I thought my dog's gums were bleeding or something but it seems that its just a part of the product. Otherwise, he goes crazy for them so I'm glad I got these.

review/summary: five paws
review/text: I am a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with a long heritage of discriminating taste. Pet'n Shape products are my most favored treats,and I am especially fond of Chik 'n Breast. They are pure chicken with no additives, and, as I am watching my figure, they break easily into smaller morsels, so I can exercise moderation in this delectable indulgence. Ten out of ten of my canine neighbors agree that this reward is well worth obeying a command or two. I give it five paws up.<br /><br />Sincerely, Phoebe
