review/summary: Is this a joke? If I could give it a 0, I would.
review/text: First of all, I am aware that this is made for the gun, however after reading the reviews I purchased it and let me say I have never been more dissapointed. In the picture the gold is brilliant, bold, and intense. When I got this product it was oily in appearance and looked like vinegar in color. I used a paintbrush as I read in a previous review. The color is a yellow, maybe a copper tone---nothing like gold. I used part of this for an anniversary cake--I had to drive to the arts and crafts store to purchase Wiltons Gold shimmer to attempt to cover this disaster. I thought $15 was pretty expensive in the first place, but after using the product I am sure it is not worth a single cent. I cannot believe how grotesque this color is. If I wanted a copper/yellow tone I would have just used edible dye---I sure would have saved the money for something else. I bake hundreds of cakes each year, and I am confident to say that this is the worst item I have ever used. Garbage. I have another bottle that should be arriving in the mail in a couple days for the silver color, I will be sending it right back and getting my money back for sure!

review/summary: Kicks up Grilled Chicken
review/text: This seasoning gave a nice flavor boost to some grilled chicken. Not too spicy but with a pleasant flavor that tickled the taste buds, no one could put their finger on exactly what was the new flavor but everyone loved it. I would buy it again.<br /><br />UPDATE: Here it is almost the middle of June and I'm about to re-order this seasoning, we are addicted to it! When the first order came in I figured we wouldn't use all of it so I shared with friends before I tried the seasoning. Once I started using it we discovered we love it and now we are almost out of it. Last night I made roast beef and this was the only seasoning I used on the chunk of beef, I covered it liberally and cook it as usual only this time hubby raved about the taste, it wasn't the same old, same old roast beef. Give this stuff a try.<br /><br />October 2012.......I just ordered this again, try it on a simple pasta saute with fresh veggies. Gives galic bread a little something extra too. I've tried it in a lot of different dishes and haven't been disappointed in any of them. Hopefully Amazon will continue to carry this as I have never seen it in any local store.

review/text: I have used this soap for over 20 years. It is very difficult to find outside of an Asian grocery store. I was thrilled to find it here on Amazon, as it is a most delightfully-scented bath and face soap. It has a clean, light scent, Is easy on your skin and leaves no residue after rinsing. I have been recommending this soap for years to anyone with acne problems, as it dries the excess oils from your body without drying out your skin.

review/summary: Good taste, unideal ingredients
review/text: First of all, just because you see "dark chocolate" and "blueberries" doesn't make something healthy. Adding lots of sugar and processed, non-organic milk to raw cacao and/or blueberries quickly reduces their potential health benefits. (Plus corn syrup, etc.) Also, these are NOT all-natural ingredients in the sense of "from nature," as many of these ingredients are highly processed. They do not have any artificial colors or flavors though. (But "natural flavor" can mean a lot of things, and these include natural flavor.)<br /><br />Anyway, I was specifically disappointed not to find any ingredient labels online, even at Emily's website (so I've listed them below), but did want to try out the taste of these and the strawberries as well. The strawberries were much better. The blueberries had sort of a funny taste to me; some actually were pretty good, and then you'd get one that really DIDN'T taste good. Of course this is subjective, but I like the strawberries better. Both are pretty good, considering that they're packaged fruit.<br /><br />For those wanting the ingredient list before buying them, here's what the package says:<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: Dark Chocolate (sugar, chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, milk fat, soy lecithin added as an emulsifier, and vanilla), Dried Blueberries (blueberries, sugar, natural flavor, citric acid, sunflower oil), Corn Syrup, Tapioca Dextrin, Confectioner's Glaze (refined lac.).

review/summary: Excellent dark chocolate taste, without as much guilt!
review/text: Emily's Dark Chocolate Covered Blueberries are a real treat. It's definitely rich dark chocolate, so you won't want to eat the whole bag in one sitting. The blueberries are dried inside, but they're still soft and they have the consistency of any other dried fruit, like Craisins. For some reason I don't feel as guilty for eating this "candy" because blueberries and dark chocolate are both chock full of anti-oxidants. I can't help but be sort of partial to them since they are "Emily's" brand (which is my first name, too). :)<br /><br />The ingredients are simple: dark chocolate, blueberries (dried blueberries, high fructose corn syrup/sugar, malic acid, natural flavor, citric acid, and sunflower oil), corn syrup, tapioca dextrin, and confectioner's glaze. 26 of these little goodies is 180 calories, 8 g of fat, 5 g saturated fat, 28 total carbs (2 fiber, 23 sugar), 1 g protein. 4% of your daily vitamin C, Calcium and Iron.<br /><br />These would make a great gift, and they're not overly expensive for a gourmet treat. Not to mention, they're a nice change of pace from the typical chocolate covered pretzels, cheese logs, or whatever else comes in  typical food gift baskets. You could easily order a variety of "Emily's" items and make your own gourmet basket for a friend!<br /><br />For more information on Emily's products, visit [...]

review/summary: A Nice Mellow Wash of Turmeric
review/text: Firstly, I may be reviewing a slightly different Nguan Soon curry product than what is being sold. I normally buy this at a wonderful Thai-owned asian market in Lexington. My bottle from Nguan Soon is the same as the picture except the labeling languages are slightly different. I believe there is Vietnamese on mine instead, as it says B't Curry right under Curry Powder. After Googling the word and translating from Vietnamese to French to English, it appears to mean flour or powder. So that is my cautionary notice. Should you buy this powder be aware that my bottle lists as its ingredients the following: turmeric, coriander, cumin, chili, salt, and pepper. It does not mention garlic at all on my bottle but looks identical color wise and the graphic appears the same.<br /><br />I am not entirely sure how to describe the taste other than to compare it to other curries. This particular variety lacks the bite of the other Nguan Soon curries or other branded Thai curry pastes that you may be familiar with from shopping in your local asian market. More than likely you can buy this there as well. It is a mellower, darker colored brownish curry. This is not your average madras yellow curry, not that there is anything wrong with madras curry. I keep both of these on my shelves, and enjoy several other varieties.<br /><br />My wife complains about the high turmeric smell of this one where she is not bothered by the madras variety overly much. However the distinctive brown color this has over yellow leads me to wonder if the ratio of another ingredient is greater than the turmeric even though it is not as persistent a smell. I use this in sandwiches quite often, and just about anything else for its mellow contrast to the standard yellow curry I normally have access to locally. I am probably the closest anyone in this state comes to be being Lister from Red Dwarf while still being alive and lacking the curry-stained clothing. Happy eating.

review/text: Irish Breakfast is my all-time favorite. I drink it very sweet with lots of cream or milk. I've been buying this brand for awhile now and I go through 30-40 bags a month and it was getting a little expensive. I tried Stash, a less expensive grocery store brand, and was pleasantly surprised that it was just as good. Maybe you can tell a difference without cream or sugar...I haven't tried them side-by-side but I do know that I'm very picky about my tea, and I've got a lot of tea in the pantry that I've decided I don't like, but between this and Stash Irish Breakfast, they taste very similar. Decide for yourself I guess.

review/summary: My all time favorite blend of tea, and Harney does it best
review/text: Harney and Sons makes many amazing blends of tea. They have something for everyone in their tea room. This blend is for those who are looking for the perfect black tea. The same way that there are flavored waters and then there is a glass of cool crisp perfect plane water, that's how I would describe this blend. While other teas have flavors and notes of fragrances, this Irish Breakfast is like the perfect plane black tea. Not bitter, perfumey, flowery, minty or anything else. Just the cleanest tasting black tea I have never had. This is the blend to take the place of coffee in the morning. It's also wonderful with meal, as it doesn't change the flavors. Not a fan of Earl Grey? No problem, there's no bergamot in this blend. Love Earl Grey? I would then say definitely try this. You get the same kind of bold black tea taste, just in a blend without the fragrant oils and other notes. While I really enjoy all kinds of teas (English Breakfast, Earl Grey, herbal teas, white teas, etc) this by far my all time favorite blend.

review/summary: Surprised
review/text: I've used a dozen different sculpting goos, gels, pomades, etc. over the years. I probably have $200 worth of half used and abandoned hair products ranging from Chi all the way up to Bumble & Bumble Sumotech. I was at Walmart the other day and they had it for $6 so I grabbed one for the heck of it. I have to say I was absolutely blown away. I had already decided that it would be the standard store-junk thinking that anything non-salon was terrible. I used this glop one time and the Sumotech went right into the drawer of dead hair-products. I couldn't believe how refined this product was! The smell was pleasant and I didn't feel like I was dipping my fingers into old, sticky Crisco. The texture is more like a soft face cream. I ride my bike to work every day in the Florida heat and when I get there my hair is still intact with no sticky crud running into my eyes. It's also non sticky to the touch so you don't feel like you need to run to wash your hands every time you touch your head.<br /><br />Give this stuff a shot. What do you have to lose besides $6? I bet you'll be surprised, too.

review/text: I use this as my main hair cream.  It is better than a sticky gel.  At the end of the day, I can wet my hands and run my fingers through my hair to rejuvenate it and this stuff still holds like new, but it does not feel like concrete.  Very natural and smells nice.  A really well made product.

review/text: It does exactly what it's supposed to and does it very well.  It gives a very natural look and feel. You can put it on wet hair and get a bit of a "slicker" look, but you don't your hair won't get dry and crusty.  It's easy to refresh and a little does go a long way so it has very good value.<br /><br />In fairness I must say this is the first hair cream product I've used.  But, after using gel, mouse, hairspray, spray gel and god knows what else, this is far and away the best hair product I've ever used.

Such a great flavor, after tasting only a few for the first time I immediately orderd three more. These don't even have that "Almond" aftertaste, it finishes very nice with a hint of a butter maple flavor...wow.<br /><br />Now: To Diamond please rename to "Buttery French Toast", as this would be much better fitting.

review/summary: Unique product, well executed
review/text: The flavor of these nuts is similar to cinnamon toast cereal, yet they are filling and healthy, containing little sugar and almost no salt. I would deduct a star for being priced too high both here and in the supermarket, but Blue Diamond deserves credit for their restraint in using quality ingredients and in not producing a sugar encrusted candy. Now if they would only go against the trend of charging a huge markup for minimal extra processing cost...<br /><br />The other reviewer seems to think these contain lactose. The ingredients:<br />ALMONDS, EVAPORATED CANE JUICE, BROWN SUGAR, CORN MALTODEXTRIN, CINNAMON, NATURAL FLAVORS AND SALT. PEANUT FREE. MAY CONTAIN OTHER TREE NUTS. Unless OTHER TREE NUTS comes from cows, I don't think this is true.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about "bowel tolerance" or "happy bowels" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

I will keep buying all their other flavors. The Bold line, especially the Habanero, is also excellent, as are the dark chocolate variety.

review/text: If you want a truly healthy, filling snack, you must give these a try, as well as their sisters, the Vanilla Bean Almonds. They are both just lightly sweetened, and fragrant with either the cinnamon or the vanilla, depending on which you choose. The container is marvelous; there is a half flip top which is easy to do with one hand (like in the car). And they're not roasted in more oil, so the almonds are "meaty" and sweet. And almonds are SOOO good for you. I'd recommend that you try them, and then get an Amazon subscribe and save if you can. It's well worth it! And all natural. LOVELY!

review/summary: Not the same as the canned version
review/text: I expected that these canisters of Blue Diamond "Roasted Almonds - Honey" would be the same product as the little cans of Blue Diamond "Honey Roasted Almonds" ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSZ5PW">Blue Diamond Almonds Honey Roast, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a> ) but they're surprisingly not the same, and have a very "off" taste.  What a disappointment!  Blue Diamond has apparently seen fit to add much more maltodextrin and "other natural flavors", which I suspect cause the odd taste, thus ruining a fabulous product.<br /><br />I've been having a hard time finding the small cans of Blue Diamond "Honey Roasted Almonds" at the supermarkets, despite all the other flavors being carried.  It's as if Blue Diamond just, for some reason, *wants* this product to fail.  First they make it hard to get the canned version, then they completely change the taste of a great product and package it in a canister, using a name that is so similar that it contains all the same words, but without a hint that it's not the same product.<br /><br />I'd contact Blue Diamond and complain, but I already know that they never respond to customers despite having a contact link on their website.  In the past, I wrote to them when they test-marketed and then removed some wonderful silvered almonds (not "slivered" but silvered, as in almonds with a very light sugary coating);  when I wrote to ask, instead of appreciating my interest as a customer, they simply ignored me.<br /><br />So I'm offering this review as a warning to anyone else who might make the same mistake, and think that these almonds will be like the similarly-named canned "Honey Roasted Almonds" from the same company.  The ones in the can are great;  these are just plain awful, and I'll be throwing out 2.9 canisters of 3 purchased.

review/text: This is basically candy masquerading as a "healthy" snack. They taste good - because they have three different kinds of sugar in them! Blue Diamond  wants you to think that eating sugar is a healthy snack - c'mon!<br /><br />I purchased these thinking they were sweetened with stevia. Yeah, there's a miniscule amount of stevia (very last ingredient) - but sugars are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ingredient listed. These have corn maltodextrin - the worst thing there is on the glycemic index (can you say fat formation?). Now I'm stuck with 3 containers of this sugar snack.

review/text: I ordered these lovely almonds a few weeks ago, as I often find myself jonesing for junk food, and I thought that if I had something that was good for me around, I would be less likely to grab something terrible.  These nuts are packed with nutrition, and they taste amazing.  They have just enough flavor to make me want more, but the fact that they are high in fat makes it difficult to eat too many in one sitting; I'm satiated with two handfuls.  I go through one little container every week or so.  They are perfect for anyone concerned with nutrition or trying to put on or keep muscle- they pack 6 grams of protein in 1 oz.  I will definitely be re-purchasing these nuts. I wasn't so keen on the idea of the canisters, as I don't like producing so much waste, but I have purchased nuts (peanuts etc) in the past in bulk, and they did go bad before I finished eating them.<br />These nuts have kept me out of the icecream, chocolate chips, and other naughty sweet things that have little nutritional content.  These nuts taste like they should be bad for you, but they are more similar to vitamins than junk food; read the back for the nutritional content: 35% Vitamin E, 15% Phosphorus, 20% Magnesium, 35% Manganese....the list goes on...:)<br /><br />Update: I ordered my second shipment of these.  I love these and I eat a handful of these almonds after my morning banana yogurt shake and with my vitamins :)

review/text: These are incredible!  Eating these makes me not want to eat candy.  I love these!  The price isn't that great though.  I think Blue Diamond should save money by packaging them in something cheaper than plastic.  I did notice it on Amazon in a box, but the price looks odd - over $50?  Too bad Amazon doesn't stock this, so no Free Shipping.

review/text: The almonds tastes all right. Since it is too dry, the salt can hardly stay on surface. Therefore, it is not salty enough. On the whole, it is a healthy snack. I hope this type of almonds can have subscription service and discount.

review/summary: Butter Toffee almonds are sooo good, but hi-carb
review/text: I've tried several of the Blue Diamond jar almonds and the Butter Toffee almonds are the best.  They would probably be my favorite almond, but they're high-carb. I guess the trick is to only eat a few at a time....  We can all do that, right?  :-)<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewer who said that the Blue Diamond almonds in the cans are better than the ones in the jars -- my favorite are the Vinegar & Salt -- but the Butter Toffee almonds are the exception.

review/summary: The best almonds on earth!!!
review/text: I must say, these almonds have made me a lover of nuts!!!  I have always been a cashew girl and never cared that much for almonds. Well, being on a low carb diet made cashews a no no.  Almonds roasted only with sea salt are soooo good. Blue Diamond makes the best tasting and these are hard to find in stores.  I love the 1 lb bag of these, but can't seem to find them. Buying these in bulk was the best deal out there and I will have to purchase again.  Thanks, Blue Diamond for a superior nut!

review/text: So the hottest-hot-off-the-press recommendation is an ounce of almonds a day will help keep the doctor away.... and for good reason.  They're full of B (and other) vitamins, fiber, --not-cholesterol, not-sodium, not-empty calories, and not tasteless wallpaper paste....<br /><br />But these --- these new Blue Diamond almonds (I've so far tried both the Brown Sugar Cinnamon and the Vanilla -- are soooooo good that it's hard to stop at an ounce.  This has become my after-dinner treat.<br /><br />To help fight the sodium bugaboo, they've instead coated them with a velvet dairy whey based powder (take note, lactose-intolerant folks) that is loaded with flavor.  They're not sweet -- except the sweetness of the lactose.  And they're not the least bit salty.  They taste like a great dessert in both flavor and texture.<br /><br />Thumbs way up -- licking my fingers kind of up.

review/text: All the 5-star reviews convinced me to buy these...I wish I hadn't :(  It's been two months since I purchased them and I still have four out of the six containers unopened.  They're just blah.  Now the chili lime flavored almonds from Blue Diamond, on the other hand, are Mmm Mmm good!

review/summary: Tastes like Pistachios
review/text: These taste good and are edible but I am only giving 1 star to let people know that this product tastes like Pistachios to me, not almonds. I don't know why. If I wanted Pistachios I would've bought them. I had a craving for almonds and these just don't do the trick. They also contain a weird ingredient; CORN MALODEXTRIN. WHY?! They are ALMONDS! All you need is almonds and salt, maybe oil! So much for being "All natural".

review/summary: NOT as good as the ones in the tins
review/text: Local retailers stopped carrying the Blue Diamond Honey Roasted Almonds in the small tins for some time now.  Not planning ahead enough to buy another case, I picked up these in hope that "oven roasted" + "honey" = that same goodness.  NOT TRUE.  These almonds are cloyingly sweet.  They also taste a bit milky, but there are no milk products listed, which just makes the flavor even stranger.  They don't have that crusted on goodness of the tin ones.  However, my 6 year old really likes them and, while I don't have a container to compare, I'm thinking that the lack of crusty goodness *might* make these a somewhat healthier choice for her.  So I give the product 3 stars -  an average of 5 from her and 1 from me.

review/summary: not my favorite
review/text: The delivery was extremely quick, the packaging was fine, and if you suck off all the honey, the almonds even taste pretty good. but i for one do not like this flavor. Mind you, I could eat 3095826 honey roasted PEANUTS.

review/summary: great candy bar, terrible delivery
review/text: My British husband introduced me to this candy bar since they're not readily available in the United States, but they are now one of my favorites. When I saw they were available on Amazon, I was so excited and they were really inexpensive. However, when they box arrived, the bars had completely melted since it wasn't delivered until the end of the day on a very hot June day in Texas. They had ice gel packs included in the packaging but that was no match for a hot Texas summer. I think whoever shipped it should have specified that this package could not be left on a delivery truck all day in the sun.

review/summary: One of my favorite sauces.
review/text: This is one of the best sauces I have ever had.  It isn't your traditional hot sauce, as it has a mustard base, but it goes well on everything from hotdogs and hamburgers to deli sandwiches and fish.  The scotch bonnet peppers give it a nice sweet taste, and then a bit of heat, but not overwhelming.  Since being introduced to this sauce a few years ago, I have always kept at least two bottles on hand, and any time I place an order for more, I have to call all of my friends to see if they need to restock.  Try this sauce!  It is amazing.

review/summary: Absolutely a staple in my cabinet
review/text: I have loved this stuff for years.  I use it almost weekly on shrimp or krab (fake crab) salads and have also used it as a marinade for grilled chicken.  I decided to shop for it online since I have to drive across town to a particular Asian grocery to find it and I thought it would be easier to just have it delivered.  Easier yes, but sometimes the brick and mortar is worth the trek.  With shipping this item would cost at least $7/bottle with a minimum 3 bottle purchase vs. &lt; $3 at a retail store for quantity of one.  Yikes!  It's good, but I'm not sure it's THAT good.  OK, I have to pay sales tax and burn some gas, but I can burn a lot of gas and pay a lot of tax before more than doubling the price.<br /><br />Oh well, try this stuff - you will like it - but shop around before you pay this much!

review/text: I bought this in hopes that it would taste like the dressings served @ my fave Japanese steakhouses.  No such luck.  It was WAY to tart, and was nothing that I hoped.

review/summary: Cherry flavor with a very hot Jalapeno oil finish.
review/text: If you like the flavor of Jalapeno potato chips you will love these.  Addicting even though they are almost too hot for me.  My kids didn't like them but all the adults loved them.  The kids did have fun daring each other to eat a second one. A perfect sweet for the salty chip.

review/summary: POWERFUL ENERGY SHOT
review/text: To properly test the "Stacker 6 Hour Power Energy Shot", I sipped one 45 minutes prior to a double step class at the gym.  I felt energized and flew through the high intensity aerobic workout.  The taste is better than many, the price is quite competitive, and I really appreciated the energy boost without the calories.  Overall, one of the better energy shots that I have tried.

review/summary: Great price, less taste
review/text: I've been a long time imbiber of 5-hour products but thought that this time I would try one of the competitors.<br /><br />As noted by the other reviewers, the cost is much less (about 33% less) than 5-hour which is big plus. The drawback for me was the taste of the Fruit Punch which was watery and thin. Maybe the other flavors are more appealing but I'm not sure I'll try them. Sometimes the extra cost is worth it.

review/summary: Great Dog Chew
review/text: These bones are excellent.  My boxer who usually eats a rawhide bone in one day can enjoy these for several days.  She has had no problems with them, and they help to keep her gums healthy.  They also do not leave a greasy mess on the rug.  This size seems excellent for her size dog (65lbs.)  I will order them again.
