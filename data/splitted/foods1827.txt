review/summary: can't believe this is a Bob's Red Mill product
review/text: Normally I love the Bob's Red Mill products, but I made this one, had a couple slices from it and ended up throwing it out.  It came out hard and barely tasted like cinnamon raisin.  I would recommend a bunch of their other products (especially the pizza mix) but I would advice against buying the cinnamon raisin bread mix.

review/summary: Add 1 bannana for 300% improvement
review/text: The secret to this product is to add one beaten over-ripe bannana.<br />It will then be BREAD rather than BRICK.<br /><br />This may work a bit better when baking in the oven so you can monitor rise-time, but it also improves the product 300% when using a Zoj* bread machine.

review/summary: great bread substitute, but little flavor
review/text: Have tried other BRM products and LOVE them (cookie mix, pizza dough) but this was practically tasteless!  The bread was easy to make and had GREAT texture, so I'll invest another $5 and try to add some flavor (I see that others recommend a ripe banana) such as molasses, honey and/or vanilla and hope for something yummy as well as nicely textured.

review/summary: New to gluten free
review/text: I am new to a gluten free diet and as another reviewer stated missed my occasional piece of toast in the morning.  I purchased the Bob's Red Mill Cinnamon Raisin Bread mix with high hopes due to the reviews as well as the reputation of the company.  I used my bread maker as directed and while it was baking it filled my home with a cinnamon smell that had my hopes up.  It came out looking good, browned well and looked like an ordinary small loaf of bread.  I sliced it when warm and it tasted a little flat with those bites without raisins.  While it was definitely better than the rice bread that I bought from the freezer section of my grocer, it still leaves something to be desired.  I tried it again a few days later after toasting it and again it has a slight aftertaste that I just do not find appealing.<br /><br />I will keep trying and may try to add a bit more spice the next time.

review/summary: gluten free eaters deserve better
review/text: I found the baked product dense and bitter.<br /><br />I'm not GF, I just happened to try this because it was heavily discounted at the store and I like other Red Mill products.  I regularly make my own yeast breads with white  (wheat) flour, spelt, white rice flour, and/or whole wheat.<br /><br />I followed the directions carefully, and the bread rose in the pan prior to baking like it was supposed to.  The directions say it should bake 60-65 minutes or until bread reaches 205 degrees.  It did reach 205 around that time and I removed it from the oven.<br /><br />The directions are easy to follow and work, but I found this dense and tasteless.  If it has flavor, that flavor is bitter.  It is bitter like dark molasses (which is an ingredient).  I like molasses cookies; this is just too bitter.  I had to make coffee to eat a couple pieces.  I threw the rest out.<br /><br />If I was Gluten-Free, I'd probably experiment to make this less dense or less bitter.  I can easily imagine that the other reviewers suggestions of adding a whipped banana or more spices or giving it extra time to rise would help.  But I expected more from Red Mill.

And although that might be true, after only six cans of this (mixed half and half with dry dog food), my puppy's teeth went from bright white to having tartar build up.  My only recommendation is that if you feed your dog wet food, make sure to brush their teeth regularly.

review/summary: fantastic!
review/text: I have been looking for gluten free plain crackers for ages. Being pregnant, all I wanted in my first trimester was some plain crackers, but I thought I had no options being Celiac; there's some nice rice crackers out there, but they all are flavored with onion, garlic, BBQ, etc- not things you want during pregnancy! I found these recently in a local (high end) grocery store and was so happy to see "plain". I tried them and I had to laugh at myself for getting so excited over plain crackers. They are super good, with by themselves, or with butter, cream cheese, etc. They are great for soup as they are full of flavor and have a crispy taste. They are also not high in salt like most other crackers. Great buy too, I highly recommend if you, like me, just want some nice crackers without the salty "flavor" added to them.

review/summary: These are my favorite cracker...
review/text: Before being diagnosed as a celiac, a favorite snack was a handful of Zesty saltines and a cup of milk.  *sigh*  I have tried many gluten free crackers, but found them lacking.  Nothing hit that zone for me until I found these crackers. It is an issue of texture.  These have a texture like a saltine. (Don't expect little grains of salt on them, they do not have that) These are great by themselves, or they'll stand up to lox and cream cheese, sandwich meats, sliced cheese or spread with nut butter. If you're still looking for just the right cracker, try these, you may really enjoy them.  I do!<br /><br />P.S.  When my family dines at Cracker Barrel, I take in a few of these to top with butter and jam whilest those around me enjoy the biscuits and muffins.  Works great!

review/summary: I want to re-order these!
review/text: We have recently become gluten-free converts and these were one of the first items we bought.  They are very crunchy, have a great texture and are really great with cheese.  They are a little plain by themselves but still decent, but we really enjoy them with toppings because they do not take away from the flavor of the toppings.  The thing that really bothers me, however, is only ONE month later when I went to re-order these a little early (I signed up for subscribe and save) they went up $6!!  It seems lately that every time I sign up for subscribe and save, the price goes up substantially from the original order.  I wrote to Amazon about this but got the typical canned answer that they will send the message to higher ups and they value feedback, etc.  The Charmin tissue I ordered went up $20!  This is a disturbing trend.  You have really got to keep your eye on the pricing with subscribe and save or you will take an unexpected hit. Anyway, the crackers are good.

review/text: I ordered these crackers b/c I wanted a GF cracker and the reviews were decent.  One reviewer even claimed that this cracker was as close to a saltine as GF person could get.  More's the pity.  This cracker isn't a saltine nor does it taste like one.  It is thin and crisp and brown, more like a thin graham cracker without the flavor. Tolerable but definitely not a saltine.  It doesn't seem like making a decent GF saltine should be so difficult but apparently it is.

review/text: These are the best-tasting, best-crunching GF crackers ever made. Before celiac (BC) whenever I was not feeling well, I would pull out the saltines.  These aren't as salty, thank goodness, but they are like soul food to me now.  Two problems: too often several crackers in a box are shattered.  To minimize this, I cut the cellophane packets very carefully with scissors, once across the top, then down each side.  But still there are some that were cracked before I got them.  Second problem is that they need to be scored across the middle so you could have a "daintier" and neater serving.<br /><br />When a restaurant proudly brings me their gluten free crackers, I shudder.  They are pure cardboard. Once I took some of these in with me in my big purse.  I enjoyed happy hour much better.

They are much thinner and yes, they do break easier, but I was able to gently spread cream cheese on them today for lunch.  The box is surprisingly small, but they fit more crackers in it than do the Glutino cracker boxes.  And there were less broken despite the fact that they were packed in tighter.  The glutino ones are good, but these are cheaper and I like them much more!  Buy the 6 pack and $3 a box isn't bad for a delicious GF cracker!

EnerG maintains strict standards for their gluten free products; >20PPM used by so many other companies is NOT GF for those of us who require 0PPM of gluten.  I've never had a reaction to an EnerG food. These crackers are a little fragile but still work great for most uses and make great tasting cracker crumbs for cooking. They are similar to saltines and such a treat after being without any for years.

review/summary: My dogs love these treats
review/text: What a special cookie for my 4 legged friends.  Vanilla is a flavor they were not accustomed to and they now sit at the counter, noses pointing towards the cabinet where the treats are stored, their expression asking me if I'm nuts for not understanding what they're begging for! I recommend these to all.

review/summary: 3 out of 4 Paws
review/text: First Impression: The friendly folks over at "Exclusively Dog" heard about my website and sent me 5 of their products to test.<br />Let me just start off by saying that I Love how sweet all of these treats taste. Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4.

review/summary: Can't cook Japanese without it
review/text: The basic stock for 1,000s of Japanese recipes, dashi is absolutely essential for anyone wanting to cook authentic Japanese cuisine.  As famous chef Shizuo Tsuji once said " "many substitutes for dashi are possible, but without dashi, dishes are merely a la japonaise and lack the authentic flavor".<br /><br />Dashi can be made pretty easily from scratch, boiling some kombu or katsuobushi shavings, but you often make far more than you need for the particular recipe, and it can be a pain to spend all that time boiling.  Instant dashi does the trick just fine, and almost no one will notice the substitution.  This kind here, "Hon Dashi" (meaing "Real Dashi"), is the cream of the crop of instant substitutes.  Made by the company Ajinomoto, Hon Dashi is absolutely brimming with umami, the fifth basic flavor found in Asian cooking.  Hon Dashi is made from katsuobushi shavings, so it is a basic fish stock and not suitable for vegans, who would probably want to make their own kombu stock.<br /><br />I use Hon Dashi for almost everything, from basic miso soup, to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WJSP9C">tamagoyaki</a>, to using it to boil vegetables and give them a heartier flavor.  Along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002YB210">mirin</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002YB3ZK">soy sauce</a>, it is one of the most basic ingredients in a Japanese kitchen.

review/summary: Just what my miso was missing
review/text: My best friend returned to Japan and I felt that unless I went to a Japanese restaurant, I would never, ever have real miso soup.<br /><br />I tried every paste, every color. I tried making my miso with and without wakame; I even tried mixing the pastes and still could not get it right.<br /><br />I FINALLY got it! I didn't even intend to order Hon Dashi, had it on my wish list, but it was the best mistake I could make.<br /><br />I'll be experimenting with my dashi to see what else I can add it to. The smokey flavor is superb.

review/summary: Ajinomoto Hon Dashi
review/text: I buy this locally in a much larger box but it is the same product.  This product is just as good as making your own, which I did for years before finding it.  The larger box has 1,000 servings but that is for a weak dashi so I use double the granules.  For this product with the 3 packets, just add them into a small jar and use 1 ts per cup hot water (adjust to your tastes).  That adjustment is why it says '3 to 6 cups'.  Also, this product stores with no loss in flavor in a sealed container for years.  I actually have some in a salt shaker (with rice to keep it dry) and use it commonly as a flavor boost to vegetables (green ones especially work well with it).<br /><br />This is actually a good starter size box.  For those not sure what to do with it, a sample recipe:<br /><br />3 cups made up dashi (1 packet)- taste and add water if you wish it weaker.<br />1 packet Udon noodles (may use cooked spagetti) appx 1.25 cups volume<br />1 cup lightly packed leafy vegetables (spinach, mustard greens, cabbages etc)<br />Optional- baby bok choys whole, shellfish (whole or chopped), peeled shrimp, miso<br /><br />Bring to a simmer and as soon as the veggies and optional meats are done to your liking, it's ready.  This is the 'kitchen sink' soup of Japan, meaning just about anything might land in there though the items are normally pre-cooked leftover bits.

review/summary: Very Good Dashi - Makes Great Homemade Miso Soup!
review/text: I am very happy with this dashi.  I like that I can use it to make just a small amount of stock if a recipe calls for it, and it also makes an excellent miso soup without having to get take-out every time I happen to crave some. (For two servings I use 1 tsp dashi powder, 3 cups water, 2 big tbsp miso paste - plus add-ins like onion, tofu, etc. It's really good!) This is a good value too - a box this size will last me a long time.  Inside the box there are 3 foil packets to help it stay fresh.  They do recommend refridgeration of the opened portion, but the rest can stay on a shelf.<br /><br />Although salt is listed first on the ingredient list, the sodium level in this product is not very high.  Which is good considering the amount of sodium that other Japanese ingredients tend to have in them. It's important to remember that ingredients are listed by weight: salt is going to weigh much more than the dried fish flakes.

review/summary: Excellent bonito soup stock
review/text: Most chefs would probably prefer to make their own soup stock. However,if you're in a pinch an instant soup stock can be a life saver. If you want to make some tasty dashi fast than Ajinomoto's excellent HonDashi can be your savior. The flavor is there and HonDashi is so easy to use.<br /><br />Each box contains 3 bags. Nutrition facts and a serving suggestion are listed on the back of the box. 150g of HonDashi should take you a long way. Ajinomoto recommends 4g for 4 servings.<br /><br />HonDashi is an excellent product from a very reliable company.

review/summary: Should have read the bad review first.
review/text: Just back from a trip to Japan, hungry for some good nabeyaki udon, I ordered this stock. There's got to be something better on the market. I love salt, and dashi should be salty, but not overwhelmingly so. And why sugar, let alone two or three types of sugar? While I don't have a problem with MSG myself, I do try to avoid it. Probably my own fault; I should have specified "No MSG", except it never occurred to me that a package with this many bad chemicals wouldn't be labelled somewhere!<br />Outside of any of this, the dashi has none of the complexity or subtlety you hope for in a dashi base. I know if I want all of that, I need to make it from scratch, but since purchasing this I've tried several non-MSG brands and all of them are better. Sad to say, because Ajinomoto is a venerable company, but stick with Maruhachi or one of the other, healthier brands!

review/summary: Loaded with MSG
review/text: I haven't even tried this stuff yet, but with the first ingredient being salt, the second being MSG, then finally the third being dried bonito powder, then the next sugar, then dextrose(more sugar)...then some chemicals(disodium inosinate, disodium succinate), which sound like more salt or preservatives, or both...WTF? None of the other reviews even mention this marvelous combination of lousy ingredients...kinda stupid. If I'd wanted 3 packets of sugar, salt, and flavor enhancers....I'd have ordered salty/sugared MSG soup base.<br /><br />UPDATE: I did some research and I thought this was interesting, and since this product, and the topic of MSG seems to be so bantered about, maybe this will be interesting to someone else.<br /><br />The food additive, monosodium glutamate, was first used in the United States in any quantity in the late 1940s. According to Dr. George Schwartz, author of In Bad Taste: The MSG Syndrome, although considerable effort had been spent to introduce MSG to the USA, little had been accomplished prior to World War II. However, sometime during the war, the use of MSG in Japanese soldiers' rations was noticed. In 1948, a symposium on MSG, presided over by the Chief Quartermaster of the Armed Forces, was held in Chicago for members of the food industry.<br />By the 1960s, Accent, the leading brand of the flavor enhancer called "monosodium glutamate," had become a household word. Simultaneously, other hydrolyzed protein products such as autolyzed yeast, sodium caseinate, and hydrolyzed vegetable protein gained in popularity. Every hydrolyzed protein product, regardless of the name given to it on a label, contains MSG.<br />Although glutamic acid had been isolated in 1866 by the German chemist Karl Ritthausen, it was not until 1908 that its flavor-enhancing potential was noticed by Kikunae Ikeda of Tokyo, Japan. Prior to that time, the Japanese had used seaweed as a favorite flavor enhancer, without understanding that glutamic acid was its flavor-enhancing component.<br />From 1910 until 1956, the process underlying production of glutamic acid and "monosodium glutamate" in Japan was one of extraction, a slow and costly method. Elsewhere, crude gluten or other starting materials were hydrolyzed by heating with hydrochloric acid. In 1956, the Japanese succeeded in producing glutamic acid by means of fermentation; and after considerable research to identify suitable strains of microorganisms for starting the requisite cultures, large-scale production of glutamic acid and "monosodium glutamate" through fermentation began.<br />Even before the Japanese discovered the flavor potential of processed free glutamic acid extracted from sea weed, the potential of freeing glutamic acid from protein using acid hydrolysis was being explored in Europe. At the time, however, the method was not widely used. Indeed, it was not until some time later that the flavor industry realized that various of their hydrolyzed protein products contained considerable amounts of processed free glutamic acid (MSG) -- the flavor-enhancing component of the food ingredient "monosodium glutamate" -- and production of hydrolyzed protein products for their flavor-enhancing potential escalated.<br />When "monosodium glutamate" was brought to the United States in the years following World War II it was still manufactured through extraction. By 1956, after considerable research to identify suitable strains of microorganisms for starting the requisite cultures, Ajinomoto Co., Inc. had succeeded in producing glutamic acid through a method of bacterial fermentation wherein bacteria (some, if not all of which are genetically modified)(10) are grown aerobically in a liquid nutrient medium. These bacteria have the ability to synthesize glutamic acid outside of their cell membranes and excrete it into the medium to accumulate there.(11) It was in 1956 that truly large-scale production of glutamic acid and "monosodium glutamate" through fermentation began.<br />We find it fascinating that the first published report of a reaction to "monosodium glutamate" did not appear until "monosodium glutamate" was being made by bacterial fermentation. The first published report of a reaction to "monosodium glutamate" appeared in 1968 when Robert Ho Man Kwok, M.D., who had emigrated from China, reported that although he never had the problem in China, about 20 minutes into a meal at certain Chinese restaurants, he suffered numbness, tingling, and tightness of the chest that lasted for approximately 2 hours.<br />The following year, John W. Olney, M.D. reported that laboratory animals suffered brain lesions and neuroendocrine disorders after being exposed to monosodium glutamate. Scientists studying retinal degeneration in mice treated with free glutamic acid had noted that these mice became grotesquely obese. Olney, who speculated that the obesity might be a sign of damage to the hypothalamus (the area of the brain that regulates a number of endocrine functions, including weight control), found that infant laboratory animals given free glutamic acid suffered brain damage immediately, and assorted neuroendocrine disorders later in life. Pharmaceutical grade L-glutamic acid was often used to produce these disorders until neuroscientists observed that monosodium glutamate, an inexpensive food additive, could be substituted for laboratory-grade free glutamic acid in these studies and produce the same effects.<br />In the years that followed, neuroscientists replicated the work of Olney, and Olney spoke out repeatedly about the toxic potential of monosodium glutamate. In 1972, for example, Olney testified before the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs that ingestion of MSG places humans at risk, with the greatest risk being for the very young; and that a National Academy of Science panel organized to determine whether MSG ought to be banned from baby food had produced an "industry arranged whitewash" by a group of scientists with almost no experience in neuropathology. In the early 1970s, manufacturers of baby food voluntarily removed the monosodium glutamate from their products, but replaced the monosodium glutamate with MSG-containing ingredients such as autolyzed yeast and hydrolyzed vegetable protein. In the late 1970s, manufacturers "voluntarily" removed all obvious MSG-containing ingredients from baby food.<br />Use of MSG in food has grown in the last 30 years and is still growing. MSG is found in most soups, salad dressings, processed meats, frozen entrees, ice cream, and frozen yogurt, in some crackers, bread, canned tuna, and very often in "low fat" and "no fat" foods to make up for flavor lost when fat is reduced or eliminated. It can be found in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and dietary supplements. It is found in enteral feeding products and in infant formula. It is found in vaccines -- including vaccines used on children. It is found in hospitals where it is hidden in the jello, chicken soup, and some IV solutions given to very sick patients.<br />Very often manufacturers use hydrolyzed protein products as MSG-containing flavor enhancers instead of using "monosodium glutamate." In the industry, an ingredient that contains MSG but is not necessarily recognized by consumers as containing MSG is called a "clean label" ingredient.

I put some chicken legs in the marinade for 30 minutes (which is pretty quick for a marinade) and after cooking, the chicken legs had a wonderful, tangy taste and Lawry's marinade left the meat juicy but not oily.  I will be using Lawry's Original Seasoned Salt Marinade and other Lawry marinades for all my grilling now since it adds just the right amount of taste and keeps food from getting dried out, which happens to me a lot on the grill.

It would be very good for dogs who have trouble keeping weight on because they compete/train a lot and burn a lot of calories or just have crazy loads of energy they burn all the time.

review/summary: Great product, but buy locally rather than online
review/text: The quality of these pirouline cookies is unsurpassed, but I was very disappointed with this purchase. It was shipped quickly, but arrived mostly crushed.  Most of the cookies were broken and many were crushed at the bottom.  We purchased them for a formal dinner and gifts.  Unfortunately, because of their condition, we will have to purchase other wafers locally and eat these ourselves. I would not recommend purchasing this product through delivery.

review/text: I received my Pirouline wafers after ordering a case of 6 cans, however, up to now, I have opened three cans and all the contents are broken or shredded due to poor handling.<br />I was hoping to use this to decorate cakes or served with a foamy cappuccino, but it is not possible now, since they are all broken and pulverized on the bottom.<br />Please don't get me wrong. The product is delicious but worthless to my purpose.

review/text: This kikoman marinade is the BEST. I have used it with many types of beef from beef tenderloin to sirloin. It always adds a nice flavor and makes the meat oh so tender. You really only need about 20 minutes in the marinade and you are ready to grill.  I had a hard time finding this at my local grocery stores so I ordered this. I've already used at least 5 of the packets.

review/text: Our butcher told us about Kikkoman Meat Marinade for grilling thick pork chops or chuck roasts.  Mix powder with 2/3 cup water, pierce into meat on both sides, and marinate for 15-20 minutes.  Tenderizes meat, adds wonderful flavor, and hastens cooking time on grill.  Family and guests love the results.  We've used it for many years, but it's not always in stores.

review/summary: FANTASTIC SAVINGS
review/text: I wish there was some way to tell everyone about Amazon's warehouse deals in the grocery section! SNYDER's Pretzels are extremely well known. To find them on the warehouse deal was amazing. I got 12 one pound bags for apx 18.00!  Usually, they sell for 3.29 a bag! These were shipped from Pennsylvania the home of the Snyder company in their own box with no room to spare (thus little to no breakage)! They have an expiration date of May 13, 2012 which is a little over 3 months from today(Feb 15)! This averages out to about a bag a week. These are big fat pretzels. One just fits in the palm of my hand. I tried one and it is absolutely NOT stale! This is indeed a fantastic find and savings!

review/summary: The Only Pretzels I Want
review/text: These Snyder's of Hanover Olde Tyme Pretzels are the only pretzels I want, I love everything about them. The size of these are one size down from the largest bagged size and are very lightly salted, which I enjoy very much. The texture is not rock-hard like some other larger pretzels I've had; rather, when you bite into one of these, it has a flakey, slightly (but pleasantly) crumbly texture that is easy to chew. The flavor is mild and just plain good. I enjoy making chocolate covered pretzels once or twice a year during holidays for my family as well as bundle up packages of regular and white chocolate pretzels as treats to give away, and everyone enjoys them. I have found these pretzels are also very good when one is getting over a sick tummy because they are so mild. I never cared very much for pretzels before until I tried this brand and have been buying them ever since!

With these I don't have to so much -- the salt is perfect as is.  Very crispy and flavorful.  The best I've ever had.  Unfortunately they're hard to find in my area.  Fortunately Amazon.com has them available.

review/text: I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday because he was always saying how good it is...and it's really good!  It's a really versatile sauce that would go with poultry, pork and beef.  It might be a bit too heavy of a flavor on a delicate fish, but it would be nice with a hearty fish like bluefish or tuna.<br /><br />The sauce has a very good balance of caramel sweetness, smokiness, salt, tangy vinegar/fruity notes and spiciness.  If you are very sensitive to spiciness, you may think it is too spicy, but if you enjoy spicy food, you will think this is quite mild.<br /><br />It's overall a great sauce for marinades, dipping and adding to other sauces.  Try adding a few tablespoons to chili.

review/summary: NOT an artificial butter flavor!
review/text: I was HIGHLY disappointed to receive this product, all 16 ounces of it, to find out that it's not an artificial butter flavor for baking at all! It is actually SOY/SOYA OIL!!! You could use this to replace normal oil in recipes, and have that oil taste more buttery, but this is NOT NOT NOT an artificial butter flavor that you add to cookies and such in the amount of teaspoons. If your recipe calls for 2 cups of oil, you would use 2 cups of this to substitute, which would be like 2 cups (16 oz.) of oil with ~1 teaspoon of artificial butter flavor mixed in.<br /><br />The whole reason I purchased this is because we have family members with allergies, including to dairy and soy, and our local grocery stopped carrying Schillings Artificial Butter Flavor that I usually use. If this CK product were simply labeled correctly on the front of the bottle pictured or in the product description, I never would have bought it! What this product would be good for is pouring over popcorn straight from the bottle, like the stuff they use at the movie theater. It is quite the same!<br /><br />If you are looking for an actual artificial butter flavor, that you could add 1/2 teaspoon to your cookie recipe to give them a buttery flavor, as in AN ACTUAL ARTIFICIAL BUTTER FLAVOR FOR BAKING, try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000VM8R2">Wilton No Color Butter Flavor</a> instead. We now use the Wilton's butter flavor along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1DG4">Spectrum Naturals Organic Shortening</a> (actually 100% Palm shortening, not hydrogenated) in any baking recipes that call for butter or shortening. I contacted the company, and Wilton confirmed the ingredients were as one would expect for an actual "imitation butter flavor" to be used in any baking.<br /><br />Shame on CK for such false advertising and misleading labeling!

review/text: I get these every year at Christmas to go with all the usual home-baked goodies.  These are very thin crisp spicy cookies, with tons of flavor in a small size.  Everyone that tries them absolutely LOVES them.  Until I find a local source for them, I'll keep ordering them from Amazon.  (The other flavors are equally good, too!)

review/summary: I love these cookies
review/text: These cookies are very thin and crisp and remind me of gingerbread with a slight kick.  Everyone I have given these to wants to know where to buy them.  These normally sell in 6oz tubes for about the same pice in department stores so this is a great deal.

review/summary: Great Canned Cookies!
review/text: These cookies are fantastically tasty,& arrived with only a little breakage (other reviewers complained of this, but given how ridiculously fragile these cookies are, it's not surprising).Perhaps the packaging folks at amazon were more careful-either way they arrived in good shape, the cookies themselves are quite tasty & remind me of lemon "Trix" only WAY better (I consider it a good sign when a food item brings back seemingly random childhood memories) they are so tasty in fact, that I'm eager to try their other cookies as well...the cans are useful when empty too....

review/summary: Excellent cookies.
review/text: These cookies are delicious and remind me of Christmas.  However, they do not ship all that well.  About a quarter of them were broken into small pieces.

review/summary: Not as good as I remember`
review/text: I've bought these cookies before and they were just wonderful.  But these were not as good as I remember and the packing makes it difficult to retrieve a cookie without breaking it.

review/summary: Love These Raisins!
review/text: Great idea to buy raisins in smaller packages; they don't dry out this way and you don't end up with hard raisins that need to be soaked first before eating.  This is the only way I shall buy raisins from now on.
