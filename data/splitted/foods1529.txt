review/summary: Not the same
review/text: So I order my favorite Jim Beam seeds from Amazon every couple of months. I was running low so I decided to order a new case this week. To my dismay, the package that came in the mail has changed. The picture on Amazon still shows my favorite brand, but apparently Jim Beam seeds are now being produced by "BIGS". They changed the seed, as well as the amount of seasoning. The taste is the same, but not nearly as strong.<br /><br />Just a shame. The genuine original seeds were perfect. It wasn't just the taste, but the amount of flavor, as well as the quality of the seeds. Now we just have something simliar to a regular store-bought brand.<br /><br />I contacted Jim Beam and they verified they no longer have genuine seeds. They are all BIGS now, so my seed buying days on Amazon are over. I might as well go back to Davids or some generic brand from the grocery store.

review/summary: Terrible Customer Service from Euro Food Mart
review/text: I ordered this item and several other choclate items from Euro Food Mart and was sorely disappointed in the products I received. They arrived melted. I didn't realize that I needed to have them shipped EXPEDITED. I mistakenly assumed that by paying $12 for shipping, the items would arrive with some kind of coolant. Previous to placing the order I clicked on the Shipping link for detail, and perused the chart that appeared. I failed to scroll down and see the information stating that in order to assure the use of ice gels, orders needed to be Expedited. So, on a $26 order, I would pay an additional $30+ for Expedited delivery. When I initially received my melted chocolates, I contacted Euro Food Mart and received a very rude and curt reply from Cris in Customer Service informing me that during the checkout process I was offered shipping with ice gels, but I chose to decline it. Sadly, the melted chocolates did not fair any better after being refrigerated. They cracked easily and no filling was discernable. This chocolate bar in particular was disappointing in texture as well. Admittedly, it was my mistake not to notice the note on Expedited shipping, however, the response from Euro Food Mart's Customer Service lacked objectivity. My rating reflects my entire experience....quality of shipped product and customer service experience with Euro Food Mart.  I would not order from them again.

review/summary: Converted a hater of flavored popcorn
review/text: I received a package of the caramel, chocolate and sea salt popcorn as a gift that included mini brownies (also delicious) and this popcorn. I was sure I would hate it but I was waiting for food to defrost and I was hungry so I thought I'd open the popcorn and eat a bit before dinner. Since I probably wouldn't like it, it would be easy to eat a little bit to and then close the bag. I ate the entire 3.5 oz bag right then in one sitting.  From the first bite I was shocked by how good it was, like they did something to it. I highly recommend this popcorn and this is from someone who really hates flavored popcorn and kettle corn. I eat traditional, buttered popcorn. I got this popcor for free but I intend to buy more.

review/text: this cat food is one of the best around and really deserves a five star rating!  However, the cost on the web is outrageous!  I paid $9 for a trial package on this site because I wanted to see if my cats would eat this before I spend $42 on a full size bag.  Just after my purchase arrived, I found the same product at a small specialty pet shop for $3 and the full size bag was only $16.  Needless to say I will continue to purchase this food for my cats because the quality of this product is so good. But I will be getting it local now.  My only wish from Orijen is that they could come up with a wet food and preferrebly in the form of pate'.

review/summary: Excellent Tea, Good Price
review/text: I started loving Oolong tea after I discovered a bottled product called 'Tejava'. That product is over a dollar for a 12 ounce bottle. I needed something less expensive so I tried this 'Prince of Peace' brand Oolong.<br /><br />After a few brewing experiments, I now love this stuff.<br /><br />What I have learned; If brewing as 'sun tea' this type of tea seems to come out very weak. If you put this tea in boiling water, it may come out bitter.<br /><br />I now heat up my water in a microwave until it is, very hot to the touch, but no way near boiling. I then put in the tea bags and let it brew for about twenty minutes (I like strong tea). I have, to my taste, duplicated the 'Tejava' brew at a fraction of the original cost.<br /><br />Enjoy<br /><br />Ken

My adopted soldier requested Ice Breakers Ice Cubes Sugar Free Raspberry gum.  I was unable to find that flavor in my town.  So, I decided to go online and find it.  I was thrilled to find exactly what he wanted for a great price.  The best part was the gum actually arrived faster then I was told it would get here.  Therefore my soldier got his gum quicker.  I was thrilled and so was he.  When serving our country in Afghanistan the smallest things bring the biggest pleasure to our service men and women.  I was thrilled with the service from this site I received and will be glad to come back to order other items when I need them.

review/summary: Foodie at heart will love Amazing Olive Oil Club!
review/text: We received the Olive Oil Club from Amazing Clubs as a gift a few months ago.  We were skeptical at first as we have visited many olive oil producers in our travels around the world and couldn't imagine that it would have the same quality.  BUT we were pleasantly surprised month after month. The Amazing Clubs selection is just as impressive as the olive oil we have picked up in New Zealand and Argentina and we didn't have to fly anywhere to get it.  It has consistently been a wonderful addition to our kitchen each month.  We have not able to find the same selection at the local grocery or specialty store.  We cook with olive oil for almost every meal... anything from salmon to roasted vegetables to homemade salad dressing.  With the new variations that arrive each month, we find yourselves coming up with new ways to continually enjoy these beautiful oils every day or just adding a little variety to some of our staple recipes... you'd be surprised what a difference a new oil can make in a meal.  We are extremely impressed with the quality and diversity of the oils that Amazing Clubs has given us access to.  We highly recommend ordering the Olive Oil Club for yourself or friends!  Great quality and great value!

review/summary: Had to throw out a dinner...
review/text: I bought this and the hotter version of the Bolst's product based upon reviews and ended up having to throw away a chicken curry meal I had made as the flavor was dominated by something you just don't expect in curry--and it's a flavor to which I'm very sensitive and I would never have bought the product if I'd realized it was in there--MUSTARD! In addition, the Mild definitely has some heat (not overly strong) to it, which I might understandably expect in the one labeled Hot but not one marked Mild. I'm a big fan of Penzey's spices but am such an Amazon fan that I thought I would try a new product in lieu of the one I had been buying--and it was a total mistake. The ingredient listing might have been in the listing though I truly didn't check it as I'm accustomed to a wide array of blends both from India and elsewhere that have a varying balance of cumin and other standard spices--but MUSTARD? So disappointing as the color was also unappealing but the flavor and aroma were just unacceptable. The heat would have been tolerable but not such a bizarre flavor profile for curry. Wasted a meal and had to give away both containers of product.

It tastes like those bacon and cheese potato chips from the vending machines. I also tried the 'Original Mashed Potatoes' version which is the exact oposite, had no flavor at all. The original version asks for milk, margarine, and salt. This loaded version only asked for water so that's a plus if you're camping or something. I'm still going to stock up on the Original version since it was .66 at my grocery store. But this version wasn't for me.

review/text: I'm a big fan of the Idahoan instant mashed potatoes in all the various flavors and have rated them highly here on Amazon.  However, the "Loaded Baked" flavor was my least favorite of the bunch.  I couldn't really identify a particular flavor with the potatoes.  They were supposed to taste like a baked potato with sour cream, cheese, bacon and chives, but I really couldn't identify any of those flavors when I was eating them.  It was the artificial bacon bits that I found least appetizing.  After the addition of boiling water, the soy protein masquerading as bacon turned into pinkish little chewy bits and the texture and taste I found disagreeable.  I won't be ordering this flavor again.

review/summary: Easy, real "fast" food -- but beaten by FOUR CHEESE!!
review/text: These Idahoan "instant" mashed potatoes are a godsend.  Quick:  name some other food that can be ready in less than 5 minutes and is "real", even though cooked from a mix?  These are real, dehydrated potatoes, and they're unbelievably fast to prepare.  Just put 2 cups of tap water into a microwaveable bowl, add the contents of one of these bags, stir a little to mix and to get rid of the biggest lumps, and microwave for 3 1/2 minutes.  That's it.  When finished, just stir and enjoy.<br /><br />Don't think fast means yucky.  They taste delicious, and you can fool people into thinking they're leftover homemade or leftovers from a restaurant.  Incredibly good to have on hand.<br /><br />My favorite is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KOUK7E">Idahoan Mashed Potatoes, Four Cheese, 4-Ounce Package (Pack of 12)</a> -- out of this world!  I tried this Loaded version because the Four Cheese were temporarily unavailable from Amazon itself, and a third party supplier was overcharging by about 400%.  The Loaded are pretty good -- not quite as good as the Four Cheese, but still great to have in the pantry.<br /><br />When you come home late from work, confront the fridge with exhaustion, and think longingly of your favorite ethnic hangout or even take-out, to combat that urge you need resources at hand!  We keep thin ham steaks in the freezer and turkey kielbasa in the fridge for just such occasions, both of which are fully-cooked and just require searing/heating in just minutes.  These wonderful mashed potatoes can be ready even before those are and will complement any entree.  Add a fresh steamed vegetable and/or simple salad (or even, if you're really wiped out, high-quality canned or frozen vegetables -- try keeping a can of cut green beans, drained, in the fridge marinating with some fresh chopped onion and a wonderful vinaigrette as an instant salad for just such emergencies!), and you can have a meal on the table faster than you can get back home with takeout.  Better for the budget, better for the waistline, and yet still delicious comfort food!!!  :)<br /><br />FYI:  Although I wouldn't try it with the Loaded, you can serve the Four Cheese or the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KOUK6A">Idahoan Mashed Potatoes, Buttery Homestyle, 4-Ounce Package (Pack of 12)</a> for a dinner party, even -- they're that good!

review/summary: Great Tea
review/text: This tea holds a special memory for me. We adopted our daughter from China and at the White Swan hotel this was the tea that was complimentary in our rooms.  Before we left from China I bought about 6 bags which lasted me a while. Smooth flavor and great taste.  Every time I drink it I only think of good things.

I assumed there would be some kind of instructions in english. I assumed wrong. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I can't wait to try this milk tea!

review/text: When I received the product they appeared to be a very light color - not the same as pictured.  I tasted a couple and my assumption was correct, the product was very old. There is no date on the product so I cannot say for sure based on how they look and taste - the product is OLD. I am extremely disappointed since I paid a lot for just one 5.9 oz bottle and was expecting something great based on other reviews...

review/text: Every so often I stumble upon an product that surpasses the advertising. I urge everyone to have a tube of Wound Honey on hand.  I apply this the minute I have either a burn or cut and the next day you can see the difference.  It is a little hard to apply and I recommend covering the injury because its sticky, your pets would love to lick it off, but the product is wonderful and guess what, no side effects.

review/summary: Above & BEEyond
review/text: :) Well my honey recommended this for help in healing a freshly stitched up chainsaw induced wound. Well how sweet it is... it not only accelerated the process but helped take some of the sting out of the experience. I did not apply directly into the wound at first....just around the edges. I did this at night, covering up the sticky stuff with a large bandage tapped securely in place & left it on as i slept. After the wound closed i lightly applied it directly on it about every other day for a week.<br />My recovery was quick....so quick i did not need to use allot. Now i am in the next phase of my recovery, scar reduction & physical therapy & doing great. Proper wound management care is essential from day 1 until fully recovered as the better job you do the better your chances of a quick & complete recovery. So if you have your antennas out looking for something above & beeyond your standard remedy i recommend trying this sweet stuff & sticking to it :)

The product was fresh and shipped in a reseal-able bag, which is great because I don't plan on eating a pound of chia seeds in one sitting, and I'm running out of containers.

review/summary: Great flavor for the price!
review/text: I disagree with a prior reviewer who feels this is the same as cheap brands. Comparing this to national brands available in chain grocery stores, there is no comparison. I first received this balsamic as a gift many years ago, and have purchased it ever since - wherever I can find it! Certainly, if you are seeking a 20 year aged balsamic at $60 a pop, or you are a connoisseur likely to have 6 different types of balsamic in your cupboard, this may not for you. But if you are seeking a reasonably priced brand with great flavor, and want to venture away from the cheap store brands and seek some new flavors, this is the one! I make a dressing that is 1 part honey, 3 parts balsamic, and 6 parts oil that is fantastic! I find this brand very versatile for salads, fish, meats without having to buy the most expensive Modena balsamics. Try it - you'll like it! Great great flavors for the price!

review/text: I was surprised that Elsa, which makes glorious balsamic vinegars, passed off the poor ingredients in this bottle as being worth $18. One whiff and one taste told me this is not the real thing. It contains caramel coloring and wine vinegar, just like $5 balsamic from the supermarket. If Taylor's had agreed to refund the return shipping, I would have been satisfied. After all, it's always a risk to buy online. But I feel that their product is actually deceptive, and Taylor's should have taken responsibility.

review/text: Love getting my pet food this way! Our 8 dogs love Pedigree and I love getting it delivered to my door. Per can, it costs a bit more, but when I consider cost of gas, as well as load it into my cart, unload at checkout, load back into the cart, load into car, unload at home...makes me tired just to write about it...home delivery is a fantastic bargain!

review/summary: Smells better than most brands
review/text: My dogs are very picky. This is the first canned dog food, except for expensive Little Caesar, that they'll eat. Still, they hold out for table food as long as they can! My worry is that Pedigree has only 6-7% protein. Recommendation is 27-28%. Notably, the can does not say "nutritionally complete"!

review/summary: pedigree chicken and rice
review/text: Pedigree chicken and rice is good product.  My dogs love it.  I wanted Pedigree Weight Management Chicken and Rice but it was recalled and I don't know when Pedigree will start to release again.  My dogs don't know the difference of Pedigreen Chicken and Rice regular or weight management.  I can also use Pedigree Health Weight Chicken and Rice but it comes from Peto and that costs over $18 in shipping whereas Amazon if over $25 does not charge shipping Love that.

review/text: My dogs like this flavor of Pedigree canned food a lot.  It's a very good deal with Amazon's subscribe and save program.  Much cheaper than Walmart or Kmart.  However sometimes the cans are dented.  I don't know whether this is Amazon, UPS, or the manufacturer.  I've gotten dented cans in 12 or 24 packs in local stores so it could be anyone tossing them around.

review/summary: formerly a frequent Amazon shopper
review/text: I had previously purchased this Pedigree chicken dog food for my finicky 1-year-old german shepherd and she loved it.  When my shipment arrived from Amazon I immediately opened a can from the end of the plastic-encased 24-pack and presented it to my dog.  She sniffed it and refused it, so I left it out for her. She kept begging for food, but I would each time point out that she had food in her dish.  She finally ate it, reluctantly, the next evening and then was up all night vomiting. The next day we smelled a dead animal odor that we couldn't locate. Sugar (the dog) sniffed it out for us at the top of the cabinet and we discovered that at least one of the Pedigree cans had burst open and was full of squirming white worms and rotting, oozing liquid that permeated the entire package. I felt so guilty for making Sugar eat something that made her sick, and threw away the entire package. Now I'm afraid to buy the brand again.

review/summary: Carcinogenic, but nice taste and texture!
review/text: Yes, this product can give you cancer, but so can toothpaste and a lot of other things we take for granted. You're gonna die some day from something, so if you really like this gum, why not, right? It's probably safer than smoking cigarettes.<br /><br />"Titanium dioxide dust, when inhaled, has been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as an IARC Group 2B carcinogen possibly carcinogenic to humans." -- Wikipedia.<br /><br />Of course, Xyloburst is by no means the only gum with titanium dioxide. Spry has it too, and so do a lot of other brands, with the notable exception of xylichew, which does not. So if cancer isn't your thing, then buy Xylichew. For my part I have noticed that I cough a lot more after chewing a lot of gum, probably because of all the titanium dioxide dust that gets stirred up by chewing. What is the titanium dioxide for? Why, color. The manufacturer has determined in his infinite wisdom that our brains will explode if we see a piece of gum that is not perfectly white. So he put a carcinogen in a purported "health food" product, making fools out of all the trendy folks that pay a premium for a one-way ticket to the cancer clinic.<br /><br />I give three stars, because I really did like the texture, flavor and the fact xylitol was used instead of sorbitol. I think Xyloburst is pretty close to being worth a try, just not there yet. The cancer thing is kind of a buzzkill, you know?

review/summary: Make great appetizers!!!!
review/text: This was really fabulous!  I went on the company's website and found some great recipes for most of the "dips" etc. they have available.  I tried this one mixed with cream cheese and butter, sprinkled with the bacon topping, spread on strips of white bread, rolled up, wrapped in bacon and baked for about 5-7 minutes.  They were absolutely amazing - I made some for myself to test them out, made more the next day, then made a tray for a party and they all were gone in minutes.  I've been craving them ever since.  ..it's really, really good and really really easy.<br /><br />Wind & Willow BLT Cheeseball Mix<br />8 oz. cream cheese<br />4 T. butter or margarine<br />4 slices of white sandwich bread<br />DIRECTIONS:<br />Pre-heat oven to 425. Combine BLT Mix with 8 oz of cream cheese and 4 Tbs. butter. Trim the crust from 4 slices of white sandwich bread. Cut into 3 equal strips. Spread each strip with BLT mixture and sprinkle with Herb and Tomato Topping. Roll up from the short end of the strip. Wrap with 1/2 strip of bacon and secure with a toothpick. Back for approximately 10 minutes or until bacon is done. Your guests will fight for the last Bite

review/summary: Good results but contains soy
review/text: I received Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance Dog Food to try as a BzzAgent.  I'm feeding this to my terrier as he tends to show the results to changes in his diet quicker than my Corgi or Belgian Sheepdog.  I've been a dog mom for more than 20 years, including participating in dog sports such as sled dog running, agility and dog shows.  Proper nutrition is vital to dogs' health and ability to participate in things they love to do.  While I currently don't do these activities with my dogs, I still am very picky about what they eat.<br /><br />When I received my BzzKit, a 4lb bag of Hill's Science Diet, Ideal Balance Dog Food, I checked the ingredients.  The first listed is chicken (good!) followed by brown rice and whole grain wheat (not as good as a meat ingredient, but better than it being corn).  Next is cracked pearl barley, soybean meal and chicken meal.  I have to admit I paused at the soybean meal.  In my experience, soy has not been a positive addition to dog food.  I find that foods that contain it result in looser stools of greater volume, and the dog's overall condition is not as high as one fed a food without soy.  It's an inexpensive ingredient that is associated with "filler" in the dog community.  I was curious to see how my terrier would handle and fare on this food. 3 stars for only one meat ingredient in the first 5 ingredients, and for the inclusion of soy.<br /><br />Rex, my terrier, became immediately interested when I opened the bag.  He was VERY anxious to see what was in there, so the smell must have been very enticing.  He's not a picky eater, so I anticipated he'd like the Ideal Balance, but didn't anticipate how eager he was to get it!  I slowly, over the course of days, switched him to Ideal Balance from his previous food (to reduce stomach upset from a diet change), and found he ate the Ideal Balance nuggets first before cleaning his bowl.  It may be because it was new and novel, but it may have been because he liked it better.  He's a dog...he couldn't tell me.  He seems to like it so much that I can even use Ideal Balance as a training treat.  5 Stars for taste.<br /><br />Rex has been eating Ideal Balance for a couple of weeks now.  It's not long enough for a complete picture of its impact on his condition, but long enough to get an idea of how it's going for him.<br /><br />His coat is very nice.  It was nice before, and I haven't seen any change in the coat condition.  The Ideal Balance diet is at least maintaining his coat in good condition.  We need more time to see the food's long term impact in Rex's coat.  4 stars for coat maintenance.<br /><br />Rex has a tendency to gain weight.  We really have to watch how much he eats.  And Ideal Balance helps him pack it on!  This means I can feed him less, which means I'm buying less food in the long run.  But I really have to watch his weight.  And it means that he is getting a lot out of the food.  The crude protein is 21.5% and crude fat is 12.5%.  The protein is not high, but the fat content is maybe a little higher than I'd seek for him.  I might choose a weight control version of Ideal Balance if this becomes his regular diet (and if one exists).  5 stars for body weight maintenance.<br /><br />Now the down and dirty part of the review...stools.  A dog's stool can tell you a lot about how he is tolerating his diet.  Rex's stools on Ideal Balance are firm, maybe a little larger than they were on his previous food, and do not smell any more objectionable than normal.  This tells me he is digesting the food normally, as well as close to optimally.  They could be a little smaller, but not so much that if I wasn't looking for a change that I'd have necessarily noticed it.  5 stars for stool quality.<br /><br />Overall, I give Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance Dog Food 4 stars.  If there were a 2nd meat source and/or soy wasn't present, I could in good faith give it 5 stars, based on Rex's condition on the diet.  If you do try it, be sure to monitor your dog's weight, and adjust how much you feed accordingly.

review/summary: Sagan loved it.
review/text: I tried this food for free through BzzAgent. My dog is about a year old but VERY active, so have him on puppy food still because he's smallish and has trouble keeping weight on. He is allergic to something, I'm not sure if it's environmental or food, but he didn't have a reaction to this food. This is corn-free so I'm wondering if that's what he's allergic to.<br />He did very well on it, and had nice solid stools and wasn't excessively flaky or itchy. He tends to bolt his food so the very small pieces weren't that great. He wouldn't chew it and then ended up vomiting afterward; I had to give him small amounts at a time. I'd rather they had kibble size options, but I'm being picky now.<br />I'm not thrilled that the second ingredient is wheat, but at least it's not corn. Sagan seemed to do well on it. If it was less expensive than the food I have him on now (that he also does very well on), I'd have no problem using or recommending this food.

review/summary: Doesn't Have Unpleasant Odor
review/text: If you've bought the new formula of Hill's Science Diet dog food, you may have noticed an extreme fragrance.  It is unpleasant to humans, but the dogs seem to like it (if you get my drift--think, "base of a fire hydrant").  This is unnecessary because the dogs liked it before and it had a tolerable dog food odor for humans to smell.  The new stuff is odiferous in a disgusting way.  I don't want that fragrance in my house, let alone the kitchen, which is where the dogs eat.<br /><br />This new stuff is probably the same as the old stuff only now you get less of it and it costs more.  Sigh.  So you pay more for less food, but at least it isn't stinky.  The dogs like it just as much as they did before.<br /><br />I hope Amazon will begin to carry this product in the large size.  We have two "mature" labs, so we will always need a supply of this food.  The local pet store isn't open 24 hours and doesn't always have what we want.<br /><br />This would be a terrific item for "Subscribe and Save".

review/summary: Food You Can Feel Great About Feeding Your Dog
review/text: I have a 8.5 year old Jack Russell who I view as one of my 'children' and not just a dog. She is very food motivated and we're yet to find a dog food she won't eat, however, she's struggled with acid reflux issues and all night 'hiccups' for most of her life. So I was excited for the opportunity to try HIlls Science Diet Ideal Dog Food to see if it would help her with this issue. I am also very pleased to be feeding her food with NATURAL and REAL MEAT ingredients as it makes me feel better about what she's taking in and the quality of the food. Not surprisingly she took to the food right away. I've never been one to like the smell of dog food, but I certainly didn't find the smell to be any more offensive than any other food like the other reviewer mentioned. I actually placed out a piece of 3 different types of food in front of my dog and she immediately whe went for the Hills Science Diet Ideal Balance food, so I'm guessing that she found it to be more appealing too. Although I haven't seen a HUGE improvement on her reflux issue, it has seemed to helped a bit and I'll take any help I can at this point. In fact, she's only been on the diet a few weeks now, and I know it generally takes a bit longer for it's full effects, so I'm very optimistic that it will provide even more improvement in the future. The only negatives I have about the food are that I had a hard time opening the bag and the top actually ripped open so I wasn't able to use the reasealable closure (but that could've been due to my impatience), and it seems to be a bit pricey. BUT, it's worth it for the quality and if it helps. Definitely would recommend! I am a buzzagent and did receive a free 4 lb bag and coupons to try the product.

review/text: I received Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance Dog Food to try as a BzzAgent.<br />My small Pomeranian has allergies to a lot of things including wheat so he was itchy on this food, however, the lab I have did GREAT on this food.<br />She loved the taste, ate it very well, and I noted an improvement in her skin and coat. She also has itchy problems for a lot of the year but improved with the use of this food.<br />I also noted that my girl seemed to need less of this than most other brands of dog food out there. This means I'm buying less food in the long run which makes the food comparable in price to less healthy alternatives.<br />The only complaints I have is the use of the wheat ingredient plus the soy. I really would like to see this product use another protein source that is more within the natural diet of a canine.

They contain a vegetable I've never heard of before, called moroheiya, touted on the package to be "...highly nutritious"...prized by the Egyptians for its health and beauty benefits."  Don't know how it ended up in a Japanese noodle product but I'm glad it did since it's very delicious, vegan and the 20 moroheiya leaves the package says it contains are organically grown.  (Would have given it 5 stars if the entire product were organically grown.)  Because there's no soup base, I've been using them in a variety of dishes - including soup.

review/summary: Good texture, flavor - but expensive to try
review/text: I tried these because I saw them mentioned in Reader's Digest. For those that love those cheap ramen (Nissan, Maruchan, etc.) these will likely give you what you are looking for as a healthier option. They have a similar texture to cheap ramen, but not the unhealthy fats. They also have 6g of fiber per serving. Low-carb dieters beware: they are high in carbs, even considering the fiber.<br /><br />They have a bit of a 'vegetably' taste and odor to them, but I don't mind. I usually take the seasoning packet out of the Maruchan ramen and use that with these. They sell these noodles with soup base on other listings, but I suggest trying them plain and/or using your preferred seasoning before buying those.<br /><br />They're expensive to try out at first, but once you become addicted it's easier to get them cheaper by buying the plain noodles in bulk, directly. Give them a shot!

review/text: Wish more people know about these great noodles. Usually buy the plain noodles and am amazed at how versatile<br />they are besides being nutritious. Made with moroheiya, unlike other ramen noodles, they are steamed and air dried instead of being pre-fried and have no added preservatives, food colorings or MSG. Also great because they're vegan and produced under environmentally friendly conditions.<br /><br />Have been using these noodles in salads, as pasta (without the guilt) as well as in soups. They are quick cooking and keep well after boiling. Usually boil up a batch and refrigerate them.  The noodles only need to be dunked in hot water for a few minutes and they are ready to go with whatever sauce or trimmings you want for that meal.

When I saw it advertised on Amazon I was surprised and looked it up right away. It comes in a pack of 6-3oz packages and qualifies for Amazon's free shipping which is a bonus and for $35.56 which is a bit cheaper than the last store I found it in months ago. True to form, Amazon shipped it out promptly and I could not have been happier with the transaction. Great product at a fair price and flawless transaction. No complaints and well satisfied.

review/text: This is good turkey jerky in my opinion.<br />The problem is, I received 6 3.0 oz packages instead of 6 3.5 oz packages.<br /><br />Amazon quickly refunded a fair amount for the shortage.<br />However, I am surprised the description is still incorrect after<br />several weeks (unless they are now really shipping 3.5 oz packages).<br /><br />The reduced stars are only because of the product shortage.

review/summary: YUM!!  another great mix..another excellent appetizer
review/text: I made a fantastic appetizer with this and was really surprised at how great it was...The wind and willow website has many more recipes but here's the one I tried and everyone loved it...it disappeared fast, I had four slices before I even put it out.  I used lettuce, tomato, and black olives as the toppings and cut it into squares rather than pizza slices.  The worst part about making it was by far trying to cut it with all the toppings on it.  I would recommend putting the cream cheese mix/topper on it, cutting it and keeping the pieces altogether, and then putting the veggies on top and separating the pieces-or separating and sprinkling the veggies on top.<br /><br />Cold Santa Fe Appetizer Pizza slices<br />INGREDIENTS:<br />1 can refrigerated pizza dough<br />Old Santa Fe Cheeseball & Appetizer Mix<br />8 oz cream cheese<br />1/2 cup sour cream<br />3 cups chopped fresh veggies (lettuce, tomatoes, black olives)<br />1 cup shredded cheddar or Monterrey jack cheese<br />DIRECTIONS:<br />Bake pizza crust as directed and allow to cool.<br />Combine Old Santa Fe Seasoning mix, cream cheese, and sour cream.<br />Mix until creamy.<br />Spread Santa Fe mixture onto cooled pizza crust.<br />Top with chopped veggies, black olives, cheese, and contents of Topping packet.<br />Refrigerate until ready to serve. Cut into 2 to 3" mini pizza slices.<br />Serves 12 to 16

review/summary: seller uses deceptive ads
review/text: Down to my last can of this 5.5 oz Hill's Science Diet Kitten Culinary Creations Roasted Chicken in Gravy Canned Cat Food, when this order finally got here today.<br /><br />Problem:<br />the ad fails to mention any size of the cat food cans.<br /> but the picture shows a 5.5oz can.<br /><br />So, I ordered it based on the picture: which is CLEARLY 5.5 oz cans.<br />What I got is 2 cases of 24 2.9oz cans,<br />this is not what I ordered.<br />and now, I need the cat food! I have hungry cats here!<br /><br />I ordered it online since it's not available locally.<br /><br />I am NOT happy!<br />I can't return it for refund, it would take way too long.<br /><br />what do you suggest?
