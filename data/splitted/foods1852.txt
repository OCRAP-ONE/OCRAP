review/summary: completed melted by the time I received them
review/text: Like others have commented, Amazon has done a really poor job with the packaging on these.  The 12-pack ships from Missouri, and I'm not sure what kind of storage facilities Amazon or UPS has, but the bars are completed melted by the time you receive them, which is very disappointing.  When Amazon used to carry the sesame-peanut-chocolate in the 8-pack, the biggest complaint was that those bars were too tough to chew.  Now they're just mushy.  Bring back the tough bars!

review/summary: Love the bars, but they had melted
review/text: These bars are great, but if you live in a warm climate I recommend trying to find them locally rather than having them shipped to you.  Mine had melted during shipping and the chocolate bonded to the plastic so eating them was a mess.  Still my favorite KIND bar, though.

review/text: I was looking forward to these bars, since most of the reviews were great. Unfortunately, my experience was not a pleasant one. I bit into one bar and noticed something strange. I put on my glasses and saw hair, lots of hair in the bar. Gross! Bad quality control day? Whatever, I will not do business with KIND again. I got a full refund from Amazon. Thank you Amazon, I don't blame you. P.S. Look at my posted pictures.

review/summary: I like Kind bars but not this flavor
review/text: This flavor has an overwhelming peanut, i.e. peanut butter flavor with a tart, fruity flavor reminding me of a PB&J sandwich.  I didn't enjoy it but that may be because I don't like peanut butter.  Too many peanuts ("nuts" to me doesn't mean a majority of peanuts) and too tart of fruit, too pasty texture of fruit as well as too much of it.  I prefer nutty with no peanuts and chewy, sweeter fruit pieces.  My bars were fresh and chewy (a tad on the soft side).  I'd picked up various flavors at small local stores and enjoyed them so grabbed this when it went on sale to try.  I'll not buy this flavor again but do recommend the brand.

review/summary: Superior Product; Very Expensive
review/text: The cost of the items is very high.  Almost $1.60 for each bar.  In my opinion, this is excessive.<br /><br />However, these bars are fantastic and you can literally see all of the nuts (whole) that make the bar.  The exterior is slightly sweet, but is really balanced with the falvor and crunch of the nuts.  It is about the perfect size bar for my breakfast.<br /><br />I bought the one's in the yogurt since it gives the bar a creamy smooth flavor.<br /><br />I will continue to buy them since they're the best nut bar I've had.

review/text: So I started a Gluten-free diet with my husband a few weeks ago. It has definitely helped in trimming our waist-lines as well as in picking up our energy levels. Not so much in finding tasty or non-expensive food. I was looking for a healthy yet flavorful snack that won't break the budget and I decided to try this Kind bar stuff. Boy was I blown away by its freshness and rich flavors. I started with the coconut almond. So yummy and filling. A perfect way to grab a quick bite when you're on the go and without sacrificing health or flavor. Highly recommended!

review/summary: A little stale...but I'll give them another chance
review/text: I searched out my favorite KIND bars on Amazon because I was buying them every day at the mini mart for nearly two dollars each.  These are the best; not too sweet, very filling, perfect for a post-workout craving.  I signed up for Subscribe and Save to get the best deal and because I know I'll go through these things. My first delivery came within a week but I'm sad to say that they were stale.  Not flat-out gross, thankfully they still taste good. But they are super hard and chewy (much more so than normal) and appear to have been exposed to high heat, like they melted a bit at some point.  I've got to admit that I never looked at the expiration date on one that I've bought at a mini mart, but that's probably because they've never been stale or given me cause to question the freshness. As it turns out, the case I have now was delivered in September 2012 and expires in October 2013, so they should be fine. Hopefully, this was just a fluke and the next case will be better.  If not, they're getting returned and I'll find another source.  So, the KIND Fruit & Nut bars would normally get 5 stars from me, but my experience by ordering them through Amazon brought them down a few stars.  I'll try to remember to update in the future.

If there is an ingredient as allergy causing as peanuts or cashews in a bar that I could SEE upon opening it should be noted somewhere.

The Apricot & Almond bars are my favorite and are now entered into subscription . . . I love them as an anytime snack! Healthy yes, but these are way better tasting than most granola bars! The nuts with dried fruit remind me of the vegetarian version of pemmican. These are rich tasting, low glycemic impact, nice crunch, sweet & tangy fruit with a bit of chew for enjoyment!! I have these bars with a cup'o'Kicking Horse coffee and am "in the saddle" and energized!

review/text: Usually, I consume protein bars during my work day, but I had to search for something to replace those bars during the hotter months in my part of California because protein bars melt quite quickly if not stored in a cooler with ice packs. I was on the search for something that would not weigh me down during the work day, taste good, and portable. I tried several other flavors before I found two that agreed with my taste buds - almond & coconut and nut delight.

The DCK & Sea Salt flavor is now my ultimate measuring stick for the rest of the salty sweet snacks KIND provides. The Almond & Apricot flavor is particularly disappointing, unfortunately. Many of the other varieties are very satiating and flavorful, but the apricot fruit in combination with the nuts in this bar are a misplaced one. They just don't make sense on my pallet.

In the past 6 months, the bars got A LOT smaller, and price for an individual bar went up.  I hate when companies do that. It's called greed.<br />As the the stale taste (in other reviews) -- I do know that macademia nuts go stale very fast.  I don't know what can be done about that, short of making them salty for preservation.

review/text: I subscribe and save, which gives me a great value on these KIND bars, which I would normally see as too expensive. This flavor is the best snack or quick breakfast. I keep them in my office cubicle in case I need a healthy snack. They're incredibly sweet, great for when I have cravings for cola.

review/summary: Mellow ginger taste, crunchy cookie.
review/text: I like these a lot.  They are made from whole grain wheat flour with 3 grams protein per serving- so they have a thick crunch to them.  The ginger is more mellow, you don't get that hot sharp ginger taste like you do from Trader Joe's Brand Triple Gingersnaps.  If you like a real sharp ginger taste go for the Trader Joe's.  TJ's I think has quite a bit of molasses too which might be why they are so dark.  These cookies are very light in color.  Again the ginger taste is mellow and I noticed you get a little boost of ginger taste at the end if you chew slowly.<br />  Trader Joe's Brand Triple Gingersnaps are thinner, much more in your face ginger taste and if I were rating on a comparison between the two ONLY based on the ginger taste then I would probably rate these one star.  But these would appeal to a wider audience.  I can imagine a lot of people being repulsed by the Trader Joe's Brand Triple Gingersnaps because they are so strong.  Plus these are cookies not snaps.  TJ's are gingersnaps and they have that type of crunch to them a 'snap' type crunch.  I only mentioned TJ's because a couple of negative reviews mentioned them and I have tried them.

review/text: I have recently had to pleasure of trying the Trader Joe's Brand Triple<br />Ginger Cookies.  They are the best I have ever had.  So, I was excited to find the Back to Nature Triple Ginger Cookie on Amazon. I thought the two would be similar.  I was wrong. They are fresh, but do not taste much like ginger.  The taste and texture reminds me of taking the peanuts and peanut butter out of a peanut butter cookie and adding crystalized ginger.  I bought 6 boxes too.  I am willing to try other flavors of the Back to Nature cookies, but I will have to find a source for the Trader Joe's for ginger cookies. I looked for comments on the Back to Nature website and this flavor isn't to be found. Now I know why.

review/summary: Wrong Product Sent
review/text: First off, I am a HUGE fan of Reese's Sticks.  In fact, they may be my favorite candy bar ever!  I was extremely excited when I heard my box had arrived yesterday, and opened it up as soon as I got home from work.  And, in an instant, my smile turned into a frown.  In front of me was a 36-count box of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.  I quickly reviewed the order sheet (in the box) and it confirmed that I had ordered Reese's Sticks.<br /><br />So, either one of two things happened:<br /><br />1) The seller (GR8MART) decided to send out the wrong item to me, or<br />2) The seller ran out of Reese's Sticks and substituted the Reese's Peanut Butter Cups without asking me if I wanted them<br /><br />As it's too much trouble (and not worth my time) to run to the post office and return them (and since my wife still loves the Peanut Butter Cups), I am keeping my order.  That said, be aware if you are trying to order from this seller (GR8MART), at least contact them before ordering and confirm with them that they actually have the product.  I, for one, am a disappointed customer who will never order from them again.

review/summary: Not bad, not great
review/text: I just bought and tried the Lucienne's 83% dark chocolate sweetened with stevia. It's not bad if you're looking for unsweetened chocolate, but I find it's a bit waxy in texture (I want to chew it more than let it melt--it doesn't melt well in the mouth). The flavor is OK, not as rich or smooth as I had hoped. It tastes like decent but not spectacular quality chocolate to me. I do like, however, that it's Rainforest Alliance Certified, so it's unlikely that there are any cheap ingredients here. (Incidentally, I'm a huge dark chocolate snob, and back when I was still eating sugar, I tried just about every brand imaginable. I'm partial to 70% cocoa or darker with NO lecithin and minimal ingredients--for example, one of my all-time fave chocolates is  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00432LYHY">Michel Cluizel Chocolate Bars - Noir 72% (70 gram)</a>). Anyway, this chocolate can't live up to that--although I wasn't expecting it to. I'm not complaining regarding the stevia flavor. I use stevia all the time and I'm used to it by now. It's just so-so chocolate. Not bad, not great, but still kind of a miracle if you're looking for something that's decent and sugar free.<br /><br />As far as stevia sweetened chocolates go, I preferred the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003EMQGVI">Dante Confections - 98% Cocoa Stevia Chocolate Bar: 8 Bars</a> also found here on Amazon. The texture is much smoother and the flavor is deeply bittersweet. It seems like pretty top-shelf quality chocolate in terms of smoothness, taste and texture. I'm probably going to stick with that.

review/summary: i did not like it
review/text: I expected for this kind of money to have a real natural taste of chocolate. I was disappointed $20 for 4 small pieces which were sweetened so much that it killed all chocolate taste.

review/summary: Tastes disgusting!
review/text: I normally don't write reviews, but I wanted to spare others from tasting this chocolate. I was looking for an alternative to the Dr.'s chocolate (sweetened with xylitol), and so I ordered this product. Once I opened it, I ate two small squares of the bar. From the first taste, it was ok. It was the aftertaste that had me on the couch trying not to vomit, that prompted this review. It's taken about two hours, a few apples, and some melba toast to re-settle my stomach. You'd have to be pretty desperate to eat this nasty chocolate. I think you'd be better off just eating unsweetened bitter chocolate than any chocolate sweeted with Stevia.

review/summary: Good sugar-free chocolate
review/text: While this is not the best one I have tried... it is good and really helps me fulfill my chocolate cravings on a sugar-free diet.  I tend to eat it with nuts to cut the bitterness and find it tastes good with pecans, almonds or other such nuts.  There was another one I bought a while back that I liked better than this one, but I can't find it anymore.  I prefer this over the cocoaperfection which is tasteless and waxy and doesn't even have any chocolate flavor to it..

review/text: For those of us who are both sugar conscious and health conscious this is an excellent choice. The taste is great and it avoids the problems you can have with too much stevia.<br /><br />A great product that avoids chemical (asparatame, nutrasweet, splenda, etc.) sweeteners that are known neuro-toxins.<br /><br />In one word - Excellent.

review/summary: ok
review/text: It was ok. I am a stevia fan, have been for years. I was expecting a much better and smoother flavor for the price. It was really bitter (and I like dark chocolate) and a bit gritty.<br /><br /> But, bravo to the company for trying. Their heart is in the right place. And the company is trying to do the right thing with product production. Because of that..I think Ill give the other flavors a try.

review/summary: Awesome Chocolate!!!
review/text: If I were to make chocolate this would be it! Perfection in ingredients and in taste. My nutritionist would approve this chocolate and that is not an easy task! Stevia is the only sweetener he allows because it has no glycemic index and is good for you. I am a chocohaulic and staying away from sugary chocolate is not easy. If I stay stocked with this chocolate I will be fine. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! A miracle. I am placing a double order this time.

review/text: I like dark chocolate. Prefer it over milk by a long ways. But after 6 weeks on a strict candida diet I ordered this. I was hoping for a treat to nibble now & then. Maybe my taste buds have changed but it tasted nasty to me. I had a friend try it to see, but she spit out the small bit she took. Not for me. But delivery was quick.

review/summary: Okay but not Cake Mate
review/text: I grew up in New England.  We had Cake Mate sprinkles or jimmies.  They are made in Florida by Signature Foods. I still get them when I go back as they are in the grocery stores.  The CK ones are okay, and I thought they would be quite similar -- same bad hydrogenated oils and the reviews.  These are certainly fine for a cupcake.  But for ice cream or the occasional spoonful of sprinkles, you need the Cake Mate.  These are available in 32 oz. from spiceworld online.  They are listed on Amazon but not as currently available.  I plan to get some soon.

review/text: Good quality sprinkles.  Pricing seems pretty decent.  Love the way they make my cupcakes look - takes me back to my elementary school days, long ago!  Only gripes: the "partially-hydrogenated" ingredient and non-resealable bag.  By the way, the advertised bag looks completely different than the one you get - it's not black.  Tastes like classic Jimmies too and isn't so sweet that it'll over-sweeten your frosting.

review/text: I bought these jimmies because I couldn't find the needed orange color in any of my local stores.  A pound of jimmies is a lot, but I went through more than I expected, probably half the bag to thoroughly coat a recipe of chocolate truffles.  The taste is, well, jimmy-taste.  My only disappointment/surprise was how short these jimmies are -- about two-thirds of the length of Wilton and CakeMate brands I have in the cupboard.<br /><br />If you need a special color that only CK makes, don't hesitate to get them.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee  Wesselmann

review/summary: AESTHETICALLY PLEASING~~~~SPRINKLES!
review/text: Seriously, sprinkles are not just for eye pleasing aesthetics but for mouth pleasing texture.  This bag is great value compared to buying the smaller size shakers with different colors. I can use two of containers of  those colors on one batch of 24 cupcakes.  I just have to find a proper container to put the bag ones in so they are easy to shake out onto cupcakes, as that is what I use them for mostly. I'll check on amazon to see if I can find an appropriate shaker.  I may just buy a smaller one (about 10 oz) shaker and use and re-use that one.  My son and I like them also on ice cream, topped with ready whip canned cream. Gives pleasing texture to  ice cream. Yum!

review/summary: Sensational! Why Haven't I Heard Of This Before?
review/text: Not too long ago I bought a jar of James Keiler Dundee Three-Fruit Marmalade at my nearby Fresh and Easy Store. They're an English company and have a lot of things imported from England. Well, that was a really good marmalade! My goodness! It was so good that the next time I was there I bought two other kinds of the same brand: Ginger Preserves and Dundee Key Lime Marmalade. Both are excellent, but this Key Lime stuff is just sensational! I had no idea marmalade could be so delicious. My neighbor tells me that marmalades are a British speciality. I believe her! It sure beats Smuckers!<br /><br />This stuff is just plain good. It has a nice crisp and fresh lime taste. It goes real well on toast and I have to be careful not to eat too much. Everyone who tastes it, loves it. Why haven't I heard of this before?<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: LOVE THESE ORGANIC SHELLS!!!
review/text: With so much uncertainty about the quality of corn, ETC. in our supermarkets (watch an excellent documentary called "King Corn") I'm so happy to be able to buy these great little taco shells from Amazon. They're delicious and they heat and brown very slightly in the oven VERY quickly,so, if you forget they're in there for more than a very tiny bit of time you'll wreck them and have to try again.  Pay close attention and they'll come out perfect every time!  Couldn't be more pleased with these, but, I have one question. What's the deal about never being able to find soft corn tortillas in the main markets in organic form.  If they ever have anything, it's just the hard shells. I don't get it. ENJOY YOUR ORGANIC EATING! Peace and all good things, L.
