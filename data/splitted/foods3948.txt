review/summary: Enjoy a delicious Root Beer  - guilt free!
review/text: I cannot compliment this brand enough.  I've been purchasing all flavors of Zevia for the past few years and absolutely love it.  There isn't an aftertaste at all, and it is simply delicious.  Zevia's Root Beer is among my favorite flavors.  My other Zevia favorites are black cherry and orange, however all their flavors are super!<br /><br />My favorite things about Zevia are that they are sweetened with all-natural stevia and do not contain any harmful chemicals.  Also, I love the fact that there are not any calories in it.  There are no artificial colors or flavors either. Truly guilt-free!<br /><br />The only Zevia flavor I've seen caffeine in is cola.  All the others are caffeine-free.<br /><br />I deducted a star from this product due to the pricey price point of Zevia. I still continue to buy it, but not as often as I would like to due to the cost.<br /><br />I have emailed the Zevia corporate team and they are responsive, professional, and friendly. I trust this brand.<br /><br />I hope you give Zevia a try. I think you will be pleased!

review/summary: I love the root beer!!
review/text: Really love the root beer.  Also like the ginger ale, but think the root beer is my favorite.<br /><br />I tried the orange and didn't like that very much.<br /><br />There's a new one Dr. Zevia, that looks very good, like Dr. Pepper I guess, that has caffeine if you want caffeine, but I haven't tried that one.<br /><br />I find the Zevia very refreshing and great.  At first there was a very slight unusual taste, but I quickly got used to it and now really like it.  Especially since it is zero calories and no bad things in it, like aspartame.<br /><br />Not sure why some of the Zevia's qualify for no shipping and others have a large shipping fee.  I always look for the ones with no shipping fee and that is how I tried the root beer.

review/summary: Blech! Horrendous taste!
review/text: I was pleased to have received a couple of $3 off coupons for Zevia, which brought the cost of a 6-pack in my area down to just $2.50.  I was eager to try this with my family as an occasional treat (we rarely drink soda).  We all tried both the cola flavor as well as the ginger root beer flavor and, after about 1/2 of a small glass, every one of us (including my young kids) said, "Ick!" At the first taste, it is o.k. But, after you've had a few drinks, there is very little to differentiate Zevia's taste from any other diet soda.  I guess if you are a normal diet soda drinker, this might be a wise, somewhat more natural alternative.  Stevia takes a little bit to get used to, but, this is NO substitute taste-wise for regular pop.  We'll stick with our Blue Sky sodas, sweetened with cane sugar and caffeine free, for the occasional treat.

review/summary: The taste certainly lacks & it gave me gas and bloating...
review/text: I bought this product as an alternative to other diet sodas (the "big two" will remain nameless) mainly because I wanted to get away from the aspartame artificial sweetener. I've heard "bad things" about aspartame but after doing my own research on it I couldn't find any conclusive research or studies proving it was as bad as people claimed. There are tons of sites that say all these bad things it does to you, but nobody can give me a single study proving any of what they say. I tend to think this thing against aspartame is more of a conspiracy then anything else.<br /><br />But regardless, I decided to lower my intake of aspartame and try this Zevia, since it's sweetened with Stevia. The taste is certainly lacking and while it doesn't taste horrible, when comparing it to the major players in the industry - it stinks. A very bland taste and there is very little carbonation.<br /><br />Did I mention it gave me horrible gas and bloating? You know the kind that sits with you all day long and just gives you an unsettled stomach? The reason for this is that it has a sugar alcohol in it called "erythritol" and if you know anything about sugar alcohols, they almost always give you an upset stomach, gas, and/bloating. Sugar alcohols are what those sugar free, low carb chocolates have in them. And while wikipedia states that this sugar alcohol "shouldn't" be as bad as the other more notorious ones, like xylitol, because none of it "supposedly" reaches the large intestine...let's just say I would disagree.<br /><br />If aspartame is so bad for you then why is that these products sweetened with stevia cause discomfort in some people? You'd think the "bad" product would be the one where you actually notice the side effects. At $1 a can (compare that to less then 30 cents a can for other cola brands), coupled with the potential unwanted discomfort, I think you might wanna stay away from this product.

review/summary: Unexpectedly delicious!
review/text: I was skeptical of a health-foodie soda of all things! I initially tried this when a friend got it for a gathering. Not only is it good for you: using stevia, no calories, no sugar--it is really delicious!<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />-Delicious flavor: Ginger Root beer is my favorite<br />-No calories, no sugar is great. I don't like drinking soda because it is so bad for you, but since this is all natural, it is great to be able to have it as a refreshing snack or with bbq food or comfort foods! I usually steer away from diet foods because they lack in flavor and constantly remind me that I made a "DIET" choice instead of a happier choice, but Zevia has succeeded in making a happy, healthy drink.<br />-Stevia does have a distinct taste or lingering sweet taste on the tongue that is definitely not the same as real sugar. It's not unpleasant, but it is just a different palate experience. I actually like it! I normally don't use stevia in my drinks, especially hot drinks, because of this difference, but this soda really uses it well.<br />-Addictive in a great, refreshing way :)

review/text: A friend just gifted me some of this soda.<br />I've had stevia on hand for several years and have a plant growing in the garden now.<br />I'm not a huge rootbeer fan, but this tastes very good.<br />I'll be anxious to try some of the other flavors.<br /><br />Several years ago when I purchased my first stevia plant, it was too early to plant it outdoors so I had it growing in a window.<br />One of our cats ate every leaf off the plant and killed it, but the cat didn't have any reaction other than disappointment that the plant died and didn't provide more leaves to munch.<br /><br />I'd rather drink water than most of the diet sodas available.  It's wonderful to have an acceptable diet soda, even if it is pricey.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: I found this soda on sale at Whole Foods for $4.99/6-pack as part of my mission to cut excess sugars out of my diet. I can't stand other artificial sweeteners, so after researching stevia (a calorie-free natural plant-based sweetener) and xylitol (the only sugar alcohol that doesn't cause gastrointestinal distress), I decided I would give Zevia a try.<br /><br />The ginger root beer flavor is fantastic and caffeine-free. I can barely even tell that this is not a cane sugar soda. The only difference to me is that the sweetness lasts with you a bit longer, but it doesn't bother me and goes away with a swig of water. I love that it contains real ginger and other extracts.<br /><br />I did not like the black cherry Zevia at all, too sweet, and I have a feeling the lemon/lime and orange flavors would be equally off-putting due to the flavor profile of the sweeteners being used. I want to try the Dr. Zevia and cola flavors next, although I wish there were caffeine-free versions, as I like to enjoy these sodas in the evening.

review/text: I love Zevia Ginger Rootbeer! I thought it might have a bitter aftertaste like other diet soft drinks but it didn't. I started drinking it because I am watching my carbs and sugar grams but like a good rootbeer once in a while. I wanted to be able to have one without a lot of sugar and without artificial sweeteners. I'm so glad I found out about this one. It hits the spot every time.<br /><br />This past weekend I took a sip of regular rootbeer and didn't care for it because I'm used to Zevia ginger rootbeer and prefer it. My husband enjoys it too and he's not watching his sugar or on a weight loss plan. He just likes the taste.<br /><br />I didn't think we'd work our way through our 24 cans so quickly. I'm looking forward to our next shipment.

review/summary: Well it's okay, but...
review/text: Based on the positive reviews, I was excited about this product. UPS deemed the first shipment undeliverable, so I just received my reorder today. I have not had a diet soda in over 4 years and only 1-2 Dad's regular root beer liter size this past summer for ice-cream floats. Root beer is my second favorite to birch beer, however since I've technically given up sodas, it is a rare treat (or health hazard depending on your viewpoint) that I indulge. My taste-buds response was this product does not taste like Dad's, but more like a weaker root beer flavor and the aftertaste reminds me of how a diet coke tasted. I've used stevia in my coffee for several years and cannot tell it from sugar. I do not like it in hot tea unless it is chai, as otherwise I taste a slight cotton-mouth aftertaste similar to this product. Although somewhat disappointed, I certainly will drink the remaining 23 cans and may decide to try their Dr. Pepper and/or black cherry versions.

review/summary: I guess I don't like stevia
review/text: I've been trying to give up both Aspartame and High-Fructose Corn Syrup, so I was excited to find Zevia at my local grocery store. I've had stevia one other time, in coffee, and it seemed a little over-sweet, but nothing that couldn't be fixed by using a little less of it. I couldn't even finish a can of this soda though. Not only did it have the worst stevia flavor (grossly sweet and somewhat bitter), but the flavor also tasted really watered down to me. I think the Ginger Root Beer flavor could be really good if it was sweetened with something else and the non-stevia flavors came through a bit stronger. I'm glad I only got a six-pack of this rather than buying the 24 through Amazon as I've considered doing before.

I think stevia is not toward the top of the list of ingredients) and I have used pure stevia extract before, and I can tell you they are not using very much of it. It basically tastes like a fountain drink where the syrup was running out. I would not pay regular soda prices for this product, let alone the higher retail prices at places like Whole Foods. It seems to me they are basically jumping on the stevia bandwagon and it has more to do with marketing than actually using it to make a good product.

review/summary: Delicious Flavor - Better than sugary Root Beer
review/text: Zevia drinks have been my favorite alternative to sugary or diet drinks. I like all the flavors I've tried but I really loved the Root Beer flavor. It reminds me of when I was a kid and enjoyed root beer floats. This is however a more complex drink with the natural flavors of wintergreen oil, anise oil, lemon oil, orange oil and ginger extract. This does contain citric acid which can cause tooth damage if you drink it too often. I think it is safe to say that this drink won't harm you if you only drink it now and then. My little Eat Safe handbook also says that Erythritol is safe at low levels. When you think of the dangers of eating too much sugar or artificial sweeteners then this drink starts to look pretty darn good. But drink in moderation. The problem with the ginger root beer flavor is that you will want two cans at a time. It really is that good.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: A while back, I tried Zevia's cola and was not too impressed.  I decided to give the company another go and tried the ginger root beer.  I think Zevia takes some getting used to, but compared to the cola, this product was not too bad.  The initial sips were strange with the flavoring more ginger than root beer.  I don't typically use ice with my drinks, but I felt compelled to drink this cold. I think I could drink this as a soda substitute.  The flavor isn't phenomenal but it is better than Zevia's cola option and it is a good alternative to mainstream aspartame-laden soda products.

review/summary: One of the most accurate flavors
review/text: Honestly, I love Zevia. It's the only way I can have soda again and not as a compromise. This stuff is not in any way inferior to its original brand names. Zevia root beer tastes exactly right. In fact, with all the flavors, I have not experienced the aftertaste you often hear mentioned, though I have to say that the many citrus varieties are all pretty similar in taste, but different enough that you can tell them apart. Zevia Root Beer is a win and one of the most flavorful of the Zevia brand if not THE most. I like others am a bit concerned about the use of erythritol but only because I have IBS and that product is related in some way to diarrhea and stomach problems. I cannot say I've had any problems as a direct relation to the ingredient but I would like to see what this would taste like sweetened entirely with stevia.

review/summary: Great alternative to regular pop!
review/text: I recently discovered I have candida and have been forbidden to drink anything with caffeine, sugar, or gluten, which cause a flare-up in my symptoms.  My boyfriend and I went to a food co-op on Saturday to find things that I CAN eat (very few traditional grocery store foods are allowed on the candida diet).  I noticed Zevia and was pleased to find that it's sweetened with Stevia, one of the few sweeteners I can consume.  The price was a little high (at a little over a dollar a can, plus tax), but I felt it was worth it to get my sweet fix.<br /><br />I was tentative to try this because we had recently purchased Truvia, and the taste right out of the jar was slightly bitter.  But with my first sip of the ginger root beer, I loved it!  It's very bubbly and light and refreshing; not bitter at all.  It doesn't weigh you down or coat your teeth with a sugar film like normal sodas, either.  And the ginger root beer taste is different than any other soda, too.  All that said, Zevia's Ginger Root Beer makes a perfect substitute to regular root beer.  If I could eat ice cream or have alcohol, I bet it'd be wonderful in a root beer float or mixed with blackberry brandy (my favorite!)<br /><br />I highly recommend at least giving this soda a try.  I haven't tried any other varieties yet, but I can personally attest to the wonderful flavor of the ginger root beer, and anyone who's looking for a healthy soda option should consider Zevia.

review/text: Out of all of the natural sodas I love this one. The taste is great!!! It taste more like the soda it represents, which is root beer. I have tried the diet cola, and the one that is supposed to be like the Dr. Pepper and this one has the closest taste.

review/summary: Tastes like Root Beer, with no aftertaste.
review/text: To me, this is one of Zevia's most successful flavors.  I was pleasantly surprised - it reminded me of the root beer we used to get at the old of A&W Root Beer Drive Ins a few decades ago.  I didn't detect any unpleasant aftertaste for their Ginger Root Beer.  I tried this as part of the variety pack, but I would feel comfortable buying their root beer all by itself.

review/summary: Thats not bad!
review/text: I got this from a local store, so nothing to say about delivery.<br /><br />I told a story about how I felt and got this in my review of the Zevia cola, so I won't rehash it here. Yes, I just plugged something for which I make no money.<br /><br />When I got it home, I noticed that one of the cans in the case wasn't Zevia but Blue Sky Free root beer. It was okay, but it also says something about how this stuff is packaged.<br /><br />Anyway, I let it chill and popped open a can, expecting something like Mug root beer but less so. It was actually pretty damn good, better than expected! The diet-y flavor is quickly overpowered by one that is decidedly root beer and only makes a brief cameo after the stuff is swallowed. While I would far rather have an A&W or Barq's, this is a very viable alternative if sugar and corn syrup are no longer your friends.<br /><br />The only real downsides I noticed is that there is no vanilla in it, instead it uses four kinds of oil extracts for flavor. Vanilla would have made it a five-star drink and if I have this stuff and some vanilla at the same time, I'll probably combine them.<br />Also, since I kind of assumed (I didn't look, sue me) this would cost a fortune to ship and handle, I found it locally. In the entire area of Arlington Texas, there are four places that sell this according to the Zevia stie. Four.<br /><br />Should you buy some? Sure. It lacks some of the satisfaction of more widely-available root beers, but 'diet' is Latin for 'nothing is as good as it could be'. Good alone, serviceable with Mexican food.

review/summary: Awesome sugar free soda!
review/text: I have never really been a soda fan ever. Growing up as a kid the only soda I thought tasted good was root beer. As an adult and a vegan I know very well that regular sodas are just empty calories and a whole bunch of high fructose corn syrup so I have stayed far far away from them.<br /> I use stevia for my coffee in the morning and I love it. I have done the research on all artificial sweeteners and I wont go near those chemicals. Amazon had recommended this to me by other things i have purchased. I was too nervous to buy 24 of them since i don't like soda and it could have tasted terrible. So my solution was to get a 6 pack at my local store.<br /><br />All i have to say is WOW! It has a great root beer taste. I am so pleased with this product I plan on keeping this an auto-ship. I recommend this to people who want yummy soda without the soda and future cancer.

review/summary: Delicious and so much healthier for you
review/text: I have been wondering for years why there was no Stevia-flavored sodas on the market.  It had always been pick your poison between sodas loaded with insane amounts of sugar, or sodas flavored with Splenda/sucralose/aspartame.  I was thrilled to finally find the Stevie-flavored Zevia soda by accident while wasting time in a store, and got the 6-pack of root beer.  I thought it might taste odd, but it's actually quite delicious.  Costs $1 a can pretty much anywhere you get it, but kicking in a little extra pocket change for a guilt-free delicious drink is well worth it.

review/summary: Acquired Taste for Non-Diet Drinkers
review/text: I haven't drank diet soda for many years and back then it was the nasty aspartame stuff.  Those drinks are an acquired taste but once you're off the corn syrup it's hard to drink a `regular' soda.  Zevia sodas also have a period where you'll have to get accustomed to the taste.  This is the third flavor of Zevia I've had up until the cola flavor I just got my hands on it was my favorite.  I was getting used to the stevia sweetened zing on earlier flavors of orange and black cherry before I got the root beer.  It tasted really good to me when I first started drinking it but it took my wife a bit more time to realize it was good.  She had stayed away from Zevia after tasting the orange which she did not like.  Zevia sodas still have a little aftertaste (the zing I refereed to above) that kind of sits with you for a few seconds but the longer you drink it the more used to it you get.<br /><br />However, there are two major problems with ordering Zevia products.  First, they're expensive.  At just over a dollar a can they are pricey, no other way to describe it.  The second, is availability.  Amazon is really having some issues with keeping Zevia flavors in stock with Prime shipping.  The third party sellers all have exuberant shipping prices bringing your case of soda to over fifty dollars.  I've emailed Zevia about this and did get a response from them.  I hope Amazon can keep it stocked and Zevia can keep them supplied.  It's a good product but it's been frustrating trying to order due to Amazon's stock.  Due to the high price tag I put it on a monthly schedule to save 15%.  It helps but I wonder if Amazon will have it ready to go each month.<br /><br />The Zevia Root Beer is a very good tasting soda.  I'll definitely continue to drink it if I can afford to and Amazon has it available.

A subsequent e-mail said that the shipment was on its way (which I have now received).  Its summary in the statement said that the S & H was $108. & change.  I replied to Nutricity as directed and said that I wanted the product, but that the S & H was obviously a mistake, and would they kindly either eliminate the S & H or charge me a reasonable amount for same.  In reply they stated that I had agreed by the online order to pay for the S & H stated in the order (the total order of which I thought I had deleted because of the ridiculous amount of S & H), and therefore was responsible for the total payment.<br /><br />Is this the way matters are going to be?  Is there no recourse for me?<br />As stated to them and now to you==I love the product, but the S & H was obviously a mistake.  Please do what you can to remedy this situation.<br />  Yours truly,<br />  Nicholas T. Ancona<br />  Quatrocchi@netscape.com

review/summary: Went back to Aspartame!
review/text: I am a big fan of Stevia over artificial sweeteners like Saccharine or Sucralose so I was really looking forward to switching my diet soda and I bought a case of this stuff having never tried it, but having read the rave reviews.  YUCK!!!!  It does not taste like root beer.  Why does Zevia company have to invent their own holistic, all-natural recipe for root beer to create a soda with Stevia, why couldn't Zevia have just bought the exact formula from A&W and used Stevia as the sweetener instead?  That soda would taste great.  Unfortunately, this Zevia soda doesn't taste like normal root bear or even diet root beer.  It has a weak taste that's strange and unfamiliar, followed by the harsh aftertaste bite of the oils and ginger making me worry they're covering a weaker, unpleasant aftertaste from either the stevia or other ingredients in the zevia all-natural formula.  Bleh.  If you want guilt-free soda, but dont care about going all-natural, like I don't care, this is not the soda line for you.  Hopefully the diet soda giants will break out a stevia-sweetened branch of their regular line, as Zevia isn't tasty enough to switch.  My wife and I threw out the rest of the case.

review/text: I'm a big fan of Zevia sodas and drink several cans per day during the summer months. With that said and just to be fair, I have to tell you that I'm not a big root beer fan to begin with. In fact, I haven't drunk root beer in twenty years or more. So when I ordered Zevia's Ginger Root soda and tried my first can, I thought I was going to puke. This stuff tastes exactly like Pepto Bismol.<br /><br />But you have to remember something here, I'm not a fan of root beer, so maybe this is the way it's supposed to taste. I've read raving reviews about this flavor on other sites but it's just not for me. That's why I had to give it one star.<br /><br />My opinion is subjective like any other one, but if you like root beer, I think you won't be too disappointed because my taste buds tell me that they have a good product, but one I can't enjoy. I know how strange that must seem to you but I can appreciate something even though I may not like it on another level.

review/text: Steeping the cocoa bean shells into a fragrant and delicious tisane is such a stroke of genius. The pure chocolate flavor and aroma is outstanding. For those who say it is watery, thin, bitter etc...This is not Swiss Miss Sweetened Hot Cocoa. If you appreciate a natural chocolate flavor extracted from the cocoa shells thus also rendering all the known health benefits of chocolate, without the sugar and preservatives then this is a must try. Sure you can add milk and sweetener if you desire but please, do try it plain first. It needs nothing. I also left the shells in my mug and let them settle at the bottom with no negagtive effect on the flavor. It is impossible to oversteep this. The flavor only becomes more intense and stays smooth. Also a big Thank You to Bill at Tisano who was super helpful & friendly in our email exchange.

review/text: I just opened the package and made my first cup - and immediately logged on to Amazon ordered two more packages of this tea!<br /><br />The heavenly aroma of chocolate filled the kitchen as soon as I opened the tin.<br />The cocoa shells are light, crispy, delicate, and CHOCOLATEY.<br /><br />I nibbled a few of them as I waited for the kettle to boil.... Crispy, crunchy and delicious!<br /><br />I decided to use a coffee press for my cacao shell tea. I measured out the approximate amount, and  marveled at the aroma.<br />As I crunched on a few more of the delicious cacao shells while waiting for the boiling water, I became aware of my mood subtly brightening. The kettle whistled, and I poured the boiling water carefully into the cafe press. Rising along with the billowing steam, an unmistakeable scent of fine chocolate was strong and beautiful.<br /><br />I took my first sip and it was HEAVEN. This is like drinking the smoothest, purest dark chocolate. Even without added milk and sugar it is just beautiful.<br /><br />The mood-brightening effects of the theobromine are amazing. I feel happy. Coffee can make me crabby, but these cacao shells are having the opposite effect.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />I am very happy with this product.

review/text: I couldn't wait to try this product, and I wasn't disappointed. My fear was that it might be bitter, and acrid like unsweetened chocolate. This was not the case at all. The first thing that hits you with every sip is the wonderful dark chocolate aroma, followed by a smooth chocolatey flavor. The best part is the guilt free indulgence, no calories, very little caffeine, and all the health benefits of dark chocolate including, Theobromine which naturally raises serotonin (the feel good compound for your brain). If you like tea, and love chocolate try this tea!

review/summary: exotic chocolate flavor without the calories
review/text: I've tried other chocolate teas - black tea flavored with chocolate. They're fine but this is THE ONE if you want pure chocolate flavor. I have it without milk and add just a little natural sweetener (agave, brown rice syrup or cane sugar). All the satisfaction of a cup of hot chocolate but lighter. Wonderful stuff! I also love the fact that it's organic and Fair Trade.

review/summary: Nasty!
review/text: I was so excited about this chocolate tea! After reading rave reviews I thought I would give it a try. It tastes like you are drinking water-downed baking chocolate. It was incredibly bitter. I added a bit of raw sugar which helped a bit, but it didn't make it amazing. I think the only way that it could possible taste good is if you made it with hot milk and a lot of sugar. At that point you might as well just have normal hot chocolate. Save yourself the money- don't buy this.<br /><br />Side comment: I never received the lid to the tin. Who sends a tin without a lid? I am really not sure.

review/summary: Tasty, earthy cocoa flavor
review/text: I'm a bit of a noob to serious tea drinking. I've always liked tea, but only recently have I become completely obsessed. Within the last 6 months I've begun to accumulate all kinds of tea. Within that time period this tea has quickly made its way into my favorites and I'll definitely be repurchasing when I run out.<br /><br />I love this stuff. No, I mean I LOVE it. Seriously. While it isn't actually tea at all, it's prepared the same way - add the 'leaves', steep, add preferred additives, drink, YUM. There is no actual tea in this product, it's all cocoa bean shells. Because of this, you have to like the natural, earthy cocoa flavor (like that of dark, dark, dark organic chocolate you might find in a health food store) to like this tea. If you're expecting it to taste like a candy bar or cake you'll be disappointed. While it DOES smell like candy, it simply does not taste that way. (However, I suppose you could add an absurd amount of sweetener to give it a candy taste but that really counteracts a lot of the health benefits of this tea. It also takes away from it's natural taste which is amazing!)<br /><br />The thing that caught my eye about this tea initially was the flavor, of course. What made me really decide to make the purchase was all of the claims. The description says it has vitamin D and iron - which is especially good for someone like me who is both anemic and vitamin D deficient who could use as much of that in their daily intake as they can get- and it also claims to have natural serotonin raising capabilities due to the fact it's pure cocoa, which as most people know, is good for you and full of feel-good elements.<br /><br />While I can't prove or disprove any of those things, I will say this tea is delicious and worth the somewhat hefty price. You get a lot of bang for you buck and unless it's your staple tea you drink every day, several times a day it should last you quite a while.<br /><br />I'd like to note that the tea-to-water ratio recommended on the container might be a little exaggerated. I use a little over half the recommended tea to go with the amount of water I'm using, and it does just fine. It doesn't taste watery or weak at all. And unlike most teas, you can let this steep while you're drinking it and there's no gross, over steeped taste. I've also found you can also re-steep the tea 2-3 times before any substantial loss in flavor. Knowing that that, it can more than double the cups of tea you get per tin.<br /><br />Anyway, the main point is I really like this tea and recommend it.

review/summary: So good I forgot to eat!
review/text: I am a hardcore chocoholic. I try and keep fit by watching what I eat, limiting my carbs and exercising on the regular. But Chocolate...well, I haven't been able to slay that demon.<br /><br />Until NOW!<br /><br />Enter Tisano.<br /><br />I gained quite a bit of rebound weight gain after losing 48 lbs from my pregnancy. 160 lbs down to 112! But when I reached 112, well, I did the rebound thing. I was 112 in Dec. By 2nd week of Jan I was 133.<br /><br />How? I couldn't control my cravings.<br /><br />133 not alot. But compared to my 112, it was noticeable.<br /><br />Not to mention a HUGE jump.<br /><br />I felt like chocolate was controlling me.<br /><br />I embarked on a chocolate tea crusade. I bought every chocolate tea i came across. I know this isn't a weight loss product, but it's working that way for me!<br /><br />I was supposed to have lunch an hour ago. Guess what? Not hungry for it. I was in the mood for my yummy chocolate tea. So drinking that instead. It's great to not be controlled by hunger. Right now I feel relaxed and even a bit high! Whatever is in this tea is WONDERFUL.<br /><br />Hurry up and buy this  because I am about to buy the whole stock! Great addition to my weight loss battle or anyone elses!

review/text: I love Stash decaf chocolate hazelnut tea but was looking for some variety.  This is not a "tea" it is made from cocoa shells.  I read all the reviews so I  was kind of wary of purchasing.  A few people stated that it did not have a great flavor.  The smell is amazing and I feel like I am having a treat that has no calories.  It does not, as others stated, have a really strong rich flavor but it is a smooth chocolate taste that is very satisfying.  I  do add milk and sweetener as I do with coffee.  I am not sure I would love it plain.  I will definitely spend the money again.

review/summary: I Can Have My Cup of Hot Chocolate Again!!
review/text: So after making some long over due changes to my lifestyle which resulted in losing 160lbs and counting (about 50 more to go) and being able to get off all my medication including those for High blood pressure and Type 2 diabetes I thought something like just enjoying a cup of hot chocolate would be a thing of the past. Even with my new healthy life the occasional cup is still out of the question as I'm now lactose intolerant. Figured my chocolate drinking days were behind me. And I was certainly skeptical about trying a tea based replacement when I stumbled across this. I'm not a tea drinker, at least I never was before, but cutting out all soda left me with just water and the occasional glass of fruit juice so adding tea is something I'm now doing for variety and the health benefits. And finding this chocolate tea has been a real treat! It tastes good!<br />At first sip, I wasn't sure, it was like a very dark bitter chocolate, maybe some like that, but not me. But when I added a packet of splenda to it...magic! I swear it was just like a cup of hot chocolate, so good I had to have a second cup! ^_^<br /><br />Even if I weren't lactose intolerant, or concerned with calories and sugar content of which this has none of either, I would still be drinking this.<br /><br />It's that good!

review/summary: Doesn't get any better than this!!! Nectar of the gods! Plus organic & fair trade!!
review/text: I love this product and I love the fact that I can support the company because of its business ethics. This is the best tea and the best chocolate product I have ever discovered.<br /><br />I  found out about the tea by accident. I was really looking for chocolate nibs that were not covered in processed chocolate. Their chocolate nibs are sold through "Eastbluff Trading Company" and they got great reviews. The nibs are indeed amazing.<br /><br />But it is the tea that will keep me coming back. I plan to purchase this for all my tea and chocolate loving friends.<br /><br />Preparation: The instructions say to use 3 teaspoons full and steep for five minutes. I use more than the recommended 3 teaspoons, but I steep it twice. I also steep it for longer. After steeping I pour it into my Nissan travel thermos and add "Sugar in the Raw" to taste. The "Sugar in the Raw" enhances the flavor of any tea and it is the same with this one. I don't need much. It is delicious without the sugar, but it is my treat so I do like a little hint of sugar.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, this is better than a chocolate bar any day!

review/summary: Good, Not Great.
review/text: I was really excited about getting this tea. I have been attempting to eliminate bad foods and drinks from my diet so I thought this would be a good way to curb my chocolate cravings. The best thing about this tea is how it smells, it really is amazing. The flavor however is not so amazing. I do not know how someone could drink this without any kind of sweetener or milk added because it really does have a bitter taste. I added some sugar substitute to my tea as well as a small dollop of whipped cream. I enjoyed the taste of it after some doctoring but overall I do not think it is worth the nearly 15$ price tag. I am a fan of very dark chocolate but I had trouble with this. It seems very strong and likely to induce a stomach ache if one is not careful. I will have to be in a very specific mood to drink this again.

review/summary: Chocolate flavor without bitterness.
review/text: I tried this tea at my daughter's house and loved it.  As a tea addict (there are worse things to be addicted to) or maybe I should call myself a tea collector because I try many different types of tea, I was impressed by how much chocolate flavor there was without any bitterness.  It really needed no sugar.  I normally make a pot of tea in the morning and then store it in a thermos to enjoy during the day.  Sometimes, when I haven't finished all of the tea by the next day, I might reheat it.  That's the only thing that I would say negatively about this tea.  It changes its flavor with sitting.  It's best drunk right after brewing.

review/text: Tisano is this unexpectedly unique and tasty tea that is unlike anything available out there. Found this at a Whole Foods in SoCal and gave it a spin. A nice, pleasant aroma and flavor of chocolate presented in a fat-free tea format that can be served plain, with sweetener or even Queen's way with milk. It is a very healthy, anti-oxident and nutrient filled drink that tea drinkers and coco lovers should both be excited about.  I've only steeped it to drink it hot, but I'm curious what other things you can do with it in cold format for the summer. Enjoy!

Some of the pods come out a bit weak, but not bad.  I've tried the Senseo, Cafe Halo, and Godiva pods, and all have been acceptable, but not outstanding.  The Wolfgang Puck pods appear to have more coffee in them, and provide a more robust flavor.  I've brewed several and have not had the tearing issues others have reported.  And the flavor has been the best of the pods I've tried so far.  Might be that these stack better in the pod holster for the Keurig than in a regular pod brewer, but I have been quite pleasantly surprised by how good these are.  Highly recommend!

review/summary: An EXCELLENT hazelnut choice for your Keurig brewer...
review/text: I've long been a fan of flavored coffees so when we got our Keurig brewer we jumped on the opportunity to sample as many different flavors of k cups as possible.  Our first foray into the single-serve hazelnut world was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZKI">Gloria Jean's Coffees,Hazelnut K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>, which was absolutely awful.  We've always enjoyed hazelnut coffee in the past, though, and vowed not to give up.  I ordered a sample pack of Wolfgang Puck's hazelnut directly from Keurig's website and hoped for the best.<br /><br />Thankfully, Hawaiian Hazelnut blows all of the other hazelnut k cups out of the water.  It is smokey and delicious without being dark and overwhelming.  The hazelnut really does taste like actual hazelnut, which you'd think would be something a coffee drinker could take for granted, but we've been disappointed in the past.  I'd never tried coffee from the Wolfgang Puck brand before, but our positive experience with Hawaiian Hazelnut has definitely gotten me interested in trying other varieties.<br /><br />The hazelnut flavor is pretty bold and full bodied, which is nice, but there is no bitterness or acidity to be found.  This suits me just fine since I enjoy a milder roast, but people who enjoy their coffee strong and dark might not enjoy this blend as much.<br /><br />We'll definitely be repurchasing this coffee when we run out.

review/summary: NOT a K-CUP, be sure you want to buy a pod (not k-cup)
review/text: I, too, did a search on k-cups and Wolfgang Puck and this item came up.  I did not realize these were not k-cups until after I received them.  I read the other reviews and noted that grocery items were not returnable.  However, I thought I would try my luck and spoke with a customer representative.  I indicated to the rep that this item came up if you searched k-cups so it was a little misleading and I mistakenly purchased them thinking that they were k-cups and that I could use them in my Keurig machine.  The rep was extremely nice and helpful and offered to give me a full refund on my purchase (and I purchased 2 packs of the pack of 3 pods so I had 6 boxes in total).  He told me to keep them anyway since I couldn't return them but I received a full refund from Amazon.  Amazon is the BEST when it comes to customer service - that must be why I shop here again and again.  I offered to return the pods (I had not even opened the outer Amazon cardboard box yet) but the rep said that I couldn't return them due to the nature of the item.  The same flavor k-cups are great - I love them!

review/summary: Delicious! Using with My K-Cup
review/text: For some reason they are no longer making Wolfgang Puck Hawaiian Hazelnut K-Cups, my absolute favorite flavor. After I got over my shock and sadness I looked around at other options and found these. 54 pods for $20? Yes please! I put the coffee into the My K-Cup attachment for my Keurig and brew that way, and the taste is the same (if not better) than the K-Cups were!<br /><br />A disclaimer: I still have no idea what these pods are actually meant to be used in. I didn't even know what I was getting when I purchased it. At first I thought it was just loose coffee inside individual packages, which is close but not accurate - inside the package is the loose coffee inside a filter.<br /><br />I first tried to just stick the filter and coffee in the My K-Cup, and the result was pretty watery. So then I decided to rip the filter open and dump the loose coffee into the My K-Cup. This works great, although it takes 1 and a half packs per My K-Cup, so just keep that in mind if you are purchasing these!

review/summary: Substitution
review/text: This was a re-order of the pods which are very good.  Ordered three boxes and gave them to friends because I told them it was great.  Only later found out that "instant coffee packets" of the product had been substituted.  UGH!  Big let down .. will go to BB&B for purchases next time.

review/summary: THESE ARE *NOT* K-CUPS!
review/text: Come on, Amazon - correct the description for this product or correct the search feature so these don't come up as K-cups. I'll go to Bed, Bath and Beyond for these... and maybe the rest of my K-cup needs as Amazon just isn't getting the job done here.<br /><br />(And yes, before the trolls start in on me for not reading, I understand I should have read every word on the page - but honestly... who has time for that, lol?)

review/summary: Pods are torn and coffee weak
review/text: I fell for the 30% off and tried these pods for my Senseo.  There is less coffee per pod than the Timothy's or Fratello's.  Granted this was a light roast, the coffee was still very weak.<br /><br />But the biggest offense?  The first 4 out of 5 coffee pods out of the box were torn (or rather, ripped just enough that the grounds are spilling out).  The vacuum packs were intact.  Just the paper on the actual pods were ripped.  What gives?  Avoid these overpriced pods and tell WP to send them back into redevelopment!

review/summary: DO NOT BUY!!!
review/text: I purchased these pods believing they were k pods.  I than went out and bought a single use kcup to use this coffee which smelled delicious upon opening, but than I brewed it.  The coffee had an overwhelming smell and taste of cigarettes.  Horrible purchase and horrible seller with no return policy.....do not purchase unless you want Wolfgang puck cigarette coffee

review/text: This so far, is the best poundcake mix I have used that is gluten free. Its tastes great, and it does not crumble or fall apart after cooking it and flipping it out of the pan, or when cutting the slices to serve.

review/summary: Need to eat
review/text: I have not tried this brand before today, because in my B&M store it is 19.00 a box.(I still thought it was high for a cake mix on Amazon, but bought it anyway). It is really wonderful.  I found that it made a reg. bundt cake and a loaf pan ( so many Wfgf mixes make a single layer).  My bundt pan must be smaller because  the first time I filled it too full and had an oven issue and this time I was able to fill a loaf , and a bundt pant 3/4 way up , and they rose right to the top of both pans.  My family loved it enough to fight over who was going to get the last box for their birthday cake.. and I loved it enought to eat the whole piece , something I hae seldom done since the WFGF diagnosis .  This is really yummy ,  and I will buy it again.

review/summary: Pretty good deal
review/text: If you like sloppy joes and can't seem to get it right from scratch, this might be for you. The price of a little packet at the grocery store is $1.79 for about 1.5 ounces, so it makes this a pretty good deal. That is unless you find it on sale. I add a little ketchup at the end for the sweetness.

review/summary: Just plain awesome
review/text: Loved this gum. It was slightly, slightly stale when I got it, but still delicious. I still have some left (purchased it like a year ago or so) and its pretty stale now, but again, still flavorful. Love this gum, love this flavour, wish they made more of it more often, and that it was easier to get.<br /><br />If you like black licorice, get this gum for sure. Makes a good gift too (if the person likes licorice and/or is nostalgic)

review/summary: Sweet Nostalgia
review/text: A while back somebody sent me an e-mail quiz which asked which of the following products, names, fads, etc you remember from when you were a teen in the 50s.  That person said that they remembered everything but Black Jack chewing gum.  I did remember it and wondering what happened to it I put a search on the internet and to my surprise found that it was still around and available for sale.<br />So I ordered it from Candy Crate and it came very quickly which impressed me.  I now have the pleasure of handing out packs of Black Jack gum to amaze all those of my age group.  Love the expression on their faces.

review/summary: I'm noticing a trend here...
review/text: EVERY candy I have reviewed has been given 5 stars. I think that shows how greatly the value of sweetness is appreciated in this world!<br /><br />I love Black Jack gum -- I never ate it when I was a kid-- I was too busy acquiring and devouring Chiclets and Clark Bars and Sen Sen and Sky Bars -- but once I tried Black Jack as a 13 year old going on 40, I tried it and LOVED it.<br /><br />The wonderful taste is unusual, memorable, deep, lasting and luxurious. It doesn't die on you like some gums do.<br /><br />AND -- if you put at least 2 sticks of this marvelous black gum in your mouth and chew them thoughtfully, you can  WRAP THEM AROUND your front teeth and then smile at people - watch them laugh -- LOL!!!

review/summary: A year past expiration....
review/text: After chewing quite a few packs and giving away even more to friends,I noticed that the expiration date was July 31, 2010.... that is coming up on one year past expiration. (today is July 3, 2011)<br /><br />Despite the fact that the gum tastes fine, I can't leave a good review because of the lack of concern on the part of the Seller.<br /><br />Black Jack gum is good, Selling expired products is not.
