review/summary: The Best Wine Gums ever.I have tried every differetn Wine Gums product I could find
review/text: I have tried every Wine Gums product I could find. Maynard's are the very best for flavor and texture. All the other brands chew as if they have been left out to dry. Maynard's have a softer feel.

review/summary: Pretty bad...
review/text: The first wine gums I had ever tried were Gustaf's that I ordered here from Amazon. At first I thought they were a little hard, but I really started to like that about them. They last longer for one thing. Anyway, I decided I loved them and came to order more. I happened to notice that Maynard's had a much better rating, considering they cost quite a bit more and I thought I'd try them. Big mistake. For more than $30 with shipping I received three small bags of soft, sort of stretchable gummies that don't compare in any way to Gustaf's, (which came in three huge bags). Both companies make a grape-ish flavor that is pretty disgusting, but I could at least eat the Gustaf version. The Maynard's grape flavor tasted like poison. I would never order these again, but I'm going to order the Maynard's right about now.

review/summary: Best Microwaved Gumbo Mix
review/text: I've tried canned gumbo and boxed mixes for years and this is the best. What I do is put in a can of cut okra, 3/4 link of smoked sausage, one rib of finely diced celery in a microwave bowl with about 6 cups water. render sausage first then, put in celery and microwave about 4 more minutes. Then, put in mix and water and cook for 25 minutes. Be careful after about 10 minutes if it starts running over, you may need to cook it on 70% power. If gets too thick just add water; or if too thin, you can add some of that jarred dark roux you can buy in walmart. Its called Kary's dark Cajun roux, but drain the oil first, only use the flour.

review/summary: really good tasting snack
review/text: i didn't know if i liked this taste or not. but a couple days later when i finished off the bag i decided that yes i really did like this snack. it doesn't have any slimey or greasey taste to it. my mouth does not get any weird slimey or greasey taste in it at all from this snack. it just tastes really good and it is fun to snack on. after i open the bag up i have to refrigerate it to keep them fresh. old wisconsin hard wood smoke sausage... it tastes really good. and i can see into the bag even before i opened it that there were no small chunks of grease or anything else in there. you can't go wrong with this product. i bought two more bags for snacking probably while i'm watching a movie. you might like this meaty snack. mine is delicious.

review/summary: Low fat, high fiber -- and great taste!
review/text: This cereal has just about everything: great crunch, lots of interesting "bits" (cranberries, nuts, etc.), and it's wonderfully filling.  Two-thirds of a cup doesn't sound like a lot, but with this stuff and 1/2 C of skim milk, it's a decent serving.<br /><br />If you're on Weight Watchers, this will fit right in: a serving with skim milk is only 4 points -- not bad for a nice filling breakfast.  Add some fresh fruit, and you're set to go.<br /><br />Amazon's price is quite good, too.  This stuff is sky high in the supermarket if you can find it.  Yes, you have to buy 5 packages, but a little goes a long way -- I have it 2-3 times a week, and I'm not getting tired of it at all.<br /><br />All in all, a good value: healthy, filling, and great taste.

review/summary: Crunchy, tastes great & is healthy!
review/text: This is, as all of their cereals I've ordered so far are fresh, high quality, and wonderful tasting cereals. The only downside is since the ingredients are so dense, the packages are small, but a serving size is only 2/3 cup-honestly I eat more than that as one serving though. The best value for this brand is the 21 oz. Swiss Crunch which is heavenly w/ assorted grains, coconut, hazelnuts, and raisins. I caution you IF you eat this item dry as a snack, premeasure it or you will find you have consumed the entire 11 oz. bag without realizing it-yes, it's that good!

review/summary: Apples, Cranberries and Cinnamon without Fattening Nuts
review/text: The graphics on these bags are very enticing -- cereal, cranberries and apples falling onto a spoon, looking cool and fresh.  I'm not a big fan of granola so when I opened the bag, I assumed it would taste like granola with chunks of crunch.  Instead, it's like a marriage of crisped and flaked cereals of assorted sizes and shapes, with a bonus of dried cranberries, apples and cinnamon.  The cranberries and apples amply satisfy the sweet and chewy texture which is popular in cereals offered by Familia, and the lack of nuts like almonds and hazelnuts reduces the fat content.  This Familia Swiss Crunch Muesli is a high fiber cereal but it is not a reduced sugar cereal.<br /><br />I was concerned because the ingredients did not list the coconut which was the buying point for me personally.  I contacted the company to inquire and received a response within hours.  The cinnamon which will be described better on future packaging is really what gives this cereal a little boost, not coconut which is listed in the current description.  Future packages will read, "cranberries, apples, honey and cinnamon."  Additionally, the current ingredients list "cocoa powder" which will be corrected to read "coconut powder."  Although I was disappointed in the lack of coconut, I still think this is a 5 star cereal, tasty, balanced, packaged well and produced by a solid company.  If I want to increase the fat content in my portions, I can add a little dried unsweetened coconut.<br /><br />I prefer this foil packaging, especially in smaller portions like the 11 ounce size because I have a Tupperware container that holds it perfectly.  One can, however, simply use the attached tab and seal the bag without putting it into another container.  Since each bag contains 6 servings, a larger size family could conceivably never need to seal the bag.  I've had this muesli only with skim milk thus far, but I will next be having it with either low-fat homemade or Fage Greek yogurt.  I also intend to use this in a recipe for muffins and top them off with a drop of fresh berry jam or almond butter.  This wasn't exactly what I was expecting, but it's a fabulous cereal nevertheless and I'll buy it again.

review/summary: An Excellent and Healthy Choice for Anyone's Diet
review/text: A quality product from Bio-familia, a Swedish company that developed "Bircherm&uuml;esli" a product so popular and successful  that made the name Muesli famous all over the world.<br /><br />If you need a high fiber and protein snack option for your diet, this is absolutely a very good product. You can't go wrong and the best of all: excellent taste and quality, and for a pack of five this comes at a good value.<br /><br />Sometimes your diet will require you eat frequently and consciously, and in those cases you need to have a snack at hand when you get hungry, in order to keep your metabolism high all day long. In such cases finding a good and balance option could be hard. I love this 5-pack and I always have one at home an another pack at the office. I try to eat five or more times a day, so in my case having a healthy snack at hand wherever I am when I get hungry is a priority.<br /><br />Since you are checking this product I have to guess that you are probably a person that cares about what you eat, either because you are interested in losing weight, getting in better shape or just be healthier and keep in good shape, so I will share my own experience in the weight loss game and staying in shape game<br /><br />My own successful personal experience in weight loss is based on strategies to boost metabolism. Don't stress yourself, eat frequently, eat just what you need each time, and choose wisely what you are going to eat, supplement your diet. Yet simple and it works. I loss more than 200 lbs and shrink my waist (from 44 to 32), and I have been able to keep in good shape since then. Every single aspect of my life has improved since then.<br /><br />Keep in mind that a good diet is just part of the equation, you also need a plan that helps you keep on track and monitor your condition. Based on my own personal experience I can recommend some tools that you may want to consider, to establish your own strategies for boosting your metabolism, loosing weight, and even more important keeping that weight off. They are:<br /><br />- "Ultrametabolism: The Simple Plan for Automatic Weight Loss" by Mark Hyman. A practical an realistic plan for weigh loss.<br />- "The ABS Diet", which is another very practical, readable, insightful, and inspirational book, that also includes an exercise plan.<br />- A Body Fat Monitor or Scale. This will help you monitor your progress, to assure that the weight you are loosing is fat (fat lost = increased metabolism) and not muscle, water or bone mass (decreased metabolism).<br />- A Heart Rate Monitor Wrist Watch. This is an excellent tool that will help you monitor and control your Heart Rate in order to keep yourself in a burning fat state (increased metabolism).<br />- "Heart Monitor Training for the Complete Idiot", a primer on the use of Heart Rate Monitors for health improvement or weight control.<br /><br />If you want to star focusing only on your diet, the first two may be worth considering. If you exercise, or want to start doing it right, the last threee are for you. If you do both, all the recommended options can improve your results.<br /><br />I am 39 years old, With the help of the tools I just mentioned not only I went fro size 44 to size 32 pants, but also obtained substantial benefits that included weight control, cardiovascular improvements, lowered blood pressure, and improved muscular-skeletal strength and flexibility, but also the myriad of mental and psychological benefits derived from being in the best shape of my life.

review/summary: False Package Advertising!  Almost NO Fruits!
review/text: Check out the pictures I uploaded to see for yourself: it is mostly corn flakes type cereal with negligible amount of tiny fruit bits (I couldn't taste it really, and had to really search to find the said ingredients).<br /><br />Following careful scrutiny, I did find some fruit...mostly cranberries that are not that tangy (you may be fooled into thinking they are raisins if you're not paying attention) and some dried apple bits.  But that's totally not tastable.<br /><br />Also, if you read their description (on the website and on the actual product), they mention coconut, but that was not in the cereal or the ingredients list.<br /><br />Basically I was super frustrated at the advertised description, and image on the cereal bag:  the large delicious looking red fruit, and large coconut bits (all of which are things I love, BUT DID NOT TASTE IN THIS CEREAL!).  The things I thought were coconut bits I think are actually apple bits on the picture.  Still misleading.<br /><br />I would recommend trying Kashi instead if you want the healthy cereal with sizable fruit and nut.  Or buy some flakes-cranberry-almond cereal (very common) that provides a better taste than this for a fraction of the cost (apparently the style of taste they're after...afterall, the major ingredients here are corn flakes and cranberry).<br /><br />ALSO THIS IS BAD FOR SNACKING!  Huge hassle!  The cereal bits are way too small to comfortably grab out of the bag and toss in your mouth...some of the bits are so small they'll easily fall through your fingers.  And it feels like you're eating corn flakes.  This is definitely meant to be a cereal first and foremost.<br /><br />PS.  The bag looks nice, but another thing I realized is how much hassle a bag is:  they have a little sticky tape thing that you're supposed to re-close the bag shut, but I'm just so much more used to closing box tops.  The amount you get is also quite little.  Probably 2.5 cereal bowls.  Wouldn't recommend this product for the money.<br /><br />IN SUMMARY:<br />- false advertising: negligible fruit<br />- corn flakes type cereal<br />- not ideal for snacking<br />- too expensive for quality and quantity you get<br />- bag may be a hassle<br /><br />----------------<br />This is an updated listing.

review/text: I've ordered this cereal twice so far from Amazon.  I can find it at our local health market but it costs more locally than buying a three pack from Amazon.  The 'Best By' dates are always good (this last pack had 13 months from purchase).  My family really enjoys the taste, though it doesn't taste like Kelloggs Raisin Bran.  Peace one cup serving has 190 calories; 2g fat; 170mg sodium; 44g total carbs; 8g dietary fiber; 9g sugar; 6g protein.  Kellogs one cup has same calories; 1g fat; 210mg sodium; 46g total carbs; 7g dietary fiber; 18g sugar; 5g protein. This may not be for everyone, but I love a raisin bran cereal and knowing Peace has half the sugar makes me love it even more.

review/text: I never enjoyed coffee the way most people do.  It just didn't taste good to me.  This has turned me into a coffee drinker.<br /><br />I got some samples of this recently, but waited to try them since I assumed they would be too sweet for my taste.  The mocha was just ok, but the caramel flavor I loved.  This one also is delicious.<br /><br />I like the way this foams a bit on the top to add to the creaminess.  I had tried Cappuccino once at Starbucks and didn't like it but this is delicious.  It tastes like desert to me, or something to drink with desert.  I appreciate the fact that this isn't overly sugary.  And, unlike the mocha flavor, in this one I can taste the rich coffee flavor.<br /><br />Nescafe has a winning product here.  It's hard to imagine anyone not liking these.  If they can turn even a non-coffee drinker into a fan, they have hit a home run with these beverages.

review/summary: A Good Combination of Flavors and Textures
review/text: As the weather changes, I am on the lookout for this season's beverage.  Tried quite a few of the k-cup offerings, but wanted to try something different.<br /><br />Nescafe Memento Cappuccino is a very good cool weather choice.  The foamy top layer gives you the feel of a coffee shop beverage, without having to leave the comfort of your home.  Per their description, the premixed packets contain real coffee, milk and sugar, which is what, captured my attention in the first place.  Many of the coffee companies, in an attempt to help the consumer cut calories offer that horrible stevia stuff, which in my opinion leaves a horrible aftertaste and I avoid any products with that or sucralose as an ingredient.<br /><br />Not too sweet, not too bitter, a good combination of flavors and textures for that midafternoon break from the rest of the world.

It's not a hardcore coffee so if you want that - drink a cup of coffee. The Cappuccino flavor is by far and large my fav as it has the most coffee flavor. My friend tried the Mocha flavor and really loved it - I felt that it was not 'coffee' enough for me.

Going in, I told myself that there are positives about instant coffee: (1) the packets are easy to carry & easy to mix (time saver), (2) the flavor has improved over the years, and (3) there are more varieties today (even Starbucks packages instant coffee).<br /><br />What I was looking for in the Nescafe Memento Cappuccino was (1) a not so calorie laden coffee and (2) an afternoon or after dinner dessert coffee.<br /><br />The Memento Cappuccino is not a coffeehouse cappuccino because it isn't as strong as the cappuccino that I purchase at my coffeehouse.  However, it isn't bitter, so I do give it points for that since I can remember the days when instant coffee was very bitter.  I followed the instructions & mixed the packets contents with 8oz of hot water in a 10oz cup. The ratio of milk to coffee was good & the mixed drink tasted like a cappuccino.  The mix produced a slight foam that sat on top of the coffee for quite a while.  The mix contains sugar, so I did not need to add more sugar (but those who like a sweeter coffee will want to add more sugar).<br /><br />Verdict:  Nescafe Memento is a decent, convenient coffee packet to have on hand for those times when you want a cappuccino but don't want to brew one or go to your coffeehouse to purchase one.  With the individual packets, it is also easy to throw a few packets into your suitcase or backpack.

review/summary: Mediocre
review/text: I received a sample of this product in the mail. I really like a good cup of coffee and brew a pot in the morning and often enjoy a mid-afternoon instant coffee.<br /><br />I've bought Nescafe products in the past and been happy, but this particular flavor tastes off. It does have some weird foam at the top of the cup, but in no way does this coffee resemble anything you'd get at a good coffeehouse. I'd rather drink International Coffee than this. Definitely not worth the 100 calories.

review/summary: Great for my nine-month-old
review/text: My 9.5-month-old son loves every food we've given him. When he reached 9 months we added these yogurts to the menu, and he absolutely adores them. I love the fact that they don't have to be refrigerated, so are easy to toss in the diaper bag, use when we're out and about, etc. I wish they didn't have any sugar in addition to what naturally occurs in milk and fruit, but they're still better than pudding (that's why I didn't rate them 5 stars). I'm so happy to see them available on Subscribe & Save because our local grocery store charges $3.49/four-pack and we go through a four-pack every week. The only thing I wish they'd make is a variety pack so that I didn't have to get six four-packs of all the same flavor. Oh, and I hope Amazon will start carrying the pear flavor, too. (Can someone explain to me why the peach is 25 cents cheaper per four-pack than the banana?)

review/summary: Yummy treat for sweet craving
review/text: Currently on the Weight Watchers diet. Needed sweet, portable item to take with me that stops the craving. Tried so many others I can't even list them all. This is by far my favorite. Not too strong. The mint is definitely wintergreen, not peppermint or spearmint.<br /><br />Each box contains a LOT of mints - compared to other mints its reasonable priced - a box lasts for about a week in my desk at work...depends on how often you eat one. Probably something like 100+ mints per box (smaller than a dime size, but not tiny).<br /><br />Mint NOT filling or anything, just helps with giving you something in your mouth (if you don't chew / bit it, it could last for 15 minutes) and sweet tasting. Flavor lasts after mint for ~10 minutes.

review/text: I'm on auto delivery for this item. I enjoy sugar free mints and it is around 1.50 per can instead of the 1.99 at my local target.  That alone is reason to buy in bulk.  I keep a tin in my purse, in the car, at my desk at work, my husband carries one in his pocket.  In the workplace, I never want to "wonder" if my breath is offensive.  WHen you become a certain age, that is not "cute".  Also its good to carry one in your purse or briefcase because you never know when you might feel sick in public and the mint helps settle an upset stomach.

review/summary: Perfect for my sweet tooth!
review/text: I'm new to the food allergy world.  So when I found these at my local Whole Foods, I figured it was worth trying.<br /><br />Unlike some of the Enjoy Life cookies, these chocolate bars don't taste "special."  They taste like regular dark chococate.  The consistency is normal and not weird.  They're not overly sweet or bitter.<br /><br />The bar is scored into 4 pieces.  I usually break each piece in half so it provides 8 perfect bites.<br /><br />Nutritionally, it's only 200 calories for the entire bar.  Sometimes, I find that 1/2 the bar is enough... so it's a perfect 100 calorie snack.<br /><br />They are a bit pricey but so are regular premium chocolate bars, so I guess it's not too bad.  Here's a tip, if you buy them from Whole Foods, you can buy the box (12) and get 10% off.  They seem to run about $2 each everywhere.

I ordered this on July 19 it wasn't shipped until July 26 I received it then on July 31. Which was the weekend and we were gone all weekend. So they sat on our doorsept all weekend. But they did put an ice pack in the packaging. So that helped. My daugther came home and found them and put them in refri. right away for me so when I got home and tried one they were fine. I think if you are not in a hurry order them. Otherwise find another source to get these bars. They are good and taste just like a real chocolate bar.

I made this and no one could tell the difference between the sugar free and the real cake mix/frosting. The cake mix held up well and remained very moist. I used the yellow cake mix and chocolate frosting. I used the 2 9 inch pans and made sure to follow directions for timing correctly. They do not take as long to bake or at as high of temp. I also used a metal knife to apply frosting and made to sure to run warm water over the knife when frosting the layers of cake. This helped to make sure that the frosting did not stick to the knife and cause the cake to tear. I did this several times and came out with even frosting on cake. My only problem was trying to not eat the whole jar of frosting when making the dessert!

I'm sure this sugar free version has way too much artificial sweetener to make it taste as sweet as it does. Maybe they should just have a low sugar version instead, or sweeten with a natural sweetener like stevia. These were my halloween cupcakes, maybe I shouldve pranked people with it but the diarrhea was so horrible I was afraid it might dehydrate someone!

review/summary: tastes great, but will cause extreme distress...
review/text: It bakes up and tastes just like the real thing. I picked this up because I thought it had Splenda, which doesn't give me any problems. But then I found it had Maltitol--which brings down the wrath of god on your digestive system if you dare to ingest more than the recommended amount. I recommend trying a very small piece and then waiting a few hours to see if you have adverse effects.<br /><br />So it's great for diabetics and gastric bypass people but--stick to the exact (or less) portion size recommended on the box. Not even gas-x, ginger, or tums can help you if you eat more than that. And I didn't even have it with frosting--this was one three by three inch square of plain yellow cake.<br /><br />I'll stick to making my own mixes with a combination of Splenda and stevia from now on. But if the giant, indigestible molecules of Maltitol and other sugar alcohols (do not confuse with alcohol that you drink) do not affect you in any way---rock on!

review/summary: What a discovery!
review/text: I was recently given a jar of this honey by my son, who knows I'm always on the lookout for natural remedies, and I must say this stuff is amazing! The Watson and Son honey has a remarkable golden color, but isn't transparent like the processed honey you get at most stores. I gave some to a close friend that has suffered from chronic ulcers to see how it lived up to the hype and he asked me where he could get more a few days later. It really helped soothe his stomach and I'm hoping it could eventually heal the problem like I have read in many other reviews. Great stuff all the way around!

Highly recommend anyone with stomach issues to give this a try. I also gave some to my girl friend when she was coming down with a sore throat and it stopped it in it's tracks! This stuff rocks!

Half of the content of the jar was all over the inside of the box. The lid was loose on the jar & came off without breaking the security seal.  The jar is plastic with a plastic lid and maybe due to the hot weather we've had here the past few days but it did not fare well in transit. I'm going to try ordering this honey from another maker, hopefully in a glass jar with a quality lid.

review/text: This Organic Lemon Lavender Mint herbal tea blends three greats -- lemon, lavender and mint -- into a very tasty healthy harmony -- that is good in itself. But also very good hot or with ice -- when brewed with a good black or green tea. I like one bag of this Lemon Lavender Mint for every two bags of black or green tea -- for kind of an Earl Grey Lavender variant of Plantation Mint. This tea may seem moderately costly at 25 cents per count -- but way worth the price -- especially when gotten in bulk and blended with more black or green tea. Good any time of the year any time of the day in any way +++

review/summary: Works well on cabbage worms and easy to use
review/text: We tried a preparation containing bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) 10-15 years ago to kill grubs in the lawn.  It was a failure.  I later read that manufacturers were shipping dead preparations.  (Bt is a family of bacteria living naturally in soil.  The bacteria in the preparation must be live to be useful.)<br /><br />Now (June 2011) we had cabbage worms eating the leaves of our young Brussels sprout plants.  Extension services recommended Bt, so we bought this product.  It worked!  The directions are not very thorough, but the package is a very effective dust sprayer.  Shake the package, aim the orifice and give the bottle a good steady squeeze and you get a nice dust spray.  Focus on the new buds.  Our plants are doing fine without worm damage in the new growth a week after treatment.<br /><br />Bt breaks down in sunlight [...].  We sprayed the dust just before nightfall.

review/summary: Effective against tomato hornworms!
review/text: I'm not a fan of using chemicals like sevin dust, so this product was a last resort before turning to that. My tomatoes were under attack by tomato hornworms! After hand-picking off those I could find (they camoflage themselves VERY well!) I dusted the plants with the Garden Dust. It was akward at first, but the best way to do was to aim the bottle flat, and then squeeze. This stuff is is best used when the plants are dry and in the late afternoon.  Within two days I saw dead hornworms, apparently ones I missed or ones that may have hatched, hanging limp and lifeless from the plants. I haven't seen any since, nor has any other pests been a problem. I highly recemmend this as a good organic alternative to chemicals. The only downside is you'll need to re-apply after a heavy rain.

As always though, Amazon took care of things. It was still the same mix, just different packaging.

Although the other product, their "Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Mild Short Shots (120 beef sticks per bag)" wasn't bad and I rated it four stars, I found the little sample pack of this jerky to be the real highlight of the order.  I'm strongly considering ordering a pack of this jerky, or a couple packs in a couple different flavors now despite having just gotten the package of snack sausage today, it's that good.<br /><br />Addendum:  I did order two 8 ounce packs based on the sample they sent me with my first order, and I just got them Friday.  The quality is consistant with the sampler pack, this is a wonderful beef jerky.  Fairly easy to chew, not at all tough.  Nice flavor that I'd describe as a mix of soy sauce and slightly smokey perhaps, with just a hint of sweetness.  They again sent a sample, this time of their barbeque flavor.  I liked it but I do think the Teriyaki is better.  Still, I may review the BBQ flavor since it was good as well.  I also ordered some of their vennison jerky, which is flavored well (smokey and some soy flavor) but not cut the same, the vennison jerky is made from pressed pieces of meat, not small whole dried strips from what I can see.  Still, I'd also consider the vennison jerky for times when I want something different then this flavor.

review/text: Buffalo Bills 3.5 oz Teriyaki Beef Jerky<br /><br />I ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IA99FS">Buffalo Bills 8oz Barbecue Country Cut Beef Jerky Pack</a> and got a free sample of Buffalo Bills 8oz Teriyaki Beef Jerky with it.<br /><br />If Virgil had eaten this stuff it would be defined as "the food of Gods"  If you like Jerky it doesn't get any better than this, at least I haven't eaten it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.  Since I'm a diabetic I should say it has 2 grams of carbohydrates per 1 ounce of product.  I eat it as a dessert, about 1 ounce at a time.<br /><br />Gunner  March. 2010

review/text: The Country Cut beef jerky is wonderful. I never thought beef jerky could be so tender and tasty. No more boring snacks - the Teriyaki flavor makes this beef jerky a special treat every time.

review/summary: Tough and too greasy for my taste
review/text: Not a very good jerky.  I prefer several other drier jerky products.  They responded to my criticisms and are sending me a sample of another product from their store.
