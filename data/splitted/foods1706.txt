review/summary: Roasted and salted to perfection
review/text: These cashews are excellent and have just enough salt. In general, most prepared foods have too much salt. Most Americans exceed their daily salt intake by two or three times the FDA suggested intake. Finally you have a lower sodium dry roasted nut that is fresh, roasted to perfection and reasonably priced. If you want more salt, lightly coat the nuts with some olive oil and break out your salt shaker.

review/text: If you sign up for Amazon subscription for this product, you will not be able to find cheaper cashews per oz anywhere! Even at the local supermarket the prices are higher.<br /><br />The quality of the cashews seems great. I haven't had any that were "bad."<br /><br />I wish this company offered unsalted cashews on Amazon. Sometimes when you're cooking you don't want the added salt in these cashews.

review/summary: Back to Nature Jumbo Cashews
review/text: I'm glad these cashews are available, especially since Planters no longer provides them.<br /><br />Both brands are similar except the Back to Nature brand contains many more "burnt" cashews than Planters did.<br /><br />For the price charged for the product, I feel they could make a little more effort to ensure their cashews are not overly roasted.  The cashews that aren't burnt (which are a small portion, relatively speaking) are very good.

review/text: These arrived in great shape with very little breakage.  Very fresh tasting, nice jumbo size. Not overly salty; did not notice any fishy taste or smell.<br /><br />Cashews are a very healthy nut- loaded with important minerals and nutrients, these are not only a tasty snack, but an excellent nutritional choice.<br /><br />"nature's vitamin pill,"<br />Some salient points:<br /><br />- botanical name Anacardium occidentale, the cashew is a close relative of mangos, pistachios, poison ivy and poison oak<br /><br />- Nutritional facts:  5 grams of protein per ounce and high levels of the essential minerals iron, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, copper and manganese.<br /><br />Cashew nuts do have a relatively high fat content (12 grams per ounce, 2 grams saturated fat), but it is considered "good fat." Optimal fat ratio in the nut, 1:2:1 for saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated, (ideal ratio for optimal health)<br /><br />-high levels of monounsaturated fatty acids; help support healthy levels of low good (HDL) cholesterol.<br /><br />Repeat buyer.<br /><br />Do your body some good and fill up on cashews!

review/text: The only suggestion that I would pass on is that I refrigerate after opening because it takes me awhile (a few weeks) to go through the bag.<br />Also, I decided that they were cheaper over time than even Costco's cashews which are a bargain.  That is because Costco uses more oil and so they are more of a grabber.  But these have that good cashew flavor.

review/summary: Back to Nature Jumbo Cashews - 10 oz.
review/text: I purchased these nuts at my local Publix in their Greenwise section.  I love the Back to Nature brand of snacks (cookies & crackers) so I thought I'd give their nuts & mix nut varieties a go.<br /><br />I bought their almonds, cashews, and trail mix.  The cashews come in a 10 oz. resealable ziplock package.  There are 160 cal., 13 g fat, 100 mg sodium, 9 g carbs, 2 g sugar, & 5 g protein.<br /><br />The bag was filled with broken nuts and halves.  I couldn't get the seal to reseal for storage so I poured them into a plastic container.<br /><br />The nuts are sea salt roasted with no added oils.  I love the Back to Nature snacks, but this one is the exception.<br /><br />These were very pricy, dry, & tasteless nuts.  I was also disappointed by the term jumbo.  These are exactly the same size you buy in a regular grocery store.<br /><br />I have purchased goumet jumbo size cashews from mail order companies, and these did not quite measure up.  My Shikingnese Darby and I love to snack on nuts, but even she spit this one out.<br /><br />The product has many health benefits:  no artificial perservatives, no artificial ingredients., 100% natural, but when it comes to taste--I'll pass.

review/summary: Might as well be Planters - Not in same league as Pears
review/text: Bought these on the strength of other reviews.  That was a mistake.  A few comments, unbiased.<br /><br />The description "jumbo" is totally deceiving, and Amazon should, must, change the description.  I've written to suggest it as false advertising.  The nuts are no larger than what is found in a typical can of Planters whole cashews.<br /><br />Second, I doubt that more than half of the cashew mass comprises whole nuts.  Many pieces, compared again to whole nuts one can buy from Planters.<br /><br />Third, the last, and only, time that I ordered cashews via Amazon, I bought Pears Gourmet.  Now THOSE nuts are jumbo and unique, a completely different class.  Pieces made up about 25% of the tin.<br /><br />My next order no doubt will be Pears, but I must say I like the crunchiness as well of the smaller whole nuts that can be found at Kroger.  Nice to have choices.

review/summary: Its not bad, but it doesn't satisfy
review/text: I had the opportunity to digest a box of Quaker Oatmeal Squares Crunchy Oatmeal Cereal with a Hint of Brown Sugar, and the name of the product pretty much sums up whats in the box. To be honest, it is what it says it is, but not much more.  The product had a good crunch and the brown sugar flavoring tasted as it was.  But it struck me as sweet - maybe too sweet, to get the whole impact of the flavor.  Or, said another way, there wasn't any rich tones to what I was tasting, no nuances to the flavors. Would I buy it at the store?  Probably not.  The fiber content were higher, or maybe if they combined the brown sugar flavor with the cinnamon flavor there would be an encouragement to try it.  But as it stands, my month with the cereal wasn't one in which I looked forward to buying another box.  It was more like trying to get through the one I had.

Each piece is small enough to be finger food for little ones and grab-able in handfuls for adults. I've been snacking on it dry as well as in a bowl with milk and find it really versatile. Breakfast, lunch, dinnertime, evening snack...this cereal is a healthful option for any of those.

It only has a slight oatmeal taste and I would say the brown sugar is more than just a hint but the combination is really delicious. It also does not get soggy right away. It stayed pretty crunchy for a while. Even to the last drop, there was still a little bit of crunch left.<br /><br />Also, what I love is that it's healthy and isn't loaded with sugar. In fact, if you're used to really sweet cereals, this may not be for you as while it has some sweetness to it, it isn't overly sweet.<br /><br />If you're looking for a healthy alternative to regular cereal, this is definitely worth a try.

review/text: This cereal is crunchy oatmeal/fiber squares, and really does have just a hint of sweetness to it. I don't like overly sweet cereals, or cereals in which the sugar dissolves into the milk, and in this case neither is true.<br /><br />The ingredient list is as follows: Whole oat flour, whole wheat flour, brown sugar, maltodextrin, malted barley extract, molasses, salt, calcium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, natural flavor, reduced iron, sodium ascorbate, yellow 5, niacinamide (vitamin B3), BHT (preservative), zinc oxide, vitamin E, acetate, vitamin A palmitate, yellow 6, thiamin mononitrate (vitamin B1), pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamine B6), riboflavin (vitamin B2), and folic acid.<br /><br />One cup of cereal alone contains 210 calories; with half a cup of skin milk it is 250 calories. In comparison, wheaties contain 133 calories per cup of cereal alone, and Kashi Go Lean contains 140 calories. One cup of cereal also contains 5g of dietary fiber, and 6g of protein.<br /><br />Overall this is a tasty and healthy cereal, however it has a relatively high calorie count, and there are healthier alternatives available.

They are relatively filling though and with some fruit on top, they would make a good, quick breakfast for an adult getting ready to head out to work, with 4 hours until their lunch break.  But I don't feel it stands out much from other "healthy" cereals for adults.

review/summary: Reinforcing the posiitve we already knew about Quaker
review/text: Quaker Oats has been a staple in American business for the past century and is well known for a wide range of products, including Rice-a-Roni, granola bars Aunt Jemima Syrups, Gatorade and of course, Quaker Oatmeal.<br /><br />I don't personally eat a great deal of cereal and am not partial to Quaker's Life or Capt Crunch brands, but we must complement the company on its Oatmeal Squares product.  The squares are rather small and keep a good balance with milk - they do not become soggy in 60 seconds.  The brown sugar flavor is adult sensitive sweet and actually retain their flavor.  They could be included as a snack or as a light meal other than breakfast.  The amount needs to be watched as the calorie count can jump on one if not careful.<br /><br />It is refreshing to note that the classic companies continue to produce and quietly promote their quality products.<br /><br />Well done, Quaker Oats<br /><br />Dr. John Hogan  CHA CHE CMHS<br />HospitalityEducators<br />Hogan Hospitality

review/summary: Great finger food!!
review/text: Quaker Oatmeal squares is one of my kids favorite cereals. It is also great finger food and frequently is a part of kids snack bags. We never had the Brown Sugar variety and I just recently tried it out with my family. Really low on sugar it still has a really great taste. But in fact, all four flavors, Brown Sugar, Cinnamon, Golden Maple and New Honey Nut Quaker� Oatmeal Squares, are heart healthy* and deliver 46 grams of whole grains (that's 96%** of your minimum daily recommendation of whole grains), 5 grams of dietary fiber and 6 grams of protein per serving.<br />I also shared Brown Sugar Oatmeal Squares with few friends<br />Smart mamas like the ingredients including the amount of iron in this cereal. They were happy to find out there is only 7 grams of sugar in each serving, but it is still sweet and doesn't taste like cardboard.<br />Few of my friends read the list of ingredients several times looking for something they are not happy with. No luck - all the ingredients seem authentic. Group verdict - APPROVED<br />SNACK BAGS<br />I make my own for the kids. They normally include<br />one or two types of cereal, dry fruit (cranberry or raisins are easy to deal with and cheap), plantain chips)<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OVPK9G">Quaker Oatmeal Squares, Crunchy Oatmeal Cereal with a Hint of Brown Sugar, 14.5-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>

review/summary: Taste is important!
review/text: Is there anyone left who doesn't know the benefits of Quaker cereals? If so, I'll mention that part in a minute, because the most important thing, at least in our family, is taste. If it doesn't taste good, we'll never purchase the product. Oatmeal Squares not only tasted good, but was different, which I found surprising. Whole grains and brown sugar were mentioned on the box, but if you take a look at the ingredients, there's malted barley extract and molasses too. This crunchy oatmeal cereal isn't overly sweet, which is another plus. Here are some of the highlights:<br /><br />* 46 grams of whole grains per serving<br />* The crunchiness holds up in milk<br />* Makes a great snack<br />* Low in saturated fat and cholesterol<br />* Certified by the American Heart Association<br />* 5 grams of fiber and 6 grams of protein<br /><br />The cereal fills you up and stays with you, important, if you have busy mornings. Also, it's not messy, meaning, the squares don't flake. Moms can easily put some in a baggy for kids to snack on while doing errands.

review/summary: Excellent Cereal
review/text: I personally prefer oats to wheat, so I was anxious to try this cereal.  I am happy to report that I really like it.  It tastes great!  It is just slightly sweet, but not too much.  It will work well for breakfast or for a snack right out of the box.  The cereal has a satisfying crunch too.<br /><br />One of the negative reviews noted that the cereal contains artificial coloring (Yellow 5 and Yellow 6).  I too am puzzled why Quaker would want to color the cereal, and that is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  I suppose some marketing genius didn't like the color.  But Quaker oatmeal doesn't have coloring, and people buy plenty of that.  I hope that in the future Quaker worries more about how its products taste and less about how they look.

review/summary: Brown Sugar How Come You Taste So Good?
review/text: Who orders cereal in the mail? apparently I do. This box came, and It felt like there was a box of rocks in my hand!<br /><br />Oatmeal Squares are tiny boxes of brown sugary-ness, and they are heavy in more weighs than one (Im Punny). They taste very much like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003W07CN8">Golden Grahams Cereal, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 5)</a> BUT with a earthier, Hay like aftertaste. If that makes sense. about a 1/2 a cup would fill you right on up for the whole morning.<br /><br />I liked them well enough. Maybe would get them again in the future.

review/summary: yummy cereal!
review/text: Quaker Oatmeal Squares cereal with a hint of brown sugar is quite yummy. It's not bland, yet it's not too sweet either since it contains a hint of brown sugar. The taste kind of reminded me of Golden Grahams cereal. The cereal provides the right texture since it is crunchy and holds up in milk. The outside gets a little soggy after soaking in the milk for awhile, however the inside is still crunchy. The cereal is good too right out of the box as a snack, no milk needed.<br /><br />I also love how it is a healthy cereal as well. The box claims it provides 46 grams of whole grains per serving. There is 210 calories a serving, 9 grams of sugar, 0.5 grams of saturated fat, 190 mg of sodium, and 5 grams of fiber (19% daily value). Plus it's enriched with all those needed vitamins and minerals. Overall, it's an excellent choice for a healthy breakfast or as a go to snack.

review/summary: Pretty Good Cereal
review/text: Overall, I liked this cereal. It had some heft to it which I liked. It was supposed to have a hint of brown sugar, but I couldn't detect any. It did taste good right out of the box and with milk. It was better with a little sugar added.<br /><br />I would have given it 5 stars if I could have tasted the brown sugar and if the cereal had been a bit sweeter. As is, I gave it four stars, but I might still buy it if I saw it in the grocery store. It is pretty good, and I can always add a little sugar. And, it is supposed to be healthy too.

review/text: When ever anyone from my household go on a road trip Quaker Oatmeal Squares go along. You know you want to munch in the car but sweets are just not the way. We love having handfuls of Quaker Oatmeal Squares. They are just a touch sweet but even better they feel you up and you don't feel as if you just made a huge mistake. We eat them for breakfast too but more often as not they are a late night snack or a baggie full for the office.  We love them.

review/summary: Yummy, Filling & Healthy, too!
review/text: I love that my seven-year-old gets her fiber when eating these.  Even my toddler loves these!  They are tasty as a dry snack and even better with milk.  The texture is pleasant both ways as well, as long as you don't leave them in your milk long enough to get soggy!  The nutrition facts are great with 1 cup of cereal giving you 5g of fiber, 6g of protein, & only 9g of sugar, which isn't too bad compared to other breakfast cereals.  The ingredients are not perfect for my standards, but since my picky eater readily eats them, I'm willing to overlook that.  They have yellow 5 & yellow 6 in them.  I wish they didn't, but it's not that big of a deal to me.  I'm glad to see no high fructose corn syrup in these.  The only thing that keeps me from buying more of this cereal is the price.  I feel it's a little pricey, but it does taste great!

review/summary: Love these oatmeal squares!
review/text: Quaker Oatmeal Squares with a Hint of Brown Sugar are delicious! They do not get soggy in milk and have a mildly sweet taste that is not too sugary. The serving size (1 cup of cereal in 1/2 cup of skim milk) is a realistic portion, although I admit to not actually measuring out my serving, but rather eye-balling it. The carbohydrate-to-sugar ratio means that it will not deliver a sugar spike to your system, as is the case with very sugary cereals, and it will stick with you longer. These squares also make a good snack when mixed with hulled sunflower seeds, dried fruit bits, pretzel sticks, and/or some M&Ms -- obviously this will change the nutritional aspects of the cereal, but since you control what does into the snack mix you can make something that suits your own needs. This will be a regular cereal in my house!

review/summary: Crunchy goodness
review/text: I eat my cereal dry- right out of the box. Mostly for breakfast, but sometimes as a snack. Frosted Mini-Wheats is my "go-to" cereal, but  this had oats instead of whole wheat, so I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />And, now, it's my second favorite cereal. Ok, so it's didn't quite bump my "go-to" out of first place, but it came close, and in fact I think it will be my fave for breakfast (but not as much for snacking).<br /><br />It comes in a rather solid little square, with a great crunch and a good mouth feel, and it super-easy to eat right out of the box. My "Brown sugar" version had a hint of sweetness.<br /><br />Nutritionally it's two paws way up, with low fat, high fiber and not a lot of sugar.<br /><br />So- give it a try.

review/summary: Wait...what?! Bland?!
review/text: To everyone giving less stars on here for it being 'bland,' my brain is attempting not to spontaneously combust. It. Is. Oatmeal. It's not like you just went and bought a box of Lucky Charms. Do you know what else is bland? Cheerios! Doesn't make them any less amazing.<br /><br />This cereal is always exactly what I've been looking for in a cereal, something I've found almost every, single other brand, be it big label or generic lacks. It's actually filling. Sure, if you eat enough of any cereal, you'll feel full after a while, but this is the only one I've found where even a moderate bowlful leaves me feeling quite satisfied, almost like an actual bowl of oatmeal.<br /><br />Another good aspect is that it isn't overly sweet. And of course, it's whole grain and full of fiber, so, whee...it's even somewhat good for you.<br /><br />After having eaten cereal almost my entire childhood, I had lost the taste for it when I got older, and have, over the course of the past 15 years, not really had any interest in cereal products. However, since my 8 year old girl is a bit of a cereal aficionado and there is always random boxes of cereal in the house, I end up eating a bowl now and again. Until I discovered these. Suddenly, for the first time in a decade and a half, I'm back to a bowl of cold cereal every day for breakfast.<br /><br />Kudos to Quaker, you've made a breakfast cereal that I truly do enjoy.

review/summary: Tasty and healthy - what else can you say!
review/text: I love Quaker Oatmeal Squares in general, and "Hint of Brown Sugar" is my favorite variety. While tasting quite good, which is almost a prerequisite, this cereal is also relatively healthy. It is high (higher than most any other cereal) in soluble fiber, a key for reducing cholesterol, plaque buildup in arteries, etc. Most cereals have little or no soluble fiber, containing insoluble fiber (the main ingredient in many laxatives) instead.

review/text: Quaker's Oatmeal Squares provides 46 grams of heart-healthy whole grains in a cereal that tastes bold with just the right amount of sweetness.  I don't like overly sweet cereals, and Quaker's Oatmeal Squares fit my taste perfectly.  My kids, who typically do like sweet cereals, even liked Quaker Oatmeal Squares.<br /><br />One thing I really liked about this cereal is the way it made me feel full in a lasting way so I didn't eat too much of it, or snack on other things between breakfast and lunch.  This was quite helpful in my dietary goals.<br /><br />Quaker Oatmeal Squares come in four flavors, all of which are good.  If you like cereal and are looking for one that is both healthy and has a great taste, this cereal might be what you're looking for.

review/text: This cereal is faintly sweet, it suits an adult palate- not like the sugar blasted types that come in brightly colored boxes. The squares are a good size, not too big, and they hold milk nicely. The overall taste was rather bland, I really did not notice any brown sugar. I did like the fact that they are made of oatmeal for the cholesterol lowering properties. I did feel fuller than I do after having a breakfast of the flake cereal variety. It's a satisfying good, basic, cereal.

review/summary: Crunchy and lightly sweetened, good for snacking or with milk
review/text: Quaker Oatmeal Squares cereal consists of pillow-shaped dense nuggets of oaty cereal.  There's a light sweetness, more of a brown sugar taste, that comes in the bite.  The nuggets stay pleasantly crunchy in milk, but I found that I enjoyed them most of all as a snack.  The cereal feels like a grown-up version of Life; the differences are that it is less sweet than Life cereal) and has a much heartier texture and flavor.  I do think that fans of Life that are beginning to find it too crumbly or sweet will enjoy this cereal as an alternative for snacking or breakfast.<br /><br />Nutritionally, I like that it has a fairly high amount of protein for a cereal (6g per serving, without milk, vs. only 4g for Life cereal).  Surprisingly, though, it has slightly (1g per cup) more sugar than Life cereal, despite being less sweet generally.  It's also higher in calories at 210 per cup vs. 160 for a cup of Life.  (If you do these comparison's directly on Quaker's website, note that Life has a serving size of 3/4 cup whereas this has a serving size of 1 cup.  So, you have to adjust the nutritional info accordingly.)  Even with this though, I think Oatmeal Squares are more filling in the same amount and possibly more satisfying.  That may be due to the higher fiber content (5g per cup vs. &lt;3g per cup for Life).<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed it and would certainly buy it if the price were right and the mood struck me.

review/text: A handful of these Quaker Oatmeal Squares make a great snack. They are reasonably healthy and have a great taste of brown sugar with a big crunch.<br /><br />Unfortuanetly, they don't do so well in milk. Although they hold their crunch very well, they quickly lose their flavor in milk. I guess that the "hint of brown sugar" isn't enough to stand up to the milk. So, they becaome a somewhat flavorless crunchy breakfast. Not bad, but not so great.

review/summary: A Worthwhile Purchase From The Quaker People
review/text: As someone who was raised on Quaker oatmeal, I had the usual reservations about the product.  You know the list: bland, doesn't taste good, too runny, too thick.  But then, oatmeal tends to vary with preparation style.  That said, there was a bit of negative bias on my part going into trying the product.<br /><br />After eating a bowl of this product every day for a week (there's that much in the box, with a bit left over), I can honestly say that this product handily exceeded my low expectations.  Somehow, someway, the good people from Quaker actually found a way to make oatmeal consumption enjoyable, with just the right amount of additional ingredients to make it sweet, flavorful and filling.<br /><br />Specifically, the product works well with warm, hot or cold milk.  I tried the product a couple of times after pre-heating it in the microwave (high power for 15-20 seconds) and letting it sit for two to three minutes, and it was quite tasty, almost like having a bowl of actual oatmeal.  Like good, steel-cut Irish oatmeal, the product pairs well with a number of fruits, and I personally was very pleased with the combination of fresh blueberries and soft, ripe (but not overly-ripe) bananas that I added to it after I the let squares sit in warm milk for a few minutes.<br /><br />As for the product itself, it looks a lot like Nabisco's shredded wheat squares or General Mill's Cinnamon Toast Crunch (no small coincidence I suspect- a new competitive entrant, perhaps?).  It has a good texture and color, but I did notice that it took a bit of time for the squares to soften in milk (I personally do not like hard, crunchy cereal), especially if the milk is cold.  The product was sweet but not overly so, and a bit on the chewy side.  As an added plus, the product by itself is quite filling (and fosters good regularity.  That said, I do have one piece of strong advice (or perhaps a warning) for those like me who like to have their cup of French roast coffee with their cereal: expect to visit the bathroom shortly after having your meal and don't be too surprised if you feel magically five pounds lighter!<br /><br />Overall, I liked the product, and I think I will look for it in the stores.

review/text: Quaker Oatmeal Squares have a bland taste.  A hint of brown sugar coats each square, and it is exactly that - just a hint.  According to the label, this cereal has 210 calories per 1 cup serving without milk and 250 with skim milk. It boasts 5g dietary fiber and 2g soluble fiber.  For 210 or 250 calories, I think it should have more flavor, but for those who don't like any sugar in cereal, this works out well, especially if they prefer a high-fiber one.  Personally, I wouldn't purchase these oatmeal squares and would opt for a nutritious cereal with more taste.

review/summary: Crunchy, tasty, hearty cereal
review/text: The Quaker Oatmeal Squares Crunchy Oatmeal Cereal makes for a very tasty and satisfying breakfast. Taste is overall good as is the ability to remain crunchy while drenched in milk. In other words, it doesn't turn soggy that easily which is a very good thing. By the same token, it's not as hard as some granolas so it's easy to eat and digest. I tried this with soy milk -- but I assume the taste experience would be similar with regular milk. I would not hesitate to buy this in the future.<br /><br />The only caveat I have is a very minor one and more of a preference rather than any real issue. I also tried the Cinnamon version at the same time and slightly prefer the taste of that. This version -- "Hint of Brown Sugar" -- tastes a little like maple syrup. Now if you like maple syrup this would be a plus for you. But I don't and prefer the cinnamon flavor.

review/summary: Great tasting, but a bit high in calories
review/text: Overall, this is one of the better tasting cereals I've had in a longtime. Very crunchy, stays crunchy in milk for a while, and while there is a distinct brown sugar flavor, it is not overly sweet.<br /><br />The main downside is that the cereal is fairly high in calories: 1 cup (dry) is 210. When you figure that the average bowl is 1.5 to 2 cups, and factor in milk, you're approaching 500 calories. That's a lot for breakfast.<br /><br />So while Quaker Oatmeal Squares passes the taste test, you may want to use a measuring cup when eating.

review/summary: Does Double Duty
review/text: It seems, having a look at other Voices' reviews, that I'm not alone in discovering that Quaker Oatmeal Squares make an excellent snack all on their own (and in fact, with the exception of one bowl with milk, this is how I consumed my box within a very few days). However, that's not to say that they're not good with milk.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of oats (in fact, I cook oats in broth and have them as a side dish) so I was happy to have the opportunity to sample this for review. First, those who aren't all that familiar with oats should be aware that they not only contain a fair amount of "roughage," but that they're also high in soluble fiber as well--this is why they're considered heart-healthful (that's literate-speak for "heart-healthy"). It's this fiber that's responsible for oats' "slippery" quality when they meet liquids and why colloidal oatmeal is so effective as a natural soothing agent for inflamed skin and, when cooked, rolled oats tend to be gummy. I personally don't find this off-putting and found it to be minimal in this case. But I digress.<br /><br />Quaker Oatmeal Squares are quite lovely. They're not too sweet and I found they held their crunch quite well when combined with milk (but then I tend not to linger over a bowl of dry cereal for that very reason--if I want mush, I'll cook my grains). However, I don't keep a lot of milk in the house, especially over the summer (it just doesn't taste good then), so I found myself snacking when I was in need of a nosh (my day just isn't complete without something sweet). And y'know, they really hit the spot. I felt that at least I wasn't eating total junk and was ingesting some fiber as well.<br /><br />My only complaint is the addition of white sugar and artificial colors. I'm aware that brown sugar is only marginally more healthful than white sugar but even so, why include white sugar in a brown sugar-flavored product? If you think it needs to be sweeter, just up the brown sugar (or use dehydrated cane juice or Sucanat). And why add colors? If you're targeting health-conscious customers, do so all the way--it can be used as a marketing tool ("free from artificial colors, flavors, ..."). It never fails to astonish me just how dim corporate America is, and it's especially painful where food is concerned (the irony here is that Quaker Oats really ARE a healthful product). Get with it, guys.<br /><br />All in all, if you're not a health purist and want an at least somewhat healthful cold cereal, you could do a lot worse than Quaker Oatmeal Squares, especially given their "snackability." I've reviewed several cereals for Vine; this one is undoubtedly my favorite.

review/summary: Tasty and Healthy
review/text: I'm usually a cereal man when it comes to breakfast. That is, unless of course, there's donuts or pancakes. But most of the time I try to stick with a healthy type of cereal rather than Lucky Charms or something of that nature. My two favorites are usually raisin bran or frosted mini wheats but this has worked its way into my regular rotation. They are nice and cruncy with just enough brown sugar sweetness to be tasty without overpowering your taste buds. Sometimes I mix them 50-50 with the cinnamon flavored and have a nice brown sugar & cinnamon flavor. Also, it's nice and hearty so it doesn't leave me hungry after only 30 minutes. Definitely recommended.

review/summary: better dry than with milk
review/text: Healthy Cereal!<br /><br />I love cereal though I rarely eat it as one is supposed to, generally preferring to take a small ziplock of it with me to eat dry as a snack.<br /><br />this cereal was perfect for me.  It basically tastes like teddy grams without the sugary coating.  I was able to eat baggie after baggie of this stuff.  I did try a bowl of it with milk, but it had a very strange texture (kind of slimy) which I did not enjoy, so I returned to eating it dry and was completely content.<br /><br />Because of the high fiber and healthy content of it, this will become one of those cereals that I by regularly as snack food.  But I will stick with Life cereal for adding milk to.

review/summary: Simple, Healthy, Breakfast Excellence
review/text: The ingredients are simple and healthy and the way they're put together makes for a tasty, crunchy bowl of cereal. And just you wait until these little oatmeal squares soggalate a little, that's when this Quaker breakfast excellence really shines. It's made of oats so it's "heart-healthy" evidently, but it's also free of too much sugar or trans fats, so it has my vote as a healthy cereal. It would be a staple if it was a little less expensive.

review/summary: Quaker Oatmeal Squares
review/text: Here is one of those cereals that you can eat as a breakfast meal with mile or a snack by itself. They are crunchy and yes, the brown sugar is just a hint, so it is not sweet but still tasty. Even in milk it doesn't get soggy too quickly. But I ended eating it most of it as a snack. I found it a very satisfying way to enjoy oatmeal in my diet

review/summary: Tastes Good, and Good for You
review/text: Quaker Oatmeal Squares with a Hint of Brown Sugar come out of the box quite sweet enough for me, and that's something, considering how attached I have become to that Southern favorite, sweet iced tea.  They've also got a nice crunch to them, and I've found them tasty for breakfast, or as a snack. The soluble oatmeal is a good way to help satisfy the federal dietary guidelines suggested daily whole grain consumption.  And, of course, this cereal is a useful baby step towards keeping your heart healthy.<br /><br />The Quaker product contains 46 grams of whole grain per one cup (56 grams) serving, of which there are about eleven in the box.  This is 96% of the guidelines' suggested minimum whole grain requirement per serving.  There are 210 calories per serving, 6  grams of protein per serving, 0.5% saturated fat, 2% of the daily suggested intake of that element.  190 mg of sodium, 8% of the daily suggested.  9 g of sugars; 5 g of fiber, which is 19% of the daily suggested. There is no trans fat, only 1 g each of polyunsaturated fat and monounsaturated fat per serving. As I look through the ingredients, I actually see nothing that I'm trying to avoid, no high-fructose corn syrup, etc.<br /><br />The federal guidelines say that diets rich in whole grain foods and other plant foods may help reduce the risk of heart disease.  This product offers 3 g of soluble fiber a serving, a handy keystone to a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol. Diet experts recommend eating at least three one-ounce servings of whole grains, or 48 grams, daily, based on a 2,000 calorie daily diet.  So here you have 46 grams of whole grains per serving.  Handy, right?<br /><br />So it tastes good, and it's good for you, a winning combo.  A good food to try.

review/text: This cereal wasn't as tasty or satisfying as we thought it would be.  The puffs didn't stay puffy in the milk, the 'hint of brown sugar' was completely absent and dry (w/o milk) the cereal was very flat and not very filling.<br /><br />As far as a breakfast cereal this didn't fill me with interest or make me fill full like regular oatmeal.  As a snack it was okay, it worked well for movies or when I was out walking around because it didn't make my fingers feel sticky (which is always a plus).<br /><br />I don't think I'd recommend this however.

review/summary: Great taste, addictive, snack or cereal - it's all good!
review/text: This cereal is a fave at our house. It can be a snack or a cereal. It has a nice appealing texture which does stay crispy with milk longer than flake type or other shredded grain type products. It is sweet but not sugary. We find it very satisfying. Not sure I notice any brown sugar taste - but as noted it is sweeter than plain grain cereal.<br /><br />Oats seem like a heart healthy concept - I'm not entirely sure that the processing of said oats into this cereal makes it healthy but then we alternate it with real oatmeal so it is not a daily meal for us. It does seem to go quickly as it is easy to eat a bigger bowl than the serving so we have to watch that.<br /><br />We also (contrary to the cover) do not like this with fruit unless the fruit is slightly tart. It makes it too sweet. So for those strawberries or other berries that have a more sour than sweet taste this is ideal. For fruits like banana's or sweet blueberries it was just too much sweet for us.

So how can it rightfully be called a "Crunchy Oat Cereal".<br /><br />I wonder why Quaker which is noted for Oatmeal has to be somewhat deceptive and not disclose upfront that this is not completely an Oat Cereal and then go on to make claims about Cholesterol Lowering when it is not ALL Oat Flour.<br /><br />Oatmeal is made from oats not wheat.

It holds up well in milk, even taking one's time to finish the bowl, and the taste leaves you wanting more. It's a good cereal to bag up and carry for a snack during a busy day also. It's right up there in the Top 10 or so cereals I would choose to have in a balanced selection of on-hand breakfast choices. Good enough to please any cereal-cruncher from 8 to 80.

review/text: We were excited to try these because we are always searching for a breakfast product that is kid-friendly but also healthy and low in sugar. For the most part these fit the bill. Everyone liked them, both as a dry snack and in a bowl with milk. (They take a while to get soggy---another plus.) However, what the heck is the food coloring for? They're brown!

review/summary: Just a hint....But nothing more.
review/text: A hint of brown sugar, that is. Well, I happen to like more than a hint of sweetness in my bowl of cereal, so I had to figure out how to approach this cereal. Looking at the marketing on the box, I tried to pretend I was someone who actually cared enough about their health to appreciate the lack of sweetness in their brand of cereal. When I did, this cereal immediately came across as tasty and healthy. There is a hint of brown sugar, but nothing more. Just enough to keep you from wanting to ask someone else for a packet of sugar if you were eating it at work, for example. I happen to be eating it at home, so once I tried it without sugar, I put my daily dose of sugar back in there, so I could judge the taste of the actual product both ways. I think both the health nut and the sugar-adventurous type will appreciate the taste of this cereal. My rating takes my bias in favor of sugar into account, and judges the actual product by how I would take it in my natural environment. Especially since the user can always add a sweetener later, but you can't add taste so easily.<br /><br />If you're kids are already 'trained' to eat healthy, they could theoretically munch on these as a snack-in addition to having them with milk-without complaining. If you're kids are the 'frosted flakes' type, then they may glance you a 'why are you doing this to me?' look. They'll be getting their whole grains, a good amount of protein (6g/cup)and fiber (5g/cup). If you glanced a 'this is all we have, so take it or leave it' look, then I think they'd continue to munch on it, but not without giving that 'fine...but I'm not thrilled about this, just so you know' pouty-face look.<br /><br />On the front, it says the cereal has 1 gram per serving of soluble fiber and that 3 grams of soluble fiber from oatmeal daily in a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart disease, but in the nutritional facts section, it states the product as having 2 grams of soluble fiber (with a total fiber content of 5 grams). I guess if you were looking out for that kind of thing, you might take the lowest figure of 1 gram per serving, to be safe.<br /><br />In sum, it's pretty good-tasting and healthy,too.

Maybe that's my only warning to those with dietary restrictions, those in charge of those with them, or parents with kids.<br /><br />Kudos to Quaker, though.  I say this product couldn't have been better.

review/text: My family thought Quaker Oatmeal squares were a delicious cereal.  They are lightly sweet, crunchy nuggets that don't get too soggy in milk.  They are also delicious to snack on right out of the box.  The calories are a bit high compared to many breakfast cereals (210 per serving) but I do feel like this cereal fills me up more, so it's okay.  However, I would be wary of replacing my normal bowl of oatmeal with this cereal, simply because I thought the sugar was a bit high for me.

review/summary: 20 years later, it's still a favorite
review/text: It must have been around 20 years ago when I was shopping for groceries with my mother, when one of those nice little sample carts was giving out cups of a brand new cereal.  I accepted a cup, and munched as we walked down the next aisle.  Mom asked how I liked it.  I told her that it was different, in a good way, and I really liked it.  Due to my picky tastes when it comes to cereal, she let me go back and pick up a box, and the rest is history.<br /><br />This cereal has been one of my favorites from that day on.  The taste and texture are unlike anything else on the market.  Not to sweet, doesn't get soggy quickly, and I stay full after eating it.<br /><br />The calorie count is a bit high, but thanks to the fiber/protein content, I stay full much better than many other choices.  One serving plus 1/2 cup of skim milk is about 250 calories, so I still have room in a 300 calorie breakfast for some fruit.<br /><br />I'll eat this as a snack sometimes, dry and in smaller quantity, because the crunch is satisfying and the sweet is just enough.<br /><br />The other varieties are also tasty, but the original blue box is still my favorite!

review/text: Yes, I got my box for free. I probably wouldn't have bought it. There are too many cereals I like to bother with one I might or might not like, right?<br /><br />My concerns were two-fold. First, would they be sweet enough. I don't need sugar-coated cereal, but I don't want to eat cardboard, either. And second, tight-woven cereals like this tend to suck-up all the milk, so they'll start off too dry, but end up too soggy. Could this cereal overcome those concerns?<br /><br />In a word, yes.<br /><br />The flavor was sweet. The squares started-off crunchy, but not too rough, and they did not suck-up the milk like a sponge, so they weren't too soggy at the end, either.<br /><br />I still have other cereals that I like better, but I'll likely occasionally buy this one, too.

review/text: Oatmeal Squares by Quaker is a good tasting cereal, although I personally don't think it tastes anything like Quaker oatmeal with brown sugar (I am a fan of the instant, hot cereal packs), which is what I was expecting.  The squares themselves are only tiny, about 1/2" so several fit on a spoonful at a time.  They are crunchy in milk, but the brown sugar is so subtle I didn't really notice it at first.<br /><br />I actually preferred the taste of these as a dry snack food (without milk) and then you get a better hint of brown sugar (although I still don't think they taste like oatmeal I was expecting!).  I still prefer my Quaker oatmeal as the instant, hot kind that you just tear open pack, add to a bowl, and pour hot water over.  Regardless, these Oatmeal Squares are just as filling as the hot oatmeal by Quaker, and a good way to start the morning.

I would recommend this cereal as a nice snack in the car for a kid.  (seeing how my kid just loves this stuff).  Also buying in bulk from Amazon is not a bad way to go with their subscribe and save.  Assuming you don't mind getting 4 boxes of cereal at a time, the price is generally better than the supermarket.  It's definitely worth checking out.  Plus you get 4 at a time and don't have to leave the house which is never a bad thing.

It's got 9 grams of sugar per serving, which is about three times what nutritionists recommend, but the first two ingredients are whole grain oats and whole grain wheat (sorry, not gluten-free)--sugar is third. A recent study suggested that eating a sweet treat at breakfast or early in the day seemed to stave off eating a lot more treat stuff later on. This is a fine, filling treat, with whole grains thrown in to boot.

review/summary: Very Crunchy Good Tasting Cereal
review/text: The Quaker Oatmeal Squares are great tasting in milk or right out of the box. Made with whole oat and wheat flours they are exceptionally crunchy wet or dry. Unlike other cereal squares, the Quaker Squares are more dense (higher fiber) and are ribbed and have a solid oat taste that seems only lightly sweetened. I like them in milk but routinely eat the squares dry for dessert.<br /><br />For a serving size of one cup, there are 210 calories, 2.5g of fat (.5g saturated), 190 mg of sodium, 9g of sugars (brown sugar and sugar), 5g of fiber, and 6g of protein.  Although this list may not be the best for some people, the Oatmeal Squares may be a good substitute for  the high fat and sugar cereals that children (and adults) like. I think the solid crunch of the squares that holds up in milk will appeal to children, and they will not miss the super sweet taste of their current favorites.<br /><br />The price of food world wide is increasing, so you can expect a substantial price point per 21g box. But, unlike other cereals in comparable box sizes, you can feel the higher weight of the Quaker Oatmeal Squares. The density of the cereal in milk gives you a long-lasting full feeling, and when eaten dry makes for a great dessert substitute for cookies.

review/summary: Granddaughters love the squares
review/text: We have about six dry cereals on the shelf; other options are oatmeal. When we got these, both granddaughters (ages 8 and 5) requested this cereal by name. I was impressed. We had both brown sugar and cinnamon. They preferred brown sugar but enjoyed them both.

review/summary: I was not disappointed with Quaker Oatmeal Squares!
review/text: Quaker Oatmeal Squares, Crunchy Oatmeal Cereal with a Hint of Brown Sugar<br /><br />46 grams of whole grains per serving, 210 calories, 190mg sodium, 9g sugars -- plus, "As part of a heart healthy diet, the soluble fiber in Oatmeal helps reduce cholesterol!" ... okay, into my shopping basket it goes! :)<br /><br />I was not disappointed with Quaker Oatmeal Squares, Crunchy Oatmeal Cereal with a Hint of Brown Sugar, as I have been with other cold cereals.<br /><br />*  when used with milk, the oatmeal squares are crunchy with a hint of brown sugar.  I used a packet of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I6JPQQ">Splenda</a> to help sweeten my bowl of Quaker Oatmeal Squares even though it has Hint of Brown Sugar, I like my day to start out a little bit sweeter.<br /><br />*  didn't get soggy, even though I was distracted by a couple of calls on my smartphone.  Still, the  Quaker Oatmeal Squares floated in the milk -- and, didn't get mushy.  I can't stand mushy breakfast cereal.<br /><br />*  Quaker Oatmeal Squares didn't give me that bogged down, bloated feeling.  a "plus", if ya know what I mean.<br /><br />*  Easy to handle, the product also makes for a wonderful take anywhere sort of snack, like hiking, car trips, the zoo etc... as Quaker Oatmeal Squares didn't leave my fingers feeling extraordinarily sticky.  Makes for a different kind-of-snack at a Party or get together. Just pour dry Quaker Oatmeal Squares into a bowl and let your guests decide. :)<br /><br />*  Tastes Great -- even Dad loves it -- and, He thinks you will, as well. 'nuf said<br /><br />Does this sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2012

review/summary: Awesome, pretty healthy, very tasty, not too sweet cereal
review/text: I've always loved this cereal, but it hasn't always been available in the various places I have lived.  From a texture standpoint, it's crunchy and robust, holding up well in milk without getting soggy.  But it's also not so crunchy or robust that it's unpalatable, like the straw- or raw-twine-like texture of some high fiber cereals.  It has a decent amount of fiber per serving (5 grams, which is kind of the cutoff for "healthy" cereals, in my opinion), and a pretty good slug of protein (6 grams, which is enough to make it fairly filling), and it has a good amount of whole grain oats.  And it is just perfect for my taste in terms of sweetness, having enough sugar that I don't need to add any, but not so much that I feel like I'm having dessert for breakfast.  Great stuff.

review/summary: Crunchy Oatmeal
review/text: This remains close to the top of my list for favorite cereal.  No High fructose corn syrup, low in sugar and salt, the cereal is just sweet enough.  The pieces are small and crunchy but not hard.  The cereal holds up pretty well in milk but not so well in the box ~ the last 25% of the cereal was shredded vs. squares.  This makes a fine dry snack and offers a good alternative to less flavorful, more expensive whole grain cereals that may appeal to adults but definitely not to children.

review/summary: One of my favorite cereals!
review/text: Quaker Oatmeal Squares with a Hint of Brown Sugar is definitely one of my most favorite cereals. It has a great flavor that doesn't vanish in milk. The crunch also sticks around. It is hard to find a cereal that doesn't become a total soggy mess when milk is added. My favorite way to eat this is with sliced up bananas added to the bowl. Yum! It also makes a delicious dry treat and was a great friend while dealing with morning sickness or any stomach bug for that matter. Bonus is my kids love it too!

review/text: I really liked this cereal. Like the box says, it has a hint of brown sugar, making it have just the right amount of sweetness. I don't like a really sugary cereal, they don't seem to fill me up. This is a dense cereal that holds it's crunch even when sitting in milk for a few minutes. It was hearty and filled me up for the morning. It also makes a great snack with or without milk. Additionally, I like that it doesn't have high fructose corn syrup in it. The allergy information on my box said that it contains wheat ingredients.<br /><br />Overall, this was a very tasty and filling cereal that I highly recommend.

review/text: This has a hint of brown sugar. Holds up well under milk and keeps its crunch until the last bite. Not overly sugary like some breakfast cereals. Quaker maintains its reputation in the breakfast department for wholesome goodness and nutrition without sacrificing on taste. Can't wait to try the other flavors. Highly recommend.

review/summary: Crunchy, Not Hard
review/text: Usually I eat Special K with Red Berries.  It's tasty, but it gets soggy in milk pretty fast, which I don't like much.  These Quaker Oatmeal Squares are firm but not hard.  They soften a bit, but do not get soggy by the time I finish eating them.  They are not overly sweet, despite the mention of brown sugar. They're good as an out-of-hand snack too.<br /><br />Getting down to the boring stuff, Quaker Oatmeal Squares have 210 calories per one cup serving, with 25 of the calories from fat.  This is considerably more calories than a one cup serving of Special K, but it's deceiving.  Due to the density of the product, you get a lot more actual cereal (and less air) in a cup of the Quaker Squares.  Measuring the two cereals by weight instead of volume would probably bring them much closer in calorie content.<br /><br />Although this breakfast cereal isn't my usual brand or type, I liked it a lot.  My husband, who does like his cereal to get soggy, liked it too.

review/summary: I'll eat the rest of the box, but won't buy more
review/text: I love cereal. I eat a lot of it. And, while these Oatmeal Squares are good, they won't be replacing my usual brands on my shopping list.<br /><br />The good: It's sweet enough but not too sweet. The squares are crunchy and they stayed crunchy in milk long enough for me to finish my bowl.<br /><br />The mediocre: There isn't much that is distinctive or special about this cereal. The flavor is quite bland.<br /><br />The not so good: This is marketed as a healthy cereal, but when I compared the nutritional information on the box to that on the other boxes of cereal in my cupboard, it didn't stand out on that front, either. It has about the same amount of sugar as a serving of my guilty pleasure sugary childhood favorite, not as much fiber as a serving of my grown-up favorite store brand raisin bran, and is higher in calories than either.<br /><br />With respect to whether or not I would recommend this cereal, I'm sort of neutral on that. As I said, I like it fine, I just don't love it. If you have had other Quaker brand cereals and liked them or if you like other oat-based cereals, then you might want to try this one.

review/text: If you like cereal with plenty of sugar and pretty colors, this is not the cereal for you.  Then again, if you're the sort of person who likes cereal that seems like sticks and twigs, this is also not the cereal for you.  If you're the sort of person who makes oatmeal from scratch and adds a spoonful of brown sugar, you'll love this cereal on mornings when you don't have time to boil water etc.  It is a wholesome cereal with a little bit of sugar fun going on.<br /><br />The cereal stays solid long enough to finish the bowl of cereal.  The squares are the right bite size.<br /><br />But this seems more like snack food to me than cereal.  Put it in a baggie and munch it dry on the go.  My kids were eating handfuls of it out of the box.

review/summary: Love these!
review/text: As another reviewer pointed out, these are great alone by the handful as a quick snack but also great for a morning cereal.  (or any other time you may want to eat a bowl of cereal, or course!)<br /><br />The squares are smaller than I had expected, but actually a prefect size - not too big and not too small.  They soften while sitting in milk, of course, but stay crunchy enough so that they are not all mushy by the time I get to the end of the bowl.  They also are not too sweet.  "hint of brown sugar" is a very accurate description.  You really don't need to add any sugar to these, they are great on their own and with milk.  (I actually eat them with vanilla almond milk rather than dairy).<br /><br />The fact that they have whole grains in them, 6 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber make them even more appealing to me.  One cup (serving size) of Quaker Oatmeal Squares with 1/2 cup of almond milk is just 255 calories.  this is a great way to start the day and fills me up as well.  I may try adding strawberries or bananas into the bowl for additional goodness!<br /><br />And yes, I plan to try the other flavors as well.  yum!

Granted, none of us ate this as it was marketed.  We all ate it dry and couldn't get enough.  Some of the comments included:<br /><br />1)  I don't care for a sweet cereal and this has just the right amount of brown sugar!<br />2)  Another coworker said, "I do like sweet cereal and think this is very good.  Can you get in the store yet?"<br />3)  A full cup per serving!  That's fantastic!<br />4)  These are more like a treat than a breakfast cereal.<br />5)  I can put these in a baggie in my purse for an on the go snack.  Awesome!<br /><br />We all agreed that this is something we'll look for the next time we go grocery shopping!

review/text: I tried these squares this morning, but even with the addition of more brown sugar than what was in the product, they were tasteless!  I agree that they are crunchy, but I expected much more from the product, more on the order of Kellogg's Little Bites which even kids seem to eat with relish.  I don't know what I'm going to do with the remainder of the box as I can't recommend this product, but I hate to throw food away, even when I don't like it.

review/summary: Tastes like sweetened graham crackers
review/text: I eat my cereal with soymilk and I eat it any time of the day when I need a quick meal.  I am a cereal lover.  However, I am not impressed this Quaker Oatmeal Squares Oatmeal cereal.  It doesn't have the favors of grains I expect in a cereal.  Instead, it tastes like sweetened graham crackers, which I don't care for on the first place. The only good things I can say is that the cereal stays crunchy in soymilk and its small size fits the spoon well.  The manufacturer Quaker claims that the fiber in it will lower my cholesterol, but many cereals makers make that claim these days. This cereal is not for me.

review/summary: Fulfilling, not too sweet
review/text: Healthy is the first word that comes to mind when I think of this product.<br /><br />I've always loved oat products over corn or rice. It has, I think, more fiber, and the texture is simply more fulfilling for me personally. I love the oatmeal squares because it stays crunchy longer than most other cereals, and it's not super sweet. I eat this often not only for breakfast, but mostly for snacks. It's good on its own or with a bowl of milk.<br /><br />You can add fruits and it tastes great as well. My favorite is small pieces (not slices) of strawberries.<br /><br />Overall, it's super crunchy, very filling, and has great, light flavors. Highly recommended! Much much better than the other "health" cereals that can taste really bland, and this is tasty for both kids and adults, too.

review/summary: Can stop eating it!
review/text: I love this cereal, I buy it all the time to snack on. So, when I was given the opportunity to have it vine I took it. Normally, I get into work so early, that I don't have time to eat breakfast beforehand. So, I will bring in a box of cereal and munch on it. This cereal is one of my favorites. It is a great cereal to just munch on because of the size of the cereal.<br /><br />It is very crunchy, has a touch of sweetness, and tastes real good. It is pretty addicting for me, I am continuously popping one of these in my mouth.<br /><br />I am not much of a milk and cereal type of gal, so I haven't had this cereal in a bowl with milk so I can't tell you about the consistency it has with milk or anything like that. But I can tell you as a stand alone cereal just to snack on, this is one of the best!<br /><br />I mostly go for taste then health benefits. But, one of my healthy coworkers saw me eating this one day and was very surprise at how healthy this cereal is for you and taste good too. Lets see, on the box it says 46 grams of whole grains, 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of fiber. A cup of cereal has 210 calories, 2.5g fat, 190mg sodium, 44g carbohydrates which 9g of that is sugar. I don't know much about those numbers, I just know it tastes really good :)

review/summary: Good with or without milk!
review/text: My entire family loves these! They are very crunchy and just a little sweet. My boys like them as a dry cereal snack and I like them with milk. They don't get soggy to the point of not wanting to finish the bowl. I have also tried the Honey Nut flavor and found that I prefer the Brown Sugar.<br /><br />I put them in a box of things for snacks (portioned out into the smallest zip top bags) and my boys always eat these before anything else in the box. (It includes cereals, fruits, rice cereal treats, cookies and pretzels.)<br /><br />They're packed with lots of good things, too. Whole grains, fiber, protein, iron (hard to get into my boys diets) and not a lot of sugar make this a pretty great nutritious snack or breakfast cereal. We stay full longer after eating these too.<br /><br />I'm not sure I'd pay the Amazon price though. It seems really high for cereal. Even with Subscribe and Save, it's over $5 a box and I'm pretty sure it's less than that at WalMart. Of course, if you're like me and have to drive 30 minutes to the closest grocery store, the delivery convenience may be worth it with the way gas prices are around here.

review/summary: Cold Oatmeal?
review/text: This breakfast cereal by Quaker is really good.  The cereal is squared shaped oatmeal that is prepared with milk and eaten cold.  This is a fresh twist on an old classic because when I think of Quaker oatmeal I imagine it warm, not cold.  The cereal is promoted by saying it has a hint of brown sugar and it is true.  The taste of brown sugar is very, very subtle, but there.<br /><br />This cereal also is a heart healthy product and provides more fiber than an average bowl of cereal.  Another nice perk is it doesn't become soggy as soon as the milk hits it.  This might be a good way to have kids eat a healthier breakfast cereal.  I know that I enjoyed it and would purchase it again.
