review/text: For 25 years, I lived 40 miles from Traverse City, where the vast majority of the worlds tart cherries are grown. A cherry pie made with any other kind of cherry is a poor substitute!<br /><br />I have been enjoying dried cherries for a very long time. When I was a lad, a family friend who worked for a fruit processor would bring dried cherries to church once a year, shortly after harvest. They were an amazing treat.  Then the fruit processors got more organized and dried cherries became available year round. Now they are nearly always in stock at the local Sam's Club. On rare occasion, they'll show up at a Sam's Club outside of Michigan.<br /><br />During the early years, they dried the cherries quite a bit more than they do now, about the same level of dryness as the dried cranberries, similar to a raisin. Then they figured out how to dry them less while still maintaining an adequate shelf life. What a difference! These have a chewiness more like a golden raisin but less sweet, and with that characteristic tart cherry bite. Delicious!<br /><br />I moved to Seattle in 2000. They only grow sweet cherries here. When we visit family in Michigan, we return with two boxes of these in our luggage. Every. single. time. We put them on salads, in oatmeal, GORP, and in snack baggies. We sometimes share them, and everyone likes them. Our two kids love them as much as we do. It's hard to make two boxes of them last until our next trip to Michigan. Now we don't have to.

I've also used these for baking and they always turn out wonderful. Can't say enough about these Michigan homegrown cherries.

review/text: These cherries are great. Plumper than a raisin and nice for snacking. I shared some of them with my daughter's family and they're going to order their own supply and make them a regular part of their snacking routine. Perfect when you just want a quick taste of something sweet. I've also tried the Traverse Bay cranberries which are very good too. Comparing the two, the cranberries were sweeter  and more like a raisin consistency. Both are great for baking. I have a cookie recipe that I tried with the cranberries, white chocolate chips and pecans. Best cookies I've ever made. Also tried both fruits in scones. Also very good. And as others have mentioned, good in hot cereal. I will definitely be a regular customer.

I love the Traverse Bay Dried Cranberries too, but I think I like these even more. No need to worry about freezing or airtight storage; we eat them too fast. A great product at a great price.

They are sweetened just enough, don't stick together in a lump, are just slightly juicy, have no preservatives AND taste great refrigerated!  For those who are wondering, 4# just fits in a 1-gallon zip lock bag.  On the box, it says a serving size is 1/3 cup and there are 42 servings. They were just over $27 on sale.  I will buy these again!

review/text: My entire family loved these cherries.  Some would say $28 is too much to pay for just cherries but they are worth it.  There is no chemical taste like you sometimes detect with apricots.  Of course, these cherries don't have any preservatives.  They are tart and that's a good thing in my book.  My only concern is the high sugar content but if you moderate, it's okay.  It's just hard to moderate when they are soooo good.

review/summary: Christmas cherries excellent for holiday baking!!!
review/text: We were browsing Amazon's Gold Box deals when we came across this four-pound box of treasure. Our family does a lot of holiday baking, sharing gift baskets filled with cookies, candies, and dessert bars and breads.<br /><br />These simply are outstanding cherries. They are tart and firm with a richness that we don't find in bulk foods stores. Both of our sons tried the cherries and gave us their "GG" thumbs-up review (that's "Good-Good" according to the under six-year old audience).<br /><br />We're thrilled with both the quality and the price of the Traverse Bay dried cherries. Since we're members of Amazon Prime (highly recommended!) shipping was simple.<br /><br />Of course, we're used to buying dried fruits in smaller quantities. We opened the boxy and divided all four pounds into individual sealed bags that can be stored in the refrigerator, the freezer or in a cool, dry cabinet. That was a piece of cake.<br /><br />In summary, if you are planning some holiday baking or other recipes that call for dried cherries, this is an excellent buy with a quality that will have you coming back for more.

review/summary: Worthwhile Cherries
review/text: I have found that the cherries from Traverse Bay area of Michigan are the best anywhere.  Living in Albuquerque, we cannot get such wonderful cherries locally, so I order them on-line from Amazon/Traverse Bay Dried Cherries.  They are wonderful in salads, oatmeal, and they are the best in cookies, especially oatmeal cookies with walnuts, raisins and dried cherries.  When we go to potlucks, everyone always asks for our oatmeal cookies with the cherries.  The four-pound box lasts better part of a year, and they stay very fresh in the bag in which they are delivered.  I have bought them in Michigan when I have visited there, and the price on Amazon is a good deal.

review/summary: Great value but just ok for dried cherry snob.
review/text: I guess for the price,  these are good.  My husband likes them to mix in his cereal/oats,  etc.  I have had some killer cherries before so I'm comparing these to the "others".  If you are not a dried cherry snob such as myself,  you will probably enjoy  these.  I find them to be too oily and too sweet,  with the feeling of being "over processed".  They are lacking the powerful intense cherry  flavor that I adore.  However,  those which I speak of come at a real premium.  The perfect balance of sweet and tart without the oiliness are hard to find,  and very expensive as well.<br /><br />  Still,  for the price I would give these 5 stars for what you get.  Still better than those that are available at your local chain grocer.<br />For those of you who love dried cherries but aren't snobs like me,  this is the way to go.

review/text: Since we discovered Traverse Bay  Michigan dried cherries several years ago, we have continually bought and enjoyed them.  They are not available in the area of the country where we live and we were glad to discover them on Amazon.  The tart cherries are dried and processed with a bit of oil to help prevent them from drying out.  They are excellent in everything from cereal to salads and can be used in place of dried cranberries to give foods a sweet/tart tasted.

review/text: These dried tart cherries are excellent and a real buy but only when ordered through amazon.com (rather than Traverse Bay) in the 4-pound box.  We get them to help with our arthritis, taking 10 morning and evening.  You will know within a week whether or not they will help, but most of our friends have found they help.  Of course a piece of cherry pie would have the same effect, but these are lower calorie and much more portable!  They can be substituted for Craisins in granola, muffins, cereal, and so on.

review/summary: These need refridgeration
review/text: The box says (small print) that these need refridgeration.  This is not emphasized in the description and I think that is a mistake.<br /><br />I have now received 3 boxes of these cherries.  The first 2 were excellent.  vivid cherry flavor, just excellent.  This last one, not so much.  These taste like prunes and if prunes grew this small I might be saying "waaaiitt a minute."  So why 3 stars and not 1 or zero? I think the heat got to them.<br /><br />These arrived on a hot day, say 95 degrees.  They didnt sit outside baking for any time, but it was hot and I am sure the UPS truck was not refridgerated. I had not finished the last batch so these went into the basement for a week or 10 days before I put them in the refriderator. I think this delay could have caused the problem.  Box says "refridgerate or freeze".  I didnt do this right away so I cant automatically blame the product.<br /><br />Given the excellent first 2 boxes I am going with 3 stars.  These are natural product and I like that about them.  This stuff is not pumped full of whatever chemical they can get approved by the government. My delay in getting them in the cooler means this review is on the 3 deliveries so far, not just the last one. That said, I have a recommendation. Do not order these when the temperatures are > 90 or if you dont have room to immediately store them in the refriderator.

review/summary: From USA? Yes. From Michigan? Not Necessarily - Beware!!
review/text: I think that most people who know something about the domestic cherry industry would probably expect that these cherries are from the state of Michigan. I say 'expect' because:<br /><br />- Michigan is the leading US producer of tart cherries<br />- Michigan is home to the National Cherry Festival, held in Traverse City, Michigan every summer since 1925.<br />- These cherries are sold by the 'Traverse Fruit Co.', its name referring to the town where the firm is actually located: Traverse City, Michigan.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise then, in tracking my package, when I discovered that my Traverse Fruit Co. cherries were coming to me from *Utah*. This was confirmed when I spoke to a sales person at the Traverse Fruit Co. (Cherry Central), in Traverse City, Michigan. I explained my position to her, and she told me that I raised a good point, keeping very polite and professional throughout the conversation. Kudos to the 'people skills' at Traverse Fruit Co.<br /><br />While Utah produces good tasting cherries, my expectation is that the "Traverse Fruit Company", in Traverse City, Michigan, sells fruit grown in Michigan. In fact, it often does just that. However, since their fruit comes from multiple locations, the state of origin should be made clear both at the point of sale (Amazon.com, in my case) and on the box itself. Customers should be given relevant product information, so they know who they are supporting when they purchase. "Product of USA", for this kind of item, is not enough. Just my opinion.

review/summary: Nice dried Cherry but a little bit sour
review/text: I bought two boxes of dried cherry for my Mum and myself as well. Both of us like it. However, I would like to say that it is a little bit sour, much suitable for matching with oats and walnuts as breakfast in the morning but finger or snack foods while watching TV. Recommend it!

review/summary: Tart, sweet. Perfect for oatmeal
review/text: I bought these after reading the good reviews and using the Subscribe & Save option.<br />Packaging: They arrive in a box shown in the picture. Inside that, they are in a sealed bag. Once you open the bag, they recommend keeping them frozen or refrigerated. I put most of the bag in a air tight jar that has a twist-off lid for easy access and in the fridge. There was a lot leftover in the bag so i put the remaining in a Ziploc freezer bag and placed in the freezer. It would have been nice if the cherries came in a resealable freezer bag but I understand why they didn't. There is a date on the bag also. I'm guessing this is the "best if used by" date.<br />Taste: They are not your sweet cherries. They are a little tart but also a little sweet. Just how I like them.<br /><br />Bottom line: I use these in my oatmeal, in sandwiches, in trail mix, and straight out of the container. For the price I paid (~$18) and the amount you get (4lb). It is definitely worth it. This is the 2nd 4 pound box I have bought in a year.

review/text: Bought these three times. Initially they were sweet and plump (like someone else noted). The second time, they seemed a bit more sour, but still quite delish. I just got my third box, and they are small, sour and tasteless. You can see that a lot of them are lighter red color, meaning they have been harvested before they matured. Now I have twenty-five bux worth of sour things sitting in a box. Still edible, but I am going to see if I can use them when brewing beer or cooking something. Meh.

review/text: I am VERY happy! I need to eat more fruit than I do--and I LOVE cherries! So--I was reading a lot of the reviews and, I am happy to report, the bag I received is a good one!  I was hoping that they wouldnt be dried out and hard to chew---as some raisins and other dried fruit can be!  I think that they are not overly sweet and not "oily" as I feared they would be!  I, too, had noticed that you really need to catch them when the price is low---I had kept them in my cart for quite a while and, wanting to order about a month ago was dismayed to find the price went up to almost $40 or so! So-no order then---but price came down and with "subscribe & save" got them for a very reasonable and fair price!  Going now to pack them up safely in a ziploc bag so they dont go bad---and enjoy them. I also cant wait to turn my friends on to this "almost" healthy snack!  I would have given them 5 stars if the packaging was in smaller portions---the loss of a star was NOT for the quality or taste of the product!

review/summary: Keep an eye on the price!
review/text: Traverse Bay dried cherries are absolutely fabulous. Bought them for my Dad to help with his gout: within a week or so he was out of the slipper and back in normal shoes. Big Pharma gout meds can make the gout worse while your body deals with the sharp uric crystals freed by the meds. If you want or need the meds, take them, but do try cherries also!  Any form, apparently, is helpful: fresh, dried, even the nasty red dyed ones in jars; cherry juice.  The cherries have eased my daughter's achey joints due to Lyme.<br />HOWever, do keep an eye on the price!!  They went from $23 to $28 to $43 to $20 in the space of days. I fnally shelled out the $43 cos my family were out, and I figured that the supplies were seasonally low. Plus, Amazon exhorted me to "BUY NOW! Only 6 boxes left in stock".  So I did and in less than 2 days they went from $43 to TWENTY DOLLARS. Must say I was miffed. I'd have cancelled the unshipped order but was away from 'net for a crucial day.....<br />Some folks have said the odd batch can taste oily or perhaps stale. We have yet to notice that, and we've been buying them repeatedly since Sept. In 7 boxes (including the 2 lb double bags when the box was gone for a few weeks), we've not found a bum supply.<br />Great eaten as they arrive; fantastic in cereal or yoghurt; and if you have arthritis due to age or Lyme; if you have gout; do give them a try.

review/summary: The Best Dried Cherries, Period!!
review/text: I actually live in Michigan and every year head up to Traverse City for the cherry fest. It was during a cherry fest like 6-7 years ago that I was introduced to Traverse Bay dried cherries and cranberries. I have never eaten another brand since. If you like dried fruit then look no further. Traverse Bay sells Dried Cherries, Dried Organic Cherries, Dried Organic Blueberries, Dried Wild Blueberries, Dried Red Raspberries, and Dried Strawberries. Just check out the companies homepage. They even offer subscription based shipping just like Amazon. They also sell a bunch of other stuff as well including antioxidant fruit based vitamins, Jams, fruit concentrates, etc..<br /><br />Dried cherries and dried cranberries are my favorites and I have actually tried a lot of different brands over the years. None of them have the quality, freshness and flavor that Traverse Bay has. I eat them out of the box, on cereal, in salads, and even in homemade ice cream. Dried cherries, or any other dried fruit for that matter, is a great snack.<br /><br />The bottom line - If your looking for high quality dried cherries then look no further. By the way if you love cherries and have never been to the cherry fest in Traverse City then I highly recommend you check it out. Its a great time!!<br /><br />5 Stars!

review/text: The last time I bought this item was exactly 3 months ago on April 12, 2012.  The price was $28.62, it is now $35.99.  That's a sharp increase of $7.37 in 3 months, which is a price increase of  nearly $2.00 per lb. - and when you consider that this product is 61% sugar, that's quite a price hike.<br /><br />At this price, Traverse Bay Dried Cherries costs MORE PER LB. than the Trader Joe brand of Montmorency dried Sour Cherries which are delicious and come in smaller bags.  The whole point of buying bulk 4 lbs. is that you get a price break over buying smaller bags in grocery stores.  Not anymore.<br /><br />I'm gonna go to Trader Joe instead and buy their excellent dried sour cherries which are not as oily , and have a nice tartness.<br /><br />***UPDATE - Aug. 17, 2012  I just bought from Trader Joe their Tart Montmorency Cherries 8 oz. bag for $4.29 yummy!

review/summary: Tasty but not the healthiest- LOADED with sugar
review/text: We used to eat these a lot, and I think they are delicious.  Sorry to be unfair, but I wanted to say that these things are LOADED with sugar- just look at the nutrition info: 25 grams of sugar per serving, 1/4 cup- which you could easily eat twice that much. One serving has almost as much sugar as a candy bar (usually around 30 grams), and as much sugar as an 8 oz serving of coca cola.  Imagine if you eat a double serving- that's like downing a whole bottle of mountain dew or noshing on a king-size snickers!<br />I do think cherries are great for you, they have lots of antioxidants, vitamins, and a small amount of fiber. no sulfites which is good. They are better than candy, I suppose, but sweetened so much, this isn't the healthiest snack.  Just seems like everyone is raving about how healthy these are.  I used to think that, too, but then I actually faced the music.<br /><br />craisins are the same way, actually even worse.<br /><br />So while it's better than some chemical laden, corn syrup sweetened concoction from a gas station, these are a far cry from healthy.<br /><br />why can't i find unsweetened or lightly sweetened cherries at a decent price??

review/summary: Good for the price, but just OK taste-wise
review/text: In comparison to Trader Joe's Dried Montmorency Cherries, Traverse Bay Cherries are significantly less tart. The extra sugar (4g more per serving than TJ's) lends itself to a flavor that is less fresh. For some reason, TJ's has 35%DV of Vitamin A, whereas Traverse Bay has 10%DV.. could be an error in measurement, but it seems a rather large gap for that.<br /><br />Biting into a dried cherry from the better brand, you would instantly be aware: It's cherry, dried, but nonetheless juicy with an exquisite flavor. While Traverse Bay cherries have a nice texture (comparable to TJ's), they just don't taste as fresh-- They aren't bursting with cherry flavor. It's fine for the price, but when I need them for a recipe in which the cherries will really stand out, or when I want to eat straight from the bag, I'll be reaching for TJ's in the future. For my morning cereal, where the dried cherries get cooked into the oatmeal, Traverse Bay will do just fine.<br /><br />Traverse Bay: $18.44 with Subscribe and Save, on occasion/4 lbs<br />TJ's: 3.69 for 8 oz. package--> $29.52/4 lbs<br /><br />Again, I can't say I was disappointed with these. It's not as if they taste awful; I just don't want to eat them in the same way I want to eat other brands of dried cherries. But for the price (and given others' rave reviews), it couldn't hurt to try them.

review/text: Folks, I'm not exaggerating -- these cherries are wonderful.  I'd never had dried cherries before that I know of, at least none with a slightly tart (not sour) and sweet flavor.  The texture of the cherries ... again, I am astonished at how good these are.  I'm trying something that seems to be working out well, too -- I have been "blooming" the cherries by heating up some water on the stove, and then placing a handful of cherries in a coffee cup and then putting the hot water in there with them.  Cover it, and let them rehydrate for a couple of hours.  The cherries puff back up a little -- not like they were before drying, but it makes them a lot more like, say, canned cherries (except clearly, with no preservatives or syrup), that you can chill and put on your cereal or ice cream ...<br /><br />These are great, and I eat them by the handful!!!<br /><br />-- Setherson

review/summary: Vegan Natural Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Natural. Kosher. Wonderful dried cherries. Perfect for baking. (My favorite is to add them to vegan chocolate cupcakes, just add to the recipe & mix before baking.) Also great for snacking and blending in smoothies. Great cherry flavor goodness, not overly tart. Comes packed in one large inner bag, which fits in a gallon (3.8l) ziplock storage bag. Or you can repack in smaller quantities after opening. The Traverse Bay area in Michigan and Door County, Wisconsin are famous for their cherry orchards. Definitely recommend a visit during harvest time, if you ever have the chance. Just received my second 4lb [1.8kg] box. Freshness dated to May 2012. Can be stored in the refrigerator or freezer to keep fresh even longer [but if you really like cherries, especially at a grower bulk pack price, this is not an issue.] Made with cherries, sugar, and a small amount of sunflower oil to prevent clumping. No added preservatives or sulphites. All natural. This review is out there for those for whom it makes a difference. See all of my reviews and the vegancompassion Profile for more great choices.

review/summary: VERY SWEET
review/text: Maybe it's my fault for not reading the description well enough, but they are really sweet.  Without a sweet tooth, these were hard for me to eat.  Plus, I didn't think to check if they were organic, which is a must for me and fruit.  However, it's a large amount and goes a long way for the price.  Next time I'd order unsweetened organic tart cherries (for inflammation) from another source.

review/summary: Well, so far so good - first order very good
review/text: This was my first time ordering these cherries.<br />My husband has gout, so I thought this might be a good snack to help him ward off attacks.<br />(Cherries are known gout helpers.)<br /><br />I wasn't thrilled with the price, but when it got down to a more reasonable cost (under $25), I<br />ordered one to try.  I was not sure I really wanted to, with all the mixed reviews of some orders<br />being moist and great and some being nasty and dry.<br /><br />The box we got arrived quickly and in good shape.<br />I'll post photos later, but wanted to get the review going.<br />I must say that I had a much bigger box in the picture in my head.<br />Yes, you get this box, but it is SMALL! I know they list the weight, but it was a little<br />hard for me to visualize four lbs of dried cherries. I'm probably not the only one.<br /><br />Upon opening the box, all the cherries are in one sealed blue bag.  I guess the blue<br />color helps with keeping the condition of the fruit from deteriorating.<br />I cut it open very carefully, and decided to bag them up in snack-size zipper bags.<br />(I was originally going to use our vacuum sealer to make smaller bags, but the quantity<br />was less than I had visualized. Zip top snack size worked great. I used a spoon to fill them<br />to not touch any of the other cherries.<br /><br />Then came the big mistake - I ate a pinch of them.<br />I say mistake, because my husband is going to have to be quick to get some!<br />These were a little more tart than I thought they'd be, but they are delicious.<br />The bag we got had reasonable-sized cherries, around a fat raisin size. They were<br />very moist. As I let some sit in my mouth, they seemed to plump even more. Upon<br />chewing, they released a wonderful flavor that made my mouth water a little bit.<br /><br />I can see using these in muffins and cookies, in your cereal, snack mixes and just eating.<br />So far, I've had more of the cherries than my husband. (Hey, you snooze, you lose!)<br />They are wonderful.<br /><br />Not sure a second order would be the same quality though. I am a bit concerned with all the mixed<br />reviews about getting a consistent quality for the second order. They are too expensive to have<br />something dry and tasteless arrive at the door.<br /><br />All in all, happy with this purchase.

review/summary: Used to be great, now awful!
review/text: I've ordered about 2 boxes a month of these cherries over the past few years and up until the last shipment (a few weeks ago), they have been excellent. Now, the latest shipments have lacked the quality that they once had. They are now smaller and the taste has changed for the worse. As I eat the dried cherries as a standalone snack, the taste is extremely important! It's very unfortunate that Traverse Bay has changed this and I will no longer be ordering them if this wasn't just a one time difference!

review/summary: Why would they put vegetable oil in cherries?
review/text: My biggest beef with this product is that they took one of my favorite and one of the healthiests fruits, and ruined it with processed vegetable oil. Was there really a need for that?<br />The price is definitely great for that big of a box of cherries, but I will simply not buy it because I don't want to be consuming anything with vegetable oil in it.<br />Plus, it kind of defeats the purpose of even buying dry cherries. Isn't it suppose to be a way to preserve product for a long time vs. buying fresh? So why mix it with another product that easily goes rancid with a change in temperature or time?

review/summary: NOT even close to the same cherries I ordered last year
review/text: My review of Traverse Bay Fruit Co's dried cherries is going to be almost identical to Robert J. Kiep's, which was written on 7/17/12.<br /><br />The cherries I ordered last year were plump, sweet, and delicious.  They came out of the package looking and tasting *perfect*, and remained perfectly wonderful to the very last one.  Last week I placed a new order for the cherries and what I got was something that might as well have been little bits of dried cardboard.  So I thought, "Hmm, maybe I got a bad batch, let's call for a replacement."  Amazon, as always, was great about sending a replacement right away.  But guess what?  I got the same tasteless, nearly colorless dried bits of cardboard again, which leads me to believe that Traverse Bay is doing something vastly different with their cherries now - or obtaining them from an altogether different source.<br /><br />Don't even consider purchasing these for the asking price.  It would be highway robbery.  I wouldn't spend $5 on the two boxes I received in the mail this week.  I think I will try Costco's dried cherries as I've read good things about them.  Bummer about Traverse Bay.  I'm disappointed.  I love to bake with dried cherries, and to snack on them, too.  On a positive note, the Amazon rep was kind enough to immediately refund my money, and to let me know that he'd look into the matter so that others here are not disappointed in a similar fashion.

review/summary: Off Taste
review/text: I purchased this product because I got tired of buying the 6 ounce packages of Sunkist dried cherries.  I am somewhat disappointed in this product because the sunflower oil used to prevent sticking during storage gives an initial off taste.  Luckily this initial off taste disappears soon after sucking the cherries and then they have a very good flavor.  I consume a lot of dried cherries and I will not purchase this product again.  Sunkist dried cherries don't have this initial off taste (even though they also contains sunflower oil).  It turns out that the cost per pound is not much different when shipping and handling is considered.

review/summary: These are sour cherries - the best although they've been sweetened
review/text: These sour cherries are great by themselves or in oats or yogurt.  Actually, I think they're just a little bit too sweet due to the addition of sugar, but I can't readily find dried cherries that aren't sweetened. It's not necessary to add so much sugar (and oil) because they taste naturally sweet.<br /><br />Cherries have great nutritional value too. In particular, the red pigment in cherries is an anthocyanin that a lot of researchers think reduces inflammation.  There are two main types of cherries - sweet and sour.  I like the sour ones best and these are sour.

review/text: I have been buying these for the past few years when I catch them on sale.  Retail prices on dried cherries are just outrageous so these are a great deal with Subscribe and Save.<br /><br />They are sweet but not cloyingly sweet like a few brands that I have tried. I have one box that stayed sealed in the box for a few months and when I opened it they were still nice and soft and not dried out and chewy as well.<br /><br />These are great in baked goods and my kids love it when I put these in our morning oatmeal or when making cookies to add in a change of pace from Oatmeal Raisin cookies.<br /><br />Overall its a great deal for the price and they keep fresh for a long time as well which is an added plus.

They taste like cherry pie, yet they are unsweetened. They are simply naturally sweet.<br /><br />I enjoy eating this delicious treat either alone or with my daily serving of dark chocolate (my favorite brand is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PAQ6A8">Ritter Sport</a>).<br /><br />For those counting calories: Each dried cherry is 5 calories, compared to 2 calories per raisin and 20 calories per dried apricot or prune.

You can check Wikopedia for other information.<br /><br />Well....now to the cherries.  The cherries taste great.  They were all loose and not stuck together making them easy to repackage into smaller bags.  I have tried dried cherries from the grocery store and other sources but they are not as good.  I think one factor may be that you are getting fresh product from Traverse Bay Fruit Co which is located in the cherry growing region of Michigan. I plan to order more when these run out.

review/text: Being a native Michiganer I have a love for all things Michigan. I was a bit concerned in purchasing these dried Cherries thinking they wouldn't be as fresh as what I can get in state. Boy was I wrong. They were delivered as fresh as if I were to drive up to Traverse City myself. Overall these things are great!!!<br /><br />4 pounds of cherries is a TON! So what we've done is split the package into four freezer bags. Freezing 3 of the 4. The bags defrost really well they just have to be kept in the fridge. I would have really liked to see the cherries be split into smaller packages within the big box.... but ah well. Overall I'm really happy!

review/summary: Delicious, Preservative-Free and Grown in the USA
review/text: These dried cherries are grown in the USA and are delicious to eat plain or to use as a topping on cereal or as part of a trail mix.<br /><br />Another plus--they don't have any preservatives or sulfites added.<br /><br />There are two reasons that I gave these cherries four stars instead of five.<br /><br />1.  They have a lot of sugar added, and they are a little on the sweet side for my taste.  I prefer to limit my sugar intake and add sugar to food sparingly, but that's not an option with these cherries.<br /><br />2.  These cherries, all four pounds of them, are packaged in a single plastic bag which is not resealable.  I would have preferred them to ship in several separate bags, or at least a big resealable bag in order to make storing them more convenient.<br /><br />I ended up repackaging the cherries into several heavy-duty Ziploc bags to store them.

review/text: I agree with R.D..... it is hard to stop eating them!  The price does seem to be going up and down. Amazon suspended my subscription when the price doubled... then the subscription became available again at a reasonable cost, currently  half the price of the one-up order.  I will continue to order them when I can afford them and allow the subscription to be suspended when I cannot.

review/summary: yummy!
review/text: These dried cherries rock! They are delicious and are not too sweet or too tart - perfect. They go great with cereal, in oatmeal, or snacking right out of the box. The 4 lb box lasted ~3 months. I highly recommend for the price and quality.

review/summary: Very pleased with the order.
review/text: What can be said about a food product?<br /><br />The color of the cherries are uniform and a nice color. The taste is not too sweet and not too tart. It is really the perfect balance. I've used these by putting a handful in my morning oatmeal and also alone for a snack.<br /><br />If any one you make home ice cream this would be a great addition to vanilla ice cream. Or even added to a pie.<br /><br />The only thing I would change about this product is the internal packaging. It would be nice if the bags was resealable.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H7LVKY">Traverse Bay Fruit Co. Dried Cherries, 4-Pound Box</a>

review/summary: Fantastic cherries
review/text: These cherries taste amazing.  When the box arrived it was nearly impossible to keep people away from just eating them straight from the bag.  If I had to make one complaint, I would say that they are a little sweet for my personal taste.  That said, they still terrific.  Far surpasses anything I have been buying locally.

review/summary: Love these Cherries...and so do my family, friends,& neighbors.
review/text: The cherries are great.  I always think I have too many and give a bunch away to my friends, family, neighbors and co-workers.  Everybody is very pleased to have them and I'm kind of a hero.  :-)<br /><br />Anyway, they are sweet, tart, chewy without being sticky.  I use them in oatmeal, salad, cookies, bread and for snacking.

review/summary: Consistently nice
review/text: I went through a four pound bag of these without getting tired of them.  The quality was very nice with no bad ones in the batch.  The flavor is consistently zesty and the texture is just like raisens.<br /><br />I will take a break for about a month, then buy more because they are low fat and healthy.
