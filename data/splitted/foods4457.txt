review/summary: Great innovative product
review/text: I had heard about this product in a class I had attended and found it at one local grocery store.  I checked Amazon and found the 1 lb bag at a much better price than the grocery store jar.  We use it when we travel and at home.  You honestly cannot tell the difference in it and a jar of processed peanut butter. You mix it fresh, when you need it and have none of the added sugars, salt and whatever else the manufacturers might add.  Far less fat, too.  It is a wonderful product.  I just ordered my second bag of PB2!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004P4POZ8">Powdered Peanut Butter - 85% Less Fat and Calories - 16 Oz</a>

review/summary: Wow!  Glad I ordered the pound bag
review/text: As much as I love all things peanut, the grand goober is taboo while I'm counting calories.  Looking for peanut flavoring or extract, I was shocked to find PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter, a product I'd never imagined.  Based on the glowing reviews,  I opted for the large size, which proved to be the right choice.  This stuff is FABULOUS.<br /><br />It's a very fine, dry powder with such an intense peanut flavor that very little goes a long way.  A 2-tablespoon (12 gram) serving has only 45 calories and 1.5 grams of fat, but reconstituted with 2 tablespoons of sugar-free grape jam (instead of water), that's enough to coat 2 slices of toast for a sinlessly delicious PB & J.  I've also used it successfully to make no-guilt Chinese cold peanut noodle, peanut sauce for chicken, and substituted PB2 everywhere I'd used peanut butter or peanuts in the past.  Low calorie, low fat, scrumptious and versatile -- what a concept.

review/summary: Amazing Little Powder
review/text: I purchased PB2 after finding a recipe for a Butterfinger Smoothie.  I had heard about the smoothie from a friend who is a personal trainer.  I made the recipe immediately when I received the PB2 powder.  It was wonderful!  It really tasted like a Butterfinger.  For anyone trying to increase her protein intake and avoid adding fat, this is the perfect product.  There are tons of recipes on the web for smoothies using this product.  I also used it mixed with a tiny bit of water as a dip for apples as a much lower fat alternative to apples and peanut butter.  I just placed another order for the PB2 combo pack with original and the chocolate flavor.  My next order will be the 6 or 12 pack.

review/summary: Not Peanut Butter, Peanut Flavored Peanut Butter
review/text: I ordered this at the asking of my wife because she is dieting. I was against it from the start, but I will make my review fair.<br />The product is not peanut butter, if you expect peanut butter than you will be disappointed. It tastes like peanut butter. If I could compare it to something it is like eating a regular Oreo and a reduced fat Oreo. The reduced Oreo tastes like and Oreo, but really just leaves you wanting the real thing. This product is no different. If you mask it will jelly and bread, the off taste becomes less noticeable, but there in lies the problem. You have to add more calories back in to make this product taste better. There by negating the fact that you have cut calories. As I explained to my wife after we both decided this product was not for us. The problem with any peanut butter food is normally everything but the peanut butter. The fat is the healthiest part. You wouldn't eat omega free fish because it's lower in fat, why would you do the same to peanut butter?<br />The only way I could recommend this is if you are doing a starvation sort of diet (i.e. you eating this with celery and water). If you are doing a healthy diet don't cut out the peanut butter of your PB&J, cut out the jelly first and then the grain. I eat again "regular" non-hydrogenated peanut butter will celery, now there is a healthy food.<br /><br />Pros<br />+lower calorie<br />+great price here on amazon<br />+does taste similar to peanut butter<br /><br />Cons<br />-less nutritional value<br />-doesn't taste like real peanut butter<br /><br />I will give it four stars if you are doing a starvation sort of diet, which I don't recommend, but it does taste alright for a lot less calories. For everyone else I give it one star as you should not be eating products like this and the product itself is not that good. Overall 2 stars, weighted towards everyone else.

review/summary: Did someone say AMAZING
review/text: I sure thought having to mix powder with water sounded weird, but I thought it was worth a shot after reading the reviews (and after Walden Farms' peanut spread proved yucky, lol), but it's great! The taste and texture is just like peanut butter--I could kiss whoever came up with this, LOL.<br /><br />I don't like to waste food, so I have been mixing it with my Walden Farms' spread, which makes it that much less calorie, and it actually tastes good mixed together. Although I like the mixture of the two, PB2 is good enough and low cal enough on its own that I would recommend it to any peanut butter lover that wants to watch their caloric intake (like me!). I will definitely be purchasing it again.

review/summary: Very pleasantly surprised
review/text: I bought both the regular and chocolate versions.  I was expecting it to be barely tolerable and I would use it only in baking. Boy, was I wrong.  I mixed each with water and it tasted amazing.  I added a half a pack of Equal to the 2 tablespoons of peanut butter and it was even better.<br /><br />I had given up peanut butter because it was just too many Weight Watchers points and now I can have it again.  This is just about perfect and I was a total skeptic.<br /><br />Another surprise was that it wasn't as costly as I thought.  My $8 jar of Jif has 35 servings and this $10 bag of PB2 has 37 servings. For a mere 20% increase, I'm thrilled to buy this.

review/summary: Feeding my sweet-tooth AND shrinking my waistline!
review/text: I'm not worried about my fat intake at all, but I love peanut butter and would easily eat 400 peanut butter calories daily. I'll eat a spoonful by itself, put a couple in a smoothie... With the same amount of PB2, I'm eating 90 calories. That means I can dip apple slices & dark chocolate, eat spoonfuls, and still put some powder in my smoothie without gaining 2 pounds a month.<br /><br />I bought one bag of chocolate and one of regular and mixed them together (thinking if it was nasty, the chocolate would help it taste better). It actually tastes really good! I tried them separately and they were both good, but I prefer them mixed. My boyfriend says he can't tell that it's not regular peanut butter (I can tell) and that he prefers the powder to real peanut butter in shakes and smoothies. (I make fake ice-cream all the time by blending ice, almond milk, banana, and pb2).<br /><br />Honestly, the powder doesn't taste the same. However, it is close enough to make me keep eating it instead of the real peanut butter in the cupboard. I like that I can make it as creamy or as thick as I want.<br /><br />I took a chance buying the larger bags because it's cheaper by weight, and I am not at all disappointed. PB2 is well worth the money and I will be buying it regularly.

When I feel hungry  I  apply one or more  tbs. of water to 1 tbs of this peanut powder, may be too much water though. Then the mixture becomes viscous and appears a very pleasing texture! I use it to dip my bread, and I really love it!

review/summary: Love this stuff!
review/text: This product is a dream come true and I haven't even used it in recipes yet.  I love mixing up a small bowl to go, and eating it with sliced apples as a snack.  It's great on rice cakes with sliced bananas too.  The texture (without all the peanut fat) is obviously not as heavy/oily as peanut butter, so picky kids used to regular peanut butter might not like it.  I find it very satisfying and remnicent enough of peanut butter that it's a treat without the thought of packing on calories and fat as with regular peanut butter.  I also love it in smoothies, which usually require a ton of peanut butter to even perceive the taste of peanut, but not with this... A few teaspoons and a frozen banana with almond milk and you've got a smoothie to die for without the guilt.  I'm definately reordering this product.  I liked the PB2 Chocolate as well, but it's not as versatile as the PB2.  I only tend to use the chocolate one in smoothies, whereas the plain PB2 can be used and just add a little cocoa when you want it.  I also love how easy this stuff is to take when traveling...  Again, LOVE this product.

review/summary: Yum! And less fat and calories!
review/text: Love it!<br />Is it the same as good ole fashioned peanut butter? Ok, probably not. But it's VERY CLOSE! If you can handle all the fat and calories from the real stuff, go ahead and stick with it. However, if you LOVE peanut butter, but find you are needing to cut back, PB2 is the way to go!<br />It's a little pricey. I think there are places to get it cheaper, but I went with Amazon since I was ordering other items and getting free shipping.<br />Mixing it with water and reconstituting it works fine, although a little grainy. And many have already commented that it doesn't amount to much, making it hard to SLATHER on stuff. Since I'm not making peanut butter sandwiches with this stuff, it's not a big deal to me.<br />It's not as sweet as many PB's, it's definitely more like a natural peanut butter in flavor. Personally, I love it for mixing it into my greek yogurt. YUM! A little extra protein and it tastes like a creamy peanut butter mousse. I love it!<br />I haven't tried mixing it in oatmeal yet, but that's next! I started mixing the regular stuff into my oatmeal every morning last summer, but realized I was taking in too many calories and fat along with my regular diet. Soooo, ready to try this option!<br />Great for smoothies or protein shakes too!

review/summary: Does so much more than regular PB.
review/text: I first bought PB2 after reading it online, and paid 10 bucks for the 6.5 oz jar at a specialty food store.  I was hesitant, having had less than stellar luck with low-calorie peanut butter products (Walden farms, better n' peanut butter, etc).  I also am adverse to products whose ingredients I don't recognize.  But this one really, really delivers.  It has the same taste as regular peanut butter with a slightly fluffier texture. Ingredients: Roasted peanuts, sugar, and salt.  That's it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />GREAT taste<br />Very low-calorie<br />16-oz package is a waaaaay better deal than elsewhere<br />Much more versatile than regular creamy PB<br /><br />Cons:<br />Needs to be mixed with water, which means another bowl to wash<br />Can't eat it out of a jar with a spoon (which, if you're dieting, might also be a pro!) :]<br /><br />Ways I use it:<br />Sandwiches (of course)<br />In cookies, cakes, brownies, and other places where the consistency of PB is tricky<br />With my whey protein shakes in the morning (chocolate whey powder or cocoa powder, PB2, almond or regular milk, ice, makes a reeses cup milkshake!)<br /><br />I shop on amazon almost daily and never review products, but I really, really love this one.  Very highly recommended.

review/text: I bought a small container of this product (PB2) to try it.  Not only do I love it, but so does my family, including our teens.  Our family follows the Weight Watchers program and this is a wonderful way to have peanut butter without all the points.  Just ordered a one-pound package of both the PB2 and the PB2 with chocolate.  We make smoothies with the PB2 chocolate using frozen bananas, ice, skim milk and PB2 chocolate.  Delicious!!!  Tip for sandwiches - with the PB2 we mix 6 tablespoons of powder with 3 tablespoons of water (3 points).  When using it in the kids sandwiches, I add one teaspoon of regular peanut butter.  Makes 2-3 healthy, tasteful peanut butter sandwiches.

Says it tastes just like peanut butter (and that was coming from when she just ate it off a spoon and only mixed with water).  I like it also, but I still think all natural peanut butter tastes better, but this is great for smoothies because the "peanut butter" doesn't stick to the blades making a very messy clean up and it gives the perfect amount of peanut taste.  I will definitely repurchase after using it all up.

review/text: This is a good product IF you like sugar and salt in your peanut butter.  I like plain old peanut flavor in my peanut butter, so I have a choice to make:  either the oil from Smuckers or the sugar and salt from PB2.  I'm not sure which I'll choose long term.<br /><br />UPDATE:  PB2 is my first choice all the time now.  Not having the oil is worth the little sweetness that is present in the PB2, and the salt tastes about the same as the salt in the Smuckers Natural.  It's very convenient to mix as needed, and it really is just as good as regular peanut butter.  And one serving is only one Weight Watcher point.  3/15/3012

review/summary: Great on a cut...value not so much
review/text: To get this out of the way: No, this does not taste exactly like peanut butter. It is close, especially near the end where the roasted peanut taste really comes through, but unless you are strictly buying off-brand surplus peanut butter, this won't fool anyone in a blind taste test. Then again, it has a quarter of the calories of regular while maintaining a (pretty good!) semblance of the taste and texture. Note, however, that this isn't the greatest bang for your buck. While this and the smaller, peanut-butter jar size seem like they would last a while, it tends to go fast as you need to mix two tablespoons of what is a relatively loosely-packed powder with a tablespoon of water. Despite that, it is diet-friendly, a decent amount of protein, and a staple of my cutting diet. Definitely get this if you aren't pauper-poor.

review/text: LOVED this except for the added sugar.  People who order this are likely doing so to control fat or caloric intake, so why undermine their efforts?  If a sugar-free version, I'll order it again. Until then, I'm better off with the no-added-sugar varieties (as cutting out simple carbs has worked wonders for me for 10 years now).  A plus:  These make fabulous peanut butter cookies.

No where on the Bell Plantation web site did it say it had sugar and a lot of it at that.  I eat plain peanut butter, because my body does not like cane sugar.  So I think I'll be making muffins or something so that there will be enough protein to balance the sugar.<br />I have eaten the PB2 with carob powder blended in ... now that has got to tell you that this stuff is really sweet.  bottom line ... I am a wee bit bummed out with the sugar.  Never would have purchased it, had I known.

review/summary: PB2 - Peanut Butter with All The Work
review/text: PB2 is a great idea, and a much healthier option for PB lovers; however, when I want PB, I want PB, and messing with the PB2 is not something done quickly unless you are just making PB2 with water. Excellent mixed with honey, preserves, etc., but it takes more of those things that are not water to make the PB, and is there really a point of mixing PB2 with something other than water if you are looking for the health benefit?<br /><br />As a huge fan of crunchy PB, and having eaten only natural PB for years, I already receive the benefit of not eating hydrogenated oil (we all have to have some fat), so I'm not gaining the same benefits from the PB2 that I would if I were moving from Jiff or Skippy to this almost no-fat product.

review/summary: Great for making regular peanut butter less oily!
review/text: I bought this powdered peanut butter to "fix" the consistency of my favorite natural peanut butter by Sunland. Natural peanut butter tends to be very oily, and I hate anything with an oily or greasy consistency but I am always trying to find ways to increase my intake of healthy fats, which keeps me lean and totally ripped (I am the same size 2 in my 40's as I was in my 20's thanks in part to my PB&J addiction!) Mixing PB2 in with regular peanut butter gives it a perfect drier and firmer consistency that is so much more palatable. My daily peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are absolutely delicious now with no gross oily mouth feel! I love the fact that PB2 is also all natural. Great product!

review/summary: Tastes pretty darn close to real peanut butter ...
review/text: I travel a lot for business and I can never find decent peanut butter anywhere outside of the US. I toyed with the idea of bringing a small jar of peanut butter but it was heavy and there's always the probability of leakage. I was looking around Amazon one day and saw this. It got really good reviews so I tried it.  My fellow reviewers were absolutely right ... for dehydrated peanut butter, this tasted almost like the real thing. Now I'm not comparing it to Skippy of Jiffy because those peanut butters have a lot of salt and sugar in them. I buy the all natural peanut butter (no sugar or salt added) and when hydrated, this PB2 was almost as tasty as the hydrated all-natural version.<br /><br />It has instructions for the water to power ratio but I like to just mix to my preference. If I feel like a little creamier / smoother, then I add more water and vice versa. Obviously, it's more pricey than the peanut butter you would find at Costco or the supermarket but in addition to being light in weight, it's also 85% less fat than regular peanut butter.  I'm planning on packing several ziplocs of this yummy powder with my on my trips so I can have it on my bread for breakfast. The hotels always have jams and jellies but they never offer peanut butter. Now, I'm packing my own and loving it.

review/summary: Great tasting low fat peanut butter
review/text: PB2 is a staple in my kitchen. I also keep a container at work to make quick and easy snacks. It's a powdered peanut butter - peanuts with most of the fat removed, plus small amounts of sugar and salt for flavor. The amount of sugar per 2 tablespoon serving is only 1 gram (equivalent to 1/4 of a teaspoon). I'm a dietitian and recommend this to my patients who need to follow low fat diets but don't want to give up peanut butter. My favorite way to eat this is with apple slices, although I've had patients tell me they like to dip their fresh fruit directly into the powder. Amazon seems to have the best prices for this item.

I recently discovered this product and decided to give it a shot in hopes that I could shave a few calories off of my oatmeal and this product didn't disappoint! I admit it lacks the creaminess you get from real peanut butter but all the flavor is there at a fraction of the calories and fat! My morning oatmeal which used to be approx. 370 calories is now down to around 240 thanks to PB2! I haven't tried using it in anything else just yet but this one change in my diet has made the product worth it to me!

review/summary: Low in fat but it was good fat
review/text: PB2 is low in fat and calories (2 tablespoons of PB powder = 45 calories, 1.5 grams of fat).<br /><br />It's fabulous in my banana & PB smoothie (banana, milk, honey, PB2).  It tastes soooooo good, and because it's low in fat and calories, I can have this as a snack without feeling too bad.  I also mix this with chocolate soy milk for a quick drink.<br /><br />I don't like it as much in a sandwich, but it satiates that craving.  It was a great thing to try, but I probably wouldn't purchase this again only because something about removing healthy fats kinda gives me pause for thought.<br /><br />As a not-so-healthy option, it works great in flavoring buttercream frosting and dusting truffles for extra peanut flavor.  :)

review/text: This was the best idea ever.  I have a SERIOUS peanut butter addition.  I thought I was just going to have to stop buying it because it was getting so out of hand.  I usually mix regular PB with Greek yogurt (the unflavored kind...it has the lowest amount of sugar) to try to lower the fat/calorie content, but I wont be doing that anymore.  This tastes just as good, if not better.  I also found that if I used yogurt instead of water, that a little bit less PB2 needs to be used.  I typically mix a little water in there, too.  For a treat, I would also put just a lil' bit of PB2 in with some Greek yogurt and maybe a bit of SF jelly and some cereal!

review/summary: Not quite peanut butter, but a reasonable substitute
review/text: I've been on a diet and exercise program and was eating peanut butter as a snack and it started to get out of hand and I couldn't lose any weight. Well with roughly 200 calories in 2T of peanut butter, it is easy to figure out why. My trainer told me about PB2 so I got some to try and I do like it. It is NOT peanut butter, it lacks the creamy smooth taste. I guess if I had to explain what it tastes like, I would say peanut butter cookie dough - basically imagine what peanut butter would taste like mixed with flour. But given that I can eat it for 1/4 of the calories, it is a reasonable substitute when I crave peanut butter.<br /><br />As I recall, the instructions call for 2T of powder and 1T of water. I found that wasn't enough water to mix it up properly and had to put in a little extra. Over time I've found 1T of water is needed for every 1T of powder (equal parts), and that provides a creamier texture.<br /><br />If I've got a few extra calories to burn for the day, I will sometimes mix 3T of PB2, 3T of water, and 1T of real peanut butter.<br /><br />So PB2 is a great product and it is helping me meet my diet goals, but I wish it tasted more like real peanut butter. I haven't tried it in smoothies or anything like that (because I don't drink them), but I can see how that could be good if you enjoy them. I've ordered some of the chocolate flavored and I look forward to trying it.

review/summary: Peanut butter for the chubby set
review/text: Does it taste like a full fat peanut butter? No. Is the consistency the same as a full fat peanut butter? No.  Does it taste good and act as a good substitute? Yes!  I've made PBJs with this and it is not quite the same (but good), PB and honey--I don't advise it, Thai peanut sauce--excellent..  The best use of this product is in smoothies with bananas, blueberries, protein powder, and coco.  I've ordered this product twice and will continue to do so but it is by no means Jiffy in a powdered form.

review/text: Where has PB2 been all my life?  I will never go back to using the oily stuff again.  With PB2 I don't need to worry about using the product quickly before it turns rancid.  I can measure my portions much more easily.  PB2 is so much easier to take with me for lunch or snacks.  PB2 is only 45 calories compared it the oily stuff's 220 calories.  PB2 is great for adding into smoothies, yogurt, curries, soups, and just about anything you can think of whilst in the kitchen.  The best reason for eating PB2-it tastes GREAT!

review/text: I am a huge fan of PB2 and have been for years.  PB2 isn't a perfect replacement for peanut butter, but it has a natural taste to it, is MUCH lower in fat and calories and is very versatile.  I was pleased to see that they are now offering larger packages of this product.<br /><br />When turning PB2 into peanut butter, don't add too much water, or the consistency will be funny and the taste gets a little diluted.  In addition to using this as a peanut butter spread, I also put PB2 powder in smoothies, on cereal and with oatmeal.

review/summary: Much Healthier, Yummy REAL Peanut Butter! Amazing!
review/text: I have difficulty controlling portion size when I eat peanut butter, which wrecks my diet, and is preventing me from losing the last 20 lbs. I need to lose. After trying the revolting Walden Farms 0 Calorie Peanut Spread, several Amazon users recommended this product. PB 2 is real peanut butter in powdered form. It's had most of the fat extracted from the peanuts. It contains just three ingredients: peanuts, salt, and sugar. It's more natural than many regular PB brands. Each 2 tbsp. serving contains 45 calories and just 1.5 g of fat (compared to 190 or 200 calories and 16 g of fat in regular PB). You mix one to two tbsp of water per two tbsp of PB2. This is one of the few diet foods that tastes the same as the regular stuff, instead of being an inferior chemical tasting imitation of the original. I mix it with sugar free syrup and spread it on an apple for a 115 calorie dessert that tastes awesome!

review/summary: For those who truly care about a healthy lifestyle with good taste
review/text: I first tried PB2 in D'Lites located on Cedar Rd. in Chesapeake. The owner raved about it and offered me a sample. I was sold at first bite! I loved the clean taste without all the sugar and additives. I bought a jar and as I continued to eat it on our Daniel Fast, I just had to go on line to order more. I offered some to my 14 yr. old granddaughter and  she is sold on it too. She also thinks it tastes better than regular peanut butter.  I can have 3 TBS, get the same amount of protein with less than 68 calories. I have mixed it in oatmeal & I have added part water and part total fruit spread for a sandwich. You get all the fun with none of the guilt and it has so much nutrition! Eating this is saying goodbye to empty calories and being able to carry it with me is a great benefit. If you really care about living a healthier lifestyle, you will want to order this awesome peanut butter.  It also comes in chocolate with the same food value. I even posted it on my facebook page.

review/text: As a major peanut butter fan, I was a little dubious when I started hearing people talk about this powdered peanut butter as if it were the best thing since sliced bread. As it turns out, PB2 is quite compatible with sliced bread, or smoothies, milkshakes, ice cream, or just by the spoonful.<br /><br />This is the real deal. All of the flavor and taste of peanut butter, without all the peanut oil.

review/summary: Great for protein bars and more!!
review/text: I love this product!  I use it as an ingredient in my homemade protein bars but also have tried it every way I can think of.  As a peanut butter junkie, I was not sure I would like this, but its great.  Mixed per the instructions with water and I think it tastes as good or better than most commercial brands and without the fat.  Okay, but I am lazy, too. I empty the original package into a glass container with a snap on lid.  I find it easier to get the product out without spilling this way.  It also makes it easy to dip bananas for each bite.  Sprinkles on vanilla or chocolate ice cream? You betcha!  Here is one that sounds weird, but don't knock it until you try it.  Mix two tbsps. powder with one tbsp. water and five or six drops of your favorite hot sauce.  Spread this over a freshly grilled hamburger and enjoy.  It sort of tastes like Thai beef satay, only better and juicier.  It is a little pricey at this size and I am hoping to find larger, bulk sizes.

review/summary: Where has this been all my life?
review/text: I hesitated to try this as, frankly, powdered peanut butter sounded repulsive.  However, since I was getting free shipping, I gave it a try.  At first taste, I thought it maybe needed a little more salt, but by my second taste, I was hooked on it, just as it is.  I like that I can add a tiny bit more water than it calls for and make it a little creamier, easier to spread.  I LOVE peanut butter, but almost always avoid it because of the fat and calories (even though I know "it's a good fat").  When you're counting calories, you just can't have 200 calories for 2T of peanut butter very often.  45 calories?  Done!  I love this stuff and don't think I will ever be without it in my pantry again.

review/text: I used to buy Better'n Peanut Butter but this is by far a better alternative. At first, I was a little leery about having to reconstitute my peanut butter but this is a very tasty alternative and the dehydration makes the product more versatile. I would suggest that you make sure that the product is well mixed or the consistency will be bumpy/powdery and not as good. Occasionally, I will add a little stevia to sweeten the mixture and make it a little more like peanut butter. Today, I am buying 6 more so I definitely recommend this product.

review/summary: Simply Amazing!!
review/text: I was pretty excited when I accidentally came across this product on Amazon! But --- I really like peanut butter, and how could they make it taste good and take all that oil and all those calories out? A ton of reviewers claimed it was good - but I just had to see for myself. I ordered both the regular and chocolate.  I couldn't wait to get the shipment. It came today (sooner than expected) - and I immediately mixed up the regular PB2. At first it looked like grainy stuff and water. I kept stirring - and pretty soon my spoon was coated with peanut butter - and I had a nice little mound of peanut butter in the bowl! Well - at least it looks like peanut butter - that's something! Then I tasted a little with my finger. Wait .... WHAT?? Seriously - it really IS peanut butter!! It looks like it, smells like it and tastes like it! I grew up in the mid-west, enjoying peanut butter and sweet pickle sandwiches. (Yes - sounds weird, I know - but have you tried it? Wonderful!) I'm trying to lose weight and eat healthier - and those can't be enjoyed very often. I've been using the high fiber whole grain tortillas that are only 50 calories - so I spread some PB2 down the center - and placed a few pickle slices on top. I rolled up and tasted ----- perfect! I know I'm going to love this stuff! Another thing I like to do - is just scoop a spoonful of peanut butter and eat it (we call it a "peanut butter pop"). Well guess what - this is good enough that you can even do that! If you are used to Jiff like I am - just sprinkle a bit of Splenda in the PB2 as you mix it up for that little bit of extra sweetness! I read a few reviews by people who said PB2 wasn't anything like real peanut butter - and I have to say, I have no idea what they are talking about!! I was fully prepared to sacrifice flavor for the goal of lowering fat and calories - but I'm so excited to find out I don't have to! Oh - and the PB2 Chocolate is pretty darned good stuff too! Buy PB2 and try it for yourself - you'll find a million ways to use it, I'm sure! All I wonder - is where has this been, and why didn't I know about it? I'll be telling every nutrition conscious person I know! Happy, healthy eating!!

review/text: Bought this product on Amazon just over a week ago, and it's almost gone already! That should suffice for the "how'd you like it?" part. It's a pretty good sub for actual pb on sandwiches, etc., (found it mixed better with a bit of hot water rather than cold) but it's at least as good if not better in smoothies. First day, I tried it with the banana as folks had suggested, but discovered I liked it even better with just cold almond milk. Since then, I've been adding a packet or two of stevia and a tablespoon of ground flax to the mixture and having it in a tall glass with ice cubes; tastes like a pb milkshake! Yum. Only slight negative is the sugar they add to the powder; would prefer if this company sold a plain pb version (with or without the salt). Other than that, it's just about perfect.

review/summary: The Best Thing Since Sliced Bread!
review/text: I used to go to summer camp when I was a kid and my nickname was the Peanut Butter Kid because I put peanut butter on everything.  I put it on watermelon and I used to put it in my cup of vanilla ice cream.  This was in 1970 before peanut butter and ice cream was an actual flavor at ice cream parlors.  I should have patented it at that time, but what did a 10 year old girl know?<br /><br />As I got older my love for peanut butter grew and I continued to put it on all kinds of things and of course, peanut butter sandwiches.  Sometimes with jelly, sometimes with marshmallow fluff and frequently just plain peanut butter on bread!  To this day, it is still one of my favorites.  Because peanut butter is so fattening, I hardly ever eat it.....until, I discovered PB2.  Oh my goodness, what an awesome, awesome discovery.  Peanut Butter with a fraction of the calories and all of the taste.<br /><br />PB2 is dehydrated peanut butter where the fat has been squeezed out of the peanuts so what is left is pure protein, no guilt goodness!  I'm always dieting and watching my weight and PB2 has made it so much easier.  There are so many ways to eat this PB2.  I add a teaspoon to protein drinks in the morning.  I rehydrate it with water and dip carrots, apples and watermelon in it.  I mix jelly directly into the PB2 and put in inside a whole wheat tortilla and roll it up.  If you like Pad Tai, make some noodles, shred some carrots and other vegetables and toss some PB2 in and you have a nice Pad Thai.<br /><br />When mixed with water, the texture is very similar to smooth peanut butter, but a bit drier because the oil has been removed.  The taste is pure peanut.  A drop of honey can easily be added for a sweet touch.<br /><br />PB2 is easy to travel with and I always have some with me when I leave home as I like to have healthy snacks when the urge hits.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this peanut butter for anyone who loves peanut butter and is watching their weight.  With PB2, you can have your cake and eat it too!

This stuff makes it very convenient to add extra protein and flavor to your diet at any time of the day.  No mixing thick, oily peanut butter is really nice.  Or, wondering what the other 10% of the ingredients are in that off-the-shelf brand of peanut butter. The single packages are pretty expensive, so I think next time I will be ordering the twelve pack of 6.5 ounce bottles instead.

review/summary: Nice alternative to high fat peanut butters
review/text: PB2 is pretty good! Taste is comparible to regular peanut butter.  My husband really likes it.  I find that you need more water than suggested, but that is just a personal preference.

review/text: Does not taste like peanut butter at all.  Leaves a foreign taste in your mouth that does not taste natural.  Avoid this product if you're looking for a viable alternative for peanut butter.

review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised
review/text: Being a peanut butter lover, I decided to try this in my daily protein shakes to cut back on calories. I add 1 serving to my usual fruit smoothie and it blends very well and tastes great.  I also like to add a serving of it to my coffee drinks, but just know that if you mix it in with a spoon, it will eventually settle at the bottom of water based drinks. The nutritional benefit is 5g of protein per serving and a mere 40 calories (versus 180 calories for a serving of peanut butter). Unfortunately when you cut out the calories, you also cut out the heart healthy fats so I wouldn't recommend it as a complete substitute for real peanut butter if you're eating peanut butter for healthy heart reasons. However, if you're like me and love the peanut butter taste and your want a quick 5g of protein here and there, and need to watch your calories, it's definitely worth it.

review/summary: Love peanut butter but hate the fat
review/text: Although it doesn't compare to Jif, which is my favorite PB, it is very good. I do miss the salt though, so I add just a pinch. My daughter and niece(who is one of the pickiest eaters)like it also. I love the fact that it is so low in fat because I eat a lot of peanut butter. Its nice to have a lower fat product to choose from. I also really like the larger bag compared to the jar.

review/text: I love PB2.  First heard about it on Dr. Oz.  Use it all the time now.  Allows me to "binge" on my peanut butter addiction without worrying about the calories and fat.  Our entire family uses it.  Just love it!

review/text: I have used this product and same brand that comes in the jars and it is very good to put in my smoothies.  However, this product is vacuumed sealed and it looks like a pain to open, and I do not think the bag is reusable once open. So, I am going to save my jars and store product in those.  i just wish the picture they displayed looked like what I received in the mail!

review/text: Love love love this peanut butter!!! I used to use Better than peanut butter til I found this.  It has a real peanut taste and isn't sweet at all...I buy the large container and fill up my smaller ones.  Also, making it with super cold water makes it colder itself and more enjoyable!

review/text: Pb 2 is good in smoothies or baking when you want a PB flavor without the fat.  It's low in calories and still has enough protein and other  nutrients after the processing.  I would prefer to have no sugar added or at least substitute the sugar with Stevia.  Otherwise it is a really useful and good tasting product.

review/summary: Tastes like real peanut butter
review/text: At first, using PB2 was confusing as the ratio of powder to water in the directions gave me a very dry crumbly mess. As I experimented, I found adding more water, a little at a time, gave me the consistency of peanut butter that I desired. I like that the fat is almost all removed and when prepared, can be used just like regular peanut butter with much less calories. A treat for me as I love peanut butter but can enjoy it more so using PB2.<br /><br />I did remove one star as I'm not happy that sugar is added to this product (wish it was an artificial sweetener or nothing at all).

review/summary: Pros and Cons
review/text: In my never ending quest to find low calorie nutritious food, I bought some of this powdered peanut butter. I love peanut butter and eat a little bit most days of the week.  I am somewhat conditioned to the natural flavor and richness of the real thing.<br />I'd read that this PB2 is not the same as regular peanut butter, but many reviewers say it's a good substitute.  Therefore I expected it to be different, but not distasteful. I'm used to eating healthy fare and realize there has to be a trade off.  However, I was quite disappointed in this product. It feels chalky and tastes like stale fake peanuts. For someone on a restricted diet who is desperate to eat some type of peanut butter, this may work. I'll stick to the regular stuff and continue on my way.

review/summary: good for protein shakes
review/text: This is very good for protein shakes when you dont want to add alot of calories or fat. I have never used it for anything other than flavoring so I can't really comment on using it as just peanut butter. I would buy it again.

review/summary: AWESOME!
review/text: I am addicted to peanut butter and could easily eat a whole jar. Of course I never do it and the only reason I don't is because of the zillion calories. This tastes exactly like peanut butter and is done in a second - just add water - and 2 tablespoons only have 45 calories (as opposed to 2 tbsp of peanut butter that have 200). Amazing, simply amazing.

review/summary: LOVED PB2
review/text: I am the leader in our Wyoming TOPS club. As one of our programs we compared peanut butters for taste, calories, fat, sugars etc. PB2 was at the top. The taste was like the expensive higher fat and calorie brands. Easier to store and take on trips. The texture was great for me since I can't eat nuts unless they are pureed. Loved PB2

review/text: I love this stuff!  It's low in calories and blends well in shakes.  I haven't tried reconstituting to use as I would peanut butter, but it's on my list.  I can't wait to use all of this, so I can try the chocolate version!
