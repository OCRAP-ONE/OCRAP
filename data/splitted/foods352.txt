review/summary: confessions of an addict
review/text: Two great flavors in one cookie. The shortbread is melt-in-your-mouth scrumptious and the tooth-satisfying crunch of the hazelnuts make me crave them. They make the best accompaniment to a cup of tea. Elegant enough to serve to honored guests. I'm addicted. Eat them every day. Yumm.

review/summary: Almost like Grossmutter used to make
review/text: Update Dec 2011 - I went to order these for a third year in a row, and was confused by the new description and pricing. It used to be by 8 oz bag, now 3 oz bag but buy 4 get 1 free. In fact, I just checked with the seller and the ten dollars is for five bags, not just one. Whew--Christmas is saved!<br /><br />My mother and I miss the German Christmas cookies we used to make from my grandmother's recipes, but neither of us can manage baking them anymore. These are very similar to what we called Haselnuss Brot, but without the royal icing and hazelnut half on top. I ordered these for last Christmas, and we were very pleased--pleased enough to be ordering them again this year. (FYI, the ones we got last year were round, not heart-shaped like the ones in the photo.)

review/summary: Dingo Munchy Stix made my dog very sick
review/text: Please don't buy these for your dog. These have artificial colors and pork in them that is not listed on the product description online. These made my dog very ill. He had diarrhea and was throwing up for a week. I was very worried about him. This was the only change in his diet, I feed him all natural food with no artificial anything. I thought these were made of chicken & natural accourding to the online description but they are not.

review/summary: Our Dogs Like These, By Jingo!
review/text: The ten Munchy Stix are encased in a clear plastic shell backed by a bone shaped piece of cardboard. The chews are roughly five inches in length and look like little, thin salamis or slim Jims. Unlike the former, however, these rawhide chews are not soft and pliable, but rigid and crunchy. Each Stix is a compressed , cylindrical stick formed with bits of rawhide, chicken, and  pork. Dingoï¿½  tells us that these Stix have the same great taste as the larger chicken/rawhide chews in an easy to chew treat. Further, we are told, these Stix are healthy and fun to chew, helping to promote clean teeth and gums.<br /><br />Ingredients: Rawhide, chicken, Pork, Water, Corn, Sugar, Salt, Potassium sorbate, Red 40.<br /><br />Both of our dogs and their occasional guests love these Stix. I don't know how much chew value they have because they're totally consumed in about five minutes, sometimes longer for little Piper. I'd rather these were manufactured in the US and not China, but so far through many packags of Stix our dogs have had no ill effects and still look forward to their Stix.

review/summary: Great Treat !!
review/text: I have a very very very picky Chihuahua that will only eat one brand of dog treats , Wagon Train . I think I spend more money a week on his little butt then I do my self =] . Every now an then I watch my sons Chihuahua which is from the same litter as mine and he just so happen had a few stix's with him . Now idk if it was a little competition thing between the dogs , but Pimp & Daddy were both fighting over them !! So I decided to order a few one day since the price was so low . Sure enough he has been eating them ever since !! So I order him 2 packs every time I place a order from amazon =] .<br /><br />FYI: Not to mention he looks so cute with his little paws holding them and although he is small he is still able to hold them , run with them , and eat them .

review/summary: Dingo products are excellent
review/text: I had previously purchased Dingo mini rawhide bones for my parents Siberian Husky and Shar Pei and those two ate those bones without any hesitation.  With this knowledge, I thought that I would try these Munchy Stix for our Yorkshire Terrier for Christmas.  At the time, Amazon had these for a ridiculously low price and I purchased way more than was needed to fill her stocking.  She ate these up like there was no tomorrow and they leave little to no crumbs afterwards.  I do not know what else I can say about these, as I can not comment on their flavor or texture, but our puppy loves them.

review/summary: Nice Surprise for Pups!
review/text: We have a small terrier mix and two chihuahua mixed pups. The terrier is very curious and loves when the mailman brings "boxes" ~ she has to go through everything with me when I open them and then turns the box over to make sure nothing is left inside of it. Occasionally, she gets her own "box" with pup toys (which I am also looking into ordering from Amazon as they have some nice products and many 4 for 3 deals), etc., so these were a great treat for her to find in a box full of towel sets I had also ordered. There were more in the package than I had expected, all the pups liked them (the terrier, the largest, is 16 pounds). I could see how a larger pup would go through these very fast however they were a perfect surprise for our smaller pups and at one a day for each of them, will last a little while. For the price however, they were a great treat and a good value for us. And our little terrier mix is just beside herself with joy that there was something special in the box just for her (and the other pups as well).

review/summary: Good Treat in Moderation
review/text: Dingo Munchy Stick / B000FPM5DA<br /><br />When I first bought these, my puppy was 3 months old and 6 pounds heavy. I wanted something that he could chew on to keep him interested and out of trouble when I couldn't watch him for short periods of time, for instance, when I take a shower. The treats didn't quite last the entire shower, but they did the trick for a time. Now he's a month older and another 6 pounds heavier and I'm lucky if the treat lasts long enough for me to get to the shower!<br /><br />Obviously, my dog likes these. He finishes them very quickly, maybe too quickly for the price, but the Amazon 4-for-3 deal still makes it worthwhile. I'm a little concerned about the rawhide in the sticks - I have been told by our trainer that rawhide can cause impaction in the digestive tract - but I think that the small shreds of rawhide in these sticks are probably safe. Still, I'm considering phasing these out to beef-hide sticks (not the same as rawhide), especially since the Dingo Stix do not last very long.<br /><br />As usual, I had no trouble with Amazon shipping, and the Stix look and smell the same as the ones from the local pet store - no weird odor or any signs of spoilage from sitting in a warehouse too long. I will probably continue to order these for as long as the 4-for-3 deal lasts.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll

review/text: I have a black lab and mini eskimo spitz and they both love dingo munchy stix!  These are great for a quick treat or snack, but if your dog needs more of a "chewing workout" try the mini bones or rawhides instead.  These munchy stix come in 2 flavors: beef (red) and a parsley and baking soda (green)variety that helps freshen stinky dog breath.  My dogs recommend that you get both!

A truly satisfying meal for breakfast or anytime.

review/text: This spaghetti sauce tastes good and has nice chunks of veggies in it. It is pretty flavorful and I find that I don't have to add a lot of seasonings to it for it to taste good. It is not a thin or runny sauce. The size of the jar is great for larger batches of pasta and the price here at Amazon is much better than the grocery store! I also like the fact that these come in plastic jars as opposed to glass. I find that it keeps well for about a week or so in the fridge if you do not use the whole jar at once. I am pleased with the purchase and would recommend this Ragu Chunky Pasta Sauce if you like a thick, rich sauce.

review/summary: Sugar - I knew I was making a mistake
review/text: I remember buying Ragu a few years ago and never buying it again, but I could not remember why. Just look at the container, its tomato sauce, what could go wrong. Everything about it is wrong for me now that I tried it once more and I am writing a review to remind me later. This contains sugar and sugar is same as poison for me, the taste just makes me mad. The container label says there is only 10g of sugar per 1/2 cup/128g serving, but when I eat it it feels like 50g. There is no tangy tomato flavor, it feels like I am eating juice or jam or something too sweet, not pasta sauce like. I compared it with a can of "Del Monte Chunky garlic and herb" sauce and Del Monte is so much better. It contains 9g High Fructose Syrup in place of Sugar but I felt it was much more satisfying, tastier, less sweet and more tangy than Ragu and its cheaper too. Did i miss to say Del Monte is Chunky while Ragu is not!, even when labelled Chunky. If you want to buy Del Monte sauce online with fast shipping try Amazon's grocery site "soap" dot com. Ragu is America's worst tasting sauce not like advertised at all, more like America's favorite Tomato flavored jam/syrup.<br /><br />Also double checked ingredient list on the bottle and it says sugar while amazon says corn syrup. Amazon should have said sugar and helped me save $18, so 1 star for amazon too.

I will definately buy this product again because it is easy to take with me to the gym and taste great.

review/text: Got these to go with my Jelly Belly jelly bean dispenser I got for Christmas. These things are great! You will love them - especially if you love sour candy. Even though I love sour candy, I often find myself not liking certain flavors in a variety pack such as this, but with Jelly Belly Sours, this is not the case. All five flavors: Apple, Lemon, Cherry, Grape and Orange taste great separately and together. And they have only 140 calories for a whopping 35 beans!

review/text: Ah, finally, a treat that JP, my dog loves. Wellness came out with a "Pure Rewards" beef jerky bits for dogs, and these all-natural, tender jerky treats are highly palatable, even to the most discriminating palate. Best of all, the ingredients are easy to understand (which is important), and contain: beef, dried chicory root, cultured whey, sea salt, lecithin, and mixed tocopherols (which is a natural preservative). Four paws up for these tasty treats! Absolutely tasty and palatable!

Would eat one on the way to work at midnight to hold me over until a 4 am lunch. They did just that, satisfying and filling. They are chewy so a glass or container of liquid of your choice would be good.<br />Then they went up to their regular price of about $1.35 to $1.50 each and I didn't buy them again. But I missed them so I shopped around and found them here at Amazon for a great price when I ordered 2 boxes cause that made the shipping free!<br />They have 6 g fiber, 13 g whole grain, 6 g protein and are low in sodium at 180 calories.<br />The choc chip ones have 5 g fiber, 16 g whole grain, 6 g protein and also low in sodium at 190 calories.

review/text: I liked these (although not as much as the chocolate chip) and the ingredients and vitamins seemed good (even though a tad too sweet) but..everytime I'd eat one I'd become ill.  I couldn't figure out why until I researched the ingredients.<br /><br />I'm moderately to severely allergic to MSG and it gets worse as I get older.  I kept reading the ingredients wondering if there was something in these affecting me and after a little internet research found that the "Maltodextrin, Brown Rice Syrup, Natural Flavorings, Whey Protein Isolate and possibly a few other ingredients contain varying amounts of MSG.  The combination of all these was enough to make me sick.  I'll have to stick to snacks without such a high combination as other snacks haven't had such an effect on me. They did taste good, however... :(

review/summary: Go flourless AAA+++
review/text: I love Ezekiel products.  No flour=no fat gain.  I use Ezekiel for bodybuilding because they make the most nutritional grains that provide sustained energy with a minimal insulin response, and of course they are a reputable ALL NATURAL company.  Flour containing products are not as healthy and spike insulin (causing fat gain) compared to than sprouted grains, so to me flour has no place in everday diet (occasional desserts are a different story).  I don't even have anything to comare Ezekiel to because nothing else I know of is flourless in terms of bread or cereal.  Great products!  Of course raisin is the best tasting of the cereals in my opinion but the others are fine too.  They are a bit pricy, but you really do get what you pay for.<br />You know why many big name cereals (or any product for that matter) costs less?<br /><br />1. lower quality ingredients<br />2. they add nutritionally USELESS things like trans fat (if you see the word 'hydrogenated' in the ingredients, there are trans fats present.  Yes, even if the label says 0g trans fat because that actually means &lt;0.5g), high fuctose corn syrup, etc. etc. to extend shelf life of the product.<br /><br />In other words, many companies put ingredients in their products that have negative nutritional value so they can make more money by having less products reach their date of expiration.  IMO this should be illegal and until it is, I urge people to make the choice boycott any company that does this...  and instead support real companies that understand the connection between the earth and all living things.<br /><br />plantin seed, just plantin seeds  (lol bill hicks)

review/summary: Like extra healthy Grape-nuts
review/text: This is the only Ezekiel 4:9 product I've tasted, but I personally like it.  My first experience with it reminded me of Grape-Nuts - except much more crunchy.  Took a bit to get used to that, but then I was hooked.  I'm not especially fond of hot cereal, so I've never tried it this way, but I bet it would be good if you do like your cereal warmed - or if you find it too crunchy to eat cold.  People with false teeth or chewing difficulties might want to either eat this warm or let it soak awhile.<br /><br />I noticed that many reviewers say they eat this with soy milk.  I recently learned that studies have shown that soy is not healthy for you, particularly the processed forms such as soy milk and soy powder.  Please do your research.  For myself, I've decided I'm actually better off with cow's milk than with soy milk. Here's just one of the many articles on the subject: [...]<br /><br />Back to the subject ... I really do not taste much cinnamon in this cereal, so if you're not crazy about cinnamon, rest assured this cereal will not be overpowering.  It only has 1 gram of fat per 1/2 cup serving and contains 7 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber.  I find it a great alternative to eggs if you like to start your day with a good source of protein.<br /><br />Now I think I will try the almond variety ... and will post a review after I've tasted it.

So, when I found it on Amazon with such a great price, I bought the 6 box deal and have been stocked up for a few months now and reduced my cost for groceries. Thanks Amazon.

review/summary: goodness and sweetness without necessary extras
review/text: I have been using this product for about a year now.  It tastes good and the cinnamon and raisins add just the right sweetness, without added sugar.  The price on Amazon makes it more affordable, and since it is organic, the amount of pesticides would be less, making it more healthy for you.  Definitely a winner!

review/text: I have tried the almond and cinnamon raisin and my favorite is the cinnamon raisin.  Love how this cereal supresses my appetite.  Hard to find a really healthy cereal that tastes good but this defiantly does taste great!  I paid $7.00 plus tax at my local health food store for the cinnamon raisin.  I plan to buy this product on amazon.. sooo much cheaper... $2 a box cheaper for me.  Such a great value on Amazon.

review/text: I love this cereal!  It is healthy, filling, and tastes great.  All natural ingredients without any added sugar.  The raisins are great, and I don't find them to be too hard as some others have complained of.  I also bought the original kind and I add my own raisins and slivered almonds to it.  Great buy on Amazon as the price is a bit higher in the grocery store.

review/text: We try to eat organically whenever possible and have been fans of Ezekiel cereals for a long time.  Only a few stores on our Hawaiian island stock it and they regularly run out.  Ordering them in bulk from Amazon is perfect for us.  My husband is a real raisin fan and on busy mornings appreciates the convenience of having them already in his cereal.  The cinnamon is a bonus, too!

review/summary: Didn't think I'd like it but now I'm hooked
review/text: My nutritionist put me on on a low carb, no added sugar diet, and this brand was one that was recommended for cereals. When I saw it in the bowl, I worried. The grains are small and the almond milk I added seemed to vanish into the dense cereal quicksand. Yes, it has taken a little to get used to the texture, but I've really grown to enjoy the taste. It is rich, not cardboard- or grass-like, as can happen with so many simple, stripped down cereals. The raisins add just a touch of sweetness; I don't miss the added sugar I would get in a granola or similar cereal. And the nutrition content is excellent compared to many natural cereals.

Well, I really like this cereal and do not have any issues with it being to hard to chew like some said, and I just had two crowns put in and still have one temp and no problem. It tastes alot like grape nuts. I will buy again.

review/summary: Broke Tooth!
review/text: I have very healthy 45 year old teeth and one bowl of this cereal was enough to break a large chuck off one of my teeth.  Be careful as I never expected to find gravel hard chunks in my bowl of breakfast cereal.  I am just sickened by it since I do take such pride in my teeth and to make matters worst its a front tooth!  If you don't like to chew gravel for breakfast then you likely won't enjoy this cereal.  Yeah it taste pretty good and may be healthy for you but not worth breaking your teeth over.  We won't even talk about denist bills.  Notice I am not the only review about broken teeth from this cereal.  The chunk broke off my tooth is at least the size of a average size pea so not just a tiny little salt grain.  If you like your teeth stay away from this cereal!  Ezekiel Almond Cereal

review/summary: Tasteless grit that almost broke a tooth
review/text: I eat a lot of healthy food and am willing to try new ones.  So recently I tried this cereal.  The only plus I can report is that it had a lot of raisins in it.  Which is a good thing because, without the raisins it would have been completely tasteless.  But the worst thing about it is that it contains some very hard bits that almost broke a tooth.<br /><br />That was my experience the first time, eating it cold with milk.  I noticed that the box suggested it could also be eaten warm...I figured that heating it with milk might soften the hard bits, so I decided to try it (I was also trying desperately to avoid throwing away the $5.49 investment).  My theory was wrong.  The hard bits are un-softenable.  I dumped the rest of the box of cereal...and $5.49 + tax...in the compost bin.

There was a Seventh Day Adventist commune there at the time and they would give me huge boxes of the bread to pass out.  I became known as the "bread lady" and I was only 24.<br /><br />This product, I believe has saved my life for the last 30 years.  Most of my siblings and all of my parents had cancer and passed on because of the cancer. Not one of them ate this bread. I wish we had known about this bread growing up, thier lives could have been spared. I sometimes eat up to five pieces a day with no weight gain. I eat the slices raw and untoasted, but made into toast or french toast it is delicious too.<br /><br />The price has gone up, but I got a bunch of loafs on sale for $3.99 each at "Down to Earth", in Kapolei Hawaii.<br />If you write the company they will send you coupons.<br /><br />If you want to be regular, energetic, and disease free eat this bread and none other.<br />Deb

It's filling and fabulous!<br /><br />Cinnamon Raisin would be good if it wasn't loaded with rock-hard tiny raisins. They are terrible! They have no taste, and are somewhat difficult to chew.<br /><br />I will never get Cinnamon Raisin again, but I look forward to trying Golden Flax and Original, and picking up another box of Almond.

review/text: I bought this based on the great reviews. I appreciate that it's super healthy, but it tastes very bland and the texture is rock hard (think grape nuts w/ hard raisins). I feel like I'm going to lose my fillings w/ every bite. I tried soaking it in milk for a few minutes but to no avail. The box suggests serving it either cold or hot after cooking it over the stove. I can see why it should be cooked soft.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this cereal but I don't. My husband hates it too. We're wondering how we're ever going to finish all 6 boxes (I'm mixing it w/ other cereals for now).

review/summary: Make your own & save some money
review/text: I bought a box of this recently.  Even though it sounded pretty "healthy", I figured, how bad can it be.<br /><br />Well, I just had my first serving, and decided that I would share a recipe that very closely approximates the taste and texture of this cereal.  Here it is:<br /><br />4 cups course saw dust<br />1 cup raisins<br />2 Tablespoons sugar<br />1 Teaspoon ground cinnamon<br /><br />Blend all ingredients, serve with cold milk.<br /><br />How on earth can anyone give this stuff more than one star?  The serving size listed on the box is 1/2 cup. First of all, who eats 1/2 cup of cereal?  I doubled up on the serving, and poured a full cup in the bowl... added some 2% organic milk..... yummmm!  Wrong!  Now I know why the serving size is specified at 1/2 cup..... anybody that can gag down more than a half cup of this stuff in one sitting, is a better man than I am. Seriously.... what possible reason could anyone have for eating this stuff?  I tried my best to choke down this stuff, but the more I ate, the worse the experience became.  About a third of the way through, I cried uncle and dumped the remaining meal in the trash.<br /><br />There may be a use for this cereal, but eating it, is not a viable option.  I don't even think birds or small rodents would want to eat it.  I may mix it with some water, and fill some of the cracks in my driveway with it.

review/summary: raisins are HARD AS ROCKS...................
review/text: and they aren't softening in the milk. you will need strong healthy teeth to chomp on them.  the cereal itself sops up a lot of milk & it expands quite a bit (so don't pour too big a bowl like i did. now i'm trying to stuff it all down). There is the occasional really hard nugget of grain mixed in. when i come across one it tends to jam into my cavity & is a little uncomfortable.  but for the most part the cereal is soft & easily chewed just like mashed up wheaties.<br /><br />  Honestly this tasted strange to me on the first couple bites but as i sit here enjoying my first bowl i'm getting used to it.  before i bit in i thought i detected a weird smell.  i think it's just the way one or more of the grains smells & i wasn't familiar with the scent of that particular grain. or maybe cause they are sprouted they smell different. OR perhaps the addition of cinnamon did it. if so it's the only time i smelled something w/cinnamon that didn't smell better w/the cinnamon added.<br /><br />  in summary i think this is a pretty good cereal for those into super healthy foods.  The average person looking to add some whole grains could do a lot better in the taste & texture departments. If you are interested in sprouted grains specifically then i can't say for sure as this is the only sprouted grain cereal i've ever had.  I think i may try another box but next time i'll get the one with almond slivers. perhaps those flavors will be more complementary. and i'll bet the almonds are softer than the raisins.......i'll be sure to review it once i try it!

But Whole Foods stopped stocking it, so I went online to search it out.  The first time I was able to buy the same product.  This time, much to my dismay, I ordered a totally different product although the name is the same.  The new dijon mustard vinaigrette is no more French or authentic than any Kraft product.  It is glutenous and slightly sweet and--to make a long story short--I threw both bottles out.

review/text: Since we have been following the package directions that say to feed 10 treats at one time, our cat rarely throws up at all and her stools are plumper. She has always had tiny, hard stools until we started feeding her these treats. We can tell by her stool if she hasn't had a 10 treat dose in a couple of days. She eats these as readily as any other packaged treat we give her. A great find as cleaning up grassy vomit almost every day was getting quite tedious! The auto ship feature is also a big plus. We can't always get these treats here on our island when we need them. Thanks Amazon!
