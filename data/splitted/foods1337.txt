review/summary: Schar gluten-free pasta
review/text: Gluten and I don't get along, and I'm married to a Sicilian who thinks every meal should include pasta. We've tried spaghetti squash and every pseudo-pasta out there. This brand was recommended by Barbara Kafka, a cookbook author I respect, so I tried it. It's Italian (despite the name) and has been around for eighty years, so they know what they're doing. It works for us. Not quite the same, but my husband is satisfied. Whew.

My order only come with 2 bags of 2" Original Crackers and 2 bags of 2" Cracked Pepper Crackers.  So I am short of 2 bags of crackers and I didn't get the Cinnamon crackers which I really wanted to try.

review/text: I ordered this basket for a granddaughter to arrive for Easter.  The image appears much larger than the actual basket and the photo is definitely designed for marketing.

For the value I could have spent the same amount of money and had a better filled basket.

review/summary: REALSALT SEASON IS EXCELLENT
review/text: You can put this stuff in practically anything.  It is great stuff, but it is pricey.  I wish the company would offer a deal on the bigger bottles and with free shipping.  Then, I would buy more.  As it is, I probably won't order more because of cost. I have tried to get my local heathfood store to carry it and they say they can't get it.  That seems odd to me.  They used to carry it.  Anyway, it's worth trying.  I used to go through a lot of it when the store carried it.  Maybe if everyone writes to amazon and to the company, we can get a better deal on here.  I am going to write them.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />My healthfood store is now carrying this.  They are only ordering the small bottles.  But, I spoke to a representative at the real salt company and they told me that it is better to have stores carry small bottles so the product stays fresh.  I agree with them and now just buy the small bottles.

review/summary: Perfect for those who must avoid soy product
review/text: This is a good bar, if it is refrigerated before eating. I cannot eat anything with soy and have trouble processing protein so this bar is a great way for me to get protein into my body, especially if I am travelling and can keep it cool. The only complaint I have about it is the taste when at room temperature is not really great...edible but not tasty. For those who must avoid soy this is one of the few protein bars that I have found that contains no soy and is perfectly safe to eat. I am on medication that will cause my blood pressure to rise dramatically if I eat soy products so this bar is perfect, as long as it is chilled and not warm.

review/text: We bought these for my husband who has a hard time with ingredients of most bars, but these bars give him the energy he needs without all the side effects.  He says they give him the boost he needs to start his day & again at midmorning.  The taste is great, they are easy to take with you, just grab & go & they satisfy every taste he needs, i.e., sweet, crunch, smooth,...he's a texture person & really loves these bars. I have a brother who has special needs so I ordered him some too & he absolutely loves them too!  Try them, you won't be disappointed!

review/text: My Sweet Bay Laurel Herb plant arrived last week, in the perfect box.  It was healthy, still moist, looked great, and I am sure that my soups & stews will greatly benefit from this sweet little plant. I've planted it in a 20 inch pot.  It's getting plenty of direct sunshine.  It's already growing and putting out new leaves and I really believe it has already grown at least an inch in just this short time.  Wow.  In a 20" pot how large will it grow?  Thanks Amazon & 9GreenBox!  This is a keeper.

review/summary: Tiny plants, arrived damaged
review/text: These plants are tiny! About two inches tall. Not sure any of them will survive. This plant grows very slowly, so it will take years for it to grow before I could harvest the leaves for cooking. One of the plants arrived damaged - leaves were black. I ordered one for myself and one for my friend as a present. What a dissapointment. In addition, they charged me for shipping for two plants separately (and the shipping is expensive), but the plants arrived in one box.

review/summary: Dissapointed
review/text: I purchased two sweet bay plants from this vendor.  I did not expect a fully mature tree for the price, but I was very dissapointed when I received the plants.  They were less than 4" in height and although healthy it will take quite a while for them to develop into a substantial plant.  I did contact the vendor and he stated that they grow quickly and to phone him back in the summer if they had not become more established.  Frankly, I think I should have received an acceptable plant in the beginning.<br /><br />Instead of dealing with this vendor any more,I went on line and ordered a plant from:<br /><br />Almost Eden<br /><br />1240 Smith Road<br /><br />Merryville, La, 70653<br /><br />337-375-2114 We appreciate your business, and hope you are pleased also.<br /><br />jeffm@almostedenplants.com<br /><br />This "SMALL TREE"  arrived promptly and was in excellent shape.  I spent about the same amount as I did for the puny seedlings.  This tree was 3' tall and extremely healthy.<br /><br />I would recommend any looking for a sweet bay laurel to contact the folks at Almost Eden.

review/summary: Stinky milk
review/text: This milk is stinky.We got this milk after our pediatricians recommendation, cause our newborn was extremely gassy and would spit up a lot.<br />Our baby seems to like the milk but i am not sure if that's because she's hungry or she doesn't know any better. Gassines and spit up were greatly reduced after use of this milk.<br />The baby is mostly breastfed and only supplemented with alimentum during the night, just one feeding.<br />She just turned 5 months old and we are still using the same milk.<br />For the price tag you would have thought it came with a better smell  but no.<br />I am wondering what is the real reason under the high price. i doubt its the ingredients,cause once you start reading the label you kind of starting feeling guilty of what you are feeding your baby. Unfortunately mother nature did not fill up my boobies with enough milk for baby's demand so i have to supplement with what i think its best for my baby.<br />I personally think that most babies are going to be fussy,gassy and lots of other things during the first 6 weeks of their lives and most parents will try anything to comfort them, including buying this highly priced formula.<br />I wish that the ready to feed formula came in other sizes too, and lasted longer when opened than just one hour.<br />i would rate this with five stars only if it was a little cheaper.

We were served Bewley's a lot of the time, so I bought it when we got back, and it is indeed far superior to TJ's. Then I bought some Barry's Irish tea (actually from Ireland) in the grocery store and did a taste test. Bewley's won, hands down.

review/text: Bewley's Irish teas are my teas of choice. I love strong tea and the Irish do it right. It's not bitter at all. If you like the taste of tea and want a little more kick of caffeine, I receommend this tea. This is slightly more mild than their strongest tea, which I have trouble finding. The other one if you want even stronger tea is Bewley's Gold (I think that's the name). The box is schoolbus yellow, and one teabag makes two cups officially, but I use one bag for a large mug and am HAPPY.

review/text: Udi's should almost call these "toasted oats" instead of granola, because they are so devoid of the usual clumpy, slathered in sugar trait of regular granola.  Simply toasted oats, crunchy, with just enough sweetness to make it work.  I add them to yogurt and other cereals or sometimes even casseroles.

There is a gold top (not red). I put a lable and a ribbon on them and they are perfect. I have used the oregatano flavor, it is nice, but not very strong.

review/summary: On behalf of Pita
review/text: My cat got addicted to these Crispies. She no longer even likes her usual crunchy cat treats. First I bought out one store's supply, then another. Soon there were none left in town. Then I checked on Amazon, and these were back-ordered. I made my order, and Pita and I waited through 3 anxious days of no Crispies. She was furious at me, and I was afraid she might run away. Thankfully, the Crispies arrived BEFORE the estimated delivery date, and all is well in Pita's world once more. But I see they are out of stock again. I should start planning now for the next supply. Why are these so hard to find?

review/text: My 7-year-old cat likes treats well enough, but Friskies Crispies (Salmon) are the first treats that she's ever begged for.  Every night at the same time, she climbs to the shelf where we keep them and cries and jumps up on my husband or me until we give her some.  After she gets a serving, she goes on her merry way.  She even has a new, distinct meow for these treats!  They seem to have the same ingredients as another brand we have, but there's something about these treats that makes her go wild.

review/summary: Good Taste, Good Boost
review/text: This 5 hour energy flavor is my favorite by far.<br />It tastes less "sweetened" than the other flavors and has a more natural, juicy taste.<br />The energy kick from 5 hour energy drinks always affected me mentally, rather than physically... which is a great thing.<br />For example, classic energy drinks usually get me very hyper and restless.  Some particularly strong ones even make my hands shake.<br />But these energy shots don't affect my body like that at all.  Rather, they create a sensation of great concentration and focus, which allows me to perform at my job much better.<br /><br />One word of caution is that if you drink more than 1 per day ( I was shooting 2 per day for a while ) this may create adverse health side effects. It greatly impacted my appetite.<br />If you are to rely on 5 hours for energy I recommend 1 per day, MAX.

review/summary: Gentlease has 1/5 the lactose of milk-based formula
review/text: A good way to start shopping for this product is to call Enfamil to see their current pricing, keeping in mind any differences in can size and number of cans in a case. I have purchased this product through Enfamil, Amazon and a few other places, always taking advantage of the best deals.  I have purchased Gentlease in every conceivable size and also case and continue to use it for my twins.  When they reach a year, we plan to go to quit.<br /><br />Next... The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding until six months of age. But here in the U.S. after your 3 months maternity leave, are you able to pump enough and store in a refrigerator at work? And you might need formula anyway as we do. I mention this because some imply their formula is as good as human breast milk.<br /><br />We're blessed with twins. They started out colicky and we found that Nutramigen worked at that time. They got through that phase and we've been using Gentlease and solids. After they're a year old it will be all solids. Our pediatrician recommended Gentlease. It has 1/5 the lactose of milk-based formula.<br /><br />I really researched formulas. There are even organizations promoting the sale of human breast milk and there are organizations wanting to stop the sale of human breast milk for fear of health hazards that the FDA cannot control. No matter, those offering breast milk do so at prohibitively high prices - nothing charitable about it.<br /><br />All the brands that I've seen have DHA and ARA, nutrients found in breast milk that promote brain and eye development, iron which is necessary for growth and many more ingredients. The government requires them to have certain ingredients. The major brands do not seem highly differentiated to me except for their specialy models. Gentlease is one of those.<br /><br />Gentlease is one of the special formulas because it has a much lower amount of lactose as well as broken down proteins to make it easier to digest.<br /><br />The prices vary and so do the size of the cans and the number of cans in a case. Unfortunately, I haven't seen Gentlease in big cans at the big box stores. One can also check at the local pharmacy or grocery store for comparison purposes. Keep an eye out for coupons too. You've got to keep constant watch for the best price, and there have been times when the Amazon price prevails.

I was hoping they tasted different and they probably do and that maybe my rabbit would give it a chance. In my opinion, it smelled like cigarette ash and my rabbit wouldn't eat it and just avoided it. I can't stand the smell and it seems my rabbit can't either but I spent $16 on this in Petco. I ordered a new bag of Kaytee Rainbow Rabbit food that smells like play-doh and paint and last time it ate every piece to give you an idea of how bad this is. I strongly would NOT recommend it.

Eat ten minutes before a long run with a drink of water and you will notice more energy when you hit the last mile of your run, at least that is what I seem to notice.<br /><br />Not candy; keep away from your kids.

Since the Sophia's dressing had those ingredients I was hopeful it would taste somthing like it. I was wrong. My husband had it on one salad and refused to eat it again. I never got around to using it. Whenever I had a Greek or Mexican salad, there was always another dressing I'd rather have. When I recently cleaned the refrigerator and pantry trying to get rid of things I don't use for more space, I tasted the dressing. The flavors don't seem to go with Greek food at all. I thought it was horrible and immediately threw out the open bottle and the 5 still remaining in the pantry. I'm sorry I had to purchase 6 of these. It was an expensive mistake.

review/text: My daughter is a vegan, so when I bake I use the powdered soy milk with the appropriate proportion of water to subsitute for regular milk and it works out fine. My omnivorous husband and son are happy, and I don't have to make something separate for my daughter - what's not to like!

review/text: I really like this product. Over the years, I've tried many brands. Some are a bit bitter. This soy milk is not bitter at all. My kids will even drink it with no complaints. I am going to try to get as many people in my family of 9 as possible to go vegan. I will be buying a great deal of this milk.

I subsequently notified the supplier and informed them of the problem. They indicated that we should discard the product and they would re-issue a replacement. The replacement product took about eight days to arrive and again the safety cap was not secured. This was not a good gift giving experience.

review/summary: Unexpectedly Wonderful
review/text: An Irish friend passed some of these along to me so that I could try them without risk and I must say, I'm impressed. My go-to porridge is Old Wessex Ltd. Scottish Style (sic) Porridge Oats but I love oats and wanted to try some from "the Auld Sod," so she very kindly surprised me with some from her personal stash.<br />I tend to prefer a sturdy rolled oat which these are not: they're small and thin. But they cook up to a comforting, creamy mass that's not only good with milk and a sweetener but plain with a bit of salt (which I always include) as well. The flavor is lovely--very "oatey," and like all whole grains, they stick to your ribs in a satisfying manner. Cooking one cup according to package directions yields two enormous servings that could economically and healthfully provide a delicious breakfast for several hungry children, if you're so inclined. Tip: try toasting them in the pot, stirring constantly (careful--they burn quickly), until they smell nice, then add your pre measured water and cook according to package directions.<br />My satisfaction was such that I was motivated to buy a bag of Flahavan's Jumbo Oat Flakes (they're also available organic) while shopping at our local Irish market yesterday and I fully expect them to be as good the Progress Oatlets. Now, if they'd just stock the Pinhead Oatmeal, I'd be a completely happy woman.<br />Update: not unpredictably, I like the (non-organic) Jumbo Oat Flakes even more than these and am glad I made the investment. I'd review them on their own but Amazon doesn't stock them. I'll buy the organic next time and my vendor has promised to order Flahavan's Pinhead Oatmeal as well. Since Amazon actually carries it, I'll review it once I've bought it.<br />BTW, the name is pronounced 'FLAvans (kinda like "taverns" without the r).

review/text: My husband and I eat this every morning and never tire of it.  Leagues better than American oatmeal ... wish we could get somebody here to start milling oatmeal this way.  We call our morning bowl the oatmeal souffle.  Not gluey.  Light and delicious.  I adapt the recipe on package to 1/3 cp oat flakes per serving, with one cp water.  Always soak first or cook to boiling at medium.  If you get distracted and it thickens too much add a bit more boiling water, cook a minute or two longer, and serve.  Lowers cholesterol; great source of fiber.

review/summary: is it a pack of 12 or 6?  make up your minds...
review/text: In the title of this item it states "16.2 ounce- pack of 12". BUT...if you read the description below- it states "pack of SIX" Huh? So now I have to wait and wonder what will be arriving. I purchase Friskies dry and wet food as a gift for my mother's cat. Mom can no longer drive, so it helps to have Amazon deliver heavy items like bags and cans of chow right to the door. (I'm in Tx, she's in CA) THis is the cat's favorite flavor of dry food, and she'll eat it quickly, so it would be nice to know if I should have ordered two of these packs, or just one! Just a note- for older cats who seem to be getting finicky, try them on strong seafood flavors. Sometimes their old tastebuds apparently can't enjoy bland turkey or chicken flavors. Every cat seems to enjoy the "surfin' favorites" in this variety.<br />(One last note- WHY does Amazon frequently state "hurry, only one left!" Huh? How could an operation as big as this have ONE left of an item?? That's ridiculous)

review/summary: Terrible cat food
review/text: This is the McDonald's of cat food. It's loaded with absolute crap that cats simply do not need and is designed to be highly appealing to customers who make purchasing decisions while minimizing costs to maximize profit. The top two ingredients are corn and corn meal, products that are simply cheap fillers which cats digest very poorly. It's also loaded up with artificial colors which cats simply do not care about, but makes the product prettier to humans. The product's protein is rather low at 30% and is derived from cheap protein sources like soybean meal and chicken by-product meal, it's so low that it should not be fed to kittens. While it's nutritionally adequate for adult cats, so is McDonald's for humans and I would hope that cat owners would aim to provide nutritionally optimal food for their cats diet. My friends fed this to my cat for two days after running out of EVO and my cat started wheezing much like a friend's cat who had been fed Friskies. Wheezing stopped after dumping this junk.

The instructions don't have you stir in the middle of cooking, but we have found that you do need to once, or we end up with some over-cooked pieces (which might be our microwave - as our wattage is very low and we have to cook it a little longer.)

review/text: Like the title says, its good in a pinch if you are hungry and not feeling the kitchen thing. As many others mention it is NOT a meal in a cup. Farm from it, more a side or appetizer.<br />With that said, the flavor is not all that bad, its a tad salty IMHO but adding some hot sauce or cut up veggies/hot dog seems to even it out. I've made a couple with no microwave just boiling water and they turned out ok. They make great trade offers when you find another Hamburger Helper aficionado in the sandbox(Afghanistan).<br />No where near as good as the big box mix BUT a heck of a lot easier to manage.
