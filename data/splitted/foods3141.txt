review/summary: Really Good For You
review/text: I won't lie, this stuff tastes AWFUL.  If you want to know what it tastes like--go outside and get some grass clippings, mix them with water, and toss in the blender.  That pretty much sums up the taste.  I don't bother mixing it with juice or anything sugary.  It's a waste of yummy juice.  The grass taste overpowers anything you mix it with, and I've found it's best just to mix with water and gag it down.  I literally hold my breath and just down it.<br /><br />Why put myself through the awfulness?  Because it's good for me.  I get an immediate energy boost and it also settles my stomach and digestive system.  If you read the back of the packet, it's a pretty impressive list of vitamins and minerals for just 35 calories.  There are a ton of health benefits found in chlorophyll and wheat grass is one of the best sources of it.

review/text: I have been using this product for 2 months now. I researched wheatgrass and this product specifically and was excited to get the health benefits ... but the only benefit I can honestly attest to is the digestive regularity it imparts.<br />Maybe this is specific to me, but I did not feel the energy boost, detox, and other wonderful things that other users experienced.

review/summary: Getting Used to It....
review/text: Just started this stuff last week and noticed after I drink it that my stomach gets kind of crampy and I'm a little nauseous and headachy.  I did some research and found out that is most likely a side-affect of detoxing and the body getting used to it.  I have never drank wheat grass before and did not realize that it should probably be "eased" into.  I'm going to cut my servings in half for the next couple days to see if it helps.  Giving myself a good month before I really decide if it's worth it and wondering if anyone else has experienced this.  I mix it with really cold apple juice and it actually tastes better than I thought it would.  Like other reviewers said...it's wheatgrass...not a chocolate shake.

review/summary: Energy and Vitamins in one cup
review/text: I started taking wheatgrass to supplement my current TTC diet (after reading several fertility books).  I have been drinking it for a month now.  I must say I am hooked.  Though the flavor is not the best, I have created the habit of drinking it first thing in the AM with my prenatal vitamins.  It gives me enery and I feel better about my lack of vegetables in my diet.  In addition, it makes you "regular".  Will continue using and buying from Amazon since it is so much cheaper than at GNC.

review/summary: ok, so it tastes gross, but your body will love it
review/text: i had no illusions of it tasting fantastic cuz come on, we're talking about dried grass that's powdered. but what i didn't expect was it tasting like tobacco. gross! i hold my breath & drink it as fast as i can every morning. i only mix it with water since i don't want the extra calories or sugar from juice.<br /><br />i've been gagging this stuff down for 30 days now & i do notice the benefits. i'm not on the "no carb diet" but i do try to stay away from carbs (starches & sugar). so the only thing i've changed is adding this wheatgrass. here are the benefits:<br />-thicker hair<br />-shiny hair (i've always had shiny hair but it seemed extra shiny)<br />-more energy<br />-skin has cleared up a bit<br />-most importantly, i've been regular! for me, that's truly amazing since i've been battling stomach issues for the last 12 years. not to be gross but it goes from constipation to kaka-rhea... so being regular for 30 days straight is a big deal to me.<br /><br />i can't wait to finish this stuff so i can buy the tablets instead. i can pop tablets all day long if it means i don't have to gag down the powdered form every morning.

review/summary: Awesome product
review/text: I just bought wheatgrass powder yesterday and I have to say I have experienced immediate results. I did a ton of research on it and everything seemed safe and beneficial, so I figured I would try it out. I hope it's not the placebo effect, but I feel great! I have had plenty of energy all day and a great attitude!<br /><br />First off flavor:<br />Everyone has been complaining about the flavor, but I think it tastes exactly like seaweed, which I like a lot. I can see how it isn't for everyone, but hey, if living forever was easy everyone would do it.<br /><br />Effects:<br />I had an immediate boost of energy last night but was still able to get to sleep at a reasonable hour. I usually am very sensitive to stimulants (such as caffeine), but this gave me just the perfect amount of energy. More so lack of fatigue than crazy energy like a red bull.<br /><br />Nutritional value is left to be seen, but I will update in a week or so.<br /><br />"Regular movements":<br />Just a warning, when you go to the bathroom it will come out green. Like Kermit the frog and spinach had a baby. Sorry to gross people out, but I thought you should know.<br /><br />Like I said before, it doesn't taste the best, and yes there are "other" side effects, but the benefits outweigh the negatives. All in all I am very excited to see how it will effect my life taking it on a continuous basis.

review/text: Ok, I just bought this two days ago, but I've tried other Amazing Grass products so I'm going with five stars.  I was using ORAC, but was desperate for a new flavor.  This one tastes grassy.  Of course it does.  What would you expect?  It's not bad.  I've mixed it with juice and I plan on mixing it with a smoothie soon.  That may make it taste better.  Be aware it's not something you want to sip with your morning cereal.  Just knock it back and get it over with.  The benefits totally outweigh the flavor.  Give it a try.

review/summary: I LOVE IT.
review/text: I LOVE IT.  I AM ALLERGY TO WHEAT, SOY, AND CHEMICAL SUGAR.  IF YOU ARE ALLERGY TO WHEAT, SOY, AND GLUTEN,  IT IS VERY SAFE TO DRINK THE WHEAT GRASS JUICE.  DR TOLD US TO EAT 5 SERVINGS OF VEGETABLE AND FRUIT A DAY,  WE DONT HAVE A TIME TO EAT A LOT OF FOOD WHEN WE ARE BUSY OR OUT OF TOWN, IT IS VERY EASY TO CARRY A SMALL JAR IN THE BAG, AND DRINK ONE OR TWO GLASSES OF WHEAT GRASS JUICE  WITH WATER OR ANY FAVORITE JUICE A DAY.  WHEAT GRASS JUICE HAS 5 SERVINGS OF VEGETABLE A DAY,  I CAN DRINK ONE OR TWO GLASSES A DAY AT 10 A.M. AND 3 P.M. THAT IT HELPS TO BOOST MY ENERGY AS THE WHEAT GRASS JUICE BOTTLE SAYS 2X MORE IRON THAN A 30 GRAM SERVING OF FRESH SPINACH AND 2X MORE DIETARY FIBER.  I STRUGGLED MY FATIGUE FOR A LONG TIME,  I AM DOING MUCH BETTER WITH MY NEW ENERGY AND IT HELPS IMPROVING THE UNDERACTIVE THYROID GLAND IF I DRINK 2 GLASSES OF WHEAT GRASS WITH 2 FISH OIL EVERYDAY.  CHECK THE FISH OIL IN THE GOGGLE THAT  FISH OIL REALLY HELPS TO IMPROVE THYROID GLAND. MY BLOOD TEST IMPROVED MUCH BETTER THAN BEFORE.  I LIKE TO DRINK IT PLENTY.  YOU CAN ADD 1/2 OF WATER AND 1/2 OF ANY APPLE JUICE, ORANGE JUICE OR GRAPE JUICE WITH MIX. GOOD LUCK!

review/text: I loved the Amazing grass in capsule form. It tasts better and gave me tonns of energy. But i decided to get it in a powder form, so my husband can join me. I started it first and i couldnt understand why i feel very hot all the time and have headaches. I feel like im on fire. I thought maybe its a coincidence. But 4 days later my hubby gave it a try and he felt hot and had bad headache too. So, i guess its the grass. I dont think i will be using it again. I cant go throught the day without pain medication now. I will go back to the pill form. For some reason works better for me. :(((( That was a waste of money.

review/text: I love wheatgrass with all its many virtues!! I thought I wouldn't mind the fact that this is not juice powder but ground up grass. The taste is great but I really do not like the gritty texture. It also does not mix easily even in plain water, which is annoying, and it doesn't stay mixed, ditto. I am stubborn so I won't throw it out, but I'm going to try mixing up 2 scoops with 8 oz water using my wonderful Cuisinart Smart Stick immersion blender, letting it settle, and straining through a coffee filter. Next purchase will be pure juice powder.

The inside is a semi-reasonable facsimile of traditional Turkish delight (although far softer and less chewey in texture) which is then coated in a very think outer layer of milk chocolate.<br /><br />As chocolate bars go... uh... well, they're low-fat, I suppose! I think the innards are pure gelatin and sugar.<br /><br />Do be aware that these come in a variety of packs containing different numbers of bars. At least as of the time of writing, these do not all work out at the same cost on a per bar basis. So it may well be worth your while doing your homework before deciding which deal is right for you.<br /><br />Enjoy in Moderation!<br /><br />Theo.

review/summary: Kitties go crazy for veggie cat food!
review/text: The two little darlings at my home have been eating this particular cat food since we got them from the local shelter at the ripe young age of 6 months.  We chose to switch them over to vegetarian cat food for two reasons: 1) both of us are ethical vegetarians, and 2) we could!<br /><br />We switched them using the same methods vets have recommended when undergoing any change in diet for felines--slowly mixing them together in differing proportions until all that they eat is the new kind of food.  In this way the cats do not undergo any kind of indigestion that might cause them to throw up (those with cats already will understand completely).<br /><br />But what was the surest sign that we were doing the right thing for our cats?  Even on the first day, and for everyday it was given to them after, they ignored the meat-based cat food, eating only the vegetable-based pieces from their bowl!  Everyday when I went to feed them in the morning, they would be waiting next to a bowl with meat-food detritus, staring impatiently for the vegetable goodness.<br /><br />As for their level of health, I have literally never known two cats to be sweeter or more active than these.  And I don't mean chaotic, but playful, pouncy, and sweet.  Is it all because of the food?  I can't say to 100% certainty.  But know this: when we got the kittens they were shy and scared, seemingly because both only have vision in their left eyes.  Now they are more daring than even the most normal of cats.<br /><br />All this and we don't have to participate in the inhumane practice of feeding waste animals to our companion friends!

review/summary: Some Education About Vegan Cats
review/text: Unfortunately most people are ill informed about vegan cats, including most veterinarians.<br /><br />Wild cats are in fact obligate carnivores. However, in domesticating the house cat and bringing it into our homes we have effectively removed the cat from its natural prey of mice, insects, birds, lizards, and other small creatures. During the past 100 years or so, as the human food industry was searching for a way to salvage and use all the waste materials from its processing lines, it came upon a wonderful solution. Lets boil it all up and dry it out and add it to the food we make for cats and dogs. As a result, the vast majority of commercial pet foods contain what are euphemistically referred to as the four D's, dead, dying, disabled, and diseased animals, along with other quite undesirable materials. Quite frankly, if you are feeding this junk to your pets, you are effectively poisoning them. We are seeing diseases in pets today that we have never seen before because of the wide variety of contaminated ingredients that are finding their way into the food we feed our companion animals. You know "garbage in, garbage out!"<br /><br />Now the issue here is not meat; it is about providing all the essential and non-essential amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) and vitamins and minerals that are bio-available to the particularly unique physiology of felids (cats). The quality, quantity, and availability of these nutrients can come from any source, and for those of us who are vegan, the best source is vegetable based.<br /><br />Tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of cats around the world live quite well on one of the several available vegan cat foods that are recognized as nutritionally complete. I personally have had 3 1/2 years of experience in feeding the Evolution kibble product that this review is addressing. It is a high quality product that is AAFCO certified as nutritionally complete for all life stages in cats. Not only is this product safe to feed your cat, but if you follow the recommended feeding procedures, you will find many benefits to both your cat's health and your wallet.<br /><br />If you desire more detailed information, I invite you to do a google search on vegan cats. I would put my web page information about this issue on this review, but it is against the policy for writing reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />Just for everyone's edification, I have researched this issue for well over 500 hours, read hundreds of technical papers, visited hundreds of web sites, and have made a commitment to specialize in feline nutrition as part of my Veterinary Technician studies. I probably know more about feline nutrition than 95% of all the vets in the world.<br /><br />My feline son is a vegan and will remain so because I am absolutely certain that his quality of life will be enhanced by his diet and that this choice will not be a detriment to his health.<br /><br />-------------------------------------<br /><br />Since writing this review in 2006 I have had a change in position about this particular product after 4 years of personal experience. The manufacturer of the Evolution foods was changing the formulation of the food on a regular basis and during that time I found that the Feline Kibble was not able to maintain the pH level in the urine of cats that was promised on the label and in their literature. At least that wasn't the case with my former feline son and my current feline son. As a result I can no longer recommend the use of Evolution Feline Kibble for male cats. Since urinary issues are different between male and female cats the Evolution Kibble MAY be satisfactory for feeding to female cats. Nutritionally the Evolution foods seem to be fine for nutrients but not necessarily adequate for maintaining the proper pH levels to avoid urinary issues for male cats.<br /><br />Consequently I am now recommending male cats use the Vegecat pH diet provided by Harbingers of a New Age. My son has been eating this food supplement in a specially prepared gluten formulation I created called a vegan feline roast. It is 62% protein, 33% fat, and 5% carbs and has a moisture content of about 60%. Almost a perfect combination of ingredients to mimic natural prey. My son finds this product to be very palatable and his urinary pH has been consistently at 6.4 for the three years that we have been producing and consuming this food. The drawback is that it takes about a half hour every 3 days to make the food and the cost is equivalent to a premium cat food. But on the other hand my son is trim, full of energy at 6 1/2 years, enjoys great health, no longer has urinary tract issues, and no other animal had to die in order to provide my son with life-giving nutrition.<br /><br />UPDATE:  4/17/11<br /><br />For those of you who are still considering feeding the Evolution kibble, please heed this warning.  Kibble is only 10% moisture content.  If you follow the directions given by the manufacturer to soak the kibble prior to feeding, you will end up with a mushy material that your cats may or may not like.  The danger in feeding the dry kibble is that your cat will eventually become so dehydrated that no amount of drinking will be sufficient to avoid hydration related illnesses.  Cats do not naturally drink water, they almost exclusively obtain all of their hydration from the food that they consume.  If they are eating something that only has 10% moisture, upon consumption the moisture that is contained within the digestive tract of the cat will be sucked into the food in order to give it enough fluidity to pass through the intestines.  This will often lead to gastro-intestinal diseases. Your cat will be constantly drinking water to make up for that deficiency, but no amount of drinking is enough to avoid the dehydration problem.  So please remember that the best source of moisture for your cat's health, comes from a wet food diet that is around 70% moisture.<br /><br />In October 2008 I wrote an article about vegan cats published in VegFamily magazine.  This information and more will help those who are interested in a vegan diet for cats understand more of the issues.<br /><br />UPDATE:  8/27/12<br /><br />My vegan feline son is now 8 years old and still maintains an extremely healthy life with absolutely no issues of any kind.  He has been using our Vegan Feline Roast product for the past 5 and 1/2 years and his lab tests indicate that his nutritional needs are being adequately met by his vegan diet.<br /><br />For those who are sceptical about a vegan diet for house cats, there is ample evidence that several vegan products are available to satisfy the nutritional needs of cats.  I am still not convinced that Evolution is a good product to feed based on my past history.  There are thousands of customers that seem to successfully feed the Evolution product; however, I believe that our Vegan Feline Roast Mix is a superior product that will yield far better results over the lifetime of feeding any house cat.  Our product is based on the Vegecat phi supplement offered by HOANA, which I have found to be an excellent product for hitting all of the missing nutritional elements that would otherwise come from meat.  The Vegecat product line has been successfully feeding thousands of cats over a 27 year period and we highly recommend the use of Vegecat for those people who wish to formulate their own vegan cat food.  The only difference between our food product and the HOANA vegecat product is that our product is a ready-to-make mix that has been specifically formulated for a high protein/high fat food that is easy to make and highly palatable to the vast majority of cats.<br /><br />I would caution people feeding the Evolution kibble to reconsider doing so.  The problem with kibble in general, not just the Evolution product, is the 10% moisture content of the food.  Cats that eat kibble exclusively will invariably become dehydrated and will not be able to consume enough water by drinking to avoid the condition.  Evolution kibble that is soaked with water prior to feeding, as recommended by the manufacturer, is an attempt to avoid this issue.  However, by soaking the product you will reduce the palatability quality to most cats and will make it harder for them to continue to want to eat the product.  This is a strategy to fix a problem that is inherent to the product itself.<br /><br />As time goes on, I become more convinced that using our Vegan Feline Roast product may in fact be a cure for diseases in cats like FLUTD and diabetes.  At some point in time I would like to perform a long term double blind scientifically significant study to support my empirical observations.  When my son started out 7 years ago eating Evolution kibble, he quickly developed a FLUTD condition, after 18 months of use, that cost $1500 at the vet to fix.  The last 5 1/2 years of eating nothing but our Vegan Feline Roast he has remained FLUTD free and maintains excellent health.  Just the savings alone from avoiding annual teeth cleaning has more than paid for itself in the use of our product.<br /><br />So my bottom line is to recommend not using Evolution Kibble in favor of either the HOANA vegecat supplement or our Vegan Feline Roast Mix.

So far she has been eating everything and has gotten better from her previous skin condition.<br /><br />I am wanting to feed her full time vegan but hear there can be issues with the PH balance of this food. I may try the vegecat brand next time. In any case it smells good and not foul like the meat based foods. It is something I would feel comfortable trying myself which I usually do for all my pets whom I feed vegan.

review/text: I thought garlic was bad for cats. I've read. It says it's bad for their tummys . But I'm looking for vegan cat food products because I'm switching to it so I think I want it for my cat.<br /><br />This cat food is made by the same company and looks really good; it's the one I'm buying. So don't go against the company because I think they are doing the right thing I'm just questioning the ingredient, however aside from that the product looked good, I'm just not sure>>>>>><br /><br />Gourmet Entree Moist Cat Food Half Case 12 Cans<br /><br />I'm going to try and buy this one. I looked up all the ingredients and it is all natural, including one compound for feline health (Taurine).. otherwise Filtered Water Sufficient for processing, Peas, Potatoes, Brown Rice, Avocado, Carrots, Wheat Germ, Oat Groats, Dicalcium Phosphate, Soybean Oil, Brewers Dried Yeast . Looks awesome! I may have to eat some. Kidding! THere's also a compound in it that is given to dogs to lower their PH acidity in their urine. It looks ok though. But aside from that look at those ingredients... and vitamin E.

review/summary: Very good coffee but not my favorite bean blend.
review/text: This is the second coffee I've tried from Weaver's.  The first was the "Organic French Roast" which I prefer to this blend.  I guess I prefer a darker roast.  This "House Blend" is a medium-bodied coffee with citrusy hints; it was slightly bitter to my taste buds and not as full-flavored.  If French roast is not your style of coffee, this might be an excellent option.  It's still very good coffee but I'll probably order the French roast next time.<br /><br />There were no visible quakers; I have not found any quakers in the 4 Weaver's bags I've tried so far.  Quakers are underdeveloped coffee beans that make coffee taste awful.  They stick out because they do not roast/darken properly.  A good test of coffee beans is to empty the bag on a cookie sheet & see how many quakers you find. A few is "acceptable" but more than 10 is pretty bad in my opinion.<br /><br />I use the "pour over" method to brew coffee every day because I can get water to the ideal brewing temperature of 192F to 204 F. I use 2 tablespoons of coffee for every 6 ounces of cold, filtered water, a Melitta natural brown filter, manual drip coffee filter & brew directly into my stainless carafe. I heat the water to boiling, pour a few tablespoons over the grounds to saturate & plump up the beans, wait a minute & then flood the grounds with the rest of the water.<br /><br />I brew directly in to this carafe using this coffee cone (pour over method):<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BUDDTY">RSVP Manual Drip Coffee Filter Cone for Carafes or Thermos</a><br /><br />I use this grinder:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043095WW">Bodum Bistro Electric Burr Coffee Grinder, Black</a><br /><br />I use this water kettle to heat the water:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012S1V2A">Oster 5965 Stainless-Steel 1-1/2-Liter Electric Water Kettle</a><br /><br />I use these coffee filters:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CFLIL">Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 6, 40-Count Filters (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Makes every sandwich + burger taste better
review/text: On a trip to Paris we visited the Maille store.  They have hundreds (or more?) of different flavors of Dijon mustard.  We selected a few in the smaller bottles and 2 or 3 "poivre vert" in the normal size.  All were wonderful but we quickly realized just how lucky it was that we brought home so many of the poivre vert - Dijon with green peppercorn.<br /><br />It's difficult to explain why - except as a base for my families favorite salad dressing, I'm not a big fan of plain Dijon mustard - but this combo makes an amazing mustard.<br /><br />At first we used it on turkey burgers.  We rarely eat beef and until we found this mustard, felt as though we were sacrificing every time we had a turkey burger.  Now it is one of our most favorite foods.  Combined with a slice of red onion, the green peppercorn mustard just makes the burger something unbelievably tasty!<br /><br />We could not find any way to buy the Maille Poivre Vert mustard here in the States so when our Son and Daughter-in-law travelled to Paris we asked (begged) them to find the store and bring some home, which they did and we savored every drop.<br /><br />This past Summer they visited France again only this time they brought back a bottle of Edmond Fallot 'moutarde au poivre vert' along with some of the Maille.<br /><br />They told us they picked this up in the Dijon region of France (or town?) and fully expected we would like it better.<br /><br />It is at least as wonderful as the Maille.  We may not have a palate sophisticated enough to discern a difference between the two but THIS one is available (placing my first order today via Amazon) here in the US.<br /><br />I am sure EVERYONE who enjoys a sandwich or a burger will love what this mustard adds to the flavor.  It's even great added to cheese and crackers!

review/text: I think these soups are great.  If you're not used to 'no salt added' foods, then you'll find it bland.  But once you have a bowls of this soup, regular soup with it's 2,000 mg of sodium will taste like ocean water.  You can actually taste the flavor of the beans and herbs rather than just being saturated with salt.  The minestrone is my favorite of these soups and the potato/leek my least favorite.  I'd rate the lentil as my second favorite.

review/text: I might be a bit partial in my judgment of the taste of this soup, because I have made it homemade before. I didn't care for the flavor of the soup. Even after adding a little sea salt it still did not have the right flavor. It had what seemed to be an almost tomato soup flavor. I particularly did not care for it, but everyone has different taste buds. This is just my opinion.

review/summary: Our beagle dog loves this dog food
review/text: After our dog turned one and was off of puppy food we started noticing that whenever he ate he would throw up.  We tried all kinds of dog foods but nothing would help.  We finally took our dog to the vet and he was diagnosed with pancreatitis.  Our vet put he on Hill Prescription Diet dog food and it was around $50 a bag for this dog food.  After paying for this expensive food for several months I decided to give Fit & Trim a try & my dog can eat it and not vomit it back up.  He hasn't lost any weight, but maintained his current weight and he can eat without vomiting so that is what is important to us.  Our vet even said that this was a good option for our dog.

review/summary: Before plunking down hard earned cash on boutique oils try this
review/text: When it comes to olive oils I refuse to make compromises or cut corners, and have purchased many boutique oils over the years. While I will confess that if I were independently wealthy I would exclusively use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008IUUZO">Raineri - Unfiltered Italian Extra Virgin Olive Oil</a>, I happily settle for this great oil.<br /><br />Either I am going senile in my old age, since I am Italian-American and prefer this Spanish olive oil, or Badia is merely a well kept secret. I have tried some of the other higher end mainstream brands like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001FQV5C">Colavita Extra Virgin Olive Oil - 17oz. bottle</a>, which is usually a decent oilve oil, but keep coming back to this one. One of the main reasons is consistency. I have experienced bad batches of most of the other brands on the market, and the boutique ones are truly hit or miss in my experience. And that is why I am loyal to this brand: no surprises when I open a bottle, and I am never disappointed in the quality.<br /><br />If you are finicky about olive oil and have not tried this one, invest in a smaller bottle and give it a try. You may be as pleasantly surprised as I.

review/summary: Excellent! Do yourself a favor and try this great product.
review/text: I first tasted Swiss Familia Muesli in 1964 as a kid. I grew up on that cereal and really loved it. I had no idea that Familia made other cereals until I started shopping on Amazon. Then, after buying the Swisss Familia Muesli exclusively from Amazon for quite some time, one day they ran out of stock.<br /><br />Rather than go to my local health food store I noticed that they had the Familia Swiss Crunch with berries showing up in "other products available." I read the rave reviews and decided to try a 6-pack. The cereal arrived and both my wife and I have been hooked since.<br /><br />Unlike the Muesli, this cereal has a crunchy texture that stays crunchy in the bowl. The included berries offer a tasty accent. We usually add blueberries and sliced bananas to the bowl to make it extra special but that's a bonus. The cereal is delicious with or without added fruit because it comes with dried berries. It has a nutty flavor and crunchy texture that is unlike any cereal I've tried to date. I'm so hooked on the Swiss Crunch I really have no interest in any other cereal.<br /><br />Highly recommended! Definitely a must try. And Amazon is the best place to buy it. Bon appetit.

review/summary: An Excellent and Healthy Choice for Anyone's Diet
review/text: A quality product from Bio-familia, a Swedish company that developed "Bircherm&uuml;esli" a product so popular and successful that made the name Muesli famous all over the world.<br /><br />If you need a high fiber and protein snack option for your diet, this is absolutely a very good product. You can't go wrong and the best of all: excellent taste and quality, and for a pack of five this comes at a good value. The Strawberries and Rasberries included in this version of the cereal at Anti-oxidants to the mixture, making a good product even better.<br /><br />Sometimes your diet will require you eat frequently and consciously, and in those cases you need to have a snack at hand when you get hungry, in order to keep your metabolism high all day long. In such cases finding a good and balance option could be hard. I love this 5-pack and I always have one at home an another pack at the office. I try to eat five or more times a day, so in my case having a healthy snack at hand wherever I am when I get hungry is a priority.<br /><br />Since you are checking this product I have to guess that you are probably a person that cares about what you eat, either because you are interested in losing weight, getting in better shape or just be healthier and keep in good shape, so I will share my own experience in the weight loss game and staying in shape game<br /><br />My own successful personal experience in weight loss is based on strategies to boost metabolism. Don't stress yourself, eat frequently, eat just what you need each time, and choose wisely what you are going to eat, supplement your diet. Yet simple and it works. I loss more than 200 lbs and shrink my waist (from 44 to 32), and I have been able to keep in good shape since then. Every single aspect of my life has improved since then.<br /><br />Keep in mind that a good diet is just part of the equation, you also need a plan that helps you keep on track and monitor your condition. Based on my own personal experience I can recommend some tools that you may want to consider, to establish your own strategies for boosting your metabolism, loosing weight, and even more important keeping that weight off. They are:<br /><br />- "Ultrametabolism: The Simple Plan for Automatic Weight Loss" by Mark Hyman. A practical an realistic plan for weigh loss.<br /><br />- "The ABS Diet", which is another very practical, readable, insightful, and inspirational book, that also includes an exercise plan.<br /><br />- A Body Fat Monitor or Scale. This will help you monitor your progress, to assure that the weight you are loosing is fat (fat lost = increased metabolism) and not muscle, water or bone mass (decreased metabolism).<br /><br />- A Heart Rate Monitor Wrist Watch. This is an excellent tool that will help you monitor and control your Heart Rate in order to keep yourself in a burning fat state (increased metabolism).<br /><br />- "Heart Monitor Training for the Complete Idiot", a primer on the use of Heart Rate Monitors for health improvement or weight control.<br /><br />If you want to star focusing only on your diet, the first two may be worth considering. If you exercise, or want to start doing it right, the last threee are for you. If you do both, all the recommended options can improve your results.<br /><br />I am 39 years old, With the help of the tools I just mentioned not only I went fro size 44 to size 32 pants, but also obtained substantial benefits that included weight control, cardiovascular improvements, lowered blood pressure, and improved muscular-skeletal strength and flexibility, but also the myriad of mental and psychological benefits derived from being in the best shape of my life.

review/summary: The cat, the dog, nor the grackles would touch it
review/text: I bought a can of this for the novelty of seeing how my cat would react to a can of cat food that cost almost a buck fifty.  He's normally not a picky eater and routinely eats canned Friskies or 9-Lives.  I opened the can and placed the contents into a clean feeding bowl and presented it to him in his normal feeding place on the counter (up away from the dog).  He took a sniff and recoiled from it.  I then offered him a can of his regular food that he happily ate.  Well, that didn't go well.  So I then offered it to our Lab/Golden mix, a dog that loves nothing more than snapping up the cat's food if it is left within her reach.  One sniff and she jerked her head back from it and walked away.  Next step was to fling it out into the back yard where the grackles (an omnivorous bird common to South Texas) scavenge for moldy bread, pizza bones, stale chips and pretty much anything else we toss out.  Nope, the grackles wouldn't touch it either.  But the fire ants love it.  They are all over it and within a few days it will be gone.

review/summary: Nasty Stuff
review/text: This stuff is pretty nasty. I live in a household with two cats. I supplement their diets with wet food and thought I'd make the change to a organic brand.<br /><br />First of all, this stuff turned my stomach upon opening it. It smells disgusting, like something died in the can. The consistency was gross too. This stuff was sloppy and fibrous. It looked like spoiled tuna salad and smelt even worse. I thought it had possibly gone bad but the date on the can indicates that it's still quite good and nowhere near the expiration date.<br /><br />I really shouldn't have given this to my cat but I gave him a portion of it (not the whole can) to see how he took to it. He actually did eat it very happily, gluttonously in fact... But he was ill after and the remnants of this come up all over the kitchen floor. That's the first time I've ever had this happen when sampling a new food.<br /><br />I think I'm going to stick to my usual brand. This stuff was not worth it! I am very disappointed and quite disgusted.

review/summary: None of the five cats will eat it
review/text: I looked closley to see what the stars meant with one meaning "I hate it." I. personally, do not eat it, but none of my 6 kitties,including 2 ferals (last time I wrote, I had only one feral, but now have two and neither feral will eat this. They may be wild and not let a human close to them, but they know their cat food tastes. Two stars means "I don't like it, and since I am the one doing the buying, I figure it is OK if I state that that "I don'tlike it" because I do not like buying something that the 6 cats that I feed will not eat it. I feed the ferals outside the back door and I can watch them "eat or not eat" by watching through the window. My kitties always announce the arrival of the ferals by jumping up and down at the window when my regular "orange and white kitty" and my "sometimes I deign to eat here 'black and white Kitty'" arrive for dinner! My, My, What an exciting life I have!!!...The high point of my evening being watching the ferals eat and then writing a review of their eating habits up on Amazon!<br />Anyway, I have made it clear as to how I keep tabs of the ferals and their eating habits. The inside kitties are pretty easy to manage. When trying a new variety of food (new to us) I just put that bowl in the kitchen where "the special eating" bowls go. Dry food and water are in the kitchen and whatever "speciality of the evening" is also located there. No, they do not get a new flavor every night! But one bowl goes there so they always go "aLookin" in the kitchen area for their night's extra bowl of wet food! Spoiled???  Yes!!!! Then I know if it is eaten or not. The specialty bowl gets 3 nights of trial...not in a row...to avoid "nose sticker uppers." But kitties know a wet bowl is always placed alongside the water and the dry in the kitchen. Water and dry are also located elsewhere, but the kitchen ONLY gets the wet nightly special got trial/accuracy purposes. Nothing is TOO much for the trial and accuracy information for Amazon!<br />It has been 3 weeks now with the Newman Chicken and Brown Rice. There is no question. None of my cats eat it. Not even the birds seem to care for it...or any other animal...as the birds generally eat the dried out left overs and if the bowl is chewed to death, it means a coyote has been by, but I haven't had any coyotes all winter.(Somebody is putting out vittles more to their liking somewhere else, or they have gone further south this winter.<br />So, there, my friends, is how I ended up at this choice of stars for Chicken and Brown Rice Rice Formula Newman's Own. Oddly enough, everyone likes the beef and brown rice:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BXT278">Newman's Own Organics Adult Variety Pack Canned Cat Food</a>, but that is a whole "nother" story for a different time.<br />Sorry that we have a disappointing story to tell: Gabby, Trinity, Wisdom, Mercy, Orange and White Kitty and Black and White Kitty...as told to and documented by "Cindy O". Bye for now on the cat food trail tale until we "come upon" something else good ole mom thinks should be tried.

review/summary: took a gamble on this product.. and lost....
review/text: i was wondering why it was so much cheaper than the other flavors... now I know... my cat wouldnt touch it. He acted like it stunk and backed away.<br />he then went over to eat his day old dried cat food rather than eat this junk.<br />Im concerned that someone wrote it might be tainted and be recalled later. well ill save it in case it does get recalled-maybe then i can get a refund. i dont like how amazon wont let you return food items(unless recalled), especially when they are just unopened cans.<br /><br />alot of people gave it good ratings but alot of people didnt.. I think if you only have one cat like me, the odds are bad... and you shouldnt buy it.

review/summary: Dented cans, stinky food
review/text: Most of the cans were dented even though they were in the original case - makes me wonder if they were repackaged. The food is pretty stinky - the dog wouldn't eat it, and she loves cat food. However the cats scarfed it right down.

review/summary: Multi Cat Family - All Of Them Love Newman's Own Pet Food
review/text: We switched to Newman's Own dry and wet food several years ago. We have noticed a huge difference in our pets. Yes, we have cats and dogs all who are rescues. Because of their early history, many have health issues. Since switching them to Newman's Own most have leveled out and we spend less time at the Vet. The food cost less in the long run, because of better health for your animals. We also noticed that all of our animals love this product. Some of them like the dry better than the wet and vis-versa. Some of ours where picky eaters and needed to gain weight. Not anymore, they all show up for dinner eager and ready to eat.<br />My brother-in-law has a 14 year old Siamese who was on Science Diet Food for diabetes. He looked like he was on his last leg, the cat not my brother-in-law. Anyway, we started supplementing his food with Newman's Own and I swear the cat looks 2 years younger. He is more active, his eyes have cleared up, and he has lost weight. The vet is amazed as well, as his sugar levels are better. I am not suggesting anyone use this food as a replacement for what a Vet has suggested. But if you have an animal who is not responding well, it is worth a try to add this product to their diet.

review/summary: Cat loves the flavor
review/text: Kitty loves it! Happily eats 1/2 can in one setting (13.5 lbs cat), 2-3 times a day. His fur does look fluffier after 2 months on this food and he seems more content and alert. Wet food does make him urinate more (he used to get a dry/wet mix of Urinary SO prescription diet), but I am glad, because this should help to keep his urinary tract healthy.<br /><br />I researched various options before settling on this one. Among other brands (wet food only), he wouldn't even touch "Organix;" he likes "Evo" fine, but not as much as Newman's own and leaves one-third of food uneatten in the bowl. As far as other flavors of Newman's own, he didn't like the Brown rice flavor (too much rice--the cat kept picking out individual grains out of his food one by one), and strangely, after eating a few cans of store-bought Chicken&Salmon flavor, he refused to eat the same flavor from Amazon.

review/summary: Excellent product... until Amazon ships it!
review/text: I want to start  by saying that if I was reviewing the food alone, it would get 5 stars easily.  It's a quality product and my picky eater cat (as in, he would literally rather go hungry for days on end than be coaxed into eating something he doesn't like) loves it.<br /><br />Having said that, I won't buy this (or any other canned product for that matter) from Amazon.com anymore, unless they were to significantly change their packaging method. Normally I only review a product all on its own because other factors are incidental, but this time it seemed fitting to comment on shipping too because it drastically affected the overall quality of the product and is an unavoidable part of getting it to any customer.<br /><br />The product arrives in a small cardboard flat with 2 layers of 12 cans each, then the whole thing is shrink-wrapped in plastic.  Then they put it in a shipping box and put 3 air pillows on top.  Exactly 1/2 of the cans arrived dented (the entire bottom tier of the flat), many of them so badly that it looked like they had been run over by a car.<br /><br />Amazon.com customer service is great and responsive - they shipped the replacement out with complimentary next-day shipping... and it arrived in exactly the same condition.  In the end, I got everything I paid for, but 1. do I want to go through this every time I order it? No.  And 2. it's hugely wasteful because of course the dented cans are unusable because the seal could be compromised, offering the perfect breeding ground for botulism.<br /><br />I can fairly say that this is typcial for canned products in general from Amazon, too.  I've gotten black beans, kidney beans, chick peas, tomato sauce, and tomato paste from them, and there wasn't one order among them that didn't have the same problem.  Again, customer service was great and sent quick replacements (again with a high damage rate), but it's not worth the hassle and waste.  If it ever occurs to them to pad the entire order and not just the top of it, I'll return to using them because the free shipping and convenience of subscription auto-order (and subsequent additional savings) really are nice.

review/summary: Happy whiskers and two paws way up!
review/text: *Note to Amazon.com,<br /><br />Pretty please put this Liver on Subscribe and Save! You have the beef & liver and the beef available for S&S but not the Liver yet. THANK YOU SO MUCH!<br /><br />Now on to my review...<br /><br />My cat has been slowly switching to Newman's own beef products over from Wellness brand cat food (which is a great brand and will still be reserved for treats occasionally). I was ecstatic that there was a totally NO grain-and-NO fillers ORGANIC cat food I could feed my 9 year old cat who is prone to crystal formation in his bladder and also plaque build up on his teeth (even though I brush his outer teeth every evening).<br /><br />So far I've tried the beef & Liver and the Liver and he LOVES it. I just ordered the beef today for him which I'm sure he'll love too.<br /><br />This product *IS* very thick and concentrated (the beef liver alone has the consistency of a concentrated pate' and the beef & liver has the consistency of a gelatinous, thick beefy oatmeal), so I scoop it into his bowl and blend a bit of hot water to the product to warm the fats and make more of a 'gravy' for him (he also prefers to eat his food a bit warm anyhow). He barely wants to nibble at his Wellness brand cat food now (which I've had him on for over four years, so I guess that means he's one 'sold' cat. It might be unusual for a cat to love beef so much but my cat goes crazy for beef (especially if I make him steak when I can afford to). So, for me to find him a organic, no grain, beef based line of cat food made his day (and one of his nine lives no doubt)!<br /><br />Anyway, if you know your cat already loves beef and beef liver then he/she will probably be just peachy keen with this product.<br /><br />Here is the ingredients list for Newman's own canned beef cat products:<br /><br />Beef:<br /><br />Organic Beef, Organic Beef Broth, Minerals (Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Carbonate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Iodate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin A, E, E, D3, B12 and K Supplements, Choline, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Biotin).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein..................12.0% (min)<br />Crude Fat.........................4.5% (min)<br />Crude Fiber......................1.0% (max)<br />Moisture.........................82.0% (max)<br />Ash.................................1.0% (max)<br />Magnesium.....................0.02% (max)<br />Taurine..........................0.07% (min)<br /><br />CALORIC VALUE:<br /><br />As fed (Kcal/3oz can)...........156<br /><br />Liver:<br /><br />Organic Beef Liver, Organic Liver Broth, Minerals (Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Carbonate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Iodate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin A, E, E, D3, B12 and K Supplements, Choline, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Biotin).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein..................11.0% (min)<br />Crude Fat.........................2.5% (min)<br />Crude Fiber......................1.0% (max)<br />Moisture.........................83.0% (max)<br />Ash.................................1.5% (max)<br />Magnesium.....................0.02% (max)<br />Taurine..........................0.07% (min)<br /><br />CALORIC VALUE:<br /><br />As fed (Kcal/12oz can)...........129<br /><br />Beef & Liver:<br /><br />Organic Beef, Organic Beef Liver, Organic Beef Broth, Minerals (Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Carbonate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Iodate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin A, E, E, D3, B12 and K Supplements, Choline, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Biotin).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein..................10.0% (min)<br />Crude Fat.........................3.0% (min)<br />Crude Fiber......................1.0% (max)<br />Moisture.........................82.0% (max)<br />Ash.................................1.0% (max)<br />Magnesium.....................0.02% (max)<br />Taurine..........................0.07% (min)<br /><br />CALORIC VALUE:<br /><br />As fed (Kcal/12oz can)...........140<br /><br />Here's to Kitty's health!

review/summary: Fine Food for Diverse Cats
review/text: I have two special needs cats.  One is very small and could stand to gain weight.  The other is too large and needs to loose weight.<br /><br />The smaller cat likes this food. The overweight cat does not over eat on the food, which is a plus for us.<br /><br />We tried Wellness, C&P Organix, Innova Evo (they loved the dry food), Pet Promise, the Whole Foods brand and a few others.  Our cats did not like those brands of food.  Some they wouldn't even eat.<br /><br />They prefer the chicken and salmon brand to the other Newman's Own canned cat food flavors.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Organic<br />* Peace of mind for the cat owner<br />* Liked by cats with 'special needs'<br />* Preferred over other brands by two very different cats<br />* When I open some canned cat foods, the smell nauseates me. The smell of this brand doesn't have the same effect.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* None that I can think of<br /><br />Bottom line:  This is a good organic canned cat food.  Cats differ in their food preferences.  It's a good idea to give this one a try.  By the way, for a while, one or more of the flavors were only available in the smaller cans.  If that is still the case, you may want to try those flavors as well.

review/summary: "Best Canned Cat Food", says cat.  :)
review/text: This is the only food my cat will eat.  She is very picky.  Since eating this better, organic food exclusively, she has had much better health.  (She is quite an old cat.)  For some reason the "Turkey Formula" flavor is her favorite.  If I try out a different food, she runs up and down the hallway yelling, until I give her "Newman's Own" canned (turkey flavor) food again.  (I never try out new foods with her anymore.)  :)  Must be good stuff!  BTW:  I also add in fresh organic greens and green powders for her too.  She loves it!

review/summary: Newman makes nutritious pet food
review/text: It is sad to see people rating on a pet food product based on whether or not their pet likes the taste, but not based on the ingredient of the good. When their cat doesn't eat, they give one star. When their cat loves to eat, regardless of the nutrition of the food, they give 5 stars. It is unfair to the manufacturer. Unfortunately, this seems like the trend of pet food rating.<br /><br />Newman always make good healthy and nutritious pet food. They contains no corn gluten, animal by-products, etc that will be harmful to cats. Yes, they are pricey because they are organic. Once a while Amazon runs a promotion on Newman's Organic cat food, and it will be the good timing to stock them up.

When she stopped eating her usual special-formula food, I tried about 10 different kinds of catfood, and this was the only one she liked.  It is easy on her digestion and doesn't interfere with her diabetes. Thank you, Newman's Own!!
