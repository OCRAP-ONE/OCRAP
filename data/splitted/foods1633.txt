review/summary: Great if you like Wintergreen
review/text: Although I do not care for this tea much, I still give it four stars. That is because it is the only tea I can force down that has wintergreen in it. I often buy teas that are a mixture of green and/or white tea with spearmint and/or peppermint. It was my fault I did not read the description carefully, as I did not realize it had wintergreen in it until I tasted it. You can definitely taste the wintergreen!<br />My favorite Stash teas are the White Christmas, (white tea, peppermint, & ginger), and the Moroccan Mint, (green tea, spearmint, lemongrass, & peppermint). I do the White Christmas if I want something a bit spicier and more warming, and I do the Moroccan mint when I want something a little smoother. Due to the lemongrass it does taste a bit grassy, but it's still good.<br /><br />If you want a good mint tea without green, try the Cascade mint. It just has peppermint and spearmint, and is absolutely delicious! I mix that with decaf green in the evenings and it's wonderful! Unfortunately, I have not found the Cascade mint in boxes of 100, so I usually stick with one of the other varieties mentioned above.<br />Bottom line, I have come to love most of the Stash tea flavors that contain mint, with the exception of the Merry Mint. Like I said though, I can kindof get it down, which is more than I can say about other teas with wintergreen in them. And these boxes of 100 are such a great value, as I drink several cups per day!

review/summary: So excited for this!!
review/text: I am poor but love earl grey tea and of all the types of earl grey this one is by far my favorite not only because of price but because of flavor.<br /><br />I always end up buying this at the grocery store whenever I can. Since coffee makes me feel ill and energy drinks are costly black tea is my primary source of daily caffeine. Getting one measly 30-pack of this tea lasts me a very short time. I practically jumped for joy when I found this was available not only in bulk, but I can subscribe for a regular shipment every 3 months! Lets hope it lasts more than 3 months!

review/summary: I love this tea!!
review/text: Last Christmas, my wife gave me a selection of Earl Grey teas.  I do not drink coffee, but I love my Earl Grey tea.<br /><br />I found the Stash tea to be the best tasting, the reason for me is the double Bergamot oil that makes Earl Grey Earl Grey.<br /><br />When you open up a tea bag, the scent is amazing.  I love doing that in a crowd to see everybody smell this amazing scent and ask me what that is.<br /><br />Our local supermarket had a box of 25 teabags for $8.99.  Thanks to the automatic ordering process that Amazon has, I only pay $11.99 for a box of 100 bags!!<br /><br />I feel like a pusher at work, when I go down to get the hotwater.  I give out a teabag or 2 and send the link to the product here at Amazon<br /><br />This is great tea, and a great buy!

Of course, the big cardboard box it arrives in isn't all that aesthetically pleasing, but if you drink a lot of tea it works out to be much less expensive than buying the 20-bag packages at the grocery store.

review/summary: Knew I liked the product, got what I expected
review/text: I wouldn't have ordered 100 of these teabags without trying them first, so I grabbed the smaller size box at my local grocery store. I'd been trying to drink more green tea and realizing my generous cubicle neighbor probably wanted to encourage my new habit, but not necessarily fund it by continuing to "donate" bags to me. I really liked the STASH green tea, so before my small box was up, I ordered this one. It is a delicious green tea to me, but as with many green teas, FINISH IT WHILE IT'S HOT. Seriously - if it cools down, it gets bitter. I thought the value of this box was excellent since I'm up to 1-3 cups per day, so this worked well. I posted a few pics of how the packaging came so you can see - no "retail" boxes, but they are each individually wrapped. Note that it just came in a cardboard box and the little packs inside weren't lined in a plastic bag, so if you have this delivered, just make sure it stays dry. I think a rainy day on my doorstep could have been messy, though I do think the tea bags are foil lined enough to prevent moisture from entering? Still, I wouldn't want to risk it! I've already added this to my Wish List entitled "re-stock items" :)

review/summary: Now This Is Good Tea
review/text: My first box of Stash Decaf Green Tea arrived about 15 mins ago and I'm sitting here enjoying my very first cup.  This is a really good cup of decaf green tea!!!!  I used water that had not quite starting boiling so as not to burn the tender tea.  Steeped it for 2 mins and added some Ambrosia raw unfiltered honey.  I bought both products via Amazon's "Subscribe And Save" so I saved an additional few dollars off their already low price.  Any subscribe and save purchase comes with free shipping even if the total order is less than $25.  Amazing savings and fantastic taste.  Sorry if I seem like an advertisement but I'm really excited.  Tea is sooo expensive in the grocery store so I saved a bundle and I'm drinking some of the best decaf green tea I've had in a while. Extremely smooth with no bitter after taste.

I got mango/passion fruit this time.<br />I just drop it in a mug O' room temp water, and keep topping it off as I drink it. It is naturally sweet enough for me- un adulterated.

review/summary: Bitter and Astringent
review/text: I love most of Stash's green teas.  LOVE them.  Most of them are grassy and flavorful but lack the bitterness of many other brands of green.<br /><br />This is the exception.  Blech!  It is incredibly astringent, something even more common in Jasmine greens than in a straight green.  I recommend trying it from a grocery store before committing to a large Amazon purchase unless you happen to like bitter tea.  That sounds absurd to me, but I do have friends who prefer their tea with a bitter bite.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002P9D3GC">Yamamotoyama Jasmine Tea Bag</a> (which stash also sells, but I couldn't find it here) is flavorful but retains the mild, non-bitter green flavor I've come to know and love.

review/summary: Subtle, Delicate, Delicious
review/text: I *loved* this tea.  I am mostly alone in my love:  many of my friends and guests prefer stronger teas, and the flavor of this is anything but.  Even if you stack multiple bags in a single brew, you're going to end up with a subtle flavor.  That's most good white teas for you.  "Strong" white teas exist even though the phrase is something of a contradiction in terms, but they exist by layering on a lot of flavor that doesn't come from the tea leaf itself.  Those remind me of herbal teas even though they've thrown in a white tea base.  In this tea, the lemon flavor is as subtle as the white so that you can taste both.  I think it's heaven.<br /><br />This tea is more forgiving of an overly long steep than most white teas, but it's still a white tea and will go bitter if steeped too long.<br /><br />I find I dislike it as an iced tea and even once it reaches room temperature.  The oils separate out and form a film on top with trapped tea dust.  It won't hurt you, but it's very off-putting.<br /><br />To enjoy a cooler beverage, I put a teabag or two directly into room temperature or cold water.  It lends a little flavor to the water without giving up a film of yuck to float on top.  I love doing this with any good green tea, and just a very few whites.  It adds a subtle yum, like a delicate natural flavored water.<br /><br />Alas, this has lemon grass in it.  This is good news for most people:  lemon grass is delicious!  It's also a grass, though.  If you have wheat or grass allergies, discuss lemongrass with your allergist and pay attention to how you feel on days you consume it.  I like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D4IVGU">Stash Premium Decaf White Raspberry Tea, Tea Bags, 100-Count Box</a> just as much as I like this, so I've switched over to avoid that little extra bit of stuffiness from consuming a grass product.

review/summary: Good intro deck for casual user
review/text: I mainly collect tarot decks for the artwork and seeing some of the online images from this deck made me want to get one, even though it is out of print.The artwork is nice, although slightly disappointing in some aspects.<br /><br />First, the backs of the cards are in black & white, which is sad because they are nicely illustated with images used in the faces of the cards. I suspect that the artwork for the back of the deck was originally done in color but  printed in black & white to save money on the color printing costs.<br /><br />Second, some of the cards look like the artwork was pieced together from different sources. Mostly, this was done pretty well to achieve a good-looking image on a card, but there are flaws. In some cases, details were overlooked, such as the draping of the sleeves on the Queen of Pentacles -- they were apparently drawn for a different throne than the one she's sitting on.<br /><br />Third, it looks like a number of the cards were designed with little or no knowledge of the traditional meanings behind them. My biggest issue is that one female face with a sad expression was apparently recycled through the deck. For some cards, it's not an issue, but the Queen of Swords looks like she's going to burst into tears. Strength suffers from the same problem of a sad expression, plus being confounded by an aggressive warrior stance on top of a lion that looks like it's being tickled, resulting in an emotionaly disjointed image. The King of Pentacles should probably change places with the King of Wands. The Pages and Knights were done right, in my opinion, and better express their role in their suit compared to the other court cards.<br /><br />My last artistic quibble is that the Major Arcana lacks cohesion in imagery. For example, the Fool is a typical medieval European court Jester, and he's followed by three clearly ancient Egyptian figures in the High Priestess, Emperor and Empress; then it's back to a medieval European Heirophant.<br /><br />I really like the vivid colors, the gorgeous card borders and that most of the artwork looks more hand-drawn than computer generated. (The numbered cards of the Minor Arcana are only pips, and obviously computer-drawn over the same background as the Pages.) This deck could have been so much better, but it's not suprising that there are flaws, since the publisher seems to do a lot of business in putting together kits and boxed sets for a wide range of areas. From the publisher's standpoint, getting a kit product out probably took precedent.<br /><br />For those that do readings, I have some additional comments, in case you are looking to find and purchase this deck. The cards are kind of large for small hands (I have smaller hands) to shuffle, but it's doable. Traditional Rider-Waite symbols are largely absent. The little hard-bound book that goes with the deck contains brief meanings, with upright and reversals for the Major Arcana, upright meanings only for the Minor Aracana. Some of the more typically negative or troubling meanings seem to have been toned way down or even radically changed, and I'm guessing that this kit was meant for an audience that had no previous knowledge of Tarot. Likewise, even the typically "scary" cards don't seem that scary. There is some nudity in the deck (an issue for some), but nothing frontal, and all but one discreet female breast covered with something. Many of the female figures are of the busty type and those with clothing seem to be scantily dressed or are wearing something close-fitting. I guess this, along with the strong colors, makes me think that this deck might be good for readings done for/with the husband or boyfriend, who doesn't know anything about Tarot, who got dragged along to a reading by his wife/girlfriend.<br /><br />Overall, it's a nice deck, but it seems that it was aimed at a market that doesn't know Tarot and probably doesn't have more than a passing interest in it. Like entertainment at a dinner party or something similar. After that, experienced Tarot readers who've memorized the meanings of the cards might find this deck useful for clients who would be put off by darker or more frightening images in other decks.

In the past I have found green tea to be a little bland.  This tea has a little more flavor than most teas, and therefore is more like the standard black tea that most of us of accustomed to.<br /><br />I would also suggest the Earl Grey and Irish Breakfast green teas for the same reason, more flavor.  Try making a pitcher of tea with half green tea and half black tea.  My husband (a green tea hater) will even drink tea prepared in that half and half manner without complaint.<br /><br />I highly recommend this tea for those that are looking for a green tea with more flavor.

review/summary: A Rich Flower Garden in Bloom.
review/text: A Ming Dynasty (AD 1368 - 1644) creation believed to lower cholesterol and promote longevity, jasmine tea consists of Chinese green tea leaves - usually green teas from Fujian province, which is also home to the semi-fermented Oolong and smoky Lapsang Souchong - scented with jasmine flowers. Traditionally, the flowers are harvested during the day and stored in a cool place until nightfall, when they develop their full fragrance. They are then layered over the tea leaves, which have previously been steamed or heated to prevent their oxidation. The tea's quality is determined both by the quality of the green tea used as its base and by the effectiveness of the scenting process. Brewed, it has a delicate, silvery color and a rich fragrance reminiscent of a flower garden in bloom.

Shake the heck out of it for 15-20 seconds, pour into a tall glass without ice (my preference), sometimes add half-and-half.<br /><br />Nifty tip: Brew with Fiji water and use my shaker method, and the iced coffee sets up just like a Guinness Stout.

review/summary: There should be more flavor and less stevia in it.
review/text: I needed to add something for a couple bucks to qualify for Super Saver Shipping, so I thought I'd give this a shot.<br />I didn't expect much, since I've yet to find a drink or mix with stevia that has it in the correct proportion. A stick of this in one 16.9oz bottle as recommended has a strong bad oversweetened aftertaste. I doubled the water and the sweetness was ok, but then the flavor was way too light. I'm going to use the rest of it to sweeten iced tea just to give it some flavor.<br /> I actually prefer stevia in my beverages.. it's all natural, good for your teeth, with no known side effects; Problem is, it is still so new, alot of drink manufacturers add too much of it to their products.. and this powder is no exception. Stevia is much sweeter than the usual sweeteners or sugar so it should be added in much lesser amounts.<br /><br />Pros:<br />*These use Stevia, and if you get the right combination of water with it this powder it could be a nice lightly flavored low calorie beverage for the price.<br /><br />CONS:<br />*Not good made according to the box mixing directions.<br />*There should be more flavor and less stevia in the formula.<br />*Only 10% vitamin C with too many other miscellaneous ingredients. (Maltodextrin? Calcium Sillicate? Tricalcium Phosphate? Really? Why??)<br /><br />Summary: Wouldn't go out of my way to get this in particular again. There are better naturally sweetened drinks out there with way more vitamins.

review/summary: Decent flavor, not very sweet
review/text: Unlike the other reviewer, I thought the flavor was okay but it lacked sweetness. I'd read about stevia not dissolving well in cold water, so I ran some warm water into an empty flavored-water bottle, added the mix, shook well, and then filled with ice cubes and cold water. The result was stronger than a flavored water, but not quite as strong as a kool-aid-type flavoring mix. The real disappointment was that I didn't taste any sweetness at all, it was just like drinking unsweetened Kool-Aid after forgetting to add sugar! I haven't tried adding something else, like maybe a different form of stevia that does taste sweet to me.<br /><br />When reading any review, remember that people "taste" sweetness differently. Some people don't really taste stevia (or sucralose) as sweet, while others find it *too* sweet. So both the other reviewer and I are accurately reporting our experiences, and you will need to find out how any particular product tastes to *you*.

review/summary: DISAPPOINTED ***UPDATED***
review/text: ***UPDATE #2***<br />It seems that Amoretti has made a new flavor: Amoretti Premium Pumpkin PIE Syrup<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0099AUJBW">Amoretti Premium Pumpkin Pie Syrup (750mL)</a><br />I haven't tried it but the reviews look promising. Read closely regarding sugar content if the taste is not initially to your liking.<br /><br />***UPDATE #1****<br />I still think that this syrup does not have any pumpkin flavor and it tastes exactly like cinnamon red hot candies but the customer service I received was the best I have experienced.  Within an hour of posting my review, I received a call from one of the owners of the company.  He apologized for my disappointment and offered to replace my product with another.  When I finally spoke to him several days later, I had received some other syrups that I must say, exceeded my expectations.<br />I was never into vanilla, caramel or hazelnut flavors before but I didn't realize why.  Comparing these flavors to the others I have tried in the past (namely, Torani) the Amoretti syrups tasted "real" and not like a chemical.  What is unique about their flavors is they are not overly sweet but they are full of flavor. I know I am not writing a review for the other flavors so I still hold my opinion that the pumpkin spice has no pumpkin flavor (I suggested to Paul on the phone that he consider changing the name to SPICE and leave out PUMPKIN entirely) however I must say that I was pleasantly surprised at how good the other flavors are.  So much so, that I brought my opened bottles of Torani to work to leave in the breakroom.<br />I am still hoping that Amoretti makes a pumpkin pie sauce syrup and if so, I will be first in line to buy it.<br />As for my other comments about the packaging, the new products I received were sealed with a plastic sleeve around the caps and the cap seals worked better too.  I still prefer a foil seal over the mouth of the bottle but seeing a change in the packaging so quickly based on customer comments was impressive.<br />As for the Amoretti flavors I would strongly suggest....Amoretti Premium Crema di Caramel Syrup, Amoretti Premium Crema di Vanilla Syrup and Amoretti Premium Hazelnut Syrup. I have never had creme syrups before and these are delicious.  I used the caramel and vanilla creme syrups over pumpkin and apple pies so they double as a dessert sauce too.  I have never been into flavored coffees before (with the exception of trying to recreate Starbuck's Pumpkin Spice Latte) and now I find myself having a flavored latte every morning.  My next Amoretti syrups will be the chocolate creme and the orange cream.<br />As I told Paul on the phone, good customer service is lacking in this country and he has set the bar for excellent customer service; he could teach other companies how to treat their customers.  I probably would have thrown away the pumpkin spice syrup and never tried another Amoretti product again, but now I am a loyal customer.<br />Conclusion:  Even though I did not like the Pumpkin Spice syrup, I do not feel like I wasted my money because the company made it right and replaced it with other flavors that I love.<br />Amoretti...please consider making a true pumpkin pie creme sauce (and perhaps a white mocha creme sauce) and I will never buy another brand or need to go to Starbucks again.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z86XZY">Amoretti Premium Crema di Caramel Syrup (750mL)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z8E0WW">Amoretti Premium Crema di Vanilla Syrup (750mL)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z7X1F0">Amoretti Premium Hazelnut Syrup (750mL)</a><br /><br />***ORIGINAL REVIEW***<br />This tastes exactly like the red hot cinnamon candies and I ABHOR those candies.  It doesn't even taste like real cinnamon but just like spicy cinnamon candy.  So I am still searching for Pumpkin Syrup.<br />I find it interesting that one other review mentioned the open cap.  Mine arrived the same way and I was hesitant about using the product because the cap came right off without breaking the plastic seal around the cap and there was no inner seal on the bottle.  The only reason I did use it was because I heard a slight vacuum sound when it opened.  Perhaps it was a false sense of security that could be due to changes in shipping elevations because typically, syrup bottles are not vacuum sealed but the company should consider an inner foil bottle seal and not rely on the cap.

review/summary: Best Pumpkin syrup HANDS DOWN
review/text: Pumpkin Spice is my favorite flavor.  For many years I waited eagerly for fall to come so everyone would put out their pumpkin spice coffees and lattes etc. About 2 years ago I had enough of waiting for that short time they have the flavors I love the most "in season"  I have tried Torani Da Vinci and Monin and of those three Da Vinci  was the best. This year I saw Amoretti and since I was not 100% in love with the flavor of Da Vinci I decided to give it a shot.  It is amazing.  I don't know where people are getting off saying it has too much spice it is pumpkin SPICE syrup the spice is key and often gets covered by too much sugar in other syrups not in this one. I have already ordered more of this syrup AND their holiday pack directly from Amoretti and several other flavors for a gift basket for my parents since my mom loved the pumpkin spice syrup.

review/text: This is definitely a spicy syrup, and it is beyond delicious. For everyone complaining that this syrup is too spicy, take a look at your spice rack -- there IS a spice blend called 'Pumpkin Spice', used to flavor things like pumpkin pie. Hands down this is the most delicious syrup I have ever tasted! If you're finding that it is too spicy, perhaps you used too much. Amoretti syrups are highly concentrated and you only need a pump for your typical cup of coffee.

review/summary: All spice, no pumpkin
review/text: This tastes lovely in terms of spices, but there is absolutely no pumpkin to this. It isn't sweet, either. I currently am mixing this syrup with some sugar free vanilla I picked up today and that is making it better --- but still not what I expected. I would still be willing to try other flavors, though. Someone said it tastes like those red hot cinnamon candies; that seems very accurate, only not as intense.<br /><br />As mentioned in another review, mine didn't have any kind of seal on it other than the twist off cap, but it did sound sealed, so I suppose it is safe.<br /><br />Good thing? It came with a pump!<br /><br />I would say this is likely best used in tandem with either a basic sweetener/vanilla/pumpkin pie syrup because this by itself isn't what you're looking for.<br /><br />---<br /><br />EDIT 22 September 2012 --- upgrade from 2 to 4 stars<br /><br />As another reviewer mentioned, the next business day after I made this review I got a phone call from Paul, owner of Amoretti. We talked about their products, the syrups in particular of course. Apparently people either love or hate this one, not much in between. He made the point that none of the syrups are very sweet or sugary (which is what led me to buy this instead of pumpkin pie, worrying it would be too sweet) and don't even use artificial sweeteners. He asked if he could send me the pumpkin pie flavor and some other goodies, which I felt bad for accepting, but I am glad I did.<br /><br />He sent, overnight, three full size bottles of syrups (pumpkin pie, violet lavender, and crema di vanilla), a mini sampler of their three olive oils, and two samplers of martini mixes.<br /><br />Absolutely astounding customer service. Just ... I am still gobsmacked. If I could rate just the company from 1-5 stars, I'd give them a 20.<br /><br />I have used the pumpkin spice a few more times since I wrote the original review above and still am not a big fan of it, though I think I can definitely find some uses for it. It seems like it would be best not as a base flavoring, if that makes sense, but to use more like a quarter to half a pump at the very most to add just a touch more spice to a drink.<br /><br />ALL the syrups are quite concentrated, so that doesn't necessarily work in favor of a spice flavor, because you think oh, it needs more sweetness, I'll add more. Do NOT do that. It will make it taste terrible. Definitely stick with the reccommendations of how much to use in a hot or cold drink on the back of the bottle. Each pump of syrup has 4g of sugar so adding more syrup isn't going to help. That was, admittedly, a mistake I had made with the pumpkin spice.<br /><br />Also, for either the pumpkin pie or the pumpkin spice, consider getting the crema di vanilla and putting a quarter to half a pump in your drink. It's like putting the whipped cream on your pumpkin pie. Absolutely amazing.<br /><br />I may update this again if I can find a way to truly enjoy the pumpkin spice flavor, but everything else seems amazing and you cannot find better customer service anywhere. They really take your input into consideration and want feedback. This brand is definitely worth the money.<br /><br />Thank you, Paul. Never buying another brand, again.

review/summary: Pumpkin Spice, emphasis on the spice
review/text: I bought this syrup because my partner loves everything pumpkin. I thought I'd try it out to make pumpkin lattes and potentially use it to flavor other things.<br /><br />However, when tasted it, I was overwhelmed by cinnamon. I like cinnamon, but I felt the "spice" completely overpowered the pumpkin.<br /><br />Just in case the flavor would mellow when combined with food I tried it in a latte. The cinnamon still predominated and my drink had such a strong aftertaste I actually couldn't finish it. To be fair, I often find pre-flavored coffees to have an undesirable aftertaste as well, but I've had good luck with various syrups and additives... for instance, I can't stand Irish Creme flavored coffee, but I quite enjoy the occasional coffee with an actual shot of Irish Creme.<br /><br />I'm not saying the syrup is of bad quality, it's just that I feel it's important to let folks know exactly what they're in for.<br /><br />SUMMARY: I can't really taste the pumpkin over all the spice... very strong presence of cinnamon.

review/text: Lately I have found that good customer service is a trait lacking by most companies that I do business with. I had thought it would be no different when I didn't really enjoy the pumpkin spice syrup that I purchased from Amoretti. I am glad to say that I could not have been more wrong. I posted a comment earlier about how I didn't enjoy this syrup at all (although for some reason I cannot locate it on the feed now) I felt it was over spiced and cloying. Within an hour of my post I received a phone call from customer service offering to replace my bottle that I didn't enjoy with something that I might. In addition to a  replacement, the person I spoke with also stated that they would be sending out different samples of their products so that I might try them to see the quality of what they sell without having a repeat of the pumpkin spice. My 3 star ranking comes from not enjoying this specific product. In customer service this company gets a FIVE STARS.

I am using the syrup solely for making Lattes and I purchased the syrup with a back-up plan that works decently:<br /><br />1-2 spoon fulls of pure pumpkin filling (I buy Whole Foods brand)<br />1-2 pumps of pumpkin spice syrup<br />add your shots of espresso (I use two)<br />mix it all up with a milk frother to a nice homogenized mix<br />pour your already frothed milk into the mix and it should distribute nicely in the milk<br /><br />I actually really enjoyed this, which is why I gave the syrup two stars instead of one.<br /><br /> So yes, the syrup lacks pumpkin.  However adding your own pumpkin turns out to be very tasty with the "spice syrup".  I hope this helps either someone looking to get use out of a huge bottle they already purchased or anyone looking to be creative.

review/summary: OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE
review/text: I have to commend Amoretti for their outstanding customer service. My son has a SEVERE peanut allergy and this item says it is also processed on the same equipment as peanuts. Normally that is a an absolute no for us but I wanted to ask about the packaging process since this is a syrup-when or how do they come into contact with the equipment. The service rep was not sure but she was very helpful in that she immediately offered to transfer me to the actual processing plant so I could ask!<br /><br />The next woman I spoke to was not entirely sure as to their procedures on the allergen foods. She too was helpful and offered to let me speak to the head of the plant operations so I could ask him. I was not on hold for more than 30 seconds when the gentleman picked up, introduced himself and asked how he could help me. I explained my son's allergy and that he could not come into contact with anything that had been processed on the same equipment as peanuts because even trace amounts can be harmful. You may be thinking what a coffee syrup has to do with my two-year-old? Well, he is so allergic that we can't eat things that have contained peanuts or may contain or have been processed o the same equipment.  If we do, then we have to wash our lips, mouth and brush teeth.  I didn't want to have this syrup if I had to drink my coffee in seclusion and at once cleanse.<br /><br />The manager explained that each time their equipment processes any allergen, it is thoroughly cleansed, rinsed and tested for any trace amounts. Nonetheless, they are required to advise the consumer of the allergen (in this case peanut) hazard. I was so impressed and grateful that they take such care in preventing the allergen transfer. It can be difficult to find many foods that are not processed with peanuts or on the same equipment. I was completely thankful he took the time to explain this to me and he even mentioned they just came out with a pumpkin pie syrup! I am going to order that one right away.<br /><br />As for this syrup it is very good. As others' have stated it is not quite pumpkiny; it has more spice than pumpkin flavor. But I imagine that with their pumpkin pie syrup and this spice-I will be able to re-create the perfect Pumpkin Spice Latte just as Starbucks has. Oh and the purchase came with a wonderful brochure showing additional syrups which caused me to check out their website- and oh man do they have a variety! I can't wait to start trying them all.

review/summary: Good product, Great company, Awesome customer service
review/text: After speaking with Paul from Amoretti Company, we need to understand how to use this product. This product isn't like any other syrup that is high in high fructose corn syrup. It's very concentrated with flavor with much less sweetness. If you like to have your drink more sweetness, add sugar to your drink, not syrup because the drink will be too much concentrated with the flavor.  Based on pumpkin spice syrup calorie, 1 serving amoretti is 30 calories compared any other brand syrup 1 serving is 100 calories.<br />This product definitely is a healthier choice of syrup for your coffee or desert. I will definitely will try more of their products and recommend this to my friends

review/summary: Heavy on the spice!
review/text: I first tried this syrup with a latte drink and it was just okay. But now I've been adding one pump with my coffee every morning and love it! Note that this syrup is heavy on the spice rather than the pumpkin flavor. After receiving incredible customer service with Amoretti though, I'm a loyal customer. So I'm now about to try the Pumpkin Pie syrup, which I hope to get more of the sweet pumpkin with.<br /><br />Overall, if you're wanting to take your normal coffee and make it pumpkin spice, I highly recommend this product. It is especially good with darker roasts.

review/text: I initially ordered the Pumpkin Spice flavor. I wasn't crazy about it-very cinnamon heavy, but customer service rep Paul made a few great suggestions. First, if you are looking for a pumpkin flavor, try the Pumpkin PIE syrup. When I ordered Pumpkin Spice, I was unaware that the Pumpkin Pie flavor existed! I have now tried the Pumpkin Pie syrup and it is great! Also, this syrup is not meant to be super sweet (only 4g sugar per full pump) so you may want to add sugar/sugar substitute. Even though the bottle suggests one and a half pumps for 8 oz, I tried 1/2 pump and it was very good. On a side note, my interaction with Paul was the best customer service I have ever experienced.

More hot cinnamon than pumpkin flavor I'd say.<br /><br />Also the safety cap on mine didn't work --the ring below the cap did not break when I twisted it off so I have no guarantee it was not opened before...

review/summary: Not so exciting...
review/text: I received my package and I did receive at least 30 different (brand) varieties. However, I was a little disappointed that they were mostly coffee. I had selected this particular product because it advertised coffees, teas, cocoas, apple ciders, iced coffees, iced teas, etc. and I was actually hoping to get a variety of all those samples. My package contained coffees, bold coffees, decaf coffees, flavored coffees, with only five teas and 1 hot chocolate, which was a disappointment for my kids. No apple ciders, no iced coffees and duplicates of at least 5 coffees. On the plus side, they did send me more than just 30 k-cups, but receiving two hazelnuts from two different companies is not what I would call a different flavor, just a different brand, so I don't think I really received the 30 different flavors that was guaranteed. I also wish I had been sent more of the variety of other items, rather than the duplicates of coffee. The samples were good and tasted fresh. Package arrived within a reasonable time and was well priced for what I received. I contacted the company and they did not return my email. Not happy with lack of response....

review/summary: Can't Get Enough of These!
review/text: When I was a kid, my family frequented an Italian pastry shop that made the best cannolis, sfogliatelle,and a cookie that they called "nut bars." I've only found "nut bars" in two bakeries, one in New Jersey, one on Cape Cod. Although biscotti is an okay substitute, it just isn't the same. Ferrara Cantuccini are exactly like the "nut bars" I remember. Crispy, crunchy, and full of almonds, the texture is quite different from biscotti. The only problem with them is that I could eat them by the boxful. Each piece has about 33 calories, which makes me love them even more (if that's at all possible).

review/text: In my humble opinion these are the best cookies EVER. Although I suppose since half of it is marshmallow, "cookie" is a bit of a misnomer. What they are is a chocolate cake-like cookie topped with a ring of marshmallow and covered in chocolate. Pricey little buggers, but very worth it. If you are either overly attached to the traditional concept of a "cookie" (how boring...) or have a particular aversion to marshmallow (how do you not like marshmallows?????), perhaps Pinwheels are not for you. (Yay, more for the rest of us.) Word of warning: Nabisco only sells the real thing during the winter months when the chocolate won't melt during shipping. During the summer they replace Pinwheels with some nasty confection referred to as Twirls. They look just like Pinwheels but they are coated with brown, waxy, imitation chocolate and are best avoided.

review/summary: Not wholesome
review/text: Amazon sent me the wrong thing (separate packages of cranberries, tart cherries, and bing cherries--not a dried fruit mixture as advertised) but seeing the ingredient list on these is enough to have me avoid the Melissa brand altogether. Ingredients include high fructose corn syrup, sucrose, juice concentrate, partially hydrogenated oil. Yuck.

review/summary: blueberry candy
review/text: The best thing about Melissa's dried blueberries is the plastic bag it comes in which you can reseal.  The ingredients are whole blueberries and high fructose corn syrup.  A serving is 1/3 of a cup (2 servings per 3 oz package).  Each serving contains 22g of sugar and the total carbs are 34%.  That's a lot for 1/3 of a cup of blueberries.  They offer 2% vitamin A, no vitamin C or iron, and 6% calcium.  I bought them to snack on but will try them in cooking after cutting back on other sugar before I throw them out.

review/text: I know these are meant for little kids, but I'm an adult and I seriously love these cookies. They're crunchy but not -too- crunchy, and they're not crunchy in a really dry way if that even makes sense. They're sweet but not -too- sweet. They're just fantastic!

review/summary: misleading product info
review/text: Note this is not a rating for the item. If I wasn't mad as h*ll, I would have thought this was some kind of bad joke.  The seller (diapers.com) advertized the item as a pack of six. I ordered two packs and the seller sent just two boxes (which i could have purchased in a grocery store for a lot less).  The product description was probably an error, unless it was an intentional misrepresentation.  Please do your DD before you order.

review/text: I try to limit processed sugary foods in our diet, however these are my favorite treat to give my son.  They are fairly low in sugar and he likes to ask the letters on them.  These are the only food item I have purchased in the baby isle at the grocery store... I think they are fresher from Amazon... and cheaper too!

review/text: My son loves these cookies & I love that we can learn letters during snack time.  He really gets into looking through the box for a certain letter, asking about things that start with that letter etc.  Some whole grain would be nice that is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.

review/text: We LOVE these cookies!  We take them for snacks at my son's preschool, and they love them because it's makes for a fun letters exercise.  They taste great, and make me feel better about offering cookies after a meal, since they are made with wheat flour.  A great choice for your little snacker!

review/text: These have raisins and oats and wholesome ingredients, not sugar (cane juice), for a subtlety of sweetness. It's hard to describe, but they are just delicious. (I can't help but help my toddler eat them). So much better than sugary cookies from the snack aisle.

review/text: This is by far my 3 yr old favourite since we started introducing Earth's Best product to him since he started solid. I didn't do the subscribe, perhaps I would one day to save some money, but we just ordered and received 12 boxes (ordered 2 pack of 6) and we'll see how long it'll last us.
