review/text: I love this product!  When the company stop selling it in the stores, I was very upset and thought I would never have another cup, but then I found out I could purchase it through Amazon and I'm hooked again.<br />You can adjust the taste to your desire, a little sweet or very sweet and there is no foam as with the other chai tea products.  The pack of 6 is very economical and usually lasts me for about 4 months.

review/summary: Not 'foamy'
review/text: Okay another reviewer pointed out that this is not the foamy stuff, I didn't read that review until after I order the product.  I was disappointed when I first tasted it and wasn't sure how to review it.  This is the original, it's packaged in large bags and indicates it is for vending machines.  I have to wonder if there is a large warehouse full of this stuff that is now being sold to the public since Maxwell House took over.  Not a bad thing, just wondering, maybe bad when the warehouse is empty.<br /><br />So why the 5 stars if I was disappointed?  Well because it is the original which I use to LOVE.  It was only recently I got use to the foamy stuff so I guess I can get use to this again and love it once again.  I'm taking it slowly though, mixing 1/2 this with 1/2 foamy.  I'm weening myself off the foamy stuff :)  I really was disappointed when the diet version went away, have to watch my figure you know.  I had some diet stuff stored at my sisters and when I went for a visit I found I didn't like it anymore.  For me it's all a matter of getting use to the 'version' of the stuff.  BUT I have to say I have NOT been able to get use to any other brand.  Oh how I have tried.

review/summary: Good flavor and value - this isn't the "foaming" kind
review/text: I have a cup of this every night to unwind. I've tried other kinds when the cans of this in the store switched to foaming kind - there's something weird about the flavor of it. Anyways, I still like this the best. It's not too gingery.<br /><br />Buying it in bulk is cheaper than buying the little cans at the store, so if you drink a lot then it's a good value.<br /><br />This is NOT the weird foaming kind that they sell in stores, it's the old formula.

review/summary: Good but..
review/text: I used to buy tins of this all the time.  I wish they still sold it like that.  This was always my favorite flavor.  After much waiting and always searching the stores I got online to track this down.  I found it here but in large vending machine quantity.  That is the reason it lost one star.  I still have several big bags of this in my closet.  Guess I'm good to go for a while!  I have found to help keep this fresh I use an old plastic Nestle Quik container.  One bag fills it right up.<br /><br />This lost the second star for the product itself.  First I find this much weaker than it used to be in the tins.  I have to add more to each cup to get the right flavor.  Second this is Very chalky and Very Very powdery.  I can taste the powder in it which before I could not.  I even tend to have a powdery residue at the bottom of my cup as well.  This may be because this was for a machine or something so it has a slightly different consistency.  Although about the time this was leaving the shelves of stores I noticed a change in several of the other flavors.  All of which were changing slightly in ways like that.  That was also when they started making some of their lattes foam up.  So I don't know if this changed during that time as well.<br /><br />Simply, this fills the void that was left since I no longer find it on the shelves.  Its not a perfect match to what I fell in love with but it is definitely still tasty. I would order it again to have it and probably will whenever the day comes when I run out again.

review/text: I used it in a Moqueca which is a Brazilian Fish Stew, and it was very delicious. The problem I had was with the bottle top. The recipe called for 1/4 c of the oil. Unfortunately, I was unable to remove the plastic top which does not unscrew.  It just has a flip top cap with a single hole in it and ended up just shaking it by drops into the measuring cup which was messy and a hassle.

review/summary: Bland
review/text: This just wasn't good.  I made it one night as directed and didn't add any other seasoning and it was very bland and basic tasting.  Even the usual guilty pleasure that is velveeta cheese wasn't all that great.  The broccoli was completely nonexistent other than a few brown specs.  I don't understand the point of this really.  A one pot meal perhaps?  You could take the regular veletta mac & cheese and make the same thing by adding your chicken and maybe your own broccoli and it would taste better.  The directions are just different for this than the box of mac & cheese and it doesn't taste as good.  Or make your mac & cheese and chicken with broccoli on the side.  Admittedly I'm not a fan of these type of meals in the first place, but I could see buying it if it actually tasted decent. Completely uninspired and has very little flavor.  It's also mostly bad for you and not worth the calories and sodium.

review/text: This meal was easy to make and the kids liked it.  However the "broccoli" portion was made up of green specs. I'm not sure if it was dried broccoli, but it didn't look appetizing. I cooked it using the "broccoli" it contained, but I suggest others use real broccoli. Overall, the product is okay if you are in a rush, but I think cooking regular pasta and simply adding cheese, fresh broccoli, and chicken will yield better, healthier, and tastier results.

review/summary: Cheesy, Salty, Kraft Velveeta Orzo dinner kit
review/text: Kraft's Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Dinner Kit was a pleasant surprise. It takes a pound of chicken and 2.5 cups of water, everything else is in the box. Once the chicken is browned,  it cooks in less than 15 minutes. Those who love Velveeta Shells & Cheese will likely enjoy the taste, the cheese packet is exactly the same and dominates the dish's flavor. Vegetarians could sub the chicken for tofu. Another alteration might be adding real broccoli, in place of the dry bits that come in the packet. The packaging describes it as a pasta dish, but it looks and feels more like orzo. There's enough food for three to four good size servings. No one would mistake this for restaurant fare, but for the price and time it takes to make this uber-quick meal, you could do a lot worse. Obviously intended for college kids and young children.

This boxed meal<br />takes that quick and easy one step further.

Nice to not have<br />to give much thought or effort to food after a long busy day.<br /><br />This was a decent meal, and I will purchase it for future busy days!<br />This particular trial was from Amazon Vine, and I was very pleased with<br />myself for having chosen it to try !

review/text: Don't think of this as a quick meal unless you use leftover chicken or chicken  you  cooked ahead of time.<br /><br />To make this dinner, you will need to purchase 1 lb. of chicken breasts.<br /><br />To add more flavor, I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, Mrs. Dash Chicken seasoning & poultry seasoning while I was cooking it then followed the instructions on the box. If you're not familiar with orzo pasta which is the pasta used in this meal, it looks similar to white rice.  The broccoli used  is dried florets. The pieces are tiny & because it's dried they have the color of dried parsley. There isn't much broccoli included so I added more.<br /><br />My family thought the meal was okay; some thought it didn't have enough flavor, some thought the pasta was too soft (maybe I overcooked it); I thought it was salty which is typical of box meal kits.

review/summary: Tasty & quick!
review/text: You can think of the Velveeta Cheesy Skillets as a higher-end version of Hamburger Helper.  The ingredients are a bit more imaginative and the flavor is definitely better.  The chicken and broccoli skillet was definitely tasty and very easy to make.<br /><br />I particularly like that it includes orzo pasta instead of the usual macaroni or shells that you so often see in boxed one-skillet meals.  The flavoring is good and the signature Velveeta cheese adds a delicious creaminess to the dish.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the broccoli really isn't great.  It's freeze-dried, which makes sense considering that this is a non-refrigerated kit, but the pieces are extremely tiny and the taste isn't all that great.  I ended up stirring in some steamed fresh broccoli, and that made the dish taste a LOT better.

review/summary: A new take on an old classic
review/text: I've purchased these Kraft cheese & [fill in the blank] products for years. They're predictable and well suited to young palates. I followed the box recipe with two changes. Instead of chicken, I flaked off 16 oz. of leftover salmon. I also melted in a half dozen slices of american cheese, to subdue the stronger salmon flavor. That made it more kid-friendly.<br /><br />Unlike the frozen broccoli and chicken, in which the broccoli is prominent, the broccoli florets were tiny and dehydrated,  didn't reconstitute much, and failed to contribute much flavor. Depending on the eaters, you may consider that a pro or con. It's hard to see anybody doing any better in a boxed product like this. We like our broccoli, so next time, I'll blanche some florets separately and toss 'em in a few minutes before completion.

review/text: If you are a fan of similiar quick-prep products such as the Hamburger Helper line, this is right up your alley.  The chicken and broccoli version of the cheesy skillet is pretty good.  Cube and cook some chicken breast in the skillet, add water, seasoning and pasta, then bring to boil, then simmer.  After about 7-8 minutes, add the broccoli and simmer a little longer, then add the cheese sauce.  I topped it with Ritz, and it was an easy dinner in about 20 minutes.  It is definitely a kid friendly dish.  The only thing that I didn't just love was the fact that the broccoli is pretty much dried, powder, but for a quick dish it's a winner.  I will try some of the other varieties.

Was fairly tasty, but i think could have used more veggies- maybe some onion and mushrooms or something- and it would have beennice if there were *actual* broccoli florettes instead of just the florette bud-ends. I also found it to be a bit on the salty side- but then again, velveeta *is* a processed cheese- so i supposee i shouldnt be surprised. (no need to add salt to this entree. lol) but it is quite quick, easy and edible.

review/text: I followed the instructions on the box:  Brown the chicken: add water, seasonings and pasta, cook for seven minutes, covered, stirring frequently;  add the packet of dehydrated broccoli, cover and cook for two to four minutes, until most of the water is gone.  Remove it from the heat, stir in cheese, done!<br /><br />It was tasty, not too salty.  All we added was some ground pepper to the finished dish.  The pasta in this package was very small and almost gave more of an effect of rice.  It would have been pretty good without the chicken, we think.<br /><br />If you are looking for a quick, one pan meal, this would fill the bill quite well.

review/summary: Didn't taste good.
review/text: We made this for dinner last night.  It was easy to make -- brown some chicken, cook some pasta, add the sauce.  The *broccoli* was dehydrated flakes, the cheese sauce was not good, and there was too much of it. The result was a bland gluey dinner that didn't have much nutritional value.  Although I doubt I will buy this to make again, if I did I would supplement it with fresh broccoli.  On the other hand, the kids loved it.

review/summary: Needs Help
review/text: When I opened the carton I found 4 packets consisting of:<br /><br />A. A clear packet containing what was described as pasta and had some similarity to orzo.<br /><br />B. A paper packet which was labeled as being some type of seasoning.<br /><br />C. A silver foil packet which held the cheese.<br /><br />D. Another paper packet marked as broccoli but that was a misnomer because the contents clearly appeared to be sawdust from a green shingle.<br /><br />There was no chicken. So much for truth in advertising. There actually was no broccoli either - just some sawdust apparently swept off the floor.<br /><br />I went to Publix and bought some chicken and followed the instructions on the back of the box. I did not, of course, add the sawdust. After adding the cheese I tried a sample and it was edible but not with much of a flavor. It was just OK but no great shakes. That is my reason for the three stars.  I then added a can of Ro*tel diced tomatoes and green chiles. This I topped of with my favorite seasonings and some crumbled Publix saltines. The result was a much improved meal with a significantly improved taste.<br /><br />I actually cannot see any reason for buying this product. You would do better to buy some orzo, chicken and your favorite type of cheese. You most likely have some seasonings already. If you want to add brocolli buy some fresh and steam it for a few minutes and throw it into the mix. Add whatever your imagination and taste buds find pleasurable. You will have a far superior meal.

review/summary: Liked it More Than We Thought We Would
review/text: This is the second Kraft Velveeta Skillets Dinner Kit we've tried and we found it surprisingly good. The pasta is orzo, which if you're not familiar with it is the size and shape of rice. The kit comes with the pasta, a flavor packet and cheese sauce. The cheese is your standard Velveeta and the flavor packet has a mild broccoli flavor. Like rice, orzo tends to pick up the flavors around it. Also like rice, orzo is easy to over cook, so pay attention to the instructions and the stage your pasta is at. These are mild flavors and smooth consistencies, which may make them appropriate for children as an introduction to broccoli. We enjoyed it quite a bit.

review/summary: An easy and fast dinner
review/text: I must admit that I'm not the biggest fan of processed foods and have often found the taste of these quickie dinners not as scrumptious as if you used all natural ingredients. However, I also live in the real world and as a mom of two, we need some pantry staples that we can turn to when we're rushing off to soccer practice.<br /><br />I found Velveeta Cheesy Skillets very easy to make. The directions are simple-- cook chicken (I grilled some then added to a skillet), add 2 1/2 cups of water, seasoning and pasta, bring to a boil, cover and stir often for 7 minutes, add broccoli (comes in box), cover and cook until most of the water is gone, then add cheese sauce pouch.<br /><br />It cooks just as fast as other packaged foods such as Hamburger Helper and Pasta Roni and tastes just as good. I definitely see this being used by families when you're in a hurry, and you can even get creative and add in some fresh vegetables to spice it up just a little more.

review/summary: Easy to prepare but not good
review/text: Like many of the other reviews here mine is going to be so-so at best.  I wanted to like this meal better since it contains the two most important food groups, cheese and noodles.  On the other hand I am not typically a fan of meals out of the box.  I gave it a good try, though.  The broccoli was not dust like others have described but neither was it much like broccoli, either.  More like a marginal food-like product.  Too much cheese, also.  One hint:  it is important to have fresh chicken, as recommended, not pre-cooked.

review/summary: too much cheese....
review/text: I should have known when the box said "cheesy skillets" and had Velveeta as an ingredient that this wasn't probably for me. It did take the 20 minutes to prepare the Chicken and Broccoli <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YV80OE">Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner Kit, 14.64-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> meal. I had precooked the chicken, so I am not including the chicken cooking time as part of the 20 minutes.<br /><br />The instructions are clear enough - cook the chicken, cook the pasta, add the broccoli and the cheese. I may have misunderstood the directions because I didn't put the broccoli in until after the pasta was cooked. The water cooked off very quickly, in about 5 minutes for me. I did have the skillet on simmer, so I don't know if this is my problem or the instructions problems. I had to add about 3/4 of a cup more of water to finish cooking the pasta and the broccoli. The broccoli florets were about the size of parsley flakes, so if you are not fond of broccoli, this is a plus for you. I happen to like broccoli. And than you pour the small packet of Velveeta on top of the food. For me, it was too much Velveeta - it could have been decreased by 1/3 and I think it would make a better tasting meal - especially with the addition of more broccoli.<br /><br />For me, I just wasn't that impressed with it. I would have like more broccoli and less cheese.  However, if my picky sons were still at home, I think they would have loved it. Not enough broccoli for them to whine about eating and of course, the Velveeta cheese they love.<br />I would recommend this to somebody who really, really liked Velveeta. It might a good kid's dinner for some folks. But for me, thanks but no thanks.

review/summary: Quick and tasty meal for when you don't have time for something more involved
review/text: When time is short and the family is grumbling for something to eat, a boxed prepackaged meal can be a great way to get dinner handled.  Cook a little chicken and throw in the packaged cheese and veggies and you're good to go.  While not as fantastic as any given home cooked meal, Velveeta's cheesy skillets are easily on par or better than most varieties of the standard chicken/tuna/hamburger helpers available at the supermarket.<br /><br />There are a lot of ways to jazz the meal up or make it go farther for feeding more people, like adding in more vegetables or turning it into a casserole by baking a bread crumb crust on top. Although making it too much more exciting obviously defeats the purpose of having a quick and fast boxed meal sitting in the counter in the first place.<br /><br />For something simple and easy when you don't have time for a prepared meal, the chicken and broccoli cheesy skillet is a tasty and affordable option, it just won't knock your socks off and become your new favorite dinner.

review/summary: Easy to make but gets cold fast
review/text: I love mac and cheese and this is a dish close to that. It has a few packs of ingredients, pasta, cheese, dried broccoli, seasoning. All you have to do is add chicken if you want. The pasta is orzo, I had thought it was a little larger which I think would have been better.<br /><br />Everything tastes good but the big problem is that it gets cold real fast. Its very creamy and has plenty of flavor and even when it did get cold, didn't dry out and get too thick. It was s quick one pot easy dinner and made enough for 3 decent portions. It does fill you up fast because in my experience, orzo pasta tends to absorb and absorb liquids and swell up way more than regular pasta.<br /><br />Al in all it was a good dinner and my only wish was the pasta was shells or elbows or something like it.

review/text: I've enjoyed many a meal of Hamburger Helper through the years, and Kraft's Velveeta foray into the skillet, quick meal world is very much in this vein...but cheesier and tastier.<br /><br />The cooking process is pretty straight-forward and simple.  It was enough food for a couple of adults and a couple of little kids.<br /><br />Members of our household are not huge broccoli fans (especially when it comes in the form of flakes like in this package), so we prefer the Velveeta Ultimate Cheeseburger Dinner Kit.

review/summary: Bland
review/text: I typically spend a lot of time on my reviews, checking facts and spelling and phraseology, hoping not to be horribly embarrassed when I re-read a review.  This product is not worth the effort.<br /><br />Chicken and Broccoli Skillets is relatively easy to prepare.  Essentially, everything goes in the pan and you simmer for a while.  The required chicken breast is not included.  The box says preparation time is about 20 minutes, and that seems about correct.<br /><br />The problem is what happens when the cooking is done.<br /><br />First, Cheesy Skillets looks unappetizing.  The color is off-white and looks absolutely nothing like the picture on the box.  The little pieces of broccoli from the box mostly disappear, covered by the cheese sauce.  In fact, the whole thing appears to be one color.  One way to help the appearance is to throw actual broccoli into the mix.<br /><br />Second, the flavor is plain.  When I say plain, I mean exceedingly plain.  I suppose if you are trying to cook in a way that is unlikely to offend anyone, the flavor of this stuff is it.  It reminded me of school cafeteria or chow line food.  I was able to detect a vague broccoli taste in combination with a mild cheese flavor.  Those two flavors were the sum total of the flavor experience.  I have no idea how to save the flavor.  This bland concoction needs a kick of some kind, but I am not sure what kind.  Since this is supposed to be a cheese based product, perhaps jalapenos.  Unfortunately, it would take more experimentation than I am interested in conducting.<br /><br />Third, the rice felt funny in my mouth.  I typically eat Asian style rice, which is somewhat sticky and has a nice body to it.  The rice in cheesy skillets is difficult to describe.  It seemed to have a vague pasta texture or consistency.  The rice was definitely slippery.<br /><br />Many products exist that have sort of base to which you add meat.  These product encompass hamburger, tuna, and chicken, at the very least.  We have been fans of Velveeta brand cheese for many years.  We will not be adding Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets to our list of favorite foods.<br /><br />Good luck!

review/summary: Cheesy and Delicious
review/text: You won't like this if you don't like broccoli. If you do like broccoli, and you crave the comfort-food goodness of Velveeta pasta and cheese, you'll find this in an enjoyable way to turn Velveeta from a side dish into a main course. The pasta, in this case, is orzo, a delightful variation from the standard macaroni or pasta shells. It's very cheesy.<br /><br />My husband prepared it as the directions suggested, with chicken breast, but it would also be good with ground beef. For a vegetarian version, you could add more fresh broccoli, or red or green peppers, or possibly black beans. The box was large, and with the addition of the chicken (or extra veggies, or another protein) it could easily serve four adults.

review/summary: Not so good, but it will keep you from starving.
review/text: I had previously tried the Velveeta Ultimate Cheeseburger and the Velveeta Zesty BBQ Chicken before with great results.  Unfortunately, our luck ran out with the Chicken and Broccoli dinner kit.  First, as many others have pointed out.  The broccoli is a freeze dried, powdery substance (but of course it would have to be, in order to keep in a box) and has the look of parsley flakes.  There was no discernable broccoli taste in the finished product. I'm not particulary fond of orzo pasta, but in this case I don't think another type of pasta would have changed anything with the taste, but perhaps the texture would have been a little better.  I used just a bit under 1 pound of chicken, and I don't think the seasoning packet contained enough, because the dish was quite bland.  However, there was plenty of the Velveeta cheese sauce, but, as much as my kids and husband love it, it was not enough to save this meal.  Also, the look of the meal was very bland and had no visual appeal. As I stated with my reviews of the other Velveeta Skillets, one box is not enough for the four members of my family who don't eat baby food.  With the other meals I prepared two boxes of the meal, but with this one I only prepared one, and used it more as a "side" dish to a large salad and breadsticks.  While I will continue to purchase the Ultimate Cheeseburger and Zesty BBQ meals, I will not be purchasing any more of the Chicken & Broccoli skillets.

review/text: I fixed this for my husband and I a few nights ago. The taste was pretty good to start with, but the more I ate it the less I wanted to. After a few bites it got pretty bland, and a bit gummy. Because it is a type of mac and cheese, I think the grandkids would like it however I won't be fixing it for us anymore. I put the leftovers in the refrigerator, but did not even want to warm them up for lunch or a snack. I would not purchase this item.

review/summary: Be Prepared For Some Kitchen Time
review/text: Not a quick meal to make when you are in a 'hurry', you have to let things cook for a while. Waiting for the water to completely soak up is required before being able to add in necessary items.<br /><br />Broccoli already comes in the package, but I took the liberty of adding in actual pieces, along with diced up imitation crab. They were probably why the casserole came out a step above several box dinners.<br /><br />The Velveeta is provided, and yes-- it actually is authentic Velveeta. It's not the powdery kind which could have been packaged. You get to easily stir it into the casserole at the end of the cooking time. The cooking time itself is what takes the work. This product is for people really good at following directions because everything is divided up into separate packages with multiple steps.<br /><br />This isn't something which you'd want to eat 'every night' and might not be the healthiest option, a light version not yet being available. But it does taste edible especially when you take extra time to customize it.

review/summary: Not for broccoli lovers
review/text: I liked this.  As far as meals in a box go, this had a pretty good flavor.  But calling it "chicken and broccoli" is a bit of a stretch.  The packet of broccoli was about the same size as the packet of seasoning.  I think there might have been as much salt as there was broccoli.  This pasta also looks like rice.  It doesn't taste like rice because it's much softer so there's a bit of a disconnect between your eyes and your taste buds when you eat it.  In the end though, this isn't a bad option, just make sure you have a vegetable on the side.

review/summary: Broccoli? Really?
review/text: After preparing this product I can say that I am not a fan.  The taste was what I would call "fair" - it was pretty bland - and the broccoli was essentially powdered flakes.  I had rather add my own broccoli and because this product calls for you to add your own chicken, adding your own broccoli would not be a lot of additional work.<br /><br />Velveeta Cheese is definitely the dominate flavor in this product and I think that is fine.  If you do not like the taste of Velveeta then you probably do not want to try this product.<br /><br />The product was easy to prepare but it is what it is - a fast, no fail "dinner kit".  If you aren't expecting gourmet cuisine then you will probably be fine with this product.

review/summary: Not as good as it sounds.
review/text: I had a feeling when I opened the box that this wasn't going to be as good as it looked in the picture. Included therein were a package of orzo-style pasta, a big pouch of Velveeta cheese, an envelope of seasoning and another small, flat envelope marked "broccoli florets." Inside the latter envelope was a tablespoon or so of grey-green flakes which may have at some point been broccoli, but were nothing you could call a floret in this stage of it's existence. Now, I know this is packaged food and it's not going to be anything to write home about, but honestly, I don't think the company should be allowed to claim that this dish contains broccoli. A few green-gray flecks can hardly be called a vegetable.<br /><br />Preparation was relatively easy. I browned the chicken I was adding (the box calls for 1 pound, which in my case consisted of two chicken breast halves, halved again so there were four pieces total.) To the thoroughly cooked chicken I added 2.5 cups of water, the seasoning packet and the pasta. During the course of cooking the pasta swells up and it was a nice texture and consistency on its own. After simmering the mixture a few minutes I added the packet of alleged broccoli florets, of which there were far too few to affect the look, let alone the taste, of the concoction. Stirring continuously because the pasta wanted to stick to the bottom of the pan, I found the mixture was taking on a slimey look as the moisture evaporated a bit. The final step was to stir in the packet of cheese. In the interest of full disclosure, I have to admit I'm not a Velveeta fan, but my father loves it and I fed this to him, too. The cheese was bright orange goop and per the instructions I mixed it into the dish hoping it would taste better than it looked. It didn't. More importantly, my dad, who LOVES Velveeta and any other kind of American cheese dish, didn't like it. The prepared dish had a strange texture that wasn't appetizing at all. He's not a picky eater, and if he won't eat it, you can bet it's damned near inedible. I can't recommend this product.

This has not become gourmet fare or anything close to it, but it's always handy to have a couple of boxes in your pantry for those emergency situations when you're too tired to cook a real meal or don't have anything edible in the fridge. You will need broccoli and chicken to make this the way it looks on the box. But it's easy enough to make as the instructions aren't too different than other Velveeta or Hamburger Helper products. This really brings me back to the broke college days though. Haven't touched boxed food since then. And I'm not sure I want it in my regular daily menu. However, since it stores well, maybe put box in the good old earthquake emergency kit?

review/text: I'm a big fan of chicken and broccoli, at least the way my wife makes it, so I was very interested in trying this as a quick and easy meal. My first impression looking at the package was that it was a pasta dish, but then looking closer it really is orzo. The directions are straight forward and if you have cooked orzo or rice before you should be fine. However, if you overcook, as one reviewer noted, you are likely to get mush. The longest preparation was cooking the chicken (not included) so the anticipated time savings was reduced. In fresh broccoli and chicken preparations you have nice flowerettes of broccoli - here you have flakes, some would say dust. The dish then has these flakes of green which do impart a hint of broccoli and maybe this is a good way to hide the vegetable from the kids, but it gets covered up by the Velveeta cheese. You must like Velveeta cheese to enjoy this dish. Overall taste was good, but the anticipated time savings weren't achieved. In my family a split decision on the product.

I think the primary difference is the pasta used.  I prefer larger pasta and this particular kit had pasta the size of plump rice grains.  On the other hand the Kraft Velveeta Ultimate Cheesburger Skillets Dinner Kit has nice large yummy pasta that don't get all stuck together.  So I'll stick with that Kit and pass on this one.  You can always buy a nice mac and cheese regular kit from the store as well as Velveeta cheese and add what you want for a greater cost savings.

review/summary: Requires your own magic, that's all.
review/text: I have been enjoying the Velveeta products but I think people are expecting too much out of a cardboard box.  This is a starting point, the baseline for a meal where you don't really have to think about, but you have to bring your own magic and ingredients to the party.  If you do, you will be rewarded with a tasty and economical meal.  If you do not, you may as well cook Kraft Mac N Cheese (though I can make that magical as well!).  What's in the box?  Noodles, CHEESE, some flavoring and broccoli particles.  What should you add?  Chicken (duh) and I recommend some real frozen broccoli florettes.  It will extend the size, nutrition and taste of the meal significantly.  If you are really adventurous, you might try some fresh herbs, julienned red bell pepper and grated cheese to top.  Go wild, don't live by the box, those are only guidelines.  Have fun with it and your taste buds will be rewarded.

review/summary: It's ok, but not really "dinner"
review/text: My kids love macaroni and cheese with dinner. They even like broccoli. I thought that this would be right up our alley.<br /><br />The broccoli: The broccoli is more of a seasoning that a real part of the dinner. I know, I should have expected this. But when I poured the little, dry broccoli pieces out, I had a bad feeling. Sure enough, I ended up making some real broccoli to eat along with the cheesy skillet.<br /><br />The noodles: Nothing to really complain about here. If you follow the directions, you pretty much get what you see on the box. Only smaller. I wish they'd stuck with regular macaroni or with shells, but these weren't bad, just not great. The picture on the box really magnifies the noodles too.<br /><br />Chicken: Well, you add your own. So go for it! If you like your food all mixed up, then the cheese coated chicken will be yummy at least.<br /><br />Cheese: The high point of the meal right here! It comes creamy already, no need to mess with the powdery stuff you get in some "meal" boxes. Flavorful, cheesy, and creamy. It's just about all you can ask for in a pre-made "Mac and Cheese" box.<br /><br />Overall: I might buy it again as part of a larger meal. Definitely make your own vegetable to go along. Not horrible, not great, just a quick easy dinner if you are runny late.

review/text: Surprisingly enough, everyone in the house liked this dinner.  It was easy to fix, especially since I did the preparation.  It has a good taste and consistency.  If I had a reservation, there was not much broccoli included and it was a very fine chop.  Other than that issue,I thought this was a good deal.

review/summary: Not your standard Mac and Cheese but Good! Where is the Broccoli?
review/text: When the box says pasta and broccoli you expect broccoli. Most expect a pasta not a Orzo, a rice shaped minute pasta. This meal wasn't exactly what the box advertized. But this review is not on the box alone but on the food in the box.<br /><br />  Easy to make? yes. Not difficult at all. Healthy? not really, the amount of sodium, fat and lack of fresh or frozen veggies make it not very healthy. That brings me to the lack of broccoli. Dried flakes of broccoli does not have the same health value or nutritional value as fresh or even frozen broccoli. This meal had broccoli flavoring rather than broccoli. A small amount of flakes that left a slight flavor but was a disappointment for anyone who likes broccoli or wants to include it in a flavor friendly way for children (or adults)<br /><br /> The saving grace of the meal? It tasted good. Really good. It was a type of American risotto. My husband who usually hates risotto loved it. I loved it. Kids loved it after they got over the shape.<br /><br />  It is rated 4 stars because of the flavor and texture of the food. Because it was requested again and because it is easy to store and whip up anytime. While it is higher in salt than I would like it is less salty than Velveeta's other box pastas. Cons don't expect broccoli or it to be the standard mac and cheese it's not. But it is good. Had it been what was advertised or had lost of broccoli it might of received 5 stars.

review/summary: More of the same
review/text: Once again I gave Velveeta a try and came away unimpressed.  I was hopeful that the combination of chicken and broccoli would be enough to jazz up a mundane meal.  I was wrong.  The meal was simply average, nothing out of the ordinary, no distinctive tastes or seasonings.  The use of velveeta does create a smoother texture than other similar box meals but other than that there is nothing remarkable about it.  If you are a fan of Velveeta, loyal to the brand etc. then this would be the selection for you. Othewise I must say that it is the same as compared to any other chicken boxed meal that I have had.  Overall it was an average meal.

review/summary: Almost as good as Hamburger Helper...
review/text: If you like all in one meals, then Velveeta Cheesy Skillets is one you should try. I bought the already cooked sliced chicken in the meat section to add in. Pros of the meal: 1) cheesy 2) flavorful - I didn't need to add any other seasonings. It didn't require any salt, pepper, or whatever else your tastebuds may call for. 3) The servings were plentiful. It serves a family of four perfectly. There were only 2 in my house, but we had enough for lunch the next day. 4) The leftovers were just as tasty as the first night of eating it. The only con that I can think of is that the meal uses dried broccoli, which has a strong sweet taste. If you are able to substitute it with fresh broccoli or even frozen broccoli, that would balance the taste better.

review/text: I know poor caption; what can I say? I was underwhelmed with the overall quality. Not as good as straight mac-n-cheese. Think of this meal like the old Hamburger helper but with chicken; they basically give you a seasoning packet with tiny pasta- orzo-  you add your own chicken. With a little practice you can end up with an okay tasting meal but the packaged part of the meal is not very nutritious. I would probably not buy it at the grocerey store.

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: Not bad for a one skillet meal.  The cheese sauce is a nice touch especially being velveeta cheese.  It came with Orzo (little mini rice sized pasta) I think a larger pasta like a corkscrew or penne would have made it a little nicer. It was actually quite a hardy meal, they give you more a good portion of orzo, but only a wee bit of broccolli bits.  So more veg! I give it a solid 3.5*'s, not quite 4.

review/summary: Surprisingly tasty
review/text: Kraft Velveeta-brand cheese has been around for many years.  I remember having the brick of Velveeta in the refrigerator as a kid growing up.  Kraft is obviously branching out, using the Velveeta name on a line of packaged food products.<br /><br />In the modern era, food is all about being fast, tasty, and nutritious (the latter far down on the list, sad to say).  Velveeta definitely meets the first two criteria.  Being chicken-based, it probably is about average for all boxed meals.  The chicken is not including in the box.)<br /><br />This is a creamy blend of pasta, broccoli, and (added) chicken.  The spices are moderate, not too hot, which is just how I like it.  It's filling because of the cheese sauce and the pasta.  It can fill you up quickly enough, to give a nice satiety after a moderate-sized portion.<br /><br />Of course the real question is, would I eat this again?  If it were moderately priced, yes, I would.  It's above average in taste, filling, and fairly easy to make.  Recommended.

review/text: I'm going to give this an "ok" or "thee star" review because it was edible...it is Velveeta but it sure isn't what I expected.  The box should of said, "just add chicken AND BROCCOLI" because you sure didn't get any in the box!  The "Velveeta" cheese that we as consumers are familiar with is the same, but the "added" broccoli makes you think you will get a small can inside, not flakes.  I must be honest, I wouldn't purchase this again in a store, I would just stick with the regular cheese and noodles from Velveeta!

review/summary: QUICK BUT  TASTES REALLY PROCESSED
review/text: I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. THE CHEESE PRODUCT DOESN'T TASTE LIKE CHEESE AT ALL(SOME PROCESSED CHEESE DOES HAVE A CHEESY TASTE)AND THE BROCOLLI BITS TASTE WEIRD.  I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN VERY SURPRISED BECAUSE WHAT BROCCOLI AND CHEESE COMES IN A BOX? BUT I THOUGHT MAYBE THE SEASONING AND PASTA WOULD BE TASTY ENOUGH TO PULL IT OFF.  IT WAS A QUICK MEAL TO PREPARE SO FOR THOSE IN A TIME CRUNCH IT MAY FIT THE BILL SINCE IT ALL COMES IN ONE BOX.<br />I DON'T THINK IT OFFERS A GREAT ALTERNATIVE TO JUST BUYING SOME BROCCOLI IN A STEAMER BAG, PASTA AND A BAG OF SHREDDED CHEESE TO ADD TO YOUR  CHICKEN WITH A LITTLE SEASONING.<br />IF YOU'RE IN A PINCH IT MAY DO BUT OVERALL I WOULD HAVE TO PASS.

review/summary: Be prepared to add ingredients like broccoli
review/text: For a quick meal this works as a good starting point but the broccoli is barely there.  It literally is as close to green dust as you can get since it is dried out.  If you compare the broccoli you buy to what's in this you'll really notice the difference in size alone.  My husband and I ended up adding frozen broccoli in addition to what's provided to make the dish more filling.<br /><br />I'm sure you could tweak the final product further than this addition but then you're adding to your dinner cost.  Basically it is something different and ok for when you're short on time. Getting the chicken cut up and ready will be your hardest part of fixing this dish.<br /><br />Overall, I'd suggest to have other ingredients on hand like vegetables etc. to make this more filling.

review/text: Brought this along for a trip with the granddaughter who is 6 years old.  If it is cheesy she eats it.  Well, she like this better than the adults though like other reviewer have noted she was not too pleased with the things that were identified as broccoli.<br /><br />This would be an okay quick skillet meal if you have the pre-cooked frozen chicken strips.  Other wise the chicken is more of a hassle time wise.<br /><br />It is a nice long term pantry items that when all else fails you have for a simple meal.  I would leave the broccoli out and instead put in a can of green beans.

review/summary: Needs more broccoli!
review/text: I wasn't crazy about the Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner Kit, but mostly because it only had a tiny amount of broccoli. I added a package of frozen broccoli, and that improved things considerably. I wish it had a bit less sodium and whole-grain pasta, but it isn't bad the way it is. The Velveeta that was included did improve the overall palatability of the dinner.

review/summary: Good for a Processed Product
review/text: I am not a big processed food advocate but let's face it...there are times in life when we just need to grab a box of something good and make it quickly after a long hard day!  I have always been a fan of Velveeta products and when I had the chance to review this cheesy dinner I was excited.  The flavor I received was chicken and Broccoli and it was extra easy for me because I tend to cook and chop up chicken in advance and keep it in my freezer for times like this.  So, I set about thawing the chicken and followed the directions on the box.  The pasta in this variety was an arborio.  I love making risotto with this pasta and even though the directions don't state this...I 'toasted" the pasta in a bit of olive oil before I continued on with the directional steps.  This gave the overall dish more substance.  I was not impressed with the little packet of dehydrated broccoli so I threw that away and used the chopped real broccoli I had in my freezer.  The cheese sauce packet held the creamy goodness of other Velveeta products and I was really impressed that I did not have to add any additional chedder cheese like I have had to do in the past with competing products.  The dinner was really easy and quick to make and my family really didn't realize it came from a box.  I would buy this product anytime!

review/summary: Good Taste but Be Careful if You're Counting Calories
review/text: My husband is a type II diabetic so we almost always eat whole grain pasta but sometimes you just gotta splurge a little and I'm always on the lookout for something I can have on hand that cooks fast.<br /><br />I fixed this as per the package directions except I used some diced, baked chicken that I already had in the freezer. This is easy to make. Just brown the chicken and then add the seasoning and pasta along with 2.5 cups of water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer for 7 minutes then add the broccoli, cover and cook an additional 2-4 minutes.<br /><br />If you already have the cooked chicken available you could have dinner on the table in about 15 minutes! Even if you are cooking the chicken from raw, this is still a very quick meal.<br /><br />The first bite was almost too cheesy to me. I had some frozen chopped broccoli so I steamed about half a package of it and added it to the skillet. The taste improved quite a bit for me with the added benefit of more veggies.<br /><br />The downside to this meal is that about a cup of it is around 400 calories, 8 grams of fat. I plugged this into the weight watchers points calculator and it's 7 points per cup if you fix it as per the directions.<br /><br />This isn't something I could eat often but with the addition of extra broccoli and taking into consideration how good tasting/convenient it is, I would buy a couple of boxes to keep on hand for times when I don't have a lot of time to cook.

I didn't expect much from the broccoli included, but it did come out decent.<br /><br />While the product was still edible, it's not something I'd buy unlike the Cheeseburger mac.

review/text: "Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner Kit" is OK for a quick meal for those people that aren't picky about what they eat. Think of it as "Hamburger Helper", except made for chicken. It actually taste pretty good, but forget about seeing any actual broccoli on your plate. What they call broccoli looks more like specks of parsley, or as others have described it "broccoli dust". The box claims to feed 5 people. Forget it. If you eat an average sized portion, it will feed 3. Used as a side dish, perhaps it will feed 4. I enjoyed it, but wouldn't want to eat it regularly. For a quick meal in a pinch though, it's pretty good.

review/text: This skillet kit delivers what most Velveeta products do - a quick and easy meal (if you don't mind a ton of calories and fat). However, whereas I love the shells and cheese, I wasn't crazy about the Chicken and Broccoli Skillet variety. This Skillet Kit should really just be called "Cheese Shells...Add Chicken" because the broccoli is non-existent. It's sort of like dried up dust and I'm not even sure how it can count for broccoli. So given the choice, just get the regular Velveeta variety...or just cook up some chicken with real broccoli.

review/summary: Tasty, but doesn't really rise above
review/text: Preparing this skillet dish is easy and anyone can do it. It's not simple, however. First you have to cut up and cook the chicken, and then you have to boil the pasta, stirring it "frequently." After the pasta is boiled, you add the broccoli bits (which smelled delicious but were few in number and an odd brown color). After the water has boiled off, you remove it from the heat, add the packet of Velveeta, stir, and enjoy. Not time or labor intensive (including cooking the chicken, it probably took 20 minutes to prepare), but it's certainly not a "set and forget" time situation for the time-crunched.<br /><br />The meal is large - it easily fed two of us, and we're piggies who ate until we were stuffed. I would say there were three full portions, easily four portions if you supplement with a side dish.<br /><br />However... it's no harder to make this dish than to make any other simple dish from scratch, but this one has more preservatives. The flavor is delicious - if you like Velveeta. Adding chicken to normal macaroni and cheese would have been easier, but probably just as tasty. So I'm mixed. (For the record, my roommate declared that it was absolutely delicious.)

review/summary: Nice but minor issues
review/text: Firstly, the taste was approved by the whole family. Of course its pretty creamy and unhealthy so of course it would taste good :) There were some differences in opinion about the broccoli though. Some thought it had too much broccoli taste while others actually thought it was lacking.<br />The only reason i can think for this is that, the broccoli bits grouped into certain areas more during preparation. Thats actually an issue with this, everything really clung together too much. The picture someone put for the product perfectly describes what i mean.<br />In terms of amount; its quite a small amount they have in 1 box(it says on box ~5 cups of serving). With this amount, its only good for 1 dinner among 3 adults at most. Preparation wise it is simple, though you need to come up with the chicken yourself as it is not included.I would buy this though for the right price, it is tasty and a nice break from just eating Krafts regular mac and cheese.

review/summary: It's Okay, But Not All That Special
review/text: If you're looking for broccoli, get out your magnifying glass, or buy your own broccoli just like you have to buy your own chicken. Essentially, you're getting pasta, cheese sauce, and some dehydrated vegetable pieces, with seasonings.<br /><br />That's not to say it doesn't taste okay. It's just not anything special.<br /><br />Velveeta is to American cheese what American cheese is to cheddar. A poor substitute. But on the other hand, Velveeta cheese sauce beats the heck out of powdered cheese sauce mix that you have to mix with water and milk like what you get with the "Helper" (Hamburger Helper, Chicken Helper, etc.) meals. In that respect, the Velveeta box meal wins hands down.<br /><br />I would suggest that you can use this meal with not just chicken, but with pork as well. The flavor isn't bold enough to stand up to beef, but don't feel you're limited to chicken just because that's all that it says on the box.<br /><br />If you're not a "Helper" person, you won't like this meal. If you are a "Helper" person, you'll feel like you've moved-up a notch. But frankly, you could do better by buying some frozen broccoli, some dried pasta, and any jar of cheese sauce.

review/summary: Better Than Boxed "Helper" Meals
review/text: It's important to state upfront that I'm not big on highly processed, boxed foods as a general rule; they tend to be much pricier than making a casserole and usually contain a lot of additives. That said, I'll be taking a 10 day trip soon. My guys don't cook the way I do, so I ordered the Velveeta Cheesy Skillets Dinner Kit through the Vine program to test-out before my trip, and it is easy to prepare. It's also tastier than the boxed, "Helper" meals.<br /><br />One box makes 5 one cup servings with 300 calories per serving, 8 grams of fat, 620 milligrams of sodium, and 39 grams of carbohydrate, 5 grams of which are sugar. According to the box, nutrition is as follows: Vitamin A - 2%, Vitamin C - 20%, Calcium - 15%, and Iron - 15%. Interestingly, the uncooked Vitamin C is listed as 40%... not sure why that would be cut in half during cooking?<br /><br />Basically you brown 1 pound of diced, fresh, boneless chicken in a large skillet, add water, seasoning and pasta, bring to a boil and reduce heat. This is simmered, covered, for 7 minutes (frequent stirring is recommended), then the dried broccoli bits are added. Cover and simmer for 2-4 minutes longer until most of the liquid is gone. Then you stir in the liquid cheese sauce and serve.<br /><br />It tastes pretty good on its own; I might add halved, fresh cherry tomatoes. For a more complete meal, I'd serve tossed salad on the side with an oil and vinegar dressing. IN SUMMARY: Although I wouldn't buy/eat it on a regular basis, I'll probably pick up a few boxes for dinners in my absence.

Adding some fresh broccoli instead of the bits in the kit would improve the look and taste considerably.

review/summary: Tastily stretches a pound of chicken
review/text: This box entree requires the addition of one pound of cooked chopped chicken--the equivalent of one and one-half boneless/skinless breasts.  It requires about 15 minutes to bring to the table, if the chicken is already cooked. The completed product filled an eleven-inch skillet and made four generous portions.  The pasta appears to be orzo.  The sauce packet and Velveeta did not make the dish too salty. The broccoli is not a large presence, but what is there helps.  Overall, a good, easy addition to one's collection of chicken casseroles.

review/summary: velveeta cheesy skillets: chicken & broccoli
review/text: If you are a fan of Velveeta Mac & Cheese, you will likely enojy this product. I have always loved Velveeta, so it makes sense that I would like the new cheesy skillet dinners. It's not 5 star dining, but it's easy in a pinch. I just added a pound of chicken & had a complete dinner.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you don't care for Velveeta Mac & Cheese, you will disklike this product. You either love or hate Velveeta. I know several people who would never touch anything labeled Velveeta & some who would eat an entire box of Mac & Cheese in one sitting. Personally, I am really looking forward to trying the other flavors.

review/summary: My Husband Like It But What's Up With The Broccoli?
review/text: I gave this four stars based on what my husband's comments were about it. I made it and he tasted it and said "it's good." I did not add any chicken and I used milk when I added the cheese and broccoli. I did not taste it because I'm not into orzo and broccoli. It's just that all the good stuff from the newsletter was taken by the time I logged-on.<br /><br />Anyway, unlike the bowties in the picture, the kit comes with orzo, a pouch of seasonings, a pouch of cheese and a pouch of broccoli. The instructions are very standard and easy to follow.<br /><br />The only major concern here is the "broccoli." To me, the broccoli looked like a mix between uncut marijuana and astronaut food. I could easily imagine a pickier eater boycotting this meal if they ever saw how it was uncooked. I can imagine that you could substitute with any of your favorite vegetable(s) if the dehydrated broccoli is too unappetizing for you.

review/text: First of all, I was not sent the item described; I received a single "cheeseburger pasta" kit. Basically, this product differs from the more famous single-skillet meat and pasta product in that it includes a packet of Velveeta. The kit is easy to prepare--brown the meat, add the seasoning and pasta, simmer, and stir in cheese packet--and cooking takes less than half an hour. It is tasty but a bit salty, and there is not much pasta. If one buys these kinds of products, I guess the combination of pasta and cheese with an instant entree meal would be an attractive product, but I was thinking how easy it would be to cook the same thing from scratch. Recommended mainly for convenience's sake . . . .

review/summary: Not Enough Broccoli For Me
review/text: I am a fan of broccoli, especially with mac & cheese.  So, I had hoped there was quite a bit of broccoli flavor in these boxes.  What I got instead was all "flavor" and not much broccoli at all.  There are two packets and one has about 1-2 tablespoons of dehydrated broccoli and the other has a flavoring that slightly smells like broccoli but mostly just seems salty.  The kraft macaroni / noodle product is pretty much exactly like Kraft Deluxe thought the noodles may be slightly different shaped.  You get a packet of liquid Kraft cheese and this to me is way too salty, seems just like canned nacho cheese dip.  I think the powdered cheese packets they offer in standard mac & cheese boxes have more flavor and seem to taste less salty.  I found that for the money, I could just as easily buy boxed mac & cheese (any flavor including organic or whole wheat) and add frozen chopped broccoli (which usually comes in a very large bag for just a buck or two).  Considering this box assumes you will add grocery bought chicken anyway, you could just as easily buy broccoli as well.  The extra cost of this box just for the small amount of dehydrated broccoli is not necessary.  I found that I could eat healthier & cheaper for the same cooking time by buying these products seperately, hopefully this will help your decision making.

review/summary: Pleasant complement to chicken breast pieces
review/text: This is the third Velveeta Cheesy Skillets Dinner I have tried.  Although my favorite remains the Ultimate Cheeseburger Mac because of the large plump macaroni, this dinner kit with broccoli florets comes in second.  It's light (using small orzo pasta made of wheat flour), refreshing and tastes nice.<br /><br />The broccoli bits are small when dried, expand somewhat when cooked and are quite flavorful.  The seasoning blends in nicely and the Velveeta cheese comes in a large packet.  It is plentiful.  Would you believe that Velveeta Cheese was first made in 1918 by Swiss immigrant Emil Frey of the Monroe Cheese Company in Monroe, New York.  Of course, it has been reformulated since then.<br /><br />There is an amazing amount of Vitamin C in the meal -- 20%, and 15% calcium and iron (all as prepared, rather than as packaged).  Total fat is 17%, most of it saturated.  I'm not sure why some of these statistics change considerably from "as packaged" to "as prepared", the figures definitely rising respectively.<br /><br />So I am pleased with this lighter offering as a chicken accompaniment.  If you are vegetarian it can very well stand on its own and is simple and easy to make.

review/text: My family is big into quick meals, and this Velveeta meal was just right for us. The meal looks pleasing enough, smells good, and tastes OK, too. The pasta pieces are pretty small - not much bigger than the rice in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YPIIRI">Rice a Roni Country Cheddar, 6.3-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> meals. In fact, when my wife was pouring out the contents, she thought it WAS rice, at first.<br /><br />The family liked it well enough that we plan on purchasing it again, and I guess that decision is one of the best recommendations someone can give about a food product. I hope amazon's Vine program offers more products like this in the future for me to try out.

review/summary: Okay But A Bit Bland
review/text: I found this dish to be a bit bland for my taste buds.<br /><br />The orzo pasta was a nice change of pace than the standard elbow macaroni but I noticed that the small rice-like pasta had a tendency to stick together and form large clumps/masses of pasta.  If I had been better prepared I would have tried to form the masses into balls, breaded them, and fried them to make a version of arancini -- Italian rice balls.  That would have been fun.<br /><br />Anyway, with chicken added to the dish I found it to be okay but, as mentioned, a bit bland and the broccoli in this dish was more for color than flavor.<br /><br />Bump it up with some diced jalapeno and a more flavorful protein and this entree would be much improved.

review/summary: My kids didn't even want to eat this
review/text: My kids love chicken, broccoli, pasta, and cheese yet one refused to eat it and another ate it grudgingly.  My kids love mac n cheese and I thought this would be a great meal for those late nights after gymnastics.  I used left over grilled chicken meat and it made an amazingly fast meal.  I was hopeful!  As another reviewer mentioned the broccoli isn't worth mentioning in the meal, think miniscule and these are smaller.  Unfortunately the taste was just lacking.  The cheese sauce was way too sweet and there was no broccoli taste, which we love.  My kids would have preferred any other type of pasta than orzo (give us bow ties, macaroni, penne).  I've tried to feed them two other times the leftovers to meet the same results.  Looks like leftovers are heading for the garbage can.  I'll stick to boiling my own pasta and throw in left over chicken and veggies in my own cheese sauce (way easy, butter, flour, cheese, milk).

review/summary: Didn't care for it
review/text: The picture on the front is super macro.  The "broccoli florets" are barely worth even mentioning.  If you put all the shreds back together you might have one normal piece of broccoli.<br />I was hopeful about the creamy cheese instead of powder, but this pales in comparison to the regular Velveeta shells and cheese.  This tastes like they added heavy cream or sugar to it.<br />The pasta, it turns out, is orzo, which generally I do not like simply because the firmness of it is never quite right.<br /><br />Since you have to buy and prep the chicken separately anyway, I honestly would have been happier had I added chicken and frozen broccoli to the cheap store brand mac n cheese.  Either do that or buy the frozen cheesy chicken meals that actually have chicken and real broccoli in the package.

review/summary: Not impressed
review/text: This meal-in-a-box was alright, but not amazing. You cook some chicken, add the spices, water, and the "noodles" (more like rice than noodles, but still good), and let it cook. After about 7 min, you add the dehydrated broccoli (you can't even taste it), cook it for a few more minutes, add the cheese, and serve.<br /><br />Now, I am somewhat of a health nut. For those like me, be aware that the product it contains trans fats. The spices packet has partially hydrogenated oil. That's the main reason I wouldn't buy it again. The other reason I wouldn't make it again is because it just doesn't seem healthy at all. The dehydrated broccoli is so minimal...you're best off adding your own fresh stuff. The cheese sauce is thick and just can't be good for you. If I were to make it again, I'd make this skillet dinner as a side. Instead of adding the chicken into the mix, I'd just serve chicken as the main part of the meal.<br /><br />So overall, the Velveeta skillet meal was ok, but not something I'd make again. If I want a quick dinner, I make Annie's Homegrown Skillet Meals. Annie's products leave out the trans fats and the terribly artificial ingredients. I would rather make my own food in general, but at least eating Annie's doesn't make me feel as unhealthy!

Also a sprinkle of pepper flakes would wake it up a bit.

review/summary: A flavorful "skillet" meal for those hectic days
review/text: I hate to admit that I use box type "skillet" meals more than I want to. When you work full time during the week, take care of the kids, housepets and have a dairy farm you sometimes don't have the time to cook a nice meal. So, I have lots of experience with "skillet" meals. This one uses chicken instead of hamburger. It's easy to prepare- just brown your chicken, add 2 1/4 cups of water, spices and the orzo. Then after that cooks for around 10 minutes, add the broccoli packet and cook for 2-4 minutes, remove from heat and add the Velveeta cheese sauce. Voila~ you have a decent supper. My husband asked for seconds, so it must've been good for him.<br /><br />For what this product is I thought it was quite flavorful. It had a nice blend of spices, though it was a bit too peppery for my tastes. At first the dehydrated broccoli was a little much for me to get used to. I added some fresh, finely chopped steamed broccoli & thyme to it as well. This seemed to enhance the flavor. Also, I did notice if this sets in the pan even a few minutes after you finish serving it looks a little gloppy.<br /><br />In my opinion I thought this had a better, less nondescript flavor, than most of the Hamburger Helper skillet meals that I've tried. The box I got came with a .75 coupon on another box. So, I'd definitely buy these to eat again, because life isn't getting any slower around here. For what this is it's good, it's an instant skillet meal- just don't expect it to taste like a homemade or gourmet meal and you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: OK in a pinch
review/text: This would be an adequate enough, fairly inclusive product for the cottage or very occasional use at home, but nothing that I would recommend for regular consumption.  To its credit, Kraft promotes this as simple to prepare processed food rather than pretending that it is a healthy alternative to the real thing. Although it does say in small print "just add chicken" the absence of meat should be clarified in light of the fact that so many shoppers are inattentive or limited in terms of literacy. (you could use ground turkey or beef in place of the chicken)  The spices added a bit of a kick to the classic Velveeta flavor but I found them to be a bit much.  The broccoli "florets" had the appearance and consistency of dried parsley flakes and added little in the way of flavor or nutrition.  From an environmental standpoint, it is a disaster with way more packaging material than is warranted.  The prep time was short but no shorter than if you were preparing a similar meal using real broccoli, less sodium and fewer chemicals.  Although the box indicates 5 servings, I cannot imagine that people feel at all satisfied unless a great deal of supplementation goes on.  Kraft suggests "customizing" the meal with crushed Ritz crackers ~ I could think of better ways to enhance the flavor and consistency of this rather gloppy meal.

My spouse, on the other hand, who happens to be from Wisconsin, will rarely touch Velveeta and feels it does not qualify as an actual cheese.<br /><br />So trying this was a gamble.  Will half my family eat it?  Will the other half like it as well as other Velveeta products?<br /><br />Yes and Yes.<br /><br />The pasta packet looks like rice, but cooks up like pasta (which it is) and comes out in these cute little flat football like shapes.<br /><br />The dehydrated broccoli could hardly be called broccoli. There may have been one entire flourette, but it was all shredded up and dried.  In the heated mix, it plumps up, but again, you are getting such a small amount, it hardly contributes to the nutritional value.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I have always loved Velveeta so I thought I would love their skillets. Unfortunately, no. It was very easy to make, just brown chicken, add 2 1/2 cups of water & season packet & pasta and boil, add packet with the broccoli bits, cover & let boil to most of the water is gone & then add the cheese packet. I was expecting larger pasta like shells or rotini but instead it was orzo. Orzo looks like large grains of rice. I made the skillet & it looked delicious, unfortunately, the taste is where I was disappointed. I don't know what it was, maybe the season packet, but the taste was just off & not good in any way. I would rather have made their shells & cheese & added my own broccoli & chicken. I ended up picking the chicken out and throwing the rest away. This was a first for me, I tend to like almost any boxed pasta & cheese meal or side dish.  For broccoli lovers, the broccoli is extremely small, barely noticeable & virtually tasteless. So keep that in mind if you are looking for something with broccoli. I was really expecting better from Velveeta.

review/text: I tried this product as a main dish and did not add chicken (it is called Chicken and Broccoli, but the chicken is not included, a little misleading IMO).  The dish is easy to prepare with clear instructions and is tasty.  The Velvetta cheese is smooth and creamy, better tasting than Chicken Helper and ten times better tasting than the dried out Kraft Mac and Cheese blue box product.  Of course the salt content is high in this highly processed offering, but if you want a quick dish for the kids and you know you're not getting a super healthy product, this is a tasty, easy to prepare, inexpensive meal.  I don't even like Broccoli, but the dried out little Broccoli pieces were tasty (almost like a seasoning!).

review/summary: OK, nothing special
review/text: Look, I realize we are talking about excessively processed food here and therefore one has to maybe lower the expectations.  BUT if you are going to engage in excessive packaging and add unneccessary steps to what is suppose to be a quick "skillet meal," then I am going to take you to task for it.<br /><br />  There are five different packages inside the box:  the pasta, a seasoning packet, the...eh hem...broccoli florets, and the cheese.  Now if these were high quality ingredients, this might make sense from a texture/flavor standpoint.  But they aren't.  The seasoning packet is essentially salt and some other dried seasonings.  The so called broccoli looks like dehydrated grass clippings.  The cheese pack is, well, your traditional Velveeta cheese-like substance.  And then unlike other skillet meals on the market, this one requires a lot of babysitting while cooking.  No throwing it all in the pot and moving on with other things while it simmers.  First, cook the chicken.  Then add water, pasta, and seasoning packet.  Bring to boil and let simmer a couple minutes.  THEN add the broccoliesque stuff.  Cook some more.  THEN add the cheese.  Seriously, if I'm going to spend 20 minutes having to hover over the stove for that many steps, I just as well cook from scratch...which would be healthier for me (this has almost 700 mg of sodium for serving).<br /><br />This would all be forgiven, however, if it tasted good.  It tastes...OK.  It has a pasty consistency when done and this odd sweet taste that just was not expected or welcomed.  Probably would be better if the amount of cheese was cut in half.  I used the entire pack to follow the recipe to the letter, as I was going to review the product for the Vine program.  But if I was going to buy this again, I would probably reduce how much of the cheese I added (and maybe even skip the seasoning packet.)<br /><br />I probably would not buy this again unless I had a ridiculously discounted coupon though.  If I'm gonna kill myself eating processed foods, I at least want to enjoy what I am eating.

review/text: Try New Velveeta Cheesy Skillets<br />Chicken and Broccoli<br /><br />As a busy book reviewer, as well as a person living alone, I often select prepared foods. They save time and money in general, while recognizing that there are issues such as high sodium in such foods...so please be sure to read your Nutrition Facts on a box for full information.<br /><br />I was on Amazon Vine looking for new books to review when I spied this and thought...why not? Everybody has to eat! It had been years since I'd eaten anything with Velveeta, and had seen them advertised on TV...sounded interesting...<br /><br />The box says that prep time is about 20 minutes; I cut that down by using Tyson Grilled & Ready chicken breast strips which I already had for various uses. Interesting;y I had Fajita and I enjoyed the additional touch of flavor it added.<br /><br />Using a large skillet, sprayed with fat free oil, I heated the chicken first and then followed directions to add the pasta, seasoning and water. The pasta in this meal was unlike any pasta I'd ever eaten--it looked like rice. Since I like my pasta al dente. I kept track of the cooking time, taste testing and so the cooking time was a little less than on the box. In the past, I've gotten similar packages that required the addition of some type of meat, and I've not had any to add. In general, I've found that the flavor of the basic seasonings are sufficient and I thought the pasta and seasonings, plus the Fajita flavor was good...<br /><br />But then as the last step, after I had already added the broccoli, I added the Velveeta...<br /><br />Wow - it turned the meal into something that was delicious! I've already purchased the Barbecue Chicken to try.<br /><br />One thing--the dish is very heavy and filling so you might have some leftover...No problem! I zapped it today, after 2 days...and it was still very good...<br /><br />No, it's not home made food...but for single living or fast dinner preparation...I think you would find this a great alternative.<br /><br />Package Received<br />Via Amazon Vine<br /><br />GABixlerReviews

review/summary: Cheesy hot meal
review/text: I don't cook many boxed items, they tend to be to salty. This velveeta has 620mg per serving. I could taste the salt but it had good flavor to. Some liked it some didn't but there was no leftovers. Brown your chicken, if I did it again I would cut them up smaller, add water, seasoning, and pasta (they really could put these in one bag, save on packaging). Boil, simmer, add broccoli bits, again save a step these could all be in one package. Cook some more, add the cheese, stir.<br />I would cook this again and am willing to try other flavors they came out with, like nacho supreme, ultimate cheeseburger Mac, and zesty BBQ chicken. Not as my normal meals but would take on a camping trip. Very filling one pot meal.

review/summary: Wow this stuff is so good
review/text: I love velveeta so i kinda knew this would be good, plus im a fan of chicken. So for the Vine Program I picked this dinner kit. I love dinner kits they make preparing a meal SOOOOO much easier, I mean just add chicken how hard can that be. The only other thing u need is water.. There were no left overs at all. I mean we dont have picky eaters in the house but my kids dont usually finish their plates and ask for more and more till its gone unless they really like it and they loved this. Headed to the store to pick more of these up. Highly recommended!

review/summary: Chicken In My Pasta
review/text: There is no question that these days, it can be hard to get everyone in the family together to come to the dinner table for a meal. For Velveeta they are looking for new ways to get good meals to everyone in the house, made in creative ways for you. Their new Velvetta Skillets Dinner Kit isn't a bad idea. It is a simple and easy way to help with dinner in the home. It is a delightful mix of cheese & broccoli in the pasta sauce. The taste is pretty good, but the problem is that it is very complicated getting the dinner and meat together. It can take longer than Kraft's Suddenly Salads which is easier to make for the family at home. Still, I think you should give this Velveeta chicken & Broccoli Skillets Dinner a shot.<br /><br />Price: B-<br /><br />Taste: B-<br /><br />Convience: C+<br /><br />Overall: B-

review/summary: Makes a tasty meal, either with or without added chicken
review/text: I prepared the VELVEETA CHEESY SKILLETS DINNER KIT at work, where I did not have access to any chicken breasts or to a skillet. The directions on the box call for one pound of chicken breasts cooked on a skillet. The product comes with several envelopes: (1) Noodles shaped like grains of rice; (2) Broccoli florettes resembling dark green twigs (before cooking); (3) Seasoning; and (4) Velveeta sauce.<br /><br />I divided the noodles into three paper bowls, and covered them with steaming water from the coffee machine at work. Then I cooked the suspension in a microwave oven for about five minutes, making certain to stop every 30 seconds to stir. Then, I added the florettes, and cooked in the microwave for another minute or so. Finally, I added the seasoning and the Velveeta sauce.<br /><br />The verbiage on the box suggests that the product was configured for people in the lower social classes. The box proclaims, "MAKE YOUR FAMILY SMILE WITH OOEY GOOEY VELVEETA CHEESY SKILLETS -- IT'S THE GOOD STUFF!!" The box also reads, "CUSTOMIZE IT! CRUMBLED RITZ CRACKERS ARE THE PERFECT TOPPING TO THIS SKILLET."<br /><br />Thus, the verbiage on this box indicates that the product might be a culinary nightmare. But this is not the case. First of all, the noodles were uniformly soft and palatable, and there was no need to run back to the microwave for more cooking. Second, the flavor took the form of a rich, organic melange. (In other words, it was not the case that this product is overly salty, or that it has some sort of off-flavor of stale chicken broth.) I liked the rich, organic flavor. Third, the broccoli florettes, when encountered, were somewhat crunchy and provided a sweet flavor.<br /><br />The VELVEETA CHEESY SKILLETS DINNER KIT is fine on its own as a noodle dish, and I would also expect it to be fine as a recommended add-on for chicken. And now, for the nutrition. The ratio of carbohydrates to fat is 39 grams carbo / 8 grams fat. Thus, it can be seen that this is NOT a high-fat product. It can also be seen that the ratio of carbohydrate / protein is 39 grams carbo / 10 grams protein. Thus, it can be seen that this is not exactly a low protein product. The box states that the dinner kit contains five (5) servings. But I had the entire dinner kit for supper, which provided three medium servings of noodles.

review/summary: A quick and tasty meal
review/text: The new Velveeta 14.54 oz Chicken and Broccoli Cheesy Skillet Kit is a high protein (10g) quick, tasty meal. For five 1-cup servings cook the Chicken and Broccoli mixture with one pound of chicken and 2� cups of water for 10 minutes. I added fresh broccoli, onion and cheese for additional taste and volume.<br />My only criticism is that the seasoning blend containes partially hydrogenated soybean oil.

review/summary: It's fine
review/text: It's not that there is anything wrong with this product but I guess it's hard to do a lot with boxed meal. I love cheese but I found that next time I make it I am going to back off the quantity of cheese or make some extra noodles to mellow it out a bit.

review/summary: Satisfactory
review/text: This is Velveeta's attempt to be a dinner-in-a-box like Hamburger Helper products and variations.  You provide the chicken, Kraft offers the cheese, pasta and seasonings.  Nothing extraordinary but it qualifies as a quick dinner fix when you aren't in the mood to cook a whole lot.  The seasonings were tasty but honestly, anything with Velveeta cheese as a main background can't help but be yummy. The freeze-dried brocoli barely came close to remsebling the real thing in looks much less taste. My end results didn't look anything like the picture on the front of the box but it tasted fine.  I do think Hamburger Helper is better in capturing flavors and more satisfying in the fill-you-up department but this is a good attempt at the same thing.  Would I choose it over another, probably not.

review/summary: Delish!
review/text: My family loves Velveeta shells and cheese as a side item with our dinners. We were excited to try these new dinner kits. This product was awesome. The cheese sauce is so much better then the powder you get with other pouches. The seasoning packet adds just enough flavor to make the dinner have a little something else going on in your mouth. The only thing I would have done beforehand is making some extra broccoli on the side to add to everyone's plate before serving. The broccoli in the kit is diced really fine and you barely taste it. This product is definitely recommended for a good, quick meal on a busy night.

review/summary: Broccoli Dust?
review/text: Wouldn't it be nice if the picture on the box was what you would actually end up with?<br /><br />Don't be mislead by advertising of Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillet Dinner - what you get is yellow mush with little flakes of broccoli dust.<br /><br />The directions and cook times are easy to follow, just wish that they had been more specific with "reduce heat" - to what?  Low, simmer, medium low.  When I opened the package to add the dehydrated broccoli flakes, I knew that disaster was imminent.  This now made the product look like I had just sprinkled ground black pepper on it.  No healthy color to tantalize the brain, so I quickly steamed some "real" broccoli mixed it with the rice and chicken concoction before adding the pouch of cheese.  Now, there was some interest.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised that there was not an overabundance of saltiness but the product overall does have the processed chemical taste.<br /><br />My final judgment is that I do not think that this product will find its way back to my pantry, there was no visual appeal and the taste was marginal at best.
