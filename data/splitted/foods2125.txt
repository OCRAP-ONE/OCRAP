review/summary: The spiciest chai
review/text: I am a chai snob. I love chai, but have demanding standards about what I will and won't drink. Most lattes are too sweet and not spicy enough for me. This tea is far and away the most spicy, full of a rich flavors of cinnamon, ginger and cardamom, and yet, it has a very sweet note as well, probably because of the carob. The oolong tea leaves allow you to steep it long enough to get a strongly spiced flavor without the tea tannins going bitter. I don't even blend it into milk or add sugar -- I think a strongly brewed cup is perfect as it is. It's great to travel with if you have a strainer mug or brew it before you go, because even as it cools off it continues to taste spicy yet sweet. I much prefer it to Teavana's other chai blends, and over any other chai I've had really. While pricey, I find 2 oz. lasts about two weeks if you drink one large 12oz tumblr of tea a day, and longer if you're drinking an 8oz mug. The used leaves don't rebrew particularly well and take on a kind of "metallic" taste if you boil the leaves to try and improve the weak flavor of the rebrew, but this seems a small criticism of an otherwise excellent and robust tea.

review/summary: Best Pasta Available
review/text: We love De Cecco pasta, but our local grocery chain charges a preventative amount for it. We can get it for a reasonable price through Amazon, and get a bunch of it at once. No downside. So far, we haven't found a comparable pasta, especially for the price, and we eat a ton of the stuff. Perfect bite, perfect taste... if I had a gripe, I'd say that you have to cook it for one minute less than the recommended al dente time in order to get it properly al dente, but once you know that, you're golden.

review/summary: Best Pasta
review/text: De Cecco is hard to find in my area of the country and when I can find it, it is expensive when compared to other brands. The quality is worth it to us but if I can save a few bucks on Amazon why not! The price here is on a par with the lower quality pastas at my local markets. This pasta holds its shape well after cooking, can be cooked and held at the perfect al dente stage and has a nice bite to it, it holds up to baked pasta dishs as well.

review/summary: Great Value and Taste
review/text: Even though the price is always fluctuating it's always been less than I would pay at a grocery store even when that store has a sale.  In my opinion De Cecco makes the best pastas on the market today.  And Penne is my favorite because it's versatile, working well in many dishes, and because it's easier to make sure it stays al dente.  I don't think I've ever cooked it so long that it went to mush though I suppose if you really tried you could do it.  For many years I fell back on spaghetti noodles but then switched to penne never to look back.  I even use it for a less conventional noodles salad with mayo with a touch of milk stirred in and shredded sharp cheddar cheese and a dusting of fresh or canned parsley or basil thrown in.  With the `subscribe and save' ordering you can save another 15% and you'll always have this stable on your pantry shelves.

review/summary: Mmmmm. Good! Nice Pasta.
review/text: This past week, I discovered some 16-ounce boxes of De Cecco Penne Regate pasta on the bargain shelves of my local grocery store. I'd never heard of the brand but it was imported from Italy  and I thought it would be worth a try. Oh my, this was a good pasta! In fact, it was one of the best I could remember. I boiled it about 15 minutes, then added a light olive oil coating plus some cheesy prepared tomato sauce and a liberal amount of sprinkled-on parmesan and a little bit of Frank's Hot Sauce to add a little zest. Mmmmm. Good! Well, the pasta boxes are now all gone from the bargain shelves, but I've got an additional box with spinach to open later. I'm going to have to remember this brand.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: My Favorite Herbal Tea
review/text: I came across this tea when I sampled it in front of Teavana's mall store. I was immediately intrigued by its smooth, yet complex, flavor. It is a very sweet tea and it doesn't require a lot of additional sweetener. I find the agave nectar to be the best sweetener, which also doesn't detract from this tea's flavor, nor does it make it overly sweet.<br /><br />You really have to be very careful about following the exact instructions for this tea's preparation. You need to have the exact measure of tea required, and you cannot steep it in boiling water for more than two minutes - otherwise it becomes bitter. You should also use a teapot or infuser that allows water to flow as freely as possible, sine only then will you be able to extract most of the flavor.<br /><br />You also need to keep this tea in as airtight container as possible. That way it can preserve its flavor for months.<br /><br />Overall, really great herbal tea with a lot of flavor and character.

review/text: I also tried this tea for the first time when I was given a free sample outside of the store. It was amazing! I now drink it every night. I look forward to it so much, and I'm not typically a tea drinker. I make it in the tea brewer (the glass one) that you can buy from Teavana, which is neat because you can watch it steep and the berries and fruit expand with the hot water. It's beautiful and makes the experience so much fun. Love love love this tea! It would be delicious in the summer over ice as well.

review/summary: Worth every penny, and then some.
review/text: As other reviews have made clear, this tea tastes simply amazing. Light and fruity, but not juice-like, full bodied but not overpowering. I drink quite a bit of tea and have made a point of trying many different teas, but this is a genuinely unique experience.<br /><br />I did have a hard time swallowing the price of this stuff initially, but it is well worth its price for several reasons. Aside from how incredibly good this tea really is, it does not take a lot of loose leaf to brew a strong cup. 4 ounces of this loose leaf should brew (rough estimate based on my usage so far) at least 30 to 40 cups. Even factoring in the cost of sweetener if you decide to use any, the cost of a single cup is still well under a dollar. Given the $2-3 cost of hot tap water and a bulk packaged tea bag at the popular coffee shops, this stuff is a phenomenal bargain. It is still pricier than buying a typical box of tea bags in the grocery store, but not by very much, and the product is vastly superior.<br /><br />You can steep this tea twice. I find that one cup of this at night is not enough and usually opt for a second. By using a little more than the suggested 1.5 tsp per 8 ounces of water, your first cup (steep for the suggested 2 minutes) will be delightfully strong, and your second cup (I steep the second one within an hour of the first) will be a bit milder, but still wonderful. The second cup takes a bit longer to steep, around 5-6 minutes, but does not get bitter. The fact that about 2 tsp of this yields two excellent cups makes it an unbeatable value.<br /><br />A few last general observations: this price on amazon is identical to the price in the mall; I paid $18.80 in store for 4 ounces. The salesmen don't seem to want to sell any quantity smaller than that anyway. The sweetener that they suggest (in store at $8 per pound) is german rock sugar. It's not bad, but it seems fancy just for the sake of being expensive. Blue agave, as mentioned by another reviewer, perfectly compliments and enhances the flavor of this tea, if you decide to sweeten it, and is much cheaper. The results you get from strictly following the water temperature and steeping time (175* and 2 minutes) pose a surprising improvement over simply guessing and steeping it in near boiling water. I suggest being precise the first couple times if you're not used to approximating temperature and such.<br /><br />Hopefully this review was as helpful as it was long. Try this tea, you will not regret it.

review/summary: Very Flavorful Great Tea!
review/text: I got this tea with a bunch of others I ordered from Teavana since I had a few gift cards to blow.  I've tried 6 teas so far and this is definitely my favorite.  It's got a perfect amount of sweetness and fruitiness, so that it's not overpowering in any regard.<br /><br />If you need a sweetener with this, which I find that I don't because the flavors are so great on their own, Teavana's german rock sugar goes very well together with this.<br /><br />One side note though, with it being an herbal tea, there is not much actually tea flavor, so if that's what you're looking for, you're probably much better off going with something else<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: I am not a white tea or fruity tea drinker. I like strong brewed black tea and drink that exclusively.<br /><br />I was sent a sample packet of this tea when I ordered some tins and other sundry, so I thought I'd give it a try and all I can say is wow!  It's really good - yes it does have some german rock sugar in it, which gives it a bit of sweetness.  The citrus gives it a bit of tang and it tastes a bit like wassle, but less sweet.<br /><br />I'm all about the black tea, but this particular blend leaves me quite pleased and I'm ordering 4oz of it today.  Give it a shot, even if you aren't normally into the more foo-foo teas like this one's name and blend would leave you to believe.

review/text: I tried this at a mall;  it was excellent but sweet.  I asked if it contained sugar and was told that it did not.  Checking the website upon returning home - after having bought it - I found that it did.<br />That aside, this is just an excellent tea .... even for non-tea drinkers.  We all think it's good both warm, and especially as iced tea.  I am not drinking it, but everyone else likes it.  There are a lot of teas around, but with a flavour like this one, I can see how this company can afford to invest in retail branded outlets.  Their products are fresh and natural.  Just wish they'd let you add your own sugar.  (And I wish I knew years ago how much that really matters.)

review/text: Fruity teas aren't usually my "thing." I got this as a free sample with my Teavana order. Delish! Note - the instructions (at least on the sample) were peculiar.

It's fruity, but not too sweet. Would probably make a nice iced tea. So far, I've only had it hot.<br /><br />I described it as a happy tea, because it kinda' makes you feel happy. It's not overly relaxing, nor is it overly energizing. It's just kinda' gives a blissful chill. :)

review/text: Personally I usually find Teavana to be overpriced and not really worth it. I tried a couple of their fruity black teas and there was so much more fruit than black tea in it I literally had to brew it like it was an herbal tea rather than a black to get any real flavor out of it.  I am able to find better teas at half the price elsewhere like Amanzi tea or The Tea Palace,  but this blend of theirs is really fantastic and I do love it.  And yes- the blend does contain sugar so you should know that before putting any sweetner in your first cup.

review/summary: Crazy expensive but worth it
review/text: I was introduced to this blend as a free sample with my first order from the company's website. As I was drinking the last cup I immediately went to order more. Teavana is sooo very overpriced but this particular blend is worth the insane cost. I'm generally not a fan of fruity blends or goofball yuppie health claims. I don't much care for the rest of their blends and the straight up green and black teas are certainly not worth what they charge for them. But... this one is a staple in my house. If you buy a pound from their website you get ten percent off and you can usually find a code for another ten percent discount if you search for it. For around fifty cents per cup it's totally worth it to me. With or without sugar, hot or iced, this tea is delicious any time of day. I love to brew it in a glass cup in order to see the beautiful color. The smell is intoxicating and has managed to lure the coffee-lovers in my home over to the dark side. Give it a try. I think you'll like it.

I am very happy with Pacific... both the beef and the chicken low-sodium broths.

review/summary: Good Seasons Italian Salad Dressing 7.6 oz pk
review/text: I have loved this product since the 1970s, when you could get it in individual packets.  If you believe you still can buy Good Seasons Italian in packets and this is the same product, you are about to find out why the restaurants' Italian tastes so much better than when you buy a packet and make it at home.  Some time in the 1980s Good Seasons decided to "improve" their single packets of Good Seasons Italian by reworking the recipe (kind of like "New Coke" changed the flavor in order to utilize high fructose corn syrup instead of sugar) while the company allowed these 7.6 ounce restaurant "Food Service" packages that each make a gallon of salad dressing to remain the old recipe.  Even if you only want to make a single bottle rather than a gallon, no problem---buy this giant envelope, then every time you make a 16-oz Good Seasons decanter with the vinegar, water, and oil markings on the side, just measure out one tablespoon (1Tbsp) of the powder from your 7.6 oz envelope and it equals the single pack contents in the older, better flavored recipe packets! As an added benefit, it costs less than purchasing all those little packets.  Purchasing from Amazon made it an even bigger benefit for me, as for years I was required to buy a carton of a dozen at a time from the local food service supplier, which entailed a big financial outlay and driving 25 miles to the warehouse.  I love going to my computer and purchasing just three envelopes at a time---even better, getting  two units totaling six envelopes meant I didn't have to pay posstage, so it was even a better buy than when I picked up a carton at our local food service warehouse!

review/summary: GOOD SEASONS DRESSING WITH MSG!!
review/text: I have to laugh at Nancy Kress' (5 Star) review.  She thinks this foodservice pack "tastes better" than the retail pack.  Perhaps it does, but keep in mind that it contains a substantial amount of MSG!  Many people are outright allergic to MSG and suffer serious reactions to this ingredient.  Some of those symptoms (according to the Mayo Clinic) include: headache, flushing, sweating, facial pressure or tightness, tingling or burning, fluttering heartbeats (palpitations), chest pain, nausea, and weakness.<br /><br />For these reasons we do not consume MSG and I recommend to my family and friends to avoid MSG like the plague.  Many Chinese restaurants have discontinued using this product and post notices to that effect - that's how widespread a problem this is.<br /><br />After reading Nancy's misleading review here on Amazon I purchased this product not knowing about the MSG content.  Nancy's current review makes it sound like Kraft changed other ingredients in the retail (smaller packets) product to lessen the product's good taste.  All they actually did according to their customer service dept. is remove the MSG from the retail packet formula.<br /><br />She is right about one thing - the foodservice pack yields a much cheaper product per serving. The truth is the only difference I could find was that the foodservice pack contains MSG and the retail package does not.  We love the retail product and this is the only commercial salad dressing we use.  I can't speak to the taste as we threw out the product once we saw that it not only contains MSG but contains quite a bit of this "flavor enhancer." It is 3 or 4 ingredients from the bottom of the list of ingredients which are shown by weight.<br /><br />I spoke with Kraft Foods, the parent company that owns this label and they said that the MSG was removed from the retail product years ago.  No doubt because retail customers get to read the ingredient labels while the only people in the foodservice business that might read the ingredients would be in the kitchens of restaurants.  The poor unsuspecting restaurant customers are getting a substantial dose of MSG without ever knowing about it.<br /><br />The customer service rep at Kraft said that they may remove the MSG from the foodservice formula someday soon given the known health concerns about MSG.  However, she could provide no firm date.<br /><br />If I could give Good Seasons Dressing in the Foodservice (7.6oz pack) 5 negative stars I would do so.  AVOID THE 7.6 OZ until they remove the MSG!<br /><br />On the other hand I give the Good Seasons Italian Dressing Retail Pack (.7oz pack) 5 positive stars as an excellent product I have enjoyed for years.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4DNY">Good Seasons Salad Dressing & Recipe Mix, Italian All-Natural, 0.7 oz., 4-Count Packets (Pack of 4)</a>

review/summary: Not the low carb option I was hoping for
review/text: I love hot cereals and miss them in my low carb lifestyle. This product sounded like the answer to my cravings, and I waited eagerly for it to arrive. Upon arrival I whipped up a batch, which means I added boiling water to the measured about of cereal, stir and wait. I happily added a dab of cream and 2 packets of Splenda after the allotted time had passed and sat down to enjoy! Only, the enjoyment part did not happen. This cereal tastes like they used the shells and hulls from the nuts and grains to make it, not the nuts and grains themselves. It was bitter, it tasted just like walnut shells and had pretty much the same texture as ground walnut shells would. I have eaten some pretty strange things to kill carb cravings, and most of them are OK if not delicious, but this was unfortunately inedible. Even my garbage disposal dog turned up her nose at it. I am sorry, I really wish this had been what I was looking for, or even edible, but this was a big miss for me.

review/summary: This drink will blow your mind!!
review/text: If you love coconut water, and you love coffee, then this drink will blow your mind.  It's amazingly delicious, not too sweet and has the yummy somewhat nutty flavor you love in coconut water.  I could literally drink a case of this a day, if my budget would allow it.  I haven't tried it as a mixer yet, but it's on the agenda.  I'm sure this would taste awesome with some Bailey's or Kahlua!!

review/summary: YUM YUMMY Yum Yum
review/text: If you're looking for a really strong coffee flavor... not so much. The coffee flavor is recognizable, but less than regular cup of coffee. The sweetness is perfect. It takes the 'can-be-kinda-like-chewing-palm-tree-bark-flavor' edge off the Coconut Water without making me feel like I need to run for my toothbrush immediately after drinking. This one is already on auto-ship so that I have at least one-per-day. I bought some of these for my Nephew as well because he is a very active 20-something who really needs to maintain his electrolyte balance (been hospitalized twice ... serious business) and Coconut Water does the trick naturally ... not like those chemical-laden 'sports' drinks. And he's a coffee drinker so he didn't crinkle his nose up at something 'healthy'<br /><br />Notes for ultra-health-nuts:<br />1. This is not NOT an organic product<br />2. It is sweetened with evaporated cane juice (OK not so bad, but it's not organic)<br />3. This product has milk in it<br />4. The final ingredient on the list is "natural flavors" hmmm ... that can actually (legally) mean MSG! I'm not really sure exactly what they're hiding in the "natural flavors" label and this would be the only reason I'd cancel my auto-ship ... the minute I get wind of MSG, I'm out.

It tastes great and is a nice alternative to hot coffee in the warm Texas summers.  I've replaced my morning coffee on my drive in to work with this!  I'd try an individual one first if you can find it locally before you invest in 12 though, just in case it isn't right for you.

review/text: This snack is the best one we have found for my two dogs. They love them. But it is a slippery slope to the big 37oz Jar. I started out with the small pouch but that soon did not last very long so I picked up the next larger size and we made it a few days. So now we have to get the 37oz size to keep from going to the store every week. I have yet to meet a dog that didn't go nuts for this snack. If I run out of it there is a lot of complaining until I get more so buy plenty.

review/text: I don't know where the other reviewer got the idea that this is "compressed yeast." It comes vacuum sealed so it feels like a solid block until you open it. Then it pours and measures like any other yeast. Kept in a sealed container in the freezer, this yeast will remain good for years.I use it for bread every week. At one point I stopped baking for several years and when I went back the yeast (in the freezer) was still good. Apparently the expiration date applies when used by professional bakers who leave the yeast out in open containers.

review/text: I was just making pizza dough and noticed that I am down to about a 1/4 cup of this yeast.  Then it occured to me that I have been using this same package for TEN YEARS.  It is still vital, having been kept in doulbe ziplock freezer bags all this time.  It has even survived a move.  Is it a good thing to keep it around this long?- I don't know.  I can only tell you that it still works!  Keeping it dry and in the freezer must be the trick.<br />I go though phases of baking a lot, then not at all, but there's tons of yeast for your dollar, here.  It's a very consistent product, too.  It seems to have a much broader tolerance for temperature ranges, so that I don't need to be overly concerned with the exact temperature of the liquids I add it to, nor the temperature of the place I let my dough rise.<br />Really a great value.

review/summary: Reliable
review/text: If you love using your bread machine and want a reliable yeast that does not need to be proofed (can't remember the last time I did that), then this yeast will make your life much easier. While this is not a rapid yeast, the bread does seem to rise more quickly than with packets of yeast from the grocery store. This saves time and gives you an empowered feeling instead of the "Is this going to rise or not?" feeling.<br /><br />The yeast can be stored in the refrigerator or freezer and is very convenient to use. Unlike the yeast cakes, you don't have to worry about mixing it with water or milk. You just measure it into the bread machine.<br /><br />Here is the recipe I love making for Focaccia bread. It turns out wonderful and you can start it in the bread machine or make it by hand. We serve this in slices or squares topped with butter and fresh rosemary or an herbed cream cheese. Perfect with homemade soup in the winter.<br /><br />Focaccia for the Bread Machine (start in machine, finish by hand)<br /><br />2 1/2 cups water<br />2 tablespoons SAF instant yeast<br />2 tablespoons sugar<br />2 teaspoons freshly crushed sea salt<br />2 tablespoons olive oil<br />6 cups all-purpose flour (the Baker's Catalogue sells an amazing flour)<br /><br />Measure the water, yeast, sugar, salt, olive oil and flour into the bread pan. Program for white bread, dough cycle and large loaf. After the dough has been kneaded, you can put it in a large stainless bowl and cover the dough with a damp cloth. I normally forget it is in there and catch it just before it is about to rise over the top of the pan, so it still works, either way. You could also use half the ingredients for just one loaf if you want to let it rise in the bread machine<br />pan.<br /><br />Let it rise until double in a warm place. My secret it to turn the oven on and then almost immediately off (just leave it on until you feel some heat on your hand) and this seems to create a "just warm enough" environment for bread to rise. Punch down and divide into thirds. Roll out two squares and one elongated loaf. This works well on the regular size cookie sheets. If you have a larger cookie sheet, you can roll the dough into two 8-inch squares.<br /><br />Make deep indents with the end of the rolling pin handle at regular intervals. Then brush with olive oil. Let the bread rise until almost doubled.<br /><br />Either sprinkle with sea salt or sprinkle with dried or fresh rosemary and sea salt. You can also top the dough with tomato slices, onion slices and sliced and pitted Kalamata olives before baking.<br /><br />Bake at 400 degrees for 30 minutes.<br /><br />After the bread cools, it will slice easily and it freezes very well. I normally slice two loaves and cut one into squares for sandwiches.<br /><br />To make an Herbed Cream Cheese: Blend together 1/3 cup butter, 1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, 2 teaspoons dried parsley, 2 teaspoons dried rosemary and 1 teaspoon dried thyme.<br /><br />The idea for this bread came to me after visiting a sandwich shop at a garden center in Seattle. After arriving home from visiting my grandmother, I knew I had to try to make the cream cheese and the bread because they were perfect to serve with homemade soup.<br /><br />This bread has a lot of possibilities so you can vary the toppings to suit the types of soups you are serving.<br /><br />The Instant yeast always works and with a bread machine, you end up feeling like a professional baker. The results are sure to impress. The bread always has a "fresh from the bakery" taste unlike the taste of breads made with packets of yeast from the store.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: good bargain
review/text: I been purchasing the small envelope yeast packages for a while now, and it's getting really expensive (around 3 dollars for three envelopes). Including shipping and handling, this makes it worth the purchase, as it would of cost me around 64 dollars to buy the same amount vs the 12 dollars to buy a pound. The yeast itself was great and worked wonderfully. :) I am very happy with the product. A pound may sound a lot, but if you're an active baker, it shouldn't be a problem. :)<br /><br />Edit: The original review was on August 6, 2009 and today is November 25, 2011. I have been using the SAF yeast ever since I purchased it with 1/3 of the bag left. I have been keeping the bag in the freeze since i had open it up without any problems. The freezer trick is to keep it from reacting from the moisture in the air and extend the useful life. The yeast had expired on April 2011, yet it's still going strong. The yeast are not as active (slightly noticeable if you pay attention, but that is only during the fall/winter as expected) as it was when the package was freshly open, but still better than the grocery store ones). I used it for hand knead dough and bread machine recipes, and they worked well with both.

review/summary: Great for the bread machine or any other yeast needs...this is NOT compressed yeast, it's regular granular.
review/text: I agree with the other reviewers who noted that there was some misinformation about this being compressed yeast by someone who hadn't opened the bag yet. (grin)  Just like some coffee bags have all the air sucked out which makes the bags feel brick hard until you open them at which time the grains flow smoothly...this is no different. It's done that way to make this yeast MORE fresh than those bagged with air still trapped inside which, of course, breaks down the yeast. This packaging is a good thing.<br /><br />I have a friend with a bread machine who noticed that I am into handmade homemade bread now...I'm whipping through bread recipes from two cookbooks a couple times a week and enjoying the freshness of homemade bread.  Because one of the authors of my bread cookbook won the highest award given for his breads and he wrote an entire foreward on using instant yeast and why you should and I was discussing this...she recommended this particular brand for both it's results, value, and taste from her own bread.<br /><br />I am an apt person to be able to compare because I've been using Fleishman's for a good while now and maybe it's my imagination, but I swear the LaSaffre gives me far better results. Because of freshness? Maybe. But it does.<br /><br />I have also found it at restaurant supply stores and I look at that as a good thing if bakeries buy it in bulk...<br /><br />Negatives: None as far as quality. Just know this is quite a large bag and you don't want air to break down your yeast so you either need to go through it quickly or store it in the freezer to maintain freshness if you aren't whipping out bread as fast as I am.  :-)<br /><br />Conclusion: Seems to work better, last longer, and is bagged for freshness while being cheaper. Worth it.

review/text: For years I've been baking all my breads with this yeast. I can use less per recipe, it never fails to raise the bread, and buying in bulk is cost effective. A very dependable product! I keep some in a glass jar in the refrigerator, the rest in the bag put into a freezer zip-bag in the freezer.

review/text: Yeast is not very exciting to many people but it is to me... it did what it was supposed to do. It Rose Up and created great bread!What more could you for from yeast. Oh except that my son now makes his own pizzas and calzones because this yeast was easy enough to use and cheap enough for him to afford a him a few "learning" experiences with yeast baking!

review/summary: Best on the market
review/text: I discovered this yeast nearly 20 years ago and have used it ever since.  Of all the yeasts tested at King Arthur Flour test kitchens, this is the one THEY recommend and that's good enough for me.<br /><br />This yeast will keep well beyond the expiration date if sealed in a freezer bag and placed in the freezer.  I keep a small jar of it in my fridge for daily baking and the rest in my freezer with the purchase date marked on the front, then simply refill my jar as needed.<br /><br />I've never once had a failure with this yeast.  To use, simply  omit the "proofing" stage.  Most recipes use measured yeast but older recipes call for packages.  Two teaspoons of SAF Instant is equivalent to one package.<br /><br />Many assume Instant Yeast and Rapid Rise yeast are the same . . .however, they are not.  Instant Yeast merely omits the proofing stage and is recipe ready as is.  Rapid rise causes the dough to rise more rapidly, but what's gained in time is lost in flavor as the fermenting stage is decreased.

review/summary: Good product
review/text: Tired of buying the little packages of yeast I looked for another alternative.  Baking bread is a regular hobby so a pound of yeast is going to last a long time and I was concerned about shelf-life.  After doing research I found that this product kept in an airtight container in the freezer will last forever so I took the plunge.  I'm very happy I did.  I no longer have to worry how much yeast I have at home while picking up things at the grocery and the product does exactly what it's supposed to:  make bread rise at a fraction of what I was paying for those little packages.

review/summary: Good Yeast
review/text: This is good yeast. I bought a four lb pack and I'm on my third pound now. It's never failed to work. It is NOT compressed yeast as another reviewer claimed. It's normal yeast just like you'd buy in the little packets from the grocery store. It is an instant yeast so there's no need to proof before you combine with other ingredients. One complaint is that the yeast is a little old - the batch I got expired about 13 months after purchase.

review/text: I love this Galaxy Granola product and have been purchasing for years at the grocery store.  I took advantage of the lower price offered on Amazon and bought a box of 6.  Unfortunately, the contents of each bag have a musty odor  which is not present in bags that I buy in the store.  The expiration date is current and the bags are not damaged.  I can't explain why this has happened, perhaps the storage facility is damp.  Anyway, I think I will buy at the store from now on.

review/text: All the Wylers singles to go are great!  They taste good and mix easily in bottled water.  Most places are overcharging for this item.  Walgreen's sells a package of 8 for $1.00 (or less; It was $0.59 a package of 8 over memorial day).  Most of my boxes had printing on the box indicating $1.00 per box.  I see some places charging over $2 per box.  At that rate, you can buy a 12 ounce can of soda (even big brands when they are on special,) and you get the can and the water included! So why spend that much just for the powder?

review/text: A great coffee for every day... make it with less water for a delightful espresso, and add more water for that great americano coffee.  It;s not too bold, and its not a weak coffee - which I hate, so enjoy the versatility of this brand.  I mostly use it as an espresso with scalded milk, or cheat with a dollop of whipped cream and a hint of cinnamon on the top.  Any way you use it - you will love its bold flavor and satisfying taste without bitterness and odd aftertaste.  You can buy this with confidence and you will love it.  Many happy days of coffee moments will come from this delightful brand.

review/summary: Best k-cup coffee out there!
review/text: My husband and I both love coffee and so when we bought the keruig coffee maker we were very happy with the "ease of its use" but concerned about finding a coffee that we would both quickly like because the k-cups are a bit expensive and everyone who sells them have limited flavors to choose from. We also did not want to experiment to much. However, after much research on reviews we took a chance on this one and must say we love it. Its bold without being bitter and overall has a great taste.  We drink it with and without milk and its delicious either way. For me this coffee is especially good because as a Latina I found in it in some of the flavor I find in the coffee's my mom makes at home (such as Bustelo, el Pico etc).  It is now the one flavor we are loyal to, though we are trying others.

review/summary: Pretty good stuff
review/text: First of all I have to admit I've been pretty much spoiled on the Newmans own. I don't think there is a coffee out there that can top it. I picked up the Timothy's to see how it compared and to try something different and I like it a lot. However I would have to say so far my favorite from the Timothy's line of coffee is the French Roast Decaf (Yes, i said Decaf). I would not hesitate to buy this again, it's really good coffee. Honestly if you haven't tried it though, I would buy one of the smaller box's of it to try. I did this with a couple others that I found that I really didn't enjoy and I was happy not to have 50 of them sitting on my table.

review/summary: I love this coffee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: I've tried every k kup made,and I have experimented with more than several k kups. This particular k kup is great because, I like to buy flavored syrups,and I buy the mocha powder from starbucks.I use these particular k kups to make homeade mocha and cappuccino. I just heat a cup of milk add my favorite flavoring,and I toss in a small shot of one of these little guys. I top with milk, whipped cream,and I am ready to go...Excellent!!!!
