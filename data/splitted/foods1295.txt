review/summary: Damaged/colored hair Conditioner
review/text: This is the matching conditioner to the shampoo I also used and reviewed.<br />I liked this also, worked nice w/the shampoo, gave my hair a bit more<br />smoothness.  I am not a scientist, so all the additions of the vitamins<br />and other goodies I am sure are good for my hair and scalp...I just go<br />by how my hair/scalp feel after the use and the scents...its a big YES<br />to this product and its matching shampoo.  Again as I stated in the<br />shampoo review, I love the shape of this products bottle, a plus for<br />a small arthritic hand...even though I am sure that was not why it<br />received its shape, I appreciate that its not one of those huge tall<br />round bottles.

review/summary: Excellent product
review/text: My hair is very fine, so I am very careful about which conditioner I use. I need one that will make my hair soft, but not greasy. This conditioner fit the bill. My hair feels very clean and soft without feeling like it has a ton of conditioning product in it. It also seems to be more shiny since I've been using this.

review/summary: Good conditioner
review/text: I've been using this product along with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR89S">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Damage & Color Repair Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a> for two weeks. I'm very satisfied with the two as a pair. My only complaint about this conditioner is that it's fairly thin. I prefer a thicker conditioner that feels like it's sticking to my hair. After I rinse it out, my hair doesn't have that ultra-smooth, luscious feel to it ... but that's a minor quibble. This conditioner does its job, and I'm satisfied.

review/summary: Great product with one tiny flaw
review/text: I've been using CLEAR Conditioner for a couple of weeks now and it does what it says it'll do.  I have very long hair and CLEAR has cut down on the frizzies to an incredible degree.  My hair looks healthier and feels better than it has in a long time.  Highly recommended for those two attributes alone, and an added bonus is its lovely lingering fragrance, not overwhelming at all.<br /><br />The only drawback to this product I've found, and this is probably because my hair is so very long, is that I've developed some nasty snarls at the nape of my neck.  They're fairly easy to untangle, but they're there and didn't used to be.  The first one could have been an anomaly, but three or four a week is not.  The only thing I've changed is to use the CLEAR.  It's not a deal breaker, but worth a mention.<br /><br />I'd rate CLEAR four and a half stars but since that's not an option, I'm awarding it four.

review/text: I'm always careful about products for my color treated "naturally blonde" hair. This conditioner is thick, goes on smoothly, has a fresh and very pleasant scent and does a very nice job. My hair is silky and smooth after use, and I've noticed it doesn't get so flyaway in humid weather. This goes great with the matching shampoo, of course. Highly recommend.

review/text: I really like this product. I have curly hair which I color and it frequently has a slightly damaged appearance unless I use a host of products on it. Clear Scalp conditioner has a light, pleasant smell (in fact, I wish it was stronger.) It makes my hair very soft and looks better after only two uses. I recommend this product because if it helps my hair, chances are good it will yours also.

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: I like the shampoo, and I'm happy to say that I like the conditioner too.  I like that it works without having to use a handful of it.  Some conditioners just do NOT work on my thick hair and I end up having to dump half of the bottle onto my head just to be able to run my fingers through my wet hair.  But not with this stuff.  Happy to report that it works well and you don't need a whole lot of it either.  I'm also happy to report that my blow drying and straightening time is fairly quick and my hair seems to stay less frizzy so far.  Good product.

review/summary: Very Nice Conditioner
review/text: Having also reviewed the shampoo which accompanies this conditioner, with comments which apply to the products used together, I will summarize my previous review.<br />Clear Scalp and Hair conditioner is packaged very nicely in a bottle which is inverted and opens from the bottom. It is very easy to get the conditioner out of this bottle, unlike some conditioner bottles.<br />The conditioner has virtually no odor, and feels soft and creamy.<br />It distributes well and rinses easily from my hair.<br />My hair is nice and soft after blow drying and flat ironing, although it is a little fly-away.<br />I really like this shampoo/conditioner combination, but it does not help with frizziness, which my hair has a tendency to, especially since I live in very humid Florida.<br />I will be trying some leave in anti frizz products, which, if they work, will make these products really good.<br />Both the shampoo and the conditioner are priced very reasonably.

review/summary: Excellent product at a great price point
review/text: I am usually not overjoyed at trying new haircare products because once I find something that works, I stick with it. But Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Conditioner was well worth it! I recently had a great color job done on my hair and this is preserving it so well. My hair feels softer- yet manageable. It's shiny without the greasiness and smells wonderful. I am going to buy the shampoo now simply because the conditioner is wonderful. I have short, thick hair that I color and use a quarter sized squirt to cover my hair. It will last a while because it's not runny like cheap conditioners.

review/summary: Soft Hair & Legs!
review/text: If you didn't know that conditioner can also double as a shaving lotion, you do now. It's a great cheap(er) alternative to buying shave lotions or gels and IMO works way better.<br /><br />As a hair conditioner, Clear works really nice. My hair feels just so soft and silky after I use it for just one day. The only thing I'm unsure of (and I have noticed this with some other conditioners, but not all) is that after I use it I seem to shed a LOT of hair. So, that's why I didn't give it 5 stars. I do love the way it makes my hair feel, though.<br /><br />Given how soft and silky it left my hair I decided to try using it so shave my legs. Doing so gave me a really nice smooth shave but also doubles as an in-shower lotion, leaving my legs feeling super silky smooth and soft.

review/summary: Feels great & Smells good
review/text: I have been coloring my hair for at least 20 years.  I started graying way too young and the many years of color processing has left my long hair prone to being dry & brittle.  I am constantly on the hunt for a moisturizing conditioner that leaves my hair healthy yet lightweight.  I tend to switch up my conditioners and use 2 or 3 on a regular basis.<br />I tried this new Clear conditioner with the usual skepticism I have for every hair product.  I was pleased with the first use.  Its smells clean and doesn't have any lingering over powering fragrance.  It rinses clean very easily and left my hair feeling soft.  This won't be an everyday conditioner for me, but it will be a good choice for lighter conditioning days.<br />I wash & condition my hair everyday and I live at the beach so good conditioners are a must.  I will use this again.

review/summary: WOW!!! - Day 2 & I Love This Product!!
review/text: Having a full head of thick, frizzy, long, curly hair, I was looking for a product that would help me get rid of those areas that were just too unmanageable.  I went to the Caribbean and the ocean seemed to make parts of my hair want to "dread-lock".  While to some that may be cute, it was not appropriate for my work environment.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I kept hearing about this product and wanted to give it a try.  The price was worth it.  I figured that even if it didn't work at least I wouldn't have lost a large amount of money as you would on some salon products.<br /><br />Today is the 2nd day that I have used this product.  It is amazing!!!  I got the tangles out with no trouble; nor, did I have to yank my hair out to get the dreads to unlock.<br /><br />I cannot wait to get to day 7!!!  If my hair feels this fabulous on day 2, then I'm in for a treat!!  I am extremely thankful to have such a nice product to use without the expensive price tag.<br /><br />Thank you Unilever for bringing this product to the States!

My hair is naturally wavy curly and thick..... I finally found a solution to my problem I can't wait to get my hair styled to see how much nicer my hair will look good style great products I can't go wrong!!!!!! All I can say to anyone out there considering these products is try them for yourself and you be the judge its affordable and I know you'll just love them if you have problem hair

review/summary: It's clear!  CLEAR is a winner.
review/text: I gave my wife the new "CLEAR Scalp and Hair Therapy shampoo and conditioner for damage and color repair" for her birthday. She is picky about her hair products and has trained me to purchase only those for color treated hair, though she rarely admits to having color added. I've learned my lesson, about her pickiness, when buying shampoo and conditioner, but I dared to try something new.<br /><br />Whew! Did I ever score with CLEAR! She told me "the bottle shapes are so cute, and the open/close mechanism was very secure," something she doesn't always find on her regular brands. She also said she doesn't need to use as big a portion to clean as she has before, making it very economical. She said the suds felt thick, smooth, and it had a nice mild scent.<br /><br />After just a couple days of use, and especially after a full week of daily use, she thought her hair was indeed shinier thatn before, had much better texture, and seemed smooth, manageable, and extremely soft. Usually in the humidity of warm weather she has the "frizzies." When the CLEAR runs out, she asked me to get her more. Boy, do I now have little gifts for future occasions--the jackpot of suprise gift-giving!

review/text: I've been using this conditioner with the accompanying shampoo (clear scalp and hair beauty damage and color repair nourishing shampoo), and together they make a good team for a daily thorough cleaning and conditioning. I actually like the conditioner a little better than the shampoo; it is just the right consistency (rich but not too thick) for a smooth application, and the light fragrance is pleasing. It leaves my dry hair well conditioned; also, the price is very fair.

review/summary: A gentle conditioner, but it is not a deep conditioner for extremely damaged areas of hair.
review/text: I damaged my long hair when I got highlights.  It is pretty dry and brittle.  I have been looking for a conditioner that will be gentle.  I have been using Clear Scalp and Hair for three weeks.  It makes my hair softer and more silky, closer to how my hair used to be but the most damaged ends are still a bit dry.  I like that it is a lighter conditioner, absorbs quickly and doesn't lay as heavy on my hair as most conditioners.  But the floral scent is a bit strong and people with allergies might find a bit much.<br />A gentle conditioner, but it is not a deep conditioner for extremely damaged areas of hair.

review/summary: Clever bottle design
review/text: I've been using both the shampoo and conditioner for a few days now. It has a nice long lasting fragrance. My hair feels clean and soft. I reitterate SOFT. I go the salon on a regular basis to have my hair colored. I use shampoo/conditioner for color treated hair and some have left my hair feeling dry. Not the case  with Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty. It really left my hair feeling soft through out the day.<br /><br />Another bonus: for people like me, who need eye glasses to read and have a hard time deciphering which bottle is the shampoo and which is the conditioner, the shape of both bottles is not only very helpful but is also very clever. Both bottles have a flat spot and you push down for the spot to open and dispense shampoo or conditioner. The shampoo sits up right with the spot on the top and the conditioner sits with the spot on the bottom. No problem with trying to figure out which bottle is the shampoo or conditioner.<br /><br />I liked this product and will be purchasing more.

review/summary: Good light conditioner
review/text: I found this to be a nice, light conditioner with a fresh scent that wasn't overpowering. The instructions tell you to gently massage your scalp after applying the conditioner. I have short, naturally curly hair that tends to be dry, so I generally use a heavier conditioner than this one. But I think this would work well if used regularly on most hair types. I recommend it for everyday conditioning -- it's not a deep conditioner.

review/summary: Nasty scent
review/text: First of all I have to say that based on my initial use of this product very early one morning when I was half asleep, I feel that it's a terrible shampoo.<br /><br />Of course once I realized that it wasn't sudsing I remembered that it was conditioner and reapplied it after shampooing.  It rinsed out well, which is a plus in my book, but I didn't notice any appreciable improvement in my hair.  The shampoo I normally use does a better job conditioning than this did.<br /><br />The worst part, though, is the smell. Like most products made by huge companies like Unilever, it's got a sharply unpleasant odor.  Now I admit I'm sensitive to smells, but this was so harsh I ended up shampooing again that night to get rid of the smell.  The scent is much too strong, and completely phony. I don't honestly know how anyone endures it.<br /><br />I really hate this stuff, but the job it did wasn't wholly bad, so I'm giving it two stars, and tossing the rest of the bottle in the trash.

review/summary: Goodbye Garnier Fructus, Hello Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty!
review/text: I have thick shoulder-length hair that every 3 - 4 months my salonist either colors or highlights (and chops away some of the thickness so I don't look like a wooly mammoth).  For this reason, I switched from using my usual brand, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013L9ECA">Garnier Fructis Fortifying Conditioner Sleek and Shine With Nutritive Fruit Micro Oils, 13 Oz</a>, to this brand.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: This was used in conjunction with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR89S">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Damage & Color Repair Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a>.<br /><br />I rather liked the packaging.  It is a little similar to the Clear Shampoo, but fortunately, I have sharp eyes.  The shampoo itself had a nice, light pleasant smell, and a good consistency (neither too thick, nor too thin and watery).<br /><br />After shampooing with Clear's shampoo, I started out with about a palm-sized amount of conditioner, about the same amount I'd use with my regular brand.  This was adequate for my hair (I did have to use a little more, but I don't know if that was just me, not coating the hair properly).  I left it in my hair for a few minutes, then rinsed.  It took a few rinses to get it all out and seemed to leave a coating on my hair.<br /><br />But the end results were what stunned me.  My hair was delightfully soft and smooth!  After flat-ironing my hair, my hair was sleek and flat in a way that I could only rarely get from my usual hair products.  But the best part was when a coworker approached me and asked if I had recently gone in to have my hair cut and colored.  I told him, no, my last appointment was a month ago!<br /><br />I am now a convert; I'm saying goodbye to Garnier Fructus, and hello to Clear and better hair!<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

review/summary: Love this conditioner!
review/text: I absolutely love this conditioner.  I have long color-treated hair that is thin and fine.  Many conditioners I have tried, including expensive salon ones, have left my hair either straw-like and full of tangles, or else weighted down and limp.  This conditioner leaves my hair silky smooth with almost no tangles.  It does not weigh it down; my hair actually has more volume than usual.  I don't have to use very much of it to get a good conditioning, which is great because the bottle is going to last quite a bit longer.  Also, the fragrance is very pleasant.  I don't have a bad thing to say about this conditioner and plan to continue buying this instead of the more expensive conditioner I had been using.  This is a great conditioner so don't hesitate to purchase it!

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: I have to say this stuff is truly amazing. I figured this was just another conditioner and I have used them all. Not so. We had recently been to the Blue Lagoon in Iceland. The ends of my color treated hair were like straw ever since. The minerals in the water just sucked right into my hair and it was nasty. For the last week I had been using all kinds of conditioners to try to get this resolved. Last night I used this product that came yesterday and VOILA! My hair is soft again and the ends are healed. I would not have believed it if it hadn't happened to me.<br />The container opens from the bottom which is nice because you don't have to wait for the conditioner to run down. My only caution to you is make sure you have it snapped shut tightly otherwise it leaks out.

review/summary: Soft Hair
review/text: My hair is long and thick, and it's dry.  This conditioner made it soft and silky, so it performs well for me.  I suspect it might be a bit too heavy for those with thin or fine hair.  It has a pretty standard hair product smell- not offensive, left a bit of scent on my hair.  It opens very easily in the shower, which is a plus.  The only problem I had was in shipping the bottle opened and it leaked.  As I got this form Vine, my shipping might be different from a regular order.  The bottle really does need to be shrink-wrapped or otherwise held shut, as it snaps open far too easily.  Not an issue for me getting a bottle I didn't pay for, but paying customers will need more effective packaging.

review/text: I had already tried the Volume shampoo in this brand before trying the conditioner;both work well. The conditioner is a nice consistency. The smell is too flowery for me (on both products) a very strong scent. Also, the conditioner bottle has the opening on the bottom of the bottle instead of the top like the shampoo. I'm sure this is to distinguish between the two--but I'd rather just have two different colors. This worked well on my layered long colored hair, but it seemed to make my hair straighter then normal. Maybe I used too much. A good product, except for the strong scent.

review/text: I've never reviewed a conditioner before, but here it goes.  I like conditioner that is thick when squirted out into my hand and then coat my hair.  Conditioner that is thin and slides through my fingers annoys me.  This is pretty thick.  I can rub it over my hair and then drag my fingers through my hair immediately afterwards.  This definitely helps with any tangles and makes my hair feel soft immediately after washing it out.  I'm not sure what to say it smells like, but I like it.  It's not overly flowery.  It also has not had an adverse effect on my color.  I guess the best part of this product is that it is cheap and effective.

The pricing on this product is slightly higher than what I normally pay and because of that I expected it to be a better performing conditioner.<br /><br />I used the conditioner for a full 7 days expecting to see at least some results at that point. Unfortunately I did not see my hair get any better, it actually stayed the same. I know that quite often they suggest using the same brand shampoo, in addition to the conditioner, but I have found that this isn't always necessary to get good results.  No matter how little or how much conditioner I used, I didn't see any improvement. Eventually I had no choice but to go back to my old brand because my hair just couldn't take it any longer.<br /><br />I gave this product 3 stars because I didn't see any improvement, but since I did not use it in conjunction with the same brand of shampoo I didn't rate it any less. Whether that would actually make a difference I don't know?

review/summary: Good Basic Conditioner
review/text: This is a good conditioner, but I don't think there is anything really special about it. It has a pleasant, apple-y scent. It left my hair reasonably manageable, though I still used a leave-in conditioner. I would buy this if it were on sale, but I don't think it's noticeably better than less-expensive products (such as Herbal Essences).

review/summary: Best gluten-free pizza crust EVER
review/text: The Udi's brand gluten-free pizza crust is the best that there is. Yes, of course, it's inferior to a gluten-based pizzeria-baked crust, but this is the equal of any supermarket-sold pre-baked pizza crust out there. And by that I mean it is the equal of any gluten-based supermarket-sold pre-baked pizza crust. It is far superior to any other gluten-free pizza crust out there, many of which taste like silly putty. This tastes just like a good pizza crust. And when you're on a gluten-free diet, a good pizza crust is as good as it gets.

Top with roasted butternut squash, spinach, thyme and goat cheese for a fancy appetizer.  Top with cinnamon, sugar and honey then vanilla ice cream for a kids dessert pizza.

review/summary: Unique and delicious
review/text: For texture and taste you can't beat this rice. This rice is grown in France and is firmer on the tooth than brown rice, with a nutty flavor that's unique. One reviewer was irked because the fine print on the label suggests that there are other grains of rice besides the Camargue rice. If you pour this rice into your hand you'll see that you're getting exactly what you thought you were, so I would respectfully discount this objection.

review/summary: Product information is confused; label misleading.
review/text: This is indeed an interesting product, but the large-print label does not tell the whole story. If the customer reads carefully, the contents are revealed: "Camargue Red Rice is a delicious healthful rice that includes Extra Fancy 100% wild rice, and delicious blends of wild rice, brown rice, and basmati". From this, it is not clear whether it contains Camargue Red Rice at all. Is this packaging statement simply inept while there actually is the desirable specialty red rice as would appear from the picture, or what? I for one would not want to spend this kind of money online just to find out.<br /><br />You will also note that the Amazon description includes the statement "6-Grain medley combines three beautiful and delicious rices with hull less barley, rye berries and black and purple barley" but after a bit of thought, I realized this refers to a different product and somehow was put here where it doesn't belong. That actually is what caught my attention because rye and barley contain gluten, which is off-limits for sufferers of gluten intolerance who often seek alternatives such as these interesting rices.

Add to all kinds of dishes, soups or eat plain; has a nutty wonderful flavor.

Monin also offers a white chocolate and a caramel sauce. All three of these sauces taste fantastic. It comes in twelve ounce squeeze bottle, however I have seen it offered in large pump bottles as well. Monin also offers high quality syrups for your coffee as well.

The flavor left something to be desired, as it had a smokey chemical taste to them which to me was not enjoyable. Perhaps it would be enjoyed by someone else. By the way I love bacon, but this was not bacon.

Factor in I owe a friend of mine a bag(he picked up the last few at an oddball Wallmart that stocked them every now and then) and really not a bad deal for roughly $25.<br /><br />The only thing keeping this from a 5 star review is the minimum quantity.

That's 8,400 calories worth so put it in a hard-to-reach area like in a corner of the attic so you don't eat it all in one setting, because they are addictive.  Conjures up memories of Willy Wonka's factory.  Another sour candy for the sour connoisseurs is called Zours, another modern classic to try.

I really wish there were a way to still get these but not so many bags at once, but for these things I might just get it anyway - they are totally worth it.<br /><br />They are a perfect blend of delicious fruit taste and sour, they aren't SUPER sour so they won't melt you, but I probably wouldn't advise leaving them in the same spot in your mouth for a long time. I do this sometimes to see how long I can last, but moving it around solves any 'burn' or anything immediately and is quite pleasurable spreading through the mouth.<br /><br />I do not understand why these are so hard to find, as even other web shops appear to no longer carry these, it's a shame :(

review/text: My family has been in love with Baci's ever since we lived in Europe.  When my daughters were small they coined the term "Baci Pill" for whenever they were hurt or not feeling well.  They are a wonderful treat, after a meal with espresso or cappuccino.  Pop the entire Baci in your mouth and experience the famous Perugina chocolate and then the still crunchy hazelnut center.  The Italians do everything with class and this beats a Hershey's Kiss any day!

review/summary: Perfectly packaged popcorn for single people
review/text: Say that 10 times fast! It's true though. They really put just enough kernels in the bag to satisfy you without feeling like you should have made 2! I love the Kettle Korn flavor too! If you've never tried it, you don't know what you're missing. It can be very addictive so maybe you better not try. Neah! Go right ahead! It's popcorn - a great healthy snacking alternative to chips, candy, and other junk food.<br /><br />Tip: It says not to use the popcorn button on your microwave which is good advice but if you check that booklet thingy that came with yours (if you can remember which drawer it's buried in) you might find that your popcorn button has multiple size settings like my Samsung model does. All it takes for me is to press the popcorn button 3 times to select "Snack size" and it comes out perfect every time - none burnt or scorched and only a few kernels unpopped.

review/text: I bought this popcorn without reading the ingredients.  I never would have guessed that it would contain artificial sweetener.  I made a bag, and soon had a funny aftertaste in my mouth.  A familiar aftertaste.  Sucralose!  Who would expect to find that in a non "diet" popcorn!  WHY???  They ruined it.  It went in the trash.  We don't like the taste of artificial sweeteners and we don't like the fact that one's body doesn't know what to do with them.

review/summary: Great taste, I was surprised it was this yummy!
review/text: The taste of this kettle corn is mildly sweet, not overpowering & not at all artificial-tasting.  The product I tried was the 94%-fat-free KETTLE CORN, not to be confused with the Butter.  The Kettle Corn has clear white kernals of popped corn, and there is not the first hint of yellow residue anywhere.<br /><br />The best feature:  94% fat-free!  Although I am a bit confused and uncertain over what the actual fat content of a bag is (read the label of unpopped kernals v.s. popped corn--whaat?); as near as I can tell it is 2g of fat per popped bag, which yields approximately 3 cups of popped corn.  Excellent!  Since this is kettle corn, it is a great fix for a sweet tooth that also wants a crunchy snack.  I was pleasantly surprised, & will have this in my cupboard 24/7 for those snack-attack moments without guilt.  Definitely give this one a try!

And it doesn't have that caramelized crunchy sugar coating that I like about Kettle Korn. They carry Orville Redenbacher's kettle korn at movie theaters that tast 100% better then this. Why are they selling this crud to regular consumers then?  I've resorted to making my own kettle korn or buying the pre-popped bags from Trader Joe's.

I thought these crackers would be perfect favors for the kids because it had circus animals on the box. But to my disappointment, when the boxes arrived they were the blue Holiday box with a polar bear on it. (I'm assuming it's because I ordered them in early January? But still!) Plus, they were stale! Ewww. I wish I would've known that's what I would be receiving otherwise I wouldn't have ordered them. I ended up going to Target to buy the original ones.

review/summary: Go Go Goji!
review/text: I took this one to work with me today and it just about saved my life. It gave me the much-needed energy to deal with with busiest doctor in our practice. It was light and sweet and painfully refreshing. I had some while it was hot, but by the time I was able to find time for finish my thermos-full, it was cold. Even better! My thermos is vaccum-sealed, so I carefully shook it to mix it up again and downed the rest...oh yes. This will definitely be an amazing addition to my summer smoothies. Never mind that it snowed today. Anyway, the berryness of this was just right, not overly sweet or fake, just amazingly delicious. I'm only familiar with goji berries in tea, but this is the best goji flavored tea I've ever had. To be honest, I kept taking sips and being surprised by how good it was. I have the memory span of a goldfish, so it was like I given a gift of amazing tea every time I took a sip. If you're a berry fan who isn't really into strong greens, this might be the tea to get you into matcha. It wasn't overwhelmingly bitter like some matchas can be, it was just a smooth, tasty sip for a long workshift.<br /><br />I am very impressed with their matcha, I have to say. My wife recently bought me a matcha whisk (so much easier!), but I was making it with a regular whisk in a cereal bowl and I have yet to encounter a clump. Like someone else said about their matchas, it's not flavoring added to cover an inferior product.

review/summary: Happy Little Dog Loves These!
review/text: My yorkie is bonkers over these treats. Every evening he gets this little twinkle in his eyes for treat time and will sit, heel, and pose like it's a show at Westminster. They are an amazing training aid. Although I am not one to make the leap to "trying" a doggie treat, these do smell like people-food when you open the bag.<br /><br />Other brands purchased at the local pet mega-store were hard and I worried about my little guy choking. They didn't smell as nice either. These are more flexible/chewy and he seems to enjoy them more than the other brands.<br /><br />I just placed my second order of Pet n' Shape Chik 'n Sweet Potato. Definitely worth a try.

review/summary: A sure pet pleaser
review/text: Never found a dog that didn't like this item.  My cats too, but I have to break them up for them.<br /><br />Perfect for a quick little reward or treat.  Great for training also.  Easy to carry a handful. Perfect bite size.  A good company that ships fast.<br /><br />UPDATED, SEPT 29, 2009..I would use caution with any Smokehouse product if it's made in China.<br /><br />The Smokehouse Chicken Strips are the likely cause of the sudden, acute kidney failure in my beloved Kio.  Several days after ingesting the strips he was rushed to the vet. He is dying.<br /><br />Check the web Vet sites and Google Smokehouse.  You will find very negative feedback and info. Several stores pulled them from the shelves and won't sell them. I don't know if it includes any other Smokehouse product, but there's too many treats made in America, not China that I can feed my pets without poisoning/killing them.

review/summary: In Jan. 2009, the price of these nearly doubled ... why?
review/text: My dogs seem to like these treats, and the ingredient list suggests that there are only two ingredients - chicken and rice.  So, I have been purchasing these for a few years now, and both of my dogs like them (although the border collie has grown bored with them and will occassionaly reject them).  However, my concern is with the price of this product.  In Dec. 2008, I purchased this product (1 pound in a tub) for 10.99.  Now, in early february 2009, they have raised the priced to 18.55 - that has nearly doubled, so I won't be buying these unless the price drops back to somewhat reasonable.
