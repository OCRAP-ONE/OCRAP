review/summary: Absolutely addictive!
review/text: This is absolutely the best store-bought cookie I've ever had, with wheat or not.  And it's wheat-free! They are so addictive that I almost wish I had never tried them, as they're not calorie-free.  The chocolate within is absolutely divine and the cookie has just the right texture.  I just had to put them on my Amazon subscription list.

review/text: We bought these along with the Walnut Biscotti, as an Easter treat for our relatives with celiac disease. We decided we had to try them first to make sure they tasted all right. We loved them!! I had to stop my kids from eating them before we could give some to our relatives. You would never know that they were gluten free... they are excellent!

review/summary: OK but ...
review/text: ...the Organic Chocolate Chip Pecan Shortbread 2-Count Cookies (Pack of 12) were within 60 days of their expiration date upon arrival. They were tasty but crumbles, too many crumbs, NOT the nicely formed cookies depicted. I wouldn't buy theses again UNLESS I knew the expiration date was further out. Hopefully they would have an improved taste and form.<br /><br />So my first try with wheat and gluten free cookies was "just OK" :-s

review/text: I am normally not a cookie person-- I usually find them too sweet and too oily-- but these are just perfect!! They have a texture that reminds me of those Chinese almond cookies (crispy and a bit crumbly rather than chewy). I don't have a wheat or gluten intolerance but these are definitely some of the best cookies I have ever tasted. Best of all, the ingredients are 95% organic.<br /><br />Note: There are 9 cookies in the box. I've eaten 7 in the last couple hours, they're that good!

review/summary: Very Good Organic Gluten-Free Cookies
review/text: I got sent a sample of these organic cookies from the manufacturer and really enjoyed them, so I signed up to get an ongoing monthly delivery of 6 boxes. The problem is, I eat them all within a week so I think I need a second delivery for two weeks later. :) The cookies are crumbly and taste a bit like Mexican Wedding cookies. One thing though, the cookies can come crumbled a bit at times from shipping and the size and amount of chocolate chunks vary greatly from one cookie to the next. I found that is okay though, because they are so tasty. I like dipping them in organic rice milk.

review/summary: Best Product in my pantry
review/text: This is one of the most delicious cookies I have every had! The shortbread is indistinguishable in texture and taste from its regular gluten counterpart. The pecans add a nice crunch in the cookie and the chocolate keeps the whole thing from being too dry.<br />My only wish is that the chocolate was not in there in such big chunks, maybe broken down more to a chip size. So that you get more chocolate through out the cookie and less chocolate in one bite. But that's just a matter of preference. As far as taste the chocolate is excellent, moist and high quality.<br />I love the packaging just as much as the taste. The individual packages are just perfect to pop in my purse to have later as light snack.<br />If you have celiacs, or even if you dont, I highly recommend getting this cookie. It makes a delicious treat.<br /><br />Pros: Taste. Handy packages of 2.<br />Cons: Addictive.

Why in the world she passes the plain ones off as shortbread, when they are at best a bland biscuit, and the base dough for these is as close to shortbread as I've ever had, gluten-free.  They have a great flavor, balance of sweet/savory that makes shortbread so good, nice crisp texture.  I would purchase these again.

review/text: I have a female German Shepherd Dog that is now 16 mos old.  Since we got her at 11 wks old, she has been on a lot of different dog foods.  She came to me on Iams but after MUCH research and weighing pros and cons, I put her on Orijen.  Some say, the best dog food you can buy and it's expensive.  30 dollars for 18lbs I think I paid and that was the cheapest I have ever seen it.  I have also tried Taste of the Wild with her and she did eat that and I was going to use it, until I found 4Heath at Tractor Supply that is wheat, corn and soy free.  I figured... wow, 35lbs for 30 bux, not bad.  Get twice the food and it's still good food. Most food are Chicken based and but 4Health Puppy was mostly Lamb based and she seemed to like that more.  We got a second dog and he couldn't handle the lamb, so we had to switch and I ended up feeding them both Puppy Chow, the only thing that the new pup could eat w/o tummy issues.<br /><br />Puppy Chow turned into Dog chow and more issues w/ the pups skin came up.  He was an eater, fat and a pig.  My girl on the other had had always been very VERY skinny.  I had to mix her food to get her to eat.  In the right light, you could see ever one of her ribs and her spine and I was worried would turn me in for not feeding her.  She was THAT thin.  I had already nursed too emaciated dogs back to health, I know how to take care of GSD's but she would NOT eat or gain weight.  She dropped down to around 52lbs at like 11 mos old and she's very tall.<br /><br />After some issues with the puppy, trying grain free to help with the new found itch, I tried eliminated diets and what not.  I turned to Purina One Sensitive Systems and fed him that.  It seemed to help but we ended up having to rehome him due to the growing issues between the two dogs.  My female is a better only dog.  Too alpha for her own good.<br /><br />I got her a bag of Purina One Beef and Rice.  She's on her second bag now and you know what.  She's at a weight now that I don't want her to gain any more.  She doesn't need too.  Her coat shines, she's mostly black and it's very soft and glossy.  Her ear issues cleared up too.  She didn't have an infection, but they didn't look right and were a little junky.  Now that's all gone and her ears look good.  She'll eat the dog food plain, but I still mix some stuff in from time to time.  She loves the beef, and it's been really good for her.  Her stools are smaller and she goes twice a day, almost always.  Morning and night.  No vomiting, no gas, no itch.  Nothing.<br /><br />After a year of trying food, spending money, switching and hours, HOURS reading and standing in the pet stores looking and comparing, I found this food.  She will be on it until she is no longer with us.  I would venture to say that she's upward of 65lbs now, right were she should be.<br /><br />I love this food.  I'm only sorry that I didn't try it sooner and save us all a lot of time and money.  Not every store carries it, but the Orijin I had her on, only one feed store around here carried it.  It's not that hard to find. I don't care if it contains corn, obviously, it's doing her well.  That's all I can ask for.<br /><br />My sister has had her almost 14 year old GSD on Puppy/dog and Senior Chow her whole life.  Purina is doing something right!

review/summary: Formula change in July 2009 is a nightmare
review/text: When I adopted my rescue lab/chow mix, Sammie, the shelter said she was eating Purina One Lamb and Rice. So that is what I kept feeding her without knowing what I know now that I have read this site. But it seemed ok - she had really hard poops sometimes but otherwise seemed great and her coat was soft and shiny, enough so that people commented on it. THEN after the formula change this year, the itching started and the poops became worse (hard more often.) She developed red spots in her ears and a yeast infection in each one.  Then her fur got rough, dusty looking and then started shedding more than anything I'd seen in the 2 years I had her. It seemed like she lost 1/2 her fur! The vets told me this was not likely the new food formula of her same food...well after hundreds of dollars of vet bills and a miserable summer for her all itchy all of the time, I decided to change her food. I picked Halo after talking to a friend who is in to nutrition (people and dogs.) I changed her over slowly - about 9 days. The itching and fur remained a problem...until the day she was only on Halo. Poof! No more itching - that very day no more itching. After a month her fur was shiny and soft but sparce (I'd added Halo's Dreamcoat supplement too.) After 2 months her fur is shinier, softer and more full and lush than ever. Her poops are regular like clockwork and soft - like they never were on Purina One. And she *loves* the food! (I do a mix of canned and kibble.) She has a passion for that food she never had for Purina One - even before the formula change. I wish I'd listened to my instincts and switched the food after the first symptoms! Whatever Purina did to that food is a nightmare.  Read about in on line - you'll see many people have had very bad results since the formula change last summer.

review/summary: my dog loves it
review/text: My cairn terrier was eating the regular Purina One for almost a year.  He had gotten very tired of it.  He loves the darker, soft bites in this, and will pick them out and eat them, and then go back later to finish it off.  He eats all of his food every day now.  I like that he gets the "yummy tasties" but then also the harder food to help his teeth stay cleaner. The price is better than at the stores, and with Prime shipping, is a great savings and getting the pack of 6 at a time saves trips to the store - always.  Puppy says, "woof" which translates that he agrees.

review/text: My 5 year old Japanese Chin (12pounds) is a very picky eater with GERD. She prefers not to eat most days. I have tried many dog foods and this one she eats ALWAYS. She picks out the dark pieces and goes back after to finish the rest. She tends to be a gasy dog and I haven't noticed it get better or worse on this food. The biggest plus is that it has protein as the first ingredient and not a by-product.

review/summary: YUM, This Stuff Is Good! Didn't bother to heat it.
review/text: Dying for something prepared I could eat at work, I bought a can of this yesterday with a bunch of other new items to try, and this was the first can I opened at work. I didn't want to microwave it, so I just started eating it out of the can at room temperature. Yum.<br /><br />It's flavorful, creamy, somewhat chewy, has a variety of different textures in it. (I'd look at it to give you a better description, but I ate it all, and I scarfed it down so fast I wasn't caring too much what it looked like.) It's spicey enough to have some kick, creamy enough to be nurturing, and varied enough to make you feel you've eaten an entree. It's winter now, and this is particularly satisfying. It was so good, I starting surfing for recipes to see if I could make it at home. I don't have most of the ingredients, so back to this stuff. If I had another can, I'd eat it too.

review/text: Jyoti makes the most delicious foods. I consistantly eat these as side dishes or as main dishes and am never dissapointed. Indian food is my favorite cuisine and these are the best pre-packaged Indian foods I have found (and I have tried every brand I can find.) Great way to get a delicious Indian food meal without having to go to a restaurant.  They are very versitile - you can add meats, make them into soups, add vegetables, and the labels come with recipes to make lots of different dishes. All of the varieties of Jyoti are tasty but this one (Punjab Chole) is my favorite. Highly recommended.

review/text: Who would have thought beans from a can could be so darn good?<br />I am one of those healthy people that really likes beans and rice and vegetables and fruits and all the stuff that's good for you.  I also eat VERY LITTLE processed foods and very little canned goods.<br />I'm a mom of 2 boys under 2 and needed to find something quick and easy for me.  I found it!  The spices are a delicious blend and I mix it with a little plain yogurt or mango chutney or raita on hand (all I get from Trader Joe's).<br />The calories are a little high (2 servings in the can at 330cal/svg) but beans are packed with fiber so they fill you up.  This can was 2 servings for me.  I had with a delicious green salad on the side and was quite satiated.  I came back the second night and of all my great leftovers in the fridge I chose the rest of this.  Oh, it is so good!

review/summary: Tasty convenient meal
review/text: I've tried over a dozen different types of canned indian meals, and this is one of my favorites.  On its own, it is mild.  I always add a spoonful or two of a medium or hot indian relish or pickle (eg mango or lime).  It should be eaten with rice.  Once you mix one of these cans of food with rice, it becomes a large enough meal to be well worth the cost per can.  Like most canned foods, it has a lot of sodium.  It is common for some of the cans to arrive dented (I eat them anyway).

review/text: I absolutely love Indian food. Unfortunately, I am the only one I know that does. There is also no Indian restaurants where I live. Quite a downer... This is as close as I have found with premade entrees to authentic Indian cuisine. The Chhole is fantastic, amazing flavor and alot of kick. It is so strong it needs to have a bit of water added and served with rice, or mixed in with other entrees. It can also be used for amazing dips.<br />I highly recommend this to everyone who enjoys Indian food.

From now on I'll stick to paying a bit extra and buying them from the grocery store.

review/summary: Tasty, bit of heat, filling, but where are the potatoes?
review/text: I really enjoy Indian/Pakistani cuisine. When I do go out for curry, I tend to hit the vegetarian menu--Palak Paneer, Matar Paneer, dal, mushroom bhaji, eggplant bartha, and aloo chole being my faves.<br /><br />This is like a canned aloo chole--potatoes and chick peas. The curry has good flavor (though we know nothing beats fresh). It's got heat, but not obnoxiously so. I'd call it "medium" hot.<br /><br />The chick peas have a nice firmness. But I found only ONE little chunk of potato in the can I opened. One. Now, granted, the potato may have simply mushed down into a puree and is part of the thickness of the stew. Still, I think this would benefit from larger chunks of potato to pair with the nice chick peas.<br /><br />Note that there are four servings in the can (according to their measure). I don't think most folks would consider 4 ounces a portion, unless it's a side dish. If you are watching calories, note that to get the full count for the servings calories for the can, you'll need to multiply by four.<br /><br />This is the first of the Jyoti products I've tried. Today, I'm having their potato dumpling stew for lunch. I'll review that accordingly.<br /><br />Enjoy

I ordered it anyway because it will arrive in two days whereas the offer of 3 - 14 pound boxes won't arrive for an estimated 6 days, but I am not happy about paying DOUBLE for the same product a little over two months later.<br /><br />The same thing happened with the pack of 3 - 14 pound boxes. I bought those June 29, 2011 for 20.98 and they are now 34.50.<br /><br />I'm hoping these ARE price "fluctuations" and not permanent price increases.<br /><br />Just thought this would be important information for cost conscious kitty cat lovers!

review/summary: Hernia Inducing Cat Litter
review/text: I used Fresh Step cat litter for many years and was quick to tell any of my cat owner friends that it was the best "bang for the buck" litter. It clumped hard, making the chore of cleaning the cat box a relatively easy one. Sometime around 6 months ago, that all changed. Now, it forms a sludge in the cat box that is nearly impossible to scrape out. The amount of effort necessary to clean the box could easily induce a muscle strain or hernia for those unfortunate enough to purchase this litter. Interestingly, after having this experience (twice, because I thought maybe I just got a bad batch the first time) I turned to Scoop Away which I always considered to be a similarly good product, only to find the exact same thing. What the heck? Turns out both products are made by the Clorox Pet products Co. Consider yourself warned!

review/summary: A cat chooses the litter
review/text: Different cats like different litter sometimes.  The vet told me that even though some litters are better, it may be hard/painful on the cat's feet, causing them Not to use the litterbox at all OR to not cover their poop.  Fresh Step is still one of the best in clumping and controling odor.  The scented is too strong for me (don't know about the cat), so I get the unscented.  Works very well and when scooped daily, lasts almost a month.<br /><br />Drawbacks --<br />1.  Kicks up dust but all litter does to some degree; still, significantly less dust compared to one of those that claims "99%" dust free (cough, cough).<br />2.  I wish Fresh Step would change their packaging (even though it's eco-friendly) and find a way to make the litter half the weight.  These boxes of litter are super heavy (which is why I order from Amazon and have it delivered to my door).  They do come in smaller boxes IF you can find them, but my cat's box needs an entire 20 lb box, much to my shoulders and back's protest.

review/text: We have a small (less than 500 sq ft) apartment and we also take in foster cats for a local rescue. Without the right litter, this can be a recipe for olfactory disaster!<br /><br />Fresh Step Odor Shield Unscented is the best litter we've found for convenience and odor control. Other litters we've tried have smelled really strongly out of the box, and this one's the least offensive. Our cats seem to like it just fine, and it keeps the cat toilet odors well under control. Easy to pour and clumps nicely.  I'm hooked!

review/summary: Great stuff but...
review/text: I love this litter. I always get the unscented and it is fine. It clumps great, price is not too bad and the cats like it too.<br /><br />However, I have been reading that clay litter is terrible for cats. It is not good for their lungs and when they clean their feet, they<br />ingest whatever scents or chemicals are in the clay. Most litter contains sodium bentonite, which is toxic and hard on the lungs. Please<br />read up on this, cat lovers. I have been using Swheat Scoop and it seems to be okay. No offensive perfume and it is a texture the cats<br />do not mind stepping on. It is natural, so even if they clean their feet after being in there, this stuff is harmless apparently.<br /><br />Just a thought!

review/text: By far, the best cat litter I have ever used.  It clumps well so the "used" litter is easy to remove, leaving the rest of the litter pan clean.  It completely covers litter box odors.  I keep two litter boxes in the bathroom and guests always say they can't smell the litter boxes at all.  The best part is that is doesn't have the sickly floral or soapy scent like other litters made by Fresh Step.  This litter is every bit as good as Fresh Step "Multi Cat" - without the nasty odor.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it tracks - but so does every other litter out there.<br /><br />Incredibly, Amazon ships this free (with Prime) for less than I can buy it at Target!

review/summary: Decent cat litter
review/text: I used to buy World's Best Cat litter when my cats were kittens then I switched to Fresh Step after they turned 1 year old. The world's best litter is pricy and does not absorb odor well. My first Fresh Step litter is the original Natural Scoop which is much more affordable and is able to minimize the odor not to mention it's 99% natural. My cats had no trouble adapting to it. But for some reason, Fresh Step stop carrying the Natural line so i had to get the "Perfume and Dye free" which is slightly cheaper and does a even better job with odor control but it seems to be phasing out as well (I checked fresh step web site and they no longer display that line). I'm quite disappointed that they stop producing both these litter. The new Natural pack does not have good reviews... I'm hoping that they bring back the original Nature and continue to produce the Perfume & Dye Free litter.

I expected bull pizzles, but it seems all of the "Red Barn" brand Chew-A-Bulls are reconstituted and not real pizzles. They have gone to great lengths to make the product look like a real bull pizzle, but they are not the real thing and do not last like the real thing. I knew something was wrong when my dog had devoured it within minutes. Close inspection revealed flashing from the mold used to form them and the ends were smooth and uniform, unlike a real pizzle.<br />Bull pizzles aren't particularly cheap, and neither are the cheap imitations like these.<br />I truly felt like I had been deliberately deceived, enough so to warn others.

review/text: I tried these, or something similar from a specialty store when I was a kid and fell in love.  There's not a whole lot of 'different' things where I live.  Anyway I was really happy to find these on Amazon.  They got here very quickly, and were what I expected.  I love the little fruit bits in the jelly that add more texture and the jelly itself is really firm and flavorful (If you like Lychee, which I do). I will be buying more, maybe even try some of the other flavors.

review/text: I'd NEVER heard of these, but I love them.  I got a small cow filled with them from my secret pal at work (now I have to figure out who's been to world market).<br /><br />The flavor is great and I love the coconut chunks in them.  My cow came with strawberry, pineapple and apple.  The strawberry is meh, but the other two are great.  I can't stop eating them!

review/summary: Handy for When Away From Home + Diabetic Friendly
review/text: I am a type 2 diabetic and almost all artificial sweeteners that come in packets also have maltodextrin added to them. Maltodextrin is a filler that generally comes from corn and corn is a simple carb so the packets of artificial sweetener make my blood sugar spike and I have to avoid them.<br /><br />Usually I use Splenda mini's which are tiny tabs of Splenda and contain no maltodextrin. I like the Splenda mini's but sometimes you just need a liquid sweetener. Like when I'm at a restaurant and order iced tea. In the past I've used the Splenda mini's but they take a somewhat long time to dissolve. Cereal is another food where it's nice to have a liquid sweetener (though I've not had cereal since Jan 2012 when I was diagnosed with T2 diabetes).<br /><br />Here's what I like about this sweetener:<br /><br />No maltodextrin or any other substance that can negatively affect my blood glucose.<br /><br />Portable: It comes in a container that's a bit smaller than a MIO (liquid flavoring you add to water) container. It measures approximately 2 3/4 inches high, about 2.5 inches at it's widest point and approximately 3/4 of an inch in depth. If you're female, even if your handbag is pretty small, you could fit a bottle of this in there most likely.<br /><br />The container is easy to open and use. Just flip the top and squeeze.<br /><br />The downside:<br /><br />I didn't take away any stars for price because I feel the seller can set the price to whatever they want. If I don't like the price of something, I simply don't buy it or I look elsewhere. The item is only as valuable as what the market will bear and if it doesn't sell, the vendor will soon have to change the price. Also, even after a price change is made for the better, the low ratings stand and I feel that's not really fair to the product so for that reason, I rarely rate something low because of price.<br /><br />That being said, I must admit, I do think this is expensive and I paid 4.00 less PER CONTAINER than it shows here as of this writing. I paid just under five smackers for the one I bought and thought it was expensive even at that price however, taking into consideration the convenience factor (because I LOVE iced tea all year round and I can't count on getting a diabetic suitable sweetener when I'm away from home), I felt it was worth buying.<br /><br />If I can keep getting this for the price I mentioned above, then I'll buy it again otherwise it's back to the Splenda mini's.<br /><br />One last thing: If you're leery about artificial sweeteners, this also comes in a Stevia version or a Monk Fruit version.

review/text: Im not a big fan of extra strong dark chocolate, but the health benefits are many so I figured I would try a few of them out. This is by far the best one. Actually has more of a sweet taste and any bitterness is hard to even notice. Packed with antioxidants. A few squares a day is a great addition to any healthy diet.

review/text: I order a package of 12 Chocolove Premium Chocolate Bars, which by the way is an excellent chocolate, but when it arrived the bars were bent and melting due to he heat of the delivery truck. I contacted the seller and without questions or argument I was sent another order. I received the order well packed and cold in 2 days. Because I was stunned to see such customer service I contacted the seller once again to offer payment for the UPS cost, but the seller refused stating that their goal is total satisfaction and that I should not pay for the shipping. Just amazing service! I will recommend this seller to anyone and ask to support them. If there were more stars to give I would had given them the max.<br />I hope this review helps.<br />DF

review/text: I love chocolate.  Good chocolate.  I've tried fancy bars, local bars, hand-poured bars, organic bars, and almost everything else, and THIS is my favorite.  The chocolate is perfectly dark without being bitter, the orange has an incredibly satisfying crunch and a slight (very slight) chewiness that makes the texture of the bar divine, and the flavor of orange and chocolate together are heavenly.<br /><br />If only they sold it in more places!

review/summary: mmmmmmfor chocolate lovers you gotta try this one
review/text: I am not usually a lover of dark chocolate, but when a friend gave me this chocolove premium dark (55%) orange peel as a gift, I fell in love with it. So for Valentine's I decided to buy a box and give my special friends a bar for a happy. Now they are all addicted. The orange peel gives it a special little tang and crunch at the end and I would recommend it to any chocolate lover. It was funny that each person said they could not hold out to make it last a whole day like I had challenged them to. It is just too good.

review/text: I treat myself to Chocolove at my local health food store once a month.  I am very conservative on how much sugar I have, so I make one bar last me a whole month.  Yes, it has real sugar, but it is so delightful for the amount of sugar that it has.  A taste of heaven.  I buy the 70% cacao and I am hooked! Seductive bliss!  One more thing, if you are in to dark chocolate, the taste is quite smooth, not bitter as some darks go.

review/text: My husband and I occasionally enjoy a few pieces of dark chocolate in the evening and this chocolate is a real treat. It is hard to find such good chocolate at less than $3 per bar. We order a couple cases each fall and keep them in the freezer till we need a new bar. This is not bitter chocolate and just 1/6 (3 small squares) of a bar is only 80 calories and satisfies our desires for dark chocolate.

Take all your bars, break them up, then try them all.<br /><br />Yeah, that chocolate that keeps evolving and coating your mouth with subtlety and wizardry?  That's this one.

review/text: I also bought this product and I can tell you that I received my shipment in a timely manner and it was worth it!! This cappuccino tastes delicious with no additions like milk, cream or sugar. Just brew it by itself and enjoy the perfect combination of a great cappuccino. Absolutely worth the price and I saved a ton of $$$ by not purchasing from starbuck's..

review/text: This has to be the worst tasting coffee I have ever had in a k-cup. I buy a lot of k-cups this is the by far the worst. Don't waste your money on this product.
