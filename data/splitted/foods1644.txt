review/summary: Order arrived quickly
review/text: I received my order quickly.  However, the gum did not seem as fresh as it could be.  Normally, this gum has a crisp outer coating and when you bite into it there will be a bit of a crunch in the coating.  This gum did not do that.  Don't know if it was a bad batch or it was close to it's expiration.  It wasn't bad enough to return it, so I would say that I was satisfied with my order.

review/summary: 4C green tea
review/text: I love this tea, it has a great taste. The flavor is light and refreshing not overpowering. The are 20 single serve pouches which is very handy and there is no bad after taste. I bought a variety pack of 4C  Tea 2 Go and  this was one of the flavors offered in the box and that was the only reason I tried this green tea. It quickly became my favorite, After looking in every store in my town, I realized the only way to get this particular flavor was to order it online. Therefore, I keep plenty on hand so I don't run out.

review/text: I have learned that Delaware Punch is sold at most Central Markets in Texas for 6.99 for the 12 pack of cans.  The Delaware grape is the reason for the name...not the state of Delaware. Like Fritos and Pace Picante Salsa, it was first made in San Antonio ... this beverage in 1913. I remember it as both tart and sweet with a mostly "grapey" taste. I wonder if the current product tastes the same. Google it for more info.

review/summary: Delaware Punch
review/text: I love Delaware Punch.  I haven't had it for about 15 years because it's no longer sold in CA, but in spite of the expense I just had to have it again.  I would buy it more often if it didn't cost so much and the shipping weren't so expensive.  So, I'm just having a couple of sips a day in order to stretch out my 12-can supply.  I don't know when I'll purchase it again because $25 is a bit much for only 12 cans even if it is the most delicious non-caffeinated, non-carbonated drink I have ever had!  Oh well, maybe my kids will order it for me for my birthday or for Christmas.  They've already looked it up online and can't find a better price for it.

review/text: chocolate is always delicious but in this case the pieces were way to hard.  The candy coating was to thick and it made them kinda hard to eat.  I was afraid that I would crack a tooth!  My husband seemed to enjoy them but he had a similar opinion on how hard they were.  I think they would be better without the candy shell on the outside and instead of a whole almond in the middle maybe some almond pieces.  Im not going to buy these again, Ill just stick with the almond M&M's which are WAY better.

review/text: My dog absolutely adores these. She knows the box by sight. They're great and she doesn't stink after she chews them up like some of the other products out there. I love the limited ingredient list because my pup has several food allergies but she will absolutely devour these. My only complaint is that since the change in packaging from open to boxed up, the bones seem softer and she can chew them pretty quickly. Before the regular size was a good 30-45 minutes or more if she was bored. Now its more like 10-15 minutes.

review/summary: Not what it says it is
review/text: I ordered this product, "Only Natural Apple Cider Vinegar" and the only thing it says is in it is 500mg of Apple Cider Vinegar. Well when I get it its not exactly what I ordered even though when I check my order it says it is. On top of having 500mg of Apple Cider Vinegar it also has 100mg of Grapefruit rind and 100mg of Cayenne for a total of 700mg. Its still made by the same company, Only Natural, but its not what I wanted. It does not mention anywhere on the page that it includes those two other items and if you look at the picture of the product on this page it is totally different then the bottle you get. They either made a mistake or they need to update the page because people need to know exactly what is in the product they are ordering.<br />Other then that the product is fine, I've taken it for 4 days now and it's made a difference in curbing my appetite and helped my heartburn go away in under 30 minutes.

The added grapefruit and cayenne may or may not be contributing to the effect but after 2 weeks my appetite has decreased.  I didn't have much faith but I figured the price was right so I could give it a try.  My weight hasn't gone down but I definately do not crave sweets as much and my energy level is higher and I sleep better. Granted I am working out more so that could be the reason for the better sleep.

review/text: I started taking ACV pills several months ago and can't believe how great they are for so many things.  I have had chronic lower back pain for years, but not anymore!  I can get out of bed and also bend over without pain.  This is a miracle for me.<br /><br />My Mother, who is in her 60's, is having some health issues that are causing her much pain in her abdomen.  After months of suffering and many tears I talked her into taking the ACV pills to see if they would help and her pain got better quicker than I expected!  She ran out of the pills and just a couple days later the pain started coming back.  She had me order her more ACV.  I don't know if they are actually "curing" her ailments, but getting her some relief is a blessing.<br /><br />These pills are amazing to me and my family.

review/summary: Not for my kitties
review/text: I bought this food in hopes to have a cheaper alternative to the Rx Cat Food my Vet gave me. The Rx Cat Food my cats LOVED. But the Purina Pro Plan Dry food was not their favorite...to say the least. They'd be starving before they would start to eat it. I thought maybe they just needed to get used to it...I would mix the old with with new food...and I kid you not, the cats would separate the two and eat the old.<br /><br />With that said, I'm seeing no adverse effects from the food. The cats are all healthy...maybe a bit skinnier which is good. I do not feel I would buy another bag of this. Must keep searching for the effective, cheaper version.

Our cat would not eat the Purina One so we got him this one. He won't touch it either.<br /><br />Ingredients list is almost identical, I think they swapped a 2 ingredients' places in the line, to make it look different when really they are about the same amount and the same formula.<br /><br />Rip off! If your cat loves this, get Purina One, you'll save about half the cost!

review/text: Looking at the label, this appears to be your typical red pepper sauce, nothing more of less special than any other brand.  It's not like red pepper sauces have a huge list of ingredients, so how much can they really vary?<br /><br />Texas Pete has really hit the sweet spot in red pepper sauce blends.  It's robust but not too hot, great for ribs, fried chicken, or Mexican food.  It's like Tabasco, but with a less vinegar-y flavor.  It's very similar to Crystal, but a bit more full-bodied.  La Preferida is good, but this is better.  Definitely worth trying.

review/text: I love my morning coffee but am sensitive to caffeine and must, sadly, limit intake of same. So I start each day with a cup (or two) (or three) of this, with or without cream or flavored creamer, and am happy. This is the best decaf K-cup coffee I've found - it's satisfying and rich, with no bitterness. Compared to my favorite caffeinated coffee, it's probably a three- or four-star product. But compared to the other decafs I've tried, it's definitely right there at the top of the list with five stars. I like it enough to buy it monthly via Amazon's subscribe-and-save, and will keep buying it for as long as I need decaf and it's available. Timothy got this one right.

review/summary: Neither the best nor the worst I've had
review/text: I tend to try to be fairly lenient on decaf since a good amount of my enjoyment of coffee also comes from the zing that the caffeine gives me. However, this is just a mediocre cup of coffee.<br /><br />The flavor in this is decent and while it has a good flavor, I can't seem to find a happy medium for this drink. Unless you put the *exact* right amount of water in, this will either be overly strong or too watery. I didn't deduct stars for this since that's more of a Keurig brewer issue, but even when I get the water portions just right this is still just an average cup of coffee. It's nothing to really write home about.<br /><br />I won't tell you to avoid it, but there are far better decaf K-Cups out there. I'm preferential to the Donut House decaf or just using the reusable filter and making my own cups. (Which is messy and not easily done at my workplace, so I like having the premade K-Cups for work.)

review/text: I've used a Cuisinart Grind'n'Brew for years to achieve the full bodied flavor of fresh ground columbian beans. When Keurigs came out I found that most brands of columbian coffee kcups left me unsatisified. They were tinny and weak. I have a caffeine sensitivity and can only have 1-2 cups of regular coffee each day and then I must switch to decaf for the rest of the day.  Timothy's Decaf Columbian K-Cup is FANTASTIC! I'm so relieved to have finally found a full-bodied decaf coffee.  I have found that the strength is perfect if brewed on the large setting of the Keurig. Thanks to Amazon I can get this at a better price than through Timothy's website.

review/text: I find this brand to have a pleasantly robust flavor without being too strong or bitter. Being decaf, it doesn't get me wired, but it does provide a nice wake-up in the morning and a nice break in the afternoon.<br /><br />A little while after I started the subscription to this coffee they switched from shipping it in four boxes of 24 to two boxes of 50, which makes storage a little more problematic. As a result, I've saved several of the old 24 count boxes to move the K-cup packs into.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy with this product.

review/summary: Bad reviewers not mixing Joyva correctly
review/text: When I read the poor reviews of Joyva it became apparent to me that those reviewers were not using the product correctly. Joyva is a pure sesame paste that has to be mixed properly to make a good sauce. Here's what you do for the best tahini sauce you ever tasted. For a 15 oz can: pour the oil into a food processor; cut the paste into 6 or 8 chunks & put in food processor. Add exactly 2/3 cup + 1/4 cup lemon juice & blend on short bursts till well blended. After this is done, then add exactly 2/3 cup + 1/4 cup water, 1/4 tsp + 1/8 tsp garlic powder ( or 3 minced cloves fresh garlic), and 1 tsp salt and blend in food processor til smooth.<br /><br />I have used only this brand and only this recipe for 45 years and have never failed to get rave reviews. Try it, you'll love it!

review/summary: Easy to get but not the best
review/text: This is the brand I find most often in grocery stores where I live, if I can find it at all. It's a metal can with a soft plastic lid to seal it again once you've cracked it open. I don't know if it's just that the product doesn't move enough off the shelves to be fresh, or it is always like that, but the tahini is heavily separated between oil and paste, the paste ranging from tar to a brick at the bottom of the can. I usually have to chip out a piece of the paste to make hummus, and hope I don't splash the top layer of oil all over the place in the process. I recommend trying any other brand first. This one is for the desperate and out of luck.

review/summary: Sesame tahini by Joyva
review/text: Joyva makes an excellent sesame tahini.  It has consistently been thick, creamy and has a fine flavor.  I use it for making hummus, after-school snacks and salad dressings.  It gives a special nutty flavor to stir fries.  Yes, you do have to stir it when the oil separates, unless you want to use the oil by itself; I think that a small inconvenience for a nutritious and versatile product.<br /><br />I am hoping to find some no-salt-added tahini.  Joyva perhaps still makes that, but I have not been able to find it.  Amazon, could you look into that?

review/text: At first I tried this and hated it. I, too, thought it tasted really bitter. After researching a bit, I learned that I probably just didn't prepare it correctly. I just stirred it as best I could, but I remember there being a lot of chunks still.<br /><br />Tonight, I made it and I put the entire package in the food processor first and mixed it up really well (I'm sure a stick blender would have also worked). Then I put it back in the container and proceeded with my hummus recipe as normal. It was much better and tasted great.<br /><br />While I'm sure that there are better, more authentic tahinis out there, I really think this one is great, and especially great for the price.

review/text: This tahini is a great value for the price.  Mine came in a six pack, and I like that I can store the container I'm using in the fridge while the rest sit unopened on the pantry shelf until needed.  After the container has been opened and refrigerated it needs to be stirred before using, as it separates (all tahini does).<br /><br />This tahini has a very faint taste as if the seeds had been browned too much, but it's not enough to complain about.  I'll order Joyva brand Sesame Tahini again, when this is gone.

Made my usual hummus with the same recipe I always use and simply can't get over the nasty, tar-like, metallic off-taste. Tasted the tahini straight and its definitely the tahini, not the chickepeas or olive oil. Throwing that batch out and taking the can back. Glad to see others have noticed it too, and will wait until Joyva gets their quality control back. Up until this can, it's always been good.

Tahini separates, so it was no surprise to me that it was a solid lump at the bottom of the can with a float of oil on top... it mixed up well so I thought it was fine.<br /><br />NO!  It wasn't!  I mixed it into my hummus mixture and it never EVER smelled nutty and wholesome, like tahini should smell and the smell/taste was worse as it mixed with the chickpeas.  I've eaten the fresh tahini and it's FAR superior...sweet and nutty with a rich texture.... this junk has ruined my fresh chickpeas and wasted my day.<br /><br />NOT HAPPY FOLKS...

review/summary: wonderfully roasted flavor
review/text: We had spent the afternoon roasting eggplant from the farm stand on the grill to make baba ganoush and as we were ready to make it, found we were just about out of tahini.  On a late Sunday afternoon, I went on a tahini run to our local grocery stores.  The first one used to carry it, but has stopped.  I finally ended up at the W-mart grocery and found this stuff in a can.  I've never seen tahini in a can before. I bought it because we really needed tahini.<br /><br />We've tried several brands of tahini in both hummus and baba ganoush.  So far, this has been the best with the most roasted, nuttiest flavor we've found.  And I'm on Amazon to order up more.<br /><br />We did have to stir this stuff like crazy, and we even used our hand blender, on the lowest setting, to get it really incorporated.  I did have to use a fork to get a few bits up from the bottom, which were then easily incorporated by the hand blender.  Once it was opened, we did, however, move the remainder to a jar with a lid, rather than leaving it in the can for storage.<br /><br />We made one of our best batches of baba ganoush ever and I can't wait to cook up some more chick peas for a round of hummus with it.

review/summary: Good Solid Tahini
review/text: I don't know what the problem is with those who don't like this tahini because of how bitter it is: roasted sesame seeds are bitter. If you don't like that, you might want to add sugar or not eat sesame seeds. Some raw brands have a less strong flavor, but that's just a different thing. Joyva tahini is the standard tahini.<br /><br />I have tried several other roasted tahinis this year (2011) in an attempt to explore different options and coming back to using Joyva again after trying several much more expensive brands from our local co-op. Some other brands contain emulsifiers that keep the material from falling out of the oil and hardening, which can make it easier for beginners.<br /><br />Basic recipe: add lemon/lime juice and salt until thin enough to pour. If you are feeding children or people without a taste for the bitter flavor, you might need to add a little sugar. Don't make it sweet, just take the edge off the bitter.

review/text: After receiving my order from Amazon I found all the items specified in the Mini Organic Pet Grass Kit. The instructions were very well written, easily comprehensible for even novice green thumbs and accurate. My wheat grass took a single week to grow approximately 6 inches high. I followed the directions completely! I was astounded at how quickly the grass grew and how healthy the end result was. My cat loves munching on this pet grass! So far he has been eating on it a couple times a day for a week. I've continued to water the grass once a day, so far my pet hasn't killed it! The grass is still approximately four inches in height. I couldn't be happy with this product! I highly recommend it to anyone who own an inside pet, cats especially. I live in an apartment on the third floor where my cat can't get to grass. I was picking him grass and giving it to him but that wasn't good enough. If you have the same problem this is the best bet for you! It truly works!

review/summary: Easy Wheat Grass in Just  Few Days
review/text: I bought this kit for my two rats, to give them something to play with and eat. It was so easy to get to grow. It actually grew a lot faster than I thought it would and if you follow the directions it's pretty fool proof. Within 7 days I had 6 inches of wheat grass ready for my rats to play with and chew on. Great price for this and extremely easy to do.

review/summary: The BEST Mole Trap
review/text: Finally after trying about everything on the market for mole problems in the last 15 years I got lucky and bought this amazing trap. I adjusted and set the trap in the evening after recieving it, next morning I checked the trap and I had caught one of the moles that had been messing up my lawn and garden for about 2 years. I have tried gas, poison,and other traps, always without any known success. The give-away tunnels have always re-appeared. I finally am confident that my problem is over. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RAMY">Victor 0631 Out O'Sight Mole Trap</a>THANK YOU Victor 0631 and Amazon for quick and dependable delivery as always.

review/summary: Worked well for me
review/text: I had a tunnel along my concrete driveway and the grass about 10' long and had 5 mole hills.  I set a trap at both ends.  When I dug into the first mole hill to set the trap I noticed a half eaten grub and placed it on the trigger bar, covered with some dirt, and put a pail over the trap to keep it dark.<br />About 2 hours later I checked the trap and it had sprung. I carefully lifted the trap and a mole was caught in the trap but not dead.  Be ready for that.<br />I have not seen any further evidence of moles but if I use this trap again I will try adding a grub or worm bait to attract them.

review/summary: Excellent mole trap
review/text: I work as a groundsman and a large Seattle facility and was forced to take action to combat our mole problem.  Unfortunately mole trapping is illegal in Washington (damn liberals) but sometimes you have to bend the law!  The trap has a very strong spring as is more than capable of squishing moles with ease.<br /><br />Tips:<br /><br />Do not bother with the enclosed prongs.  The trap is easy to set if you use some creativity.  Drop the trap onto the grass (not dirt or pavement) and step on the jaws to get them shut in order to set the lever.  You have to use your body weight to do this.  Some people have said these traps are difficult to set.  They are a piece of cake to set if you do it this way.<br /><br />If the tunnel is on the surface, just use a knife (like a drywall knife) to make the slits in the ground and insert the legs of the trap.  Of course you will have to squish a small amount of tunnel down for the trigger to be right next to the earth.<br /><br />If the tunnel is a few inches down, dig a small section of the tunnel out (like 6 inches), place the trap inside, and fill it with loose soil.  The moles with try to make their way through the tunnel but will inevitably push up slightly on the trigger, causing their most unfortunate death.  Occassionally they will still be alive so be prepared for angry moles!  I will note that this is the #1 trap recommended by "moleman", just google the name.<br /><br />I have been trapping for about a month and have caught five moles so far.  Three big ones, two small ones.  Our grass is saved!

review/text: I found a video review that helped me quickly figure out how to set the trap.  It was not hard at all.  Yes, the spring is very powerful, and therefore it's hard to get the jaws opened and locked.  However, the provided tools and proper technique make it easy.<br /><br />I had a dozen or more tunnels in a 15' x 25' area of my yard.  I picked one tunnel that seemed fairly straight, hoping it was one that was used over and over by the critter(s).  I set the trap, (which took less than 5 minutes), placed a bucket over it, and went back inside.  2 hours later I came back out and looked under the bucket. I was surprised to see the trap was already sprung.  I was even more surprised to see a mole in the jaws when I pulled it out of the ground!  What more could you ask for?

That said, this trap is pretty humane. It's very difficult to open, requiring a lot of strength, so that mole was crushed and probably died very quickly.

review/text: I've tried 3 other mole-trap designs with limited to no success. Without a doubt, this is the trap that gets the job done, every time. I have always used the simple directions supplied with the trap, with no customizations.<br /><br />This is a powerful trap that works fast.  The cocking process may require more coordination and strength than some folks can provide. However, once the trap is armed, and the berm under the trigger is at the right height, you are virtually guaranteed to get your critter from either direction as it pushes dirt to close the hole.  I use a post-hole digger to dig a clean right-sized hole, then cover everything with an inverted plastic bucket.  Just follow the directions on the box.

I thought my problems were solved but they came back and I got a second within a day!!  They then showed up in the front lawn and I didn't set the trap right and It took a few days to realize my mistake but after I reset the trap I got my third mole and I've been mole free for a couple of weeks!!!  I would encourage people to get this product.  It does take a decent amount of strength to set the traps but they work and thats all I care about.

review/summary: Best Mole Trap Ever
review/text: I bought two of these two years ago.  First year I didn't need it since the moles left me alone.  This year however I have set it twice and caught a mole each time.  I'd previously tried other types of mole traps, i.e. spikes and hoops but with limited success.  (Seemes I had too many misses, sprung trap but no catches).  Having grown up on a farm and traping several types of critters I figured I knew how to trap moles too.  I felt strongly about this trap today after my second success in just two settings that I looked up my two year old purchase and wrote this.<br /><br />Aug. 19th, 2011<br />Mole #3 today.  So far I've made three sets and caught three moles.  Not a miss yet.  This type of trap is definately the best of any I've tried previously.

review/summary: Effective!
review/text: I chose this based on reviews.  It's not available locally in stores, and I learned that my mole problem would not be fixed using gopher/mole bait.<br /><br />This trap is fairly large.  It's all-metal with a VERY strong spring.  It's not the easiest thing to set, requiring a fair amount of force, and you need to be very careful with it.  If you catch a finger in it, I have no doubt you'd break it and you'd have a very difficult time trying to get out of it with only one working hand, so use care!!!<br /><br />The instructions could be a little more clear, but the trap is easy to figure out how it works once you examine it and set it once.  You do need to find a good location to set it, and make sure to create the mound in the middle that rests very closely to the trigger.  It only takes about 10 minutes to set once you figure it out.  I can probably do it under 5 minutes now.<br /><br />I suggest covering the trap with an upside down plastic pot with a weight on top to block out the light and to keep kids and other animals from accidentally getting into to it.  While the jaws will be below ground, it's still not something you'd want to trip or step on just in case.<br /><br />I set three of these traps along with 2 pairs of Trapline (check them out too... you'll have to search for them yourself... it's a California thing), not certain which would work and I was quite determined to get rid of my mole problem ASAP once it (or they) dug over 20 holds in my new lawn in 2 days.  The next morning... already caught the mole!  It was trap cleanly around the hips.  It wasn't a bloody mess at all, but it probably died from a combination of internal injuries, a broken spine, and asphyxiation.  Regardless, it was VERY dead.<br /><br />Bottom line... this trap is EFFECTIVE.  And that's the best I could ask for.  I probably have an overkill of traps, but I have extensive tunneling in my yard and wanted to catch the mole quickly before it did more damage.  I LOVE this trap and highly recommend it!

review/text: I'm not sure why they call this the "out-O'site mole trap".  Although the actual mechanism that traps the mole is under ground, the top part (about 4 to 5 inches) still is above the ground.  I recommend that you cover it with a small plastic pail or flower pot, so other animals or kids don't set it off inadvertently.  So, far I haven't trapped a mole, but I think it's because I haven't set is in an area that the moles are currently active in.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RAMY">Victor 0631 Out O'Sight Mole Trap</a>

review/summary: Heavy duty - really works well
review/text: I purchased several of the Victor 0631 mole traps and have had great success with trapping the moles that have been tearing up our yard. The spring on it is massive, which gives the trap enough strength to cut through any type of soil conditions when it is triggered. The trap is much easier to set if you use a large pair of channel lock pliers. You will want to use caution when handling the the loaded trap - once it is set, you don't want to get anywhere near the jaws, as it will be a guaranteed visit to the hospital. I also use the channel lock pliers to put the trap in position over the mole tunnel to give myself plenty of distance from the moving parts. I have also tried the Nash Choker Loop and the Sweeney Plunger trap. I catch about 3 moles with the Victor trap for every one that I get with the Nash trap. In damp sandy soil, I have seen the Nash trap not being able to trip quick enough because the spring doesn't quite have the oomph behind it to cut through the dirt. As far as the Sweeney trap goes, I have yet to get my first mole after 3 years of using it.

review/summary: Got one on my first try.
review/text: After reading some of the reviews, it seems like a lot of people have had success with these traps, so I figured I'd give it a try. I was still skeptical, because that's my nature, but I'm not anymore. I installed the trap using the method of stepping on the mole tunnel to flatten it and cutting slits in the grass for the trap's scissors. The very next day I noticed the trap had tripped and I went to see if I caught one. Sure enough, when I pulled the trap out, there was the bane of my yard. A big, fat, ugly sucker with huge claws designed for yard devastation. I felt a little bad because I love most animals, but this one deserved what he got. Anyway, these traps are awesome. I cannot believe how good they work. Happy hunting.

I then placed the trap on said tunnel and I had a dead mole within two hours.

review/summary: Caught one the first night on mole super highway.
review/text: You must find the mole 'highways' which are the long straight runs that (for me) were easiest found beside the patio, sidewalk, or driveway.  Once you think you have identified one, simply mash down about a 2 foot long section.  My thought process was that if I pressed down the entire run, they might find an alternate route.<br /><br />So once you do this, check back in 24-48 hours to see if has been repaired.  If it has, then mash down a section the length of your foot, LEVEL with the rest of the surrounding grounds.  I have sand soil so I simply dug (with my finger) 2 small notches ACROSS the mole highway same distance apart as the trap death grips.<br /><br />I found it easy to set the trap by hand, using the directions on the box... but many other reviews here offer alternative methods.  Leave the 2 bars used to pry the trap open in place, it helps to position the trap in the ground.  Now, set the trap death grips down in the notches you have created (with SAFETY latch hooked!) The trigger plate should touch the LEVEL ground that you mashed down.  Keep a firm grip on the pry bars as the trap may trigger a few times until you get it touching the ground with light enough pressure not to trigger.  When you are happy, remove the pry bars, release the safety and enjoy the results.<br /><br />Start > Finish, of setting trap, maybe 3 minutes.<br /><br />My soil is pure sand, so my 'notches' mentioned above were almost non-existent because they kept back filling with sand as soon as I dug them out with my finger.  When I set the trap, the soil was in between the death grips, but it was loose enough to grab the mole, first night I had set the trap!<br /><br />Great trap, easy to use and set.  I may have had some beginners luck, but so far so good.

review/summary: best way to kill moles.  Like all traps, it must be set correctly.
review/text: These traps have a much better kill ratio than the other traps.  I have one of these, a harpoon trap, and some that you bury in the tunnels.<br /><br />Poisons, grub killers, and gasses probably don't work, and you will never have a body to know for sure.  Trapping is the best method.<br /><br />I've also flooded the tunnels then shot the mole.  Flooding the tunnels did more damage than the mole did.<br /><br />I've also nailed a couple with a harpoon trap too, but the scissor type is more effective and I rarely have a sprung trap with no mole.<br /><br />The out o sight scissor trap is the best one.<br /><br />People who are giving this bad reviews must not be setting it correctly, I had the same problems until I learned to set them right.<br /><br />Do a google or youtube search and learn how to set them right and you will catch them.<br /><br />1. Keep your grass short to help spot the tunnels.<br /><br />2. Pick a tunnel and set the trap correctly on that tunnel, stomp all of the other tunnels down flat, not the one your trapping on.<br /><br />3. If you haven't caught the mole in 48 hours, the tunnel is abandoned and needs to be relocated.  Stomp the tunnel down flat and move the trap to a different newer tunnel.<br /><br />I usually catch them overnight

review/text: Woo hoo!  I'm so excited to have caught a mole so quickly after setting the traps for the first time.  I purchased two traps and set them up like Geoffrey Klos suggested.  I couldn't find any runs that looked like "highways", but I did find some that snaked around my yard and seemed to connect the myriad of smaller runs that branched out.  I guess my instincts were correct.  When I noticed that the trap had been set off, I took my shovel with me, fully prepared to whack that mole on its head if it were alive. I was not prepared for it to be so cute and fuzzy, so I now have a live mole in a bucket.  I guess that's better than a live mole in my front yard.  The only problem is I now have to figure out how to get rid of the cute little monster.  Needless to say, the trap worked great.  The trap is probably best set with two people:  one to use the levers to open the jaws and the other to position the safety hook and the tripping rod.  I set it by myself in two steps.  First I layed it on its side and stepped on the top lever until I could lock the safety hook.  At that point, the levers were close enough together that I could squeeze them with one hand while setting the tripping rod and tripping pan. I noticed the pictures that looked like someone had dug two trenches in which to place the legs of the trap, but I just followed Klos's instructions and used a small spade to make four puncture holes that lined up with the legs, and then I pressed the trap down into the holes until the tripping pan touched the dirt that I had previously patted down with my foot.  Happy mole hunting!

review/summary: Set twice, killed twice
review/text: This product worked way better than I thought it would, even after reading all the positive reviews. I set it in the run used by an evil mole who repeatedly crossed my back yard on his way next door. I sprayed his run with castor oil products, Murphy soap, water with cayenne pepper powder in it--nothing phased this monster. Set this trap in his main highway, and next day, it had snagged the pest. Two days later found another mole run entering from another neighbor's yard. Set the trap, next morning, dead mole.<br /><br />I'm not bloodthirsty, but these creeps ruin my yard. I stopped short of cutting off their heads and sticking them on Popsicle sticks next to the runs. I did, though, leave the bodies buried securely in the tunnels. A message for any other intruders.<br /><br />A big thanks to Geoffrey Klos for his excellent instructions. Doubt I would have been successful following the package's instructions.

review/summary: Awesome! Must Have!
review/text: Not much else to say, but this really works!  I set the trap and 2 hours later = dead mole!  Can't ask for more than that.  Easy to set up, easy to reset!

review/text: gets all moles big or small. i have found putting a small dirt clod under paddle helps trigger trap. if you have dogs you can put a bucket over trap and weight it down once trap is set to keep them out also keeps children out. i have two and my brother also has two and we both agree that they are the best thing on the market today.

review/summary: They work, but one of my traps had a major, dangerous manufacturing flaw!!
review/text: I purchased 3 of these from Amazon. They do work. So far, I have caught 2 moles in my yard and 1 in my neighbor's using the surface technique. One of the traps though has a dangerous manufacturing flaw. The thinner piece of metal on the top of the trap where the trigger bar and safety clip are attached broke on the trap after setting it only twice. I have also observed that over time and constant use the paint wears off this piece and the metal rusts, further weakening it. I have contacted Victor about this problem but have not yet heard back from them. Thankfully Amazon has a very liberal and easy return policy on defective items. See pic of broken trap in customer images.<br /><br />I would have rated this higher but Victor has quality control issues they need to address. This is what happens when you outsource your manufacturing to other countries like China.<br /><br />For those having problems setting these traps, don't follow the instructions on the box. See my pics in customer images on how to set these without having to use a vice or vice-grips.

review/summary: Good trap, requires strong hands
review/text: I've been very successful at trapping moles with this trap. It was a little hard to figure out how to set it initially---the directions on the box aren't perfectly clear--but finally figured it out. It does require pretty good hand strength to set it. I used a 2 x 4 to prop the jaws of the trap open until I figured out how to set it. This trap was one of the few recommended by "The Mole Man" [...], whose web site it really great for learning about mole biology, habitat and how to control moles. Traps appear to be the only effective method. And this trap is certainly effective. I caught a mole the first night the trap was out and several more since.
