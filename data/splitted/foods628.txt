review/summary: Good & Plenty -- just like you remember it.
review/text: It's Good & Plenty -- is there really anything else to say? It is still the same old fat-free, delicious licorice candy it's always been.<br /><br />One thing to note is the AMOUNT of candy you're getting -- you're getting a lot. Seriously. You're getting 12 fairly large (half-pound) bags of candy. This will definitely last you awhile.

review/summary: Good & Plenty rules
review/text: This is one of my favorite candies of all time - the sugar coated black licorice candy that comes in white or purple.  I've been eating Good & Plenty in the movie theater since forever.  I got tons of it while trick-or-treating over the years.  Eat too much of it and you might get a sugar high and a headache.<br /><br />I highly recommend this candy.

review/summary: What a difference freshness makes!
review/text: I must have gotten used to rather stale Good & Plenty because once I received this order (speedy shipping ala Prime) and tasted from the first bag (and each bag thereafter) I was pleasantly surprised to find very soft licorice - yum.  No packaging problems with my order (no holes/punctures) - the packages were secured from movement with the inflated baggie things.  And yes, I've reorderd :)

review/text: I really like these bags of Good & Plenty! They are just the right size for eating and sharing! You get more than in the usual "theater box" size and enough to share or put away for later! One nice thing about Good & Plenty is that they'll keep a person "regular" (LOL!). If you like black licorice you'll love these (if you've never tried them) and the colorful sugar coating adds just enough sweetness to cut the licorice "bite". These bags travel well and are easy to "smuggle" into the theater! Enjoy!

review/summary: I Wasn't Sure About This One, but Wow!
review/text: Peanut Matcha.  I was a little hesitant.  I don't know what it is about the idea of peanut flavoring in a tea ... it just doesn't sound right to me.  I am all for just about any other type of nut (yeah, I know that peanuts aren't technically nuts), but, peanuts just sounded too weird to me.  Then I tried Peanut Taffy and this changed my whole idea of how good peanut flavor can taste.<br /><br />So, I got the courage and I ordered this Matcha, and I'm pleasantly surprised.  It's really quite good.  Much better than I expected it to be.  It is good prepared traditionally, with water and whisked well, but then after taking my first sip, I decided I wanted to find out what a pinch of salt might add to the flavor.  And so I added a tiny pinch of sea salt and I LOVE this.  It is really yummy!<br /><br />Smooth, rich and creamy.  Nice peanut flavor, balanced well with the fresh, leafy green taste of the Matcha.  Really tasty - much tastier than I expected!

review/summary: From the birth Place of Coffee
review/text: I am officially addicted to coffee, I mean the real coffee which I roast, grind and brew, the first time I had Yiragachefe was when I was deployed to Iraq, my wife neighbors and some other family members knew I really can not live with out coffee, up on my return from Iraq I went to Ethiopian store in San Diego and asked store owner if he has this brand, unfortunately in the USA this brand is sold only by starbucks, but he told me to try some other export standard version of Ethiopian coffee brand, I try 1LB that was my starting point to roast my own coffee, it is almost three years now. That store is on Al-Cajon PVD and I had 15% discount every time I buy my coffee, finally when I moved to East cost I bought 30lb in fear of availability in Louisiana.<br /><br />I am not sure about legitimacy of Indian store in selling Ethiopian coffee but I highly recommend this coffee only if you really know what coffee means, the real coffee comes unroast, and ungrounded 2 shoots of Espresso can keep you moving the whole 8 working hours, this is natural straight from jungle and it's organic no hormone or fertilizer is used to grow it, sadly once it hits our American market it start giving part of its caffeine away to energy drinks and some other things so you will never find real clean and untouched one  on any market but in Ethiopian Stores. I will add some pictures of my newly roasted coffee and show you how easy it is to roast 1.5LB of coffee in about 15 minutes.<br /><br />Please try this unroasted organic you will really like the taste and you will enjoy your day.

I'll choose to buy the product locally because the cost is the same, given the shipping and handling charges assessed by the on-line vendor.

review/summary: huckleberry flapjack mix
review/text: this product was a suckarooney. i really looked forward to it because it's unusual, and sounded yummy. WRONG. i mixed it as instructed, using milk instead of water as directed to make it lighter. it comes with a small jar of huckleberry jam, that is to be mixed into the batter. it was interesting, so i did it. the batter was thick and lumpy, even after mixing well. the instructions said it would be, if done correctly. when i poured the batter, it kind of "blopped" onto the griddle. each pancake took a while to cook, but i was patient. each cake was very HEAVY and cakey. it literally stuck to the roof of my mouth. the lumps exploded into bursts of mix in my mouth. the flavor did taste like huckleberry, but still had a packaged, jammy flavor. i really hated it, as did my husband. his response was, "what the **** is this mess? i hope you didn't pay much for it!" unfortnately, it's very expensive, and NOT WORTH IT. i have all the other jam, jelly, and syrup products from "wild wilderness", and i have been very pleased at the delicious, fresh flavors. but this one was a dud. you would do better to use your usual mix or recipe, and add some jam to it. don't waste your money on this.

review/text: And, if u do, use a fork!  It's that easy!  Biggest problem with ANY mix usually involves  over-beating, especially when recipe calls for adding eggs.  Cooks tend to beat and blend to the point that eggs become tooooooo frothy.  That can make a big difference in outcome.  Beat eggs and other wet ingredients first, then lightly add mix a half cup at a time.  Then stir or beat until all nix is wet!  U'll see a HUGE difference in outcome!

review/summary: Folks, this is diet - keep that in mind
review/text: Before you read my entire review, keep the following in mind: A quick internet search will show you how many calories and carbs are in a normal Pina Colada.. my search results showed me that it's typically a 500+ calorie drink.  Baja Bob gives you a 30 calorie substitute.  Let's remember this 470 calorie difference between the drinks while reading the reviews.  To put things in perspective, it would take only 7 normal pina coladas to gain a pound of fat, but to gain a pound with the Baja Bob version, you'd have to drink more than 116!<br /><br />Now that my disclaimer is out of the way, let's talk about the flavor. If you follow the directions and mix with ice in a blender, not only is the taste pleasant, but the beverage is surprisingly creamy.  This is a very sweet mixer and not something that I would like to drink every day, but it would make a great party drink.  A wonderful way to show that you're an accommodating  host to your diabetic or low-carbing guests.  I would have at least one other Baja Bob's mix on hand that doesn't require a blender too, such as margarita mix.<br /><br />Overall Baja Bob makes decent substitutes for full-calorie drinks.  No it is not nearly as good as a "real" pina colada, but most diet soda drinkers are already used to the differences between their diet and regular drinks.  I have managed to lose 10 lbs in the past month on my low carb diet without giving up drinks.  A close friend of mine lost about 30 over several months and had a drink every now and again, within reason of course, but Baja Bob did not throw her off her diet.  I can't say the same about a normal pina colada.

review/text: Although I am something of a circus peanut connoisseur, this was my first experience with colored (as in "other than orange") circus peanuts, and it was quite a good one. The peanuts arrived in good shape in a cellophane bag with a "Sweet Gourmet" sticker on it. (A little confusing, as the listing shows them "by Spangler.") I didn't realize until I read up on the history of circus peanuts that they're supposed to be banana-flavored; I always thought it was just some unique circus peanut flavor. In this case, the orange peanuts are regular flavor; the yellow ones are obviously lemon (and my least favorite, despite my love of lemons); the pink ones are a subtle cherry; and the white ones...oh, the white ones. Vanilla. Creamy, sugary deliciousness. Wow. If I could order just vanilla, I might never go back to pseudo-banana.<br /><br />The price was reasonable for such quality, but the shipping (twice the price of the product) was not. But I suppose that's the fault of the shipping company, and it's probably a good thing anyway. If shipping were, say, free, I'd be well on my way to diabetes. This way, I'll only order these peanuts as an occasional special treat. And a treat they are!

review/summary: Over-Heated
review/text: The peanuts arrived to me in a timely manner along with the rest of my purchaces. As soon as I looked at them, I realized that they had been over-heated along their journey. The colors had bled onto one another and some were even sticking to each other. (The white peanuts had the most color transfer of all of them.) I had wanted to use these to decorate cupcakes, but with all of the sticking and bleeding it'll make them hard to use for that purpose. I'm sure they'll taste just fine, I'm just disappointed about the way they were handled during shipping.

review/summary: Straight up?  No way!
review/text: You may be wondering why the price of this juice is so high.  The reason is its purity.  The label says it all: Just Cranberry.  There are many health benefits to drinking cranberry juice, but the sugar in most of the brands counteracts these benefits.  The price listed here is what my grocery store sells for 10 bottles, not the full case of 12.  So, you sort of get 2 freebies!<br /><br />My palette cannot tolerate this juice at full throttle.  I like to fill up my one liter bottle with filtered water and about 4 ounces of the cranberry juice twice a day.  I often add some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTR646">Ginger People Ginger Juice ( 12x5 OZ)</a> for added health benefits and better taste.

review/summary: product discontinued
review/text: I have just been told by 'back to NATURE' that this has been discontinued.<br /><br />We started noticing that it was disappearing from shelves all over our area about 2 months ago. We asked every place to check for availability, yet never heard anything other than it is backordered.<br /><br />I used 'back to NATURE' website to do the 'contact us' thing twice and never received a response.<br /><br />I came to Amazon while searching online and placed myself on the notify when this product becomes available list.<br /><br />Today I decided to try and call back to NATURE. I spoke with the person that answered the phone, she said she could help, and after discussing my difficulty finding the product she offered to 'research' and get back to me. I must note she attempted to collect quite of bit of personal information. She assured me that I could simply go back to the local groceries and ask why they were not stocking it however I insisted that it was not available anywhere nor here on Amazon so the problem was not my grocer.<br /><br />I wasn't quite accepting her quick 'research, get back to me, and get of the phone approach' so I asked to talk to someone else and she got me on the line with her supervisor Lizzy.<br /><br />After reviewing the above and being offered a 'research and get back' solution I was a bit more insistant and it was then that she said '.. that product had been discontinued due to a lack of sales and once discontinued it is inlikely that it will become available again...'. At this point I was more than just a bit disapointed and shared with her that in my local market the 'Cranberry Pecan Granola' just happened to be the only one of their granola selections that was always selling out, week after week over the last several years and I found it curious that the one selection that did appear to sell was discontinued.<br /><br />I guess it is only popular here!

It is absolutely delicious with milk.  However, even though the bag says there are seven servings; there really are only three.  The nutrition informaton on Amazon is wrong - you really need to double the calories.  I almost rated this product 4 stars for misleading the consumer. Even though Amazon has a disclaimer on their site, the nutrition label (calories) is incorrect for every Back to Nature package when you compare it to the one you receive.

review/summary: Wonderful aroma
review/text: Wow - this stuff sells out fast -- I no sooner got an e-mail from amazon saying it was back in stock than when I went to order it, amazon said there's was only 1 left in stock so I was able to grab the last one this time ---- the same thing happens at the grocery store: they get it back in stock and it sells out right away.<br /><br />This has a wonderful aroma when you open the container. It's a slightly citrus smell and you can smell the spiciness of the pepper. The definite plus - and the reason I gave it 5 stars - is that there's no salt, no MSG and no added sugars. It seems most seasoning products have salt and sugar listed as some of their main ingredients - why pay an arm and a leg for salt and sugar?<br /><br />Mostly I use this on fish and chicken although I have used it on pork tenderloin when I'm going for a more citrus flavor for the pork. One trick I've learned is that this stuff tastes even better if you can soak or marinade it and let the dried herbs blend and come to full fruition in some sort of liquid -- my favorite is white wine. That's definitely not necessary as it's good just as good if you just shake it on top of food, but the "soaking" seems to blend the flavors really well.<br /><br />Ingredients contain (per 1/4 teaspoon) no calories, no fat, no salt, no protein, no carbs, no nothing. Here's what's in it as listed on the container: onion, spices (black pepper, basil, oregano, celery seed, savory, thyme, cayenne pepper, coriander, cumin, mustard, rosemary, marjoram) garlic, lemon juice powder, carrot, citric acid, lemon peel, natural lemon flavor, oil of lemon, turmeric color, chili pepper. Just so you know, there's a definite peppery flavor or taste to this.<br /><br />Being an old lady, I really watch my sodium intake (as well as sugar and fat)and use these types of products on a regular basis.

review/summary: In honor of my father--
review/text: Today is my father's birthday. If he were alive, he would be 92. He died in 1984 from heart-related maladies. Still, one remembers one's father on his birthday, alive or not, for a loved one is always alive in memory.<br /><br />So why Mrs. Dash Lemon Pepper Seasoning? My father was a taste bud fanantic. No, let me re-phrase: My father wanted taste to explode on his tongue. He's one of those who shook Louisiana hot sauce (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H27IGK">Louisiana Original Hot Sauce, 3-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 36)</a>) or pepper sauce (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0025UNVXQ">Trappey's Hot Peppers in Vinegar, 4.5-Ounce Glass Bottles (Pack of 12)</a>)--I refer to the hot vinegar that preserved the hot peppers--onto all kinds of food from fried eggs to peas and beans.<br /><br />Many years ago when I visited for the weekend, I brought with me Mrs. Dash's Lemon Pepper. Oh my gosh! My father loved that flavor!! I left the bottle, of course. Every time I visited thereafter, there was always a bottle in his cabinet. I lived in another city at the time. My brother, who lived in the same town as my dad, told me that our father raved over that Lemon Pepper many times over the years!<br /><br />Bottom line: If you are seeking a great taste sensation, Mrs. Dash's Lemon Pepper may be just the thing! It satisfied the buds of a man who LOVED his food flavorful!<br /><br />(Note: There is no salt or MSG in Mrs. Dash's Lemon Pepper.)

I use it in scrambled eggs every morning. It absolutely beats every other lemon-pepper I've tried in many years of cooking.  It's even great in soups, on buttered toast and baked potatoes, in cottage cheese, rice etc.  In addition, use in to enhance traditional chicken, fish and beef recipes.  The flavor brightens up anything you put it on, and the savings cannot be beat when you buy them in bulk, 6 bottles at a time.

I love this one on fish and chicken, and to spice up salad dressing, both homemade and commercial (if you use Walden Farms calorie free dressing, this helps with both the flavor and the chemical taste of several of them).<br /><br />I always put my seasonings on about two hours before cooking if possible, and steam a lot. Also great on spinach, with Apple Cider Vinegar (the real stuff, with Mother). As the seasoning soaks in, the "bits" of vegetable swell, and make lovely surprise flavor as you eat them.<br /><br />Best price I've found is here at Amazon.

review/text: When I was very young, my Slovak Grandmother made homemade noodles. This is before everything was renamed "pasta". She would roll out the dough til it covered the dining room table, then roll it up into a long tube, then with a flash of her big knife, chop chop until it was a huge pile of noodles.We hung them everywhere like streamers til they dried to be put in soup.<br />This is the only product that even comes close to her "homemades". The older women in my family swear by these, as they taste "like Mama's". I can't find these on the West Coast (home of bad noodles & snooty pasta), and in only one supermarket chain in Maryland. I love being able to purchase them ONLINE, and share them with my friends out here.<br />Hey, Mrs Weiss, tell your kids to distribute these in California so more people can buy them!

I promptly ordered them so I could split the order with my Mom. This is a dumpling noodle and is used in many Polish dishes. It's so nice to have these in my pantry; especially when they arrived in a matter of days after I ordered them.

review/summary: Among the best quality Marzipan
review/text: I would say that Niederegger Marzipan of L&uuml;beck, Germany is the global trend setter for the best quality Marzipan candy.  Only two other companies match their quality - one in Germany famous for making the "Mozartkugeln" and the other is from Denmark - Anthon Berg.  Most other Marzipan makers are certainly not bad, but they are not as good as these three.  I look forward to the day when Amazon.com will offer the standard chocolate-covered Anthon Berg Marzipan bars for sale (they come wrapped in dark pink wrappers, and totally match Niederegger in taste and quality).  They cost somewhat less than Niederegger as well.

review/text: These puffets are so amazing!!!  I discovered them while visiting family in LA, where they are carried in Whole Foods.  My daughter isn't always the best eater and she loves these.  Now at 17 months old, every time I open the freezer, she runs over and looks for the box.  If it's on a lower shelf, she yanks it out and shakes it at me, begging for me to zap one up.  They are also great for traveling.  I always pack a couple for those long flights when she won't eat anything else.  Still hoping that they get distribution in NY state Whole Foods, but I will gladly order from Amazon until then.

review/summary: Amazing tortas!
review/text: If you are looking for a great introduction to tortas - little crisps, immersed in olive oil and infused with flavors like seville orange, this product is for you. With origins in Spain, tortas are a great addition to any spread, and only need a little slice of cheese just to accent their flavor. This is going to sound like a funny serving suggestion - but, I recommend eating them with the sprinkled sugar side up. When I ate them with the sugar "tongue side" down, they had a sour aftertaste. And, while very intriguing, I preferred to taste the delicious flavor of the olive oil.

review/text: I began purchasing this brand at my local walmart store on the suggestion of a friend.  The lable suggests that feeding your animal this product will make their waste firmer and less frequent.  That part was certainly true. Unfortunately the ingredients in this food are shown by a variety of other websites to cause allergic reactions or worse in animals.  After a visit to the vet's office to treat a severe case of rash, ear-ache,itching and loss of pet hair in my cat Frisky I did a web search and tried to contact natural life pet products.  No response has come from the company, but I was able to find an article about the RECALL of this product from national chain stores last month because of possible instances of pet death.  Don't feed this to your pet if you love them.

review/text: YARRR!!! Ya lily livered land lubber!! Today is "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008M7HGAA">Talk Like a Pirate Day</a>"!  What better way to celebrate the 10th anniversary of this international holiday, than with a nice bottle of Piraat Belgian ale?  Lauded by the 'Guide to Belgian Ales' as "[O]ne of the top five ales of the world," Piraat is an opaque triple golden ale with a 10.5% ABV.  It has a full bodied "Belgian" flavor and a noticably hoppy finish.  Unfortunately, in my area of the world, this ale is generally $3 to $4 more expensive than other comparable Belgian ales.  Thus, I don't purchase this one all that often.  However, seeing as this is a special day, I made an exception.  At 10.5% ABV, this ale really has a kick... If I drink anymore, I might start makin' people walk the plank an' scrub the poopdeck!<br /><br />Happy "Talk Like a Pirate Day"!

review/summary: Not Up To Tropical Fruit Chews. Tough to Open.
review/text: My nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market has several varieties of Hi-Chew assorted fruit chews. I tried one about a week ago and liked it well enough that I came back to try a second variety. This one is a 3.53-ounce bag of Strawberry, Green Apple and Grape chews. They're good, but I don't like them as well as some of the tropical fruit chews I've had. Plus, they're just not the best imitations of the fruits they're supposed to represent. It would weigh on your personal taste, of course. One thing I like about these chews is that they don't seem overly sweet. One thing I don't like is that they come in individual wrappers and these are the toughest wrappers to get off that I've ever found in candies. I finally had to go and find a scissors. Fingernails just don't work. Don't even think about trying to open one while you're driving.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

I'm sure I don't want them again so I'm closer to "I don't like" than "OK".<br /><br />The good:<br />The salt content IS pretty good. On par with how we season our own.<br />They're crisp.<br /><br />The bad:<br />Seeds are pretty small which means the ratio between seed and shell is not great.<br />Small seeds means you almost can't shell them, you HAVE to eat the shells.<br />Too many seeds have a sour taste which ruins the hole experience.<br />Per ounce they're more expensive than any others I've tried.<br /><br />I wish David's Seeds put out a lighter sea salt version. Their seeds are much larger so you can peel the shells if you want. They just have too much salt. I remember eating the Indian brand when I was a kid. They had a great tasting seed but unfortunately even more salt than Davids.
