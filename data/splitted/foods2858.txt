review/summary: This is NOT for making Chili with OK!
review/text: LOL Some fool is running around here claiming this sauce tastes like<br />a "re-branded cocktail sauce" and will make your food taste like shrimp.<br />I swear the internet has made idiots out of half the population.<br /><br />First of all, this Chili Sauce is mandatory for making a good homemade<br />cocktail sauce, just add horseradish and lemon juice. It is also mandatory<br />in any variety of cocktail meatballs recipes. in salad dressings, for<br />making spaghetti sauce and yes, even in a pot of chili, just don't pour<br />this into a skillet of ground beef and expect that you now have Chili!<br /><br />This stuff also makes a great Sloppy Joe, and is even good as a dip for<br />fries and burgers. Very versatile, and no kitchen should be without a<br />bottle of this.

review/text: Receive my massive box of Koppers Rainbow Lentils.<br />The reason for my purchase was because I had read in multiple locations online that they are vegan.<br />My ONLY reason for the 4 stars is because I wish the nutritional information was put up with the description.  These are NOT vegan.  They contain beeswax.<br />Since I purchased 10 pounds, I'll be working my way through them in baked goods and such, but will not be purchasing again.<br />That being said, they are good, the shipment was ultra quick (received WAY before the est. delivery date) and the product was exactly as I thought they would be.  Shipped in a plastic bag inside a box.  No problems there, everything was sealed and fresh when I opened it.<br />Thank you! I wish these were vegan...I'd be purchasing more goods from you.

review/summary: Toxic to Cats - Be Cautious
review/text: Tea tree oil is toxic to cats in all but the very smallest doses. A cat's liver is not capable of processing it. For an average cat weighing seven to 12 pounds, somewhere between 1 1/2 to 3 teaspoons of tea tree oil would be lethal. Because of this cats should never be treated with anything more than one to five drops of tea tree oil per teaspoon of carrier oil. The same thing applies to small, and some medium-sized dogs.<br /><br />Another reason to avoid using tea tree oil on small animals is that they tend to lick themselves and end up ingesting the oil.<br /><br />Most of the cat deaths from tea tree oil come from people using tea tree flea & tick treatments which are applied to the entire body of the cat. This product is applied only in the ear. Nonetheless, given the extreme toxicity of tea tree oil to cats, I would be very cautious. Is the ear wash so essential that it is worth risking your cat's life? Perhaps try another product first.

review/text: Sumatra is a dark, fragrant coffee with hints of chocolate. It has a subtle aftertaste and is as tasty with desert as it is served black. I'm not a big fan of most Starbucks' beans, but this one breaks that trend. My wife and I find ourselves going back to this bean as our staple coffee bean of choice. If you enjoy a darker cup of coffee with some subtlety, this is a great option.

review/text: Overall, I am not very impressed with Sbux's coffee, but the whole-bean Sumatra is pretty much the perfect Sumatra coffee. When it's on sale at Amazon it can't be beat for the the price. When I was roasting my own coffee, I usually was not able to get the uniformity and precision of the roast that tbhis coffee has, which is unsurprising when you consider the difference in the capabilities of our respective equipment, of course. Don't get the ground coffee, since grinding coffee makes it lose half its flavor in only 48 hours.

review/summary: What is all the fuss about?
review/text: I do not consider myself any kind of professional but I did take up coffee as a hobby nearly two years ago. I have tasted nearly two dozen single bean varieties and a few blends. I have tasted both generic Sumatran which tastes of the local soil and Sumatran Blue Batak the latter being a special favorite which I hope some day to find as a peaberry offering.<br /><br />That said, I was expecting a coffee commensurate with the price of the coffee. What I found was a coffee where most of the flavor comes from the roasting rather than from the bean.<br /><br />This is not the quality one expects from $1/oz beans but rather from an average grocery store offering at maybe $0.70/oz.<br /><br />=====<br /><br />Consider roasting coffee analogous to toasting bread. You can get flavor out of a bland white bread if you toast it enough. That is what was done here. There is little intrinsic flavor in these beans yet I know Sumatra produces some excellent coffees which the correct roast enhances their flavor rather than producing a generic roasted flavor on top of next to nothing at all.

review/summary: Extremely aromatic coffee, yes!
review/text: I took up coffee drinking about 10 years ago with a passion.  I tried all the great coffees like  Kona and South American Columbian ones; I started with the "regular" coffee maker and moved up to the French Press; finally I recently moved "up" to the newer air forced plastic units (aeropress) that push air through a small paper filter (which require more coffee than than the French Press but produce a cleaner, better cup of coffee, quicker). I grind my own coffee, usually the same day or within a few days to get the maximum freshness.  As such, I feel I have the best equipment available (I also use whipped froth milk) to acquire the best possible taste. Ah, but I digress, as to this coffee, like all coffees, it depends on your individual taste.  I find Sumatra coffees to be extremely flavorful, rich, and robust but not super overpowering.  This is probably the best coffee I have found, but it isn't cheap.  You get what you pay for.

I particularly love that they're healthy for him, are 100% natural, no added preservatives or additional flavors, and they're made from free-range, pastured-raised, grass-fed cows.  Another plus is that they take him more time to chew through than the non-braided variety.

review/text: I bought this chutney to make a recipe from a magazine I was reading. It was combined with orange sections, curry,etc. and served over chicken cutlets rolled in panko crumbs, then fried in olive oil. I cooked pork tenderloin slices the same way and it was delicious both times.Just the right amount of spice! A little pricey though.

review/summary: Bellagio mocha mix was like overpriced hot cocoa
review/text: I usually buy Big Train Mocha Mix, which I love, but decided to try Bellagio's due to the price.  Big Train's price keeps going up.  I was disappointed with Bellagio's because it tasted like weak hot cocoa mix.  My daughter also tried it and felt it was watered down and she adds xtra to hers. I will not buy this product again. I felt it was overpriced for hot cocoa flavor, but would of been a good deal for a mocha coffee mix if it would of worked for that.

review/summary: Its not what I expect for the price I paid
review/text: I felt like drinking fancy one night and asked the guy at the liquor store for a recommendation of a good sipping whiskey.  He told me to try Bulleit.  He said "Its expensive but well worth it".  I never even finished the bottle.  Years later its still in my cabinet half empty.  I don't even know if this stuff has an expiration on it.  At this point I'm scared to open it back up because of that.  It didn't impress me.  In the end I went back to drinking Jack Daniels black label.  To me this stuff tasted watery with mild flavor.  Sure its smooth and can be drank straight but there are cheaper alternatives that taste just as good if not better.

review/summary: Ireland Revisited
review/text: I bought the Hogan's Brown Irish Soda Bread to help our travel group revisit Ireland.  One of our very favorite things while in Ireland was the incredible soda bread, served with every meal.  Hogan's was the easy (very) and sure fire way to recapture the fun.  The flavor was excellent but perhaps not quite as dark and deep as the breads we had been served.  That was probably just a regional difference, as the Hogan's was wonderful.

I could never drink the other "power" drinks as they were way too sweet for my taste so I always stuck with water. After trying this drink, I am hooked!

review/text: If your grandma ever made molasses cookies, they might have tasted like these extraordinary ginger snaps! They're light and snappy, without being a jaw-breaker. The amount of ginger and sugar is just right and the molasses is unsulphured, thus, there's no yucky aftertaste. The Country Choice vanilla wafers are equally delicious! At over six bucks a pound, these cookies are a bit pricey, but worth every penny. Try these with a nice cup of tea or an ice-cold glass of milk. Now, try not to eat the whole box full...I dare you!

review/summary: 4 stars since organic
review/text: If these had not been organic I'd only given 2 stars. I'm used to eating Nature's Path organic ginger spice cookies which is the one I'm using to compare. The NP ones have a stronger ginger flavor which I prefer. The crunch factor (hardness) is about the same. The price point is the biggest factor. The NP at $32 w/o coupon for 12 9 ox. boxes are approx.4.75 pound (the last case I bought had a coupon so were $22 or 3.26/lb). These are about 6.50/lb. at Amazon's current price. I probably won't buy these again as I'll stick w/ Nature's Path. That said, I did give this brand's chocolate mint cookies 5 stars and I do plan on purchasing those again as well as trying their chocolate chip and oatmeal cranberry.

review/summary: Used To Be Great, But No More!!
review/text: These cookies used to be great, but alas, no more!!  I bought two cases (12 boxes) of the ones with an expiration date of "OCT 11 09 B" from Amazon recently.  When I received them I found only two to three whole cookies per box, the rest were broken in multiple pieces.  I had previously had this problem with the "OCT 11 09 B" cookies that I purchased from Kroger and Whole Foods.  Two problems that I noticed right away: 1) the natural ginger snap cracks are two deep and the whole cookies that are present break with very little force, and 2) the cookie boxes rather than being stacked vetically in the case taking advantage of the stucture of each box to protect the cookies, are layed flat on top of one another.  Therefore, just stacking cases on top of one another crushes the cookies.  When I called the company and pointed out these problems, they blamed Amazon's mishandling of the cases as the cause of so many broken cookies.  They promised to reimburse me but I only received coupons to replace one of the two problem cases. If the broken cookie pieces had not tasted so good and if they had not been organic, this rating would have been a "1".

review/summary: Strong Celery Flavor
review/text: Most celery salt is salt with some celery in it. However, this product is much better -- it is celery with some salt in it. The celery flavor is very strong, has a nice peppery flavor, and smells good, too. The amount of salt is possibly not quite enough, but that's easily remedied by just adding regular salt to your food. I tried this in a ramen noodle soup (which is already quite salty) and it really tasted quite good. If you like celery salt I do recommend this product over the store brands. It has a much nicer flavor and a little goes a long way.<br /><br />Also, my order didn't come in a plastic bag like the photo shows; it came in a little plastic spice jar with a shaker top. I have ordered other bulk items from Barry Farms and they have just been in plastic bags, so this was a nice surprise.

I had to get scissors to cut the package open, and the little guy was already going completely crazy! I was worried he would jump up and get stabbed with the scisors..YIKES!! lol..:) I opened them, and the smell even caught my nose. They smell quite tasty! I gave him 3 off the bat, and he just went NUTS trying to get to the package and get some more!! Finally I stashed them where he could not get them, and the little stinker then tried to get the empty shipping package they came in..LOL Safe to say, HE LOVES THEM!! I love the fact that they are made in USA and seem fairly healthy!! They are fairly small, but you have to remember, these are treats. We already ordered the jumbo-pack of them! :-D

So I needed a cheese treat that was pretty much 100% cheese with nothing else added. This is it! My dog is crazy about these because they are just cheese. I am using them as his training reward (along with freeze-dried chicken) and he is responding because these aren't your every day dog bone. I also feel better giving these to my dog as frequently as necessary in training because he is not getting alot of additional ingredients such as grains. I highly recommend these treats. The company also ships very rapidly!

review/summary: Excellent Rooibos tea
review/text: I have gotten to drinking iced tea made with freshly brewed organic green, white and red (South African Rooibos) teas every day. It's relatively easy to get green and white teas that don't cost a lot, but not that easy to get organic Rooibos at a good price. Well, this one is excellent, for sure, and at a great price on Amazon! Plus, you get an additional discount if you sign up for regular shipping every month or three months or six months, which makes sense if you are a regular tea drinker like me. (If you are not, Amazon will let you cancel at any time prior to the next shipment.)<br /><br />This tea has good body, excellent flavor and very good color. Rooibos is best brewed at 190F, allowing for steeping from 3 to 5 minutes tops. It has zero caffeine and reportedly has 50 times the antioxidants of green tea. It also has anti-inflammatory and calming properties and hence makes the perfect bedtime tea. Also makes great iced tea, either by itself or in combination with other teas (as I make).

review/summary: Very Weak Tea
review/text: There is another brand of organic rooibos tea offered on Amazon (Choice brand) that I previously ordered.  I gave that tea 5 stars.  Numi also offers a good rooibos.<br /><br />I decided to give Davidson's a chance since it was so cheap.  Now I understand why it's so cheap.  It is extremely weak tea.  2 bags of Davidson's is still not equal to 1 bag of Choice.  Maybe 3 or 4 bags is more like it.<br /><br />I actually ended up throwing out my most recent cup of Davidson's because I had left 2 old bags in there, along with 2 new bags (so 4 bags in total) thinking that maybe I could suck more tea out of the old bags (something I did quite often with the other brands).  But the joke was on me because what the tea ended up tasting like was the bags themselves with just a hint of tea.<br /><br />I feel that drinking this brand of rooibos tea is more like drinking plain water with just the hint of tea flavor.  I doubt I will drink the remaining 96 bags I have left but will instead use them for my tired eyes when I go to bed at night.

review/summary: great value for the $$'s!
review/text: I LOVE rooibos tea - i love it better than any other tea! It wakes me up, reduces my stress level and anxiety, relieves any aches I have and doesn't taste bitter like yerba mate nor awful herby (with rosehips and the like) like Celestial Seasoning's teas.  I still prefer Numi's or Republic of Tea's or Choice's more deeper-tasting red rooibos teas but Davidson's is still great value for the $$'s.  I still get the same great relieving, anxiety & stress-reducing effects as the other rooibos teas.  The flavor is fine also.  Make sure the water is very hot - i microwave mine to boiling - and let the teabag steep in the cup for 20 minutes.  The longer the rooibos steeps, the more rooibos steeps into the water which makes it more flavorful, giving you more healthful benefits.  Just like the other rooibos teas, instead of sugar, I add organic raw honey once the tea is warm or lukewarm (adding the honey in if the water is too hot will deactivate the enzymes and other healthful items inside the honey) to get the honey health benefits, also which also sweetens my tea.  I don't have access to Davidson teas in any of our stores in the city so Amazon providing it with this great Subscribe & Save deal is purrrfect!

review/summary: great tea, not the same as what you get in SA
review/text: We drink this as our house tea. It tastes great we really enjoy it. It is definitely the best stateside rooibos i have had. It does not taste like what i had in South Africa. The store brand there is the real deal, almost has more of a menthol flavor to it. That is the main difference between the two. I would love to have the real stuff, but its kind of pricey to have it shipped over. I love that this tea doesnt get bitter like black tea, its also naturally caffeine free.

review/summary: a decent cup of tea
review/text: I have switched to Rooibos tea because it is low acid and caffein free.  This Organic Rooibos from Davidson's makes a decent cup of tea.  The flavor is a bit weak, but it can be improved by adding an extra tea bag "for the pot" and letting it steep longer.  The bagged organic rooibos from Davidson's has more flavor than their loose leaf, so I think it must be a little higher grade than the loose leaf.  It is okay with milk and sugar, but the milk tends to kill the delicate flavor, so it seems better plain or just with a little sugar.  I read other reviews complaining about the packaging, but Davidson's has corrected that, and now the bags are inside a zip-lock bag within the box.

review/summary: Lovely Rooibos
review/text: This is a lovely rooibos.  I love rooibos, but it is so expensive compared to common black teas!<br />This brand gives you a lot of bang for your buck, so I ordered it.  I wasn't disappointed.  It is a very fine tasting rooibos tea.  I read a review here that said it was weak.  I did not find that so.  What I always do with rooibos is steep it for a full 10 minutes, then squeeze out the tea bag with the back of a spoon pressed against the inside of the cup.  I did so with this brand, and it was just fine.<br /><br />I'll definitely be a repeat customer.  A very nice cup of tea indeed.

review/summary: Quite satisfactory
review/text: If you know what rooibos tastes like, this is an excellent version. But if not, beware, this is not black tea. Or a "substitute." If you are expecting that flavor; well this is not it. If you are trying to cut back on your caffeine, this is a smart choice. It has a pleasant flavor, once you get accustomed to it. But yikes folks, this is not black tea. As a vegetarian I eat various burger-shaped things that are not real meat. The caustic cynic says, "Well, not as good as a real burger." OK maybe not, but they aren't as bad as  a real burger either. They are two different things, and if you think one IS the other, as opposed to being something that serves a similar purpose, then you will be dissatisfied.<br /><br />But if you say, "I enjoy a hot beverage with some punch, but can't do the caffeine," then these are a good value. Trust me. I've been using rooibos for over 30 years; this is a great price on a good tea.<br /><br />And--the bags are not wrapped individually. I hate throwing away all that foil lined paper that will last forever; these teabags come in a ziploc bag that can be re-used.

review/text: I like brewing loose tea and enjoy Davidson's loose rooibos tea but these tea bags are handy for when I don't have time to fuss or when I want to make some iced tea to keep in the refrigerator. Very nice flavor ~ not weak. I like to put a couple seeds from a cardamom pod in either iced or hot tea. It gives it a nice, chai-like flavor.

It's shipped in a box with the tea bags loose in a zip-lock type bag so it stays fresh and there's no hassle and no dealing with paper wrappers.  Huge box, great value.  I use two bags in a 20 ounce cup, pour hot water in and let it steep.  It's got a sweet taste without sweeter added. I also use it with green tea to make iced tea.  Roobios isn't acidic so it is easy on your stomach and you can drink it all day.  I'm now subscribing to have it automatically delivered so I'll never run out.

review/summary: Very flavorful rooibos
review/text: We started drinking rooibos tea at night because of no caffeine.  We first tried the Choice brand, but it was a bit weak.  Davidson's is excellent value, it's organic and it also has a lot of flavor, especially for a tea bag.  We steep a teabag in a teapot of boiling water for about 15 minutes to get as much flavor out of it as we can.<br /><br />The "proper" way to make rooibos tea is to use loose tea, and boil it in a metal teapot on the stove.  Every day you add a teaspoon more of the leaves, more water, and boil it again.  After the first day, you get a very flavorful cup of tea.  After about five days, you start all over again.<br /><br />So no teabag is going to give you that flavor, but it still makes a decent cup of tea.

Finished off 10 tea-bags, 90 more to go. Hope I will make it.<br /><br />Update: I brought it to my office and all colleagues like it when some lemon is added. I changed the rating from 3* to 4*.

review/text: The taste is excellent, and the best thing is that this is 100 percent caffeine-free rooibos tea. Studies indicate that it possesses antimutagenic and antioxidant potential. Apparently there is also an unfermented rooibos tea which has significant health value, too. Some research suggests that both the fermented (which Davidson's is) and the unfermented have antioxidant and other health properties. I discovered this tea in 2007 and have consistently bought this brand. It's good and also inexpensive. Five stars.

review/text: There is another brand of Rooibus that tastes slightly better, but each tea bag costs about ten times as that of the Davidson's brand.  For that reason, I would have to rate the Davidson tea a much better consumer value.  It is a good daily tea if you like the flavor of Rooibos, and you can always serve the high-cost tea for special occasions.

review/text: I received my order in just two days.  I was a little reluctant to order since the last time I purchased Rooibos tea (African Red Bush Tea) was in a health food store.  It was very expensive, but extremely tasty.  The taste of Davidson's is at least as good as the expensive tea.  What makes it so much better is the price.  It is a wonderful product. For all of you who are hesitant to purchase, I suggest you hurry and order.  I am so pleased that I found it.  Anyone who is curious about the bush tea referred to in The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series on HBO, this is it.  I know you will enjoy this tea's wonderful flavor along with its many health benefits.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001LUGL6">Unwrapped teabags, Organic South African Rooibos, Box 100</a>

review/summary: great rooibos tea!
review/text: I love Rooibos  tea and have been purchasing it from Peet's Coffee in the past.  I was looking for a cheaper alternative when I found Davidson's on Amazon.  I was a little wary that the tea much be weaker or less fragrant as the Peet's tea, but it's just as good.  What a fantastic price on a great tea!<br /><br />Rooibos is a full bodied herbal tea that brews very dark.  If you steep Rooibos tea for too long, it doesn't get bitter like other teas.  It has a very aromatic flavor and it has great health benefits.  It's also caffeine free, which makes it a great after supper drink.  I also like it with milk and sugar, or served iced.<br /><br />My only complaint about the tea is that it places all 100 tea bags in a large zip close bag inside the box instead of being individually packaged.  This makes it hard to transport some of it to the office or on trips.  I understand that this helps cut down on costs and packaging, but it's a little inconvenient.  I just put them into smaller zip bags when I don't want to bring all 100 tea bags with me somewhere.
