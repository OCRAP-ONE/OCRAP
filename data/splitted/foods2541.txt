review/summary: Can't compare with Bob's!
review/text: Tried these, which cost less than Bob's Red Mill, however, I prefer the better product, Bob's,  which is from Oregon, USA. I also dislike the idea that I  contributed to the excess fuel consumption, transporting them across the Pacific Ocean, which is the scenario if purchased again from Bergins. I'll recommend Bob's Red Mill.

review/summary: Very tasty olive oil
review/text: I wanted to try this after I saw it won an America's Test Kitchen taste test, then I had a blind taste test for my boyfriend with some plain bread. He noticed a huge difference in taste and fragrance - this one compared to a supermarket brand I usually use, Bertolli, was much fruitier and actually tasted great, and the Bertolli has a slight but unpleasant aftertaste, and not much olive flavor. I was surprised how much we noticed the differences in flavor, this Columela was easily so much better.<br /><br />It was impossible to find in any store, so I'm very happy that Amazon has it, and it arrived quickly and very well-packaged.

review/text: The best EVOO under $40. We live in the Bay Area where there are tons of artisan producers of EVOO and this stuff is by far the best in its price range. There are better ones for 50+ for this size but this oil has a smooth taste, silky in texture and a wonderfully fruity and fresh bouquet and taste. Your mouth will definitely love this! Also rated #1 by America's Test Kitchen and Consumer Reports.

review/summary: A delight to cook with and a delight to taste.
review/text: I have been extremely happy with this Columela oil!  I use a tremendous amount of olive oil in my cooking and I do cook a lot for a lot of people.  For the price, you simply cannot beat this product.  Now I will be the first to admit that you can spend quite a lot of money and buy oil that is far superior to this particular product, but let's face it, in these days and times, cost is a factor!<br /><br />I would strongly suggest that you purchase a couple bottles of this oil and then a few various brands at your local supermarket and make a taste test.  You will be absolutely shocked at the difference.  There simply is no comparison.  This oil has a full taste and the fragrance is wonderful.  Unlike many of the supermarket varieties, you will find this Columela does not leave that particular yucky after taste you so often get.<br />I have shopped and shopped and have been unable to find this product in any store in our area (gulf coast) and have also checked several story in a few larger cities on the west coast...no luck!  Amazon is indeed doing us a big favor in offering this brand.

review/text: We have tried many premiium olive oils and this is among the very best. There is another oil we also enjoy but it has a different flavor. This oil has a distinctive nutty/fruity flavor we really enjoy. I sometimes take a teaspoon of it to savor as you do a sip of nice wine. Crush  garlic into a small jar of it and drizzle  over  fresh green salad.<br />Wonderful stuff at a fair price.<br />Remember, they have been cold pressing olives in Spain for hundreds and hundreds of years. As you might expect....by now they know how to do it!!

After seeing this reviewed by Cooks Illustrated, I ordered it from Amazon and tried it....so very glad I did! No off flavors, never rancid tones...Excellent on green salads, with a bit of vinegar or roasted garlic....also, delightful for a flavorful--but not overpowering--addition in cooking, on pasta, grilled vegetables, etc. I keep it on hand now and use it frequently. As I open the last bottle, I get ready to order another so I won't run out!

review/text: After reading the excellent Tom Mueller book Extra Virginity <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393070212">Extra Virginity: The Sublime and Scandalous World of Olive Oil</a> - I decided to explore some...real olive oil. Far from the supermarket brands I've had for $8 a liter, this Columela costs 4x as much, so I was a bit nervous. Silly me. It's so superior to generic olive oils that I fear I've been ruined for life. No longer will I be able to dip my bread in the schlock from the local Italian restaurant. Nay, I may need to carry my own.<br /><br />Words of warning - this is delicious, and you will find yourself using a lot more than you used that garbage before. You will also be tempted to pair it with good bread, good vegetables, and good pasta. It may entice you to cook more at home. Do not taunt Columela olive oil. It's delicious. Try some.

review/text: When I read my Cook's Illustrated review of this olive oil, I just had to try it. Low and behold, my local grocery store actually had it! They never have things I need/want, so I grabbed 3 bottles of it and it's true...this olive oil is phenomenal. It has a very mild flavor. No bitter aftertaste either. This is the olive oil you use on salads and dipping bread. It's truly fantastic stuff! I am running low, so when I was at my grocery store the other day I went to grab 3 more bottles AND THEY DON'T HAVE IT ANYMORE! That's why I'm here...to buy more on Amazon...my go-to-store-when-my-USELESS-grocery-store-stops-selling-things-I-must-have. Amazon ROCKS. I knew I would find this here. If you're looking for some very good olive oil, look no further. This is it.

My bottle does not have a fruity taste.  Instead, it is somewhat bitter, and I found the taste somewhat unpleasant.  I would much rather pay a little more and get a much tastier oil from O&Co.

review/text: I've been concerned recently about the reported dangers of drinking soymilk. Though these dangers are widely debated, I felt I should err on the side of caution. I had tried Pacific Foods oat milk, but there are also; again widely debated, concerns about carrageenan. I finally discovered Pacific Foods organic 7 grain beverage. It is organic; soy and carrageenan free; and much better tasting to me than soy or almond milk. It's slightly sweet and very smooth. I drink it with all the traditional "milk partners", e.g., cookies ,pbj, and cereal. Especially good on cereal, I like to heat it up and pour it over granola. Whenever I'm asked about milk alternatives, which, I grant, is a rare occurance, I recommend Pacific Foods 7 grain beverage. It is the complete package for me, and I recommend it highly for this review

review/summary: Excellent Coffee
review/text: This is one of my favorite K-Cups out of the 20 or so we currently have on hand.<br />It just has a very satisfying flavor, not too strong, not too weak, not bitter.<br />I put about 1/3rd of a teaspoon of sugar and about 3 Teaspoons (one tablespoon) of 1/2 & 1/2 and its just perfect.<br /><br />I personally buy this from Bed Bath & Beyond because amazingly it is cheaper there.<br />I get 20% off coupons from them about every 3 weeks, in fact get 2 because I have my wife get them at her work also so we get 2 a month plus sometimes a $5 off of $15 coupon on top of that.<br />So I pay $8.15 (after tax) for a pack of 18, that works out to $24.45 for 3 packs (54 K-Cups) so much better deal than $38 for 48.

review/summary: One of my consistent favorites
review/text: No matter how many different types of coffee I try for my Keurig, the Sumatran Bold is always one of the ones I come back to.  Flavorful, rubust, rich but not bitter.  This is the one I go to when I want a nice strong cup.<br /><br />In milder times, I enjoy the Columbian Supremo from Timothy's and Breakfast Blend from Green Mountain.<br /><br />Give this a shot!

review/text: This is just wonderful. Full-bodied and very flavorful. #2 in my top five. After trying dozens of blends (yes, dozens) - Green Mountain has distinguished itself as the leader of the k-cup pack. I'm not much for "flavored" coffee (though I do appreciate the aromas), but Green Mountain coffees (especially the bolds and extra bolds) are very robust and just plain taste GREAT.

review/summary: Perfect K-Cup Coffee
review/text: This is the best coffee available for a Keurig machine.  By far, IMHO.<br /><br />Since getting my Keurig brewer I have tested 30+ blends (keeping a spreadsheet with a ranking system of all things), and of all the K-cup varieties that I've tried this blend stands out as by far the best.<br /><br />The coffee is bold and strong, but not at all bitter or overpowering, and it stands up up well to cream and sugar.<br /><br />The flavor is woodsy but smooth and mellow, with a slight hint of citrus and a mild nuttiness.  The balance just works right.<br /><br />Every day I brew this K-cup first thing in the morning and although I love to experiment with new blends, this one consistently tops the charts and every other blend is simply a comparison.<br /><br />One more thing, if you are new to k-cups, please do a little research into the fair trade and organic origins of this coffee and that alone should be enough to make one a dedicated fan.

review/summary: Good, Dark Cup of Coffee
review/text: I am always on the lookout for a good strong cup of coffee and this product serves up just that!  I brew it on the "large cup" setting and it easily stands up to the addition of cream.  My mug is rather large, so 2 k-cups fill it to the brim.  At this price, it only comes to 80 cents a mug -- much less than what I would spend at my local coffee shop!  I will purchase this product again (and again)...

I truly have no preference between the Green Mountain Organic Sumatran Reserve and Green Mountain Newman's Own Special Blend.  These are my favorite extra bold coffees available in K Cups.

review/text: I recently purchased the Kerig coffee maker, and have been buying different coffee's to find the ones that I want to stay with and re order. I love a strong coffee, but not bitter .. this coffee is very nice, I make it by the mug, first I brew 6oz and then just add another 8oz. all with the same K-cup. and it is still nice and favorful.also has a nice mild lingering smoky after taste. Don't know for sure if I will re-order or not. still experimenting.. I have shopped for the k-cup coffee at other sites, and I feel that Amazon is still the best price.. If you don't have the Kerig maker then get one, as it makes the best coffee anywhere..

review/text: I was very pleased with this order!  Finally a very bold blend but I was surprized by the definitely nutty finish.  This is a great departure from the other coffees that taste the same from start of sip to end.  With the Sumatran Reserve, you get an excellent strong coffee taste while sipping but a great nutmeg-like aftertaste.<br /><br />Another thing, this has to be the highest caffeine blend I've tried so far.  It really wakes me up in the morning!  But I move to a milder blend like Kona or Dietrich for the afternoons.<br /><br />A big thumbs up for a non-flavored coffee.

I enjoy it better than both the Sumatran offerings from Starbucks. I would say it is right on par with the caribou Sumatran product. only ones that I have enjoyed even a little more were products from  Cats Ass Coffee harvested from animal droppings (Kopi luwak)at over $150 a pound 0.o and the Sumatran offered by S&D...

review/text: I'm a big fan of very bold, very dark coffee and have tried literally dozens of bold k cups.<br /><br />Timothy's Midnight Magic, Rainforest Espresso, Emeril's and Tully's French Roast are also dark coffees that I will buy as well but this one has the best flavor for me. It is not bitter and muddy looking, it's smooth. Most importantly, it gives a flavorful, not weak cup of java on the 9.5 ounce setting. Not many k cups do that. They become coffee flavored water at the 9.5 ounce size.

We love to stay home and I like to eat at home because I know my food at home is much better than anywhere else in the world (according to my husband). Actually I don't drink coffee or tea on a regular basis, I prefer to drink water or fresh juice. BUT I love the smell of coffee in the morning and having my husband enjoy a good cup of coffee. So... for mother's day as a gift to me from me I purchased the single serving coffee machine. It is easy to use, looks good in my kitchen and brew a perfect cup of coffee every time. We purchased the sampler first and try many different kind and he decided he like the Sumatran coffee the best.

review/summary: Worst Sumatran K-Cup of All
review/text: For reference, I have tried The Puck sumatran and the Diedrich. This Green Mountain sumatran was bitter and lifeless. It tasted stale and old, even though it was well within the sell-by date. For further reference, I also roast my own sumatran at home. I rate that a 10, starbucks would be a 9, the Puck k-cups would be an 8 as the best of the k-cups. I give this a flat 1. Very disappointing, will not purchase again. I wrote this about five minutes after finishing a cup, and I still have a terrible, bitter aftertaste. A true sumatran will have an earthy, almost tangy flavor, but with no bitterness. I would say they used coffee beans that had been sitting around for a while.

review/text: I like my coffee strong, bold, and dark. Of all the varieties I have tried, this is my hands-down favorite to fit the bill. Its consistently good with a robust, smokey, complex flavor. I have noticed that it also does not have the bitter tinge that many of the Dark Magic varieties have (which I like, by the way... but not if you're drinking more than one cup at a setting).<br /><br />A word of warning: many of my family members and friends who have tried it find it too strong and dark for their tastes. If you want a little dark and bold, you could go with something like the Coffee People Black Tiger (also a favorite of mine) which is similar in my opinion, but a little less intense. If you dig the big bold flavor, however, you won't be dissapointed with this one!

review/summary: Great coffee, bad service..
review/text: This is an excellent coffee but unlike Amazon's usual great service whoever they use to fulfill the coffee orders is terrible.  I ordered several boxes of this coffee from Amazon but they were shipped to me just thrown in a box.  Anywhere from one-quarter to one-half of the cups were damaged and unusable.  Worse yet Amazon won't take a return since it is a food item.<br /><br />In summary, buy this coffee, just not from Amazon.

review/text: The taste of the coffee was very bitter and smelled horrible.  Though the capsule concept is more convenient the product quality has to deliver and this does not at all meet expectations.  The flavor was 'off' and tasted under-roasted and foul.

review/summary: Sweet and Delicious
review/text: *****<br />Stash's Licorice Spice Caffeine Free Herbal Tea has a the sweet flavor licorice teas are known for, along with several nice spices that complement the licorice in a lovely, more-subtle-than-chai way. Licorice Spice Tea contains licorice root, cinnamon, orange peel, star anise, sarsaparilla, natural vanilla flavor, natural orange flavor, natural clove flavor, natural cardamom flavor, and natural cinnamon flavor. Sweet and delicious!<br /><br />You don't need to add anything at all to Licorice Spice Tea, even if you normally like your tea sweetened. It is perfect just as is. It also has a very smooth taste, despite all of the flavorings. The tea bags come stamped with an expiration date, which I like, so that you can be sure the tea is fresh. The date on mine is 26 months away, so you can take your time :)<br /><br />Definitely recommended.<br />*****

The Amazon reviewers didn't accept my first review because I guess I didn't say enough about the product.  Well, I mentioned it has less than half the fat of mayo.  That's a good thing.  It tastes great on pretzels.  It would probaly taste great on the right kind of sandwich, and I'm sure it would be great on a burger. Delicious, yummy, creamy, thick, not runny, but not too thick, comparatively low in fat.  Have I talked about the quality or properties of this food product enough to pass Amazon review muster?<br />$9/ jar is pretty darned pricey though.

review/text: In my opinion, this is not a good roast for espresso.  It is described on the package as a medium roast, but it looks and tastes like a very light roast.  For taste reference, I actually prefer a dark roast.<br /><br />It also tastes very old, however, as there is no date on the package I have no way to tell the age of the roast.<br /><br />I will not buy this particular variety again.

Fruit flavors are authentic with overall sweetness and just a touch of sourness to make your mouth water. Fresh and chewy. We would have rated this 5-stars but the fact that the box is not resealable is a negative factor. But then maybe you are supposed to finish off all 5 ounces while enjoying the movie with no need to seal the box closed again!

review/summary: Great Results with Miltons and Consumer Alert
review/text: I purchased a box of 12 packages (the only amount offered) of Miltons Baking Company Whole Wheat Sesame crackers on Amazon because i was desperate to find a reliable source.  I love these crackers!  As a whole wheat cracker, Milton's are the very best...crispy, flavorful and delicious!  However, when i received my crackers from the distributor(not Miltons) they had a mere 30 days left on the pull date.  It's hard to chug-a-lug twelve packages in 30 days! They were already stale and oddly chipped as if mice had been nibbling along the edges. Yuck! When i contacted the distributor, they refused entirely to back the product and left me hanging with a costly mistake, useless crackers, and a very bad taste in my mouth for Miltons and them.  Frustrated, i contacted Miltons Baking Company directly.  What a pleasure!  They let me know that the "mice nibbles" were from pins holding the crackers during packaging and were below their acceptable product standard. And, in a really generous gesture, they let me know immediately that, although the crackers were beyond the pull date, they would be happy to replace them under the circumstances!  Every aspect of my experience with the Milton Baking Company was amazingly warm and responsive -- and quick.  I'm looking forward to my deeeelicious crackers.  They are the best!  And i am very grateful for a company that really stands behind their product guarantee of full satisfaction.  Yes!  Thanks, Miltons!

It isn't as complex as making it yourself, but it is a good, no time substitute.<br /><br />I have tried about 10 different bottled sauces and this is by far the best on the market.  It is not sickly sweet, and by using a little more than suggested it can be as hot as you want it to be.<br /><br />I guess the best compliment I can give it is that it is the best of all the bottles sauces available.

review/text: Fantastic marinade for all meats and even mushrooms. The sauce is sweet and spicy but not too hot, and has a taste of sesame oil as well. Unlike so many bbq sauces, this one does not burn up and turn black, even on the grill, and for stir frying we use this with no oil in the wok, as the sauce seems to have a touch of oil, and does not need it. Great stuff, and I have had korean bbq in Japan, where they love the stuff. CJ is the real deal.

I used it as a marinade and then as a topping for several different pork flavors. I think it could be a bit stickier and glazier (if that's even a word) My issue was that it didnt stick well to pork to create a crust/glaze but ran off to the sides and burned. Not bad over all.

Instead of the bags being lined up and covered with a protective cellophane wrap, they were tossed into the mailing box without any protective wrapping. Individual bags were all crushed.

review/text: One.  Single.  Solitary.  Singular.  One is the loneliest number that you'll ever use.  Uno.  Einz.<br /><br />The marketing folks at Lay's got it right.  No one can eat just one.  Nor should they.  LAY'S POTATO CHIPS, the consummate snack of Americana, are not designed for solitary servings; they are here to be consumed prodigiously--by handful after greasy handful.  Crisp, fresh, salty spud nirvana, these are chips to munch not in solitary discipline, nor one per serving (egads), but in numbers too high to count.  Wherever there are hamburgers or hot dogs being grilled, wherever there are tailgating parties, wherever there are social gatherings of casual consequence, bags of LAY'S POTATO CHIPS make their tasty presence known.  We munch, we crunch, we scarf a bunch in a hunch.  And--always--we come back for more.<br /><br />So banish the thought of eeking out an existential existence of snack food discipline; treat yourself to wholesome goodness that transcends generations of hearty crunchers.  Become, like moi, a master magician.  See how fast you can make one of these bags of spud nuggets disappear.  Chow, er, ciao!<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.

I say this because after rice cakes are exposed to air, they just don't taste right to me.  This bag is the perfect size!  I love this bag because it's enough snack for satisfying that need for a "crunchy" snack. And they are even a bit sweet, so they help to off set the sweet tooth after a salad for lunch!  Ok so they are for kids, but I bought them for my daughter and ate some, and now I'm eating them with & without her!
