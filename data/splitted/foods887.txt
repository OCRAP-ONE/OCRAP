review/summary: Um, no.
review/text: I'd heard about this on triple D and a few other places, and thought, "Well, if they're ranting THIS MUCH, it must be GREAT." Nah.<br /><br />Used it on chicken TWICE (the reviews I'd read slobbered all over how good it was supposed to be with chicken), and it SUCKED. Not that it was nauseating, it just had no flavor at all. We have a pretty broad palate--like all kinds of foods--but this had  no real flavor profile at all. I've read it described as 'lemony', etc.: don't you believe it. I loaded the food up with lemon and this stuff, and it pretty much...just lay there.<br /><br />Frankly: we grew up poor and couldn't afford too many spices or extras, and my mom's roast chicken with JUST salt, pepper and butter rocked WAAAAAAAAY more than this. Save your money is my instinct. I still plan to try it mixed with some other herbs, so I'll update, and hopefully find a recipe or two that is worth the investment.<br /><br />The company DOES give you a LOT for your money, in the way of sheer amount of the spice that they send you. I'd be very open to anyone here who wanted to send me recipes or ways to use it that might change my initial impression. So look out for future updates.

review/summary: Sweet and phony
review/text: This product was a surprise disappointment. Though the label and product description herein indicate that this Nielsen Massey "Tahitian"vanilla is "pure" vanilla extract, it actually contains sugar.  There is no good reason for vanilla extract to contain sugar unless the flavor needs an artificial boost. Even run-of-the-mill McCormack Vanilla Extract does not contain sweetener. I am returning the product. It receives one star because it smells good, but no more because it tastes sweet and phony.

review/summary: Tahitian Vanilla is the BEST
review/text: The first time I had Tahitian vanilla I was in New Orleans and it was cooked into a pastry that came with my breakfast, the Tahitian vanilla made the difference. It was the most incrediable tasting... my mouth waters just thinking about it. My family thought I was crazy, so I made them to batches of homemade vanilla ice cream using Nielsen Massey vanilla both times, but for one batch I used Tahitian and the other Madigascar. They too were blown away by the difference in taste.  It's more expensive, as the supply is less. Mexican vanilla also has a different taste that you should try...don't limit yourself and stop using the cheap vanilla that has almost no vanilla!

review/summary: Sweet with a slight kick
review/text: I love this new chili sauce by Frank's.  It is slightly chunky, great tasting with a nice blend of sweet and spicy.  I like spicy and I wouldn't mind even spicier but I think this will be the right "heat" for most people.  It is great on burritos, chimichangas, flautas, chicken strips, chicken breasts.  It makes a great chip dip by pouring it on top of a block of cream cheese.  It is also great for dipping carrot and celery sticks.

review/summary: Great Dipping Sauce
review/text: This is a slightly hot, spicy sauce. It can be used in place of hot sauce, but doesn't have a lot of kick. It also has more of a syrupy consistency due to it's high sugar content (it also has a high salt content, a real health food). Good on burgers, hotdogs, chicken and even pressed grilled tofu. Where this really shines is as a dip. This has become a go to for all of our finger food type items. Good with anything fried and a perfect compliment to vegetarian sushi. Destined to become a staple in our house.

review/text: Delicious, thick, sweet sauce -- but, as the little illustration of a thermometer on the label indicates, it's not terribly hot. It DOES have terrific flavor, and plenty of it. I was expecting more heat. You'll want to back this up with some other source of heat, red pepper flakes or some Huy Fong Sriracha sauce. And you'll want to buy at least two or three bottles of this Frank's sauce -- it's so good that it just seems to vanish after you open a bottle...

review/summary: Don't listen to the naysayer - these are superb!
review/text: I don't know about the person who didn't care for these much and gave only one star - that person gave no reasons. So I can only imagine that they have an excessively sweet tooth and probably like a fatty taste - which is what you get with most of the other products out there that make their stuff just too downright sweet and frankly also use questionable ingredients as sweeteners<br /><br />I think Nana does a great job.  Now I think so does Pamela's kitchen, so it isn't the only game in town. But Pamela puts out a very different product.  One of the really good things about Nanas in addition to the fact I think it is really well done, is that they are individually wrapped, so nothing starts to go stale or dry out after the package is opened, and it is really easy to pack these things with lunch or to have as a snack during the day.  They can be a tad on the dry side - not too much but probably for some people.  So have tea or the like ready.

review/text: Initially, I thought these were pretty expensive cookies but I think they're totally worth the money! My daughters don't have food allergies but I do limit their sugar intake. I really like the face that these cookies are sweet only from juices and not refined sugar. We bought the chocolate chips and I think they taste just like any typical chocolate chip cookie. My very-picky four-year-old can't get enough. I only wish they were a bit cheaper but I understand that with quality ingredients, etc. comes a price tag so I'm willing to fork out the bucks for these yummy cookies.

review/text: Melitta coffee is an excellent coffee for daily use.  It is a little stronger than most American brands, but your taste quickly adapts to it and you do not want to go back to regular coffee.  To me, Brazilian coffee tastes better than Colombian coffee and is smoother to drink with a good flavor.  I would recommend that anyone try a bag and see for yourself; just use a little less than usual to keep it from being too strong.

review/summary: Some important issues
review/text: This product is as described. Here are some issue I had with the installation. The wire used is aluminum wire. If you need additional wire, you need to match the same type of wire to prevent a galvanic reaction which could cause corrosion and a bad connection. The plastic poles are very flimsy. If your fence will be a straight line, you will need to support the end posts. If your fence will be enclosing something, you will need to support the poles wherever there is a turn in the fence.<br /><br />The cord is quite short. I had to use an extension cord for my application. Additionally, there are no insulated wires provided. If you need insulated wiring from the unit to the fence, you will need to provide that yourself.<br /><br />The poles are also pretty short. I got this to keep cats away from the aviary. If the cats figure out that they can simply jump over the fence, I'll have to change the setup.<br /><br />There is a newer model available. I have not seen one personally, but some of the issues seem to have been resolved with it. For example, the wiring included is galvanized wire instead of aluminum. That is easier to find than aluminum wire should you need more.

review/summary: Worked for Pond
review/text: I bought the Fi-shock kit to keep a raccoon out of my small backyard pond. The raccoon was destroying my water plants, and I later learned that they love water hyacinth (it's like candy to them).<br /><br />After I set up the fence, I didn't have a single attack for a whole summer.<br /><br />This year, I am setting up a garden in the back, and know from experience that raccoons will attack the corn I'm planning to grow. I think I'm going to order a new kit and use that rather than attempt to build an ugly fence or cages for my raised beds. During the day, I can turn off the system and the wires will still keep out my small dog and child.

review/summary: Electric fence
review/text: It works, it delivers a nasty little shock...it got my dog once and made her yelp. I leaned against it once (accidently) and it got my attention real quick. It managed to kill a squirrel, fry a rat and short-circuit a mouse when they got caught between the wires...and yet somehow the wild rabbits still got into my pumpkin patch and trashed my entire harvest! That's more of a design flaw...next year I'll run solid fencing 3' high and then use this runing along the top.<br /><br />Just buy the shock unit by itself. The green post are flimsy, I ended-up using 1-foot rebar into the ground, having 1/2-inch PVC slide over that, and then used duct-tape to attach the green tubes to the white PVC....you use the green tubes because they have the holes drilled in them to run the wire through. Got a drill? Do it yourself. As for wire, they don't include enough. You can buy more at OSH, Home Depot didn't care much selection of small-guage wire.<br /><br />One thing to know: if the system gets shorted-out in any way, the whole thing goes down!!! If a mouse gets into the wires and dies there, it's little body will keep the system shorted and the whole thing collapses: no shock field. I had a neighbors fig tree drop a fig that fell between two wires...the fig dry-roasted on the wires and sure-enough, no electric shock happening!<br /><br />Get a little voltage 'tick' tester at Home Depot for $7....it makes a beeping noise and flashes when it senses voltage, you'd be surprised how you can wire a whole system and then somehow it gets shorted..run those wires clean and check the system routinely!  Happy shocking! :)

review/summary: Time tested for 13 years, still going strong.
review/text: I bought one of these 13 years ago, to keep a dog out of my garden.  I'm on a new dog, but the same old fence charger.  I've replace everything but the charger over the years (wear and tear, taking the fence down and putting it back up every year) but have never had a problem with the unit.<br /><br />Some information:<br /><br />You can use any wire you want with the charger unit. I've got mine hooked up with the cheapest galvanized steel wire I could find at the hardware store.<br /><br />You can use any kind of post as long as you insulate the wire from the post. I did it by snipping little rings of plastic tubing and threading the wire through those, which I attached to bamboo stakes with plastic zip ties.  At the end of the season, I just pull up the posts and coil the wire up, posts and all.  Makes setup a snap the next year.<br /><br />This thing works great for deer.  I have one wire, a foot off the ground, and it protects my garden all summer.  I bait the fence each spring by putting peanut butter on aluminum foil and folding it over the wire, so that deer don't just step over it without touching it.  Anyway, I've watched deer grazing at the plants growing under the wire, then zap!  The deer runs off.  Two or three days after I turn it off in the fall, the deer come in and clean up the leftovers.<br /><br />The dog only zapped herself twice, once each spring for the first two years.  Now she acts like the garden doesn't exist.<br /><br />I hang my unit on a post out in the garden, run an extension cord to it, and cover the whole thing with a plastic bucket to keep the rain off.<br /><br />A non-contact circuit tester is a handy way to make sure it's working. (Or you can do it the hard way!)<br /><br />Anyway, I love the product, and it has stood the test of time for me.

review/summary: Great to help keep dog inside new chain link fence
review/text: I had a new chain link fence installed to contain my lab.  Smart lab found out that she could still get out going under the chain link right between two support poles, at the base of the fencing.  Enter the Fido Shocker.  We used an outside porch light which had two bulbs.  Removed one bulb and installed a piece from the hardware store that looked like the threaded end of a light bulb, but was an electical outlet.  This is where we plugged the charger in.  We ran the wire around the base of the fencing, inside the yard.  When the back porch light was on, the fence was hot.  The dog touched it with her nose twice.  It made her yelp.  Then she decided it was easier to just remain in the yard.  Well worth the money.  Easy to set up in a short amount of time.  My husband touched it to see how strong it was.  He warned me not to touch it, becuase he felt is was strong enough it might bring tears to my eyes, so I never touched it.  When we moved, we took it all down, put it in the box and I still have it, but have not needed to use it since then.  It works!!

review/summary: if you have a digging dog in the garden, thisWORKS!!!
review/text: This FI-Shock SS 725RP AC works! Our 11 Yr. old labrador decided to start digging at garden age 9,as there is a cider block barrier wal at the back of it, that the garden fence seperated the dog from. Mice find the wal as an oasis,because our dog,who patroled the wall religiously, can now no longer get there to keep them away. He therefore could not stay out of our 20x20 garden, once a fence went up. we have a chicken wire fence around it, and he just dug at the bottom constantly. we installed this unit and it quickly stopped him. we heard him yelp aboout 3x's, and that was all that was needed.It is not most convienient to have to plug it in, but the price break for an AC unit compared to a solar unit makes up for this. We turned it off a few times, and our dog would know,so I assumed they can feel a vibration or hear a frquency, but that theory fell through as it has been unplugged for a month now and no digging.It works great for us.I plan to put in at the base of the porch where we buily a shed where the our dog digs like crazy, as there are mice or moles around it. it really works. also those plastic owls thatyou can purchase seem to keep squirrels nd birds form eating tomatoes, peppers and so on. 'Hope to store it and use it again next summer. I totally recomend it!

review/summary: Good product for the price.  Some installation issues.
review/text: This review is mostly about installation issues.  The target is a raccoon who's been laying waste to my small pond.<br /><br />The included fence posts (just plastic stakes) are a problem if you have to drive them through anything but the softest dirt.  I had better luck using 3/4 inch Schedule 40 plastic pipe, cutting several lengths about six inches to a foot long, and driving the pipe sections into the dirt until only about an inch or so sticks out.  Once this is done, the pre-drilled plastic stake drops neatly into the pipe end.  You might have to use a hose to flush some dirt out of the inside of the plastic pipe.<br /><br />This also makes it easy to remove small installations around a garden or pond or something, since once you've discouraged the animal you can just lift the stakes out of the pipes, roll everything up, and put it away until you need it again.<br /><br />The box that generates the voltage is not weatherproof, which would have been nice, but I expect it would have added to the price.  Unless you have a sheltered area right near your installation, you'll need an electrical outdoor junction box or something to protect that box.  My junction box cost about 35 bucks, a Wiegmann 8x8x4 outdoor enclosure.<br /><br />I'm going to add an on-off switch in its own enclosure box, and a photocell to turn the thing off when daylight comes.  I don't trust myself to remember to disconnect it every morning, and I've got nothing against squirrels.

review/text: I wanted to let my chickens roam freely in my back yard but they kept digging up my flower garden I installed this fence in  30 minutes. One chicken  wandered into it on day 2, she let out a loud squawk and strutted away. The rest of the chickens must have learned their lesson because its been over 2weeks and nobody has gotten near the flower garden. I don't even turn it on any more.

review/summary: My Favorite Oatmeal Brand; My Favorite Flavor
review/text: Growing up on Quaker and therefore eating Quaker Instant Oatmeal in the mornings, I was pleasantly surprised when I bought Nature's Path Oatmeal on a whim one day seeing it in my goldbox. I have since been ordering nothing but Nature's Path Oatmeal from Amazon. It's cheaper on Amazon than at Costco or Sprouts (local farmer's market) and I will likely never go back to anything else.<br /><br />The multigrain raisin flavor is my favorite for both flavor and texture, having a sweet, but not too sweet, cinnamon raisin flavor and a mixed-size and texture oat consistency. If you like raisins in your oatmeal buy this once and you'll likely never go back to anything else (except maybe the other Nature's Path flavors)<br /><br />I know this probably sounds like I work for Nature's Path or something, but really the oatmeal is that good that I took the time to go online and write a review about it. I hope Amazon keeps stocking it and I hope more people can enjoy it based on my review.

review/summary: Tried other oatmeal on Amazon with High ratings.  This one is the BEST!
review/text: I normally do not write reviews but after wasting money on the steel cut oatmeal that had high ratings and other flavors of Natures Path I figured I would try to save others time and money.  I have tried many of the other oatmeal products on Amazon and have found this one to be the best tasting.  You do not need to add any additional raisins, sugar, or fruit.  It is great just the way it is and is ready in 1 minute 30 seconds in the microwave.  This is my pick for the best oatmeal on Amazon!!

review/text: We live on the road in a motorhome and travel the US. We found this particular brand of oatmeal in a store in Mesa, AZ. We loved it so much and couldn't find it when we got back to MN. Now, it is on AMAZON! What a shock to find it there. We really thought the price was good, except you have to buy so much. The good news is that it doesn't go bad right away, so we will have a 4 month supply on hand. Thanks for having this brand available anywhere we go.

review/summary: Filling and healthy meal
review/text: I was skeptical at first about purchasing this item. For one, I have never purchased food items off Amazon and two, I wasn't sure how much leeway you get with expiration dates.  Happily I can say this experience went well. I received all 6 boxes, intact, and promptly. The expiration dates are surly nothing for me to worry about the dates are well over the amount of time to take me to eat them. This flavor is very good and I believe it is not a sweet as Quaker Oats brand. Being that they are less sweet and organic is a plus for me and exactly what I was looking for. There is a good amount of raisins and it tastes splendid with water added. Usually I add milk to enrich the taste, but I find there is no need with this brand.<br /><br />The price is good too. I will most likely order again, but try other flavors.

review/summary: Excellent breakfast or evening snack
review/text: My husband and I love this oatmeal.  We fix it in the microwave.  To avoid it overflowing the bowl, we put the oatmeal in the bowl first, then add 1 cup of water (which is a bit more than the package indicates) - we don't stir - that it important.  Then we put it in our 1000 watt microwave for 2 1/2 minutes.  It comes out perfectly.  I add a little creamer or Almond milk - my husband prefers no additives except some sweetnlow.  Sometimes for a change of pace we add in half a packet of some instant flavored oatmeal in the bowl and increase the water a bit. My son loves it too when he visits though he prefers to boil water on the stove and then add it without using the microwave - he says it has a nicer texture that way but I don't see a difference. I have this coming at intervals with Amazon's subscribe and save.  It is available at my local grocery but at a higher price than Amazon's subscribe and save price.  I'm always pleased with Amazon's service.  Give this oatmeal a try - the nice soft raisins make it a special treat.

It's got the nickname of "the soup" from my friends in college because of how great it is. The pack comes and says just boil and drop in the egg, but it's best to add some carrots and mushrooms. We've also added green onions on top as well as some extra hot sauce/soy sauce to fit people's tastes... it's seriously ridiculously great.

review/summary: Old Cats bouncing around: Good nutrition!
review/text: Our two orange males are approximately 10 and 11 years old. They both experienced health problems this summer with cystitis plus anal gland infections in our "double wide" Tigger. We started out with Merrick with grain and have transitioned them without issue to the before grain.<br />Tigger was 24.5lbs and is now below 19lbs. Gracie had a slight weight problem and now is at a steady weight. They both love the food, thankfully.  They lived on dry food until this summer when they became so ill. We were told to use Hills prescription, but it was so hard to get it from the vet, I decided to do some reading to find a good food I could buy easily.<br />This food is expensive;however, vet bills are much worse.  Both cats have beautiful coats now. They play, run around as if they are much younger and have not been ill since being on this diet.

Be sure and check the dates (if you can, there weren't any on the in-shell nuts) because there's not much worse than ruining whatever you're trying to make with rancid nuts.  I have learned to only purchase pecans from places with dates on the package or where I can smell and taste them!

review/text: I have purchased most of the food tek fast and fresh line.  I ordered everything with really low expectations, but thought it would be good to have the items for emergencies and traveling.<br /><br />I have been pleasantly surprised by almost all of the items, with the hamburger buns being my very favorite.  I can now mix up my own bun and microwave it for 90 secs, then toast it for a minute or two and I have the most enjoyable gluten free bun I have ever had.  I so look forward to having this bun, that it really surprises me.  It is ok without toasting, but for me, the toasting made it really delicious.  I often use this for other types of sandwiches.<br /><br />I love the fact I can have one bun, freshly made right when I want it.  I no longer have to make big batches and freeze, or buy some inferior card board like bun.

And secondly, does it fall apart or can you actually eat a burger with it? The flavor is similar to white bread buns with a bit of sweetness, and it holds together beautifully through the sloppiest hamburger. Tasty!

review/text: These were a real disappointment. After trying their Minute Coffee Cake and loving it, I had high expectations. The hamburger buns were tough, and then turned hard as a brick. They were awful, and we ended up throwing them away. A real bummer....a great cheeseburger on a bun is the thing I miss most being a celiac! Do try their Coffee Cake, though. It was fantastic, and you only add water and microwave for a minute! Feels like cheating in the morning, and perfect for those in a rush. Be sure and don't throw the baking container away, as it looks like you can order just the refills without the container for less money.

review/summary: A nice occasional treat
review/text: I tried this product with very low expectations on account of a couple bad reviews I read here but I was pleasantly surprised. I found the texture very light and fluffy even after they had sat on the counter for an extended period which makes me think that the person who found them tough and hard must have cooked them way too long for their particular microwave or skimped on the water, and unlike the other negative reviewer, I found them less 'tasteless' then regular Wonder Bread hamburger buns although the taste was a tad pancake-like.<br /><br />The buns were less "real" looking then those represented in the promo image (I guess those were toasted). The bun was very stark white out of the microwave. The buns are over-sized for me but they are not at all crumbly which is good for hamburgers. Like the other GF products by Food-Tek these buns are probably most suited to send with children eating over at a friend's house, daycare, or at thier grandparent's as they can be prepared with practically no effort at all by the hosts in those circumstances. Making them is hugely easy and using the molds is fun... I think a ten year-old or a mature eight year-old could probably make them for themselves and would enjoy that. Note: The buns comes out of the microwave VERY  hot and you must let them cool fully before eating so that the texture stabilizes.<br /><br />Today I used this kit to make a breakfast sandwich with a microwaved egg, sausage, and a slice of cheese.

review/text: My dogs (2 large) suffered color/preservative allergy, and the other a vitamin c deficency.  This brand was reccomended by my vet and I have been using this brand with no further problems for some time.  At first I could only find this brand at the horse supply store, which was not so convenient, so I was happy to see these products online, with free shipping.  I love the brand which does not use artificial colors, preservatives and is well balanced.<br /><br />I did forget which variety of this brand I normally buy...and with a 50 and 90 lb dog, I would be happier with the kibble size in the "large breed" variety.  I purchased this variety because it was a good deal, but I did expect the kibble size to be at least as large as the other varieties I had tried.  In a 50 lb bag, I would assume most people would purchase for a large dog so it's good to know the kibble size:  flat discs 1/2" diameter by 1/8" thick, mixed with tube shapes 1/2" long by 1/4" diameter.

review/summary: Too thick but otherwise great
review/text: SHORT VERSION: Get the 2" version instead, but these are great!<br /><br />--------------------------<br />Preface: I'm a *HUGE* sour gummi worm lover.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Actually SOUR (they use that "sour patch kid" sour powder)<br />-9 lbs for $10..<br /><br />CONS:<br />-4" Worms are too big/thick<br />-Jaw hurts from chewing :x<br /><br />I would definitely buy these again, but next time I will buy the 2" versions instead. Everybody loves these, esp that they are actually sour, but the worms are so thick/big that your jaw starts to hurt from the chewing them.

review/summary: Great, but needs more flavors
review/text: PROS:<br />Sour (In fact, the first thing people tell me when they eat these is just that). Not too sour, just right.<br />Flavorful! Biting into the orange half of the Orange/Blue Raspberry worm is like having someone smash an orange into my mouth. In a good way.<br />They smell great, in fact, they filled up the entire room with fruity goodness when I opened the bag.<br />9 pounds is a lot of worms, although the size of the box fooled me.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Can melt. I made the mistake of ordering these at the end of June. BIIIIG mistake. While in the shade of the UPS truck, the southern blaze fused them together. Good news though, this does not affect the great taste at all beyond how you now have an amorphous blob of fruity fusion. Good stuff.<br />The abundant smell can make it hard to hide the worms from pesky siblings :S<br />With only 3 kinds of worms (Green Apple/Lemon, Cherry/Lemon, and Orange/Blue Raspberry), things get boring after a while.<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br />"2 months is the most common subscription period" People, really? That's just not healthy.

I ended up getting a friend another order of these, and he just finished a bag for about 3 weeks and still has a bag to go. The flavor of the worms are pretty similar to the Trolli brand. Overall I am happy with the bags of Sour Gummy Worms.

review/text: let me first say that i love sour candies, but these worms were way too sour, to the point that you can't really taste much flavor because the sourness overpowers everything.  there are only 3 color combos, as seen in the picture (yellow/green, red/yellow, and orange/blue).  that's right, there is NO blue/pink combo like the trolli ones, which is quite disappointing.  and even if you put the red half with the blue half, it wouldn't taste like the trolli ones either.  in the case of sour worms, albanese &lt; trolli, hands down.

review/text: Let's be honest, a brewed cup might be a little bit better, but I really like this instant and it just makes it easier at the office where we have hot water, but no coffee maker. It is really inexpensive as the coffee is in really small granules and the jar is really big and so it makes tons of cups of coffee.  I like to be highly caffeinated and this works for me.  I also get the Vanilla flavor sometimes.  It's quite good also.  Thanks Ben for turning me onto this great coffee!

review/summary: Insant Brakfast of Champions
review/text: I can't find the "Sugar-Free" version of this in my local supermarkets. So, hello Amazon! I have been drinking Carnation Instant Breakfast for years, I bet 20 years at least. It mixes easily with milk, even skim milk. However, I have cut back on as much sugar as I can. Now I mix it with Blue Diamond Unsweetened Almond Milk and it doesn't come out as well. I have to slowly pour in the powder while stirring vigorously, and I still get small chunks that won't mix. But at least my blood sugar is down. I was surprised at the amount of sugar in milk!<br />Anyway, it still is the easiest and most satisfying breakfast for weekdays. It keeps me full at least until lunch.

review/summary: Not as good as the original
review/text: I started buying the sugar free version to cut back on my sugar intake. There's a noticeable difference between the two which is as obvious as a regular coke and a diet coke. I learned to add coffee, bananas, and ice to make it taste better. I noticed that Carnation has significantly cuts back on the amount of powder in each packet; so much so it seems wasteful to continue to use the same packet.

Only negative is that it's a nasty laxative, so only eat a few at a time.

review/text: After buying bags one at a time (at a hefty markup) at nearby stores, I decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on Amazon. I was very pleased with the price and the products.<br /><br />These jalapeno kettle chips are not overly spicy; they have a slow-building spice that starts very subtly a grows if you eat the whole bag, which I'm embarrassed to say I did quite a few times.<br /><br />The chips arrived well-packed and fresh. They had nearly a year of time before they expired, which is pretty impressive for chips.<br /><br />Most importantly, the price-per-bag was much, MUCH better than any local store could do, although I live near an expensive city, so that may play a role in the price difference.<br /><br />I wouldn't hesitate to order another box of these once I run out.

review/summary: Ridiculously Good
review/text: I cannot say how much I love Kettle brand potato chips. Kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors, and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water. The ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in. I love that these aren't filled with nasty chemicals. I ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but I was torn between the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IFUSC">Kettle Brand Potato Chips Fully Loaded Baked Potato, 2-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a> and the Jalapeno flavor. While I know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better. They include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which I'm fine with since I've a vegetarian. I ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and I can't guarantee how many I will have left. My fiance and I love these. The packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches, or handing out in gift bags, even just for portion control.

review/summary: Quite good
review/text: I enjoy these chips. I got these instead of my usual jalapeno ones from the same company for a bit of flavor change. I think those are better but only slightly, like the jalapenos there is a great amount of flavor without being too overpowering. The small bag size prevents you from overeating as with a larger bag.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I love these chips, I buy the 24 pack once a month. The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags. The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor.

review/summary: Salty and vinegary!!!
review/text: These are the strongest tasting salt and vinegar chips I've had.  I could still do with more vinegar flavor, but I think this is as close as I'm going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myself.<br /><br />I did a side by side with the Cape Cod salt and vinegar and these are about twice as flavorful.  Additionally, as other reviewers have said, they have quite a good bit of potassium in them (somewhere in the neighbor of 15% RDA per serving).

review/summary: Best gluten-free dairy-free chips
review/text: These are my favorite gluten-free dairy-free flavored chips.  Many other salt and vinegar chips contain dairy so it's nice to find ones that I can eat.  The vinegar flavor is really intense and good.

review/summary: A unique flavor for fans of Thai food
review/text: These Kettle Brand potato chips in the Spicy Thai flavor really do taste like food I have eaten at a Thai restaurant. The ingredients listed include garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, jalapeno, and "spices." I'm not sure what other spices there are, but it sure tastes like lemongrass to me...yum. These chips are thick cut and very crunch. They come in a seriously heavy-duty bag. I tried to open it like I do regular chip bags by pulling the two sides apart; no way! The bag is so thick I wondered if it was plastic. I started looking for the scissors and decided that any company that put their chips in a bag this nice must have provided a way to open it. Sure enough, there is a small slit on the top and the simple directions "tear here." So easy. Why didn't I think of that.

review/summary: Honey Dijon leaves bad aftertaste, NY Cheddar are pretty good
review/text: Honey Dijon flavor: okay flavor, but both my girlfriend and I thought they left a bad aftertaste. The aftertaste is sort of like old cheese (presumably some folks like this... I'm not a fancy cheese eater), and it lingers for at least an hour. I'd give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5.<br /><br />We have also tried the NY Cheddar flavor (4 stars), which we both liked better, and they didn't leave any long-lingering or bad aftertaste.<br /><br />I'd give the consistency of the chips 4 stars. The chips are crunchy, but also greasy enough that I keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating Kettle Chips.

review/summary: Yowzah!!
review/text: For me, Kettle is the best brand on the market. They really know how to turn the humble potato into something fit for the gods! I didn't think anything could top their salt and pepper chips, but these are my new favorite. The flavors are pure and real. They go great with just about everything and are highly addictive! I hope they come out with a low fat version; their low fat chips are excellent but they need more flavors.
