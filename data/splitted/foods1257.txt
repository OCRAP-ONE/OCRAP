review/summary: Makes you want to sing!
review/text: This tastes like I remember coffee tasting and has a wonderful aroma.  It comes in a box of 25 single serve pods that you just drop in your cup (the pods are marked with "this side down") and add hot water.  Let it steep for a few minutes then remove the pod and enjoy.  One Love is smooth and mild with a nutty coffee flavor.  I keep a box of it at work since each pod is individually sealed in a foil pouch.  That way, when I just can't stand another cup of "work" coffee, I brew up a cup of One Love and become the envy of all my friends.

review/summary: Good Brew
review/text: I am not sure if these are meant just to be used in those coffee makers that make one single cup at a time. I don't have one of those. But I still am enjoying this coffee. I heat water in a mug and then add one of these coffee pods and brew it like a tea bag. I also take a spoon and squeeze water through the pod while it brews in my cup to get a strong coffee out of it.<br /><br />Of all the different coffees I have had, like Dunkin Donuts, Green Mountain, Folgers, and so forth, the coffee this most reminds me of is Starbucks. It is not exactly the same, but I would think someone who likes Starbucks roasts would probably enjoy this.<br /><br />I like the nice box and especially that each coffee pod is individually wrapped to keep them fresh.

review/summary: rich and fresh
review/text: I usually like to grind my own beans but tried this because I had it once before and because it's organic. I tried it a few months ago and only had one cup and was pretty sure I liked it and wanted to confirm.<br /><br />I got this to use in my Cuisinart that is made for keurig k cups - I cut open the pods and poured the coffee into my set reusable kcup. Because the coffee is ground so fine, it didn't work too well in the keuring but I expected that. I just brewed two small cups with the one kcup-ful and it worked fine. The coffee is rich and full bodied, not bitter and only mildly acidic. And, it tastes pretty fresh for preground coffee.<br /><br />I love a deep, bold coffee but don't like acidic or bitter flavor, and this was a pretty good cupful, and it's organic to boot. I find it a challenge to find a bold coffee that I like that isn't bitter/acidic, so was pleasantly surprised with this. I would probably buy again if I could use pods directly or if I could get whole beans.

review/summary: Dark and Rich and Very Good
review/text: I drink two cups of coffee each morning and I make them with a pod brewer. I used to drink more. I'd make a pot of coffee in the morning and drink it all day. Sometimes I'd do two pots. It seemed that just the thought of that coffee waiting for me was all it took to get me out into the kitchen and pour another cup. The pod brewer was the answer. Now I make a cup when I get up and have my second cup with breakfast.<br /><br />I do have several different kinds of coffee, but after having tried this, I've been mostly sticking with it, because it's dark and rich and very good with kind of an earth taste that I really like.<br /><br />In fact this coffee is so good that sometimes, not all the time, but sometimes, I'll take a third cup upstairs with me to my home office. If you haven't tried this, I think you should. I think you'll like it.

review/summary: Great Coffee but please stop smoking and put some instructions on the box!
review/text: Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee makes a tasty cup of coffee.  However, I have to say that nowhere on the box, or the individual packets, are instructions for actually making the coffee.  Also it doesn't tell you what type of coffee maker to use or even how much water to use for each packet.  I use K-cups and my daughter uses T-cups.  I had to make this product in my old automatic drip coffee maker, and I had to guess on how much water to use.  Once I was able to make a cup, it was very good.

review/text: Since these packs are individually sealed, you can carry it with you wherever you are, and it stays fresh. And all you need is hot water. No filters, no apparatus required. It is great for traveling.<br /><br />And because it's in a bag, you can regulate the strength. Just pull the bag out when it's as strong as you like.<br /><br />The only thing I can think of to improve it would be a string, like they do with tea bags, so you could remove the bag from the cup without a spoon.

review/summary: Great Organic Coffee with a Rich, Bold Taste
review/text: Marley Coffee's Exotic Floral and Berry "One Love" organic medium Ethiopia Yirgacheffe is a great organic coffee with a rich, bold taste. I haven't tried anything remotely like it; it is definitely addictive. I tend to drink coffee that's heavily diluted with water and have found that the one serving coffee brewing bag can yield two full cups of coffee. However, please note that this is my particular take on drinking it; others may wish instead, a much stronger brew.

review/text: I am using a Senseo machine so this was a nice product to use it with.<br />The box is large and has a slot you can open at the bottom to get one bag at a time, like a dispenser.<br />The bags are individually wrapped in sealed envelops which can be a pain in a neck to tear open.<br />Taste wise, this coffee is the best testing I have ever tried with my Senseo machine.<br />On a side note, the coffee beans are not Jamaicans but Ethiopians. It is 100% Arabica.<br /><br />Every bag is thicker than the norm so it is large enough for a double coffee.

review/summary: Pricey, But Delicious
review/text: These are pods, designed to be used in a single-cup brewing system made for pods.  I don't have one of those expensive, pod-using, coffeemakers.  I do have a single mug coffeemaker, which I normally fill with water using the provided fourteen ounce mug.  For the purposes of this product, I tried just putting in a cup (8 oz) of water, and placing the pod in the basket.  This produced a weak, undrinkable liquid.  The second time, I filled the pot with 8 oz. again.  I cut open two of the pods and put the coffee in the usual No. 2 filter.  This produced a very strong, but very delicious cup of coffee.  I thought it was too strong even for me at first (I like strong, dark coffee, and drink it black) but the more I drank it, the more I liked it.  I finished every drop.  Filling the one-cup coffeemaker with the usual full mug of water and the contents of two opened pods makes a slightly weaker but still very full-bodied, rich coffee.

review/summary: Love It. Smooth, Not Bitter, Wonderful Taste!
review/text: I have been using a Tassimo brewer like this one made by Bosch for several years now. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001W3V88W">Bosch TAS1000UC Tassimo Single-Serve Coffee Brewer, Anthracite</a> . I purchased mine from Tassimo Direct online. Gevalia, Starbucks, HAG,  and several other brands were my main brews. I love the convenience of the Tassimo system and easy cleanup. However, after drinking this Marley Coffee, I am now rethinking how I brew coffee. The Tassimo takes up a fair amount of counter space. You have to use the Tassimo disc coffee packs and they are limited in choices. I wish this Marley coffee came in Tassimo discs. I love it.<br /><br />I am now thinking that I will simplify my coffee station by getting rid of the Tassimo and using a french press or this Aerobie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047BIWSK">Aerobie AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker</a>. Not only can I get everything off the counter and store it in my cabinets, but I can also use any kind of coffee I want. I have an instant hot water unit that is supplied filtered water from a sediment and carbon block filter. I also already have a spinning blade coffee grinder. So I think I am going to purchase the Aerobie brewer and open up one of the Marley pods and give it a try.

review/text: I drink a lot of coffee and tea everyday, my normal brand is Gevalia Limited Edition but I like trying different brands when the mood strikes me, as it did here.<br /><br />I don't have one of these machines that uses the pods but my normal use machine is the Keurig and I personally fill the K-Cups with which ever coffee I'm in the mood for, and it was simple to empty one of these pods into my re-usable K-Cups and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I'd read the different reviews and the opinions were all over the place and I think it had to do with the preparation that each person used. I decided on the Keurig because I just wanted a single cup this afternoon but in the future I will brew several cups using the French Press (LOVE! the Richness with the press)<br /><br />But enough about the style of the maker and back to the matter at hand, the coffee!<br /><br />It's a delightful, full and rich tasting coffee and I will be enjoying it and I'll be ordering more because it's great stuff.<br /><br />It's a joy to find a coffee this good because most leave a lot to be desired.

review/summary: tasty coffee, with additional novelty value
review/text: These coffee pods are probably intended for use in one of the  single serve  coffee machines. There were no instructions anywhere, they do have "This side down" on the pod but there was nothing on the box, outer pouch  or in the product description that indicated that the pods were not  the (identically appearing) coffee pods that are directly immersed in water.<br /><br /> You cannot  use them successfully just by putting them in a drip filter and pouring water through because the water flows through too swiftly. I was able to get  very nice coffee with these pods  by putting them in the cup of hot water and bobbing the pod up and down to keep the water flowing through the pod and the natural oils from settling on the grounds. It did not take long to brew.<br /> The coffee made this way was good tasting, reasonably strong but not overwhelming and somewhat sweet. The coffee was  does not have much caffeine. This would not be  the cup to have when you really need a stiff jolt  to wake you up. This is definitely a coffee I could drink at night without having any problems getting to sleep.<br /><br />Marley One Love Coffee pods are elegantly packaged in cream colored mylar pouches with red green and gold accents. There are images of Bob Marley and the Ethiopian Lion on the package and pouches. These would almost be  worth it for the conversational value of the package alone. Everyone who came into the kitchen and saw the box was enthralled. Everyone who tried the coffee enjoyed it.<br />I do not have a single serve  coffee maker so I cannot tell you  how well the pods work in a coffee maker.<br /><br />.

It had a fresh great taste that was not over powering or too strong like some coffee can be.  It can be consumed black or with sweetners...it was great both ways.  As I drank my cups and read the box...I was pleased to learn that farm workers are treated ethically and that partial proceeds from the sale of this coffee goes towards youth soccer programs (kicksforcause.org).  If you enjoy coffee, then you must try this 100% Arabica coffee bean/Artisan Roasted. Uhm Uhm Good!

review/text: Marley Coffee comes with no directions on the package, only the statement that it's single serving. It doesn't state what system of coffee brewing this was manufactured for.  The aroma is wonderful, however, I'd describe the coffee as mild not medium roast.  I was, therefore, disappointed in the flavor. Perhaps if it was brewed in a cone system or similar, I might have had a stronger result.

Maybe if you are looking for a simple midday break you could brew a cup, but do not look for any pick me up qualities, this brew is designed for a pairing with a fruit based snack.  So, if you are looking for a paring with you afternoon muffin, this pod might work for you.

review/summary: Not A Winner
review/text: A box of this coffee contains 15 packets. There are no preparation instructions so one would think that one packet means one cup. Since coffee makers consider a cup to be 6 ounces that was my starting point. One of the reviews mentioned that the coffee is weak so I doubled down on the amount. This meant two coffee packets in 6 ounces of water. While the coffee was brewing it emitted a very slight and barely detectable odor. When the brewing was finished it was time to drink coffee.<br /><br />This is by far the weakest coffee I have ever tasted. It would take all 15 packets to make  one 8 cup pot of weak coffee at a cost of over ten bucks. Not a good choice. There are far better coffees available at far more reasonable prices. They would be a much better choice than this Marley.

review/summary: Blech
review/text: This is probably good organic coffee in whole bean form.  It seems pretty fresh, even for ground coffee, and it's roasted the way I like it, which is medium-light.  The flavor (once you get some, more on that to follow) is mild.  It does have a weird aftertaste, which may be from the pods themselves or from the packaging.<br /><br />Mostly, though, this is a wasteful, expensive way to brew a cup of coffee, and it undoes all the good of using organic, fair trade beans.  It's a packaged coffee inside a package that's inside a package of packages.  This wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if the amount of coffee inside the pod were enough to brew a decent cup, but it isn't.  One pod brewed as recommended doesn't hold your cream and tastes like what you'd get at your great-grandma's house in outstate Minnesota.  You can read the date on a penny at the bottom of your cup.  Brewed according to the directions, this is worse than no coffee at all.<br /><br />Two pods in ten ounces of near-boiling water for 4-5 minutes makes an okay mug of coffee, but you use twice as much packaging and spend twice as much money.  Two stars for the fair trade.  No stars for anything else.

Its fair, but not great.  Like other reviewers have mentioned its pretty weak stuff.  The taste kinda reminds me of a smoother McDonalds coffee.

Marley's One Love Organic Coffee, though, was a nice change of pace for me.  It has a very mild flavor (I detected no bitterness myself) that may not have enough punch for some folks, but for an afternoon break it is perfect for me.<br /><br />I removed this coffee from the filter pods it comes in and filtered it myself in my own coffee drip pot.  I used two pods for sixteen ounces of coffee and it came out wonderful.

I know it sounds a bit strange, but the coffee actually relaxed and calmed me down.<br /><br />I recommend this coffee for folks who enjoy a quick break once in awhile.

One of the fun aspects of all this is trying out all sorts of coffee pods made by different companies.  Most of what I have tried so far are very good, so I have no complaints about any of them, but the Marley One Love coffee pod is perhaps my new favorite.  Wonderfully smooth coffee from Ethiopia, and from the moment you open the wrapper and smell the first whiff of heavenly coffee until you get to drink the freshly brewed cup you will not be disappointed.  This is going to become a regular order for me.  YUM!

I assume the packets are for a single cup brewer.  I cut open the packets and used several in a multi cup brewer.  I wish there was a number to call.  Beautiful packaging and an excellent flavor.  Wonder if there's an instant version as well as packaging as beans and ground.  In my limited experience, I think Ethiopian coffee ranks among the very best of natural coffee flavors.  I bet even Bob Marley would like this along with his morning ganga.<br /><br />"...let's get together and feel all right"  Indeed.

review/summary: A Very Tasty Cup of Joe
review/text: My husband and I travel for several weeks a year in an RV, and always take "instant" and "single cup" brews along with us. I have taken both Maxwell House and Folgers "brew in the cup" coffee bags, and found them acceptable (in lieu of a fresh cup of coffee from an actual coffee pot), so my expectations were that this coffee would be similar in taste and quality. I was wrong. I thought this was an exceptionally tasty cup of coffee - on par with coffee that has been brewed in a coffee maker. It is smooth and flavorful, with a very fresh taste. I highly recommend it for those who want a good cup of coffee without committing to a whole pot - or to lugging a K-cup type brewer along to work or on the road.

review/text: When i got this coffee,i discovered it was for a single cup machine.I dont have one so i just cut the packets open and used the coffee in my drip machine.It worked just fine.I only used two packets for a half a pot and it was still strong so i think a little more water and it would be fine.The coffee is very good.I felt it was very smooth and had a nice aroma.I didnt realize that the name Marley is the family of Bob Marley.Im a fan so it made it even better.Good stuff,mon,try it.

review/summary: Smooth, slightly sweet flavor
review/text: When I ordered One Love for some reason I thought they were single serve packets that you just add hot water to but they are not. My fault for not reading thoroughly. Since I don't have a pod coffee brewer this review is based on using these pods with my Keurig and French Press.<br /><br />My Keurig model is the B60 Special Edition that I purchased attachments for which enable me to use pods: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WU8PW8">Perfect Pod Holster Use Any Pod in Your Keurig Coffee Maker - Over 10,000 Sold</a>.<br /><br />The description of this coffee is floral with berry notes. I really couldn't detect the berry in the coffee by smell but the floral was definitely there and both were present in taste with a slight chocolate taste. I think this coffee is very similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XNW">Green Mountain Coffee, Dark Magic (Extra Bold), 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a>, just not as bold in flavor and more of a medium flavored coffee. I really didn't like the bitter smell of the coffee.<br /><br />Results:<br />Keurig My K-Cup with brew size of 9.25oz: weak, light colored coffee with hardly any flavor.<br /><br />Perfect Pod Holster with brew size of 9.25oz: dark in color with a smooth, slightly sweet medium roast flavor.<br /><br />French Press: near same results as the Perfect Pod Holster except the coffee was darker and had more flavor since I could let the grounds steep in the hot water for a few minutes.<br /><br />The Perfect Pod Holster and French Press were enjoyable successes with these pods, I was able to drink it with 2 packets of Splenda and no cream. I brewed a second cup in the Keurig, adding a teaspoon of chocolate coffee creamer, which brought out the chocolate flavor that's traditionally found in Ethiopian Yirgacheffe coffee, along with the Splenda made the coffee was very enjoyable. I've been drinking it this way ever since.<br /><br />Since this coffee is very finely ground it leaves coffee sediment in the bottom of the cup.

review/summary: Mild coffee, great aroma with no sour taste at all.
review/text: This gourmet coffee has a delicious aroma, but a very mild taste. Which is good for drinking while  having breakfast, but not to drink alone or with milk, if one likes strong coffee.  The little pods are convenient for taking along while traveling. They work well on those small coffeemakers provided in hotels. One thing I didn't noticed the first time I had one, and which makes a different when brewing the coffee pods, it's that each one says, This Side Down, and of course, placing it in that position inside the pod brewer helps improve the result. The lack of bitterness is a definitely a plus.

review/summary: A mild smooth coffee
review/text: There are several things a coffee lover looks for in their brew.. the aroma, the color and the taste are what I look for. When I opened the individual pack, I was hit with a wonderful coffee scent.  The pod looks typical, and are made for a pod machine.  When I made my first cup, since the aroma was strong, I filled the machine with a good sized mug's worth of water, and made a cup.  When it was done, the color was fairly light, so I only added a small amount of milk.  Still, the flavor was a bit too bland for me, and I like a mild coffee.  For the second cup, I used a smaller mug, and in return got a darker, more flavorful cup, so that is my recommendation with this brand.  Some other things I love about this brand:  it's organic, sustainably grown and Fair Trade certified. That's a lot of benefits for only about 75 cents a cup.  The even have their own foundation to support youth soccer programs.  This is a good deal.  The only thing that I would change is the individual wrap, which seems like an excess of packaging for a company dedicated to the environment.

review/summary: Aromatic Little Pods
review/text: These single-serve pods are everything good; Eco-friendly, "Ethically Farmed * Artesian Rosted," organic, and when you're done, it's ready for the compost bin. Other than the "This Side Down" printed on each pod, there are no directions on the package, but they are intended for use in most home and office brewers....and I guess perfectly acceptable to use like a tea bag, which I tried and got a very tasty cup of coffee from it.<br /><br />The aroma when you break open the individually wrapped little pod package is tantalizing, and the flavor very robust. The box is full of references to the great Bob Marley, and the company is owned by his son. There are other icons on the box too, from the coffee producers, ITAL, who are "...committed to sourcing the finest quality 100% Arabica beans" and "Kicks for Cause" which sends a portion of the proceeds to charity.<br /><br />All in all, this "Exotic Floral and Berry" blend makes a very nice cup of coffee, and is extremely handy if you are busy, so get your One Love pod in a brewer or cup and enjoy! I'm factoring the convenience of the product into my rating. If this was loose coffee, it would get 4 stars.

review/summary: Capitalizing on the Marley Legend-Organic Fair Trade Coffee
review/text: The great late Reggae singer Bob Marley's son has founded marleycoffee.com. The coffee is Fair Trade Certified and quite good. I drink my coffee black without sugar and really am keen on trying different roasts, etc. My only problem with this coffee is that it come in pods. I do own a Keurig and figured that I could put a pod in the fill-it-yourself chamber and brew my coffee. Alas, this doesn't work. I finally brewed it by steeping it in boiling water in the microwave and I must say it was pretty decent. At this point, I am not about to buy a pod brewer (available from a variety of companies including Marley). I think the pods are definitely more environmentally friendly than the plastic k-cups, but I have been buying my own coffee, grinding my beans and using the filters that I bought for my Keurig machine. This is definitely a less costly way to use a single cup brewer.

review/text: I really love the idea of this coffee from the family of Bob Marley. However, it's packaged in individual pods that work in a Keurig adapter cup, so if you don't have that kind of coffee maker/adapter, this product isn't for you.<br /><br />Not wanting to waste the coffee, I cut up a bunch and brewed in a regular machine. Overall, it's a fairly mild roast with good strong coffee flavor (if you use enough of it) that has some nice fruity tones.

review/summary: Weak coffee, unpleasant aftertaste
review/text: The Good: The Marley Coffee One Love coffee pods are simple to use and even simpler to clean up.  Just remove the pod from the basket and throw away.  At $10 a box, the price per cup is not bad, either.<br /><br />The Bad:  The coffee is weak tasting.  I tried several pods with differing amounts of water and the coffee still tasted weak.  My pods were "Exotic Floral and Berry" flavored and this flavoring gave the coffee a strong, unpleasant aftertaste.  It didn't seem too bad the first few sips, but the aftertaste became more and more unpleasant as I drank the coffee.  I could not finish a full cup.  My daughter and my sister also tried the coffee and they thought it had an unpleasant taste.  Part of the problem could be that I am not fond of flavored coffees.  I believe that Marley Coffee comes in an espresso flavor and that might be better.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this coffee.

review/summary: Coffee's delicious, but not the easiest to brew.
review/text: Fantastic coffee.  Here's my trouble -- and it's very likely that it is MY trouble alone: I don't know how to make a cup of good, strong coffee using these tea-bag sort of coffee packets and a regular coffee machine.  I find that if you put these packets into the bottom of the coffee filter basket and run water through it, the water runs through too fast and the coffee is too weak.  I have tried using these like actual teabags, which definitely makes a better cup of coffee, but requires a little more time and supervision than I want.  I presume that the right kind of machine, or the right style of coffeemaking, turns these packets into solid gold for ease of use; for me, though, not so much.  But yeah: seriously tasty coffee, once you get the right amount of coffee-ness in your hot water.

review/summary: Amost as good as that place in Seattle.............
review/text: I tested this coffee using a regular Mr. Coffee brewer and a standard coffee filter.  Although the product is designed for those one-cup brewers, I don't have one so I used what I had.  It comes in the sealed pods that are designed to drop right in the the brewer without and mess.  I had to open the pouch to brew it in the Mr. Coffee but still found it made a lot less mess just pouring it from an opening in the pouch.  The first time I just made one cup; the second time I brewed two cups using two pouches.<br /><br />I found the coffee quite good, especially the aroma.  (I really loved the aroma!)  It definitely has floral and berry notes that do not overwhelm the coffee flavor. I like that it is organic and Fair Trade Certified.  This product also claims that "We use beans only from coffee farms that adhere to strict sustainability ethics."  You really can't get a much purer source than this.<br /><br />I'm not a coffee gourmand so I shared this brew with a friend who is very particular about her coffee to see her reaction.  I will drink just about any coffee but she likes her coffee strong.  She found this coffee strong and thought that it came awfully close to the coffee she gets from that Seattle chain.  She found the floral and berry "aftertaste" pleasant and not bitter.  She said for her it's definitely 4-star. (Remember, this is a gal who knows her coffee.)

review/text: This product has a surprise taste and I truly wonder why nobody has thought of this before.  It's the best of both coffee and tea in one infusion. It's got the best of everything in terms of convenience, taste, and triple bottom line. Here's what I love about it:<br /><br />TASTE:  The rich earthy depth of Arabica coffee infused with exotic overtones of berries and flowers. It's simply divine.<br /><br />CONVENIENCE: Each pouch is individually wrapped to preserve the aromatics, and the drink is steeped like tea, so there is no need for a press or coffee maker.<br /><br />ECO Friendly:  The coffee is 100% organic and fair trade. What's not to love about that?<br /><br />CHARITABLE: A portion of the proceeds of this beverage go to charity to promote youth soccer programs<br /><br />All in all this is a delicious, convenient yummy beverage and a new favorite in our home!<br /><br />Our other favorite is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027CNY7U">Guayaki Traditional Mate Tea Bags, 75-count</a>

review/summary: As good as Dunkin' Donuts
review/text: My husband is the main coffee drinker in our house and he's always searching for a good brew.  I accepted Marley's Coffee to review, mainly because I'd hoped he would find a good coffee that he liked.  I didn't notice they were pods.  Oops.  I'd literally just given away our Senseos because we can't get pods, only online and it's just too much to buy a case for just hubby to use.<br /><br />So, he had to improvise a little.  He tried boiling water and using it like a teabag.  That worked well.  He even ripped some open and used them in a regular coffeemaker with a filter - that worked well too.<br /><br />It had a good flavor and wasn't too acidic (I'd recently gotten him some Gevalia that he said was way too acidic for his taste, so this was a welcome change).  It wasn't too weak, nor too strong.  He compared it to Dunkin Donuts' coffee, saying it was just as good as Dunkin (and that was saying a lot for him).<br /><br />I'm hoping to find Marley's coffee in a regular grind now for him.  Overall, he liked the taste far better than many I've purchased for him.

review/summary: Wow
review/text: The smell in the single serve package is a little off putting, but I suspect that that's because it is actually the smell of good, organic coffee. Even brewing, the smell is a bit sharp, but that first cup is...<br /><br />Wow...<br /><br />I was shocked drinking it, actually. The flavor was not too terribly robust, but not so weak as to be merely coffee-flavored water. Indeed, the flavor is one which is almost minty, but not overbearingly so. I love my dark, robust coffee (the dark the better) in the mornings when I would rather climb under the bed. This coffee, however, seems to be one that I can drink with just about anything thing, at any time.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, I'm going to have other cup now.<br /><br />If you are looking for a fair trade, organic coffee that doesn't taste like it, but will add flavor to your morning without tons of sugar and non-dairy dairy creamer. This is a coffee I could drink without that stuff.<br /><br />Good stuff!

review/summary: Bitter Brew, and that's good
review/text: Note: I snipped open the pod and tasted this coffee after preparing it properly, not in a pod.<br />"<br />This is the "organic medium ethiopia yirgacheffe" (really).<br /><br />I like a light roast; a fruity columbian.  It may be that I am reacting to the omnipresence of that bitter, over-roasted stuff Starbucks pours. Well, this Marley blend is bitter as well, but intrinsically so, with a tongue-slapping sting. I don't feel that it is a product of over-roasting, but rather, the nature of the bean. I like it. It makes me want to sip it while alternating chocolate mousse and cabernet. Seriously. Try that combination for dessert sometime. It is the great triumvirate.<br /><br /> I am particular about my coffee and yet compromise my taste by going the K-cup route. doing the 200 degree water drip through the unbleached paper with freshly ground beans thing is not for me on an very early weekday morning. I can barely put my pants on, let alone manipulate a container full of near-boiling water. That level of love is left for the weekend, when I have the time to take the time to linger lovingly over proper preparation as if it were the Tea Ceremony.<br /><br />That being said, there is no need to compound the sin of employing a pod or K-cup while using that stuff that sits on the grocer's shelf for months. Use good coffee. Marley's is packed in foil and tasted fairly fresh.

I am definitely not fond of bitter coffee or of coffee that tastes burned, so this coffee was a delightful surprise. The aroma is quite pleasing, with notes that are almost fruity on top of the basic coffee scent, and the flavor works well on its own or sweetened and lightened to taste. I was raised on Community Coffee, and this is the first brew that might tempt me to switch.

review/summary: Not a strong coffee, but does taste great!
review/text: Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee, 15-Count<br /><br />The Marley Coffee comes in single-serving pods, however I did not have a single-serving coffee maker to test these pods. Instead, I tore open the pods and used my Frieling Stainless Steel French press. I let it steep for about 30-40 minutes as I do my morning routine and let the water cool to a drinkable temperature.<br /><br />The coffee is best described as a medium roast. The taste is very mild and actually complements my breakfast very nicely. There is no bitter aftertaste, and it does not smell or taste burnt. I'm not a coffee drinking expert, but I can definitely tell you this coffee tastes great. I usually prefer my local Kona blend or Italian and French roasts for their stronger flavor, but the Marley Coffee is mild but tastes good. I wouldn't say it is coffee flavored water, but it isn't very strong.<br /><br />Overall: 4/5 stars, I'm not a fan of single-serve pods due to the higher cost. It is a mild tasting coffee, so those that prefer full bodied dark roasts won't like it.

review/summary: Nice Morning Cup
review/text: I found the Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee to be full bodied and rich. Pleas take the other reviews for what they are worth. Some of these people tried to steep these "pods" in hot water or use them in machines, and under circumstances, for which they were not intended.<br /><br />Pod brewers (like the Senseo, which I used)force hot water through the pod at pressure, similar to an espresso machine, just at much lower pressure. One pod is intended for a single 4-ounce cup of coffee. It takes two pods and a two-pod holder to make an 8-ounce cup.<br /><br />While taste is of course a very subjective thing, I found this brew to have a very rich and complex flavor. The pods worked perfectly in my pod brewer and made a very nice cup of coffee.

review/text: This coffee has a nice flavor and aroma and will be well appreciated by folks who prefer their brew to be on the milder end of the spectrum.  I appreciate the company's social responsibility in terms of fair trade and child labor practices although in terms of waste, any single serving coffee product creates more than its fair share.  Perfect for travel or for those times when all you need is one cup.

review/summary: Delicious coffee that is organic and fair-trade
review/text: This coffee is very smooth and has a great flavor, medium roast, without being bitter.<br /><br />The pods do not fit in a Keurig machine so you will need to cut each one and empty it into a Keurig insert for regular coffee grounds such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051SU0OW">ekobrew Cup, refillable filter for Keurig Brewers, Brown, 1-Count</a>.  This seems to work fine for me, just be sure you don't over fill as the pod may contain a bit more grounds than needed for a Keurig.

review/summary: One Love Better Than It Smells
review/text: One of the best things about a fine coffee is the aroma. It is part of the entire coffee drinking experience. It is the aroma that strikes you first with Marley Coffee - One Love. The coffee has a pungent, almost "muddy" odor. By "muddy," I mean it actually smells like mud. This was the hardest thing to get past when trying this coffee. Next up is its light color. It almost brews with the color of a strong tea rather than a coffee. I like my coffee dark, so this was yet another hurdle I had to get past. Once I got to the taste, I was more than pleasantly surprised. The flavor was light, yet wonderfully smooth. There was not a lot of body to it, but it did taste great. This is a light roast at best. If that sounds like what you're looking for, go for it. I give it four stars on taste alone. A nice organic blend.

review/summary: Tastes great when brewed like tea!!
review/text: Drip machine: Produces brown water. Not coffee.<br /><br />Stove-top espresso machine: Weak, but was smooth and palatable. It tasted more like black tea than coffee.<br /><br />Immersion brew: Smooth, thick, strong, and huge buzz! (Pour 1 quart of hot water over 3 pods. Let it steep for 15 minutes. For more caffeine, leave the pods in the water for 5-12 hours.)<br /><br />=========================<br />BOTTOM LINE: The pods need to stay in the water longer than conventional methods, much the same way tea-bags need time to steep.

review/summary: Would be a nice gift
review/text: The packaging, the box as well as the individual pods, is attractive to the point where it would make a great gift for any coffee drinker and especially a coffee drinking Bob Marley fan.  I liked the coffee, it smelled and tasted very good and the individually sealed pods assure long term freshness.  The pods appear to be made of high quality unbleached paper and it is strong enough to not tear or break open when saturated with hot water.  I do not own a single serve drip coffee maker so my first try was to open four pods and pour the coffee into my four cup basket and filter.  This worked well.  Then I thought I'd try something different the next time and placed four pods into my coffee maker basket.  This resulted in an entirely too weak brew.  But my experiment led me to discover the best method for using the handy little pods when no one cup maker is available.  When I saw that I had a pot of hot weak coffee I took the pods out of the basket and dropped them into the hot coffee.  I let them sit and steep for a while then plucked each pod out, squeezed, and discarded.  Now I had a good brew, as good as my first.  From then on when I use these pods I place one pod with about 8 oz of distilled water in a ten ounce mug and heat it good and hot in the microwave.  Remove from microwave and cover to retain heat while it brews.  Then squeeze out and discard the pod (they are so easy to deal with compared to loose wet grounds) and you have yourself a great cup of coffee.  All said I am enjoying this coffee as something new to me but I still prefer mu old standby, 100% Colombian.

review/summary: Nice and strong - the way I like it.
review/text: I consider myself somewhat of a coffee expert.  I have tried all types and prices of coffee brewed in every type of container (from french presses to drip makers to keurig and pod devices to cappuccino machines).  Most coffee can be made successfully if it is allowed to steep the properly ground coffee beans for the right amount of time at the right temperature.  Assuming you have the temperature and time calibrated right the end product will show its true nature to you.  In the instance if Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee, its true nature is quite good.  It has an earthy, exotic, African flavor that is bold and strong - just the way I like my coffee.  It makes for a perfect after dinner coffee - to be enjoyed with friends and good conversation.  I took off one star for the price, as I feel it is a bit overpriced as sold.  Otherwise enjoy this great coffee!

These pods are meant to be used for a single serving in a coffee maker; however, I put some in my purse and take them with me.<br /><br />Each single serve coffee packet comes like a tea bag in a woven mesh, round pouch. Then this is sealed in an air tight foil bag. I use this with a hot pot in my office to heat water and pour it over the coffee bag just like I pour over my tea bag. It is excellent! Very convenient and easy to carry.<br /><br />This makes a great cup of coffee. The flavor is very light, and I like a light to medium roast coffee. Also, this product is certified organic AND fair trade!<br /><br />Excellent coffee and excellent production qualities.

review/summary: 'One Love' Marley Coffee
review/text: I love the smooth flavor of these single serve pods, but also believe in their mantras of organic, 'fair trade' coffee. I'm much more likely to purchase organic coffee in the first place. Combine that factor with the high quality Arabica beans and the convenience of these pods and you have a spectacular product. Also, partial proceeds of the coffee sales go toward youth soccer programs in the 'Kicks for cause foundation' that helps keep children on the playground and not in sweatshops, etc. Although these pods are not quite right for my home coffee pot (we have too many individuals who need a cup of coffee in the morning), they are fantastic for our various trips. I use these pods in place of the hotel coffee pods they provide in the room (hotel coffee is often not very good where we usually stay). The Marley Coffee pods are often far more tear resistant than the cheap hotel coffee pods. I've also used some of the packets as a unique addition to birthday gifts for friends and family (what great stocking stuffers they'll make for my coffee drinking family members). I also love to grab a  Marley Coffee pod for just a single cup of coffee in the evening if I'm going to be up late at night writing (which happens often). Another strategic place for these pods are the hiking backpacks. My husband, Tony McVay, and I can easily throw these in a small boiling pan of water if we are camping on the Mountains to Sea Trail or the Appalachian Trail on the weekends. The grains stay in the pod and haven't broke open in the pot thus far. I can't wait to share a few packets with a 'thru-hiker' on the Appalachian Trail. Imagine a weary hiker's delight when they treat themselves to a great cup of organic coffee just before hitting another long day on the trail! On that note, they are in a water-proof, light weight packet that fits easily in a backpack, purse and my husband's tool box. If he has a cup and a microwave available it is possible to brew a cup of coffee, although they're not exactly like tea bags. I can't wait to visit Marleycoffee.com to see what other flavors they have to offer. I truly believe this company is well on their way to winning over hearts and 'flavor fanatics' among devout coffee lovers.<br />Chrissy K. McVay

review/summary: Tastes pretty good!
review/text: Before I go any further in this review, I have to admit that I initially didn't know that this came in pods when I requested it. For whatever reason, I missed the pod image in the picture, so when I received this I ended up using several pods to create a full pot of coffee. This did impact anyone who is wondering what it might be like to brew one individual pod, which I will try to brew with my father's french press. Anywho, on with the review. I just wanted to be up front when I say that my experience might not be like that of someone who owns a Senseo.<br /><br />Smell-wise, this stuff is awesome. It smelled great when I was brewing it, which is honestly about 30-40% of what I (and many others) enjoy most about coffee. Taste-wise, this was pretty good. It's definitely a dark roast, so if you prefer a more mild flavor then you'll probably want to look elsewhere. (Not sure if Marley coffee has a lighter roast, but they probably should.) It's not Charbucks, so no worries about it being too roasted.<br /><br />I brewed this at work and after the pre-requisite jokes about a "pot" of coffee and such, we all set about to consuming it. Now while we do have to put up with some of the worst free coffee possible, it only serves to help us appreciate the good stuff when it comes along, and this is some good stuff and was pretty well received. I had a lot of people that came back and told me that they really enjoyed the brew. (For food items, if I can get a wider opinion, I try to do so because hey- not all opinions are the same when it comes to any product.) So if you have a Senseo that multiple people use or if you're considering buying a regular bag for multiple people to use, this is something you can get for a wide audience of drinkers.<br /><br />I have to say, this is something that I'd actually purchase with my own money later on down the line. It's a good coffee and while I don't base my purchases on the whole "organic, fair trade" stuff, I know that others do and I have to admit that it is nice to think that the coffee purchase potentially helped someone other than myself. (The whole organic, fair trade thing didn't really factor into my opinion, but I know that this is important to some consumers so I wanted to make sure to make a note of this since the product description for this didn't have any of this in it.)

review/text: I got this for my son-in-law and daughter who love in Washington State and drink a lot of coffee, usually strong coffee.  It was my mistake that I ordered the individually wrapped "pod" that is mean to be used with a specific type of coffee maker.  There were no directions on the box as to how to use them at all, they said.  They were able to adapt it by cutting open the package.  They said it has really good flavor and is in the middle of the intensity scale.  They thought the packaging was attractive, but not eco-friendly since they were individually wrapped.  That's why they are a 4 instead of 5 stars.

review/text: The idea of these "coffee bags" is neat. Put the ground coffee into little tea bag like pouches in order to make it easy to brew a cup. However, there seems to be a reason almost nobody else does this: The resulting coffee is weak and lacking flavor. I then tried cutting open the little pouches and making my coffee the traditional way using a single serving cone filter. The result was, to my taste, much better.<br /><br />Neat idea, great brand name and probably terrific people behind this effort, but for me the result fell short. Granted, I like a really strong cup of coffee. Others may have a completely different response.

However, that aside, it is very easy to overcome the simple obstical and brew.  We put the packages (out of the freshness wrapper of course)in the basket where we normally put the grounds.<br /><br />We had to guess how many for a full pot, but we decided that one per cup would do the trick.  It did and we were very happy with the results. This is a full flavored coffee and since we do not add cream or sugar, got the full benefit.  This is a good product and if you have one of those single cup brewers, then this will be even better.<br /><br />The only downside is that if they had some good instructions on how to brew a single cup included they would most likely have higher sales. The roast is really full flavored and delicious.

Then, as I tasted the coffee I immediately told my wife it didn't taste the same a the previous day.  It was then that she admitted to me that the Marley coffee was too good to waste on my unappreciative taste buds.  She was keeping it for herself.  This coffee is very good.  I'll be buying some more of this just for me and I obviously recommend it.

Marley Coffee has an excellent blend of excellent coffee beans with just a slight hint of floral (not very much) and with the Percolator, the pods fit perfectly in the old 1940s era Perc as I call my heirloom which has been handed me down which I prefer over my Mr. Coffee� and while my Pod Coffee maker broke a long time ago; I never was too happy with it because it is a single serving and I drink a 64 ounce coffee!<br /><br />:-D<br /><br />Yes, 100% Coffe-Holic here and I am not afraid to admit it.<br /><br />This is great for ANYTIME - morning, afternoon, or that after dinner - if you want something different for a change; I strongly would push you over the fence to this one.<br /><br />Having had coffee since the age of 3 years old from Cuban to the most exotic (expensive) - on the scale of 1 to 10; I give this one in this range of:<br /><br />Exotic - 7<br />Blending - 9<br />Fruity - 0<br />Floral - 4<br />Balanced - 10<br />Weakness - 0<br />Strong - 0<br />Evenness - 10<br />Taste - 10<br />Aftertaste - 0  (this is very good when there is a 0 which means there is no aftertaste)<br />Bitterness - 0<br />Sweetness - 3<br />Sourness - 0<br />Richness - 8<br />Boldness - 4<br />Lightness - 0<br />Darkness - 10<br />Deep Roast - 10<br />Medium Roast - 0<br />Light Roast - 0<br />Pre-Odor Smell - 2<br />Unsealed - 0  (meaning full container which like Maxwell House�, Folgers�, 8 O'Clock�, etc)<br />Fold'n'Seal - 0  (meaning you open and then seal, like Starbucks�, Caribou�, etc)<br />Individual Seal - 10 (meaning each is individually sealed; Marley Coffee�, Green Mountain�, etc)<br />Multi-purpose usage - 5 (can be used in Percolators and Pod Coffee Makers only; I have not attempted to break open pods to try in Coffee Maker yet)<br />Need Use for Salt - 0  (Some Coffees, a pinch of salt is needed to remove bitterness or sourness)<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE PLUS BONUS AND ADDITIONAL BONUS (no need for salt usage) = 9!<br /><br />Truly a gourmet coffee for that special occasion / guest(s) / event(s) - you can even purchase multiple packages or bulk orders for the large Percolator (those that serves from 30 to 50 people) and place pods in there and use gallon of spring or filtered water to fill the pot for Weddings to Gala events!<br /><br />What makes this so wonderful is you can easily dump them all into the trash; for Percolator(s) - you can disregard the "this side down" as Percolator(s) operate differently than Pod Maker Coffee.<br /><br />NOTE: Pod Coffee Makers - Please pay heed to instructions and abide accordingly for its effectiveness!<br /><br />See my photos for images for additional pictures for reviews of this ...

review/summary: Smooth
review/text: I am very impressed with this coffee.  The taste is smooth and mellow, but rich as well.  It's a medium roast.  I'm a coffee freak and have tried too many brands and varieties to count, but only a handful merit buying again.  This is definitely one I'll buy again and again.  I hope to find it in a regular drip-grind version so I can make it by the pot instead of just by the cup.

review/summary: Serviceable, very convenient coffee
review/text: I'm used to grinding my own beans, but occasionally I run out, and I like to have some 'backup' coffee at hand.  Sealed in convenient single-dose foil pouches, this coffee fits that bill admirably.<br /><br />Marley is a name I associate with Jamaica, home of some of the world's best coffee.  This coffee isn't Jamaican, though; it's an Ethiopian medium roast, ground and put into a little multi-purpose sealed filter.  It's not a 'pod' as that trademarked term is used, but it's about the right size to lay flat on the floor of your small four-cup drip coffee maker.  Or, it can be torn open and the  ground coffee used any way you wish.<br /><br />I generally tend to like a fairly weak brew compared to my coffee-hound friends; this is enough grounds for me to make 12 oz of coffee, not more.  The flavor is not particularly dynamic; there's no French-roast "burnt" flavor but little of the floral or buttery aromatics that I like in my light roasts- as stated, it's a 'medium' roast.  In fact, 'inoffensive' is probably the right way to describe it, few coffee drinkers would throw this one out of bed.<br /><br />Summary:  sealed packet for long shelf life; single-dose amount; boring flavor; not going to compete with fresh-ground.  For what it is, it's good.

review/summary: GREAT SMELL. BROWN WATER.
review/text: Sooooo disappointing. The coffee smells great but what emerges from the coffeemaker is what my mother used to refer to as "dishwater." In fact, that's actually kind. I added cream, as usual, and the liquid turned almost white. This is a product packaged with no instructions whatsoever, except for "this side down" on the serving itself. Single-serving coffee pads have been around for a long time. I encountered them first in England in the early 1960s. They made a lousy cup of Joe and so does the Marley coffee--so everything old is new again. This company would do better to spend less on the fancy packaging and just put the coffee into a generic-type bag (with some instructions, perhaps) and allow buyers to build their own brew. For now, save your money. This stuff makes Dunkin's regular taste like a gourmet blend.

review/summary: This is not the way to make a cup of coffee
review/text: There is an inherent problem with this tea bag style coffee. The bag traps air inside, and so it wants to float on top of the water, which means it doesn't really brew. You can stab at it with a fork, or weigh it down with a spoon, but this still just results in it sitting in the water. There's not water flowing threw it. So the result in my tests was some very weak coffee, and more time spent preparing it than the elaborate packaging warrants. This is no easier than just tossing some grounds in a regular coffee maker with a filter, or using a French Press, and either of those methods will result in a good cup of Joe.<br /><br />The flavor of the coffee was good, hence the 3 stars, but the coffee was weak and trying to brew it was a bother. I would not purchase this product.

review/summary: I like it
review/text: There are some witty little things about Bob Marley's dad on the package, that make you kinda feel like you are "livin' the dream" alongside the Marley's just by sippin' on a cuppa joe.  This actually struck an emotional chord with me.  I like the idea of helping others achieve/live/enjoy their dreams.<br /><br />But the flavor of this brew didn't really match up to my locally freshly roasted coffee beans.  In fact, I even preferred some whole bean stuff that Kroger made.<br /><br />I understand that there is a world of difference between the Marley Pods and actual beans that you grind.  I took this into account when I gave the product 4 stars.  I like the Marley Organic, and I'm keen on Organics anyway..  But I don't think I'll be buying it again.  At the current price of .67 per unit I can throw out a half pot of freshly roasted coffee and still save money... I'm not sure that the convenience of using a pod is worth the premium.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I am jumping on the bandwagon with all of those reviewers who said this coffee is weak. I am disappointed that the Marley name is on this. I used two of these pods to make two cups of coffee. Yuck! Not only did it taste terrible, but it was incredibly weak. From my standpoint, you would need to use a minimum of two of these per cup of coffee. And that would probably have to be demitasse size to have it taste worthwhile. There also was none of that wonderful coffee aroma that you get with a good coffee.<br /><br />To make matters worse, there are no instructions on the box to tell you how much to use. I wasn't sure if it was my drip coffeemaker or not, but my guess is that the water would have to soak like a teabag. This is a case where you have to sacrifice convenience and go with regular coffee grounds. Not recommended.

review/summary: Good, tasty coffee. The grind works in an EkoBrew cup for Keurig as well.
review/text: I use a Keurig brewer, so when I brew this coffee I just snip open a pouch and dump it into my Ekobrew (reusable, refillable coffee cup for Keurig brewers).<br /><br />This is good, strong coffee. The sticker says "exotic floral and berry". I didn't detect this, really -- It has a bold flavor and you can definitely taste the medium roast. I'm not a coffee connoisseur (just drink it because it tastes good, and wakes me up), but I think this stuff has good flavor.<br /><br />I like this stuff because it's organic, Fair Trade, and the Marley coffee company also kicks back some of the proceeds from coffee sales to a cool sports-themed children's charity.<br /><br />It's a bit expensive for my taste, but it's flavorful and ethically produces by a hip company. So  give it a shot!

review/text: I found that the pod made a very weak and not very flavorful cup of coffee. I didn't think it had much of an aroma either. Sadly, I would only consider this adequate coffee in a total coffee emergency. I prefer medium to dark roasts, and this just didn't have a good flavor. If you like very mild coffee, you might like this.

review/summary: 4 experiments, 4 different tastes
review/text: I drink 2 cups of coffee from a Mr. Coffee each morning. I prefer the medium roast and like to smooth it by using creamer or milk to cut the bitterness. If I want something hot later on a winter day, I make some tea. I read others comments before trying this brand so I would know how to compare my taste with others.<br /><br />First experiment: I made one cup of coffee using one pouch. I liked the smooth taste and did not have to add creamer. It was weak. But the more I thought about it the more I recognized that this was just like drinking tea. So I think a tea lover would enjoy this as a different flavor.<br /><br />Second experiment: I made a second cup of coffee by piling a new pouch on the one I had used previously. Now the coffee was definitely stronger. It was still very smooth. I would rate this as a medium strength but on the light side.<br /><br />Third experiment: I made two cups of coffee using one pouch plus a scoop of my regular coffee. This tasted just like my normal coffee but retained the smoothness so I did not need creamer. So this may be the answer for those who wanted more flavor.<br /><br />Fourth experiment: I brewed two cups of coffee using one pouch. Then I moved the pouch to the carafe and squeezed it about 6 times. The coffee darkened noticeably and got a stronger flavor. This turned out to be the most satisfying for my taste.

review/summary: Nice Cup Of Coffee In A Convenient Pack!
review/text: I don't drink coffee every day, more like once or twice a week, and when I do I prefer a mild cup of coffee. I like good flavor but not too bold, and not bitter. Basically, I would opt for a Dunkin before a Starbucks, just to give you an idea of what I normally drink as I review Marley One Love Coffee.<br /><br />The box contains 15 single serving pods, individually sealed in foil. Each pod contains about 1/3 of an ounce of coffee. They are very convenient for storage or taking on the road. The cardboard box has a cutout near the bottom to easily dispense the pods (or you can just open the box from the top). The coffee is advertised as "100% Ethiopian Yirgacheffe."<br /><br />I typically make my coffee in a Keurig or a standard coffee maker/filter. I tried One Love four ways, ONLY ONE OF WHICH IS THE RECOMMENDED USE, as the coffee is advertised as "for use only in single serve home coffee pod brewers". Why did I order this coffee without said pod brewer? When I travel I find more and more hotels have pod brewers, so I am interested in a good coffee to use on the road. Anyway, I made the coffee:<br /><br />1) In a single serve brewer, a Black and Decker Brew N Go,<br />2) By filling a Keurig reusable K-Cup/filter.<br />2) In my standard coffee maker, a Braun, using the pods in the same amount/weight as I would any loose coffee.<br />3) Steeping a pod in a coffee mug, approximately 7 1/2 ounces in size.<br /><br />Unlike many coffees, where I think "Wow that smells really good", only to be disappointed by the flavor, Marley One Love hit me just the opposite. When I smelled the unused pod, as well as the brewing coffee, I thought "Hmmm, that doesn't smell too great." But wow, the result is a really nice cup of coffee. One Love is not at all bitter, and I wouldn't even call it bold. It is mild to medium in taste, while not being weak at all. I found I got the best results using it in the Keuring or regular coffee makers. Steeping it was OK, but it was somewhat weaker that way.<br /><br />I would get this coffee again, either loose in the bag or in pods.

review/summary: Nice tasting mild coffee
review/text: Usually, I'm a fan of a very deep, dark roasted coffee, with a full-bodied, smooth flavor. This coffee is a very deep flavored mild bodied coffee. I'm usually not a fan of mild coffees but, this is one that I like to drink at night if I want a cup.<br /><br />These are individual pods, for making one cup of coffee. I like the handyness of just grabbing one to take to work to use in my single cup drip coffee maker.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend this coffee for anyone that likes a deep flavored coffee. Though, if you like a deep roasted coffee, such as a French roast you might think this one is a bit too weak for your morning java.

review/text: If you appreciate coffee with a social conscience and you want a delicious light blend, this is for you. The little pods are fine for making a 4 oz coffee but anything larger will be too pale for most people's taste. So, while the coffee is very good, you will likely need to use two of the bags to get your morning buzz. The packaging is an entertaining read that gives you snippets about the Marley family and the origin of the coffee. Plan on waking up to a lovely day while your supply lasts.

review/summary: Pretty weak flavor
review/text: I don't know what makes Organic coffee different from regular coffee, and in this instance, I honestly don't care.  I'm used to Starbucks coffee, as well as the occasional Pete's coffee, as well had coffee in France, Belgium, Italy, and the Netherlands.  On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being strongest coffee, this Marley brand coffee is like a 2.  Weaker than the old-style McDonald's coffee (before McCafe's came about).  Weaker than instant coffee.<br /><br />I'm sure there are other flavors and nuances to this coffee, but I honestly can't get past the weak flavor.  Perhaps, if you like weak coffee, this may be for you, and maybe the organic process leaches stuff out, but for me, this one's not to my taste.<br /><br />At least the flavor's not bitter.

review/summary: Decent but Not Particularly Strong Coffee
review/text: The first thing you will notice with Marley Coffee is it smells really good.  Unfortunately once you brew it is not as strong as I would like it, but still a serviceable coffee.  These are single pod coffee packages, individually wrapped to keep them fresh until you use them with fifteen per box.  And even though it does not mean anything for the overall taste, the packaging is attractive with a slit you can make at the bottom of the box to remove the pods (or just open the top normally is you like).  Just do not ask me what it has to do with Bob Marley.

review/summary: Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee
review/text: I found this to be a very smooth and somewhat rich coffee.  Very enjoyable with good flavor, but not with a lot of depth or darkness.  Ethiopia has produced some of the best coffee in the world, and while this may not be the best I have ever tasted, it is a very good medium roast, full flavored coffee without a lot of bitterness.  This is the best cup of pod coffee I have tasted so far.<br /><br />In addition to the pod brewer, I also tried this coffee pod in a pour-through basket with boiling water and also steeping it like a cup of tea and found that the flavor was pretty consistent, if not better when brewed outside of the pod brewer (I was able to steep the coffee much stronger and to higher yield in a cup with boiling water -but slower than the pod brewer).  The pods are marked with which side up/down and should be tucked down tight in the pod brewer for the best results.  Each pod is individually wrapped airtight, and tasted as fresh as any other pre-ground or pod coffee I have tried.  Sustainably grown.

review/summary: Decent coffee
review/text: As the description says: this is for single-serve "pod" type brewers, and it will be quite the pain to use if you're using a Keurig or a Mr. Coffee. Keep that in mind...<br /><br />Now, to the coffee: it was good in a 6-8oz brew, with the flavors being pretty much as described. However, at 15 pods to a pack, this a week's worth of coffee if you drink a 15 oz mug every morning, as I do. So, while it is a good coffee when made properly, the value just is not there for me with this product.<br /><br />If you're okay with that, because you see value added by the social marketing related to this product, then go for it.<br /><br />If you're just after good coffee, you can probably get just as good a cup with a different brand for a little less.

Some reviewers have complained that coffee was weak, but by limiting the amount of hot water you can control the strength of the coffee. I found about eight ounce of boiling water per bag would be sufficient.  In this age of flavored coffee make sure that you are willing to try other brands.

review/summary: Yeah, I can't use these...
review/text: Receiving coffee pods was a first for me.  I wasn't quite sure what to do with these.  I don't have a pod coffee machine and so I initially thought that I could use these pods much like you would a tea bag.  I steeped it in my boiling water and then smelled the rich aroma and gulped down murky flavored fiery hot water.  It was bland and unappealing.  I've read that you can empty the contents into a conventional coffee machine and use it that way, but it would take a lot of pods to equal out a pot of coffee, and I don't have a conventional coffee maker so that wouldn't help me much.  I actually snatched this up because I thought I could make this like tea, and I wouldn't need a coffee maker.  It smells amazing, but like some other reviewers here, the pod process is a bit of a stumbling block.  I know that they make coffee makers specifically for these pods, but I can't see myself rushing out to buy one.  Just be aware before you buy that this may not be what you are bargaining for.  I do use these pods though, in my cooking.  They serve as a wonderful way to flavor stock and I'll simmer them when preparing different meat dishes.  Coffee is a great flavoring tool, and so I actually like these pods for that.  I recently cut one of these pods open and crusted pork with the contents.  It was wonderful.

Plus it says right on the box "organic, ethically farmed," which I'm inclined to believe; somebody's gotta check on that stuff, right? Holy recommended.

review/summary: Robust coffee heaven in a cup (made with a Keurig)
review/text: This review is based on brewing with a Keurig using a reusable plastic kcup. I use a Keurig for my morning coffee on work days because it's fast and can make a decent strong cup with the right brand k-cup, like Emeril's Bold. Since I've been wanting to try Marley's coffee anyway, I thought I'd get these pods, open one, and pour the contents into the reusable plastic kcup that I bought on Amazon. And it worked!<br /><br />This coffee, when brewed as above in a Keurig on the medium cup size, produces a deep, rich, robust cup of coffee heaven. There's no bitterness,  just smooth, rich, deep flavor with a slight acidic tingle. It's not the blend for someone who likes light to medium blends. This is for the stout-hearted coffee drinkers only. I plan on buying a bag of beans and brewing them in my regular Cloer coffeemaker.

review/text: This is a great coffee. Has a very unique taste so you have to love coffee with a little flare. It is fresh and great for an afternoon break. Adda scone with lots of whipped cream for a moment of heaven. These are pods so you cannot use it in your Keurig but in a regular coffee pot use it instead of a filter.

review/summary: excellent coffee
review/text: I will say that I was a bit skeptical when I first got the coffee pods, having tried several, various other pods in the past that were less than what anyone would expect for the price. However, to my pleasant surprise, the Marley Coffee was VERY GOOD. It has a very organic taste to it, with slight floral overtones and a smooth finish, no bitter aftertaste. I use the pods in my SENSEO coffee machine and the pods work quite well with it, producing a glorious crema every time. I would recommend this coffee, especially to owners of the SENSEO. Marley Coffee is good stuff!

review/summary: Smells nice, but weak coffee flavor
review/text: I got this because I was looking for a great coffee to make at work without a coffee machine or spending $2 on a cup.  Unfortunately I will have to keep searching.<br /><br />This smells really nice, but is very weak coffee.

review/summary: Good Stuff!  .....but you will need a packet brewer for it...
review/text: Vine is such a great innovation to get one to try or discover things they otherwise would most likely never become acquainted with.<br /><br />This is very good coffee, but the fact that it is one of the packet varieties leaves the necessity to have one of the brewers designed for such in order to obtain the correct results. I found a really inexpensive Mr. Coffee here for under $20 that I can "always" use to keep on hand in my seldom used cupboard above my fridge so it is available but out of the way. In lieu of this solution, I would suggest perhaps a french press setup that one could really squeeze the packet in order to get the full benefit of the ingredient....which, by the way, is an excellent Ethiopian yirgacheffe, totally organic (yeah), and of medium strength....just right (for me at least) on those yellow-sunshiny-mornings that seem to be quite frequent here in my area of the country of late. Back deck, wonderful spring sunshine, a croissant and a cup of this yummy brew is perfect for starting a beautiful April Day!<br /><br />Many have complained here about the strength, etc., but they are not processing the packets properly, thus I would recommend discounting most of those reviews. This really is great coffee....you are hearing this from a lifelong coffee-hound who appreciates almost all blends and harvests of beans from the world over. Trust me, Ethiopian is one of the Very Best Beans, along with Kenyan and Sumatran....all three of them are unbeatable for a "true" coffee-lover!<br /><br />Enjoy this exceptional coffee.......(while you're at it, give a few thoughts to it's Namesake...Bob Marley...it will further brighten your day.<br /><br />~operabruin

review/summary: Nice coffee
review/text: Yirgacheffe used to be one of my favorite coffees, but it's a lighter brew and I like my coffee stronger and darker these days. That being said, these Marley pods make a nice cup of coffee when used with a pod system.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, these pods are probably not going to get good results with anything other than a pod brewer. I use a Keurig at home, so like others I'm going to take these on trips to use in the hotel brewers.<br /><br />If you like a lighter blend, the Marley Yirgacheffe is a good choice.

review/summary: Decent taste
review/text: The producers of this coffee did a marvelous job on the artistic packaging, but the coffee itself lacks the pizazz I'd expect from a coffee pod. I made the coffee in more than just the coffee pod, including taking the grinds out of the pod and putting them through my own filter, but the result was still the same--the taste was forgettable.<br /><br />The packaging, like I said, was marvelous, but each packet had to be opened with scissors because there was no tear cut. Just a little thing, but noticeable.<br /><br />If you like want organic coffee and you like Ethiopian beans, this is still a good option over other non-organic pods.

review/summary: Decent coffe but not for the stronger coffee lovers.
review/text: This coffee brewed up nicely.  However I love a nice strong cup and found this coffee too weak for me.  If you are looking for a midrange coffee, I would recommend trying this.  By if you are like me and need something stronger, this coffee is not for you.

review/summary: Good Ethiopian With a Strong Taste
review/text: I actually googled this, so bear with me.  This is Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, not Ethiopian Harrar, which apparently is different.  "Yirgacheffe is known for its orange flower scent."  Having never smelled an orange flower, I couldn't tell you.  What I can tell you is that is Ethiopian that isn't burned like that well-known chain's version.  It also has cute life-affirming things on the box like, "Profits donated to sport", which is probably more meaningful if you live somewhere where they use "sport" as a noun.<br /><br />It can also be cold brewed, and I think I almost like it better that way.  The caffeine kick isn't quite what I expected, but then, this isn't that chain's Ethiopian, either.
