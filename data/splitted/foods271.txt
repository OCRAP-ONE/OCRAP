review/summary: Excellent Allergy Response!
review/text: My 10 year old cocker spaniel has been treated for chronic ear and paw yeast infections for the past 9 years.  He's had chronic, stinky black gunk in his ears and a black waxy substance covering his toes.  I would guess that I've spent thousands of dollars on vet visits, tests, shampoos, ear medications, wipes, antibiotics - you name it - none of which worked for more than a week.  My vet even tried a "new" process where the dog's ears were filled with some type of medication every week (at the vets - $50 a week) for a couple of months - but there was no improvement.  My poor dog has scratched himself raw and spent much of his day licking and digging at his yeast-encrusted paws or scratching his sore, smelly ears.  Recently, I've been bathing him every 2 days with Malaseb Shampoo (which did seem to help), but he had to stand for 15 minutes with the shampoo covering him, before the medication could be rinsed from his skin.  Poor little dog.<br /><br />While on a trip to Florida, I took my spaniel to a new vet who prescribed more ear drops, wipes, and shampoo in an attempt to help my dog.  The vet  asked me if I'd ever tried changing his food from Eukanuba, which he's been on since he was a puppy.  No vet had ever mentioned that my dog could be allergic to his food and it seemed so simple.  I found Natural Balance Sweet Potato & Venison at Petco and thought I'd try a food trial.  What a difference!  In the two weeks since he's been on this dog food his yeast infection appears to be gone.  His ears are clear, with no discharge or irritation and the skin on his paws is starting to look pink and healthy.  I can't believe the difference in such a short time!  He's not scratching, either.  The Florida vet had said that a food trial would require at least 2 months, but I'm seeing such an improvement in only 2 weeks.  Pretty amazing!

Now, any dog we get will now eat Natural Balance LTD. Our vet recommended this to us after our boston terrier got bladder stones, wish we would have known about it sooner.

review/text: Perfect food for the Shar-Pei breed ... after raising Shar-Pei dogs for 20 years, it is obvious that this food is the healthiest found for their particular skin problems and allergies.  This is a wholesome food that is all natural, without dyes and unnatural ingredients.  I would definately recommend this food for any breed but definately for the Shar-Pei breed.

review/summary: Helps with my dogs' chronic vomiting/stinky anal glands
review/text: My Black Russian Terrier has had chronic vomiting and dry heaves for six years. Multiple vet visits and and a trip to MedVet for a thorough workup could not pinpoint the cause. I tried many meds/supplements/foods to try to solve this problem with no results. After seeing the reviews of this food I decided to try it even though the price is outrageous - desperate times call for desperate measures! Titan's vomiting and dry heaves have decreased dramatically since being on this food (he's been on it for about 1.5 months now). Yay! Since it worked so well for him, I decided to try it on one of my other dogs, a PBGV with major stinky anal gland issues. Even though I hadn't read any reviews about this food working for that, I thought it was worth a shot. I was told that more fiber in his diet might help to bulk up his stool and this food seemed to have more fiber. Jack has been on this food for about a month now and we haven't had any stinky anal gland issues so far. My only issue with this food is the price (a 110-pound dog goes through it like crazy). If it weren't for the ridiculous price, I would give this food 5 stars.

review/summary: Excellent alternative to overpriced Royal Canin (IVD) product
review/text: Our dog is on a lifelong limited ingredient diet due to inflammatory bowel disease.  He eats the venison & potato dry food and gets a low maintenance dose of prednisone.  The IVD (now Royal Canin) food worked well, but we've were outraged by the constant price hikes and annoyed by the inconvenience of only be able to buy the food at a vet.  Then we discovered Natural Balance.  On a price per pound basis it's about half the price. Our dog has done very well with this food.  Although there is no way for me to be sure, I also think it's likely that sweet potato is more nutritious than plain potato, so that's another benefit.  If you buy from Amazon there is free shipping and no sales tax, as well.<br />The food is a little more dense, so if you're switching from Royal Canin you might want to weigh your regular feeding of the old food, and determine how much of a scoop of the new food gives the same weight.  Not a big difference, but if you want to feed the exact same amount then go by weight.<br />Very pleased with this food.  It's still expensive, but not like the thuggish price gouging from Royal Canin.

review/summary: Skin allergies are clearing up
review/text: Our 2 year old pointer mix dog has a variety of allergy issues. After she developed hair loss and red spots on her hip, head, and paw that would not heal, we decided to put her on an elimination diet. She has been eating this product for about two months now, and with the help of some antibiotics to treat a secondary staph infection, and daily Benadryl, her skin has healed and her fur is growing back. I am very happy with the way this food appears to be hypoallergenic for her. She likes both the food and matching treats.<br /><br />FYI- We also provide her with smoked elk bones from Venison Joe's, and she LOVES them. I want to mention this because it is hard to find appropriate bones for dogs on an elimination diet.

review/summary: Just buy it already!
review/text: We switched to the Natural Balance Sweet Potato and Venison formula after our vet recommended we try it due to possible food allergies in one of our dogs. After switching we noticed a very definite difference in allergies (mostly ear infections) and our dogs have been on this for years. They're both 75lbs and 11 years and going very strong (hopefully for a long time still!) and I credit a lot of that to their quality food, plus regular exercise and fish oil supplement. I would recommend this food all day long.<br /><br />Yes, it costs more than the cheap food (when does good food not cost more?) but the dogs love it, eat less of it than their previous food and it has helped keep them going well into their senior years.

review/summary: Allergies Gone
review/text: I have a 6yr old Pit.  She has been dealing with itchy allergies for the past few years, where she will bite her paws and scratch her belly until it is raw and inflamed.  The only thing that helped is the steroid shot from the vet, and also pill steroids, but we did not want to keep her on these every 3-4 months to control the outbreaks.  The vet said to try switching her food, and after some research I chose this product.<br /><br />At first, she loved the food, probably because it was different.  After a couple days, however, it did not settle well with her and she did have a couple accidents.  She did not seem to like the food after this, but we stuck with it and she has not had any accidents and eats it fine.  After about three weeks her paws have healed and itchies are gone.  I hate that it is so expensive, but it is cheaper than taking her to the vet every 3-4 months for medication and it is nice she is not stinky and miserable anymore.  1 bag has lasted about a month for our 80lb dog.  I would recommend trying it, but be careful about the dog getting used to it first--I probably should have mixed 1/2 new and 1/2 old and made the transition gradually.

It's been 10 months and we're also trying the duck and salom, which are less expensive. FYI, I contacted the company and found out the calories: 1 cup food 437, 1 large treat 37.5, 1 small treat 2.

review/summary: Dog Will Not Touch This Stuff
review/text: I bought this food back in February and the bag is still sitting in the pantry almost completely full. The dog simply will not eat it. I tried everything I could think of to get him to eat it: mixed in a little olive oil (which usually does the trick for him with other food; didn't work), mixed it with grated cheese (somehow the dog managed to eat just the cheese), mixed it with yogurt (he begs for anything that's dairy; no dice), mixed it turkey grease after browning ground turkey (he ate 2 bites, and that was it). I even ate a kibble of it myself just to see, and honestly it didn't taste that bad, kind of like very bland, grainy-vegetable granola. So, I figured that when he got hungry enough, he'd eat it. For 3 days he ate nothing, and finally on day 4, I broke down and bought other food.

review/summary: high quality ingredients, no allergic reaction, and my pug likes it!
review/text: When my pug reached 2 years old, he had one skin rash after another. My vet suggested that we put him on a limited ingredient diet that cut out corn and other grains and instead used potatoes as the carbohydrate source. Natural Balance LID Potato & Duck Formula worked quite well for us, but we could tell that our pug was looking for some variety so we tried their Sweet Potato and Venison formula.<br /><br />According to the Natural Balance web site, some dogs develop sensitivities to commonly used proteins, carbohydrates, and food additives. This may cause stomach and intestinal problems, as well as skin irritations. In our dog's case, it was his red irritated skin on his belly that led us to try a limited ingredient diet. The Natural Balance Sweet Potato and Venison formula combines fresh venison, a source of animal protein that most dogs have not been exposed to, and sweet potato, premium quality carbohydrate rich in potassium and a highly digestible energy source. Other key ingredients include canola oil, low in saturated fat and high in monounsaturated fat, as well as an excellent source of Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids, along with flaxseed, another quality source of Omega-3 fatty acids. The food is completely grain free (no barley, wheat, rice or corn) and contains no artificial colors or flavors.<br /><br />The kibble is a small oval-shaped disk. It's fairly flat and measures just a hair over half an inch wide. My pug is able to eat it easily, although in his case, he pretty much inhales his food and doesn't chew it much. It has a slight meaty smell, which I think he likes, as the Potato and Duck formula didn't seem to have much of an enticing scent.<br /><br />My local specialty pet food store tells me this is #1 selling dog food. I can see why! Our pug continues to do well with this LID formula, just like he did with Potato & Duck. His skin shows no sign of redness and irritation, and just as importantly, it appears to agree well with his stomach. He doesn't get gassy and his stool is not loose or showing any other signs of intestinal distress. It also appears to keep his appetite under control as he doesn't beg for so many treats between meals and doesn't start asking for dinner so early as he did with some other foods in the past. If it keeps him happy and itch-free, then we're happy, too. 5 stars.

review/summary: Such a change in my dogs health and well being!!!!
review/text: Let me say I am reviewing this product after a complete year of my dog being on it.  I feel that is a good amount of time to give a complete review.  With that being said, I could have reviewed this food after just one month of use and it would be the same.  I have a Dogo Argentino that weighs around 110 lbs.  She had itchy skin, hair loss, runny goober eyes, heat spots, severe and never ending ear infections and skin tumors (multiple surgeries to have them removed).  She was only a year and three quarters old when we started her on this food.  Our doggie dermatologist....yes, doggie dermatologist and our local vet suggested switching her to this food.  Boy did it change our dog's, and our, lives.  Within a month, without any other treatment...just by switching her to this food her heat spot went away, her hair started growing back, her eyes quit having discharge and we haven't had not one more ear infection or skin tumor!!!!  We could not be happier with this food.  She ONLY eats this food and she ONLY eats the treats of the same brand and make.  The price is steep especially when feeding it to a 110 lb dog, but the money we have saved in vet bills and with her being a happy dog it is soooo worth it.  The other option was Hills Science Diet from my vet with cost twice as much as this.  I am so glad this food has fixed my dog.  I used to buy it at pet co, but when I found it on Amazon I was thrilled.  No more driving an hour to the petstore and having to lug the big bag around.  Amazon is very price competitive and it is delivered right to my front door and no shipping fees.  Wonderful!

Issues A Voluntary Nationwide Recall on Specific Venison Dog & Cat Food Products<br /><br />Contact:<br />Consumer Inquiries:<br />(800) 829-4493<br />Media Inquiries:<br />Daniel Bernstein<br />310-275-0777<br /><br />FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- Pacoima, CA -- April 17, 2007-- Natural Balance, Pacoima, CA, is issuing a voluntary nationwide recall for all of its Venison dog products and the dry Venison cat food only, regardless of date codes. The recalled products include Venison and Brown Rice canned and bagged dog foods, Venison and Brown Rice dog treats, and Venison and Green Pea dry cat food. Recent laboratory results show that the products contain melamine. We believe the source of the melamine is a rice protein concentrate. Natural Balance has confirmed this morning that some production batches of these products may contain melamine.<br /><br />The recall was prompted by consumer complaints received by Natural Balance involving a small number of cats and dogs that developed kidney failure after eating the affected product.<br /><br />Dogs or cats who have consumed the suspect food and show signs of kidney failure (such as loss of appetite, lethargy and vomiting) should be seen by a veterinarian. We recommend our customers immediately stop feeding our recalled venison products regardless of date code and return unused product to their retailer for a full refund.<br /><br />The products are packaged in bags, cans and zip lock treat bags and sold in pet specialty stores and PetCo nationally.<br />No other Natural Balance products are involved in this voluntary recall as none of our other formulas include the rice protein concentrate.<br /><br />Although the problems seem to be focused on a particular production period of the venison products, over the last four days we have notified our distributors and retailers by phone and e-mail to immediately stop selling and return all recalled Venison dog foods and treats and the Venison dry cat food. Venison canned cat food is not involved.<br /><br />The source of the melamine appears to be a rice protein concentrate, which was recently added to the dry venison formulas. Natural Balance does not use wheat gluten, which was associated with the previous melamine contamination.<br /><br />We continue to work closely with the FDA in their ongoing investigation.<br /><br />Consumers with questions may contact the company at 1-800-829-4493 or email [...]<br /><br />another one:<br /><br />Breaking Voluntary Recall News: Thursday, April 26th, 2007<br /><br />Our canned food manufacturer, American Nutrition, from Ogden Utah, just informed us that they are recalling all canned products made in their plant that contain rice protein concentrate. American Nutrition continued by telling us that they added this ingredient to four of our canned products without our knowledge or consent. The four products involved are:<br /><br />Chicken Formula Canned Dog Food 13 oz<br />Lamb Formula Canned Dog Food 13 oz<br />Beef Formula Canned Dog Food 13 oz<br />Ocean Fish Formula Canned Cat Food 3 oz & 6 oz<br /><br />There have been no illnesses reported related to feeding these formulas, however, to comply with the American Nutrition recall of the four products, we are pulling all dates and batches of these four formulas. We also ask that our customers return unused product for a full credit to their store.<br /><br />To make sure that this does not happen in the future, we are demanding from each of our co-manufacturers daily production record of all of our formulas before they are shipped to us and written certification of NO rice protein or any deviation of our formulas. We have reviewed all of our other products and determined that they are free of rice protein concentrate and that all of our other product labels are accurate.

review/summary: Great Alternative to Caffeine!
review/text: I originally started drinking Cafe Altura Dark Roast Decaf when I was pregnant, as I wanted to avoid caffeine.  I chose this decaf because it's made with the Swiss Water Method, meaning there are absolutely no harmful chemicals.  I continued to drink the Dark Roast while breastfeeding, but after that I started drinking regular coffee again.  However, after just a month, I'm switching back to this Dark Roast Decaf.  I like the taste, and I feel healthier drinking it.  Like the previous reviewer, I probably make it a little stronger than the instructions specify--but then I do that with all coffee.  If you're looking for a healthy alternative way to start your day (sans Folgers in your cup), this is a good option.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: If you're looking for a full-bodied, rich dark-roast decaf, keep looking.  The only way to make this coffee worth drinking is to use 1.5 times the amount I usually use for a dark roast.  Even then, it's nothing special.

review/summary: Very bitter coffee.  Rude customer service!
review/text: I purchased this coffee because of the claims on the packaging that the beans were picked with integrity and with fair practices. I always look for these traits in my coffee, as well as look for organically grown beans. I also always purchase decaf and love strong, dark roasted coffees. So, I brewed this coffee in the same manner as I usually do, with a high-end coffee maker, and it was not good. It had a very, very bitter taste. Like I said, I brewed it the same as I always brew my coffee, added the same creamer, and it was horrible. I tried it again and again, over the course of a week, trying to get better results but it just never got better. This coffee tasted like cheap diner coffee and I was unhappy with it. I emailed Cafe Altura to let them know that I was unhappy with the coffee and would like a refund, and received the most rude email back from the president of the company. I mean, I was shocked! The president basically told me that my experience with Cafe Altura was not his problem and that he would not offer me a refund. I kindly explained my whole brewing experience, and that I was not happy with the coffee, and that I simply wanted to bring this to his attention. I was very polite in my emails with him and received snarky marks, uncaring and condescending put-downs and an ego trip. I was truly shocked by the level of customer service from the president of the company. After explaining my experience, and receiving a few rude emails, my email responses went unanswered. I again, politely, asked for a refund and to date my emails are now being ignored. I will never buy this coffee again and want to spread the word to my family and friends to stay away from this coffee as well based on my experience.

review/summary: Holy Hades!
review/text: So I purchased this thinking it would be a novelty item. I just wanted to see people choke, cough, spit and wheeze when they tried this. Quite the opposite happened. These became an IMMEDIATE crowd pleaser. The chip itself is as perfect as a kettle chip can get: crunchy, thick with a robust potato flavor and not greasy. The spices. Dear God the spices. It takes a few seconds, but when the habanero kicks in, yeah, you'll "feel alive". The level of heat does not take to your knees. I found myself going for more! Certainly ingesting these does not come without hazards (tear jerking restroom moments), but I guarantee you it is quickly forgotten after that bag stares you in the face when you open the pantry. I'll be ordering more once I'm down to four bags. For the rest of the nation buried under snow, a bag of this will put your body in the Bahamas.

I love spicy food and I can eat a whole bag of Flaming Hot Cheetos no problem, but I need something to drink after about ten of these chips. Probably the hottest chips I have eaten so far. I paid $30 something bucks for 14 bags, no regrets! If there is anything hotter and better tasting, please let me know.

review/summary: The spiciest chips EVER!!!!
review/text: I love eating spicy foods and so I was looking for chips that were really spicy because you can't find it anywhere besides dipping chips in salsa. I have tried all kinds of spicy chips, but this tops it by far. Usually it takes a while of eating the chips to feel that burn on your tongue, but after eating one chip of the Blair's habanero, you instantly get that kick of hotness on your tongue. The chips are nice and crunchy like the kettle cooked chips. I recommend this to any lover of spicy foods. I have already bought this twice on amazon and I will soon have to buy another box because it's just that good.

I purchased the 5 oz bags and shared them with co-workers.<br /><br />From the first bite you get a nice smokey flavor and then the heat starts to kick in. After a few more chips you just can't stop crunching while beads of sweat pop out on your brow and your sinuses start clearning out.<br /><br />Love these chips!

review/summary: Hottest on earth
review/text: I am a hot food junkie and found these chips at a local grocery store.  I got addicted and kept searching for them again and again, but they must have been on a trial run, never to return.  Amazon fortunately had them, but in palette sized orders rather than a couple bags.  Oh well.  This is simply the most nuclear, face napalm, gastro grenading potato chip I have ever had.  If you're a sadistic snack aficionado like me, try these.  A half bag into it, you will be paying the price.

review/summary: Fire Burning
review/text: *Warning* These chips are like eating a raw habanero pepper.<br /><br />This is literally the hottest processed food product I've ever eaten. I use to think what I normally ate was pretty hot, until I tried these. They taste pretty good, but good luck trying to eat a whole bag in one sitting. I can barely get down 10 chips before my nose and eyes are watering and my mouth is on fire. I'd compare their taste, texture, and crunchiness to Tim's Cascade Jalapeno (which I love,) but they're probably around 5 times as hot as those chips. Don't get me wrong, these things are pretty tasty, but I'm still working on polishing off my first bag that I received 3 days ago.<br /><br />I'm probably going to keep some for myself to eat, since they don't go bad for a year from now, but the others I'm probably going to use for pranks on my family and friends. Only takes one chip to set your mouth on fire. =D

review/summary: Outright dangerous
review/text: I love spicy snacks and was looking for something a bit spicier than Flamin Hot Cheetos.  I have several bottles of Blair's hot sauces so I knew that I would definitely not be disappointed with the spice level on these chips.  The first few chips that I put in my mouth, were spicy, but more flavor than I expected.  So I ate a couple more.  Then the heat intensity starts to kick in. Unlike other habanero foods, this one had a bit of a creeper affect rather than hitting you like a freight train from the beginning.  Then my mouth started to burn and the tears started rolling.  God, how I love that feeling.  Sadistic, I know. They really do make you feel alive.  I keep several bags at work so I can have something to get over the afternoon hump around 3 pm.  They do the job well as I get a level of alertness that caffeine just can't deliver.  It also makes me appear like a more sensitive guy since I am crying the whole time.  Eating these chips has also produced a nice side effect for me - I am unbelievably hydrated throughout the day.  My skin has never looked better.  The only warning I would give when eating these chips is that the pepper powder they use is extremely light. So when you pop them in your mouth, you will inevitably get some up your nose via your nasopharynx.  It will make you sniffle like a coke addict from the 80s. A bit annoying but great for clearing up sinuses. Oh yeah, my best advice is that you should really wash your hands thoroughly before using the bathroom - like 2-3 times.  Otherwise a fate that I wouldn't even wish upon my worst enemy will await you. Let's just say I am prone to learning life lessons the hard way. i won't go into details but it involved milk and was something like a scene out of American Pie.

Very nice blend of heat as its actually a bit sweet if you get through the bag.

I research and found out u can only GE these via internet not in any store,  which is a bummer but extreme food website and Amazon always have great special.  So I recommended purchaseing a lot so you don't run out.<br />These are a great conversation piece at parties everybody always says same 2 things<br />1.  OMG THESE ARE SO HOT.<br />2.  I can't stop eating because these are so good.<br />Definitely have milk around to help the heat factor.  I now have my boyfriend hooked and a fan.  This last purchase I orders him the 14/5oz bag set.  He is in 7th heaven.  Definitely will last a while cause u can only eat so many cause of the heat but so tastey u wanna keep going back for more.<br />Remember have milk on hand LOL enjoy.

review/text: I rarely do product reviews on Amazon BUT after having the 1st bag I knew I had to say something!<br /><br />These chips are not for the faint. They have a wonderful kettle cooked crunch to them and the bag size is the perfect munching snack to watching a movie.  These are not only going to make a good snack for me (as I really like spicy foods) but will also make the perfect laugh when I let friends try them...<br /><br />These chips have a wonderful flavor and not too much spice (if any at all) when you first chomp into a them, but wait for it, after 5-10 second the burn starts to come usually about the time you reach for your second or third and by then it is too late.<br /><br />The burn lasts for a solid 10-15 minutes after eating a few handfuls and personally made me sweat a good deal as I finished off my first bag while watching a movie.<br /><br />These I would easily buy again and recommend them to ANYONE who wants a good laugh at someone else's expense OR of you really like painfully spicy hot sauce. Although they were a good deal spicier than I expected. If you know Blair's they are know for the very hottest of hot sauces and NOW I think they can also brag they have the hotest snacks!

review/text: As a long time fan of Blair's death products, I am familiar with Blair's other spicy items like his sauces. However I had never tried any of his chips.<br /><br />Until now.<br /><br />These are the tastiest, crunchiest, and easily the spiciest chips known to man. Everything you love in a chip all rolled in to one.<br /><br />Do not be deceived by the fact that it says chipotle on the bag. This is some concentrated stuff here. Personally I can only eat 2-3 chips per serving. It's that hot.

review/text: I have not been a fan of kettle style chips in the past, but for these I'll make an exception.  2-3 chips in and you've got a burn going on.  I have looked for a truly hot chip for some time, and most fall seriously short.  For those not "appreciative" of the heat level of these chips, they are overwhelmed with the hot, and say it covers up the taste.  Not for me!  Actually, I could use them somewhat hotter, but they are not a disappointment.  Good heat, great with beer.

I bought a package of 14 without trying them on the reccomendation of a buyer on Amazon, who mentioned that since Dorito  Habanero Chips are no longer on the market these are the next hottest ones available.  I agree, I bought them since he knows that the now extinct Habanero Dorito chips were the best ever, finally found a chip that I could not eat the whole bag at one sitting.  My sons are happily eating Blairs Death Rain Habaneros and feeding them to unsuspecting people and animals to watch their reaction.  The chips are crunchy, not greasy, and HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT as claimed,  these chips are not for patsies.  I lived in Mexico for over 20 years and love hot food, these chips will cater to that craving.  Dick

review/summary: XXX HOT with crunch and good flavor.
review/text: If like me, you were looking for chips that are actually hot as the label says, these are the chips for you. They are tongue burning, sinus clearing, eyes watering hot if you eat more than a few chips. Also they have a nice hint of barbecue chip flavor, and that good crunch of kettle chips.<br />They are enjoyable to eat, and not just for the novelty of eating the hottest chip you can find.<br />I bought the case and shared a few bags with other lovers of hot foods.

What makes these so good is that the heat is ALL there but there is tons of flavor too! The Parmesean & Cajun are also quite good with a bit less heat!

Everyone is raving about level of heat.<br /><br />The chip quality is very good, very crunchy like a kettle cooked chip should be.<br /><br />Must agree with the previous review, wash your hands after you eat these.  You do not want Habanero in your eyes!<br /><br />I have found that they are often out of stock, I signed up to be notified as soon as they came in, then I snagged two cases.

review/summary: Not so great
review/text: I first ordered the Chipotle flavor.  I didn't enjoy the flavor very much, but the texture was crispy and the amount of flavor was perfect.  There was plenty of flavor there but it wasn't overwhelming like some brands are.  It was because of this that I decided to give Blair's a second chance.  I ordered the Habanero flavor next.  I was extremely disappointed.  Gone was the perfect amount of flavoring the chipotle chips had.  Instead the chips had so much seasoning it was darn near falling off the chips.  I've had a few brands of habanero before, but this one tasted nothing like any of them.  It has almost a sweet flavor to it.  I personally didn't care for it at all.  On top of it all, the chips aren't even very hot.  I was very disappointed in how hot both chips were considering the brand is called Death Rain.  If you can find them, try Poore Brothers Habanero chips.  THOSE are some hot chips, with a fantastic flavor.

review/summary: Miracle Food  :)
review/text: I have a 6 year old dachshund that I adopted from another family about 6 months ago (I have another dachshund too). The newly adopted dog had a few problems. She had lost the hair on her ears and they were fairly red on the inside too. She had lost a little hair on her tail as well. She licked her front paws too. Her stool was a light tan color and soft. Her previous owner had her on Iams food and Melatonin pills for her hair loss. I researched thoroughly and decided to try this food. At first I tried the Sweet Pot. & Fish. It smelled a little and my dogs would barely eat it. I switched to the Sweet Pot & Venison and they love it. I can't express what a difference it has made in the adopted dog. I stopped the Melatonin pill too. It took a few weeks, but her hair has grown back, ears not red anymore, no paw licking and stool normal dark and firm. I'm careful about treats to her, so she gets the Sweet Pot. & Venison treats as well to try and be consistent to her stomach. I highly recommend this product!

review/summary: My dog already seems healthier!
review/text: My 12 year old mixed breed dog began to have itchy skin  and she would scratch until she had bald spots.  I took her to the vet and he said it was allergies. He thought it was something that I had bathed her in, but the problem persisted. I had also noticed that her breath and fur had started to stink really bad. I thought it was her age though and didn't realize the two problems were related.  I've been giving her this food for just over a week and I already see an improvement.  Within a day or two, she began to smell much better. She has scratched some but it is so much better than it was. After only a week, she seems healthier and she is looking younger. Other people have even noticed the change.  I am hopeful that with a little more time that her itchy skin will heal completely. I just ordered a larger bag from Petco because it was a few dollars cheaper than amazon and they have free shipping for a limited time.

review/summary: Finally found a kibble my allergic dog can eat.
review/text: My terrier has many food allergies (beef, fish, dairy, corn, soy, chicken are among those we KNOW).  I had been making her food from scratch using venison, brown rice and peas.  We tried several kibbles including anti allergy perscription types(venison can get very hard to find / expensive out of hunting season) and all of them caused reactions.  This is a little expensive, but it's SO much cheaper and easier than making her food from scratch.  She LOVES the taste (picks it out of the venison meat when mixed together) and all of my dogs now get this kibble as treats so we have less chance of her getting something she is allergic to by accident.  I am so very thankful to have found this food.

review/summary: Agrees with sensitive tummies.
review/text: My 1-year old black lab mix has had stomach issues since small puppyhood, and it took me months to find the right food (and then the right portions) to stabilize his tummy. I tried everything, including the super high priced brands currently popular among the 'boutique pet store shopper' pet parents. I finally settled on Natural Balance Venison & Sweet Potato, and haven't looked back.<br /><br />My dog will eat literally anything, and ate every kind of dog food I put in front of him with equal enthusiasm. But I do appreciate that with Natural Balance, I found a food that agrees with his stomach, gives him the high quality nutrition he needs to run endlessly around the yard chasing balls and squirrels and his dog friends, and is actually fairly reasonably priced.<br /><br />Love that Amazon delivers it for free right to my door, too. No more lugging this heavy bag from the pet store.

review/summary: It turns out my dog is allergic to sweet potatoes...whoops.
review/text: So, after adopting our dog, we discovered he had chronic ear infections, most like due to a food allergy, and so began our search for the perfect food.  This was food number 3.  We made it through about half the bag, when we noticed he was crazy itchy and had another ear infection.  I also went online to research the food and found a number of alarming reviews where dogs had reactions to the food.  Of course, there could be outside circumstances involved in these other instances, so I also made sure to read all the positive reviews.  However, this was clearly not working for my dog.  To settle my concerns around the negative reviews however, I decided to call the company.  It turns out that quite a few dogs are sensitive to sweet potatoes, and also, possibly, peas, which is also an ingredient in this food.  They were super nice, and sent me a voucher for a free bag of treats, and a voucher for a full size replacement bag of food in any of their other varieties, to be redeemed at any pet store that carries their product!  So, although this food was a no go for the Murph, I can't fault the company. They were great.

review/summary: Very very happy
review/text: Initially, I bought this food for my dog because it is considered limited ingredients. She's had some issues with other food and a sensitive and irritable stomach. I try to keep her away from grains, corn, chicken and some other ingredients that tend to trigger dog allergies. I haven't officially gotten her allergy tested as it's pretty expensive...but she does excellent on this food (in addition to a probiotic). In the AM I mix it with some of the brand's wet food because she likes to go on hunger strikes when I leave for work, and it seems to motivate her to eat. I am very happy with this food (and I think my dog is, too!)

review/summary: OMG--these tins are HUGE!!!
review/text: I love Coleman's Mustard.  It adds a hearty kick to sauces and marinades and can double for Chinese mustard. What's not to love?  I don't put it in everything, but I do use it enough that those tiny and expensive grocery store tins aren't practical.  I was delighted to see that Amazon had larger tins.<br /><br />Since it has been a while since I've purchased Coleman's in any size, I was totally unprepared for the size of these containers.  They're HUGE!  This is not a complaint, but I figure three tins will last me about ten years, and I can make table lamps out of the empties.  They're fairly well packed and all three tins seemed to be sealed, but there was a substantial amount of spicy yellow dust inside the package and one tin was dented.  Some leakage and a dent are not deal breakers by any means.<br /><br />As far as the product itself goes, if you have a taste for spicy foods, Coleman's mustard is the bomb!  It will clear your sinuses and bring tears to your eyes.  If you mix up a quantity ahead of time, it will mellow in the fridge, but then what's the point?  I use a ramekin to make up just enough to serve with ham, corned beef or pastrami and pass it around with the appropriate warning. Love this stuff!

review/text: Colman's mustard is as essential an item as salt, pepper, ketchup.  If you don't already use it to make your own mustard, and in rubs, sauces and marinades, you have a treat in store. It has a million uses and, once you begin cooking with Colman's, you'll never want to be without it. If you're not sure what to do with it, or how to use it, a little googling will present a whole world of possibilities. Shop around for the best deal - this one is terrific, as I write this review but as we all know, prices can change. I made the mistake of buying this at my local grocery where I paid $4.99 for 2 ounces!

review/summary: The original
review/text: Next time I order I will order the largest size can.  This is the best mustard for my spicy sweet mustard recipe. There are few fillers in there, so the impact is good.  The price on Amazon (bulk) makes my treat afordable.

review/summary: I love Colman's Mustard!
review/text: Although I love Colman's Mustard, I was not prepared for the amount I received.  Each container is huge and you get 3.  Some of the product had leaked during shipment and the 3 containers and box were dusted with mustard.<br /><br />That being said, the product is the best dry mustard you can buy!

review/summary: Colman's Mustard is the best!
review/text: I use Colman's mustard in several sauces that I cook with, and it is the best powdered mustard I have found. It gives a full bodied, slightly hot zing to the dish, without being too overpowering. Although it is quicker and easier to slather on grey poupon, that product is getting prohibitively expensive. These 16 ounce cans will last me quite a while, and the powder keeps very well on my shelf, while the other mustards take up space in my refrigerator. I bought this in the interests of economy, but there has been no sacrifice by my taste buds.

review/summary: For a terridic holiday gift from the kitchen
review/text: Using a modified recipe for a wonderfully sweet and mildly hot mustard (Brown sugar, maple, additional mustard seeds) I prepare and jar, in decorated wire jars, mustards every year for 30-50 very tasty gifts for all my friends and family 'from the kitchen'. You've never tasted a mustard like it, can be used to croil or bar-b-que, or to salad dressings and sandwiches. The only mustard that works for me for the flavors I want and in the quantities I need is Colmans Mustard powder.

review/summary: I just luv Bialetti.
review/text: Bialetti Trends Collections has had my vote since I bought my first ceramic saute pan.  The color of the plum or purple is super.  Looks so great sitting out on top of the stove.  Works even better cooking with it.  Clean up is a breeze.  Will be collecting more of Bialetti Trends in the near future.  Amazon has done a great job on having super items to choose from.  Amazon and Bialetti are a great team.  Thx so much.
