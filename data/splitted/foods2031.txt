review/summary: Huge Alice in Wonderland fan
review/text: as stated above, im a huge alice in wonderland fan, so i decided to give this a try.<br />im not really a tea person, but this tea isnt very strong and surprised me with how nice it was.<br />i would def. recommend this to anyone who is considering this item.<br />The only issue i had with this product was that the tea i like is on the bottom, which makes it difficult because i had to take all the top ones off before i could get to it. that, and the lid for the clear package is not very sturdy...it slides off.

review/summary: Smooth as silk
review/text: I just found Starbucks Kcups in Bed/Bath/Beyond (also in Target) and of course I had to grab them on the spot!  I tried the House Blend and, unlike other Starbucks flavors, this is very smooth and not at all bitter or "burnt" like the Pike Place blend.  This flavor didn't require nearly as much sweetening and, since it isn't overly strong, it's perfect for use any time of day.  I bought a box of 16 for $11.99 - ($14.99 less the typical Bed/Bath/Beyond 20% discount).  I can't even begin to comprehend Amazon's pricing on this item.....or most other Kcups for that matter.  These kcups will be even more readily available nationwide than Dunkin' Donuts kcups so why the ridiculous pricing, Amazon??!!  Starbucks kcups (10-count) are also available in Von's (Safeway) supermarkets.

review/summary: Better than most!
review/text: Here's the deal with K Cups: they will always taste slightly different than regular brewed coffee.  The reason is with brewed coffee, you can control the strength of the brew, both with how you grind your beans and your water-to-coffee ratio.  With K Cups, the only control you have is how large or small a cup you choose to brew. Larger obviously is weaker, smaller is stronger.<br /><br />I have these K cups.  They are better than many of the others I have tried.  Again, it won't taste EXACTLY like a cup of Starbucks brewed coffee, but is pretty close.  I definitely recommend this over many others.<br /><br />Now, if we could just find them cheaper!

It's a medium/dark roast and very smooth.  Only con is the $$$price$$$.

review/text: Thought I would try Starbucks coffee because I never had it before and wanted to see what all the "talk" was about with Starbucks. I just simply did not like it. It was WAY to strong and a little bitter for my taste. I made the mistake of having this right before bed, which no other coffee has bothered me before, this kept me up almost the whole night, so I can't imagine how much caffine is in it. I'm a newbee when it comes to coffee as I just got a Keurig and am trying all different flavor's and blends. Out of all the ones I've tried, I like this one the least. So far, I like Green Mountain the best - all flavors - IMO.

review/summary: Very nice flavor and smooth!
review/text: Very smooth but also bold on flavor, and no bitterness.  I like this better than Caribou which is also a very nice k-cup coffee. The Starbucks has more flavor than Caribou but pulls it off without turning you off. I brew this Starbucks House Blend on MEDIUM size (8 oz), which works out for my taste when a little creamer (real) is added.  I can't say that it tastes like the Starbucks House Blend you get inside a real Starbucks because I have never tried the house blend inside a Starbucks.  But as k-cups go, this is a pleasant blend with just the right amount of strength (for me) and no bitter aftertaste.  I only gave 4 stars because the price is higher than most other k-cups, otherwise this is a fine coffee.

review/text: I have been a Starbucks afficianado for years and am a recent user of the Keurig system (from Amazon - gift that I thought I would never want!), which I have become very pleased with.  However, the K-cups can seem a little pricey so I was using the Solofill cups (from Amazon) and using my own coffee, but the price of this particular Starbucks House Blend was irresistible, so now I use both. The Keurig system is quick and efficient and now I am even happier with it than before.

review/text: Everyone has different tastes, and I like to mix it up too. After trying many brands and blends for half a year, I have determined that this is my daily drinker, el numero-uno.<br /><br />The closest I can compare it to is perhaps the Caribou Blend, only this is a tad smoother yet somehow richer, and has zero bitterness, and zero aftertaste or chemical taste.  I brew it on the medium (8 oz) setting for what it's worth, but it is probably great stronger or lighter.  This Starbucks blend is very friendly for all drinkers, lightens easily with a little half & half, and so it is my go to for hosting parties.  It is definitely a good way to experience the best of your Keurig!

review/summary: One of the Tastiest of the K-Cups
review/text: Keurig has, for better or worse, pushed the coffee market in a strange direction.  Convenience is championed over quality.  Luckily, Starbucks' House Blend K-Cups are just as good as the bean versions of the coffee that you can purchase in stores.  Out of the blends that I have tried, the House Blend seem to be the most balanced: it's not too acidic, not too bitter, not too bland.  It's just right.  I would recommend this coffee to both coffee novices and coffee experts.<br /><br />With that said, I would recommend comparing prices off Amazon before buying these here.  The prices seem to fluctuate (as they do in other stores as well).

review/summary: Praise cheeses!
review/text: I absolutely love my Keurig. But every now and then I found myself getting bored with the selection of K-Cups. I resorted to buying a reusable K-Cup and filling it with freshly ground beans from Starbucks. The results were less than desirable. I would never get the mesaurements right and I would end up having to make a trip to get coffee.<br />These K-Cups from starbucks are a godsend! the price is not bad. The ratio of coffee grounds to water is the same every time so my coffee comes out great. I am a happy person once again! I also love the house blend because even though it says its a lighter blend, its starbucks. Its roasted darker than most. So if you are a strong coffee lover i think the house blend will suit you just fine.

review/summary: ****Not your typical Starbucks, but good****
review/text: Living in Seattle and using K-cups for over 3 years, I can attest this is a better tasting and more complex flavor than the "typical medium roast" choices and would argue with reviewers that this is a generic blend branded with the Starbucks name.  I would compare this to Coffee People Donut Shop (highly-rated and our personal home staple) with a hint of deeper roasted flavor.  We've tested virtually every available flavor and this ranks in our top 3.  My only complaint (deducted one star) is the high Amazon price since you can often find this 25-30% cheaper at your local franchises.  I've bought 2 cases so far and plan on reordering.

review/summary: Good, but Strong Cup of Coffee
review/text: These K-Cups make a good cup of coffee. As others have said in the reviews, it is stronger than what I would expect from a "Medium." I make these on the largest cup size on the Keurig, and it is still a little strong. However, you can tell that it is Starbucks (even if not quite as good as the in-store coffee).<br /><br />I didn't want to comment on the price of these, but as others have pointed out, they are a bit on the expensive side. However, if you drink Starbucks regularly, you should expect that, and it is still cheaper and more convenient than going to the Starbucks.<br /><br />I would recommend borrowing one of these from someone else or buying a small box of them to make sure you like it, before you buy the bulk package.  But if worst comes to worse, I believe they can be made drinkable (or at least you will be able to find someone else that will drink it, unlike other K-Cups that I have tried, which I could not even give away).

review/text: Price per K-cups get poor marks when assessing for "value"; however, in terms of quality there is an earthiness and flavor profile that far exceeds any regular drip brew that I have experienced for home brewers (with an obvious exception for french press coffee).  What I sacrifice in terms of increased per K-Cup cost is made up for in terms of quality.  I enjoy Starbucks, regardless of their corporate profile.  Going to Starbucks is likely to result in a $4-5 dollar cup of coffee; where as I sit here now and for just about a buck I am enjoying a natural, black cup of Medium Roast Starbies... Loving it...

As other reviewers have mentioned, they are much cheaper at the brick and mortar stores than here. I do want to warn and defend this house blend as an extremely strong cup of coffee without the Bold Roast of the French Starbucks.  I find every other k-cup I've tried (Green Mountain, Newman's, even Starbucks' breakfast blend)to be too watery even on the smallest cup setting but boy these really make it taste like I'm drinking a good strong coffee house cup of joe.  I brew these with a medium cup of water but I think they'd even work with the large size brew. Shame they're so pricey.

review/summary: Taste:  Disappointing.  Cost:  Ridiculous
review/text: For whatever reason, the taste of the entire selection of Starbucks K-cups is average to below average, to actually bad, and the premium price for Starbucks K-cups everywhere (brick and mortar and on-line) is not only premium, but ridiculously so.  I feel half a buck for a K-cup is too high, and over six bits is close to offensive.<br /><br />Pass 'em up, and wait for the purveyors to stop treating us like dope addicts.  Get one of those K-cup single serve refillable filter cups and make your own.  I have two of them and they work great.  Plus, the coffee actually tastes like the real thing...<br /><br />Uncle Ron

review/summary: Usually love Starbucks, but.......
review/text: I was thrilled to see the K Cups finally available from Starbucks coffee....bought a few flavors. I can only speak to the French Roast, as it's the only one I've tried so far in K-Cup form, but it's WAAAYYYYYYYY too bitter. I've had it a hundred times from the shop or at home from the ground bag, so maybe it was a "bad batch" or maybe it develops something from the K Cup packaging, but it's definitely not the typical French Roast flavor I'm used to. I'll give it 3 stars because I'm so happy they are offering it in K-Cups now, and I'm crossing my fingers the flavor is right with the other varieties I purchased.....for review ONLY on the French Roast K-Cup, I'd have given 1 star only.

review/text: This stuff is fabulous.  I have a real chewer, and she knows how to break up the cookies almost immediately by throwing the Kong against the walls and into the air.  By spraying some paste on the inside walls of the Kong, she has to spend some extra time with it, keeping her busy longer!  They absolutely love this stuff - I can hide them anywhere and they know the minute they enter the room that they're around.  Wonderful product.

review/summary: Oh, the gas! The horrible, horrible gas...
review/text: Let's get one thing straight first: dogs love this stuff. I mean they REALLY LOVE IT. Not just my puppy, but every dog in my office - the second this stuff comes out, my desk is surrounded by noses that smelled it from across the office. And they want it so bad they'll watch wistfully as my puppy devours it, just a little bit, from his Kong. When he's done, they get in line to steal the Kong and the lucky one will spend several minutes working on it just in case there's any left.<br /><br />By the end of the afternoon, I am choking on the odor that rises at regular intervals from under my desk in nearly visible clouds of pure dog fart stench. By the time we get home, even the puppy will stop in his tracks every few minutes and startle at his own rear end, not entirely sure what's going on back there but knowing it's probably not good. By the end of the evening I am swearing to myself once again that tomorrow, no matter how desperate I am to occupy him and get some work done, I won't give this stuff to the puppy and turn him into a 6.5lb tactical nuke.<br /><br />I think today was the last time he'll be getting it, and the rest of the can is going in the trash. It's just not worth it!

review/text: Although the product can be a bit pricey, it can be worth it.  I put a Kong liver snap treat (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DHNY6">KONG Stuff'N Snacks, Liver, 11-Ounce, Large</a>) in the Kong (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002AR0I8">KONG Classic Kong Dog Toy, Large, Red</a>) first, then "anchor" it with the liver paste.  I stick the whole thing in the freezer for a few hours to a few weeks, until I want to give it to my dog.  Freezing makes it last 20-30 minutes instead of the 20-30 seconds it would take her to empty the Kong if it wasn't frozen.<br /><br />She is terrified of thunderstorms, and will keep us up with pacing, barking, howling and whining if not distracted.  This stuff will distract her from ANYTHING.  Then I can sleep...ZZZzzzzzzzz.........

review/text: This paste gave BOTH my dogs diarrhea each time I used it. It's also got disgusting fillers. The price is WAY too high for how little use you get out of each can. Just buy a large peanut butter or cream cheese or throw left over chicken in the Kong and freeze it. Why pay this if you can get 20x the use out of a jar of peanut butter? I only caved because I had been curious for months AND it went on sale.

review/summary: Careful with this!
review/text: When I first discovered this product, and how my Toy Fox Terrier puppy reacted to it, I was thrilled.  It was so hard to get her to slow down and do some productive chewing while I was busy.  However, I did notice that her stool was often a bit loose after eating this "puppy goo".  I started stuffing her Kong with kibbles to make sure there was substance and not just the gooey stuff, in hopes that I wouldn't have to take it away from her totally.  It seemed to work for a little while, then suddenly, pools of stool again.  Even when I froze the stuff, it didn't help.  Only gave her one a week, didn't help.  It may be that toy breeds have a difficult time with it and heartier dogs will be fine.  But be cautious.<br /><br />One further note:  I've noticed that the textural contents of the cans vary.  Not sure how or why.  Be wary of expiration dates!

review/text: My dog takes supplements everyday and has for many years. Used to use peanut butter and have used all types. Never really liked doing that because of all the sugar in it. Have tried spreadable cheese too but it's too rich for her system. So saw this while ordering other Kong products and thought I'd give it a try. She's always a little combative but she takes them none the less using this stuff and it doesn't mess up her digestive system. Texture is a little runny even though I refrigerate it but still able to coat her pills well enough with it.

review/summary: Convenient Kong Stuffer but...
review/text: My dogs LOVE the taste of this PB Stuff 'N Paste and I like and appreciate the convenience of being able to add PB to their Kongs with no mess whatsoever. That being said, I went through an entire can of this stuff way too fast. The label says it's concentrated and to use it sparingly, so I did. The problem is, if you have large dogs like I have, you will probably go through a can of this in less than two weeks. It's too expensive for me so I'm back to using real PB in their Kongs.

review/summary: Great stuff!
review/text: I have to say I am a fan of the Kong brand. So far, they're one of the few things I've bought for my Lab puppy that he hasn't managed to destroy. I use the paste inside his Kongs to keep him busy. Whenever he sees the can and start putting some out, the smell gets him all excited. I've tried peanut butter once but it made my pup super hyper (never doing that again). I find this a better alternative.

There are so many corn and soy byproducts in the ingredients list that it's an automatic no for me.  90% of the soy and corn crops are genetically modified (RoundUp Ready--gee they come with their very own pesticide grown in!) and unless it says organic or non-GMO, it's guaranteed to be GM.  I won't eat GM products, and I don't feed them to my livestock or my pets.

review/summary: Superb!
review/text: I developed a liking for butter toffee peanuts when I was on vacation in Michigan one year.  Up there they are available in the nut aisle of pretty much any grocery store.  Down South they are much more difficult to find.  So I actually bribed my sister in law to send them to me once in awhile.  Now I have these!<br /><br />They are packaged very well, in six sealed bags that are packed very tight so the nuts don't slosh all around.  I think about 95% of the butter toffee is still on the nuts where it belongs.  They are also very fresh, and the butter toffee is very good.  I am very picky about these things, and I think this brand is wonderful.<br /><br />The amazing thing is that the fat content on these is only 6g per ounce, and only 130 calories.  Plain peanuts usually have 5-6g of fat and roughly the same amount of calories.  These are healthier than chips and a lot of other stuff, and they taste like carnival food.<br /><br />Treat yourself right and order some today!

review/summary: butter toffee peanuts
review/text: I was looking for some butter toffee peanuts after having some p nuttles and found these from Bergin.  The price was right and there is the super saver from Amazon so thought I'd give them a try.  Here comes a box with 6 packages of butter toffee peanuts tightly wrapped.  They looked good from the outside so I popped one open to sample them.  They were moist and therefore sticky, but that is a good thing for this food. They weren't messy, just stuck together a lot.  The taste was good, and sweet.  There are other companies selling their style of B T nuts, but most that I have tried are dry, maybe a bit old, so these were a good choice.  Everyone in my family preferred these compared to the drier brands.

review/text: I purchased 6 pounds of these peanuts based upon reviews here on Amazon. I guess I was one of the unlucky customers because our bags were full of stale peanuts that even the heavy glaze of butter toffee could not disguise. Some were so bad, I had to spit them out; and that was a regular experience, sorry to say. To Amazon's credit, my purchase money was quickly refunded, so at least I didn't suffer a monetary loss on top of the bitter experience. If you order them, I wish you better luck than I had. I won't be trying them again.

review/summary: I Don't Like
review/text: Guess I'm in the minority here!  I just received my package with the butter toffee peanuts and couldn't wait to try them...and what a huge disappointment.  After reading all the fantastic reviews I thought they would be great.  WRONG.  I only opened one of the six bags but I think all six will be the same- soggy and stale tasting.  Not crunchy or enjoyable in the least.  Also, they taste way too sugary so even if they were edible I don't think they would have been as fantastic as what all the reviewers were giving them.  I know everyone has different tastes, but these had such a heavy praline coating that's just overpowering.  When I eat something coated I still want to be able to taste the main flavor of the item that is coated. Too bad I wasted $27 that is non-refundable.  I definitely will not be ordering any untried grocery items from Amazon in the future.

review/text: I tend to prefer a more traditional tea over herbals.  Herbals generally taste okay, but just don't have the depth that I want from a good cup of tea.  But this cinnamon tea is fabulous.  Has great depth of flavor, a beautiful hit of spice in both the taste and aroma, and a really well balanced cinnamon flavor.  It could have been either insipid or over the top, but Dilmah really did it right - this has actually replaced my traditionals for my normal cuppa.  Love it!

review/text: Normally I drink looseleaf tea, but there are times when I need the convenience of a tea bag.  This is a very serviceable flavored black tea in a bag. This has become my go-to bag when I need a quick cup of tea. The scent of this tea is utterly amazing- strong cinnamon, but not overwhelming. I could sniff the packet all day. Flavor is good for a bag. Most important to me is that the cinnamon flavor is present, but not so overwhelming that it is too sweet. All in all, a quality tea, great for when you need a bag.

The aroma of this steeping tea is marvelous and the flavor lingers delightfully. It's a strong tea, as well, waking me up effectively. Comes in very nice nylon bags, and you can definitely see (as well as taste) the superior quality of the tea leaf.<br /><br />I'll be getting more of this tea, and likely not going back to multiple-source teas, but staying with single-source, now that I knew the difference.

I just figured they had discontinued it.  One day, on a whim, I visited the PR website and saw to my delight that this flavor was still listed.  I did a search and, well, that is when Amazon Grocery came into my life. Now I buy a case of it here and there; I'm not an addict- I can stop anytime I want to.  But why would I want to?!?  I love the thicker Linguine noodles and the sauce flavor is oh-so tasty. So chicken-y and so brocolish-y.  You should buy some RIGHT NOW!  Wait a minute.  If everyone else buys some, there might not be enough for me.  I mean, Amazon has run out before and I had to sign up on some lame notification list that, surprise surprise, didn't notify me when it was back in stock.  NEVER MIND!  NOBODY BUY THIS PRODUCT!

review/summary: Fave flavor but at what cost?
review/text: I like Pasta Roni and keep several types in stock in my cabinet. They're always quick and easy to fix on the stove and only require some butter, water, and usually milk.<br />While cooking the Chicken & Broccoli flavor, I usually wonder if I should just drink the soup instead of waiting for it to cook. It tastes like really good chicken bouillon.<br /><br />But, if you're thinking about buying it on Amazon, check on it at local stores first. Sometimes you can find Pasta Roni for less than 80 cents a box, I used to get it for a dollar at Wal-Mart and Krogers but now it's either $1.12, $1.07, or $1.15.<br />I like Amazon, but it's $1.41 a box when you do the math.<br />If you like the taste of non-generic chicken bouillon and can't find it cheaper, then it could be worth it, though. (I'm tempted to buy the Stroganoff flavor because I can't get it in stores and I picture it being pretty good.)
