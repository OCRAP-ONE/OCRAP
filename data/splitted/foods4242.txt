review/summary: The Best Tea!
review/text: This is awesome tea. Perfect sweetness and taste. I could not make it better. I do make two at a time and get a big glass full...Love it!!! It is hard to find, because it is so popular that everyone runs out of it. Stock up if you can. It is 70 calories a kcup. That's better than a soda with all the acid. Anyway, you will love this taste.

review/text: This tea is the very best iced tea k-cup out there.  I just can't figure out why anybody would buy the 44 pack when it's sooo much more expensive than the 22 pack.  The 22 pack is less than 75� per k-cup whereas the 44 pack makes each k-cup more than a dollar each.  Crazy.

review/text: I love the Green Mountain Sweet Black Tea and that was what I ordered. I opened this sweet tea and brewed a cup (over ice, as instructed). This has a bitter taste the lingers after the tea is gone. It also had no sweetness that I could tell. Even when sugar is added, it has the bitter taste and after taste. I would not recommend to anyone.

They're particularly nice if you don't have an extra moment to dive into a Caramello bar.  However, these still have the same problem all chocolate and caramel bars have - you just can't carry them in your purse to snack on as you go.  They WILL leak out of their foil packages and well, that can get messy!  The chocolate is very, very creamy on these, very smooth, and the caramel is so good.  Just rich and nice.  I still prefer Caramello bars just becasue they're bigger (hee, hee) but these will do as a time saver!  Highly recommend!

review/summary: SENSATIONAL
review/text: Every so often something comes along that you're glad you discovered. Such is the case with Gharardelli Chocolate Squares.  One bite of these caramel-centered chocolates, and I'm transported to chocolate heaven where all's right with the world!<br /><br />Each square is the thinnest sandwich with chocolate on the outsides and a just-as-thin layer of caramel inside.  Unless you make a concerted effort, you don't taste the caramel separately, and it all blends in for a sweet sensation.  However, if you manipulate the square "just so" in your mouth, you can find that sweet caramel by itself.<br /><br />No matter which kind of chocolate you prefer, the sensations are the same. The chocolate itself is the smoothest, creamiest, and purest you'll ever taste.  You will marvel over it! The caramel is the same, like melted butter on your tongue.<br /><br />Alas, the square melts in your mouth, and you're left with a sweet aftertaste, like slowly waking from a happy dream.  And then it's gone.  You have two choices: Use the most determined discipline and forget about the experience, or do what most of us do: Reach for another piece!!!

review/summary: Finally!
review/text: I have been on a search for this spice for my BB-Q sauce for that last 2 years. I finally found it here on amazon and the company that supplies it is wonderful. Silver Cloud Estates did an amazing job of making and sending out this spice to me. I hated going into the store and hearing that they could not get it. It's such a simple spice that does not require that much hard work to find. I know first hand I found it on Amazon. It was also nice to see people paying attention to detail. This spice is not what people think and Silver Cloud Estates makes sure that you as the consumer knows this and knows what you're paying for. That means that when I add my Pasilla Negro chili powder it is not at all the same as my Ancho Chili Powder and the taste is completely different. I appreciate that since I use both in my BB-Q sauce. Thank you Silver Cloud Estates and Amazon for providing me with my "special" chili powder. Well done.

review/text: I am all for the idea of chewing gum made with Xylitol, and wanted to try out this brand. I previously bought a supply of Epic brand direct from the company, and I don't like Xylichew nearly as well. There is a whole lot less cinnamon flavor, and it seems to fade out in 10 seconds, leaving a bubble-gum aftertaste. To be honest, Epic flavor is not long lasting either, but at least it starts out with lots of flavor. I won't be buying any more, at least not the cinnamon - I might try one of the other flavors.

review/text: This is a good gum in the Xylitol gum pantheon. It is not as good as Xylichew's licorice flavor, but it is better than their fruit flavor. The cinnamon flavor is a bit synthetic I find, but not bad. It starts off fairly intense, and holds flavor alright, but I actually like the lost flavor taste as I find it tastes a bit like cola candy, if that makes any sense. Overall, I would recommend this gum. DO NOT buy Xyliburst gums, which are the shortest lasting gums ever. I only buy Xylichew and I am not a shill.

review/text: I started getting Xylichew gum after doing research on different types of gum.  Most sugar free gums are sweetened with Malitol and Manitol which can very easily cause diarrhea in adults and so are not very good in large amounts.  My husband chews massive amounts of gum and so was getting the aforementioned malady.  Xylichew not only avoids the gastrointestinal problems but xylitol (the sweetening agent used) is actually good for teeth and can be a good addition for dental hygiene.

review/text: I used to get David's chocolate-covered sunflower seeds when I was in my teens. I only ever found them at Big Lots (so not too popular apparently). I LOVED them. I've looked for years to find them without the gross candy coat that completely masks the chocolate flavor. Finally, I found them on here and I was so happy and excited! They were VERY good, but just not quite the same as the ones before. It's the difference in the chocolate, I'm sure, but I'll still be getting them again because I enjoy them so much and it sure beats that candied stuff.

review/summary: Wonderful Olives!
review/text: I love, love, love olives in general, but am often disappointed in "marinated" olives because they are either very oily/greasy, or the herbs are bitter or unpleasantly "twiggy".  These olives are none of the bad things, and all of the good things -- salty, tasty, bursting with flavor.  An added bonus is the convenient package size -- it's about two good servings, and is in a nice little recloseable plastic tub.  I have NOTHING bad to say about these olives, and am about to order them again!

review/text: First off, it was DELICIOUS. Mango was definitely the main ingredient, although to my dismay there is also other juices blended in (grape juice) I'm sure as filler but either way if I am special ordering something I'd like it pure. It tasted great, although the real reason I am giving it a 3 star is because it did not come as pictured. It arrived in a cardboard carton. I was really hoping for the glass one pictured, or at the very least plastic.

review/summary: Not quite the same as what you get in stores
review/text: Packaging looks exactly the same as what you buy in stores, but the contents, strangely, are not quite the same. Store-bought salmon cans contain solid chunk(s) of fish covered with a little bit of semitransparent liquid. This thing here otoh, is not solid fish, but more like broken-up mish-mash in a larger amount of rusty looking, smelly liquid. I didn't quite like it and still prefer the store-bought version, even though it's a tad more expensive. I can frequently get this thing on sale though, where it's even cheaper than this online offering. Otoh, perhaps it's this particular shipment that was defective. I'll try again and update this review. As of right now it's three stars: useable, but noticeably inferior to the same product obtained in a physical grocery store (I can't begin to guess what this difference might be due to).<br /><br />PS. Btw. I bought this for eleven-forty-eight w/ free shipping (I begin to mention prices 'cause I see mind-blowing overnight price increases on many products. Like this one now is twenty-four, DOUBLE what it was  less than two months ago -- is it nuts of what?) Please do the same and mention specific numbers in your reviews. Never assume tht just because you buy online you get a good price: surely this thing doesn't cost six bucks a pop at a store? Three-thirty-five in my "favourite neighborhood" establishment. Sellers' greed has no limits; don't fall victim to it.<br /><br />04/25/2012 PPS. And now I see it tripled in price. Wow. Moving on.<br />06/05/2012 Just bought a crate of these for two for five in a drugstore (of all places). So it's two fifty a can. Gonna last me a while.

review/text: I use canned pink salmon for salmon loaf and salmon cakes. Over time I have used many brands but this Bumble Bee Brand is the best I have found. The taste is clean and fresh.There are minimal skin and bones in the meat. Both are edible but easy to pick out too if you prefer. I am very glad I found this brand and it will now be my brand of choice.  The price for 4 cans was very reasonable at Amazon too. Shipment was fast and arrived with no damage. But the stars are earned by the good taste of this Omega-3 fish.

It works awesome for fish and veggies. The flavor is phenomenal, and the amount you need for that salty taste is perfect. We ordered several different salts (pink, gray, black, etc.)....but this one is, by far, our favorite over all. It tastes so clean!!!<br /><br />You want good flavor without the unhealthy punch of regular salt? This is your answer. Very versatile and welcome.

I certainly don't consider myself to have a refined palate, but there is no mistaking the flavours. A little goes a long way - another reason this salt is well worth the extra expense.

review/summary: Quite hard crystals not as good as others
review/text: I got this and "Course Gray Sea Salt" from Brittany both from Amazon. The crystals in this salt tend to be very hard and hence are more like little stones than anything else and also do not impart as much flavor as you eat them added to your meal.<br /><br />I have not tried grinding them up. The other salt was not as hard crystals and added a lot of good flavor to the meals I added it to (sprinkling a little on top).<br /><br />I will not get this again. I will get the other again.<br /><br />It will last you forever unless you are a salt junky looking for high blood pressure, as this amount of salt is a HUGE amount of salt in you want to stay healthy. Just a tiny bit with each meal is plenty, and that is the problem here! The tiny bit doesn't impart much flavor or texture. The Brittany did.

review/summary: great tea
review/text: I just spent a small fortune on four different types of this tea. Along with the pitcher and tins. I just went on Amazon and saw that it was a fraction of the cost I paid for. But I must say this tea is outstanding, in taste and a little goes a long way. I will most definitely purchase it through Amazon and not at the actual store. Wish I had done some research before spending lots of money on these products.

review/summary: Great for food allergies - and even if you don't have them!
review/text: These muffins have always been a hit with my daughter! She is 6 and has severe food allergies to milk and egg. Almost all boxed cake mixes require one or the other as an added ingredient, or it is already in the mix. When we found these, we felt like our quest for the perfect muffin (aka cupcake) was over! We have tried other allergen-friendly brands, and they just dont compare. Everyone (adults and children alike), love these cupcakes! I buy milk-free frosting, and icing them just as I would with any other cupcake. They look great and taste fabulous! Since my daughter is at the age where she is getting invited to a lot of birthday parties, I make a batch of these, freeze them and then when we have a party to go to, I take one out and icing it so that she can have a cupcake at the party. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: We use many of the Cherrybrook Kitchen products. Our five-year-old son has multiple food allergies. We have to avoid milk, eggs, peanuts and tree nuts. We have tried several other allergy-friendly brands. This is by far the best in terms of taste. Packaging is nice to look at, too, not that that is a factor... but the boxes are cute and my kids get excited when they see them tucked up on the shelf. Highly recommend the chocolate chip muffin mix as well as the brownies, chocolate cake, vanilla cake and both chocolate and vanilla frosting mixes. The pancake mix is simply awesome. Buying in bulk through Amazon is the most affordable way I've found to purchase these mixes.

review/text: I ordered 4 cans of this product.  The product is fine, but 3 of the 4 cans were dented.  Many people will say there is nothing wrong with dented cans, but I prefer undented cans.  I have read many reviews regarding dented cans from Amazon, but do not know if Amazon gets them dented, therefore can sell them for less. They were still wrapped individually so would appear they were packed dented.

review/summary: Wonderful
review/text: I bought mine at a store- so I knew it was honey FLAVORED with lavender essence. I read the ingredients- which are also listed right here on Amazon.  If you like that lavender flavor you will love this.  It's quite clearly supposed to taste like lavender, NOT be a lavender honey derived from lavender flowers.  IT's quite unfair for that negative reviewer to get mad at this product because he or she did not read the ingredients.  This is absolute perfection for what it is- and it's quite clearly listed in the ingredients what this is.  So if that sounds good to you, that is what you will get.  I eat mine on toast and pancakes and cheese.  I think it would be lovely over ice cream, cream puffs and profiteroles, but I have not tried that yet.

review/summary: stale and little bacon
review/text: This was my first purchase of this brand of dog cookies. I cook everything my dogs eat so I am always looking for things to keep in the pantry that are human grade ingredients and made in the USA to help me out when I am short on time. My Papillon is severely  allergic to flaxseed, soy, oats, brewers yeast and chicken which rules out most commercial foods and cookies. I was very disappointed in how stale these were and skimpy with the bacon bits. Call me crazy but I did a taste test like I do on my homemade dog cookies made with human grade ingredients. The expiration date was still a year away but without preservatives these have a much shorter shelf life than that. I store homemade dog cookies in the fridge or freezer to preserve quality but was hoping the claim of "made fresh daily" on the cute bag was true. My dogs and I give these "Four Paws Down".

They are small but that way they last longer for them.  My dogs love the flavor of them and will take as many as I hand out.  They are fresh and the packaging on these is cute.  I gave one bag as a gift to a friend and it was well liked.

I will continue to buy these for my dogs for as long as they make them.

review/summary: Doesn't Get Any Better Than This...
review/text: I'm originally from Chicago so I had access to many different products from different cultures.  I've missed having that in my backyard for the last 20+ years, but it's amazing what you can find on the Internet.<br /><br />I mainly love date syrup with Tahini or cream cheese and have tried several brands but this one is absolutely the best.  Made in Iraq too which is why it's so good.  Now if I can only find Tahini that's made in Iraq too, I'll be set.  You can't go wrong with this date syrup in my opinion.<br /><br />The only thing with it being canned is that once you open it, you'll have to dump it in a jar.  It's an easy-to-open can with a pull-tab so no can opener needed.

review/text: I was a little skeptical when I saw this at the local WF store, but picked up a 6-pack to put the product to the test. Boy howdy, did Zevia get this one right! It's a delicious approximation of it's Mountain Dew source of inspiration. It has a crisp feel to the body, rather than what I perceive as MD's thick/oily feel. Definitely a stronger hint of grapefruit in this citrus mix. An all-around lovely drink.<br /><br />At the time of this review, the product was not available from Amazon.

review/text: I bought this at my local Whole Foods and loved it. I got the last can, or else I would have gone back to the store to get a dozen.  Slightly tart, citric, thirst-quenching flavor, decent caffeine kick, no spiced plum undertones (yeah I think the cola has a little of that--not terrible just not quite what you expect), and perfect over ice.  This tastes as good as Mountain Dew, but more natural.

review/summary: Now I love it....
review/text: I bought a case of this via Amazon, having never tried it before. Frankly, the first Zevia Mountain I had was just so-so to my palate. I need to state that I have had a 15 year addiction to Diet Mt. Dew, and probably 5 years of regular Mt. Dew before that. I do not think it tastes like Mt. Dew. With all that said, I also know that all tastes are learned. I once again was committing to letting go of Diet Mt. Dew as I know that the aspartame is no good for me, just as a smoker knows cigarettes are no good for them. Knowing that doesn't make it easy, it just makes it important to do anyway.<br /><br /> So, I drank another one a few days later. Then, I drank another one a few days after that. Hmmm....it seemed much better to me! It still does not taste like Mt. Dew, IMHO, but now that I seem to have the Diet Mt. Dew out of my system, I have grown to love this! I just ordered another case, and the best thing of all is that I can now honestly state for the first time in YEARS that I am not and have not been craving Diet Mt. Dew (which I preferred to Mt. Dew, as I believe aspartame is very addictive - I have had a harder time breaking this addiction than quitting smoking years ago or even giving up white sugar and flour products, and other refined grains!). This has been such a relief to me (I got several migraines every month, craved carbs while drinking Diet Mt. Dew, and still could not let it go!) No migraines in a month now with Zevia Mountain, my carb cravings are actually gone, also, and I have dropped five pounds! Nothing else has changed in my diet or activities to attribute these shifts to.<br /><br />And the best part is that my tastes acclimated to this much healthier drink and I truly enjoy it! I just got a few other flavors at the local health food store for my husband to try, as he did not care for the Mountain (but he doesn't care for the citrus flavor and was not the avid Mt. Dew drinker that I was). It's nice to be able to have a soda that does not spike insulin, nor have other potential health issues (such as many have with aspartame). I love it!

review/text: I found Mountain Zevia undrinkable.  I purchased it as a 6-pack when it was on sale.  I like the Zevia Cola and figured I'd try this since I love Mt Dew, Sprite, Squirt but this stuff is nasty.  I couldn't finish one can and am throwing the rest away.  So far the only Zevia drinks that I've liked have been the Root Beer and the Cola.

review/summary: Only when I'm desperate
review/text: Diet Mountain Dew has been my diet drink of choice for years now, but I've always been weary of the aspartame in it.  Noticed Mountain Zevia and was hoping it would be a new alternative as I use Stevia-based sweetners on a regular basis now for coffee and tea.  Unfortunately, this has a long way to go to be an acceptable alternative to Diet Dew.  It's a very offputting taste, almost peppery and not nearly as smooth as Dew.  I have also tried regular cola Zevia and noticed the same issues.  I tried with ice and without ice and while ice made it somewhat more palatable, it was still not enjoyable to me.<br /><br />There is a lot of erythritol which is a sugar alcohol and may have something to do with the different flavor.  I would love to see a combination of stevia with a small amount of real sugar which would add negligible calories but could perhaps add the kick of flavor needed.

When I found out Zevia came out with a Mountain Dew like soda I was thrilled.  Though I was a little disappointed that it didn't taste exactly like Mountain Dew.  However even though it tastes different I still love the flavor of Mountain Zevia.
