review/summary: Hard to chew and short-lived flavor
review/text: We purchased this product to re-fill our gumball machine and were generally disappointed by how hard the gum was and how short-lived the flavor was, compared to other refill products we had purchased in the past.  Although we liked the price at the time, in retrospect, the purchase did not represent a good value.

review/summary: Great Filling
review/text: I have one of those little gumball machines and got these to fill it.  I can tell there are different flavors though the flavors aren't very defined.  Still tasty enough for kids and most adults to enjoy!  And if you take a few at a time you can get some good bubbles out of it.

review/text: The double bubble gumball refill 53 oz jar was all in all great.  There were a couple things the dubble bubble folks could improve on.  My machine was empty and when I opour this into my machine it cam up to just above half.  I had to buy another 53 oz Jar to completely fill the machine.<br /><br /> The flavor runs out a little to fast on the balls.  Other then that great product!!

review/summary: Money Savings Advise!!!
review/text: Just save your money and time, and just don't buy. The pictured jar of filled to the rim gumballs was not what arrived in the mail. The jar I received was filled just above the Dubble Bubble Gumball sticker. This distortion of the truth has led me to doubt my beliefs, that a picture is worth a thousands words. Don't get me wrong, it was a 53oz jar, but half full is half full. I plan to take the advise of other viewers and take my business to Wal-mart. I would advise others to do the same, especially when reputable companies use misleading photos to swindle us out of our hard earned money. And for the record, if there was a way to rate this less than one star, I would rate it a negative ten.

review/summary: Good Gumballs..Poor Value
review/text: Thank you to the reviewers who mentioned that these gumballs are way overpriced on Amazon and suggested buying them at Walmart. I purchased them for less than half the price. My son is having a gumball themed birthday party, and I need a lot of gumballs. These jars are not as big as I had hoped they would be, so I'm glad to save what I can. By the way, these are half the size of the big gumballs you see in the big gumball machines. These are perfect for the small gumball machines for party favors, etc.

review/text: The label on the packaging says "8 fruitastic flavors" but there aren't any fruit flavors here. The initial (very) subtle flavor of the colored shell is gone after just a few bites, and then all that's left is the generic "gum" flavor.<br /><br />Every piece literally just tastes like confectioners sugar. No flavor variation at all. If you want fruity, check out a different brand.

review/summary: Wrong Description- Not Space Gems.
review/text: Topps recently discontinued the Star Gazer Grape and the Bubble Gum/Cotton Candy Ring Pops. Plus, they are now Kosher. So, I was excited to see that someone still had the old flavors in stock. But, when they came to me, I opened the box and saw right away that they were not the Space Gems. The containers were filled w\ the new flavors and packaging.<br />Space Gems had specific flavors and looked like a moon rock. The flavors were, Grape, Cherry, Lemonade and a few others.<br /><br />I wrote Topps and they confirmed what I already knew.<br />I decided to return the product and get a refund.<br /><br />I suggest you change the description and picture of your products. The 2 ring pops in your photo are the space gems, but are now discontinued.<br />I think they are now called Ring Pops Fruit Fest.<br />The package came right on time and I would have kept them, if they were the Space Gems.

review/summary: A fan since it's inception
review/text: My experience with this mac and cheese goes as far back as since it was introduced. I worked at a food coop while in college and we use to order directly from Annie herself. One day she (Ann Whithey) AND BERNIE (unfortunately he was in a cage in back of the van) pulled up to deliver our order. I can't say I remember her as a person since it was more than 20 years ago. I have also met<br />Mollie Katzen of Moosewood Restaurant and cookbook fame while managing a whole foods and natural foods supermarket.<br /><br />I can say however, that my wife and I thoroughly enjoy the Alfredo version to the point we've ordered it at least a dozen times at a dozen boxes at a time. We've experimented a whole lot with it and if you haven't added any steamed brocolli to the cooked mac and cheese we both highly suggest you give it a try. It adds flavor (especially when fresh brocolli is in season), extends the number of servings for a modest price, and might even help those who wrote about sodium levels.

review/summary: no more diarrhea!
review/text: I adopted my 4 1/2 year-old brown tabby, a little more than a month ago. According to his medical history from the shelter, he'd had frequent diarrhea and they gave him deworming medicine which apparently made him throw up and still didn't fix the problem. They told me the problem will soon go away since he had been just treated, so i didn't worry about it too much and took him home with me.<br /><br />The very next day, he had a very runny stool with dark blood spots at the end! Being a first time cat owner, I got scared and took him to the vet and she said his fecal exam result showed nothing out of ordinary and blood in stool is common for cats.I thought it would go away since I was starting to feed him good quality food, but it didn't.<br />I kept seeing blood and loose stools in his litter box and whenever he had normal poop occasionally, I would get very happy since it didn't happen so often. Oh, and he was one gassy cat!<br /><br />I did my research and tried to put him on a raw diet but being a student, I just couldn't afford the time and the money. I heard canned food is better than dry, so I got him all-natural premium canned food but it didn't solve the problem.<br />I have to admit he didn't seem to like it at first. He LOVED the previous food, but he just sniffed at the new food and walked away. It took him a couple days to get used to eating it. It's been about a week and no more diarrhea!! He's had healthy, normal poop for a week and I haven't detected any gas from him!! I still give him the same canned food, but he mostly eats the Natural Balance dry food. He doesn't go crazy over it but he seems pretty content with it, so I can't complain! It's a big, I mean BIG, relief!

review/summary: It works!
review/text: I have to admit up front that it has only been a week since my two cats have started eating this food exclusively.  I don't want to jinx it, but this food is amazing.  I have a 9-year old and a 13-year old, both with extremely sensitive stomachs and can never find food that works for both of them.  I've tried the super high-end natural food which was way too rich and greasy.  I've also tried the low- to mid-range food like Science Diet, Iams, Nutro, and Purina...all sensitive stomach formulas, all with the same result - puke everywhere.<br /><br />After trips to the vet, multiple food changes, trying wet food only diets, considering raw diets, I finally came upon Natural Balance Chicken and Pea formula.  It was on sale at Petco, and so I got a small bag thinking if it didn't work, at least it wasn't an expensive waste.  I was skeptical, but hopeful.  Day 1, no puke.  Day 2, no puke.  Days 3, 4, 5...NO PUKE!  I can't begin to tell you what a difference it has made!  The best part is that they both WANT to eat this food.  They will meow when their bowl is empty and get excited when they hear the kibbles hit the bowl.<br /><br />If you have kitties with sensitive stomachs and feel like you've tried everything, I really recommend giving this a shot.  It's very reasonably priced, has NO grains and is made for cats with allergies and sensitivies to fillers.  Give it a try!

review/summary: only food she will eat
review/text: My cat was adopted from Humane Society as an adult. She demonstrated signs of allergies by excessive grooming that created red bare  spots.  I moved her to a limited ingredient diet on suggestion of my vet, and it does seem to help. She has fewer times when she engages in this excessive grooming, and her fur is in much better condition. A major plus is that she will eat this food. I had tried previously to move her to other cat foods, including Blue Buffalo and Wellness Core without success.  She has been on this food for about two years and is just back from her annual check up with good marks for her health.

We have tried many high dollar foods and all types of sensitive stomach foods. After reading good reviews for this food I decided to go ahead and give it a try. No more loose stools within 2 days!!!! If only we had tried this product earlier. It is also important to me that my pet's food doesn't have corn fillers in it which this food doesn't. Science Diet lists it as one of the main ingredients in most, if not all, of it's foods. This product has been miracle for our baby!

This was one of the few foods I could find without any of those things & decided to give it a try. It has worked FABULOUSLY.<br /><br />Her allergies have disappeared, her fur has grown in soft & thick and I've even noticed a reduction in the stink of her poo.

review/summary: My cats do not like it
review/text: We just moved, and can no longer buy the trader joe's cat food our two cats love. I ordered this because of the great reviews and healthy ingredients, hoping it would help one cat's health. (He recently had an overnight stay in a vet's office because of tummy issues.)<br /><br />Well, the first time I put it in their dishes, both cats just sniffed it and walked away. Later, one cat would take one in his mouth,then spit it out on the floor. These are cats who eat everything (including things they shouldn't) and get VERY excited for breakfast. Eventually, they stopped even walking toward their dishes when I poured more food in. One cat was barely eating anything. The other one (with tummy issues) suddenly became more interested in eating leaves tracked in the house. Finally, I broke down and bought them <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PJQWLQ">Purina One Indoor Advantage Cat Food, Hairball and Healthy Weight Formula, 7-Pound Bag</a> at the store and they LOVE it. Plus the first ingredient is chicken (not chicken meal or by-product), not green peas. Right now they're eating half natural balance and half purina one, until they use up the bag.<br /><br />I'm sure this is great healthy food, if your cats will eat it. I did notice that they have very healthy looking stools in the ole litter box when eating it (Gross, but important, I know. The things we do for our cats!)<br /><br />Hope this helps another person who really loves her cats.

review/summary: Good alternative!
review/text: One of my cats had food allergy. He vomited once to twice a week so my vet suggested to feed him Hill's Prescription Diet d/d - Duck & Green Pea Dry Food. It helped! My cat stopped vomiting but it didn't help my wallet!  That particular dry food is extremely pricey (3.5 lbs for $24. Yikes!!)  So I had to look for alternative.  Nature Balance Green Pea & Duck is a great replacement and much cheaper (although not as cheap as I hope but I accept the fact that premium food cost more).  The only downside is that it is not available in the stores near my house. Although it is convenient to order online but still, I like to be able to pick it up in the local store.

review/text: This cat food was recommended by my vet for my slightly overweight, indoor kitty.  She's now hooked on it & turns up her nose at other food, even the same brand canned.  I had been buying it from my vet but it was a little pricy.  So glad Amazon carries it at a good price & has free shipping.  Takes most of the work out of feeding kitty.

review/summary: Amazing cat food!
review/text: My 10 year old tabby (Buttons) had started developing some serious skin issues. Her fur was thinning, she had scabs all over and she had a pretty gnarly case of dandruff. She was also throwing up in random places throughout the house. I found out she had allergies, we aren't sure to what exactly but decided to change her food. After spending hours researching and reading reviews online I decided on the Natural Balance Limited Ingredient food. Buttons had never had duck formula cat food so I decided to try it.<br />Its only been three weeks and the difference is remarkable! My 10 year old cat is running amok like a kitten again. She has more vigor, has stopped vomiting and is back to chattering at me and looking for attention. Her whole personality has went from crabby and subdued to kitten-tastic, purr machine ball of fun. Her scabs are healing, she's no longer constantly itching, her eyes are clear and her cat box isn't a disaster area any longer. Not to mention, she gobbles up the food. I noticed that she doesn't eat as much as well.<br />Bottom line: I have my cat back!

review/summary: My cat is doing great on this food
review/text: He had developed allergies to something and just became miserable. The litter box was awful, his coat was falling out, constant gas and just began to look droopy, bumps on his stomach. I knew a trip to the vet would cost a lot so I decided after reading about this food to give it a try and it has been a true cat and money saver. He scarfed it down right away and the improvement started right away but now after a few months, he is super cat. His coat is gorgeous and the litter box has no smell I mean none and is much more solid. He never has gas now and always wants to play. It saved my cat from whatever was tearing at him and saved my wallet, after doing some quick math I made a trip to the cat toy section and gave him his cut.<br /><br />This has really turned out to be a great product for me and my cat.

review/text: My cat is a bit picky so I can say if he likes this, I would imagine most cats would like this. My problem is trying to find a food that he likes that doesn't make him have loose stools. Well, this isn't one of them. I gave four stars because he likes it and he doesn't vommit this stuff back up. Some foods he would eat, he would not tolerate well. This one he does just fine. But, the stool is the issue. Oh, and his diet is strictly dry food for your reference.

review/text: My cat suffers from a very very sensitive stomach. For months, she went though episodes of vomiting and diarrhea. We took her to the vet and tried different "sensitive stomach" foods, but nothing helped. This seems to be the only food that she can eat that will not bother her. She loves the taste of the food, she has stopped vomiting, no more diarrhea, and her coat is very shiny. The price is a bit steep, but it is a quality cat food. I would recommend this.

review/text: I was paying $70 for feline ZD. The last draw was when the vet told me I would have to bring the cat in for a physical in order to renew the prescription (it had been a year). So now, in order to continue paying for ridiculously priced cat food, I would have to spend an additional $60 office visit to get the prescription. Did some internet research and found this food. My cat has been on it for a a couple months and no allergic reactions. Her face use to swell and get puffy from normal cat food. So happy to be saving so much money, only wish I had done it sooner!

review/summary: Tainted food, Nov-Dec 2011
review/text: I was a big fan of Natural Balance because of the grain free formula, small kibble pieces, and competetive price.  That was until my cat became sick for a week and a $350 vet bill to determine the problem was this bag of kibble.  It was easy for the vet to diagnose: I changed my cat's food out on Monday.  By Tuesday, she was showing signs of nausea (non-social, lethargy, eating sparingly, licking her lips a lot).  On Thursday, I took her to the vet.  The vet said she had a fever and was nauseated.  She recommended I swap out the food which I did that day.  By Friday, she was showing signs of improvement, and by Saturday, she was back to her energetic self.  If you are like me and are willing to buy quality food because you love your cat, please avoid this formula.

review/text: I have been a fan of Celestial Seasonings products for many years.  I have tried many of Celestial Seasonings teas and this one is one of my favorites.<br /><br />I like this tea both hot and cold.  As a hot tea the honey chamomile blends into a very soothing drink.  I enjoy honey chamomile on cold evenings or when I have had a hard day.  I keep the pot on and have several cups while I relax.<br /><br />As a cold tea it is refreshing yet soothing.  It is a great drink to sip during conversations or when reading a good book.<br /><br />This is a healthy product.  The tea is caffeine free, contains no sugar or carbohydrates.  It is sodium free and has zero calories.<br />Many Celestial Seasonings teas are herbal teas that are free of artificial ingredients.  Finally, Celestial Seasonings teas comes in a box of six that is at least $2.75 cheaper than in the grocery store.<br /><br />I highly recommend Honey Vanilla Chamomile Tea

review/text: This tea is the best! I put Splenda in my regular tea, but nothing at all in this one, because it has a very mildly sweet flavor, and no bitterness at all. When I was recently very sick, I made huge mugs of this tea, and didn't drink much else. It really helped! I don't detect an orange flavor, though, and was just surprised to see it on the ingredient list. I bet every batch comes out a little different, anyway. It doesn't make you sleepy, but it won't keep you from sleeping at all. Try it!

Although they call it "honey vanilla" chamomile, the orange peel dominates the taste, but this is not a bad thing (if you like orange ;-). Good packaging and competitive pricing (especially when compared to Twinings) as well.

I usually prepare an oversized mug of it with 2 tea bags, a to-taste amount of clover honey, and a packet of sugar in the raw. It's wonderful! I also sometimes use the same method with one bag of this tea and one bag of Celestial Seasonings' Vanilla Tea. That's also a soothing and relaxing blend. I desperately wanted to find a brand and flavor of tea that I would truly enjoy and after many, many purchases--this is it! This comes with my highest recommendations!

review/summary: A nice change from straight chamomile
review/text: I keep pure chamomile flowers on hand because I love the flavor and aroma of a soothing cup of warm chamomile tea*. But occasionally I have a hankering for something a bit mellower, and rather than adding honey to my chamomile brew, I turn to Celestial Seasonings Honey Vanilla Chamomile. It has a lightly sweet flavor, but has no added sweetener. I brew it in a teamaker for 2.5 minutes at 175�, then drain the infusion into a serving vessel. From there, I can pour it into my cup in small quantities, where it quickly cools to the perfect, pleasantly warm drinking temperature. It's a waste to drink it hot. When the tea is warm, it takes on a creamy mouth feel that greatly adds to its already smooth character. This is just delightful stuff.<br /><br />*(Note to pedants: Yes...I know that technically it's a "tisane", and that "tea" is Camellia sinensis.)

review/text: I used to drink chamomile tea back when I was child and just needed something to settle my stomach. The blended teas of today just don't match that wonderful tea of yesteryear. However, my wife loves the honey, vanilla, chamomile combo. Like other teas we've grown to enjoy, this one is getting increasingly harder to find. Since I was ready to reorder my Stash brand Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, it made sense to buy this at the same time. Surprisingly, even though both were ordered at the same time, this came separately even though both are being sold & shipped by Amazon. I am still waiting for the Stash tea.

review/text: My 4 month old LOVES squash and she started out with Gerber. But then I found that EB sells them in a pack of 12 for $11, while Gerber sells them in a pack of 8 for $10. EB is organic and comes in neat recyclable/reusable jars. Gerber's is not organic and comes in cheap flimsy plastic containers that aren't even worth saving. Guess which one I bought. EB, and she still loves it!<br />-Mother Goose

review/text: My little one has liked this one from the start; 7 months now and ordering the second box. The size is good too, as 2.5 onces of squash is about right.<br /><br />There have been complaints of Earth's Best carrying BPA in thier lids, but this is in all jarred baby food (due to the canning process) and does not make it's way into the food itself. All in all nutricious safe and yummy!

review/summary: Great taste and good nutrition
review/text: I feed both my kids Earth's Best brand baby/toddler food when I am unable to prepare food myself.  All flavors have a short list of ingredients, good flavor and a nice nutrition profile.<br /><br />I usually wrap these jars in a ziplock bag with a baby spoon and stash in the diaper bag for wholesome food on the go.  I like to feed my toddler what my husband or I eat, but it is great having a back-up if she is really not hip to the entree.<br /><br />Earths Best is the next best thing to mom's cooking ;)<br /><br />Off label use:<br />If you are out of oil when making baked goods, like pumpkin muffins, you can add a jar of complimentary flavored baby food in a pinch and they will still come out moist! Happy accidents are worth sharing!

review/summary: not like the real thing
review/text: I usually make my own baby food but for convenience I tried a number of these when I went travelling and although she would eat them, (she basically eats anything), she didn't gobble them up like fresh proper food.  I tasted them and they really aren't that nice.  She also started  get diaper rash for the first time ever, every time I fed her these, and it cleared up every time I stopped.<br /><br />Basically they are good if you have no alternative, but nothing beats homemade.  They taste kind of nasty and processed and the kid could tell.  Plus a lot of the nutrients will have been processed out if them in the canning process,  so not the best thing to feed your child long term generally.  Making your food and freezing it isn't so much hassle.

review/text: Wanted my daughter to keep organic as much and long as possible so we tried this brand first & this veggie when she started solids.  I thought it smelled kinda gross at first but from the first spoonfull (& it's not so runny it won't stay on a spatula style spoon) she loved it!<br /><br />She'll eat a jar of this even after a full bottle if I let her!  No side effects noticed and I even tasted it & found it bland but wholesome.<br /><br />This is a great deal and cheaper than in store; arrives bubblewrapped to death and no weird or broken jars so far.

review/summary: thank goodness for Earth' Best!
review/text: Earth's Best was the only company that I found that makes stage one organic squash. I insist on feeding the baby organic and wanted to make sure she had veggie options for stage one. Thank goodness for Earth's Best. There are lots of stage one fruits but few veggie options when it comes to organic so finding squash was a big deal.  Also, only one store (Babies R Us) sells stage one squash around here. The two grocery stores I shop carry Earth Best, but the options are limited.<br /><br />As far as the squash goes, no complaints! I like the fact that all Earth's Best foods are organic so I don't have to worry about looking at the label for the organic tag. I just wish they were less expensive or in bigger containers like Gerber organics.

review/summary: Very good water but not the best
review/text: The best water for tea is not heavily mineralized, orderless, and crisp. Crisp (vs flat) means to have disolved oxygen - which is more likely if cold and not repeated reboiled. Tap water is not acceptable due to typically being chlorinated and deoxygenated (filtering will likely not help). Some people prefer the taste of highly mineralized water (such as Tucson's tap water). And so, the two best selling brands (Pepsi Aquafina and Coca-Cola Dasani) are just straight from the tap. Coca-Cola even adds salts to help create that perfect tap flavor. But, salts can produce negative interactions with tea. Water for tea should ideally be pH neutral (7). My son feels a neutral pH is most important - but I normally drink tea with lemon juice ... and so a high pH might actually be better for the low pH of lemons. Did a blind test taste with friends and found the one water everyone liked least (always below Tucson's hard tap water) was Costco's Kirkland brand while the most popular was Fiji.<br /><br />Well recognized waters that tea experts around the globe agree are ideally suited for making exceptional tea include (in order of my preference):<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004T7YQFK">Highland Spring Non Carbonated Spring Water, 50.7-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a> (United Kingdom)<br />Best deal at half the price of others (pH 7.8)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013T5YO4">FIJI Natural Artesian Water, 50-Ounce bottle (Pack of 12)</a> (Fuji) Best tasting (pH 7.5)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTIPAU">Crystal Geyser Spring Sport, 33.8-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a> (United States pH 7.9)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00267A38Y">Volvic Natural Spring Water, 500ml- Bottles (Pack of 24)</a> (France pH 7.0)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ANW7HQ">Nutriteam Countertop Water Distiller Stainless, Glass Collection</a><br />Don't use water immediately to allow for disolving of oxygen

Further, the advertised picture of this product shows a different water sport cap which is why I purchased the water online - I truly needed that style sport cap as advertised for my special needs situation at home.  I had been searching everywhere for it to no avail and was extremely happy to have found them so I thougt in Amazon.com only to be disappointed.  I have kept the purchase bc of the assumed expenses in returning such an item. I will never order this or any other product like it meaning liquidfied items from Amazon.com again.

review/summary: A very decent coffee
review/text: I cannot claim to be a coffee connoisseur, seeing as I normally drink instant, hotel packets that people tend to leave for me for some odd reason, or wally world brands, but this is a very decent coffee.  Very smooth going down, with very little of the bitterness that typically plagues what I've been used to drinking.<br /><br />My only complaint is I'm not used to this much flavor.  It really hangs around for a good while after finishing the cup, too.<br /><br />Obligatory Halfway Through Bag Edit: Having given myself some time to get used to this coffee and let my taste buds settle down from a cold, I do have to say there is a non-insignificant burnt smell/taste going on. While I'd still consider this a pretty good coffee, this means next time I will be trying a different brand.

review/summary: A step up from teabags
review/text: The tea is definitely a step up from regular tea that you get from your grocery store packed in teabags. There was almost no "dust" of broken leaves in the tea. But, it is packaged poorly, the tea seems to be overfermented or burnt. Although they say the tea originated from China, it does not have characteristic taste, it was either lost or was never present there, I am not sure. The tins are covered with plastic, but on three of the six tins the plastic burst, because it was just too thin and fragile. The tea is placed in unsealed plastic bags inside the tins. In the description it says something about the tins being collectible, and it is a joke. They all too thin to keep their shape and arrived bent.

review/text: You won't find a leaner package of ground buffalo for your grill. I make each 1 lb package into two patties and sprinkle salt, pepper, and then press minced garlic and freshly ground horseradish into both sides then grill them over a charcoal fire, turning every 3 minutes. I like them medium rare so I only turn them 3 times. Best burger you'll ever have. Great in chili also but don't brown first, just crumble raw meat into the rest of your prepared stock and cook "slow and low".

review/summary: Lovely smoke flavor
review/text: Hi, I just wanna say I found this liquid smoke to be great.  It gave me exactly what I was looking for--that natural smoky flavor.  If you want to know, I didn't find it tasting synthetic or artificial.  It tastes very natural because it is natural.<br /><br />The only catch is you need to calibrate your quantity when using this product.  I recommend starting off conservative and adding more as you go.  If you put too much to start with, you may ruin your dish.  For a stew or chili, you can probably fix it by just adding more ingredients to make a bigger pot to reduce the smoke concentration.  Don't pour it directly on something your grilling.  Pour it into a small bowl or dish and brush it on evenly and lightly.  You can always brush on more as you grill.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a wonderful product and I recommend it highly.  I will be buying more once my 4oz bottle runs out.<br /><br />I hope my review has been helpful.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Scott

review/summary: Average product, cheap manufacturer
review/text: The flavor of this product is so-so. You may prefer Wright's which in my opinion has a more intense smoke flavor.<br />The Colgin with its added vinegar has more tartness than the Wright's. Colgins has several added ingredients beyond just "liquid smoke". Wright's is just pure liquid smoke. However, sometimes I'm out of my preferred brand and can't find Wright's so I buy Colgin instead. Recently I purchased some and one of the bottles was missing the flip-top dispenser that the product label said it had. I wrote to the manufacturer to let them know. They acknowledged a production error. They offered to send me a flip-top in the mail. I told them never mind because I would just use the non-defective bottle first and reuse the top when the bottle was empty. I said I wouldn't mind if they sent me a coupon though. They wrote back and said "unfortunately the Manufacturer doesn't send out coupons, I do apologize for any inconveniences. Thank you for using Colgin Liquid Smoke!" That seems to be a little short-sighted in the consumer relations department in my opinion. Most manufacturers I've ever contacted with a product problem have bent over backwards to satisfy the customer e.g. sending you a coupon for a free replacement.

review/text: I've always been a fan of that smokey flavor, but never got around to getting myself a bottle of liquid smoke. It really adds a lot of flavor to pretty much anything you cook it with. First I was told that I should only use a drop. However, the serving size is like a teaspoon or something to that effect. I use about 5 drops in a steak marinade for one steak and it really brings out the smokey flavor of the grill. I put it in with some potatos and fried them up and it was amazing. It adds a nice toasty taste to an endless number of dishes, and I recommend it to anyone why is not afraid of savory flavors.

Because of the great quality of this item I doubt I will go back to crushed flowers, this is so much more decadent!Oh, and I forgot to share the packaging, these are definately something you would be proud in giving as a gift as they are packaged in a large clear tub as to not squish or harm the flowers.

review/summary: Great Bamboo; ok vase.
review/text: The quality of the bamboo was very good.  The vase that was sent only partially resembled the picture on the website.  It was the same shape but was a lighter green, with little to no glazed sheen.  There was also no detail on the vase (the picture has a leaf sculpted onto the side of the vase).  The vase was definitely of a lower quality than what is pictured.  A good value but a little disappointing based on the picture.  You can understand that the vases will vary but to be such a substantial change in appearance from the picture is disappointing.

review/summary: Misleading product info
review/text: I ordered this item having read that the item weight was 3.5 pounds and the shipping weight was 4.5 pounds. I did read that there were 48ct in the box. So I paid my 12.99 with free shipping (other items brought me to the $25). When I got the box- tiny- it was a 17.28 ounces no where near what it claimed. So I got my money back. Be warned this box is only a little over a pound.

review/text: The box arrived open - not sealed. I wasn't sure if there were 48 pieces but preferred not to  count them either.  The candy was delicious but it seemed odd to have the box in such bad shape that when I opened the mailing container the candy was spilled out everywhere.
