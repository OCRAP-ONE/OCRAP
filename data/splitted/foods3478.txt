review/summary: Pretty good!
review/text: This is relatively tasty!  The color was nice, and it's zero calories.  You can definitely tell it's a "diet" beverage, and there is no guide for how to mix it - it only says 1 squirt per 8 ounces.  But it's about the fastest drink you can make, and there's no grit at the bottom like with some powdered drinks.  I would definitely try other flavors!

review/summary: A convenient alternative to Crystal Light
review/text: I've seen the catchy commercials for MIO, so was happy to try it out, and sweet tea seemed like a worthy flavor. The marketing idea of a "water enhancer" is pretty slick.<br /><br />Pros: It's easier to make a drink with something like this vs. those little tubs of powder that Crystal Light offers. While CL has more flavors, MIO is more easily portable and is easier to adjust, in terms of how much you actually add to the drink. It's convenient,<br /><br />Cons: Sure, it's not as healthy as just plain water. (Including vitamins or other healthy options in MIO might be a great way for them to get around this in the future.)<br /><br />All in all, fun to try - if you want to drink more fluids, but don't love drinking 8 glasses of water a day, this would be an easy and tasty alternative.

review/summary: Hope you're not wearing white
review/text: Got this stuff because the wife was interested in it.  BLUF, don't bother with it.  The directions say to use a few drops per xx ounces and I couldn't even taste it when I did that.  The second time I tried squeezing some into my glass it shot out at about a 45 degree angle all over my counter, narrowly missing my shirt sleeve.  FAIL!  After suiting up into a rubber protective suit and goggles, I managed to direct some of the liquid fun into my cup finally and it was a mediocre letdown.  I don't know what the people have been drinking that gave this stuff good reviews, but I rate it one step above pond water.

review/summary: Better than expected!!
review/text: I am so glad that I decided to try the MIO liquid. This stuff tastes great and very handy for travel. I have been hesitant to try the MIO because it is a little more expensive than other types of water enhancers but this is definetly worth it. I love that I can control how strong I want my "tea" to taste and I get a lot of use out of one bottle. This product is very quick and easy to use especially if you are on the go. It's great how MIO is liquid so I don't have to worry about powder residue in my drink. I always hate the gritty residue that the powder leaves in my drink and in my mouth after the fact. The bottle is small but remember it has enough water enhancer in it to make 24 servings.<br /><br />I am very happy with this product and I will be trying other flavors of MIO as well.<br /><br />**This product does have added dye in the ingredients so please be aware of that if you are allergic to dyes.**

review/text: Mio Liquid is a water enhancer.  I've tried many water enhancers and some I like and some I don't.  Mio Liquid I like.  With no powder, it's more consistent when you blend your water.  No more powder residue at the bottom of the bottle or glass.  Also, if you flavor isn't quite to your taste after a few drops, you can drop in more to suit you.  The sweet tea is really good.  It's sweetened just right to my taste and doesn't leave any aftertaste. A really good product!

review/text: The entire family enjoys these.  They give good flavor for those times you want something besides water.  I would rather not have artificial sweeteners & additives but sometimes water just doesn't satisfy.  I do like that you can add as little or as much as you want.  I tend to waste the powdered additives or add it to a LOT more water while hubby prefers his drinks sweeter.  It's tasty and has a good tea flavor, slightly artificial tasting but to be expected.  Would definitely buy again.

review/summary: Tastes Great - Less Filling!
review/text: Overall this is a great idea that is well executed.<br /><br />From a convenience factor, it doesn't get any better than this (ok, another beer reference, can't help it).  To have a little squeeze bottle that can turn a glass of water (or bottle of water) of any size into an instant drink is amazing.  It reminds me of being a kid an adding food color to liquid, except this liquid includes the flavor!<br /><br />The tea flavor is great considering it is sugar free.  It is exactly what I expected and hoped for; a nice sweet tea flavor that does NOT try to get fancy with any extra junk (no ginseng / etc ... this isn't some baloney "energy drink" - it is just good plain old sweet tea).<br /><br />I'm a big fan of the little crystal packets, but this product exceeds those in that you don't have to open up a packet every time, you can adjust the amount of flavoring depending on the size of the drink and your preferences, and it mixes even easier than crystals.<br /><br />The ONLY negative to me is that the advertised quantity of "24 servings" that a bottle makes seems to be more like "10 servings" based on my flavor preference and using 16 oz bottles.  Still not a bad value, but 24 servings would taste like sweet tea that was full of ice that has melted ... not strong enough.<br /><br />But overall this is a great product - highly recommended!  Now if they could only have something that can make instant beer ....

review/summary: Artificial sweetener aftertaste aside, a good sugar-free sweet tea alternative
review/text: "MIO Sweet Tea, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)" is a good sugar-free sweet tea alternative. In fact, IMO its far better tasting than the other MIO flavors I have tried. My biggest gripe with MIO is not the flavors themselves, which are actually pretty good, but the unmistakable artificial sweetener aftertaste that lingers after every swig. Even the sweet tea flavor does not avoid this, but it is somewhat more tolerable than the other flavors I have tried.<br /><br />Gripes aside, it's pretty good for what it is. At $13, the price is certainly good, as you get nearly 100 servings between all four bottles. In all, recommended.

review/summary: Great tasting Sweet Tea item!
review/text: I am a BIG fan of MiO... I buy these and mix them with 16.9 bottles of water INSTEAD of drinking sodas.  The taste is awesome, and I actually look forward to drinking it.  I put two squeezes into a bottle, and I'm ready to go.  The cool thing about MiO is that one small 'bottle' usually lasts me a week.  So I'm saving money by not buying sodas (which are $1.50 each), and saving calories at the same time.  The package is nice and small.... fits comfortably into my small soda bag.  I also take it into restaurants and order water instead of a soda.<br /><br />I usually buy Grape and Berry, but Amazon gave me a chance to try Sweet Tea... and this one is also a winner.  The SWEET TEA flavor is exactly what it's supposed to be:  a Sweet Tea-tasting flavor.  I enjoyed it so much, I'm going to start buying it.  Now... it doesn't taste EXACTLY like Tea, but there's enough of a flavor there to bring you the sensation and feeling of drinking a Sweet Tea without the calories.  And that's the whole idea. If you like it sweeter... just add more MiO!<br /><br />As a previous user of PROPEL... I like MiO much better.  And to use up the horrible tasting PROPEL ZEROs I had left... I just put a squeeze of MiO into it, and make them taste good.  I was really enjoying the two flavors I've tried so far, but I'm going to have to add Sweet Tea flavor now.  Sweet Tea hits it out of the park for me, so I highly recommend it.

review/summary: One of the better MIOs I've tried
review/text: I absolutely love Mio Berry Pomegranate and Fruit Punch, but hate Peach Mango. I was a little iffy on trying the Sweet Tea, but I really liked it. My only problem with it is that I like my iced tea stronger, so I end up using more Mio than I usually do and go through it more quickly. Besides that, I really enjoy the taste and will buy it again.

review/summary: MIO got me off sweet tea!
review/text: I actually discovered MIO months ago when it was on display at a store. Reluctantly I tried it, knowing my caffeinated/sugar induced addiction to McDonald's Sweet Tea was slowly swallowing me like a black hole, haha. I've tried other imitation tea liquids and powders over the years but nothing came close. MIO was definitely different. It gives you a solid tea flavor, but without that slight afterbite that drinkers of really strong tea may experience. I began drinking it daily in place of regular tea. Though I did have caffeine withdrawals at first, the change was actually an easy one to make because the MIO flavor was so similar to real sweet tea. And the great thing was that I could change the strength of the flavor to my liking with as few or as many squirts as I liked. Now I am caffeine/sugar free and I've even lost about ten pounds.<br /><br />One final word-I've tried the berry MIO. Did't care for it at all. But, that may just be my own tastes. I'm not trying to negatively affect this review, but I felt it important to note that not every MIO flavor may be as great as the tea.

review/summary: Doesn't taste like tea
review/text: PACKAGING<br />When I got this in the mail, some sort of seal had broken and it had leaked in the box. So if you're planning on keeping it loose in your pocket or purse, maybe keep it in a plastic baggie to make sure it doesn't leak all over the place. I do like that this one package makes approx 24 glasses - seems much easier than carrying around several packets to get you through a day if you like to add the little flavor thingies to your water. But if the package leaks...not good.<br /><br />TASTE<br />This stuff doesn't taste BAD, but it doesn't really taste GOOD, either. And definitely not like sweet tea. If I had to force it, it maaaaybe taste like a crappy version of canned Nestea-type tea. I put 2 squirts in a glass of ice water and had to add a third to make it string enough. If you get other, fruity flavors, you could probably use as much as you want (to get a hint of fruit flavor in your water) - but for tea, you really need it to be fairly strong or it just tastes like gross, watery tea. Also, I think fruit flavors would probably still taste OK at room temperature but the tea flavor didn't.

review/text: If you want a substitute for the powdered stuff and prefer a liquid then this is for you. It is certainly convenient to just make one glass and add more of it to get the taste you want. I must have a crazy sweet tooth because I had to squirt quite a bit this stuff to get the right amount of sweetness.  It tastes great and similar to McDonalds sweet tea or Arizona Southern Style sweet tea which is my absolute favorite.

review/summary: Absolutely artificial. But it tastes good.
review/text: I have a hard time understanding who this product is for. My best guess is that it's somebody who wants to appear healthy and "drinks water" but doesn't actually like the flavorless quality of water. Like bottled flavored water beverages, this product adds flavor with no calories.<br /><br />But in the process, it adds chemical ingredients to your water. Propylene glycol, sucralose (artificial sweetener) and acesulfame potassium (also noted as a sweetener). I'm not saying any of these, in the quantities ingested using this product, are bad...but it seems odd to me to take water and add something to it that contains chemicals.<br /><br />The benefit is that you get flavoring without any calories. Does this product taste like "sweet tea"? Yes, it does. I've been using it for over a week about once a day, and I would say it tastes like sweet tea. However, I've noticed a mild "alcohol" scent from it (probably the popylene glycol). The scent is very similar to that of any "extract" you probably have in your baking cabinet, like vanilla extract.<br /><br />The flavor is sweet without being incredibly artificial, due to no real sugar being in the product. The color is dead-on "tea" -- it's the right shade of brown, and just like tea, if you want more flavor and squeeze more of this into your water, it will get darker. It's an interesting concept.<br /><br />So what you end up with is a sweet-tea-flavored water...which lacks all of the benefits of actually drinking tea. Tea, after all, is healthy for you. There's no caffeine in this product and no sugar, so it doesn't offer any type of energy boost.<br /><br />It's artificial in every sense of the word.<br /><br />Personally, this isn't something I would use long-term. It has a good flavor and is convenient (small enough to keep in my desk drawer at work), but it doesn't quite fit into my overall nutrition goals. I would rather reach for a bottle of diet iced-tea before using this as a substitute.

review/summary: Easy to use & sweet tasting
review/text: So easy to use! You just get a glass of water, or a bottle of water if you're on the go, squirt in your desired amount of MIO and your water is transformed into sweet tea! That easy! You can adjust the amount of flavor you want by adding more MIO to your water for a stronger flavor, I have found that I need one squirt and about � of another squirt for my tall Coke glasses that I have at home. If you're like me water can be a very boring drink to drink but you really don't want to drink high fructose corn syrup so for me MIO is a great way to make water more enjoyable.<br /><br />This is the second type of MIO that I have tried, Peach Mango was the first type, and if I adjust the taste to what I enjoy I find it to be just as great as any sweet tea I could have made from scratch at home. For example Lipton sweet tea is one of my favorites, but prices are a little high for me and it takes time to make a batch. Plus who has time to wait for your tea to get super cold without diluting it down with a ton of ice cubes? I don't! MIO comes in handy just when I need, on the go, when I'm in hurry, and when I just want something that is not water. I don't find the taste to overpowering in lemon flavor or too sweet since I can adjust to what I like.<br /><br />The amount of times I can use 1 container (about 25-28 depends on how many squirts you use) makes MIO an affordable substitution to some other brands. I am very thrilled with MIO and would recommend giving it a try. Plus now that I have tried two flavors , that I have both enjoyed, it just makes we want to try more so that  every time I drink water I can have a different type of MIO.

review/summary: MIO vs the lemon slice
review/text: Tap water is a funny thing and it's not a generic taste that we might otherwise expect. Cross into a neighboring city and you can imagine a dead carp sucked hard against the grate on the city's water intake and flavoring every glass of water. Eat in a restaurant down the road and you might imagine the water originating from someone's swimming pool.  In another place, the water well might be too deep and has struck some brimstone ring of Dante's inferno. Water is not a generic taste.<br /><br />Airport water by the bottle is perhaps a higher profit per margin/gram then cocaine. I buy one bottle of airport water just past TSA (if I forget taking and empty from home) and refill the bottle from drinking fountains for the entire round trip. In a blind taste test, I believe I can identify the airport by the taste of the water.<br /><br />Some have taken to adding a slice of lemon in the tap water to `normalize' the taste. This MIO concentrate is far more effective. A drop or two will titrate the water into a common, generic and appealing taste experience.<br /><br />It works. It's an expensive water treatment but not nearly as expensive in the long run as paying the enormous sums for the truly generic taste of refined, distilled Dasani and the like temptation.<br /><br />MIO is a far better value for your travel $ then the airport water vendor looters.

review/summary: My daughter loves it......and I don't.
review/text: I have never tried Mio but my daughter had tried the Pomegranate flavored one which she liked but thought it was quite strong.  We received the Sweet Tea flavor and my daughter tried it in her bottled water.  My daughter absolutely LOVED it!  She thought it was much better than the previous flavor she tried.  It supposed to last 24 servings (a serving size is 1/2 tsp).  I suppose depending on how strong you like your tea how long those 24 servings would last.  It says that you use one squeeze for 8oz of water.  It has -0- calories, it does NOT need refrigeration but says that for best quality use within 1 month of opening.<br /><br />The Mio is sweetened by sucralose and acesulfame potassium (as per label).<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />I tried the Mio...and I've tasted sweet tea but this tastes terrible.  Perhaps I like lemon tea because this doesn't taste like sweet tea I've had.  My daughter still loves it though....

review/summary: A delicious treat
review/text: Well, since some other user decided they'd paste their review on to each flavor allow me to give my short but sweet review:<br /><br />MiO is delicious. I like that I can just put in the tiniest of splashes in my drink and just have a hint of flavor... or splash a lot in and get a real flavorful experience. It's a quick and easy thing to use. It's also fun to watch it splash into the water. I've also found it's good to flavor different types of alcohol.<br /><br />In regards to the criticism by other reviewers for it containing propylene glycol - don't be in a panic like them. propylene glycol is harmless unless ingest massive quantities of it. Using a canard like "it's considered harmful to pets so humans shouldn't ingest it!" is just alarmist behavior. Chocolate is harmful to dogs. Better not eat that then!<br /><br />Lastly, in regards to it having so many "food colorings" - well, if you don't like anything that flavors your water to have anything artificial in it, squeeze a lemon into it. Put a dash of sugar. Or just drink the water plain. You know what you're getting into when you buy this stuff.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is my new favorite drink flavoring. I will be buying from them again and again.

Well, it does work for me so far. All i need in my water is just a hint of flavor. Nothing too overpowering. A tiny squirt gets the job done. A little taste goes a long way for me. Would have been better without the added coloring though. Will be getting another MIO in mango peach when this current supply runs out. No nasty aftertaste for me.<br /><br />The only bummer that i encountered with this shipment was the bottles of MIO were leaking despite them being sealed in their individual plastic wrapper. I had to wash them off before stashing them away in my locker. No way will i want to carry them around in my pocket or bag.

And with regards to additives it's your choice as a consumer as to whether you are going to consume it or not.  Personally I'll take my chances because I'm an adult and I can make my own decisions.

review/summary: Well worth the money; better tasting than Crystal Light & similar powders.
review/text: I tried MIO because it was on sale locally. I chose the sweet tea flavor because I knew that flavor would be easy to compare to other no-calorie powdered drinks. I am a big fan of the Walmart version of Crystal Light (Walmart's is less expensive and better tasting than CL).<br /><br />The delivery method is a great idea. You can adjust the amount depending on the glass size or your mood, it can go into a water bottle just as easy, it's convenient to carry, great for camping, at the office or whenever you don't want to make a whole pitcher of drink mix or don't like the taste of your tap water.<br /><br />The flavor is FANTASTIC. Better than any sugared or non-sugared powder mix! The cost for such a small bottle seems expensive, but it is super concentrated, excellent flavor, you'll drink more water than ever before, well worth the price when you compare it to bottled water or other drinks.

review/summary: Oh Mio Myo You. Whatever Shall We Do?
review/text: "Liquid water enhancer." I suppose that is a better advertising term than "artificially sweetened, flavored soft drink mix." The latter is more informative, though. Mio uses natural flavorings and Sucralose for sweetening. (Sucralose is sold under the brand name Splenda.) Actually, in minute quantities, Sucralose is not bad as an artificial sweetener. Ever since cyclamates were banned as sweeteners in the U.S. in 1970, I have been searching for a sugar substitute that does not have a long-lingering, unpleasant aftertaste. Sucralose is the best I've found so far.<br />Mio rates the calorie count as zero. Mathematically, based on the rules of rounding, they can get away with that statement. Since there is under one tenth of a calorie per serving, it is close to zero, but not actually zero. You would probably become sick if you consumed enough of the product to reach one calorie.<br />To achieve the maximum rating of 24 servings per container, you would need to use only 1/2 teaspoon of Mio per glass. I have found 1/2 teaspoon to 8 ounces of water is sufficient to appreciate Mio's flavoring, but I find this concentration to be too sweet. Adding 4 - 5 ice cubes seems to curb the sweetness. Using more water dilutes the flavor. You will need to experiment to find the right ratio for your own personal taste; I provide this insight as a starting point.<br />Although these little "bottles" of Mio are convenient to carry around with you, they are rather expensive. I find some of the powdered, instant teas available on the market to be just as good and a lot more affordable.

review/summary: It's OK
review/text: This is the 2nd Mio product I've tried and I must say that it is a little dissapointing.  There are no guidelines as to what quantity would provide the optimal taste; I suppose that the concept it is "season to taste" product.  If you want your beverage to taste more like a weak flavored water, use less--if you want a more pronounced taste use more.  I found in my trials that a few drops are too little, and a squirt can be too much.  I like my drinks to taste like someting, so I've used more.  The sweetness is a bit overpowering; but using less results in a weak drink that I found unpalatable.  I suppose this product is best for those who want tepid tasting flavored water, in that case a few drops would suffice and a bottle would last quite a while.  I found it to be very artificial tasting and not as good as those drink pouches you put in a bottle of water.  The only really good thing about it is that since it is a liquid, it dissolves readily in your bottled water whether the water is room temperature or cold.  So I'd say this product is not for me; but those wanting someting less sweet than your average diet drink mix might find it appealing.

It mixes up nicely since its already a liquid.<br /><br />I know some commented on the concern of certain ingredients in Mi0.  Frankly I dont think its a bit issue.  People drink soda by the gallons, this is a lot better then soda.<br /><br />This is like anything and drink it in moderation.  I have several bottles of water a day of water, but I just use 1 with my favorite Mi0 mix.<br />Wonderful drink.<br /><br />Its a bit pricy, I am not to sure why.  Even in stores (in my area) ranges from the mid $3.00.

review/text: Very happy with this purchase. Everytime I try to buy it in the store, it's always sold otu, Especially the Sweet Tea flavor. Price is good, not anymore expensive than when I purchase it in the store. Love to use this when I go to restarants, just order a glass of water and add this. Save $ and calories. This is a great product for people who have diabetes or are trying to cut back on calories. Would definitely recommend this.

review/text: I have tried several different Mio products, I also live in the south where sweet tea is a staple. I wouldn't say this is like tradional sweet tea but it does have a pleasant taste and is easy to carry with you. the package seems small but it does go along way. A great addition to any water bottle.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I really, really wanted to like this product as I think it's a great idea, but I just didn't like the taste. I love sweet tea and was really looking forward to loving this product, so was very disappointed. I tried it in a bottle of water, then twice in a glass with more, then less water. Tried adding more of the liquid to the water, but could never get it to taste like sweet tea. It tasted like chemicals and was undrinkable. Couldn't add it by the drop, as it was hard to squeeze the bottle, then it squirted out and you couldn't really control the amount. Had someone else try it as well, and they had the same problem. They also didn't like the taste. Sorry that this doesn't work, as it's a great idea.

review/summary: Innovative and tasty--but tricky
review/text: MiO is an interesting new twist on drink mixes--in fact, it doesn't even call itself a "drink mix" (a phrase that probably evokes images of chalky powder and overly sweetened fruit-flavored drinks); technically, it's a "liquid water enhancer." You use MiO by squeezing the desired amount into your water (according to the directions, "one squeeze for each 8 fl. oz. serving). The dispenser design is practically flawless--MiO won't start dispensing until you forcefully squeeze the bottle, so there's no danger of accidentally pouring too much into your water. There is, however, the danger that you won't be able to accurately measure one "squeeze"--exactly how long does one "squeeze" last? How much MiO should I add for the flavor I want? You've just got to figure this one out by trial and error. It didn't take me too long to judge how much MiO I should add to my 20 oz. bottle of water (2.5 "squeezes"), and the resulting beverage was quite tasty indeed (although it *was* artificially flavored). I find MiO a lot more convenient than those individual powder drink sticks, but it takes a few tries to get the hang of it.

review/summary: It's even better than I expected
review/text: My wife first brought home a... umm... bottle?  Container?  Squirt dropper thingy?.. of MIO a few months ago; a strawberry-watermelon flavor, if memory serves me, and I enjoyed it tremendously.  Always looking for something to drink that's not just water but rarely having a container of something in the fridge -- at least not for very long -- I was personally growing tired of powdery drink mixes and the mess they would make.  The measuring dirtied spoons and measuring cups, and frequently there was powder still at the bottom of the glass when I'd finished, making the last gulp seem as though I'd just swallowed syrup.<br /><br />These MIO packages change all that.  When you gently squeeze the container, a concentrated squirt of drink mix neatly goes into your glass, and after a sip or two, you'll know exactly how many squirts will make the perfect strength drink for you.  I find that I don't even need to stir any more than a brisk oscellation of my glass.  The squirt nozzle is very accurate, and nothing gets dirty.<br /><br />I'm more of a fan of the Lipton lemon iced tea flavor than the "sweet tea" flavor that's now so popular at fast food chains (my wife loves sweet tea like that, and like this MIO flavor), but I find that in the right squirt count, the flavor of this product is extremely similar to those products.<br /><br />And like the commercial on TV, this packaging is very portable, and I've had no issues with drippage from the bottle.  Lastly, and I think this is truee with all flavors, MIO liquids are caffeine-free, carbohydrate and suger-free, and calorie-free based on an 8-ounce glass.<br /><br />I would recommend that you try a MIO, but BEFORE YOU BUY ONE at the store or on Amazon, you might want to do a Google-search or check out the MIO Facebook page because I understand you can order a FREE SAMPLE from them to try it out first.  My apologies for the caps... just wanted to make sure you saw that before you place anything in your shopping cart.  :^)

review/summary: Cough Syrup
review/text: This is the second MiO product I've used. I haven't considered either with the highest regards but they do make a convenient emergency beverage enhancer. MiO comes in hadny 1.62 ounce packs, easy to carry and simple to use. If you're thirsty but don't feel like drinking plain old boring water then just give MiO a squirt. A quick shot for a little splash of flavor or a long squeeze for a stronger flavor. The problem is that a small dose of MiO Sweet Tea tastes like murky water. And a strong dose tastes like cough syrup. There are much better MiO products than Sweet Tea. If you can get past the taste though MiO is a really great product. Easy and convenient, you can get plenty out of each container. It's better than carrying around a bunch of those Crystal Light singles packets for sure.

review/summary: A portable sweet tea that tastes pretty good
review/text: If you've never lived or visited the South, there is a common drink available in all restaurants here- sweet tea.  It consists of iced tea that is brewed with copious amounts of sugar.  If you're from another region of the country and visit, you'll typically order iced tea and gag when you drink it, because you will not expect the amount of sweetness you taste.  Even sweetened Nestea or other name brand products availble bottled don't have the same amount of sugar.  Once you get used to it however, it's actually a pretty good summertime drink.  And to me, real sugar is better than the chemicals found in most soft drinks, diet or regular.  They just feel much heavier in my stomach.<br /><br />All that out of the way, I was surprised at how close this approximates sweet tea while using artificial sweetener.  It tastes like sweet tea, but manages to find the middle ground between real sweet tea's flavor without the sometimes (to me) strong chemical tastes found in diet drinks.  The color used actually helps determine how much is needed to make it taste like the real thing.  Too light and there is hardly any taste at all.  Overall, a smart little product idea and a good way to vary up your water intake.

review/summary: You ought to try this - it's good.
review/text: I bought a few of these Mio "water enhancers" to try. They are small bottles of artificially sweetened concentrate that you squirt into a water bottle or add to a glass of water. It only takes about a half teaspoon to flavor a glass of water so each bottle will make about 20 - 24 servings. I got a couple of the fruity ones as well as the Sweet Tea flavor. The fruity ones taste too artificial and chemical-y to me but I found the Sweet Tea flavor to be really good. To each his/her own - I like it, my wife doesn't. These are perfect to keep in your desk drawer at the office or to take traveling. Give the Sweet Tea flavor a try, skip the fruity ones. I don't think you'll be disappointed.

review/text: When I received my container of Mio Sweet Tea water enhancer, I opened the envelop and the container had been cracked during shipping. When I pulled it out of the padded envelope, the Mio fluid got on my hands. I couldn't get the dye off my hands after washing them twice! This prompted me to check the ingredients, where I then saw it was full of dyes and chemicals:<br /><br />Water, Malic Acid, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, Citric Acid, Sucrolose & ACESULFAME potassium, potassium citrate, RED 40, POLYSORBATE 60, and POTASSIUM SORBATE (preservative).<br /><br />OK people, you can make a tea concentrate using these crazy ingredients called TEA LEAVES & a sweetener! Why all these freak ingredients?<br /><br />I had to try it so I could write a fair review... it tasted like it's ingredients: mysterious chemicals. This was no enhancer, but really a "water detractor".<br /><br />Stay away from this Franken-Tea unless you crave bizarre chemicals & dyes.

review/summary: Contains Chinese Meds For Thrombosis Cardiovascular Diseases!
review/text: I would not worry about the other ingredients everyone seems concerned about. but you should worry about this:<br /><br />Acesulfame K is 180-200 times sweeter than sucrose (table sugar) and has not been fully studied. It is believed to be carcinogenic. More studies are needed.<br />Since this is so sweet and leaves nasty bitter aftertaste Kraft Foods invented a way to help mask the bitterness by getting a patent on this drug Sodium ferulate which is in this drink. Sodium ferulate (SF), the sodium salt of ferulic acid, is a drug used in traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and to prevent thrombosis.<br /><br />Save yourself the worry and nasty taste. Go out and get a sack of sugar and box of tea bags for the same price and enjoy it that much more. At least real tea is safe and has health benefits and is full of antioxidants.

review/summary: Seriously disappointed!
review/text: I've been curious about these little bottles for a while now, since water can sometimes get a bit boring and I try to avoid soda. When I saw the opportunity to try them as a Vine member, I was excited!<br /><br />They're definitely convenient little objects, and if you really wanted to, you could fit one in your purse to carry with you. The way it works is you're supposed to squeeze in a drop at a time until you've reached the flavor you want. Firstly, there are no drops. I had to squeeze the thing with a kung fu grip before anything came out, and when it did, it shot out in a little jet stream. I tried a couple of times, but couldn't get it to just drip. That said, it takes far more than a few drops to get any flavor! I ended up putting in a teaspoon or so before the color was finally tea-like and there was some sort of flavor. The flavor was seriously watered down, like a super weak glass of iced tea.<br /><br />Both my cousin and I tried the sweet tea MIO, and we were both rather disgusted by the flavor. Hopefully the other flavors are better!

review/summary: This MIO not for me-o
review/text: I like tea, and thought that maybe this would be something great to jazz up my bottled water at work. As I put the drops in the bottle, I was a little surprised at how vividly colored this stuff is; I'm sure colorless liquid would be less exciting but this tiny bottle of flavoring packs a TON of color!<br /><br />The flavor effect fell flat; I could not add enough to get the flavor I expected, it just got sweeter and sweeter, to the point of being unable to drink it. I would like to suggest to the MIO maker that if they just took out the higher concentration of color and replaced that with a higher percentage of flavoring, that would go a long way in improving this product. It has an aftertaste that is even more pronounced than Crystal Light, and another side effect that is not refreshing. After dumping my bottle, I then had to get another bottle of plain water to wash the weird icky feeling out of my mouth. My mouth felt like I'd imagine Astroglide would act if you drank it; it had this weird slippery aftereffect and my mouth felt like it just wasn't hydrated with the water, as if I needed to keep on drinking. Bleh!<br /><br />Not a purchase or even a recommendation for me.

I got my 4 bottles from Amazon... opened one bottle, squirted some into a tall glass of ice cold water and could not wait... well... EEKKKKK... so gross. It tasted like pure sugar water with a weird aftertaste, squirted some more and finally got the "hint" of tea taste...  You have to squirt A LOT to even taste a hint of tea and when the main ingredients are chemicals (excluding water of course) it tastes like what it is.. A CHEMICAL. I immediately put the bottle back into the box from Amazon, along with the 3 unopened bottles and tossed them in the garbage. While I hated to spend $12+ of my money for NOTHING.. it's my fault, I should have done reviews FIRST. Here's just one I found: [...]<br /><br />The cute bottle and the 0 calories in the commercials were enough to entice me and I am sure this product will make millions from idiots like me who fell for this, but trust me people, SAVE YOUR MONEY. I don't write much reviews, but I just had to come on here because I am trying to go green and avoid as many chemicals as I can for my own body and home and this is just one big giant chemical hidden in a cute bottle with a great commercial. Look up the ingredients, which are NOT on Amazon and do your own research.  Pour a glass of water, squeeze some lemons and add stevia for some lemonade with no chemicals.... Or brew some tea bags, put in pitcher, refrigerate, add stevia for some sweet tea... it will be better for you and taste better than this crap. Lesson learned... Now choose for yourself, if you buy it... remember I warned you ;)

review/summary: Great item for traveling overseas
review/text: One of our disappointments in traveling last year to Costa Rica--and other countries over the years--was the absence of iced tea. Sorry folks---we've been hooked on iced tea for 50 years! Anyway, we don't drink wine or beer, and water/carbonated beverages got old in the tropics. In Germany, for three years we longed for having iced tea with our schnitzel! This year we tried taking a few small bottles of MIO in Peach Tea and Sweet Tea flavors. Outstanding! Made a LOT of difference, whether at meals or just drinking bottled water. Advantage over powdered flavorings is that you can adjust the strength of the mixture a squirt at a time. (What would you do with a glass of water, but with an envelope of powdered flavoring for a quart of water?) And, for those concerned about passing airport security,  these contain only 1.6oz.  Use 'em at the office for drinks during the day. Very convenient.

It has just the right mix of tea taste and sweetness.  I drink diet drinks sometimes so I don't have an aversion to a little aftertaste, but I really can't make one out with any of the flavors I have tried.  I have since purchased another flavor after testing these and would recommend if you think water is "boring" but need to get your ounces in.  I would definitely recommend to others.

review/summary: Better than Crystal Light....
review/text: For those looking for a review, and not a debate on additives that are good for us:<br /><br />I have to say I really enjoy MiO.  I posted my review on the Sweet Tea flavor because out of all the ones I've tried, I like it the best.  I'm a big fan of sweet tea, and when I'm out and about and can't make my own, this is a great substitute.  It is easy to change the amount to your taste (I often like a weaker flavor, just enough to help the water go down).<br /><br />In my opinion this product is superior to most of the dry products on the market today - a lot because it is so easy to change the concentration, and how portable it is.  I was a fan of the crystal light singles for a while, but a lot of their flavors were way too strong for me.  This solves it all, and I can get 24+ drinks out of every bottle!

review/summary: Great Idea, but Too Much Aftertaste
review/text: In theory, Mio is a great idea.  The bottles look cool, and offer a chance to drink water without, you know, having it taste like water.<br /><br />In practice, unfortunately, I prefer water to Mio's sweet tea flavor.  Your taste may vary, particularly if you are a big fan of lemony sweet tea, but this didn't work for me.  It's a challenge to come up with a sugar free drink as sweet as sweet tea that still tastes natural.  This definitely has some caramel-y tea flavor, but the strongest flavor is probably lemon, followed by a chemical "artificial sweetener" aftertaste.<br /><br />IMHO, this is worth a try if you love sweet tea, but I wouldn't invest in a package of four until you were sure you liked it.

review/summary: Nothing special
review/text: This is all right as something to add just a small amount of flavor to water if you really can't stand plain water. It has a fairly strong chemical edge to its flavor, though. It's nice in that the little bottle lends itself well to being able to add however much you want compared to the little packets of powdered flavoring made by other companies that you can't reseal.<br /><br />On the whole, the flavor of the sweet tea version just isn't to the point where I could see myself deliberately seeking this out over other flavoring options.

review/text: I've used MIO products before.  I was so excited to see a sweet tea option but I cannot get the correct amount squeezed in to make my water taste anything but nasty.<br /><br />I've tried the suggested serving amount and I've used trial and error.  I'm more apt to drink the more watered down experiments as there is a horrible after taste when using too much of the sweet tea.<br /><br />I would purchase this if I could actually get the correct mixture to taste anywhere near sweet tea.

review/summary: A Science Experiment
review/text: I thought the concept of this was awesome.  The packaging seemed prefect for portability; small with a spill-free pop-top.  It is available in nine flavors - Berry Pomegranate, Sweet Tea, Peach Tea, Mango Peach, Orange Tangerine, Fruit Punch, Strawberry Watermelon, Black Cherry and Green Thunder.  Just a squirt or 2 and I would have favor-enhanced water on the go.<br /><br />The reality was slightly different.  Although the packaging is small, the spill-free pop-top LEAKS.  I received the Sweet Tea flavor to sample.  The flavor was very inconsistent - sometimes a squirt would be enough for an 8 oz. glass; other times 2 or more squirts were needed.  It was almost like a science experiment (LOL).  Often I would have to pour it out and start over; once I had added too much the taste would be overwhelmed with an artificial chemical-like sweetener taste. YUCK!!!!!

review/summary: 1/2 tsp = a serving; use within a month of opening; no refrigeration required
review/text: Ice tea is my preferred beverage. I can't seem to get the flavor right using MIO Sweet Tea. One squirt is not enough in a glass of water, yet 2 squirts doesn't taste that good; 3 squirts are too much.<br /><br />What I've noticed with MIO products is that some people really like them & others can't stand them. I suggest if you want to try MIO flavorings, that you buy a single container at your local store before buying in bulk on Amazon.<br /><br />The MIO containers are fantastic & very portable. The liquid won't spill out of the container unless it's squeezed. The lid clicks into place (click it twice to lock it).  It does not need refrigeration & it's recommended to use it within a month of opening.

review/summary: Tastes okay if you make it a bit strong
review/text: Out of the MIO flavors I've tried, the mango peach is my favorite.<br /><br />This one is okay but if you just add a squirt to 8 ounces of water,it tastes a bit weak, 2 squirts to 12 ounces worked out best for flavor for me. Any more and the chemical sweetness leaves a strong aftertaste, any less and it's just too weak to really taste tea.<br /><br />It's a fantastic concept, but chemical sweeteners almost always have a bitter aftertaste for me. My teens like it a lot though, and are drinking more liquids because of having it on hand. The alternate between plain water, fruit juice.<br /><br />I still prefer tea made from scratch at home, but this is a very convenient product.

review/summary: Not real impressed.
review/text: DISCLAIMER: Although this was given to me through Vine to review, unlike other questionable "reviewers", I actually take the time to USE the product or READ the book. So whatever score/review the product gets, it's absolutely earned. At no time is a product given a particular review or rating simply because I fear loosing Vine status. That's not how the Vine program operates.<br /><br />Anyhoo, onto the review:<br /><br />I generally try to be as thorough as possible with my reviews, but seeing as this is a drink mix, there's not much that can be said. :)<br /><br />But, I did try the MIO Sweet Tea out (several times actually....used the whole bottle) and while it's definitely a great idea (able to take with you in a pocket or purse), the flavoring on this particular item just wasn't very good. I've had other MIO product, namely the fruity flavors) and those were actually pretty darn good. But honestly, this tea doesn't taste very good. To my tongue anyway. It's kind of like pouring a bunch of Sweet&Low into processed tea you get in cans from the grocery store. It leaves a weird after-taste, as well.<br /><br />Everyone's taste is different, so my opinion certainly may not reflect the product characteristic as a whole, but it's definitely got kind of a weird flavor to it.

review/summary: Definitely did not taste like tea!
review/text: I drink a lot of iced tea and was hoping this would be a quick way to make a glass if I run out of the bottled tea. Instead I am not even sure what this tastes like but it definitely does not taste like any kind of tea that I am used to. And it doesn't have a good sweet taste, it is more like an odd tasting sweetener. I also drink diet soda (both Pepsi and Coke) and this does not taste like any diet soda that I have tried. Overall a really poor imitation of something as I can't say it is an imitation of tea since it is not even close to tasting like tea.<br /><br />I made one glass, took a few sips, added more MIO, tried it again then spit it out and dumped the rest down the drain and threw the MIO away. It tasted that bad that no way was I going to drink this stuff.<br /><br />The other issue is that this MiO has propylene glycol and nothing of value. No real juice, no vitamins, actually nothing but some unnamed artificial flavors. Perhaps one of the other MiO flavors might have tasted better but I'm not going to try them as I would not want to waste my money. I'll stick with the bottled brand name teas.

review/summary: Pleasant tasting, super simple preparation
review/text: I'd seen Kraft MiO Liquid Water Enhancers in supermarkets near Kraft Crystal Light and similar powdered beverage mixes, but didn't try it until receiving a sample container of the Sweet Tea flavor. While I've long known that it's supposed to be good to drink 8 glasses of water a day (and apparently it is; e.g., see Anahad O'Connor's NY Times article titled, "Really? The Claim: Drink Eight Glasses of Water a Day to Protect the Kidneys"), it wasn't until my daughter emphasized and re-emphasized this to me and encouraged me to use Crystal Light if necessary (for taste) that I began to really make it a point to drink that much water daily. Now that I've tasted MiO, I will definitely use that to flavor water as well. I wish I'd known about MiO before recently being on the road for 6 weeks, because it would've been so convenient. I can also see using it in eating establishments to flavor water (instead of drinking plain water or using a sweetener and a lemon wedge, if available, to flavor the water). The MiO container easily fits in a purse, pack or pocket. I tested the sample container I received for leakage by shaking it vigorously when closed, then carrying it in a winter jacket pocket where I carry keys and sometimes an eyeglasses case for a day of activity including driving, and there was no leakage at all.<br /><br />MiO needs no refrigeration but Kraft recommends that open containers be consumed within 30 days after being opened. At present, MiO comes in six flavors (none of which contain caffeine or sugar or have calories), and Kraft says they plan to introduce more. The other flavors, in addition to the Sweet Tea, are: Berry Pomegranate, Fruit Punch, Mango Peach, Peach Tea and Strawberry Watermelon. I think I'll try Berry Pomegranate next.

review/summary: Not bad...even though it doesn't taste like sweet tea
review/text: I now have tasted about a half a dozen of these "flavor enhancers" by MIO and for the most part I have been very, very impressed.  This low to no calorie drink is a great way to give water an extra boost of flavor.  However, this "sweet tea" flavor befuddles me a bit.  The reason being is it doesn't really taste like sweet tea.  I sort of taste the tea aspect and I sort of taste a sweeten aspect, yet they don't seem to blend together to create "sweet tea". I tried MIO's peach tea flavor enhancer and that tasted just like peach tea.  So again, I am a bit befuddled.  I will say that the flavor is pleasant and it is nice to drink, but I don't see any conduit between the taste and the flavor proclaimed on the bottle.

review/text: If you like sweet tea, as I do, but you either (a)don't like calories or (b)live far, far away from the parts of the country where sweet tea is a given in any restaurant or at home, then this is a very nice alternative to going without until the next time you end up South of the Mason-Dixon line.<br /><br />MIO Sweet Tea comes in a cute little plastic teardrop container, which holds at least 20 glasses' worth of tea concentrate. (More glasses of tea for me, and fewer for my Beloved Husband, who generally likes his tea double strength) The plastic container is fairly liquid-tight, and doesn't leak when I carry it in my purse.  However, a single bottle that was mailed to me leaked a couple of drops in the envelope.<br /><br />This sweet tea is quite tasty, in my opinion.  However, I come from New England, and never even tasted sweet tea until I was in my thirties.  Those who were raised on sweet tea, had it in their baby bottles, and expect delicious and perfectly prepared sweet tea might not find it as palatable as I do. (I felt compelled to add that disclaimer, because I went to restaurants with Southern friends who told me that the sweet tea in a particular establishment was terrible when I found it quite tasty)<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: At first this didn't taste like anything.  By time I added enough Mio to taste something, I was then disgusted by the flavor.  I like tea, truly I do.  This is not tea.  But I've found a few ways to describe this flavor:<br /><br />Sucking on brown saccharine?<br /><br />Chewing on stale aspirin?<br /><br />Someone dropped a cigarette butt in my water?<br /><br />Sweaty gym socks were wrung out in my glass?<br /><br />Someone left used motor oil on the bottom of my glass?<br /><br />This  drink is a great idea but a terrible rendering of such.  My teenager wanted to try it and I'm tempted to do a science experiment on him.  We call him Big Foot and I'm wondering if it would stop the growth of said feet.  I don't want him to stop growing taller (6'2" now) so I wonder if I sprinkle it directly on his feet, if that would work?  I'll get back to you.<br /><br />I keep trying to figure out how people like this.  I've finally figured it out and I have a message for them:  WATER is not spelled V.O.D.K.A

review/summary: Extremely Disappointed In This Product
review/text: I saw the commercials and though that this would be something great to try, something to add flavor to water and sugar free. I should have realized that sugar free means artificial sweeteners. Going off of the ads, I added some MIO to a glass of water. Of course I could barely taste anything so I added more. I couldn't tell that it was sweet tea. All I could taste was those nasty artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />I tried different amounts and numerous glassed of water thinking that it might be that I put too much or too little in the water. None of it helped. It was so bad that my stomach was rolling after attempting a couple glasses. Now, a different flavor might be more for me. But after this experience, I think I'm just going to not ever think about buying any more.<br /><br />I'm sure if you like Crystal Light and other diet drinks you will enjoy this. Personally, I think the headaches I get from horrible artificial sweeteners is a good sign to stay away from MIO. I'm glad that I got this for free from the Vine Program or I would have been upset to have wasted my money.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.

review/text: This liquid water enhancer doesn't really taste much like sweet tea to me. If you really want sweetened iced tea without calories, it'd be far better (and cheaper) to make the real stuff and just add a packet of splenda, which is the sweetener in this MIO product.<br /><br />However, if you just want a quick convenient no-calorie flavor added to water, and you don't really care if it tastes like real tea, this will do. I thought it was too sweet in the concentration they suggest, but if I add less, it tastes diluted. You'll have to play with it to get the concentration you like.

I like to be able to add as much as I want and only have to carry a bottle of water and my drops to have the perfect drink every time. I found the prices on Amazon were not cheaper than going to the store. I buy about 10 a month and always have left over so I feel good buy since they can last as long as you want pending on how much you put in each time. With the other single serve powders you either have to put the whole amount in or use what you want and hope the powder does not spill out since there is no way to close the packet. I will continue to buy Mio and drink happily

Studies have shown that aspartame increases the chances of cancer, possibly raising your blood sugar...there are many who steer clear of aspartame, though i am not one of them. I really like the Mio Strawberry watermelon, that one has really great flavor. What i like about the MIO over crystal light is, sometimes when you make drinks using crystal light, it takes a few minutes for all the powder in the crystal light to dissolve, and it you don't wait, you might get small chunks of powder which is really gross. with the MIO this is not an issue. it instantly dilutes into the water and you do not have to shake it violently or wait.

I believe products meant for consumption should be well packaged and made as airtight as possible. Since the Mio was already leaking out, i felt it was not safe to use it, cause who knows what had "leaked in". Makers of food items should take time to make sure the products are well sealed.

review/summary: Mostly vile.
review/text: My entire extended family tried this stuff, and we all agreed: This tasted like concentrated Splenda (sucralose) and dish soap mixed into a glass of water. It has a terrible aftertaste, and a none-too-pleasant flavor. It tastes nothing like sweet tea, and made me yearn for some Nestea powder instead.<br /><br />Honestly, I'd prefer just plain water to this chemical-laden stuff. This was like sweet tea made with chlorine instead of sugar.<br /><br />This will definitely help you if you're on a diet, because the flavor will put you off drinking anything for a while. It's possibly one of the worst-tasting things I've ever put in my mouth, and I've lived a pretty full, experimental life!<br /><br />The bottle was thrown away 1/4 used. We're never trying this again.

review/text: Hard to believe that this little MIO dispenser can make 24 servings of sweet tea but it does.  It is nice to make the tea as strong or weak as you like with the drops you add and convenient to squeeze into a water bottle opening.  It is caffeine free and sugar free which makes it guilt-free as well!  Easy to carry in a purse, backpack or car glove box.  Great for traveling.

I enjoyed the taste and I guess I am a little spoiled but I do like my sweet tea probably a little sweeter. Drinking the southern style sweet tea is probably not good due to all the sugar but I did find that adding a little stevia to this brought it up to where I felt it needed to be.

review/summary: Sweet Tea by the drop
review/text: By now most sweet drink consumers are familiar with the various on the go packets of flavor powder than can be dumped into a water bottle or cup in order to provide the drinker with a cup of something more than water. Powder drink offerings do tend to have some specific drawbacks, however.  They can be messy to use, hard to mix in to your drink with out some serious stirring or shaking, and they most often are only available in single use pouches.  Onto the scene enter MIO liquid flavorings.<br /><br />These cute little palm sized containers featured a highly concentrated liquid flavoring rather than powder, and can be used multiple times, allowing the user to judge the amount of flavor in their particular beverage.  Very handy idea, I admit.  It's nice to have a liquid that mixes easily with the water, and the ability to adjust the amount is very appealing (those old powder packets always were way too sweet, and I'd try to use half of one).  This clever offering fits easily in a coat pocket or a purse and snaps shut tightly with no threat of spillage.  So, it's a great little traveler though I don't know if I'd try to take through airport security!<br /><br />Those using this should be aware that the  liquid does not squeeze out in little droplets.  I made the mistake of thinking it might and held the darn thing sideways instead of upside down.  The sudden, if brief stream of highly concentrated flavor made a bit of a mess to clean up.  My goof, but something to be aware of.  Turn the container upside down and be prepared for it to squirt rather than spout droplets.<br /><br />My biggest complaint, to be honest, is the resulting drink.  I don't know if it's just the sweet tea flavor type, but the drink has a distinctively chemical smell afterwards, and I am fairly sensitive to smells.  The taste itself was about what I'd expect from an added flavor, no calorie substance.  If you don't mind most of the powdered drink additions, this probably won't bother you.  However, those whose tastebuds are more accustomed to home brewed sweet tea may find it more than a little disappointing.<br /><br />Overall, the design is clever and practical.  The execution takes some figuring out, but is perfectly workable.  The taste and smell results are still problematic.  It may be that another flavor would be more to my taste and without the strong smell, but for now I'll stick to making my own sweet tea!<br /><br />Happy drinking ^_^ Shanshad

review/summary: Convenient and Tastes Like Sweet Tea
review/text: I find the MiO Liquid Water Enhancer to be quite handy. It's the easiest way I know of to put together a glass of iced tea. I squirt this stuff, as an octopus squirts ink, into a glass of ice water, keeping in mind that a little goes a long way I stir and add until it resembles the tint of what I would expect a glass of tea to look like.<br /><br />The flavor is nice. Exotic ingredients are at a minimum: acesulfame potassium (Google for its interesting origin) is a sweetener. The rest is water, propylene glycol, malic acid, a couple more additives and some colorings.<br /><br />If you enjoy your tea sweet, this stuff replicates the flavor. I recommend MiO if the speed and convenience of simply squirting a concentrate into a glass of ice water seems appealing.

No it's not "real" tea, but if you like Crystal Light, diet sodas or sports drinks, this is a convenient alternative that doesn't require shaking or stirring.

review/text: I really like the Mio for quick drinks.  I like to drink plain water, but this comes in handy particularly when dieting.  It is nice to have something between meals that has some taste.  Another think that I like about it, is that you can add it to whatever water you want.  I mostly just use filtered tap water, so I don't have all the extra garbage from bottled beverages.<br /><br />With that said, I would only give this flavor a 4 stars out of 5.  It is good, but I really like the Peach Tea flavor so much more.

review/summary: Better than some other instants
review/text: In our house we typically only drink brewed iced tea.  Mio is good in a pinch, or if you're not too awfully picky about the taste, but obviously it's an artificially sweetened and flavored type of mix.  Therefore, you'll still get some of the weird aftertaste, but overall, it's not too bad.  It didn't have that sharp taste like some of the ones coming from a fountain soda machine, which I did appreciate.  Sweetness was balanced with the intensity of the tea flavor such that it wasn't "deep southern" iced tea, which seems to favor sweetness over tea taste.<br /><br />I liked it as did my daughter.  My son liked it, but didn't want a second glass.  My wife didn't like it at all, and she's the biggest tea drinker and probably most taste-sensitive.

review/summary: Not a fan of the Sweet Tea flavor..
review/text: I tried MIO when it first came out and enjoyed the fruit punch flavor. A couple squirts in a bottle of water turned it into a tasty flavored treat. I decided to try this sweet tea variety, and I wasn't too impressed. The flavor just seems off to me, not what I'm accustomed to enjoying from sweet tea. I tried it with just one squirt and with a few, the flavor seems off either way. I'd suggest if you're new to MIO, try one of the other flavors first to see how you enjoy it. If you're a huge sweet tea fan, this may suit you but it didn't sit well with me or my household.<br />Overall, I still prefer Crystal Light packets in my water over MIO, as the flavor is more consistent and they're cheaper where I purchase them in bulk.

review/summary: A Nice Treat
review/text: As one who likes sweet tea but not the calories that go with it, MIO Sweet Tea is a nice little treat.  For the curious, Sucralose (i.e., Splenda) is the artificial sweetener rather than Aspartame (i.e., NutraSweet) which is fine with me since the latter has a very bad aftertaste.  The best way to use this is to mix a small amount into water and ice and take a small taste.  Add more as needed until you get the right amount for your taste.  One warning is that you should stir thoroughly as it has a syrupy texture and does not seem to mix well otherwise.  But the taste is certainly good enough although one can find better teas out there.  The real problem is the steep price.  I can buy six gallons of very good sweet tea at the local convenience store for the list price of this mix.  Thus this might be an interesting idea but I am not sure it is worth the tradeoff.

review/summary: Nice concept if you want sweetened water with no calories.
review/text: Any way to get people to drink more water has to be a good thing.  Mio water enhancer adds flavor to your water so you are encouraged to drink more.  The bottle is small and would easily fit in a pocket or small purse.  Each bottle contains enough flavor for approximately 24 servings, but this varies based on how much you actually squeeze in.  There are zero calories as well.<br /><br />Overall, I would say it's a good product.  My wife and I both enjoyed the flavor.  The aftertaste of artificial sweetener is the only flaw.  The sweet tea actually tastes pretty good, and I liked it better than the mango peach flavor I tried.  We found ourselves using Mio while eating dinner and not wanting plain water.

review/text: I didn't review this for quite some time, quite honestly because I thought I wouldn't like it. I was so wrong! I'm not a huge fan of additives to water that make them super sweet. This is my gripe with Crystal Light and the ilk (you are probably familiar with the little tube-shaped sleeves of powder?) and I only use half a packet when I do use them. With this I can put in as much or as little as I like without having a partially used packet of powder to deal with. The taste is natural and not overly sweet. I'm definitely going to check out some of the other flavors!

review/text: The Sweet Tea Mio has a great taste - very much a Sweet Tea taste. It is easy to get the amount right for the water and you can vary it depending on how you feel. I like this option better, in some ways, than the individual packets since they are a one size fits all. The Mio container is small enough to slip into a purse but I have not done it since I'm worried something will knock it and it will open and spill all over. That is the only downside - it is convenient to have around but perhaps not as portable as I'd like. It works great for the office.

review/summary: Drinking water, besides essential is now fun!
review/text: I drink a lot of water, especially during workouts and while at work. Before getting the MIO, I have never heard of a "specific brand" water enhancer before. The closest thing I could compare to enhancing your drinking water was adding a slice of lemon in some restaurants and that was it. Getting a chance to try this gave me a different perspective of water in its variety all together. The MIO water enhancer gives a dash of creativity in the way you drink this life-giving liquid. Adding a few squirts of the MIO Peach Tea to a glass of water gives it flavor that one can tolerate. It just gives it a sweet flavor for your to enjoy water in a different way. I like the fact that it is free from Caffeine, Fat, Calories, Sodium and all other stuff that you may find from drinking other not so healthy beverages. It is artificially sweetened with Sucralose and Acesulfame Potassium, which after doing a bit of research, are both non-caloric sweeteners. In fact, Sucralose is actually Splenda so you do not need to concern yourself about caloric intake when it comes to drinking your MIO-enhanced H2O. Overall a pleasant and new experience in the way you drink water.

review/summary: Concoct your own flavored water
review/text: Putting flavor on regular water really depends on one's preference.  I am curious and very intrigued with this new product that I tried the following three flavors: Peach-mango, sweet tea and peach tea.  Out of the three, I prefer sweet tea the best as it tastes closer to the real kind than peach tea and peach-mango.  Although I prefer water in its plain form, the taste is not far from ready-to-drink flavored water available commercially.  If you like those, it might worth to try as you more control in what flavor and much flavor you want to put in your water.<br /><br />Mio is very concentrated "water enhancer" - I never heard of those words until now.  A small bottle can be used 24 times.  The plastic bottle has a unique way of dispensing, it will not leak unless you squeeze the bottle for a squirt - one squirt, one serving, and one squirt is enough for a 6- to 8-ounce glass of water.  Of course you can squirt more it depends how squirt happy you are. The amazing thing is that even if I don't stir it, just letting it stands for 20 seconds and the flavor spreads.<br /><br />It uses the artificial sweetener called Sucralose, whose scientific name is Splenda (OK, I probably have mixed them up).  Anyway, it is 600 times sweeter than sugar and has 0 calorie. Mio is also gluten-free.<br /><br />...it's still plain water for me.

It is just one horrid extreme to the other. Either too bland, too sweet, too just plain gross. I don't know if it is me, or the product, or what? Maybe other flavors will be better - who knows.

review/summary: 9 out of 10 ground beetles can't be wrong
review/text: A few drops of MiO caused the water in my glass to turn brownish red. I tasted it. A somewhat pleasant bitter-sweet, vaguely hinting at Cr&egrave;me Br�l&eacute;e or maybe just burned sugar. Strange, not unlike the plain Peach flavor I sampled the other day. I finished the glass and the good news is that 24 hours later there were no side effects other than some mild aftertaste that slowly faded away and changed into more bitter and less sweet. The even better news is that the MiO does not seem to be addictive but time will tell.<br /><br />My review sample had a sticky label over the contents disclosure but patience goes a long way. This is what I learned after I removed the sticky: this product contains mostly... nothing worth talking about. 0 calories, 0% fat, 0% sodium, 0% carbs, 0% protein. It has no or only trace amounts of cholesterol, fiber, saturated fat, transfats, Vitamin C, Calcium or Iron.<br /><br />Then... what is this tea made of? According to the ingredients list, the main ingredient besides 'water' is Propylene Glycol. It's worth checking it out on the Wiki because it's a very useful chemical. They have a long list of good uses there including as a: solvent used in mixing photographic chemicals, working fluid in hydraulic presses, the main ingredient in deodorant sticks, the killing and preserving agent in pitfall traps and to capture ground beetles, cooling agent for beer and wine glycol jacketed fermentation tanks and so many other useful activities such as to regulate humidity in a cigar humidor.<br /><br />All of this is great because, like I said, one day later I'm still okay and smell like a rose or... Cr&egrave;me Br�l&eacute;e? - the deodorant effect - but... where's the tea? I am going to grant this product 2 stars because, after I consumed it in moderation (one glass) it did not make me sick. I'm not planning to drink any more but I'm thinking about using it as bait for Japanese Beetles this coming summer. It might work.

They last 2 months opened, no refrigeration; however, anything sweet goes in my fridge.<br /><br />What is also good about these drinks is that they have a little color, but not enough to stain my clothing, as my sippy cup leaks sometimes.<br /><br />Nice product; needs improvement.<br />----<br />UPDATE:  The product bottle is more durable than I had anticipated.  These drinks have been my mainstay to stay hydrated throughout the day. I even dilute the product because I drink it all day.  Green Apple and Black Cherry from the store are wonderful too.  I am sold on these water flavorings.  Sweet Tea was my favorite from the batch I got from Amazon.

review/text: This is a concentrated water enhancer that doesn't need to be refrigerated and can be taken anywhere. What I like about Mio is that I can take it with me on the road and turn any water into flavored water. I have never liked to drink plain tap water but Mio can change that. Each bottle is said to last 24 servings but it will change depending on your personal taste. One serving is a brief squirt or � teaspoon of Mio.  It's doesn't have any calories or carbs which is important to me because I am trying watch my weight. I have tried other flavors that were better but I don't like the sweet tea flavor at all. It tastes exactly like what it is fake tea. It hardly resembles the taste of tea at all with all in my opinion. I could hardly finish a couple glasses of it and would not get it again. I let my wife try it and she liked it so it will obviously depend on your individual taste. The cost seems high for such a small bottle but it will flavor 192 oz. of water.

review/summary: Nice MiO flavor, not un-like a leading fast-food place
review/text: KRAFT has a slam-dunk - VERY close in taste a well known fast food place.  MiO is handy to have at work, or on a trip. I love the notion that one can control the strength of the flavor, with ease.<br /><br />I keep one in my desk,and one at home. Water just got an "upgrade".  Really nice!

review/summary: I've Had Fewer Cavities since Switching from Sodas to MIO-Flavored Water!
review/text: Approximately two years ago I had a rash of cavities.  My dentist noticed that my teeth were stained from drinking too many sodas.  He asked me to switch to flavored water because sodas are notorious for promoting tooth decay.  A few weeks later I was shopping at the Farm Fresh across the street from my apartment complex; a young man was demonstrating several flavors from the line of MIO Liquid Water Enhancers.  I sampled one of the flavors and immediately liked it.  I've been using the MIO products ever since.<br /><br />  I was thrilled when the Amazon Vine Program sent me a bottle of their MIO Sweet Tea.  This is one of my favorite flavors because it is extremely versatile.  I use it for quenching my thirst after exercising or for drinking with my meals.  A few drops are used when I want my water to be a thirst quencher.  More drops are used when I want something sweet to sip at a relaxing meal.  That is what I like most about all the MIO products; I HAVE CONTROL over the taste of my drink.  Also, the attractive, tear-shaped plastic bottle makes it easy to carry in my backpack.  I normally keep it inside a transparent Ziploc bag in case there is spillage.<br /><br />  As far as my teeth are concerned, I have had fewer cavities.  I must also admit that I've been brushing, flossing and rinsing with mouthwash more often.  In regards to my diet, the only thing I've significantly changed is my consumption of sodas.  I drink very few sodas and use the MIO products instead.  I highly recommend them for anyone who wishes to drink flavored water because they are more economical, more tasteful and more convenient than the powders I've also used in the past.<br /><br />Joseph B.

review/summary: So-So
review/text: Sometimes, you think, plain water is boring--especially when you know that you need to drink several glasses of it every day.  Having a product that gives a pleasant taste to water seems like a great idea.  Somewhere between the execution of that great idea and the actual Mio product, is reality.<br /><br />We all perceive tastes and smells differently, having thousands of receptors in our mouths, noses, and on our tongues.  Our enjoyment or dislike of a product varies, based on those receptors.  Remember too, that we `eat with our eyes' before we taste anything.<br /><br />Using � teaspoon of the concentrate in eight ounces of water (very cold with ice), here are my impressions of this water enhancer:<br />Eyes:  it looks like a light brown color for tea.  Home-brewed teas (except for white, green or, fruit teas) have a darker color.  This one has a touch of pinkish beige to it.<br />Nose:  It has the scent of a weak tea.<br /><br />Mouth:  the first sensation is sweetness, not at all cloying.  I don't get a strong flavor at all.  I add another half teaspoon.  The color deepens.  Instead of tasting more tea, I get more sweetness, not a bolder tea flavor.  I don't add more drops, as I don't want a sweeter flavor--just a stronger tea taste.  In comparison to a popular brand, to which a small tub of tea powder and artificial sweetener is added, this one is lacking.<br /><br />The container is small enough to slip into a handbag, briefcase or, backpack.  The directions call for a half-teaspoon measurement.  It would be easier to have the liquid dispense in drops that could be squeezed from the bottle so, instead of guessing as to exact measurement, the number of drops would be more precise.<br /><br />If used according to the package's directions, this little vial contains 24 servings.  It's certainly convenient to be able to turn a glass of water--or a bottle--into a tasty beverage.  Amazon offers a four-pack (and a single vial option).  Together, they make 96 flavored glasses of water.  That's a tremendous savings if you were to buy the equivalent in bottles of flavored water.<br /><br />Please note that this product contains sucralose, an artificial sweetener.  It also contains dyes.<br /><br />Since we rely on our own senses to rate taste, you may want to buy the single container and judge it for yourself.

review/summary: Sweet but concerned about drinking a glass of chemicals
review/text: While Mio certainly is sweet, has zero calories, and is convenient to use and carry around, my concern is about what's in here. The primary ingredients are water, propylene glycol, artificial flavors, dyes (red 40, yellow 5, blue 1), and preservatives (potassium sorbate). You're basically drinking a glassful of chemicals with each use. There's no actual tea extract and it must be used diluted. The artificial sweeteners, sucralose and acesulfame-K, in particular raise eyebrows among those concerned with food safety. The taste is OK. It tastes like other diet iced teas on the market.<br /><br />About the packaging: it's durable grey plastic, but type 7, which cannot be recycled in many municipalities. Kraft could've used type 1 or 2 plastic instead. The egg does not have an inner foil seal around the nozzle. Mine arrived covered with dried residue on the outside, likely from leaking during rough transit or handling. The liquid is staining, as you can see at the end of my video. My fingers got dyed a brown/orange color from touching the residue. Real iced tea is simple enough to make and cheap. I do not recommend this artificial concoction.

review/summary: use almost anytime/anywhere kind of convenience...
review/text: MIO Sweet Tea liquid water enhancer<br /><br />* because I like a stronger tea flavor, I used 3 squirts of MIO Sweet Tea liquid water enhancer in a large glass of iced water.<br /><br />* nice tea flavor -- not overly strong, even when adding additional squirts of Sweet Tea water enhancer, color is aesthetically pleasing, especially in a clear glass, or water bottle.<br /><br />* nice and sweet...the taste is as I would expect sweet tea to taste -- but, I do realize, taste is subjective and may differ per user.<br /><br />* I detected no chemical smell or nasty aftertaste, no staining of glassware.<br /><br />* note:  only good for 30 days after opening, as per label.<br /><br />Whether hiking through the mountains, sitting through a soccer game,  or power shopping at the latest mega-mall, Sweet Tea water enhancer is a take anywhere, use anytime kind of convenience (does not need to be refrigerated) that I welcome into my hectic lifestyle. --Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2012

review/summary: Interesting addition to MIO Line
review/text: After trying the Mango Peach flavor I was curious about the sweet tea flavor. I enjoy tea but rarely make it anymore.<br /><br />The taste of this drink is very close to iced tea with sweetener. I guess I make mine pretty strong because I found this to be on the mild side. Still, it is refreshing and a nice change from super sweet drinks.

review/summary: Great For Athletic People/Gym Rats
review/text: We usually drink Crystal Light, but have been cutting down on artificial food/drinks. I gave this a try though and found it didn't wow me, but it wasn't something I wouldn't recommend either.<br />The positive is that it's small and one small bottle makes 24 eight ounce servings. It's one squeeze per serving - so - the great thing is you can adjust it - where as with powder - for some reason, if you only want to make part of a serving, you have to guesstimate.<br />Also, sometimes with powder, it won't dissolve all the way.<br />For ease and packaging and the fact you can adjust the strength to your taste, I'd give this 5 stars.<br />Flavor for me wasn't a WOW factor, sort of had a metallic aftertaste (this could be because I'm accustomed to powder drinks).<br />This would really benefit a family or couple who like to take water bottles to workout with them and are really tired of water. A squeeze or two in a 16 oz, a quick shake to mix,  and your on your way. No trash, no spilled powder on the counter, - and ready to the next person who might like their drink a bit stronger.

review/summary: Great flavor, but you've got to like 'sweet'
review/text: MIO Sweet Tea is indeed 'sweet', so if you don't like sweet things, don't bother with this flavor enhancer for your water. The tea flavor does come through too, but it's subtle.  No strong aftertaste with this flavor of MIO and all things considered, it really is one of the best I've tried from their many flavors. I kept thinking to myself as I sipped away on my Sweet Tea flavored water - "If I was on a diet and needed something sweet instead of a soda, this would be it!"<br /><br />So if you're looking for a sweet with no aftertaste drink, that is as close to a regular soda in that 'sweetness', snag some MIO Sweet Tea flavored drink enhancer.  If you are more inclined to enjoy diet sodas, you'll find this too sweet.  Backing off the amount in your drink doesn't really help much as for me at least, the tea flavor was always much fainter than the sweetness.

review/summary: Disgustingly vile.
review/text: I like the concept of this product. There are plenty of people out there who dislike drinking plain water, either because their local water has chlorine or minerals, or just because their tongues demand more flavor. This little plastic bottle could fit into a bag or purse or pocket, and whenever life presented a person with a glass (or bottle) of water, they were one squirt away from a more palatable drink. Especially for people trying to break the expensive and unhealthy soft drink habit, this could be a godsend.<br /><br />Except it tastes disgusting. The 'sweet tea' flavor is just sweet, no tea. It looks a little like tea, due to all of the artificial coloring, but the only flavor is artificial sweetener.<br /><br />Just to make sure my dislike for this wasn't based on the fact that i don't drink much soda, i asked a family member with a diet coke habit to take a sip. He, despite drinking artificially-sweetened artificially-colored drinks every day, also found this revolting.<br /><br />As with any food or drink, one person's appreciation is never universal. I hated this. It doesn't mean everyone will. It may suit your needs better than it suited mine. I, however, would not accept another package of this product unless it came with a $5 bill taped to the side, and even then i'd keep the money and toss the mio.

review/summary: It's Good - Highly Recommended
review/text: MIO "Sweet Tea" has good sweetness and good tea flavor, and is my favorite of this brand. MIO is intended to be added to water and can be mixed "to taste", I like four short squirts into a 12oz water bottle. The snap lock lid is secure enough to carry the container in a shirt pocket and does not need to be refrigerated after opening.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/text: I have tried  many of the flavors and I found that I liked a little extra MIO Sweet Tea than the other flavors- I felt like it wasnt as strong as a flavor of the other flavors- I just tried the Peach Tea flavor and I didnt need as much MIO as I did for the Sweet Tea to taste as  good.<br />Very small bottle that you can carry in your pocket, purse, desk drawer- whatever and all you need is a bottle or glass of water.<br />This one is not one of my favorites but it is still good and I love MIO

review/summary: Better than expected
review/text: I love sweet tea but I don't drink sugary tea very much (it's not that good for me).  As a result, I've tried a lot of tea-flavored powdered water enhancers but they all had a funny after taste.  The MIO sweet tea didn't have any such after taste.  I'm not saying that it tastes like my best home-made tea but it's not bad.  In fact, it's pretty good.<br /><br />As an extra bonus, MIO doesn't need to be refrigerated after opening which means you can toss it into your gym bag and the lid seems pretty secure although I would probably put in a ziplock bag first (I've had to deal with the trauma of cleaning up a shampoo spill in my gym bag-never again!).<br /><br />I'm looking forward to try some of the fruit flavors next.
