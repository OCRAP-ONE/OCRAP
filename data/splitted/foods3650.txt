review/summary: Danielle Sweet Mango Chips are Simply the Best!
review/text: My wife discovered the Danielle Sweet Mango Chips at a Cost Plus World Market.  I hate to think of the fuel we burned going to every one of their markets in the Seattle area looking for more.<br /><br />The Mango chips are outstanding - intense flavor, good crunch - with the added bonus of being sugar,gluten and preservative free.<br /><br />Having owned a restaurant in Mexico which had a huge mango tree in the patio. I learned how great the naturally ripened fruit really tastes. Most of the mangos we find in markets here are still green and lack the mature, well-developed flavor of tree-ripened fruit. The Danielle Sweet Mango Chips capture the pure essence of ripe mango flavor!<br /><br />We'll be setting up a recurring order with Amazon so that we'll never have to be without our favorite snack.

review/summary: Most Delicious Coconut Chips
review/text: I am from a country, where coconuts are the thing. :P we have them on the streets, even on the backyard, pretty much all year long. I am now in the US where a fresh conconut is not the same :(. SO when i saw these chips in the store(TJMax), i was pretty intrigued. I cannot believe how good they are. They taste just like coconut, not overly sweet, but just like a coconut tastes like! I cannot wait to get moreeee!!!

review/text: I learned of this item from a healthy food blog.  These have surprised me to be even better!!  Sweet, crunchy, and slightly salty.  All natural and super healthy!  Perfect for adding to breakfasts, salads, desserts, or straight out of the bag as a healthy snack.  So glad I didn't wait on my Whole Foods to start offering these.

review/text: These are a great gluten free snack!  I eat them alone or add them as a topping on yogurt.  They are crunchy, slightly salty/sweet, not greasy and travel well in a hot car. If you like coconut, I bet you will be a fan of these chips!  Be advised, if you are expecting these to be the size of a potato chip, they aren't.  They are big rectangular shreds about an inch long.

review/text: Danielle coconut chips are the best things ever in life.  I first found them at a airport gift shop on a phoenix layover and I've been addicted ever since.  They carry these at Whole Foods, but the supply is always sketchy and random, so ordering them online in a 6 pack always seems like a good option.<br /><br />Here are the flavors that I really like:<br />1. Coconut - the best ever<br />2. Mango<br />3. Honey Banana<br />4. Tangy Pineapple<br />5. Sweet Potato<br /><br />The okra ones are okay, so are the taro and the durian, I find the jackfruit ones disgusting, the pumpkin ones are gross and the carrot ones are SUPER icky (but I despise carrots, so I may be biased)

review/summary: I've gone Bananas over these Banana Chips!!!!
review/text: My first exposure to these chips was at a local gourmet deli.  I hestitated to purchase them due to the price ($3.25 for a 2 oz bag) but I bought them anyway.  I AM SO GLAD I DID!  These taste nothing like any banana chip I have ever tasted.  They are simply DELICIOUS!!!  The flavor is sweet but non-geasy and the chips have a nice crunch with a light as air puffy texture.  The Ingredients: Just fresh Bananas and palm oil - that's it.  No preservatives - No Trans fat.  The only down side is the price, HOWEVER, if you order them through Amazon's subscription service you will get them at a better price.(you can choose how often you want them delivered).  I couldn't wait to place my order and now I will be receiving them on a regular basis.  TRY them, you won't be dissapointed!

review/text: Great crispy texture, delicately sweet flavor.  Large enough portion for sustained snacking.  I can imagine it would be awesome in combination with other sweet things, like cakes or ice cream.  Chips are long, slightly curled, and narrow, about 0.5cm-1cm in thickness by 1.5-5cms in length.

review/summary: Expensive, but good
review/text: It's pretty expensive considering how much chips is actually in the package. But, it tastes great (similar to durian chips I've had in Thailand) & healthy to boot. If you've never tried durian / heard notorious things about the fruit / hated how the actual fruit tasted, fear not! It doesn't taste/smell remotely like the fruit: more like non-oily potato chips with a smooth buttery aftertaste.

review/text: I usually don't like artificial coconut flavored stuff, but this roasted coconut chip is soooo good. I ate the 1 whole bag on my way to work, though I do not recommend doing that. The chips are crispy and sweet, with a strong coconut flavor. I would give the jackfruit one a try if Amazon sells the 6-packs rather than the 20-packs one. In short, if you like coconut in general, or even if you are not a big fan of coconut, give it a try and you will be amazed!!

review/text: If you love coconut, then this is for you.  As a bona fide coco-'nut', I can tell you this product is delicious...crispy and lightly sweet wide flakes.  The drawbacks are that the bag contains a pretty small amount and the pieces are brittle and break.  That being said, the coconut is great for snacking or garnishing desserts/baked goods.

review/text: I first purchased this Danielle product at all places, Marshalls. I was on my way to the movies, and was looking for something to munch on, and somehow found this bag to look appetizing.  I immediately opened in my car to see if I was gonna like this hidden snack before I got all comfy during coming attractions.<br />Oh WOW...I was hooked.  I literally had to force myself to stop eating, and wait until I got to the movies.  It took a lot of restraint, and (I'm a picky foodie when it comes to snacks.)  I enjoyed every little tidbit of Coconut in the bag, and was sad when it was gone.<br />When the movie ended, I googled where I can find this snack, and found out it was only sold in stores in the New York area.  Somehow Marshalls ended up with this product due to some overstock not sold, or in some other capacity.  I hit the Marshalls the next day, and sadly found all the Coconut sold out.  I purchased the Pineapple in hopes it had the same kind of taste the Coconut had, but no...it was horrible.<br />I've been looking high and low for this at other local Marshalls, but no luck.  I finally caved in, and purchased here.  I'm excitedly waiting for my 12 bag order.<br />If you LOVE Coconut as much as I do, you will truly love this snack.  I agree with others, for the price, the bag should have a bit more to enjoy.

I happen to love durian but these have none of the infamous smell. they are nutty, salty, and delicious, tasting more like the boiled durian seed. My only complaint was that the chips were perhaps crushed in transit and very very tiny.

review/text: After buying coconut chips at Trader Joe's and loving them, I had to find more (I don't live near a Trader Joe's). Found these on Amazon and HOPED they would be the same kind of product. Was excited to find out they are! They're basically shaved pieces of coconut that are baked/roasted. Ingredients listed on the bag are fresh coconuts, sugar, and salt. They're delicious and have the perfect crunch! As a bonus, they're a natural treat. I eat them as a snack all by themselves; my toddler loves them too! The six-pack will last us quite a while.

review/summary: Heavenly snack for a coconut lover!
review/text: We're on vacation in Maui and I happened to pick up a bag Danielle's coconut chips from a shave ice vendor down the street. I LOVE coconut but get discouraged by all the over-sugared options. These are WONDERFUL! I have 2-year-old twin boys, and I couldn't get them to stop eating them. I was so eager to get my hands on more that I emailed our local Whole Foods from the beach, only to find out that they don't carry the coconut flavor. I begged them to reconsider - but then I discovered that Amazon carries them, so all my troubles are over. :) Really, if you like coconut, give these a try! (By the way, the mango is delicious, too!)

review/text: These Danielle coconut chips are absolutely outstanding.  I typically don't like coconut (mostly the texture...flavor is okay), but these are one of the best snacks I've ever eaten.  I've recently introduced them to three different family members who ordered them immediately upon trying them.  The texture and flavor are wonderful...tiny little ribbons of crisp coconut.  And the whole bag is only 250 calories.  Yes, the bag is small, especially for the price, but they are worth it.  I can't recommend these enough.

review/summary: Sooooooooo good!
review/text: We're staying at Stanford's Children's Hospital with my son, and I'm sure I don't have to elaborate how 'pleasant' hospital cafeteria food can be, even at a 'great' cafeteria (as hospital cafeteria's go, Stanford's is actually very good. But it is still cafeteria food). On weekends the Children's side cafeteria closes down so you have to go over to the main hospital's cafeteria for dinner. Grabbed a turkey sandwich and was looking for some chips or something crunchy, and I saw these. I'm a big coconut fan so I figured I couldn't go wrong, and it's healthier than potato chips so I'm game. I made the mistake of trying a bite of them before I had my sandwich, I didn't want to put the bag down! Holy smokes, seriously the best 'chip substitute' I've ever had, and if they weren't so expensive I'd switch over from potato chips completely!! Perfect combination of salty/sweet, loads of coconut flavor (I've had some where it's really subtle and mild, this definitely is not), great size strips (like someone said, looks like they put it through a strip paper shredder just a bit wider), perfect crunchiness. Anyways, definitely a rare treat because of the expense, but so worth every penny! I may have to grab another bag for the road home though before we get discharged this afternoon. ; )

I do, however, want to let others know that the amount per package is really small, the pieces are also not very large (after a short time of nibbling you almost feel as though you should have just bought a package of shredded coconut from the local market and toasted it in your oven... or even had purchased a fresh coconut)... as far as "bang for your buck" these got a thumbs down for me. I have no problem spending more money for healthy goods for my family, I see it as a very worthy splurge - but, these left me disappointed... bag full of air and a small palm-ful of toasted coconut...  :(

review/summary: WOWstanding!
review/text: I've been trying to wean myself off sucralose for some time and decided to try the pure stevia extract from (rhymes with) Traitor Schmoes.  It was mediocre at best.  Bitter.  Then a couple of weeks ago, I was in my local natural foods store.  I stop by there periodically and buy stuff simply to support local business.  I saw a bottle of this product and the label's claim that it's "non-bitter." So I sez to myself I sez, Why not? Brought it home, not expecting much.  Holy cr*p!  INfinitely better than the competition.  Barely--if at all--bitter.  And MUCH less required to achieve equivalent sweetness. I use it primarily in my morning oatmeal and in lemonade and iced tea.  I'm actually able to measure how much I use, because the competition's product comes with a little coke spoon that hold 45 milligrams.  I use two LEVEL spoonfuls of the NuNaturals product to make a humongous bowl of very sweet oatmeal (with pumpkin and apple thrown in) or 24 ounces of lemonade.  I'm going to experiment with lower amounts.  But even if I decide not to go lower, a 90 milligram serving (2 times 45 milligrams) is going to give me around 500 servings out of a one-ounce bottle of NuStevia.  Excellent product!

review/summary: THE BEST stevia on the market!!!
review/text: NuNaturals has THE BEST stevia on the market! I've tried many others but they don't compare, and are also full of fillers (who needs fiber with their sweetener?? Just give me the SWEET!). The extract makes it so "a little dab will do ya" to satisfy any sweet tooth. And so nice to have a great-tasting, super-sweetening option that isn't a chemical!

review/summary: I love this
review/text: I've used NuNaturals Nustevia Pure White Stevia Extract for many years and I recommend it to everyone.  It doesn't have an after taste, and while I'm selective about the recipes I use it in, whatever I make with it has to pass a taste test with picky people who usually use sugar. No one ever knows I'm using stevia until I tell them. It is super sweet, and you will need tiny amounts, usually 1/4 TEASPOON to equal 1 cup of sugar, (yes 1/4 teaspoon).  You can buy this product in individual packets to sweeten a drink, because it's difficult to measure for one glass from this container. In some recipes, I use half sugar/half stevia (in lemonade), and in others that are very flavorful(canned salsa), I use this stevia, and no sugar. Because it is super sweet, use less than you think you need and add more if needed. This company makes a product that dissolves easier than this one, but I chose to get the one without the added ingredients.

review/text: This is the best stevia brand on the market. It's not bitter at all, and will really satisfy those lingering sugar cravings. It dissolves well in beverages, too. A little goes a very long way, so this little bottle will last a long time. Don't suffer through the bitterness of other brands. This is the only stevia I'll buy.

review/summary: No complaints here
review/text: I don't eat sugar and this form of stevia was recommended to me by a website I frequent that really prides itself on recommending healthy products.  Apparently this form of stevia is pesticide free as tested by an independent laboratory, so that's a plus.  It has a very pleasant taste--I use it in baking and in my tea, cereal, etc.  Just remember--a little goes a VERY long way.  It is extremely concentrated.  I like to mix it with a bag of Agave Inulin powder (an extremely mild sweetener that is a prebiotic) so that I don't overdo it.

review/summary: Hair and gunk in the powder
review/text: NuNaturals Nustevia Pure White Stevia Extract , 1-Ounce ships from and sold by Amazon.com<br /><br />The Good<br />This stuff is amazing.  I use 1/8 of tsp to sweeten practically everything, 20oz tea, cup of oatmeal etc.  There is no bitterness and it truly takes very little to sweeten.  Unfortunately, because I need to use so little of it, (bought in January and still have a lot in September) the hair and gunk was buried.  I just discovered the gunk. and of course it is too late to return.<br />THE BAD<br />Hair and gunk, beyond the obvious grossness, this stuff was expensive, $17.15 for one ounce and did not even get an ounce of it because hair and gunk weigh something.  (The price has come down, but  buying high is story of my life.)  I had bought 4 more when it appeared it was on sale for half price, I have not opened those, so don't know  if they suffered the same lack of quality control.  Will update if they are or aren't.<br />If you buy, dig through it before using.  I don't know if this is their standard quality or if this one jar was a fluke.  But, it was all at the bottom, so took a long time to get to the point of spooning from the bottom and revealing the hair and gunk.

review/text: I've purchased many different types of Stevia products but NuNaturals Stevia Extract is by far the best tasting and the most economical. You only use 1/64 of a teaspoon (tiny amount) to sweeten like a teaspoon of sugar. It has no aftertaste like other types of Stevia. It is EXCELLENT! and HEALTHY!

I use a little more than that for my Kool-Aid, but everything else takes less.  Oatmeal, cereal, etc.  it takes very little to sweeten them.  You do have to be careful about using too much, as it can create a strange taste.  Outstanding product.  I love it, but it is expensive and I wish it was a more reasonable price.  HTH.

review/summary: Tried others, this stevia is the BEST
review/text: No bitterness! That's the best part, but it also takes very little - 1/64 or 1/32 of a teaspoon. It helps if you have small measuring spoons like these:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MOYI5W">Amco Measuring Spoons for Small Amounts</a>. A "Drop" is 1/64 and the next size up is 1/32 ("Smidge") which is also useful when measuring the stevia. Switching from Nutrasweet to this has helped my cravings. Now I make my own flavored water - lemon juice and a "smidge" of stevia per quart. I used to drink MIO or Crystal Light and felt bloated. Now that I'm drinking my own concoction, the bloat is gone. It's a small bottle and it looks only half full when first opened, but it contains 700 servings, if using 1/64 tsp.

review/summary: pretty good
review/text: So far this is one of the better tasting stevia brands I have tried. Not much of an aftertaste and very concentrated. I put 1/8 of a teaspoon in a gallon of tea and it was almost too sweet. The reason I give 4 starts instead of 5 is because it says "other natural ingredients" but doesn't say what the other ingredients are.I want to know exactly what I am putting in my body.<br /><br />*UPDATE* I called the company and was told that the other "Natural flavor" was also a plant extract, but they couldn't tell me which plant because it was a trade secret. They assured me that it was hypoallergenic and they told me the plant was from a plant in the "periwinkle" family. What if you are allergic to periwinkle? I mean they should not have the right to with hold ingredients. I still don't like not knowing. And a plant extract could contain fructose or dextrose or some form of sugar that could have an impact on blood glucose levels or insulin secretion. They did say that the amount of additive they use is very minimal and is only to enhance the flavor, but I still don't like not knowing. I won't buy it again due to this minute detail. I will stick with Kal brand Stevia.

review/summary: Quality food
review/text: We have fed this dog food to our dog for her entire life.  It was the recommended food by her vet when she was a puppy.  Now she is almost 17 years old, and she is remarkably healthy.  As she became a senior dog, I tried changing to the Natural Life Senior formula, but it made her lethargic, so we went back to the adult formula.  Recently, at her advanced age, she lost some weight.  The vet said it was probably muscle mass.  Fortunately, Natural Life Adult Formula has one of the highest protein contents of all of the high grade foods I looked at, so it probably stands the best chance of helping maintain muscle mass.  The vet agreed that we should not change her diet.

I kind of have to mix it in with other things because they don't care for eating it alone like some of the others.  The only thing I noticed that I didn't care for is that when I opened the bag I kind of got a vitamin smell instead of a food aroma, like meat or ingredients.  I'm not sure I like so many vitamins as a constant or as a substitute for good whole healthy foods. Would you like your food to smell like vitamins?

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I purchased after reading many reviews.  Use on face, chest and hands.  The first application was not dramatic as far as results go; but I use daily and the results are fantastic.  It took me about a week to get the impressive results.  I have very dry skin. My serums and creams were not penetrating into my skin to give me a hydrated look.  Now I can easiy tell when the serums and creams are penetrating.  My skin is much more even in color, hydrated, healthy looking.  I apply the mask work into my skin for a few seconds and leave on for 15 minutes.  Remove  in shower and use a microdermabrasion product to remove dead skin after I rinse off the mask. I use a heavy cream on my skin after my serums to seal in moisture.  The skin on my chest was pebble like and I hated it.  This product has removed that look. That took over a week to change, but wow I can wear lower cut tops now and my skin is radiant!  My hands were looking rough.  My knuckles were so dry even lotion did not help.  I use this on my hands every night, remove with a microdermabrasion product then apply a thick lotion.  Finally my hands look very nice.  I have stocked up on this product, I never want to run out.  I also use the eye treatment, spray toner (use throughout the day to freshen up makeup), body polish and body creams. Sometimes I can get lucky and find this product line in stores; but not very often.  Finally a product line that works!

review/summary: Mild but effective!
review/text: I don't know how I will ever use any other face wash ever again! This cleanser is amazing! It's very light but very effective at removing my makeup (I wear Bare Minerals). Unlike other cleansers, my skin doesn't feel dry and tight after I rinse. Instead, it feels soft and moisturized so I know it's not stripping my own natural oils.<br /><br />The cleanser is clear, with a fantastic scent, that works up into a rich lather. I have not tried the Pineapple Scrub, but when I want some exfoliation, I lather up my face with the cleanser and dab on some plain white table sugar. After some gentle massage, I wash everything off and my skin feels great!<br /><br />I have combo skin with acne around the chin and cheeks and this cleanser never hurts, stings, or irritates my blemishes (unlike a lot of other products). Since my acne is mainly from resting my chin/cheeks on my hands, until that habit stops I will always have breakouts. Luckily, this cleanser works so well and now that my skin feels so good, I don't want to touch my face anymore!

review/summary: Fantastic exfoliator
review/text: I bought this because exfoliants with small granules were too rough on my dry skin. I got a professional facial to help with my dry skin and they recommended a fruit enzyme peel that will dissolve dry skin without being so rough. Of course they wanted me to purchase an incredibly expensive product, but I decided to do some looking on my own. I settled on this product and have been very pleased. I can use it daily without it being too harsh on my skin and it dissolves all flaky, dry skin on my face. Even using it daily or every other day, the product has lasted a while (bought it in mid-August and still going here at Thanksgiving). It smells pleasant and feels soothing on my skin. Also, I think that Amazon had this listed as a liquid, but in reality it's a thick gel.

review/summary: Love the smell, how it feels, skin looks refreshed after!
review/text: I am usually critical of skin care product that doesn't come from a dermatologist's office.  Mainly because those products and brands can have more active ingredients than store product getting better results.  This stuff is so great! I love the smell, it feels really cool and refreshing on my skin (almost like aloe), and my skin really does look shinier and refreshed after I use it.  Also, it only has to stay on for 5 minutes so it's something I can do more often than masks that require 20-30 minutes.

review/summary: The right cleanser for me.
review/text: Love this facial cleanser.  My skin tends to be oily and flaky.  I'm no longer shiny, and I've had no break outs at all since I started using it.  It takes off all my makeup without leaving my skin feeling tight and dry.  Even my skin tone is more even.  My face hasn't looked this good since my pre-teen days.  Love it.  I'm never using anything else again.

review/summary: Overpowering Smell
review/text: This cream is more for normal to oily skin rather then dry/mature skin.  It goes on nicely and gets absorbed quickly.  It leaves a nice smooth feel on your skin like the more expensive creams do.  However this cream has an overpowering sweet jasmine smell.  The smell does not fade.  People will only smell your face cream.  This could be used as face cream/cheap perfume. I thought I can get used to the smell but it's too strong and rather unpleasent.

review/summary: Amazing product for what you pay for it.....
review/text: I've used this product considerably since I've moved to a different climate.  In this climate I break out along my t-zone, which I never had an issue before, but using this product enables me to help minimize and control the breakouts.  I also notice that this product helps fade away old acne scars.. not completely, but it does help minimize the appearance.  I have combo skin, therefore I only dab it on the affected or broken out areas rather than putting it all over my face because I noticed it did dry out my dry areas.  I also use it everyday on the affected areas without any issues.  I can't answer in terms of pores, but I do feel like the next morning after applying this product my skin tone looks more even.

review/text: SO disappointed! I have oily, mild acne prone, sensitive, combo skin. This product DID NOT absorb into my skin AT ALL. It sat on top of my skin creating a 'slippery' greasy layer. Eww. After about 30 minutes, my skin was extremely oily, shiny & greasy looking. It looked and felt like baby oil on my face! I have oily skin but this product brought MORE excessive oil onto my face even in areas where I normally don't get oily. I don't understand how this is a oil-free moisturizer but yet makes your skin extremely oily. Glad I was able to return it!

review/summary: Burns Sensitive Skin
review/text: I bought this product because I was looking for something more natural for my sensitive skin.  Says its "gentle for all skin types" but it's not.  Literally 2 seconds after I put the first dab on my face it started burning. I could see my skin turning red and getting a rash under it.  I had to wash it off immediately.  The spot that had it does feel softer than the rest of my face, but the burning and rash is SO not worth it.  My second complaint is that it's a gel mask versus a clay mask.  I should have read the ingredients better for that one though.

review/summary: My best beauty secret!
review/text: I love this product.  I have sensitive skin, & this is really gentle & soothing.  I also try to avoid wearing foundation, but this moisturizer wears well under Physician's Formula Organic Wear Foundation.  (I haven't tried it with any other foundation products).  I exfoliate every other day & apply this afterward, as well as after getting out of the shower.  The fragrance isn't too strong, and I love that its oil free, because I have extremely oily skin.  (I obviously wash my face on a regular basis as well in addition to exfoliating.)  This is a hard product to review because people's needs, opinions, & skin types are so different.  I was initially hesitant to pay so much for it, but in comparison to other oil free moisturizers, this one is about the same cost, & isn't full of harsh chemicals, fillers, & other crap that clogs your pores up.  Just my two cents.

review/summary: Effective skin tightening face mask
review/text: I've been using this face mask for years. It is much cheaper buying it online than at your local drugstore. I use it about twice a week on my entire face, but almost daily just under my eyes. I apply it there when I wake up, pre-shower. It does a nice job of tightening the baggy skin under my eyes. It's not surgery so the effect doesn't last forever but it does help. I've had no adverse reactions from using Alba Botanica Papaya Enzyme facial mask.

review/summary: Oily dilemma...
review/text: I have a very hard time finding a moisterizer.  I have a very oily t-zone while the rest of my face is dry to the point of flakey.  A word of caution if you already have oily prone skin... This created more oil.  I only used it at night and when I woke the next morning I was shoked at the sheen of oil covering my entire face.  I was disgusted.  Granted, it didn't appear to clog pores, nor make my acne worse (I am an unfortunate sufferer of that infamous adult acne around the mouth and chin area).<br /><br />A nice thing about this moisterizer is it was extremely refreshing after applying.  Especially those nights following a toner that can sometimes leave that sting behind.  I love the smell of it too.  I have since switched to only applying it outside of my t-zone, and while I still discover oil the next morning, it isn't near as bad as before.<br /><br />I am on the hunt for a new moisterizer, as I probably won't continue to use this.  Unfortunately there just aren't a lot of moisterizers with green tea, which is what I was looking for.

review/summary: Long lasting lip balm
review/text: I've been using blistex for decades, burts bees for years and I just found this in the organic section at wal mart.  I like coconut and decided to give this a try.<br />Seriously, in my pockets always are my wallet, keys and lip balm.  I've worked outdoors for years and depend upon it's protection from the elements.  Blistex is fine, but I wanted something more organic, Burts Bees is great, but I don't like their tube as much 'cause sometimes I keep this in my bra (when I don't have pockets)and it's scratchy and the peppermint is annoying at times.  (I have yet to try the others)<br />But this Coconut Cream lip balm is really amazing.  It last for a really really long time.  I put it on before bedtime and in the morning there's still some on my lips, protecting and smoothing them.  I like the feel and the flavor and will be purchasing this product for many years to come now that I have discovered it!  Invest the 3 bucks and see for yourself if it isn't better than what you're using.

review/summary: I always come back to this product
review/text: I have really sensitive skin; it reacts poorly to almost everything (including hard water), it is dry in spots and oily in others, and it definitely sees a blemish from time to time. I've tried just about every product out there because I am easily swayed by advertisements for new organic facial products, but I always come back to this line. Unlike most products for 'troubled' skin, which contain harsh salicycle acid, this product doesn't make my break-outs worse at all. It's oil free, so even after a long day my nose doesn't feel slick, and it's nice and light so it goes great under make-up. The scent is fantastic and a little jar goes a long way because you need so little of it. If your skin is like mine, I recommend the pineapple enzyme cleanser, the habiscus toner, the papaya mask, and this moisturizer. That regiment keeps me clear, soft, and smelling like the tropics. The only thing I don't use is the eye gel, which is a bit too light for the eye area.

review/summary: Deep Cleansing Fruity Face Scrub
review/text: Alba's Pineapple Enzyme Facial Scrub is deliciously pineapple with hints of orange juice and dreams of coconut drinks on beaches somewhere very far from home. The tropical escape factor is very present all while the scrub works overtime to remove dull surface cells. Lavender, Aloe, Jojoba, Pineapple, Papaya, Awapuhi, Bromelain and Vitamin E are the base for this creamy cleanser enhanced with a botanical fragrance. The exfoliating granules are very mild and the aloe makes this extra soothing. After one use you can see results in tone/texture and moisture balance, after three uses, you may find yourself ordering a second tube. It is that impressive. Looking forward to trying the travel kit because the products have amazing summery scents that remind me of warm days at the beach.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Not for Sensitive Skin - Read Ingredients First
review/text: I love the Alba products because they contain lots of natural ingredients and are a great value for the price, plus I've always had good resutls with them.  I use the sea kelp products and really like them but decided to try something different for the summer, so I ordered the Jasmine moisturizer and the hibiscus facial toner.  The jasmine cream is wonderful and works great on my dry skin but, unfortunately, the hibiscus facial toner caused severe burning to my skin. After I read the entire ingredient listing, I was shocked to find this toner contains sodium hydroxide which is used in such harsh cleaning products as oven and drain cleaners.  I do have sensitive skin which, I am certain, caused the reaction.  I don't think this product is for sensitive skin, but be sure to read the entire ingredient list before you decide to purchase it, and if possible, try a sample of it first.  I went back to the sea kelp facial toner and have had no further problems.

review/summary: So Tasty!
review/text: My only problem with this lip balm is that it tastes so good I lick it off! If you like coconut anything you'll love this!<br /><br />I love that it's made with 100% vegetarian ingredients and is never tested on animals. The ingredients are also 82% certified organic, which is a nice plus.

review/summary: Great Moisturizer, Overpowered by Scent
review/text: This product moisturizes very nicely. It goes on very smooth and stays on for awhile. I really wanted to love this cream, but the smell is just so overpowering. I was expecting a soft, light scent, but this is just so strong and overpowering that it almost makes you dizzy. The smell does not diminish the longer you wear it; I put the cream on before bed, and woke up the next morning smelling like I had just put it on. It's very unfortunate, in my opinion the smell makes the cream unwearable.

review/summary: WOW
review/text: I actually ended up buying this from walmart because I was in need of an oil free moisturizer for my face...BADLY and didn't want to way 4-5 days for my order to process on here. So I purchased it (and I cringed at the thought of spending 15 bucks on a small container of moisturizer), and applied it to my clean face in the morning and before bed. Let me tell you...<br /><br />THIS THING ZAPPED MY PIMPLES LIKE NO TOMORROW!!!<br /><br />Not only did it feel nice and silky on my face, and it soaked in, but it just cleared my face up! I was so surprised. I thought it was too good to be true and maybe it happened to be one of those days that my skin decided to clear uyp on it's own. But no, I was wrong... and thank goodness. I continued using the moisturizer twice a day for a week and my face just stayed clear for the entire week. I was so happy!<br /><br />This stuff is definitely worth the money, and it WILL last you quite a long time since a little DOES go a long way. How little you ask? Just lightly, and quickly tap your finger onto the surface of the moisturizer and that's all you'll really need!<br /><br />Five stars, baby. FIVE STARS!

review/summary: Great Scent!
review/text: I like this moisture cream a lot. It feels great on my face and the Jasmine scent is so pleasant. The ingredients are all good too. I don't use chemcial laden products and Alba makes great natural products. Alba makes several moisture creams in other scents, but the Jasmine is my absolute favorite and I'll continue to purchase this one. My husband likes the scent a lot too.
