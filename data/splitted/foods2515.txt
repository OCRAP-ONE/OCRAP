review/summary: Great Bar but pricey
review/text: I really like these bars and have been buying them at the grocery store for a while.  I figured that since I was eating so many of them, I should order here to save money.  WRONG.  They are much cheaper to buy individually at my local grocery store.  I was very surprised by that as I thought I would save money by buying in bulk.  Too bad.

review/summary: Almost too good
review/text: I bought this product because I love other Kashi foods. All I can say is YUM! I am currently tring to lose weight and so I figured the protein and fiber would be great. I was right... and the taste is delish! The only problem is that if I am using them to satisfy a sweets craving I have to really watch it or 1 bar turns into 2 bars... and well... I know it is more a self-control issue than a product issue. It is just that they are really that good. I'd take one of these bars over a snickers ANY day!.

review/text: I can't imagine eating one of these bars for breakfast. First of all, they are definitely not filling enough to replace a meal. And second of all, they are pretty sweet! In fact, there are 14 grams of sugar in each little bar.<br /><br />I would definitely buy these as a healthier, more nutritious replacement for a cookie or candy bar when I wanted something sweet and chewy.

review/summary: Delicious, satisfying snack
review/text: I'm new to the Kashi brand of products but stumbled upon the chocolate peanut bars at my local Wegman's market.  I've tried a number of nutrition/energy bars, including Clif, Pria, Powerbar, etc. and the Kashi bars are by far the best.  They do not taste artificial like most of the other bars I've tried.  The chocolate satisfies your sweet tooth, and the peanut butter flavor is great too.  I'm a fan of granola so these are really the perfect snack for me.  They're very crunchy and are a decent size too, so by the time you're done you feel like you've actually eaten something substantial.  Now that I've tried these I won't be buying any of the other bars on the market.

review/text: I am one hardly to ever leave product reviews, and as much as I buy online, I should work on that. But, after trying the various Kashi products, these bars are by far the best and I feel the need to leave a review! I started off eating the Kashi Honey Almond Flax granola bars, which are very good, but definitley not as sweet as these (not a good OR bad thing, just a comparison). However, you will still get the protein, fiber and omega-3s if that's what you're looking for. If you love chocolate and almonds and are looking for a protein/fiber bar that tastes good and is more on the sweet side, this is definitely one to try!!! Whether you use them as a meal replacement or as a snack, they are absolutley amazing and I will definitely be a repeat customer.

The pickles and peppers have just the right amount of sweet and tart. Almost like eating dill and sweet pickles at the same time and then throwing in a little spice for good measure. I usually only eat pickles or relish on a hot dog but I put this on everything: hot dogs, sandwiches, hamburgers, side dish or just as a treat. They're almost addictive. I've been out for a few weeks and still think of them fondly. As a matter of fact, I'm going to finish writing this and go buy a couple of more before I forget!

I am a fan of Joe's art of coffee store in NYC, and I usually only use their beans, but now, I would only use their beans when I am running low on these beans and the new order has not arrived yet.<br /><br />Taste: Goes down smooth and does not taste sour.

review/text: I have vivid memories from my childhood of filling both Ritz crackers and Wheat Thins with spiraling cords of rich and cheesy goo. I, myself, prefer filling the top of one cracker with cheese and then putting another cracker on top to form a cheesy sandwich, not unlike an Oreo. But, I have on occasion been known to spray the can directly into my pie-hole(only if I know no one will use the can after me). And who doesn't love when the can starts to run low and the aerosol spits cheese shrapnel all over the place?<br /><br />Of course highly processed cheese in a can is not the best choice if you are either watching your weight and/or trying to maintain healthy consumption practices.

review/summary: Aunt Sally's Pralines are the very best!!!
review/text: There are a lot of places that sell pralines, or what they advertise as pralines.  However, the original sugary (not creamy) pralines that Aunt Sally's sells are the only authentic ones.  I am from Louisiana, and have been eating Aunt Sally's for probably 50 years!  You cannot find a better praline than this one.  Don't even think you are getting a good praline when you see them in Mexican restaurants or other places.  This is the one and only kind - it should be sugary, thin, and full of pecans.  Actually it's a very simple delicacy, but apparently they are not as easy to make because there are too many out there that just don't come close.  If you want a real taste of a good New Orleans praline, you simple must get Aunt Sally's Original Creole Pralines.

review/text: One of the things that I missed the most when I went gluten-free was a good, spicy molasses cookie.  This offering from Nana's definitely fits the bill.  I took off one star simply because it is pricey.  On the plus side, the cookies are quite big and it is nice to have an option for vegan treats.  I have tried to make gluten-free cookies of my own and have failed miserably because I try to make them healthy.  I appreciate Amazon for offering these because the company offers low prices, free shipping, and excellent customer service.

I think these cookies are great.  Good texture, if a little dense (aren't all gluten free products?), with a nice lemon flavor.  The cookies are also big, so if you want to eat just one serving, which is half the cookie, it is satisfying.  I have also tried warming them up and dipping them in a bit of rice milk, yum!  Liked them so much that I have ordered these again and have also decided to try the ginger ones too.

I am eager to order more flavors of this cookie to try and compare, as these are much cheaper than the ABC brand, which is not currently available at amazon.

Note that one serving is half a cookie, which would be plenty as a dessert or snack. But a whole cookie makes a meal, and is very filling.<br />Read the ingredient list carefully and you will see one *important* difference between this brand and other "healthy" cookie or pastry-bar type treats: (organic) WHOLE wheat flour. Not "wheat flour", which is the same as white flour, and has no nutritional value.<br />Another plus is that even the chocolate chips in the cookie are sweetened with low-glycemic malted barley, not cane sugar.<br />I'm looking forward to trying more varieties of Nana's cookies.

I've tried Alternative Baking Company's double chocolate cookie, which I loved, but per cookie they charge $2 a piece. I searched for another company that makes a similar cookie, and found this company (Nana's). The cookie is every bit as good as  the ABC's cookie, and a lot cheaper at that. Hands down the best cookie I've ever eaten. For any vegans or anyone looking to decrease their sugar intake, this is definitely worth trying.

So please if you don't have any tolences ...please state it... because you have more choices than us that do not. I would also like to let in on another product that seems to be some kind of secret cause i can't find it anymore but want to spread the word on another delicious chocolate gluten free product sof'ella gluten free chocolate cake mix and fosting mix...this is the best cake i have eaten....just passing along the info...:)

review/summary: Gluten Free Momma says your kids will love them!
review/text: I am always in search of gluten free/dairy free products for my kids and myself and this one is a soft, chocolatey treat and a fairly affordable prepackaged cookie. Before going gluten free I wouldn't have given these a second chance but I've had a LOT of really bad cookies lately and this one is really pretty good for what is available. I'm buying again!

review/text: Nana's Gluten Free cookies are my favorite!  I've had to eat gluten free for 2 years now, but have recently found out I have food sensitivities to egg, dairy, yeast, soy, and sugar.  These cookies are so good, even friends who don't have food sensitivities like them.  I'm so thankful to have found such a great tasting dessert that is free of all the foods I can't eat.

review/summary: No Gluten, No Worries . . .
review/text: Hello all, I am gluten intolerant, so I tried one of these cookies about a year ago at the local<br />store.  Yummy, pretty much sums it up for me.  While they are called a cookie, they remind<br />me of my Grandmom's lemon pound cake, and so very soft.  I am a huge Amazon shopper,<br />so when I found them here, I was delighted.  So far, I have probably ordered them 12 times and<br />right now I have two boxes in my pantry.  I've learned to keep plenty on hand so I don't run<br />out of them.  Amazon's price is great, shipping is great and they arrive just perfect.  Thanks!!!!

review/text: The flavor of both the lemon and ginger cookies is good, and if the texture of these cookies could be improved, I might even buy them again.  The texture was grainy and distracting.  I'll try the tip about refrigerating them for the two dozen I purchased.  Maybe a better mixture of flours rather than the predominate rice flour in this cookie would help eliminate the grainy texture.

I thought oh, it's vegan that's why it tastes OK. So, maybe it grew on me. But now, I just love them. They are soft and moist. They have just enough walnuts in them to give it a great flavor.

review/text: This is the best tasting healthy cookie I've ever had (with the exception of the rest of Nana's Cookies).  If you have an allergy to wheat and wheat products, this cookie is for you.  However, be advised that the calorie count shown on the nutrition label is for HALF the cookie.  I don't know about you, but I don't eat just half a cookie!  Be that as it may, I would recommend these cookies for the great flavor and chewy texture.

review/summary: So disappointing!
review/text: This sad confection is a perfect example of why you shouldn't do your grocery shopping while you're hungry. It was a total impulse buy and i was REALLY excited about it. No eggs? No dairy? Hooray a cookie for vegans like me! It sounded perfect. When i got home and took a bite i was SO disappointed. There's hardly any lemon flavor to it and it sucked all the moisture out of my mouth. It was like trying to swallow paste. I tried a few more bites to give it a fair chance ... but wound up throwing the majority of the cookie in the trash.<br /><br />Unfortunately, i paid over $2 for this darn atrocity. Ah well... lesson learned.

review/text: I don't know which was worse, the ginger or the lemon cookie.  All I can say is the texture is really off putting to me.  Gluten-free is challenging and getting the best texture is difficult.  Seems like too much reliance on rice flour (cheaper).  Maybe an increase in another gluten-free flour would help.  I ended up donating them to the local food bank.

review/text: I recently tried this cookie and the Ginger flavor.  They were both disgusting.  The texture was similar to a protein bar.  The flavor of the chocolate one was very weak, contrary to the label, which states that it has a rich chocolate flavor.  The other one was very spicy, with no sweetness to cut the spice.  Not a pleasant experience.  I didn't finish either of them.

review/text: I love any good peanut butter cookie and thought this vendor, Nanas, looked to have pretty good reviews. But I'll tell ya... it's bland bland bland, tastes likes dried paste, horrible. There's a list of ingredients on each package of the stuff they 'don't' put in there like eggs, sugar, etc. Well maybe they should realize that those ingredients are 'what' makes a good cookie. I won't try anything from them again.

review/summary: The devil is in the details...
review/text: Love these cookies. They taste wonderful. No trans fat, vegan, Kosher, healthy ingredients. So what's my gripe? If you look at the nutrition label on the back of the cookie package carefully, notice that a serving is 1/2 a cookie. And, 1/2 a cookie is 210 calories (different from the info on the Amazon site, but I'm looking at the package right now -- same product, current package). So, if you eat the whole cookie (I dare you to stop at 1/2. I know I can't! I tried.), you've eaten a 420-calorie cookie. Wow. That's a lot. Sorry to burst the bubble. I take one of these to work every once in awhile to eat for lunch (and 420 calories is a large lunch for me), but that's the only way I can eat them. I bought these not realizing they'd counted the cookie as two servings (which is pretty sneaky, IMO), and relied on the Amazon site info, which needs to be updated to reflect current package count. Great cookies, but if calories factor in for you, beware.

review/text: I've tried a few types of vegan chocolate chip cookies and was always disappointed with how bland they were--and loaded with fat and calories.  These are not only the least amount of calories that I've seen for a vegan cookie of this size, but I found that these double chocolate chip cookies were better than the non-vegan ones I've had in the past!  They are so, so, so good.  Whoever said that you need dairy and eggs in chocolate?  I have my omnivore friends and family try these cookies to show them that I am FAR from deprived!  Two thumbs up and highly recommended from this vegan chocoholic.

review/text: The chocolate crunch is my favorite of the gluten-free Nana's cookies, though the lemon is pretty good too.  I have a feeling the person who gave these 1 star is someone who can eat a freakin' cinnabon if she wants to.  For those of us who have dietary restrictions, it's a different story.<br /><br />It does take a while to get used to gluten free fare, but these cookies are among the best I've had, which is pretty impressive since they don't even have sugar in them.  And the fact that they don't have gluten, eggs, nuts, or dairy in them either is wonderful (yes, there are those of us out there allergic to all these things).  I just wish more stores carried them.  But now that I've found them on Amazon, I'll be ordering in bulk. ;)

review/text: I am very salt sensitive and search to find helathy low sodium products.  On a recent trip to San Diego, I happened to find Nana's Oatmeal sunflower cookies.  It is a meal in a cookie!  It tastes good, moist and wholesome and very filling.  I have ordered a large quantity and carry some with me, so I always have something to eat when I can't find low sodium food.  Routinely, I eat one a day along with a serving of fruit, either for breakfast or lunch. It has been a wonderful find!!

review/text: As one of many Americans trying to make healthier life choices in my food, Nana's cookies have been a wonderful treat without the guilt and bad effects of sugar, and gluten.  The cookies are moist and almost cake-like and sweetened with fruit juice, though the rich and vibrant flaver does not give this away.  The ginger and lemon cookies will fool even the most sophisticated cookie palate.  Give them a try and treat yourself to a healthy dessert you can enjoy without feeding your body excess sugar, carbs, and processed chemicals.  It is all natural ingredients, with a wonderfully sinful flavor.<br /><br />Kristin, mother of 3, Arizona

review/text: This product is a celiac's dream!  Nana's no gluten cookies have by far the most consistent texture of any gluten free cookies that I have tried (including my own homemade).  They are hardly distinguishable from a wheat-based cookie.  They are extremely soft, and, accordingly, some flavors do tend to be a tad "crumbly", e.g. ginger.  Lemon is not crumbly.

As one of the other reviewers pointed out you have to have a particular palate to enjoy this type of cookie.  For those of use that try to limit our processed cane sugar intake or have particular dietary restrictions...vegan, sugar substitutes, etc. these are really delicious and allow a taste of that bad for you diet that we've been led to believe we want.  Thanks Nana's for the natural foodie options.
