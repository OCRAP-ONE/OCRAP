review/summary: Organic Goodness for Less!
review/text: These dried cherries are delicious and the 4 oz bags are a great size for snacking.  I love that the tartness is balanced by organic apple juice instead of sugar, so I can enjoy the sweetness without the sugar-high guilt.  They are so plump and delicious.  And because they don't have any sulfites or other additives, they're much easier for my stomach to handle than non-organic dried fruit.<br /><br />Also, after reading the reviews here, I researched just what exactly "transitional organic" means.  As others have commented, it just means that the farm that grows them hasn't produced organic food for enough time (3 years) to be considered "certifiably organic" yet by the USDA.  According to what I've read, though, buying from farms that aren't certified yet allows the consumer to get the organic food at cheaper prices, which I'm all for! Plus, I'd like to support companies that are making the making the transition to becoming certifiably organic by the USDA, which takes time and money.<br /><br />I'll definitely order these again, and update my subscription on Amazon so that I get them more frequently.

review/text: The flavor of these cherries is excellent...my favorite of the various ones I've tried with Amazon. They are plump and tart and you don't taste the apple juice.  This whole organic thing is a non issue - they explain it on their web site.  The cherries are being transitioned to organic.  I recommend them highly and will buy more.

review/summary: best dried tart cherries I've had
review/text: These cherries are nice and plump and moist, and taste great. I have tried some other brands but definitely prefer these. Some brands give you dried out hulks of cherries, that have no taste. These  are wonderful. I eat them alone, I eat them mixed with nuts, and I eat them in cooked cereals like oatmeal.

review/summary: Montmorency Cherries
review/text: I love these flavorful organic dried cherries with my favorite granola and Greek yogurt, sometimes for breakfast and sometimes as a snack before bed. I like their tart flavor compared with the sweeter Bing cherries.  Since cherries are a natural source of tryptophan (a trigger for melatonin), I like them as a snack before bed, too. They dress up and add a delightful flavor to a green salad as well.

review/summary: We love these; great for 'trail mix'
review/text: My 4 yr old discovered these at WHole Foods as we were looking for some things to make trail mix.  We started eating them in the store and loved them.  Love them so much that I looked on amazon to see if we could get a better price because they are not inexpensive!  The savings on amazon was decent and I really like being able to utilize the subscribe & save option which saves an additional 15%.  I don't believe they are organic, but I've had good experiences with EDEN products and these are terrific mixed with nuts and cacao nibs (we like the Navitas brand).  My only complaint is that I wish I could get them in bulk so I wasn't wasting all the little re-sealable packets. Enjoy!

review/summary: Not quite the best
review/text: The Eden Organic Dried Montmorency Cherries are incredibly sour; in acuality, the Eden cherries have a more pungent taste to them with an astonishing tangy flavor. The Montmorency cherries are obviously super tart by nature and the addition of apple juice for a sweetener gives them a powerful punch of zest with an undesired aftertaste of a cherry flavored vinegar.<br /><br />The Montmorency cherries definitely require the consumer to aquire a special taste for their pungent yumminess if that is what you desire. In my opinion the Montmorency cherres simply are not palatable and unfotunately a waste of delicious cherries.<br /><br />However, don't let the unappetizing Montmorency cherriesvstifle your quest for a good dried cherry. I'm not a cherry connoisseur and hsd to play a game of trial and error with the dried fruit until I found a good bite. My search ended when I ordered the The Traverse Bay Fruit Co. Dried Cherries. These cherries our unbelievably delectable! Unlike the Eden cherries, the Traverse Bay cherries are not bound by the pungent flavor locked inside them.<br /><br />The Traverse Bay Fruit Co. Dried Cherries fell into what I like to refer to as the "Goldilocks Zone", a medium where the cherries aren't to sour yet aren't to sweet, they aren't to dry yet aren't to mosit; they are juuuust right. The cherries were virtually flawless to be truthful. The taste is definitely unique, it begins with a snappy tartness as you first bite in and then precedes to get sweet and ultimately envelop the mouth with gushing saliva as they literally make your mouth water. The texture is that of a raisin although the cherries are not dry and gritty like some raisins. It is almost likev a cherry jolly rancher married to raisin.

review/summary: Deceptive marketing! Not organic cherries
review/text: Amazon needs to make Eden change the title of this product. The pestisides used on cherries are dangerous to those with weak immune systems. Amazon never has a clear picture of the ingredients so it is very important that vendors not lie about something being organic. Go with peeled cherry-go-round or bare fruit.

review/summary: My favorite green tea--gorgeous color, fabulous iced!
review/text: I discovered this tea last winter during a dinner out to a pricey, gourmet Asian fusion restaurant. When I asked for iced tea, I got served THIS is a bottle. Despite the crazy price they had, I ordered another cause it rocked my taste buds. I decided to make the iced tea myself from the tea bags, and it's just as good0--if not better--than the bottled version.<br /><br />This has a beautiful fruity flavor, an exquisitely eye-pleasing red color, and while it's delicious hot, it totally kills over ice. I can't get enough of it.<br /><br />I fortunately found it at a local Fresh Market, but if no store has it in your area, definitely order it online. So worth it. You get the benefit of green tea with the amazingly uplifting flavor and color of pomegranate.  YUM!!!

review/summary: half of the bag is amazing
review/text: These chips are quite literally a mixed bag.  If not for the yucca chips (I think it's the yuccas), this would be a solid 5 star bag of chips.  The problem with the yucca chips is that they are very hard and difficult to chew.  The reviewer below who complained of jaw problems after eating them was not off the mark.  I had minor jaw pain myself after eating them.  I am not sure why, but half to most of the bag consists of these undesired tooth killers.  They are also the chips with the least flavor out of the bunch, so I'm guessing they are also the cheapest to produce.  It's a shame, because the yuccas are really dragging this bag of chips down and keeping me from recommending it.  Get with it, Terra!

review/summary: Possibly the best chips I've ever had
review/text: These are indeed some of the best chips I've ever had, but there's a caveat. One of the types of chip in the bag is much harder than the rest, sometimes almost painfully hard if your teeth or gums catch it just right. It's the light, semi-translucent chip, the yuca I think. Anyway, this would be a 5-star product without a doubt if that chip was removed or replaced. The others though are worlds above any name-brand chips or potato chips out there. Another good thing is what it lacks; no artificial preservatives, no cholesterol, very little sodium and very little carbohydrates. They are certainly a welcome break from all the garbage sitting on store shelves, in taste and in health.

The plain is good but the Mediterranean flavor is my favorite.  Spicy, flavorful, crunchy but not too hard.  Not greasy, either.  The price on Amazon is substantially cheaper than grocery stores as well.  These aren't leaner than your typical potato chip but they are higher in fiber and overall nutritional value.

They are as hard as rocks.  I bought 12 bags a few months ago and still have about 5 left.  For each bag, I can eat about 1/3 (those red and orange chips and taro are not too bad).  The rest of the bag is thrown away because those translucent chips are as hard as rock.  Maybe some people like this kind of chips.  Do yourselves a favor and try some at the grocery first before buying in bulk.

review/summary: Great alternative chips, these are a winner!
review/text: The last couple of months I've been buying the Terra Blue chips, in the small bags,  Which is such a good idea, I like the fact I know how many calories i am eating,  Well, Amazon was out of the Terra Blue so I thought I  would give these a try and I am glad I did, They're very good,  I like the variety of different chips in the bag, all which are yummy.  Very yummy,  And a super alternative to potato for those of us who are encouraged to rotate our foods,  I'll definitely be reordering these,  They're my favorite now,

review/summary: Super crispy, light on the waistline
review/text: These chips are truly unique. Naturally colored with beet juice, they are festive and great for entertaining. They are super crisp and thin - and not greasy at all. When you first bite into them, it's almost chocking - they're totally chewable, but stronger than typical chips - so when you first bite into one, it's like you're biting into thin glass - it's almost shocking - but good nonetheless. Tasty and light.

review/summary: Good potato chip alternative
review/text: I had some of these Terra chips for the first time a few weeks ago and was honestly surprised by how good they were! I have since tried the Original, Mediterranean, and Sweets and Beets flavors. I liked them all, so I'm looking forward to trying even more of the flavors in the future. There are a variety of root vegetable chips in each bag (varies based on what flavor you buy). I like all the veggie chips I've had, though some are harder than others. Terra chips have a great texture--crunchy like regular potato chips rather than soft and chewy like most dried fruits/veggies. This makes them a great alternative to chips with more nutritional value. I really like them and enjoy having them for a snack now and then. I like the Mediterranean flavor best out of the ones I've tried so far, but they are all really good.

review/summary: Love these Chips - Beware of Sodium
review/text: I love these chips a whole lot! This is also a great deal for them on subscribe and save when I compared it to the normal price I pay per bag in the store. The chips are yummy and taste natural. Some are very crunchy and a little hard to bite so I would not recommend these for elderly individuals or people who need or prefer softer food. My only issue with these chips is that they seem a little salty. Most people I let try them kept commenting on the sodium level as well. I kinda love salt, and don't plan on giving it up too much right now, so they are great to me! The sodium is just a warning for those who are watching their intake to do their research.

review/text: These chips are wonderful, and come in cute little servings. I'm on a diet and find it a lot easier to moderate my consumption with smaller bags of chips. On top of that, they stay fresher, longer. The flavor is fantastic, especially if you are looking for something like potato chips but with a little more flair and flavor. Highly recommend.

review/summary: Buy in smaller batches
review/text: These chips are very, very good. They are flavorful and crispy and some have a great texture. Some, not all. Unfortunately, about half of the chips are extremely hard to the point where no one in my house will eat them. They are so hard, it's almost impossible to crunch through them! It may have been a looming expiration date (I bought 12 of the large bags about three months ago) but as I noticed each new bag having more and more hard chips, I quickly gave them all away thinking that at least someone should enjoy them before they completely go bad because there was no way I would get around to eating that many by myself. So I can't check to see if that was the problem or not but after seeing how many reviews talk about this issue, I'm thinking it's pretty prevalent.<br /><br />My suggestion would be to find a single bag to purchase because while buying in bulk tends to be cheaper, you're just wasting money if you end up throwing a bunch away because it's gone stale.<br /><br />But other than the staleness, I LOVE these chips!

review/summary: Love the Original and Mediterranean Flavor
review/text: I've been a fan of these chips for years. They have a unique combination of sweet potatoes, beets, yucca , taro, parsnips and batata which provide a different combination of crunch compared to plain old potato chips.  I notice the bags are now advertising that there is a full serving of vegetables in every ounce (I never noticed this claim before) but I wouldn't consider them that much healthier than other types of potato chips.<br /><br />What the unique combination of root vegetables do  provide is a variation of color, crunch and flavor. I'm not a fan of the hard red beets, after biting into one I've actually chipped a tooth but I do enjoy the rest.<br /><br />Mediterranean is my favorite, the flavor is outstanding as it's tangy, salty and slightly sweet.<br /><br />The Terra chips maybe junk food but they are up scale junk food with the variation of colors and "exotic" root vegetables and would fit in as perfectly as an appetizer at a social event as they do just straight out of the bag.

Their wonderful. I could do without the really soft stuff. I guess it's totally up to you to get them and try. I definitely would recommend these. I'd also buy these yucca chips in a bag all there own. That's how much I like them:)

This is my fault, and it is still a good deal, but I would be happier if they were the big bags. The snack size bags are convenient and neat though. It would also help if they did not expire so soon.

review/text: These are great chips.  I buy the 24 pack and they are wonderful for lunches.  Every bag is a bit different and there is one chip I'm not crazy about (the white chip, parsnip maybe?), but there are never that many in any bag so it doesn't bother me.  My favorite is the sweet potato and the ruby taro.  All are crispy without being hard and only slightly salty.  You get the flavor of the vegetables and not just salt and grease like some chips.  Delicious.

review/summary: 1 serving of fat, 1 serving of carbs, and 3 grams fiber :)
review/text: I absolutely love Terra chips.  I have ever since I tried them on a Jet Blue flight.  They have great vegetables that are low in carbohydrates and high in fiber.  The only downside to these is that the fat is on the high end of the scale.  Only 1 gram is saturated, but there are 9 grams total.<br /><br />They are delicious and great in moderation, but for an everyday snack I don't think so.  Something that has more than 50% of all calories derived from fat is not an everyday thing.  Maybe 1 or 2 times a week.  But if you are trying to watch your calories and want to indulge every once in a while. Great product!!!

review/text: These chips are excellent.  I bought them to supplement my weight loss diet with vegetables, however.  I agree it is hard to put them down so if you are allowed only a 150 calorie snack or veggie serving on your diet you will need to have the restraint to measure out a quarter of a 4oz bag or about an 1/8th of these bigger bags and put the rest away.  They are soooo good though it's worth the try.

These are perfect presentation wise for a get-together because of the color variety and texture; they look and taste good! I give them 5 thumbs up! Once you try them you'll be hooked too. A word to those with dentures or sensitive teeth; this may not be the chip for you because some of the chips are REALLY REALLY crunchy.

review/text: I thought this one would be better than the blue potato that I tried 3 months ago as it has better review/rating, but it turned out to be a bad one. I am not sure if it became that hard to chew just because it is expiring in 1 month, but it hurt my teeth and jaw after finishing half of the first bag. My jaw became clicking sound and I had to see my doctor after eating this. I think three forth of the chips in each bag are those hard ones. Now, the remaining became the feeding food for the squirrels. Conclusion: 2 problems: (1) those 24 bags are expiring in one month; and (2) most of the chips are too hard to bite.

review/summary: Very Good
review/text: I have nothing but praise for this item.  I was afraid some of the cups would be broken because of some reviews I read but I received mine all perfect and in a really good time.  They were wrapped in a good package which looked as if it could protect the chocolate from rough treatment.  Also they added a cold freezer pack but it was thawed and warm by the time I received my box.  It must have kept the chocolate cold enough for long enough to have reached me unharmed.  I tasted one (because I could not resist) and it was delish!!!  Thanks to the folks who packed my chocolate cordial cups.  Good job!  Now if I can stop myself eating them all before my Mother's Day tea.  lol

review/text: Birthday gift for my dear friend's 100th year celebration. I thought that the Art of Appreciation Gift basket would be a good gift for such a momentous event of celebrating a 100th birthday. Feedback from my friend was that the "gourmet food" was so dry that neither she nor her guests could eat it so they fed it to the birds! Needless to say, I will not purchase any more products in the food line from Amazon nor its providers. I am so disappointed and feel so badly for my 100 hundred year old friend! I gave it a 1 because there is no zero!

review/summary: Serious Rip OFF! Avoid
review/text: I sent this to my son at school for his birthday and saw it in person when visiting him later. It  is unbelievably dinky. Another reviewer said the boxes were really small and I should have actually checked the dimensions before ordering. The smallest box is about 3" in diameter, the largest  no more than 6-8". The "balloons" on top are actually tiny pompoms, smaller than a ping pong ball. The "streamers" are just thin ribbons. The top box holds individually packaged hard candy, maybe 10 pieces. Middle box has a small package of tarted up popcorn, about the size of your hand. The largest box has a very small package (half your hand) of white covered pretzels, another package, same size, of small cookies, and a small box (about the size of your hand) of "savory crackers". My son was appalled that this cost $50. So am I. Don't give this to anybody unless you want them to think you are a serious cheapskate.

review/summary: Refuting the 2-Star Review.
review/text: Not trying to start an online debate, but I fear the previous 2-star review is discouraging many consumers from buying this product for no good reason. I have been feeding my dogs Holistic Select for about a year after switching from Purina  Beneful (which IS one of the unhealthy dog foods referred to in the 2-star review). I have seen noticeable improvement in their coat, skin, muscle mass and energy levels, not to mention more consistent and less waste matter. Those who read the above review, please do your own research before taking this reviewer for their word. Holistic Select is most definitely a premium dog food. I completed quite a bit of research between Holistic Select, Orijen and Lotus brand dog foods, and though Orijen proved to have higher protein content (which is best for most breeds), I decided on Holistic Select Lamb because my Dalmatian requires lower protein due to an inadequate ability to process purines which results in kidney stone formation.<br />So, to those reading, yes the above review is extremely accurate for most retail store brand dog foods, (even when marked "natural"), but I would not classify Holistic Select in the same category as those.  Do your research. The Dog Food Advisor ([...]) is a great place to start comparing dog food brands. A food description and ingredient breakdown is provided for each brand listed, along with a 1-5 star rating. Holistic Select Dry Dog Food received 4-stars out of 5, classifying it as a premium dog food, while Purina Beneful Dry received 1-star.  Reference the links below:<br />[...]

review/summary: Worth the price
review/text: Our female Ridgeback pup didn't have the iron gut the breed is know for, and quality lamb or fowl- based foods continued to cause loose, very smelly stool and a gassy dog.  (We measure and feed, wetted, twice daily.) At around six months a friend (and pet supply store owner) put me in touch with his dog expert.  She suggested this Holistic Select food.  We've used both the duck and seafood mixes, but now stick with the seafood mix.  Her stool immediately firmed up to a surprisingly firm and almost odor free (!) state. No more gas.  Her coat is beautiful, I mean strikingly. We've used it for almost a year now.  No fish breath issues, but we're sushi lovers anyway...<br />So, taking all that into consideration, and if you don't overfeed your dog and waste food, the price is in-line.  I got cheap a month or so ago and bought a slightly cheaper salmon-yam mix by another manufacturer and noticed immediate effects.  I'm back on track.

review/text: Holistic Select Radiant Adult Health, Lamb Meal Dry Dog Food came highly recommended by our Rhodesian Ridgeback breeder. The man has done extensive research to find the best dog food available for the breed he so dearly loves and in his opinion this dog food is IT.<br /><br />We first started our dog out on the 'LARGE $ GIANT BREED" puppy food by Holistic Select and around age 8-9 months we switched to the adult version. We serve this dog food twice a day with warm water and add a fish oil capsule and probiotics to it. With his dinner our dog also gets 1 tbs of canned Holistic Select as a special treat.<br /><br />Our Rhodesian Ridgeback is a happy and content dog, his coat looks awesome and up to now he never has had any problems with his digestion.<br /><br />Being able to buy this large bag of dog food at Amazon is awesome and a great deal. The cheapest I can find this dog food in a local store is $50 and then I have to drive to and from the store and haul the big bag myself. Thank to Amazon this huge bag is now delivered at my doorstep.

review/text: To DS Rizzi<br /><br />You might want to consider some other venue for your [yes, justifiable] rant on conventional dog foods...but please don't leave a low rating here when you aren't even referring to this product. This is an excellent dog food with high-quality ingredients and does not deserve your "wrathful" generalizations. It has changed my mini-schnauzer's life...no more itching, biting, or scratching from allergies, and no GI problems or loose stools [unless she gets into the cat food.] She likes the duck version the best, has almost stopped begging for human food, and we have gotten her quickly back to her ideal weight. She will eat a few kibbles at a time now--like she is enjoying and savoring her food--instead of just sucking it down like a Hoover. I am inclined to attribute that to the nutritional value of this food and its ability to actually supply her body with what it needs.

review/summary: It all comes down to reading the ingredient label.
review/text: Selecting a healthy dog food is just like selecting healthy food for yourself:  You have to read the label.  You're want specifically named sources of protein like "chicken" or "chicken meal" and  you do not want things like "meat byproduct."  You also want to avoid corn or soy, which is used as a filler to make the volume of the dog food appear greater to the human feeding the dog, but since dogs can't digest corn, it comes out the other end at best and causes digestive tract problems at worst.  Neither the "Holistic"label nor the relatively high price is what makes this dog food a good dog food.  It comes down to the ingredients:<br /><br />Lamb Meal, Ground Brown Rice, Ground White Rice, Chicken Fat (Preserved with Natural Mixed Tocopherols), Oatmeal, Dried Beet Pulp, Flaxseed, Dried Egg Product, Carrots, Sun-Cured Alfalfa, Peas, Potassium Chloride, Organic Quinoa, Apples, Blueberries, Cranberries, Dried Kelp, Taurine, Yucca Schidigera Extract, DL-Methionine, Vitamins [Beta-Carotene, Vitamin A Supplement, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Vitamin E Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Vitamin B12 Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Niacin Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Mononitrate, Folic Acid, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Biotin], Minerals [Polysaccharide Complexes of Zinc, Iron, Manganese and Copper, Cobalt Carbonate, Potassium Iodate, Sodium Selenite], Choline Chloride, Lecithin, Rosemary Extract, Glucosamine Hydrochloride, Inulin, Dried Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus niger Fermentation Products, Mixed Tocopherols (a natural preservative).<br /><br />Hey, if I wasn't a vegetarian I may even consider eating this stuff (don't try this at home, kids).<br /><br />I have two dogs: a 65 lb. senior husky and a 25 lb. young jack russell mix.  I admit, this food is expensive compared to grocery store brands BUT I have found that it is worth it because it cuts expenses in the long run.  For example:  (1) You feed less.  My husky eats about 2.25 cups a day of this food.  If we were to feed her one of the vet brands or grocery brands she would need to eat almost twice that much.  (2) Your dogs will have fewer health problems to treat.  When my jack russell mix started having runny, bloody stools, the vet  diagnosed him with colitis and put him on a prescription vet brand dog food, the first ingredient of which was CORN.  When that didn't work, she continued him on the diet and prescribed medication.  I suspected he may have a corn allergy so I switched him to the chicken formula Holistic Select.  Within 24 hours my dog returned to solid, blood-free stool. I never gave him the medication and he switched vets after that.  (3) This food was not subject to the recall of bad food that sickened so many dogs a few years ago.<br /><br />It is worth noting that this dog food is not grain free, which many dogs benefit from.  For that I recommend Innova Evo, which is what I used to feed my husky when she was younger and more active.  This has fewer calories for the more sedentary pup she's become.

review/summary: For a dog with sensitivity to chicken...
review/text: Living on an island with very limited access to premium dog foods, I rely heavily on ordering from Amazon and especially the Super Saver Shipping to make taking care of our pets affordable.  Recently, Amazon stopped offering SSS on a lot of the dog foods that I had loved and that were really working for my 40# mixed breed dog who is sensitive to chicken.  Since the cost of most of those foods doubled because of shipping, I decided to try Holistic Select to mix with her grain-free, venison- and fish-based foods to extend our supply.  She's been doing really well for the last three months on a blend of half Holistic Select, and half higher-quality foods.  She seems to really enjoy her meals still, so the taste must be okay.  I understand that there is some chicken in this food, but it is not a top ingredient and she hasn't had many problems from it.  I have noticed that she requires a bit more food now than before, and her waste is "bulkier," too, so it is apparent to me that there are more fillers in this food than I would like.  However, it has been a very good solution for us while we work on an alternative source of the foods we would prefer.  It has also worked very well for a friend who wanted to find a healthier food than she could find at the supermarkets, but isn't ready to make the leap to premium pet foods.  Her dog has been very happy and seems to be thriving since the change.

review/text: My dog had minor GI system issues and wasn't excited about her food, but when she went to my parents' house she'd steal their dogs' Duck Meal food (my parents had switched to it because their lab had allergies and the vet suggested it). Once I switched to Holistic Select, her GI issues were gone and now she gobbles it up as soon as it hits the bowl. I never intended to buy fancy food for my pet, but it's also nice to know her food doesn't have scary additives in it. This brand can be hard to find in normal pet stores so I'm glad Amazon sells it and with SuperSaver shipping!

It turns out that you can serve much less for the same amount of nutrition as all the other popular brands so 30lb. goes for two months for my 45 lb dog!  I keep ordering online from Amazon and my ordering records show an order every two months.  Shows up in two days delivered! The veterinarian always comments on my dog's healthy coat and leanness. I only wish it could be on the subscription feature so that it would automatically be ordered and worry free, but there are more important things in life to worry about, right!?

review/summary: Excellent product!
review/text: I adopted a pug several months ago. I was told that she suffered from "itchy butt" which is common in pugs. I was given some allergy pills and told I should give them to her whenever I noticed her trying to scratch herself. I'm not really the type of person who likes to dish out the meds if they aren't really needed so, I figured I would try to change her diet and see if that helped. My  veterinarian recommended that fish oils might help with the itchiness. After doing a lot of research online I decided to give Holsitic Selects a shot. I used to have boxers and always fed them Eagle Pack which they did very well on so I thought this sister brand would be a safe bet. It turns out that it was. My dog loves the food and has not needed any kind of allergy pill in months. People are always commenting on how soft her coat is too. I have also started giving their feline formula to our cats who seem to enjoy it as well. Another great thing about this food is that it is made in the USA and they use all USA grown ingredients which was a huge reason why I chose them. Also, if you join their online community they send you coupons every month for $3-$5 off a bag of dry food and a few $$$ off of wet food or treats too.

review/text: Athena my toy fox terrier was having a lot of problems with chewing on her feet, course hair and noisy scratching just after she turned two. She had always shed a lot. If you wore a black shirt her white hair would cover you. If you wore a white one her 3 inch patch of black fur was enough to cover you in black fur. I was about to make a vet appt. for the chewing and itching. I stopped at a dog food store and was just going to pick up a good dog brush for the shedding. The salesman asked what was wrong and then guided me to this food. She didn't love it at first but loved the dog treats. I think the treats hooked her on the food. No more chewing after about a week. Hardly no scratching and her shedding is less then 1/4 of what it used to be. Not to mention people now comment on how soft she is. I love this food. However for a dog that has NEVER had bad breath she now has fish breath. Thus the four stars.

review/summary: Excellent Quality; my dogs LOVE it!
review/text: I have 5-7 dogs at any given time, sometimes feeding as many as 4 different foods at once. I show dogs in AKC conformation and foster rescue dogs. I look for a high-grade kibble that meets each of their dietary needs, keeps them in optimal condition (skin/coat) and most importantly, that they will eat! I have one dog that will only eat small bites, and several other dogs that are FINICKY.  I tried it on a whim (can you say SALE) and now I LOVE LOVE LOVE this food...Sure, it may seem expensive, but I believe if you feed a high-quality food you save money on vet bills down the road and help insure your pets longevity.  My dogs look and feel great after 6 months on it. I've fed MANY brands of high-grade kibble over the years, this one takes the cake.

After reading some reviews, I had hoped for a miraculous cure for her scratching and foot chewing, but instead got a slight improvement over time.<br /><br />I highly recommend signing up at their website. They routinely give out $3 off coupons and sometimes have special offers for $5 off (for which you might have to complete a survey or "like" them on Facebook, for instance). Being on their email list has not generated any junk mail for me. They seem to only send out an email once or twice a month which is well within my tolerance.<br /><br />On a whim I bought some of Holistic Select's dog biscuits and my dog absolutely loves them, more than any treat I've tried. She likes them better than Little Jacs. They are maybe tied with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00188ZDZU">Holistic Select Salmon Recipe Natural Dog Treats, 6-Ounce Bag</a>. The treats I bought are not yet offered on amazon. They are called Holistic Select Wheat Free Holistix with Whitefish, Cranberries, Apples & Blueberries Natural Biscuits for Dogs. They are easy to break in half for using as rewards.

review/text: A premium holistic dog food.  My last two dogs lived to be 18-19 years of age.  Amazon makes it easy for us to locate a supplier of this food.

review/summary: My PICKY dogs will eat it!!! no higher praise....
review/text: Super picky poodle... doesn't eat dog food (folks say if you don't give them anything else they will eat what you give them, not true in this case, tried...) &lt;shrug> he loves this food... He eats it on a daily basis - which is great as he was a rescue who previously had human food and I battled the food issue for years before finding this.  Great product!

review/summary: Holistic Select and Amazon Prime = A+
review/text: We have four dogs and they have done very well with the Holistic Select line.  It's a bit more money but if you look at the ingredient list, you'll see why.  Our dogs have not had digestive issues and their skin and coat are healthy. I am also a happy camper for not having to drag a big, bulky and heavy bag from the store to car to home.  The product is priced right and shipped super fast.  Amazon Prime is so worth it especially if you order a lot of stuff online.

review/summary: Excellent dog food
review/text: After a rash of pet food recalls about seven years ago we went searching for a brand that was not involved in recalls--and that's how we ended up with Holistic Select.  Never a regret, it's an awesome dog food.  And as it turns out, not only has our dog done well, but she thrives on the hypoallergenic duck and oatmeal type.

review/summary: Has solved our dog's alergy and GI tract problems 100%
review/text: Our Husky/Shepherd mix had ongoing GI tract issues, including bleeding out of the rectum and very seriously inflamed lower GI tract (as viewed on a scope). Poor little guy went through so many drugs, and "prescription" alergy-dog-foods and just could not seem to solve it.<br /><br />Then researched Eagle Pack and moved him onto this as it was heavily fed by Northern dog racers with similar breeds to ours.<br />"Eagle Pack" was prior brand name before it changed over to "Holistic Select" - but same product.<br /><br />GI issues went away, and our troubled-eater, barfer, bloody-diarrhea pooch is now healthy, happy, and has a great appetite and energy. Yes, it is more expensive, but if you compare the ingredients they are top notch.<br /><br />I cannot say enough about this dry food for solving these issues. My review applies specifically to the Anchovy/Sardine/Salmon recipe.
