review/summary: Awesome find!
review/text: I've been using these since the 90's for my workouts.  Just one keeps away dry mouth, which is a workout killer.  One is good for like an hour.  These seem to be disappearing from all the places I shop and seem really hard to find anymore.  Thanks to Amazon I'm now loaded up!  These are the best.  Not too sweet, just sweet enough, with a little spice. I think they're just a perfect tool for my diabetes. One mint has 2g sugar and 5 calories. Plus, they're perfect for spontaneous flirting!

review/summary: Delighted to find cinnamon Certs at last.
review/text: Cinnamon Certs have been  my favorite breath mint for ages, but they have become increasingly difficult to find in the stores.  My local drug stores and Dollar Tree used to be my source, but they all have ceased carrying cinnamon Certs.  Once again the internet came to the rescue, and I was able to replenish my supply of this favorite.  This is the second time I have purchased them through Amazon.  They are always fresh, and in perfect condition (no broken pieces).

review/summary: Bad batch.
review/text: I recently purchased a couple of cases of this when Amazon had it on sale.  I'd never tried it before, but since it's healthy, I thought I'd give it a whirl and pawn it off on somebody else if I didn't like it.  When I opened my first bottle, I thought it had a really strange, fermented taste and smell -- yes, sadly, I tried a sip of it -- and had a lot of thick, gooey pulp.<br /><br />I contacted the manufacturer @ (415) 775-6355 and asked them if this was normal.  Apparently, they had a bad batch with their old manufacturing plant where the bottles were not being sealed properly and have since spoiled.  She asked me some questions about the bottle, got some order numbers and cap numbers from me, and they are sending me out some replacement cases.  They were very friendly, apologetic and helpful.  So if you get some from Amazon and the taste seems to be off, I'd encourage you to call them and let them rectify the situation for you.

review/summary: Zola lives up to it's claims.....
review/text: I had read several articles proclaiming the wonders of Acia juice... Skeptical?..of course.  The price was somewhat prohibitive but I found it on the shelf of a local health food store and decided to give it a try.  At first the taste was quite strange...fermented like wine(but I got used to it and actually enjoy it..).  The juice is not a smooth drink it includes some pulp( not like you're drinking oatmeal)so there is definitely texture. My interest lay in the fact that it promoted weight loss ... result...it has increased my weight loss slightly BUT it has resolved bloating and bouts of constipation and fatigue.  Although I am not losing weight by leaps and bounds the resolution of the other 3 issues gave me more than enough positive evidence to continue using Zola.  I do have hope that someone out there will have a generous sale on this product =)<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015VVS2M">Zola Original Acai Superfruit Juice, 12-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Interesting taste, I like it
review/text: I wanted to taste it just because I like to taste new stuff, and because it is claimed to be "superfood". I liked the taste and now I drink this one or ONE Acai nearly every day, just because I like the taste and because it's conveniently delivered to me by Amazon's subscription.<br /><br />I buy tons of stuff on Amazon and rarely write reviews, but I remember when I first open this web-page I hesitated to buy, because there were a lot of negative reviews. I finally bought it out of curiosity, and was prepared for something awful. It turned out to be one of my favorite drinks. So I thought it would be fair for the product if I write a review.<br /><br />I gave it to other people to taste, and most people liked it. Like with any food, there are personal preferences. Some people drink coffee, some don't. So my advice is - ignore any review (positive and negative). If you want to taste it, taste it.<br /><br />P.S. I'm not telling that Acai juice is any better than let's say blueberry juice. It's just that I like variety, and that Amazon delivers this one to me. I would enjoy Amazon having more natural berry juices available for delivery.<br />P.P.S. Amazon, please, resume selling the Acai+Blueberry juice from Zola. I liked it the most out of Original/+Blueberry/+Pineapple, and you took it out...

review/summary: Hit and miss - Quality control seems to be a disaster
review/text: I'd rate this drink 5 stars because I've loved it so much that I've "subscribed" to have it delivered at least every month, it's always been my tasty treat in the morning or to finish off a day. I absolutely loved it.<br /><br />Lately, though, I've been getting cases of the stuff full of bottles with foul-tasting fluids. I mean, RANCID. Make you gag stuff. And not just occasionally. With my most recent case, I drank the first one (squinty-eyeed, I figured it must be something I ate or drank before it) and had indigestion all day, the next two I threw out completely. The fourth one, I have here, and it has a slight foul aftertaste but it's mostly the same delicious sweet juice I originally enjoyed, so I'm drinking it.<br /><br />The frequency of these had me motivated to post here.<br /><br />I also noticed that, at least I think, they've been tinkering with their recipe. Besides the new packaging, I think they changed some ingredients out. The second ingredient is "organic evap cane juice". Cane juice? As in, sugar? I think the Zola I fell in love with several months ago was naturally sweetened by the fruit itself, not by added sugar.<br /><br />Overall, the drink is now okay. But I'm cancelling my auto-order "subscription".

review/summary: Tastes good, healthy, not sure about energy benefits
review/text: I bought 2 cases of this and have finished both of them.  Taste is very good and I enjoyed having one in the morning and another in the afternoon.  Can't honestly say that I felt any substantial energy boost, it was more of a subtle boost.  It's supposed to give you a sustained energy level as opposed to the quick pickup and subsequent drop that energy drinks normally give.  Personally I don't think it has helped my energy level that much so it's mostly the good taste and healthy nutritional profile that made me boost the rating up to 4 stars.<br /><br />I bought this in large part because of the subscribe and save discount along with an additional discount code they have during March.  Not sure if I would continue ordering without an additional discount but I just ordered the acai-blueberry flavor today while the discount is still active.  I'm hoping the acai-blueberry tastes at least as good as this original acai version.

review/summary: Better than coffee
review/text: I really enjoy this product and have been buying at my local supermarket for about a year and a half.  Amazon saves me only a few dollars on a case, but the convenience of having it shipped to my house is what really makes the difference.  It tastes good, but the little seeds can make it seem gritty.  I don't personally mind, but I know a few that do.  The real reason why I drink it is the way it makes me feel.  I can really tell a difference and it's almost tingly.

review/text: Had this on auto ship when it was available in its old packaging.  It was often out of stock and when it did not return I was crushed.  I have looked far and wide for a comparable product with no success and I am elated to find Zola again!  This is by far my favorite acai and faithful friend for a quick and enjoyable pick-up without the unpleasant effects of other "energy" drinks or coffee.  The pulp does offer a gritty texture but shaking the bottle periodically makes this less noticeable. I love this product and the pulp is a wonderfully unique part of the experience.  Wish my order was here already!!

review/text: I have purchased this numerous times at Wholefoods so I was very happy to find a cheaper deal here on Amazon. As I have had acai drinks before for therapeutic purposes, I found that this particular brand did not have the same cleansing effect that other acai drinks have. This leads me to suspect there isn't much acai juice in it. Well, at least it tastes alright. Please note that this juice has more sediment than your average American strained juice.

review/summary: Best Acai juice on the market - but no longer with guarana
review/text: UPDATED 8/3/12<br /><br />I may be a little late to notice, but since the price hike of Zola's juices a few months ago they appear to have also removed the 24g of guarana they used to include in this original variety and in the pomegranate flavor. I stopped buying it because Amazon had such unreliable inventory of it for a while, so I bought a few in the store. I didn't read the ingredients until today. Reason being that yesterday I discovered that Zola has removed the peel-off seal from the bottles. I called them about that and they confirmed that this is the new packaging. Today I decided I might as well check if anything had changed (in the ingredients), and sure enough, I saw that the guarana is no longer listed. Why would we pay more for Zola than Sambazon when they actually take stuff out? I am looking for another acai juice with guarana but so far haven't found it. Bossa Nova also doesn't include it and WF doesn't have the only variety of Sambazon that I know has (or used to have, who knows anymore these days) guarana.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW<br /><br />Like someone else wrote, I used to buy this in a store until I got the bright idea to see if Amazon had it...just being facetious, but I already had other subscriptions running here so I could have known. Anyway, if you are completely new to acai I wouldn't know how it would taste so I can't help you there. To me it tastes very similar to blueberries, without the tartness. There is a bit of graininess in the end because it's all natural and I guess you do get to drink the pulp as well. Just shake it so that it mixes all together. Needs refrigeration once opened, then again, I drink the whole bottle right away, it's not that big. It's sealed and I have never had a quality issue.<br /><br />I find the uplifting effect that the guarana gives so much better than the caffeing jolt from regular coffee. Very similar to green tea I guess, though green tea's caffeine lasts a bit longer I think. Then again, green tea doesn't have the omega 3 and other good stuff that Zola puts into this bottle. A great drink, highly recommended!

The Zola product is 93% juice.  Look carefully if you purchase Acai elsewhere since some have only a trickle of acai. The price on Amazon is much better (less expensive) than anywhere else. Local groceries and "health food stores" charge 2X-4X. Acai puree is also am excellent value on Amazon.

Either way, If you order these in the fall or winter, they come out cooler, and more delicious.  If you try these, you will probably love them.  My other big complaint is that they are loaded with sugar.  If you drink it, you will probably like it.

I kinda liked the taste, which I'd describe as between grape and cranberry.  A little residue at the bottom I guess is an indication of healthiness?  Should I have decanted it?<br /><br />It tastes OK, kind of refreshing, really.  But unless you've got money to burn, and the Olympics to train for, I find it not quite worth the cost.

review/text: I saw this product on Shark Tank, and all the "Sharks" seemed to love it. I tried to order directly from the girls website, but shipping was just outrageous to New Jersey. Fortunately as an Amazon Prime member - I took advantage of the free shipping and ordered through Amazon. As usual, the package arrived quickly and all FIVE of us, went crazy to try the PB's! It was very runny, but we tried all of the flavors on a ritz cracker. The Kids and my wife all liked the Honey Pretzel best. I liked the cinnamon raisin, but it was a lukewarm "like" at best. None of the PB's had much flavor, kinda bland. I noticed it was very runny - so we stirred em up a bit and put them in the fridge to stiffen up. A day or so later, we tried them again - even more bland from the fridge. Maybe I didn't stir em up enough? I don't know - but now they're too hard to stir at all, so we'll see if we have the will to finish a jar or two if they get any more flavorful? Overall, we think it's way overpriced for the taste. We won't be buying any more jars, which is a shame cause I did want to support the fledgling company. I do wish them the best of luck though. To be fair we ONLY tried the 3 PB flavors. Nothing else.. So the othr flavors/products may be fantastic. Do try them, but a caution on the 3 flavors above, simply "ok".

review/summary: Great Tasting Natural Peanut Butter
review/text: Great Tasting Natural Peanut Butter, Please note that this is NATURAL peanut butter and it does not contain any hydrogenated oils or other chemicals/additives (like most other major brands), so you will have to stir it or mix it when you get it home since the oil will separate and make it runny on top and very firm at the bottom. I like all 3 peanut butter flavors and the 2 almond butter flavors i got with the same order:)I would recommend buying this product from Amazon.com and not from the wild squirrel website since Amazon.com has free shipping:)

review/summary: Like eating greasy wax - no flavor
review/text: After seeing the girls that started the business on Shark Tank I wanted to support them and also I LOVE peanut butter so I ordered the 5 pack special they were running at the time.<br /><br />I had a tasting party with a bunch of friends all looking forward to trying all the flavors.<br /><br />Not one person liked the product or was even able to swallow it after putting it in their mouth.  The taste was so bad and the greasy texture such a turn off that my guests were actually spitting the peanut butter into napkins.<br /><br />I called the company and was told that the product needed to be refrigerated and then STIRRED. I has already stirred the peanut butter when we opened the containers due to the oils being on the top, which is normal with natural peanut butters. Seriously stirring cold peanut butter is not possible, nor can it be spread on bread.<br /><br />Save your money - I am out over $60 for the Wild Squirrel Nut Butters and they all had to be thrown out.<br /><br />These girls said all their friends at college love the nut butters, too bad your friends didn't tell you the truth and save you and my guess is your parents loads of money getting this product to market.

I found that just stirring it up a bit and putting it in the Frig helps. It still spreads easily. Keep it up ladies!

review/text: As my fellow-tea lovers know, it's not always easy to find high quality, organic, green, de-caf tea at a reasonable price. Well, as long as this product is on the market, they will have a loyal customer in me. I would describe this tea as delicate (mild) with a lovely bouquet of "earthy" flavors for your palate to enjoy. This tea is not at all on the grassy side so if you prefer a "grassier" tea, this may not be the one for you. All things considered (including price and shipping), this is a fabulous deal and I appreciate being able to order it directly from Amazon. Way to go, Coffee Bean Direct!

review/text: If your grandma ever made molasses cookies, they might have tasted like these extraordinary ginger snaps! They're light and snappy, without being a jaw-breaker. The amount of ginger and sugar is just right and the molasses is unsulphured, thus, there's no yucky aftertaste. The Country Choice vanilla wafers are equally delicious! At over six bucks a pound, these cookies are a bit pricey, but worth every penny. Try these with a nice cup of tea or an ice-cold glass of milk. Now, try not to eat the whole box full...I dare you!

review/summary: 4 stars since organic
review/text: If these had not been organic I'd only given 2 stars. I'm used to eating Nature's Path organic ginger spice cookies which is the one I'm using to compare. The NP ones have a stronger ginger flavor which I prefer. The crunch factor (hardness) is about the same. The price point is the biggest factor. The NP at $32 w/o coupon for 12 9 ox. boxes are approx.4.75 pound (the last case I bought had a coupon so were $22 or 3.26/lb). These are about 6.50/lb. at Amazon's current price. I probably won't buy these again as I'll stick w/ Nature's Path. That said, I did give this brand's chocolate mint cookies 5 stars and I do plan on purchasing those again as well as trying their chocolate chip and oatmeal cranberry.

review/summary: Used To Be Great, But No More!!
review/text: These cookies used to be great, but alas, no more!!  I bought two cases (12 boxes) of the ones with an expiration date of "OCT 11 09 B" from Amazon recently.  When I received them I found only two to three whole cookies per box, the rest were broken in multiple pieces.  I had previously had this problem with the "OCT 11 09 B" cookies that I purchased from Kroger and Whole Foods.  Two problems that I noticed right away: 1) the natural ginger snap cracks are two deep and the whole cookies that are present break with very little force, and 2) the cookie boxes rather than being stacked vetically in the case taking advantage of the stucture of each box to protect the cookies, are layed flat on top of one another.  Therefore, just stacking cases on top of one another crushes the cookies.  When I called the company and pointed out these problems, they blamed Amazon's mishandling of the cases as the cause of so many broken cookies.  They promised to reimburse me but I only received coupons to replace one of the two problem cases. If the broken cookie pieces had not tasted so good and if they had not been organic, this rating would have been a "1".

review/summary: Matsuda is the best
review/text: Of all the brands of shirataki, I prefer Matsuda.  I use the flat noodles, the thin, the bundled "dumpling" type, and the cubed.  Matsuda noodles are packed in a sealed tray, which is then sealed within another wrap. As a result, I think they are the freshes and the least "fishy" of the shirataki brands.<br /><br />The secret of enjoying these noodles is in the preparation.  While water comes to a boil, I open and rinse the noodles under cold running water; place the drained noodles along with some frozen vegetables in a Pyrex quart measure; the cover the noodles and vegetables with boiling water and let them sit while I prepare a protein.  I drain the noodles and vegetables and add them to the protein in a pot or skillet, season, and cook on low heat so the flavors come together.  The noodles, of course, simply absorb the flavors they are cooked with.  Any form of Matsuda noodles can be used the same way.  In cold weather I combine them with soup, etc.<br /><br />If you haven't tried this brand, and think you really don't like shirataki noodles, give Matsuda noodles a try.  I buy them 10 or more packages at a time and just keep them in the frig.  They are easy to use and really help with weight loss.

review/text: I LOVE pasta and was looking for something to reduce the carbs.  I was sooooo excited when I read about shirataki pasta.  I thought with this product, being low, low calorie and zero carbs,  would allow me to overindulge in a pasta-like product while avoiding the carbs and calories...a dream come true.  Unfortunately this was not the case.  As other reviews said, when you open the package there is a terrible fishy smell, but that is eliminated with a lot of rinsing.  My problem was with the texture of the noodle...it chews like rubber and I just could not get past that.  It has no taste of it's own, so whatever you put with it is the flavor you will get.  I only used my favorite spaghetti sauce so was only using the shirataki noodles as a replacement for spaghetti.  I am so disappointed that these did not work for me.

So, i searched for a dog food that still had great ingredients, and i found it in the diamond naturals small breed. they absolutely loved it. we are well into the second bag, and they are doing well on it. Plus, the cost is pretty attractive, too. I do have to drive to the feed store to get it because no one in town  has diamond products, but it's worth it. I am glad to find a dog food that is not full of corn meal, by-products, and all that other junk. if you're thinking of switching, give it a try.

It has been 10 days since we introduced the food to my dog. Her coat is extremely softer and My husband is convinced that her poop doesn't stink as bad as before. I have to be careful how much food I give her each day though. She likes it so much that, there is never any left in her bowl. I think whatever I give her she will eat, which could lead to an over weight doggy. I highly recommend this product and think more people should use it!

review/text: My pom is very finicky and I tried giving him some other dog food (good quality) and he turned his nose up.  As soon as I put this back in his bowl, he started eating it like he really enjoyed it.  He knows when something is cheap quality because I have totally tested him.  Don't think you'll be disappointed.

review/text: I used to order creamer singles from international delights, and they always arrived with at least half of them dented or leaked.<br />I am very pleased with coffeemate singles, they arrived with well packaged, double boxed, no leak no dent so far.<br />It looks like they still have 6 months shelf lives when I received them, so I am very happy they shipped fresh ones for me.<br />The flavor is just as same as the one from bottles, but I don't have to refrigerate them. I carry some of them in my purse, so I can have it anytime when I am not at home. The price is great if you subscribe it. Very pleased!

review/summary: Delicous, of course...and I had no problem with any of the containers being damaged during shipping
review/text: Most likely you've already had this and love it, but just wanted to buy it in bulk, as I did.  I've read many reviews for bulk-shipped creamers that stated many of the creamers were smashed, cracked, etc.  That wasn't the case for this one or the Amaretto that I purchased.  Both were double-boxed (the box the creamers were in were put in another sturdy box, to clarify), and there was air packaging in-between the top of the creamer box and the outer box.  With both orders (180 Hazelnut and Amaretto) I did not have even one cracked or damaged container.  It seems they listened to all of those complaints and have fixed their shipping issues with these products.

review/text: I had been using this creamer from the bottle for many years, and this was my first time buying singles. The creamer is great, but what surprised me was the packaging. When I open the shipping box, I was surprised to see all of the singles were just dumped in -- no stacks or retail boxes -- its as though they replaced the packaging peanuts with creamer buckets. I had a good laugh and put the box of creamers under my coffee pot.

It is the most popular creamer in my home and business. The nearest six Sams Clubs I have access to no longer carry it. Their managers don't know why they stopped getting it. They tell me the item was a consistent best seller. They don't know if they will ever carry it again. How can you possibly maintain a good inventory with out customer feedback? This is why I shop Amazon. They listen to their customers. If there is a demand for an item they fill it. I now have a standing monthly order with Amazon.

review/summary: Almost Too Easy!
review/text: This packet makes excellent pulled pork. It calls for a 3lb boneless pork shoulder roast with most/all of the fat trimmed off, 1/2 cup ketchup, 1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar and 1/3 cup cider vinegar. Mix up the sauce, place your pork roast in your crockpot, pour sauce over, cover and that's it! You can cook your pork on high for 4 hours or low for 8 hours.<br /><br />If I'm going to be gone slightly longer than 8 hours then I take the pork roast out of the freezer the night before and the next morning put it in the crock only partially defrosted. This seems to help keep the pork more moist if its going to be cooking more than 8 hours on low. Because usually if I'm gone for work, I'm going to be gone at least 9 hours and sometimes as much as 10. If you're going to be cooking the 4 hours on high or 8 hours on low then I recommend that the roast be completely defrosted because you want it to cook thoroughly enough that it's "pull apart" done.<br /><br />I make this exactly as the recipe says except instead of regular brown sugar I used Splenda blend. I thought the ratio between meat and bbq was perfect using two pounds of meat rather than three. If you use 3lbs and you like your bbq pretty "saucey", I'd add a couple of tablespoons of water to the mix to make it stretch a bit further.<br /><br />If you decide to cook this on high, I recommend using 1-2 tablespoons of water to keep the bbq sauce from scorching because generally I cook this on the low setting for 8 hours and once I let it go almost to 9.5 hours because I was late getting home and the sauce got kind of coagulated. That was fixed by adding just a bit of water and it was still fine but it might scorch if you are cooking on high and leave it longer than the 4 hours the recipe calls for.<br /><br />This is a great summertime meal! I serve it with cole slaw or potato salad or macaroni salad and corn on the cob. It's fast and doesn't heat the house up and no hovering over a hot stove.<br /><br />One last thing, I HIGHLY recommend using a crockpot liner when cooking this. I ran out the last time I cooked this and ended up having to soak my crock overnight and still had to scrub a bit to get the baked on sauce off of it.

McCormick's BBQ pulled pork has never let us down, whether used as directed or adding a few of our favorite flavors we have always had mouth watering, exceptional pulled pork. If you have not tried this product, please do yourself a favor and give it a try, I believe you will be extremely satisfied with the results. Our most difficult problem is waiting for the slow cooker to finish blending the flavors, but it is worth every minute we wait just thinking how darn good dinner is going to be.<br /><br />Al Schweiger

review/summary: Perfectly Butterscotch!
review/text: Butterscotch is not my favorite flavor, because I associate it mainly with cheap candies. I was really hoping this matcha would be more like the fresh butterscotch syrup you put on ice cream sundaes, and I was right! The flavor is so smooth and perfectly butterscotch-y. And not at all like cheap candy. No, this is rich decadent creamy sweet gooey butterscotch. The matcha base keeps it from being too heavy and sickly-sweet, it's the perfect balance of health and decadence.

review/summary: Sweet Sinful Delight - No Guilt!
review/text: If you love butterscotch hard candies then this is the matcha for you! Its my new secret sinful delight! This is EXACTLY like those butterscotch hard candies from childhood!<br /><br />I think if I had to pick one matcha that I would never share with others this would have to be the one. Although there are so many I have yet to try I think so far this is my favorite. I just made myself laugh though because I have said that with almost every new matcha from Red Leaf Tea I have tried. Seriously though, this is so very yummy, and sweet, and just really the one that I feel will always hit the spot for me! What is even more cool is that when I mix it in my latte concoction - which is how I usually have my matcha, the butterscotch flavor comes out even more and is not by any means hidden underneath the milk or vanilla creamer!<br /><br />I always do try matcha straight before mixing it in my latte and I will say that the butterscotch flavor is stronger in the latte mixture than straight which I found interesting and odd at the same time.<br /><br />I don't know how Red Leaf does it but their flavors are all natural and while I certainly appreciate the health benefits to matcha I am finding I reach for it more and more simply for the flavor but I can't deny the excellent energy boost! Its like an energy drink without all the sugar which means you don't come down and fall on your face later in the day! This is a different kind of energy boost, one that makes you more alert and on the ball and it does not end abruptly finding yourself feeling lower than before you had the drink as energy drinks do. This trails off nicely and in a mellow fashion allowing you to ease into the afternoon or evening!<br /><br />I am now drinking at least one matcha per day, after my morning black tea!

review/summary: So buttery...
review/text: Butterscotch is another one of those flavors that I adore. Butterscotch anything is pretty much a guarantee I buy it. I love the rich buttery-ness of it. In my drinking days, butterscotch schnapps was my go-to drink. I love it. Mix it with a bit of milk or hot cocoa...oh yes. The best, though, is around the holidays, mix a touch of it into egg nog. Ooooh, now that's an idea, egg nog matcha. Red Leaf Tea, I will love you forever if you develop an egg nog matcha by the holidays! I can't have real nog any more, so I've been hunting for a good tea substitute.<br /><br />Anyway, yes. Butterscotch is love for me. It's another Dad memory, he loves it and it makes me think of him...or maybe I'm just homesick this week. Butterscotch pudding is the only pudding I'll touch and if an ice cream shop offers butterscotch topping, I'll risk the dairy allergy to get a cone covered in the stuff. Liquid gold, it is. And seeing the success of Red leaf Tea's Caramel and French Vanilla flavors, I have complete confidence in this blend being amazing. I think this definitely calls for a hot tea latte, despite it being stupidly hot outside. Am I in Toronto or back in Tennessee? These hot days are killing me...I should be able to handle them better!<br /><br />No, I went for a cold matcha instead, it's too hot out there to bother with hot drinks, though this one was made to be enjoyed hot. Hot with a touch of rum and milk. Mmm...anyway. Yes. Cold, it's less than stellar, but it's still yummy. Very buttery and rich, but not too rich. I want to sip on this all day, but I need to save some for when it's cool enough to be able to handle a hot drink. It does taste like candy, but it's not overwhemingly sweet. It's just tasty.  I'm not wowed by it like I am with some of their other blends, though. This one's good, but I need to try it a few more times before I decide if I'm going to keep it on my shelf or not. Perhaps a warmer water temperature will help, or a better ratio of tea to water. Still, it won't be hard at all to convince myself to drink this one! I might even be convinced to share it.

They are a pain in the thing that needs fiber bars <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ONVOC0">FiberPlus Antioxidant Bars, Dark Chocolate Almond, 5-Count Bars (Pack of 12)</a>, and now I prefer this delicious alternative. This tasty Progresso soup is great, especially if you lack time to boil a chicken. To achieve a homemade flavor, simply add a dash of black pepper and marjoram. A dash of curry, thyme, or rosemary is delicious too.<br /><br />Since posting this review, Progresso has upgraded its cans: they feature tougher pull-tops to avoid opening during normal bumps of shipment/transport. You don't want your soup to arrive battered, dented, and soggy, due to poor can-design, you want to eat it. Enjoy!

review/summary: This is NOT the tea as described on amazon.com!
review/text: The description of this product in amazon.com is "Aged for 5 years deep in the mountain caves of Yunnan, China". The tea which we received has a paper sticker which says "Goldden Pu-erh Aged 5 Years Loose Leaf Tea" on a plastic pouch labeled "English Tea Store" which has extremely small and nearly illegible note in the back which says "Our tea is crafted by masters blenders using the finest tea from India, China, Sri Lanka (Ceylon) and Kenya." If this description applies to tea in this bag, then more tea in this bag comes from India than from China (and China is a very large place, while Yunnan is a province in southwestern China), and possibly from Sri Lanka and Kenya, Africa. There is no certification of where this tea came from, and whether it is what its sticker claims "Pu-erh Tea" and whether and how much of this tea came from "the mountain caves of Yunnan, China". I opened the bag to sniff and taste the tea, but this says nothing about the autheticity of its advertized claim on amazon.com. I am doubtful whether this product is in fact "Pu-erh Tea" from Yunnan, China, and am therefore returning the tea pouch to the vendor, with a request to amazon.com to refund me the purchase price. I am going to buy Pu-erh tea from a Chinese herbal medicine dealer instead.

review/summary: Mix is fine; challenge is the prep and the frying
review/text: After several dismal failures using a pot on the stove, I finally had great success after firing up the big turkey fryer kettle/propane burner in the driveway, using about 8 inches of peanut oil.  Taking advice of others - refrigerate the dough for several hours, and then make sure you roll out the dough to EXACTLY 1/8th inch thickness like the instructions say, about the same as a piece of corrugated cardboard - no thinner (don't puff up and turn out like cookies) and no thicker (too heavy, flat and thick - like they serve at the Cafe Beignet and some other places).  I started test frying them at 320-340 degrees, but finally got the best result at higher temperature of 380-400.  First time I've ever had them puff up perfectly like at Cafe du Monde, light and fluffy like little pillows with one inch vertical rise.  Good luck.

review/summary: World-Famous New Orleans Donut squares you can make at home!
review/text: Anyone who has ever visited New Orleans will most likely have a tale to tell of a late-night or early morning visit to the world-famous Cafe Du Monde (cafe of the world) for a snack of Beignets and Chicory coffee.<br /><br />This simple little square fritter with powdered sugar is often imitated but somehow never quite the same as the cafe Du Monde version.  The authetic mix guarantees you that Cafe Du Monde taste and they are relatively easy to fry up at home for a weekend morning treat.  Traditonally fried in Cottonseed oil, most home-cooks opt for a healthier, lighter oil but anyway you fry them, these are not exactly health food!<br /><br />Essentially, Beignets are fried dough covered with generous amounts of powedered sugar.  Traditionally served by themselves on a plate a of three with cups of Chicory coffee, you can, if you want, get adventurous and fill them with fruit (cherry works best) compote or sweet cream cheese for variety. You can also set a few sugared blueberries and a sprig of mint in the middle of a plate of three beignets for a classic presentation. They are so scrumptious that you needen't really offer anything else but some folks like to include Beignets as part of a larger brunch menu.  Me, I prefer just the Beignets with their traditional beverage, for a mid-morning light brunch.  These are best if fried up in large batches for a group since frying anything in small amounts seems like too much effort for too little outcome, but one box at a time is okay too.<br /><br />While there are plenty of beignet recipes out there, this mix is super-easy and carries the Cafe Du Monde name. They turn out well and taste very much like the real thing.  It is worth the effort to make sure you also serve up some Chicory Coffee as well since it is the pairing of the two that evokes the strong memory of nights in New Orleans.  The strong taste of the Chicory compliments the simplicity of the beignets beautifully.

review/summary: Worth the wait
review/text: Disappointed when Twinings discontinued their peach tea for the domestic market, I was pleased to be able to order the product internationally. The vendor, who is responsive and service-oriented, mailed the tea promptly, but it took a little while to arrive.  Definitely worth the wait.  Peach iced tea is a special treat.

review/text: I saw three cans of this in T.J. Maxx.  On a whim I bought two of the cans.  I haven't eaten this since I was a child under 8.<br /><br />Therefore, I couldn't remember the taste.  But when I opened the can and started eating, it is heavenly. I went back to the store to get some more, but of course they had none.  Luckily I found the same brand at Amazon.com.  I don't know about other brands, but I sure can recommend this one.  It is a treat!not to be overlooked.

review/summary: Great, relieving snack.
review/text: These are excellent, though I fancy the Ginger Chews more.  These are very tender and the young ginger has some much taste.  It's sweet and tart and helps calm your stomach.  As I said in the other review, keep an eye on how much you eat, as too much ginger (like peppermint) can cause heartburn.  For motion sickness, an upset stomach, for digestion help or pregnancy calm or frazzled nerves, this is a great treat.

review/summary: big tender chunks  well flavored
review/text: These are very fresh  well flavored bite sized cubes of candied ginger.  These are beautifully processed  good ginger flavor with a nice bite but not too spicy. Pieces are a bit bigger than most packaged candied ginger and quite  suitable for eating out of hand. They  need to be chopped up a bit if you want to add them to  cookie  dough etc or add to jam. I've shared these with a friend who had  morning sickness and used them on a boat trip in rough seas to avert mal de mer and for mild stomach distress  they are a very useful folk remedy though of course they are mainly intended as a candy and condiment I will probably include some in a sauce/chutney  to serve with duckling

review/summary: Delicious but STRONG-- Be Prepared!
review/text: The Ginger chews by the Ginger People are my favorite candies of all time! These are the Ginger People's pure Ginger candies and they are of excellent quality. They are perfect if you like really spicy candies. These candies are similar to the "See's" brand Crystallized Ginger and I feel that the quality is about the same as "See's". Unlike the See's brand, these do not have a chocolate coating which is good if you don't really like chocolate.<br /><br />I love the spicy, chewy flavor. It's so hard to find delicious Ginger foods and candies (except online) and I'm so happy that Amazon started carrying these products by the Ginger people.<br /><br />These are great for nausea, too.<br /><br />Great for travel sickness, great for morning sickness, and just great taste when you want a really spicy candy. I love them! The pilots use them.<br /><br />Recommended! But if you don't want something SO spicy, I recommend that you start out with the Ginger People ginger chews first. If you like these, you can graduate up to the Crystallized ginger. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKV60W">The Ginger People Original Ginger Chews, 4.5 Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Not spicy at all
review/text: I bought this based on the reviews and the fact that I like The Ginger People chewy ginger. I bough 25 bags of this ginger and it's not spicy at all :(  It's a bit sugary with a hint of ginger.  Waste of money for me. Perhaps I got a bad batch...

review/summary: Best Ginger around
review/text: My husband and I were at a local food store and found what we thought to be dried pineapple slices.  After getting it home we found out it was candied ginger.  We spoke with some friends who love the stuff and found out that it has stomach calming abilities.  I suffer from panic attacks and often find myself nauseous.  After doing more research, ginger is used not only to calm nausea but also to calm nerves.  Instead of taking the perscribed medication, I turn to ginger as a first response.  We quickly ran out of the first purchased batch of mistaken ginger we bought.<br />I went on a research mission to find the best ginger out there. After reading many reviews I decided on Ginger People Crystallized Ginger.  The best decision I've made this year!  It's a small container but the Ginger is amazing.  Much milder than the original stuff but with very little strings.  The Ginger is in small squares that once you bite into them, they are so crist and crunchy.  I want to eat the stuff all the time now, not just to curb my boughts of nerves and nausea.  This is defintely going to be a recurring purchase in my house!

review/summary: This is the best
review/text: This is really good. I tried every kind of ginger candy at the health food store - candy chews, candied, and hard candy and this company along with Reed's makes the best kind. It is real ginger, the taste is great, and it still has texture. If you have a stuffed nose, a little piece will open your nasal passages right away; and if you just park a little piece of it in between your gum and teeth and let it dissolve slowly, it will keep them open for a good while. I am however concerned that the majority of their products are from China.

review/summary: ALL I GOT WAS TINY PIECES!
review/text: You see the picture of this? Well, what I got were tiny dried up odds and ends. I don't know if this is normal for this product, but I expected them to be like the picture. It had way too much sugar, probably because the pieces were so small. They were not nice and square, they were much smaller and mostly triangle, and nugget shaped. I bought them mainly to use with some red onions and cook them with steak. But it would probably be too sweet, as small and sugary as they are.<br /><br />UPDATE: I emailed the seller and they told me they switched companies and the new company was not selling the squuares pictured on the bag and that is why they were smaller. I don't know. But they refunded me. Good company to deal with, anyway.

review/text: These ginger candies are delicious!  Each piece is roughly one calorie and if you can dust off some of the sugar then you can reduce the calories even more. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IH0GO0">The Ginger People Ginger Chews 2lb Bag</a>  are also delicious and chewy but each piece has 25 calories.

review/summary: Much too strong for my taste
review/text: I purchased this product to see if it would help with my morning sickness. It is way too strong for my taste. I liked the texture; it's like any other dried fruit. It was just too spicy for me, and I normally like spicy candy. Claey's Sandied Ginger, which I purchased at the same time, is more for me. Less strong, but still the ginger taste and smell.

review/summary: too strong for me!
review/text: I bought this as a possible cure to my pregnancy morning sickness. It's definitely too strong for me! The ginger is obviously of good quality and the chunks are large, but I just couldn't eat it. (I bought the ginger chews of this same brand and those were great!)
