review/summary: Not as Depicted/Advertised!
review/text: I purchased Ken's Steak House Dressing Creamy Caesar-6 Pack because the picture that is used shows "0 Carb" and I am on a low-carb lifestyle.  Do not buy this product if that is what you want, because it arrived and is the regular creamy cesar dressing with 1 carb.  I contacted them and they pointed me to their "Legal Disclaimer" which really doesn't imply that the product was going to be something different than shown. They did say I could return the item within 30 days, which I wanted to do.  Then I found out that if I wanted to return the item, I would have to pay the shipping fees to do so.  Because the package is so heavy, it is not worth the cost/time to do so.  I am now stuck with a product that I didn't want and out almost $40 for dressing that would have cost me $20 to get in the local supermarket!  Don't Buy from them because with Ozbo's legal disclaimer, they can basically sell you anything they want!<br /><br />I have been a customr with Amazon for years and this was the first time I have ever had an issue that I was compelled to write a review on.  It is very disheartening to have this happen.

review/summary: Udon...finally!
review/text: I used to buy this type of noodle from Walmart all the time. Then they stopped carrying it. I went to HyVee for a while, then they stopped having it as well. I haven't had udon noodles since last year, until now. These noodles are soft with just the right amount of chewiness. They are slightly spicy, without being over powering. Perhaps a little pricey, but when it's the only place that sells them, it's worth it.

review/text: This instant coffee has a nice flavor, and is convenient when you do not want to spend the time making a pot of coffee.  However, I noticed instant coffee is near the bottom of the list, so there is actually more sugar and chocolate in this than coffee.  My sister actually thought it tasted almost like hot chocolate, and she liked it since she is not a coffee drinker.

review/summary: The Apocalypse Comes with Cream Filling!
review/text: Mother Nature has been one scary momma lately. You can barely swing a dead meteorologist without hitting some sort of earthquake, twister, tsunami, flood or typhoon on the map. What's next, hailstones the size of Kardashian implants? Krakatoa ripping us all a new volcanic lava-hole? Plagues of locusts and killer bees and whatever species the Philly Phanatic belongs to?<br /><br />I decided to prepare myself for the next natural disaster by making sure I'll always have access to the four basic necessities: Food. Shelter. Clothing. Twitter.<br /><br />If there's a food that can withstand any weather emergency, it's the almighty Twinkie. They're the perfect survival staple: Twinkies are waterproof, fire retardant, unfreezable and approximately as lava-resistant as you are. They float, have a half-life longer than carbon-14, the filling repels insects when rubbed on the skin, and these are individually wrapped, so if a tornado carries them miles away, you can still track them down and enjoy a delicious post-apocalyptic snack.<br /><br />In fact, their tastiness is the only downside. I bought a week's supply, four boxes to stash away in case of emergency. They lasted about six hours. I think I may have inhaled one of the wrappers.<br /><br />Maybe I should switch to Hostess Ho-Ho's. Just to be safe.

review/summary: Twinkies tasted great but are overpriced
review/text: The title header for this item is confusing, it says "2 boxes 20 cakes." What you are getting is a total of 20 individually wrapped twinkies. These are the same 10 pack boxes you can buy at any grocery store across the U.S. In the detailed description of the item it does say 2 boxes of 10 but you have to look hard for it amongst all the other information on a typical Amazon page. I thought I was getting 40 cakes for the listed price which would have been a good deal but I might as well have just gone to the store and bought these cheaper and not paid shipping.

review/summary: Shockingly Delicious Bacon & Chocolate
review/text: This bar is best experienced with other people--just in case you or they do not like it. As a couple of reviewers indicated, they thought the taste was off. When I heard about it, I thought it sounded disgusting. However, when I tried it, it was delicious, delightful, and stunningly good.<br /><br />If you're expecting standard chocolate flavors, I don't think this is the bar for you. However, if you like odd combinations, enjoy fatty or greasy or salty food (like fries & chips), and enjoy new experiences, this bar is worth it. Sure, the price is a bit high, but the quality is top notch.<br /><br />If you buy the bar, or if you like it, I suggest you bring it to a group gathering where you can share it. You may well convert other people who enjoy it, and those who don't enjoy it won't spend their money on it.<br /><br />This is probably one of the best bar's I've ever had, and I love to share it with others!

review/text: I bought one of these chocolate bars at Whole Foods for $6.99.  I thought for that much money it must be really good.  It's not that good.  It's not $7.00-for-a-candy-bar-good, that's for sure.  You can't really even taste the bacon.  If you gave a piece to someone and didn't tell them there was bacon in it they would likely never guess there was.<br /><br />Now on Amazon it's 12 dollars!?  That is a very bad deal. It's not that I don't make unadvised purchases, I do, but this one, 12 bucks for this chocolate bar, is beyond the pale.

Very rich and creamy chocolate with a salty crunch from the bacon, it was divine and difficult to keep myself from eating more than a couple of pieces.  I also found it at World Market for a bit less in cost.

review/summary: Interesting and rich, but not something you'd eat everyday
review/text: I was excited to pop that first little chunk of Mo's Bacon Bar in and see what happened.  Well, lots of things happened.  The flavors were strong, yet subtle at the same time, which my confused my mind a little.  The smoked salt is brilliant if you can snag a piece of a good granule of that in it.  The bacon was really good, but it nearly blew it off the richness charts for my taste buds, anyway.<br /><br />Bottom line:  I think everyone should at least try one of these in their lifetime. It's a unique experience for sure or bring one to a friend's gathering (it WILL get attention and some talk).  Otherwise, this is something you'd have maybe once or twice a year or for a special occasion.  Trust me, if I ate one of these everyday - I'm not sure I'd make it past day three because they are RICH!

review/summary: Give in to your dark side
review/text: Vosges is an uber-premium US based chocolatier that sells very racy and daring flavors paired with chocolate. This is not the weak chocolates that you see at the markets, but rather an intense dark chocolate that really focuses on the flavor of the cacao bean.  I estimate that it is probably a 60% bittersweet dark chocolate by my taste.  Earthy and rich with a sligthly acidic finish, it is for die hard chocolate purists.  They were one of the first companies to promote the whole chili chocolate craze.  Their bacon bar is probably one of their best sellers and incorporates bits of bacon and smoked salt - just enough to accent the chocolate and not overpower it.  The do have bacon truffles which I felt were a bit better but you could only get those in their boutiques or through mail order directly from Vosges.  It is not "meaty" as most people expect and there are other companies that offer bacon covered chocolate where bacon is the centerpiece.  If you are a fan of See's candies or Whitman's this may not be for you.  If you like Godiva, this could be for you.  If you are into Valrohna or Scharffen-Berger, this is definitely the bar for you.<br /><br />But a the current price of $12 a bar, it is somewhat pricey for and may be directed at those customers buying it for the novelty or cover cost for special handling so it won't melt.  Whole Foods sells them for $7 usually.

review/summary: Unusual combo, yet ridiculously awesome.
review/text: I admit at first I didn't think I'd like the combo of bacon and chocolate when I first tried one a year ago.  Flash forward to April 2012. I wanted to splurge a little and I decided to buy myself this bar as well as for a friend. Mo's Bacon Bar is much better than a mere candy of just having a slab of bacon covered in chocolate. It's sweet but not too sweet.  The taste of bacon doesn't interrupt the velvety smoothness of chocolate. The balance of sweet and salty is simply exquisite.<br /><br />I recommend this for any bacon and sweet-toothed fanatics alike. BTW, I do recommend this to be paired with brown ales or a good quality red wine.

review/summary: really good stuff - to be savored
review/text: Mo's Bacon Bars were around long before the current silly bacon fad, and they will be around long after.<br />This is not novelty candy, nor is it a convenience store candy bar to be unwrapped and snarfed down quickly as a snack.<br /><br />The ingredients are pure, high quality, and very rich.<br />Each 3 oz bar measures about 6 inches long, and contains 8 squares of chocolate.  I've found that the best way to enjoy a Mo's bar is one square at a time, making it last and really taking time to enjoy each one.<br /><br />The chocolate is very smooth and pure (no corn syrup or fillers here!), flecked with grains of smoky salt and crispy little bits of real bacon.  Let a bite dissolve in your mouth for the full effect; it really is unique.<br />And, one little square satisfies, making the price more reasonable, at least for a once in awhile treat or fun gift.<br /><br />If you're not quite ready to pull the trigger on a whole bar, check out the Vosges website for 1/2 oz mini bars.

It may satisfy rabid bacon addicts, but the flavor of the bacon with the chocolate just doesn't work.  You can taste the greasiness of the bacon through the chocolate, and it's not good. Rather than an aftertaste of chocolate, you get an aftertaste of bacon with chocolate overtones.

review/text: I bought this as a gift for my husband and it was disappointing.  The quality of the chocolate is very poor, closer to Hershey kisses than Dove or Godiva.  The bacon flavor was off, kind of bitter and more like bacon bits than actual bacon.  Overall, i wish i hadn't wasted $30 on 4 bars of sub-par chocolate. I know you want to try this for yourself because you think that everyone is being too picky, that's what i thought too, but don't!  Save your money and make your own chocolate bacon bar at home.

review/summary: Not worth the price.
review/text: I'm sorry. It must be that the bacon was almost tasteless. When I ate the bar all I could taste was chocolate. All I got from the bacon was a hint of saltiness. No bacon flavor whatsoever. I do not recommend this.

review/text: Just a heads up to all the mom's, I have been purchasing this at Wal-Mart for $0.98/package.  That equals out to about $5.00 LESS than what Amazon is charging you.  And this does not factor in shipping.  Nonetheless, we love this food for the baby and so does she!

review/text: I love this green salsa. Our local grocery store carries it, and the taste is wonderful. Warning though: Mrs. Renfro will burn your tongue off. This is not a salsa for the meek.  Mrs. Renfro's Gourmet Green Salsa is literally one of the hottest food products I have ever eaten. After about 10 chips the burn kicks in. After 20 chips, you are doing the follow routine: dip chip, eat chip, swallow, drink water, pant, pant, wipe brow, take a few deep breathes, wipe brow, pant, yell "woooooooo!", and repeat.<br /><br />Wonderful taste, and a perfect gift for the hot food lover on your gift list.

review/text: I recently ordered the Chapati and was very pleased with it. I sought out Chapti on amazon because I was diagnosed by an Ayurvedic doctor as a person who should eat whole grain breads for their calming effects but preferably without leavening, which increases Vata issues. Chapati is the perfect choice and was highly recommended by the doctor. I recommend this bread based on my experiences. It is a soft flatbread that is flexible so you can break it off easily, tuck a filling inside and double the bread around it, and also toast it. I highly recommend Chapati from Om India.

review/summary: The real thing
review/text: Too many lemon olive oils are only "lemon-flavored" --makers use lemon extract or lemon flavoring (real or artificial? Hard to tell!) or some lemon oil from who knows where, pressed who knows when, and just put it in olive oil. Read the label on them--can you really tell where the lemon flavor is coming from?<br /><br />Not this one!  They pressed lemons and olives together to make this oil, so all the flavors from the lemons and the lemon oil are mixed together with the oil from the olives.<br /><br />You can really tell the difference when you taste it. Real lemon flavor and it is not shy.<br /><br />My favorite thing is to drizzle this over sliced tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and basil, with a bit of salt. The lemon adds a whole new dimension that you don't get with plain olive oil. Heaven on a plate!

review/summary: Of the new wave of microbrewed colas, this is easily the best!
review/text: I feel bad.  Like I'm cheating on my own other review.  But I have to be honest.  A year or two ago, I wrote a review praising another brand of "small batch" colas, proclaiming it as the "real" Real Thing.  I won't completely disown that review, but that was all before I tried Fentiman's.  Holy Moley.  I love Boylan's.  I love the Coca Cola from Mexico.  I loved Pepsi Throwback.  I even loved that complex, black sheep of colas, Red Bull cola.  Heck, I even enjoyed the strange, toasty flavor of Pepsi Raw... in small portions.  But this... this stuff is AMAZING!  Not too heavily carbonated.  Bursting with a variety of fruit flavors, this cola provides a multilayered tasting experience where the authentic cola taste gently unifies the other ingredients.  Sodas aren't supposed to taste this good.  Drinks like Fentimen's Curiosity Cola are why we fell in love with soda pop as kids.  For a special treat, it's well worth the price.  In a world of Scotch snobs, beer snobs, and wine snobs, this is the ultimate answer to what may emerge as the cola snob.  It is the Glenmorangie Scotch or Montecristo Cigar of colas.

review/text: Sorry, Boylan's.  You've been my favourite for years, but you just came in a very comfortable second.<br /><br />I came across this Fentimans soda locally, being sold either by the bottle or in four packs, and it intrigued me.  The glass bottle is an interesting design that reminds me of an English beer, the label has that classy old-timey look, and when you turn it to the important side (yes, the ingredients side is the important side), it hits you with stuff like... ginger... speedwell... juniper... yarrow--wait, does that say JUNIPER?<br /><br />I popped it in the cart with a couple other varieties of the same brand--that Dandelion & Burdock stuff is an abomination, by the way--and saved it for a while, because I had a suspicion that I'd like it better than the others, if I liked any of it.<br /><br />Well... you could have knocked me down with my first sip.  I was alone and literally said aloud, "Wow."  I have tried a lot of old timey, natural, and organic colas: Blue Sky, China Cola, Boylan's, GuS.  I try to avoid the HFCS.  There are some good ones out there: China Cola cherry, for instance (so hard to find these days); Boylan's Cane Cola.  Good stuff.  There are some not-so-good ones, too (Blue Sky, I'm looking at you; try harder.)<br /><br />But this stuff?  This stuff is like the king of all colas: Among the rest of us, there might be some extraordinary individuals, but no one measures up to the king, and with so much going for him, it's almost silly to try to surpass his greatness.<br /><br />The flavours in there are complex, with multiple things happening all at once--the bite of ginger, the softness of various herbs--but in the end, it's cola, and a damn good one--a GREAT one, I'd go even so far as to say.<br /><br />I think it is a very good thing that this soda is not cheap.  If it was, I'd have a hard time ever drinking water again.

review/text: This soda will knock you out it's so good!  I bought one at a specialty shop and had to go back just for another soda! I realized later that the caffeine content is pretty high.  Since then I have sworn off caffeinated cola and if they made a caffeine free version I would give it 5 stars.  Expensive but like the other reviewer said some people pay extra for a bottle of good wine and I would rather pay extra for a good cola!  The best I have ever tasted.  Brewed COLA!  How do they do that?  I'm not sure how but I know why.  Because it tastes better.  Many different fruity flavors.  I think it's made in the UK.

review/summary: Great for a Treat
review/text: I placed an order at a local shop for lunch and ordered a Root Beer.  They said they were out of Root Beer but had in "Curiosity Cola" instead.  I said I'd give it a shot.  This is a cola I just loved to sip.  Not something I could just guzzle.  I wanted to enjoy every last bit of it.  I think it's the ginger that seals the deal for me.  The only downfall is that it is not available for casual sale anywhere around me.  I guess I could go back to The Flaming Ice Cube and buy out their stock (may not be so bad since their price is a buck cheaper per bottle than what I'm seeing online).  I'd have to be able to get a 4-pack for under $9 to beat what I am currently paying.  In a way, it may be good that it is not available so easily because I probably wouldn't be saving it as a treat and would be shelling out lots of money in cola per week...<br />I like Coca Cola, too.  Don't get me wrong (love Mr Pibb).  But, don't be expecting that type of cola with this.  It is different.

The shape of the bottle reminded me of a lint roller at first, and it still does. Sometimes I wonder what it'd be like to be trapped in a lamp, like a genie. This soda is trapped in bottle, which is good, because it makes it easier to drink. My friend says he'd never drink this cola, but he did yesterday. He said it was awesome. Umm... Oh yeah! You DON'T have to keep the bottles after you drink all the cola out of it. You can throw it away. Or recycle it. Or buy another Fenitman's and put the cola from the new bottle into the old bottle. The possibilities are endless!!!

review/summary: Curiously awful
review/text: Cola is by far my favorite drink.  My wife and I usually have a debate of Pepsi vs. Coke, me preferring Coke, and neither one of us will ever win.  So I saw this bottle and was very hopeful to find something which would stop the argument once and for all.<br /><br />Fentiman's cola comes in a nice looking bottle, it has an old fashioned feel to it, and even the name "Curiosity" beckons something forth from the early 1900s -- a certain naivit&eacute; if you will.<br /><br />When I first opened the bottle I found that it was not as heavily carbonated as say my favorite Coke or my wife's Pepsi, something which might prove a boon to the product.  I sniffed it, and it had a distinct smell of cheap no-brand colas (to which I have resorted in the past during periods of smaller wallets).  That's not to say it was bad, it just is what it is.  I took a sip of the liquid and managed to get out the words "This really isn't too--" before my face contorted in waves of disgust.  It was one of the foulest sodas I have tasted to date, and that includes the old Tab drink.  For the first couple of seconds it just tastes like a cheaper cola, but then the aftertaste hits you, and it is vile.<br /><br />I would get this for someone for a gag gift (emphasis on the word "gag" here), but I will never purchase another bottle for my own sake.<br /><br />Having spent money on the bottle, however, I did not wish to waste it, so I guzzled the whole thing (this is where the limited carbonation indeed became a boon for the product).  This did turn out, in the end, to be a mistake, as every time the carbonation would force a burp I'd get nothing of the "not so bad" taste from the first couple of seconds, but instead I got all the horrible aftertaste.<br /><br />This may be close to what Cola once was.  It is, however, important to remember that it has evolved for a few reasons, and taste is one of those reasons.  Give me a Coke any day, or even a Pepsi.

review/summary: love, love, love this boxed meal!
review/text: After spending the day dealing with the kid, cows, housework, and everything else that seems to sneak up on me making the day far shorter than the 24 hours it's professed to be this is the perfect meal to whip up quick for my husband and I (sorry, the son is autistic and extremely picky about what he'll eat! - and this isn't one of his few menu choices).  We really like the combination of mashed potatoes, gravy and bisquits.  It has the right amount of spice to make it taste like something you'd make from scratch.  The only meal Banquet has that I actually like better than this one is the Chicken and Dumplings (but I didn't see that when I did a search for it).<br /><br />Granted, fresh is always best but this boxed meals provides you with a quick yummy meal that will do in a pinch.  Better than a frozen pizza or microwaved meals!

review/text: Getting up into my 60's, making dinner for my husband and I is a chore now and I try to find easy.  This product is just like when I used to make chicken and bisquits with gravy.  My husband never ate them, only my children, now grown.  I made this as it was so simple and we already loved the cheesy potatoes and ham, so I tried this, and my husband ate nearly the entire thing!  It is once again in the oven, he loves it and so do I and it is simple and quick! Give it a try, you'll love it too!!

review/summary: Not a fan.
review/text: I love hazelnut spreads and I've tried many brands from Kroeger/Smith to imported versions and each has their own unique taste and consistency and I like discovery the differences. Maybe it was the Mocha Cappuccino flavor that turned me off, or just Jif's less than stellar version.<br /><br />It comes in a glass jar and is about ten or twenty cents higher than other local brands available to me but I thought, no one can mess this up. It's chocolate! Well, I was wrong. The major issue I have is the fact that when I opened it, a thick layer of oil was sitting right on top. Yeah. OIL. Yellowish oil. Well, that's on me since  I should have checked the label and the number first two ingredients are SUGAR and VEGETABLE OILS. I drained that off and stirred it, finding it incredibly soup-like, as though it'd been sitting under the sun on a hot summer day. The taste is not bad, but it isn't great either. It's very sweet and the Mocha flavor does offset it a bit but it has none of that richness or thickness like other versions I've tried and the Mocha flavor is just...off. I've tried putting it on the usual suspects, like fruit and toasted bread, in no-bake cheesecake and hot chocolate, but it just doesn't cut it.<br /><br />I can see how some may like it, especially if you've never tried hazelnut spread but trust me, if you want the real mccoy, try: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5Y5M">Nutella Hazelnut Spread, 13-Ounce Plastic Jar (Pack of 5)</a> (by far The Best and, at last, accessible and rather affordable...everywhere!), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M6DC9Y">Nocciolata Hazelnut w/Cocoa & Milk (6/9.52 OZ)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002EE5G72">Natural Nectar Natural ChocoDream, Belgian Cocoa Spread with Hazelnuts, 12.3-Ounce Glass Jars (Pack of 3)</a>, all of which are amazing and SOOOOO much better!

review/text: I bought this cautiously, kind of scared of it (yes, I know that's silly, but there you are) and took a first tentative taste and was AMAZED. The coffee cuts some of the sweetness which could overwhelm the spread but doesn't thanks to the coffee, plus, what is better than coffee and chocolate? This is so good I literally could not stop eating it. Try it, you will be amazed, and I love Nutella and the cookie spreads but delicious as the cookie spreads are, they are a tad sickening after a few bites; this is not, it is a perfect blend of coffee and chocolate. Fantastic stuff, you will be thrilled!

review/summary: Excellent Instant Yeast
review/text: This is the most economical way to buy yeast even if you only bake with it 6 times in a year.  Do the math comparing the cost of those little packets & you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />This is an "Instant" or "Rapid Rise" yeast which should not be confused with "Active Dry".  Active Dry is dried at a higher temperature & therefore more of the yeast cells are killed.  If using AD, you need to soak/activate it in warm water before adding to dry ingredients.  This is unnecessary with Instant yeast; add it directly to the flour.  You also need to use more AD because more of the yeast cells are dead.<br /><br />I store mine in a glass jar with a tight-fitting lid in the refrigerator.  I write the expiration date on a label stuck to the lid.  It has always stayed active beyond the expiration date.<br /><br />This is the yeast to use if you are using a bread machine.  You can use AD yeast but it's more convenient to just dump all the ingredients in to a bread machine and let it do the work.<br /><br />You can substitute Rapid Rise/Instant yeast in a recipe calling for Active Dry yeast.  Use about 25% less Rapid Rise/Instant than the recipe calls for.  Example:  The Active Dry packets usually contain about 2-1/4 tsp./.25 oz. so use 1-3/4 tsp. Instant/rapid Rise yeast if the recipe calls for 1 packet (2-1/4 tsp.) Active Dry.<br /><br />You can also substitute Active Dry for a recipe that calls for Instant/Rapid Rise.  Use about 25% more Active Dry than the recipe calls for.  Example:  Use 1-1/4 tsp. Active Dry if the recipe calls for 1 tsp. Instant.<br /><br />1 tsp. Active Dry = 3/4 tsp. Instant/Rapid Rise<br />1 tsp. Instant/Rapid Rise = 1 1/4 tsp. Active Dry<br />1 packet (2 1/4 tsp/.25 oz) Active Dry = 1 3/4 tsp. Instant/Rapid Rise<br /><br />Other yeast to consider:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KWEZTO">Red Star Baking Yeast, Vacuum Packed, 2-Pound</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NY31WW">Safmex Instant Yeast ( 16 oz / 1 lb )</a>

review/summary: great yeast, but be aware that you're using mutants
review/text: This is really good stuff. Last long in the fridge, works great in machines, and there's no need for proofing (adding water to Active Dry yeast, and some flour, and letting it sit for a while before adding it to the rest of the mixture).<br /><br />Two things to remember:<br /><br />1. When using this, mix it well into the dry ingredients. If you just dump it into the water, it may clump together and you wind up with a clump of yeast in your bread. If you're using a bread machine, no worries, because if you follow the machine instructions (making a little "volcano" in the flour, putting yeast in the volcano hole) it'll do it for you.<br /><br />2. make no mistake, you're using mutant yeast. Instant yeast is created through protoplast fusion, where two different strains of yeast are combined into one. One of the types is usually a mutant yeast to begin with. any difference, health or taste wise? dunno. but once in a while i like to use cake yeast (the high-moisture "fresh" kind), or sourdough from my own starter (look on the net for instructions on how to make starters), and i like to think that i can taste the difference (and human history!)<br /><br />kev

review/summary: Great Yeast for breads & buns
review/text: This is wonderful yeast. I mix it in with my flour and other dries, then use hot tap water directly into this mixture, mix and knead. The yeast rises beautifully, and in a few hours, after a couple of rises and a good baking, I have wonderful breads to eat. There is no need to proof this yeast, a step given at the beginning of many bread recipes. This yeast is fresh, and lasts a long time in its vacuum sealed packs. There are two half pound packets in this product, so one can sit on your shelves while you open and use the other. I recommend storing the opened half in a plastic or glass container in the freezer. This will extend its life if you don't use it too often.<br /><br />I make all my breads in a Kitchen Aid mixer, which greatly speeds prep time, but two to three rises are needed to get great bread, and you really can't rush the rising. Your reward will be great bread or cinnamon buns, or whatever you and your family enjoys. There is not reason why you couldn't also use a bread machine.

Just make sure to use 25% less instant yeast if you're using a recipe that calls for dry active yeast.

review/text: This pack of yeast is an amazing deal! It has one pound for the price of a few packets that you would buy at your local grocery store. The one I got had an expiration date sometime in 2013, so these are not leftovers or close to expire products. Keeping it refrigerated, preferably in an air tight container, will increase it's shelf life. Just a reminder that this is not active dry yeast, but instant yeast. If your recipe asks for active dry yeast, you should adjust the amount accordingly. I have used this yeast in more than four bread recipes, including pizzas, focaccias and ciabattas and the results were all fantastic! I highly recommend this Fleischmanns Instant Yeast. There is no better deal!

review/text: The first time I used this, the dough did not rise properly, but that was totally my fault, because the instructions day to mix with flour before adding liquid, and I did just the opposite.  I really appreciate using it when making dough with my food processor.  I just mix it with the dry ingredients and then add the liquid.  The dough rises very nicely in half the time and my project turns out just fine.  Very simple process.  I cannot distinquish any difference in taste in using this yeast instead of other yeast forms. The cost is also considerably cheaper than purchasing a "jar" at my local market. I would certainly suggest that you give this yeast a try.

review/text: I'm not going to tell you what kind of yeast to buy, although I prefer Red Star.  I'm looking for VALUE and great results.  First, let's talk about VALUE.  I purchased two (2) 16 Ounce vacuum packed bags of the Fleishmann's at Sam's Club for $4.20 with Free Shipping.  (That's a joke, - I drove it home!)<br /><br />With regard to storage, I store my yeast in FoodSaver vacuum packed ball jars in my freezer!  I'm not sure if it correct, but it works for me. (Your mileage may vary!)  But, for $2.10 a pound, you could keep this yeast under your pillow and still come out ahead!<br /><br />Did you ever wonder WHY Sam's Club NEVER comes up in a Google search?  Dah?<br /><br />Secondly, I've had GREAT results with it, regardless of my love and devotion to Red Star.  Peter Reinhart's Artisan Bread's Every Day also helped.  I have many many books on bread and bread baking and there is NONE better.  Now, European artisan purests might argue with me, - please don't.  I'm simply talking about the best bread that I've ever baked!  I could do better, but my one (1) hour in the kitchen compared to two days of toil and devoted European love wins for me.  If you're serious about your bread baking, buy the book or simply continue to bury your head in the sand.<br /><br />There is simply NOT enough time in my life to solve everyone's problems, but I've tried to help!<br /><br />Fleishmann's gets 5 Stars from me.

review/text: Tried on a very delicate recipe and I either blew it or did not used it properly. Therefore I am giving it 3 Stars. For some reason that familiar smell that comes when you mix the yeast in perfectly warm water and reassures you that everything is fine, was absent this time. I was trying to make, the closest I can describe it, is a doughnut that is deep fried and that the batter is supposed to be compliant for this purpose. Have to note that the instructions for this creation did not call for Instant Yeast but upon reading about its uses I felt that it could be interchangeable if used in the right amounts. I am sure it was human error so for now I am only giving it 3.5 Stars and hopefully will use it again to determine if in making a tasty bread it might work better. Yes, I have been known to assigned fault to  products such as yeast so I do not look half as bad in the kitchen. Still, for now, I can only recommend a serious understanding of this type of yeast before purchasing. The expiration date was okey but something about that particular smell eluded me. Please don't tell me it was my sinus because I do not recall having this problem at all! 3.5 Stars!

review/text: I was very excited to find this product. It is suppose to be the same yeast as in the "Rapid Rise" and the product for bread machines. I used the exact amount for my recipe: a typical 1/4 ounce strip envelope equals 2 1/4 teaspoons. The end result was a baked product that tasted foul. I contacted Fleishmann's Company the next morning. I was told that they would replace the two pounds of yeast I had purchased with a (three envelope strip with a total of 3/4 ounces). When I pointed out that this did not seem reasonable, they said they would replace the two pounds of Fleishmann's yeast with a coupon for a 4-oz glass jar, and pointed out that I had complained about another product from their company in the past. I was further told that I would not have any future defective products compensated for. (?) This is not a company that stands behind their products, and apparently they are not committed to a reasonable level of quality control.

review/summary: Great treat
review/text: My cats, as all cats are, are very picky.  Three have food allergies so I have to be careful with what they eat.  They love all of Purina Friskies Crunchy Treats variaties.  I wish Purina would make larger package size.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: If you like seaweed snacks and if you like wasabe, this is the right combination for you.  Once you place it in your mouth, the wasabe gives you a kick immediately.  Tasty.<br /><br />We have a Trader's Joe close to our house, this sells for a buck.

review/summary: ADDICTED!
review/text: I've been addicted to these lately, even got some odd stares one day when I cleared the whole shelf of these little bags into my cart at Trader Joes. Its the prefect thing to fight a mid afternoon craving while still having tons of flavor. I tried Annie Chungs once and was amazed how bland they were compared to these.

review/summary: Like licking a dirty fish tank
review/text: My wife bought these for me because she knows I love wasabi and will eat just about anything coated with it.  There was almost no wasabi taste to the two chips I tried (I threw the rest out).  The only taste I got was a strong nasty "fishy" taste.  Now I'm not one of those nuts who orders fish in a restaurant and then complains about it tasting like fish (gasp).  These tasted like fish that is spoiled, hence my title.  Two cans of diet pepsi and I can't get the awful taste off of my poor tongue.  On the plus side, the guys at work got a good laugh out of my misfortune.

review/summary: Love this!
review/text: I only tried these a few weeks ago (they're 99 cents at Trader Joe's for a packet of about 20 pieces) and I think they're the perfect snack. At only 60 calories for the whole thing, you can't beat it for a quick salty treat. I fold one piece into 4 sections and pop it in. Since it has a wasabi seasoning on it, at first taste you think "Oh my God, what have I done", but the heat only lasts for about 3 seconds and then the flavor sets in. You really do have to get these by the 10 pack cause you can easily scarf down 2 boxes without even thinking about it.

review/text: If you like roasted seaweed and wasabi you will love these. One negative reviewer probably does not like wasabi and seaweed. I have had several brands of wasabi seaweed and this is bar far the best! I buy 10 at a time now from Trader Joes. If you can get online, go for it!

review/summary: If heaven came in a bag...
review/text: It would be called Trader Joe's Roasted Seaweed Snack.<br /><br />These dried pieces of seaweed are lightly coated in sesame oil and salt for a crisp, delicious snack. I'd never tried roasted seaweed before but I decided to give them a try. Needless to say, I now consider myself a seaweed addict.<br /><br />Seaweed has many healthy things in it that we most likely don't get from other sources of food we eat. The best thing about this snack is that you can eat the whole bag (and trust me, you will) and it's only 60 calories.<br /><br />You will pay a lot lower price if you buy it in the store rather than from Amazon. Not everyone has a local store to them so at least you have somewhere to buy this yummy treat!
