review/summary: Best Extra Bold dark K-Cup out there!
review/text: Amazon must have deleted the old entry for Timothy's Midnight Magic as it was packaged as 25, instead of the current 24 k-cups per box. At any rate, all the original reviews were also erased it seems. Bad move Amazon!<br /><br />The below was my original review posted here at Amazon on July 17, 2007:<br />My wife and I love this k-cup. We've tested all the extra bold dark roasts out there. In fact, we did blind taste tests and pitted Timothy's Midnight Magic vs. Green Mountain EB Dark Magic, Gloria Jeans EB Black Gold, Van Houtte's Eclipse EB, Green Mountain EB Espresso Blend, Green Mountain EB Sumatran Reserve, Timothy's EB Parisian Nights, Coffee People EB Organic, Coffee People EB French Roast, Tully's EB French Roast and Tully's EB Italian Roast. Yes, we honestly tested them all. Many of the other contenders are fine coffees in their own right and without direct comparison to Midnight Magic, they'd be a fine k-cup. But when compared directly with Timothy's Midnight Magic, we found we chose it every time in blind taste tests. It amazed me when my wife picked it every single time.<br /><br />There is no way you'd be let down by this k-cup if you like extra bold, dark roasted coffee. It's just perfect!<br /><br />A must buy for Keurig owners!

Based on reviews, I ordered this k-cup. What a relief! A great cup of coffee even on the large setting. I have more EB samples coming, but in the meantime this is the champ.

review/text: This is a nice dark blend if you like Charbucks or Peet's. It is quite tasty and has a deep, well-rounded character nnd no bitterness. For those who like a full city roast or a light espresso roast, it is enjoyable on a regular basis if you brew this "Bold" K-cup (read "extra coffee grounds") into the larger (American) Keurig brewer cup size.<br /><br />Yimothy's roasts excellent varietals and blends, as good as or better than anything we have in the US, and it is nice to give our Canadian neighbors some business via Amazon and their excellent prices.

It comes in a zip top bag for storage.  It is medium fine grain and small flakes, moist and white to slightly grey.  The package says Premium, Fine, No. II by Le Tresor.  I have had better salt direct from Guerande, but it cost more.

review/text: I was looking for a night time snack for myself that would satisfy my sugar cravings but not have a ton of calories.  Well this certainly fit the bill.<br /><br />These are so good and the small bags are just the right size.  Yes I could eat a whole box of these in one sitting but that kind of defeats the purpose.  But because these are low in calorie I don't feel guilty if I eat two packs.<br /><br />I didn't even look at expiration dates since I don't care and they're not going to last the month.<br /><br />I do wish they had this in all chocolate but the cinnamon is really good also.<br /><br />I'm really glad I got in on the subscribe and save before they closed it but the price went up.  I saw K-mart has these for $5.99/box which is better but it's worth it to have them delivered.  I don't know why the price hike.<br /><br />All I can say is Yum Yum!

I'd imagine kids would too.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- No high fructose corn syrup.<br />- Crunchy little bite-sized cookies.<br />- Nice chocolate taste that's not fake.<br />- Great to eat in the car, at your desk, or wherever.  It's a portable snack.<br />- Sweet but not sickeningly so.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- I really have no cons other than they will get stale if you don't wrap the bag up tightly.<br /><br />OVERALL OPINION:<br />I enjoy Chocolate Teddy Grahams as either dessert, or a snack with a cup of coffee.  It's a sweet pick-me up that doesn't leave me feeling too guilty.  Cures the need for chocolate, and has a nice crunch that sometimes I really want.  Oh yeah, and they're cute little bears!

review/summary: Tasty treat and no guilt as a meal
review/text: Having a toddler who wants to feed himself but yet cannot quite manage a bowl of cereal on his own is a challenge. This particular product though provides a relatively easy solution in that it is a fruit and grain at the same time.  Still overall you are paying for the convenience and packaging. That is frustrating.  Plus the packages are just over 3oz each. Even my peanut can down 3 of these in 1 sitting. With each being (currently) $1.24 each it creates a very expensive meal.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Easy to use - toddlers can feed themselves<br />Easy to travel - I like to keep some in the car to avoid fast food stops<br />Healthy alternative to some other snacks<br /><br />Cons:<br />Cost!<br />Trash accumulates

review/text: Castello's blue cheese is one amazing product! The distinct and wonderfula aroma is sensational. I love to make blue cheese burgers and dip chicken wings into my homemade blue cheese dip. I have recommended this cheese to my friends and family and they too have enjoyed it. I have tried competitor's blue cheese and none of them stack up with this one. I am sticking to the Castello brand.

review/text: After lightly toasting and grinding to a powder this is the primary ingredient in my home made Curry powder. Curried fruit is an unrivaled joy! I examine Fenugreek kernel by kernel before using and the quality here is nearly perfect. A pack of 6 is probably a lifetime supply since the shelf life of the dried kernels is quite long (if stored in a cool dry place). 5 Stars and deserves it.

review/summary: Wow What a Whew!
review/text: Condiments were designed to complement food; never to overwhelm it. Stronger flavored condiments should be used very sparingly. This is especially true in the case of Colman's Dry Mustard. It takes very little of this rich flavorful spice to go a long way as an enhancing ingredient. Make your own condiment from it. Add a small amount to your mayonnaise, or make your own Dijon. I even like to mix some with cottage cheese for a dip or to top a sliced tomato. Recipes can be found on the internet at such sites as About.com home cooking.<br />If you are feeling really gutsy, mix a small amount with equal parts water and dip your sandwich in it. Whew!

review/text: This stuff is absolutely delicious - and hot. Be sure to follow the instructions about letting it 'work' for about 15 minutes before using it, as that's when the great flavor and the heat develop. Also, I think it's best if you only make what you intend to use during your meal, as it's better if you haven't stored it in the refrigerator for a day or so.

review/summary: Good taste, then it kicks in...
review/text: This is an odd sauce. I love the taste, and at first it did not taste too hot (odd because it is supposed to be one of the hottest sauces you can buy). But about 4 minutes later the heat really kicked in, and it was about as hot as Daves Insanity Sauce. What I love most about this sauce is the taste. They made it so you can really enjoy the taste before the heat kicks in and makes your taste buds inoperable. <p>Oh, this sauce is thin. So if you are used to Daves or 100% Pain, don't just pour thinking it will come out like think catchup. The first time I poured it on a burrito, I got about three times as much as I wanted because the sauce is so thin. Man was that good, although it burned like hell.<p>I think this is a great sauce that everyone who is past the tobasco stage will like. If you find yourself looking for habenero's because jalepenjo's are not hot, then this is for you.

review/text: This isn't the average hot sauce (or "extra hot" sauce) you find in grocery stores.  It has a very nice flavor, then the heat comes on fast.  Very hot.  If you paint small amounts of it onto a burger with a toothpick, you still get the good taste with a more tolerable burn.  If you pour it on like I do, your friends will cringe and you'll want something handy to try to reduce the burn.  I know people who laugh at hot sauce, so I get a kick out of their reaction after trying this.  It's incredibly hot.

review/summary: Flavorful kick to the dirt.
review/text: I first picked the sauce up in 1999 on a senior trip to TN. There was a small shop that sold nothing but spicy foods and sauces. The proprietor of the shop recommended this to me as "100% flavor, 100% heat". He wasn't kidding.<br /><br />To this day, it is still the best tasting hot sauce I have used. I just wish there was a way to harness all of the flavor and put it in a less-spicy sauce so that my friends could enjoy the taste.<br /><br />I would recommend this if you're looking for something that is extremely tasty, right up to the moment it knocks your butt in the dirt.

review/text: Mad dog inferno is one of the rare hot sauces that combines burn your tongue off hot with a nice flavor to boot.  The hot sauce's flavor resembles a worchestershire sauce type of taste with an extremely hot kick that doesn't dissipate for a solid five minutes or so.  Use this sauce very sparingly by itself, and I recommend using it as a way to kick up flavors and or spiciness in dips, stews, chilis or anything else your looking to put an exclamation point on.  As an avid cook and hot sauce aficionado, I highly recommend this hot sauce.

review/summary: The best there is.
review/text: I grew up in Baltimore where the Manning family made this for decades before they sold it to Lake. Fortunately, Lake has not changed the recipe. It's different than other hominys. It isn't individual kernels floating in water. It's a solid mass of hominy, in fact you need to break it up with your fingers - it is pure hominy. Baltimore was always militant about two manufactured food products - Berger's better never change their cookie recipe and Mannings better never change their hominy. If you really like hominy, try this, it is the very best there is. A good breakfast recipe for Manning's Hominy is to heat some stewed tomatoes (to remove the acidity)and add then some sausage. Once the tomatoes have been subduded add the hominy. Lastly, add some cheese (American cheese will melt without requiring a roux if you're lazy like me). Enjoy!

review/summary: Excellent price, good product
review/text: I have used pau d'arco for several years regularly, and have been very happy with the results. This particular extract seems to be of high quality, and the price is certainly right. You could not possibly buy an extract of this potency and quantity for less than a couple hundred dollars if you bought it in pills. If you want to put it in capsules, it is easy to do so, as the powder is free-flowing. I will be a regular purchaser of Forest RX pau d'arco. Just as an aside, other good products I have tried are: Taheebo Life Tea---very expensive but EXTREMELY potent; Nature's Way Pau D'Arco 180 capsules---I wasn't sure this would work because the active principles are bound up in the cellulose matrix of the bark, but it IS very good. I wouldn't use just any powdered pau d'arco bark, however, as it is apparent that Nature's Way uses a very high quality pau d'arco for their capsules; Wisdom Natural's pau d'arco tea (in bags or bulk)---expensive tea, if you drink a lot, but it is wonderful.--- very effective. Taheebo Tea Club (do a google search for this to find website) is also very good, and somewhat cheaper. Pau d'arco bulk tea is the only product sold by this family business, after their grandfather cured of metastatic disease after drinking this tea which was given to him by a friend. They used to tell the story of what precisely happened to their grandfather (who is still alive and healthy after many years) on their website, but all references to it have now been taken off (probably due to FDA oversight after the company became too popular and came to the notice of regulators). Still, you can call them or email them, and they will talk with you freely. They seem very honest and, as a mark of their honesty, do not run down other suppliers' products. I have just ordered pau d'arco tea from San Francisco Herb & Natural Food (again, google this) because I have always been impressed with the quality of their products, but have not yet tried their pau d'arco. So we'll see. If you buy the tea, don't forget to bring a pot of water (glass or stainless steel--not aluminum, will react with the tea)to a boil, throw in a large handful of bark, turn down the heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes or so. When I use the capsules I make sure to take them with a meal containing butter or oil, as the active principles (some of them) are fat soluble and so are better absorbed with fat. And don't forget that the quality of pau d'arco on the market varies from very good to useless, so if you don't notice a difference, it's probably because you used something that was very poor quality. I gave a strong cup of Wisdom Naturals Pau d'arco tea to my mother--who detests anything labeled as 'health food'--without telling her what it was or that it might be good for her--and after she drank it for a few days she called me and said, with wonder in her voice, "That tea is really something special". I never did tell her it was good for her, fearing she'd throw it out if she knew.

review/text: I have not tried the chocolate, but I am looking forward to trying it.  The original tastes like peanut butter.  The texture is a little creamier.  I have been dieting and making positive food changes.  It is only 2 points a serving on the diet I follow.  It is worth a try, especially with a little fruit or jelly!

review/summary: Better 'n Peanut Butter Review - Original and Chocolate flavor
review/text: For those who are counting calories and love peanut butter, the Original flavor is is the answer.  You get the flavor of real peanut butter without all the fat and calories. (Great for those counting points)  The chocolate flavor is not as good as I'd hoped and does not come anywhere close to the flavor of Nutella Hazelnut spread.  I would stick with the original flavor Better 'n Peanut Butter.

review/text: I saw this at target and decided to give it a go. The first taste was not so good but I did not want to give up on it. I stuck it in the refrigerator and tried it again today and I must say I REALLY like it. Do not go into it thinking it is going to be a replica of Peanut butter because it is not but I actually prefer the taste of the Better'n Peanut butter to regular peanut butter.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: If you usually eat natural peanut butter then this stuff will take you by surprise. However anyone who eats grocery store peanut butter and is trying to make the switch to cut some fat out of your diet, Butter'n makes a good substitute. It's similar to Jif or Skippy, only a little gooier, fluffier and a bit sweeter. It's a bit like creamy peanut butter with a little bit of marshmallow cream added to it. I really like it, but there again, if you're looking for a super-natural peanut butter, this ain't it. If you're trying to find a low-fat version of peanut butter, Butter'n is a good choice.

review/summary: An excellent option
review/text: I heard about the Better'n Peanut Butter on the Today Show.  Considering it was HALF the calories of regular peanut butter, I immediately tracked it down and tried it.<br /><br />To explain the taste, you need to understand the texture.  The concoction contains peanut "flour" so, there is a flour-y texture that is a bit strange at first.  I initially tried the peanut butter on a piece of toast -- with sliced bananas and a little cinnamon. That was good.  If I had made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, I think it would have been perfectly interchangeable.  Whatever you're making, I recommend going light on the PB the first couple of times -- to get your feet wet on the different texture -- then jump in!<br /><br />I also tried the PB on sliced apples (again sprinkling a little cinnamon).  I was excited to try this since I love PB and apple.  The good part is, this tastes pretty darn good on the apple.<br /><br />Tonight, I found the "chocolate" version.  It's great too!  I did a combo of their peanut butter AND their chocolate peanut butter, and spread it on an apple (again with a dash of cinnamon).  The taste of the combo: A+.<br /><br />I am hooked on both now.  I look forward to having them -- and my parents are hooked as well -- actually, to be precise, they're hooked on the PB version, not the chocolate.

review/summary: JUST GROSS
review/text: I have been trying to find a low fat peanut butter for ages that tastes decent.  I saw Better N Peanut Butter at my local grocery store this morning and decided to try it.  After one taste, it ended up in the trash.  It tastes GROSS and leaves a very unpleasant and lingering after taste in the mouth.  From now on, I am sticking with my extra crunchy Jiff.  I am just glad that I bought some Jiff just in case the Better N Peanut Butter wasn't good.

review/summary: Salty
review/text: I wanted to like this product because I love the taste of peanut butter...but this stuff was awful!  I liked the smooth texture and the ingredients seemed alright, no high-fructose or partially dehydrogenated oils listed. The prices was a bit expensive but I thought I'd give it a whirl!  End result was: it was just too salty to tolerate.  I tasted a teaspoon of this and could tell right away.  I roll the jar label over and notice that, low and behold, it's got 190mg of sodium PER SERVING.  Considering one serving is two tablespoons, that's a heck of a lot of salt for one little jar.  In fact, 1/4th of the jar would just contain salt.  I don't see how this is a healthy option at all!  It's a good thing that I'm young and don't have any cardiac problems or high blood pressure because if I did, this stuff would just make it worse!  And at 4.99 per bottle, that's an expensive mistake to make, food-wise.  My advice is just to skip it!  Get the nonsweetened nonsalted peanut butter instead and have that with jam.  It'll be so much healthier for you plus it'll taste a million times better.

review/summary: WEIGHT GAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: LOOKING TO GAIN WEIGHT? I wasn't. My favorite smoothie to order is the PB and Strawberry, but they use this product. After 2 smoothies 2x week for two weeks, that's what 4 cups total. My weight has gone up! I'm a size 4, 5'6, 119 lbs. I'm a fitness, health freak, so when my weight goes up, something is wrong! What is it, then? SOY. Anytime I have eaten soy, my tush, thighs, and hips grow rapidly. Soy is a phytoestrogen, a plant estrogen. Women, like me, will put on pounds (around the ovaries: hips, thighs, tush) when consumed. Clifbars are a no no for me, too. This 'magic' low-cal low-fat 'peanut butter' is half soy! I am taking my organic PB to the smoothie shop, so I can have the real deal. The fat in the peanut is good unsaturated fats, why would you want less? Also, a tip. If you would like to feel great, and lose weight fast, try eating according to blood type! I went from 132 to 119 in two weeks! Google it!<br /><br />Ciao!

review/summary: Tastes bad, clumps, not much calorie benefit.
review/text: It tastes bad.  And I use Splenda (sucralose) all the time, so I know the bad taste is not coming from the sucralose.  Also, it's very difficult to get this stuff to dissolve evenly in hot water.  I get clumps of it between my teeth even when I put it in a sealed container and shake it vigorously for a minute, or stir it wildly.<br /><br />Finally, what makes it a "sensible sweet?"  Compare the nutritional information to sugar sweetened Nestle hot cocoa mix:<br /><br />..............Total Calories.....Calories from Fat<br />Nestle..............80...................25.........<br />Swiss Miss........75...................15.........<br /><br />Admittedly, the suggested serving size for Nestle is with 6oz of hot water while Swiss Miss is for 8oz of hot water.  But I've used both in a big 12oz coffee mug and I still find the Nestle is far superior to the Swiss Miss, even when diluted to half of it's recommended concentration.<br /><br />The Nestle does contain real sugar AND corn syrup, yet the calories aren't highly different from the Swiss Miss.  The wretched taste and clumped mixture of the Swiss Miss should not be tolerated for such a small improvement in calories.

review/text: I have to watch my sugar intake and a cup of hot chocolate in the evening is a great treat when I'm craving sweets. I also use a Ninja Master Prep that blends ice into a powder, then I add Swiss Miss and water to make a thick chocolate frosty. My daughter's a soda drinker and even with bottled water, she tends to reach for the sugared stuff. Glad to say she likes this as an occasional treat. Sometimes I add strong coffee to the base with a little more sweetener or  Torani sugar free syrup for a quick frappuccino.

review/summary: Great chocolate drink at a good price
review/text: Like a lot of people I need to lose weight, and while this is not a real low calorie item I like it due to how easy it is to adjust the flavor by just adding more or less, and I can make up a half cup just as easily as a full cup, which really helps curb both hunger and a craving for sweets as long as you use it reasonably, not swilling down cup after cup.  Buying the can is both easier to change taste or amount, but also is much cheaper than by the packet.

review/summary: Hard to find in stores
review/text: Product gets 4 stars for itself and an additional star for being available in large can / pack.<br /><br />We enjoy hot cocoa and always look for no sugar added to minimize the impact on my diabetes. Swiss Miss is one of our preferred brands.<br /><br />Would have helped to have a more accurate description. The product is listed correctly as a pack  of 6 13.8 oz canisters, but then the last bullet on the description states that "Convenient individual envelopes; just add hot water and enjoy". I wasn't sure that the canisters weren't filled with individual serving packets.<br /><br />The manufacturer could have made it even more convenient by providing a single serving measure.<br /><br />Finding this in the stores in the Phoenix area is next to impossible and when it is on the shelf it seems to only be in the small boxes of individual packets. Plus it is costly since it is never on sale.<br /><br />A pack  of 6 13.8 oz canisters will last us quite a while. However, a friend who owns a coffee shop figures it will only be about a 6 week supply for him. None of his suppliers offer this product.<br /><br />Very happy to find it on Amazon.

review/summary: Heartwarmingly Bland
review/text: I love hot chocolate.  It's not just the flavor, really.  It's the childhood connection that is brought up with the aroma.  I even keep canisters of it at work!  Swiss Miss is a traditional favorite brand.  Given my love of the dark liquid and desire to drink it frequently, I really wanted it to have a minimal caloric and carb impact.  The "No Sugar Added" variety seems like the best choice.  It balances the flavor and calorie compromises nicely compared to the "Diet" and I am a big fan of sucralose as a sugar alternative.  However, it is a bit bland, particularly when made with very hot liquid.  I am not sure if it is deadening the sugar substitute's sweetening ability or if it is unrelated.<br /><br />Regardless, when I need a boost without having to worry about getting pudgier, this is the product I always come back to.

review/summary: Warning: Contains Sucralose
review/text: I kept getting this weird taste in my mouth after having this "no sugar added" hot cocoa. I finally took a look at the ingredients and saw that they are using sucralose to sweeten it.<br /><br />Not everyone can taste the sour, artificial sweetener, so it may not be a problem for you, but be warned. If you are sensitive, it's nasty. I also have to say it feels like deception to mark something as "no sugar added" after knowingly adding sucralose, especially when there are still some concerns about the sweetener.<br /><br />I love the regular sugared version, though.
