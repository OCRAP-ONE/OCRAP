review/summary: Convenient packaging
review/text: These are delicious cookies, of course. Rich and buttery. I like the convenience of this packaging: 2 cookies at 100 calories per cookie. I keep trying to eat just ONE at a time, but the are SO good, that I usually eat both of them. At least I'm not eating a whole BOX. I have this on auto deliver so I have a few high quality cookies on hand for myself or guests. Sometimes I'm willing to pay for for good packaging and this is one of those times.

review/summary: convenience packs ROCK!  :)
review/text: These Walker's Shortbread Fingers in single serving packs of two are fabulous!!  Here's why:<br /><br />1)  Yes, as everyone says, these Walker cookies are exceptional.  You may think it's all just buzz, but if you haven't tried them, don't judge us as silly until you do (!).<br /><br />2)  But what happens if you open a box -- you finish it, right!  BAD.  These little suckers aren't the greatest thing for you, to put it mildly.<br /><br />3)  Answer:  single serving packaging!!  It really works.  My husband is addicted to these cookies.  I'd always have a box on hand in case of unexpected guests -- at least, I'd think I had one, but the box would usually have disappeared unexpectedly whenever I went to look for it.  True confessions:  I love them too and was occasionally looking to sneak some for myself!  So having them around just in case was a bad, BAD idea.  But a case full of packs with 2 cookies each is ideal.  Two seems to satisfy my husband's craving -- he almost never takes more than one packet.  And I open a packet occasionally and make 2 cookies last 2 days, instead of a whole box lasting almost forever and my worrying that they'd go stale or attract ants.<br /><br />Bonus:  they're easily packable!  When my husband's expecting an exceptionally tough day at work, I'll usually sneak a pack into his lunch if he hasn't already appropriated one for himself.<br /><br />And when he's especially wiped out at the end of an unusually demanding day, a pack of these really seems to perk him up and help him muster strength for tomorrow.  He brings it upstairs while he's watching TV and waits a while before opening the bag and savoring his treasure.  Whether for lunch or after dinner, the gleam in his eye as he talks about how wonderful it is to have a treat when he's so stressed means a lot to me, especially when I know he's only eating in moderation instead of wolfing down ten or twenty servings at a time.  A case of 24 2-packs (that's how many were in our case in the product <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GCVLX6">Walkers Shortbread Fingers, 2-Count Cookies Packages (Pack of 24)</a>, although this one here has 12 2-packs) has lasted us 3 months already -- a pleasant surprise, given that there are 2 addicts in the house.  :  So our portion-control strategy is working!!!<br /><br />And yes, when we had guests who chose after-dinner tea, these were just the right thing to bring out with it, and I didn't mind opening multiple packs at once and putting the cookies together on 1 plate for serving, knowing that I wasn't either spoiling an entire box, or promoting too rapid consumption of it, just by providing our guests with a few.<br /><br />[I wish two other treasures came in single-serving packets:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FSK58S">LU Herbes De Provence Flatbread Crackers, 4.25-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K8WI1Q">Mary's Gone Crackers, Caraway, 6.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>!!]<br /><br />STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!!

review/text: Who doesn't like Walkers shortbread fingers?  Buying these on a regular delivery plan is perfect; you run out but you know you'll have them again soon without lifting a finger (plus the discount is great)!  I ordered mine on a 60 day plan; but am considering changing to every 30 days.  One or two of these with a cup of coffee is a perfect pick-me-up in the morning when you don't want a heavier breakfast. Great packaging - you get two packs; each pack contains individual little packages of two cookies each.  You can put them in your purse for a snack at work, or put them in your kids lunch packs for a snack.  Not too sweet and the cookie melts in your mouth.

review/text: I've always liked Walkers Shortbread but usually only purchase at Costco during Christmas. Costco has a good price but you need to buy a huge box which is too much for two people. I don't buy smaller amounts at grocery stores since they are outrageously expensive. Amazon's price, was less than $15 with subscription, and  half the super market price. The two cookie packaging is just right and keeps the unused cookies fresh. Prices have changed and you may need to search for the Amazon subscription deal. Also, very fast shipping!

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: First off, the buttery taste of these cookies makes it so delicious to eat. I like how the individual packages are individually packaged so it gives me a way to control my eating. Yes, it's that good that without the individual wrappers, I would probably be eating two or three packs of these cookies. Also, I like how it is packaged in a new "store-display" box with nicely decorated individual packages which helps me put it neatly away in the pantry or cabinet as well as serving guests.<br /><br />My only minor complaint is that sometimes the shortbread fingers "crack" in the package. While this does not affect the taste in any way, I guess it would be nice if the pieces stayed together better. Again, my expectations are probably too high here, but caution needs to be taken so the tasty fingers do not fall to the floor when opening the package.

review/text: I love to try to eat healthier, and I since I really like most whole-grain breads, I was hopeful that this product would be tasty (or at least bearable). Alas, it was not to be. Hmmm...how do I describe its taste? Well, imagine if you took a really *thick* piece of cardboard, maybe from the side of a shoebox, and you soaked it in a puddle of muddy water outside in the sun, for three days or so. Then, you bring it inside and take a nice big bite of the stuff! This is about what this bread tastes like. It was truly one of the worst breads I have ever eaten in my life (probably *the* worst that I have ever bought!). Unless you are a masochist, it's best to avoid this horrible product.

review/summary: Matcha Ice is a Green Tea flavor
review/text: This is a package of about 16 individually wrapped cookies, with a very slight hint of green tea ice cream taste. The cookies are best heated in a microwave. Being individually wrapped makes them handy for things like office snack area or any other communal snack environment where food quality/safety is required. They are a little on the pricey side compared to other cookies, and the cookies are only about 4cm, or 1 inch big, so many westerners may be surprised by this when ordering the product. I am writing this review while on business in Japan, and have just purchased a box of these cookies. The retail price was somewhere in the 300 yen range, making it about 4 dollars US. I enjoyed them, but they are a little too expensive to purchase on a regular basis.

The ten pack variety had enough flavors to please our entire family of seven with no gripes! Re-order form and list of all available flavors and accessories were included with the order. Very pleased with the product. Don't buy a snow cone machine without this purchase to top it off.

review/summary: Good ingredients?  I don't think so....
review/text: Let me start with a positive.... Amazon saved a lot in shipping with these syrups.  If you order directly from the manufacturers web site, you will probably pay twenty dollars or more in shipping which is outrageous!  Now the negatives...  I was born and raised in Hawaii and the delicious shave ice there is a common treat, much like ice cream in the continental US.  Sorry, but these syrups barely taste like the ones in Hawaii.  I sampled the cherry and it tasted very much like cherry cough syrup, yuck!  But that's not what really ticked me off.  Looking at the ingredients listed on the bottle, instead of cane sugar (which Hawaii used to produce and distribute in abundance), the second main ingredient listed after water is high fructose corn syrup.  Double yuck!  I'll stick with the Davinci syrups which use cane sugar and to me and my kids, taste a lot better.  This company needs to rethink it's ingredients, especially when they claim they use quality ingredients.

review/summary: Great Variety and High Quality
review/text: These shave ice syrups did not dissapoint!  I bought some less expensive syrups at another retailer, and they were dissapointingly thin and less flavorful.  In contrast, these syrups are viscous, tasty, and really cling to the ice as they should.  Any lover of shave ice or snowcones should pick up this 10 pack from Amazon.  I looked all over the web trying to find a better deal, and Amazon absolutely has the best price.  Even better, they were on my doorstep about 3 days after ordering.

This assortment is a great value, but if you have lots of family and friends over for your frozen treats, they will go fast! I highly recommend them.

review/summary: A Great Fantastic Assortments Of Flavors For Snow Cone Treats
review/text: I' have bought from this seller before and have always been pleased at both the flavors and the quality of the syrups and now that I can get ten flavors shipped at this rate and at this price it's a real bargain for me.  The one thing with this brand is that unlike the cheaper ones this one almost merges with the ice instead of just flowing off and becoming a watery juice on the bottom of your snow cone cup or saucer,  also the flavor of these syrups aren't watered down either as you taste each one the flavor stays with the ice treat with hardly a taste of some chemically treated flavoring like some of the other brands.  Case in point I bought one melon flavor syrup from the store supposedly guaranteed to taste great but when I did it didn't taste like anything except like sugared water,  there was no flavor at all and the only thing you can tell was that the snow cone was green that's about it.  So if you're really looking for a great icy treat this is the one to get and while you might find it a bit pricey once you try it I guaranty that you'll see why it's worth the price after all...

review/summary: Great snow cone syrups!
review/text: I bought these for my son, who had just bought a snow cone maker for his family and was having trouble buying snow cone syrups locally in Minnesota in February.  I did some research online and ordered this assortment for them to try.  They called up the day they received them and raved!  My son said the snow cones made with these syrups put big smiles on his little ones faces.  Their family of four has enjoyed trying all the different flavors, and each one seems to have a different favorite, but they are all big fans of the lemon-lime.  We'll be buying this assortment again without hesitation when they need refills!  Would highly recommend.

review/summary: Flavor that takes me back
review/text: Ice is just ice, but when I was a kid, I couldn't get enough of that sweet snow cone flavor. Now I know where to get it.<br />This 10 pack is an absolute cornucopia of flavors.  Some of them, I didn't know existed. Now I can find my true favorites, and order all I want. Of course, My favorite may not be in this 10 flavor pack, because they have at least 80 flavors to choose from, not to mention the infinite number of flavors that YOU can invent by mixing to taste. Don't wait for the dog days of summer to get yours, I love these flavors year round and don't want to get caught short. I've used it to add exciting flavors to my coffee, and you can, make great ice cream sodas, and mix with water and freeze for treats. Don't get caught without it.:)

review/summary: Disgusting & Unnatural-tasting
review/text: i bought these as a christmas gift for my son. i read one review that mentioned how the cherry flavour tasted like cough syrup and i have to agree. i'm an idiot for ignoring that review because i had a feeling that person would be right. i'm returning them on monday, i can't imagine the rest of them tasting any better when they all have the same ingredients. i got these because they would make for instant sno-cones whenever my son or his friends wanted them (rather than waiting for me to make a syrup) but i'm just going to plan ahead or something and make syrups. i can't feed this to my son or anyone else's child in good conscience. while they are nice & thick, that cherry flavour left such an unnatural and chemical taste in my mouth that i can't justify keeping them. for $60 original price, i expected MUCH more. if you do buy them (and i wouldn't recommend it) be sure to get those black bottle caps for them so you can regulate how much comes out.

review/summary: Oh, the flavors we will taste!
review/text: A while back I bought the three pack of Hawaiian Shaved Ice flavors Blue Raspberry,cherry, and grape.  My family loved these flavors, but my 8 year old loves mixing flavors, so as soon as this ten pack arrived she mixed up a strawberry/watermelon/banana snow cone.  I tried a pina colada/banana snow cone and later a Tigers Blood.  I'm not sure why its called that, but it is delicious.  The yellow banana syrup will probably bring out some yellow snow jokes, but its worth it for the taste.  I love the fact you don't have to refrigerate these, because I certainly don't have room in the refrigerator for all ten bottles, and I suspect my daughter will try mixing all ten in one snow cone before long! :)

review/summary: Great flavors for snow cones
review/text: I purchased the 10-pack Hawaiian shaved ice snow cone syrups, and so far have been delighted with them.  We have tried three flavors so far -  Cherry, Root Beer, and Tiger's Blood.  The Tiger's Blood has so far been the favorite, but all three are very good - nice, smooth flavors that are not weak at all, and not over-powering either.  Much better than some of the others I've tried from the grocery stores.  Everyone, including the adults, have enjoyed them, and though I've made my own, these are better - and much less work!  My grandson, who is 7, recommends mixing flavors; his particular favorite is the tiger's blood mixed with the root beer.  I highly recommend these syrups and am looking forward to enjoying the remaining flavors.<br /><br />The syrups arrived very quickly, and were very well packed - no cracked or leaky bottles.  I'll order these again!

review/summary: Yummy syrup for Hawaiian Shaved Ice!!
review/text: I ordered this set as I am a HUGE sno cone fan and I bought my own machine for my home.  I did a little bit of research on the prices and taste of some other brands of syrup versus the Hawaiian Shaved Ice syrups and these are the best by far.<br /><br />Some of the others were too sweet while some others were too weak and when you put it on the shaved ice, it was just lightly flavored.  But not so with Hawaiian Shaved Ice syrups.  Perfect for your sno cones every time you use it as it is not too sweet or not to weak.<br /><br />The product was delivered promptly and a few bottles had a split cap and I contacted the company and they promptly replied.  Nothing spilled during shipping as they are sealed on top.  But it was very nice of them to contact me so quickly as I was just letting them know that some of the caps were damaged during shipping.  Excellent customer service!<br /><br />The only small drawback is the shipping cost.  I know I bought 10 bottles of syrup but it was a bit pricey.  Other than that, the product was promptly shipped and received it a few days later.  I am happy with the syrup and this company!

review/text: These are really good tasting flavors, my only complaint would be they aren't big enough and when you buy them in the  10 pack that they dont come with the lid that squirts the flavor out, instead it is just a covered lid which you have to remove to pour in the flavor thus you use more of the juice then needs to be used.

review/summary: Snow Cones
review/text: The 'Easter Bunny' brought this item for my grandson and granddaughter this year.  We purchased the snow cone machine last year and needed more syrup for this summer.  It is a wonderful idea for the kids to make their own snow cones and share with friends.  They have many choices for flavoring so everyone is happy.

review/summary: This syrup is ok...
review/text: I was expecting this syrup to be better than what it actually was.<br /><br />One thing that is good about this syrup is it's thick and has a somewhat strong flavor, so your snow cone won't be watery when you get to the bottom.<br /><br />What I don't like about this syrup is the overall taste.  It's made with high fructose corn syrup, so it has that corn syrup taste like the syrups purchased from your local stores.<br /><br />I found this other company (Southern Snow) that most of our local snow cone stands purchase from to make their own syrups.  [...] You can purchase the flavor concentrates which requires you to mix with sugar and water - but it's well worth it, if you want that authentic snow cone flavor.

review/summary: Great chip - but I'm unsure why so expensive here.
review/text: Okay, if you are familiar with and love Old Bay, these are a fantastic Old Bay potato chip.  Easily available in East Coast grocery within the Utz delivery range (Maine to South Carolina), they will always disappear quickly on any picnic table.<br /><br />No offense to the vendor here, but $36.99 (plus shipping!) for a 4-pack of family-sized bags is outrageously overpriced.  Especially when you consider you can order them directly from Utz on their web site.  There, 3 10 oz bags are $12.99, 5 10 oz bags are $20.99, and 10 10 oz bags are $39.99.  Or you could even get 60 snack bags for $17.99!  Not sure about shipping cots from Utz, but the mark-up here is definitely steep.<br /><br />If you live on the East Coast between Maine and South Carolina, just go check out your grocery store for these chips - they are well worth it.  If you're a fan out of the area, just order them from Utz.

review/text: This one is truly better than theater popcorn.  It is to die for. I make air-popped pop corn and sprinkle this Buttery Topping on it along with some Kernel's Ranch or other flavor topping and popcorn salt, ummmmmmmmm, finger-lickin' good. I did try others to compare; but, this one wins, hands down. I guess there are some calories to it because it does have oils in it; but, who counts calories when you eat popcorn? Since the popcorn is hot air popped, there is no oil except for this topping if you want to ease your mind about calories. I have been eating popcorn for 60+ years; so, I have tried many kinds of popcorn and toppings/flavorings. I highly recommend this one to all popcorn connoisseurs...you won't be sorry.

review/summary: Count Me Among Those Who Consider Felidae a Life Saver
review/text: I have two feral rescues who have lived with me since 2005.  One, Commander Fluffypants, I trapped as a young kitten.  He already had  considerable parasite damage to his intestines, and he has always been very very sensitive to what's in his food.  I tried feeding many high quality super premium diets before discovering inadvertently that Iams Indoor Hairball Control was a food that, unlike everything else I had tried, would not give him projectile diarrhea.  Less than two months later, I managed to trap his mother, Mary-Kate, right before she dropped four more kittens who went through the TNR group to wonderful adoptive homes.  I thought she would go back to her colony when her kittens were weaned, especially after that whole spaying thing, but she stayed inside and has been my strange little indoor feral queen ever since.  And she did fine on the Iams.<br /><br />Until about 6 weeks ago.  I do not know what changed.  She had some teeth pulled, but that was about a month before the trouble started.  At first, she was just yarfing about every other day, and it looked like maybe she was eating too fast from time to time, so I stopped filling their bowls and leaving the food down and gave her small amounts.  Didn't work.  I tried the feeding balls to slow her down.  Also didn't work, but I wasn't that concerned, because she was eating, drinking, using the box, and seemed fine.<br /><br />Until she wasn't.  She got really sick fairly quickly, and I was extra-worried for her, because she tolerates very little physical contact, which makes medical intervention difficult.  Her vet, a wonderful feral cat doctor, thought she might have developed a grain allergy, so I tried a couple of grain-free foods (thoroughly unsuccessfully) before this one.  She keeps this down just fine, and Fluffypants has experienced no ill effects from it.  They both are doing great, no stomach issues, no weight gain (after M-K got back up to her usual perfect self) and I credit the Felidae.

review/summary: Finally, a good GF bread mix
review/text: As a lifelong baker of all sorts of breads and other family recipes using regular flour, when I unexpectedly developed an intolerance for gluten I thought it would be easy to find good recipes using substitute ingredients for the flour.  I spent a lot of time and money trying GF bread recipes.  I bought recipe books, used all kinds of flours, and was ultimately not satisfied with any of them.  The breads were crumbly or not a pleasing texture in the mouth or, in the case of garbanzo bean flour,  bubbly in the tummy.  And forget the store bought GF breads -- what do they do to some of them that they last for months on the shelf (?!), and others that are kept in the store refrigerator seem dry and tasteless.<br /><br />Then I stumbled upon the Namaste bread mix.  I love it.  Bread that tastes, smells and feels like a real bread!<br /><br />I do make a few alterations to the package instructions.  I add a teaspoon of sugar to the yeast/water mixture to boost the proofing.  Sometimes I add caraway seeds and Italian herbs to the dough, or cinnamon+a teaspoon vanilla+1/8 C. sugar.  And as soon as I take the bread hot out of the baking pan, I butter or olive oil the top and wrap the whole loaf in aluminum foil to keep in the moisture while it cools.  Then I slice the cooled bread, put pieces of wax paper between the slices and freeze the loaf in a freezer bag.  That makes it easy to pop one slice at a time in the microwave for 30 seconds (served warm, it's even more moist and tasty).  One of these days I'm going to try making hamburger buns by baking the dough in small bowls.<br /><br />This bread mix is easy and, compared to buying GF bread in the stores or the price of amassing the various ingredients to try to make your own from scratch, it's not all that expensive.  I buy it in boxes of 6 from Amazon because it's the best price by far that  I've found anywhere.

review/summary: Pretty Good Bread
review/text: This is a pretty good gluten-free bread, but in my family's view, not as super delicious as Pamela's.  I like this bread for a basic sandwich bread--it has a decent texture and no strong or off flavors.  And rises to a nice size.  However, I found it to be much dryer than Pamela's GF bread mix.  I'm not sure what the solution to the dryness is--I'm going to try the strategies other reviewers recommended about putting olive oil on the top or adding applesauce to the mix.  (Note, though, that even though I say this loaf is somewhat dry, that's in comparison to Pamela's; Namaste is far moister than the typical Bread For Life, Kinnikinnick premade breads.  So it's a huge improvement over those and worth making just for that reason).  Note that it is also much less sweet than Pamela's bread, which my children eat like candy when I cut it open warm.  Thus, it may be better for people who have diabetic concerns (I'm just guessing, but Pamela's bread is VERY sweet).  Note that I've tested both breads only by using a bread maker.  The breads worked beautifully that way.

review/text: So far, this is HANDS DOWN the best gluten free bread mix I've tried.  It was super easy, the instructions are right on the bag.  I substituted almond milk for the water and it's very tasty, and I used coconut oil as the oil.  Beware though, if you can't do eggs this mix isn't for you, unless you know the magic of egg substitution.  Fortunately, I can do eggs.  I left it in for an extra ten minutes after the foil was on it, and that was a good choice, it gave the bread the perfect texture.  It's slightly on the texture of a good wheat bread, but it has just the right flavor for toast or sandwiches with no weird aftertaste, and makes a large loaf.  Now the only dangers are eating all of it too fast and not having more mix to make another loaf!
