review/summary: These cherries are the best!
review/text: I bought a box of these dried cherries while in Traverse City this summer.  I had intended to divide up into small bags to give away to friends but they were so good I ended up eating the whole box.  I eat some every morning on my oatmeal.  I am glad that Amazon offers them on an automatic ship program so I don't have to worry about running out.

review/text: most reliable, best dried cherries.  Don't hesitate.  I mix them with walnut halves and bring to work for a healthy snack.  Great to keep in car for that ride home when you're starving and have to stop at the store to pick up groceries and don't want to buy out the entire store - have your walnut and cherry snack before going in - saves my grocery budget from busting.

review/summary: These were good
review/text: I wouldn't describe these as the best dried cherries I have ever eaten but they were pretty good.<br /><br />Traverse uses oil with the cherries to prevent caking, a little to much in my opinion.  These cherries unlike the blueberries I bought from them were not as effected taste wise as the blue berries were.<br /><br />I would buy these again, the portion compared to the price makes them a great deal and their taste was rather enjoyable.<br /><br />These are not the best cherries out there but they are worth buying and their price is a great deal.  Just make sure you have a large enough container to store them in and I recommend storing them in the fridge.

review/summary: Want to love
review/text: I really wanted to love this tea but unfortunately I didn't. This Amazon deal is a great price for the sampler pack and three boxes it a great starting point.<br /><br />I've struggled with a lot of morning sickness and only in that past two weeks (I'm now 22 weeks) has it really decreased.  I've lost weight and been on meds to combat the vomitting.  I was really hoping the Morning Wellness Tea would help but alas it didn't and within 30 min of drinking every cup I would vomit it; I tried it at variouss times of the day, sometimes when I felt nauseous and other times when I didn't.  The worst part though was how much it burned coming back up.  The positive - it did taste good!  The Peaceful Mama Tea settled a bit better and I probably only vomitted about half of that and it also tasted good. However, I didn't feel any of the calming benefits.  By far the best tea in this sampler was the Heartburn Tea.  It tasted good and did decrease the heartburn!  I never vomitted it (amazingly enough).  Being that I am not in my third trimester yet I haven't tried the third trimester tea yet.<br /><br />I had truly hoped that the Morning Wellness Tea would've helped because various reviews on Amazon and Mama's Angel site had just been amazing so I wanted to share my different experience.

review/text: There are a few notable differences in the look of the product. I posted some pictures (sorry that they're kind of fuzzy) with captions so that you could read what they said. I do like the nest on the belly look better than the naked angel picture. (Just in case you were wondering.)<br /><br />I've only tried the Peaceful Mama Tea so far, but it was good. I was afraid that it might be strong, but it was very mild. I was able to drink it without any additives (ie. honey). It was quite good.<br /><br />I'm hopeful that it will help me sleep better when my husband has to work nights and I get a little anxious about being home alone. I'm also looking forward to the heartburn tea. I hope it is as good as the 'peaceful' tea.

review/text: It's my regular cereal now. Cinnamon is a strong spice so yes it dominates. Too sweet, based on the amount of carbs in a serving its higher than some by two or three grams but with the amount of fiber including four grams of soluble, the net carbs is reduced. Only knock here I wish it was available through the auto delivery service as this price appears to be way too high, its about $4.50 in the local store for one box.

review/summary: FROMM SURF&TURF
review/text: My dogs love this stuff. I was currently on Taste Of Wild until I found out they were Owned by DIAMOND, bad bad company and they hide it very well. Anyways, the kibble is real small and my dogs do real well on the this formula.<br />My dogs have only been on Surf & Turf for about 3 wks and they are doing awesome on it. This stuff must taste really really good becuase my dogs go right after it. This is one of the top grain free dry kibble's out on the market. When you read this comment you must slowly introduce this kibble to them if not your going to have problems with there waste & they might vomit. It took me 3wks to totally switch them over. Anyways this stuff rock and yes I would recommend this to highly active dogs only. Here are the ingredients for the GRAIN FREE SURF&TURF. I would rate Surf&Turf & Orijen the top two dog food companies on the market. The only difference is FROMM is a US comapny & ORIJEN is FROM CANADA/<br /><br />Salmon, Duck Meal, Potatoes, Pea Flour, Sweet Potatoes, Duck, Chicken Fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols and citric acid), Dried Tomato Pomace, Salmon Meal, Whole Dried Egg, Pea Protein, Chicken, Flaxseed, Cheese, Salmon Oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols), Chicken Broth, Carrots, Broccoli, Cauliflower, Apples, Green Beans, Lecithin, Chicken Cartilage, Potassium Chloride, Cranberries, Blueberries, Salt, Chicory Root Extract, Alfalfa Sprouts, Yucca Schidigera Extract, Folic Acid, Parsley, Lactobacillus Acidophilus, Bifidobacterium Longum, Lactobacillus Plantarum, Enterococcous Faecium, Vitamin A, D3, E, B12 Supplements, Choline Bitartrate, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Ascorbic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine Mononitrate, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Biotin, Zinc Sulfate, Ferrous Sulfate, Manganous Sulfate, Copper Sulfate, Cobalt Carbonate, Calcium Iodate, Sorbic Acid, Iron Proteinate, Zinc Proteinate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Proteinate, Sodium Selenite.

review/summary: no more stomach problems
review/text: My golden retriever puppy had weeks of stomach problems and lots of expensive and unsuccessful testing to try to determine the problem. My puppy trainer suggested I try this grain free food. I did and his problems cleared right up. It is expensive but has all natural and healthy ingredients and should actually reduce vet bills in the long run since he is such a healthy dog now. I plan to start feeding my cat Fromm food now too. She likes the smell of the salmon in the dog's food so I'll try the salmon cat food soon. This company makes quality food for pets and produces it here in the United States.

Our dog's coat shines, she barely scratches, no more watery eyes, and her poop is firm and less smelly. All in all, it's great quality food.<br /><br />Plus it's made in the USA which gives me a little more peace of mind about the quality of the food. The only downside is that it smells fishy and the fishy smell tends to linger on my dogs face.

He's tried some other flavours in the Fromm line, but so far he seems like like this one the best. His coat got much more soft and shiny since he's started eating it and he gets compliments at the dog park all the time. He's a cocker spaniel so the small/average size kibble is great. Would highly recommend. I believe this flavour is also grain free, which is a bonus.

review/text: My four year old chihuahua has had epilepsy since she was about a year old. After having serious seizures about every two weeks I took her to the vet and he prescribed her phonobarbital. After researching the horrendous side effects that dogs experience while on this medicine I decided to look for a natural method. After hours apon hours of researching I found this food and I am SOOOOO thankful I did. Almost immediatly after feeding her this food her seizures stopped and she has not had a seizure in a year and a half. Thank you lord for this dog food. My dog is my world and her seizures are gone. Another effect from this dog food is her coat, she use to have dry brittle hair and my husband constantly joked around about her being "mangy" she now has a full coat of beautiful hair. On top of all the wonderful benifits, my dog LOVES this food. Fromm four start surf and turf is highly recommended, your dog will thank you!

review/summary: My pup gobbles this food up!
review/text: Fromm Surf & Turf is a great, healthy dog food. Small kibbles for any size dog (like the size of an eraser head on a pencil). Smell is not over pungent like some of the cheaper brands.<br /><br />My 5 month old pup was on Natural Balance from the rescue group that I got him from. I switched to Fromm when he had some while at a friends house and he gobbled it up, which he had never done before. He never fails to eat everything that is given to him. In fact, sometimes I wet the food a little so it will slow him down!<br /><br />I am switching him to Fromm Gold for Puppies until he gets a little older (per the vets request). He is steadily gaining about a pound a week, which is perfect.<br /><br />Lastly, I am happy that it is made locally here in Wisconsin.

review/summary: Fromm Four-Star Surf & Turf vs Blue Buffalo Wilderness Salmon
review/text: My 2 Minature Schnauzers are 3yrs old and picky eaters. They were occassionaly spoiled by me adding chicken breast or turkey to their dry food. They eventually got bored of the Fromm Surf & Turf but for the first month loved to eat it. Yes, it's more expensive than the other dry foods but the ingredients used helped my prevent break-outs that one of my dogs were experiencing from allergies. I switched them to the Blue Buffalo Wilderness and it has higher protein and Omega fatty acids. The dogs enjoyed the change in food but it gave them both gas and one of them had diarrhea. I like the ingredients of the Blue Buffalo but according to my vet some owners are complaining about the same effects on their dogs because it's very rich. I'm remaining with the Fromm simply because of the quality and it's grain less so it helps my dog with allergies.

review/text: I've been using Fromm Surf N Turf in my rotation (which has come down to this and the beef frittata veg by Fromm) over the last several months.<br />First, I have an itchy/scratchy bichon.  Surpringly she does not have food allergies, but environmental allergies.  She gets better and worse, depending on the season.  Her coat is nice, skin, stool, all good.<br /><br />Next I have a sensitive tummy Portuguese Water dog who cannot have any grain AT ALL.  Surf N Turf is perfect and she digests it well.  I've tried several other foods and she just cannot handle foods with grain in it, not even the 'easy to digest' rice formulas.<br /><br />Even my little chihuahua, Cookie, does great on it.  Beautiful, soft and full coat, nice teeth, breath, stool and overall health.<br /><br />I do feed this as 70% of their overall diet, the other 30% being from The Honest Kitchen (Zeal and Love formulas).<br /><br />This is a food I've happily recommended!  And I don't see myself feeding anything else. Pleased with the customer service as well!

These lovely red speckled beans grow to the size of a quarter and you can only eat one at a time, because they are so big!  Soft and delicious, if soaked overnight in boiled water....cooked most of the next day without salt until the end.....flavored in the Southwestern tradition, with a couple of hot thin chillies which we removed before eating.  We served these in their own broth with fresh chopped sweet onion and grated cheese, along with a side dish of carmelized mushrooms and squash, and steamy hot Dark Rye Bread for a fantastic meal!  The colors were devine and my darling husband even peeled slices out of the squash so they were stripped!  Magic!

review/text: I boughts these runner beans after doing an Internet search for the kind of beans I grew up eating in Puebla, Mexico...Ayocotes. These were fantastic! Giant size and full of flavor and texture. I cook them in the slow cooker on high for about 7 hours with a chunk of onion and a tablespoon of olive oil. When they are cooked I caramelize some more onion in olive oil and add a tablespoon of flour, then drop the beans in. Season wih a coupes bay leaves and oregano and add salt to taste when they boil. Now, if you want refried Ayocotes you must smash them (or put them in the blender) then season with a crushed avocado leaf! (discard the middle stem). Ready to enjoy some authentic Mexican Ayocotes? Try them, you won't be disappointed! Reminds me of my grandmother's kitchen :)

review/summary: Saved my cat's life twice?
review/text: About 6 months ago, I found out that my kitty has kidney disease. He was extremely ill, and I was planning on putting him down if he got any worse. About that time, I got a few different cans of Friskies food. He liked the Senior Meaty Bits best, and would eat almost a can a day. He made an almost full recovery very quickly.<br /><br />Fast forward a few months and my kitty gets very sick again. He's worse this time, has trouble walking, and won't eat anything consistently, which makes the disease even worse. I was actually planning on where he would be buried. I tried to feed him meaty bits, and he absolutely loved it, but he would just lick off the gravy. I decided to try putting it through the food processor, and sure enough he gobbled it all down. I guess the meaty bits were too hard for him to chew in his weakened state.<br /><br />Now it is the only food he will eat consistently, and he begs for it. I know it is meant to help with urinary infections, but I wonder if it helps with kidneys too. I am so relieved to have found my product, and I hope my kitty will be eating it for years to come.

review/text: At about 3 years of age, our cat would have bladder infections several times a year (straining at the litter, staying there for 5 min+ at a time, only a little urine and it was blood-tinged).  We had been feeding her only on indoor cat dry food.  After many trips to the vet and rounds of antibiotics, I read that some cats with this problem do better on wet food - something to do with not drinking enough water or just not getting enough fluids in general.  For the past 4 years, she has not had one bladder infection!  Friskies Chicken Dinner in Gravy Special Diet is the only one she likes the taste of.

review/summary: Good product, great shipping, lots of dented cans.
review/text: Once in a while I need to order these overnight, as I did with this - it's wonderful to be able to get them so quickly, but I do wish they did not use MOSTLY dented cans. It doesn't always happen, but in this shipment it was the case.  It's not due to the packaging, as they were very well packaged. They apparently choose dented cans and as these cost more than in the supermarket, I don't appreciate it.

review/summary: WONDERFUL FOOD FOR MY TNR PROGRAM
review/text: One of the most rewarding projects I have taken on is fixing 60 cats for a TNR program. Purchasing the cat food and getting it home can be overwhelming BUT not when I go to Amazon. I shop their sales and purchase by the cases, I buy the ones that say Super Saver and get free shipping right to my door. What was once getting very hard for me is now made possible again. My cats love all the flavors and have a huge selection to choose from. The packages are easy to open and so are the cans. I wish the meat and gravy ones could come in bigger cans but I can't complain just smile and open 24-40 cans a day.Thanks Amazon and Friskies for making me part of your family  :)

review/text: Gosh! What next? A 24-ounce bag of raw, shelled hemp seeds. Well, I've consumed a certain amount of hemp in my youth, but we threw the seeds away. Pity. They're rather good when prepared right, and these are well prepared. They're called Hemp Hearts and I  stumbled upon them at Costco. Rather interesting. These little gems are really packed with nutrients and the protein and fiber are way up there. Plus, would you believe, there's no sodium. Yeah, and they taste rather good too. I just like to eat them by the spoonful right out of the bag. Plus, I'll eventually I get around to sprinkling them on things also. Who'd have ever thunk? I wonder if you can smoke them?<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Not suitable for under 9 months?
review/text: Our pups ate these, although they weren't entirely enthusiastic about them at first, but I wouldn't deduct points for that necessarily.  What I am concerned about is after I gave them each a chew, I noticed on the bag that these aren't suitable for dogs under 9 months.  I didn't see this mentioned on the product page, and I emailed the company to find out why (is it an issue with a certain ingredient, digestibility, etc.), but have yet to receive a response.  I have two 7.5 month, 50+ lb dogs, so I'm not too worried about the issue, but I'd like to get an answer before I give them more.  This note should be on the product page, as well as in larger print on the package (it's only listed in the fine print on the back) if it's necessary to note in the first place.

I've tried many products, and he likes some of the softer ones from the pet store, but they are full of filler and other products I can't pronounce.<br /><br />These are not only super healthy (veggie based, no wheat or gluten), but he LOVES them.  He gets one every day, and within two weeks his teeth have only half the build up they used to.<br /><br />Great fun shapes, reasonable price, healthy for the dog.  I'm SOLD.

Great for a medium or large sized dog but for little dogs definitely buy the little ones :)

review/summary: Simple, few ingredients, long lasting chewie!
review/text: I bought these at a local pet store and my dogs love them. They only have like a half dozen ingredients and no corn or wheat. My dogs are pugs and aren't real aggressive chewers, but they still manage to get through anything I give them in a relatively short amount of time. These lasted quite some time for my dogs! I'd say 15-20 minutes, instead of the usual 2-5 minutes. I've tried the alligators, toothbrushes, and the criss cross. All in the large size. I would recommend the toothbrush or the alligator, the criss cross seems small for a "large" and didn't last quite as long. I'm glad to have found these on Amazon, so I'm paying less than $2 a piece instead of $3 from the pet store.

This is a good cereal that stays crunchy in milk for a decent (but not too long) amount of time. It WOULD be nice if they could make this cereal a  little softer because it gets tiring dealing with a torn-up roof, but it tastes so darned good! Crunch Berries and Peanut Butter Crunch also taste pretty good.

A 3/4 cup serving of just the cereal has 1.5g of fat, 110 calories, 12g of sugar, no trans fat, and has some vitamins in it. It has 100% of folic acid - if that means something to you.

review/text: This tea is tasty, but more importantly, it knocks back queasiness starting with the first mouthful. I don't even sweeten it, but it tastes very good anyway. I put two tea bags in with 4 cups of water, and let it brew. It's good hot or cold, and I'll often make four cups at night, and save two of them for morning.<br /><br />I have persistent morning sickness, it lasts all day, strikes whenever I'm up, stressed, or when my blood sugar drops, and this is one of the four things I am rarely far from.<br /><br />For super fast relief, I will peel a bit of skin off a lime and just smell the lime while the tea is brewing. Also, the "Happy Mama" spray from the same company works very, very well.

My sweet hubby bought this tea for me along with a bunch of other hopeful remedies for the hellish stomach upset I was feeling. Skeptical, I decided to give the tea a try and boy was a I glad I did. I would sip the warm tea slowly and much to my surprise it helped!!! My nausea would get so bad I didn't want anything in my stomach including liquid, but sipping this tea slowly seemed to ease the upset. It's a really comforting tea and I'm so thankful I had it!

I had really bad morning sickness with my first child, and this and low-sodium saltine crackers were the only things that calmed my stomach down.  Now I'm pregnant again, and living overseas, I had my mom send me four boxes of this tea, to be sure I had enough to get me through at least the first trimester which is usually the hardest.<br /><br />I love that it's organic, that it has ginger and mint which are naturally great stomach soothers, and the addition of orange peel and chamomile give it a great flavor balance.  It's good with or without sweetening, unlike some teas, and it goes down easy, even on an empty stomach.  It also says it's safe for the whole family, so you don't have to be expecting an Angel Baby to use it!

Perhaps if enough people start purchasing these, the price will come down a bit. The grass fed beef does not taste gamey either. I do wish they were certified organic though. My guess is that they are from organic cows on small farms but these farms don't want to pay for organic certification due to price.

review/summary: weak in flavor
review/text: I bought Chai tea before that was not decaff and I loved it. Unfortunately, I don't remember the brand. I bought this so I could drink it in the evening and not worry about caffeine keeping me awake. I received it today and had 2 cups so far.  It has a very weak flavor compared to the other one I bought. I guess it would be OK with alot of sugar and milk but the other one I tried didn't need it. I won't buy it again.

review/summary: Addicted!!
review/text: I am a lemon sea salt addict! I can't get enough of that flavor. They are all delicious flavors, and well worth the $$.<br /><br />My only criticism is that you really have to pay close attention to how long you cook it for. I cooked my first bag for 3 minutes, as recommended, listening for the popping to slow down, but it never did and half the bag burned. I've found that 2 minutes and 30 seconds works best in my microwave even though it leaves a considerable amount of un-popped kernels.<br /><br />Overall a wonderful product that I will continue to indulge in.

review/summary: Great Popcorn
review/text: This is some great popcorn.  I first got this popcorn through Quinn Popcorn's kickstarter campaign and ever since I tried it I have fallen in love.  I am not by any means a healthy organic person but I read their campaign watched the videos and thought it was worth supporting and I am glad I did.  This is some of the best microwave popcorn that I have had.  The parmesan and Rosemary is my favorite with the Vermont maple second and lemon third.  It is amazing thing to know you can take an idea, flesh it out and really create something new and be able to sell it to the world.  To know all the details of the organic-ness of the popcorn and stuff like that just go to the website, but for me two cool things are that to bag is compostable and you add the oil and seasonings after you pop the popcorn so you can control if you put all of it on or just some.  It is very yummy.

review/summary: Simply the best!
review/text: Let me start off by saying that I seldom write reviews for products, even if I think they're terrific. This has more to do with the fact that I generally wait to see which way the wind is blowing before I jump in. Not so with Quinn Popcorn. I was one of the lucky group that happened upon their Kickstarter campaign and I couldn't be happier about it. We received our mixed case about two weeks ago and every time we want a snack we have to weigh the desire for an amazingly tasty treat with our limited supply. Is it really a "popcorn worthy" movie/episode/? Now that it will be available through amazon we will no longer be forced to resort to less tasty or more processed options. I think you probably get the idea by now that we are fans. Let me finish with some actual critique of the product. The flavors are excellent and the preparation is simple. Truly a great product well worth your snack money.

review/summary: New idea with a old product, fantastic popcorn!!!
review/text: Microwave popcorn, healthy right? Wrong, look at the package feel that glob of Crisco and oils solidified in the bag, that all ends up in you, your arteries, digestive tract etc.  I first heard of Quinn on kickstarter, I watched their video and could tell they had a great story, were passionate, and really identified a problem and were doing something about it.  I gave to their cause and got the popcorn, I figured if nothing else I was helping out a American startup trying to make it.<br /><br />I received the popcorn and can tell you just on the packaging alone, with the detail on the box, and the bag, a lot of thought went into it the presentation of their product.  They probably took weeks just planning the box and bags trying to create a moment for you.  It worked, just like with a cereal box my daughter and I read the box and followed the instruction and made our first batch (maple and sea salt).  My daughter mixed up the bag we shook it and ate.  It was awesome. Since then I have all flavors and each one was subtle but very pronounced in your mouth.  They did a great job of balancing the flavors perfectly.  My favorite is the maple sea salt but surprisingly the lemon and sea salt is a very close second, I like the rosemary as well, but I am all out of it, so I need more to be sure...;-)<br /><br />The negative sort of, we are so used to genetically modified and specially bred corn to yield high results and predictive cooking, we forgot the old days.  This popcorn brings me back to the 70's when I was a kid.  You really have to watch the corn pop to be sure, you do not burn it.  So like any good cook, you need to be involved in the cooking, no bag is the same and while one may take 3 min another bag may take 2 min and 50 sec.  The corn is not uniform and you will have more than expected un-popped Kernels, that is the only downfall, sort of.<br /><br />Yes, it is expensive. However, think about this, they are doing this by hand, you can be part of something new, and it is fresh and healthy. At this point, they can't afford the million doller packaging machines other use to reduce cost.  In addition, they are buying direct from a farmer so we pay more, get a superior product and support a multitude of USA families and businesses. I'll pay the premium!

review/text: Like many others, I first noticed Quinn Popcorn on Kickstarter. In fact, it was my first project that I supported.<br />I am on deployment and just recently got my popcorn in. I had been telling everyone how awesome it was going to be. So when I opened and popped my first bag, I went around sharing it with people, and I can honestly say, no one was disappointed. It was delicious. I have only had the Vermont Maple flavor so far, since it was so good and I know QP is in limited production. I decided it would be best for me to save the rest to share with my family when I get home. It is definitely giving me something to look forward to. A good movie and great popcorn!

review/summary: Best popcorn idea ever!
review/text: I think it takes something special to come up with a new concept such as this.  Yes, microwave popcorn is not new.  But microwave popcorn without all of the terrible chemicals and additives IS!  And, adding flavor profiles that you don't see anywhere else is also.  I have yet to try the lemon and sea salt (anxiously awaiting the availability of the next batch on amazon), but the maple and sea salt and the rosemary and parmesan are wonderful.  It does take some practice to get the cooking time just right in your own microwave, and to also distribute the seasoning evenly throughout the bag.  But I think the end result is well worth the effort.  And I'm happy to support a start up enterprise such as this one.  I hope they keep the popcorn coming!

I love popcorn, but hate how microwaveable popcorn is so full of chemicals and butter and salt. I just thought this was a great idea and they really had their ducks in a row. The popcorn is light a fluffy (Took me a few times to get the timing right. I know every microwave can be different) the flavors are subtle. it never ends up soggy or caked in flavoring like other microwave popcorns. I will definitely be buying copious amount of this when it becomes available.

I burned my first batch, so listen carefully to the popping when making your first bag to get your timing right.  My microwave cooks it in just under 2 minutes, but yours could take 3 minutes.  The oil and flavoring packets are shaken into the bag after you finish popping the corn.

review/text: Like other reviews have mentioned, the popcorn burns really easily!  You have to stop the microwave when the popcorn is barely half done if you want to avoid burning.  Even when I stop the popping early, the popcorn has this weird burnt flavor that doesn't mesh well with the flavoring packets at all.<br /><br />I was also a bit disappointed in the calorie count on this.  If I airpopped this much popcorn myself and just added some seasonings, it would be 1/3 of the calories.<br /><br />Hopefully the makers can improve the flavor because they have great concepts!

review/text: I purchased this for two relatives for their birthdays and my family with the thought that it would be a perfect gift for hard to buy people.  I am embarrassed to have paid so much for such a mediocre product. The flavorings were separate from the popcorn and added after it was popped. Flavorings were bland and not identifiable to the taste expected. It's a novel idea, but would I buy it again? NO. In my humble opinion, the packaging was the most impressive part of this popcorn.

review/summary: Excellent Taste, Concept and Quality
review/text: I have been searching high and low for a vegan/vegetarian, organic microwave popcorn.  I've tried Newman's Own, but it has butter.  Other varieties were unsalted or also had butter.  Nothing inbetween.  I saw Quinn's on Amazon so I decided to try it, although it seems pretty pricy.  It is phenomenal!  The flavors are fabulous (although the Lemon is my least favorite).  They have paid special attention to not only make sure that the ingredients are non-GMO and use organic popcorn, but the packaging is also chemical-free so no nasty things from the bag leach into your popcorn.  My only complaint is that it doesn't pop super well in my microwave and doesn't make more than one serving per bag.  I would like to see this product more commercially available and perhaps in larger servings.  Keep up the good work, Quinn!  You're onto something.

review/text: We LOVE Quinn Popcorn!! We saw it on Chronicle and knew we had to try it. It was already sold out here on Amazon but I found it at Whole Foods the next day. We tried it a couple days later - my parents were in town - and we all loved it. My Dad ordered some from Amazon right away, and seeing that it was available, we ordered more on Amazon too.<br /><br />The flavors are amazing in taste and simple in concept. Honest ingredients you can feel good about. Plus it's always good to support a local company! It obviously takes a little more effort to make than the typical microwave popcorn since you have to add the oil and flavor, and watch out for your cooking time (I burned a bag at work; the micro there must be more powerful than ours at home - where our cook time is 2:21 by the way), but it is SOOO worth it!! I highly recommend giving this worthy product a try!

review/text: I supported these guys on Kickstarter, and now I'm hooked on this popcorn. Well, it's actually the flavors I'm hooked on! I have a small microwave and I'll admit to having a hard time getting the popcorn to cook just right. But I'm not a regular microwave user. I think if you spend the time to get to know your microwave you'll probably be fine. Best tasting microwave popcorn ever because it doesn't have any disgusting chemicals. Just pure ingredients. All 3 flavor choices are awesome and I disagree with the reviewer who said they are too salty! I found all of the flavors to be very subtle actually - just right, as long as you distribute them well, which for me means sprinkling them on and tossing them in the bowl not in the bag. I'll admit that they are more expensive than I feel I can really justify for popcorn, so I'm really hoping that someday they offer a cheaper box with just the flavor packets in it that I can just add to my own air-popped popcorn. All I know is that now my old butter and salt combo seems very boring as a popcorn topper. I crave lemon, rosemary, & maple!

review/summary: Great concept, poor outcome
review/text: My sister purchased this product, and was kind enough to share two flavors with me, the Lemon Sea Salt and the Rosemary Parmesan. With the Lemon, I followed the instructions to the T. I popped the corn, I poured the oil in the bag, I shook it furiously, and then sprinkled the seasoning in, shook it furiously again, and then ate it. Like my sister, who had the same experience, some kernels were devoid of flavoring, while others, that caught most the oil, were overwhelmingly seasoned, to the point of being distasteful.  So...the next bag, I decided to experiment. I made a small opening in the bag prior to popping, added the oil packet, popped the corn, poured into a bowl, and sprinkled on the seasoning a little at a time as I ate the bowl. That was absolutely delicious, however...that being said, I used about 1/6th of the amount of seasoning provided in the bag. It is an intense amount of seasoning, and if used as instructed, I would find it overwhelming.  I'm happy to try healthful alternatives to microwave popcorn, ones that use organic products, good quality corn, and interesting seasonings, but this method left me feeling it had not yet been figured out just right.

review/text: This is a great concept. I read a good review of it in the New York Times, and I was impressed w/ the idea of a compostable bag and no chemicals. Sadly: the seasoning is SO salty, I found it inedible even using only half a bag of seasoning. Yes, you can use even less seasoning, and it's OK, but you get about 2 cups of popcorn for your $2.50 bag, which is outrageous. Since you're adding your own oil and seasoning with this product anyway, why not just throw 25 cents worth of popcorn in to a pan, cook it yourself and save a LOT of money? Don't waste your money on this.

It looks nothing like what is pictured, but if you look closely, you'll notice the picture has full-sized bottles of spice behind it showing that the jar pictured is really a tiny vial. In reality, mine came in a little plastic box (see my uploaded image). Three stars are given for the taste of the spice (quite nice) and the timely service of Marshalls Creek.

review/summary: A LITTLE BIT of HEAVEN in a JAR
review/text: This Marmalade is without a doubt the best tasting  marmalade I have ever had. Better than all the other brands that I have tried. Allthough the Dundee Orange Marmalade is outstanding, I think the Dundee 3-Fruit Marmalade has a slight edge over it.  It has a complicated citrus flavor. You can actually taste the 3 fruit's, since there are lots of pieces of rind from each in there. What an outstanding blend of flavors. This Marmalade is extremely thick, almost as though it was concentrated. It has a somewhat strong bitter sweet flavor. A little dab will go a long way.<br /><br /> This is not for everyone, if you like the sweet non bitter marmalade you might not like it. My wife does not care for it, and I think it's fantastic. Go figure.<br /><br />This brand should not be to hard to find locally, My local Publix Supermarket carries it for $7 a jar.<br /><br />UPDATE ::: July 2010; Unfortunately my local market does not carry the 3-fruit any longer only the orange. To my surprise the jar is now clear glass when I bought one the other day. What a shame I loved those white jars.

review/summary: The Cadillac of Marmalades
review/text: After hunting for this brand and variety of marmalade for many years after having taken it for granted throughout childhood, I had given up hope of enjoying a decent marmalade on my toast and English muffins. I'd even given up marmalade altogether, as the regular brands at the supermarket were so inferior that it was nearly punitive to even use them. One day the thought occurred to me to try finding Dundee's on Amazon, and voila! Ambrosia in that traditional white milk glass jar! Only Rose's Tangerine marmalade comes close, and it's just not to be found. But the 3 fruit variety is still here and thank heavens, so is the very adult and refined flavor of Dundee's classic marmalade! Bon Appetite!

review/summary: The Best!
review/text: This marmalade IS the best. It should be around $6 per jar. I know. It's $3.95 at a local store in SoCal. I have 32 empty jars that I use to store sugar in. Just use one jar at a time for your sugar - to go along with your cup of tea, toast and marmalade. If the shipping is included it's a better deal.

review/summary: Dundee - Three fruit marmalade
review/text: I was so happy to find this product  on your site.  My local market doesn't carry the three fruit marmalade.  I first purchased it in Florida, and  once you try it, you will want  it all the time to replace the regular marmalade.  A product of Scotland.

review/summary: Good Product
review/text: Unbelievable how few products, even as simple as tomato sauce, have numerous additives included (free of charge).  I chose this one because it's minimally processed and nothing much beside tomatoes.  Tastes fine as well.

review/summary: Top of the line
review/text: Delicate, sweet and flavorsome ,the Muir Glen products are in a class of their own.Although priced on the high end compared with the supercenters(I suspect because of the shipping weight)these are well worth the cost  for the health benefits alone.Hats off to Amazon for making them available online.(request a subscribe & save program)

review/summary: perfect for everything
review/text: These tomatoes are perfect for everything. I use them for pasta salads, soup base, pasta sauces, and the list goes on and on. You can put them on top of toasted bread for bruschetta if you want. I have tossed them in scrambled eggs and thrown cheese on top for a quick and yummy omelet. Highly recommend these tomatoes. They are diced and seasoned perfectly. Use subscribe and save for the best deal.
