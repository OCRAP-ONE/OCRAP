review/summary: Unique and delicious
review/text: I searched hard and as far as I know no one else makes a candy like this.  chocolate candy with real liquid expresso filling.  I first tasted this pocket coffee in Europe in 2005 and was very happy to have discovered it on-line.  Almost gives the same lift as a shot of espresso and is a very tasty dessert.  Don't confuse it with the "Pocket Coffee To-Go" from the same source.  Also tasty but that is a pure liquid in a plastic cup.  Appears like that is the summertime replacement when it is probably too hard to ship a liquid filled chocolate.

review/summary: Italian Pocket Coffee-Benissimo
review/text: I lived in Italy for 5 years and became addicted to this espresso confection.  The problem is, you can only get it in the winter months, and it has been hard to find stateside.<br />As I found via Amazon, I felt it would be a good deal.  Truth be told, the day after I ordered, I found twice the quantity on Ebay for only $15.00 more directly from a Ebay store in Germany.  I bet you can guess where I will be buying from next year!  If you love Pocket Coffee, check out Ebay 1st.

review/summary: WARNING***COCA LEAF TEA WILL SHOW POSITIVE FOR COCAINE IN DRUG TEST***
review/text: My boyfriend just got fired from his job b/c he was required to do a drug test and it showed positive for cocaine.  He does not do cocaine.  The day of the test he did happen to have 2 cups of Delisse Mate De Coco and he didn't think anything about it.  It's actually sold in the US and being sold on sites like Amazon.com b/c these distributors are outside of the U.S., people have brought it back through customs with no issues (his mom brought it from Ecuador) and he has found scientific journals supporting that the coca leaf or the coca leaf teas that are sold or brought into the US are actually listed as "illegal" by the US Government.  Here is the link to the US Department of Justice CLEARLY stating that "coca leaf" is a schedule II substance and illegal.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />DO NOT DRINK THIS TEA IF YOU ARE AT RISK FOR A DRUG TEST OR GETTING RANDOM DRUG TESTED AT WORK.  I've also seen reviews on other coca leaf teas where people have given warnings about losing a job opportunity.<br /><br />If you did get fired, it's really hard to fight b/c most will just see a positive drug test for cocaine. The only other ways to test positive for cocaine metabolites is if you actually did cocaine or have a major disease such as Kidney or Liver Disease.  If you never drank coca leaf, then I would suggest you go to a doctor to make sure you don't have liver or kidney disease.  It would really suck to get fired for having a disease and having a disease that created cocaine metabolites would be something you could really fight legally, in my opinion, b/c at that point it's wrongful termination.  In Texas if you get fired for a drug test even if you had no previous disciplinary action you can not receive unemployment.  He's even spoken to an Employment Lawyer and they said it'll be hard for him to fight in court.<br />If you or anyone has questions on this, we both have been researching things and can direct you to some advice, discussion or articles on this matter, please feel free to email me at:  MusicRocksInAustin@gmail.com.

review/text: Bitters go in and out of style.  They are only called for in a few drinks (or food dishes) but are just imperative for an Old Fashioned or Manhattan.  Bitters are certainly a matter of taste, but this brand is considered by many to be the gold standard.<br /><br />The House of Angostura has a long and storied history, and a shortage of bottles a few years ago put their product in short supply, probably worsened by hoarding.  Angostura is back, with its famous oversized labels, but it is absent from most local shelves, so Amazon is a reliable source.<br /><br />A bottle this size will last me a lifetime, and I just might mention it in my will.

review/text: My wife is on this soy kick where soy can do no wrong and milk is all wrong ("cow milk is for calves, not humans"). Of all the soy drinks that she's brought home I like Vitasoy the best.  I'm not much for unsweetened soy milk, and this is the least sugary of them and has a mild taste. Best of all, these come in serving sized containers that need no refrigeration. It even has a straw taped to the side. A great alternative to sugary drinks and soda if you don't want your kids drinking those things.<br /><br />Now if my wife can only explain why if cow milk is unnatural for humans, what's natural about harvesting soy beans from a field, grinding them into paste and making a drink out of it? I guess to her the most natural drink would be to bottle up human milk and have that with your cornflakes but I think I'll take a pass on that...

review/text: Rest assured, this tea has a natural tasting pear flavor.  Although this tea does included real pear pieces, they also use a pear flavoring to amplify the taste (apparently brewing pear pieces doesn't kick it up quite enough.)

review/text: Revolution's White Pear Tea is my most often repeat/requested tea by guests. People just love it, with or without half & half. The pear flavor is pleasantly accurate- natural taste. Very appealing! But when adding this tea to your collection, don't forget Teaosophy's Black Kerala (an absolute 5 star black), Teaosophy's Darjeeling Green and/or Two Leaves and A Bud's Tamayokucha Green. Finish it with a good quality monkey picked oolong and you will have the best of the beloved Camellia sinensis plant!

review/summary: This Tea is Lovely
review/text: I'm a fan!  This tea is not bitter, and forgives a wide range of temps and steep times.  In fact, my favorite way to drink it is to throw a bag into room-temperature water to flavor the water.  This works well through 3-4 refills, by which time I tend to forget and leave the room.  Steeping for hours does finally bring the bitterness out, so that's when I toss it.<br /><br />The "green" flavor of the tea is much stronger than most white teas.  It reminds me of a white and green 'fusion' tea by Stash, though I prefer this Revolution tea.  The pear flavor is delicious, tastes like real pear, and matches the strength of the strong white tea (that sounds funny as I type it - strong white tea?!) well.  If you like green AND white tea, and you like pears, give this a shot.  I'm really very fond of it.<br /><br />The package comes with a "resealable freshness bag," though I've never felt the need for one before and I'm not sure I need one now.  It doesn't get in the way, and it's there if I want to travel without risking leaking tea dust . . . not that there is any tea dust.  The tea leaves are as large as loose leaf tea, which might be why it holds up through more steeps than anything else I have in a teabag, and they're very green.  I suspect it still has more moisture in the leaves than most teas, but since I'm reluctant to rip a bag open to perform tests, that will remain a suspicion.<br /><br />There's no string on the teabags, and they're the fancy pyramid type.  They feel very nice.  This is a distant concern compared to the flavor (which, as I mentioned, I am very fond of), but it's worth a mention.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: After I tasted a bottle of Ocean Spray Cranbery product that was labeled "100% juice' in big letters and the word "cranberry" underneath I realized that it was way too sweet to be 100% cranberry juice.  When I finally looked at the tiny dark red strip at the bottom of the label, I found that it was combined with grape, apple, and other juices.  I called the 1-800 customer info line and asked if I could order the 100% cranberry juice from the website, the customer service representative told me that Ocean Spray doesn't make that product.  When I asked for the percentage of cranberry juicr in the product, she said that she did not have that information.  When I asked where I could find out, she said she didn't know.  Truth in advertising?  Their commercials show funny men standing in cranberry bogs.  Give me a break.  And if you are needing the cranberry juice for your health, be VERY careful.

Undrinkably tart, but perfect for making my own less-than-sweet blends and thirst-aides using fresh berries and fruits with water, and for extending store-shelf juices too sweet for me. 100% C.J. is not a consumer product, but for food & beverage product makers.<br /><br />Cranberry Juice Concentrate is also very handy & 100% CJ.

review/summary: Buy These For The Cats
review/text: I don't want to give away any secrets but I buy these treats for my 3 cats.  They are all addicted to them and ask for them after dinner.<br /><br />The dog treats are the same as the cat treats but at a cheaper price.  I was worried that they would be huge or something since they are sold for dogs, but not so.<br /><br />I give each cat about 6-7 treats per night.  The only ingredient is SALMON.  How much healthier can you get?!  My cats' coats are extremely soft and silky, and my vet recently commented that she thought it must be the treats!<br /><br />If you are looking for a healthy option when it comes to your animals instead of the supermarket trash that has un-pronounceable ingredients in it, GET THESE!

review/text: I used to buy these cheaply when I lived in WA State (they're made there) but these are cheaper than anyplace I saw there. Cat owners should just order the dog treats and split them up. These are a little large for most cats but if you break them down with a knife or box cutter they're every bit as good as the cat treats and much cheaper.

review/summary: I wish I still loved you.
review/text: I've been buying these mints since August 2010.  They were a subscribe and save item that we got twice a month. The mint taste was not always consistent, with some boxes very strong tasting and some with a mild mint taste, but we accepted that.<br /><br />However, the last box we got in July 2012 ended our two year relationship with Newman's Own Cinnamon mints. Here's the story: I opened the box, took a roll and handed a roll to my husband.  We each popped a mint in our mouths.  I few seconds later we looked at each other and both said "They taste like soap!" I don't know what happened in the manufacturing process, but that ended it for us.  Amazon was good enough to refund our money when I contacted them.  I cancelled our subscription and we're afraid to order any more.<br /><br />I'm rating this product 3 stars instead of one because we got a lot of boxes that were great. We just can't get past that last box.

review/text: I really enjoy all the flavors of Newman's Own Mints, and I thought I would try the rolls for a change.  Yes, the rolls are less expensive, but they do not have the same consistency or mouth feel as the mints of the same flavor that are sold in tins.  Also, the mints in tins do seem to last longer, so I wonder if these rolls (though convenient) are even a better bargain.  I would not purchase these again; rather, I will spring for a few extra dollars and continue to purchase the Newman's Own Mints in tins.

review/text: I recently (December '10) reordered these mints (I can't find them where I live, so I order them on a fairly regular basis) & it seems that something was missing in this batch.....the cinnamon flavor! So far, every roll has been nothing but sugar.....has anyone else had this 'problem'????<br /><br />  I first tried these a couple of months ago when I saw them at a Whole Foods store. I was instantly hooked! They are so good, I had to find a steady supply of them (I don't have a Whole Foods where I live) & was so glad Amazon.com had them. I have ordered them twice & they never last long-everyone that tries them loves them. I've tried the other mints that Newman's Own makes, but the Cinnamon mints are by far my favorite. I love the texture, the 'just-right' cinnamon flavor & the fact that I'm supporting a company that does so many good things.

I am trying to avoid any food products that have Aspartame or any other sugar free sweetener with the exception of Stevia, which my doctor has recommended we use as the alternative to all the others. So my Hat's off to you for your diligence and care; Thank you.<br /><br />I tried the hard candy, sour fruits, licorice, and lemon but was disappointed...I guess my sweet tooth craves something a bit sweeter! The sweets just weren't sweet enough for me! Everything arrived to my house in a short time of ordering; the packaging is good quality and well presented, I just didn't care for the candy.  I felt there could have been more flavour.<br /><br />Again, I commend you for providing this alternative to all of us who are trying to live a healthier life.<br /><br />Eugenie

review/summary: Cheesecake may spoil during delivery
review/text: I got a 6 month cheesecake order as a gift, and the first cheeesecake arrived packed in dry ice.  It was frozen and tasted great after a night in the fridge.<br /><br />The second cheesecake arrived spoiled.  They did not ensure rapid delivery of the cake and the dry ice melted while the cake was in transit.  When I called the company and asked for a replacement, they said that would be impossible, and that I would have to pick another product.  I asked to speak to a manager and the manager acted like it was my fault that the cake spoiled in transit, and said I was lucky that they were willing to give me anything.<br /><br />I've ordered other month clubs from other companies in the past, and never once had an item spoil prior to delivery.  And on the very rare occasion a product arrived damaged, other companies were very willing to make it up to me.  Amazing clubs made it very clear they had no interest in customer satisfaction.

review/summary: This is the best flavor of Zatarain's - universal pleaser.
review/text: I love all the flavors of Zatarain's.  I love to cook cajun style food and will make my own from scratch when I have the time.  Reality means I usually focus on cooking the main course and will use boxed shortcuts for side dishes.  Zatarain's really shine in this role.  You give up surprisingly little for a ready mix product.  The flavors are within shouting distance of the real deal.  Compared to most foods made from a mix that require less than 2 minutes of your attention - it's practically a miracle.<br /><br />The Jambalaya and the Black Beans & Rice are the best flavors.  The Jambalya is hot and spicy - so kids don't like it.  The black beans & rice is a little spicy too - but subtle.  Mainly it's zesty and hearty and delicious.  My children eat it.  My little son just devours it - and has since he was a tot.  My daughter less so.  Actually I think I love this stuff more than my wife - so maybe there's a gender thing going on.  It's a little greasy when made properly.  I recommend using 2 1/2 cups of water, instead of the 2 3/4 it recommends on the box - for thicker, less soupy rice.  The foil lined container is bug proof and keeps for a long time.  Because it's a big flavor it sits best next to something assertive - like steak or blackened anything.  It's a regular side for us on BBQ nights.

This works well with some salsa and cheese as a simple but hearty chip dip, and also as a good base for vegetarian tacos/fajitas.  If you haven't tried these before, you should be able to try a single box from your local supermarket, so you don't have to risk wasting most of a case if you don't like them.<br />It's very convenient (and very economical) to buy these by the case from Amazon - quick delivery with Subscribe & Save, no problems at all.<br /><br />Recommended!

review/summary: Good but salty
review/text: I have been using this product for 5+ years and have enjoyed it much.  I sometimes will mix in chopped hot dogs or sausage for variety.  Spicy sausage works well.  The main complaint I have is the amount of salt they put in the mix.  I can almost smell the salt!  Unfortunately they do not have the reduced sodium version where I live so I will try to order it online.  Overall, it's very flavorful but too salty.  It's much more flavorful than the similar Goya product.

review/summary: A Wonderful Surprise
review/text: In an era where companies are increasingly using every trick in the books to cut costs of their products, Zatarain's Black Beans and Rice surprised me by being an incredibly tasty dish with ALL RICE that could still be microwaved pretty easily.  I haven't yet tried to cook this rice dish on the stove, but although the microwave instructions require a bit of babysitting, stirring every few minutes, the end result is a slightly creamy rice and beans dish with a really great kick and aroma of cajun spices.  Unlike most of the rice (with pasta usually cut in) dishes on the market, you can really smell it cooking from a room away, and when you first open the foil package the mix is kept in to stay fresh, you get a blast of the spices as well.  You can tell at every stage that it's a high quality product, and it comes through in the end.  I highly recommend it for anyone looking for either a great meal or a rice side dish for dinner.

review/summary: Best cheapest camping food available!
review/text: Here is the skinny on using this as camping food: get some reflectix insulation and make a cozy for your pot with lid. bring pot to boil, dump this box of dried beans and rice in, stir and take off heat to put in cozy. Wait about half an hour and it is ready - saves on fuel because the simmer time is about 23 minutes over low flame.<br /><br />Everyone LOVES this stuff. At home or on the trail. Add a pouch of tuna while in the woods (and maybe some dried hot peppers - pepin in the mexican section) and eat it with flour tortillas and I personally promise HEAVEN in your mouth!

review/summary: A New Favorite!
review/text: I love Matcha and I love licorice, so this flavored Matcha should be a no-brainer, right?  But to be honest, not all licorice flavors are done right, and it's one of those flavors that if it's not right, it can be just WRONG.<br /><br />Fortunately, Red Leaf Tea did licorice RIGHT!  This is a strong, crisp, zesty licorice flavor.  It's really an exhilarating flavor.  As I sip it, the aftertaste reminds me very much of Altoid's Liquorice which is the strongest licorice flavored thing I've ever tasted.  This nearly rivals the Altoids in strength ... but this is even better because of the Matcha.  The Matcha offers its creamy consistency and slightly buttery, sweet vegetative tones to the sip, which softens the sharper notes of the licorice in a very appealing way, creating a flavor that reminds me of black Jelly Bellys ... as if someone took black Jelly Bellys and liquified them and stirred them into a bowl of Matcha.<br /><br />It is so good.  If you like black licorice, you should try this.  If you are a black licorice fiend like I am - you've GOT to try this ... this may just be my new favorite source of black licorice flavor, not to mention my new favorite flavored Matcha!

review/summary: Licorice? I barely know orice!
review/text: I have such a love/hate relationship with licorice, and I had to try this one, I just had to. Licorice in tea is one of my favorite things of all time, and the Licorice Mint tea from Red Leaf Tea is a must for me when I'm sick. And while I love allsorts, any other licorice candy is not for me. I just think it's vile. Every Easter my mother would gleefully sit by as I sorted out all of the black jelly beans from my basket. She was the only one in the family who liked them. Is there anything more gross than popping what you think is a purple jellybean into your mouth, only to discover it was a horrible, horrible, licorice one? Blegh! But allsorts....mmm. They've become a bit of tradition in our family. They're impossible to find in Tennessee, so when I'm sending a package to my folks I always include Coffee Crisp for my mom and allsorts for my dad. That is, if I can keep myself from eating them all before the package goes out! Trust me, it happens more often than I care to admit.<br /><br />I kept eyeing this tea, adding it to my shopping cart and then removing it in favor of another flavor of matcha, adding it back to my wishlist. I finally bit the bullet and I'm here to find out if this is an allsort or a black jellybean.<br /><br />It's not a black jellybean at all! It is a lovely sweet licorice that soothes the throat and makes me unbelievably happy. I was very scared of this blend, but those fears were unfounded. It is delicious and definitely one I need to keep around for when I'm sick but I have to deal with work anyway. Completely lovely. It's not really an allsort either, it's the licorice I've come to know and love in teas. I should have expected that, but I was scared by the picture on the website.<br /><br />Licorice tends to polarize people. You either love it or you hate it. I'm one of those who loves it, but my wife is one who hates it. If it's in a tea, she can taste it, and it bothers her. But for me...oh, I love it and this matcha is beautiful in the balance of flavor to matcha. I want to make a large mug of this, but I have other matchas to taste and review!

review/text: I came across Canidae when we adopted a 3 week puppy whose mother had transitioned.  We didn't know how to care for him properly so we went to the local pet store and they said Canidae was the food to use and to use it throughout his life.  We simply wet the food for the first few weeks before going completely dry and he has loved it throughout.  We also feed it to our 65 pound Goldendoodle and he loves it as well.  Definitely a great find.

In my haste, I purchased this thinking it was a the 15lb version of the Chicken and Rice formula. Woops! So I went and bought the 15lb bag of Chicken and Rice and mix the Beef and Fish in so it didn't wreak havoc on my pup's digestive system.<br /><br />I can say that after we started feeding this to my pup, she starting having stinky farts and had never had them before. Also, Roshan's right about the fish breath! Ick.<br /><br />Overall, my dog has no issues with this formula, it's just stinky so I'll stick to Chicken and Rice after this bag is done.

review/text: I am surprised at  a lot of the negative comments on Canidae. I have a 2 year old German Shepherd who is a picky eater and has sensitive skin.  I tired 4 other brands of food: Innova, Natural Balance, Taste of the Wild and Evo....all of which she scratches and bites herself constant.  With Canidae, she has a beautiful shinny coat, doesn't itch and she loves it!  It's amazing the difference.  Her stools sometimes are loose, but nothing to complain about or worry.  I'm not putting down those other foods, I'm just saying that this Canidae food has down wonders for her!  I've gotten wuite a few comments on her shinny coat.  Every dog is different and you just need to find a perfect dog food like I did for her.  We use the Chicken version on her.  If you on dog food analysis, you will notice it has a 5 star rating.  Jetta and I are both very happy with Candiae!!

review/summary: don't buy this stuff
review/text: I have used this dog food for years.  About a year ago they reduced the size of the bag and increased the price.  I continued to buy it.  No one told me there was any change in formula.  My elderly dog started getting hot spots and vomiting yellow stuff. I thought it was just an upset tummy. The vet treated her with antacids and cortizone creams. My poor dog has been through a lousy time.  She was drinking massive amounts of water. I had her kindeys and blood sugar checked.  She was ok there.  Last month, I changed her to California Naturals because it costs less and I can get it at a cheaper store. She has stopped vomiting and doesn't drink as much water.  I didn't even think about it, until I was reading the reviews online and saw the same symptoms in other people's dogs.  I will not go back to Canadae.  Keep away from this crappy dog food.  If your dog is the least bit sensitive, it will create toxic effects for your dog. It is poisonious to those dogs with allergies.

Then suddenly around December she started vomiting and having loose yellow stools, and became very lethargic.

It turns out, they recently changed their formula, changed manufacturers, and decreased the amount of food in their package.  Do some research, it's not the same high-quality food it used to be!

review/summary: After feeding for 5 years, we're done
review/text: We fed Canidae to our two dogs for almost 5 years--they always ate it eagerly, never had stomach upset, and got raves from the vet for their muscle, weight, and coats.  It *was* a 5-star food.  But last summer we opened a fresh bag of kibble (same exact packaging bought from our usual store) and immediately noticed it was much lighter in color than previous bags, but we fed it anyway. Within a day our Aussie, who has a bulletproof stomach with absolutely no digestive issues, began to have horrible gas, softer stools, and really loud, liquidy gurgling noises in his abdomen.  We continued to feed the entire bag, thinking that he'd adjust to it eventually because our other dog was fine.  Well, our Aussie never did adjust to it; he spent a month having those symptoms, and we dreaded mealtimes because of the stench and sounds he'd create.<br /><br />The kibble in the next bag we bought was the old normal shade of brown, and our Aussie's stomach noises, soft stools, and awful gas went away practically overnight. But by then I was hearing and reading that Canidae had developed a new formula that was making dogs sick. The stories about people whose dogs got *far* sicker than ours, and the dodgy responses that those long-time customers got from Canidae when they called to complain about the unannounced change, made us decide it was time for a new dog food.  We went with Healthwise, a premium kibble made by the same company that makes Innova, California Natural, and Evo.  It's not worth it to continue to be loyal to Canidae and to risk our dogs perhaps getting as sick as many others have.  Read Canidae's new formula horror stories at consumeraffairs.com.

review/summary: Another bad reaction. Why risk it?
review/text: We adopted Penelope, a 6 mo. old min pin hound mix, a couple weeks ago. We decided to switch her from Purina Pro Plan w/ Shredded Chicken to a premium food. After reading many conflicting reviews on this site and elsewhere, we decided to try Canidae. My sister feeds Canidae with great results and, at our local pet store, it is the cheapest of the premium foods by a narrow margin.<br /><br />We mixed only a little Canidae into Penny's kibble. My guess is about 6-8 pieces or 1/12 of her total breakfast/dinner. We watched her very closely. Within a day, we noticed some changes. First of all, she lost a little focus in training, seeming a bit more confused than usual. No biggie. She also sneezed a few times (she has never sneezed before). More importantly, though, we noticed that she started to nibble and chew on her feet. This continued sporadically for another day and half. It wasn't constant or serious. She didn't seem agitated and she didn't bite her feet to the point of redness or bleeding. Still, it was VERY clear that this was caused by the change in diet (nothing else in her routine changed) and this was only with 12-16 pieces of Canidae per day. Having read the reviews of Canidae's new formula, we had known that this might happen. We made the decision to switch right away.<br /><br />After a lot of research, we decided to try Solid Gold Hund-N-Flocken for Puppies. We mixed in the Solid Gold at the same proportions as the Canidae. The nibbling stopped immediately. No sneezing, either. Her focus seems to have improved as well, though I can't completely credit that to the food because puppies have on and off days. Still, it is clear that the more serious allergy problems have been resolved.<br /><br />If you've done any research on dog foods at all, you already know that finding the right food requires you to go beyond the ingredient list. Some foods just don't work with some dogs, however good they look on paper. Indeed, I am convinced after many hours of reading reviews that NO food works for ALL dogs. That said, it is clear that many, many more people have had problems with the new Canidae formula than they have with other premium or super-premium brands. Who knows why (Canidae claims the new formula has no changes that could account for allergies), and who cares? Feel free to try Canidae for your dog, but watch him or her very closely. Or, better yet, do what I wish I did, and just start with a different brand. There is nothing special about the Canidae ingredients list, so why risk it?

review/summary: Very impressed
review/text: Although I have not bought canidae through Amazon (there is a local store near me that carries the life all stages 40LB bag for $35) I just wanted to write in and remark how impressed I am with this food.  I have an almost 2 year old chocalate lab.  When i got him from the breeder at 9 weeks he was on Eukanuba, which he stayed on with me at 1st.  After talking to a friend who breeds world class vizlas, she told me how she feeds them Canidae and how wonderful it is.  I switched over to Canidae then thank god and ever since.  My chocalate lab people actually think is a black lab.  He is the darkest chocolate lab u have ever seen, his coat is so beautiful and glossy, when he was on the eukanuba it was light brown and discolored.  Coats can be a huge problem with choc labs, but canidae has solved that problem.  With all the problems with menu foods that include so called good foods like eukanuba, science diet, iams, etc, it is a relief i can trust canidae and not be worried about all that.  Very impressed overall.....

review/summary: Lots of dogs getting sick from this product (including mine)
review/text: Be sure to do your homework re: this product before purchasing.  I have three dogs, and they were all getting sick once Canidae changed their "formula" late summer to early fall.  Once I googled the product and read the many complaints, all with dogs with the same symptoms, I immediately took my dogs off of the food, and they've been healthy again since.  I'll never trust this product again, and had been a loyal customer for 3+ years.

review/summary: Beware the new formula!!!!
review/text: I have been an avid Canidae supporter for about a year and a half.  My breeder recommended it and I was VERY impressed with how my dog responded.  However, a few months back they changed their formula, (they also lessened the bags from 40 to 35lbs AND raised the price!!!!) and it is terrible!!!!  I went through 2 bags and couldn't understand why my dog was consistently producing loose stools, when she never had before.  Randomly, I found 1 bag of the old formula left at my local dealer so I bought it.  Immediately her stools firmed up.  Now I am again on a bag of the new formula, and again my dog is sick.  I am done, I will no longer support Canidae.  Do not buy it!  Do your research, at this kind of money there are A LOT of better dog foods out there.

review/summary: New formula nothing like old!
review/text: We switched to Canidae ALS after the tainted food scare.  We were very happy with our choice and I recommended this food to many people.  Then they changed the formula.  They made this major change without so much as a sticker slapped on the bag notifying their customers.  The change sent my dog into a tail spin.  Severe vomiting, diarrhea, hot spots and itching were the main symptoms.  And since she had always done so well in Canidae, I never dreamed it was the food.  After weeks of worry and meds and messes to clean plus prednisone for the scary hot spot (my vet shrieked when she saw it!) I started researching and a food change was the only thing that stopped the problems.  She lost 5 lbs. in a very short amount of time.  Canidae's customer service rep. blamed me for not transitioning properly!  Talk about adding insult to injury!  Not a good food for us and not a good company to deal with.  Wish I could give ZERO stars.

review/summary: Used once and switched
review/text: I have a new Akita puppy, and bought the Canidae ALS for him since I couldn't get the breeders type of food in my area. After transitioning him to the Canidae, his stools were loose and yellow. I looked on-line, and saw that Canidae switched their formula, and my puppy's symptoms were mild compared to some I read about. I immediately switched my puppy to Wellness Puppy, and everything has been coming out fine since.

review/summary: Corn isn't dog food.
review/text: Canidae has been excellent for my dogs. My Siberian can be picky at times but they all seem to like Canidae. The company was open and informative with me.(1.800.398.1600) I'll not be feeding my dogs ANYTHING that comes out of China unless we go flat broke. Many foods(pet & people) say "Made in America" but most of the ingredients are from foreign countries and the food is only pressed together and packaged here. I consider this dishonest and immoral. It's also obviously legal thanks to federal policy that favors 'Free-trade/profit' over the health of American children, much less their pets. A premium food, sans fillers and trash, really is no more expensive since you feed less of it. Your dog will be healthier. Call this company and other companies and ask about their ingredients. Science diet and Purina will, for good reason, be way more evasive than Canidae.

review/summary: Great food - huge price increase...
review/text: This is a great grain free, alternate protein dog food.  We've been using it for years for a pup that seems to have every food allergy under the sun, and he's thrived on it.<br /><br />In one month (Aug-September, however, the price jumped from $59.99 to over $78.00 (for you non-math people that's a 30% increase).<br /><br />This bag was the anchor of my monthly Amazon order, but now that the price has made it un-economical to buy through Amazon, I will parcel out my orders to have a more economical result.

review/summary: Dog didn't like the taste
review/text: Started out OK, but after a few weeks my dog decided she didn't like the taste all that much, became picky and wouldn't finish her feedings. I ended up discarding a half-bag and switching to Wellness brand Puppy mix. Canidae does produce very dense, dark stools so if you have to pick up poop this makes it easy. With a 1-acre fenced yard I don't bother.
