review/summary: Excellent for Cleansing and Less Frequent Urination Feeling...
review/text: I live in the Southern CA area in San Diego.  We have had a lot of chemtrail activity in our area and one of the health issues that a lot of people are having are kidney and bladder related inflammations.  It is due to the heavy metals in the air that are being transmitted into our foods.  They have increased the fluoridation of water also, so this is adding to the problem.<br /><br />I drink a lot of caffeinated teas, so make more frequent trips to the bathroom than most people.  This tea really helps cleanse your system where you are not feeling that bloated feeling like you need to run to the bathroom as much. Within the first day or two of drinking this tea, I could tell a difference.<br /><br />I was able to sleep over 5 hours after drinking this tea and clearing my bladder, where as I was normally waking up 2-3 hours into sleeping and needing to go to the restroom again.  This makes a big difference!  I'm buying my 2nd box of this tea now!<br />Great stuff.  Try it... I don't think that you will regret it!<br /><br />I wish I had found this a few years earlier!

review/summary: Common ingredients do not merit price
review/text: I noted that it was very expensive for tea, but the reviews made me give it a try.  When it arrived, the ingredients list is nothing but common herbs recommended in books and readily available in any decent size bulk herb store.  Bell did not even put the tea in tea bags.  So I really fail to understand the expensive price.  I probably will not pay for this product again, but rather mix my own.<br /><br />Cranberry<br />Goldenrod<br />Marshmallow<br />Nettle<br />Parsley<br />Rosehips<br />Uva Ursi<br />Willow herb<br />Natural citrus flavor

review/summary: Yum! Dark chocolate is my favorite...
review/text: My family has been enjoying Bug Bites organic chocolates for years. I highly recommend both the milk chocolate and the dark chocolate varieties. They are very smooth and rich, and not the least bit "waxy" tasting like some of the more popular American chocolates. Each individually packaged bite is the perfect size for an adult and maybe a little more than a mouthful for a young child. Each tiny package contains a special treat- a tiny insect card which features a color photograph and interesting facts. If you have a budding entomologist on your hands, these are the perfect treat! The Endangered Species company is environmentally conscious too, and dedicates 10% of their net profit to support species and habitat preservation.

review/summary: The most aromatic Garam masala
review/text: Badshah Punjabi Garam Masala.<br />Garam Masala is a quintessential ingredient in various dishes of Indian Cuisine.  It is a powdered mixture of whole spices that is used to elevate the taste and aroma of a dish.  It can be quite strong so a little bit goes a long way.  I have used several different brands and types of Garam Masalas and this one is by far my favorite. It's not hot and the aroma is amazing.<br />The ingredients mentioned on the box are as follows: Coriander, Black pepper, Cumin, Tejpatta, Clove, Green cardamom, Black cardamom, Cassia, Anistar, Dry Ginger, Nutmeg, Mace, and Caraway<br />Unfortunately, I couldn't find it in any Indian store around and was delighted to find it at amazon. I actually like it so much that I don't mind paying for the shipping and Ive stocked up in my pantry.  It arrived well packaged and wasn't old stock. I will definitely order again when I run out of these.

review/summary: Kahve Koffee's Cordoba Blend is the reason I get up in the morning
review/text: Since I switched to Kahve Koffee's brand of gourmet coffees, I now have a reason to look forward to waking up in the morning.  Like a faithful alarm clock, the thought of getting up to make my coffee beckons me. I can't wait to grind the beans and start my morning brew. The taste and full body of this coffee is superb. It is rich, dark and flavorful but never bitter. I have never had a better more consistent cup of coffee. It is no wonder it is served in Boston's finest restaurants! Very reasonably priced for the high quality you get. I also tried and loved the Sumatran Viennese, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NYX2M8">Kahv&eacute; Sumatran Viennese Coffee</a>  Barcelona Blend  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NZ37CW">Kahv&eacute; Barcelona Blend Coffee</a>  Italian Roast <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NYZ61S">Kahv&eacute; Italian Roast Coffee</a> Espresso Napoli <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NYX2RI">Kahv&eacute; Espresso Napoli Coffee</a> and several of their decafs, most notably the Decaf Danish  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NYZ8UC">Kahv&eacute; Decaf Danish Blend Coffee</a>.  I could not tell the difference between their decaf and a regular cup of coffee which is very hard to find.  Just excellent coffee! Can't wait to try some of their other blends and single origins. I happen to personally favor darker roasts, but their lighter blends are just as flavorful and rich- I just add more of it to suit my taste.  Now that I have been drinking Kahve's coffees, I am hooked for life!

review/summary: Great gluten-free egg-free bread
review/text: Look, if you are expecting "real" bread, or you are a recent change over to a gluten-free diet you will not like this bread. None of the gluten-free "breads" taste much like bread, and this is no exception. And, the lack of eggs will make this bread a little crumbly. This is a reality of all breads like this. You have to understand what you are buying. BUT, if you are looking for something to toast for a quick snack, or to use for a sandwhich this is the best gluten-free bread out there. The bread works best if you lightly toast it first and eat it warm. It also works especially well if you cook it with hot toppings. And, if you have a child who just wants to eat a sandwhich like all other kids at school, then this fits the bill. But, bread it ain't. If you are an adult who is new to gluten-free, it will likely taste like school paste. It all is in what you are expecting. But, in my experience, this is the best you can expect for a gluten-free, egg free, oat-free, bread.

review/text: Texture & taste was really good for a GF bread. I would give it the highest rating if not for it's shape. The slices were small & somewhat mushroomy in their shape. Looks like the bread did not rise properly before being baked so that sides collapsed . The odd shape made it impossible to make normal sandwiches or to use them in sandwich maker. My kids did not like deli meat hanging as dogs tongue on sides of their sandwiches. I would not write here if not for all 6 packs were of same poor quality. It's my second unpleasant experience with Ener-G Foods product on Amazon. Their products at grocery stores seem of much higher quality for some reason. I doubt if I will order them again in bulk.

review/text: When my mother-in-law purchased "light" rice bread, I expected it to be even worse than the regular rice bread we had been tolerating.  However, I was in for a pleasent surprise!  This bread is much lighter than the very dense rice bread made by EnerG.  It still tastes better toasted, but my 4 year old will eat it straight out of the bag too.  I am enjoying it as well - and so much easier to use than my previously preferred brand, which had to be pulled apart with a knife after storing in the freezer.  I have used to make rice crumbs for meatloaf, as sandwiches, as garlic toast, as regular toast, and am hoping to try french toast soon - the first bread even worth attempting that one with!

I tried this as an egg sandwich the taste of the food I was eating was not strong enough to compensate for this breads flavor.  It worked well with a cheese burger.  I prefer the popcorn waffers with cream cheese and a lunch meat best.  The expiration of this bread is measured over 12 months out.  Might try again or just go to a speciality bakery  instead.  I recently discarded three loafs that had not expired so that I had the space instead.  Bread is not that important to eat when it tastes like this.  A bowel of rice works well enough.  SJR

It helps also to have a good disgestion if you add a little to your tea.

review/summary: Acai Lemonade is a good alternative to soft drinks (and other powdered beverage packets)
review/text: I received a free sample of this through an entity that sells products made by NOW Foods.  I was very hesitant to try it because most powdered based beverages are simply awful.  This particular flavor by NOW Foods is very drinkable and has a nice lemonade (more of a pink lemonade) taste.<br /><br />This product is sweetened with "Better Stevia" and lacks aspartame and acesulfame potassium, which are two additives that have been linked to cancer in rats.  Many flavored powdered beverages, including those bearing the Crystal Light, Wyler's and Hawaiian Punch names, have these additives.<br /><br />The directions note that the packet should be poured in a bottle and then shaken.  When you mix this in your water, it is a shade of pink. I didn't find that any of the powder floated to the bottom or lumped together.  It seemed to disperse evenly throughout the water and dissolve.<br /><br />The product has 15 calories and is loaded with vitamins.  It has 100% of you daily vitamin C, 25% of Vitamin A, 50% of Vitamin D, 50% of Vitamin E, 50% of Thiamin, 50% of Riboflavin, 25% of Niacin, 50% of B-6, 50% of Folate, 50% of Pantothenic Acid and 1670% of Vitamin B-12.<br /><br />You need to use a little caution when opening the packet.  Compared to other powdered beverages, I found this powder to be made easily airborne. At the present time, there are external providers selling this for a much lower price (iherb.com is one of them - if you want a discount, search the internet for codes or you can use my code LEK375) and many health food stores carry the product as well.<br /><br />As a powder-based beverage, this is a decently flavored product.  It seems to offer a lot of vitamins and has minimal calories.  I would recommend it.

review/summary: Perfect for giving water flavor without the Aspartame!
review/text: I am trying to avoid too much sugar, but aspartame makes me feel gross and well, it is gross!  This is sweetened with Stevia (a plant) and Xylitol (from fruit fiber).  I bought the Berry Tea flavor and I think it tastes good.  I think it is too strong/sweet mixed full strength, which is great for me, because one packet lasts longer :)  I put 1/2-1/3 packet in a 16.9 oz bottle of water when I know I need to drink water but would rather have a soda, lol.  I don't taste an aftertaste at all but it's too sweet mixed full strength.  Great option!

review/summary: This Has Become A Staple At Our House
review/text: So far, we have only tried the Acai Lemonade, Pomegranite and the Berry flavor, and I love these little, inexpensive packets that make a delicious and refreshing sugar free drink.  As a diabetic, it is hard to find foods and beverages that are not loaded with sugar or artificial sweetners.  These NOW sugar free drink sticks are small and portable, so I can take them with me into restaurants that have limited choices for people like me.  Just order water and add the packet!  They are also good for children because they are yummy and sugar free.  I feel good about giving this drink to my grandkids.<br /><br />One other reviewer stated that she didn't like the Berry Tea flavor, and everyone in our family agrees with her.  Don't waste your money on the Berry Tea, because it tastes artificial and watered down - no one around here likes it.  The Acai Lemonade if very good, though, and the Pomegranite is positively delicious!  My personal favorite is Pomegranite.  It is pretty, too, and festive looking for a luncheon gathering.  Four little packets will make 1/2 gallon for a group.<br /><br />I did find the powder to be a little difficult to dissolve, but it only takes a few minutes to stir most of it into a glass of water.  I always pour the water into the glass first and then add the powder - otherwise it makes a mess and the powder will never disolve if you pour the drink mix into your glass and add the water last.  It is important to add the powder to an already full glass of water.  I have never gotten ALL of the powder to dissolve and there is always a small bit of residue in the bottom of the glass.<br /><br />The flavor is delicious as long as you don't mix it with more than 16 oz of water.  I hope they will eventually offer this in half gallon size packets, like Kool Aid.  But as I said before, it only takes 4 packets to make a half gallon.<br /><br />This is one of the best finds I have made, and if they keep this level of quality and price, I will keep buying it.<br /><br />UPDATE - 5/25/11: We have now tried the Fruit Punch flavor and do not like it.  We all thought it was really watered down tasting, and had no special flavor that would motivate us to buy it again.  Pomegranite is still the most favorite variety at our house, with Lemonade coming in second.  I will continue to update this review as we get the opportunity to try other flavors.

review/summary: Berry Energy Tea is loaded with vitamins but has a bad flavor
review/text: I tried the Acai Lemonade powdered beverage by NOW Foods and really liked it. With confidence, I purchased this product and I have to say this product represents why I am always hesitant to try powdered drinks.  They usually taste awful.  This has a very poor flavor with an aftertaste that reminded me of a pink liquid medicine I had to drink as a kid.<br /><br />The directions note that the packet should be poured in a bottle and then shaken. When you mix this in your water, it is a deep pink. I didn't find that any of the powder floated to the bottom or lumped together. It seemed to disperse evenly throughout the water and dissolve whether used in a shaker or just poured in a glass and and stirred with a spoon.<br /><br />This product is sweetened with "Better Stevia" so it is healthier for you than other low calorie beverages.  A lot of diet beverages have aspartame and acesulfame potassium. Both have been linked to cancer in rats and both were deemed one of the top ten worst additives by the Center for Science in the Public Interest.<br /><br />The product has 15 calories and is loaded with vitamins. It has 100% of you daily vitamin C, 25% of Vitamin A, 50% of Vitamin D, 50% of Vitamin E, 50% of Thiamin, 50% of Riboflavin, 25% of Niacin, 50% of B-6, 50% of Folate, 50% of Pantothenic Acid and 8330% of Vitamin B-12.<br /><br />You need to use a little caution when opening the packet. I've found NOW's powdered beverages to be much more airborne than other powdered products.  Don't breathe it in or let it blow in your eyes.<br /><br />As a powder-based beverage produced by NOW Foods, I had high hopes.  Nutritionally, this is far superior to other diet based beverages because it seems to offer a lot of vitamins and has minimal calories.  The flavor is just awful so I cannot recommend this flavor.  Try the Acai Lemonade.

review/text: Cella's dark chocolate covered cherries are my husband's favorite candy.  It is difficult to find the dark chocolate in my hometown except at Christmas.  I was excited to find it at Amazon and ordered a box of 72 for Valentine's Day.  I was disappointed when we opend the box of candy to find more than half of the chocolates stuck to the divider trays, some smashed in on the top and leaking inside.  I'm sure it happened in shipping and I should have returned the candy. My husband wanted to go ahead and eat them. I might buy again, but would certainly return another damaged shipment.

When she opened them Xmas morning, we found the chocolates were so old, the liquid had dried out of them and the bottoms were sunken in - completely inedible.  Very disappointed.

I will post an update either way.<br /><br />6-5-12 update:  Never received a reply from mintexrx and never received a refund.  Noticed there are several fly-by-night companies that sell on amazon - they unload shoddy goods and disappear to later reappear under another name.  There are too many of these type companies selling on Amazon of late, to the point where I think I will have to stop purchasing from resellers as I am getting mighty tired of being the victim of flim-flam.

review/summary: Calling it just ketchup is a disservice
review/text: I finally ordered some after debating for awhile, I mean it's just ketchup right? How far from reality that was. The spicy is now my go to condiment for everything, it is so much more than just ketchup. I would never put ketchup on a regular sandwich before, but I put the spicy on them now. I actually wouldn't usually put ketchup on a burger I would use bbq sauce instead, now I use Sir Kensington's Spicy Ketchup on them. I've found I use the spicy whenever I'm putting it on something or in something. The classic to me seems better with fries, tots, dipping things like that. I've honestly hardly touched the jar of classic while the spicy jar is almost gone. I like spicy things and so it isn't really very spicy at all to me, but the flavor of it is just awesome. If I had known this is what ketchup was supposed to taste like, I would have ordered it a long time ago.

review/text: I actually bought my first jar at William Sonoma for more than amazon sells it for.  The spiced version gives a pop to many foods and jazzes up the ordinary.  Whole tomatoes with less sugar and sodium than normal blah ketchup.  Really happy with this brand and the availability on amazon.

review/summary: Healthy, delicious ketchup made with real tomatoes
review/text: Sir Kensingtons Gourmet Scooping Ketchup is ketchup that tastes like fresh tomatoes from the Farmer's Market. That's probably because it's made from real tomatoes vs. tomato concentrate as other ketchups are. You can actually taste and see little bits of tomato just like the ketchup my grandmother made when I was a kid. It's not even in the same food group as the stuff in the big bottle. I like the classic flavor on all the traditional items that I put ketchup on. But I use the spiced flavor when I want to add a little zing to sauted vegetables or add some body to a Bloody Mary. It also makes a darn good dipping sauce for shrimp, and if you're a ketchup dipper, like my daughter, just about anything else on your plate. I'm delighted that it's now available on Amazon. Just in time for BBQ season. I hope Sir Kensingtons comes out with some other flavors in the future, but keeps that real tomato taste.

review/text: It is just what is says - dried onions. They are not sweet onions. They are flavorful, they have bite -- like a white onion. Rehydrating was simple and fast (10 minutes).<br /><br />Price was OK, not the cheapest, nor was it the highest I've paid. But I didn't buy them because of the price. I bought them because the online info said the country of origin was the US. More and more I'm seeing foods coming in from countries with less stringent safety procedures that we enjoy in the US.  So, when I can, I am buying from US grown foods (I am hoping that the "country of origin: US" means the onions were grown and dehydrated here -- not just packaged and/or distributed from the US.)

review/text: I LOVE this sweetener!  It is exactly what I was looking for.  The Hazelnut flavoring is light but helps soften the aftertaste of regular Stevia.  Don't expect this to taste like a hazelnut shot from Starbucks as the hazelnut aspect is faint, but noticeable enough for me.  I noticed some other reviews said the hazelnut taste can dissipate with time.  I have not noticed this, but I do shake the bottle before each use to ensure everything's mixed well before using it...so maybe that helps the mixture maintain a consistent flavor.

But this is flavored and convenient, lasts a long time.

The company can add their comments if they like, but that doesn't change the fact that I am unsatisfied with my experience.  I order from and through amazon.com once a month or so for the past 2yrs, and in my experience, it takes 7 calendar days or less to receive my products.  Besides, I've had better quality of the same product from a different company.  I tried Penguin Mints because they were cheaper.

I placed an order for 6, and the shipping turned out to be $15.99.  I just looked at the shipping tracker and it says it will take almost two months to get to me via USPS.  Doesn't sound like priority shipping to me, so they are making a bundle from shipping.  I'm waiting to see if they appropriately bundle my order, and if they do, I will return with a positive review on how well they manage their shipping prices.

After much anticipation, I have put my hands on this treasure that I have longed for.<br /><br />Noodle quality wise, I'd have to give this ramen a 5 star, simply because of the smooth texture and the chewiness of the ramen noodle was absolutely wonderful.<br /><br />Soup quality wise, I'd give it 4 stars as I am a Korean-American, I do prefer spicy ramen over not so spicy ones.<br /><br />Overall, it is a very good ramen.  However, I do realize that this ramen made its mark due to a Korean TV show and much of the "myth" was an over-hyped up propaganda.  Good ramen but I heard from many Korean folks that Nagasaki Udon is a much better ramen than Kko-Kko Myun, gonna try that next~

review/summary: Have you checked if your local H-Mart has it?
review/text: Others keep mentioning how expensive this item is, but if like me, it's not found on your local Asian store then it's not overly priced. For right now it's a rare item, shipped directly from Korea, and from my first experience much better in taste than others in the market.<br /><br />If you think that adding chicken and bouillon will get you this taste, then you must have been using some fantastic brand i have yet to try. I'm used to using bouillon on my ramen, because i the usual ramen i use either have too much heat, and not enough flavor; or they amount is too little to really give much flavor with one packet. I have used both Maggi and Knorr. Also, there is always some grainy bits at the bottom of the pot or bowl, from the flavor packet. Something you do not have to worry with this brand.<br /><br />On top of all that, i don't feel there is as much MSG if at all in the flavor packets. Normally i know just how much there is based on the fat/grease left after i eat the ramen, because i have been fooled by not noticing any on the liquid before it cools. There was little to no grease at at all with this brand, which is a major plus for me.<br /><br />The best part? The "heat" level. It doesn't contain pepper flakes, which i hate, or the excessiveness Nong Shim tends to use. I always have to end up using only about half the amount from Nong Shim, and i love spicy food. This brand is spicy, but without heat, which makes the chicken flavor stand out.<br /><br />There is a second packet that brings dried veggies, including green/red peppers and chicken. It's a small amount, so you don't feel like the whole soup if filled with it. It makes it easier to avoid, if you don't want them, but still want the flavor they provide. Or if like me, you want sporadic pieces with every ramen slurp, or broth drink.<br /><br />Honestly, i wasn't expecting much because it's ramen noodles, and the idea comes from a comedian. Whom as much as i like, is a man who doesn't normally cook. But this was better than many i have tried. Should also mention i'm not a big fan of the chicken flavor ramen. I usually prefer seafood or kimchi, but it's not heavily flavored, just savory?

review/summary: Too many oranges!
review/text: I had been buying this candy from a machine (for a quarter at a time) and filling a ziplock bag to take home.  I tried to find it in the bricks and mortar stores, and they don't seem to have it or even know what I am talking about.  I even checked the bulk candy place in the mall (which seems to have gotten very expensive), yet even they didn't seem to know.<br /><br />Nitwitz works well as a "candy dish" candy because the pieces are solid (no candy dust) and don't seem to leave a residue in the dish (like a gummy candy might).  These are very similar to Willy Wonka Runts, but somewhat smaller and more tart.  The only issue with it is that it seems that the oranges make up an outsize percentage of the mix.  I suppose that it is possible that buying it from the machine somehow filtered out the larger orange pieces.  Also, the orange pieces are more like jawbreakers and I will have to warn guests about trying to bite down on them right away.  The other pieces are not quite as hard.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the 2.5 lbs. mix and it should last me for several months.  It arrived in an unlabeled, sealed plastic bag inside two padded envelopes.  There does not seem to be any broken pieces.

review/text: I loved barbecued baked beans but these British-style beans with a simple tomato sauce are so much more versatile.  Just delicious!

review/summary: YUMMY
review/text: I never tried the gourmet food section before. I wandered in here recently on a long shopping trip through the Amazon.com website.<br /><br />I thought these truffles looked to good to be true for the price and decided to try a small quantity, the half pound box.<br /><br />Delivery was very fast for standard shipping, ordered Saturday and they arrived today (Wednesday).<br /><br />There are 8 truffles in the half pound package. Yummy truffle fudge surrounded by terrific hard chocolate. If you like chocolate, you'll be satisfied. My four daughters and wife confirm that these are among the better truffles that they have had.<br /><br />I was not disapointed and expect to be sending more of these to my friends and family.

review/summary: Mother was well pleased!
review/text: I sent these to my mum for Mother's Day and I am delighted to report she was most impressed so much so that I will be re-ordering soon!  The truffles are large, coated thickly with a chocolate shell and have a mouthwatering, creamy, fudgy interior.  Hooray - I did something right for once!

review/summary: Would not order again
review/text: I ordered this product because it seemed it would be good for everyone in the family. I did read the other reviews and knew they were going to be super crunchy, which they were, but they seemed to be stale.  My children said they tasted funny.  I checked if I could send them back but it stated non-returnable.  I threw them away and will be<br />very leary about ordering food products if there is no returns allowed if the product is not good.

review/summary: Am I missing something?
review/text: I purchased this product after the stellar reviews.  I'm a big fan of granola and love to snack on handfuls of it at work and mixed with some milk or yogurt and fresh fruit from the farmers market here in N. Calif. I anxiously opened the package, grabbed one of the small "disks" of granola.  My first reaction was to look for the "use by" date, as I was sure I had stale product.  Hard as a rock and dry (sucked the moisture right out of my mouth).  I was scrambling for a glass of milk. The expiration date wasn't until 2013.  I've been eating granola my whole life and this product just doesn't do it for me.  There's no richness, no smooth texture, and as I mentioned, my mouth is so dry after just one piece, that it's not an effective snack for me. Regarding the flavor, I taste no almond, and the cinnamon is overwhelming.  I have given away the other three bags.  The only thing good about this product is the packaging and clever description (they must have good marketing talent).  Sorry guys....just not my cup of tea...
