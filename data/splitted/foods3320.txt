review/summary: Love this gum!
review/text: Love this gum and always like to have on hand in the car, my work bag, and the office.  Wish they just offered one large box for refilling my existing car cups, but this works too!  Better value then buying in most retail stores unless there is a good sale on it.

review/summary: A little pricy but the best gum around... now
review/text: This is the best gum I've found since Hersey discontinued their Koolerz brand several years ago.  (This stuff is also made by Hersey).<br /><br />Both the Spearmint and Peppermint flavors have a nicely combined minty sweetness that lingers for quite a while.  The texture stays "chewably soft" for even longer.  Another thing I really like about this gum, unlink others I've tried, is it doesn't stick to my fillings or crowns and I don't wind up with little pieces between my teeth.<br /><br />The only problem is the investment to get your first sample.  If you can find it in a store, it's not everywhere, one of these packs costs over a dime a piece.  It can be less, per piece, here but multiple packs is a bit if a gamble if you've never tried it.<br /><br />It's great gum and you will probably like it if you like gum.  I was lucky and sat next to a guy in a plane who offered me some.  And, if you should run into me, ask for some because I'll be having some on hand from now on.<br /><br />Please feel free to let Amazon and me know whether this was helpful to you or not, since it helps me improve my reviews.

review/text: I've tried the fruit flavored ones, they don't last very long (but it's the same for other brand of gum).<br />So I decided to try the peppermint one hoping that it'll last longer. NOPE. The texture is pretty nice though, you can feel the small 'balls' of flavor embedded in the cube. Other than that, I won't be buying it again.

review/text: This is the only kind of Pepperidge Farm cookies that I have had in my lifetime that are just terrible. Very strange...the chips are great, but the cookie part of, well, these cookies, has a nondescript, bland, processed/white-sugar taste. No, you cannot compare the taste to a sugar cookie- it's like an alien's version of a chocolate-chip cookie hastily made in order to use to lure a human to its/his/her spacecraft. The brown sugar is just not kickin' here, so just kick these to the curb.

review/text: What can be said negative about Pepperidge Farm Cookies.....ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! These soft baked, milk chocolate variety from Pepperidge Farm comes with 8 deliciously decadent cookies per package with a total of 5 packages per order and is mouth watering for any cookie or chocolate lover period! To boot, since this type of variety of Pepperidge Farm Cookies NEVER goes on sale at the supermarket or grocery store(at least where I live) unlike Milano and their Goldfish Brands, it would cost you $3.49 per bag X5, for a total of $16.95. Except I pick these up all the time through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon.com for anywhere between my most recent purchase for 5 bags @ $11.04-$11.82 in the past, so you can't go wrong! If the Warehouse Deals(when available) or straight Amazon have a listing available at a higher price then mentioned in this review, then BE PATIENT and rest assure that the price will come down and you'll snag a great bargain like I do all the time on a regular basis. Having some now, Mmmmm!

review/text: I love Pepperidge farm Soft Baked Oatmeal cookies. They make the perfect snack. While other cookies are hard and dry with the texture of sawdust these cookies taste great, and are soft like they've just come out of the oven.<br /><br />Downsides? Each cookie is 130 calories which is a lot for such a small cookie. Also these contain interesterified fats/oils which are chemically altered oils. Not really great for humans to consume.<br /><br />The result? I think I'll bake my own... Without the chemicals. It would probably be safer. 5 star taste. 2 star ingredients. Rating, Average.

review/summary: Oh the Horror
review/text: I've used this for both pancakes and waffles and it's horrible. I followed the directions on the package and the waffles come out extremely dense; it's like eating bread from world war 2. Maybe if you add baking powder and dilute the mix a bit it will come out better. But then why not just make it all from scratch. The pancakes are a bit better, but not by much (using powdered sugar in the dry mix instead of honey made it taste a better). The only positive is that it is all natural and doesn't have any artificial or questionable ingredients. So at least it won't contribute to my premature death and preclude me from finding a better mix.

review/text: It was my local blood bank that told me about Instant Breakfast and that it was a great source of iron. Iron supplements and I just don't agree, so I try to eat foods high in iron. Instant Breakfast is an easy and tasty way to get the iron and other key nutriants. Add fresh fruit or a piece of whole grain toast and you are set. Great as an evening snack when you want something light and healthy. I found that purchasing on Amazon is far less expensive than purchasing in my local grocery stores. The price has jumped a good $1.75 per indvidual box over the course of the last two years.

review/summary: It's ok, but not for me
review/text: I used to love eating mint chocolate chip ice cream before my milk allergy got too bad. It was one of my favorite flavors and so you'd assume that this would have been my first pick of the Dessert Delights group. Not so- it was actually one of the last flavors I'd purchased. Why? Because it's so very hard to get that artificial chocolate flavor right. You know what I'm talking about. For every one non-real chocolate scent, flavor, or what-have-you that someone makes, there's about 10 that taste terrible.<br /><br />I was actually pretty surprised to find that the chocolate taste here was well done. It didn't have that icky "this is totally artificial and vaguely resembles something chocolate" flavor that so many other things tend to get. It isn't identical, but it's darn close.<br /><br />The mint flavor is definitely the stronger of the two flavors, which in my opinion was a wise choice. It helps to mask any shortcomings with the chocolate. Mint is also the predominant flavor in this type of ice cream, so having the chocolate be too strong wouldn't really taste right.<br /><br />Now you're wondering why I only gave it three stars. Well, it's because despite the good flavors, I just didn't really care for this. It's OK, but it's not something I'd actually buy again on a regular basis. If you're absolutely craving ice cream then this is a must-must have, but it's just not my favorite.

review/summary: Gum that Tastes Like Ice Cream - thank you New Jersey!!
review/text: The first time I had this gum, I was taken aback by how much it tasted like chocolate chip mint ice-cream. People I have shared this with had a similar reaction, saying, "Oh, this is quite good!"<br /><br />It is minty enough to freshen your breath. Though this is clearly NOT an all-natural feel-good about the earth product, it is relatively normal tasting -- not oddly chemical like some gums. I have no idea how they captured the creamy taste of ice-cream as well as they have. This is a winner.<br /><br />This gum makes an excellent alternative to dessert. The packaging is good -- it is the kind that has the top that bends back to open but you can tuck it back into a slit to close it. I did not buy it through amazon.com, but at convenience stores on the east coast. I've seen it in North Carolina too. My first pack was a bit shy on longevity of flavor, though it remained very chewable a long time. Luckily, it is not expensive, so you can always pop another one if you want to continue your 'dessert'.

review/text: The best gum ever- honestly.  Unlike other gum with fruit or chocolate flavors, the flavor of this gum holds out because of the mint.  The chocolate does disappear, but it stays for a long time before doing so.

review/summary: Yes, it DOES taste EXACTLY like the Ice Cream!!!
review/text: I'm not a huge gum chewer but occasionally I buy a pack here and there. I was in the grocery store and on a whim decided to buy some gum. When I saw this package it caught my eye because the idea of it seem utterly ridiculous. Ice Cream flavor gum? Since Thin Mint has always been my favorite flavor...I just had to know what this tasted like.<br /><br />In all honesty this gum tastes so good (especially for being sugarless) that makes you take very seriously the idea from Wonka's Chocolate Factory of Gum that tastes like a four course dinner.<br /><br />I love this ice cream. It's my favorite. And this gum tastes so close as to be almost indistinguishable. You could literally give a kid a stick of this to chew on instead of a lollipop or dish of ice cream. You could lose weight on this gum.<br /><br />If they can make gum that tastes like this the potential other foods that could be mimicked boggles the mind. Now I need to try the Key Lime and Shortcake to see if other such miracles are possible.

review/text: My 8 pound puppy gets a greenie every day.  She's a pretty picky eater, and usually takes forever to finish a meal (there are lots of breaks in between bites).  But her greenie is the only thing she will eat without stopping.  She loves the taste.  They also seem to be easy to eat - soft and chewy - so if your dog has sensitive teeth, this might be a good treat to consider.<br /><br />On top of that, greenies are supposed to help with your dog's dental health, which is great for me, because brushing my dog's teeth is really difficult.

review/text: My chihuahua Rocco loves Greenies.  He is a little over 5 lbs but can scarf one down in no time.  I was sceptical about it helping his teeth, especially since the recommendation is one daily.  I use them less frequently, however, I still have noticed a marked improvement in his teeth when I do use them consistently, a few times per week versus daily.  I consider them a special treat and my dog really enjoys them.  They cost $8.99 or more in the pet store, so $6.73 is a deal!

review/summary: I'm impressed
review/text: I admit it, I've been a bad momma and my 3 year old Yorkie's dental health could be better. After a recommendation from a friend, I went out and got a few of the individually packaged ones just to make sure because my pup is a bit of a snot about what she eats. Much to my surprise, she ran off with her Greenie and hid under the chair so the other dogs couldn't steal it from her! It wasn't until weeks later that I observed the ingredients list. Shock of all shocks, my little carnivore is totally into these and there isn't a HINT of any sort of meat in them. Other treats have been snubbed, biscuits go uneaten and the money we spent on treats is invariably NOT worth it. Greenies changed that completely!<br /><br />The only complaint I have is the steep price. I'm grateful to have such a little dog because I get more bang for my buck, but they're worth it. And it's probably much wiser to buy them here in bulk for a dog who's getting them daily. The vet also says these are pretty high in calories, but as our dog is 3 pounds and doesn't eat much anyway, I think these suit her well.

review/text: This is my first review ever.....i had to write one......why? because GREENIES are THE best!!<br /><br />I have a 4 year old Shih Tzu, and like any other dog, he loves dog treats.  The problem is a lot of treats are bad for dogs, and they make him have diahrrea or he throws up.  Well Greenies don't do that to him!  I've given him at least 10 in the past 2 weeks, i give him basically one every other day as a special treat for being a good boy.  He's a good boy a lot! haha<br /><br />Anyway, when i pull out the bag of Greenies, he hears it, he sees it, and goes BONKERS when i open the bag because his keen nose can pick up the scent of what is about to be a delicious treat!<br /><br />If you aren't sure about what treat to buy your dog, look no further, this is THE treat to buy!

review/summary: Awesome for gyros and stews
review/text: I do have to agree that the texture of these "steaks" is somewhat rubbery, and that's why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5. But that firmness is what makes them so wonderful for vegetarian Greek gyros. I slice the steaks thin, marinate them overnight, briefly warm them in a frying pan, and serve them in a pita with hommus and tzatziki sauce. (I make everything vegan, including the tzatziki sauce.) The "steaks" hold up wonderfully, and come as close to Greek gyros as I have ever had. I also use them a lot in stews, where I find that slow cooking softens the "steaks" considerably. As are all the other Worthington and Loma Linda products, the steaks are versatile and can be used in many dishes. UPDATE: 11/08/10. I am wondering why the price on these and all Worthington/Loma Linda products has increased greatly. Anyone have a clue?

Dropping off months of them at a great price!<br /><br />I was able to order the case, delivered at my door in days, for a better price than if I had driven to my local store with a coupon. Of course, Worthington products are a staple in my home. I am a vegetarian so I am always looking for ways to add protien to my diet and these steaks are a quick, easy, and very tasty choice.<br /><br />The steaks are a gluten based protien that can be cooked or grilled whole or sliced and diced. They work well with gravies and will hold other flavors like soy sauce or spices. The best way to describe them is like a very firm dumpling that has been cooked in flavorful broth. They are very verstaile and my non-vegetarian family and friends like them<br /><br />I was able to purchase this case for less than half of what my local stores sell them for AND it was delivered! All I needed was someone to cook it up for us!<br /><br />Makes me hungry just thinking about it!

review/text: I do really like these candies. They have something for everyone. I don't like dark chocolate but my fiance does so this suits us both since it offers two milk chocolate and two dark chocolate varieties. I also love that these chocolates come individually wrapped. I will admit the caramel are my favorite and I went through those really quickly. My only two critiques are the quality of the chocolate. Claiming this is "Premium" chocolate is a bit much. The chocolate quality is equal to Hershey's. The two milk chocolates offered are caramel filled and just milk chocolate, not filled with chocolate ganache or what the picture shows which is peanut butter filled. It literally is just a chunk of milk chocolate, which is mediocre.

review/text: First off this product in itself is a great deal, the chocolate comes out to about $9.4 per pound at a price of around $15.50.  The chocolate in itself is absolutely fantastic but there is one flaw to this product.  I had to dock off one star because personally I like chocolate by itself and although this product does come with milk chocolate pieces I found that the majority of the pieces were the mint and caramel chocolate pieces.  I didn't get a chance to specifically count the number of milk chocolate pieces but based on an estimate I would rank as most chocolate types to least as mint > caramel > raspberry > milk chocolate.  I can't say for sure that if you order one that you will get the same ratio of chocolates but that is just how mine turned out to be.  Like I said earlier the chocolate is fantastic and I highly recommend this product if you're just craving some chocolate! Cheers!

It includes our favorites-caramel, mint, raspberry, and peanut butter. 50 pieces of individually wrapped candy is a generous amount.<br /><br />I added these to my holiday gift treat bags-recipients were very pleased & delighted. Excellent, high quality chocolate. Although not Swiss chocolate- still excellent. (wink, wink).

review/summary: very good qulity product, however
review/text: Package arrived in a timely way and well preserved. Bought for a social gathering to be placed on a desert table. Unwrapped. Each candy is wrapped in foil type plastic. Four flavors. All of the raspberry center candies were broken. Not suitable for the table. Naturally, they will be for me only. Very curious. None of the other candies were broken. Almost as if by design.

review/summary: Mixed Bag of squares
review/text: Received this item and was looking forward to enjoying the candy.  But, to my disappointment, the bag did not contain the peanut butter squares that were advertised.  I only purchased this particular bag of candy because of the peanut butter square, but the manufacturer had replaced this item with another square with no indication of a replacement.  Soooooo disappointed.  Whatever happened to truth in advertising?  Overall, a good candy treat, just not what I had ordered.

review/summary: Healthy and Loved by my dog
review/text: I have three levels of treats and a few beloved dog toys that I use to reward my dog during training.  It's important to keep aside special treats and toys that are only used for important training moments - when you MUST have your dog's attention.  Trader Joe's cheapo brand for getting him to sit, MilkBone for when he responds to a "Come" command and Paul Newman treats to distract him when he meets other dogs.  My dog hates boxers for some reason.  The first night after we adopted him, he attacked my neighbor's Boxer in the hallway as my neighbors returned from a vet hospital visit - it was awful.  About a week later we had the dogs meet again - this time outside on neutral territory.  We made sure they met at a perpendicular, rather than head on, to minimize the chance of conflict.  My dog loves these treats so much that he didn't pay any attention to my neighbor's dog as she sniffed him.  We gave both dogs treats and brought them closer, praising each of them for good behavior and correcting any aggressive behavior immediately.  The Boxer was given her favorite squeak toy in addition to some of these treats and all ended well.  I always carry these treats on walks just in case I see another dog.  These are high quality, healthy, and my dog loves them - he jumps up and down every time he sees me grab the bag.  I don't just hand these out - these treats command attention and are reserved for exceptional behavior and when I need laser focus from my dog!

review/summary: High Quality Dog Treats:  No Wheat, No Corn
review/text: Newman's Own Organic Chicken Treats for Dogs are a big hit with my three dogs; a miniature poodle, a black lab and a standard doxie. Made in Canada these have the following analysis:<br /><br />Crude Protien: 11.5% min<br />Crude Fat: 8.5% min<br />Crude Fiber: 6.0% max<br />Moisture: 10.0% max<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: Barley flour*, ground chicken*, carrots*, apples*, canola oil, rolled oats, natural flavor. Note: (*) indicates certified organic.<br /><br />SIZE: Medium sized in this case means 'heart-shaped', about 1.5" x 1.5". You could actually break them in half for small dogs.<br /><br />While this is not supposed to replace your dog's food, they'd like it if it did! The reason I give it 4 stars is because of the 'premium price'. I picked them up at a local grocery closeout store for $2 a bag with 18 months left until the the 'best before' date. My doggies haven't said anything about them being stale, so I guess Newman's Own has done it again.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Organic, high quality dog treats. Nice product, but a bit pricey.

review/text: The good thing is that my dog likes these, and they're pretty healthy. (She would probably rank the chicken flavor above her kibble and above some crunchy treats but below chicken jerky and freeze-dried liver.) They also break apart easily to make them smaller for training. The bad thing is that they leave "sawdust" when they break apart. Regardless, they're pretty cheap, and as I said, pretty healthy. A solid 4 star treat.

review/summary: My dogs love them
review/text: All my 5 dogs love them (chicken treats). After searching many hours on the internet, I finally found a wholesome product that I can, with confidence, feed my pets. With the lastest pet food disaster, I never want to be in the position again of worrying about the safety of their food.  My dogs are small and the bite size hearts are perfect for them--they come in other sizes for the Medium & large dog.  The zip-lock packaging is great too in keeping them fresh.  Check out their dog food.  Again, I am so glad I found dog food that my dogs love that is prepared to a higher standard of organic, wholesome ingredients. What impressed me the most, the chicken are fed a veg. diet so no hormones, or antiobiotics--that means the chickens are not feed cancer ridden diseased meat.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ML8CA">Newman's Own Organics Adult Dog Chicken Formula (12.5-lb bag)</a>

review/text: If you love rich, creamy hot cocoa, then this is the product for you!  I have been purchasing Godiva's hot cocoa mixes for several years - both the milk chocolate and the dark chocolate.  When they ran out of it at my local grocer, I was happy to discover that Amazon sells this product on-line.  I do not like sickenly sweet hot cocoa and find "just add water" mixes like Nestle too diluted for my taste.  I have even tried adding milk to thicken up other brands' mixes, but nothing so far beats Godiva.  The dark chocolate mix is AWESOME with a little Bailey's Irish Cream in it and topped off with whipped cream and chocolate shavings......  (NOTE:  Although Godiva's milk chocolate mix is good, it is still a little too sweet for me.)

review/text: Godiva dark is my absolute favorite cocoa. It has a rich, complex flavor without the harsh overtones of Swiss Miss-style cocoas. It's also super-smooth and velvety, and dissolves perfectly in hot milk. It was very nice to be able to get a two-pack; the first time I bought this I bought a single, and since there are only ten servings per cannister, this is an expensive cocoa (although worth it now and then for real chocoholics!). Although prices change so make sure you check, when I bought the dual-pack it definitely saved some money.

review/text: While the taste of this Cocoa is excellent, my only gripe is that it has no milk solids or anything included, therefore you must use milk as the base, and you shouldn't use water as some cocoas use.  This may be fine for some, but that adds extra calories.  As a rare indulgence or treat, that is fine, but if you drink hot cocoa very often, that is alot of calories.  Anyway, I only knock one star off for that, because in the end, it is a great tasting cocoa.

review/text: I purchased these as well as other shades of blue M&Ms for a babyshower I threw my friend.  The M&Ms shipped much later than I expected, then when they arrived, they were stale, mostly chipped and cracked like an elephant jumped up and down on ALL of the bags.  If maybe the M&Ms were mostly okay, that would be one thing but the majority of the M&Ms in all three bags I purchased (all different colors) were crap.  They tasted stale like they had gotten warm then frozen because someone caught the overheating error.  They were nasty.  I would have rather purchased normal M&Ms and picked out all of the blue ones than order these again.  What a waste of time and money.  It was embarassing.  I had no choice but to use the "best" looking ones in my favors as the candy arrived at the very last possible moment.  Never again.

review/text: If you like filberts (AKA hazelnuts) this stuff is scrumptious. The only ingredient is ground roasted hazelnuts. They're not completely pulverized like creamy peanut butter; tiny pieces (fewer and smaller than crunchy peanut butter) liven up the texture. I imagine it would be great as a spread, but it's ambrosia right out of the container with a spoon. Plus, if you add a little liquid sucralose and a touch of cocoa powder, you've got low-carb Nutella. Mmmmm.

review/text: Hazelnut Butter tastes amazing! This is my 2nd or 3rd time buying form this company, and while the butter is not cheap, it is worth the price becase it is so good and fresh. I can definitely tell the difference in taste. So far I tried hazelnut and pistachio butters, but hazelnut tastes better in my opinion. The butter is creamy but not as smooth as, lets say, store bought peanut butter (jeff), there are definitely crunchy pieces in there.<br />This company also ships fast, packs well and stands behind their products!
