review/summary: This product doesn't work!!
review/text: Followed instructions exactly!  The pantry moths were flying around me and never went near the trap.  One moth was on the wall and I put the triangle trap over it and the moth did NOTHING!  Just waited until I moved box.  Was not attracted to trap at all.  I am returning it.

review/summary: Attracted nothing did not work at all.
review/text: I was hopeful because I was sick of killing moth after moth. I have never before had this problem but was gone from the house for 2 months and came back to a bit of an infestation. I have gotten rid of all food and completely washed down the whole thing walls shelfs everything. I still get 2-6 a day on the walls that I kill, not one ever went in trap. I am not impressed. I don't know if I should try a different kind or look for a different method. Based on my experience I would not recommend.

review/summary: THEY WORK!!!!!!
review/text: I know this is grody, but I had to show proof{see images} that these really work, it DID take a few weeks to REALLY see a difference, but I went from spending an hour a night wacking and vacuuming moths off the ceiling and curtains to now, literally right now, I have 1 moth to kill. This is only 2 of the traps I put up, there is a 3rd, and I am going to stick up fresh ones just to be sure they are out of here...but yeah, these things are amazing. ALSO, when we first opened the pheromones, there were male moths EVERYWHERE and at first I was upset because none of them went into the trap, but as you can see, they eventually do :)

review/text: I've tried this product several times.  It just doesn't work for me, as for so many others.  I'm an avid baker, and hate moths.  These 'traps' can be up for weeks, and not catch a single moth - while I see moths in my kitchen!  I put in another brand, and the trap fills in a week.  Sorry Safer - maybe you need more product development?

review/summary: Work well but be diligent
review/text: We have been plagued with these moths on and off for a couple of years. I don't know exactly what brings them back, but the traps work well. I've tried others (one with a white disc instead of red) that barely caught one, but these will catch 50 or more! At one point, I thought they disappeared but I realized the traps were almost full and they just weren't flying around.<br />You must be diligent though, don't stop using them because you don't see anymore, wait until they are empty for a while. Don't put them too close to each other, a few feet works better. I have a small kitchen and I put one in the pantry and one on a shelf, one in my den and one in my living room. They don't just stay where they hatch so spread them around.<br /><br />I am hoping as my traps are getting less and less, this is it, but if not, I found this brand works the best. (Sometimes Home Depot has them a bit cheaper but the convenience is great here)

review/summary: Wonderful item!
review/text: I have used these on and off for years because they are indeed effective for the grain moths sometimes seen around the kitchen and pantry.  My rule of thumb is that if you see one moth there are likely to be several more in the area.  If this is the case when you open the bait almost immediately you will see several moths approach the trap.  Put the trap up quickly so that you don't have moths flying at you!  One caution- the life of these traps is limited.  I use a black magic marker to date the outside of the trap so that I can toss it when it expires.  Place these on top of tall cabinets where the moths like to hide for most effective use.  One last thing to remember is that if you keep seeing moths than you should look for the source.  An old box of cereal or bag of flour or pasta forgotten in the back of a cupboard could be the source of the problem and is easily disposed of. The pantry pest trap is a very effective item for both trapping moths and judging for the need for further action.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Addictive Chocolate...
review/text: This stuff is great.  The quality of the chocolate is excellent.  I have purchased this same chocolate from others on the net, but when you get the ones with German labels (e.g. not intended to be marketed in the US), there is no expiration date on the bars.  As a result I have received very old chocolate (with white haze) from others.  Not here!  These ones are in English and labeled with an expiry date.  When purchased directly from Amazon, I have always received chocolates in excellent condition and several months away from their expiry.

review/summary: Savoring the food grade shellac wax
review/text: Anyone who's read my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TXT5I8">Remembering Smell: A Memoir of Losing--and Discovering--the Primal Sense</a> knows that I acquired a taste disorder several years ago. Briefly stated, since mid-1997 I'm unable to taste "sweet", and all foods and most drinks (with the exception of water and milk) taste over-salted, even when they contain no salt whatsoever. However, I can still enjoy flavors, and I've always loved chocolate. So, what chocolate candy comes near to be as satisfying as it used to be?<br /><br />The dark variety probably comes as close as any chocolate ever will. Because it's not as sweet as milk chocolate, there's less sweetness for me to miss, and the slightly bitter taste of the confection somewhat counteracts the saltiness I now endure. (I've had to learn to like things as they now are, not as they once were.)<br /><br />The DARK CHOCOLATE WITH WHOLE HAZELNUTS bar by Ritter Sport is a wonderful treat that I habitually wash down with non-fat milk. The bar is a manly 3.5 oz chunk chock full of whole hazelnuts. If I was the hardy sort to climb Mt. Everest's North Face, I'd take along a supply of these bars to keep up my energy and morale. However, as the 3-serving sized bar contains 210 calories and 15 grams of fat per serving, an entire bar may not be a couch potato's prudent dessert to chase down the chips with nacho-cheese dip and Meat Lover's pizza while watching the football game. And it doesn't go very well with beer.<br /><br />The hazelnut content is exemplary; I can count at least fifteen whole nuts in half the bar in front of me now. (OK, ok. So I already ate 1.5 servings. Just don't tell my wife, an honorary member of the Food Police.)  According to the ingredients list, the nuts are coated with "food grade shellac wax." The result of an Internet search reveals:<br /><br />"Food grade shellac wax is made from 'lac', the red, hardened secretion of the insect by the same name ... simply scraped from the (insect's) host tree, dried to a powder, melted down and then treated with a neutralizing alkali, which is a nitrogenous vegetable substance, so it will dissolve."<br /><br />Hmm. Well, I don't think the source of the shellac will deter me from future consumption of the bar; it's just too good.

Chocolate fine smooth texture with just perfect sweetness is complimented by taste of roasted hazelnuts. It cannot get any better! It's probably very popular, because in stores is usually sold out. Also, buying in bulk like here gets you unbeatable price.

review/summary: Has given the gift of life
review/text: Not trying to be melodramatic here but I honestly believe that the Wysong chicken (and also the beef and turkey) are extending the life of my 15 (at least) year old cat with chronic renal failure.  Three months ago she was in crisis and I was sure she would die.  I read all I could about CRF and the Wysong Au Jus recipe was on a comprehensive list of low solium and low phosphorus foods.  I bought some and could not believe my good fortune when she ate it up.  I know now what triggered the crisis episode - it was the solium in a small amount of ham I gave her as a treat.  I k ow this because  after she was back on her feet and doing great eating Au Jus one night  I let her lick the tiniest amount of spaghetti sauce from my bowl and the next couple of days I could tell she felt bad.  She loves spaghetti sauce and I never considered the high sodium content in it plus it was a tiny bit but it had a big negative impact on her.  So I learned my lesson and she has not had any critical setbacks.  She still has the disease of course and it is apparent.  She drinks a lot of water and she sleeps more than she used to.  Some days she is very quiet but some days she is loud and rambunctious.  And she still  keeps herself clean.  So there is  a quality life there in that little rascal of mine and I truly believe the Au Jus food is why.  Just to keep things interesting for her I keep chunk light tuna in water (nothing on the ingredients list but tuna, water) and Gerber baby food - beef, chicken, and turkey varieties.  It is meat, water, and cornstarch, nothing else.  Mainly she eats the Au Jus but now and then I give her one of the others to keep her from getting bored, which she tends to do.  She is not getting the USDA mandated vitamins and minerals found in most cat food but at this point I feel like that is not a priority.

review/summary: Flavorful Change
review/text: If you're looking for a flavorful change from boring bitter coffee this is perfect. Full of smooth body rich flavor from the first sip, this finishes with a great coffee taste without a bitter or "too strong" ending. I enjoy drinking my coffee black without the additives to cover up taste that just isn't that good. I find this is so good tasting that there is no need to add anything. I do not enjoy Starbucks because to get the flavor you also have to take the bitter and too strong with it. I want a full rich flavor without thinking I am drinking bitter espresso. I would recommend trying this Brazilian favorite and see what you are missing. A mere 6 level tablespoons makes a full 12 cup pot in my Cuisinart maker, so this ends up being quite reasonable in cost as well. 5 Star in my book.

review/text: I bought this for the convenience of not having to boil water and heat up our camper in the summer. I love the ease and convenience of this tea, but wish the flavor were better. Not only is the tea very weak (I need to use three bags to obtain the flavor of one traditional tea bag), it has a slightly "off" taste as well. That said, this is the best tasting of the current selection of CS cool brew teas.<br />It is also a good product in that you can toss a bag into your water bottle before you leave home and have tea for the road with no fuss.<br />We definitely prefer brewed teas to these cool brew versions.

review/summary: Mmm... Hibiscus
review/text: When i bought this product, I was expecting it to taste like Snapple's raspberry iced tea.<br /><br />Well, if you follow the instructions, this stuff does NOT taste like raspberry iced tea.  I use 2 bags of tea for about 16 ounces of water, and if it steeps more than about 5 minutes, it rapidly starts tasting much more like hibiscus flowers than raspberries.  Note that hibiscus is the #2 ingredient.  If you steep for less time, it tastes weak.<br /><br />To counteract this, and get a great batch of raspberry iced tea, add a little lemon juice.  I use about 1 tbsp for the 16 ounces of water.  This hides the hibiscus flavor and brings just a bit of tartness to make it taste more like wild raspberries.<br /><br />I knocked off 2 stars because it isn't easy for me to store lemon juice at work, and my objective with this tea was to save money and get a healthier drink for my afternoon caffeine fix.  It serves the purpose, but it is rather funny tasting without the lemon juice.

review/text: I normally buy this in the decaffeinated version because, quite frankly, I cannot keep the kids out of this stuff!  It's just so easy - grab a teabag, brew it either in hot (add ice cubes) or cold water and voila! Instant iced tea!  If you love the flavored teas in the restaurants during the spring and summer months, well, this will definitely be a treat you won't want to miss.  My son begged me to buy it for him at the grocery and what a neat product!  It's just very, very good, very fast to make, and you don't even have to add sugar.  I'm always amazed at very highly convenient products like this so, I have to ask the question, WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?!  Anyway, sure would have been wonderful to have on my trip to England - unless you're in London, it's VERY hard to get a great glass of iced tea.  Had to show my British girlfriend how to make it the other day!  Great, great stuff, highly recommend!

review/summary: good stuff
review/text: Lipton's noodle soup is awesome.  At work, I fill a very large mug with water and nuke it for 5 minutes.  I then pour my soup mix into my Thermos followed by the hot water and screw on the cap.  After about 5 minutes, the noodles are nice and soft.  The broth is very tasty.  This soup goes great with my turkey sandwich.<br /><br />I always add a really good dash of cayenne pepper to spice it up.

review/summary: Not bad, but not as good as it used to be
review/text: I used to eat this stuff all the time when I was a kid, and I loved it. I couldn't get enough of it. Somewhere between now and then, the recipe has changed, but its still pretty good. One packet is supposed to make 3 servings. Maybe if you are serving it as a side, but if its being eaten as an entire meal, just eat the whole packet yourself. The flavor isn't too salty or strong. Its just a basic noodle soup. Maybe not the best thing out there, and it seems a bit pricey to me, but you could do a lot worse.

review/summary: Lipton Soup Extra Noodle with Real Chicken Broth
review/text: My husband loves this soup.  When we were using the regular Lipton Noodle soup I had to break up angel hair pasta nests and add to get enough noodles in it.  This Extra Noondle soup has a good amount of noodles and we eat it as is with a light sandwich.  If you want just the soup for lunch you can still add a few more noodles to make it even more hearty.  Each individual package makes about 4 cups of soup.

review/summary: Best Dry Soup Ever
review/text: Pro Tip: For a stronger, tastier soup, use a 1 cup measuring cup (the pyrex style) but fill beyond one cup to the rim. (If I had to guess, I'd say about 1.25 cups) Pour in sauce pan, bring to boil, add soup packet. Leave at rolling boil for 2-3 minutes (depending on how firm you like the noodles) then pour into bowl and eat. -- Absolutely awesome this way.

review/summary: Nutritional Misdirection
review/text: Each packet of this soup is NOT single serving size!<br /><br />...and the packaging does very little to correct that misperception: the soup is shown in a coffee mug-sized scenario. You're supposed to add 4 cups of water to each packet; which is more soup than anyone is looking for at lunchtime. Even when you add all that water to the mix, I hope you're on a starvation diet, because the serving size on the box is 2 tablespoons!!!! TWO TABLESPOONS! What are you supposed to do with 4 cups of chicken soup (with a stray micro-noodle floating by now and then) when your alloted portion is two tablespoons? You're supposed to forget that consuming a reasonable amount of soup fills you with 100 percent (if not more) of your daily sodium intake.<br /><br />This is an absurd product.

review/summary: Passable as a scone but nothing phenomenal about it
review/text: I received this product as a gift. I have baked scones from scratch many times and have eaten other prepared scones and bakery scones. These scones, in general, are unremarkable - OK, but nothing extraordinary. If you truly know what a scone should be, please do not be lead astray by its attractive packaging or the gloating reviews it received.<br /><br />This scone mix does have some merits. First, its ease of preparation of just adding water made quick work and a marketable selling point. Next, the scones do bake up tender as a scone should be. The ingredients are on the whole, and for the most part natural without unnecessary stabilizers and dough conditioners. I applaud any baking mix today that doesn't resort to artificial ingredients or preservatives.<br /><br />This is a shelf-stable mix so therefore a crucial ingredient, like butter, is substituted with cheaper canola oil. This sacrifices flavor and texture. There was an insufficient amount fruit in the scone. Since it was a gift, I do not know the exact price for the product, but from what I see being sold at Amazon, it is not economical. You could easily make your own scones resulting in higher quality and quantity. Scones are actually simple baked goods because there is not much to them that requires much time. The simplicity of them makes them divine and something not to skimp upon.

I don't like scones in most bakeries (ugh, Starbucks, I'm looking at you!), and these are a life saver whenever I want a scone with tea. I love scones so much I actually named my cat Scone. I've also substituted the water with milk and cream, and it has come out delicious each time. I like to have a few on hand for company. The scones also freeze well.

review/summary: Liquid Jello?
review/text: Remembering from many years ago when I tried the regular instant tea and was not entirely satisfied with the taste, but now being a raspberry ice tea freak, I thought I'd give this a try. It really doesn't resemble the raspberry ice tea that I often order in restaurants, it reminds more of jello in aroma and taste. But, this won't go to waste. I made a gallon jug of regular tea (I just LOVE those Lipton gallon size single bags) and added this already sweetened raspberry mix to replace approximately 2/3's of my usual sweetener (2 to 1 ratio). I always use some of the boiling water for steeping to pour in the jug with my sweetener so that it's dissolved before I mix in the brewed tea. This combination makes for a nice subtle raspberry flavored ice tea without using up your favorite raspberry tea bags. Too bad I haven't found larger raspberry tea bags for mass quantities like I like.<br />On it's own, I really liked that this mix was easy and quick to dissolve in cold water, just don't expect it to taste like tea. I also like that you can adjust the sweetness. Hint: try less before more.<br />I'm so glad I found this here on Amazon, it's never stocked in my area.

review/text: I don't normally like sweetened tea.  This is more raspberry than tea flavor, so to me it's similar to a light fruit punch. Each cannister makes 10 qts, so it's economical and I got it at the Amazon Warehouse Deals website (not the regular amazon website) at a significant discount.  This tea mix can be adjusted to taste, dissolves quickly when mixed, and has an enjoyable flavor without being like Hawiian punch stuff.  I think it actually is going to be mixed alot with sun tea this summer!

review/text: Well, to say this was disappointing is putting it mildly.<br /><br />I love raspberry iced tea, and always try to get it at places like Denny's, Taco Bell, whereever it<br />might be offered. While I knew this had sugar in it (most premixes do), I still wanted to try it, as I am trying<br />to break a Pepsi habit I acquired in the last few years.<br /><br />I originally wanted to buy raspberry kool aid and just add it to a pitcher of regular iced tea.<br />However, good luck finding the raspberry kool aid! What did they do with it?!<br /><br />Anyway - this makes a RED drink, and it tastes like raspberry kool aid that they waved a tea sprig<br />over. It isn't horrible tasting, but do not buy this thinking that you will be making a glass of tea<br />with raspberry flavoring. You'll be making raspberry kool aid with a tiny bit of tea flavoring.<br /><br />I won't be buying it again, that is a big fer-shure.<br /><br />Lipton - you can do SO much better - why don't you try it?<br />You already know how to do tea - now you need to work on flavorings and sweeteners.<br />Here's a news flash - most of us do NOT want aspartame in our drinks any more.<br />PLEASE change over to stevia, which does not cause the side effects or raise blood glucose levels.<br />Listen to the customers...<br /><br />Meanwhile, pass on this one!  : P

A lot of it is personal preference, but I've eaten my fair share of canned salmon, but common sense told me I should cut my loss with this, rather than suffer through a horrible lunch or risk getting sick.

Today however, only the chocolate flavor and in some stores for the holidays the gingerbread flavor is available.  I do enjoy these but the "Originali" is my runaway favorite.  The sources for the 1-lb 14-oz container show prices 40% higher than the warehouse club, and then you have to add unreasonable shipping amounts.  So the deal now is the 12-pack of boxes of 8 for a total of 96 biscotti at a price rivaling the warehouse club.

review/summary: Nonni's biscotti at a bargain
review/text: I usually buy Nonni's at the supermarket when it is on sale and I have a coupon because they are an expensive luxury. This is a great price, especially if you can take advantage of the $10 off $49 in the grocery department offer.  They are great with coffee or hot cocoa.

review/summary: Nonni's Biscotti, Toffee Almond
review/text: I had these Biscotti on vacation and really enjoyed them.  So when I saw them on Amazon, I jumped at the chance to buy them again at a good price.  While the Biscotti were very tasty, they were somewhat stale and not as crunchy as I remember from vacation.  Also, I noticed the expiration date was two months away from when I purchased them.  I don't know what the expiration dates are on those in the local grocery store but I wondered if these were excess Biscotti and that is why they were inexpensive.

review/summary: Great biscotti, but had better price...
review/text: I've just bought this biscotti at Walmart for $2.88 an 8-pack. Wonderful flavor! Chocolate flavor, with more chocolate on the bottom, deliciously crisp, and has a nice almond flavor, too.<br />However, if you buy 12 pack at Walmart it comes to $34.56, so the price here is not that great. I just don't like when they put a price here, then cross it and make you believe there's a deal you are getting.

review/summary: Nonni's Toffee Almond & Lemon Biscottis
review/text: great product; unfortunately shipping took a toll on the biscotti's (majority arrived in crumbs & broken pieces). Have since ordered an additional 8 boxes. The lemon ones were shipped in a second Amazon box which seemed to provide some additional protective, as only a few were broken in some of the boxes. Would recommend seller in the future ship all 12 pack boxes in a second box and add extra cushioning protection. It would allow folks to dunk their biscotti's rather than have to eat direct from the wrapper and get crumbs everywhere.

review/text: This is a wonderful snack to have whenever you have a craving for something to munch.  Each box contains 8 individually wrapped biscotti.  I normally don't like biscotti, finding it too hard on my teeth and too boring for my taste.  This brand's biscotti, however, has the perfect combination of sweetness, crunchiness, and chocolaty goodness!  It's made from Kosher ingredients and 100% trans fat free.  I bought a case (pack of 12) so I can share them with my family and friends.  Highly recommended!

review/text: Until recently, I was able to purchase Nonni brand Chocolate Decadence Biscotti at some of my local markets.  Then suddenly they disappeared from the shelves.  When I went on-line to the Nonni web page I was told I could order from Amazon...and I did.  The package arrived on time, was packed carefully and not one of the biscotti was broken.  All are fresh, delicious and enjoyed each day. They are individually wrapped, have 100 calories each, do not have strange ingredients...and they are perfect when they are dunked into iced coffee!!!!

review/text: Nonni's Biscotti is a good quality and tasty Biscotti. It is also available in most stores and supermarkets. Occasionally supermarkets have sales on Nonni's Biscotti, and when they do, It is much more cost effective then buying their product online which is higher priced. Overall, It is a good buy when Amazon can compete with those sales prices.

review/text: This biscotti is graced with a thin layer of limon (lemon) frosting sweetness.  Not the tough biscotti that has to soak for 10 min. before it can be eaten, these are easy to eat like a cookie, or quickly absorb your hot beverage.  My Japanese exchange student loved these, and when she returned with some to her home in Nagano, her mother wanted more!  So I purchased a case of my own and have sent her a couple of 8-count boxes as a present.  I have been unable to find them in the local grocery stores like I used to.  Other flavors are still available in stores, but not my beloved limon!  But they can be ordered!

review/summary: Not a fan of biscotti in general, but Nonni's get two thumbs up!
review/text: I am not normally a fan of biscotti. Typically, they involve a stale cookie with too much crumble, too much poor quality dark chocolate, and not enough taste...This one however, is different! Let me start with the price: on Amazon I paid 40% less (!!!) with free delivery, then in my grocery store! Hurray! Other then that, why Nonni's?<br /><br />1) They are not as dry and crumbly as other biscotti I have tried over the years. The toffee adds a bit of moisture without being gooey. They are gentler on my teeth, but still with enough cruch to make one biscotti a satisfying snack (at 110 calories), and allow for dunking.<br /><br />2) Individually wrapped, they keep fresh and moist (as moist as a bicotti can possibly be...) for quite a long while. It is good to have an extra box or two for unexpected guests.<br /><br />3) MILK chocolate!!! (I HATE dark chocolate...I'd rather eat spinach...but that is what most biscotti are covered in). There is just enough of it to give you a taste without making you feel you are eating a chocolate bar!<br /><br />ENJOY!

Also found one box with a wierd mound of dried glue on the box with dirt and hair imbedded in the glue. I managed to forget the above and enjoy the biscotti...I tossed the box with glue mound. At least I hope it was glue.

review/text: A Nonni's biscotti is a wonderful treat with a good cup of coffee.  They help me start my day on a bright note.  The Nonni's that come in an eight pack are just the right size.  Often the ones that come packaged in the gallon jars are too big to suit my taste.

review/summary: GREAT PRODUCT.
review/text: THESE ARE VERY GOOD BISCOTTI! I'VE ORDERED 4 BOXES OF 12 IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS. THEY WERE NICE TO GIVE AS GIFTS. THEY WERE GOOD TO BRING TO SOMEONES HOUSE FOR DESSERT. THE CHOCOLATE DECADENCE AND THE ONES WITH THE TOFFEE BITS AND ALMONDS ARE VERY GOOD. THE ONLY NEGATIVE IS THE SHIPPING AND HANDLING COST. IF I DID NOT GET THE FREE SHIPPING AND HANDLING; I WOULD NOT HAVE ORDERED THEM. THEY'RE GOOD; BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO SPEND AN EXTRA $20 TO DELIVER.
