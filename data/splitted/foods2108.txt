review/summary: inferior quality lifesavers
review/text: I received a gift of twenty rolls ofwild cherry lifesavers.  It came in two boxes shrink wrapped together.  the first box was wonderful.  I love wild cherry lifesavers.  The second box so far has been repuslive.  Five out of five rolls that I have tried taste like they have gas or something poured over them.  A very nasty flavour.  This is not Amazons fault of course but the llifesaver company.  I want to write to them and ask if they are now having their products made in China.  There is nothing to say where they were made on the packaging.  So if someone could help me with this I would appreciate it.  Amazon is very good tit is the lifesaver that stink.

review/summary: Mixed Lifesavor flavors with no return possible.
review/text: Very disappointed, lastshiment (12 bags) of Wild Cherry Lifesavers had sour flavors mixed the wild cherry flavor. it was mixed throughout all 12 bags. My customers complained and when I went to Amazon to return, guess what no luck because they are considered a Grocery item. Had to take them all back and refund money. No avenue to get consideration from Amazon. I buy many products and this small item bothered me because no return eligible.

review/summary: My Lord My Lord!!!!
review/text: These are so good I don't even eat them.  I just stare at them in a jar for hours on end. The individual wrapers make me feel warm and cozy on a rainy day. The color of bag reminds me of the time I washed all my whites with a red football jersy and got beat up by my team mates for wearing pink underwear in the locker room after a game. God!..what a day that was. The holes in the middle are dreamy and transport me to tropical islands where I run naked with the locals looking for fruit that the monkeys haven't found yet. I'm in love or maybe I'm just moved by some left over hormomes from my youth. One or the other, I feel like there is more to life than I can find words for. LifeSavers are my life now. I'm completely and totaly bound to them from the foundation of my soul.  Thank you for lifesavers lord..Thank you.<br />Amen.

review/text: I mainly bought this candy for my mother.  Here in the Northern Virginia area just south of DC, she's tried to find these Wild Cherry lifesavers everyplace she's tried and nobody had them.  Local Walmart, Target, supermarkets like Safeway, Giant, Shoppers and Wegman's.  Nobody had them.  They would only have the 5 flavors of Lifesavers and the 2 mint lifesavers.  Peppomint and spearmint.  So I found them through amazon and now my mother is in heaven.  She loves wild cherry flavored lifesavers.

I love an easy meal and just by using the spice packs and some ground meat, you've got it!  I add sour cream and chopped cheddar on the table for toppings, a good bread and we are all happy.

review/summary: What I added to make it 7 kinds of awesome
review/text: I cooked it as prepared, but I used 1.3 lbs of ground chuck in a coarse chili meat size grind, and I took the meat out of 1lb of Beer Brats from Target. I used one 8 oz can of HEB whole tomatoes with chilis and 1 can of HEB diced tomatoes with chilis and blended them in a blender instead of tomato sauce. I also added about 1/8 cup of honey and 1/8th cup of raw sugar (you can find it on the coffee aisle.) Why honey and raw sugar? The honey makes it richer, and you get a bit of a sweet taste (not much) at first, then the spice gives you that 'Ahem'-clear your throat-feel when you swallow it. A bit more complex. You'll get that on every bite. A bit sweet, then spice. I also added 1 tbsp of black bean garlic sauce, which is an oriental item so look on that aisle. And a half cube of chicken bouillon.<br /><br />I added 1 cup of dry pinto beans that were prepped by simmering until tender, and drained. Continue cooking for a few hours.<br /><br />If you can really wait, eat it the next day as with most chili and stews so the flavors come together.

review/summary: My dog loves this food!
review/text: I ordered this food because I had been looking for more healthy alternatives than the food that I had been feeding my beloved girl and had purchased a 5 lb bag from my local grocery store. Not only does it receive high marks from various websites that examine the ingredients in different dog foods, but once my dog had tasted this food, there was no going back to what I had been feeding her. I tried several different 'healthy' brands of dog food for her and she refused her old food as well as any of the other brands of food. Since none of the local stores carry it in larger sizes, I ordered it online to save money.<br /><br />If you're looking for a healthy dog food, I highly recommend it. More important, my dog seems to!

review/summary: chewy banana "chips"?
review/text: I will say first and foremost that I should have read that "banana" is listed second on the front of the package and in the description. I didn't realize 1) how sweet they would be and 2) how chewy mine were when others described them as "crisp." (the heat index is over 100 today though so some super heating while shipping may have affected, who knows)<br />They're chips as in disks about the size of a quarter, and to me they're very close to the chewy dried banana chips I had as a kid, now it's just like there's just grass mixed in. This is not necessarily a negative, as I definitely expected something with spirulina in it to taste very green and earthy, banana just takes over anything it touches and it has done so here as well. I wanted more of the spriulina/sesame seed taste i suppose.<br /><br />I think this is a great company and despite the high price tag of goods such as these, it's still lower than storefront retail and seems to be VERY high quality. I'm looking forward to trying their other offerings.

review/text: I feel good about eating these snacks, especially for their low sodium, but wow are they ever sweet! I have quite a sweet tooth (mostly for chocolate) and I rarely find anything that's too sweet for me to eat too much of :-) But these chips are cloyingly sweet. After just 2 or 3 I need to stop and drink water and find something else to snack on. So they're sure to last a good long while and I do recommend them. Just know what you're getting into. I plan on trying at least one of the others in their line to see if it's just this spirulina version that's so sweet.

review/summary: Preparing raw food...
review/text: Can be very time consuming. We aren't 100 percent raw but I try. We are fortunate to have a restaurant about 20 miles from us but I still prepare the bulk of our meals. Salads and fruit get tiring as snacks and these offer a wonderful alternative to a veggie tray for guests or a bag of carrots in my hubby's work bag.<br />They are health filled and all flavors are wonderful. My husband prefers chocolate. I have found the ginger flavor to be too strong for some children.<br />I was delighted to find them on Amazon so I can always keep some on hand. The "cookies" have a slight crunch and don't get stale if the package has been left open for a day or two.<br />I recommend them to anyone who is looking for a healthy snack. You don't have to eat raw to appreciate their flavor and nutrients. And, I am confortable sharing them with my dogs, unlike some of the garbage that is sold as pet snacks.

review/text: Got these after watching a Dr. Oz show.  The audience member who ate them said they tasted like bananas.  Excuse me?  They do have a very green flavor.  They are about the size of a quarter and are crisp, but chewy once you get a chuck in your mouth.  They have some sesame seeds in them, I think (hope?).  They are edible...just.  I suppose since they are good for you, they are worth devouring.  I would try to find something with a stronger flavor to eat one or two with.  Maybe Spicy V8 or along with a plate of really hot buffalo wings...but why ruin the wings.  Just find a way to get them down.  Definitely buy ONE bag to try before you go for a bulk rate shipment.  Guess what my health food friends are getting as part of their Christmas Goody packages?  :^)

I used to feel so sorry every time I was in grocery store because of the born diabetics who had to pay more for the healthy diet to save their lives. I had a best friend in the 1980's who I watched get diabetes. Finally being old I've got it now. Only I'm so lucky that Amazon makes it easy for me to enjoy my Hershey pacifier and economically.

review/summary: Yummy to make into pizza for one!
review/text: This is the best pizza crust mix we've tried for a corn-, wheat-, soy-free diet. I modify the mix, though, so I can make multiple individual crusts, fresh, over a period of time. I've been using this ratio for over a year:<br />3/4c. dry mix<br />5/8c. water (1/2c+2T., but I just eyeball it in a 2c Pyrex glass measuring cup)<br />1/2t. oil<br />I do follow the mixing instructions -- about 15-30 seconds on low to get it all wet, quickly scrape the bowl with a spatula, then on a med/med-high speed for 3min. It looks rather like cake batter when you're done mixing. Then I pour it out on a silicone baking mat that's placed on a cookie sheet (or you can just use foil on a cookie sheet and spray the foil with oil), spreading it around in a circle of even thickness, about 10" in diameter (the spatula works great for spreading). Bake in a preheated oven at 450 (yes, 450) for 15-20m, remove and add sauce and other desired toppings, then bake another 8-10m. Depending on one's appetite, this makes enough for 1-2 meals for 1 person. Super yummy! Each bag makes maybe 4-5 crusts of this size, if I recall correctly. You may have to slightly modify the water or time based on your preferences, but I've made at least 1 a week like this for over a year and it works great for us! Once you get the hang of the routine and spreading out the "batter" the prep time is mostly the 3m of mixing.<br /><br />We've also tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTKRZQ">Bob's Red Mill Pizza Crust Mix, 16-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> -- a good tasting crust, but this one is faster (no rising time for the yeast), and super easy to scale down to individual size as there is no yeast packet. Plus, I prefer the seasoning in this Namaste crust.

review/summary: Namaste Pizza Crust Mix is AWSOME!
review/text: Let me first say that I am very impressed by this product ( I am a food snob to say the least).  My husband worked in a pizza parlor as a young man and is a pizza fanatic.  When he was diagnosed with a wheat intolerance he thought his life was over.  I am an accomplished cook/baker and have spent a great deal of money time and energy learning how to cook for our new lifestyle.  I refuse to give up taste and texture in anything I make.  If it doesn't taste exactly like or better than the normal wheat based products I will not make it again and it does not go into my recipe book.  We have tried all of the gluten free frozen pizza's on the market and those made in local pizza parlors and have been disappointed.  This product makes a wonderful flavorful pizza crust.  Here is how it is done.<br /><br />1.  Purchase a 16 non-stick pizza pan and a 16" pizza screen.<br /><br />2.  Heat your oven to 450 degrees (I have a gas oven) and place your oven rack on its lowest setting pulling your second rack out to be used later.<br /><br />3.  Mix the dough as directed (I use hot tap water).<br /><br />4.  Spray the pizza pan with PAM or your choice of a non stick spray and pour dough out onto the pan.<br /><br />5.  Spread the dough which is like a thick cake batter completly to the edge of the pan.<br /><br />6.  Bake for 20 minutes and then pull out of the oven.  The crust will have shrunk about 1" in from the sides of the pan and would have turn up slightly which is normal and a good thing to help hold in your sauce and toppings.<br /><br />7.  Use 3-4 heaping kitchen tablespoons of ragu traditional pizza sauce to lightly cover the baked crust.  Using to much sauce will cause your toppings to slid off the pizza when eating and contributes to a soggy crusts which many home pizza makers experience.<br /><br />8.  Cover the sauce with a light coating of mozzarella cheese.  By this, I mean you should still see 50 percent of the pizza sauce not covered in cheese.<br /><br />9.  Place your toppings of choice and then cover again with mozzarella cheese.  Many people place to much cheese on their home made pizza which will also ruin the final taste of the finished product.  I highly recommend you go light on your toppings the first time you make your pizza and then adjust up after you have established your baseline.<br /><br />10.  Pop this back into the oven on the lowest rack and cook for 10 additional minutes.  The cheese should have completly melted meaning it is smooth and you no longer see individual shreds.<br /><br />11.  Turn on your broiler and bake for an additional 3-5 minutes being sure to watch the cooking cheese making sure it does not burn.<br /><br />12.  This is VERY IMPORTANT.  When done, pull out of the oven and slide it onto the 16 pizza screen to cool for approximately 4 minutes.  Ensure the screen is placed on top of another type of wire rack....I use the rack I've pulled out of the oven since I do not leave my top rack in when baking pizza's.  You must let air get to the bottom of the pizza in order to let it release the built up heat and steam.  This is why so many home pizza pies have soggy crusts.<br /><br />13.  Slide onto cutting board and slice your pie and then return it to the pizza screen.<br /><br />14.  When reheating the pizza I would recommend you reheat it in the oven on a piece of tinfoil coated with PAM at 450 degrees for approximately 5 minutes.  The crust will be perfect.  I love this product so much I have purchased 2 cases through amazon.  Trust me....you will not be dissapointed.

review/summary: Best Gluten-Free Pizza Crust
review/text: I have tried many gluten free pizza crusts, and this is by far the best. Be sure to use very hot water when mixing it (near boiling). This will make the dough easier to handle. I recommend making many small pizza crusts and storing them in the freezer so you can pull them out, add toppings, and toss in the oven for a few minutes. Makes a great quick meal.

review/summary: Best allergen-free pizza crust!!!
review/text: This pizza crust is delicious!  Our whole family loves it!!  We put cheese and toppings on them.  My child who is allergic to everything just has toppings on his (no cheese), and he eats it all.  We made personal pizzas out of the dough so everyone in our family could make their own special pizza to enjoy.  Whenever we want to have pizza night...this is pizza crust mix we will use every time.  We are thrilled to be able to eat pizza again in our house!  Thank you Namaste!!  I agree with the previous reviewer...I, also, make many small personal-size pizza crusts and store them in the freezer.  When I need to make a quick lunch or dinner, I just pull them out, thaw them a bit, warm up the oven, add toppings, and cook for 10 min. or so in the oven.  Nice.

review/summary: This Was An Excellent Pizza Crust
review/text: I was a loyal customer of this product for over four years.  It WAS the best pizza crust by far!!!  BUT, they reduced the amount of mix per pizza.  Used to use 2.25 cups of flower for a 14" pizza.  Now, they want you to use 1.25.  It is terrible now.  You have to reduce the amount of water that they recommend in order to get a crust that is not too watery.  I am very disappointed. I am not a celiac, but my wife is.  I enjoyed this pizza crust even more than regular wheat flour crusts.  But, no longer.  Namaste, raise the price on your product.  Do not try and fool people by giving us less product and telling us it makes the same amount.

review/summary: Excellent alternative to regular pizza crust....
review/text: I can't eat sugar or gluten or yeast, so this is about what I can eat when it comes to pizza crust.  My boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised.  We bought it and as we were about to make it, discovered we needed an electric mixer, which we don't have.  We just mixed vigorously with our hands and it still turned out okay.  We followed directions: cooked for 10 minutes first, then added toppings, then cooked a little more--and what it resulted in was a crisp pizza crust that tasted pretty darn good. I think other negative reviewers are disappointed that it's not exactly like regular pizza crust--and it's not going to be.  In other words, you're not really going to be able to bend it in half and get that malleability that comes w/normal pizza crust.  However, this is as close as it gets, I think and I was very happy with it.

review/text: This product is wonderful.  After feeling like you're missing out on pizza....try this.  It's so much better than regular pizza crust and wheat free.  It does take a little practice to work with the dough but sooooo worth it.  Your family will not want the traditional pizza dough anymore.  It's like a gourmet blend with herbs in it.  I put pepperoni, Emerils gaarlic sauce, mozz. cheese & cook.  I finish it with chunks of Feta. Wonderful meal!

review/summary: This one is a favorite
review/text: When I make these I use the entire bag to make two pizzas, but use less water than the recipe calls for. I also coat a large pan in olive oil and then press each pizza out with oiled hands. By using less water and oiling my hands, it becomes easier to work with. You can also add herbs or even flax seed to the dough before mixing.<br /><br />I bake it without toppings for 8 minutes, then I take it out of the oven and add my homemade pizza sauce and top it with cheese, lots of thinly sliced veggies and sometimes gluten free pepperoni. I then bake it for about 15 minutes and it comes out perfect with a crunchy but also chewy crust (the extra olive oil helps here).<br /><br />It's definitely worth buying and my fiance, who can eat gluten, gobbles up his portion in record time.<br /><br />Also, try their spice cake mix. It makes a great carrot cake. Just follow the directions and then make your own cream cheese frosting (Paula Deen has a calorie heavy recipe that is very good) and keep the cake covered in the fridge. It's divine!

review/summary: My Favorite GF Pizza Crust Mix
review/text: I've tried a few others (Bob's Red Mill, Pamela's) but like this mix the best. The added spices give it a great flavor that sets it apart! I also sometimes like to add parmesan cheese to the mix as I'm mixing it. I agree with SisterZ's redo of the recipe, since I make a roughly 10" pizza to consume myself. I generally get 4 pizzas from one bag this way. When cooked correctly, the crust comes out just stiff and crunchy enough for me, without being spongy or seeming too dense. I generally just spray a pizza baking sheet with cooking spray and pour/spread the dough directly on it, and after baking it comes off without sticking. While I do like the frozen Glutino pizzas as well as the GF pizza from Z-Pizza, I really love to make my own, and I would highly recommend this crust mix!

review/summary: Good gluten-free pizza crust
review/text: This crust took a little experimentation at first, but now it makes a very good gluten-free pizza.  I found that using extra olive oil and white rice flour keeps it from being so sticky - I even grease and sprinkle the baking sheet with rice flour to prevent sticking.  Too much water can ruin it, though hot water seems to work best.  Also, baking the crust before applying the toppings works best.

review/summary: Amazing Product Very Pleased
review/text: I have to admit I was a bit nervous especially as I bought a case of this as well as cases of the other Namaste products for my son.  His sudden onset of a seizure disorder put me in hyperdrive researching anything and everything I could do to make it stop.  One direction was nutritional.  I basically had 2 choices. . .  ketogenic or GARD diet (dogtorjdotcom).  I went with the Glutamic/Aspartic Reduction Diet which nixed all corn, wheat, dairy and soy as well as peanut and legumes etc.  My son is 8 and has siblings who are not affected in any observable manner from not eating the GARD diet so I did not want him to feel resentful.  He has Everything now.  ..  and we've been Thrilled with Everything . . . the pizza crust (crispy, make sure you precook it sufficiently or it will have a noodle like texture), the pancake/waffle mix (just did it today and Everyone liked it), the Brownie Mix (AWESOME), The Chocolate Cake mix (yes!! He can't wait for his birthday) . . . we have been Ever So Pleased with the Namasate line of foods and with their customer service. . .  they'll gladly send you coupons, recipes, etc.  Like I said to them in an email, "Whoever you are and whatever you went through to make this product available, THANK YOU."  It is a godsend.

review/summary: Worked fine but had a huge bubble!
review/text: This does not taste anything like wheat pizza dough, but it was easy to follow the instructions.  It came out very crispy on the edges with a huge bubble the size of the pizza rectangle, so I had to punch holes in it before I added the toppings.  The toppings are what make it taste even somewhat like pizza.  I am not gluten intolerant (as far as I know), but I wanted to test it out. I found it at TJ Maxx for $3.99.  I would recommend this mix for those with gluten intolerance or Celiac's.  It is a good substitute and it's fine if you need a way to make pizza for a family that needs to accommodate different diet requirements.  I like that you don't have to let the dough rise first.  It takes at least 30 to 35 minutes at the very least to make a pizza since you need to bake the crust first and then add the toppings.  You will also need an electric mixer to beat the dough mixture.

I wasn't sure how I would like the seasoned crust, but it was fine.<br /><br />I used a standing mixer to mix the batter, and -- beware -- the splatter guard is necessary.  If you don't have a splatter guard, you should mix slowly at first, until the water is well incorporated.<br /><br />The only problem with the crust is that it came out somewhat gummy in the middle.  I think I should try to make it thinner next time, or use less sauce, or cook it longer, or invest in a pizza stone rather than using a cookie sheet.

review/summary: Best Pizza Crust Mix
review/text: We love this pizza crust.  It is the best mix we have found.  It has a focaccia bread taste because they put it some italian seasoning.  So good!

review/summary: Best pizza dough ever
review/text: Needed a pizza dough which was gluten-free, dairy-free and yeast-free.  Most gluten-free included yeast.  I bought this hoping to "dress up" with enough toppings to overlook the limitations of the crust.  It is hands down the best mix of pizza crust we've ever had (gluten notwithstanding).  Just opening it up, you can smell the spices and look forward to the taste.  We have had much more success on a pizza stone than a pan.  Even spraying with oil, it still wants to stick to the pan and doesn't crisp up as nicely.  My whole family enjoys, even those who aren't restricted by diet.  Would recommend to anyone.

review/summary: at last a crust!
review/text: I bought this for my daughter who can have no grains (except brown rice) and no sugar or dairy. The first time we baked this it made a HUGE bubble and did not bake through properly. Since then we have begun tweaking and have added a little more rice flour and scored the "dough" before starting to bake. Viola! What has finally turned out is the closest thing to a pizza crust she has had in YEARS.

review/text: I'm a little surprised at the rave reviews here.  We tried this mix and it was ridiculously over-spiced.  Even my s.o., who generally likes intense Italian spices, thought it was was way over-doing it.  The texture wasn't really great either - I don't know if we made a mistake somehow, but it was very dense.  We ended up using some of this mix to bread some Italian Parmesan chicken - it worked pretty well for that, at least!

review/summary: OMG! This oatmeal is addicting!
review/text: I was growing tired of my regular oatmeal routine, and saw this on my grocer's shelf yesterday while shopping.<br /><br />I LOVE chocolate, but generally steer clear of most instant oatmeals because they lack that chewy, whole oat texture and are typically loaded up with things I'd prefer to not eat.<br /><br />This oatmeal has it all... a great texture, perfectly balanced dark chocolate flavor (with real chocolate morsels), an ingenious self-measuring pouch (for the water), and a terrific price point.<br /><br />I'm hoping Amazon will carry it soon, as I am already addicted to this delicious product!

review/summary: A touch disappointed
review/text: I've been eating some of the BetterOats oatmeal options for the last several months.  When browsing on Amazon one day, I found that such a thing as chocolate oatmeal existed.  My heart nearly stopped.  How could it be that I had never heard of such glory?  BetterOats makes some delicious oatmeal options, however, after finally tasting this product, I can say that the the dark chocolate oatmeal is good but not great. If I had been unable to find this in a local grocery and I knew what it tasted like, there would be no way that I would purchase it for 13 to 17 dollars (as most Amazon vendors are commanding) for three boxes.  Some things to consider:<br /><br />1) Finding the product:  If you are flirting with the idea of buying this stuff online, I will say I was in the same boat.  I was tempted about three times to purchase it from vendors commanding quite a premium.  I held out hope I would find it for less and finally I did.  Meijer sells a box of five packets for 1.99 (look in the hot cereal section).<br /><br />2) The consistency of the product:  One thing I love about BetterOats is that all oatmeal products are packaged in a bag that has a fill line. The user uses the bag as a device to determine how much water is needed for the oatmeal. I'm one of those folks that always uses too little water, which leads to a gluey, unsatisfying mess. If you use the bag to measure the water you need, your oatmeal will never be dry or soupy.<br /><br />3) The flavor:  It's good.  It's not overly sweet and definitely not bitter.  I guess I expected more chocolate morsels, which a person could definitely add on their own.  It simply was not as decadent as I had hoped for.  I actually prefer the company's chai or peaches and cream options, which have relatively vibrant flavor profiles.<br /><br />4) The nutrition:  The calorie content surprised me in a good way.  A lot of the BetterOats options have 160 calories per bag.  The chocolate oatmeal also has 160 calories.  The ingredients are predictable for a chocolate oatmeal.  The first ingredient is whole grain rolled oats and the second is sugar.<br /><br />5) Power to satisfy:  I did not find this oatmeal to be as filling as other options offered by this company.  It really only held me over for two hours.  The company's other options usually get me through three - four hours.<br /><br />Ingredients: Organic whole grain rolled oats, sugar, chocoalte chips (sugar, chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, lecithin, vanilla), cocoa, flaxseed, salt, natural flavor, guar gum.

Also, this is great with a little nut butter (peanut, almond, hazelnut) mixed in - like a no-bake cookie for breakfast!

Probably one of the worst things to eat in the morning next to poptarts! WRONG. This oatmeal is delicious, and yes HEALTHY!<br />Take some time to chop up a couple strawberries and you've got yourself chocolate covered strawberry oatmeal...THATS HEALTHY!

review/text: Dark chocolate oatmeal that's healthy sounds like a great idea, right?  In theory yes.  But in practice, this product is just a disappointment.  It smelled gross cooking.  I took one bite when it was done, and then had to add like 6 teaspoons of sugar to it and a little milk.  And then I STILL couldn't eat it.  It is the worst oatmeal I have ever tasted.  Don't waste your money on this!<br /><br />I will admit however, that I liked the convenient way that you measure your water in the empty pouch.  That is all.

The taste is wonderful. They are the only granola bar that I look for. I order these from Amazon, and get the 12 pack of 6 count boxes. It's hard to find just the single flavor in the grocery store - they stock the variety packs, which are okay. But, the vanilla are best! And, Amazon provides the perfect way to buy these. They definitely rate 5+ stars!  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMM9X0">Nature Valley Chewy Granola Bars, Vanilla Yogurt, 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: McCormick Seasoned Meat Tenderizer a great product that is becoming hard to find.
review/text: McCormick Seasoned Meat Tenderizer is one of the best meat tenderizers on the market. It has been around for countless years but as of late is becoming increasingly harder to find. It has many uses when cooking on the B.B.Q.! It is a key ingredient for making my meat come out great. I am constantly being asked by my friends and family why does my meat always come out so tasty. I tell them I always use McCormick Seasoned Meat Tenderizer. I have tried other brands but with much less stellar results.<br />There is a special taste that is created by the use of McCormick Seasoned Meat Tenderizer. The key to success is to allow the meat to rise to room temperature then apply the tenderizer to both sides of the meat at least 20 minutes prior to grilling. You can either rub it on or sprinkle it on the meat and pierce with a fork like tenderizing it. I also like to add fresh cracked pepper and other spices then grill it to desired wellness.<br />Another great use for McCormick Seasoned Meat Tenderizer is with B.B.Q. corn. My technique requires the following: 1/4 teaspoon or less McCormick Seasoned Meat Tenderizer, a pat of butter (cut size to taste), aluminum foil and a fresh ear of shucked corn. First tear a strip of aluminum foil long enough to wrap the corn at least two times around. Next cut the pat of butter and place it at the end of the strip of foil. Then sprinkle the McCormick Seasoned Meat Tenderizer over the butter. Finally take the freshly washed still dripping corn and place on top of the butter pat with tenderizer and roll up in the foil. Twist the ends shut and your are ready to B.B.Q. the corn. It is very important the corn be dripping wet. It is the moisture of the corn plus the little bit left from washing and butter that steams the corn as it cooks on the B.B.Q. I usually cook the corn turning every few minutes at least 5 to 10 minutes. You want to hear it sizzle as your turn it. It can burn so don't forget to turn if frequently. Be careful as you open the foil is is steaming hot and can burn!<br />This method also works well for mushrooms, peppers and cut zucchini.<br />Please ask your grocer or other shopping source to stock McCormick Seasoned Meat Tenderizer it is a really great product that there is truly not a good substitute for the unique taste it creates. It has been becoming increasingly more difficult to find lately so please ask of it.

review/summary: Not as good as I thought, nor a good value.
review/text: Some of these just tasted outright bad.  Bad.  Only the strawberry flavor is good.  And at $47, I felt ripped off.  Not as fun as it looks to try these foods.  The majority of these do not taste sweet.  Some taste weird, and unpleasant.  Some taste like raisins.  Even the Melon flavor was not as good as it seemed.

review/summary: A rare and tasty organic treat
review/text: Nocella's ingredients are very simple: hazelnuts, honey, and cocoa powder, all organic.  It tastes very good and is not overly sweet like many other "hazelnut" spreads.  The jar is not big, but it can last a while if you use it to augment another spread, such as almond or peanut butter.

review/summary: Nocella  - Delicious
review/text: I bought 5 jars of NOCELLA Organic Hazelnut Spread to give as gifts but have decided I can't part with it.  Delicious stuff.  It takes a while to get it stirred to the proper consistency, but once it's stirred, it stays stirred.  Great drizzled on fruit, stirred in milk, on toast, or just eaten off a spoon or a finger.

review/summary: For Tangerine Lovers
review/text: I purchased this product from a local chef in Florida. It is worth every penny if you are a tangerine lover!  No artificial taste, etc. -- just pure oil and fruit.  It is fabulous by itself, drizzled over mixed baby greens or spinach.  Throw on some great cheese crumbles and nuts, and "Viola!" salad extraordinaire.

review/summary: Favorite soy sauce.
review/text: My go to soy sauces are those made by Sempio. I love the balanced, deep and clean flavors of Sempio's charcoal filtered soy sauces. I particularly enjoy the taste that the charcoal filtered soy sauce for soup brings to dishes. It has the perfect balance of saltiness&#65279; and depth for both light broths and hearty stews.

review/summary: Superior flavor, not as salty
review/text: This is my favorite by far in soy sauces with a rich depth of flavor. Many soy sauces have a basic Salty flavor but 501s has really good flavor. There is a slight anise note and it Is a great flavor in my opinion. I only use this and mushroom soy sauce as regular soy sauce is just adding saltiness into whatever you use it on. I am glad i guinea pigged this from an asian market which unfortunately closed. Try this in place of your regular soy sauce. I use it in all my soy sauce applications with good results..
