review/summary: Too, too salty
review/text: I love the idea and was so excited to try these little nibbles that I dismissed the reviews that said they were too salty.  I purchased the Wisconsin Cheddar, and I couldn't even eat all of one of the little bags, it was such an OD of sodium that I literally made a pucker face.  I'm not shy about salt, but these are pretty much unpalatable...and I have 15 more packs!  Maybe the other flavors don't taste as salty, but buyer beware.

review/summary: Pretty Good
review/text: We ordererd Just the Cheese Crispy Cool Ranch Cheese snacks. They arrived on time and we tried them the next day. Finding snacks that you can incorporate into a low carb diet is difficult sometimes. This is a very good low carbohydrate snack. These have No MSG, wheat and are gluten free as well. They would be good for any type of diet. Only 75 calories and 1/2 carb per serving. They taste quite good. I've made cheese chips at home and these taste very much like them. We are looking forward to trying another flavor next time.

review/text: These are OK. Not great, not horrible.<br /><br />I am doing low carb and was looking for a good snack.  These are definitely not worth the cost for the tiny little serving, plus it is pretty easy to make something similar yourself.  So, I will not be buying again unless they are significantly discounted, say around 50 cents or less a serving.

I've tried both the white cheddar and ranch flavors and thought they were good. If you are missing chips, these are great substitutes.

review/summary: I love them, Great Low Carb Snack
review/text: When I ordered was somewhat nervous, because of other ratings that were negative.  So relieved when they got here and I tried them.  They taste like oven baked cheddar bites-which I really like.  If you ordered them thinking they were going to be exactly like potato chips, you would be disappointed.  I have been on a low carb diet since Feb now and look for snack type items, with crunchy being a big plus-these are very tasty and I will definitely be getting them again.  (as well as trying some of the other flavors!)  They are salty, which I like.  I have to disclose however that my DH is not as happy with them as I am -we do have a tendancy to like opposite flavors.  So for me that just means more for my lunch pail.  But if you are like me and scrape the cheese off the cookie sheet when your baking has some overflow-you will probably really like these.  Only rated them 4 star because of DH -who still ate them by the by and said he would rate them as ok, so since I would say 5 star.  Compromise, right?

review/summary: They are a great crunchy, salty, low carb snack!
review/text: These things are great if you're on a low carb diet, and I find them really satisfying.  If you're looking for some kind of gourmet cheese item, this isn't it; its a potato chip replacement that's more about crunch and a salty, tangy taste to satisfy an urge. However, I personally would eat them even if I wasn't on a diet! As for the amounts; each bag is only 75 calories!  So if you really want more, then open another one, but when you're on a diet, usually just one does the trick (see "urges" above)! They are more expensive than potato chips, but at less than a dollar a bag, you could do a whole lot worse! I've only had the "classic white cheddar" flavor and am trying a new flavor this week.  I'll let you know how it goes.

review/summary: OK as a low carb treat
review/text: I have had some of the other cheese snacks, and liked the nacho flavored.  If you have not had these before, they are literally cheese formed into a small disk and baked until hard like a cracker.  Being a low carb guy, I like them because they are easy to pack along, and are reminiscent of the crunch you get from crackers.  This particular flavor though, is underwhelming, there is not enough jalapeno flavor, and the whole thing tastes a bit like bland cheese.  Still, they are ok, and I will eat them, but not as tasty as some of the other offerings.....

review/text: This is bar far the best soda I have ever had! I've tasted all of the Sprecher flavors and I haven't been disappointed by any of them. The low-cal root beer doesn't have the overpowering taste of aspartame like most diet sodas, and every one has a very thick, and potent flavor that makes one taste buds yell "YUMMY!". Once you taste any of the Sprecher flavors other sodas (i.e. Pepsi, Coke, A&W, Orange Crush, etc.) just taste like fizzy sugar water in comparison. It's expensive but worth every penny.

Well now I can't get rid of it, my husband and I don't like it, my kids don't like it. I tried giving it to all our family members, none would take it. It does not taste like caramel apples, just like artificial sweetener. I normally like things sweetened with splenda and don't really notice anything weird. I can't even eat this, no caramel flavor at all, the cooked popcorn looks nothing like the picture on the box. Don't waste your money on this...

The caloric count is quite low compared to other snacks, and the flavour is more interesting than just bland air-popped corn. Of course, I wish it had more flavour, but I will sacrifice intense flavour, which others offer mostly from fatty ingredients, for a heathy alternative to other snack foods.

review/text: This is a very weird flavored popcorn.  It doesn't taste to me like caramel or apple, just odd flavored.  If it came in a mini bag (so it would be worth 1 point in the Weight Watcher scheme) I would buy it again, but when I pop a bag I eat the whole thing, and then it jumps to 5 points.  It is definitely not worth using up 5 points on.  The healthy pop kettle corn and healthy pop butter flavor will stay on my shopping list, but this flavor is not one I plan to order again (unless they switch to mini bags).  Also, like another review said, it does put out a noxious puff of fumes when I open the bag.

review/summary: Nasty chemical fumes make my eyes water . . .
review/text: I really hate leaving a negative review for this product, especially in light of so many positive ones.  I really had high hopes for this product, especially since I had to buy a whole case of it in order to try it, because it is not sold in individual boxes in any store near me.  But, upon popping this popcorn at work, the first thing I noticed was that the smell is extremely strong, and it permeated the whole office (which is quite large) and many people objected to the "chemically" smell of this popcorn.  When I open the bag, there are fumes that come out at first that actually make my eyes water, they are that chemically and so strong.  However, I personally felt that the taste of this popcorn was okay -- not good or great, just okay.  I much prefer the Jolly Time Kettle Corn flavor.  The smell of this popcorn bothered my coworkers so much that someone actually put an anonymous sign on the microwave asking people (me) NOT to pop popcorn in it anymore.  And the smell permeated the microwave literally for DAYS, coming back just as strong when anyone cooked ANYTHING in the microwave!  I am on Weight Watchers and since I bought a whole case of this, I tried bringing a bag to an office party one day to snack on myself instead of the cakes and cookies everyone else was having, and they actually made me LEAVE the party!<br /><br />So, if you don't mind being a social outcast, or having people criticize you for putting all those "nasty chemicals" in your body, or if you plan to eat this in the privacy of your own home -- then by all means, enjoy!  Otherwise, I'd recommend you think twice about buying it.  The price here is great -- but it's just not worth it . . .

review/summary: so so
review/text: i was looking forward to this popcorn. it was so so... it smells delicious when it's cooking. and some pieces (the ones with more flavor on them) are good but in general not sure if i would buy this again. but it is a nice change from the regular butter flavor and it's nice that it is a healthy pop flavor.

review/summary: Gross!
review/text: This flavor is terrible.  I was expecting a sweet-salty combo similar to kettle corn.  With a name like Caramel Apple, I would think there would be a sweet flavor in there somewhere, but their isn't.  It smells great while popping and the house smells like carmel apple afterwards, but you don't get that flavor while eating the stuff.  It was like eating an off version of buttery popcorn.  I won't be buying this flavor again and now have to figure out what to do with the rest of the huge box I ordered!

review/text: I have been looking for this product everywhere but could not find it so finally ordered it off of Amazon.  I actually really like this popcorn!  I definitely taste the caramel apple flavor!  I am on Weight Watchers so its a yummy sweet/salty treat!  My only complaint is that I wish it came in the mini bag instead of the regular size bag because when it comes to counting points I have to measure out my serving size and save the rest.  Great product I think!  Yummy flavor!

review/summary: Jolly Time Healthy Pop Caramel Apple Popcorn
review/text: I took a chance on this flavor, because I had contacted you to order the Healthy Pop kettle corn flavor.<br /><br />I ordered a case of each .  I tried the caramel apple first.  I LOVED IT!!!!  I'm on the last two boxes now.<br /><br />When I finish the last 2 boxes, I will start eating the kettle corn case.  But when I finish them, I want to set it up that I receive a case of the Caramel Apple every month.<br /><br />It has small bits of apple and caramel that adhere to the popcorn that add flavor and a little extra crunch.  I can taste both the apple and the caramel.<br /><br />Whoever came up with this flavor - BRAVO TO YOU!  Why isn't it in the stores yet?

review/text: I bought this as a gift for a friend. She loved it especially because she loves the original Hershey's kisses. It just looks like a nice small gift and can combines well with anything. Personally, I would rather not receive this gift as it's pretty hard to eat. Either you have to saw at it (which makes a mess) or you just gnaw on it (not attractive). If there's a practical way to consume this piece of chocolate I have not found it.

review/text: I am used to drinking Alpine spiced apple cider. I decided to try this out b/c it comes in a can and I thought it would be less time consuming than opening up little packages all the time. Although this was much more convenient, it tastes wretched. I could tell once I opened the can that this was going to taste very artificial and it sure did. It also doesn't have vitamin C like other cider mixes do. I don't recommend this product, especially if you are used to drinking the Alpine brand.

review/summary: My son's favorite flavor!
review/text: It seems every baby company has these pouches these days but no one has them that include SALBA, which is a super-grain that is so nutritious and good for brain development.  I know I'm not alone in having a picky toddler (2 1/2) and struggles to get fruits and esp. veggies in him.  This is a perfect way and the there is never any forcing!  He goes crazy for this flavor with the strawberry, kiwi, beet (how else would a 2 year old eat beets??) and pear.<br />I love to freeze them at night and use as a "slushy" the next day as a pool snack!

We like to use these pouches in popsicle molds in the summer - yum!

review/text: We just received our shipment of these today and between my school age daughter, toddler son, and myself they are almost already gone!!! I love that they contain the fruits but also sneak in a vegetable(beets) that my picky eaters would never have touched otherwise!! Stacked up against all other organic toddler pouches these are by far the healthier option for my children. They contain the Salba to help get the Omega-3s in and also Choline which I have been reading so much about it's health benefits lately. I believe that this company stays in front of the curve when it comes to providing optimal, organic nutrition and for that reason my family has become loyal customers.

I love that there are beets, strawberries, kiwi and pear!  Having these organic pouches handy have been a life saver this summer. I keep them in the pantry and the freezer (great cold treat on hot days).  I love that it is organic.  Buying all these organic fruits and veggies individually would be a fortune.  I love that my toddler can enjoy organic fruit and veggies with the convenience of a baby food pouch.

The texture is smoother (not grainy), and they feel so light and refreshing. I stick ours in the fridge and they have been a wonderful snack (sometimes breakfast & lunch)all summer. I love how everything is organic and they added the super grain SALBA (from the white chia seed). We cannot get enough of these...off to eat a Tot's PLUS ;)

The manufacturer needs to discard their products when they get old, instead of dumping them here at Amazon. They are an absolute disappointment. I will never ever order another Harika product again.

I have seen my grandma make these but I never saw her add any of the above ingredients.

review/summary: Good food for allergic dogs
review/text: Last August we brought home a lhasa apso mix from a local shelter. He was a mess with shaggy, unkept fur and after we had him groomed, we discovered he was covered in scabs and hives. Several visits to the vet didn't get us any closer to figuring out what was causing the hives, but we thought it might be related to the food he was eating. We tried several different brands, from Eukanuba to Science Diet, but they all contained corn/grains, and the hives continued to get worse.<br /><br />Then we switched to a raw food diet, which immediately cured the hives and itchiness.  But raw food isn't practical when you're away from home frequently, like we are. Plus, I'm not convinced that a raw food diet gives my dogs all the nutrients they need to stay healthy.<br /><br />So we tried several different grain free brands and finally settled on the Blue Buffalo Wilderness Grain Free dry dog food. He loves it and he's been hives free for several months now.  We switch between the salmon and duck formulas.  An 11-pound bag lasts my two little dogs about a month.  Another nice side effect is that they smell better and their skin/coats are healthier.  My 11-year old chiweenie has more energy than she's had in a few years. Oh...and no more diarrhea or constipation - just nice, little turds that are easy to clean up.<br /><br />The price on Amazon is the same as what I'd pay at the local pet store and the shipping is free.  Saves me the price of gas driving to the store and lugging it home. I would highly recommend this dog food to anyone whose dog has itchy/smelly/scabby skin problems.

review/summary: Terrific product - may be better than Epigen
review/text: I do an enormous amount of research before buying a kibble.  I have used other BB kibble formulas in the past and was very pleased.  Due to my dog becoming elderly I decided to switch to a kibble with an even lower phosphorous percentage (reducing load on the kidneys) than the BB Senior which is about .8%.  While BB does have a much lower phosphorous content than many kibbles I wanted something very low and Epigen (Wysong) is a low as it gets while maintaining a very high protein content from good quality meat sources.  Be aware that regulations only require the manufacturer to list the minimum amount of phosphorous and not the maximum.  One has to write the manufacturer to obtain that data.<br /><br />So after months of research I bought some Epigen which is grain free, high protein, quality protein and starch free.  Eqigen has some patented process that removed the carbohydrates that I can't explain.  Eqipgen is 60% protein which is very high, but then older dogs need a good amount of protein that is easy is assimilate due to having reduced stomach acids.<br /><br />But I wanted something to rotate with the Epigen that was not quite as high in protein and started reading about BB new Wilderness formula with a protein of about 47%.  Since the fiber content of the Wilderness is higher than Epigen the stools improved immediately.  I frankly don't know whether the Life Bits are credible or not, but the food is very good quality.  While neither product is as good as home made and/or the raw or BARF diet, these are both very fine kibbles.  Based on the improved stools I think I prefer that Wilderness over the Epigen and the later is more expensive.  Neither are cheap products.  Too both I've often added vegetables from SOJOs or canned tripe.  Tripe is the lowest phosphorous meat there is and Solid Gold make as good one canned if you chose not to order frozen, ground tripe.<br /><br />As my dog ages further (now 11.5) I may have to give up kibble and move to frozen, ground tripe to continue to keep kidney disease from happening.  Since the huge increase of kidney issues in dogs appears to correlate with the advent of dry kibble, finding one that is low in phosphorous is, in my opinion, something of great importance.  And since dogs of GSD or Malinois size (med to large) reach senior status at around 5 years of age, the handler should start being concerned about diet and phosphorous at that age.  I train dogs in advanced obedience and K9 work and have seen how diet affects not only performance but health and longevity.  If you love your dog and wish it not to become ill from kidney disease please don't feed your dog crap from the super market.  You may think you are saving money, and yes dogs will eat just about anything because they are adaptive animals.  But a poor diet will catch up with you via medical bills eventually.

review/summary: No more bladder stones.....so far
review/text: After two bladder stone surgeries one of the sales reps from Blue Buffalo recommended this for me when I went to Pet Smart looking for another brand of grain free dog food. My vet is working with me on a "preventative" program feeding my dog good dog food rather than that stuff they usually recommend after struvite stones and so far so good.  My dog also loves it.  She gets the kibble in the morning and canned in the evening to which I add whatever vegetables I have left over.  It keeps her PH around 6.25 to 6.50 which is perfect to prevent infection which is the true cause of bladder stones.

He will even eat it straight without any water on it (the last food we tried he wouldn't eat it without water on it).

review/summary: Grain allergic pup.
review/text: I have a pup (8lb poodle) who is allergic to grains. After going to the vet for 5 different and expensive foods, cortisone shots, benadryl and an expensive allergy test recommendation over the course of 1.5 years... I gave up. I eat grain free (primal woot), and after some research I discovered that it would be an appropriate diet for my pup too. So at the young age of 9, we made the change. AMAZING. I started her on this kibble and ALL her red, bleeding, bare rashes disappeared. In about 2 weeks. It was miraculous. That was 2 years ago, and people think she is a puppy still. She is 11 now! I also now give her raw beef ribs so she can gnaw the meat off and she also gets raw chicken wings to eat whole too. Sometimes a raw egg yolk. These are about 1-2x/week, with BB as the mainstay. Her fave is the salmon, but she likes them all. I credit primal living for the research, but this food for delivering. I will only feed her this food, and any future pup that may come along will get the same. BB, you have a life customer!<br /><br />*If you are looking for something to help your aging pup's joints (mine has arthritic shoulders), I recommend Glyco-Flex III. It made a difference in about 3 days! We now do our sprints in the grass together and she is as young as ever!

review/text: I have a Chow Chow with skin allergies and food sensitivities. She always gets premium kibble, raw isn't practical for us. She is quite finicky about her food, rarely emptying the bowl in twenty four hours. With this food, she rushes into her crate and eats up every bite in five minutes. I highly recommend Blue Buffalo for cats as well. My Ragdolls have had no digestive troubles since switching to Blue Buffalo.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003J1RRV2">Blue Buffalo Wilderness Grain Free Dry Cat Food, Salmon Recipe, 11-Pound Bag</a>

review/text: My young Boxer likes this food better than any I have tried so far. Very expensive and I don`t see it being a whole lot better than a comparable one with same ingredients. Our pets know what they like far better than we do. Not saying it is a bad product by any means. To me, the price and likeability to my dog, doesn`t jutisfy the price. I also m not so sure animals don`t need grain or such as they will eat many organic things such as grass, flowers, weeds, shrubs, tree leaves etc. At least mine does. She tears my greenery up and chews on it and brings it in the house more so for reasons othan than just eating it.

review/summary: Great Dog Food
review/text: I have searched for a very long time to find the perfect food for my dog.<br />Fortunately, my dog has a pretty strong tummy, and changing his food with different brands was never a problem.<br /><br />I finally found great reviews about this Blue Buffalo Wilderness and decided to try it.<br />So far my dog loves it. I like how the bigger packages are more affordable (than buying them in small packages, as I used to do) and have different flavors, so I can switch between them. It is considerably a little pricier than most other brands, but it's worth buying a higher quality food with a little bit of extra money.<br /><br />It is also much less oilier than some of the dog foods I have tried before (and those supposedly are also good brands). And I love the fact that it doesn't have much dregs when it gets to the end. I have had experience with food that, at the end, it's basically all dregs, which is annoying and makes you wonder what type of crappy food is it made of~~~~~ ::shrugs::

review/summary: AMAZING! FOOD! CAN'T HELP BUT SHARE WITH OTHER PET OWNERS!
review/text: Ever since our 2 mini poodles and 2 Maltipoo came in to our household they stole our hearts and became a part of our family. The hunt for the right food came when I heard countless horror stories from friends and family on how leading brand name foods affected and even caused the death of their pets. We all know how costly vet bills can me and because of this reason I believe that being proactive and taking preventive care will be a lot cheaper in the long run. Certain grains and corn are not a natural part of a dogs diet and as you know most or all advertised brands use that as one of their main ingredients. What i love this brand is that it doesnt skimp on any of the right ingredients and makes meat/poultry/etc. (depending on the flavor you buy) the main ingredient! this is awesome because there really isnt any other brand out there that is true to their pet owners and their pets! This manufacturer makes me feel like they actually care and thus they will get my money for their 1 of a kind and amazing food! My dogs love it, they have beautiful coats, they are energetic and healthy all around. Been using this for about 3 years now and will continue to do so. This is our households choice of food- the right food.

review/summary: Tasty Healthy Snack
review/text: This was a big hit with our company that came to visit this summer.  I had 6 weeks of family and friends and wanted to have tasty, healthy snacks to offer adults and kids alike.<br /><br />The Amazon reviews of this cherry are what tempted me to order.  Along with the health benefits that the packaging mentions, these are really great cherries.  They are large and moist but not wet.  They look appealing to the eye.  They are like no other dried cherry I've had.  They are a little bit tart but still sweet. Very satisfying as a snack.<br /><br />I've never bought other cherry products because it isn't my family's preference but these were a big hit with everyone who tried them.  Even those who didn't like cherries enjoyed these.<br /><br />I find them to be a nice change from the large raisins I normally buy.  They make a great mix-in to hot oatmeal, trail mix, granola, oatmeal chocolate chip cookies, and scones.  I set them out with nuts, fruit, and cheese for an appetizer before a family dinner.  Everyone who has tried them has been pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I'll be ordering more.

According to Eden's website, their dried montmorency cherries are gluten-free, wheat-free, fat-free, and very low sodium.

GLUTEN-FREE<br /><br />I just love adding these cherries to everything including pancakes, brownies, green bean almondine, etc.  You can substitute these tart cherries for cranberries in just about any recipe!  These dried montmorency cherries by Eden are THE BEST!<br /><br />The Remarkable Health Benefits of Cherries...<br /><br />Acute inflammation is part of the body's protective response to injuries, infections and other irritants, but long-term low grade inflammation puts you at risk of serious conditions like heart disease and diabetes.<br /><br />Tart Cherries' amazing potential to lower disease risk<br /><br />Now, new research, reported on at the Experimental Biology annual meeting in California, adds even more evidence to support cherries ability to alleviate inflammation.<br /><br />In one study, 10 overweight or obese men and women were provided with 8 ounces of tart cherry juice or a placebo beverage daily for four weeks. The results were encouraging. Participants, drinking the cherry juice, showed significant reductions in known markers of inflammation and lower levels of triglycerides (blood fats) and LDL cholesterol -- both known risk factors for heart disease.<br /><br />Researcher, Dr. Mitch Seymour, who led an animal study at the University of Michigan, in which tart cherries were again found to lower inflammation, said: "Chronic inflammation is a whole body condition that can affect overall health, especially when it comes to the heart. This study offers further promise that foods rich in antioxidants, such as cherries, could potentially reduce inflammation and have the potential to lower disease risk."<br /><br />To start with, tart cherries can aid muscle recovery following exercise. A study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine revealed that strength loss and pain following exercise were significantly less in the cherry juice trial compared to the placebo trial. Most notably, strength loss averaged over the four days after exercise was 22 per cent with the placebo but only 4 per cent with the cherry juice-drinkers.<br /><br />Several earlier studies have confirmed that tart cherries offer benefits for patients with autoimmune, neurodegenerative and connective tissue diseases, particularly rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes. Studies show that tart cherries not only reduce pain and inflammation but also offer protection against cancer. These effects are attributed to the high amounts of plant phytochemicals, known as anthocyanins, they contain.<br /><br />Research has shown that a diet containing cherries is beneficial in reducing the risk of colon cancer. When researchers fed a diet containing tart cherries, anthocyanins, or cyanidin (a non-sugar breakdown product of anthocyanins) to mice with a genetic susceptibility to colon cancer, the animals developed significantly fewer and smaller colon tumours. This study also revealed that these compounds effectively reduced the growth of two human colon cancer cell lines.<br /><br />The cancer-protective benefits of this fruit were validated in another experimental study, in which cherry fruit extract reduced the growth of both human colon cancer cells and human breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent fashion.<br /><br />Researchers have suggested that a possible mechanism by which cherries may confer these benefits is through shutting down the growth of cancer cells by depriving them of the proteins they need to grow.<br /><br />Supporting melatonin levels and brain health<br /><br />Tart cherries are one of the few food sources of melatonin, a chemical released in the body by the pineal gland that is closely connected with the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. Melatonin also acts as a powerful antioxidant, providing neuro-protective and immune-modulating effects.<br /><br />Ongoing scientific studies are demonstrating how foods naturally rich in melatonin - like Montmorency cherries - can help sufferers of insomnia gain deep, restful sleep.<br /><br />Tart cherries are also rich in phenolic compounds, which have strong neuro-protective activity. In a laboratory setting, cherry phenolics protected neuronal cells from cell-damaging oxidative stress in a dose-dependent manner. Tart cherry compounds may therefore play an important role in protecting ageing adults against neurodegenerative conditions such as memory loss, senile dementia, and perhaps even Alzheimer's disease.<br /><br />Give it to me!<br /><br />Why do people use tart cherries and tart cherry juice?<br />Both sweet and tart cherries and cherry juice have long been used by traditional healers as a folk remedy for gout, because cherries are thought to lower urate levels in the body.<br /><br />Tart cherries are used for conditions involving inflammation and pain, such as:<br /><br />  * arthritis<br />  * gout<br />  * muscle pain<br />  * back pain<br />  * diabetes<br />  * neurodegenerative diseases<br /><br />Both sweet and tart cherries contain phenolics, naturally-occurring plant compounds that have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant effects.<br /><br />The main type of phenolic in cherries is called anthocyanins. In general, the darker the cherry color, the higher the anthocyanin content.<br /><br />Anthocyanins have been found to block two enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2, which play a role in the production of inflammatory compounds called prostaglandins. Aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as naproxen and ibuprofen also work this way.<br /><br />In test tube studies, cherry anthocyanins have been found to protect neurons from damage by oxidative stress. However, there have been no studies that have looked at whether cherry extracts could prevent or slow the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease in humans.<br /><br />Both Balaton and Montmorency tart cherries contain relatively high levels of the antioxidant melatonin compared to other foods. Montmorency cherries contain approximately 6 times more melatonin than do Balaton cherries.<br /><br />Are tart cherries more effective than sweet cherries?<br />Generally, tart cherries have been found to have higher concentrations of phenolics and anthocyanins than sweet cherries.<br /><br />Tart cherries are also slightly lower in sugar. Half a cup of sweet cherries contains 9.3 g of sugar and 46 calories, compared to 6.6 g of sugar and 39 calories in tart cherries.<br /><br />However, there is no real evidence that these differences are significant-both types of cherries are very high in anthocyanins compared with other foods.<br /><br />It may be that we are hearing more about the health benefits of tart cherries because of the way they are marketed. In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration sent warning letters to 29 cherry farmers and distributors for positioning tart cherries on their websites as a medicinal food that could possibly help people with gout, arthritis, diabetes, and prevent cancer.<br /><br />What research has been done on tart cherries?<br />Although anthocyanins, which are also found in blueberries and other purplish-red fruits and vegetables, are known to be powerful antioxidants, no studies have looked at whether cherries--tart or sweet--can relieve symptoms of arthritis, gout, or diabetes outside the lab.<br /><br />All studies involving cherries have been very small, so we'll have to wait to see whether tart cherries are beneficial and in what quantities. In the meantime, here are a few of the studies that have been conducted so far:<br /><br />  * A small randomized controlled trial in the British Journal of Sports Medicine examined the effectiveness of a tart cherry juice blend in preventing symptoms of exercise-induced muscle damage. Fourteen male college students drank 12 fl oz of a cherry juice blend or a placebo, twice per day for eight consecutive days. Strength loss was significantly lower in people taking the cherry juice (4%) compared with the placebo (22%). Pain was also significantly lower in people taking the cherry juice.<br /><br />  * Jill M. Tall, Ph.D., research fellow at Johns Hopkins, was the lead researcher of a study that tested the effectiveness of orally administrated anthocyanins from tart cherries on inflammation-induced pain in rats. The results of the study suggested that tart cherry anthocyanins may have a beneficial role in reducing inflammatory pain.<br /><br />  * One small study published in the Journal of Nutrition supported the anti-gout effectiveness of cherries. assessed the effects of Bing cherry (a sweet cherry) consumption on healthy women and found that cherry consumption decreased blood urate levels, and there was a marginal decrease in inflammatory markers c-reactive protein and nitric oxide.

review/summary: NOT ORGANIC CHERRIES, FALSE CLAIMS
review/text: This is what the Ingredient lists says:  Montmorency Tart Cherries, Organic Apple Juice Concentrate, Organic Safflower Oil.  I ORDERED Organic Cherries, but did not receive organic cherries.  I am extremely unhappy about this, as this is a pricy item.<br /><br />The package claims they are "transitional to organic."

review/summary: Amazing doesn't even begin to describe these
review/text: So, so, SO incredibly good. I got a subscription for these, thinking I'd order them every 3 or 4 months. Three weeks later we were out and I ordered another batch of three. These are seriously amazing. One of my kids (age 4) who refuses almost all but the most common fruits tried these and now asks for these every day :) If you're on the fence about trying these ... trust me you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: These are a great balance between the sweetness of the juice, to the tartness of the montmorency cherries, they taste just like the cherries in a cherry pie.<br /><br />Also, before people go and start to bad mouth these because they are 'transitional to organic'....maybe they should know just what that term means instead of jumping off the gun and starting with the cherries are not organic crap.

review/summary: A+++ SUPER Excellent.  2 for the Bucket List.
review/text: Wow, these are great.  They are not expensive because you can use a few with some raisins and their other Eden Dried Cranberries, Organic, 4.0-Ounce Pouch (Pack of 6) which are also four stars.  Incredible taste and nutrition!  Remember to read your labels, folks:  the dried cranberries in the stores have a lot of white sugar or fructose while all the Eden dried fruits are sweetened with fruit juice.

review/text: Purchasing these, I was expecting dried tart cherries. Rather, they are soft plum-like dried cherries and are almost wet in comparison to other type available.

review/summary: Excellent product!
review/text: I have been reading about the healthy properties of cherries and since fresh cherries are only in season for a short time, there are a great alternative.  They taste great and you don't need a lot to enjoy the benefits, plus they come in a sturdy resealable pack so they are great to take with you for a snack at any time.

review/summary: Simply the best (organic) dried cherries!
review/text: I recently became obsessed with dried cherries. I've tried a few no-sugar brands, and Eden's are by far the best. They're transitional-to-organic, meaning they will be USDA certified organic and they are currently using organic growing practices. They're lightly sweet thanks to organic apple juice, and yet they're lightly tart with a lot of cherry flavor. They're a beautiful red color and somehow despite being dried are still quite plump and almost juicy! They always taste so fresh and are lightly chewy. I tried Bare Fruit and another brand that was in the bulk section of Whole Foods, and both of those were more like raisins and had unpleasant aftertastes. I can sit and eat an entire bag of Eden's dried cherries, it's almost like eating a fresh cherry pie! And the light oil helps make these so they don't stick together which is nice. They're my new favorite snack and dessert, I choose these over even chocolate! They're $6.99 for a 4oz pack in Whole Foods, so I've been getting them on Amazon's subscribe and save for about $4.73 per 4oz pack. I wish they'd do case discounts, I LOVE these cherries!!!

review/summary: Excellent tart cherries
review/text: Not a problem that they aren't 100% organic for me (it seems a blend of organic and non-organic, probably different sources).  They're not noted as organic anywhere on the packaging.  These are some of the tastiest cherries you can get if you like a little pucker.  If only they weren't so expensive!  Also the ingredients list (reason I bought these really) is great, 3 items, that's it. No added sugar!

review/summary: Simply Delicious
review/text: I love dried fruit and especially now dried cherries.  This product is what converted me to dry cherries: tart, tasty and simply delicious!  It seems a bit expensive but it is really worth it at the cost of a grande coffee or larger in some countries.
