review/summary: LOVE THIS BABY FOOD- BEST AVAILABLE
review/text: I love Earth's Best baby food. As a mom, there is nothing better than knowing you are giving your child the best start in life by using Earth's Best. I tried making my own organic baby food, but this ended up costing the same with no work involved! The best deals are using Amazon Mom or waiting for the "stock up and save" at Babies R Us (usually 20 for $10). Its hard to beat those prices. My little one loves all three flavors here as well as the fruits that are available. Would definitely recommend!

review/summary: How to keep the jars from breaking
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 0:32 Mins<br /><br /></span>This video demonstrates how to apply a Siliskin to a glass baby food jar.  These Siliskins are designed to fit a variety of glass baby food jars and protect the glass while traveling or storing.  The Siliskin protects the glass jar against dings and bumps while in the diaper bag or tote as well as giving added protection against occasional drops.  The Siliskins can be reused over and over again and are dishwasher, freezer and microwave safe.  Siliskins are also non-toxic and BPA free.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CVKAI0">Silikids Siliskins for Glass Baby Food Jars, Aqua/White, 2 Pack</a>

review/summary: Quality baby food for a decent price
review/text: I make a lot of my son's baby food myself, but sometimes you don't have time to defrost frozen baby food or for daycare that won't feed homemade baby food.  I never thought I'd be buying organic baby food, but then my son was born and I decided that I couldn't bear the thought of feeding him anything with chemicals that might affect his developing system.  I also didn't want to pay too much.  Thank goodness for Amazon Mom (I can't say enough good things about this program) and the 15% discount from subscribing.  Turns out this baby food actually costs less then some of the regular brands at our local stores.  My son eats them up like crazy and I've tasted them too...they're good!

review/text: Great, healthy product! The consistency is perfect and easy for my 6-month old to swallow.<br /><br />With 12 jars (3 each: carrots, sweet potato, and peas), I find myself making trips to the store for other veggies, like squash and spinach-  a challenging task depending on your location, wheather conditions, and number of multiples.  I would prefer a different variety...<br /><br />:)

My son loves the sweet potatoes and carrots (the peas aren't a hit yet). Amazon.com's subscribe and save offers the food at a great price much cheaper than Target and Babies "R" Us. Great packaging (no broken jars during shipment) and speedy delivery!

review/text: Love Earth's Best baby foods and this was great to start with a variety of foods. Only complaint is some of the fruits have Vit. C added as a perservative and makes a little on the tart side but I still prefer this over artificial preservatives and/or added sugars.<br />Ordering from Amazon.com is WAY cheaper per jar of food than our local stores.  They were also great at quickly replacing some food that had been poorly packed and broke during shipment.<br />I still use this size jar of foods for traveling.

review/text: FYI, because I have to carefully measure all of my baby's food out, I realized that there's really only 1.5 ounces of food in each jar.  Forget about the BPA baloney....they're ripping you off with a label that lies about how much food is in there.  Don't believe me?  Measure it yourself.  My baby likes this food, but it's way too expensive considering that they're not even putting the amount that they say they are in there!  I'm making my own!

review/summary: Great Food Great Price - Baby Asher Approved!
review/text: This is a great buy, great food, and my baby LOVES it! His eyes light up every time he gets this food and he giggles and smiles. I am not a die hard organic person, but I do buy organic cherries, and other soft fruit thing - don't buy organic bananas because the skins are so thick that it doesn't really matter, etc. Realistically the fact that there is BPA in the lids doesnt affect the food or the quality of it. BPA is an element in plastics that is excess estrogen and its recently become known that its not beneficial to let it enter our bodies. However, BPA is only activated once its been heated and since you arent heating the metal lid, the BPA never enters the food. EB baby food is spectacular especially since its jar food vs frozen/fresh. There are lots of yummy flavors and your baby will probably like most of them. Both of my sons go crazy over the EB varieties and I stick by it- buying it by the case and using the amazon subscription option makes it soo much cheaper than retail! Again... dont freak out over BPA in the lids. This is a great food, nutritious and my baby loves it. Best of all it doesn't have a bunch of hormones and chemicals in it. 5 stars!

And these less expensive treats may be made of meat-by-products (which includes just about anything) plenty of grains, and artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives.<br /><br />Nature's Treats are not perfect; ingredient four is pregelatinized corn, and number six is corn syrup. However, with chicken as the number one ingredient, I doubt you'll ever see these treats on the shelves of Wal-Mart or K-Mart. For the money these are a pretty good deal with about 50 sticks in the plastic tub.<br /><br />That our girls love these treats is the best endorsement I can give them.

review/summary: Best tasting, but...
review/text: Best tasting. Much better than cane sugar or honey, but It says in the label for this product that it has 0 carbs. I find this to be far fetched. Is there a way for the vendor to post the Nutritional information for this product here? How about ingredients, because it is known that some manufacturers mix this with cane sugar. Is this palm sugar 100% Palm / cane sugar or Palm sugar / Jaggery?

review/text: I discovered coconut M&M's in a prepackaged trailmix and have not been able to find them in the grocery stores.  I found on Amazon.  Well, M&M's may not melt in your hands, but they do melt in your mailbox when it's 96 degrees outside! I refrigerated them and I'm eating them in chunks now.  Still very good!

review/summary: Great price, BUT........
review/text: My dog loves bully sticks, so I decided to try this brand. He loved this one as well, however, he's an inside dog and the smell from these bully sticks is awfully strong and pungent. I don't want to let him chew on it outside, as the stick will definitely get dirty after he's chewed on it for awhile. In fairness, I'll let him finish this pack of sticks and see if I can adjust to the smell. Other than that, he seems to love this product as well and you can't beat the price. I've paid $7.49 for just one from Petco, but it was a different brand and didn't stink.<br />If you can get past the smell, then I'd recommend this product.

review/summary: Quality Product, Great Price
review/text: Item arrived today, unbelieveably fast delivery! Was very impressed with packaging. Each bully stick is indivdually wrapped with product info on tag. When I ordered them, the description did not specify what country they were made in so I was concerned because I absolutely refuse to feed my dogs anything made in China. The price however was so awesone, I decided to give them a try. Was very pleased to find they are made in Brazil. My dogs were going crazy for them before I could even get the wrapping off. As far as one reviewer stating the odor was strong, that is another reason I DID order them because the dogs LIKE the smelley things better where they will not touch products I have purchased in the past that were odor free. To me, the odor was not an issue. It was no stronger then the ones I have seeked out in local retail stores by sniffing each one before purchasing with the hopes my dogs would chew on them. I am enrolled in autoship and as long as the quality continues I will continue to purchase this product on a preselected schedule.<br /><br />2/17/2011 Update: Just received my autoship delivery today. Dogs love them just as much now as when we first ordered. Actually have doubled my autoship order because my mom's Weimer loves them too! Still highly recommend.

review/summary: Dogs Like Them But Misleading Picture:  Only 5 Pieces per Purchase
review/text: The description of this product reads "Ferrera Farms 12-Inch Regular Bully Stick, Cigar Banded, 5-Count", followed by another picture insert that reads "5 Pack".  All this is accompanied by a picture of a box full of bully sticks.  Call me stupid, but I read the description(s), looked at the picture and thought that I would be getting 5x5 (25 pieces) for my purchase, which seemed like a great deal. Unfortunately, when the product arrived there were only 5 pieces in total.<br /><br />On the upside, my 3 dogs did really seem to enjoy the sticks.  Unfortunately, they went through their respective bully sticks in about 15 minutes each.  This works out to a cost of 40 cents/minute.  Not such a great deal!

review/text: My American Bulldog puppy absolutely loved these bully sticks!  They are individually wrapped & very high quality.  One or two of the sticks did have a very strong smell but my dog seemed even more attracted to them since they smelled so strong.  The odor didn't really bother me like it did some of the other reviewers.  I was thrilled that my dog had something constructive to chew on & I will definitely buy these again!

review/summary: Dogs Love them, but not in my living room....
review/text: Let me start by saying, our dogs LOVE these!  The sticks were in their Christmas stockings, and even our older dog, who doesn't like to chew on anything (even food), LOVES these!!!  It kept our 4 month old puppy busy for hours Christmas morning while the kids were able to peacefully open their gifts!  That said, they smell.  The sticks have been in our house for 3 days now, and although it doesn't bother me too much, the rest of the family has decided these sticks will stay in the basement, where the dogs play when we are not home.  They are no longer allowed in our living room.<br /><br />The price is great, the sticks look like they'll last our 14 & 20 pound dogs a week or two each, and the dogs surely do love them.

Alas, my stock is gone and now I must search for it online. I presume the shipping costs from Australia contribute to making this pricey. It's a real treat, perhaps best saved for situations where the flavor is going to shine: dipping bread, drizzling on great tomatoes, etc.

review/summary: Tossing chili powder into vegetable soup doesn't make it chili.
review/text: I work at home, don't want to take the time to cook and don't care if my lunch leaves me glowing in the dark.<br /><br /> That side, I still want something tasty and satisfying for lunch.<br /><br /> I tried this new Progresso flavor and, overall, I am disappointed. Progresso soups are among my favorites, especially when I eat later in the day.<br /><br /> Usually Progresso soups are very good. Their chicken noodle is a perennial favorite of mine.<br /><br /> Three Bean Chili with Beef misses on a couple of points.<br /><br /> As a vegetable soup, it is fine. Lots of beans correctly cooked. The meat is plentiful and consists of tender little chunks. The broth, however, is thinner than I would like, but not every Progresso soup can be a stew in a can, no matter how much I wish otherwise.<br /><br /> What really comes up short in this one is the attempt to turn a good vegetable soup into chili. All Progresso did was dump a lot - too much, in fact - chili powder into the kettle.<br /><br /> No thanks, though if your tolerance and liking for chili powder is higher than mine, you might like it.<br /><br />Jerry

It is the type of food that tricks you into thinking you are eating something bad but really, you're not. Can't ask for more than that. Also, pay attention to the fact that one can is two servings. 280 calories per can, still not to shabby!

review/summary: If you doctor it up it's okay...
review/text: As people have pointed out, this is really more soup than it is chili. I've always considered Chili to be more like stew. Essentially, thick. This is very much watery. You can compensate for this by adding a bit of corn starch before you heat it up however. But... at the end of the day, you should not have to doctor up ready-to-eat soup to make it more like you like. Flavorwise, it has a rather strong chili flavor. To me, this is a good thing. I love chili. However, if you're not too much into it, this will be a bad product for you. This soup is nice if you want a fiber boost, but it's not really as satisfying as real chili.

You'ld pay about three times as much in a grocery store, easy.

review/summary: Progresso Must Have Cornered the Market on Chili Powder...
review/text: Progresso has always made some of my favorite soups.  Their numerous choices have provided a needed variety in my often soup-centric meals.  Some of their soups have a light broth, some are thicker, and some verge on being very stew-like.  However, lately I've noticed a marked tendency toward watering down their previously thicker soups such as Lentil and Beef Pot Roast.  Their Three-Bean Chili with Beef was created in this vein and the tomato-flavored broth is thin and watery.  In order to compensate, Progresso seems to have decided to overuse chili powder in any soup which has been tagged as Mexican or Southwestern in origin.  Thus, the sole flavor one was able to taste in this particular soup was chili powder.<br /><br />On the positive side, the beans are plentiful and well-cooked.  The beef was not fatty or grittle-laden, although it was not plentiful in the can I cooked.  There were a number of small tomato pieces and a bit of what appeared to be jalapeno peppers.  It would have been wonderful if these flavors had been melded into a more balanced tasting soup.<br /><br />It is because of Progresso's current overuse of chili powder - perhaps to mask the inadequacies in their newer soups - that I have rated this soup as a three-star product.

review/summary: For what it is,
review/text: first of all, you must accept this product for what it is. It is not fresh. It contains dried vegetables which have to be reconstituted.as you  eat the product, you are aware that it is reconstituted product, similar, I suspect, to things like the MRE or camping rations.<br /><br />Once you have come to terms what the product is, the taste is pretty good and it is a fairly good value for the money. It takes about 25 to 30 minutes to prepare, and the package in the extremely small print of the directions suggests adults writing the product with chicken or canned tomatoes or other things of a customer's choice. I think some chicken would be appropriate, although I don't see that adding canned tomatoes would improve things very much.<br /><br />Again I emphasize, recognize what you are eating. This is not an enchilada plate. This is dried product that must be reconstituted. But it doesn't taste bad.

review/text: After buying similar food markers from local stores to decorate cake pops (wasted $$ - I ended up piping black frosting to decorate), I was wary buying these. Since my initial purchase, I have since bought the multi-color set twice and these even more times than that! They really work!<br /><br />These markers decorate batches of cake pops without stopping. The other ones ... I could maybe finish two individual pops before the markers clogged up. I use three different brands of candy melts and have never had problems with any. A homeschool co-op class borrowed a set to decorate marshmallow Lego pops for a special treat, and they worked well for me after 15, 5-8 year olds used them (and not carefully - like any kid colors). Well worth the money!

review/summary: Awesome mustard with a cheesy taste
review/text: I am a big fan of Stonewall products and this one is one of my favorites.  They start with a very mild herb flavored Dijon, which is great on it's own, but when small chunks of real blue cheese are added it takes it to a whole new level.<br /><br />On of the first things that I put in on was a Kobe beef hamburger along with crisp dill pickle slices and bit of freshly snipped tarragon.  Wow!  I would be willing to pay $15 for a burger this good at a restaurant.  The next thing that I put in on was a natural casing Polish sausage and it was wonderful.  I have now used in on lamb chops, roasted chicken, sliced tomatoes and more.  I tried making my own but for some reason it just wasn't as good.  Once the jar is opened it lasts for months in the fridge.  This has become a staple in my kitchen.

review/summary: No substitute for a healthy diet, but the kids love it
review/text: We all know by now that eating a balanced diet leads to a over all better quality of living. Will this product be the end all fix for tricking your kids to get the proper amount of veggies a day. No way, but that doesn't make it a bad product, just not a miracle in a pouch. Each pouch is one combined serving of fruit and vegetable. That doesn't mean one serving of veggies and than one fruit but only one serving made up of both. The taste isn't bad at all. My kids inhale them as soon as I ration out their daily allowance. I noticed the amount of sugar in these and only allow one a day. My kids would love to drink these all day long if allowed. They pass the kid taste test approval. I subtracted the 5th star and only give a 4 because of the amount of sugar to volume, and that the juice is not 100% juice. I would love to see a Super-V drink with 100% juice and not the 66% it currently has. The Berry is the best tasting one in my opinion, but since we also buy apple, and fruit punch Super-V I notice they all go just as fast when offered to the kids.

review/summary: Nutty, Medium Roast - Just Right!
review/text: We do love our coffee. Generally, we buy Alterra Cafe Voltaire, but the price is getting pretty high. And, with funds more limited than they used to be, I thought we'd try Coffee Bean Direct. We'd save $20 on the same amount of beans.<br /><br />The first time I ground this blend and put it in the coffee maker, the aroma of the fresh beans did it for me. I knew I had a hit. And, the coffee has been just the way we like it. Not too bitter, not too dark, but still robust and rich. We add a touch of chicory sometimes to the top of the grounds, and ... yummmm.<br /><br />We'll buy this again, and likely try one or two of the other varieties.

We have run the gamete of bean exploration, and have settled on this medium roast because it is just right for both of us. Not too dark, very smooth, good crema, consistent espresso expressed cup after cup. ..And, the price is very reasonable. Highly recommended.

review/summary: I'm not a coffee connoisseur
review/text: Like I said, I'm not a coffee connoisseur but I do enjoy a good latte with friends and family.  Starbucks recently raised the price of their coffee and I decided that my Delonghi espresso machine could use other brands of coffee just fine, thank you.  After looking around and reading reviews, I found nothing negative worth noting about CBD.  The beans smelled wonderful when I opened up the bag and the results are every bit as satisfying as Starbucks for a bit more than half the price.  Since I go through more than a pound a month, I just grind what I need for the next couple of days.<br /><br />So far nobody has noticed the difference which tells me I made the right choice.

review/summary: Made in Michigan since 1866
review/text: I like "Vernor's", and drink it all the time. It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.<br /><br />The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost-cutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernor's is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years, no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime. The soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.<br />Vernor's is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you can't find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment. Search at Amazon for ASIN: B001JK2SEG to see what I mean. Vernors has quite a history, and there are two books at Amazon about the soda. The first is Vernor's Ginger Ale (Images of America: Michigan) ISBN-10: 0738551856. The second book is "The Vernor's Story: From Gnomes to Now" ISBN-10: 0472066978 a book about the company's marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome, and Vernor's fans.

review/summary: Tiny pieces, healthier cats...Purrrfect!
review/text: I have 2 female ragdoll cats. They both have that peculiar habit some cats have of not wanting to eat the crumbs they leave after nibbling on larger pieces of cat food. And they don't leave them on their tray, but on the floor and nearby rug. Grrrr. So I went searching for an adult food with tiny pieces. This one fits the bill! They love it! They have healthier coats after only 2 months! They are much more playful (if you can call a ragdoll playful)! It's cheaper on Amazon than at most pet stores, and ships free with Amazon Prime! Nuff said!!!

review/summary: loving it!
review/text: My 9 year old now indoor cat has a bit of a weight problem since he no longer goes outside. We have tried a number of the "weight management" foods, but he was still not losing weight (actually gaining), even when only feeding 3/4 cup. I tried dropping him to 1/2 a cup a day and he was starving all the time. I caught him trying to eat a cough drop that was on the night stand! I switched him to this a month ago and he loves it. It is considerably lower in calories/cup than a lot of the "weight management" foods, so I found I could give him a reasonable quantity (3/4 cup) and save a bunch of calories. This seems to be the recipe for success! He transitioned over to it without any hesitation, i never even mixed it with the previous food, he just ate this right up. Coat looks amazing, he is playful and happy... so am I.

review/summary: cat hates it
review/text: My cat is a senior cat and she eats just about everything we have given her.  We got her at the humane society and her previous owners fed her fleet farm food.  We figured we would feed her something a little better for her and decided to try the blue buffalo.  We mixed it with what the humane society gave her to ease her into it, but after every meal there would be the blue buffalo chunks left over.  She strategically ate around them and spit some out of the dish.  I am not sure why she doesnt like it, maybe the chunks are too hard because there are some half eaten pieces. Whatever it is not working.  I dont really blame the product because like people, cats have their preferences and blue buffalo did not cut it.  My only suggestion is do not buy the big bag to first try it out.

review/summary: Blue Buffalo Longevity Dry Food
review/text: I bought this food due to the high quality food content, but the pellets were so hard my 16 year old cat would not touch them.  I gave the food to a friend with younger cats, thinking strong teeth would be better suited to this item--but they had no interest in the food either.  They actually removed it from the bowl and ate only their regular food, which was mixed in to make the transfer to a new food easier. I finally ended up putting it outside for the neighborhood feral cat.  He ate it.  But then, I suspect he is starving.  (I live in a very rural area where no shelters exist or I would make an effort to help him; as it is, I just feed him.) Maybe another of the Blue Buffalo products would work, but I opted for Purina One Beyond for my cat which is available at my local stores, costs considerably less, also contains nutritious food and was an instant hit here with my old kitty.  My cat does have a sensitive stomach, and the Purina caused no stomach distress.  I cannot attest to the Blue Buffalo on that count as she would not eat it at all.

review/summary: It gave me my childhood friend back
review/text: I have a 14 year old cat and we were feeding her Iams, Purina... one of those big name cat food brands. However, when we moved to a new location we came across this brand and I instantly fell in love. All you really need to do it read the ingredients in the back. Practically, everything that you would see a cat eat in the wild is in the food. There is real meat and fish in there, blueberries, cranberries and vegetables as well. I noticed a HUGE change in my cat. She used to be real lethargic, always laying around sleeping, taking a few practice jumps before jumping up on the couch. Not to mention she had very bad dandruff. She's a tortoise shell and you could clearly see the dandruff without being right on top of her. Once I switched to Blue Buffalo, she got a little pep in her step. Now I find her running around the house like a bat out of hell and neither of my other two cats know what the heck is going on. Her coat is also nice, shiny and dandruff free. I never knew how much of a difference the change in food could be for her. Now she jumps up on the couch and bed (which is higher up) with ease and is even initiating play with my other two cats. I hate to sound mushy but considering that changing food was the only thing we did different with her, Blue Buffalo gave me my childhood friend back.<br /><br />It may be more expensive than your average cat food but it is well worth it in the end. I do mix longevity with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UT92EY">Blue Buffalo Wilderness Grain Free Dry Cat Food, Chicken Recipe, 12-Pound Bag</a> and have had no problem with her not eating it. All three of my cats gobble up the food in their bowls as if they were rottweilers.<br /><br />*I recently had to switch to a low protein diet due to my eldest developing kidney disease. Within a month of switching foods she reverted back to having horrible dandruff. Aside from switching away from Blue Buffalo nothing in her diet/environment has changed. So this food really does help with dandruff.

review/summary: This is the cat's meow
review/text: It's been a long struggle for us to find cat food that our three cats both like and is good for them.  This is it in terms of dry food.  They liked it immediately and continue to like it. This food is available to our cats all the time and they seem to eat it mostly at night.  All of our cats have lost weight on it and seem to like it well enough that we can give it to them as treats at times.  We also give them canned food and make sure their water is always fresh so that they get enough moisture; dry food doesn't seem to provide adequate moisture for cats.<br /><br />My one objection is that chicken fat is one of the ingredients of this food; one of our cats has a serious allergy to chicken, which is why we were searching for so long for a cat food.  However, he would not any of the other foods we found without any chicken. I will need to check with my veterinarian to see if this is going to cause problems in the long-run.

review/summary: Perfect drink on a warm day!
review/text: I was very skeptical about buying this as I have never been a fan of any tea. I decided to give this a shot as I was looking for some new k-cups for my maker and for a new drink as I was getting tired for my packets of flavor added to water. After reading several review I made the purchase. I am very glad that I did! I make this over ice but have learned by trial and error to find the perfect combination of a 16 oz double walled cut filled to the brim with ice. From there I make it on the middle setting. Some people say you can use the pod twice for tea but I only like to use it once and I like the full flavor.  This is a great drink with a good amount of flavor and taste even if you ate not a tea drinker, it is not too sweet either which I like as well.

review/summary: Hands Down the Best Bold Coffee T-Disc Available
review/text: I drink strong black coffee. After sampling all the bold brew T-Discs available, and prior to the release of Starbuck's Africa Kitamu, I was a faithful user of their Verona discs. That all changed with my first sip of the Africa Kitamu coffee. The strength is decidedly bold but not bitter. The best description may be that it is very smooth. It is absolutely delicious, and Africa is now my first choice and new favorite.<br /><br />The coffee is also a wise choice for those who like a lighter brew. Simply use the manual override procedure on the Tassimo coffee maker to add extra water to taste. In the process, an even larger cup of coffee is created.<br /><br />With each new release, Starbucks's has added significant quality to the T-Disc line and is quickly making my Tassimo indispensable.

I just hoped I would like the Kitamu enough that I wouldn't have to throw it away. I was hooked from the first sip. The Kitamu is much bolder than the Verona and has a great aroma, and the flavor of the roast really comes through. If you favor breakfast blends and other mild coffees, pass on this one. If you're a fan of Verona and have not tried the Kitamu, give it a spin. You might find a new first cup, too.

review/summary: Kitamu is currently the best tasting T-disk on the market
review/text: If you like stronger coffee, you need to try this - the best T-disk I've sampled (and I've tried a very wide variety).  It is also one of the more expensive choices.  For those like me who count pennies, the best Amazon deal is usually sold in 2 packs of 12 = 24 T-disks, thus about 90 cents per cup, with free shipping.  A slight bit cheaper even with tax if you can find it on the shelves at BB&B, especially with one of their coupons.<br /><br />Closest I've had to a cup purchased from a Starbucks counter.  Of course, I have to miss out on an engaging conversation with the neon haired, body pierced counterperson, but can't have it all.<br /><br />If you want a really great tasting bargain strong cup of coffee, and if it becomes available again, try Seattle's Best Henry's Blend (c'mon SB, bring it back!!).  Better bargain than Starbucks, and better than many of their selections (I still prefer the Kitamu, but variety is the spice).

review/summary: I'm more of a coffee gourmand than gourmet...
review/text: but I know I like this coffee!  I like strong coffees (I normally buy Peets--YUM, or some Caffe Kimbo my husband likes).  I don't usually go to Starbucks for anything other than a green tea frappaccino for a treat--I don't get coffee there habitually.<br /><br />I also don't personally have the Tassimo machine but one of my co-workers has the machine and likes to brew up coffee for the rest of us once in awhile.  The other ones she has made were good but I do prefer a really strong cup, so I bought this coffee to try out (I bought her some of her favorite stuff too--carmel machi-something or other...more like a dessert to me).<br /><br />This is nice, strong and tasty.  The only commercial stuff we have in the building I work is Seattle's Best (ugh) and then stuff in vending machines...this is WAY better needless to say.  I may have to get one of these machines now that I found a coffee I enjoy.<br /><br />In any case, for those with the machine (or a co-worker like mine) and who like a nice strong, tasty cup of coffee, this is great.<br /><br />Recommended!!<br /><br />JTG

review/summary: Amazing Taste
review/text: If you are anything like me and like your coffee strong then this Tassimo blend is for you. I do not remember ever seeing this blend in the Starbucks shops. It is tasty. But definitely a bold.
