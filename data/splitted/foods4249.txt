review/text: We were buying these at the dollar stores but all the stores stopped carrying them the last 6 months.  We searched the internet and found them here.  These are a white chocolate and are great to suck on in church. Though the price is for 5 lbs I think that still great.

review/summary: Very tasty rice - highly recommended.
review/text: First off, we all love rice at our house. I also love wild rice and rice pilaf,<br />although the others are not all that big on those dishes.<br /><br />So, when I read the descriptions on this, I thought it sounded really tasty, but<br />had some real hesitations about buying six packs of the rice. I wondered how we'd actually<br />manage to use six bags before it went bad.<br /><br />Well, the bags are not all that huge. Each bag is one pound of rice. I guess I had a hard<br />time visualizing it, but the bags are fairly small. I don't have one in front of me, but they<br />are maybe 6" square.<br /><br />Anyway, we made the first bag this weekend, putting it in a crock pot and letting it cook<br />on low for 2 or 3 hours. Hubby is the chef in our house, and he used beef broth with the rice.<br />We had it with some sausage for dinner. Let me say - WOW!<br />This is really tasty rice! Between the four of us, we managed to wipe out the entire pound<br />of rice (yes, it was that good!), and were figuring out what the next meal with the rice would be!<br /><br />Watch your prices on this - they vary widely, even across Amazon.<br />Try to stay under $3 a bag.<br />Seriously, this stuff tastes great! It was tasty, filling and actually easier to<br />chew than I thought it might be (I have troubles with crunchy foods).<br /><br />Thank you Lundberg for a really great blend of rice.  You've converted us!

review/text: I have ordered Hawaiian Shaved Ice 10 pint pack for $44 and this time around decided to try Great Northern Polar's 10 pint pack for $29 (both have free Super Saver Shipping).  I was pleasantly surprised and happy with my Great Northern purchases upon testing.  The ten flavors all taste very delicious and I prefer the texture of the shaved ice when G N P's syrup is poured on, as opposed to Hawaiian Shaved Ice's.  I'd definitely recommend this less expensive option for snow cone syrup!!

review/text: I was a little concerned when Folgers bought Millstone a few years back.  Kind of thought of Folgers as the American Motors of coffee. You know... the Gremlin and Pacer? Anyhoo, Smuckers bought the whole kit 'n' kaboodle [2008] and quality was kicked up more than a few notches company-wide.  Even Folgers familiar off-the-shelf red jug is now drinkable.  Thanks, Smuckers!<br /><br />I've purchased both the regular packages and the 1.75 ounce packages of Millstone... the latter were on sale for about $10 bucks recently. (Watch for Amazon to put it on sale, which happens from time-to-time!) I like the convenience of being able to take the small packages to work, and they're a nice litte "thank-you" gift for friends, neighbors, co-workers, etc.<br /><br />I think this is THE best chocolate flavored coffee I've had, bar NONE.  And I've tried many... Gevalia; Berres Brothers; Camerons; Caribou; a couple of local coffee house blends; and three or four "boutique" brands - the kind you often find at places like T J Maxx, The World Market, and so on.  The Millstone is SMOOTH, MELLOW, AROMATIC, and the CHOCOLATE comes through perfectly.<br /><br />This is truly one of my favorite flavored brews.  It'll be one of yours, too!

review/summary: Most delicious milk alternative! (But look for the best price.)
review/text: This is not only the most delicious coconut drink on the market but also the most delicious and addictive of any milk alternative.  The "original" flavour is just the right level of sweetness -- and it is far tastier than the "unsweetened" and "vanilla" options.  This product is a treat to have in cereal or to drink on its own.<br /><br />BUT (double-underlined!) you should NOT be paying $4.00/carton for Coconut Dream.  Even at my over-priced local grocery store, this product sells for $3.59.  So unless it's worth it to you to pay a premium to have 12 cartons delivered to your home all at once, I would suggest looking elsewhere.<br /><br />I hope that other companies will begin to ship Coconut Dream through Amazon, thereby making the price more competitive.

review/summary: go on, buy it!
review/text: This flour is outstanding. Very fresh, delicious flavor. As the other review noted, it's finely and evenly milled so the texture of breads is much more refined than with normal whole wheat flour. I just topped a cassoulet with some drop biscuits made with half unbleached white flour and half this whole wheat pastry flour--the "is that whole grain again" factor never arose. Using 100% whole wheat is also great in banana bread and other uses. The half and half biscuits were as light as usual and much tastier. I will buy this again, and again and again. Note--whole wheat flour can go rancid quickly and 25 lbs is a lot for most homes, so I freeze what I'm not going to use in a couple of weeks in tightly sealed 1 or 2-gallon ziplock bags.

review/text: This is my favorite whole wheat pastry flour.  It has a very fine texture & it doesn't have big pieces of bran like some brands I've tried.  I use it 100% in pancakes & they turn out light & fluffy.  I also use it as about 50% (regular white flour for the remaining 50%) of the flour in biscuits.  We like really fluffy biscuits, so that's why I only use half.  Works great in cookies too.  This is for non-yeast baking & works much better than w.w. bread flour in cookies, pancakes, etc.

Quality is awesome to bake all kinds of cookies, pound cakes, brownies, pancakes, pies and we even made pizza from it. It's soft and easy to manage.<br /><br />But the best part is that it comes packaged without plastic (palstic-free)!!! I was so impressed with that - it's packaged in brown paper bag and "sealed" or threaded with thick cotton thread (the way they did cloth sacks with grains in olde days).<br /><br />So even if there is a cheaper organic pastry flour, I will stick to this one just because of awesome environmental packaging!

The two flours are replacing my King Arthur White Whole wheat that I used to buy so much of at my local grocery.  The flavor of these flours is definitely superior to the KA (which I also liked).  But now, I know I am feeding my family organic.

review/text: While the flour is good, it is just too fine for making Indian Rotis/Chappatis. Probably has to do with the fact that it is pastry flour. The Rotis/Chappatis made with this flour turns out a bit chewy. And the cold Rotis/Chappatis turn very tough to chew. For Rotis/Chappatis, you need a slightly more granular flour.

review/text: If you were to give me an orange, it had better be a blood orange. I can tolerate orange juice every so often, and other than that, I don't care for orange candies. I'll eat them, but they'll be last.<br /><br />This matcha does not apply to these usual feelings of mine. This is an orange flavor I can stand. It's somewhere between a fresh orange and an orange candy. I can drink it no problem...especially because it mixes with other flavors so well.<br /><br />If you're adventurous, this one is a beauty with cola matcha. This is a fantastic addition to a smoothie, especially if you just need a little citrus tanginess to it. It's almost like being able to add a touch of orange juice but without adding more sugar and instead adding a little bit of a different dimension of flavor to your smoothie.<br /><br />Of course, if you dig orange flavors, this is probably a winner no matter what.

review/summary: Outstanding Orange Matcha
review/text: My Matcha journey continues with Red Leaf Tea"s Orange Matcha. Orange is one of my favorite fruit flavors. If you are a fan of the flavor orange as well, I highly recommend that you treat yourself. Perhaps even if orange isn't on your top 5 favorite flavors list, you may want to travel outside your flavor "comfort zone" and give this one a try. It certainly does not disappoint! The aroma is intoxicating and the flavor is straight up orangey goodness! I prefer this one cold but that may just be because it has been so hot lately. I prepare it according to directions, add a wee bit of simple syrup and chill. It is a refreshing citrus energy drink that is loaded with flavor and all the benefits of Matcha tea. I can not say enough about the energy drinking a cup of this tea provides. A great way to start your day or an excellent midday pick me up!<br />So many ways to incorporate this magic matcha into your day. Perhaps add to your orange cranberry muffin or scone recipe. One of my favorites so far has been to add a teaspoon of my orange matcha, a scoop of vanilla low fat frozen yogurt, a splash of low fat milk and a quick mix in the blender = a yummy wonderful dessert-like creamsicle flavored smoothie!

review/summary: Orange you glad I didn't say banana?
review/text: This blend is one I worry about, which is why it jumped in and out of the cart so many times when the new matchas were first released. I love oranges, but I'm very specific about. If it doesn't taste like fresh oranges, then why bother? For years, until just recently, in fact, I thought orange candies, like orange Skittles or Runts, were put in because they were cheaper to produce because nobody really liked them. Everybody knows that grape and strawberry are the good flavors, right? Wrong. This is what comes from a skewed worldview, folks. But it works out beautifully, because I love the strawberry and grape flavors of the world, and my wife loves the orange, lime, and lemons. So what that long story was winding up to was that if this matcha tastes more like candy orange and not fresh orange, I will be very, very sad. And then I'll mix it with the French Vanilla and everything will be just fine. And, of course, cranberry is one I must try mixed with the orange at some point. I also have a history of citrus matcha not turning out as good as I'd like (I'm looking at you, Lemon and Peach), but there  is a history of my being afraid of blends and having them turn out amazing (That's Watermelon and Earl Grey) as well. So I'm just trying to keep an open mind!<br /><br />I'm sitting here with three little cups of matcha to try (Orange, Apple, and Brandy) and I reached for Orange first. I took a sip, chuckled, and handed it to my wife. She doesn't like matcha, but she likes this one! I knew she would because that first sip is tasty, tasty orange candy. It's incredibly tasty (as you might have guessed) but it isn't really fresh orange or orange juice. It's orange Runts and juicy orange Skittles. Yum. My wife likes it, so I think this might become a morning treat for her, but for me...well, I don't know! But if I want oranges in the morning, I'll likely reach for orange juice proper. I have cotton candy matcha, also from Red Leaf Teas, what other matchas do I need? Still, I keep reaching for it as I sit here writing, so maybe it'll grow on me. It is very good, and if you're a fan of orange candy, this is one you must try. Not a touch of bitterness, though!

review/summary: Looks are average but but not my cup of tea
review/text: Received this as a gift and I was thrilled because I've been eyeing the Bentely's Finest Elegant Wooden Tea Chest for a couple years.  The box is smaller than I'd expected, especially since it houses 120 tea bags, but the footprint is smaller, and that's a good thing for a small home.  Each stack is 10 teabags. The tea chest is a very dark, non-wood appearing not too heavy box with solid feet and cheap looking shiny brass colored metal hardware.  The interior contains red felt separators which can be removed if you want to use this for larger tea bags or something else after the tea is consumed.  Since it appears that this was marketed as a presentation box for Bentley teas, I'd give it a solid 3 star at the half price cost, would have given it a 4 if it did not have the bright gold Bentley ad on the inside of the lid.  If you actually use the chest to present the teas to guests, it's rather tacky in appearance.  The teas are far from the best I've drunk, but I have found that they are very nice for brewing iced tea.  The bags are made of bleached white paper, sealed at the edges, have a white string and small paper hang tag attached at one pressed seam.  Each bag is enveloped by a brightly colored lightweight paper.  There is not much tea powder residual found inside the paper, so the tea is contained well.  The teas are all black with assorted flavorings or the single green tea option without additional flavoring.  It's absolutely an average product.

Recently, I did extensive research to find who sells this and at the best price.  Amazon's auto ship is definitely the best price out there.  The auto delivery makes it easy and I don't have to think about it.  The auto delivery is also flexible as I can change my delivery preferences any time I want (number per shipment, how often, etc).  I already think I'm going to have to move my next shipment up because I drink it at least once a day.<br /><br />I have also checked store shelves and the internet over the years and have never found ANY product that had all of the features that I want (see bullets above).  The combination of sugar free and decaffeinated are hard to find in any beverage type.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this product to people wanting this combination of product features and, if not, I encourage you to look at Amazon's other choices within the I.F/Maxwell house line.  I have tried many of them over the years and I'm sure you will find one you like (and at the best price).<br /><br />Bon Appetit

review/summary: Claim victory in taste and nutrition!
review/text: I am a college freshman and have become particularly concerned with my nutritional habits over the past couple of years because my father is on the verge of becoming diabetic.  In hopes of avoiding gaining the "freshman fifteen" this year and in maintaining my dietary goals, I've stocked up on Swiss Miss Diet Hot Cocoa Mix.  It provides me with the sweet fix I need when I'm craving chocolate and don't want to calorie splurge.<br /><br />I used to be a Starbucks junkie, and before my dietary turnaround, I downed my grande (16 ounce) Starbucks Signature Hot chocolate as if it was water.  When I became aware that my formerly innocent, non-fat, no-whip, winter refreshment still had 410 calories and 42 grams of sugar in it, I began my search for a better alternative.  In discovering Swiss Miss Diet Hot Cocoa Mix, now I am able to get an even greater satisfaction with the 25-calorie miracle packet that transforms plain water into my favorite treat.<br /><br />Without the addition of milk, it is essential to add a large spoonful of Splenda to reach optimal taste.  When I first tried the mix without artificial sweeteners and mixed with only water, I was very disappointed at how bland the flavor was.  However, now, with a heap of Splenda, a Swiss Miss Diet Hot Cocoa Mix packet, and a mug of steaming water, I claim victory in taste and nutrition.<br /><br />I began buying Swiss Miss Diet Hot Cocoa when I found it at my local grocery store, Pavilions.  It would cost around $5.25 a box, and with six packets in each box, around 88 cents per packet.  At Amazon.com, I am able to purchase the mix in bulk and in purchasing a case of six boxes, each packet costs me 31 cents, saving me 57 cents per packet.<br /><br />Some reviewers have claimed that the hot cocoa clumps up in mixing it with water.  This has occurred to me several times when my water was too hot.  Avoid boiling hot water, and stir as you pour the water into the mug with the hot cocoa mix and Splenda already in it, and you should no longer encounter this problem.<br /><br />I have experimented in using sugar-free chocolate syrups to make hot cocoa instead of using a mix and have been highly disappointed with the results. The syrup does not mix as well, and the texture of the hot cocoa is too thin, especially if just mixing the syrup in water.<br /><br />After a long day of studying in the library and a snowy trek back to my dorm, a mug of Swiss Miss Diet Hot Cocoa with a heap of Splenda and a spritz of cinnamon is my always highly anticipated reward.

review/text: Swiss Miss Diet is a terrific little 25 calorie treat (or in my case, 50 calories since I use a 16 oz mug) when you just need to have something chocolatey but don't want to spend the calories on some actual chocolate.  For those who complained about the way it dissolves, after adding the powder to your cup, pour in about one quarter cup of boiling water and stir briskly until all the clumps are dissolved.  Then pour in the rest of the water.  I also like to add some of the mix to my coffee for a nice change of pace.  All in all, a very tasty drink.

review/summary: World Class Hot Cocoa...Not Exactly
review/text: Let's get real.  This is not equal to a world class hot chocolate made with Valrhona or Scharffen Berger chocolate in whole milk with a little cream added and real sugar.  But then when did 25 calories ever taste as good as lets say 300 or more calories.  For only 25 calories it is excellent.  You will have to search for a long time for a better low calorie snack that also helps with your chocolate cravings.  If you find that other snack, please let me know.  Some have commented on it being to sweet.  I have found if you let it cool to very warm, but not hot, the artificial sweetener taste is not as strong and it taste more like chocolate (just my opinion).  Remember, it is what it is, but I think for what it is, it is worth 5 stars.

review/text: I love to have a mocha coffee in the morning, which I fix with microwaved skim milk, a teaspoon of instant coffee and cocoa mix.  But, I desperately need to lose weight and did not want to have to give this up.  I tried the Sugar Free Nesquik, and it seemed, as is often the case with artficially sweetened things, to be WAY too sweet, plus, when reading the ingredients, I found that it had hydrogenated ingredients in it.  As that can clog arteries, it concerned me.  I tried this, and it IS frustratingly hard to get it to desolve, but it tastes great, and does not have the hydrogenated ingredients in it.  So, I will be using this. I just wish it came in larger containers, so it would be less expensive.  Only plus to the packets, is that then I only use a set amount.

review/summary: Wonderful stuff, & easy to get rid of the clumps
review/text: This is such a great product.  Yes, it's a little harder to dissolve than the fat-free kind. Here's what I do:  While I'm waiting for the water to boil, I put a couple of tablespoons of water (room temp is okay) into the cup with the powder. Stir it with a tiny whisk or a fork until it's totally dissolved, 30 sec or less. Voila! When you add the boiling water, there are no lumps at all. Perfectamundo.

review/text: I've tried this and tried the similar product by Nestle, and this one just doesn't dissolve well, it leaves big lumpy clumps along the inside of the cup as you drink it, and too much sediment in the bottom. I was pretty sad I ordered this and happy to go back to the Nestle version, which I drink every day.

review/summary: Swiss Miss: Diet Hot Chocolate
review/text: This Swiss Miss product has only 25 calories and most importantly no "modified milk ingredients" which is a filler product known to cause severe allergic reactions.  Most of the lower calorie products contain modified milk ingredients, the more expensive or 'organic' hot chocolates do not; but then they are very high calorie.  Swiss Miss is the perfect trade off.<br /><br />Mix it with coffee for a mocha!  To prevent clumping, try blending a small amount of hot liquid into the chocolate, stir until smooth then add the remaining hot water/coffee/milk.

review/summary: Wonderfully Rich Chocolate Taste!
review/text: I am a true chocoholic so I was hesitant to order this very low calorie cocoa mix. But I am so glad I did so. I was so very pleasantly surprised with the rich chocolate taste and I really feel like I am having an indulgent treat when I sip this wonderful cocoa. I just ordered 12 more boxes! PS: Don't be surprised when you open the box and it appears to be half full, the epitome of over-packaging, but I guess folks wouldn't buy a tiny box into which the eight packages would fit. (I have never seen this product in stores, btw)

review/summary: A wonderful pleasure in pushing for a healthy life
review/text: I don't usually review products but I must for Diet Swiss Miss Cocoa because it has been a miracle to me!  I choose not to eat or drink more than a few grams of sugar at a time as I have made a lifestyle change to loose weight and be healthy.  When comparing the nutrition facts of other cocoa mixes it becomes apparent why the United States has such problems with obesity and other health issues.  One packet of mix can easily contain over 140 calories and 25 grams of sugar and often more than just one serving is consumed at a time.  This is astounding for something as simple as hot cocoa.  In my searching I have tried many different brands and types of cocoa; Nestle, grocery store generic, fat free, no sugar added, etc.  Diet Swiss Miss is the best when you want taste and decent nutrition.  It has a much smoother flavor than all the rest and also has the least amount of calories and sugar I have found (25 calories, 0 grams fat, 160 mg sodium, 4 grams total carbohydrate with 1 gram fiber and 2 grams sugar, 2 grams protein, 30% calcium, 6% iron, and 25% Vitamin D).  However, don't expect to love it right after drinking a cup of Ghirardelli double chocolate cocoa or the like.  This is not the decadent, indulgent stuff with the rich calorie and sugar price tag.  I personally choose to add a couple drops of EZ Sweetz liquid sucralose sweetener which has less fillers (carbohydrates) than the powder variety of Splenda and also packs an unimaginable bang per drop.  More sweetness is gained by doing this without adding calories or grams of sugar.  All in all this is an amazing product perfect for diabetics and those working to change their lifestyle without having to give up some of the little pleasures like a warm glass of cocoa.  One last note, Diet Swiss Miss is very hard to find in the grocery store.  Every time I go shopping I make it a habit to check the cocoa stock and prices.  If even available the cost can easily be over $4.00 a box in the Seattle area where I live.  Amazon.com offers this product at a great price.  I recommend you stock up not only so you save time and hassle in reordering but so you can also qualify for free shipping.  The only other place I have found this at a better price (and it was only one time) was at a Super Wal-Mart where I bought the entire stock on hand.  Best wishes in healthy living while you enjoy your hot cocoa.

review/text: For 25 calories, this isn't a bad treat.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good the flavor was.  The major drawback with this is that it is difficult to get it to dissolve into hot water...takes some work mushing the lumps on the side of the cup, but it's worth it.  This is really good with some nice cinnamon added.

This last time there was a screw-up with sending 2 shipments but they credited me for one and let me keep it anyway because it was food.

review/summary: Not worth it...
review/text: I purchased this product to make a Hungry Girl recipe for hot chocolate. The recipe called for 2 packets of Diet Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate packets. I couldn't find them in the store, so I bought them on Amazon. All I could find in the store was Swiss Miss Sensible Sweets No Sugar Added. So I had purchased a box of that in the store.<br /><br />When I received my "Diet" Hot Chocolate in the mail, I looked at the nutritional facts AND the size of the packets inside and compared them to the "no sugar added" ones I purchased in the store. It turns out that using 2 packets of the "Diet" hot chocolate was not much different than using the 1 packet of the "No Sugar Added" hot chocolate.<br /><br />The "Diet" hot chocolate packets have about 1/2 the amount of hot chocolate in them! That is how they are only 25 calories and the "no sugar added" is 60 calories. It actually is cheaper for me to make my recipe by using the "no sugar added" that I can buy in the store.<br /><br />I am following Weight Watchers, so my main concern is that my special hot chocolate drink is low in points...and using 1 packet of "no sugar added" hot chocolate instead of 2 packets of "diet" hot chocolate didn't change the points value for me AND it will go twice as far because I only have to use one packet!<br /><br />I'll have to say...that if I was just making a glass of hot chocolate, that the convenience of the smaller "Diet" packet is nice (you don't have to use half a packet and save it for later, like you would with the "no sugar added")<br /><br />The taste is great and it only has 25 calories. I gave it a 3 star because I was disappointed that I was spending twice as much to make my recipe than I had to...because of my discovery that the packets of chocolate are 1/2 the size than the one I bought in the store :-)

review/summary: Enjoy some self-indulgence without feeling guilty!
review/text: If you are on a diet or a diabetic you have to watch your calories, carbohydrates and sugars.  It really makes it bad when you have to give up some of your favorite things like sipping on a hot cup of hot cocoa while watching your favorite TV show or reading a good book.<br /><br />My wife brought some of this and it is pretty good.  You get a rich chocolate taste and you don't get a lot of calories and sugar.  This drink only has 25 calories, no fat, 2 sugars and 4 grams of carbohydrates.  To make the drink you just pour the contents into a cup and stir in 6 ounces of hot (Not boiling water).  Make sure that you stir the drink well to get it all to dissolve.<br /><br />This drink allows you to have a little self-indulgence without paying a big penalty and feeling guilty.  For a lower calorie substitute it does a good job of satisfying your chocolate cravings. We enjoy it once in a while and I recommend it to you.

review/text: I tried really hard to acquire a taste for coffee but no matter how much chocolate caramel creamer I put in it...just not going to happen.  Yet, I still really wanted a cup of something in the mornings.  Short of just heating up my creamer and drinking it straight I thought I would look for a hot chocolate that didn't provide 50% of my daily caloric intake in one serving.  Way to go Swiss Miss!<br />I took the advice of another reviewer and added sugar substitute (Sweet 'N Low in my case).  I used one packet of sugar substitute to two packets of the hot chocolate mix.  Perfect in my opinion.  Maybe if you did a side-by-side comparison with the regular stuff you might find the diet mix wanting.  I am quite pleased with the diet.  It is very creamy, and there is enough chocolate flavor in this stuff to cure the cravings of any hard-core chocolaholic.

review/text: I have been buying this in bulk for over a year! The truth is it's not bad once you add a little "truvia" (0 calories) and some unsweetened almond milk (7 calories)you can no longer tell its diet and it is only 32 calories. At the end of the day after dinner I need a little sweet kick without all the extra calories and this hits the spot. I have one at least 5 nights a week. The liquid fills me up and prevents me from reaching for high calorie desserts. The only things is that it doesn't mix so well if you just whirl a spoon around. I use my cappacino mini-frother. ($ 20 from WIllim and Sonoma) and it gets a better consistency. I set up the Amazon account where they automatically resend it to me every 2 months! It is great price as well!

Still, I don't think I'm going to buy this specific product again.

review/summary: Tastes great while avoiding a lot of sugar!
review/text: I love this mix! Just had some! No problem mixing it if you do it by the process of graduated dilution... put the cocoa in your cup, then pour only part of the premeasured hot water over the cocoa and stir. You should mix it 1 to 1, like mixing flour & water for a good gravy without lumps.  Stir til smoothe, then gradually add the rest of the water little by little, continually stirring. I avoid sugar and 2 grams is not too bad. If you try the totally sugar free brands, they sacrifice taste. I especially like making my own peppermint hot chocolate, better than Starbucks! I buy sugar-free starlight mints, break them up, and put in the cup on top of the cocoa powder before adding the hot water... one mint per packet of cocoa. I break up the mint by hitting with a knife on the granite counter.... mint still in the wrapper of course... works well & only takes a few moments. This peppermint hot chocolate is absolutely delicious! Wish I had sugar free marshmallows lol! Local stores don't have this cocoa, except for Wal-Mart. I ranked it a 4 because it does have sugar. If they leave out the sugar without sacrificing taste, it would be a 5!

review/text: Having a Keurig B60 brewer but finding the K-Cup hot cocoa rather expensive and not having found a K-Cup brand with a good taste I thought I would give the Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa Mix, Diet with Calcium, 8-Count Envelopes (Pack of 6) a try. I was pleasantly surprised when I gave it a try. I used the Keurig on the 6 oz setting and filled my cup with the 6 oz of hot water...poured sometimes 1 envelope and other times 2 envelopes of the Swiss Miss in the cup depending on my wanting a more chocolate taste or not. Stir the cocoa with a whisk to break up the clumps then put the cup back in the Keurig and add another 6 oz of hot water. To me the taste has been better than any K-Cup Cocoa mix I had tried. I love my hot cocoa during these winter evenings and sometimes during those cold winter days.

review/summary: good low carb choice
review/text: When looking for low carb items I found Swiss Miss Diet hot cocoa.  When I have a sweet tooth craving or the need to eat when I'm not hungry,I have found this to be a good alternative.  When I drink it, it satisfies my sweet tooth and because it is a hot liquid, it makes me feel full without adding to my waistline.<br /><br />That being said, I will tell you when I made it with just hot water, ugh. Not very tasty.  I have discovered that if replace 25-50% of the hot water with half & half, creamer or milk it make a HUGE difference.  For an extra special treat, I add whipped cream on top!  =)  This is probably not a good choice for those NOT on a low carb diet since the addition of milk and whipped cream will add fat and calories.<br /><br />For a spin on plain hot cocoa, try mixing it with coffee for a low carb mocha without spending a fortune.

review/summary: Hot Stuff
review/text: I really like this stuff.  Also, Amazon's price beats the local competition.  If you like hot chocolate and don't like calories you really ought to try it.

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: For diet, it's not bad. Scratch that, it's just not bad. It does leave a little bit of the powder left over even after I've added hot milk, but it's chocolaty goodness so I can't really complain.

review/summary: Yummy so chocolate and rich
review/text: Love this product, I am on automatic delivery but I usually use it before than and have to have it shipped sooner.  I put it in my oatmeal at night for only 25 calories it provides the bigggest chocolate bang and stops that chocolate craving.  I have lost 70 lbs on Weight Watchers and it is products like this one that make that possible.  And because I use automatic delivery, it is cheaper than in the store and NO shipping cost.  Now that is what I call a bargain!

review/summary: Swiss Miss to the Rescue
review/text: When following a weight loss program, there are times when a little hunger calm is needed, like still being hungry after a controlled meal, or shortly before bedtime. A cup of hot Swiss Miss Diet with calcium satisfies on several levels. The calming to the tummy wards off the hunger and satisfies like a sweet treat and provides a dose of calming calcium. It will put a smile on your face and for 25 small calories, it won't affect your caloric intake negatively. It is rich in flavor and satisfying, whether you just want a tasty hot chocolate, or you need a little hunger calming. We give it an A+.

review/summary: Satisfying
review/text: This product satisfies me without (much) guilt when I crave chocolate.<br />Of course, it is not as tasty as a 400 calories homemade hot cocoa, but the ratio satisfaction/calories (guilt?) is quite an accomplishment.

review/summary: Great option for diabetics
review/text: This is not the same as the regular Swiss Miss, but I find it an acceptable option for diabetics.  I have this on subscription.  It's nice to be able to have a mug (use two pkg) when I make cocoa for my grandkids.  You can add a little splenda to sweeten, but I have gotten used to the less sweet flavor.  Cocoa does settle at the bottom a little, but a stir midway though would do the trick.  Although not low fat, to richen it I have added a tablespoon of half and half.  It's good added to coffee to make a mocha drink.  I rate this 5 stars as I have tried to make my own diabetic mix formula and this is so much simpler.  Not perfect, but perfect for me.

review/summary: Tastes... Blah
review/text: I wouldn't have minded this as much had I not tried another brand of diet cocoa mixes. I bought a generic store brand (krogers) which had a richer chocolate taste and didn't clump up as much. I rather drink that instead of this...

review/summary: It is OK for a diet product, but...
review/text: PROS:<br />1) One serving has only 25 calories (zero points if you are on Weight Watchers).<br />2) Sweet enough to kill your sweet tooth for a long while.<br />3) Tastes better then other "diet" hot chocolate powders I have tried.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1) Even with the little amount of water (6 oz.), it tastes watery...Much better with fat free milk, but then has more calories... To fill a full mug (typically 10 oz), you must use two packets.<br />2) The chemicals in it make my tummy feel odd. I cannot drink more then 6 oz...<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT:<br />I keep it on hand, for when the sweet tooth strikes, particularly in the evenings (easy to get away with due to the low calorie count). Tastewise however, I would rather have a small piece of "regular" chocolate, then this. Therefore, I use it infrequently. Still, if you are looking to fill a "sweet" void in your low calorie diet, this may be a good choice for you as it does taste better then its super market alternatives... I guess you have to pick your battles... ;o)

review/summary: Diabetic type 2 - love, love, love this product!
review/text: For those of you having problems with lumps.  Empty the cocoa into a cup.  Add 2 or 3 tablespoons of hot water and stir thoroughly. (this creates a rue) Slowly add the rest of your hot water while stirring.  No lumps! Adding a tsp of almond extract makes your hot chocolate taste like cherry cordials. (my husband's favorite).  Being a chocolate craving diabetic woman this product is a lifesaver! ENJOY!

review/summary: Not the best
review/text: Bought this for hubby, who is recently diagnosed diabetic. Cocoa is very low in carbs, but also very thin & seems to settle to the bottom of the cup.

review/summary: Love It But CHEAPER AT Wally World!
review/text: I love this item. Yes it takes a few more stirs and I add in a bit of vanilla sugar free creamer just to make it richer but I feel like I have a really decadent treat and it totally satisfies my chocolate craving for a total of about 50 cals (including the creamer). My only issue here is it's only 1.99 a 8 pack box at Wally world...it's very popular there. It's always the one that has the least amt left on the self. Save your money and buy it there! At the "reg" grocery it runs 2.99.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I add a teaspoon to a cup of coffee and do not have to add milk.  I just add some more 0 calorie sweetener for a delicious low calorie drink.  For an even better (and extra healthy) treat add a little (1/3 teaspoon) high quality, unsweetened cocoa powder (processed without alkali--that is not dutched) and cinnamon (these add very few calories).<br /><br />Just wish this came in a 13.8 ounce size.

review/summary: the best 25 calorie dessert!
review/text: The Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa Diet mix is the best low calorie dessert I've found!  It's better than a chocolate bar, as it tastes as good and has only 25 calories, and cascium and Vitamin D.  What a great way to end a meal!  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Delicious for low-carb diets
review/text: Great for diabetic food plans. This "diet" version has fewer carbs than the "low-carb" version. While you can use the microwave, I heat the water in an electric kettle.
