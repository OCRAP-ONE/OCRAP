review/summary: Use before showering on dry/frizzy hair
review/text: I have been using this product for about 3 years now. I have thick, wavy black hair (which has been dyed brown in the past), and I thought this was an okay product to use. Even though it's not perfect, I would say my hair is better when I use this product than when I don't use this product.If your hair is naturally oily and rarely gets dry, you're fortunate enough not to need oils like these. But if your hair gets dry and perhaps frizzy once you're out of the shower, you should try this hair oil.<br /><br />I use this product 2 or 3 times a week. I massage it into my hair at least half an hour before I take a shower. It smells a little, and it's really up to you whether you find it a good or bad smell, but I personally don't like it. When I'm in the shower, I use small amounts of shampoo and conditioner (which is what you're supposed to do anyway) and wash out my hair with cold water. Then I let my hair air-dry or towel-dry and apply a leave-in conditioner of a different brand. And my hair feels good afterward! It's not dry nor oily, it doesn't look frizzy, and people have told me my hair is looking healthier over time.<br /><br />I basically don't like the smell of this product. And I'm sure there are much better, albeit more expensive, hair oil brands out there. But if you need to cure your hair of dryness, you should make your shower routine more like mine.

review/summary: Royal Canin
review/text: Persian cats can be very fussy eaters and have very delicate digestive tracks. They also have trouble picking up their food. Royal Canin for Persians has been perfect for our two cats.  Its easy for them to pick up. They enjoy the taste, but don't over eat. They've had no digestive problems, urinary infections which can be a problem with an all dry food diet. Their skin and coats are healthy and fur balls are minimal. They have it packaged with a resealable strip which helps keep it fresh.  I'm very happy.  And its a Great Price!

review/summary: Probably the Best Persian Cat Food
review/text: My cat is a Persian- flat faced, long hair, etc. (just like the picture on the front of this cat food). She has only ever been on Royal Canin since birth. She used baby cat and kitten Royal Canin before she was one. I think it's great for her. She NEVER has hair balls. The only times she's ever had a hair ball is when I've given her some fairly cheap cat treats- now, I only give her "all natural" cat treats which never give her a problem. Her fur is still like kitten cotton-candy fur and she's about a year and a half old now.<br />I've had two Persian cats in the past who I did not give Royal Canin to (I had never even heard of Royal Canin at the time). Their fur lost the consistency that it should have and became somewhat oily and slightly more coarse compared to how it should have been. They also occasionally experienced hair balls.<br />I highly recommend this cat food. It's sort of expensive, but so are Persians. Plus, it's hardly any cost compared to human food. So, treat your Persian cat right and give them food that you can count on to be healthful.

review/summary: My cat's favorite dry food
review/text: This is the only dry cat food my Persian mix will eat with enthusiasm. It makes his coat very soft and silky and, other than wet food, he likes this the best (does not even touch Nutro Max; begrudgingly eats Wellness dry).<br /><br />It doesn't control for hairballs as well as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HAJZHM">Royal Canin Dry Cat Food, Intense Hairball 34 Formula, 6-Pound Bag</a>, so I alternate the two. I also switch it up because the Persian food can make him chubbier because he does eat more of it.

I like spicy food, and these sardines are not too spicy. It has the perfect combination of spicy flavor and sweet tomato and the aroma is pretty good too.<br />The firmness of these sardines is perfect for me. They are soft but not mushy.<br />It also has a decent fish to sauce ratio. Based on my experiences, each oval contains 3-6 pieces, depending on the size of each sardine.<br />Five Star for sure!!!  Great on toast and rice.

review/summary: Response to Previous Review about Ingredients
review/text: Hi Troy, I want to apologize that nobody from Octavia Tea responded to your request for information!  I work for Octavia Tea, and it appears that we did not receive your email.<br /><br />Octavia Tea specializes in certified organic teas, which means all of the ingredients (teas, herbs, flowers, fruits, pure essential oils and natural flavors) we use must meet rigorous demands for quality and purity.  Certified Organic products are free from chemicals, antibiotics, synthetic hormones, genetic modifications and sewage sludge, and are minimally processed without artificial ingredients or preservatives in order to maintain the integrity of the food and preserve the environment.<br /><br />The rules are so strict, in fact, that certain ingredients and flavors that considered "natural" are not natural enough to be approved for use in organic products.  Therefore, our Pomegranate White Tea is one of the purest forms of tea available.  It is made from only 5 basic ingredients:  100% organic white tea, 100% organic rise hips, 100% organic hibiscus, 100% organic safflower petals and natural (organic approved) pomegranate flavor. The natural flavors used in Certified Organic products must meet strict requirements put forth by the National Organic Program (NOP).  We must obtain documentation from our flavor suppliers to verify that the flavors and pure essential oils used in some of our teas are non-synthetic and have not been produced using artificial preservatives or synthetic solvents.  Fortunately, buying Certified Organic Products means that nothing can be hidden.<br /><br />We sell our teas to many customers with allergies.  Therefore, all of the ingredients used in this tea are printed on the product label.<br /><br />If this response does not answer your questions, I encourage you to call the toll-free number (listed on our website) so we can provide you with the answers you need.  We are a small business with a limited office staff, but our customers are important to us and we try to respond to every phone call we receive.  I hope this information helps!

review/summary: Natural Flavors?
review/text: I was very disappointed in this product and the people that make it. Why? I recently ordered a substantial order of this "organic" tea. When I received it and read the labels, it stated "natural flavors" were added to the "organic" tea to give it its flavor. We have multiple allergy's in our home and have discovered that many things are hidden in those words, so I contacted the company to inquire about what it was and they never replied to my email. I don't know about you, but when something is hidden, you have the tendency to not respond. If, in deed, the contents were "organic" and good, you would have no problem explaining what they are. To everyone looking for good tea...I advise, keep looking.<br />The above statement is only one mans opinion, but I would like to think it is an educated one.

review/summary: Good, but not what I expected
review/text: I'm not a coffee snob but I do enjoy high quality coffee.  This is a high quality coffee, but the description says "medium", which I thought was a medium roast.  It's actually a blend of dark and medium to medium/light beans, with mostly darker roasted beans.  There's nothing wrong with that, but I was expecting an all around medium roast.  So you'll get a lot of that dark, earthy flavor if you enjoy that.  I've been trending to prefer medium to medium/light roasts.<br />I've been making this coffee in my Bunn Velocity Brew machine, and when brewed this way, at least to me, a lot of the flavors are muted.  It could be the machine's fault, because it's designed to brew coffee in 3 minutes, and maybe this blend needs a full 4 minutes to extract all the flavor.  It was only when I made espresso with my Gaggia machine that I finally was able to extract all the delicious flavors in this blend, which are flavors more reminiscent of dark roasts (earthy, cocoa).<br />So, while I bought this to make regular coffee, it makes a much better espresso, even americano.  Brew it this way if you can.

review/summary: Three kicking sisters
review/text: I concur with the positive reviews about this coffee blend.<br /><br />I'm generally wary of medium blends, unless I know the region mix well enough.  Overall, it's a sure bet.  The medley of Indonesian, Central and South American beans, guarantees a light, medium and dark roast roller-coaster in every sip. This is a very even, all-around smooth blend, that's highly drinkable any time of the day -- or night ; ).<br /><br />If you can adjust the coffee-to-water ratio according to your liking before the brew cycle, you'll be able to even accentuate or lessen the "kick" these three sisters pack per cup.  Don't think twice about buying this blend.  It'll be your new favorite for quite some time.

It is a great full flavored coffee.[[ASIN:B001SJR5EQ Kicking Horse Coffee Three Sisters Medium, Whole Bean Coffee

review/summary: Consistently good cup of coffee!
review/text: This is a blend of beans from 3 regions and 3 different roasts in one container. I have processed the beans from coarse to espresso grounds and brewed with French Press & mocha & espresso makers.<br />I get a consistent and balanced cup from these beans!  I can drink this anytime and like it with food. It is not a blend worthy of hyperbole and outrageous price, and that is what appeals to me! I want a good quality blend, from a respectable source at a reasonable price! KH Three Sisters fits that want and I subscribe to a regular delivery as a result! BTW, I have tried several other KH offerings and like their Cliff Hanger espresso blend too! KH coffees are well received in my clan at special occasions too!

review/text: This coffee, as others have stated, is simply incredible.<br /><br />I drink my coffee black, so flavor balance is a must.  This coffee is smooth and roasted just right to keep it from tasting even remotely acidic.  It is a god-send in the morning when I get to work (purchased this for the shop), as it gets me up-and-at-'em with just the right amount of caffeine.  My co-workers love it too!<br /><br />We'll definitely be buying more when we run out (in fact, the boss has added it to the biweekly purchase list)!

It is a nice breakfast coffee, not too bold and definitely not weak.  As a bonus, it is organic, fair trade, and roasted in North America (Canada).  I will be buying this again with the subscribe and save and free 2 day shipping with amazon prime.

review/summary: Delicious coffee!
review/text: I recently got obsessed with making the perfect cup of coffee (as obsessed as a poor college student can be anyway). First I tried a dark roast from 8 o'clock coffees and next I tried this one. The difference is huge. Using a french press and electric grinder I could get the dark roast to taste pretty good but I'd always need creamer to balance out the flavor. With this coffee I actually enjoy drinking it black, which is something I've never been able to say about a coffee before. I still use a little creamer but that's just a preference thing, it's good either way. If you're just getting into making awesome coffee then I strongly suggest trying this. It's much better than anything you'll buy pre-ground at the store.<br /><br />I've only made it using a french press (another thing I strongly suggest to new coffee enthusiasts) so refer to other reviews for how well it tastes using drip brewing methods.

review/summary: O.K. but not Great
review/text: As a daily coffee drinker who prefers the usual Starbucks blends (except for the awful Pike Roast), I wanted to give this blend a shot. As the reviews describe, this blend is a "medium" roast apparently with a mixed bag of beans. After several months of having Kicking Horse in my morning coffee rotation, I would say it is OK but not up to the standard set by our friends in Seattle (again except for Pike Roast). If given a choice between KH and Pike, I'd choose the Kicking Horse.......but that is perhaps only faint praise. For me its three stars at most.

review/text: I prefer organic coffee and have tried many different brands carried by health food stores.  As Amazon.com adds more and more items to their site, I'm inclined to try even more brands.  I decided to try Kick Ass Three Sisters Medium Roast this order.  I'm glad I did. I prefer my coffee rich tasting but without that burned or bitter after taste many coffees have, especially non-organic, grocery store-type coffees.  This coffee works perfectly for the one 20 oz cup coffee I drink each morning.  I fresh grind the beans then.<br /><br />I will try other brands Amazon.com sells since I haven't already tried them.  However, I simply love this coffee and may have to stick with it.<br /><br />Now if Amazon.com would just use shippers other than USPS for their subscription programs so I could take advantage of those . . .

review/summary: Best organic formula!
review/text: In our opinion (maybe you don't agree), Similac Organic formula is the best organic formula brand out there. Second is Earth's best (there is just a non-appealing taste and smell to this one). My 7 month old had to be on formula since birth and he absolutely loves the Similac brand. We love that we can recycle the tub and scooper once were done. It's a bit expensive so we buy in bulk (you will pay a pretty penny at Babies-R-Us for a single tub). So far, the vendors we've found on Amazon that sell 6 tubs in a box have been excellent in delivering on time. Also, you will notice on majority of Similac tubs the expiration date is 2 to 3 years out meaning that the formula is mostly fresh. Thank you Similac! It would be nice to see a more extensive baby organic food line from them...Who knows?! Hopefully the company is reading this!

review/summary: Leaves a residue in bottle
review/text: The organic version of Similac Advance leaves a residue in the bottle and nipples. It also has a slightly nasty smell. We did not have any issues with the regular version. If you want something organic, I recommend Earth Best.

review/summary: Garbage
review/text: I have to completely disagree with a previous poster who said that Earth's Best has an unappealing smell and taste compared to Similac Organic. Similac Organic tastes terrible, and smells like spoiled milk when mixed. If you're wanting a quality organic formula, go with Earth's Best. My baby has terrible gas on Similac Organic, and the only reason we buy this, is when we've run out of Earth's Best and have to order more and are in a pinch. Furthermore, Similac Organic doesn't dissolve and leaves a very nasty residue on the inside of the bottle and nipple. It's gross if you ask me. I gave it more than two stars only because it's tolerable.

review/text: My two cats did not like this stuff at all. I thought I would treat them to a more pricey organic food and they would love me for it...not so...one looked at me like I was nuts...she wouldn't go near it, the other gave it a try and barfed right in the bowl. The chicken and brown rice had a very fishy smell, not good. Sorry Paul, great dressings but the cats give you a thumbs down.

review/summary: The cat, the dog, nor the grackles would touch it
review/text: I bought a can of this for the novelty of seeing how my cat would react to a can of cat food that cost almost a buck fifty.  He's normally not a picky eater and routinely eats canned Friskies or 9-Lives.  I opened the can and placed the contents into a clean feeding bowl and presented it to him in his normal feeding place on the counter (up away from the dog).  He took a sniff and recoiled from it.  I then offered him a can of his regular food that he happily ate.  Well, that didn't go well.  So I then offered it to our Lab/Golden mix, a dog that loves nothing more than snapping up the cat's food if it is left within her reach.  One sniff and she jerked her head back from it and walked away.  Next step was to fling it out into the back yard where the grackles (an omnivorous bird common to South Texas) scavenge for moldy bread, pizza bones, stale chips and pretty much anything else we toss out.  Nope, the grackles wouldn't touch it either.  But the fire ants love it.  They are all over it and within a few days it will be gone.

review/summary: Nasty Stuff
review/text: This stuff is pretty nasty. I live in a household with two cats. I supplement their diets with wet food and thought I'd make the change to a organic brand.<br /><br />First of all, this stuff turned my stomach upon opening it. It smells disgusting, like something died in the can. The consistency was gross too. This stuff was sloppy and fibrous. It looked like spoiled tuna salad and smelt even worse. I thought it had possibly gone bad but the date on the can indicates that it's still quite good and nowhere near the expiration date.<br /><br />I really shouldn't have given this to my cat but I gave him a portion of it (not the whole can) to see how he took to it. He actually did eat it very happily, gluttonously in fact... But he was ill after and the remnants of this come up all over the kitchen floor. That's the first time I've ever had this happen when sampling a new food.<br /><br />I think I'm going to stick to my usual brand. This stuff was not worth it! I am very disappointed and quite disgusted.

review/summary: None of the five cats will eat it
review/text: I looked closley to see what the stars meant with one meaning "I hate it." I. personally, do not eat it, but none of my 6 kitties,including 2 ferals (last time I wrote, I had only one feral, but now have two and neither feral will eat this. They may be wild and not let a human close to them, but they know their cat food tastes. Two stars means "I don't like it, and since I am the one doing the buying, I figure it is OK if I state that that "I don'tlike it" because I do not like buying something that the 6 cats that I feed will not eat it. I feed the ferals outside the back door and I can watch them "eat or not eat" by watching through the window. My kitties always announce the arrival of the ferals by jumping up and down at the window when my regular "orange and white kitty" and my "sometimes I deign to eat here 'black and white Kitty'" arrive for dinner! My, My, What an exciting life I have!!!...The high point of my evening being watching the ferals eat and then writing a review of their eating habits up on Amazon!<br />Anyway, I have made it clear as to how I keep tabs of the ferals and their eating habits. The inside kitties are pretty easy to manage. When trying a new variety of food (new to us) I just put that bowl in the kitchen where "the special eating" bowls go. Dry food and water are in the kitchen and whatever "speciality of the evening" is also located there. No, they do not get a new flavor every night! But one bowl goes there so they always go "aLookin" in the kitchen area for their night's extra bowl of wet food! Spoiled???  Yes!!!! Then I know if it is eaten or not. The specialty bowl gets 3 nights of trial...not in a row...to avoid "nose sticker uppers." But kitties know a wet bowl is always placed alongside the water and the dry in the kitchen. Water and dry are also located elsewhere, but the kitchen ONLY gets the wet nightly special got trial/accuracy purposes. Nothing is TOO much for the trial and accuracy information for Amazon!<br />It has been 3 weeks now with the Newman Chicken and Brown Rice. There is no question. None of my cats eat it. Not even the birds seem to care for it...or any other animal...as the birds generally eat the dried out left overs and if the bowl is chewed to death, it means a coyote has been by, but I haven't had any coyotes all winter.(Somebody is putting out vittles more to their liking somewhere else, or they have gone further south this winter.<br />So, there, my friends, is how I ended up at this choice of stars for Chicken and Brown Rice Rice Formula Newman's Own. Oddly enough, everyone likes the beef and brown rice:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BXT278">Newman's Own Organics Adult Variety Pack Canned Cat Food</a>, but that is a whole "nother" story for a different time.<br />Sorry that we have a disappointing story to tell: Gabby, Trinity, Wisdom, Mercy, Orange and White Kitty and Black and White Kitty...as told to and documented by "Cindy O". Bye for now on the cat food trail tale until we "come upon" something else good ole mom thinks should be tried.

review/summary: Multi Cat Family - All Of Them Love Newman's Own Pet Food
review/text: We switched to Newman's Own dry and wet food several years ago. We have noticed a huge difference in our pets. Yes, we have cats and dogs all who are rescues. Because of their early history, many have health issues. Since switching them to Newman's Own most have leveled out and we spend less time at the Vet. The food cost less in the long run, because of better health for your animals. We also noticed that all of our animals love this product. Some of them like the dry better than the wet and vis-versa. Some of ours where picky eaters and needed to gain weight. Not anymore, they all show up for dinner eager and ready to eat.<br />My brother-in-law has a 14 year old Siamese who was on Science Diet Food for diabetes. He looked like he was on his last leg, the cat not my brother-in-law. Anyway, we started supplementing his food with Newman's Own and I swear the cat looks 2 years younger. He is more active, his eyes have cleared up, and he has lost weight. The vet is amazed as well, as his sugar levels are better. I am not suggesting anyone use this food as a replacement for what a Vet has suggested. But if you have an animal who is not responding well, it is worth a try to add this product to their diet.

review/summary: Cat loves the flavor
review/text: Kitty loves it! Happily eats 1/2 can in one setting (13.5 lbs cat), 2-3 times a day. His fur does look fluffier after 2 months on this food and he seems more content and alert. Wet food does make him urinate more (he used to get a dry/wet mix of Urinary SO prescription diet), but I am glad, because this should help to keep his urinary tract healthy.<br /><br />I researched various options before settling on this one. Among other brands (wet food only), he wouldn't even touch "Organix;" he likes "Evo" fine, but not as much as Newman's own and leaves one-third of food uneatten in the bowl. As far as other flavors of Newman's own, he didn't like the Brown rice flavor (too much rice--the cat kept picking out individual grains out of his food one by one), and strangely, after eating a few cans of store-bought Chicken&Salmon flavor, he refused to eat the same flavor from Amazon.

review/summary: Excellent product... until Amazon ships it!
review/text: I want to start  by saying that if I was reviewing the food alone, it would get 5 stars easily.  It's a quality product and my picky eater cat (as in, he would literally rather go hungry for days on end than be coaxed into eating something he doesn't like) loves it.<br /><br />Having said that, I won't buy this (or any other canned product for that matter) from Amazon.com anymore, unless they were to significantly change their packaging method. Normally I only review a product all on its own because other factors are incidental, but this time it seemed fitting to comment on shipping too because it drastically affected the overall quality of the product and is an unavoidable part of getting it to any customer.<br /><br />The product arrives in a small cardboard flat with 2 layers of 12 cans each, then the whole thing is shrink-wrapped in plastic.  Then they put it in a shipping box and put 3 air pillows on top.  Exactly 1/2 of the cans arrived dented (the entire bottom tier of the flat), many of them so badly that it looked like they had been run over by a car.<br /><br />Amazon.com customer service is great and responsive - they shipped the replacement out with complimentary next-day shipping... and it arrived in exactly the same condition.  In the end, I got everything I paid for, but 1. do I want to go through this every time I order it? No.  And 2. it's hugely wasteful because of course the dented cans are unusable because the seal could be compromised, offering the perfect breeding ground for botulism.<br /><br />I can fairly say that this is typcial for canned products in general from Amazon, too.  I've gotten black beans, kidney beans, chick peas, tomato sauce, and tomato paste from them, and there wasn't one order among them that didn't have the same problem.  Again, customer service was great and sent quick replacements (again with a high damage rate), but it's not worth the hassle and waste.  If it ever occurs to them to pad the entire order and not just the top of it, I'll return to using them because the free shipping and convenience of subscription auto-order (and subsequent additional savings) really are nice.

review/text: *Note to Amazon.com,<br /><br />Pretty please put this Liver on Subscribe and Save! You have the beef & liver and the beef available for S&S but not the Liver yet. THANK YOU SO MUCH!<br /><br />Now on to my review...<br /><br />My cat has been slowly switching to Newman's own beef products over from Wellness brand cat food (which is a great brand and will still be reserved for treats occasionally). I was ecstatic that there was a totally NO grain-and-NO fillers ORGANIC cat food I could feed my 9 year old cat who is prone to crystal formation in his bladder and also plaque build up on his teeth (even though I brush his outer teeth every evening).<br /><br />So far I've tried the beef & Liver and the Liver and he LOVES it. I just ordered the beef today for him which I'm sure he'll love too.<br /><br />This product *IS* very thick and concentrated (the beef liver alone has the consistency of a concentrated pate' and the beef & liver has the consistency of a gelatinous, thick beefy oatmeal), so I scoop it into his bowl and blend a bit of hot water to the product to warm the fats and make more of a 'gravy' for him (he also prefers to eat his food a bit warm anyhow). He barely wants to nibble at his Wellness brand cat food now (which I've had him on for over four years, so I guess that means he's one 'sold' cat. It might be unusual for a cat to love beef so much but my cat goes crazy for beef (especially if I make him steak when I can afford to). So, for me to find him a organic, no grain, beef based line of cat food made his day (and one of his nine lives no doubt)!<br /><br />Anyway, if you know your cat already loves beef and beef liver then he/she will probably be just peachy keen with this product.<br /><br />Here is the ingredients list for Newman's own canned beef cat products:<br /><br />Beef:<br /><br />Organic Beef, Organic Beef Broth, Minerals (Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Carbonate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Iodate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin A, E, E, D3, B12 and K Supplements, Choline, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Biotin).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein..................12.0% (min)<br />Crude Fat.........................4.5% (min)<br />Crude Fiber......................1.0% (max)<br />Moisture.........................82.0% (max)<br />Ash.................................1.0% (max)<br />Magnesium.....................0.02% (max)<br />Taurine..........................0.07% (min)<br /><br />CALORIC VALUE:<br /><br />As fed (Kcal/3oz can)...........156<br /><br />Liver:<br /><br />Organic Beef Liver, Organic Liver Broth, Minerals (Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Carbonate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Iodate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin A, E, E, D3, B12 and K Supplements, Choline, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Biotin).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein..................11.0% (min)<br />Crude Fat.........................2.5% (min)<br />Crude Fiber......................1.0% (max)<br />Moisture.........................83.0% (max)<br />Ash.................................1.5% (max)<br />Magnesium.....................0.02% (max)<br />Taurine..........................0.07% (min)<br /><br />CALORIC VALUE:<br /><br />As fed (Kcal/12oz can)...........129<br /><br />Beef & Liver:<br /><br />Organic Beef, Organic Beef Liver, Organic Beef Broth, Minerals (Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Carbonate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Iodate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin A, E, E, D3, B12 and K Supplements, Choline, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Biotin).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein..................10.0% (min)<br />Crude Fat.........................3.0% (min)<br />Crude Fiber......................1.0% (max)<br />Moisture.........................82.0% (max)<br />Ash.................................1.0% (max)<br />Magnesium.....................0.02% (max)<br />Taurine..........................0.07% (min)<br /><br />CALORIC VALUE:<br /><br />As fed (Kcal/12oz can)...........140<br /><br />Here's to Kitty's health!

review/text: I have two special needs cats.  One is very small and could stand to gain weight.  The other is too large and needs to loose weight.<br /><br />The smaller cat likes this food. The overweight cat does not over eat on the food, which is a plus for us.<br /><br />We tried Wellness, C&P Organix, Innova Evo (they loved the dry food), Pet Promise, the Whole Foods brand and a few others.  Our cats did not like those brands of food.  Some they wouldn't even eat.<br /><br />They prefer the chicken and salmon brand to the other Newman's Own canned cat food flavors.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Organic<br />* Peace of mind for the cat owner<br />* Liked by cats with 'special needs'<br />* Preferred over other brands by two very different cats<br />* When I open some canned cat foods, the smell nauseates me. The smell of this brand doesn't have the same effect.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* None that I can think of<br /><br />Bottom line:  This is a good organic canned cat food.  Cats differ in their food preferences.  It's a good idea to give this one a try.  By the way, for a while, one or more of the flavors were only available in the smaller cans.  If that is still the case, you may want to try those flavors as well.

review/text: This is the only food my cat will eat.  She is very picky.  Since eating this better, organic food exclusively, she has had much better health.  (She is quite an old cat.)  For some reason the "Turkey Formula" flavor is her favorite.  If I try out a different food, she runs up and down the hallway yelling, until I give her "Newman's Own" canned (turkey flavor) food again.  (I never try out new foods with her anymore.)  :)  Must be good stuff!  BTW:  I also add in fresh organic greens and green powders for her too.  She loves it!

review/summary: Newman makes nutritious pet food
review/text: It is sad to see people rating on a pet food product based on whether or not their pet likes the taste, but not based on the ingredient of the good. When their cat doesn't eat, they give one star. When their cat loves to eat, regardless of the nutrition of the food, they give 5 stars. It is unfair to the manufacturer. Unfortunately, this seems like the trend of pet food rating.<br /><br />Newman always make good healthy and nutritious pet food. They contains no corn gluten, animal by-products, etc that will be harmful to cats. Yes, they are pricey because they are organic. Once a while Amazon runs a promotion on Newman's Organic cat food, and it will be the good timing to stock them up.

review/summary: Wonderful!!
review/text: My 15 year-old cat was on a special diet for digestive problems and she also has diabetes.  When she stopped eating her usual special-formula food, I tried about 10 different kinds of catfood, and this was the only one she liked.  It is easy on her digestion and doesn't interfere with her diabetes. Thank you, Newman's Own!!

review/text: My indoor cats were initially wary - but the third time I served it, they ate it with relish - and have ever since.  The outdoor cats [all volunteers, now neutered] took to it right away.

review/text: ALL my cats like this food...and I normally can't say that! No menadione bisulfite complex (also known as synthetic Vitamin K) in this formula either.

review/summary: My cat's favorite
review/text: My cat is prone to Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease, and needed a good quality canned cat food to prevent blockages. Newman's was the first I tried, and he loves all of the flavors except the Beef and Beef and Liver.<br /><br />I recently tried to switch him to Wellness, which is grain-free, and smells much better. But instead of cleaning his plate like he does with Newman's, half the can of food was left untouched. So I'm now subscribing to Newman's because I think it's a great deal for organic cat food (which Wellness is not) even if it has grains. I guess my cat just likes grains!<br /><br />I recommend this food, but keep in mind that cats are finicky (well, most cats anyway). Buy one or two trial cans before committing to a 24-pack!

review/summary: 3 for chicken& brown rice- 0 for beef flavor
review/text: Both of my cats like the chicken & brown rice and Newman's dry food flavors which I buy when they are heavily discounted. Neither of them would touch the beef flavor I bought on a gold box special. It has a faded milky slightly greenish pale brown hue, not medium brown as one would expect and oddly not much of an odor (I know why complain about that, but my point is is should have some type of aroma or odor to it.) Because of the color I did not donate it or feed it to the strays as I think it may be a bad batch. The reason for the 3 stars is for chicken & rice is at the price point there are better organic cat food values that do not contain so much brown rice. I like Organix and By Nature ingredients and my cats do too. Sometimes I'll buy Natural Value or Natural Balance canned foods since they offer more variety of flavors.

review/summary: Good quality food, but Amazon's ingredient listing is incorrect
review/text: We have a cat with a liver problem who needs a low-purine diet.  As a result, we are trying to switch her off of her Wellness food and find poultry alternatives that do not contain any organ meat.<br /><br />The ingredients listed on the site are accurate except that they exclude "chicken liver" as the second ingredient in the chicken and brown rice food and "turkey liver" as the second ingredient in the turkey and vegetable food.  Thus, I just bought two cases of food that will not meet my cat's needs at all!<br /><br />Other than that, it seems to be a high quality food.  It is a pate-style food with a meaty, but not unpleasant odor.  Cats ate it right away when offered.  Will be donating ours to the local animal shelter, where I am sure it will be loved!

review/summary: Worth the Price
review/text: Sure it costs a bit more, but all five (yes, cinco gatos!) of my cats love it.  Plus it's organic so you know you are feeding them the best and you know it's good for the earth.<br /><br />Has the brown rice grains around the outside of the can which is great because it allows the food to easily slip out of the can onto your kitty's plate.  No wated food left sticking to the sides to scrape out.

review/summary: Super high quality for the ones you love
review/text: Besides the fact that it's the only food my fussy bunch of four agree they like...there are other reasons why I love Newman's Own. Check the label.  The first, and most abundant ingredient is organic turkey.  In fact, ALL of the ingredients are organic.  When others pets were sadly dying from contaminated food connected to China, I could rest assured my cats were OK.  Again, check the label...Newman's Own meets the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO...a factor my vet cautioned me on when I went looking for a high quality food. Finally, I buy it because Paul & Nell Newman produce a great line of products.  If you want to treat yourself, pick up a package of Newman's Own Organic Cookies.  It doesn't matter if you go for the Newman O's or the Orange Chocolate Chip Cookies...they're all terrific.

review/summary: My cat wouldn't eat the beef
review/text: This is the first catfood I've had in a can that didn't smell strong of aromas when I opened it, and perhaps that is why the cat wouldn't eat it.  Catfood is notorious for having artificial aromas added to attract finicky cats.  This stuff is all organic and even when hungry, the cat just walked away from it.<br /><br />So the case I bought for the cat literally went to the dogs, who all gave this stuff two paws up.  The dogs saw the small cans as special treats and would woolf it down fast.

review/summary: Fresh & natural
review/text: Great product.  Even my very picky kitty (has digestive problems)liked this flavor.  She always loves salmon-flavored wet food but not usually chicken-flavored wet food, so I was apprehensive about her reaction.  It took her a few days, but she got to like it (not love it).  It looks different from the wet food we're used to, but that's apparently due to the lack of artificial preservatives.  Also, I feel good about buying it since proceeds go to charity.
