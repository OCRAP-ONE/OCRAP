review/text: I am I picky foodie, and this is maybe the best sauce I have ever purchased. It isn't too hot or sweet, nothing like I had anticipated when it was recommended to me. It is sooooo good over cream cheese on crackers like recommended. Try it over baked chicken with melted brie. Mmmmmmm! Totally worth the cost.

review/summary: Amazing Taste and Gluten Free Too
review/text: I love this stuff!  It's a little hot, but not too hot and nicely balanced with the sweetness of the raspberry.  There's a smokey undertone to it that just finishes it off nicely.  It's terrific on broiled shrimp and chicken as well as making a good dipping sauce for all sorts of things.  I've tasted other sauces LIKE this, but none with as good a blance of flavors.  You have to try this stuff; it's addictive.  Best of all, it's gluten free and uses apple cider vinegar.

review/text: I am a grits addict. These aren't going to be like the grits you get at your favorite soul food restaurant in the south, but it's satisfying enough, especially for its convenience.  Plus, its instant grits or no grits at all where I live.<br />Each packet is only 100 calories, and has enough flavor that I usually don't add anything (even original is tasty on its own).<br />Won't keep you full for very long, so I suggest adding a lil protein or fruit to your breakfast.<br />Otherwise, its what I wanted and expected.

review/text: Pretty good sampling of their standard flavors.  I believe the only flavors missing are the ham ones (Gravy & Ham and Ham & Cheese), which I'd love to try.<br /><br />The bacon flavor is good, but the bacon is a little odd.  Cheddar Cheese is the best, and Butter is good, too.  Plus, each pack (12 per box) is only 100 calories.  Good for a warm snack when you're feeling nibbly.<br /><br />My only real complaint is that I'd rather they ditched the original flavor and replaced it with something more interesting.

review/text: Growing up in the north and having naturally eclectic tastes I tried these grits years ago on a family vacation in the south. My family has loved them for years but they aren't available where i live, well only in butter and original in certain stores. I love the cheese and the bacon is to die for. Now I have more grits than I could feed an elephant and I am happy! They are warm, salty, creamy,buttery, bacony, cheesy, corny goodness. I have been known to add extra cheese, bacon or butter for an even more decadent meal or snack. Only complaint: I wish the variety had more bacon packets and included ham and cheese and red eye gravy varieties. Otherwise, I am very happy. Way to go Amazon and Quaker!

review/summary: great deal on a quality licorice that grows on you
review/text: Good tasting, nice firm texture, dutch licorice.  Not over powering salty, less so than Zout drops, but much more flavorful.  For me, the harder the licorice, the better.  So I open all the packages as soon as I get them, dump them in a big box and let them set as long as I can before devouring.  On initial purchase and viewing pictures of the product, I was afraid this might be a softer and sweeter licorice - but luckily it wasn't.  I was pleasantly surprised with this licorice and now I'm a repeat buyer of this product.  Me and my German relatives love this licorice as well as salmiak pastillen, coins, katjes katzen.

review/text: Being from NYC, the international hub, we find everything and anything from around the world here.  It's only a buck a stick at my local international store so of course I had to try it.<br /><br />First reaction mouth to candy contact.  Chew Chew Chew... WTH?  They must've put in the wrong flavor because this tastes just like regular white mint Mentos!  Ten chews later.... ahhh...  a bit of licorice flavor, it's nice, not strong at all, just the essence of licorice.  Here comes the weird part.  Ten more chews and it starts to get SALTY!? LOL...  Now we have this savory licorice with a dash of mint going on in my mouth.  It's odd.  Goes on for the life of the candy, about one minute of chewing.  It was such an odd taste.  Last reaction was... OK, I need another one! Repeat until pack is finished!<br /><br />Sounds like fiction doesn't it?  I assure you this is exactly how this candy goes down.  I usually like a stronger licorice but this was, "different" in a good way.  Mentos,.. you've done it again!

review/text: I wanted something to snack on in between meals, so I bought some of this trail mix. I'm not familiar with the brand, but I must say this is some of the best trail mix I've had in a while. It has just the right balance of saltiness and sweetness. They didn't skimp on the dried fruit like some other mixes I've had (although I wish it had more almonds :). On its own, the coconut is kind of tasteless but there isn't much of it so it wasn't a problem for me. And as some one else mentioned, it's healthier than cookies. Also, it comes in resealable packages, so if you're on the go its convenient to just grab one and throw it in your purse/bag. Overall, definitely recommended if you like fruit and nut trail mixes.

review/summary: Really Good Trail Mix
review/text: I was not familiar with this brand but decided to give it a try because of the reasonable price.  It is excellent.  The fruit and nuts are fresh and the mix of fruit and nuts is perfect for my taste.  It includes the large slices of coconut which I really like in a trail mix as well as many other kinds of fruit.  The pumpkin seeds are an interesting addition with a very mild flavor.  None of the fruits or nuts overwhelm the others.  All in all this is a really good blend at a great price.

review/summary: Too much sweetner :(
review/text: I was pretty excited about ordering this particular brand, since I'm a big fan of trail mix, and I had never tried the Harmony brand before. I can tell you now, after tasting, that there is way too much sweetener added to the fruits. I'm not understanding why extra sugar is needed, on top of the natural fruit taste. Some of the fruit is powdered so much, it tastes like a chewy piece of sugar. I read the reviews before ordering this product, and was aware of extra sweetener, but I wanted to give it a chance. I wish I hadn't, lol. There are plenty of raisins and peanuts. A few almonds sprinkled in, and (when you can actually find them) sunflower seeds. I'll be passing the additional bags on to family and friends.

review/text: The trail mix is delicious.  We took some on a road trip and it was a healthy snack we could enjoy in the car.<br />The only recommendation I have to improve the mix is to make the pieces of coconut larger.  I am a coconut lover.<br />Otherwise I think the mixture is a nice blend of dried fruit and nuts. I was impressed with the variety of trail mixes on<br />Amazon.<br /><br />Amazon Verified Purchase

review/summary: A bit on the boring side
review/text: The Good: 10oz bag (leave one at the office, one at the home office, one in my bag etc) and the resealable bag to retain existing freshness, not too heavy on the preservatives.  The Bad or Blah: a boring mix....the coconut (in most of my bags) was pulverized to the point one couldn't just take a bit of a piece of coconut (think flat bits, not shredded, but tiny), I prefer a variety of sizes in my dried fruits whereas the papaya pieces were all perfectly squared....and the pumpkin kernels were tasty, but some of the smallest I've ever seen.  Would I buy this again or suggest to my friends?  Probably not.

review/summary: Not as flavorful as I had imagined!
review/text: I guess I had too high a hope for this little cake.  I found it to be quite dry and lacking in nuts.  The cinnamon flavor was really rich and delicious though.  I will not ever buy it again but you should give it a try since it is so cheap and you can get it as 'one' instead of the usual multiples that Amaazon sells.  It was a unique flavor for a one time trial so I am glad I bought it but I don't need to repeat that mistake again.  Maybe the one I got was old though the expiration date was fine.  I love cinnamon so that made it worth actually eating along with a whole cup of tea to wash it down.  I say....give it a try like I did.

It's an dense eleven inch log, and I prefer my cinnamon pastries to be fluffier and sweeter. It's solidness made it good with ice cream, but of course that ups the decadence level.<br /><br />I purchased this as part of a $25 (or more of course, I managed to make spend just over $25) order using Amazon's Add-on program which meant that shipping was free. The items in the Add-on program are all inexpensive, mostly interesting food items so part of the fun was selecting what to try.

review/summary: Excellent quality, great price!
review/text: This is some seriously good pasta.  I've seen this at my local supermarket, but the cost per package is about 50% more than the price here.  I've ordered a few different varieties from Amazon, and they're all wonderful.<br /><br />The Fiesta (tri color) fettuccine is one of my favorites for cream sauces and for lighter "non-chunky" mixtures (like a nice bright pesto or sun-dried tomato toss).<br /><br />One of the biggest advantages is the time it takes to prepare -- this is NOT like the hard dried pasta you find among the cheaper store brands.  This stuff really takes only 3-5 minutes (tops!) to cook to al dente.  It's that fast.  And the flavor!  Wow!  It tastes like the best fresh pasta you can find.  The packages are 12 oz, but you end up with about the same amount of cooked pasta as you would from a 16-oz package of the cheap stuff.<br /><br />I'm sold -- and will continue to buy this stuff from Amazon as long as they carry it.

You mix this with sour cream and mayo, so you could save calories by using low fat varities. It's a good buy here as well, as I couldn't find any cheaper than $3 a package online. Enjoy! :)

Thank goodness they are here on Amazon and you can buy them in bulk AND get a discount for signing up for a subscription.  I adore the tin tiger cases, which hold up to being tossed around my purse and stay shut so the mints don't all dump out at the bottom of my purse.  Anyway, I'm a repeat buyer, and totally recommend if you like cinnamon!

review/summary: Jello Pumkin Spice Pudding is WOW!!!!
review/text: I found this Jello Pumpkin Spice pudding in clearance after Christmas at my local gorcery store.  I didn't know Jello made pumpkin pudding, but I grabbed all of the pudding they had because it was 38 cents each and went home and tried it and fell madly in love.  When I make pumpkin pie, I double the spices the recipe calls for and even add more cinamin because I love it.  This pudding is exactly how I make pumpkin pie.  I love tasting the spices in the pudding and Jello made a fantastic pudding, the problem is that the stores I have gone to have the same pudding all the time (chocolate, vanilla, pastachio and butterscotch) and they don't sell the other Jello puddings and now that Christmas is over there is no pumpkin pudding to be found.  I want to buy this stuff in bulk because I love pumpkin and will eat it year round. Try this pumpkin pudding.  You will love it.

This is pretty much one of the greatest pumpkin based items I've ever had save one thing.  Why, Jello?  Why?  Why did you put SO much cinnamon in this stuff?  It's *almost* enough to ruin it, but not quite.  The fantastic pumpkin flavoring is enough to overwhelm the overuse of the cinnamon, but let this be a lesson on any future editions of this pudding, cut the cinnamon by about half and you have a 5-star product on your hands.

review/text: I'm a real fan of iced coffee and was looking forward to this K-cup flavor. What a disappointment! No matter how it was prepared and no matter what was added to it, it simply tasted awful. Letting another flavor cool and then add ice would make a far better cup of iced coffee.

review/summary: Not what you are looking for.
review/text: If you have ever had Douwe Egberts Kona Blend coffee at a restaurant you know how smooth and delicious it is. I did and have hunted for that taste ever since. For anyone, like me, thinking you had found it, continue to seek. This is not bad coffee, (that is why I gave it 2 stars) it just does not have the flavor of the restaurant variety DE Kona blend. If that is what you desire, do not spend your money here. This has no more flavor than a pot of Folgers.

review/text: Bought a box of these tasty morsels at a local German grocery. They are freaking delicious. The potatoes are super easy to make, nothing but a pan required. They taste like a cross between breakfast potatoes and scalloped potatoes. Add a little cheese and pepper and you are loving life. One box serves about two people. Much cheaper on amazon than in a store.

review/summary: One of my family's favorite snacks
review/text: We have tried several brands of dried apple chips, crisps... and this is out favorite.  Some are too dry or leathery, and I find another popular brand to airy (for lack of a better word).  These are just right; crip without being tough.  It is great to find a snack which feels like a treat, which has no harmful ingredient, and beyond that is actually healthy.  My kids love them and so do I (though I always feel guilty when I take a bag, thinking I am stealing their treats).  Now I do not have to have the guilt anymore, not with a 60 bags on the way!<br />The price/ bag is literally 1/4 of what we pay for these in the supermarket! I generally wait for them to go on sale an then I stock up (though, it seems never enough as they disappear rather quickly).  Amazon's price on the bulk (60 bag) box is so reasonable that these can go in the lunch box every day!  I am much happier being able to send these into school than just about any other "treat" I can think of.<br />I do not have a bag in front of me no, so I can not list all the nutritional information.  These do have sugar (which the original chips do not).  The cinnamon is natural (they taste like apple slices dipped in cinnamon sugar) so if you are trying to avoid sugar yourself, or for your kids you might want to look at the original chips.  These *do not* however have high fructuse corn syrup, trifats, sulphur, or any weird ingredients.  They really are natural in the true sense of the word which is something increasingly difficult to find.<br /><br />I revisited my review after noting that the size of the bag is different from what I have bought in the market.  The bags we buy are 2.4 oz which usually cost $4 retail or $2 when trhey are on sale.  This still makes this a very good deal, but not what I had originally thought (given that you are getting 1/3 as much).  One thing that puzzles me though is that these are listed as 100 calorie packs.  The 2.4 oz bags list a calorie count of 140.  if the nutritional information is accurate that would mean the proportion of sugar to apples is high in the calorie count packs.  that does not make any sense to me (that they would put more sugar in the calorie count packs) but I can only recount what I see.  I hope this is inaccurate, but can not say that it is.

review/summary: Consider purchasing from the distributor
review/text: So I thought that since I had never been ripped off by Amazon I would continue shopping for things on the site. I live in Texas and the only place to get these chips were from out of town or directly from the company EXCEPT they charge an arm and a leg for shipping a box of these chips to ones house. With that said i decided to purchase them from this seller and was VERY unsatisfied... I was truly disappointed in my purchase. Below are the reasons why:<br /><br />1. The bags were ALL deflated<br />2. The apple chips were stale<br />3. Some of the bags were opened<br />4. There weren't exactly 60 as it mentioned<br />5. The expiration date one some of the bags were over due<br /><br />The upside was that shipping costs were low and they delivered in a timely manner. Other than that there really was not much else good to say about this product. At this point I would have gladly spent the 20 dollars on shipping chargers from Seneca than to have bout them from the seller.

review/summary: My Dog Loves These!!!!
review/text: My dog loves these things and although they are expensive, I feel good knowing that these are a much safer alternative to rawhides.  For those that aren't aware, rawhides do not digest very quickly and can clump inside of a dogs stomach resulting in an expensive visit to the vet. So to get on with the review...<br /><br />The Pros:  They are 100% all natural free-range, grass-fed beef.  They are made with no additives, no chemicals, and free of hormones and antibiotics.  They are human grade processed and USDA approved.  The are fully digestible, low in fat, high in protein and help reduce tartar and keeps your dog's teeth and gums healthy.<br /><br />The Cons:  They smell. They really smell... And they are expensive.  Value Pet Supplies has some of the best pricing I have seen.  I use to buy these things at the specialty pet supply stores (but they sell them for seven to nine bucks a piece) so when I found these on-line for more than half the price, I was ecstatic.  One thing to note.  Shop around at different websites.  The best pricing I have found is to go directly out to either the Value Pet Supplies Website or the Best Bully Sticks Website.

review/text: I ordered these chew sticks thinking they were Jumbo in size.  Found they were not and my dog can chew them up in less than 15 minutes.  The Jumbo bully sticks I find locally are about 3 fingers in thickness with the same length as those sold here (12") and take a couple of days to chew.  Not at all what I expected for $90.00.  Will be going with Merrick or local from now on.

review/text: I ordered these jumbo bully sticks, in the hope they would live up to their advertisement, and they do.  I marvel at reviews where owners talk about their dogs working on bully sticks for days--not my two!  My dogs were going through regular-sized bully sticks in about 10 minutes!  They literally sit and salute the minute I bring out these treats for them.  Absolute peace reigns in the house for anywhere from 30-60 minutes.  I am completely satisfied with the quality, and my dogs give them a solid 5 paws rating.

review/summary: Convenient
review/text: Product exactly as advertised: 8 bottles containing 2oz ready to eat formula.<br />Although I breastfeed, I don't have the time nor inclination to pump milk to mix with baby cereal or 'water down' pureed food so I use this formula. Ready-to-eat in 2oz was the perfect convenience, especially since the lid screws back on. If these had a pop-top or tear-off-foil top that could not be resealed they would not be very convenient. My baby showed no signs of tummy problems when I introduced this formula. I cannot comment on how these would work as a bottle with the nipple attached because I never used it as such.<br />The bottle cannot be recycled in my CT town's municipal recycling program. I considered deducting a star for that! Alternatively Similac really should use a biodegradable container such as those made with corn.

review/text: I like the full size Cow Tales (why aren't they called cow TAILS? Cows don't tell tales, they have tails...) and ordered this 3 pound package of smaller size candies. They're slightly chewy, with a creamy type inside filling, and come in other flavors too. They lasted a bit longer since I was eating less per portion, but the dogs just loved them. They would see me starting to peel the wrappers, and almost instantly get into sitting position without me saying a word. There's no chocolate, raisins or other ingredients that would be bad for them, and I limit the total amount too. Don't want diabetic dogs, just happy ones.<br />  The price was reasonable for the amount I got. It was shipped quickly and tasted fresh. I'll be buying more soon.
