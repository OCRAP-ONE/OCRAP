review/summary: Delish and great value!
review/text: I have loved Pemmican bars ever since a friend introduced me to them at the organic co-op supermarket where he was working.  They cost about the same as most energy bars but give you twice the calories so you are really getting 2 servings for the price of 1!  You can eat half at a time if you just need a quick snack, or an entire bar for a full-on meal replacement.<br /><br />Plus they are totally organic unlike Powerbars and such, and are a complete protein!  Best of all they taste kind of like a dense sweetbread, are moderately sweet rather than overpoweringly sugary like many...have never caused bloating or gas.<br /><br />You can actually buy them cheaper in bulk if you order directly from the manufacturer (google up Bear Valley), but I needed the faster shipping provided by Amazon this time.

review/summary: Don't taste great but they get the job done well
review/text: I used these when backpacking at the Philmont Scout Reservation many many years ago -- they were supplied to us by the reservation. The days when breakfast was a pemmican bar, we were not too excited, but they sure pack a load of nutrition and would easily keep us going until lunch while hiking up and down mountains with 50-lb packs. At least they're not gritty like powerbars.

review/summary: Horrible Taste..
review/text: Pros: High in Calories (great as a meal replacement bar), simple ingredients, high fiber, high protein, good source of vitamins, relatively healthy bar, yummy tiny walnut and pecan pieces<br /><br />Con: Tastes so bad. The sour wheat flavor was so unbearable that I felt sick trying to eat it. I tried eating the majority of the bar, but I just couldn't finish it. I almost felt like vomiting because I could not stand the strange sour wheat flavor. It even smells sour too..almost similar to the faint smell of toe jams.<br /><br />Overall, the concept was great, but the flavor and smell was too much for me to handle.<br />I really wanted to like it, but I didn't.<br /><br />This bar may be great if you don't mind the flavor and smell.<br />I'm gonna try freezing them and attempting to eat them another time. I'll see if I will grow to like the unique flavor and smell. I have so many bars to finish :(

review/summary: not real pemmican, im dumb
review/text: i got so excited that when i found "pemmican" on amazon that i just bought it and didnt read.  yes it my fault that i didnt fully read the ingredients.. but when you advertise something as pemmican, shouldnt it contain dried meat and rendered fat?  this has no meat, no fat, and is not even gluten free.  what a disappointment.

review/summary: "not real pemmican..."
review/text: Yea, those who claim these bars are not "real" pemmican are right. The original stuff was a mix of dried beef and rendered fat, sometimes with whatever local berries could be found. Even those who ate it regularly hated it. (Mostly voyagers and the like.)<br />Those who whine that this is not real pemmican are clueless. In 1830 or for that matter 2012, meticulously prepared meat-based pemmican still can go rancid. In fact, it WILL go rancid. It was mostly an emergency fall-back ration.<br />Better by far were the old Wilson meat bars of the early '70s. The US military still uses something similar in some of their MREs. Sadly I can find no source for the bars any more.<br />If you make and seal pemmican meticulously with a vacum pump heat sealer they MAY stay eatable for a week in hot weather. I would not count on it. It is also a very pricey item to make, even from scratch.<br />If you want a meat based product that is close to the original, buy one of hundreds of small shelf stable sausages such as salami, pepperoni, summer sausage, etc. Large groceries handle dozens of varieties. I have even seen low fat varieties such as pepperoni. There are also smaller items like Slim Jims and their fellow travelers for smaller meals or smaller appetites. I have seen them in like 3 ounce servings up to eight or so ounces. Beyond that, they get huge. They are all quite fat heavy as was the original item.

review/summary: Smells Great; Makes Things Taste Great
review/text: Several years ago, I started making homemade marshmallows for family and friends.  You'd be amazed at the simple joy that radiates from the face of a person learning for the first time that marshmallows can be made at home.  Anyway, as a special treat for a friend who  is so enamored with France that she grows French lavender in her backyard because it reminds her of her travels there, I decided to try a lavender marshmallow.<br /><br />I was able to find some culinary lavender in my local grocery store (near a pretty urban area), but it seemed so expensive.  In the end, this is about a fifth of the price of my grocery store.  Win!  When I got the package in the mail, I could smell the floral, almost woodsy and astringent fragrance that I associate with lavender (and rosemary) before even opening it.  The color of the flower buds ranged from shades of blue to purple.<br /><br />To cook with it, I dump what I need into a large bowl and use the sprayer on my faucet to put enough water in the bowl so that the flowers float.  I give it a stir and then use a small-gauge strainer to scrape the floating flowers out of the water.  Any detritus that may be mixed in with the flowers will sink to the bottom (though any stems will not - but then again, rosemary and thyme typically have some stems mixed in), so don't just dump it in the strainer.  Glean the flowers from the top of the bowl.<br /><br />As for my marshmallows, which I topped with lavender-scented dark chocolate, my friend loved them and everything I've made since (lavender lemon cookies, blueberry lavender syrup, lavender cream, lavender, thyme, and rosemary roasted potatoes, lavender butter, strawberry lavender butter, etc.) has been quite delicious.  When I need more lavender, I know where to come.<br /><br />Update:  I also wanted to mention that 1 oz. of lavender is about 1.25 cups.

review/summary: Extremely Fragrant, Fresh, and Clean
review/text: I smelled this package from the mailbox outside of my house.  When I first got my package, it was completely destroyed in the shipping.  I immediately contacted customer service, they responded to me the SAME day (which is almost unheard of now a days), and they sent me a new package within the next couple of days.  These people are so friendly, so nice, very understanding, and truly have a great attitude for business and their customers. I flavored powdered sugar with it to make Lavender Frosting (sifting the sugar of course, the buds are very potent).  It's so aromatic, a little bit of lavender truly goes a LONG way! I have about 2 cups of lavender from purchasing the 4oz package.  I highly recommend any product from the OliveNation company, they have great products and I'll be getting more!  You get a coupon when you purchase anything, it's wonderful to put towards your next purchase!

review/text: From reading the product description and the majority of previous reviews, I was expecting very blue lavender flowers with amazing fragrance to show up in the mail.  I was not disappointed at all.  As soon as I opened my post office box, a waft of lavender hit me in the face.  This product is of high quality, and I would definately purchase it again.  My cake turned out wonderful.  The color is lovely, and if you don't want to use it strictly for cooking/baking, it's more than fragrant enough to put around the house, in the sock drawer, etc.  P.S. Lavender is known for its calming effects.  Feel free to Google its benefits.

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: I've had insomnia off and on for the past year +. I've been prescribed just about everything...including the main stuff like ambien. Ambien, unlike what the commercials promote, left me with horrible hangovers, terrible mood swings...and often times I would sleep walk/do things that I didn't even remember. I've also tried in store stuff like tylenol PM or sleep aids you can find in your local drugstore...really, nothing worked. Finally I discovered Dream Water from a random amazon search and found some at Duane Reade. It works (no pun intended) like a dream. I sleep well with little to no hangover at all...no mood swings...and it doesn't knock you out. It slowly relaxes you into a sleep, as it promotes. After all this time...a more natural remedy, and one that's not cheap necessarily, but definitely cheaper. 5 stars, no doubt about it.

review/summary: Works for me - at half dose.
review/text: I am a nurse that works night shift and travels frequently. Between the two, I have a funky sleep schedule and sometimes go through periods of extreme insomnia.<br /><br />Then, at the airport in Long Beach, CA I found Dream Water. I was a little shocked at the price but decided to try it anyway. Because it was expensive, I tried half a shot and it worked, well, like a dream. A whole shot makes me do weird things in my sleep, but a half shot makes me fall asleep and get a good 6-8 hours with no hangover effect - even during my severe episodes of insomnia.<br /><br />As a nurse, I would like to recommend that you be careful taking it every day. One of the ingredients (5-HTP) can cause serotonin syndrome in certain doses. Since we don't know the exact dose they use, I would look up serotonin syndrome and be on the look out for side effects if you take it regularly. Just in case. I haven't had any side effects, but better safe than sorry.<br /><br />Also, be careful mixing it with certain other meds used to adjust mood (anxiety/depression meds) or other sleep aids - even natural ones. Just a heads up.

Teas are natural, but don't work are all, and pills have nasty side effects. Dream Water is natural and effective!!! I also love that I don't have to count calories, because I do take this regularly.<br />It is powerful enough to help you fall asleep, but mild enough that you can wake up whenever you want to, without leaving you groggy or out of it. Both flavors are great!<br />By it for yourself- and if you want to make other busy/stressed out people very happy (your friends, your parents, your teachers, your coworkers, etc), spread it around!!

It both relaxes me and helps me fall asleep on the nights I am laying awake counting sheep.  It tastes great unlike some of the other products I've tried, I prefer the Snoozeberry flavor myself, but the Lullaby Lemon is just as good.  Finally something that works for me!!!

review/summary: Sweet Dreams!
review/text: I came across this product in a local store by accident and decided to give it a try.  I must say I was more impressed than I thought I would be.  And honestly I didn't think it would work at all.<br /><br />Normally, I lay in bed for a while watching TV until I fall asleep. It sometimes takes me about an hour or better to actually fall asleep even though most mornings I awake at 5am. I wake up several times in the night, for no reason, but generally go back to sleep with no problems. I tend to wake up a little sluggish and not wanting to get out bed. Well I drank the Dream Water, the taste is pleasant, and in about 30 minutes I felt more relaxed.  But I think I was fighting it at first. But as soon as I laid down, I was sleep in time.  I slept through the night.  And woke up refreshed and felt rested and ready to start my day.<br /><br />Of course this shouldn't be used daily but for those days when I think sleep is going to be hard to come by, I keep some Dream Water on hand. Some of the ingredients (this products claims to be all natural) are maybe not for people with high blood pressure. So please pay attention to the label.  But if you have no existing health issues I'd recommend giving it a shot!

review/summary: It even helped ME!
review/text: I suffer from idiopathic insomnia, which is basically lifelong insomnia, every night, with no known cause. I've tried EVERY sleep drug - ambien, trazodone, lunesta, etc. etc. You name it! I HATE taking drugs, especially to sleep. So I'm always looking for a natural alternative. I've tried "sleep shots" in the past, but my body is very sensitive and most of them have tons of different herbs that can cause negative reactions. THIS DOESN'T! This contains only ingredients that are SUPPOSED to be in your body naturally.<br /><br />5-HTP is a precursor to serotonin.<br />GABA is EXTREMELY relaxing and good for an anxious mind (I have been taking GABA supplements for about a year now)<br />Melatonin is something we all know about to help induce sleep.<br /><br />This combination is just what my body wants before bed. Granted, I still have some sleepless nights. In addition to this drink I often will take magnesium and Passion Flower supplements to help calm me. The taste is great, very mild. This product has made a noticeable difference in my relaxation and sleep.<br /><br />Highly recommended. Let's get away from those sleep drugs!

review/summary: First OTC sleep aid that worked for me
review/text: As an insomniac of many years, I picked up a Dream Water at my local pharmacy, where they're sold in individual 2.5-oz bottles in two flavors, Snoozeberry and Lullaby Lemon.  I've tried every over-the-counter sleep aid there is, and some help, some don't -- this stuff really works.  It makes me very drowsy, and far as I can tell, there are no adverse side effects.  Both flavors are subtle and pleasant, and contain no calories.  The active ingredient is sodium 80 mg, which might be of concern to those on a low-sodium diet, although 80 mg only represents 3% of the average adult's recommended intake.  The rest is their "secret blend" of what I presume is the usual herbals that are reputed to relax you. All I know is that I fall asleep within an hour and sleep better through the night with fewer interruptions.<br /><br />One minor complaint -- the stuff's expensive (hence the four stars, rather than five)!  Even if you buy it by the 12-pk, it's about $2 a pop! I guess it deepends, then, on how bad you want to sleep.  I like having the stuff around for when nothing else is working.<br /><br />So that caveat aside, highly recommended!

review/summary: Excellent grain-free food
review/text: We switched our Lab/Setter mix to Earthborn from another grain-free food, and have been very happy with the results we have seen.  As with all grain free foods, less volume is required to achieve the same caloric and nutrient content (2 cups per day for an 80# dog), so less waste is produced.  Anything that results in a healthier dog AND less clean-up in the yard is OK with me!<br /><br />Our dog has shown great energy levels since the switch, and is as enthusiastic as ever about meal time.  Another bonus to Earthborn is that the bag has a zipper style closure on the top, which helps ensure that the food stays fresh.<br /><br />Finally, for every UPC code returned to Earthborn they will plant a tree.  I'm not sure if it is a 3 inch or a 3 foot tree, but it is a nice gesture nonetheless.<br /><br />I will continue to feed my dog this food, and would highly recommend it to anyone.

I like that I can read the ingredients on the bag also.  I know what they are as opposed to a bunch of chemicals that are going to make pooch face sick.  Get this brand for sure.

Learned also that the raisins turned into leather so don't roast them! Put alot into the freezer to keep from getting rancid over time and have plenty out for lunches and snacks. This Hickory Harvest brand is very good!!

review/summary: USE YOUR HEAD - This is a LOT of seeds.  The bucket is nice, though.
review/text: I like sunflower seeds.  For example, last year, I bought a single "big" (about volume of a softball) bag of them at the beginning of my son's lacrosse season to eat while spectating.  Some 16 or so games later, I think I managed to finish the bag.<br /><br />I just received a gift from a family member whom I love very, very much - a bucket of SIXTY-SIX packs of these seeds.  Sixty-six bags of seeds that are "best if used by" October of this year.  It may have been a gag of sorts...I just don't know.<br /><br />I would have to completely consume one bag every three days between now and October to finish them by the expiration.  Forgetting about the fact that doing so would result in me [poop]ing myself inside-out for six-months straight, I can't imagine how incredibly disgusting my teeth would end up.<br /><br />I was quite relieved to see, from another reviewer, that they paid only about $15.00 USD for these at a bulk club - as opposed to the ~$50.00 USD prices I see listed here.  I will make the assumption that my gift was purchased for a similar price and, then, feel less awful about finding a way to somehow get rid of them...give them away.<br /><br />The bucket is nice, though.  I've spent ~$2.50 USD at Home Depot to purchase buckets of similar quality and size.  This bucket comes with a lid.  Bonus.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not.

review/summary: Happy with Earthborn!!
review/text: We have had our youngest Pug on Earthborn since we got him (10 weeks.) We recently switched him to this to get him off the puppy food (which we recommend as well). We've always been very happy with Earthborn products. Our Pugs coats are so soft and I know it's because of this food. Our older Pug before was on a different brand and we recently put him on this now too and his coat transformed! :) The only reason I give this food 4 stars is because it gives our dogs HORRIBLE gas. Pugs are gaseous anyways, but this makes it sometimes seems lethal. We may be switching to another flavor of Earthborn because of this, but either way we are sticking with Earthborn!<br /><br />*update* after a couple weeks of daily stink episodes with the Pugs they have calmed down a lot and I feel as if the food is no longer effecting them in that way :) We did give them half their old food/half new food for most of that time so maybe that played a role too, so in other words... Earthborn is the best! I feel confident they are getting what they need in high quality and it shows!

review/text: We adopted our 1.5 year old dog- Lady Pippy Waffles - from the local Humane Society last June 2010. We were told by lots of friends that WE HAVE TO find a holistic dog food because the dogs poops less, and its more solid- sorry for the details! When we first brought Lady home, she was on Science Diet. She had constant diarrhea. I finally did some research and learned that dogs can have a allergy to chicken- which caused the pooping problem- ugh. So we initially put her on another brand- which was great too, but about $15 more a bag. We have found that for the money- EARTHBORN was a great choice for Lady!  Be aware that when you open this bag of food, you will smell nothing but fish- but our dog loves, loves, LOVES IT!  Plus she only poops once a day, and has a gorgeous coat- (just not gorgeous when its all over my couch)!  Thanks!!!

review/text: It is amazing.  I love most of the flavors, and like the rest.  It is subtle and perfect.  The flavor is light, refreshing, refined, and delectable.<br /><br />For the people saying there is no flavor:  If you are used to super sweet, super salty, and overdone food/drinks it might not taste great.  If you eat normal foods, drink mostly water or teas, this is a refreshing addition.

review/text: I tried one of these at Whole Paycheck market and loved it.  It has no artificial sugars!!! which I am allergic to.  The flavors are so real; no chemical taste at all.  I cannot decide which is my favorite..well, maybe watermelon although blueberry is a close second..or maybe strawberry-kiwi?  I am just so happy to have it delivered from Amazon!  That is a double delight.

review/summary: Love this water
review/text: I first discovered Hint water while traveling out of state.  I like flavored water, but not those containing artificial sweeteners.  Hint has just a delicate fruity taste, and no sugar or other sweeteners.  It's very refreshing, and I find I drink more water when I have Hint water on hand.  I love the variety of flavors..my favortie is strawberry/kiwi.<br /><br />I like this water so much that I have it on amazon's subscribe and save, delivered to my home monthly.  My only complaint is that it is a bit pricey, and so I only order 24 bottles/month.  I'd love to have twice that much...<br />Anyway, great stuff!

review/text: I was introduced to Hint at Starbucks and really liked the Blackberry.  I think I've tried all of the flavors and most of them are quite good.  The variety pack adds more choice although I wish there was another configuration with some of the other flavors.  The water is surprisingly crisp and refreshing and considering the burst of flavor, it is amazing that there really is nothing in it...zero calories, no carbs, etc.<br /><br />I will say that in the several months I've been using subscribe and save, the flavor seems to have become stronger and sweeter recently but I can't actually verify it.

I drink more water during the day because of this product and I can see the benefits of being hydrated.

review/text: Both my wife and I dislike drinking plain water but we're both trying to be more "healthy" so after hearing favorable reviews we decided to try HINT water. We tried the sample pack that includes several of their flavors but didn't like any of them. HINT is a great name for this product. There is just a *hint* of flavor to them... similar to leaving a pitcher of water in the fridge overnight with a strawberry or other fruit in it. Personally, I'd rather drink plain water especially given the price of this flavor-hinted water.

And the flavor variety is great -<br />different than standard juices - they like almost all of them.<br />However, on a unit basis, this is expensive juice.  where cans of soda can be purchase in bulk below 20c per 12 ounce can - Knudsen is getting about<br />$1 per 10.4 ounce can.  So on the value side, a bit tough to swallow (pun intended).  Knudsen used to sell 12 ounce cans, and they were actually less expensive,<br />but they discontinued them....  I guess they wanted to make more money.

"all natural" probably one of the most abused words in the food industry.  0 trans fat, 90 mg of sodium and 16 g of carbs.  if your going to have good potato chips for your party these are the ones to get.  and make sure there is no double dipping!!!!

review/text: These are one of the best tasting potato chips that I have tasted. Nice and crunchy, a little thicker than other chips, and just the right amount of salt.<br /><br />While these are certainly not a health food, the current packaging boasts that they have 40% less fat than regular chips. The package also boasts "no artificial flavors, no preservatives, no MSG, no trans fats, made with all-natural ptotatoes and seasonings." One serving has: 6g fat, of which only 1g is saturated fat; 135mg sodium; 1g sugar, and 2g protein. For potato chips that is pretty good.<br /><br />Shop for price. The printed price on a 8.5 oz bag is $3.49, and I can get these for less on sale at my local supermarket.

review/text: Product was delivered as advertised and quite quickly at that. I feel quite safe with a 500g (1.1lb) jar of Manuka on hand, so none of these fancy designer plagues scare me at all (H1N1, SWINE, MRSA, Ecoli, etc..). I've combined my medicine cabinet with this and some .9999 (four nines fine) silver rods to do some colloidal silver.<br /><br />Since this is the MGO 400 grade (Bare minimum grade of Methyglyoxol in honey), this is meant for more serious illnesses and burns. If you're looking for something for occasional health prevention, 250 grade is more advisable (manukahealth also advises this on their parent website). Ordered from Amazon because you have to register with manukahealth's site to order... I've ordered from this company before (got the 250g MGO 400 grade before), great service and exceptional product.<br /><br />If you're seeking a tasty jar of quality honey, find a beekeeper near you or shop at a farmers market or local coop, Manuka Honey is MEDICINE, not something you spread on your toast. I however actually enjoy the medicinal manuka taste, no qualms here!

If you've never used it please give it a try.  You will love it!  It gives the olive oil such wonderful flavoring and when you dip that crusty bread into it...it's amazing.
