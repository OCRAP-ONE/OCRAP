review/summary: Finally!  A healthy treat with taste!
review/text: As one of many Americans trying to make healthier life choices in my food, Nana's cookies have been a wonderful treat without the guilt and bad effects of sugar, and gluten.  The cookies are moist and almost cake-like and sweetened with fruit juice, though the rich and vibrant flaver does not give this away.  The ginger and lemon cookies will fool even the most sophisticated cookie palate.  Give them a try and treat yourself to a healthy dessert you can enjoy without feeding your body excess sugar, carbs, and processed chemicals.  It is all natural ingredients, with a wonderfully sinful flavor.<br /><br />Kristin, mother of 3, Arizona

review/text: I really like the NO GLUTEN cookies. But these are for people who are really healthy and don't eat refined sugar or artificial sweeteners all day. After a while, things don't need to be that sweet to taste awesome to people like us.<br /><br />I can't eat gluten and I need to restrict my dairy and eggs (I should eliminate, but I'm still working on it). I don't eat sugar either (the cookies are sweetened with fruit juice). I really enjoy them and if you've got a lot of food intolerance issues, these are so convenient and good!

review/summary: The Best Cookie I've Had (Oh, and it's Gluten-Free!)
review/text: This product is a celiac's dream!  Nana's no gluten cookies have by far the most consistent texture of any gluten free cookies that I have tried (including my own homemade).  They are hardly distinguishable from a wheat-based cookie.  They are extremely soft, and, accordingly, some flavors do tend to be a tad "crumbly", e.g. ginger.  Lemon is not crumbly.

review/text: First I'd like to say that many of Nana's cookies are most delicious and I've tried most of the flavors.  My favorites tend to be this one and the chocolate coconut chip.  As one of the other reviewers pointed out you have to have a particular palate to enjoy this type of cookie.  For those of use that try to limit our processed cane sugar intake or have particular dietary restrictions...vegan, sugar substitutes, etc. these are really delicious and allow a taste of that bad for you diet that we've been led to believe we want.  Thanks Nana's for the natural foodie options.

review/text: I bought some Nana's No Refined Sugar cookies in several flavors when a local health food store was having a moving sale. They were so incredible I looked online and was delighted to find them on amazon, and bought some here. These cookies taste fantastic, and they are very moist as well. Really all of the flavors I tried (choc chip, coco chip and oatmeal raisin) were outstanding.

review/text: These are the only cookies I have found that I can safely eat without feeling poorly afterwards and which taste similar to a "real" chocolate chip cookie. I try to limit refined sugars, wheat flour, and dairy products in my diet for health reasons, but oh, how I miss cookies. The ones I bake myself just don't taste that great, but these chocolate chip cookies from Nana's help me keep to my prescribed way of eating. I don't know what I'd do without them! I like to freeze them, and sometimes I top one with a bit of Rice Dream "ice cream" on top. Yummy!

It taste like a brownie... very yummy.  Even my friends and family that don't have allegies love it.  I have no idea why someone gave it such a poor review... guess they are able to eat a snickers bar.  And calorie wise, it's not that bad... heck of a lot better then other cookies.  I would totally recomend these.  My 2 month old loves them and so do I and my husband.  5 stars!!!

review/summary: Tasty cookie -- even fiance likes it..
review/text: These are very tasty cookies.  Originally I bought them because they are gentler on one's stomach.  After a few necessary surgeries last year I found that wheat products tended to make me feel bloated and uncomfortable if I ate too much of them.  Thus I tried to cut back on wheat.  Of course cookies are one of those things we feel guilty about anyhow.  Well I don't feel guilty eating these cookies!  They have no ingredients which cause an allergic reation such as refined sugars, dairly or wheat.  Also they are delicious.  My finace has been requesting them and he grew up on the all-american startch and potato diet!<br /><br />The reason for 4 stars:<br /><br />The only suggestion I have is that the packaging be improved.  By this I mean that each package has 2 servings but the serving is only half a cookie!  So one can gobble up too much at a time.  If they would make one-serving sizes that would be great.  It's easier to control calories, requires less mental calculation and is an honest way to report calories.  Also for children it's easier to say "one" cookie, then "half" a cookie.<br /><br />However I don't hold this too much against the company because this packaging is standard industry practise.  However I hope in future they will think about making a single-serving package or a same-size package that has 2 cookies.<br /><br />Otherwise they are fantastic for what they are meant to be...that is a cookie alternative for those of us with sensitive digestive systems, and perhaps a few loved ones with a sweet tooth.

review/text: I'm sorry to say that I tried the Lemon flavored cookie, and it tasted like someone had taken beach sand, flavored it with a little lemon juice and sweetener, added a teaspoon of water, packed it together, and sold it as a cookie. It was so incredibly gritty that my tongue felt a little raw afterward. It was so crumbly that I couldn't even break pieces off of it to eat them... every time I tried to break a piece off, a big part of the cookie just fell apart. It was like when you're building a sand castle and the sand isn't wet enough... it doesn't hold together. I couldn't finish it.

It is tasty and chewy, just sweet enough, but it causes no negative symptoms for me. The fat content is from canola oil, which is so much healthier than the usual fat or shortening sources, even in 'healthy' cookies. It also gives me a sense of having had something from the 'bread' food group; but without the negative physical consequences.<br /><br />I am delighted to have found this cookie, & I highly recommend it!

review/summary: Okay, but not great
review/text: I tend to love orange cranberry cookies, but this cookie recipe is not the best. It is excessively orange flavored, overwhelming the cranberry flavor. My guess is that they added too much orange flavor to the recipe. It also crunches, due to the second ingredient (puffed rice). I don't think the puffed rice crunch adds anything to the cookie. Furthermore, the cookie, although at a moderate level of sweetness, has a slight bitter aftertaste. It's not a bad cookie, but it's not particularly good either, and one I won't be buying again. IMO, it's not worth the 260 calories one gets from eating both halves.<br /><br />P.S. Only the first ingredient, the whole wheat flour is organic.

review/text: These are tasty, however, as per the nutrition info on the package, one serving is 1/2 a cookie! The calories for half a cookie are 140 and the fat for that half a cookie is 5 grams. So if you eat the whole thing it is 280 calories and 10 grams of fat!

review/text: I really like Nana's cookies and have placed several orders.  The Peanut Butter are always dryer than the others, but, unfortunately the last batch of Peanut Butter was way too dry.<br /><br />The Double Chocolate are always very moist and great tasting.<br /><br />I have tried most of the flavors, but Peanut Butter and Double Chocolate are my favorites.  Just wish they would make the peanut butter ones a little more moist.

review/summary: Yummy
review/text: I absolutely LOVE these cookies!  (and, no, I'm not a relative or friend of the manufacturer).  I've eaten the chocolate chip, oatmeal-raisin and peanut butter ones - never the gluten-free, so can't comment on them.  I love that they've no refined sugar or hydrogenated fats like most other cookies.  I've been buying them locally, and my grocery store is frequently out of them, so I was delighted to find them on amazon for cheaper than at the store.  One reviewer commented on the calories.  HUH?  First of all, who on a diet buys then dings cookies?  Also, keep in mind that just one of Nana's cookies is nearly 1/4 pound (hello?).  If you were to eat 4-1/2 regular size cookies, you'd end up with the same number of calories but they wouldn't taste as good as Nana's or be as good for you.  But you can always save what you don't want for later.  Sometimes I'll just eat half a cookie and roll up the plastic bag and tape it so I can enjoy the second half later.  So far they've kept just fine for even a couple of weeks.  No worries.

review/summary: Delicious AND healthy
review/text: Quitting sugar is HARD. Nana's cookies make it MUCH easier. I get to enjoy the sweet & chocolately taste I crave, without the sugar or chemicals in most other cookies. They are delicious and very satisfying. Because they are sweetened with fruit juice, my blood sugar does not get spiked, so I do not get a "high" followed by a crash after eating these cookies. Nor do I feel addicted to them, like I do when I eat products made with sugar. And, I like that they are gluten free, since we are bombarded by products made from wheat, and I crave a variety of grains, like oats and rice. I highly recommend these cookies - I eat them regularly and they fulfill my craving for sweets, which has been so helpful in making better food choices when I am faced with temptation. And on Amazon, they are priced very reasonably, and worth every penny.

review/text: I purchsed Nana's Coconut Chip cookies at Amazon and loved them. Incredibly moist, luscious and yummy, these oversized cookies are as satisfying as they are good for you. With wholesome ingredients and no refined flour or sugar, these are truely healthy treats. Chocolate chips and coconut flakes are paired perfectly while the flavor of each is allowed to shine through. Brilliant!  If you love chocolate and coconut, especially together, in one chewy concoction, you would find these cookies addictive. And they are vegan too.

review/text: My husband and I are slowly becoming addicted to these cookies. While they are, to me, just ok right out of the package, they are delectable warmed up in the microwave for 30 seconds and eaten with ice cream on top! Preferably one that has some kind of chocolate in it to boost the chocolate flavor. A great alternative to sugar free products, which can cause stomach upset, for those of us that want to stay away from refined sugar! Just don't forget that these are not a low calorie food, read your labels carefully!

review/summary: Truly Healthy and Satisfying
review/text: Life with dietary restrictions can be tough. Products like Nana's cookies make it so easy. These cookies are soooooooooo good and truly have healthy ingredients. Some "healthy" cookies are hidden with potentially harmful sugars like evaporated cane juice which is just sugar albeit unrefined. Some can take it and some cant. As a hyploglycemic that needs that is very senseitve to sugar the "good" and the bad these cookies are such a healthy treat. I never feel sick after eating one even if I eat the entire cookie and I couldnt possibly be more satisfied if I ate a homemade cookie with unhealthy ingredients. These cookies all of them I have tried are delicious. The gluten free options are not quite as good but if you must stay away from gluten all together they are a great version. This is the ULTIMATE cookie!

review/summary: My Favorite Nana
review/text: Interesting thing about reviews: you can tell as much about the reviewers as the items they're writing about.<br /><br />I've tried almost all of Nana's products and the No Gluten Ginger Cookie is my FAVORITE.  There's absolutely no guilt for me.  Brown rice and tapioca flour?  Fruit juice?  Canola oil?  What's not to like?  If, like me, you have to avoid dairy and sugar cane, it can be difficult to find a sweet treat that satisfies.  And if your girlfriend is gluten-free?  Well, now you're really in trouble.<br /><br />Fortunately, along comes Nana.<br /><br />This cookie has a great texture (almost like a scone: the real kind, from the UK) and a little kick.  It somehow maintains that perfect balance between spicy and sweet.  (See preamble, above.)  As with most of Nana's products, there's just one problem: I would be happier if the cookie were about as big as my head.  But that's why they come in boxes of twelve: one box lasts almost a week!<br /><br />Nana's other gluten free, dairy free, sugar free flavors - chocolate, lemon, and chocolate crunch - are all wonderful too, but this little wanton want-one is special.  Trust me.  Don't listen to the naysayers.  They just don't appreciate perfection; moist, buttery, spicy-sweetness.<br /><br />(See preamble, above.)<br /><br />Dear Nana: whatever that "natural flavoring" is, which hits the roof of my mouth like a monkey landing on my back, please don't take it out.  I pledge my everlasting devotion to your kitchen.  I'll even wash the dishes...

review/summary: Cookie + soy/rice milk = delicious
review/text: I was diagnosed with severe gluten and egg allergies roughly a year ago and had a hard time parting with my favorite kind of baked good: cookies. I never ate many in the first place but they were a treat or desert and I was thrilled to find a lemon cookie that satisfied my desire for baked goods.<br /><br />The consistency can be off-putting at first but the longer I go without wheat or gluten products the less important the consistency because I have almost forgotten what a real cookie tastes like. These lemon cookies are not tart but have a very nice lemony flavor that is reminiscent of a lemon bar. They are heavy and thick like a dense cake or brownie and incredibly chewy and fresh tasting.<br /><br />I would usually freeze these for a couple hours before taking one to school with me to have between classes. If you're able to drink soy or rice milk then a glass of vanilla or plain flavored milk will go great with these!

review/text: These cookies are soooo delicious!  Due to Celiac Disease and other gluten intolerances, three members out of our family of five must be gluten free.  These cookies sure fit the bill for a treat!  They are delicious, and even though they crumble a bit (if you eat gluten free you would probably be used to this since rice flour is commonly used, and it crumbles), they still have a soft moisture to them.  The ginger flavor is really good and not any spicier than a ginger snap.  My two boys ages 9 and 11 LOVE them.  When I pull the cookies out of the grocery bag, they dance around with joy!  The true test was when my husband tried one.  He does not have to eat gluten free, nor does he care to, lol.  He really liked it, and has since requested them when I shop! A+++ for these!!

These would make a good starter for a bean salad or possibly a vegetarian/vegan chili.

review/summary: My favorite mix for salads
review/text: I prefer the Westbrae chili bean mix to their salad bean mix for bean salads. Salad mix has garbanzos which are not my favorite - just don't have much flavor. Rinse these guys, and add tomato, plenty of fresh rosemary, small cubes of smoked mozzarella and olive oil and a little balsamic and let sit for a while. Add whatever else - chilled small pasta, bacon, mushrooms, peppers, asparagus, shrimp... Super tasty.

review/summary: Hill of Beans
review/text: Westbrae Natural Vegetarian Organic Chili Beans are a delicious blend of kidney, black, and pinto beans. They make a colorful blend for chili. I used them in a coffee/cocoa vegan chili from Veg News Magazine (Our big love issue, June 2010) recipe. The beans are rich and flavorful. They're a perfect blend for meatless chilies, or whatever calls for a combination of beans. They'd be great in a vegetarian tamale pie topped with cornbread, or tucked into burritos/enchiladas. Beans are a natural source of protein. They're also superior to most meat substitutes. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1904456200">The World in your Kitchen: Vegetarian recipes from Africa, Asia and Latin America for Western kitchens</a> has many bean-based dishes, as does <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/140132360X">Jamie's America: Easy Twists on Great American Classics, and More</a> when Oliver hits the trail in Wyoming, and makes his own twist on fireside chili.

review/summary: Tasteless, full of liquid
review/text: I ordered a case of these beans.  I was trying to figure out a way to get staples into the house without taking the time to go to a local store.  I finally got around to using these chili beans for my home made chili recipe.  I opened these cans and each of them were full of some slimey liquid, for half of the can.  I had to drain off that slime before i got to the beans.  I only had a half of a can of beans once the liquid was gone.<br /><br />I am cooking this now.  These beans have NO TASTE!!.  I am going to have to add a lot of salt, pepper and chili powder to save this pot of chili.  I am very disappointed.  I will never use this brand again.

review/summary: Just like the old Eagle Mills San Francisco Sourdough Bread Machine Mix
review/text: While I lamented the lack of Eagle Mills San Francisco Sourdough Bread Machine Mixes on Amazon, someone had commented that the company had been acquired by Krusteaz and that I should try that mix instead.  Being unable to find it anywhere in my local stores and feeling like I had to have an alternative to homemade sourdough, I finally relented and ordered the boxes.  Whoever originally told me to do it, THANK YOU!  The Krusteaz mix IS just like the Eagle Mills was.  Taste is the same, instructions are the same, the only thing that isn't the same is the amount of the mix in the box - 14 oz for Krusteaz vs. 15 oz for Eagle Mills.  I don't miss the extra ounce too much.  While it isn't like home made sourdough, it does make a nice quick substitute when one does not have 15 hours to devote to bread.  Thank you!

review/summary: Not sure why this rating is so low.
review/text: I've cooked 8 loaves of this bread in my bread machine and every one of them has been fantastic. Even friends that made fun of me for getting the bread machine were considering getting one themselves after tasting this sourdough.<br /><br />I've never cooked sourdough from scratch before, but it's extremely difficult for me to imagine that it's that much better than this bread mix. Especially when you factor in it's literally: Add a cup of water, Dump in mix, Add included yeast, Press a button. You can't really beat that. Every batch I have made rose no problem.<br /><br />There is only one problem I have with it. After I make a loaf, it's gone so fast, I rarely have it when I want it. But that's a great problem to have.<br /><br />I hardly review on amazon, but this bread deserves a higher rating than this. I've also had the white bread mix and it's extremely good too.

review/text: This is the best tangy sourdough mix you will find. It's super easy just add water and you have prefect tangy sourdough that's very close to making it the long hard way from starter. When you don't have time to plan ahead and make tangy SF style sourdough or need to make it in a flash, this is as good as it gets. Very happy with this mix and will be trying some of the other Krusteaz mixes. This comes with everything including the yeast, just add water. Also the tangy flavor is better if you wait to eat 4 hours or more after baking.

review/summary: Fantastic bread!
review/text: I used to be able to find this product in stores years ago.  As bread machines have lost popularity, so have the bread mixes that go with it.  As a result, it is difficult to find this product in stores.  It is great to find it here on Amazon and I don't mind buying it in bulk.  The sourdough is so yummy.  It usually doesn't last for more than a day in my house before a loaf is all gone. It goes great with spaghetti or it is good all by itself.  It is also wonderful when toasted.  If you like bread, you can't go wrong with this mix.

review/text: Tried this mix in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002XVUAOU">Zojirushi BB-CEC20 Home Bakery Supreme 2-Pound-Loaf Breadmaker, Black</a>, with poor results. It tasted fine, but the dough fell during the final rise, so loaf came out concave and way too dense. I'm pretty sure it wasn't my error, as all you do is dump the flour mix over a cup of water, followed by a pre-measured pack of yeast on top, and run it on basic. The machine has always produced successful loaves, this one being the only exception thus far. I may give it another try, just to see if it was a bad batch.

review/summary: Nice Fresh Flavor. Low Calorie. I'll Be Back For More.
review/text: I enjoy trying new foods and beverages. I found this "Aloe gloe" water (crisp, original, pulp free) in a 15.2-ounce bottle in my local Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market. I had to try it. I've never had anything aloe before and I was curious. Well, it's quite good. I'd say it tastes like a mild iced tea with something of a fresh, very-light minty flavor and is ever so slightly sweet. All the ingredients are certified organic. It's produced right here in California, only about a hundred miles away, in fact. Supposedly it has digestive, immune and skin benefits, and I certainly can't vouch for that after having only one bottle. But, I like it. Nice taste. Goes  down easy. Only 70 calories in a 2-serving bottle. I'll be back for more.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Alleged benefits
review/text: I was somewhat surprised to discover that--among aloe's many reputed benefits were digestive, immune, and skin health advantages. Of course, these claims could be simple marketing ploys, but this Aloe Gloe Natural Aloe Water is certainly worth a try. It did strike me as somewhat curious that the water contains both "certified organic cane sugar" AND "certified organic stevia." I'm left to wonder why water requires any sweetening at all, let alone the addition of two separate sweeteners. At any rate, I drank just one bottle (approximately 35  calories; 10 grams of carbohydrates), and I suspect that's not nearly enough to reap the benefits of this product. I'm a bit skeptical, but I'd be curious to find out whether anyone who drinks this regularly notices any actual benefits.

review/summary: A sweet, refreshing drink!
review/text: I've never been much of a soda drinker, so I'm always on the lookout for alternative beverages like juice and tea.  Lately, I've been swept up in the craze of coconut water.  When I saw this bottle of 'aloe water' I immediately wondered what the new flavor was.<br /><br />When I opened the bottle, I was reminded of the smell of apple juice.  Aloe Gloe has a very sweet, crisp flavor.  Considering there is a both cane sugar AND Stevia sweetening up this drink, I guess that isn't a surprise.  It's very pleasant and enjoyable, and would be extremely refreshing chilled and served on a hot summer's day.<br /><br />One odd note, though: if you drink directly from the bottle, there's a distinctive plastic  note to the liquid.  That was rather disconcerting.  I think that if you drink it from a glass this would probably be alleviated.

review/summary: Almost Perfect!
review/text: I wanted this to be perfect...as a result of years searching for an Organic Aloe Drink that was not too thick, gloppy, and more like a medicine than a satisfying, good-for-you refresher with all the benefits to digestion and the immune system. Aloe Gloe - almost made it - a silky smooth consistency of a 35 calorie serving per container, made in California USA (Yay!), delicious alone or with food, easily digestible and tastes like the good-stuff-Aloe. But why is organic cane juice (pure sugar), and Stevia (a natural sugar sweetener) added as well to equal 4 grams of sugar? For purists admittedly, the latter can make digestion more difficult and possibly compromise the immune system as well. The taste therefore in my opinion has an over-the-top sweetness note. But if you tend to drink sweet stuff, and/or like it that way, you will probably love the product, and be far better off drinking something actually good-for-you than some carbonated, diluted, and/or chemical concoction of who-knows-what. The product is Gluten Free, has no preservatives, is certified organic Aloe along with organic water as the primary ingredients. And...to underscore, it is made in the good ole USA! Thanks!

review/text: I ordered Aloe Gloe's Natural Aloe Water through Amazon's Vine program because I was curious.  I still am.  The product has a pleasant and slightly sweet taste, but I'm left wondering what the point is.  The product is touted as having a wide variety of important amino acids.  So, why does it have to be lightly sweetened?  I'd prefer a healthy drink that has more of the natural flavor of the plant from which it's derived.  This just seems too scientific.

review/text: Typically aloe has got kind of a bitter edge to it. This product isn't bitter, but<br />it has an odd taste. However, I can see it being used in a smoothie, so you likely wouldn't taste it. Aloe has a lot of health benefits. So if you look at it as a<br />health product the taste may not be a deal breaker. But in general, the taste isn't bad, it's just odd and that is a deal breaker. I'd rather get my aloe some other way.

review/summary: Excellent Taste, Moderate Potency
review/text: The taste of Aloe Gloe is excellent.  There is however a little bit of stevia aftertaste (not too bad).<br /><br />Like many expensive waters the amount of the healthy ingredients isn't much.  The bottle indicates 300 mg of Aloe.  I'm assuming that is for the entire bottle not.  This is actually a reasonable dosage but perhaps a bit on the low side depending on how much benefit you expect to obtain (and who's opinion on dosage you listen to).<br /><br />This is a good low calorie drink (only 35 calories for the entire bottle) and an entire bottle is only 8 grams of sugar.<br /><br />All in all this seems like a good product but due to the cost I doubt I'll drink much. I'd rather buy coconut water.

review/summary: Pleasant taste, not what I expected
review/text: The "Aloe Gloe" water is special.  It is natural aloe water-it contains 300 mg per bottle of aloe vera. It is certified organic, and also is supposed to improve digestive, immune and skin health benefits.  Apparently this product is infused with more than 200 (perhaps 201?) biologically active amino acids, vitamins, antioxidants enzymes and minterals, according to the package.  The maker and supplier of this beverage is obviously trying to tout this as a health product.  As I am not aware of any research with this particular water actually improving someone's health I am not sure if all these added things really do improve a person's health.<br /><br /> This product has a pleasant, sweet taste.  It also (at least to me) looks slightly green.  Although I still prefer natural water, and would not buy this product; I enjoyed the taste of this more than I expected to.  I would rate this 3.5 stars if I could.

review/summary: California Grown Aloe Vera Water
review/text: Already an Aloe Vera fan, it does believe that it helps me with digestive problems. Originally, I saw a BBC diet show that saw that it was great for the digestion. The star recommended about 4 ounces every morning. I didn't know about its skin health benefits before. On the side of the bottle, is a list of its health benefits?<br /><br />Previously, I have been buying sugar free aloe vera from a Chinese grocery that was tasty. Can't remember where it is from so I do like that this is from California. This is sweetened with organic stevia, but I also noticed some "Certified Cane Sugar" on the ingredient label. Therefore, you may want to limit the amount you drink each day. It is 18 calories per 8 oz. so that is just 9 calories each day for me!<br /><br />One warning, when you look for aloe vera, you really need to look at the ingredient list because most aloe vera of the aloe vera drinks are super loaded with sugar.<br /><br />I like to put mine in the refrigerator before opening as it is really tastes, cool, clean and crisp when you do that.<br />The only thing that I would do differently is to offer one with the pulp. I love pulp! I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Simple Addition to Beauty Routine
review/text: A friend introduced me to Aloe Gloe when I was complaining about the aloe juice recommended by my doctor - pulpy, bitter, nasty stuff. The taste takes a bit of getting used to, but it's not as offensive.<br /><br />The benefits, however, and wonderful. Since one bottle is two servings, I usually have half a bottle's worth with my breakfast. (It tastes much better chilled.) I have noticed a small improvement in my skin and hair, in that my hair seems stronger and definitely shinier, and my skin is clearer. The bottle claims that there are benefits to the immune system; I can't vouch for that, and as for the digestive benefits, I'm pretty "regular" anyway. But I do like tossing this back regardless as a super easy addition to a beauty routine.<br /><br />Beauty from the inside out and all that.

review/summary: Pizzaholic loves these.
review/text: I'm a pizzaholic and not ashamed to admit it :-)  Although the fact that these were gluten-free was not of concern to me, I'm trying to eat healthier, and watch calories. I like these because they're a decent portion size for a big guy like me.  (If I was trying to be good, I'd only eat half of one of these).<br /><br />I wasn't clear on how many I was getting, so now I can tell you:  I got 5 packages with 3 crusts in each package.  I paid $12-something for them here on<br />Amazon, so for less than a buck each, it seems like a good deal.  I think I need to refrigerate them when open (I put each one in a gallon-size freezer bag), but apparently the non-opened packages can sit in my pantry for quite some time.  They're packaged with lots of those "stay-dry" packets that are often found in shoe boxes or other things that might not like moisture.<br /><br />I've long admired those who can make home-made pizza dough, roll it out, and bake it to perfection.  For me, that's too much work, and I lack the baking skills to make that happen.  However, I like creating my own pizzas on a whim and pulling this out of the pantry and putting my own toppings on is VERY handy.<br /><br />I'll try to update this review when I reorder to let you know whether I had any problems with the non-refrigerated ones staying mold-free.

review/summary: Great Wheat-Free Crust
review/text: I have tried another rice shell and liked it, but this one is closer to a "real" pizza shell. It is raised somewhat, from the yeast and has a yeasty fragrance. I pre-cook shell to try to get crispier. If you prefer a softer shell, this is perfect. It is stiff enough to hold all my toppings. I had no problem with mold or it keeping well. I sealed it shut again after using one and put in fridge. :)

review/summary: good start for gluten, casein and soy free pizza
review/text: We are gluten, casein, and soy free and it's very difficult to find anything that doesn't have soy in it that doesn't taste and feel like cracker crumb crust.  This is very good, and very reasonable.  The family loved it, specially my 7yr. old grandson with autism, who hates almost everything (just like mikey).  Will definitely buy it again.

review/summary: Sophisticated Adult Chai
review/text: I would describe this tea as more of a sophisticated black tea with a flirtation of chai spice Vs. your typical knock-you-upside-the-head, spicy, hippy chai teas on the market. It goes great with milk and honey as a pick-me-up morning brew!
