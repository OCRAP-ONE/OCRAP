review/summary: Quite Good Tasting.
review/text: From time to time my nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market has displays of items that are on sale, perhaps because they are being discontinued. Sometimes, the items were never carried in the store in the first place, as was the case here. So, here were some packs (boxes) of six bars of Chex Mix Treats of the Chocolate Chunk variety. They were at a 50% discount. How could I resist?<br /><br />The individual bars are 1.06 ounces and weigh in at 120 calories. They're mostly made of cereal but have added chunks of chocolate. They're quite good tasting and make a nice snack. I get them primarily for my little boy (4 years old) as a snack and as an "incentive" type of thing. He loves them, of course, and they have some nutritional value in addition to being a treat. I might judge them to be a little high on the candy content.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

Whereas I can use 1 packet of Truvia, I am finding I have to use at least two packets of this sweetener. One thing I do like is that it does not have any discernible aftertaste.

review/summary: Best Sweetener for Me. Suggest: Simpler packaging to keep price reasonable.
review/text: I'm so glad a friend recommended this natural sweetener. It is as described. I don't taste an aftertaste.<br /><br />The only issue I have with Swerve is the price. It's very expensive, compared to other sweeteners! I think that the fancy packaging is nice but I wished they would have chosen simpler, more economical packaging to make the cost more consumer-friendly. I actually limit how much I use because of the price. Something I never have to do with other (albeit unappealing) sugar substitutes.<br /><br />If the price were lower, I would have bought more packages and tried the confectioner's version, too. I would also buy it often to bake with, without breaking the bank. If you are the maker of this great product, please consider this review. Simpler packaging is better; then one day it might appear in natural groceries and supermarkets everywhere.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FEH6O4">Reese Homestyle Ranch Croutons, 5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />I am on a diet and probably will be on a diet forever.  It can get boring eating the same food every day.  I hate to cook so everything I eat is already prepared by a well known diet food company and all I do is microwave it. I enjoy eating a salad or a lite soup with my meal.  These croutons are fantastic.  They are low in calories and since there are not too many if any mouth watering lite soups or salads these croutons are an essential part of my diet.  I also bought then in the cheddar flavor and they are just as great as these.  I hope that Amazon keeps these around for a long time.  I noticed that many of my favorite food items which I have ordered from Amazon and that are included in their Subscribe and Save program are unavailable with a comment stating we do not know if these will be available again. This is especially annoying to someone like me who has to watch my caloric intake. When one is on a diet it takes a long time to find something palatable which makes eating a low calorie meal enjoyable and delicious. These croutons are a great addition to otherwise tasteless foods. I love em and recommend them to everyone even those who are lucky enough not to have to watch what they eat.

review/summary: Best retail GF bread I've tried
review/text: I have been eating GF products for over 10 years.  Finding a retail bread that approximates wheat-based breads' resiliance and moisture is virtually impossible.  This product will not impress anyone looking for that.  I have yet to find a retail GF bread that is not crumbly or drier than the "real thing".<br /><br />With that in mind, this is the best retail GF bread I've tried.  It actually has more flavor and better than average moisture (but not a lot) as compared to other ener-g GF bread products.  It still falls short of "real" bread, but will perform better if toasted.<br /><br />Since my allergy is to wheat, and not gluten, I do have more options with making bread from scratch.  Fresh bread from my oven always out-performs anything retail.  I would recommend this bread for those folks not wanting to bake from scratch.<br /><br />As for delivery, I have this item on subscription, and receive a package regularly.  I've had no problems with shipping or quality of service.

review/summary: crumbly and strange
review/text: I ordered this a month or 2 ago (from a different site) as I use the Ener-g bread for making stuffing.  If it weren't for it being shelf stable and cheap shipping, I would not buy this brand.  All of their breads are crumbly and dry.  I do remember having their sweet loaf years ago and liking it.<br />Today when I went to open this loaf to dry it some more for stuffing, I noticed it has white spots- either flecks of flour or mold- I am not sure.  It doesn't taste moldy but maybe it is hard to tell as all the Ener-g breads I have tried have a strangely distinct vinegar-like smell and taste.  Not sure if I should go ahead with my stuffing or skip it.  No stuffing on thanksgiving is a bummer.  I'm 300 miles from a store that carries anything GF.  Disappointed- may have to find a different GF bread for stuffing.  Maybe I'll break down and make some yummy fresh bread and skip the stuffing.

review/text: I know that this bread is a little bit more expensive than other gluten free breads, but it's well worth the price.  It's not as dry as other gluten free breads and you don't feel like you are eating cardboard.  The taste is somewhere between a nice grainy brown bread and a rice bread.  Toasts up nice and also makes good a sandwich (toast or warm the bread in the microwave first).  My husband even likes it! Oh yeah - the hamburger buns are good too!

review/summary: Merrick Wilderness Blend - Another great option for the health conscious dog owner
review/text: Again, Merrick has created yet another dry food that my dog loves!  This particular product, the Wilderness Blend, consists of the flavors of buffalo, venison, and the bold fresh taste of salmon all mixed together for an excursion of the palate for even the most discerning dog.  I love Merrick products, and the fact that all of the dry varieties are centered on the same base of ingredients so that you can change out flavors/varieties without having to worry about upset stomachs or other digestive upsets - something that Merrick prides itself on.<br /><br />The particular product, which is typical of all of the Merrick line, has the # 1 ingredient as real meat, is made of human grade ingredients, contains fresh vegetables and fruit, has no animal fats, is complete with whole grains, and is Made in the USA.<br /><br />The ingredient list is as follows:<br /><br />Buffalo, Salmon Meal, Lamb Meal, Ground Rice, Oat Meal, Pearled Barley,Beef Fat(Preserved with mixed tocopherols), Ground Whole Barley, Venison,Natural Flavor, Rice Bran, Yeast culture, Dried Egg Product, Hydrolyzed Yeast,Salmon Oil (a natural source of DHA - Docosahexaenoic Acid)*, Calcium Carbonate, Dried Potato, Dried Carrot, Salt, Potassium Chloride, Dried Apple, Dried Peas, Dicalcium Phosphate, Alfalfa Nutrient Concentrate, Choline Chloride, Dried Blueberry , Dried Cranberry, Yucca Schidige<br /><br />So, basically as you can tell, with Merrick you are getting nothing but the best for your dog!  My dog really seems to enjoy this and also loves <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F5RX6">Merrick Grammys Pot Pie Dog Food 30lb Bag</a>.  I switch off and on according to her tastes, and she never has any issues whatsoever with the change.  As long as they make this, I will continue to buy - my veterinarian says that she is as healthy as can be, and contributes much of this to her great Merrick diet.

review/summary: Superior dog food for allergies
review/text: About four years ago, I discovered that my (then 6 mo. old) West Highland Terrier had allergies to chicken and chicken by-products. I tried Nutro and Blue Buffalo over a course of six months, slowly switching in between to lessen any digestive issues.  However, neither brand seemed to make a major difference.  After reading an online review of Merrick, I switched him to their Wilderness Blend and after about of month I noticed a drastic difference in his health and appearance.  He no longer had stomach issues, and his coat went from a dull white-with-yellowish tinge to a beautiful shiny white color.  Four years later, he still loves this food, and he remains free of the typical digestive and coat issues that Westies are known for having.  I wholeheartedly recommend the dry and canned Merrick non-chicken based products (Wilderness blend, Turducken, Brats-N-Tots, etc.) to anyone with a dog that has food allergies!

review/summary: My dogs are going wild over this
review/text: I've just started giving them the Wilderness Blend, switching from regular Purina dog chow.  My Boxer has a sensitive stomach and is picky about what she eats.  I've had to be creative feeding her the Purina.  But this food she is "wild" about.  Simply loves it and so does my lab mix.  Just have to say though, in the above product description, it says no animal fats, but one of the ingredients listed is beef fat.  I am not purchasing this through Amazon though as I am getting it quite a bit cheaper elsewhere online.  I have done quite a bit of research on the foods and decided that this one is as good as any of the top of the line foods.  At any rate, it will be much better for them than Purina for sure.  It is all made in the USA and nothing comes from China.  Since they just started on it, I can't say how they will be doing later on it, but so far so good!

review/text: I bought this on all the reviews and different ingredients it brought. Thought my dog would love the different type of dog food than the blue buffalo one which she loved. Boy was I wrong I couldn't get her to eat it at all. She would turn up her nose as soon as I put it in her dish. She hasn't eaten in a week because she didn't like the dogfood i gave her. I will try the cowboy flavor one and see if she likes it. If not, I don't know why people would give it a 5 stars if some dogs don't like it. I am surprised also be cause it had venison..thought for sure she would love it because she would eat some venison when we gave it to her but no. Somebody told me that his dog also refuse to eat this flavor because it had buffalo meat in there and salmon. His dog dislikes salmon...he tried cowboy flavor one and his dog loved it. SO I will try the cowboy one if she also dislikes that then I would just go back to blue buffalo one then..<br />i gave it a 3 stars because of the ingredients it had that was completely different than other boring dog food brands. Would have given it a 5 star if my dog would eat or like the dog food but she doesn't.

But the third party reseller is either criminal in their handling of the packages and so rough that the package opens in the corners OR they know the package is open and ship it anyway. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and go with the former. If you handle the bags from the corners/top, then the packaging will open on you. Guess they don't know or have the muscles to pick the bag up by the middle. So from now on, no more ordering Merrick from Amazon.

review/summary: Need magnifying glass to find liver.
review/text: Finally, a canned cat food that the kitties are eating (at least for now, with a few vitamins & minerals. And this brand won't end up in the dog bowls! But I am hard pressed to find the chunks of liver - very skimpy - which is really O.K. because the cats leave what few itty bitty pieces that ARE in the can behind (3 Star for deceptive liver chunks/ 5 Star for chicken breast).  Looks almost as pictured, except for liver chunks.  I also bought the plain chicken from same company & will just go with that and rate a 5-STAR.  If your kitties LOVE cooked liver, you won't find enough in this recipe to satisfy their hunger - unless they eat all of the chicken too, which you probably wouldn't buy if cat didn't like chicken.  I am just so happy to transit the dry food & salty canned chicken addicted cat to a wet food to save on the kidneys. I do have one cat that loves raw liver & chicken, but I like to take a day off from adding vitamins and messing with raw meat (cutting, etc) so this is going to work out, it appears; hopefully for awhile - though one never knows with kitties.  Great today - terrible tomorrow!

review/summary: Good food that the kids love!
review/text: Grain free, human quality ingredients, no fillers and the kids love it.  Good healthy food doesn't mean much if it doesn't get eaten, so the fact that both of our kitties lick their bowls clean mean a lot.<br />Weruva gets consistent top ratings for grain free, natural products.  We've experimented with all favors of Weruva.  This and Paw Lickin Chicken are their favorites.<br />Our local pet store offers a "buy 3 get the 4th free" deal and a buy-by-the-case discount. The price here on Amazon beats both promos by several dollars.  It's not a huge dollar savings, but the fact that it's delivered right to my door adds time and gas savings too.<br />Happy kitties, healthy kitties, time, gas and $ savings makes for happy humans too.

review/summary: Kitties Approve
review/text: I'm pretty picky about what my cats are fed.  While I have never eaten it myself - my clan of 4 all approve this flavor of Weruva.  My only real problem with it is that the calorie count per can is very low compared to other brands.  This food is pretty pricey anyway and it takes a lot of it to fill them up.  I wish the water content wasn't so high or they calorie content was better so I felt I was getting more value for the money I am spending on this food.

review/text: After some health problems with our cats we switched over to a more natural diet.  This was the transitional food.  It is made with quality products no fillers or junk you can get in most other cat foods.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is the price.  Our cast love it and can be picky eaters.  You can't find it in local stores and prime shipping is a great deal.

review/summary: Fully Sattisfies Human/Feline Desires
review/text: My cat loves this stuff, and it even looks appetizing to me (not surprising, since its made in a "human food facility"). No animal byproducts, grain-free, BPA-free packaging, made from Mackerel (a safe and sustainable seafood choice, unlike most Tuna), and reasonably priced (especially the larger 5.5 ounce cans)... What more could you want? Seriously, this is as good a choice for wet cat food as I've seen anywhere.<br /><br />BTW, for dry, I strongly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NEWKU4">Acana Grasslands Grain-Free Dry Cat Food, .88lb (Trial Size)</a>. (Check out the samplers, and look for other flavors and sizes from Acana on Amazon and elsewhere.)

review/text: We adopted a 2 year old / 12 pound Russian Blue male from the shelter 3 months ago. We wanted to start him on the best healthy diet of a wet and dry food regimen we could. We tried many brands of canned food including Blue Wilderness, Tiki Cat and Instinct; all of which left unfavorable results. We then moved on to Weruva and my Blue Boy can't get enough! He especially loves the chicken flavors. He's now a happy active cat with the shiniest coat of fur east of the Mississippi.

review/summary: unbeatable quality
review/text: i was a skeptic of this product when i first met the rep in my pet store a few years back because they'll tell you anything to push a sale. "human grade this", "super-luxe that", and so on. out of curiosity, i picked up a few cans at a different pet store in the area to test it out.<br /><br />my. cat. LOVED. them.<br /><br />every morsel, licked clean from the bowl. this price offered online is an exceptionally good bargain: 36.92 for a 24-can case gives you a deal of just over $1.50 per 5.5 oz can. i've never seen it for less than $1.99 in stores with the average being around $2.50/can. the quality of this product is simply unbeatable, period. the moisture content is great for weight management, urinary tract and dental health. the meat quality is absolutely unbeatable compared to any canned food i've ever seen. the best part is the SMELL - delicious! it smells just like canned soup for people to eat. it doesn't smell anything like cheap, canned cat food... because it isn't.<br /><br />do yourself and your cat a favor. buy this product and lots of it.

review/text: just received my case of this food after reviewing many other types. I wanted something that was organic and healthy for my two cats,instead of taking them to the vet all the time..They absolutely LOVE this food,plenty of juice and meat. One 5.5 oz can feeds them both heartily and they lick the dish clean. I started them on an organic holistic dry food over a month ago and I see a big change in their coats,so shiny and soft. I believe that the added expense should keep them overall much healthier and happy...

review/text: My cat likes Mideast Feast and Asian Fusion. He's not so crazy for the chicken or Marbella Paella, but I think it's more that he doesn't like non-fish and doesn't like shellfish.<br /><br />This stuff might be a bit expensive but I see it this way:<br /><br />With the wet food I used to buy, if I didn't take care and left some in my sink or garbage can for more than a few days, there will be small flies that emerged from it. With all the Weruva stuff, I've left some remnants out in my sink for a week and no flies. I really think the cheaper, more available wet cat food has something wrong with it to be spawning flies so quickly.

review/summary: Best wet food I've ever purchased!
review/text: I have 2 super-picky older cats (13 & 9).  I've tried so many options, but this is the first one where the CLEAN the bowl.  I've tried every flavor of Weruva on them, and the plain chicken is by far their favorite.  They like the other chicken varieties but for some reason there are peas, carrots, and pumpkin in it, all of which they strategically eat around.  They both can't stand fish, so chicken it is!<br /><br />Being meat and gravy in it's almost purest form, it definitely has a positive impact on their health.  Their fur is shinier and softer.  And they seem more happy and playful.<br /><br />I never used to believe a food upgrade could make such a difference, but this certainly did!!

review/summary: Very pleased
review/text: This food is a hit!<br /><br />The cat likes it because it's got chunks of shredded meat in gravy.  He won't eat ground or pate-style foods, so the shredded meat in this one is a winner.<br /><br />I like it because, for one thing, it's grain-free.  To my mind, if you could only pick one quality to shop for, grain-free would be it; carbohydrates - and particularly grains! - are not good for cats.  It's very high in protein, which *is* good for cats.  It contains pumpkin, and while that is a carbohydrate, it's supposed to be good for their tummies.  I'm also pleased that it contains duck meat, since I like to rotate my cat's protein sources to take advantage of their differing nutritional profiles.  And finally, it's got plenty of gravy to help my cat stay hydrated; cats are built to take in much of their fluid from their food sources, so feeding dry food exclusively can dehydrate them (and possibly lead to urinary crystals).<br /><br />True, it's expensive.  Even for higher-end cat foods, it's expensive.  But if you'd ever had a cat develop diabetes because of an improper diet (i.e. dry foods high in carbs and too low in animal-based proteins) - or any other condition brought on by a poor diet - you'd agree that a little expense up front is way cheaper in the long run than treating the health condition.  The fact that I'm still giving it five stars should tell you something.  Not that I don't recommend shopping around for deals!)<br /><br />Give this food a shot.  It's a very healthful choice.

review/text: Paw Lickin' Chicken is a big favorite with my cats. It's amazing stuff. Looks good enough to put on a crossiant!<br /><br />I use it in rotation with other Weruvas and other brands. When I first served this, my cats ate it like little crazies. Having seen the euphoria, I went out and bought more cans of PLC. I served it all the time and suddenly there was no interest. My epic fail. Too much, too often, equals wasted uneaten cans.<br /><br />I place Weruva's Paw Lickin Chicken on reserve, serving it 2X total (breakfast and dinner) per week, due to the high cost hence one less star in my review.

When you open the can, it looks and smells like real (canned) food, not pressed and formed mystery meat or worse, meat paste.  Gluten-free, which has helped reduce the amount of cat barf left in random places or hidden behind couches, etc.  We buy two or three varieties at a time and rotate it through so the cats don't get bored with it.  Pricey, but definitely worth it!

review/summary: Only Food the Babies will Eat!
review/text: I first discovered this product at a local pet food store. Bella and Dora, our adopted kittens, were suffering from a respitory cold that they had picked up from the shelter and were not eating any food.<br /><br />The girl at the shop was really cool and introduced us to the Weruva line of food as well as other brands. I was interested to find out that the owners of Weruva are somehow related to the company that produces all the tuna for Subway Sandwiches. I guess the husband/wife team had cats and were dissapointed to find low quality soft food in the market, and asked to find out what it would take to be able to use the same facilities. They found out that as long as they produced human grade food, they could use the facility. Anyways, we bought a whole bunch of flavors to see what they would like, and ultimately this is the only one that they always finish!<br /><br />I like that you can tell that it is fish, and not some mushed up by product. It smells very fishy, so if that makes you sick just be aware!<br /><br />Hope your kitties love it as much as ours do!!!

review/summary: Weruva is top quality and this flavor is *MY* cats' favorite
review/text: I've tried many different vendors and varieties of canned cat food and this is the favorite for *my* cats' (two of them) by a long shot.  *Your* cats may not like it.  Cats are very finicky!<br /><br />My advice to any reader is to learn about quality pet food (take an hour or two on the web, there's plenty of material to read) and then shop for top quality pet food only (Weruva qualifies in my opinion) and try a small sample until you find a set that YOUR cat likes. Rotate here and there for variety... if your cat likes variety, that is.  Both of my cats hate fish, love poultry and pork, and will tolerate other meats such as beef and lamb, and they both like a little variety.<br /><br />I wish I had fed my cats canned or even raw food from early on but I made the mistake of listening to an indoctrinated vet and fed them "prescription grade" Hill's Science Diet kibble which is total crap as I have come to learn from my own research. Like most doctors with humans and the pharmaceutical companies, many vets become distributors for pet food vendors for financial reasons and won't recommend something that doesn't make them money.<br /><br />I now feed my cats this Weruva flavor and a couple of other quality canned cat foods (they don't care for any other Weruva flavor, by the way) plus a couple of quality kibble brands (high protein, grain-free - no corn, wheat, or soy).

Unlike most pet food, it actually  smells like something that a living creature would eat. Finally a food that I don't have to feel guilty about feeding to my cat.

review/summary: Our cats love it
review/text: We have tried many different brands of wet cat food with some initial success.  But, after a while, our cats would stop eating it -- or refuse to eat it in the first place.  However, we have been feeding the Weruva Mediterranean Harvest Cat Food to them for several years now.  They never seem to tire of it and pester anyone they can find to feed them when they think it is time to eat.<br /><br />Great product

review/summary: Our favorite of the premium cat foods
review/text: After researching cat food, we tried quite a few brands and flavors (Merrick, Nature's Variety, Wellness) before settling on this one.<br /><br />What I like about Weruva Chicken is the strip texture instead of paste/pate, and also the very low fat content. While it's ok for cats to eat fat, they get enough from their EVO dry food, so for their wet I prefer low fat and high protein.<br /><br />I hesitate to say our cats love it, cause if I switch to something else for 2 weeks, then back to Weruva Chicken, they forget that they like it. They seem to need 2-3 days of tough love to adjust to any food, even one they previously liked.<br /><br />I wish it was made in USA instead of Thailand, so it's not perfect.<br /><br />It's only about 160 cal/can, but this is due to very low fat, which other premium catfood makers use to boost their caloric content.

review/text: My super-picky, unbelievably finicky cat who is not a big eater and has refused so many different kinds of food LOVES the Mack and Jack and the Meow Luau.  It has been so frustrating to get her to eat something, much less actually like it -- with this food she hears the can open and comes and cries for it.  She didn't like the chicken and liver (Nine Livers), but I am sure that flavor is good, too, she is just ridiculously picky.  I gave the chicken and liver to a friend and her two cats loved it.  Thanks for making a food that this cat will actually eat!

review/text: My cat has had health issues in the past and the vet recommended "wet" cat food and specifically this brand.  There are no additives or fillers.  My cat has been eating this for years, various flavors, and always "cleans her plate."  The price on Amazon is also the best I have found.  This brand is not available in the large pet chain stores, only upscale pet shops carry it.  So I was pleased to find it available on Amazon.

review/text: The key to choosing a successful wet food is obvious--knowing what your kitty likes. Over time I learned that my cats like non-chunky wet food. I tried the Weruva chicken flavor, which has grainy chicken pieces. They didn't hate it but didn't go crazy over it either. Then I tried the Polynesian BBQ which has a lot of chunks so that didn't work out either. Then I saw the picture of the Mediterranean Harvest and knew that would be the magic dish. And it was! My cats absolutely love this flavor! I am so happy I finally found something both of my cats love to eat everyday.

review/summary: Even very finicky cats eat it!
review/text: I have three very picky cats who quickly get bored with the same old food. As a result, I am constantly on the lookout for different varieties of cat food that they will eat. Forget about any of the veterinarian supplied cat foods. My cats' response to those cat foods is consistently, "you must be kidding!". The weruva chicken cat food was very well received and gobbled down. But please remember, in the world of cats, variety is the answer! I rotate the foods I feed my cats each day. Just like people, cats do not like eating the same thing day in and day out, and don't hesitate to let you know their dissatisfaction.

review/summary: Roxie loves this food!
review/text: I've tried numerous canned -grain free- foods for my cat Roxie. She just doesn't care for them. I opened the can of Paw Lickin' Chicken food from Weruva and she started eating right away and never stopped till it was all gone! I was shocked! She's always had a lot of allergies and has always been picky when it comes to canned foods...so i was a happy camper when i saw how she took to Weruva's food. I contacted Weruva via email to tell them how impressed i was and to inquire where i could just purchase some single cans instead of a complete case of each of their flavors to try on Roxie. They responded immediately (actually the President of the company and co-owner responded) - WOW!  They were very helpful and gave me a lot of insight about cats and allergies and such. I did order about 8 different cans/flavors from one of the websites they mentioned and am anxious to see how Roxie does with the other flavors. Again, i am very pleased with their food and the company itself!  Will definitly order again!

review/summary: i like the smell :)
review/text: i absolutely LOVE this brand! i tried the chicken one and my kittens adored it, but we traveled steadily in june so i couldn't really get deliveries from amazon like i needed. i supplemented with petco's soulistic food because i read that weruva is contracted to make that brand. my kitties really dig it, too. but here's the difference between the two: with weruva, they eat a lot less and bulk up more. 2 cans a day for both of my 5 mo. old kitties is enough for them. with soulistic, they cannot stop eating it and one of my kitties still has a very lithe body. SO, i'm back to weruva - mack and jack this time - and i mix in SOLID GOLD SEAMEAL nutritional supplement that i purchase here. i mix extra water with the seameal and mix it in the food (about 3/4 cup) because we are in the desert and although we have ac, it is still 100+ outside.<br /><br />i bought a 6lb bag of dry salmon halo for them this go-around and they are so used to not having an dry food at all so their bodies don't like it very well. after half of this case of weruva is gone, i will initiate them into an all raw diet. i am also going to put soil in their litter box instead of all this other stuff (even though i am very happy with my KITTEN ATTRACT litter).

review/summary: My two cats love Paw Lickin' Chicken
review/text: I have two finicky eaters.  They will only eat Paw Lickin' Chicken canned food.  I've tried other varieties from Weruva and many, many others from other manufacturers.  My cats seem to like the meaty texture of the food.  They won't touch pate' type foods.  They'll lick the gravy off of foods with morsels and gravy, but won't touch the morsels.  They won't even go near wet seafood types of cat food.  It's this and Wellness brand dried food<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006MWNPM">Wellness Complete Health Salmon, Salmon Meal & Deboned Turkey Recipe Dry Cat Food</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CNZA86">Wellness Indoor Health Dry Cat Food</a>.  Needless to say the food bills are high.  This is cheaper than the four local pet food stores by 20% - 25% (two boutique stores and two chains).  I tried buying whole chickens and cooking them in the crock pot as it is cheaper than this, but they wouldn't eat it.  With Amazon Prime free shipping it makes sense for me to buy it here.  I still buy from the two boutique pet stores from time to time to assuage my guilty conscience because I'm not buying local and wouldn't have discovered this food if it hadn't been for the helpfulness of the local pet shops, but the price savings and convenience of to my door shipping is significant enough to get me to buy it here.  Buy a few cans from your local store to see if your lovlies will eat it and compare the price.

review/summary: Finally, a food ALL my cats are thrilled with!
review/text: We began feeding natural foods after 2 of our cats developed "asthma". The veterinarians treated them with prednisone and the cats became sicker and sicker.  We switched to natural foods and the asthma completely disappeared, never to return.  So, we fed natural foods for years, then picked up a few strays that refused to eat them and we went a while feeding low quality grocery store brands to those cats just so we didn't end up throwing away a lot of natural food.  Then we tried this and every one of our 6 cats are totally thrilled with it and lick their bowls clean.  We are not throwing any food away and feel great about feeding a high-quality food once again to our cats.  We have also had great luck with Evangers pheasant and Wellness Core.  The natural pet food companies seem to be working hard to make their foods tastier.  If you have tried natural foods before and have been disappointed with their palatability, you should definitely give this a try.

review/summary: Male Cat Owners Beware Seafood Based Cat Foods
review/text: I recently did research on kidney/renal failure as I just lost one of my male 7 year old cats due to CRF (chronic renal failure). CRF is common in cats, especially male cats due to their intricate urinary system. About a year ago we discovered Weruva & started adding various flavors along with their high quality dry food. My cats totally loved their new canned foods especially Out Back Grill, Asian Fushion and Mack & Jack which happen to be all seafood based. I did not know that a seafood diet is not good for cats. Fish can contribute to urinary tract problems in cats. My cat that had CRF was a slim, but normal weight for his small size, but had lost weight partly due to his high fish diet (I found out fish based cat foods do not contain the fat they need). Wuruva, Tiki Cat,Tiki Cat King Kamehameha Luau Variety Pack Canned Cat Food 12/2.8-oz cans etc are all low fat. Cats need animal fat like chicken fat, fish oil, even emu oil. Besides being needed for their overall health, it's important for their kidneys! Not that I know of any onion eating cats, but I also learned never to give any onion to your cat. Deli (sandwich meat)& some meats (ham, hot dogs) may contain onion powder. The vegetable broths in canned tuna may contain onion. Read the label on any broth (including chicken, beef) as most contain onion or "spices". Occasional tuna water from a can of tuna packed in water is okay from what I've read & that is something I have given my cats. Also, I am always careful to keep anything with Xylitol (natural sweetener) away from cats & dogs, that includes toothpaste & gum including the gum wrappers & any toothpaste spatter in the bathroom sink (if your cat likes to sleep in your sink). My CRF cat was the runt of the litter so was a 'small average' size, very active, happy, partially outdoor cat who also ate high quality dry food, but mostly Weruva the past year or so. Over the past year we probably tried every Weruva flavor & it was great seeing how well my cats took to quite a few flavors, especially the fish based ones. I made the error assuming they were getting the right food. I won't be buying fish based cat foods by the case anymore.

review/summary: My cats LOVE this Paw Licking Chicken! But BEWARE of  the fish flavor's of Weruva that contain Menadione
review/text: My cats beg for Weruva Paw Lickin Chicken and they didn't beg for their other food which was more expensive.<br />I noticed their coat became shinier and softer after I began to feed them this food.<br />It appears to be good taste wise and nutrition wise.<br /><br />I just changed my rating review from a 5 to a 3 because....<br />BE CAREFUL OF FISH FLAVORS: The other variety's flavors ingredients seem fine:<br />I just realized an order I placed for Weruva Mideast Feast Cat Food contains a controversial supplement: Menadione Sodium Bisulfite Complex.<br />The ingredient Menadione has carcinogenic effects and "is toxic to kidneys, lungs, liver, mucous membranes." Keep that in Mind when ordering they can use real sources of vitamin K that are less dangerous.<br /><br />Also lately the 5 oz cans of Grandma's Chicken Soup contain less meat than the 3 oz cans of the same flavor. (They are mostly all liquid) If you buy that flavor the 3 oz cans are a better bet till they straighten that issue out. My cats and I like Paw lickin Chicken the best.

review/summary: Mostly great
review/text: My cats love about half the Weruva flavors and most flavors look so good that I've been tempted to try them.<br /><br />The only negative thing I have to say is that the *Marbella Paella* includes calamari, but like everything else it isn't mashed down to little pieces.<br /><br />****One of the cans contained a 1.5 inch long WHOLE squid**** and it was rather big surprise for me to open the can and see that...  I'm not going to buy this type in the future.  I don't know if squids that size have bones in them or not, but if they do and I missed it my cat could have choked to death.<br /><br />If you buy this flavor, please check the contents of the can before giving it to your cat...

review/summary: Beware the Menadione!  2 Flavors OK.  Call them.
review/text: I agree with "Nicole Rae":  it makes no sense whatsoever that Weruva would be using Menadione Sodium Bisulfite. You don't need a Vit K supplement, and if you want it then use kelp pwdr because it's cheap. Google this ingredient for yourself.  For some reason TWO WERUVA FLAVORS DON'T USE THIS INGREDIENT:  PAW LICKIN CHIKIN and PEKING DUCKEN. The kitten loves them, but he loved Poly BBQ and others too.  Hey, if it's banned for human consumption in some European countries, why take the chance. I called the company and simply gave them direct feedback:  please stop using this ingredient, then I'll buy the full line so long as the kittens will eat it and luv on it.  I hope they won't be 10 yr old cats by that time.

review/summary: Damaged cans
review/text: As other reviewers have noted, the product arrived damaged... over half the cans were dented and 3 of them badly enough to compromise the seal (lovely smell). The problem is that a dent near the top of the can causes the lid to separate along the score-line that would normally only separate when you pull the pull-top lid off. It is clear that this happened before the product reached Amazon for shipment as the light bulbs shipped in the same box suffered no ill effects (not to mention the age of the stain on the cans themselves).<br /><br />The product itself seems to be OK; it looks pretty much like the pictured product, though not all of our cats enjoyed it and it has a strong fragrance of fish even when sealed properly - was a hit with one of the cats, not so much the others. For a product at this price point, and at the relative rate of damage noted in other reviews, this is not something I will buy again as I am now concerned that I may have missed a slightly damaged seal and would not want to risk feeding my (spoiled) animals a spoiled product.<br /><br />If the manufacturer is reading this, my first thoughts would be jams at case conveyor transitions, low back-pressure conveyor failure, palletizer/wrapper problems or rough forklift handling. It seems intermittent but frequent and has now cost at least one customer.

review/summary: Cats Hate It!
review/text: I have 6 cats and do cat rescue.  I bought a case, since I mainly only use organic (Newman's Own)canned food for all my cats.  This looked and smelled like human food, but the cats won't touch it.  I left it outside for starving wild cats and THEY would not eat it either.  So buyer beware.  Don't buy a case to start with like I did.  I still have 20 cans left and no one will eat it.

review/summary: Total rip off
review/text: I'm surprised no one has noted how much water is in the package and how little fat (only 1.4%).  This Weruva flavor, for example, has 85% water (only 15% dry ingredients).  Here is what the FDA says on its web site:<br /><br />"It is especially important to look at the moisture guarantee for canned foods, even when comparing a canned food with another canned. Under AAFCO regulations, the maximum percentage moisture content for a pet food is 78%, except for products labeled as a "stew," "in sauce," "in gravy," or similar terms. The extra water gives the product the qualities needed to have the appropriate texture and fluidity. Some of these exempted products have been found to contain as much as 87.5% moisture. This doesn't sound like much difference until the dry matter contents are compared. For example, a product with a guarantee of 87.5% moisture contains 12.5% dry matter, only half as much as a product with a 75% moisture guarantee (25% dry matter)."<br /><br />On top of the nutrition problems, Weruva is ripping you off on a cost basis (this is my comment, not the FDA's). Looking at the dry ingredients, Weruba is charging you about $2 per ounce ($1.60 per 0.825 oz dry ingredients in a 5.5 oz can).  The top premium cat foods charge about $1 per ounce of dry ingredients.  Avoderm is 80 cents per 1 oz dry weight.  Science Diet is less than 70 cents per oz dry weight.  So Weruva is nearly 3 times the cost for ingredients other than water comparing Science Diet.<br /><br />So if you have a lot of money to waste and don't mind your cats having dry hair and other skin problems from lack of essential fats in the diet, then go for Weruva.  Otherwise, wait until they drop their price and increase the fat content.

review/summary: My cat don't eat it
review/text: It looks pretty healthy and with real meat, but the only problem is that my cat doesn't enjoy it at all, he doesn't really want to eat it. I don't know why, maybe it's not tasty.
