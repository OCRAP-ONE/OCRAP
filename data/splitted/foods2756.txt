review/summary: Love it!!!
review/text: I have been looking for this item since last winter. My store stopped carrying it (and I shop at four different grocery stores)I'm so glad I found it here. This is so very rich and smooth, I like the flavor but wish it came in a dark chocolate flavor. And I really agree about the coffee, it makes it so much better. Most cocoa mixes are like drinking colored water, this is so good and you don't need milk to get the thick and rich balance. LOOOOOVE IT !!!

review/summary: GREAT HOT CHOCOLATE FOR THE DIET CONSCIOUS!
review/text: I love this Nestle hot chocolate but have only been able to find it in the supermarkets for about $3.69 for eight servings.  When I came across these canisters at this great price, I immediately ordered it.<br /><br />It's a satisfying hot chocolate which has only 25 calories and comes out to just pennies a serving.  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Only available on Amazon!
review/text: I used to buy these little packets of my favorite diet Snapple flavor at  local pharmacy, and then they disappeared from the market. I ran to Amazon, where I usually buy anything that I cannot find at a local store.  The advantages are twofold: 1) they are cheaper than bottled Snapple and one does not have to deal with empties; 2)I can control the flavor by adding 2 packages to half a gallon of water, thus reducing the inevitable acid stomach.  And, of course, they are ideal for diabetics!

review/summary: Great price until the shipping...
review/text: This would've been a good deal if it was an Amazon Prime item, 24 sticks for the price, but you have to pay almost half again as much just for shipping.  So the value goes down, but as others have said, this is a hard to find item now.  I got these for my grandmother, who loves the peach snapple, and was saddened when a local brick and mortar stopped carrying them.  So for her, I'm willing to pay the premium while she's laid up recovering from an operation, but for myself I'd think by the time it was all done, I'd probably save money buying them by the case at a warehouse outlet since then i'd save my time of making each bottle.<br /><br />From just the product side though, it's 5 stars since she says it tastes just like the regular item.  From the whole deal perspective, i'd give a 3, so combining them I figure four stars for people who love this product.

I was taken aback by how much I liked this Valley Fresh canned chicken.  When I used these up, I bought the larger sized cans.  I will be buying more when I run out again and highly recommend it to everyone.  It does not taste salty nor have any after taste. It is just great tasting 'chicken'.

review/text: I came across this soda entirely by accident when I went out with some friends to a Peruvian restaurant. They didn't have much to offer for beverages and even though I normally don't drink soda I decided to give this Peruvian favorite a try. I liked it! It reminded me of cream soda with a hint of lime and very carbonated. I can't beleive that I ordered a six pack off of Amazon but I wanted to introduce it to some family members. Instead, when it arrived I stashed it away and lovingly and selfishly enjoyed each can until it was gone!

My family has always insisted, and that was a beautiful compliment for me.  The first time I used this extract, they said "we didn't think your pancakes could get any better....until now".  Vanilla Butter and Nut is added to all our home made baking recipes instead of just vanilla.  It makes all batter taste just like cake batter and the kids love it.  I also run an in home Christian preschool and daycare and my kids there love it just as much.  When my local store stopped carrying it, I ordered it  online.  I had to order a full box of six bottles, but it is well worth it.  We wouldn't use anything else :)

It is now thriving in window and my 7 year old goes outside on a bug hunt to find "Pavement" tiny ants to feed it. The ants are so tiny that one dead or maimed is enough to place on plant. At first he put it in flower. Which was soon picked off by my 3 year<br /> old. I was worried that this may harm plant but it appears to still be thriving. I may be wrong but I believe this plant stalk/leaves are able to absorb the nutrients from the bugs? As it appears to be sticky? Not sure as it has only been a week since flower bud was picked off by my son. All in all I found it tobe a fun houseplant to have especially with curious boys and of course the "Carnivorous" aspect is most thrilling!

review/text: I'm very impressed with the growth of this plant. It came in about 2-3 days after ordering even though I'm in Ohio. It arrived with the roots wrapped in a moist paper towel and rolled into a ziploc baggie with a completely intact flower! I followed the care sheet that came with the plant and it's been thriving ever since! It puts out a fresh flower every week or so and is growing like crazy. My order came with tons of New Zealand Sphagnum moss and I even have some left over! Great product, great seller!

review/text: I have yet to try this product personally, because it is not currently available at our supermarket. But my mother,  soon will be 94, mildly diabetic and a long-time customer for sugar-free products, says they are the best! For some reason our store carries the other Murray varieties, but not this one any more, maybe because there are so many kinds. Mother picks out her own groceries, and was in the habit of buying these about every other week. She bought two other Murray's packages this week, but really wanted the peanut butter. That's why I went searching the internet for them. After I receive them, (12 boxes!) I probably will keep at least one box to try for myself. (It would be nice to be able to buy an assortment from Amazon rather than so many of one variety--that would be a lot for a 94-year-old woman to eat, even if they are that good!)

review/summary: No Health Benefits and Grossly Overpriced....Read the Nutrition Facts
review/text: My wife just brought home a $3 package containing 5.5 oz of Murray Sugar Free Pecan Shortbread cookies, thinking the high price was justified on a health basis. It isn't. Read the Nutrition Facts (per 3 cookies): 160 Calories, 11 Grams of Fat, 3 Grams of Saturated Fat, 18 Grams of Carbohydrate....the same, or worse, than most cookies containing sugar. These cookies may be "sugar free", but the implied health benefit is completely imaginary. Furthermore, at over 50 cents per ounce they are the most expensive packaged grocery cookies you can buy, which is completely unjustified by ingredient cost, and flavor, which is adequate but not exceptional.<br /><br />It's an unfortunate fact that some companies prey upon consumers who seek or need "special" products by forcing them to pay huge premiums for the product. Using Murray's formula, a can of Diet Coke should cost at least $3....but it doesn't, simply because production costs do not justify the premium and the market will not tolerate such an unconscionable mark-up. Neither should you. Don't let your health or dietary concerns override your common sense and lead you to pay preposterously inflated prices for "special" products that, upon close inspection, provide no legitimate benefit.

But not these cookies they taste just like the regular cookies. I highly recommend them. You do not have to be a diabetic to eat them. They are made with splenda and I use splenda in a lot of things, I also use the brown sugar splenda in my cooking. These cookies are great.

review/text: First I will make note this page says sweetened with sorbitol, they are not. They are sweetened with Splenda.<br />I think they taste as good as any other basic vanilla creme cookie. I like a bite of sweet at night but sugar keeps me awake so these fit the bill. The special that was going on when I got them made it a great deal. They cost up to $3.99 a pack where I live.....so this is a SWEET deal.<br /><br />They still have calories so you cannot eat the whole bag but they don't spike your sugar. Three cookies are 130 calories and 6 gms of fat. They are very sweet anymore and you may feel sick.

review/text: Love these cookies! When I learned a couple of years ago that I was heading toward diabetes and needed to cut out as much sugar as I could I knew I needed a "sweet" substitute.  I tried various products and found Murray Sugar Free cookies. I like oatmeal cookies anyway so gravitated toward their cookie. I promise I couldn't tell they didn't have sugar in them. I'm so addicted to them that I even carry them when I travel (wonder what the suitcase inspectors think?!) My grandkids even recognize MY cookies and now ask for them over the sugar-loaded kind. Trouble is, I can never find them. I don't know if they're just very popular or the wholesaler doesn't bring enough. It could be that I buyt 4 to 6 packages every time I DO find them. Murray says I can find them at Wal-Mart but never have although they do have the other flavors. Now I look to Amazon and they don't have them either! I have a hint of how drunks feel when they can't get their liquor! Please, Amazon, hurry and get a supply before I run out!

review/summary: Diabetics With A Sweet-Tooth --- REJOICE!
review/text: When I was diagnosed with type-II diabetes about two years ago, it felt like a death blow. I mean, I love sweets. And my favorite were peanut butter cookies (my wife also made a mean peanut butter cheesecake that I still crave to this day but am able to hold off thanks to these Murray Sugar Free Cookies). I'd tried other sugar free items but they all had a seriously bad after-taste to them. The artificial sweetners were pretty bad.<br /><br />But the Murray brand are pretty darned good. And I can eat about 6 of them that equal 32 carbs (I'm a tall guy --- 6 feet, three inches --- with a big frame). There's no horrible after-taste and the peanut butter flavor is just enough to satisfy my slavering pallete.<br /><br />If you're looking for a quality cookie that won't shoot your blood sugar up into the statosphere, these are a great option.

review/summary: Fab, as long as you understand what's in them!
review/text: My fiance & I are following a reduced carbohydrate eating plan.  Given that these are sugar free, they are great for when you need something sweet, but with a slighter glycemic impact than regular cookies.<br />They taste almost like Girl Scout Thin Mint patty cookies!  They are NOT, however, low in calories, or free from ingredients that some may feel are "unhealthy".<br />Since people's ideas vary greatly as to what is bad for them & what is okay, there is some understandable controversy.  In my opinion, most of America is over weight because they don't know HOW to eat, but that's just my take on things.  Everything is conflicting.  Low carbohydrate foods are higher in calories & vice verse.  I have an extreme digestive sensitivity to Malitol (Maltitol), which is a sweetener used in most sugar free chocolate items.  While these cookies don't contain Malitol (Maltitol),there are very few items available that are without it.<br />Bottom Line: They taste great!  My suggestion would be to check the ingredient list & nutritional information each & every time you purchase, I recommend purchasing in a grocery store, rather than online.

review/text: For people avoiding sugar, Murray Sugar Free Cookies Oatmeal, are good enough! This whole thing about sugar free products got me intrigued and confused at the same time. Some products that advertised as being sugar free have a lot of other sources of sugar, like alcohol, that are high. The feeling I get with Murray's is that they are reliable in their claims. I see them in all sorts of reputable publications and that gives me encouragement regarding their advertisement. As to the taste I can say they are pretty good tasting. Have tried their other ones and this one and the chocolate are the ones I favor. Who am I? Hungry hungry all the time for sweets but I realize not all sugar free items are created equal. For now a decent 4 stars rating!

What was surprising, however, was that I liked them, too!  As a rule, I do not like peanut butter anything, and can barely stand the smell of it.  But these cookies aren't your typical peanut butter cookie.  They are pleasantly fragrant, delicately buttery and crisp (no mealiness like most others), with good-sized pieces of peanuts mixed in. Just delicious!

I picked up a package of these and used them for a cookie crust on a cream pie with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HVD4">Jell-O Sugar-Free Instant Pudding & Pie Filling, Chocolate, 1.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)</a> and whipped cream lightly sweetened with non-sugar sweetener. The result was gorgeous and tasted pretty good even to those of us who can have sugar. For him? He told me "You know I can't have sugar." and when I told him it was sugar free he dug in with gusto. He said "It's not even my birthday and I feel like I got the best present."<br />It was so easy to make, and the crust was his favorite part. I gave him an extra package of cookies I bought and he enjoyed those a lot too.<br />Love these for making it so much easier to make special treats for my uncle.

review/summary: Big Chocolate Taste
review/text: I could EASILY gain 15-20lbs from Halloween until New Years Day so this year my husband and I decided to try not to go overboard on all the cookies/candy that is so available.<br /><br />I bought these cookies thinking they would be a poor substitute but SURPRISE, they really do have a huge chocolately taste and while they won't take the place of home-made fudge or gourmet chocolates, they are still satisfying.<br /><br />They are tiny, not much bigger than a life saver really and come in 80 calorie packages so I don't have to worry about portion control. Also, it can be hard to get enough fiber in your diet every day so I like the fact that these have 3 grams of fiber per package. My husband is a type II diabetic and these do have 16 grams of carbs but because of the fiber, they don't spike his blood sugar.<br /><br />The only downside to these is they do have 3g sugar alcohol which can cause some people stomach upset.<br /><br />I'm still probably going to have goodies this holiday season but with these cookies in my pantry, I know I won't indulge as often.

review/text: I have tried several types of Murray sugar free cookies and can say that they have all been good and the "Fudge Dipped Mint Cookies" are no exception. These are not quite as good as regular cookies but, being diabetic friendly, are a good alternative.<br /><br />Recommended!

review/text: So here I am thinking I'm getting a great tasting cookie with Splenda only to find out they use Hydrogenated Oils.  On top of that they use the worst kind of oil, Palm and Palm Kernel.<br /><br />Don't be fooled into thinking you are getting something Heather because it has no sugar.  I would rather eat a tablespoon of sugar then these cookies.<br /><br />I totally feel this is a misrepresentation!  Shame.

review/summary: Smart move for Sweet Tooths
review/text: Sugar free bites are a great way to satisfy the sweet desire in all of us...but without unnecessary and unhealthy sugars and fats. The 80-calorie packs are perfect to throw in the snack drawer at work. Now, if Murray would only put some of its other non-chocolate choices into these packs, it would be great! (Sigh...yes, I love chocolate, but I'm a migraineur and chocolate is only a rare treat for me since it is a key migraine headache trigger...)

review/summary: Best Sugar Free Cookie~You get 8 as a serving :)
review/text: It is hard to believe these are sugar free. They are so good. They are buttery and rich tasting and a serving is 8 cookies of 130 calories. That is so filling and yet still keeps you on whatever plan you are following.<br /><br />I have tried many of the flavors of these cookies and not found one to be bad or have an aftertaste. This one is my all time favorite. You will not be disappointed. In my town they are usually $3.99 a pack so this is a fantastic deal.<br /><br />They come with a long expiration date also.

review/summary: Disappointed with Amazon
review/text: Not sure how I feel about the product, Murray Sugar Free Cookies. My disappointment is with Amazon for sending EXPIRED COOKIES. After notifying Amazon I received an apology email and a new delivery was sent to recipent. I was shocked to receive a second call from the recepient that the 2nd delivery was also EXPIRED having the same expiration date as the first delivery. Next thing I know I receive an email from Amazon my money is being refunded. Have no idea what happened. I was embarrassed and disappointed the first time. Imagine my embarrassment the second time. The recepient is a diabetic and loves Murray Sugar Free Cookies but she is only able to find Shortbread in our stores and Peanut Butter is her favorite.

I scoured the net and this was the best offer for bulk buckwheat which is not that easy to come by.

review/summary: Jelly Belly's are the Best
review/text: Needed some bulk quantity jelly beans to fill small jars for baby shower favors.  Buying them this way saved a lot of money over buying them by the pound at the local candy store.  As stated in another review, the jelly beans just come in an unlined cardboard box.  This seemed a bit odd, but there were 2 sheets of wax paper, I guess to prevent dust, etc from getting into the box through the top and bottom.  Not much else to say, they're Jelly Belly's at about half the cost of the local guy!

review/text: The beans are good.  But it's very hard to get the packet open and when you're running if you DO tear it on the little notch (which is hard to see) the whole side of the packet tears away and you can lose all your beans.<br /><br />Come on!  How hard is it to improve the packaging?  It's probably easier to empty them in a ziplock and carry with you.<br /><br />Do you think the manufacturers ever read the product reviews????

review/text: I'm training for my first marathon, and order a package of these after hearing good things about them on a message board about marathons.  I have to say, I've been very happy with how they work for me.  I was really having problems maintaining pace after the two hour mark, and had tried various gels, etc. but always seemed to lose about 2 minutes/mile off my pace after two hours.  It may have been training breakthrough, it may have been strictly pyschological, but after I started snacking on the beans at the 1:45 mark, I started sustaining pace, and have actually been able to knock out my last mile on the same pace as my opening mile.<br /><br />Of course, not garunteed to work for everyone, everyone's system processes these things differently, but for right now, I'm believing in the magic beans.

review/text: Ok, these are not really that healthy. They are made with fruit juice which is better than corn syrup BUT they still have canuba wax and the electrolytes are added not natural and no complex carbs( you need brown rice syrup to be a complex carb and has the natural electrolytes- like in Sharkies). These leave a coating in my mouth(from the wax). These are really glorified jelly beans. I feel no energyboost and they mess up my blood sugar. If you want the real deal get sharkies.

They are easy to take along and very easy to eat.  They break down nicely in your mouth and are easily digested.  The flavors are tasty so you don't cringe when eating them during a hard run.  Also- it is a jelly bean- what better texture?!  I just moved to a tropical climate (Hawaii) and can't find them in stores here.  I need them to help with my training since it is so hot- the electrolytes and vitamins will really make a difference.  Planning on buying them on Amazon.

Also, the benefits of these little guys truly show in your timed results; they help get you across the finish line.<br /><br />I have a tiny pouch in the sportsbottle I carry during my runs and races. I just open the package of beans when lining up at the start and tuck them in the bottle pouch. Then I pop one bean at a time in my mouth during the course of the race.<br />The flavor burst keeps my senses entertained too.

review/text: I used these Jelly Beans to help me train for my first marathon.  They taste good and seem to work although I did not seem to get as much of a boost as some of my friends say they have. I would only eat 2-4 at a time so maybe I need to eat a few more to get the full energy boost.<br /><br />I agree with some of the other reviewers in that, although the little bag is resealable, it is still sometimes hard to open while you are jogging/running/walking.<br /><br />Nice product.
