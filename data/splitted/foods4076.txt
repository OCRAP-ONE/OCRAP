review/summary: Have to Hide These
review/text: I bought these recently as a Friday special for a great price.  These came quickly and I have one bag open and the others hidden so I don't eat them all.  These are huge bags and the candy is nice and fresh.  Wish the peanut butter ones would come in bags like these and sold thru Amazon, not another seller who charges shipping.  Thanks for the good sale on these.

review/text: What can I say..Amazon does it again...A huge amount of M&M's for a very small price.<br />What makes this a good deal as well is that they are all the individually wrapped M&M packages.<br />These are a great size for snacks, desserts, etc. where you don't want to sit and eat 300 of them...

review/text: I loved this great purchase at less than ten bucks, and they're M&Ms!  What's to say about them?  If you haven't had them, go out and buy a pack, they're a fantastic candy!  I prefer the ones with almonds best, but considering how cheap the milk chocolate version was, I wasn't going to pass up a great deal like that!  Thanks Amazon, I will keep coming back!

review/summary: Good Cold Shipping by Amazon
review/text: No need to review the product because I'm sure most people in the U.S. who are able to eat peanuts have had these.  These arrived fresh and in good condition.  I can't give even peanut M&Ms more than 4 stars since I think the chocolate used in these products keeps getting worse and worse over time; but they are still a fun, enjoyable snack.<br /><br />I ordered this along with a box of Snickers with Almonds, and Amazon included, as part of my Prime membership, a free "cold pack".<br /><br />This consisted of a very thick and sturdy Styrofoam lidded box, in which the candies were packed, along with four large cold-pack freezable units.<br /><br />The item was in shipping transit for approximately 3 days, and delivered to a hot, humid region.<br /><br />Upon opening the container, I found that the candies were still cold and in good condition, although the cold-packs were no longer frozen or really cold.<br /><br />Amazon did a great job on packing this.  Thought I would share that, in case others are concerned about ordering such products from this company.  I'm even keeping the Styrofoam chest and cold-packs for re-use, since they are of pretty nice quality.

I love the size of this bag because it fills a candy dish that I have out completely with a few left over for me to eat up right away.

review/summary: I received my M&Ms just fine.
review/text: I ordered the 4 large bags. I received them in a timely manner and appreciated that they were shipped in a minimal amount of packaging. The four bags were simply shrink wrapped together and put in the box with my other items. I have only opened one bag so far but the M&M's were in great condition. Great price, delicious product, excellent service.<br /><br />Edit (10/01/10)- The price for these is now $35 more than when I bought them the first time. I can buy these for less than $10 a bag at the store. So the price is now closer to ridiculous then great.

review/text: A pair of these giant bags of your basic peanut M&M's sort of shrinkwrapped together, for the same price others are selling just one bag.  I took these as a gift for a friend in Italy who hadn't been able to find them there.  I had to pull one out of my suitcase to get it back under the weight requirements and put it in my carryon, no problems with either.  My friend was delighted when they arrived and began snacking happily away immediately.

review/summary: **********  READ THIS FIRST PLEASE ************
review/text: First off, the initial arrival:  It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat!  Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats

review/summary: I've found my new favorite tea!
review/text: This tea is amazing.  I've tried several brands of black tea with berries, but the berry flavor usually tastes artificial and a bit syrupy to me.  After giving up on black tea w/berries and sticking to white or herbal tea for that sweeter flavor, someone gave me a tin of Polar Berry for Christmas.  I fell in love from the first taste!  I've never been obsessed with buying natural/organic products, but I can definitely taste the difference in this tea.  The flavor is more balanced, lighter, and the berry flavor is the first I've tasted that isn't artificial!  I mix in just a hint of milk and sugar.  It's the perfect breakfast tea, but good at any time of day.  Of course I would fall in love with something I can't find in stores...But Amazon to the rescue!

review/summary: Black Tea with Cranberries and Spices
review/text: This tea can be mixed with milk powder and stevia or can be sweetened just with honey or stevia. I like it both ways but the cranberries and spices do seem to be more intense when I just add honey. The actual ingredients include: Organic and Fair Trade Certified black tea, organic cinnamon, organic cranberries, organic allspice, organic hibiscus and organic licorice root. This is a fairly strong tea but I still use two eco-friendly tea sachets per mug. If you like drinks like hot apple cider then you will probably love this tea.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: The coffe is really great, makes very aromatic, full bodied espresso.  I would just like to review the packaging more. I ordered several packs of these, packaged in bricks of 4, vacuum-packed, and covered with clear plastic. Very impressed because of the efficiency of packaging, very tightly packed. Of the 3 sets I ordered,  one set had one of the bricks with a punch hole at the bottom, seems mysterious since the clear plastic covering the 4 bricks was in no way punched and remained intact. It's just the one brick with the punch hole at the bottom. I wonder how it got that way. Anyway, this would have been 5-stars but for that. Highly recommend the coffee.

review/text: I bought this to use with a 3 cup espresso maker.  This stuff seems to last quite a while, even though I fill up the holding dish to the top.  The espresso tastes great and in my opinion (if you flavor it right) is just as good or better than many of the coffee products that you can purchase that are made for you (aka starbucks, caribou, etc).  Buying it in the 4 pack also brings down cost quite a bit.<br /><br />Overall, a great product and highly recommended.  It is a very bold flavor, so if you aren't in to dark and bold coffee then beware.

Although it has a very high concentration of robusta beans (60 or 70%) instead of the market-favored arabica beans (40 or 30%),  it's the robusta beans which produce such an excellent creamy and rich crema, from both my stove-top espresso maker and my Nespresso machine (I fill my own home-made capsules with this brand...see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005UP1M4I">Ne-Cap Nespresso� Compatible Refill Capsules</a> ), and the espresso is absolutely perfect. No bitterness, just rich, dark and flavorful. Would buy again if it goes on sale (the Amazon price is still better than NYC supermarkets which sell one pack for $4.75),

review/summary: like the taste
review/text: My girlfriend and I prefer Lavazza over anything. We prefer the crema that Lavazza seems to produce better than other brands. This Creme e Gusto is superb (for a pre-ground). We always prefer to grind our own beans but we like to have a backup that is pre-ground for company so we can quickly make espressos without a lot of waiting between cups. We've tried several Lavazza pre-ground and all are pleasing, this is no exception. you aren't taking any chances here, except for a slightly higher-than-prefered price.

review/summary: Great Espresso, Robusta Causing Headaches
review/text: I love this espresso coffee, it makes such a nice cup of espresso with an amazing crema.  It's very consistent and the flavor is smooth, however I have noticed that I get a major headache after drinking an espresso made with this coffee.  I am making it properly with the right amount of coffee so I know it's not that.  It's also not the caffeine since I drink drip coffee almost every day.  That leaves really one thing which is the robusta beans that is blended with arabica to make this coffee.<br /><br />Great coffee, just not for me and if anyone else experiences this then it's the robusta beans so just try another 100% arabic blend, it comes out good anyways.

review/text: I've tried just about anything when it comes to ground coffee for espresso machines, and nothing comes close to this Lavazza. I've been ordering it regularly for over a year now, and am very happy with it. It makes an espresso rich in taste and smell, with a pleasant hint of chocolate flavor (you can barely notice it). It certainly helps me start my day the right way!

review/text: After spending almost $5.00 a day for months at Starbucks on iced lattes with an extra shot, I finally got wise and did some research on Amazon. After purchasing an espresso maker, I had to find a quality espresso to go along with it. The description is 100% accurate. Smooth and not bitter. This is the best espresso I have ever tasted. Thank goodness I can order it from Amazon.

review/summary: Great Coffee, Honey!
review/text: I was enthralled with the coffee I was served in Florence, Italy years ago and brought some home.  Now, it's available in the U.S. and it's Lavazza.  My local market used to sell it and no longer does but amazon comes through for us.  The flavor is intense but not harsh and has a slight mocha flavor (at least to my untrained palate).  The only negative is my own fault by not noticing that I was ordering a 4-pack, so I have more than I need.  After giving one away to someone who probably won't appreciate it, I'm going to keep the rest and transport myself back to Florence every morning.  The grind is fine enough for an espresso maker but also works for drip makers, although you should use less than usual at first.  It's pretty strong.  Americans are inundated with choices of coffee these days, but I highly recommend trying Lavazza if you're a regular coffee drinker.  The price was very reasonable, even with the shipping.  Share the cost and product with 3 friends at first to give it a try.<br />Ciao

review/summary: Best espresso ever!
review/text: I used to buy only coffee that I could grind in the supermarket since I wanted the best possible espresso from my machine. However, I just moved to an urban area where I am unable to grind my own coffee conveniently (outside my home). So I searched on Amazon and found this coffee, which has excellent reviews. I figured it couldn't be better than freshly ground coffee, but that it was better than getting some old gross coffee from the convenience store across the street. Much to my and my boyfriend's surprise, this coffee makes much better espresso than any other coffee we have tried over the past few years (and we have tried many, including expensive coffee from Whole Foods). I don't know about the other blends from this brand, but if you like strong rich espresso, this one is AMAZING. Try it, and you'll see.

review/text: I bought this on a whim after some sporadic experience with an old, trusted roaster....  This is a very nice new taste for me.  It's a bit lighter roast than the two espresso roasts that I have been using.  It's got a nice, delicate taste that asks to be made on the strong side to show its best character.  I haven't bought ground coffee in many years, so this whole experience was a bit of a lark for me but I'm glad I tried it.  I'm using in a LaPavoni machine and a Moka rig and they're both working well with the grind as arrived.

review/text: I was an avid fan of the Lavazza Cafe Espresso (black can) for years.  I was about to sign up for the subscription service for this product on Amazon.com when I started reading the reviews about the Lavazza Crema e Gusto. One of my main concerns is if the acid in a coffee will give me an upset stomach.  The Cafe Espresso didn't at all, so I was leery to switch to something else.  I figured I'd give the Crema e Gusto a try and if it was too much for my stomach, I'd switch back.  No worries.  Not only is this a smooth blend, it has a richer taste than the Cafe Espresso.  I won't need to switch back!

review/text: I have always loved the coffee in Italy and it's the only place where I consistently drink cappuccinos - no bitterness, bite or overwhelming strong flavor, just great coffee.  Until we decided to give this coffee I try, we were unable to duplicate that Italian espresso flavor.  Now we can!  We've given up all of our other gourmet espresso blends and drink only this in our lattes, cappuccinos, mochas and Americanos.  And everyone we've shared this coffee with has done the same!  Try it - I'll be surprised if you're disappointed!

review/text: We originally purchased the Lavazza Crema y Gusto coffee pack when it went on sale, but I am re-ordering at full price because of the taste.<br /><br />Not sure if it's the blend or the roast, but it's a superior coffee by every measure. Flavor is full and robust, but not at all bitter. It's hard to describe it's smoothness without hyperbole, but try it once and you'll find yourself at a loss for words also. If you are used to the strength of a French press but want the silky smoothness of a breakfast blend, this coffee is for you.<br /><br />Vacuum packed into foil bricks for freshness. Do yourself, your spouse, and your office mates a huge favor and give it a try - and be prepared to start writing your own five star review.

review/summary: Lavazza Crema e Gusto Coffee
review/text: Lavazza crema e gusto is the best coffee. When you sip it, you can really tell that it has the true flavor of a good coffee.  I have it used for at least 20 years. My day is not the same, if I do not use my Lavazza Crema e Gusto Coffee. I can taste the difference between this coffee and the quality of other coffees. It has become our ritual for my husband and I to have an "Espressiata" as he calls it before he goes to work. This coffee makes my day. Mary Ann Vitale

review/summary: fancy coffee shop taste and smell
review/text: one day recently, i purchased this crema e gusto lavazza when it was on sale, because i know my friend uses lavazza in his espresso-maker, and i thought i'd break out the moka maker again.  well.  holy cow.  i had forgotten what good coffee tasted like, based on my steady kcup habit.  i can barely taste my keurig kcups now, which seem fairly bland, or too sharp, or too...something else wrong in comparison. i'll still use my keurig due to the convenience, and perhaps i'll try using lavazza in my keurig as another review mentioned.  But, i think you cannot go wrong with a stove top moka of this stuff.  it is not bitter, it is not sour, it has no off notes-- just extremely rich and heady, a good hefty body and smoothness that can't be beat.  the outrageously excellent aroma permeates the house like a great coffee shop you might step into.<br /><br />i read some of the bad reviews, and i can't understand the negative comments, just as they can't understand the good reviews--taste is individual i guess!  But, i LOVE this coffee!  it's extremely good, and i will even drink it late in the evening despite the caffeine, due to the wonderful flavor. crazily, i find myself looking forward to a quiet weekend morning to indulge, just like you might see on some goofy ad where a woman with closed eyes is smiling in dreamy wonder while sniffing a cup. try this coffee- maybe you'll be lucky to be in the majority for whom this rings all the bells.<br /><br />update: i tried the Lavazza in the Keurig, and it just does not do it justice in comparison to the stove-top moka method. but, it still tastes better than regular k-cups.<br /><br />update 2: i tried this in the Aeropress (french drip type) machine that had over 1000 great reviews here on Amazon, and i have to say, this combo will be my only go-to coffee from now on.  the Aeropress, in addition to being easier to use than stove top, seems to make a less burnt flavored and more creamy brew.  this, combined with condensed sweetened milk (like the Vietnam-french drip type)is heavenly. i'm buying a second Aeropress to have this combo at home in addition to the office.

review/text: I ordered after reading all the reviews here.First time I made, I was hooked.Now its been 2 years.<br /><br />You need the right tools/steps to get the perfect taste though.<br /><br />1.Use a Bialetti espresso maker,if you can.<br />2.Don't stuff the filter all the way up,if you are making one cup only.<br />3.If you like milk with it, I suggest shaking the milk in a bottle, till it becomes frothy(you can use a milk frother as well,but just more cleaning etc.) and then add it on top, the flavour is completely different as compared to just pouring the milk in.<br />4.Enjoy.

review/summary: wonderful coffee, the best, easy on the stomach
review/text: It is not have a bitter taste as a few have suggested.  I always use a melitta cup for making any espresso coffee and this one is just delicious.  I checked my ph strip and it does not register as acid.  It doesn't bother my stomach at all and I am super sensitive to anything acid.  American coffee I have a hard time tolerating; the Italian and Kenya coffees that are dark roast espresso are thought by some people via their processing techniques and quality to be alkaline.  It makes the American coffee look like junk for how the body responds and the taste. Once you have had this coffee you won't want American coffee anymore.<br /><br />In case anyone is wondering what a melitta cup is, it is a cone made from plastic or ceramic (mine is ceramic) and it has a hole at the bottom.  I adjust the coffee filter to fit it and then put the espress coffee in it and then pour my hot water from the tea kettle into it.  I add a little nut milk into the coffee and I am ready to enjoy a wonderful taste.  It beats dealing with a coffee maker any day.  Each person in the family can have their own melitta cup as it is so quick to do.

review/summary: too coarse for espresso
review/text: This coffee is ground too coarsely to make decent espresso in either of my two Capresso machines.  I filled the portafilter to the top and tamped as hard as I could, but when I brew the water runs through the filter way too fast.  I get about 3 oz. of coffee in 10 seconds instead the ideal 1 oz. in 25 seconds.  This results in strong coffee instead of actual espresso.  I've tried to make this as regular coffee in a french press as well, but the 70% robusto bean in the blend makes for a pretty bland cup of coffee.

review/summary: Burnt taste nothing like Lavazza
review/text: I bought this from Amazon since they don't have this kind of coffee locally. I had purchased the identical brand and boldness about a year ago.  Wow, this stuff doesn't even taste like what I had originally! It has an awful burnt taste that lingers as an aftertaste. It really doesn't even compare to what I had before. They must have changed the beans or reduced the quality because it is not smooth at all and has a bitterness and aftertaste that reminds me of the lingering taste after smoking a cigarette. I've decided to switch brands completely. No returns it so I'm stuck with 3 1/2 bricks of sub-par coffee grounds.

review/summary: Refreshing coffee, a hit with the office
review/text: deployed in the military doesn't always mean you need to miss out on the finer things in life. Another co-worker and myself enjoy our coffee everyday and talking about the brewing smells that come with it. I was able to snag this for 3 bucks a brick. This is some smooth and great tasting coffee. The taste going down your throat is amazing and when we open a new vacuum sealed bag we both take a big whiff of that great ground coffee smell. It makes a pretty strong cup of joe(caffeine too) and not for that bad of a price. Our bags don't expire until the end of 2012 but we don't have to worry about that since we are on our third bag already... this won't replace our regular brands but is a good change. thanks to amazon for shipping this to us.

review/summary: excellent taste, decaf please
review/text: My absolute favorite. So smooth and not bitter at all.  With cream and sugar it tastes like premium coffee ice cream.  I use it in my small drip coffee maker, because I'm usually too busy to make with the espresso maker.  It tastes the same either way, just with less water.<br /><br />My only issue with it is that after drinking it every day for six months I developed heart palpitations. I previously was not a daily coffee drinker, so that probably has something to do with it, but I am only in my early thirties. They don't make a decaf version, and I have yet to find one that tastes as smooth.  So now it's only for special occasions, never days in a row.<br /><br />So if you are sure your heart is VERY healthy (I thought mine was before I had issues), go for it.  But tread lightly, and be sure to keep well hydrated.

review/text: One taste was all it took for me. I tried Lavazza at a local coffee house in Denver and really enjoyed the taste. No bitterness at all. Very full flavored coffee.<br /><br />I came across this as the word "Crema" caught my eye. Now I am ordering it using the subscribe and save. It is running me $17.41 for every order and that's with free 2 day shipping because of the Prime Membership.<br /><br />Each brick lasts about 10 days for 2 people drinking 6 cups of coffee every morning. I use 1 tablespoon coffee for every 6 ounces of water brewed in a Target Michael Graves design automatic drip coffeemaker. The "Flavor" button really brings it out in this coffee. I love my coffee with half and half and it really seems to compliment it well.<br /><br />The packages are vacuumed sealed and take up very little space. It really is a 5 star coffee.

review/summary: Rich and flavorful - even from the "wrong" pot!
review/text: I found a brick of Lavazza Crema e Gusto at a local shop some months ago, and tried it in my stovetop espresso maker. For some reason I thought the grind was what I needed (it *does* have a picture of a stovetop machine on it!) but the grind is really very fine, more like what a professional-type machine needs.<br /><br />But this works even in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001DJT7G">Bialetti Brikka 4-Cup Stovetop Percolator</a> stovetop machine, and generates a beautiful crema. The Brikka really wants a slightly coarser grind, so I have to be *very* careful to put in the coffee with a light touch, and not to pack it down even a tiny bit.<br /><br />The flavor, as others have written, is very rich without being too dark-roasted, with lovely chocolatey notes. Bitterness can come if I overfill the maker so that the coffee is packed too hard, which causes boiling and burning. So care must be taken when using a stovetop maker. But it's truly worth it, because it gives such delicious coffee.

review/summary: Not the greatest, but not the worst either.
review/text: I drink espresso (moka) daily, and go through a 250g/8.8oz brick in about 2 weeks. In my opinion, this isn't the greatest blend from Lavazza that I've had, but it's not the worst coffee I've had either (it definitely beats the drip coffee I'd otherwise get at work). It's a 70/30 robusta/arabica blend, a dark roast with a fruity though noticeably bitter finish (but not as bad as Starbucks or Peet's coffee). The Lavazza Espresso (black tin, 100% arabica claimed) tastes better than this blend, but after having tried Illy's moka grind, the different blends from Lavazza, Kimbo, Segafredo, and also blends from the local coffee roasters, I actually think that a robusta/arabica blend works best for a moka pot; just not this one. Overall, I'd say that I got what I paid for, but I didn't get what I wanted and I was seduced by the 93 or so 4/5 star reviews for this coffee. I'd really give it a 2.5 or 3 but then again, all taste is subjective, That being said, this is a reasonable coffee (considering taste vs. price), but I'll probably switch back to my regular (and unfortunately more expensive) blend.
