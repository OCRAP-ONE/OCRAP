review/text: This subtly flavored, sweet-but-not-too-sweet dessert makes the most extraordinary fruit salad.  Just cook and set it as the instructions suggest, then toss it with tidbits of brightly colored fruit that harmonizes nicely with almond.  I suggest pomegranate seeds and mandarins for a lovely contrast... don't feel married to the canned fruit salad the packet suggests, as fresh tart fruit is much nicer with it.

review/summary: Fake Vanilla Taste--Skip It!
review/text: I bought this newly-packaged large-sized product to use in my coffee when staying in a hotel for 2 weeks and wanting something better than the powdered Cremora often provided. (Usually you see these International Delights as single-use packets at gas station convenience stores.) Although the French Vanilla's consistency was like cream, the vanilla taste was **extremely** fake. When I looked at the ingredient list on the label to figure out what was causing the off taste, the label was elusive in saying only that it contained "natural" flavors rather than coming clean as to whether it had real vanilla (very doubtful) or the artificial-tasting "vanillin." They may technically call "vanillin" natural, but it's not the authentic flavoring and you can readily tell the difference. I disliked it so much that I ended up pouring it down the sink. I DEPLORE PRODUCTS THAT DON'T STATE ALL OF THEIR INGREDIENTS HONESTLY ON THEIR LABELS in order to try to get away with making formulations with cheap substitutes. Make a creamer with REAL VANILLA and don't dilute it with molasses or other cheap ingredients and/or preservatives, and I will readily pay for it! Meanwhile, I will never buy this International Delight again.

review/summary: Great Salt, Good price
review/text: I bought a pound of this salt and I love it.  It is a great finishing salt, very delicate and flavorful.  Gets lost in the pan, so save it for the final splash.  It comes in a zip top bag for storage.  It is medium fine grain and small flakes, moist and white to slightly grey.  The package says Premium, Fine, No. II by Le Tresor.  I have had better salt direct from Guerande, but it cost more.

review/summary: Outstanding delight
review/text: I am someone who enjoys a very occassional glass of wine but not brandy or other liquors very much. This chocolate was a true delight to the senses! The dark chocolate has a slight unsweet/bitter flavor with the alcohol being sweet sends the senses dashing with pleasure. It is smooth. I enjoy a small bite of the end of the chocolate piece an slowly sip the brandy and continue to nibble the dark chocolate. The after taste is lasting with a pleasant flavor. I would recommend this product to friends and family.

review/summary: This was a different experience for me...
review/text: I was hunting for Gen Mai Cha when I stumbled upon another tea made buy the same manufacturer. I never had Hoji tea before. I knew from reviews of it that it was a golden colored tea. That it is. It was a blend of some odd stuff to me but that is the nature of tea blends. Hoji tea has a very unique flavor I never had before. Now the Genmai Cha made by SA is off the hook. This tea likewise is an excellent compliment for some meals. I would find it a prefect counterbalance to Teriyaki dishes. I would even drink this while eating tempura. It has a strange smoky woody taste. It is not bitter at all either like conventional tea can be. Some people say it has a seaweed like smell to it but this brand has a smell that reminds me of a field that has been burned and tilled for the next season's planting. It is not a smokey smell per say but a earthy smell. There is no chlorophyll like tinge of a cut grass field to this tea. This may not be everyone's cup of tea but I can say for myself this is another very high quality product. It is not as expensive as Gen Mai but for those needing something different tea wise I would recommend giving this a spin! If other Hoji teas let you down this one will not!<br /><br />This was a remarkable introduction to Hoji tea for me! I think a lesser product would have not done it for me!

review/summary: A Gluten-Free Staple...
review/text: In some ways it bothers me the way I depend on Lundberg Family Farms products for so much of my daily food...if it weren't for this company this celiac would've starved to death by now!<br />These chips are absolutely wonderful, fantastic, and delicious!!! They are great on the road. They are a staple of my diet, as there is not much I can safely eat with my "truckload" of food allergies. If I had a complaint, it would be that they don't make the bags in any size larger than 6oz...Frankly 6oz. doesn't go very far for the $. That's why I'm so grateful to be able to get them through Amazon. Otherwise, I'd be much more hungry more often!

review/text: I liked these chips a lot. Reasonably priced, relatively healthy, and taste pretty good.  The chips have great textrue and are quite crunchy.  The wasabi flavor is good but a little bit on the mild side (not too surprising since the chip has to appeal to a lot of different palettes). The chips can sometimes be dense and crumbly so they're not always great for dipping.  Overall a very unique chip that I will be getting again.

I have to say that I love these chips.  I've tried some of the other flavors by the same company, and by far the Sea Salt is my favorite.

review/text: I'm always on the lookout for a good, natrual chip to snack on. Not that I don't love Doritos or cheese curls, but those chemically-boosted flavors tend to overwhelm my palette. Lately I've been investigating the world of natural "junk food". My only nod to the mainstream manufacturers is to stock the Frito Lay corn chips (fritos). They're corn, oil, and salt. And they're tasty.<br />But I digress...<br />Lundberg's Nacho Cheese chips are fantastic, certainly keeping my palette interested when I'm in a training routing and have to cut out most complex carbohydrates.

review/summary: Best gluten-free item out there!
review/text: I don't usually take the extra time to write reviews, but felt I should for this product because these chips are SO good and have been a lifesaver for my family (we're all gluten-free). As a general rule, we just avoid packaged foods, but the kids eat these chips for snack quite frequently, and my husband and I love them, too. They remind me a little bit of Bugles (the corn chip things), only without the nastiness. For those who have corn sensitivities (we do), these have masa corn in them, which our naturopath says is a different thing than regular corn and won't cause problems. Yummy. Only complaint I can think of is that they could pack more into a bag...there's a lot of air. The price on Amazon is significantly less than what we pay for these in the grocery store, so we order them in bulk every few weeks.

review/summary: Migraine Food!
review/text: Sure they're tasty, but they trigger a migraine in MSG sensitive people.<br />Also, they contain corn, which also contributes to their tastiness I'm sure,<br />but seems silly for a "Rice" chip, which is what I thought I was buying to avoid corn.

review/summary: My mistake, but there is some good news.
review/text: I didn't read the fine print...my mistake.  They should have called these Rice/Corn Chips.  Corn flour is the third ingredient so they taste more like a corn chip than a rice chip. They also have over four times more fat than a rice cracker<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ETC9II">Sesmark Rice Thins, Brown Rice, 3.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>. Now for the good news. Like many things that are not that good for you, they are really,really...good. Excellent taste and crunch.  So if you're not a health nut like me, go for it.  They're great!

The 6-oz package is the right size - a lot of recipes call for this amount directly, but it's also easy to weigh out different amounts if you have a kitchen scale.  The chunks melt very smoothly whether you are using a microwave or a double-boiler on the stove.

review/text: Until about a year ago my favorite whole-bean espresso was Green Mountain Organic.  They stopped selling that as beans so I searched for a replacement.  I wanted something low in caffeine and not expensive.  Eventually I learned that Lavazza is the best bargain around and found their Top Class blend to be a very good replacement.  Here are my impressions of some of the Lavazza whole-bean espressos:<br /><br />Pienaroma - high acid, low aroma, fruity, medium roast, mild, low caffeine.<br />Super Crema - high acid, medium roast, mild, low caffeine.<br />Grand Espresso - low acid, high aroma, medium roast, spicy finish, high caffeine.<br />Top Class - moderate acid, aroma, and caffeine; medium/dark roast, spicy finish.

My first thought was that it was reminiscent of Razzmatazz or some type of raspberry liquer, which to me is a big plus.<br /><br />I then brewed up a cup of hot cocoa, put a shot of espresso in it, 1 1/2 pumps of Amoretti Raspberry syrup, 1 1/2 pumps of Amoretti White Chocolate syrup, topped it with chocolate whipped cream and had myself a nice White Chocolate Raspberry Mochaccino.  So far I have to say that this flavor is a winner.<br /><br />I can't wait to try this on ice cream or some other type of dessert!

Baked with it a few days later and was impressed by the taste but it was not very strong. So I kept feeding it for a couple weeks and now it has blossomed into a wonderfully strong culture. The aroma makes me smile every time I feed it. I live in South Florida and there must be really great little critters floating around to help it grow. Thanks for the great starter but now I think my 'pet' has graduated into the big league.

review/summary: Great Product From a Great Company
review/text: With all of the warnings on the internet on how things can go wrong with getting started with sourdough, I anticipated I would probably screw this up pretty thoroughly. Luckily, my fears were unfounded. The instructions included were detailed and were supplemented by a large amount of information on their website. I had a question through the second day and they responded immediately with an answer (I was afraid I might have inadvertently made yogurt instead of bread, but the smell was normal) . By the third day, the starter was developing just the way it should (probably because I didn't have to worry about maintaining temperature in Florida). By the fourth day, I had bread. Keep in mind, you are dealing with living organisms, so it's not like buying a TV. It's more like buying Sea Monkeys that you can eat (just don't picture those adorable cartoon monkeys when you make a sandwich or it could impact your bread devouring experience).<br /><br />Some reviewers have complained about the shipping vs. product costs, but the seller explains that this is due to Amazon's policies rather than an inflated shipping costs (it used to be $9.99 with free shipping, now it's $3,99 plus $7.00, so the price remains the same).<br /><br />I really can't say enough good things about the product and seller. I have no doubt that if there's a problem with the product or the order, they'll take care of it and make it good. The customer service is really some of the best I've ever dealt with. These are good people.

review/summary: Be patient
review/text: Unless you are already familiar with working with sourdough and know what you are doing (which I didn't), you need to be very patient and experiment with this product.  I have now been working with the starter for about a month and I am still trying to get a loaf of sourdough bread similar to an 'artisian bread' from the market.  I have tried a variety of receipies; those provide and from the internet.  The sourdough flavor varies greatly with the receipe.  The flavor has developed and the starter become more active the longer I have worked with it.  This morning I found my overnight rise spilling over into the (cool) oven where I had it rising.  I had no idea how long it took to make a loaf of sourdough bread; almost 16 hour using the provided receipe.  It did produce an excellent batch of sourdough pancakes, but still a long process.  Keep trying!<br /><br />The product says free shipping, but for some reason I paid more for shipping ($4.49) than I did for the starter ($2.99).  The product arrived in a standard business envelope with about two ounces of dry starter.  I used about half (as per instructions) to create my starter.  The instructions are primative and poorly formatted for use in the kicthen.  The ad says you get a 12 page booklet, I got 3 - 8.5 X 11 single sided pages.  And the instructions do not provide an email address for the "free unlimited tech support."  I found the same basic bread receipe on epicurious.com which is much easier to read and follow.  You can also find receipies for starter on the internet.  However, I am hoping that this one will produce something more like the authentic San Franciso sourdough as advertised.<br /><br />So 3 Stars.  It would be 4 but for the shipping cost and instructions, and perhaps 5 when I figure out what I am doing.

review/text: I absolutely love dried mango and the Philippines definitely has the worlds best mangos. The only problem I had with dried mango is that it was always too difficult for my kids to eat so when I found these bite sized treats I was really happy. They love them and can easily eat them without any help other than opening the package. My only concern is that they are coated with sugar on the outside but it does keep them from being sticky which is another plus in my eyes and I still would much rather have my kids eating these with the extra sugar added than candy so it isn't a huge deal.

review/summary: Egg whites simplified
review/text: I recently started a diet where I could only eat the egg white, not the yolk because of the fat content. I make a fruit smoothie every morning using egg whites as my protein source. The powdered egg whites have simplified my mornings and saved me alot of time in the kitchen (anyone who has spent time seperating eggs knows what I'm talking about)...not to mention not having to worry about salmonella anymore. I also saved a boatload of money compared to buying the whole eggs. This is a fantastic product and well worth the cost.

I paid $13.99 for 57 egg white in a 8 oz can - Figure this out - This can has 301 egg whites.<br /><br />Also, Steel Cut Oats from Honeville Grain - a 70 oz can for $7.99 - You can't beat this price.<br /><br />Gloria

review/summary: A protein shake that tastes good
review/text: I have been weight training and trying to eat a higher protein diet.  I can no longer bear the sight of turkey, egg-white omelets or cottage cheese.  I dislike artificial sweeteners (mostly due to their taste) so I don't care for any pre-made shakes I have tried.  I turned to whey protein (bleck...maybe more experimentation will yield something better)and soy protein (bleck redux) but couldn't stand them.<br /><br />But I like this!  I wouldn't eat it plain (it's not THAT good), but the taste is easily coverable with yummy and healthy additives.  This morning I made a "shake" that was 1C OJ (Tropicana Grovestand), 1/4C (appx) pure pomegranate juice, 1/4C egg whites (22g protein), 1/4C (appx) plain non-fat yogurt, and one banana. I blended these together with a few ice cubes, and yum!  Even my kids love it!<br /><br />It probably has a lot of naturally occuring sugar from the fruits and yogurt, but I am happy with the content and nutrients, and I can drink it happily without forcing it down!<br /><br />I have tried the Honeyville dried fruits and been pretty happy with them as well (much better blueberries than for pancakes), so I will look forward to adding these for variety when I can't find good fresh fruit.

review/summary: This Product Contains Sodium Lauryl Sulfate
review/text: I purchased Honeyville Food Products' Powdered Egg Whites for many years directly from Honeyville Farms. During that time, the ingredient labels on the cans have always stated: "Ingredients: Powdered Egg Whites" and nothing else. I will say that I love this product. Even cooked in butter as scrambled eggs with just a little salt, it tastes like whole fresh eggs to me.  Definitely no offensive odor or taste.<br /><br />Eariler this week I was going to purchase another can when I happened to look at the ingredients listed on their Web site -- "Ingredients: Egg Whites, less than 0.1% sodium lauryl sulfate (added as a whipping aid)". This came as a great surprise to me, I thought they had started using SLS as an additive. I decided to do some research and couldn't find anything about SLS except that it is used in soaps, shampoos and toothpastes. Nowhere was there a mention of it being in food. I went so far as to question the FDA. Yesterday I wrote the following e-mail to the Director of E-Commerce of Honeyville Food Products, Inc. and received a reply today:<br /><br />"I have purchased your powdered egg whites for a number of years and have been extremely happy with them. I also purchase some of your other products that do not contain additives or preservatives...<br /><br />I am very unhappy to see that Sodium Lauryl Sulfate has been added (to your powdered egg whites). Although this additive is approved by the FDA, I see little use for it to be in an egg product. I realize SLS has been used for many years in soaps, shampoos and other products that are expected, by the general public, to foam. But, these are products that are used externally and then rinsed off. Even then, SLS is an irritant to some people. I also realize that the FDA requires SLS to be used in lesser amounts where foods are concerned, but when using a product daily as I do the powdered egg whites (for smoothies) I worry about the build-up over time.<br /><br />The only possibility I can see why this additive is being used is because of meringue. I made meringues numerous times with your egg whites and they have always come out high and beautiful -- there was never a need for SLS".<br /><br />Following is the reply I received today:<br /><br />"I'm sorry to hear that we've lost you as an Egg White customer.  Our Egg Whites have always had the small amount of Sodium Lauryl Sulfate as a whipping aid.  When Egg Whites are pasteurized they lose the whipping characteristics that fresh egg whites have.  I appreciate the feedback and will weigh it against that of the customers that need the Egg Whites to whip up.  Thanks and have a great day.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Chris Ondatje<br />Director of E-Commerce<br />Honeyville Food Products, Inc.<br />[...]<br />chriso@honeyvillegrain.com<br />(888) 810-3212 ext. 1001"<br /><br />Well, now I know why my meringues turned out so beautiful -- because of a surfactant used in what I thought was a simple and pure product. I don't want to vilify SLS, I'm just looking for honesty in marketing so I can make a choice.<br /><br />I gave this review only one star because I was not given that choice.

review/summary: Powdered Egg Whites
review/text: These egg whites work great and are economical.  I recently started a diet where I can only eat egg whites.  It seems such a waste to throw out the yolks, not to mention the mess of separating the eggs.  I use these mostly for baking and to add protein when cooking other foods.  Adding the powder has saved me a lot of time preparing the diet foods.  The powdered egg whites do have an "eggy" odor and have a slight aftertaste which is easily overcome by adding vanilla or other extracts when making protein shakes or other sweets.

review/summary: Good product.
review/text: I use this as an inexpensive alternative to GNC protein powders.  It is completely natural and almost 100% protein.  Low carb count.  Highly bioavailable protein.<br /><br />When mixed with only water it does have a strange aftertaste.  I use powdered Nestles that only has 2 carbs or so and it has definitely improved the taste and removed any aftertaste.<br /><br />Do not use a shaker bottle with this.  Shaking the egg whites will cause them to foam, ( since they want to increase in volume).  Use a whisk or fork.<br /><br />I have used this product for baking power-type bars and it has worked flawlessly.  I am confident that it would work with other dishes.  However, I am not sure if I would use it for meringues.  I haven't tested it, but it does seem to increase in volume rather quickly.  Maybe it could be used as a last resort for fresh egg whites.

review/text: I was in the process of purchasing these when I thought I'd look at the Honeyville website first. But then I noticed that on the company website that there is sodium lauryl sulfate in these eggs, which is not listed on the ingredients on Amazon. Please be aware of this since there are various concerns over the use of this ingredient in all sorts of products.<br /><br />UPDATE 11/16/11: SLS is not good for you and tastes like soap. I went with Del El Egg Whites from Amazon based on another reviewer. No SLS added.

review/summary: Different, Good but very different.
review/text: This was my first experience with powdered eggs.  I took this stuff on a two week camping trip to make omelets, & scrambled eggs.  One container will last you a really long time.  I probably only used 1/4 pound of this stuff at most over the two weeks.  First, I was surprised at how fast they solidified when added to heat.  I'm used to having a few minutes to add stuff & season my eggs while they're cooking.  No chance here.  Mix in whatever you want before adding to the heat.  After they're cooked, they're have a kind of rubbery texture.  I couldn't get any of the women to eat them.  I added sun-dried tomatoes (re-hydrated in olive oil), sharp white cheddar, and some italian blend spices to the mix, cooked it, and BAM!  I thought it was pretty good.  You will need a whisk to effectively mix this stuff.  I also noticed when I was mixing that the stuff tended to froth a great deal so I usually waited a few minutes after mixing for the froth to settle before trying to fry it.  I bet it'd be good for making meringue.

I use 2 T lowfat milk instead of water for making 1 egg equivalent and used it for making stir fry dishes.  Wonderful!  Also, used to make scrambled eggs with various vegetables such as asparagus.  Again, wonderful. Made  shirred eggs for ramen - tastes just like fresh eggs.  What a great product to have on hand and now I don't have to waste egg yolks.

review/text: I got a taste of Chorizo when I was in Spain many years ago, and spent the rest of my time here in the States trying to find it, explaining to folks that "No, this is MEXICAN chorizo, it is NOT the same!" This product arrived promptly, securely packaged. Like I said, it has been many years since I had chorizo in Zaragoza, so I can excuse it for not tasting exactly the same. Perhaps it is a regional thing. It tastes a little like pepperoni, but with enough of a bite to make me happy. I suspect that "my" chorizo is more of a blood sausage than what they call chorizo in Pamplona. Still, I like it.

review/summary: lock it away from yourself.
review/text: I was first introduced to La Tienda products through a slicing sampler I received at Christmas one year, and have since familiarized myself with several of their products (cheeses, sausages, fish). You really can't go wrong with their chorizos, this one is especially delicious. If it weren't for leaving the house each day to go to work, I'd finished this in a day. You'll want to hide this from your family and yourself.<br /><br />The only con I give is that it's not from Spain. It's not necessarily apparent on Amazon (aside from use of the word "style" in the titles), but La Tienda makes many of their cured meats in the US from Spanish recipes/methods. If this is a big deal to you, do your research on their products as they also have imported versions. If not, enjoy one of the most addictive chorizos you'll ever have the chance to eat. Also check out their Sobrasada style semi-soft chorizo, if you can find it.

review/summary: Works great in morning smoothies!
review/text: I bought a 16-ounce bag of Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed Meal a few months ago and have been using it ever since. I have heard that you shouldn't keep it that long once you open it, but I haven't noticed any problems. The bag says "keeps best refrigerated or frozen," and I keep it in the refrigerator. I add about a tablespoon of the flaxseed meal to a ~16-ounce smoothie I blend fresh every morning, and I love it for that purpose! It doesn't really add any flavor that I've noticed, but I do believe it makes my pumpkin smoothies taste more like pumpkin PIE smoothies (I guess the flaxseed meal taste and texture reminds me of a pie crust being crumbled into the mix). I used more flaxseed meal in my smoothies a few times when the bag tipped out more than I was expecting, and it just made the smoothie thicker than I intended (not a big deal). The blender I use is a cheap single-serve blender, so it doesn't grind the meal up very much more than the original product straight out of the bag, but the texture doesn't bother me. The texture is not a fine powder like flour, nor is it sand-like as with cornmeal...it's flaky. I do have to wash my cup out within a few hours of finishing my smoothie, or the meal flakes will stick to the sides and make handwashing difficult.<br />I have used it once as an egg substitute in a box cake recipe (for each egg, use 1 tablespoon flaxseed meal and 3 tablespoons of water; stir and let sit for about five minutes to get a bit gummy). Though the cake turned out okay, I'd probably not use it that way again. The cake density was a bit off, and my husband didn't like finding little flakes of flaxseed meal in his cake. He is fine with it in his smoothies, though.

review/text: These tasty chocolate coated wafers are a great way to get a chocolate fix without too many calories. Be warned however that if the weather is sunny and in the 70's or higher, you're likely to be disappointed when you open the box because the chocolate melts. You'll have three solid blocks instead of 18 wafers, even if you used next day delivery. Best to order this product when cloudy weather is forecast, and high temps will be in the 60's or less -- apparently those brown UPS trucks get pretty warm in the sun!
