review/summary: Terrible sweetener for your health
review/text: After finding out what Splenda is and contains I have made it clear to my family and friends to keep away from this product.<br /><br />"Splenda is not natural; it is a chlorinated artificial sweetener. There have been no long-term human studies on the safety of Splenda; however, issues have been raised about Splenda in a new study from Duke University."<br /><br />[&#8230;]<br /><br />"In animals examined for the study, Splenda reduced the amount of good bacteria in the intestines by 50 percent, increased the pH level in the intestines, contributed to increases in body weight and affected P-glycoprotein (P-gp) levels in such a way that crucial health-related drugs could be rejected.<br /><br />The P-gp effect could result in medications used in chemotherapy, AIDS treatment and treatments for heart conditions being shunted back into the intestines, rather than being absorbed by the body."<br /><br />[&#8230;]<br /><br />I would suggest anybody who seriously cares for his/her health to stay away from Splenda, and try Stevia or brown sugar if you must use a sweetener.

review/summary: Wonderful alternative to sugar
review/text: My husband uses this daily for his morning coffee.  He only needs two packets instead of about three to four spoons of sugar. He says it is much sweeter than sugar and does the job well.  This price is good about 20-30 cents cheaper than my local grocery and get delivered right to your door.  You can also sign up for automatic deliveries and save more money.  You can cancel it if you find you don't need it again that soon with no penalties.

review/text: With all of the health dangers associated with consuming sugar, I don't understand why we're not using Splenda with everything.  Really, if you haven't tried it, you should order a box.  I don't taste any difference between this stuff and regular sugar...and if you do, well, get over it!  This stuff is *much* better for you.  And you can cook with it, too, without sacrificing the sugar requirement of a particular recipe.

review/summary: Excellent Chocolate
review/text: I'm allergic to milk and my wife and I avoid sugar. Splenda wrecks my stomach. We're so glad to have a maltitol-sweetened alternative that isn't overdone to the point where it's like snacking on ExLax. Though we've tried most brands of sugar-free chocolate, we've come to love YC's offerings. Most chocolates are ridiculously sweet to the point where I can't stand them; these are just right. We buy the 8-pound box and store it in the fridge where we nibble on one or two per day for months. I'm sorry the other reviewer had such a negative experience. This is great tasting chocolate. We store it for long periods of time and are grateful to have something that suits our needs and tastes.

I contacted the seller and without questions or argument I was sent another order. I received the order well packed and cold in 2 days. Because I was stunned to see such customer service I contacted the seller once again to offer payment for the UPS cost, but the seller refused stating that their goal is total satisfaction and that I should not pay for the shipping. Just amazing service! I will recommend this seller to anyone and ask to support them. If there were more stars to give I would had given them the max.<br />I hope this review helps.<br />DF

The chocolate is perfectly dark without being bitter, the orange has an incredibly satisfying crunch and a slight (very slight) chewiness that makes the texture of the bar divine, and the flavor of orange and chocolate together are heavenly.<br /><br />If only they sold it in more places!

review/text: I am not usually a lover of dark chocolate, but when a friend gave me this chocolove premium dark (55%) orange peel as a gift, I fell in love with it. So for Valentine's I decided to buy a box and give my special friends a bar for a happy. Now they are all addicted. The orange peel gives it a special little tang and crunch at the end and I would recommend it to any chocolate lover. It was funny that each person said they could not hold out to make it last a whole day like I had challenged them to. It is just too good.

Yes, it has real sugar, but it is so delightful for the amount of sugar that it has.  A taste of heaven.  I buy the 70% cacao and I am hooked! Seductive bliss!  One more thing, if you are in to dark chocolate, the taste is quite smooth, not bitter as some darks go.

We order a couple cases each fall and keep them in the freezer till we need a new bar. This is not bitter chocolate and just 1/6 (3 small squares) of a bar is only 80 calories and satisfies our desires for dark chocolate.

review/summary: AWARD WINNING WATKINS CINNAMON
review/text: I recently went to our local (Del Mar) fair and purchased my first tin of this award winning product for the first time, and all I could say is, "WOW! This is what cinnamon should taste like." I took a very 'small' sample on my finger, and tasted it right from the can - it has a wonderful and naturally 'sweet' taste to it!<br /><br />Watkins uses only the finest cinnamon bark with the highest oil content and then processes it to a consistently fine powder. Their premium grade sweet 'korintje' cinnamon has an intense aroma and is MUCH MORE flavorful than the ceylon cinnamon (generally sold in supermarkets).<br /><br />This stuff is GREAT for baking desserts (i.e. cinnamon rolls, apple pies) and is a wonderful flavoring in gourmet or home cooked dishes, such as beef stews, chili's etc.<br /><br />WATKINS has enjoyed a stellar reputation (since 1868, when it first made it's debut), and for good cause:<br /><br />Watkins possibly has the finest cinnamon product sold on the open market, and worth every penny!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />PRODUCT DESCRIPTION<br />Watkins Cinnamon<br />Weight: 6 ounces<br />Shipping Weight: 9.6 ounces

review/summary: Try in a garbonzo bean soup! Excellent!
review/text: I got a recipie for Garbonzo Bean Soup from the TV-Cat Cora show.  It is Chicken Broth (4 cans), Garbonzo Beacn (2 cans), one half chopped and sauted onion, one crushed clove of garlic, some rosemary, and a bay leaf.  The other ingrediant was a chopped canned or bottled red roasted pepper (approx. 12 oz).  I use a 12 oz jar of Zergut Mild Ajvar (has peppers and eggplant) and it was out of this world! Not too spicy and my totally American Family loves it.  I also add some macaroni for a hearty meal.  Ralphs in Orange County, CA was carrying this product, but I can't find it any longer.  I will search Trader Joes and Middle Eastern stores, but if you find it - try it!  Not sure if I would like it as a cold spread or dip, but in the soup, it is an easy, fast, and impressive soup or meal!!!  Yummy!!!!

review/summary: Most unusual banana soda
review/text: I ordered this item with hesitation. My daughters both love everything to do with bananas so much i decided to order it for the new year. I was pleasantly surprised. The shipping was fast and the items were packed excellently! I ordered 3 bottles of banana and 3 of watermelon soda. My total shipping was just over $8 because of ordering a higher quantity of these sodas. They both tasted great! Very light on flavor, not overpowering or heavily fake, but very nice and lightly sweet. They were great! The items were so securely packed it would have taken a lot to damage them. I was very well pleased. AND THE BOTTLES!! These were the most unusual glass soda bottles I have ever seen. The top plastic piece comes off and reveals a plastic break off tool to use to open the bottle which is sealed by a glass bead. You push the tool onto the  bead and it pops inside the bottle and is securely kept inside the upper portion of the bottle. The experience of opening these sodas was as enjoyable as drinking them. I will purchase them again!!

review/summary: Tea lover says not quite 'strong flavoured' as it says
review/text: This is a nice smooth black tea with a decent cherry note.  I've had other cherry teas and the one that stands out is the Republic of Tea brands Bing Cherry from Harry and David. That brand is VERY flavorful and I like it best of all I've tried. That said, it is also far more expensive than this item.  They actually have cherry bits in the tea bag, which likely accounts for the higher cost.  Considering I don't like it THAT much better, this is an excellent option, especially considering about all I drink are teas.  This type flavor, along with black currant are smooth and fruity like I like em.  All in all, this is a good tea and a very good price for it at approximately $2 a per box.  I'll try and find other cherry teas that fit the bill but this'll certainly do until that happens, if it ever does. If you're more of a tea snob, I'd go the Republic of Tea route.

review/summary: Not bad for a budget sauce
review/text: I've never tried Rinaldi sauce but the description sounded good.  The ingredient list is simple and it doesn't contain high fructose corn syrup or thickeners, like many other cheap sauces.  The price was very low at about $2.50 per 45 ounce jar (almost twice as large as most jarred pasta sauces).<br /><br />The price is great, but this is one of those times where you get what you pay for.  The sauce is thin and doesn't have a lot of flavor.  Luckily, a hefty sprinkle of parmesan cheese helped doctor it up.  I think it would be very good with the addition of some fresh mushrooms, olives, etc.  I would probably add some good crushed tomatoes to give it more tomato flavor. So, it has potential as a starter base!  It just doesn't stand on it's own as well as I would have liked.  It's ok for a budget sauce, but I'm not sure I'll buy it again.

review/summary: Made our dog sick.
review/text: We switched to Nutro Lite Dry recently, and it had very negative effects on our Black Lab. The food itself was being digested, but approx 8 hours after eating she would vomit bile. This went on for about a week before we did a search online on reviews of the brand and found a lot of recent reports saying this same Nutro brand was causing other dogs to have the same symptoms. In some cases, people with 3 dogs, saw all 3 dogs start vomiting after changing to Nutro. When all was said and done, I tossed out the remaining Nutro and went back to her previous brand. She has not vomited since. This is obviously not the case with all dogs, but keep in mind you may want to test this brand by purchasing a small bag before purchasing something large. I'm just glad our dog didn't have permanent problems.

Their stools are always firm and easy to pick up.<br /><br />Whenever we've tried something else (yes, we used high quality food, switched gradually, and gave them time to adjust) that has not been the case.  It gets expensive to feed this food to two 75 pound dogs, so some day we'll probably try again to find a cheaper alternative.  But in the meantime, there is an obvious difference in the dogs digestive health, so I highly recommend Nutro Natural Choice Lite.

review/summary: The best most authentic grape soda ever!
review/text: I am a soda fan, trying sodas from all over the country. As far as grape sodas go, this one is the absolute best, hands down. I loved grape sodas as a kids, but find the few that are made nowadays to be over sweet, too syrupy, and the grape seems too fake. There is a reason for this, first is that most bootlers use more carbonation in sodas than they used too and it overwhelms the flavor. Second, the soda companies switched to high fructose corn syrup in the 1970's in order to save money, but the corn syrup makes it taste, well, syrupy. It weighs the flavor down into a mess. But there are some premium brands that use real cane sugar, just like the old days. That and a bit less carbonation, and you have a soda that tastes like they used to back when.<br />Boylan's grape really does has an oaky concord grape flavor, like real grape juice, and does not taste like artificial grape flavoring. That and the lighter carbonation make this the best grape soda I have tried in over 30 years.<br /><br />The company: Originally brewed in 1891, the New York classic "Boylan's Birch Beer" started in a apothecary in the early 1890's and developed into the most popular flavor of The Boylan Sodaworks. Boylan was a bottling and keg filling operation located in the heart of Paterson, NJ, the first industrialized city in the country. Competition increased however, and in the 1930's Boylan was forced to close its bottling lines, leaving Boylan's Draught Birch Beer as its only product. Shortly thereafter, the rights to the name, the formula, and the sole route was purchased by the driver. His grandkids the Fiorina's still run the company in New Jersey today, and have expanded again to near a dozen very delicious flavors. They recently changed packaging to the very good looking and nostalgic bottles with raised lettering and painted on labels. Look for my other soda reviews at Amazon.

review/summary: great grape soda
review/text: I'm a huge grape soda fan.  The problem is that so many grape sodas are too heavy on the sweet and not very "grapey".  After testing a few different brands, I settled on Welches grape for a decent, easy to find grape soda thats high in grape flavor and doesn't have that syrupy-sweet, bad aftertaste, and I had pretty much resigned myself to the probable fact that Welches was about as good a grape soda as I was likely to find.  Then I saw this stuff one day at my grocery store and gave it a try.  It has a strong, complex grape flavor.  It tastes like lightly carbonated grape-juice, not like most grape sodas.  It's not overly sweet and syrupy, and it has no artificial, chemical aftertaste (like Fanta has.)  It's really in it's own category.  It's a lot more expensive, and  normally I pick-up welches for my daily grape fix,  but for a great soda once in a while it's perfect.  Best I've ever had, really.  Definitely a "sipping" soda, not a "Chugging" one.  You'll want to enjoy this one for a long time.

review/summary: More corn than quinoa
review/text: So I am giving this two stars, mainly because this product/brand tries to trick you into thinking it is quinoa-based spaghetti, even though the first ingredient listed is corn flour. Having more corn than quinoa in spaghetti is not quinoa-based, it is corn-based, though they put 'QUINOA' in big letters on the package and 'corn-quinoa' blend in small letters. Having a bunch of corn in the product basically negates the health benefits of this product.

review/summary: delicious gluten free pasta
review/text: I was so delighted to learn that I didn't have to give up pasta when I was diagnosed as celiac.  The quinoa pasta is very tasty and has a nice bite to it.  It has a smaller window of peak perfection when cooking.  If cooked too long it does get mushy and I find it tends to stick together.  A quick cool water rinse helps.<br /><br />We had tried rice pasta first.  It is pretty slick and tends to slide off your spoon.  We liked the taste in Pad thai, but not with Italian sauces.

review/summary: Really great tasting, textured and good-for-you pasta
review/text: I am not sensitive to gluten and I'm thankful for that.  My granddaughter and my dear friend are so I wanted to experiment with gluten free foods.  I did NOT like any of the rice pastas one bit.  A few years back, I ordered Bob's Red Mill organic quinoa flour and made the muffins on the package - everyone raved and there was no other flours in them so my deduction is that it's a broader spectrum flour to use for many things rather than all the mixes you have to concoct to make something baked that's gluten free - and really not be able to tell the difference. I decided I'd order this pasta and see what it's like.  I absolutely love it to the point its the only pasta I buy. It's just healthier all around...period. I have a parrot who totally loves pasta and this is a much better food for him, too.  Whatever I'm eating he has to be eating, too - he even ate liver and onions!  When I give him this pasta, he doesn't come up for air and repeats 'goooood' the whole time he's pigging out.  He wouldn't eat the rice pastas. I buy the Bertolli pasta sauces in the little bags (amazing pasta sauces!) and one bag is perfect for one box of quinoa pasta.  It reheats very, very well, it's good cold, tho! It's easy to over-cook but once you get it down, you'll find it cooks a little quicker than wheat pasta. I do not add oil to the water but I use a cooking chopstick to keep it moving just until each strand of pasta is all separated and good and wet and I have no problem with it sticking together through the rest of the cooking process.  I use the water to moisten my dog's dry food - she loves it, too.<br /><br />It's so plainly bannered on the packaging and in the product description that it's corn and quinoa pasta.  I can't believe someone down-rated the product because they didn't read what they were buying!

review/summary: best non-gluten product
review/text: So glad I tried this.  Thanks to the first 2 reviewers, I had confidence and am not disappointed.  Product is firm, not mealy and more nutritious then processed wheat.  I wasn't able to have spaghetti for the longest time.  Addendum 12/4/09: you do have to pay attention while cooking this; this pasta is not forgiving in being over-cooked; I have found that adding olive oil to the water before adding pasta helps to lessen sticking, although cooking shows may dispute that this works for regular pasta.  I am still buying this product.

review/text: Ignore ANY negative reviews.  I've already had to give up bread, pastry, and just about everything else that tasted good when I gave up gluten.  This is HANDS DOWN the best gluten free pasta you can buy.  Even my wife and kids, only one of which also has a problem with gluten, likes this better than regular pasta.  It cooks like regular pasta and has better flavor than wheat products.  Yes, it has corn in it - so what?  It cooks easier and tastes better than the rice-based products.  If you can't eat gluten, this is your pasta and UDI's is your bread.

review/summary: Superior to rice
review/text: I love this spaghetti. I have been hoping to find a pasta that can hold up well and also tastes very close to my once deeply missed semolina pastas.<br />This one wins hands down! I can even use it broken up into soups and it retains it's texture. (doesn't get mushy) I agree that it takes longer to cook, but it's worth it! Since it cooks slowly, I find it a snap to catch the al dente point. I was using Tinkyada pastas and I still will for lasagna, fettucini etc.. but this spaghetti wins hands down for texture, taste, everything. I agree that it should be noted that it is made from mostly corn (which is non-gmo) with quinoa (organic) as it's 2nd ingredient for those with corn sentivities.<br />My only complaint is that 8 oz packaging is a bummer. Coming from a long line of Italian chefs.. We really love our pasta, so I have to cook 3-4 boxes per meal. That gets pricey.<br /><br />Try this brand!! If you are just ok with the rice pastas, but still missing your old pasta texture and flavor.. you'll truly appreciate this!<br />My family and I are thrilled to have found this!!!

review/summary: Noodle over this gluten-free winner!
review/text: When I went gluten-free to manage chronic pain, one of the biggest cravings I fought was for pasta.  I tried lots of gluten-free varieties including brown rice pasta, corn pasta, and quinoa pasta and Ancient Harvest Quinoa Pasta is a clear winner!  Cooks up perfectly al dente (as long as you time it--more below on that) and doesn't get mushy.  Flavor is closest to wheat-based or flour-based pastas and is mild enough to work with any type of italian or other sauce.  Firm enough to manage the biggest meatballs when tossing.  Bakes well for casseroles.  Keeps shape and flavor when refrigerated as a cold pasta dish.  I've tried all different forms and find them all to be consistently great!<br /><br />Downsides?  8 oz boxes is really only 2 servings and small servings at that.  Really need to follow timing suggestions.  I time it at 8 min boiling and then check often until al dente.

I<br />guess because I know there quinoa cereal is just quinoa.  So I have a stack<br />of food I can't eat.<br />Lots of people who look for quinoa are gluten intolerant.

review/summary: Good alternative to wheat pasta unless you're on a tight budget
review/text: This gets three stars from me because of the packet size vs value for money - it contains perhaps 2 (not-that-hungry female) portions and for the price I find that almost unacceptable.  Also, if you have been told you are gluten intolerant or have decided that gluten is not a healthy food choice and really miss spaghetti with your favourite sauce, then be prepared to have your taste buds challenged slightly.<br /><br />As with anything, it does take a little bit of getting used to and you do have to watch for the 8 - minute cooking time mark and then test often to catch the 'al dente' stage, or the pasta will become claggy/sticky.  The texture is good although you will of course notice the difference between this and regular spaghetti.  I found this product retained heat for longer than standard pasta, which was a nice surprise.<br /><br />Due to the cost, I have decided to use this product for light lunches rather than cook a lot of the packet for a decent-sized dinner, and rendering the amount left for another serving unbalanced, i.e not enough for a portion. Complaints aside, this is the best alternative to wheat pasta that I have tried so far in terms of taste and texture and performance at "holding" a sauce.  Due to the price of this product, I will only be repurchasing a few times a year but I do recommend it if you're not worried about blowing your budget.

review/summary: Very healthy
review/text: IN RE to complaint below:  There is corn flour in the product because it is impossible to form a pasta noodle from quinoa alone--because quinoa lacks the starch to hold the particles together.  At least one reviewer is confusing corn flour with corn fructose syrup i would imagine.  There is no particular health threat from consuming some corn or corn flour.  Corn flour is used as a substitute binder for wheat flour--which contains gluten.  If you are wheat, celiac or IBS, or gluten sensitive, or diabetic--this product can really improve the quality of your life.<br /><br />If you are a diabetic -- you still need to watch your portion (of this pasta) carefully.  We find 2 oz (dry) pasta to be about the max serving reasonable.<br /><br />Eating Quinoa regularly can be very beneficial.  We eat quinoa daily now.  We generally eat whole grain (not flour) quinoa--we usually mix 1/2 white, 1/4 red, 1/4 black (washed 3 times whether it comes prewashed or not, then cooked in ample water (13 min for the mixture--less for all white) and drained rather than the measured portion of water many recipes cite.  We buy 10 pound bags or red and black through Amazon and 25 pound bags of white from Bob's red mill--freeze surplus).  This pasta adds a little variety to our lives and we find that it is delicious.<br /><br />It requires a little gentleness when cooked but is a rather easy meal. Add a little olive oil, bring water to boil, stir in pasta, turn down heat to simmer 10 minutes and then longer until tender.

(Using pasta water incorporates some of the liquid and primarily the starches that boil off of the pasta into the sauce you are making).  We love this pasta and eat it at least once a week, if not more.  This is my preferred brand of gluten-free pasta.

review/text: I've tried several wheat free/ gluten free pastas, and this is my absolute favorite.  I think the main problem with wheat free-pastas is their texture.  This comes out al dente every time!  I've also noticed that the water (after cooking) is less starchy than the brown-rice pasta that we use sometimes.  Aside from the spaghetti, we've also tried the veggie curls--another favorite by this brand.  With this type of pasta--especially the spaghetti--I recommend stirring it frequently during cooking or the pasta might come out stuck together.

review/text: After being diagnosed with a gluten intolerance in October, my first concern was finding a good replacement for pasta, which my husband and I both love. Even though I found one that was really good, it still had a taste and consistency different that regular pasta.  But after seeing all the positive reviews, I thought I'd try this brand and can't believe how close it comes to the real thing. Delicious!  Even my husband says not to bother cooking him regular pasta anymore...this is so good, he'll just eat this with me.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it only comes in an 8-oz box. For us, it's fine since there's only two of us but my son and grandson also need to eat gluten-free and they try to cook that way for their family of six. They would have to use three boxes to cook up enough.  But the taste is so worth it!

review/summary: Healthy is delicious!
review/text: As we try to gently move to healthier choices, I have NEVER been able to sell my children on whole grain pasta. On an impulse I picked this up at the Whole Foods last week -- and they devoured it. They even like it better than regular white flour pasta! I can make an inexpensive, nutritious meal my children will actually eat? Awesomeness squared.

review/summary: Great Taste... but Advise CAUTION
review/text: I love the taste and texture of this pasta (as long as you pay attention to cooking instructions mentioned in the other reviews).<br />HOWEVER, I always experience joint pain after eating it. I can eat quinoa with no problems, so my problem must be with the corn. Since my reaction is no where near as severe as with wheat, I do eat this on occasion.<br /><br />So, my "caution" is that you listen to YOUR body, and if you notice any unpleasant effects, just don't eat this very often.<br /><br />btw... if you are testing yourself for gluten sensitivity, it's best to go off ALL grains for at least a month (really, it won't kill you!).  Then, add some of the less offensive ones, such as quinoa, back into your diet, one at a time. Note how you feel the next day.  Then, use common sense, and don't eat the ones that cause you pain or discomfort.

review/summary: Great gluten free pasta!
review/text: After trying a white rice pasta, I thought I'd have to swear off eating pasta, as it was terrible.  It is difficult to find a wheat free pasta locally, so I thought I'd read the reviews on Amazon for the different pastas. After seeing so many positive reviews, I thought I'd give this one a try. I'm glad that I did!<br />I agree with the other reviews that like this pasta. It has a great texture, much like the "regular" wheat pasta. It also has a pleasant taste. I don't think it especially tastes like corn or quinoa, but has a flavor very similar to the popular wheat pasta. I think this may be a product that I order regularly in the future.
