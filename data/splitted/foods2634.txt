I got in touch with amazon, they said no return'S, that I had ordered the case of #4's I did not, I have absolutely no use for #4 filters. They finally agreed to credit me with $30.00 they would not give me a full refund, they would not send me the #2 filters which I ordered and they would not let me send these filters back. I am satisfied with the #2 filters I got, I am not satisfied with Amazon's return policy, and realize thaT this is why buying over the internet is a dicey proposition.<br />  A very unsatisfied customer

review/summary: This stuff is wonderful
review/text: I can't recall exactly what flavors go into the Jamaican Me Crazy coffee, but it is absolutely wonderful.  It's one of my favorite pod flavors, and I order it regularly.  I use a single pod with the single cup setting because I like my coffee good and strong.  Add a single packet of Splenda, and I'm good to go.  A delicious calorie-free treat for the morning to get my day started on the right foot!

review/summary: NOT natural - ingredient list NOT accurate
review/text: I was very excited to find a natural beef jerky without any wheat in the ingredient list!  HOWEVER, once we actually got it and read the (very long) ingredient list, we were very disappointed.<br /><br />Here's what the manufacturer listed as ingredients:<br />Ingredients:<br />Beef, Lite Salt (Salt, Potassium Chloride), Chilies, Brown Sugar, Sugar, Black Pepper, Garlic, Citric Acid and Cornstarch.<br /><br />Here's the actual ingredient list from the Hoppin' Hickory flavor:<br />Ingredients:<br />Beef, water, corn syrup, sugar, salt, soy sauce powder (naturally fermented soy beans, wheat, salt, maltodextrin), worcestershire sauce powder, corn syrup solids, salt, caramel color, garlic powder, sugar, spices, soy sauce solids, naturally fermented wheat and soybeans, salt, maltodextrin, caramel color), palm oil, tamarind, natural flavor, citric acid, garlic powder, onion powder, spice.<br /><br />Not the worst ist in the world, but since we have wheat allergies, we can't actually eat the product.  We're also trying to avoid corn syrup.  I realize it takes a while to type out all of the lable ingredient lists, but since these are non-returnable items and will be ingested, it is the manufacurers responisbility to inform customers accurately regarding what is actually in the product.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned that a product had sucralose in it...some folks get very sick from these ingredients.  It's my responsibility to read the package and double check prior to actually eating someting (which I did) - but it's disappointing, expensive, and a hassle to get something other than what I've ordered.<br /><br />My appreciation to Amazon for refunding my purchase because of the inaccurate info on the web site.

review/summary: Keep shopping, I implore you
review/text: If you're looking for a beef jerky you can (and will) feed your dog, look no further. With no discernable taste and a texture that resembles <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H4T6">Beggin' Strips</a> at twice the price, Wild Ride Gallopin' Pepper Beef Jerky for Dogs is an all-natural choice.<br /><br />The meat is weirdly soft and completely tasteless. Not salty, nor peppery, nor meaty. I took one bite and immediately spit it in the trash. And 5 out of 5 friends agree: It's garbage. To add insult to injury, one of the bags was ripped down the middle. So it was *actually* garbage.<br /><br />These bags of "beef jerky" have utterly offended me. Heed my warning and stay away.

review/text: I was really upset about the flavor of this product.  I bought two cases, spent more than $40 and the only person in my house who will eat it is the dog.  I had higher expectations for both the texture and the overall flavor- we bought hot and spicy and BBQ varieties; despite the added flavoring, it was pretty bland.  The texture was practically dusty- not chewy as I like my jerky.

review/summary: Excellent beef jerkey
review/text: This is excellent beef jerky. The taste is wonderful - I really get a great pure meat taste when I eat it. It's softer and more moist than most beef jerkys. It's hormone & antibiotic free which is fantastic. After eating this kind why would I eat other beef jerky that has hormones & antibiotics in it? Also the sodium level is less than other jerkys which is also a huge plus. And I'm trying to eat more protein cause I work out a lot and this really helps with that because it's loaded with protein. I can't wait to try the other flavors.

review/text: Got these when they were a Today's Deal. Jerky isn't something I normally purchase but if I did I'd get these. Much more tasty and tender than the ultra-chewy stuff I remember. Bits of jerked beef are small - largest about 1" x 1" - and a lot of crumb size bits too. Quality seemed good - no odd bits in 4 packs I've gone through and consistent otherwise for taste and texture. For me I'd gave it 4 stars with just -1 for the regular cost of the smallish 4oz bag which would keep me from buying again.

review/summary: Just awful...
review/text: This is my first Amazon review, it was that bad that I needed to let people know... First off, I love beef jerky, but this is just not how it's meant to be eaten.  Unnaturally soft with very little beef flavor, no hickory or smoke, and gristle throughout.  It's now been relegated to dog treat status.  Not sure what the other reviewers here have been eating, but I cannot discourage you enough from buying this style.  To be fair, I haven't tried any of the other Wild Ride flavors or styles, so keep this in mind just for the Hoppin Hickory flavor.

review/text: My whole family loves beef jerky and we go through a lot. I was looking for a less-sweet jerky with natural ingredients, but this is NOT IT. It's full of corn syrup, and salt is not the second ingredient, as indicated on the list of ingredients on Amazon. Furthermore, this jerky has a bizarre mealy/soft texture and tastes overridingly of flavoring agents, rather than beef. Hands-down the worst jerky we've tried; none of us like it.

review/summary: Jerky
review/text: I had high hopes for this jerky since it was on sale and I had been craving jerky.  When I received it, I opened one bag and it smelled like Beggin Strips, the dog treat.  I still ate a bite and it was very soft and mealy.  I tried another bag and they were all that way.  Not chewy, no multiple flavors or meaty.  It instantly turned mealy and then kind of dissolves.  I started giving it to our dogs, they loved it, then my parents came over and my dad saw it on the counter.  He tried some and loved it.  eww.  He has dentures and said it was just the kind of jerky he was looking for.  SO.... IF you have dentures and want a beef jerky to try, maybe this one is for you!

review/summary: Dry, Tasteless Jerky...
review/text: Beef Jerky has always been one of my favorite snacking foods.  I even used to make my own when I was younger.  I've tried a variety of brands before but this is the first time trying out Wild Ride.  It claims to be Hormone and Nitrate free with no added MSG, and while the ingredients listed do confirm their claims this beef jerky has got to be some of the driest, tasteless I have ever eaten.<br /><br />Kickin' Teriyaki is the flavor I got.  To be sure I didn't just get a bad package I opened two bags and both sets of jerky was dry and tasteless.  I do not taste anything "kickin" about this jerky and there is virtually no Teriyaki flavor either.  To make things worse the dry jerky tends to have a powdery taste to it because it is made with Soy Sauce POWDER instead of Soy Sauce (this is to get around saying it has no added MSG).  Instead of imparting a nice Teriyaki flavor you get this powedery taste to the jerky and mixed with the bit of onion and corn starch in the jerky, it almost is like they coated it with onion powder instead of Teriyaki.<br /><br />On the plus side however, this is a nitrate free product which is a good thing as many other jerkies tend to have Sodium Nitrate in them.  Also with both packages I have opened currently, the jerky breaks down easily and isn't tough as leather nor does it contain any sinew it seems.<br /><br />OVERALL this jerky just seems extremely tasteless and powdery.  While it doesn't contain "added" MSG, Nitrates or hormones, they got around this by using powdered versions of ingredients (powdered vinegar and soy sauce) plus it contains Dextrose and Fructose , modified food starch and corn starch and SUGAR is your second ingredient.  I've never seen so much sugar and starch added to jerky in my life.  So despite being hormone and nitrate free, this jerky (in my opinion) is barely palatable and should be avoided

review/summary: beware of label
review/text: I bought the Hoppin' Hickory.  I would have never bought this if I'd known it had sucralose in it.  This particular webpage says the product has cornstarch but no where did it mention sucralose.  Somebody needs to make a close-up picture of the packaging with the correct list of ingredients.  The flavor was not as sweet as I am accustomed too but it was still pleasant tasting and definitely has a nice little spicey kick, however it is extremely tender so if you want something really chewy that you can chew on for awhile, I would get something else.  This stuff almost melts in your mouth - it's so tender.  Just wish it was a little sweeter.  So this is a suggestion to the Wild Ride Jerky folks - consider using "stevia" because it is a natural sweetener - please don't use the artificial sucralose.  You are all about natural since you don't use nitrites or MSG and no antibiotics or hormones but then you ruin it by adding sucralose (an artificial sweetener)!

review/text: I love this stuff! Wild Ride Kickin' Teriyaki (Hormone & Antibiotic Free) has NO nitrites and NO MSG. It is made with natural ingredients, which is about as healthy as you can get while still eating beef. It is also low in calories. An entire 4-ounce bag is only 200 calories, or 50 calories per serving, high in protein and low in fat. I'm watching my weight, and Wild Ride is a welcome addition to my balanced diet.<br /><br />Essentially, it is sliced steak in a bag. An average piece is bite-size, about one inch square and about 1/8 inch thick. Keep in mind that Wild Ride is definitely NOT shoe-leather-tough like most jerky products, thus traditional beef jerky lovers may be put off by the tender quality of the meat. If you're looking for tough meat with the consistency of a radial tire, then buy something else. But if you want beef jerky that is chewy, tender, and flavorful, get this product.<br /><br />I have only one complaint; about 1 in 5 bags have a few pieces containing gristle or sinew (the pieces don't break down completely when you chew them). While this is an inconvenience, the problem is still minor enough for me to give the product five stars based on overall taste and quality.<br /><br />Kickin' Teriyaki is slightly sweet (like Teriyaki sauce) and not too salty. It is one of my favorite flavors. MMmmmm! Yummy!

review/summary: Rishi Pu-Erh Tu Cha is better
review/text: I am a Pu-Erh Tu Cha addict!  When Amazon stopped carrying the Rishi brand, I ordered this.  It isn't the same!  This is a loose leaf tea.  For some reason there are a lot of stems/twigs in the mix.  Last I checked I was looking for full leaf!  If you can get it, do try the Rishi brand.  The Tu Cha is a bowl tea & it is individually wrapped in little bowl shapes inside a canister.  What I do like about the Serendipitea brand is the packaging.  Inside the cardboard box is a lined paper bag that you can re-close by folding it over & closing the side tabs.  Very environmentally friendly!<br /><br />Pu-Erh is a very intense full bodied tea.  It brews black.  Yes, I know it's black tea...but Pu-Erh brews black like coffee.  It is black & potent!  It tastes fantastic with honey or sugar and half & half.  It is intense, no one would think that was tea in your mug! You are supposed to be able to brew it several times.  I have tried this, but I like the super duper intensity & only use it for one brew...This is the type of tea you probably either love or hate.  I don't think there is an in between.<br /><br />Because of my Pu-Erh addiction, I gave this 4 stars even though I prefer Rishi.  Pu-Erh Tu Cha is my favorite tea!  Oh & it is reported that it is supposed to help with digestion esp. after a fatty/heavy meal.  I've also heard that it is supposed to help with weight loss.  I don't really care about any of that, I just want to drink it 'till I'm silly!

review/summary: Evaporated Cane Juice is the way to go!
review/text: Evaporated Cane Juice is better for you than sugar. And this can be substituted for sugar 1:1. However much sugar you use, use the same amount of this.<br /><br />As for the price, keep in mind that you can go to Trader Joe's any day of the week and buy a 2 lb bag of this for $2.99. If you were to buy this same amount of Florida Crystals Natural Sugar (evaporated cane juice) in Trader Joe's, you'd spend a total of $17.94.<br /><br />So unless the price on Amazon dips below $17.94 or you don't have Trader Joe's in your area or you need to add this to your order to reduce shipping because you don't have Prime, then you're probably spending a little more than you need to.

review/summary: the candy of all ages
review/text: I was amazed that I found out these have been around for over 150 years, kinda makes you realize these will probably be around forever then. I use to eat these as a kid and still do on occasion. The assorted flavors are interesting and honestly, I don't think even after 10 years in storage the taste would be any different. If you havn't tried them yet you should and if you had them but not in a while, try them again.

review/text: I used to eat these all the time as a kid, and even into my 20's.  There is only one flavor that I don't really care for, but I can still eat a whole package of these without even thinking about it.  It's hard to believe they've been around for so long.

review/summary: New Flavors
review/text: Neccos disappeared so gradually from retail stores that it was a while before I realized they were truly gone, and I'd have to buy them over the Internet.  What a shame--I still have an occasional craving for them and just have to have them!<br /><br />My favorites were the old lavender (clove) ones.  Where else can you get clove flavored candy? When I received my order, I thought they had discontinued that flavor, since I saw only white, pink, pale grey, yellow, brown, and orange.  It turns out that the new, reformulated lavenders are so pale in color that they are almost indistiguishable from white, even in bright light.  They taste much the same, though--yum!<br /><br />Chocolate, the most popular flavor, is noticably different now.  It has a stronger chocolate taste, and I think it's an improvement, but if you loved the original, you may be disappointed that the taste has changed.<br /><br />Green (lime) has been discontinued--a shame, since it was my second favorite.<br /><br />Yellow (lemon) and orange (orange) both have a stronger, more realistic citrus flavors, and again, are different, but perhaps better.<br /><br />Pink and white, both mint flavors, tasted the same as ever to me.<br /><br />Black (liquorice) is now a very pale grey, and still tastes about the same.<br /><br />Overall, the colors have gotten much paler (except for brown), some of the flavors have gotten stronger, but I'm just grateful to get my clove fix.  I hope the new Neccos stick around!

Just don't buy them anywhere that is selling them for over a buck if you have a dollar tree store around. They carry them at ours and for only a buck a piece you just can't beat it.

review/summary: Great alternative to Red Bull
review/text: If you are tired of spending $3-$4 for a can of Red Bull, this is a good alternative. The low carb version has a scant 20 calories per can (it says 10 calories, but its 2 servings per can, and who drinks half a can?). The only downside is that you can't find this as a good deal on the internet. At my local grocery store I pick them up for $1 a piece, and the internet sales for them is usually double that. The taste is on par with any other energy drink out there in my opinion making it the best value out there I have found.

review/summary: Easily my favorite tasting energy drink - but it's worth shopping around for the best price
review/text: I've tried several different kinds of energy drink - and can't stand the taste of most of them.  This one I really like.  It's a bit fruity (mango and pear and apple and peach) and doesn't have the bitter aftertaste of so many others.  It's sweetened with Sucralose, and packs just 20 calories, plus several standard energy ingredients (taurine, ginseng, caffeine, guarana extract, etc.)<br /><br />It's a bit pricey here on Amazon - every vendor I've seen offers it for over two bucks a can when I can find it at my local gas station for about a buck and a half.

review/summary: Good Cat Food Without Smelly Cans
review/text: What self-respecting cat isn't a picky eater?  I've never met any.  My cat likes Whiskas Choice Cut foods mainly for the gravy, and sometimes for the meat.  Omar the Magnificent and Wonderful likes both  the Beef in Gravy or Tuna.  Truth be told his dry crunchie is really his go-to choice, but he's that way with all prepared moist foods.  If you ask him his true five-star preference is meat caught fresh in  the garden.  Let's skip the details, you don't want to know.... Let's just say that Omar (M&W) is on the job!<br /><br />I personally prefer Whiskas foods in pouches because Omar is OK with allowing any remaining food to be left in pouch when stored in fridge, rather than having to transfer it from a can to a glass container.  (Come on you all have cats that expect you to do this!)  Pouches are easy to dispose of too.  Just rinse and trash.  You aren't messing with storing smelling cans and trips to the recycling center.

However, when they arrived the out side of the box label was turkey in gravy but they contained mixed grill instead. I could not return but Amazon gave me a total refund. If you are ordering this, wait about 10 days (after 9/1/12)so you don't receive Mixed Grill like I did. It was labeled wrong from the factory so it will take them a while to get new shippments.

review/summary: My cats go crazy!
review/text: Both my cats love Whiskas in any flavor.  My female cat, Sophie, is usually the one that takes little bits until it is gone.  When she hears me tearing the Whiskas Pouches, she flys into the kitchen and waits patiently for her food.  She never lifts her head up from the bowl until every piece is gone.  She will then sit by her brother, Samson, to get more food if he leaves.  After he gulps his food down and see's his Sissy waiting for some of his, he will tease her by taking one piece of his food out with his paw, look at her and when she trys to take it away he puts his paw on it and scoops it into his mouth. i can always count on empty bowls when I buy Whiskas.  The price at Amazon is more reasonable than the grocery store.

One pouch doesn't go far so it is more of a treat than a meal (unless you feed according to recommendations on box).<br /><br />Pouches are easy to open and a little messy, always seems to get on my fingers.<br /><br />My cats come running if they see me reach for the pouch or they hear the sound of flicking it back and forth before opening.<br /><br />All the yucky stuff (think fast food for cats) must be addicting because they seem to listen for the very quiet sound of the rustling pouch.

review/summary: Tasty food for a picky cat
review/text: Our beloved Bengal kitty, Isabel, is 13 years old and suffering from kidney stones, which are inoperable in felines. For years she lived on dry food but began to shun it as her health declined. Our vet ultimately advised feeding her whatever she'd eat: "She might as well be as happy as possible in her declining years."<br /><br />So, we offered her one soft food after another. She turned up her nose at the expensive, vet-sold brands and repeatedly rejected one national brand and flavor after another. Finally, to her gustatory delight (and our great relief), she made her choice: this particular Wiskas version is the ONLY kind she'll eat day in and day out. It MUST be Whiskas with the turkey AND GIBLETS in GRAVY. The gravy seems to add a certain flavor and texture she can't resist.<br /><br />We surmise that, like humans, our pets have food preferences linked to palate-pleasing aroma and taste. This Whiskas is the one that rings the bell for our Izzy. No, it's not the best choice for managing kidney stones, but she's got to eat. (So you won't worry that we're ignoring her renal problems, she's on daily medication and is doing quite well.)<br /><br />It's not an inexpensive cat food, but its packaging is very convenient and space-saving. The Amazon auto-ship program is a life saver. The cartons always arrive on time, and the per-package bulk rate is lower than the price of small quanities. Also, our local Target was the only place we could find this exact variety, and now the store no longer carries it. (Remember, our cat demands GIBLETS and GRAVY and accepts no substitutes).<br /><br />Give autoship a try. The price is better, and you can easily adjust the quantity and frequency of shipment or cancel altogether.

This food doesn't have that catfood smell that most canned foods have.

review/summary: Perfect product, acceptable price
review/text: Make no mistake... Giving your dog raw foods, or dehydrated foods + rehydration, will beat all options. It is not really feasible for most people's lives and, even if it is feasible, its not easy to do at EVERY treat time as well as meal time. The Zero/G line from Darford is the next best option. This includes their treats and food. My dogs LOVE these shrimp/trout treats being reviewed. At 30 calories per treat its perfect for an active adult dog and easily breaks in half for smaller dogs with less caloric requirement and, of course, for lazy dogs.<br /><br />This product probably should not be sub-named "With Trout and Shrimp". The first ingredient in this specific formula, mysis shrimp, is not a 'meal' and is not dry when measured. This means that after the 80% of water is taken out of the shrimp its true content would appear waaaay down the list of ingredients, possibly in the lower 25% of ingredients. The fourth ingredient, herring meal, is a legitimate measurement and gives this product most of its meat protein. The other meat included, trout, is not a meal nor dehydrated and is too far down the list to really even exist in the product. These treats would be more accurately sub-named "With Herring", but I guess that isn't as appealing.<br /><br />I would guess 45% of the protein in this treat is actually from meat, the rest from other ingredients especially peas.<br /><br />A huge advantage of these treats, and the Zero/G food, is the low glycemic effect on dogs. Peas and buckwheat (which is a fruit, not a grain), and the other related ingredients in the product, have very little blood/sugar effect. So stop giving your dogs potatoes which will spike their glucose levels then cause them to come crashing down.<br /><br />Givin the price, these treats are a diamond in the rough!

review/summary: Love these natural marshmallows!
review/text: These marshmallows are really tasty and don't have all the artificial junk that normal marshmallows do.  They do taste very slightly different than regular marshmallows, but I actually think I prefer these.  They work great for S'mores.  They weren't great for making rice krispie treats, though - they hardened up too much and I had rice krispie rocks (although heating them up in the microwave for 15 seconds or so worked wonders - and I just used a regular rice krispie treats recipe, so I might just need to find a recipe specifically for natural marshmallows).  Overall, a great product!

review/summary: Arrived Melted
review/text: When the product arrived it had obviously melted enough to fuse together and re-cooled.  This gave, I felt, a very grainy texture that wasn't unpleasant but wasn't right.  I understand they are supposed to have a slightly different texture from "normal" marshmallows but I felt the temperature change exaggerated that difference.  It also meant I had to pick the marshmallows apart to use them.  When trying to convince people they were just as good as un-kosher marshmallows was not the time for this to happen.

review/summary: Nice Scent, Gritty Texture
review/text: I'll start off by saying that I don't care that these are Kosher.  I bought them because I could get marshmallows in bulk for a gift idea. That said, I'll start with the good.  These marshmallows are longer and skinnier than store-bought.  They have a very pleasant vanilla scent to them as well.  Holding them, they are nice and squishable and if you need to rip them into bits, they're not as gooey-sticky as store bought.<br /><br />As for the bad, I tried these out plain and in hot cocoa.  Raw, they taste and feel like puffy sugar. When half melted in my drink, the sugar crystals really took over and I felt like I was eating sugary grit.  Kids might like this, but if you're expecting a soft, light marshmallow fluff sensation in your drink, either make your own or stick with store-bought.  Because of this, I probably would not buy these again and I most likely will not use these for my gifts.<br /><br />Extra information: Yes, these marshmallows state they are pork free, but to get the gelatin they needed, fish products were used instead.

review/summary: Miss Callard & Bowser? Not Any More!
review/text: I don't remember when Callard & Bowser toffees disappeared from the candy & gum displays at my local stores. But I remember being addicted to those chocolate toffees wrapped in wax paper and stacked in a roll. Some form of nostalgia got me searching for them, and somehow I was directed to try Walkers Traditional Chocolate Toffees.<br /><br />If you like the taste of chocolate and enjoy a chewy candy, these are simply perfect. Seemingly impervious to weather, sweet and rich, you don't need to eat a ton of them to feel like you have had a satisfying little treat. The ones I tried came in a bag of maybe a dozen or so (I didn't count; sorry) and went a little too fast. I'll definitely be re-ordering them to have as a little gift to myself.

review/summary: Ingredient list isn't correct
review/text: I was making a vegan "mocha decadence" cake for my bf and I needed a bunch of chocolate covered coffee beans for the recipe. I had a hard time finding them, it seemed like everywhere I found them, from World Market to Trader Joes, they contained milk and/or butter or some other dairy product. Finally I ended up ordering some with all vegan ingredients from nutsonline, and I should have used those but I messed up and left them at my boyfriend's house with no way to get them before I made the cake and only two days to find some new ones. So, I really needed to find something on Amazon and take advantage of Amazon Prime two day shipping.<br /><br />I was really excited to find these Crackheads, even though they do contain white chocolate coated beans as well as the dark chocolate, and even though I would rather have had a half or whole pound of beans all in one bag and not packed in individual small boxes. I figured I'd just pick out the white chocolate ones if I had enough, or otherwise just try the recipe with both.<br /><br />When the Crackheads arrived in the mail, I was really disappointed because I read the ingredients and what it says here on the website doesn't match what is on the box and these are not, in fact, vegan.<br /><br />Here is the actual ingredient list...<br /><br />Dark Chocolate (sugar, chocolate liquor (processed with potassium carbonate), cocoa butter, butter oil, lecithin (an emulsifier), pure vanilla), white chocolate (sugar, cocoa butter, nonfat milk, cream, natural flavor, soy lecithin (emulsifier), pure vanilla), fresh whole bean coffee, sugar, corn syrup, tapioca dextrin, confectioner's glaze.

review/summary: A good pasta substitute for dieters
review/text: For me, Shirataki noodles was never about amazing taste or unbelievable texture. It's basically a pasta look alike that has only 40 calories in the pack. And those 40 cals totally fill you up. For a dieter, this is really a great find.<br /><br />Yes, it comes in a really stinky fluid (which washes off). Yes, it's much more expensive than regular pasta. Yes, the texture is slightly off. But, this is probably as close as you can get to eating guilt free pasta.<br /><br />I've been using these packs on the Dukan Diet (lost 20 lbs so far!) and Shirataki is a lifesaver. Not perfect...but definitely hits the spot when you crave pasta.

review/summary: unedible
review/text: i read a lot about this product before going to the store to buy it. the low calories and low carbs really sold me, but it tastes so horrible! it was very slimy, and it was soft but still a little hard. i guess its hard to describe. it in no way resembles pasta. other reviewers complain about the smell when you open it up, but since i was cooking other stuff too i didnt notice any smell, all i could smell was the other stuff that i was cooking. i rinsed it thoroughly for about 3-4 mins. i read online that the best way to prepare it was in a skillet until you hear it pop, which is exactly what i did. i even added some low carb pesto sauce to it. the taste was fine, but the texture is something that i couldnt get over. i took two bites and threw it out. if you arent bothered by the texture of your food then this might be a good alternative to pasta for you, but for me...never again.<br /><br />on a side note, the "pasta" is supposed to be kept cold since it is tofu and all. i am not sure how this would be possible if it was delivered to your door. i dont think amazon delivers these items in a refrigerated truck, and even if they did then it would be sitting on your front porch if you werent home. best bet is to go to the supermarket and get it in the produce department (thats where i found it). try it before you stock up

review/text: Our local movie theaters sell these pretzels, they are so good that I get one every time I go to the movies.  I could not find them in any stores, so a quick Yahoo search led me to Amazon.  I ordered 1 box of pretzels and received in less than one week (quicker than I expected).  However, there were only 9 pretzels in the box, instead of 12 (these are large pretzels, much larger than the frozen varieties available at the grocery stores).  I emailed A&M Marketing with my concern.  Customer service responded within one day with an apology and said that 6 more pretzels were on their way.  I received these within 3 days of my email.<br /><br />Shipping was much less than the $12 listed on Amazon.  For less than $30, one dozen of these pretzels is a very good value.  I will definitely be ordering more in the future!

This deal was just too good to pass up. These boxes are huge. We ordered three and go through about once a month- with the whole family. Each box has 60 packs. I'm sure for most families one box would last the entire winter.<br /><br />Each box is filled full of packets. There is a flap that opens from the box which makes for easy, convenient, and organized access to the packs inside. The packages don't seem to have as many marshmellows as the smaller boxes, but we didn't really mind. The hot chocolate was yummy- as always. We swear by Swiss Miss in this household.<br /><br />This box would be great for:<br />Large Families<br />Camping Trips<br />Ice Fishing Ventures<br />Winter Travel<br />Waiting Rooms<br />Offices & Lunchrooms<br />Even small Bed and Breakfasts, Lodges, and Nursing Homes

review/text: This pasta is so good. I found it in a local grocery store. I love the lemon pepper flavor best but the other two are good too. (garlic and egg noodle I think) This is great for making fettucini alfredo and shrimp scampi.

review/summary: Subtle Chamomile Tea
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers. It is rather weak, but a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little weak and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful for me, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker or less annoying.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****

review/summary: Flavored Commercial Tea
review/text: ***<br />Stash's Lemon Ginger Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is a basic lemon ginger tea, tasting strongly of ginger, full of flavorings, and oddly, even contains soy. This is one of the better commercial highly processed, non-organic teas. I much prefer organic teas that are made without artificial flavorings and certainly without soy, but if you are not picky about herb teas, and are looking something very strongly flavored as an introduction to the world of teasans and decaffeinated beverages, this would be fine. If you like your tea more subtle, with true pure tastes, and can discern complex differences between natural and commercial teas, then this definitely is not for you, and I would recommend any Numi tea, Yogi Tea, Traditional Medicinals, or even Stash's organic line of teas (which comes in a wonderful Lemon Ginger Organic Tea!)<br /><br />Stash Lemon Ginger Tea contains ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, citric acid, and soy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, nothing special.<br />***

review/summary: Hibiscus and Raspberry--Lovely!
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, and that's great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/text: There is something right about this tea. I don't like drinking green tea, only black. But adding green tea to black brought some pleasant sensations to the mix. I love drinking this tea in the morning...

review/summary: Lemon Ginger Tea with a Zing
review/text: I can't drink caffeine after 2PM so I rely on herbal teas for comfort drinks in the afternoon and evening.  But every once in awhile I want a cuppa that has a bit of zing to it.  This tea is how I get it. [ASIN:B003D4IUUW Stash Premium Lemon Ginger Herbal Tea, Tea Bags, 30-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)]] - great flavor and an absolutely fabulous price.  And it's delivered to me...I don't have to go try to find it in the local store.

review/text: Wow, this Mango Passionfruit tea is the best herbal teas I have tasted. It is good hot or cold sweetened with a little Agave. We often have it in the late afternoon when we want to limit caffeine. It is a very refreshing beverage.

review/summary: The Best Earl Grey Bagged Tea I have Had
review/text: This tea is flavorful and delicious and became an instant favorite from the first time I have tried it. Stash Earl Grey started me into experiencing tea beyond iced and typical restaurant fare. Today I have 20 varieties of teas, both in bags and loose and Stash Earl Grey is still one of my favorites to this day. (The flavor for Stash Earl Grey loose tea is different from the bagged. The bagged is better IMO.)<br /><br />Some other flavors and brands you might like if you like Stash Earl Grey.<br /><br />Stash Vanilla Nut Decaf. A perfect desert or night time tea.  Sweetened and with milk, it is divine.<br />http://www.amazon.com/Stash-Premium-Vanilla-Tea-30-Count/dp/B003D4GSAQ/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1335572191&sr=8-6<br /><br />Teavan Mate Vanna<br />[...]

review/summary: Great tea
review/text: This combination of green and white tea from Stash is just right.  I don't like but can tolerate the taste of plain green tea.  The trick here is that the white tea as a nice sweetness to that green-tea taste with no sugar!  It's perfect as an after-lunch pick-me-up and as simple as boiling water, just the right amount of caffeine.  The teabags are foil-sealed, so they stay fresh a long time.  I buy in quantity to save money.  Can't go wrong with this choice.

review/summary: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea
review/text: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile.  I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you like chamomile tea, this is a good choice.
