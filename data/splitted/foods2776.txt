review/summary: great stuff
review/text: my first and only visit to the islands I was introduced to this coffee in a local walmart and i found it to be mild and gentle yet still have an amazing hazelnut coffee flavor that almost does not require any creamer to be a delicious and palatable morning treat.  i have not found a coffee like this since returning to the states, tho many other brands advertise as being "kona hazelnut."  i believe you would not be disappointed if you tried this coffee.

review/summary: Not pure Kona and way overpriced
review/text: I had pure kona a few years ago and how amazingly good that experience was still haunts me.  Kona is incredibly expensive so I don't make a habit of buying it but this morning I woke up craving it and figured, I'd splurge and buy a nice huge bag at Trader Joe's (which goes for around $20/bag).  Unfortunately, TJ's was out of it so I went to the supermarket next door and this is what I found instead.  I saw that it was a blend but I thought it would still retain the potent taste of kona.  Excited to try this, I made a cup as soon as I got home and was very disappointed. I've had generic coffee beans that taste better than this.  I could have gotten them for half the price.<br /><br />Next time I'm sticking to pure kona beans even if it is a little pricier.  Don't expect much from this if you're craving true Hawaiian Kona coffee.

review/summary: False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!
review/text: I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs." Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for,  I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.

review/summary: A great food for our dogs
review/text: I have been feeding Fromm Four Star Beef Frittata for the last month to my bichons and chihuahua.<br />The ingredients are healthful, no byproducts, grains or artificial anything. It's a family run company with its own production mill and has never had a recall, which is reassuring in today's day and age with all the recalls and sick pets!<br /><br />The kibble size is quite small, which is great for my 4 pound Chihuahua.  The other dogs don't seem to mind the kibble size at all.<br /><br />Coats are looking beautiful. I have one super sensitive bichon whose skin has stayed in good shape on this food, thankfully.  She gets yeast infections on her skin (ears, toes, face/muzzle) that can make her quite miserable.  Fromm has kept her in great shape!<br /><br />Back yard clean-up is good.  Initially when I switched the girls to Fromm, they had a little gas but once acclimated have not been gassy at all.<br /><br />Great food!  Transitioning/rotating to the Game Bird recipe now and will report on that too!

review/summary: The best quality grain-free dog food available!
review/text: I have been feeding my Puggle and Pug Fromm grain-free dog food for three months and it has really improved their coats.  Shedding has dramatically decreased to that of a 'normal' dog. (Pugs are notorious shedders.)  Their coats are now so shiny and soft!  I don't get a big cloud of dog hair from petting them anymore.  I haven't had to use the Furminator in . . . 6 weeks, and I may not need it anymore at all.  Their coats are beautifull and glossy and hardly shed now.  Before Fromm, there was always a ton of hair on my dark leather sofa and I just realized that there is hardly a hair on it now!  Wow!<br />My dogs LOVE Fromm and gobble it down.  We only feed our dogs Fromm dry food and use it for training treats -- they love it that much. (Okay, we also give our dogs natural chews like Bully Sticks, Pizzle Sticks, and dried cow esophagus, but they are all natural, too.  No grains, no sugar, no coloring.)<br />I like that it has a natural ingredient in it that reduces feces odor --- and it REALLY works!  If they get an 'outside' treat (all we feed them is Fromm, and use it for treats) I can always tell by the horrible (regular/bad) smell of their feces the next day.  When they don't get any unathorized treats, the smell is greatly reduced.<br />Also, Fromm doesn't have any fillers, it's a 'rich' dog food, in that you probably won't need to feed your dog the same amount that you were feeding them if you were using a dog food filled with corn and other fillers.  The good thing about that is that you get LESS poop.  (And that's always a good thing!)  My dogs generally poop 2-3 times a day and it is well formed and not overly malodorous.<br />Go slow in transitioning your dog over from regular (corny) dry food, because Fromm is a very rich diet.  Check the back of the bag for how much you should feed your dog and also calculate in treats or you will wind up with weight gain.<br />Fromm has never had a dog food recall.  That's awesome!  They are very careful about their ingredients.<br />I truly believe that spending my money wisely on such a high quality, grain-free dog food like Fromm Beef Frittata will provide my dogs with a long healthy life and that they will be less likely to have diseases or cancer.  I can already see a great difference in their coats.<br />I don't feed my family 'Frankenfoods' like corn syrup, sugar, 'flavorings', by-products and grains, and I wouldn't feed my dogs any of that either.  I believe I'm making an investmentin my dog's health by feeding them Fromm brand. Four paws up for Fromm!

review/summary: delicious but hello sticker shock
review/text: This relish is delicious - we use it on sandwiches and wraps, with fish and couscous, with mashed potatoes and more. the cumin/cilantro powder flavor is kinda noticeable (i'm not a fan of cumin), but overall a great sweet and medium spicy relish, with a nice texture - not too firm, not mushy, not too "seedy" (as in with seeds, and not the other meaning of seedy, haha).<br />Also, there is a little extra oil in there, just for preservation purposes I imagine, but we tend to spoon out the excess oil before mixing the contents of the jar, and then store it in the fridge.<br />All that being said, the one concern I have here - this is about 2-3 times the price of this item in grocery stores. At even the most expensive grocery stores in town (and I'm in a pricey area), I can get this bottle for 3.99 to 4.19. So I'd say it pays to check your local store first.

review/summary: This is the stuff you're looking for!
review/text: I was a little leery of purchasing masarepa at such a comparatively low price. Plus, the product picture was a little sketchy looking. But I live in a town without a decent Latin market, so my options were limited to what Amazon can provide. And, since I'm both cheap and adventurous, I figure I'd take one for the team and find out what this low priced masarepa was like and review it for the rest of you!<br /><br />Well! Imagine my delight when I opened the box and found those lovely, familiar yellow P.A.N. packages staring up at me!<br /><br />I am assuming this masarepa is such a good deal because the expiration date is November, 2011. If your family eats arepas and pupusas with as much frequency as mine, you should have no problem polishing off 6 bags of this stuff in the next 4-5 months. I don't imagine the quality will really suffer much even after the expiry has been reached.<br /><br />At $2.40 per bag, this is a screamin' deal for the best brand of masa harina on the market! Buy it! You won't be disappointed!

Still, a very nice cup of coffee.<br /><br />At this point, I think I've tried about 10 different types of K-Cups, and I think I'm liking Timothy's Kona and the Mocha Java the best.  However, the Italian Blend is a nice cup of coffee.

review/summary: OK, but there are better choices
review/text: I have been exploring the range of k-cups looking for my favorites. While the Timothy's Italian Roast isn't bad, there are better options.<br /><br />I like my coffee starbucks style: bold, strong, with lots of character. As a point of reference, my current faves are Coffee People Black Tiger, Tullys French Roast and Italian Roast, Emeril's French Roast, and Coffee People Sumatra and Dark Magic. I tried the Timothy's version of the Italian roast expecting a similar flavor to others I have tried in the bold varieties, and I found it to be on the weak side. It does have some of the nice smokey elements that you expect from an Italian roast... but Tullys does it better if you are looking for full flavor.<br /><br />If you prefer a medium bodied roast with some punch you will be happy with this, but it wasn't for me.

Tastes great black and stands up perfectly to flavored creamers without being overwhelmed by them.<br /><br />Italian Blend will now be the regular coffee in our home. I completely recommend it.

review/summary: From Flavorful Favorite to Weak Disappointment
review/text: I would have given this a 5-star review in the past but my last shipment (October 2010) was extremely weak and didn't taste anything like it used to.  The k-cups didn't seem to have very much coffee in them.  They seemed very light when shaken as compared with the past.  I would also like to note that I have noticed this same problem on quite a few of the k-cups.  Also, they all taste very similar and not a good taste.  I had read that Green Mountain may have taken over some of the k-cup business for Timothy's, Caribou, etc. and maybe they have changed something.  For now, I will buy from BBB when they have a coupon and I can check the freshness code on the package.<br /><br />But, really I have gone back to using a french press which really doesn't take that long to make and has superior flavor.

I drink my coffee black which usually allows me to taste the coffee fully without diluting it with cream or sweetening it with sugar. This coffee was not too weak and not too strong to the point it was bitter. It will definitely remind you of an Italian cafe.

review/text: When I purchased my Keurig coffeemaker I had no idea what coffee to buy.  Especially since there is such a huge selection of coffees to choose from. The saleslady suggested the Timothy's Italian Blend based on what kind and what flavor that I told her I liked. Plus, she really liked it, too. I'm from Louisiana and was a little hesitant to buy it.  Italian coffee.........for a southerner??  Well, I'm so glad I did! This is the smoothest, best tasting coffee I've ever had! No bitterness, just a great cup of coffee!! I even converted my husband over to it. He drank only one brand, one kind of coffee for a number of years. Now, he loves it and won't drink anything else!! I keep it on hand at all times. Try it, you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: What's with Amazon's prices?
review/text: I last bought this in May 2011, for around $26.  I used to get it for around $17 on Subscribe and Save, before Amazon ended that option.  I had to stop buying all my k-cups from amazon, because the big warehouse club has an 80-pack of Donut House and Caribou blend varieties for $33.  I first thought it was just the coffee product that amazon was having pricing issues with, but their prices seem to be inflating across the board, while their competitors are not reflecting the same sort of steep increases.  I've found myself going to v*t*c*st.com for many of the repetitive grocery items that I used to order through amazon.  The main difference I can see is that amazon's competitors don't have to worry about pleasing Wall Street, so their prices are kept more honest.<br /><br />Italian Blend coffee is a decent mild coffee, my wife's favorite.  We'll keep ordering it, but it won't be from amazon.

review/text: Have only had the Keurig for about 2 months.  The Timothy's Italian blend was in one of the sample packs.  One cup, and I was hooked.  Usually bold & extra bold are deliciously strong but also have a bite to them that ruins the taste of the coffee for me.  It tastes like the brewed coffee was burned.  The Italian blend has the perfect combo of strength & fullness, without the bite.  It is sooo smooth.  I know that everyone has their own taste in coffee, but to my mind this is "kewl beans" (don't know what that means, but heard it somewhere and it sounds right, lol)  Absolutely delicious.

Unfortunately, with this brand, I get about 1 blow-out per 30-35 k-kups.  I have never experienced this amount of blow-outs with other brands (in fact, only a single one in about 500).  I would recommend gently squeezing before inserting in to brewer to verify a tight seal on the top.

review/text: We tried several different varieties of Timothy's and other K-Cup providers (Green Mountain comes to mind, but I know there were others also) and found the Italian Blend by Timothy's to be an all-around very drinkable blend, and as a result also practical to order through subscribe&save.  When using multiple blends it was not practical to manage each subscription because of lower volume, but having been able to settle on one favorite the additional subscribe and save discount, and the ease of managing just one subscription makes this a winner.  Also, it is admittedly a fairly small sample size but the number of cups that are duds (i.e. when brewing either grounds end up in the mug, or the mug does not brew completely) has been much smaller with the italian blend than with other Timothy's or other manufacturers products.

It's the kind of coffee you could drink every morning and be just fine with . I personally like my coffee on the stronger side and wouldn't mind a little flavor so I was looking forward to getting my second shippment in so I could try some different kinds. Right now I am loving the Tree Hugger's Organic blend. It's got just the kick I was looking for!

review/text: This is the best k-cup I have found so far.  I have tried them all...  If you are new and looking for the perfect cup of coffee, buy this one.  The best price I have found so far however, is at Bed, Bath & Beyond (using your 20% off coupon = 44 cents a cup or $7.99 for 18 k-cups).

review/summary: Great coffee - HORRIBLE PRICE~
review/text: This is great coffee but I cannot believe this company has jumped in to sell it at twice the price Amazon was selling it for a month ago.  Amazon needs to get it back in stock and get the price back down into the realm of sanity!<br /><br />I love the smell and taste of Starbucks Espresso Roast in the latte's we make at home and work, which is why I decided to try the Italian blend, and it is by far my favorite.  It smells like a good morning cup should smell, then tastes just as good.  Most of the others have too much coffee in the k-cup for me and come on much too strong.  This one makes a perfect large cup of coffee.  I still buy others because my husband likes to explore but, in the morning, this is my coffee.

review/text: I enjoy a rich, robust cup of coffee, this coffee fits the ticket if you like the same.  AFter reading the reviews, I decdied to try it.  It seemed to be priced well in comparison to other Italian Roasts out there. I will say though that it must be packed full of caffene.  I can only drink one cup of this stuff, it gets me pretty wound up.

review/summary: A very good cup of coffee
review/text: I have tried several of the Timothy's coffee's as part of the initial variety pack which came with the Keurig brewer.  I tend to use the 10oz brew and add a bit of creamer or flavored creamer to my cup of coffee, but I always try to taste the coffee itself before doctoring it to my taste.  This was a very good cup, I prefer a medium to dark coffee, and usually drink a moderately strong french roast at work.  This was the best of the non flavored coffees, Timothy's or otherwise which I have tried so far (coffee people french roast is a 3 star, Newman's extra Bold and Timothy's Nicaragua extra bold are both very good but a little strong for my taste)  If you like a medium coffee that is smooth and flavors nicely with a creamer give this one a try.

And what a great surprise that I can purchase this coffee through the subscribe & save program on Amazon!

review/text: I am a fan of other Timothy K Cups, but not this one. I tried it based on the reviews, but unfortunately it is not that strong. Of course it's a matter of taste. I prefer the darker blends, but if you are someone who prefers a "not so strong" coffee than I guess you would enjoy it. Don't get me wrong, it does not taste bad, just too weak for my preference.

review/text: Realizing that these reviews are very subjective and it is hard to judge taste... these are my favorite K-cups so far and I have tried many. They are not too dark and not too weak, but with a great sweet and nutty flavor and are very consistent. If typical breakfast blends and the like are just too weak for you and the super-double dark ones are too bitter, give these a try, I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />For a "taste preference" reference point, I am also a big fan of Kona and Kona blends.

review/summary: Cat exploded everywhere
review/text: I offered my siamese cat these treats and he would not eat them.  I placed them in his food bowl and the next morning I awoke to exploded vomit all over the place.  I have also had this kind of bad reaction with freeze dried venison from Whole Life.  I guess freeze dried meats are a no no for my cat.  He does however LOVE the freeze dried shrimp from PureBites.  I have had no problems what so ever from the shrimp.  PureBites makes great treats with no additives and are made in the USA.<br /><br />I ended up giving the beef liver to my friend's dog and he loves them.  No dog explosion there.

review/summary: Like it
review/text: I was really glad to find a treat that is actually just meat (without grains or additives), since my cat has a sensitive stomach.<br /><br />We have tried Turkey, Chicken, and Beef Liver.<br /><br />My cat LOVES them except the Beef Liver - they will sit out for several hours before he eats them (if he eats them at all). After a couple tries, I ended up getting rid of those. They must be really bad - I've never seen him reject any food in the past.<br /><br />He seems to really like the Chicken, but some of the weight in the bag is "chicken dust"..so the only way to really feed it to him is to sprinkle it over his food once all the actual treats have been eaten.<br /><br />Overall, I think it's a good product.<br />The price is great, and he gets pretty excited whenever we go near where they're kept.

review/summary: The 11th Commandment: Thou shalt eat matzo
review/text: Moses or not, matzos are good. And these are the best, with the perfect amount of salt. Better than any other brand of matzo I have tried, and *much* better than unsalted, even Streit's.<br /><br />Try it with a slice of sharp cheddar. Mmmm. Wonderful texture, just burnt around the edges, and a crunch that is pleasing both orally and aurally.<br /><br />I would happily buy them here if the shipping charge were not so ridiculous. Safeway sells the same 11-ounce box for between four and five dollars, so purchasing the 12-pack (Streits, Matzo Lightly Salted, 11-Ounce (12 Pack)) barely breaks even (i.e., the exorbitant shipping cost eclipses the per-unit savings, plus I might be concerned about possible damage during shipment). Hopefully Amazon starts selling these directly (and with Free Shipping)!<br /><br />Somewhat relevant trivia:<br /><br />The original Streit's factory on the Lower East Side (148-154 Rivington Street) was put up for sale in early 2008, but with the economy about to crumble, nothing was finalized. The company already has operations in New Jersey, so in any case it will remain a family-owned, U.S. business.<br /><br />Much less relevant trivia:<br /><br />Rivington Street (specifically, the corner of Rivington and Ludlow) was used on the cover of the Beastie Boys' album "Paul's Boutique":<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002UUN">Paul's Boutique</a>
