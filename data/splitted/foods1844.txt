review/summary: Great tasting and healthy
review/text: I first purchased one of these brownies at Seven Eleven and I was instantly hooked.  Although they don't taste exactly like a normal brownie, and are DELICIOUS, and when you look at the nutritional label you will be surprised.  I use them as a snack prior to hitting the gym,  and as a dessert after dinner.  I would also try the peanut butter flavor,  they are great as well.

Product looks natural but still uniform in shape and designed with an adequate amount of greenery, and the price was fantastic.  Very happy I took a chance and ordered this product....love the result!

review/text: I'm not a mustard type person but this particular mustard sauce was on clearance at my local supermarket. An elderly man talked me into buying a jar and stated how he didn't know what he was going to do if the store truly wasn't going to sell it anymore. So I took my jar with me on vacation to share with my daughter and her family. Well not only was it a hit, we are all hooked on this sauce. Problem now was that I could not find it anywhere locally. Thank goodness Amazon not only had a supplier, this supplier was cheaper than other seller on different websites.  I can't wait to see my daughter's face when as a "funny" xmas present she opens up to find 6 jars of it. I'm sure it won't last long as this sauce is so good one can eat it by the spoonful...and sometimes I do...lol.

They are not for you if you are looking for a flaky Ritz-type cracker.  The cheese flavor is also delish, but we do not care for the multigrain which have a very strong herb flavor.

review/summary: price per cup FYI
review/text: This is a great product and resembles what most Americans know of as Russian Tea, (Tang, Tea, Cinn., etc...) *I am rating the product here w/5 stars and not the price.<br />This is a very nice flavor but the price here is a little expensive compared to most that I have found. Here it comes out to $0.726 or 73 cents. I usually play the game with Bed Bath and Beyond with there 20% coupons and I can come out to 51 cents per cup on most all ($9.99 + 8% tax - 20% coupon for 18 pack)teas and coffees. For this product seller to be competitive with them this 2 pack needs to be sold and delivered as $24.48. Even if you don't use a coupon at BB&B you pay 60 cents tax incl per cup. Which would make the competitive price $28.77 delivered. It is my favorite tea but it is priced between 7 to 11 dollars to high. I drink 4 to 6 per day and if I just figured 4 per day for 1 month I would be spending at about 90 dollars per month just in tea. So my average is about 61 dollars per month now with BB&B and would be 85 dollars buying it here and in 1 year that would be 288 dollars extra.

It's one of my top 3 herb teas, and is very refreshing.  Orange spice describes it perfectly.  Lovely hot or iced.  The k-cup makes a perfect brew.  Wonderful late at night because it's caffeine free.

That extra 15 minutes of cooking time is rough for my busy life!<br /><br />With the $13.80 shipping for a single bag, this ends up not being cheaper in the end, I've just resorted to buying truRoots by the case from the local store, the 10% case discount there ends up the better deal.<br /><br />I was really impressed by this company though, they sent free samples of other grains, and the other organic and sprouted grains they have in their catalog are impressive. I just wish they didn't have such high shipping charges.

review/text: My husband converted to drinking tea about 6-7 years ago and has been quite particular in what he chooses to purchase.  He used to buy the Lipton Black Tea with Honey and Lemon and it was no longer available.  Finding a substitute that would be equally satisfying became quite problematic.  He tried a box of Twinnings Irish Breakfast tea and added his own honey.  He found it to be better than anything he could imagine.  While it is not my first choice, I certainly put it in second place on my list, as I like English Breakfast tea.  Nonetheless, this has a great flavor and warms the spot when looking for something special to drink.  I highly recommend it!

review/text: I was so glad to have discovered this tea when my mom was visiting last year.  She buys tea from the Gevalia coffee company which is very good but is very expensive, especially with the shipping, so just for the heck of it we bought a couple of small boxes to try out to see if we could come up with a cheaper alternative for her.  One of them was the Twinings Irish Breakfast and I was amazed at the flavor.  We in my family were all brought up on Lipton but I abandoned hot tea years ago for coffee.  BUT now this tea is giving my morning cup of coffee competition!  Since then I have also tried the English Breakfast but don't think the flavor is as rich.

review/text: I've been a Tea Drinker for over 40 years because I can't drink coffee.  I drink it strong, with Milk and no sugar.  I can't start a day without it.  I always liked the Irish and (the more widely available) English Breakfast Teas from Twinings, but could never justify the price over the Lipton and Tetley (British Blend) mass produced teas.  Recently I have become slightly allergic to most teas.  I am particularly allergic to Lipton regular bags and Twinings English Breakfast Tea.  I am not sure what those bags have that Irish breakfast Tea doesn't have, but perhaps they are different varieties, or processed differently?  I've been truly enjoying Irish Breakfast tea from Twinings for the past 3 months with no issues.  Thankfully, this is (and always has been) my favorite tasting tea.  Who says you can't have your cake and eat it too?  This six box pack from Amazon, makes it easy for me to keep at least 1 box at home and 1 at work.

review/text: When I discovered I liked Twinings English Breakfast tea, I decided I would try Irish Breakfast tea. While it is not the strongest tea I have ever had it is certainly robust! I love the taste of coffee but gave it up a few years ago because it had too much caffeine, but there are times when you need something to help wake you up or keep you awake. This tea does the job.<br /><br />The first few times I tried Irish Breakfast tea I had to add milk, but I am used to it now and drink it black. I cannot drink this tea within a few hours of bedtime or I will not sleep, but it is a wonderful full-bodied tea that isn't bitter if you don't steep it too long. If you are searching for an alternative to coffee (or simply want a stronger tea) Twinings Irish Breakfast tea is a good place to start.

review/text: This tea is the perfect wake-up beverage when I stumble out of bed.  It really does give you that much-needed "oomph" to start out with.  I recently weaned myself from coffee and a friend suggested Twinings.  I bought the sampler package and settled on two favorites; Irish Breakfast in the mornings and Lady Grey in the afternoon.  It is rather strong though, depending on how long you let it steep.  I would suggest the minimum the first time just to get an idea of the flavor; at first I used a little half-and-half and a dallop of honey, but now I prefer it straight-up, just because I don't have that kind of time.

As a matter of fact, I would call it the tea lovers coffee. It's strong and robust and it is best taken in the morning. It will wake you right up! I drank this tea straight for awhile--no sugar, no milk, just tea--but then I discovered that adding a dash of milk or creamer makes it really quite delectable. I especially like adding the creamer/milk with the tea bag and then I pour the boiling water over. That way it mixes itself very nicely. This is a great tea and I will most definitely be purchasing more!

review/text: If you're looking to stop drinking coffee but still need the morning wake-up, this tea is for you!  Other reviews have stated that it's very strong and needs to be watered down with milk but I disagree.  This tea is perfect straight or with sugar and lemon added.  I don't find it to be strong but after drinking plain black coffee for years I'm sure anything would taste weaker.  I very much recommend this as a great morning tea.

review/summary: Drink it RAW!
review/text: I've been a strong black coffee drinker for 20 plus years, but had to quit drinking it due to problems with kidney stones. And I love my coffee! I looked for a substitute tea and couldn't find a really good one until I tried Irish Breakfast Tea by Twinings. I have to say, this is a blend with a hearty "kick-you-in-the-teeth" welcome that truly does live up to its namesake. Exactly what I wanted in the morning for that "Off you go!" attitude to start my day.<br /><br />My grocer quit stocking it, so I looked on-line and found it here, and for much less than what I was paying. One thing to note, if you do run low before the replacement stock arrives is to save the used tea bag and let it hang until completely dry. Amazingly it will make a second cup, naturally not as strong however, still pretty good in a pinch.<br /><br />Don't know about mixing stuff in it to tame the wild beast flavor. But, if you love your coffee black and thick, try this tea "raw"...this is the "MAD MAX" of teas.

review/text: Excellent tea and I would recommend it to anyone that has not tried it but that loves tea.  I drink it with just a teaspoon of sugar, no milk, and it gets my day started the right way.<br /><br />The big problem with this product is that the price is like a yo-yo bouncing all over the place.  I finally stopped my subscription because of the price jumps and due to the fact that the product is currently much cheaper at Walmart and Target.  The current Amazon price is $2.83 while I can buy it at the above mentioned places for $2.39 a box.  Sure it is only 44 cents but when you drink as much as I do, this price difference is like buying 5 and getting one free at the local shops.

review/summary: One of the most robust teas that I've had
review/text: I'm purely a tea drinker, I don't like coffee at all. Twinings teas make up about half of the teas that I drink. I love to get my "wake up" jolt in the morning with a big cup of Irish Breakfast Tea. It's one of the most robust and flavorful teas that I've drunk. Twinings rates it as four tea leaves on their 1-5 scale, but in my opinion, it could be a 5. I usually drink it straight with a few drops of lemon juice, but occasionally, when I add a little milk and honey, the flavor still comes through.<br /><br />I've tried other brands of Irish Breakfast Tea, with mixed results, but I always come back to Twinings' version.

review/summary: Not only in the Emerald Isle ....
review/text: TWININGS IRISH BREAKFAST TEA is the epitomy of strong black tea. It is the strongest, most robust that Twinings sells, and believe me, it will make you sing during and after breakfast.<br /><br />Not only then - I drink this almost all the time but one thing I decry is Twinings' secretiveness about the blend. It may be Assam and Lord knows what; all the box says is "expertly blended black teas".<br /><br />There's a marvelous experience I've had with this particular tea, and just as I never tire of telling it, those around me never tire of rolling their eyes and pointing imaginary guns at my head when I tell it.<br /><br />But it's true.<br /><br />Once upon a time I had moved, and left behind an almost full box of Irish breakfast at the house. Upon moving back in, I'd been gone over 6 years - and the first thing I chanced upon as I went through the place was my long-forgotten tea. Not believing my eyes, I naturally brewed up some. There's always time and need for tea!<br /><br />It tasted better than anything I have ever tasted. While I have never tried to duplicate this trick - if a 'trick' it was - it is testimony to the powerful, unmatched quality Twinings brings to your tea caddy and your tea time. As for expanding my palette, I wouldn't change from Twinings for all the tea in China.<br /><br />This wonderful absolute favorite of mine is also available in decaf: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4J74G">Twinings Irish Breakfast Decaf Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.<br /><br />In the event it interests you, Twinings tea bags are designed like Lipton's clever invention, the 'double' tea bag (what they originally named "FLOW-THROUGH") that you can puff apart a bit if you like before steeping it. Twinings does not have any staples anywhere on their teabags, unlike other companies with a staple here and a staple there. You might as well buy staple-flavored tea.<br /><br />Get Twinings, and live like royalty.

review/summary: rich, mellow flavor
review/text: This is one of my favorite black teas already in a bag. It has a deep, dark color, and a rich, strong flavor; yet still mellow. This tea can handle steeping for a while without getting bitter like some bag teas.<br /><br />My sense of taste is very strong, so usually I only steep the tea for a minute or two before it starts to taste bitter to me. This one can steep for longer without having to worry about bitterness so much. Don't get me wrong, if left to sit for too long, or too high a temperature, it will get bitter on you, but so will most any off the shelf tea.<br /><br />To me, this tea embodies what a black tea should be. Strong, dark, aromatic, and robust. A very pleasant drinking experience. I usually put cream in my tea, and a bit of raw sugar or molasses. Both compliment this tea very well.

I prefer it with milk and sugar, but it's also good with lemon and sugar (for Americans, at least). It's very handy to buy it in the six-pack version from Amazon, and just a note for you Tassimo owners: it's quite easy to use a tea bag with the blank disc. I usually press the button twice to get a full cup of tea and let it brew however long I like. Highly recommended.

review/summary: One of my favorites
review/text: I live outside Atlanta and tend to drink hot tea only in the winter. This delightfully strong tea was once my favorite. I drink my tea instead of coffee in the winter with only half and half. However, now its my third favorite. I had to buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4F952">Twinings English Breakfast Tea, Tea Bags, 50-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> once because my grocer was out of this tea. I found I preferred the English tea, its strong too but a little smoother. The Irish tea, to me, has a slight metallic taste. But I still enjoy it. Then my wife picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG5IXW">Bigelow Vanilla Chai Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and WOW, that is now my favorite. But, try this tea, its strong and has a great flavor. But don't be afraid to try other teas by quality tea companies like Bigelow and Twinings.

review/summary: Coffee, tea, or... I'll take the tea.
review/text: My wife and I have a new baby and have been shift-sleeping, so a cup of something caffeinated has become even more urgent when I get up at 3:30 in the morning to take over baby supervision.<br /><br />I used to pretty much solely get my caffeine from Diet Pepsi, but my older son is starting to notice Daddy drinking soda at breakfast, and in general, I thought it better for me to stop drinking 2+ liters of soda a day.<br /><br />I got a sampler of Twinings teas a while back and finally broke it open, brewing the teas for at least 5 minutes and then adding sugar and milk.  Since my sister is currently living in Ireland, I tried the Irish Breakfast first, then the English Breakfast.  Can't say which really has more caffeine, but the Irish Breakfast had a good solid flavor that was complemented by the sugar and milk, while the English Breakfast tasted more like sugar and milk with a hint of tea in it.<br /><br />I was thinking of getting a coffee maker, but I've never been much of a coffee drinker and my wife isn't either.  Plus she's breast feeding and loves decaf peppermint tea with a little milk and sugar.  I figured I might get an electric kettle like I've seen when I was in England and visited a friend's house.  Cheaper than a coffee maker, benefits the wife, and these tea bags are way cheaper than "coffee pods" or a bottle of Diet Pepsi.<br /><br />Some friends have recommended "Morning Thunder" (half black tea, half Yerba Mate).  It can be found on Amazon, but I don't ever see it in stores, even my local semi-gourmet market which has a large tea section.  I'm not willing to buy a 6-pack just to try it, so I'll stick with the tried but true Irish Breakfast.

review/text: I rarely drink coffee anymore since it began upsetting my stomach sometime ago.  I love iced tea and drink about 2 quarts unsweetened daily made with 2 Lipton gallon sized bags.  (yes I like it a little stronger than some folks)  Several months ago I was reading a novel where the hero was always raving about drinking Irish Breakfast Tea.  After scanning a couple of local grocers I finally found a small cellophane container of 10 bags of Twinnings green label and took it home to try.<br /><br />I think this is absolutely the best tasting hot tea anywhere.  My last shopping trip I was only able to find Twinning English Breakfast Tea...and I'm drinking it...but can't say I'm enjoying it nearly as much.  The Irish Breakfast Tea is the best.  Can't wait to get some more!<br /><br />Incidently, I do like about a teaspoon of sugar in each cup of this tea.

I definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good black tea.  The only reason I don't give it five stars is because I don't feel like I know enough about tea.

Also, a tablespoon or two of a  liquere like baileys irish cream, kahlua, rum, or even grand marnier/cointreau added to the ripened bananas/coconut milk/sour cream may also be tasty.

review/text: Last Year a friend got me a bottle of this vinegar, I use it for my green beans. I was unable to find tarragon vinegar in any supermarket in my area. I was almost out and could not find the phone number of my friend that gave it to me.  So I went on line and found the exact one and ordered it.  It has to be the best Tarragon Vinegar I have ever had. I have not used it on any other vegetables other then green beans but I know it would be good on all of them. Thank You for having a good product. Barbara

review/text: As one reviewer said, it is illegal to sell Kobe beef in the United States, or anywhere outside of Japan for that matter.  It is strictly regulated, and any claims of Kobe beef being sold in the US are false.  As for "Wagyu" beef, that is a certain breed of cow.  Kobe is a particular cut of that breed.  It may be true that meat from Wagyu cows in cuts other than Kobe are available for sale here in the US, but this product specifically states that it is KOBE BEEF.  I would hope that an honest and responsible business would take a little bit of time to do their research before promoting these products.

review/summary: A popular product from a major movie
review/text: Although these delicious delicacies can stand on their own merit, they have a know reputation.  Everyone remembers the red stapler from "Offices Space" (1999). But only a connoisseur would associate gummy bears with "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" (1986). While Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) was making his principal getaway on a school bus, a young lady offered him a gummy bear. It was warm and chewy as she kept them in her pocket.<br /><br />You do not need to keep these animals in your pocket to enjoy them. Just be aware that they may not blend well with temporary fillings. You can just suck on them in that case.

review/summary: For Us Landlubbers...
review/text: Out here on the high plains we can find fresh lump crabmeat, but it costs an arm and a leg. Most cookbooks would lead you to believe that busting the budget for fresh meat is a requirement to making a quality crab-cake or cold crab salad.<br /><br />It is just not so. Whether you are a food-snob or on a budget, you will find that you can turn out great dishes with canned crab. The key is the right canned crab.<br /><br />For appetizer cakes or salads, lump crabmeat (large chunks picked from the body or backfin) is a must. If you do not get lump, you will be buying flake. Flake comes from all parts of the body and, as the description indicates, it separates into little flakes. Flake does not hold together as well, look as appealing, or taste as good as lump. Flakes only plus side is that it is cheaper. Much.<br /><br />We are not familiar with all the brands of canned crabmeat on the market, but of the ones we have tried, this one, Bumble Bee, tastes the best. If fresh meat rates a full five starts, this comes in a close 2nd with four.<br /><br />Two things will help you enjoy your dishes made from Bumble Bee crab as much as you would from fresh. First, as with any crabmeat, fresh or canned, pick over the pieces to remove all bits of shell or cartilage.<br /><br />Second, put your freshly picked over canned crabmeat into a bowl of ice water (just to cover) for about 5 minutes. Drain it well, lightly patting it dry with a paper towel to make sure the water gets removed. Not only does this "fluff" up the crab a bit, it freshens it by eliminating any taste picked up from the can.

review/summary: Cat that NEVER vomited has been vomiting daily since formula change
review/text: This used to be one of the relatively few "urinary tract" formulas out there that my cat could stomach AND was readily available at most super markets but since the recent formula change, he has been throwing up nearly every day and has started turning his nose to it. It's pretty awful and kind of scary to see him lose half of his "nourishment" every day of late. This was something he had been eating every year for the last decade (half mixed with a high-end catfood that is only meat and poultry and none of the grains and corn crap that is so bad for humans and completely counter to what cats naturally eat!).  So now I am at a loss.  I wish there was a grocer's catfood out there on the store shelves that is all meat and poultry, no sugars, no grains and no corn and has the urinary tract ingredients for these little creatures that have this problem.  I wonder if just feeding him the food he would be eating in the wild would change things around--even for the urinary tract complications...anyway, the Purina Urinary Tract Formula is no longer any good.

review/summary: Caution: Made my cat very sick!!
review/text: I've been feeding my cat this food for years without a problem. Recently she began vomiting uncontrollably after eating the food. Around her feeding time, she was at her bowl crying an begging for food like she usually does, but when we fed her she refused to touch the stuff. We thought maybe she just didn't have an appetite because she wasn't feeling well, but she scarfed down the treats and tuna we gave her. That was when we started to suspect that something was wrong with the food. We went out and bought her some canned food, and she ate that too. The only thing she wouldn't touch was the Purina food that she had eaten for years. She also stopped throwing up after we switched her food. After that, I turned to google to see if there were any recalls. I didn't find any, but I did find numerous complaints on the consumeraffairs dot com about cats (and dogs...apparently the problem isn't limited to cat food) who have recently gotten sick from Purina food. I would NOT buy this food. I have already stopped feeding it to my own cats, and I would suggest that everyone else do the same.<br /><br />If you pet has already gotten sick from the food, call this number to complain. 1-866-787-4621

review/summary: ~*~*~NO MORE URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS~*~*~
review/text: My cat is 10 years old and he used to get UTI's ALL the time(like every few months) not only was his vet bills expensive, I hated that he was in pain. I used the very expensive food I bought from the vet for cats who get lots of UTI's but since I am not Donald Trump I decided to give the Purina One Urinary Tract food a try. For years my cat didn't have a single UTI so one day at the store when they were out of the Purina One, I decided to give a cheaper Urinary Tract cat food a try. Within a month my cat was whining in the litter box and I knew he had another UTI. I took him to the Vet and sure enough, he had another UTI.<br /><br />I immediately went to the store and bought him Purina One Urinary Tract and that is what he has been on ever since. I will NEVER again try a different brand of cat food, that was over 4 years ago since I tried the cheaper cat food and he hasn't had a single UTI since. My cat LOVES his food, he is very picky but thankfully he loves his UTI formula.<br /><br />If you have a cat who gets UTI's I totally recommend giving this food a try. It costs more than the cheaper food but what it saves me in vet bills and having a happy & healthy Kitty is well worth it : )

review/summary: A decent price and quality
review/text: Its been almost a month since I switched my two cats over from Meow Mix to Purina Sensitive System. Both of them love it, and the older of the two cats has significantly vomited less after eating this food.<br /><br />I came to realize the poor quality of ingredients in Meow Mix, and hoped to find a better quality food for a good price, but its no surprise to me that even a good bag of dry cat food has some undesirable ingredients (corn gluten meal, chicken by-product, etc.) and its almost impossible to find anything of high quality without those ingredients and still be paying a decent price for it. The 3.5 lb bags I get at Target are about $6.00. Not too expensive, and the bag lasts my two cats a little over a month.<br /><br />Although Purina Sensitive Systems isn't the best ever, its not the poorest either. It falls just in the middle, and I'd recommend it to those who can only afford an inexpensive dry cat food, but with better quality than the cheaper Meow Mix brands.

review/summary: Much Healthier Cats Since Switching
review/text: I have two cats with chronic problems. Marci had chronic diarrhea. I took her to the Texas A&M pet clinic. Several tests were run to identify the cause. None of the tests results identified any problems. After I switched to Purina One, her diarrhea cleared with no recurring problems.<br /><br />My other cat, Beauty-Bells, suffered from recurring urinary tract infections. She has not one since eating Purina One. I have not had to buy the formula for urinary tract infections. The regular Purina One formulas have been sufficient.<br /><br />Being on a tight budget with 8 cats, I had long hesitated to switch to food that is so much more expensive. My cats actually eat less. They are also much healthier with shiny, soft coats and more energy. I switched 3 kittens to Purina one and the differences in health were obvious much quicker than with the older cats. I keep threatening to put them on cheaper food because they are tearing up my house with all the energy they have! Of course, I them to much to do that!<br /><br />The switch has been well worth it. Being so happy and amazed with results, I don't think I'll ever feed them anything else.

review/summary: Purina One Sensitive - great for a cat with digestion trouble
review/text: We recently took in a cat that could not keep any food down.  She would throw up multiple times a day, usually within an hour or so of eating.  We thought she may be overeating, so we limited how much food we gave her, we tried to spread out the food to force her to breath and chew between pieces.  We tried many different foods, including multiple foods recommended by the vet.  After a lot of money spent on vet visits and tests, with the vet finding nothing wrong with her, I saw this food and figured trying a food for sensitive systems couldn't hurt.<br /><br />We'd already tried other Purina One formulas without success, so we weren't particularly optimistic, but hopeful.  Our cat has been eating this for about two or three weeks now and she has not thrown up at all.  I love this food, it was hard to watch her throw up so much, and, frankly, it wasn't pleasant cleaning it up so frequently.  I'm glad I found this and fully recommend it to anyone with a cat with similar problems keeping food down.

review/text: My little guy suffered two urinary blockages. For anyone who has gone through this knows how scary it is and EXPENSIVE it is to treat. My vet told me I could keep him on his regular food as he mainly eats wet food but I started feeding him Halo's cat food- the wet chicken formula since it's not as high in protein which caused part of his problem. This dry food is excellent for urinary health issues. My cat has not suffered another blockage since I have had him on this food regularly and he hasn't had anymore UTI's either which I am happy about and hope it continues. And the best part is he loves the food so I didn't have to worry about that either. They use real chicken in this food and there is no by product or fake crap. If you have a cat who suffers from FLUTD or UTI- give this food a try- it works geat!

review/summary: My two kitties love Purina One.
review/text: I have two cats.  They have eaten Purina One for six years now. Their coats are shiny and they both look healthy and have lots of energy. They are both eleven years old.  I started feeding them Purina One because the first ingredient on the label was chicken. There are also no artificial colors or flavors and unlike some pet foods it is manufactured in the United States. Those are enough reasons for me to choose this particular food. I think that even though Purina One is not the best of the best of cat foods, it is a good value for the price, and the cats love it. My male kitty will not eat anything else. A tip for anyone just introducing a new food to your kitty:  Introduce the food slowly by mixing just a little of the new food with the old food.  Increase the amount each time you feed the kitty eventually eliminating the quantity of the previous food.  This will help to alleviate any stomach upset that your kitty may experience from a new food.

review/summary: My cat's favorite dry food
review/text: I have a very picky older cat. She is probably extra picky because she's old and has trouble digesting some cat foods. This one though is her favorite dry food. She begs for it and waits by her bowl one hour before dinner. My other cat also gets very excited about this food. I've found with other foods that they get occasional hairballs, but with this one it's a very rare occasion for either of them to have a hairball- maybe once a year. Previously when I fed them the cute cat foods (like Meow Mix) half of the food would stay in the bowl and the older cat was particularly adept at separating out the shapes she didn't like.<br /><br />Although the price on Amazon is very competitive to buying single bags at the grocery store, I found that the 16 pound bag at Pet Smart goes on sale for $18.99 and the last bag I bought included a $5 Pet Smart gift card. If I only had one cat though I would definitely buy from Amazon for the convenience factor and the price is competitive with Tar get and other grocers.<br /><br />Both of my cats got shinier coats as well since making the switch to Purina One a few years ago. There are several formulas (in addition to this one) to meet your particular cats needs:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BEXBCS">Purina One Cat Food Sensitive System, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a><br />Purina One Cat Food Vibrant Maturity 7+ Senior Formula, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BEXBAK">Purina One Cat Food Advanced Nutrition Hairball Formula, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDI0QQ">Purina One Cat Food Salmon & Tuna Formula, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDEI7G">Purina One Cat Healthy Weight Management, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDI0RA">Purina One Healthy Kitten Formula, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BETMEO">Purina One Cat Food Chicken & Rice Formula, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDI0RK">Purina One Cat Food Urinary Tract Health Formula, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: The vet made me get the expensive food his office pushes on everyone and I'm sure gets paid to sell to his patients. I fed this to my cat and he went from a healthy 12 pounds up to 20 pounds.  I went right out and got the Purina food and began feed it to my cat. That was 4 months ago and now he is back down to 15 pounds and I am NOT getting any more expensive vet food.

review/summary: Advice
review/text: Please make sure you buy this food in small quantities at first if you are unsure that your cat will like it. Our Russian Blue treats it like medicine because he hates the taste of it. He only eats it because we have been strict with his diet and refuse to give him much else besides the urinary formulated foods. We intend to stop buying this product completely.<br /><br />Our most effective food for him has been the Royal Canin Urinary Formula (you can only get it from the vet), as he loves it and it keeps his pH in check - however, it's $50 for a 7 lb bag. Not too pretty.<br /><br />We also tried the more expensive "Pro Plan" equivalent - and it is the same product in a different bag, which made it even worse. Both products do work (this one and the Pro Plan) but good luck trying to feed it!<br /><br />We now feed wet Friskies "Special Diet : Urinary pH" and our cats love it! It comes in beef, chicken, or (the best one) ocean whitefish. It's very affordable as well. Check it out.<br /><br />If you still decide to try this out, please please please buy a small bag first so you know your cat will not hate it!

review/summary: Cat loves it
review/text: Our cat loves this formula.  I'm happy that the primary ingredients are actual meat, rather than grains.  Cats are carnivores, after all.  Our cat has had many less problems with hairballs and weight gain as well.

review/summary: Saved my carpets and possibly my cat
review/text: For years my cat has had digestive issues no matter what food I've given her.  I've spoken to the vet about this a few times and more than one vet simply told me "Some cats throw up more than others".<br /><br />I tried a few other sensitive stomach-type cat foods, including Eukanuba, which is considered one of the best on the market.  Not only did the Eukanuba not work, but because the fiber content in it was so high, I had to change my litter boxes twice as often as I had to previously.<br /><br />This cat food has been a life saver for both of the cats I have with digestive issues.  It has reduced the number of times my cat throws up significantly, from a few times a week, to once or less (outside of normal hairballs).  The other cat with some litterbox issues have cleared up almost entirely.<br /><br />Well worth the money (which is far less on Amazon than any local pet store I've found).<br /><br />If you have a cat with a sensitive stomach, this is the answer.

review/summary: Kitties love it and a lot less expensive than the vet's
review/text: One of the kitties has a very sensitive tummy, and I had been spending quite a bit of money, not to mention the inconvenience of running to the vet's every couple of weeks to buy their "special" brand.  One day I noticed that Purina made the vet's brand, and started to wonder if they made a version sold in the grocer.  Sure enough, Sensitive Systems from the Purina One line was in the store.  I slowly transitioned the kitties to it without any ill effects.  Purchasing this on the regularly scheduled delivery not only lowered my costs, it is so convenient to come home and find it waiting on my doorstep!  I am really pleased with the Purina One brand.  The cats are healthy, and can't wait for me to get up in the morning to bring it to them.

review/summary: Beware! Not the product shown in picture!
review/text: Amazon, please update your picture for accurate product info.<br /><br />If you are looking for this product made with yogurt, this is NOT it despite what the picture shows. Purina has changed the recipe, and its hard to find the old formula that was made with yogurt. My cat has a sensitive stomach and has thrown up all foods we have tried besides the type made with yogurt. Now that the recipe has changed, he is throwing up daily again. I was so excited to see I could buy the yogurt version on AMAZON in bulk... till it arrived. This is not the product I wanted, the picture is very misleading considering their disclaimer says that all ingredients may not be listed on the site. Its on the picture so I thought I would get what I saw.

review/summary: Hairball free!
review/text: I began using this food as soon as my cats were off kitten food, mostly to *prevent* hairballs, and it worked! My cats are coming up on their 4th birthday (2 of them), and have not once ever had a hairball. I mix this food 2:1 with the sensitive systems food because one of my cats has digestive issues. I can't vouch for the taste myself, but the cats eat it!

review/summary: Great for difficult cat
review/text: We have a difficult Indoor Cat, with a sensitive stomach and this has been the only food he can eat and not throw up constantly.  I would not say it gets rid of hair balls but I think it has really cut down on the number of hairballs we have to live through.  Weight wise, I dont see his indoor life causeing weight gain so it must be helping there as well.  I wish the price was not so high, but on subscribe and save, I save money, and never run out.....

review/summary: Excellent dry cat food
review/text: We buy this cat food for our three cats, two who live out doors and one inside. I think it helps with the hairball issues, and I trust Purina. But mostly our cats really like it and they have to like it to make it worthwhile, right? One of our cats is 10 years old, one is 17 and one is who knows what age ... all are adopted/rescued. They are all fat and pretty.
