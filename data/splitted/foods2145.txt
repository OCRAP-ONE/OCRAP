review/summary: k-cups coffee
review/text: Green Mountain Coffee with Carmel, it is great, has great flovor and richnes. When you buy a case, that is 24 K-CUPS, in a box. And it is not exspensive, you can afford this carmel coffee. It is great. And you will like it as much as I did. I highly reccommend this coffee with carmel in it, and rich flovor.<br /><br />Jim in Ohio

review/summary: Good in a Pinch
review/text: I like Green Mountain coffee and have for quite some time. These K-Cup packs seem to lack the punch of freshly brewed Green Mountain in can get at your local neighborhood convenience store. This particular blend I found rather lackluster and just plain weak. Still, it was good in a pinch.

Because it's a k-cup it makes the perfect cup of coffee every time, and I can sit back and enjoy the delicious flavor.  I will most certainly be reordering these.

review/summary: Truly does taste like a caramel macchiato!
review/text: I was skeptical when I read the other reviews saying that this Green Mountain Caramel Vanilla Cream coffee tasted like a Starbucks Caramel Macchiato but I was very pleasantly surprised! I tried it with just milk, milk & vanilla creamer, and just vanilla creamer.<br />The milk & creamer (big splashes of each) yielded the best faux caramel macchiato flavor. Obviously it's more of a cafe au lait than a latte, but for under $1, I am very satisfied with this cuppa joe.<br />I prefer this flavor over the green mountain Hazelnut flavored coffee.<br /><br />I tried 4 and 10 ounce sizes and was pleased with the strength and flavor of both sizes, with the smaller size being a bit darker.<br /><br />If you like flavored coffees, this is a definite YES.

review/text: My wife and I agree that this is one of the better K-Cup coffee flavors. It's a tasty caramel flavor, which tastes natural and doesn't overpower the coffee. It also has a great aroma. The coffee isn't quite as delicious as say a Dunkin Donuts caramel latte, but the convenience of K-Cups means that we will be using this product in our house again and again.

review/text: I'm not a ****bucks regular, but when I do, it is the caramel machiatto for me.  I just can't resist it.  I was curious as to how close this would come to that favorite of mine.  My expectations were low, but this totally surprised me.  It has the smooth caramel taste with just a hint of the vanilla.  It's not overpowering at all.  Thoroughly enjoyable.<br /><br />Now, if they could just figure out how to get that whipped cream on the top, I'd really be a "happy camper".

review/summary: My favorite K-cup coffee
review/text: Let me start off that before I bought my husband a Keurig for Christmas, I only drank a coffee drink once in a blue moon...when I stopped by a Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts and it was normally a latte, etc. But I decided to try out some of the flavored coffee, and after adding some sugar and milk, I now drink at least a couple of cups a day. The Caramel Vanilla Cream is my favorite thus far. Make no mistake, this is a sweeter coffee and a light roast. It's perfect for a gal like me that prefers a hint of the coffee flavor. The caramel and vanilla flavors stand out, much more than some of the other coffees I've tried.

review/summary: Affordable substitute for this caramel macchiato lover
review/text: I love myself a sweet caramel macchiato from Starbuck's, but they're overpriced and high in calories/sugar.  While I still enjoy one as an occassional treat, these taste wonderful for a morning cup of coffee.  I still have to have sweetener, so I also add some flavored creamer in mine.  I've tried a lot of different flavored k-cups and these are my favorite.  Just wish Green Mountain made them in decaf.  I live in Colorado, so sometimes a hot cup of coffee would be nice at night, but I wouldn't be able to handle caffeine.

review/summary: Good, but not what I expected
review/text: The flavor itself is good, I like this coffee and will enjoy it. Nothing more convenient for a college student than the keurig, although its somewhat more costly... I am willing to pay the costs and find them acceptable. Others may not, but keurig is a matter of opinion I suppose. The coffee is well brewed by my mr. Coffee keurig, but the flavor isn't what I expected. Bare cup, taste only vanilla, which I found a bit dissapointing because I love caramel; the caramel flavor only comes out when I add sugar (three packets of sugar in the raw, in my experience). Sugar added it tastes great, but the caramel is minute as compared to the vanilla...<br /><br />All in all it's good. I will try Gloria jeans butter toffee next, and choose a favorite after that (big into sugary flavored coffee). Otherwise, get this if just to try it. You won't regret it.

review/text: We originally purchased this blend because my wife was a big fan of the Green Mountain French Vanilla blend, mixed with a caramel creamer.  We had hoped that this blend would have a similar flavor, but it didn't.<br /><br />We've tried numerous Green Mountain blends.  This one was definitely the least impressive of the bunch (so far).  The flavor isn't bad by any means -- it's certainly drinkable -- but it feels like it's missing something, especially when compared against other K-cups in the same price range.<br /><br />For comparison's sake: Our K-cup blends so far are the GMC Breakfast Blend, the French Vanilla blend, and Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee blend.  If you're looking for something a little darker, Emeril's Big Easy Bold blend is also very nice.

review/text: Like others have said the price on here is high, and I bought it for a lot less at Kohls but am not going to give it a bad review over the price.  The cofee is very good.<br /><br />It does taste just like Carmel Vanilla.  It is very strong, so if you don't like your coffee super strong I would recomend brewing a larger cup if you have an adjustable cup size setting on your brewer.  If I drink it hot I brew the large travel size cup and it is the perrfect strength for me.  It is very good brewed as an ice coffee, and seeing it is a stronger brew, it is great for iced coffee.<br /><br />I like to put in sugar free Vanilla syrup isntead of splenda to sweeten it and that really enhances the flavor.  I am sure it would be great with carmel syrup as well.

review/summary: Just like Starbucks Caramel Macchiato!!
review/text: This is one of the yummiest K-cups I've had, and my husband and I have tried a lot of them!  When sugar and milk are added, this tastes very similar to Starbucks' Caramel Macchiato.  Also good when iced.  I also like Green Mountain's Iced Vanilla K-cups, so if you like those, you will definitely like these as well.

While I can and have drunk Italian style espresso, for my daily coffee I prefer something that doesn't have a chance of making me jumpy or give me a headache.  This Caribou Columbian is perfect.

review/summary: Love Caribou
review/text: I received a Keurig B-70 for Christmas a couple years ago and with it got the Caribou Colombian k-cups.  I used to go to Caribou at least once or twice a week to get my coffee and then just have Folgers the rest of the time.  When I made my first cup of coffee with the Caribou Colombian I told my boyfriend and son that I would never have to go to caribou coffee house/shop again.  This is the best of all caribou coffee.  It's smooth and delicious.  If you like mocha or dont like coffee black it is also delicious with sugar and cream or milk.  I make mine with a dash of chocolate milk and 2 heaping tablespoons of Swiss miss hot cocoa for a 14 to 15 oz cup.  Very good!  I have not had any other kind of coffee since.  This is the perfect coffee!

review/text: I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to coffee, I like my cup a little strong but usually go for medium styles as the bold and extra bold blends upset my stomach. Columbia is typically my favorite type of coffee and I was very pleased with this offering from Caribou Coffee. I've had their original "blend" on multiple occasions as its one of my favorites in k-cups. I'm not really sure how my coffee tastes stack up against other peoples but if you like a good middle of the road cup of coffee I highly recommend this.

review/summary: excellent soup!
review/text: The only reason this gets a four and not a five is that it is pretty cheap and easy to just go to your grocer and pick up the beans required to make your own multi-bean soup, then toss them in a Rubbermaid and use them at will.  Red Mills, however, has incredibly high quality products, and I confess that when I'm in a rush, or know little about the quality of the food choices before me, I tend toward this brand.  I'm picky about the nutritive value of foods, and the way they are grown and processed, and this has been a safe place to go for that.<br /><br />Making a soup with this particular mix is as easy as falling off a log!  If you're nervous and don't have a recipe, just cheat the first time out of the gate by tossing in onion soup mix/your favorite homemade broth and some veggies.  You also can't go wrong with chunks of ham and some ham broth or bouillon.  Add a chunk of crusty bread with butter, and a nice spinach salad, and enjoy a truly great and simple eating experience!

review/summary: A lot of beans in this soup
review/text: Yes, Bob's Red Mill 13 bean soup mix is more expensive than if you were to assemble the beans yourself.  However, this mix conveniently puts the 13 beans together and offers recipes on the back suggesting how to prepare it.  The mix doesn't come with spices - it is beans only - so you will have to come up with everything else yourself.<br /><br />This is a good product if you are cooking for a crowd, or if you really, really love beans.  One bag makes a large pot of soup.  But if you are cooking for a smaller crowd, you might find yourself getting tired of bean soup pretty quickly.<br /><br />I liked the soup the first time I made it.  But one package filled my bean quota for a while.  The remaining packages have remained on the shelf.

review/text: This soup was good but even better after I added some italian sausage.  You could add chicken sausage if you want to make it healthier.  Keep in mind when you use a bag, you may only want to use half of the beans at one time.  I made the mistake of soaking all the beans in one bag at once and then had about 4 cups too many beans.  I've frozen the extra beans and will use them later.

By the way, Bob's Red Mill Soup Bean Seasoning increased a whopping 48% up to $47.55.  When you get an E-Mail about one of your favorite products that Amazon tracks, don't just assume they're passing on a price bargain!<br />UPDATE:  Two days later after my original post the price has now decreased by $1.33 to $19.41.  I'm a seasoned Amazon customer who is generally very satisfied.  Although after following the price fluctuations I kind of feel like I'm involved in the stock market.

review/summary: Easy and Versatile
review/text: While you could buy these beans separately and mix them together yourself, I think Bob's Red Mill got the mix spot on. This soup is downright tasty, especially with the Bean Soup Seasoning Mix that Bob's also makes. In addition to the Seasoning mix I also add some diced tomato, onion, and whatever other veggies I have on hand (potato, carrot, celery). I also add about a tsp of ground fancy mustard when I make 1/4 package. This soup is very versatile - you could add whatever seasonings and veggies you like and get a good fit.<br /><br />Having the beans pre-mixed is also easier. I measure out 1/4 package in the evening and let them soak overnight. In the morning I toss the beans, veggies, seasoning, and some water in my small crock pot and dinner is ready when I get home! I would say it takes about 20 minutes of prep and clean up time and I get enough soup for 4 meals out of it. You should definitely try this soup!

review/text: Nice mix of beans, but NOT soup.  It does say that in the fine print, but why it's called soup mix I don't know.  It is simply a bag of 13 kinds of dry beans which must be washed, soaked, and cooked for hours just like any other dry beans.  It apparently has no added seasonings or such to make it a true soup.  Maybe having thirteen types of dry beans in one bag is a convenience, however it states they are best kept refrigerated or frozen!!!  This is a real disappointment.  I will not reorder this 13 Bean (so-called) Soup Mix.

review/summary: Shipping issues
review/text: Well here goes--yes it was good to find this creamer on amazon BUT instead of coming in the dispenser box they came fired in a shipping box. One or more them had leaked which made kind of a mess.  It would have been nice if these little containers were in a dispenser box INSTEAD  of being fired in a shipping box.  I hate with a passion cleaning up sticky things. At least only a couple of them leaked but that is still unacceptable.

review/summary: I love chocolate!!!
review/text: I have always loved these creamers because of the perfect mix of creaminess and chocolate. Unfortunately, they pulled the containers from retail businesses. I was forced to go without or stuff my pockets with the single serving containers at convenience stores.<br />Now, I am able to buy and partake of these goodies whenever I want!!! I will be buying some more soon!<br />BTW, shipping was awesome and very quick!

The larger package for home use might seem excessive, but she uses these at home and work.  I prefer the Irish creamer they make.  Great product.

review/summary: International Delight Chocolate Creamer
review/text: The Chocolate creamer is great.  It is not as sweet as most of the other creamers, yet gives your coffee a sweeter taste than plain creamer.  The chocolate creamer is only available in the single-serve packages.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as with most products there are Pros and Cons about it.<br /><br />Buying it in the individual serve packages is slightly more pricey than if you were buying a pint or quart bottle, which they do not offer anymore.  This can be a good thing if you are using it for customers at a business, but for personal use it is not as convenient.  Also, since these are being shipped, you take the risk of one or more of the little packages opening up and making a mess on the rest of the box full.<br /><br />I recommend this product to all chocolate lovers who like just a little sweetness in their coffee.  I just wish International Delight would offer this product in the pint or quart bottles again.

review/text: My husband loves this creamer and can't find it in the stores so we ordered a few cases from Amazon.  When they arrived we saw that they were not packed in shrinkwrap, but were left in the box individually on their own..therefore a few broke open and we had a very sticky sloppy mess!  We were not pleased at all...yuckky to clean up.  We still love the product, but heartly suggest they are wrapped tightly inside the box to eliminate this mess!

review/summary: Hard to resist chocolate
review/text: For quite a while now, because I am a chocolate lover, I've been drinking General Foods International Coffee. I liked the Vienese Chocolate Cafe because of the good flavor. Because of the calories and fat grams, I have decreased how much I drink that and went to regular coffee. I was so happy when I found that I could get Chocolate creamer. It's very good and flavorfull. I hope it's a product that they will always carry.

review/summary: Not enough chocolate
review/text: Ive been searching for a chocolate coffee creamer for a while - when I saw this product on Amazon,<br />I couldn't wait to get it!  But sadly, I should have known better - to me, ALL the International Delight creamers taste the same, as if they all start with the same basic creamer recipe (which has a readily identifiable flavor) and just add in the extra flavoring for whatever batch they're making.  I also found this creamer to be sorely lacking in chocolate flavor.  When you pour it out, it has such a thick, dark look that it comes as a surprise that the creamer has such an underwhelming chocolate flavor.<br />I took the rest of the 288 creamers to work for everyone to use, and the box is still there after 3 weeks barely half empty.  Apparently even when free this stuff doesn't delight.  If you really want great chocolate flavor in your coffee, add some extra dark chocolate syrup - don't bother with this stuff.

review/summary: Green Energy
review/text: I have tried a couple of different yerba mate teas and this is by far my favorite. It consists only of freshly dried yerba mate leaves and nothing else-no additives, no artifical or natural sweeteners. Just pure yerba mate. I use my french press to brew myself a fresh cup. The taste is very green and has the familiar slightly bitter taste of yerba mate. Since this tea is neither smoked nor aged you will get all the vitamins and minerals that get lost in other brands. If you are looking for a coffee substitute this tea fits the bill. It provides a nice boost of energy similar to coffee without giving you the jitters after one too many cups. I discovered this tea when I needed to reduce my own coffee intake and I can only recommend it. I love that it is energizing as well as healthy for you. That's a combination that can't be beat.

review/summary: super fresh green Life-infusion
review/text: Yerba Mate is my drink. I've sampled many brands, all organic, and Mate Factor shines brightly above them all. Their packaging is one indication of the care and attention they bring to ensuring the freshest mate available. The clean, fresh aroma greets you as you finally cut through the seal. Put the herb in your gourd or cup and let it exfoliate in cool water for several minutes. Then add hot (not boiling) water. Smell it again as you watch it bubble to life. If you are already a mate drinker you will be delightfully surprised as the infusion rises through your bombilla into your mouth. This is like no other mate. It is rich, fresh, well balanced and full of life. On the "circle of drink" website, their reviewer describes it as the hot chocolate of mates. If you are new to the world of yerba mate, I invite you to try this brand. It will be your standard from which you can then experience the vast world of yerba mate, with so many distinctive flavors. Salud!

review/summary: The Best Yerba Mate on the Market
review/text: I've tried quite a few Yerba Mate brands and Mate Factor is the best. Yerba Mate in general is an acquired taste and unlike most traditional teas, primarily because it's grittier, more "raw" (if that makes sense) and looks less refined. This brand gets the right consistency and it is quite good after you adjusted to it. Add a bit of lemon and it's a great morning alternative to coffee or traditional morning teas. Yerba Mate is a morning staple for me and I wouldn't use any other brand.

review/summary: Surprising list of ingredients
review/text: For family members who just will not eat their vegetables, this is a welcome option.  From the Campbell's website, here are the ingredients in the strawberry banana variety: RECONSTITUTED VEGETABLE JUICE BLEND (WATER AND CONCENTRATED JUICES OF SWEET POTATOES, CARROTS, TOMATOES, BEETS), RECONSTITUTED FRUIT JUICES (WATER AND CONCENTRATED JUICES OF WHITE GRAPES, ORANGES, APPLES, STRAWBERRIES, CLARIFIED BANANAS), CONTAINS LESS THAN 2% OF: NATURAL FLAVORING, BANANA PUREE, VITAMIN C (ASCORBIC ACID), MALIC ACID, CITRIC ACID, VITAMIN E (ALPHA TOCOPHEROL ACETATE).<br />With each can comes one serving of vegetables and one serving of fruits.  A grab and go way to get a little more nutrition into the hands of those who would otherwise be drinking a carbonated beverage or other nutrient free substance.  I have found several people who will not touch a traditional V8 will drink this one.  Try the Pomegranate blueberry variety too.

review/summary: The best of the Fusion flavors
review/text: After a few years away from the V8 Fusion flavors, I decided to try them again when I got a coupon for a pack of cans. After trying this, I tried a couple of other flavors and instantly regretted it; while this is palatable and easy drinking on a hot day, all of the rest are syrupy and fake-tasting to the max, as if they're trying to emulate Mountain Dew. Here you can actually taste the strawberry and banana, unlike the other flavors, and it's got a smooth instead of syrupy texture, but it still basically tastes like mostly-flat soda pop rather than a juice box. I will either finish mine or bring them to a party for the kids, but I won't be ordering them again. You can get significantly more nutrition and the same satisfaction by popping a small multivitamin with any generic soda.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you love the others, then this one might be too watered down for your taste. Try a small bottle at the store before you commit to a large case.<br /><br />It's also no healthier than regular soda pop: Although they can claim "no sugar added", the claim of "full serving and fruit and vegetables" is extremely misleading because a serving of either typically consists of a large amount of fiber and a small amount of protein, and in this drink everything but the sugar has been mostly removed. Real food also has much higher vitamin and mineral content. I'd consider that false advertising, since having this will only give you a sugar rush and make you crave more, not feel full, but your mileage may vary; as a parent, you should put it in the same category as regular soda pop, not a veggie substitute. I should have checked into the nutritional information before ordering.<br /><br />Since it's difficult to find the nutrition info online:<br />Calories: 120<br />Total Fat: 0 g<br />Cholesterol: 0 mg<br />Sodium: 70 mg<br />Potassium: 250 mg<br />Total Carbs: 28 g<br />-Fiber: 1 g<br />-Sugars: 25 g<br />Protein: 1 g<br /><br />Vitamin A: 70%<br />Vitamin C: 100%<br /><br />Negligible amounts of other vitamins and minerals.

review/summary: I LOVE this one ...
review/text: I am NOT a big raw veggie eater, but at the same time, I try to eat healthily. V8 fusion (in these handy individual cans) are my favorite way to add one juice and one Vegetable to my lunch. I throw the can in the frige at work, and since everyone just sees the V8 part, they don't steal it on me.<br /><br />But honestly, the Strawberry bannana is good enough to make into a smoothie - it's that delicious.<br /><br />The big bottles are a lot cheaper at my grocery store, but these are a lot handier. It's a balance ... money or convenience. (For recyclers, these cans are recyclable).<br /><br />They come in 6-packs in the store, and I suggest you try them that way first.
