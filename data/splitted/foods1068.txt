review/summary: Easy to eat applesauce
review/text: It's applesauce, that you can squeeze.  What else is there to say??  It's a good travel snack, my 2 y/o finds it much easier to use than a spoon and bowl, and it's less messy.

review/text: I keep a few of these in the diaper bag for my boys.  Both the baby and the toddler.  They both love them and these are their first choice for a snack if we are out.  The toddler I can just open and hand it to and he'll suck it all out.  The baby is starting to get the hang of sucking it so I don't need to squeeze it.  No spoon, no mess, easy snack, and no added sugar or high fructose corn syrup!!

review/summary: My son loves these
review/text: We have these in several flavors.  Ever since we found the baby food pouches that are proliferating on store shelves, we've been a fan.  It's a great way to get a snack in without alot of mess.  We carry them in the diaper bag religiously.  These have been a better, cheaper choice than the baby-food brand options.  No extra sugar and additives (if I recall that correctly), and less money per oz.  The boxes arrived in perfect condition, and in bulk, it's cheaper than big box store prices, even when they have them on sale.  We've recommended them to friends.

review/text: I love these for when I jog long distances - instead of using the gels; it's got the re-closable top and I like the taste.  Well, I actually like the apple WAY better than the apple/banana.  Also, I keep a box in the car and at work... it's a quick easy and CONVENIENT snack... so I don't have to worry about being tempted in going to a drive thru when I'm hungry.  I'm betting kiddies would like it - as it's similar to a sippy box ;)

review/summary: Childhood in a box!
review/text: These are SO FREAKIN' GOOD! I'm not much into kiddie candy, but when the local Dollar Store had a candy dish set out, I grabbed a box to try. Before I left, I went back and grabbed another box and told myself I'd stop in the next day and grab a couple bags. But, OH NO! They were all gone! So I searched all the area Dollar Stores, and sadly, there were none. I'm really hoping to buy them from Amazon as the only other place I've found is the Candy Warehouse, and who can afford their shipping?!

These are not the flavors you will receive. I love KIND bars, and I get 2 boxes shipped to my house automatically each month. This month the flavors inside the box have changed, but the product description has not been updated.

review/text: I absolutely love these bars, and with Celiac in my family, they were the perfect breakfast bars and snacks when traveling.. Great tasting, and not very fattening.  You can feel good giving to children or treating yourself!  The perfect balance.<br /><br />however, both Harmon Cosmetics and Shoprite offer cheaper for each bar, which is sad, because I love ordering online.  I also think it is not fair that the Subscribe & Save prices keep shifting/ increasing to the point there is no benefit.  I will continue to buy, just not through Amazon.  And Kind Bars need to offer some rewards program for those of us who are loyal consumers.

And since I can't find the mini ones in the store, this is a great option for me.  I also like the assortment because a big box of just one flavor would get pretty old after a while.  Wish there was a variety pack of the big sized ones for my husband.

Some of my favorite flavors are Chocolate Cherry Cashew and Cranberry Almond, but there's not a "bad" flavor.  I keep these at work for that mid-morning snack and in the car all the time.

review/summary: Great snack, great price, great variety.
review/text: My wife and I are granola bar eaters. For a long time we ate the Fiber One brand but recently switched over to the KIND brand.<br /><br />First, we originally thought this product was too expensive (despite it looking and reading better than other products) but recently found them on Amazon.com for a reasonable price (using subscribe and save) and decided to give them a try.<br /><br />We find the KIND minis are great for a midday snack and fulfill our granola bar needs. While they are in-fact small in appearance, they seem to pack quite the energetic punch. The variety pack is great for those who might get sick of the same-old-routine.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful.

review/summary: Healthy Kind Of Yum
review/text: I have seen KIND bars in the local natural foods supermarkets in my area for a while now. I always wanted to try them, but one regular size bar was a little too pricey for my budget, and I was afraid they would taste like other health food bars - flavorless and chalky. I was very wrong, but we'll get to that in a moment.<br /><br />My mother told me about this amazing and healthy fruit/nut bar called KIND bars. At the time, I couldn't remember if it was the same brand of bars I had been seeing in the supermarkets. She told me I had to try them. I'm pro healthy and I'm always on the look out for wholesome foods that aren't full of HFC and other crap. I'm prepared for the day when I'm old and grey and the news reports that HFC isn't safe after all. I've researched a direct correlation between high fructose cornsyrup and obesity in America. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that it is probably responsible for many illnesses that are becoming predominant in our society paired with the entirely too large portions we are accustomed to eating today. Most of us have no idea what it's like to actually be "starving" and if we did experience starvation, most Americans could live off their fat reserves for quite some time. We need to stop "dieting" and start changing our eating habits and lifestyle!<br /><br />Okay, where was I? Oh yeah, so the KIND bars, they definitely meet my healthy expectations above and beyond AND they are also delicious. I finally picked up a regular sized bar and although it tasted amazing (almond and apricot), it was very filling and I had to save half for later. When I saw there was a variety box of mini bars, I was elated. It is the perfect size for me and each flavor is incredibly delicious and unique.<br /><br />I would recommend trying them first before buying an entire box (we are extremely wasteful as a society as well), but I'm confident that the majority of those that try this product will be very satisfied.

review/summary: Love the bars, but they made a dangerous change to the items included in this mix...!
review/text: I really love Kind bars but I was very disappointed when they recently changed the mix of bars included in the multi-pack.  My husband is allergic to peanuts but can eat all other nuts.  Previously the mix included only one bar with peanuts, which was great - I ate those and he could have everything else.<br /><br />In my last "subscribe & save" shipment, they sent a different mix of bars which has TWO kinds of bars with peanuts in them.  I am mad that they made this dangerous change without alerting us - previously there was one "color" of wrap that my husband knew to avoid.  He could have been sent into anaphylactic shock if he had mistakenly eaten the wrong bar because of the "blind" change.<br /><br />The mix no longer includes the apricot bars.

review/summary: Not Fresh!
review/text: I ordered this product with the expectation of receiving a fresh product. There were clumps in the individual cups that didn't dissolve in the hot water coming from the machine. Other K-Cups that I've purchased are all powder, but the Cafe Vanilla had problems that you could hear when you shook the cup. With the clumps not dissolving in the water, the flavor is more watered-down than it should be. I have used other products from this same line of K-Cups, but this was sub-par to any other K-Cup I've ever purchased.

review/text: I absolutely love these!<br />Each canister is filled with individually wrapped prunes.<br /><br />I am the only one in our house who eats these.  I've tried buying the bags,<br />and buying another type of canister, but they always get dried out before I<br />can finish them all.  This is just right - allows me to eat them when I want to,<br />and I always get a fresh product.<br /><br />While they could do better on the cost in my opinion, I have not had a bad one<br />from this canister from Sunsweet yet. Is it the best value for your money?<br />Depends on how you look at it - it costs more per prune, but in my case, I have a lot<br />less waste. So, it is a flip of the coin.<br /><br />The fruit, however, is fresh, soft and tasty. Don't let an "old person" image of prunes<br />keep you from trying this yummy fruit!

review/summary: Wonderful!
review/text: If you ever thought prunes were for only for people with health problems then you are in for a shock. These things are DELICIOUS. Sweet, moist, a little chewy, it's like candy. I would eat these just for the taste. It's the perfect afternoon pick me up, along with a handful of nuts or mini bag of popcorn. Best of all though, are the health benefits. All that fiber definitely has an impact. I have 3-4 prunes a day and let's just say it really does keep you regular if you catch my drift. My digestive system has never been so happy! Trust me, it's a noticeable thing. I started eating these around the time I started eating healthier in general, but I've lost over 15 pounds in 2 months after I starting eating these (at only 100 cal and no fat for 5 prunes, it makes sense). Plus all those vitamins are great in general. Fiber is also good for your heart health, can't ignore that when heart disease kills more people than the next 7 leading causes of death. Combined.<br /><br />I love that these are individually packaged. I sometimes buy the ones that come all together in a bag and by the time I get to the bottom they're always a little dry. These stay moist no matter how long it takes me to eat them. I love that can I just throw them in my bag with my lunch and don't have to worry about getting a tupperware. It's wasteful, but they really taste a lot better. I can't rave enough about these. They taste amazing, they are great for you, they're filling, what more could you ask for?

I would not buy the variety pack again-in bulk.  The favorites that I liked will be purchased in bulk.  I would recommend if you buy this, give a box or two away to a friend or family member.

review/summary: From a tea-lover: MUST TRY
review/text: As a foodie, I'm also a bit of a snob about teas, generally preferring organic, muslin-bagged or loose teas. That said, this Stash Chanakara Tea sampler, on first try, immediately became my favourite tea purchase, and I promptly ordered this excellent bulk value offered by Amazon, soon after trying each of the seven teas included in the box. Each tea "chakra" consists of extremely aromatic and flavour-filled combinations of herbs, flowers, leaves of a colour corresponding to each chakra. While I cannot offer evidence of their efficacy in chakra work, I will say I did some best-guessing about where my particular energies were on a given day, and found that the chakra-tea I chose each time really did seem particularly soothing. New age-y ideas aside, the teas really are extremely flavourful without being overly sour (as I find many brands, like Celestial Seasonings, can be). The scents are noticeably lovely, and for me, I didn't find one flavour that I didn't truly love. Highly recommend.

review/summary: Excellent Chanakara Tea Sampler
review/text: Chankara teas are Stash tea's new line of Chakra (energy center) teas.  Like all Stash teas, they are excellent.  You may find you favor some flavours more than others, which is the perfect reason to try the sampler, so you can see which flavours you like best.  They are made with natural ingredients and flavorings and I have found the taste of Chanakra to be quite different than the other flavoured teas I have experienced.  Each bag is sealed in its own foil package, to seal in the delicate flavour.<br /><br />The Chanakara line has a flavor for each of the 7 major Chakras of the body and you will see individual reviews that I have written on the various flavours.<br /><br />Chakra 1 -- Root Chakra -- base of spine<br />Chakra 2 -- Sacral Chakra -- sexual area<br />Chakra 3 -- Solar Plexus -- belly area, around navel<br />Chakra 4 -- Heart Chakra -- heart area<br />Chakra 5 -- Throat Chakra -- throat<br />Chakra 6 -- Third Eye Chakra -- forehead, between eyebrows<br />Chakra 7 -- Crown Chakra -- top of head, center<br /><br />May I suggest natural sweeteners, if you need a sweetener: honey, agave cactus nectar (natural food isle of food store), or unbleached brown sugar (in sugar isle of food store).<br /><br />This is also something different to share with friends, and of course, something special to talk about if you have New Age friends.

It is blended and packaged by Stash, so, if you are a tea-lover, you know it's good.  Stash makes a great full-bodied tea.  This one is a caffeine-free herbal tea.<br /><br />The ingredient blend is: hibiscus flowers, orange peel, ginger, chicory, damiana, peppermint, and natural dragonfruit flavor.<br /><br />This tea is labeled as "2nd Chakra," so it is intended for the Sacral Chakra (the one that has to do with sexuality).  According to the envelope, the damiana herb is said to enhance male and female sexuality, so there is the connection.<br /><br />For my metaphysical friends:  if this tea is also made with the "intention" of opening or stimulating the 2nd chakra (which I assume it is), that will be an added benefit.  The chakra teas are new and I have noticed they make one for each of the 7 major chakras.  I will be trying them all.<br /><br />(Note: I participated in a group meditation the other night and had combined a 2nd Chakra plus a 6th Chakra tea bag and drank the tea before and after. It was an excellent Violet Flame meditation session.  The combination of teas had a nice taste, too.

review/summary: very interesting smell and good taste
review/text: When you first open the envelope the smell (aroma) of the tea grabs you.  If your not use to strong herbal smells might be a turn off.  The taste is very pleasing and more mellow then the aroma.  I enjoy this tea and will purchase it again.

review/summary: Very Smooth
review/text: The Chanakara line is by Stash teas, an excellent tea company. Vanilla Honeybush is naturally sweetened with vanilla and orange peel with a scent of honey.  If you only use a light touch of sugar, you probably won't need any.  This is a caffeine free herbal tea.  You will probably want 2 tea bags to a 24 oz cup of hot water.<br /><br />100% natural ingredients in the order listed are: organic [African] honeybush, orange peel, safflower, and natural honey vanilla flavor.  Each tea bags is sealed in a foil envelope to keep the delicate flavour in tact.<br /><br />This tea is designed for the 3rd chakra (energy center) which is the solar plexus.  It is deliciously smooth and vanilla-y.  I have found that each of the Chanakara flavour has a very distinctive taste--quite different than other flavoured teas I have experienced, and I am a big tea drinker.<br /><br />If you want to use a sweetener, may I suggest natural sweeteners: honey (to complement the honey vanilla taste), agave cactus nectar (liquid-found in natural food section of grocery store), or unbleached brown sugar (next to the white sugar in the food store).

review/summary: Excellent Rooibos Tea
review/text: I am a big tea drinker--been so since childhood.  I appreciate a good-tasting, full-bodied tea and Stash has never let me down.  Being into Reiki and the energy stuff, I decided to try the Chanakara (Chakra) teas.  I have already tried the ones for the 2nd and 6th chakras.  Today I needed grounding, so I tried the 1st chakra tea.  Regardless of whether you are into metaphysical energy or not, this is a very nice tea.  Besides having the health benefits of organic antioxidant-rich South African rooibos, it also has a smooth taste with a slight sweetness (as red tea does) and a light fruity taste--very pleasurable.  It is caffeine free.  I did not add sugar but if you do, I suggest a natural product like agave cactus nectar (natural foods isle of grocery stores) or the unbleached brown sugar (in the sugar isle of grocery stores).<br /><br />Other ingredients listed on the package are: Rosehips, Hibiscus, Raspberry Leaf, Uva Ursi (soothing), Citric Acid, and Natural Strawberry Flavor.  The strawberry adds such a nice flavor to the mix.  Each tea bag comes in a sealed foil wrap to protect the flavors.  (I can still smell the tea in the empty package from about 11 hours ago.)  It claims to be a 100 % natural herbal tea.<br /><br />Note that it is very difficult to find a store selling these special flavors.<br /><br />BTW--if you don't know it already, the first chakra (energy center) of the body is the "Root" chakra, found at the base of the spine.  It's color is red (bright red if it is healthy).  It connects you with the earth so that you may be grounded and centered in your physical body.  Many of us believe that keeping our energy centers balanced helps us to stay physically healthy and emotionally strong.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: I bought this tea because I was looking for red tea (Rooibos) for its healthy properties and also because it is naturally caffeine free. This tea has a lot of antioxidants but does not taste healthy at all, it is more like a herbal tea when you want something sweet (I do not add any sugar to it). At the beggining I thought the taste was a little artificial, because in other flavored teas you cannot feel the fruit taste, but if you are looking for a flavored tea where you can really taste the other flavor, this is it. I love it and my 6 packages are almost gone.

review/summary: The best tea on earth
review/text: This tea (number 3 only, not other numbers necessarily) is the best tea on earth for instant stress relief. You can actually feel the stress disappear as you sip the tea. I have tried the other numbers in this brand 1-7 and although some of them do as they claim (benefit for each chakra) this is the best one, by taste and results. I give my neighbor a box every time I order bulk from Amazon. She is an elderly lady and loves this one too but not the others. You will not find a cheaper price for this tea and I bet it will go quickly because you will enjoy it so much. You only need one per day to get the lasting effects. Have fun and feel great. Thanks for letting me share.

review/summary: Not for everyone!
review/text: I like this tea a little better now that I've learned to brew 2/3 of a mug instead of a full mug.  The first cup I brewed was washed out and tasted vaguely of dirty water.  Brewing less lets me get the full flavor of the tea from a single bag.<br /><br />Dragonfruit is an exotic, colorful fruit I've had in Hawaii.  It tastes like nothing, if nothing tastes little bit like melon rind and vanilla pudding.  The lack of strong fruit flavor in the tea, then, isn't too surprising.<br /><br />You can find the dragonfruit flavor if you look for it, but it's a subtle rounding influence that binds the herbs and spices of the tea together and is nearly lost under the stronger orange peel flavor.  The top notes are the ginger and other spices that make this tea almost an herbal "chai remix," sans black tea.  Although there is no clove in the tea, the chicory and damiana do a good impersonation of it, but with a cost:  they impart more bitterness to the beverage.<br /><br />If you like chai and believe you would still like it without the nutmeg and other "pumpkin pie spices," and if you like a bit of bitterness in your lightly and naturally sweet herbal tea, this could absolutely be your favorite tea.  It isn't mine, but there's no accounting for taste.

review/text: This is a nice tea.  It is!  It's just not MY cup of tea, as the saying goes.<br /><br />I was surprised at how sweet it is, and had to check the ingredients several times in an effort to figure out where the sweetness comes from.  As other reviewers have commented, it tastes a little like artificial berry flavoring.  There are no artificial berry flavors listed, but that's what the tea tastes like!  "Natural strawberry flavor" must be some special kind of potent.<br /><br />I couldn't pick out the rooibos flavor, though I'm sure it's under the stronger berry flavor somewhere.

review/summary: Excellent Mild Ginger Tea
review/text: I love ginger from time to time, but many infusions can be a bit . . . punishing.  What can I say?  I'm a heat wimp when it comes to spices, but I still love ginger!<br /><br />This tea provides a delicious ginger flavor that can't be ignored without an overwhelming pepper note.  I agree with the other reviewer - the other ingredients in this brew can't be detected and identified individually by my untrained senses, but I think they work together to make a more mellow, rounded tea flavor with a sweeter scent.<br /><br />If you want to try a ginger tea that isn't too intense, this is absolutely the tea for you.

review/summary: Real Ginger Root/Caffeine Free/Herbal
review/text: Blended and packaged by the Stash Tea Company, makers of high-quality teas, this is tea for the throat chakra, also known as the 5th chakra, which relates to the color blue.  It is called "Blue Ginger".  (A chakra is an energy center in the body.  We are generally said to have 7 major chakras.)<br /><br />This caffeine free herbal tea is made of 100% natural ingredients (per the wrapper), listed in order as ginger root, blue malva flowers, vegetable juice for color and natural (tropical) feijoa flavor.  As do all the flavors, each tea bag comes sealed in an individual foil package to preserve the freshness and delicate flavor.  (If you are a tea lover, this matters to you.)<br /><br />The color is yellow.  Even with 2 bags for 24 oz water, the taste is smooth but weak with the bite of ginger.  You do taste the ginger in sufficient quantity, but it doesn't have any special other taste that I notice.  Although not one of my favorites, it will probably be useful for settling an upset stomach. (Note-I am NOT a doctor.)  Don't we usually go looking for ginger-ale for an upset stomach?  Well, if you check the ingredients, it's hard to find ginger listed in ginger ale anymore.  This tea has ginger as its primary (most plentiful) ingredient.<br /><br />So, it has an acceptable taste and is probably useful for calming the stomach.

review/summary: Smooth and Flowery/Fruity
review/text: The blends on the Chanakara (Chakra) teas are flavorful and quite different in taste from other teas I have found.  They are full-bodied teas from Stash and Stash makes good teas.  I have been a drinker of high quality teas all my life.  I find this tea very smooth and flavorful, with a flowery taste, almost a fruity blend.  You can definitely taste the chamomile. The other flavors just blend in.  Chamomile is very soothing, especially to the throat.  Many people drink chamomile teas before bedtime, to calm them.<br /><br />This caffeine free herbal tea is said to balance, tune, and energize. (It must mean the chakras, because it is calming.)  It is called "White Lotus".  Made of 100 % natural ingredients, they are listed in the following order: chamomile flowers, chrysanthemum flowers, lotus leaf, linden flowers, and natural lotus flavor.<br /><br />As with other Stash teas, each bag is individually sealed in a foil pouch to protect its delicate flavor.<br /><br />This tea honors the 7th Chakra (energy center of the body), which is the Crown Chakra (top center of the head).<br /><br />If you want to sweeten it, may I suggest natural sweeteners such as: Agave Cactus Nectar (in food stores--natural food isle) or natural brown sugar (in sugar isle).

review/summary: Great for a bagged tea, even better if the melon was stronger
review/text: I'm a total tea snob, drink mostly loose and hardly ever buy bagged teas (especially green) but I figured I'd give this one a shot: green tea is my favorite, melon is my favorite flavor/scent, and I love yerba mate's natural energizer properties.<br />I've also had a great experience with Stash products before (LOVE their green chai tea), so I figured why not.<br /><br />The tea is actually really good. The flavor and scent are very subtle. I know a lot of people prefer it that way, I just wish the melon came through more. There's no bitter aftertaste at all like some other yerba mate products tend to have. Overall, great tea.

review/summary: Select not for the taste...
review/text: My initial reaction, after trying a few flavors, was 'bleh!' and a solid 2-stars. After getting used to the flavors a bit more, I decided 3-stars was more appropriate.<br /><br />I love tea samplers, trying all these different flavors, typically there are a couple I don't care for and a couple I love. No so with the Chanakara sampler: I didn't like a single flavor.<br /><br />These are caffeine-free herbal teas that have more of a purpose than just being warm and tasting good; each flavor supposedly gives you some benefit. The strength of that benefit undoubtedly varies according to the person (I didn't notice anything).<br /><br />Each tea is packaged in nice two-colored package, telling what that tea is good for. On the tea box it has all the flavors, as well as a chakra chart telling you briefly about the 7 chakras. Each tea bag has the number corresponding to that chakra. (That was pretty interesting.)<br /><br />Missing from the box and the individual tea packages was any kind of brew time. I normally ignore brew times anyway, but I thought in this case perhaps I was brewing it incorrectly... I guess not. From watered-down to a cup of hot liquid seeped for 5 minutes, no matter the level of sweetener, I did not like these teas.<br />The tag on some of the tea bags just says `Chanakara for Mind, Body & Spirit' rather than telling you the type of tea.<br /><br />Red Berry Rooibos, an herbal tea for health & prosperity (Ingredients: Organic rooibos, rosehips, hibiscus, raspberry leaf, ova urea, citric acid, and natural strawberry flavor). I had this tea when I was sick. Didn't smell very good. Tastes like preserved strawberries, but weak. More sweetener didn't give it more flavor. On the other hand (when not sick), drinking it with dried mango made a good breakfast.<br />Vanilla Honeybush, an herbal tea for gathering strength & power (Organic honeybush, orange peel, safflower, and natural honey vanilla flavor). The tea bag smelled really nice, like a dessert, but the taste is icky. Almost like watered-down liquid cheerios.<br />White Lotus, an herbal tea for meditation & wisdom (Chamomile flowers, chrysanthemum flowers, lotus flowers, lotus flavor, and linden flowers). The tea bag did not smell good, but the tea smelled and tasted mostly like Chrysanthemum tea, and a bit like chamomile. It takes some getting used to, then it's not bad.<br />Melon & Green Tea, a tea for love & harmony (Organic green tea, orange peel, jerboa mate and natural melon flavor). Didn't smell very good. If you put a lot of sweetener it doesn't taste bad... but it doesn't taste good. Very dry.<br />Dragonfruit, an herbal tea for passion and creativity (Hibiscus flowers, orange peel, ginger, chicory, damiana, peppermint and natural dragonfruit flavor). If you've ever tasted a dragonfruit, you may find this to be not far off... it's not very good. Let it sit longer and it's OK.<br />Guanabana, an herbal tea for imagination & insight (Orange peel, rosehips, hibiscus flowers, lemongrass, eyebright, bilberry, licorice powder, vegetable juice for color and natural guanabana flavor). It's palatable, but not good.<br /><br />So, sadly, I didn't like a single flavor. I've enjoyed samplers such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQBZRE">Stash Premium Green Tea Sampler</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQID92">Stash Premium Herbal Tea Sampler</a>, which I recommend in lieu of the Chanakara tea.

review/summary: Better than PG Tips, But the Bags are Poorly Made. Variety Is a Must with Tea...
review/text: Best Tea I've had. I always look for variety packs. These have Decaff for late at night; and the white teas in them taste great IMO. However the Bags spew out tea leaves way too often. I could put a hammer to a PG Tip and the Bag won't likely break. I eat way to many tea leaves with these but if I have another PG Tip, I might have to blow chow.<br /><br />Tea these days is dirt cheap. Starbucks still charges a markup of over 90% on their teas. Tea is healthier than coffee and quicker to make if one uses a modern hot water dispenser. I am not sure why PG Tip are rated so high on Amazon reviews. I would give this a 4 star because of the quality/material of the tea bags. Everyone has their own opinion on tea. I am not a big fan of black tea. However, my 5 star rating tries specifically to even out those who rate their company's own product on Amazon.

review/summary: Great bread "substitute" for GF diets
review/text: I read about this product on a gluten-free web group, and decided to give it a try. My spouse is on a gluten-free diet, and really misses bread. To prepare the dough, you use the provided mix, two eggs, oil (I used olive) and milk or milk substitute (I used soy). You then roll out the dough in 1/2" diameter strips and bake for 25 minutes. The finished sticks come out looking like bread (browned, but not the dark brown characteristic of wheat flour bread), and smelling good. I tried a couple, and they were quite tasty; as close to "real" bread as I have had for gluten-free, crunchy outside, soft on the inside with a little bit of stickiness (a little like Japanese mochi, or sticky rice) which was unusual but not unpleasant. The onion & garlic flavor is there but very subtle. My spouse was pleased (ate a bunch) and I'm happy with the product.

review/summary: Best GF DF bread item I've made so far
review/text: Just made these last night.  (I used rice milk for the milk and wet flax meal in place of the eggs.)  I was expecting it to easily crack apart and be heavy and grainy like just about everything else I've made (bread, cookies, brownies, etc.) but it pulled apart like "real" bread!  They were also quite tasty.  Even my husband (who doesn't do GF/DF) agreed not only were they not bad, they were pretty good.  We used a little seasoned tomato sauce for dipping the bread, and it was great.  This is definitely going in to standard rotation.<br /><br />Prep took longer than I was expecting as the dough was not nearly wet and pliable enough from the amount of liquid I added at the begining, per the recipe.  Perhaps that was because of my flax sub.  Tapioca flour is lighter than air, and when I went to mix the initial liquid ingredients, it practically disappeared in there, and it seemed like all I was doing was mixing dry flour that danced out of the bowl and on to my shirt and counter.  It DID state to keep adding liquid a tsp. at a time until it formed soft dough - it just seemed to take quite a  bit more little additions of milk until I was able to make it all stick together.  It took some time to go from a bag of powder to something I could actually ball up, but it did happen and it was very good.

review/text: My mom introduced us to Chebe' mixes and we have been fans ever since! These are GREAT for those with allergies (esp wheat, etc).  It's really nice for our wheat-free family to be able to have bread again! They are a GREAT side dish to most anything!

review/text: This stuff is great.  My wife actually uses to to not only make breadsticks, but GF hamburger buns (two sort of "pancake" shaped buns - flatter than a normal hamburger bun but good), and hotdog buns by just wrapping the hotdogs in it and cooking them in the oven.<br /><br />Whether you need to eat GF or not, you'll love it.

review/text: Makes fantastic hot dog and burger buns that don't have to be toasted! Perfect for taking along on a pic-nic because they don't fall apart like GF bread usually does. I love all Chebe mixes.
