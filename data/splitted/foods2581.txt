review/summary: On the fence about this product
review/text: I tired it for the first time yesterday.  I bought the Blue Raz flavor. It is really awful tasting.  I felt a rush right after drinking it and within 20 min had to run to the bathroom because it really upset my stomach.  I will try in a few more times but I am honestly on the fench.

review/text: This product is a good product,  however the packaging or seal around the top lid was or seemed secure. But there was some leakage around the edge of lid as it was sticky and a little white powder around also. Didn't know how or want the hassle to try and return item. Probably should have though.

review/text: I take one scoop pre-workout as directed 1/2 hr prior. I start to feel a twitch within 20 min. & have tons of energy to fuel my 2 hr work-out no problem. The only downside is rogue granules of pepper that explode in your mouth 30mins after consumption. Not a big deal if you mix more throughly I guess. Grape flavor with no crash. I would definetly recommend to anyone who can tolerate caffine. :)

review/summary: FOCUSED O.O
review/text: Make sure you read the directions! I love this product because it helps me burn fat and left more weight as well. The best part about this Hyper is that it keeps me extremely focused. I highly recommended to people who just BE in the gym or WALK around in the gym. You can easily look focus and this product does the trick to make you stay focus. Not to mention, after awhile you might get use to the flavor and it will start tasting nasty, but make sure to change the flavor from Fruit Punch to Grape or vice-versa. You might thinking burn fat? Yes, because the product boost your temperature so you will feel hot and probably sweat more than usual. I try not to take this product for more than what is directed because I notice that my body will adapt to it, but other wise its really good.

review/summary: Works like any other PWO, except it made me want to vomit the entire time.
review/text: I've taken a handful of pre-workout supplements (it's my favorite category of fitness supplements), such as N.O. Xplode, NanoVapor, Jack3d, and 1MR, and this is the first time I've felt compelled to write a review about one, because this one is just really bad, in my experience.  With even just having half the recommended dose (on an empty stomach, with proper pre-workout nutrition and hydration...I know the PWO drill), I'm already swearing off this stuff.  It does nothing but make me feel sick to my stomach, and all I want to do is just drink water and NOT work out, lest I actually vomit while lifting.<br /><br />I'm dumbfounded by some of the overly positive reviews out there, but hey, to each his own, but this supplement is no good.

review/summary: Just what I wanted
review/text: Marzipan has always been my favorite treat, but it's not easy to find in this country. When my grandson expressed the same preference and his birthday approached, I knew what I wanted to get for him. And Google made it so easy, just a few clicks, and there they where, Marzipan to choose from. It's not easy to choose food by description alone, but reviews helped, and when it promptly arrived and tasted it, I was thrilled. And so was my grandson. The price is reasonable, and being packaged in six individual rolls, makes it easy to store and share. It's excellent marzipan. Since I'm a writer, and thinking requires calories, I now treat myself to some marzipan too. Roswitha Mcintosh

review/summary: Not the marzipan for the fine candy connoisseur
review/text: My intended purpose for this marzipan was to enjoy plain or chocolate dipped.  My first impression when tasting this product was that it is too sweet.  The almond flavor is there, but is secondary to the sweetener.  This is a cake decorating or cooking marzipan, which it appears from the packaging is actually the intended purpose.

review/summary: The best Mazipan out there
review/text: This marzipan is moist and delicious.  It tastes much better than the German brand ( in the red foil paper ).  I use it just as marzipan or in chocolate treats.  When rolling it out it is good to use a little bit of powder sugar to prevent it from sticking onto the rolling pin.  Because of it is not too dry you can re-roll it out if you are cutting out or needing to roll a thin layer for a cake.<br /><br />This is also the cheepest place to get the marzipan, it is about 5.50 to 6.50 a tube out in the market.

review/summary: tastes great straight from the tube!
review/text: Ever since I had my first taste of marzipan at the age of 4, I've been hooked. Each Christmas, I'd get a little tray of fruit-shaped marzipan - once a hotdog, etc. The foil wrapping inside the cardboard package helps to keep the marzipan soft enough to mold or eat. I chop out little 'coins' of the tube and drop into a bowl of strawberries, cantelope and creme - nice little confectionary add-on. I'm not much into sweets at all - but this is just the right flavor - almond and a hint of sugar without the overwhelming over-sweetened pre-made treats sometimes have.

review/summary: Very good tasting marzipan
review/text: I've tried many brands of marzipan and found this one great to eat plain or use in making cake decorations or candies. It has a nice, natural almond taste and isn't too sweet. It's soft enough to roll out or shape for making fruits or other decorations, but still holds its shape as it dries out. It stores well as long as you wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and a bag and also can be frozen up to 3 months. The 7 oz. tube is fairly small and I wish they made a larger size, but the multipack is a nice option for this reason. I'll be buying this brand again.

review/summary: Stay away if you expect the taste of real marzipan
review/text: If you've never had marzipan, you might perhaps like the hint of almond flavor in this item. But if you know what good marzipan tastes like, then<br />you'd do best to stay away from this. The paste tastes like cardboard, the good flavor is not there . For some reason, this product contains wheat, and that might account for the weak, cardboard-y flavor. Good marzipan uses organic almonds, sugar and rose water. It is also more expensive than this cheap imitation, and it tastes heavenly.

To me, this is what granola should be - big, crunchy clusters, lots of fruit, not too sweet, just a hadful of nuts. The ingredients list can't be beat, either - only whole, natural foods, ingredients you can pronounce, no GMOs, no HFCS, no refined sugars. Just tasty ingredients. The recloseable bag makes it so easy to just keep stashed in my bag to snack on throughout the day.

review/text: Be careful. The product picture shows a FULL jar of Celery Seed, but what I received was only about 75% full, so you are actually paying ~25% more for this product! :( The tamper seal on the jar was unbroken, so I have to assume that this is how it is packed, so why the picture of the full jar? The product is Marshall Creek Spices, and seems to be hit or miss, since I also ordered a jar of Pickling Spice that was a bit over 90% full.  So ok, some settling may occur, but 25%?  I think not!<br /><br />I have not used the product itself yet, so cannot speak as to quality, flavor, etc., but will update this review if there are any issues with it when I do use it.<br /><br />I have added a photo in the photo section to better show what I am speaking of.

Still edible, but oh, so annoying.  Had the cookies been packed or shipped to avoid damage I would have given this product 5 stars for their excellent flavor (mild peanut butter, good chocolate wallop) and sweet tooth satisfaction.

I find them a little dry and out of three boxes, (they come as 12 packs of two cookies in a box,) only the first came with the cookies intact. A lot of them were almost all crumble with very little cookie. But if you need to stay gluten free, then you would probably enjoy them anyhow.

review/text: Update 5/19/12: Enough of the crumbs already. Guess Pamela's has no interest in fixing the production. I'm canceling, there are better cookies.<br /><br />Update 3/20/12: My latest shipment arrived with no damage to the box, but some of the cookies were completely reduced to crumbs. Odd thing is in some cases a single 2-pack would have a whole or nearly whole cookie, and the other was totally crumbs. The manufacturer's production quality must be inconsistent, and it just takes a certain amount of shipment vibration to crumble the 'weaker' cookies. Odd thing is this is the first batch I've had that were so thoroughly reduced to tiny crumbs. Pamela's needs to tweak their manufacturing.<br /><br />Update 11/7/11: Ditto. Great product arrives intact. Keep shipping them in the display pack via USPS.<br /><br />Update 10/9/11: Ordered the 12 pack of 2 packs again, arrived in the same shelf display package, with intact cookies. Keep it up Amazon, this is working.<br /><br />Update 10/1/11: I took a chance and ordered another package. This one came in a long 'shelf display package', which was shipped USPS. If they stick to this packaging and shipping, I'll order these cookies regularly. So far every 2-pack has had whole complete cookies with minimal crumbs. Way to go, Amazon! I'll attach a picture under the 'customer pics'.<br /><br />Update 9/26/11: a second attempt resulted in larger cookie pieces, and one of the packages contained two whole complete cookies<br /><br />Original review: The 12 pack of 2-packs was delivered in a plastic bag. They must travel around Amazon in this fashion, and are reduced to crumbles as handled by Amazon. The bag was packaged in a large box along with a 6-pack of cereal boxes; there could have been more filler around the cookies bag, but I doubt it would help much if the cookie bag is tumbling around Amazon before shipment packaging.<br /><br />The cookies themselves were okay, not as good as nutter-butters. Can't really judge them as cookies when most all of them were broken. There were a few almost 'halves', but they were coated in crumbs. Some of the packages had melted chocolate. Basically you have to pour the packages out into a bowl and eat them with a spoon. I agree with the last reviewer, except, I'm willing to reorder in the future if Amazon can send a replacement shipment that arrives mostly or all intact.

review/text: I LOVE these cookies, but I have ordered them several times from Amazon, and EVERY time I get them, 80-95% of the cookies are broken.  They are not just broken in half, many are mostly just large crumbs ! Since they are a bit costly, and appear not to ever arrive intact, I will not be ordering them anymore. :(

review/summary: Tasty but Crumbly - Eat them with a spoon!
review/text: Like many have said, these cookies are really tasty.  I love the flavor.  I'm only rating 3 stars because I got six boxes and every box had approximately 75% of the cookies broken/crumbled.  The recipe abviously needs to be tweaked.  That being said, I too find it difficult to not eat a whole box in one sitting.  I eat them with a spoon! They'd probably be very good sprinkled over vanilla ice cream - gotta try that.  I love the flavor of these cookies, but hope that Pamela's fixes the recipe so they don't crumble in transit (or upon the first bite if you are lucky enough to get a cookie that is completely intact). I've tried several of Pamela's cookies and this is the only one that was COA (crumbs on arrival) :-)

review/summary: Surprisingly Yummy Cookies
review/text: To be fair, I should say that I haven't ordered these cookies from Amazon.com yet, so I can't speak for the condition they arrive in. I sampled them recently and was looking for an online source for family in another state.<br /><br />In any case, the cookies I tried were surprisingly delicious! I picked up a sample packet at a local health food store, and didn't have high expectations. I bake the vast majority of my own goodies, I'm a very experienced baker, and I don't normally eat gluten-free products. I was happily surprised to find that these had a good peanutty flavor, pleasantly crumbly texture, and lots of little chocolate chips. Unfortunately, I think that the crumbly texture is probably what makes these less than ideal for loose shipping.

Usually whole wheat flour has to be used in conjunction with AP flour because baked goods are too dense with just whole wheat. With this whole wheat pastry flour, you don't have to worry. It can have a more nutty flavor in crusts but it gets rave reviews from those eating the baked goods.

review/summary: Superior wheat IMO
review/text: I make homemade bread every other week. I decided to pick up this brand at a local market, instead of using King Arthur's flour like I normally do. It was Kosher, so I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />The flavor of the wheat is superior to any I've used. This flour is wonderful in honey wheat bread. The flavor it gives is so good, and my kids love it. I don't think I'm going to use any other wheat flour again. This is definitely worthy of it's reputation.<br /><br />I used 3/4 of the wheat flour, and 1/4 of organic bread flour, and the bread was awesome. I thought it would be really dense and heavy, but it actually came out lighter than expected without a heavy taste. You can only achieve that with high-quality wheat. Spring wheat is known to have more protein, so you can probably get by without the bread flour during the Spring and Summer months for your bread.<br /><br />Overall, I am so happy I found a high-quality flour that all of us can enjoy, while being able to receive the nutritional benefits of stone-ground wheat. It's relieving to accomplish both with one product, as it's hard to do this with 3 kids. But, they all loved it to my amazement. As did I.<br /><br />I think you'll be really happy with it.

review/summary: Superior for Bread Baking
review/text: "We use and believe in stone milling because no machinery has yet been developed that grinds grains into flours, cereals, and meals quite as well as the flint-hard quartz stones used by master millers since early Roman times." ~Bob's Red Mill Site<br /><br />The 100 % Stone Ground Whole Wheat Flour is my favorite flour for use in a variety of whole wheat bread recipes. It is all natural and doesn't contain any preservatives. You can use this flour for bread machine baking too and it produces superior results. I've used the recipe on the back of the bag and adapted it by using a mixture of whole wheat and regular bread flour because I didn't have any "gluten" as called for in the recipe. If you substitute 1 � cups of regular bread flour for part of the whole wheat flour you don't seem to need the gluten.<br /><br />Bob's Red Mill products remind me of my childhood when my father took me to the Graue Mill in Oakbrook, IL where we watched corn being milled. It is now the only operating waterwheel gristmill in Illinois. While Bob's Red Mill products don't arrive in a cloth bag, the paper bags do have an old fashioned feel and have a string-sewn closure. I love the crinkly sound of the high-quality paper bags.<br /><br />Bob's Red Mill uses slow turning, 100-year-old millstones to naturally grind together the bran, endosperm and germ that contains the nutritious oil. This is a "cool stone grinding process" which preserves nutrients normally lost in high-speed, high-heat milling.<br /><br />This company produces more than 400 products. Look for everything from hot cereals and mixes to flour milled from a wide variety of grains. If you love making natural breads in your bread machine, the flours are superior and produce deliciously nutritious breads.<br /><br />Whole Wheat Oat Rolls<br /><br />1 c. water, warmed to 110�F<br />5 T. fat-free milk powder<br />2 T. clover honey<br />2 T. salted butter, melted<br />2 1/2 tsp. active dry yeast<br />1 lg. egg<br />2 c. bread flour<br />1 c.

In an extra large bowl, mix the flour, whole wheat flour,<br />oats, wheat germ and salt. Stir in the yeast mixture.<br /><br />Place dough on a well-floured breadboard. Knead until smooth and elastic. Place in an oiled bowl, turn once, then cover with a damp cloth. Turn oven on to 200�F, when you can feel the heat on your hand, turn the oven off. Place bowl in the warm oven and let the dough rise until double.<br /><br />Punch the dough down and cut into 16 pieces. Form rolls then brush with melted butter. Sprinkle the tops of the rolls with the oats. Let rise for 45 minutes or until double then bake in a preheated 400�F oven 10-15 minutes or until lightly browned.<br /><br />Makes 16 rolls<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

I was on blood pressure and cholesterol meds and things were getting worse instead of better.  Macadamia nut oil and Coconut oil have worked better than olive oil for me.  It's not cheap but it works for me. I am also eating more and walking 5-7 miles at least 5 days a week and I eat several pounds of black beans a week along with lots of lean pork, beef, mixed vegetables and salad from my garden.

review/summary: Pure, Natural Cane Sugar
review/text: I have issues with most artificial sweeteners causing headaches and stomach problems. I'm not a fan of high fructose corn syrup either. So I'm back to natural cane sugar for sweetening things. I like the plastic storage container this sugar is stored in compared to the cellophane bags each pound in wrapped in by a competitor. However I'm not sure the plastic is the healthiest method.<br /><br />This cane sugar on sale usually is a cost effective option at around fourteen bucks but still more expensive than plain old granulated sugar at the local store some of which is cane or beet sugar. I'm not sure if my sugar-gobbling kids were always at home I'd be buying this... 10 pounds every two weeks with them vs 10 pounds a year for me. Although most times I drink my teas and coffees without sugar, when I do crave something sweet adding a spoonful or two hits the spot and seems to last forever. Just do your comparison shopping as there are some WILD price ranges.

review/text: I am so glad that I have found Taste of the Wild. This dog food is made by Diamond, which is a well know, good quality dog food. Taste fo the Wild is a grain free formula for all life stages. I've been trying for a year now to find a good quality dog food that won't break my bank. I tried Nutro Max, Nutro Ultra, Nature's Recipe, and even the highly claimed Canidea (which he did not do well on at all). I found Taste of the Wild (among other high quality foods) at a local feed store. I placed 5 different high quality dog foods down, and even his current dog food, to see which one he would go to first. He went to the Taste of the Wild first and went between this and another brand. What really got me was that my parents' very picky pomeranian went straight for this food, and ate it without wet food on it!<br /><br />So I brought Taste of the Wild home and have been switching it, slowly, over. PLEASE make sure when you switch your pet's food you mix it slowly and gradually over time or else your pet may get an upset stomach.<br /><br />Overall he's doing much better. His coat is shiner, he has more energy, and he gobbles up the food. Taste of the Wild costs about as much as some name brand foods at Petsmart and is a much better quality food. Email them and they will send you samples so you can have your dog try it.

review/summary: Great food, good price
review/text: We've been feeding Taste of the Wild (TOTW) to our puppy for 6 months. He is thriving on it. We have tried the Salmon and Lamb with tons of success but the Fowl was a little too high in protein for his young body and gave him some loose stool. While we haven't tried the Bison, I would assume that would be the case as well since they're similar in their guaranteed analysis. If you're shopping for a younger dog, I'd stick with the Lamb or Salmon formulas for now. All of the formulas are all life stage (ALS) foods so they can be fed from weaning puppy to senior pet. I can do nothing but sing this food's high praises. Not only does my dog LOVE this food, but it is affordable, grain-free, and has good ingredients. I have yet to buy this food on Amazon.... I just don't understand the extreme mark up on the Lamb formula ($58). It is available locally at many pet food stores and at Tractor Supply (on sale usually for $37.99, best price that I've seen!) If you're looking for a new food, this is one that you should definitely try.

review/summary: Great single protein dry dog food
review/text: My dog has alergies to some proteins (chicken and beef) and for the past year, I have been trying different brands of food with single proteins.  During that time, I tried her on the TW Salmon, and she ate a bag or two and quit.  I did notice, however, that when she was on the TW food, her stools were perfect and her coat was like velvet, so I was sorry she stopped eating it.  Last month, I went into the pet store and was so happy to see this new single protein flavor from TW.  We are on our 3rd bag of TW Lamb, and she loves it.  Had her bloodwork done last week and the vet said it was beautiful.  Thank you TW for a great product, and finally one that has a single protein.  I wish you would do the same with the venison so she could have some variety.

review/summary: Exceptional product and results!
review/text: Exceptional noticeable results! Have used Taste of the Wild Lamb for 4 weeks. All six dogs(an Aussie, Standard Poodle, Minature Poodles, and Chinese Cresteds) have experienced improved teeth/gums, coat/skin, digestion, alertness and energy.  The 'quality' dry food(s) used prior are no match for the improved quality of life for my animals! An Aussie breeder introduced the food to me but I was unable to locate it locally.  I ordered the first bag online and my local feed store now carries it. Our pets depend on us to provide their quality of life/health. I thought I was doing that until I tried Taste of the Wild Lamb.  Intend to try their cat food on my Sphynx cats to see if the same results improve their life.  This is the first time I have ever experienced such a noticeable difference in dry food and seen such results. Thank you Carol of Lorac Aussies! We would have never known the difference had you not introduced us to Taste of the Wild! Truly an exceptional quality product!

review/summary: Still Too Much Fat, But Less Than Some Flavors...
review/text: Tried this, recently, (in all dry flavors) for my German Shepherd Dog. At first, he wouldn't touch it, but after about a week, he decided he absolutely loves it. The biggest problem is within the first month, he had gained 3 pounds, even though he was eating less than the recommended amount and less than he was previously used to eating. Also, he had soft, oily looking stools while eating this. He is an active, very healthy, well-exercised, older dog. He did seem to be more "chipper" and health-wise, he seemed to do fine, except for the softer stools and weight gain, but reluctantly, we had to stop feeding this, exclusively, as we were feeding less and less and he was still gaining weight AND seemed hungry all the time, looking for any other food to eat. Since he loves the taste so much, we have decided to give him only a cup or so a day, in his Kong, with his other food or as training treats and have switched him to another food. I'm not sure I agree with the "good for all life stages" philosophy either. In the old days, that was what one did, but now that we know much more about nutrition, I believe that different life stages do require different nutrient levels. Much as humans do. Sadly, for our dog, this can not be the only food he eats, but it will remain a part of his daily diet, since he loves it and did well, except for the fat content. Nice to have a new flavor for variety.  Hope this helps!

review/summary: Best dog food of all!
review/text: With the past 17 years of owning dogs I have gone through several types of dog foods for all my dogs. I currently have a 10 year old Labrador Retriever and a 4 Year old Bloodhound, both females. Mia (our bloodhound) has always had big problems with yeast infections in her ears due to allergies. We have tried 4 different foods for her trying to get rid of her problems. One of these foods was Blue Buffalo grain free duck flavor dog food, she still had her ear infections and her coat was quite greasy and off came a white residue and her stool was runny after about a month on the food straight when it was not mixed with her other food. So it wasn't helping at all, only making it worse. But then I heard about TOTW and I saw it was grain free and we went and got a small bag to try  it out. Figuring out later she loves this flavor best and less calories without the fish. It's now been a 1 1/2 year/s and those $100 yeast infections in her ears are nearly gone. We haven't been to the vet for that in so long. It's an excellent food that keeps both of my dogs healthy. My 10 year old lab tends to gain weight more but she is as healthy as she ever has been and active. I strongly recommend this brand of dog food. I'm very impressed about the outcome that is has on my very active dogs. Keeps them a healthy weight.

review/summary: Found this through a local pet store
review/text: I was getting Authority Lamb through Petsmart online because I moved and there isn't one near me.  It wasn't cheap with the shipping and not so cheap even without, but my 20 pound shelter dog was doing well on it, so.... Well, I ordered two bags of Authority, one a few months ago and one recently, both came poooorly packaged and were battered and I got a refund on shipping.  BUT this last batch had BUGS in it!  I didn't notice at first, must have been larvae, but opened up my dog's vittles vault today (only put in there about a week ago) and see bugs crawling in it and the vittles vault had been securely closed. (but as the bag and box got here battered, I'm sure it was a bug buffet before even reaching me).  Needless to say, didn't want to feed to my dog and found a pet store open near me on a Sunday and they recommended this brand (my dog has a bit of a sensitive tummy and does best on lamb).  He loves it!  AND it's really quite comparable in price AND packaged so much better than Authority.  It also has a much sturdier bag to keep nasty things out until I can get it home and put in a vittles vault.  This will be my dog's dry food from now on.

review/summary: Fantastic dog food!
review/text: I came across this at tractor supply originally and looked it up on dogfoodanalysis.com.  It's rated very well and so I decided to pull the trigger.  The food smells like most kibble.  The pieces are small, so you could feed it to a small dog or a big dog.  My dogs absolutely love it.  Their coats have become so soft since we switched them on this food.  They don't poop a whole lot compared to cheaper foods because there is less filler and more nutrition.  I highly recommend this food as the dogs love the taste, it's good for them and their health and coats have greatly improved since switching them to it.

review/summary: Don't know why I ever stopped feeding this.
review/text: We started feeding the Taste of the Wild Salmon formula to my dog when she was a puppy. For some reason, she wouldn't eat it anymore so we began our long (about 8 months) journey to find the perfect dog food for her. We finally found Canidae and while it's a good quality food, she started having digestive problems with it because of the grains or because there were too many proteins, I'm not sure. She had disgusting yellow, mushy poop that was impossible to even pick up. Finally, I felt too bad for her to even continue feeding the rest of the bag, so I went back to Taste of the Wild. This was definitely the best decision. Literally after two feedings, her poop started looking normal again. I can tell she feels better too. She absolutely LOVES the taste as well. Love this stuff!

review/text: I've switched back and forth between TOTW, Prairie, and Blue Buffalo for the past sixteen months or so, with an older shepherd mix and now a puppy goldendoodle.  Really, the only reason I've switched is because this brand is still hard to find in some stores and I don't always plan well enough to use Amazon!  I'm very, very pleased with the food because of the ingredients and price-per-kibble.  Very underestimated food.  I do, sometimes, have to mix some wet food in it for a finicky dog, but I can live with that.

review/summary: Not a favorite at our doghouse
review/text: I purchased Taste of the Wild with roasted lamb along with two other Taste of the Wild flavors as a variety treat for my two dogs (51 and 75 lbs). Used solo, the food set in the dish for a couple of days until I mixed it with another brand (C&P). I then started filling their dishes with half and half and noticed that they would always eat the other brand first and then finally come back and eat the ToW lamb as a last resort.<br />We have not tried the other two ToW flavors yet, but hopefully, they will like them better.

review/summary: This Has Cost Me $437. At The Vet In Less Than 2 Months
review/text: I changed my dog from "California Natural Lamb & Rice" to this because the California Natural caused him such constipation and weight gain. I have made a gradual transition in foods, and over 2 months have only gotton him to 60% 'Sierra Mountain Taste of the Wild' because he has developed such severe bloody diarrhea that has landed him in doggie hospital 3 times in the last 6 weeks. The vet kept wanting to put him back on Science Diet, but I had taken him off of that corn based dogfood in the first place because it destroyed the health of my dogs, with all of them having developed very early serious health issues. And, their eyes were dull and dead looking long before they even developed cataracts, so I certainly do not want him back on that stuff.<br /><br />I must say that 'Sierra Mountain Taste of the Wild' has given my dog bright shiny eyes and his lab testing (according to the vet) is some of the best she has ever seen - EXCEPT  THAT suddenly he has quite advanced kidney disease, and he has  again developed very thin hair (as he had on Science Diet) and to boot has had the severe intestinal issues  from the 'Sierra Mountain Taste of the Wild'.<br /><br />It has reached the point that it has entered the picture of putting my dog down because he was so ill and in misery for so long. The vet has looked at numerous issues that could cause his rectal bleeding (both with normal stools and with his very frequent severe diarrhea), but the only thing that comes up is that it has to be a food issue.<br /><br />I am going to quickly transition him back to the "California Natural" and get him off of this before he dies from being on `Sierra Mountain Taste of the Wild`. Then I will do some research of what food I can put him on / or mix with the "California Natural" so that he doesn't have the weight gain and constipation that food caused. But, even if he has constipation and weight gain it sure beats the absolute misery he is going through with 'Sierra Mountain Taste of the Wild'. This stuff has been a disaster for his system!<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /> I put him straight back on 'California Natural', and within a day or so his bowel issues completely cleared up, and have not returned. So it (was) the 'Sierra Mountain Taste of the Wild' dogfood that caused his problems.<br /><br />I initially thought it cost me about $250. in the past 6 weeks, but I got a tally of all the bills from the vet, and it actually cost me $437.

If SoH sold the honey mustard they coated these pretzels in, they'd make so much money they wouldn't know what to do with it. These honey mustard pretzels are really that good. My only problem is that once I open the bag, all the pretzels are gone (I inhale them). Damn them for being so tasty!<br /><br />And finding them on Amazon is a steal, as these sell for $3 plus; you can just subscribe and save, and then oh-so-slyly, unsubscribe. You save $9 doing this, rather than buying 12 of these at $3 a pop at the supermarket. That makes this snack all the more satisfying. &lt;3

Buying them in bulk like this has saved me a lot of money versus buying them one or two at a time from the grocery store, and the free shipping to my door is a wonderful perk.<br /><br />I do wish there was a little more seasoning on the pretzels, something between these nibblers and the "pieces" would be my ideal amount of seasoning, but that would add to the fat content. Other than that, I don't have any complaints.

review/summary: As good as factory pretzels get
review/text: There's no way to package soft "street" pretzels in a bag you keep on the shelf(though they do come frozen).  For handy salty snacks, the factories have made so-called "hard pretzels" for decades, and these are the best.  The proper blend of sweet and salt, blandness and tart, they hit the spot.  As a snack, their only handicaps are that they are very hard(only original teeth please), and they are very salty(they deliver a "wallop" of saltiness that potato chips just don't, due to the fact that their salt is on the surface and concentrated in large salt grains.)  But if you like old timey pretzels like they used to sell in the general store or your local bar, these are for you.

review/text: I have 2 Shih Tzus and they are the pickiest dogs on the planet when it comes to treats and bones.  I found these and WOW!  They FIGHT over them!!!  They LOVE the filling and actually dig it out and eat it first (somehow) and THEN eat the rawhide!  They carry them everywhere, even to bed, and one just likes to hold it in her mouth forever until she is ready to eat it.  I would recommend this Bone to anyone!

review/summary: Best Root Beer Barrels around.
review/text: I can't stop eating these things.  They're awesome.  I get them at a local candy store called Rocket Fizz.  A lot of root beer barrels can be too spicy or weird tasting.  These are perfect.

review/summary: Powerful sauce!
review/text: Great flavoring for any dish.<br />Lots of compliments on the flavor when used in cooking.<br />Good to throw in when you do not know what else to use or do not have much on hand.<br />Originally bought it in New Orleans and could not find it locally.

review/summary: Great little cakes
review/text: Great like cakes from Ferrero, I grow up eating those and every time I go in Italy I find the fridge full of them, thanks to my mom....<br /> the shipping was fine, perfect condition, not melted, a little expensive but hopefully if people like me keep and buying them the price eventually will go down.<br />For the people they never tried Fiestas , you need at least once, there is nothing like them in the States and they are very addicting because of the liquor cake inside...

review/summary: delicious
review/text: These cakes have a flavor not available in the USA.  I believe it is from the chocolate alcohol.  Reason for the 3 stars is that it is overpriced; but, it is a must try product.

review/summary: Good Product but too high of a price!
review/text: I love these orange cakes but I think they're overpriced. We can always get away with Nutella instead ... Maybe if more people buy it they could drive the price down.

review/summary: not bad!
review/text: Ok, to be fair, I bought this at the store, but I suppose that doesn't matter in the long run. See, I ran out of the water enhancer that I normally use and happened to see this close by. It was cheaper than the generic mio I was going to buy, so I figured what the hey and bought it.<br /><br />Instead of mixing a packet in a 16.9 oz bottle, I mix it in a 1 ltr bottle. Two in my bottle made it almost taste like peach-mango juice. I find 1 per 1 ltr bottle works well enough to cover the "flavor" of the water. I also happen to like that it's fortified with vitamins AND caffeine.

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: I purchase the strawberry version of the Crystal Light Energy line usually, but decided to give peach mango a try.  It was very good!  I drink this stuff everyday, and having a different flavor was an excellent change.  120 mg of caffeine per packet, and all the water you can drink.  No more of that canned energy crap for me!
