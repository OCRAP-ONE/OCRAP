It was difficult to stop eating them.  I use these in cookie recipes, on salads, on steaks, on PBJ sammies, in yogurt. These guys did an awesome job with this product, especially for the price. You will not be dissapointed.

review/summary: Natural Muscat Grape Flavor...
review/text: Bonne Maman has done it again - captured the natural flavor of the fruit.  In the case of Bonne Maman Grape Jelly, the muscat grape flavor is so true that you almost feel you are using jelly Grandma made.  The color of this jelly is a reddish-purple; it is a clear, fresh hue - exactly like that of the muscat grapes from which it is made.  The consistency is not so firm that it does not spread easily, but not so runny as to flow off the sides of your bread/toast.<br /><br />I have found Bonne Maman Grape Jelly at our local grocery stores.  It sells there for $3.49 - $3.99 per 13 ounce jar; I have not yet seen it in some of the off-price retailers who generally stock a limited supply of Bonne Maman products.<br /><br />If you are tired of the grocery store concord grape jellies which taste like sugar and little else, I recommend you try Bonne Maman Grape Jelly.  It has a natural, true grape flavor and is worth the extra cost.  I hope Bonne Maman will expand their product line further and introduce a concord grape jelly/preserve.

review/text: I bought this coffee at a local store.  It is truly the worst coffee I have ever had.  I first noticed the flavor was almost like burned plastic.  When I poured it out it looked pale, not dark. There were big pieces of what looked like pieces of grass or wood.  It had almost no aroma, but the bag was not broken.

After it's cooked (about 30 to 45 minutes), I add yogurt to the bottom of the serving bowl, pour in the soup and mix. The yogurt helps to enhance the other spices. I sometimes add salt to this soup.  Yum!  It really is a favorite in my home.  If you love soups...try it.  You'll be pleasantly surprised at how good it is.

review/summary: VARIETY PACKS - THINGS TO KNOW
review/text: While variety packs sound like a good idea, you should be aware that there is a reason you usually aren't told exactly what's in it. It's because almost always, the vendor throws in a bunch of flavors, blends, teas, and decafs that are not usually what you want. It can be a waste of money for most.<br /><br />A much better solution, besides sampling a friends K-cup favorites, is to go onto the Keurig site ( http://www.keurig.com/KCupResults.asp?AllProducts=AllProducts&mscsid=HGR8G81WMFQB9NS0DN0EH4MKJREN8UAF ) and buy their low cost 5 packs. They usually cost under $3 and give you enough coffee to help decide what you might like. Plus, you'll know exactly what's in the smapler before you buy it.<br /><br />It is also a great idea to visit the K-Cup Exchange on Yahoo http://groups.yahoo.com/group/K-CUP/  This site is an excellent source of K-Cup info and allows you to trade unwanted k-cups, and talk to others to find the best deals and brewing tips.

review/summary: Where's the coffee?
review/text: I too was shocked that a third of the k-cups in this product were tea or lemon beverages.  Foolish me -- when I order a product called "Timothy's World Coffee K-Cup Variety Pack," I actually expect it to contain a variety of COFFEE k-cups. Having to order a minimum of two boxes from Amazon only compounded the problem.<br /><br />I am giving this product one more star than it otherwise deserves because when I called the company to complain, they did send me one free box of just coffee k-pods. However, the combination of deceptive labeling and having to throw away a third of the contents of the box unused makes this a poor product choice in my opinion.<br /><br />If this product contained only coffee k-pods, I would probably order it again because the coffee k-pods actually in it were pretty good, but I certainly don't recommend it now.

review/summary: A very good sampler if you are giving a Keurig as a gift
review/text: It's hard for me the believe this myself but so far I have given 8 Keurig coffee makers away (five model B40s, two B60s and two B70s) as gifts and I always give this sampler to go along with the k-cups included with the machine.  I feel that it includes a very good selection of coffees and teas.  If someone does not like a particular beverage (some people NEVER drink tea for instance) the recipients have found that they can keep them on hand for guests.  This does not include all of my favorites but it does have a very good mix.  Here are some of the most popular:<br /><br />Hazelnut:  I don't know why but most of the women in my family (and many  of the men) LOVE this one.<br />Rain Forest Espresso:  If a person likes a full bodied coffee then this could be the one for them.<br />Breakfast Blend:  A milder, medium blend that a lot of people enjoy.<br />Chinese Green Tea:  This is becoming more and more popular in the US and my friends who drink tea like this K-Cup.<br />English Breakfast Tea:  A classic.<br /><br />And the not-so-popular ones:<br /><br />Italian Hot Lemon Beverage:  I have personally never met someone who liked this one.  I am sure that someone does, just no one that I know.<br />Italian Blend:  I usually like an Italian coffee but this one is not popular with my friends, family and guests for some reason.<br /><br />There are others in this pack but in my experience these are the ones that the people in my life usually love and the ones that they avoid.

review/text: I'm not what most people would call a coffee drinker. I love an occasional cup but I don't have to have coffee everyday. Being able to brew a single cup at home using my Keurig Brewer instead of running to St@rbuck$ saves a bunch of money. Timothy's World Coffee is some of the best tasting coffee around. I prefer the rich bolder blends. I got the variety pack, as it allows me to taste different kinds and find out what I like and what I don't. My shipment came very quickly and was well packed. I have been enjoying my occasional cup of java a bit more often since it arrived.<br /><br />I do wish they would leave out the teas they included. I want coffee not tea. In addition, if I wanted decaf I would have ordered decaf. They could have left the decaf out too. Otherwise its a pretty good mix.

review/summary: Good but ... Timothy's needs a coffee-only variety pack
review/text: The box contains a true cross-section of coffee types, from flavored types to darkest roast. The Rainforest Espresso was a favorite dark roast, and the Columbian Dorado was the ideal medium roaster (IMO). Others in my family have different tastes though, so your mileage may vary as well.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, the heavy presence of teas included here, raised the cost-per-cup significantly. Nobody in our home likes hot teas, and although I did get one good iced-tea conversion, the effort expended removes convenience from the picture.<br /><br />Bottom line: Timothy, you need a coffee-only variety pack!! Maybe one with some more varieties in addition to the coffees already there. I would then rate the score upward to a 5. As it is, the ever-present frustration of seeing those darned teas in there, takes some of the fun out of deciding which K-Cup to brew next.<br /><br />Just a closing thought - Big Cat Coffees offers a build-your-own box of five selections (including Timothy's), which IS very useful, but not much different in price.

review/summary: RIP-OFF Only 20 per Box!
review/text: I love Timothy's coffee and have purchased their K-cups several times.  Just for the heck of it, I decided to count the K-cups when I opened the box.  The first box only contained 20 k-cups (despite the fact that the box and Amazon listing said that it would contain 22).  I opened the second box--and I got the same thing, ONLY 20 K-cups! Each box was shorted by 2. That's almost 2 dollars worth of product. Ridiculous! I called Timothy's Coffee to complain. I haven't heard back from them, yet.  I will update when I do.<br /><br />I have another package of K-cups coming.  You better believe I will be counting those as well!<br /><br />**Update: Amazon customer service was great.  They sent me two more boxes, both of which contained the advertised number of K-cups.  Maybe the first set of boxes I got were a fluke, maybe not.  Either way, I'll be counting them from now on.

review/summary: One of my favorite variety packs to date
review/text: I've had my keurig brewer for a few years now yet I've not had a chance to sample several of the varieties included in this pack. I especially loved getting to try the Kahlua (pass), Italian Blend (interesting), Kona (not as good as I expected), and Parisian Nights (definitely will buy) since those have piqued my curiosity for a long time. I just never wanted to order four dozen of each of those k-cups at a time. I was also curious on how well tea works in K-cups and have decided I will stick with Stash bags for now. This is a great way to find your favorite k-cups without buying box after box. It's also great to have for guests so they can have some variety to suit their palates. I wish all of the companies that make k-cups would do this.

review/text: *Previous lists don't mention the French Vanilla, which was incl.<br /><br />I've enjoyed quite a few varieties of Timothy's (and others)K-Cups and had little to no problems with them. Cinnamon Pastry is one example of a coffee I really enjoy.<br /><br />This variety pack however seems to be a mix of their least popular blends, or perhaps the batches that were slightly "off". And going off this experience I won't be trying any of the coffees in the pack on their own except for the Kona & Breakfast blends.<br /><br />The tastes were dark (burnt), bitter and unappealing, each cup made me regret my choice to reach for the coffee mug. Not to mention the after effects were not pleasant, I actually could feel the crappiness of these blends for hours.<br /><br />The French Vanilla was downright disgusting, I don't think they could decide if they wanted to make a soft vanilla flavor  or a strong vanilla liquor experience and it's a horrible mix of the two.<br /><br />Also, as previously mentioned, nearly half the box is NOT coffee but tea's that sound... more interesting than appealing.<br /><br />So if you're in for an adventure and don't really care about the taste of your coffee or tea, go for it!<br /><br />Otherwise... consider sample packs directly through the coffee company, they cost less and give you better options.

review/summary: Good for a variety
review/text: Being new to the K-cup world, this variety was a good introduction to the flavors out there.  However, my husband uses it mostly, gravitating to the strong flavors and there are no decaf drinkers in the house - so we are waiting for guests to comment on those.

review/summary: Nice variety but no hot cocoa
review/text: I decided to try this variety pack, as I needed an assortment and it seemed my only option. It contains a nice variety of teas and coffees, but I was disappointed that there wasn't any hot cocoa. I don't really want to buy a whole box of cocoa but maybe that's my only choice. I'd like to see a variety pack of just teas or teas and cocoas but no coffee. Also, it would be nice if the amazon description told you what would be in the variety pack. I like Timothy's K-Cups very much.

review/summary: I didn't care for this pack
review/text: 1st off, this is what is in the box:<br /><br />Two of each per 24 pack:<br />-Parisian Nights extra bold<br />-Italian Blend<br />-Kona Blend<br />-Breakfast Blend<br />-Decaf Colombian<br />-Colombian Dorado<br />-Rainforest Expresso extra bold<br />-Hazelnut<br />-Chai Tea<br />-English Breakfast Tea<br />-Green Tea<br />-Lemon drink<br /><br />I bought this so my husband could try the teas (he is not a coffee drinker).  I paid about $.33 per K-cup which is a good price, however I thought the coffees were not that great.  I prefer the Green Mountain brand and I suspect for me, it will be worth it to pay a little more for them.

I also liked that it wasn't one of each flavor (especially since there was two boxes) so that you could try them a couple of times to be sure that you enjoyed what you were getting or not.<br /><br />I noticed a lot of people stated that there was a plastic taste to their beverages after having these. I have not noticed a plastic taste in the ones that I have tried so far. I'm wondering if older ones that have been stored for longer may get this plastic taste?<br /><br />Someone else said that the Timothy's products had poor seals and would leak coffee grounds all over in the pot and into the drinking vessel when they were being used. I'm not sure if this is linked to a certain Keurig coffee pot or not but mine, the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee pot does not do this. I have also not noticed poor sealing in this cups either.<br /><br />I have also enjoyed the flavors that I have tried so far and I can't wait to try more of them.

It would be a much better offering if there was a lot more variety.

review/summary: Great Coffee and Variety, but includes Tea and Decaf
review/text: As many other reviews have mentioned, there is not a clear description of what is included in the box. I will not bother to repost the lists others have made, however I can say the variety is MUCH greater than the Gloria Jean's or Green Mountain Coffee variety packs I've tried (both of which include only Four blends of coffee), which is a definite plus. And I always set my Keurig to the smallest cup-size setting and feel this is the right level for maximizing the flavor of each k-cup - haven't tested how these taste with larger cups. Good brand overall, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Be sure to know that this package includes both TEA and DECAF COFFEE - you will be sorely disappointed if you're left with those at the end of the box because you didn't want them in the first place.

review/summary: coffee variety
review/text: Loved the variety of flavors to try before committing to a full box of a single coffee flavor. I found a new favorite that I will be reordering. I would have liked it more if the description gave you all the flavors in the box. Think they should have more flavors in the pack. Thanks Amazon for the fast delivery and high quality customer service.

review/summary: Good Coffeee!
review/text: I have always wanted to try Timothy's Brand Coffee. And decided as a gift I could sample as well as my co-workers. And so I bought this box of 24 for us. Everyone one was very delighted with this variety pack. We will no doubt order again!<br />It is a great cup of K-Cup coffee!

review/summary: k kups
review/text: I love the coffee's in this assortment, but it also included too many decaf and tea varieties that I was not expecting.  There were also these "lemon drinks" that I have never seen before and don't like very much.  To top it off there were 2 kkups missing from the 48 that should have been there.  Next time I will order one flavor that I like the best instead of this.

review/summary: 'Not enough, too much, too weak, thats wierd'
review/text: All of those thoughts will go through you head once you get this pack.<br /><br />Go with the Green Mountain coffees. And go with bolds. Even if you like lighter coffees. These k-cups have a hard time delivering on larger water sizes (not all types do.) There is some not very good stuff in this pack... It would be great if they sold with just one of each so you could quickly figure out what you wanted without having a lot left over.

review/text: It took them a few days to fill my order but once it was filled it arrived the next day. Came in small plastic bag which was flat due to shipping. Had my pots and soil ready to go so planted them right away. Perked up the same day and I have new growth in just one week. They shouldn't even be surviving in my climate zone(North West AZ, its been 110 in the shade the last few days) but seem to be doing ok. Only get alittle morning and evening sun, full shade rest of the day. Please do your research about these plants, very toxic, I planted with surgical gloves to protect my hands from possible sap. Can't wait for my flowers to bloom.

review/summary: Whatever this tastes like it isn't a chocolate chip cookie
review/text: I'm trying to figure out what it is that tastes so very peculiar and unpleasant in these cookies. Could it be the soy flour? In any case, I get no taste of chocolate chips at all. Zero. Zilch. They might as well have left that out of the name. The texture isn't bad. It's crunchy and not overly gritty. But there are better gluten-free snacks out there. I hope.

They are small in size, but are the best tasting chocolate chip cookie so far that we have found gluten-free.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I was so excited to find these in our local Whole Foods.  I loved the fact that they came in individually wrapped packages (great  for travel, lunch boxes, etc).  Unfortunately, the taste was quite disappointing.  The cinnamon flavored ones were even worse.  Neither myself, nor my youngest liked either of them.  Granted, we are both somewhat picky when it comes to store-bought cookies.  I'd have loved to have given them to my oldest son (who has a real sweet tooth and likes most GFCFSF cookies I buy), but they have both soy and corn in them and he is allergic to soy and corn in addition to gluten and dairy.  Fortunately, I hadn't bought them in bulk on Amazon ...  I was surprised to see that they got such good reviews.

review/text: This is a very delicious curry, and I loved the unique flavor it gave my eggs. It is spicy but you can adjust that to your taste. Went very well with basmati rice! The curry flavor overpowers the egg, but that is not a bad thing because it's so good! It tastes pretty much like any other Parampara curry though. I guess if you wanted to try out the recipe, you could add the eggs to any of the other Parampara curries, or even a generic red curry that you can make at home.

review/summary: good, but not great
review/text: When I first started to buy VitaGravy, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get it in their kibble every day, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it because of its beneficial nutritional value and decent price compared to a pill vitamin supplement. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of VitaGravy, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining.

review/text: About a year ago, Newman's Own Organics changed these cookies.  While the list of ingredients did not change, the taste clearly changed so I suppose something changed in the process.  They became a little thinner and the taste is totally different.  The old version tasted much, much better.  I don't know what they were thinking.  These cookies are still pretty good, but the old version was great and I wish they would fix this mistake.
