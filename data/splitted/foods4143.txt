review/text: When I saw these in the store I got one bag.  Then I thought "if these are any good at all I better get more".  So, I bought 2 bags.  In less then 24 hours both bags are empty.  They are fabulous and I'll be buying them as long as they sell them.  That means I have to make sure and get out and walk every day to help off set the calories.  It'll be worth it.<br /><br />No need to hesitate on buying them unless you're afraid you won't be able to leave them alone and you don't want to eat all those calories.  I look at it this way:  YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL ENJOY IT WHILE YOU CAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I have to buy them when I see them as I live in a very small town and they don't sell them here.  I'm sure I'll be a regular buyer through Amazon.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon for allowing other companies to sell through your site.<br /><br />Aria<br />A very satisfied customer.

review/text: My grandmother used to bring these every Christmas for me and my siblings. We'd devour them in a matter of hours and I would always want more. She passed away recently and finding these here makes me miss her, but I will be eating these in her honor.<br /><br />They have a delicious icing on the outside and an even better inside, which consists of a gingerbread cake-like bread. The two flavors mix unbelievably well. Pfeffern&uuml;sse translates to "Pepper nuts", but even with the name, most of these German cookies are not made with nuts, and they also do not usually contain black pepper. Just try it... you won't regret it.

review/summary: Really Good Sugar Free Snack Cakes - Highly Recommended
review/text: The Tastykake "Sugar Free Chocolate Cream Filled Cupcakes" are a very good tasting low carb snack. Each packet contains two cupcakes (1 serving) that has 140 Calories and a low 6 Net Carbs! The flavor is very good, with only the slightest aftertaste.<br /><br />These have only a minimal impact on my blood sugar levels (Type 2 diabetic) as they are sugar free, sweetened with Maltitol and Sucralose. Maltitol, in large doses, does cause some people "gastric distress" so you might want to avoid eating a lot of these until you know how it effects you.<br /><br />Overall, these are great teasting and filling snacks! Highly Recommended! You might also be interested in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0023V5KHC">Tastykakes 2 box pack of Orange Finger Cakes SUGAR FREE</a>, which are my favorite!

review/text: These sugar free cupcakes are really very good. No one can really expect a sugar free product to taste EXACTLY like the real thing but for what it is, it's very tasty (just like the brand name says). However, this seller is pricing this product way above what the Tastykake website sells them for and 3 times more than what you can get them for at WalMart. I suppose, if you can't find them at your local stores and don't want to settle for something else, you might be tempted to pay $18 for 12 servings.

review/summary: Totally Disappointed and Disillusioned
review/text: I have been eating candy bars from the Mars company as long as I've been alive. That's 50-years (give or take). Now, in all that time I formed attachments and allegiances to various bars in their line of candy. One might be my favorite, while others were less so, but any of them, from number one to the very bottom of the list was a joy. Every one was different with varying ingredients and combinations of flavors, but they all had one thing in common, great taste. Hand any of them to me as a child and my face would light up. That's why the 3 Musketeers Chocolate Bar, Coconut is such a huge disappointment. Simply put, it tastes bad, really bad.<br /><br />It amounts to a regular 3 Musketeers bar with a terrible artificial coconut flavoring added. I am a huge fan of coconut sweets. I also have a soft spot for chocolate. These bars are the worst of all possible worlds. The artificial coconut flavor is overpowering, chemical and leaves a nasty aftertaste that lingers for a considerable time. I would have never thought it possible for Mars to create something like this. How in the world did this get past the product development process at the company? I know it's just a candy bar, but it also feels like a little piece of my childhood was ruined by this. There were never many things you could absolutely count on in life. Now, there is one less.

review/summary: Sometimes you feel like a coconut, sometimes you don't (get any)
review/text: I bought this candy bar by mistake as, in my haste, I mistook it for a regular 3 Musketeers bar. When I got home and unwrapped it, I noticed that the wrapper said it was the coconut variety. Okay, I like coconut. Inside I found two half-bars. The chocolate on the outside and the nougat inside tasted about the same as a standard 3 Musketeers bar, except there was a fairly subtle but definite coconut flavor. Coconut flavor, but no coconut. I was expecting something like the offspring of a Mounds bar and a standard 3 Musketeers bar, with real coconut inside. No such luck. The coconut flavor comes from, "artificial and natural flavors." This candy bar tasted good to me, but I was disappointed with the lack of real coconut.

A couple days later the price dropped to $7.01.  I didn't order any as I don't need that many.  The next day the price jumped to $20. plus change.  The lower prices weren't lightning deals either.  Such a drastic change in pricing is ridiculous.  Who's going to pay $20 plus tax and shipping for 24 candy bars when they can just buy them in the store for the same price?  Get with it Amazon.

They're trying to hide the fact that there's no coconut.  AND failing, since they put a big color picture of a broken open coconut front and center (oh boy, no real coconut... just some so called flavor somewhere.. oh joy) and there is plenty of info. about how this bar has less calories.  Sure it has less calories, since we're getting ripped off.  What a terrible tasteless candy and a bad decision on the makers part to rip off consumers.

Mine seem especially burned out on things with chicken in it although I know the chicken is good for them.<br /><br />Over six months time, this has not been and issue with this Cheddar Chicken. My cats love it. When we are having a "blah" day and no food seems to suit, I get out the Cheddar Chicken and all are happy. This especially applies to my Alpha Female Kitty.

Gabriella, (2 years) Trinity (3 years), Wisdom (5 months) and Mercy (5 months) all said that they agree. They feel like, unless your cat eats only finer things than this, your kitty will enjoy Fancy Feast Chicken. They say they are just "middle of the road spoiled", but not "totally spoiled" and they should know. Thank you for your kindness in listening to them.

review/summary: Surprisingly good
review/text: This coffee was a very pleasant surprise.  I enjoy flavored coffees, but find most of the k-cup varieties to be too weak.  After my initial round of taste testing I had settled in with GM Mountain Blueberry, Mocha Nut Fudge, and Caramel Vanilla Cream.  After reading reviews I decided to try the Butter Toffee when Caramel Vanilla Cream was unavailable for a while... I'm glad I did!  The flavors are distinct without overpowering the coffee essence, and the aroma is wonderful.  If I've brewed a cup and walk out of the room, when I come back in the scent hits me immediately.  Yummm!<br /><br />This coffee, as typical of flavored k-cups, isn't particularly strong, but it holds up in the small cup size nicely.  My usual routine has been to alternate flavors during the course of the day, but I now find myself reaching for a second cup of Butter Toffee.

Been making it on the 8oz mug setting and just fine!

review/summary: Good taste - poor quality control on K-cups
review/text: The flavor on these butter toffee k-cups is decadent, and the first few my husband and I drank were great. Now we've have 6-7 cups in a row in which the filter seems to malfunction, not allowing all the water to drain out, but LOTS of grounds. The result is a half-cup of coffee full of grounds and a Keurig to clean up. May just be a crummy box, but beware! (The Timothy's brand k-cups never give us this trouble.)

review/summary: Stick with Timothy's or Green Mountain
review/text: I ordered this flavor, butter toffee, based on the reviews I read.  This flavor sounded wonderful and isn't one of the flavors offered by either Timothy's or Green Mountain, so I thought it was worth a try.  What a disappointment!  The coffee is pretty weak and the flavor is just off - certainly NOT the rich, buttery toffee flavor I was looking forward to. I guess I've gotten spoiled by the rich coffee and wonderful flavors of Timothy's and Green Mountain, and there is absolutely no comparison between those coffees and this brand.  From now on, I'm sticking to the brands I can count on to deliver a wonderful cup of coffee every single time.

I've also had no problems with quality control and we've gone through probably 12 boxes of this in the past 6 months.

review/text: Wonderful aroma. However, I have to agree with the other one star reviewer. This coffee has almost no flavor of any kind (coffee, or butter toffee).  I ended up having to mix it with another K-cup flavor so it would not be a total waste. I can not help but feel it was a complete waste of money. I recommend Timothy's Cinnamon Roll flavor as it taste like coffee with a hint of cinnamon roll. Probably a wise choice if you enjoy weak coffee.

It's especially good when your throat is soar (like pumpkin spice).<br /><br />I would recommend this highly.<br /><br />BTW, If you don't like a particular k-cup flavor you've purchased, you can trade, sell, or give it away at the K-Cup Exchange on Yahoo.

review/text: I gave up sugar (mostly 99% of the time) a bit over a year ago. For a while, I just didn't really have treats. Saw these in the drugstore and got some. Ya know, they do taste like the YPP we know and love. Nice and minty and chocolatey. BUT....<br /><br />The texture is just not the nice one associated with the original. This lacks that creaminess and...well...the texture magic. These are dryer...er...it's hard to describe, but it's not a lovely textural experience.<br /><br />Hence the 3 stars.<br /><br />Also, I wouldn't recommend more than one, two max at a pop. The sweetener they use will make you visit the bathroom and gurgle you up in more than minimal quantities. Well, they do me, anyway.<br /><br />But, for sugar avoiders, one of these once in a while after a meal is rather nice. :D

review/summary: Great tea
review/text: I usually order Adagio genmaicha (which costs 5 times as much), but decided to try this because the price was right.  I didn't know what to expect, but it is very comparable to Adagio tea. The leaves were smaller in the Hime tea and overall the tea was a little more nutty, but still wonderful. Genmaicha has a great smoky and earthy taste that is great to drink at any time.  The packaging is 4 big boxes in foil packages that seem to store well so far.  I'll be ordering again when I run out.  It's delicious.

review/summary: Hime Genmai Tea
review/text: Hime Genmai Tea is the same tea exclusively served at our grandparents' house in Downtown Los Angeles in the 1950's.  I was so pleased to find it advertised online, which is where I purchased it, 4 boxes shipped out at ~$22.00 including shipping.  The flavor is earthy and delicious, with a subtle nutty aspect, derived from the roasted rice.  It is yellow, not green, in color; a large tablespoon is sufficient for a good-sized teapot.  You definitely want to use a teaball, as it comes loose-leaf from the box.  This tea is so satisfying, you need not add any sweetners.  It goes well with any food, and I find that a cup consumed at the end of my day is highly satisfying.  I've given away boxes to my son's family, my hairdresser, my friends.  Makes a nice gift.

review/summary: Great, Reasonably-Priced Genmai Cha
review/text: This really is excellent genmai cha: they obviously have started with good-quality green tea, on which many brands clearly skimp, and have both roasted rice and puffed sorgum (which some brands omit). Inside the box, the tea is in a sealed foil bag to maintain freshness and reduce oxidation of the polyphenols. And the price is really quite good.

review/text: This is an excellent loose leaf tea, which can be brewed as long as you like (I forgot about it for about 30 minutes first time I made it), and it's never bitter.  I like it hot, but iced is devine.<br /><br />I will say that the box instruction -- brew for 30 seconds -- is useless.  30 seconds gets you barely colored hot water and zero flavor or aroma.  I usually brew for about seven minutes, using 3 tablespoons genmai to 4 cups water.  Then I re-use the leaves for another 4 cups, brew for 8 minutes, and blend the two brewings into a pitcher.  Perfect iced tea.<br /><br />Excellent tea, excellent value.

review/text: There is a surprise when you spoon the tea into a tea strainer.  There are popped sorghum seeds that look like miniature popped corn.  The tea has a stronger aroma than most green teas and a richer taste.  It is now a favorite tea right up next to gunpowder green tea.<br /><br />Because Amazon only has it available in 4 box cartons I am sharing it with my daughers who also are tea drinkers.

review/text: This is the closest I got to the green tea I drink at Japanese/Korean restaurants. It is delicious and nutty without any bitterness. You can make it as strong or weak as you like based on the measurement you use. Tea comes loose and should be used with a teapot but I don't have any problems dropping about a teaspoon in the bottom of my cup and drinking it with the leaves on the bottom. Very happy with my purchase.

review/text: Ok, so, Genmai Cha tea is not for everyone. My wife won't let me make it in the kitchen because it smells SO bad. I personally love it even though it kind of smells like nutty toasted tuna (really).<br /><br />All Genmai Cha smells like this (I have found). However some are better tasting than others. This one is just "ok", not totally nasty, yet not great either, but it is cheap, so that's a plus (I guess). I usually get the Peet's Tea brand, but it is SO expensive ($10 per 1/4 pound).<br /><br />This tea is a bargain if you can embrace the nastiness. :)

review/summary: NOW stevia extract is the best I've tried so far
review/text: I give NOW stevia 5 stars as they have the best stevia I've tried so far - but I've only tried their extract packets.  This one has no additional ingredients and no aftertaste (if used sparingly as intended).  Stevia will not have the exact same type of sweetening taste as granulated sugar or honey or other such sweeteners.  It is concentrated and super sweet, and has its own flavor and the more you add the more unpleasant it can get.  A smaller amount is best over a larger amount. I eventually got used to using a smaller amount and adjusting my sweet taste - just like adjusting to lower salt.  From my previous research, stevia is the safest alternative, calorie-free sweetening product (or should I say "nutritional supplement") available.  It is a natural product and not a manmade or altered substitute sweetener and appears to have none of their negative side effects.  I like the handy packets of the pure extract to carry with me and have used it mostly for adding to things like hot and cold cereal and drinks like tea and coffee.<br /><br />I've not tried it much in baking, but there are stevia cookbooks available on Amazon.  There are cheaper products available with a mixture of stevia and other sweeteners, but not everyone reacts positively to some of the other additive sweeteners.  If you don't, then try another brand, or stick to the pure extract.

review/text: I love Now Products and have always been pleased with the quality.  I am giving this product one star because somehow I missed in the ingredients list that this item contains rice maltodextrin - which is an issue for some folks which need to be gluten free (not sure based on the research if maltodextrin is gluten free for sure or not....) or for people who have issues with carbs or don't want to eat anything derived from corn, rice wheat (paleo, primal), and also, isn't adding maltodextrin to stevia kinda like mixing sugar with stevia?  Or am I wrong? Maybe it's added in for pouring ability.  Anyway, I am disappointed, I just wanted pure stevia.  I went with the Sweetleaf product after returning this.

review/summary: Good...But Not As Good As The Concentrate
review/text: I'll just chime in here that I'm a long time Stevia fan and love the Now Foods Stevia Extract. So when we ran out of that and it was back ordered everywhere, I decided to try the Stevia packets. I didn't take into account that their packets would be packaged to be the equivalent of a packet of sugar or sweetener. I was very disappointed when I had to use more and more of the packets to make my tea or coffee sweet enough which means that the packets must have some filler in them. And the taste is not the same as the concentrate which may be because of the filler.<br /><br />So when the concentrate became available again, I bought that and am a happy Now Foods Stevia user.<br /><br />So if you want to lower your sugar intact (doctors will tell you that refined sugar is poison to your body) and also get away from the toxic chemicals that artificial sweeteners are made from, then I would not recommend this Stevia but I can recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MGWIH0">Stevia Extract Powder-White - 1 lb. - Powder</a>.<br /><br />For first timers who have never used Stevia before, do understand that Stevia does not "taste" like sugar, or artificial sweeteners (which don't taste like sugar either). But Stevia will register on the tongue as "sweet" and is easy to get used to. Just be forewarned that if you are looking for an exact substitute for the sugar taste, this is not it (and I've not found one yet).

With Stevita, I can simply swirl the glass with a little water and get the packet contents to completely dissolve; with this product, I had to use a spoon to stir vigorously and it still left 'clumps'.  Maybe it works better in warm beverages but it's a pain in cold drinks.

review/summary: watch out
review/text: I have been a heavy user of stevia  for 4 years (3 packs a day). It has greatly helped me with dieting. But this is not as natural as everyone is raving about. Please google this product for sideffects. All white stevias are highly processed chemicals, slowly toxic to anyone who uses it regularly. I have been admitted to numberous hospitals with the medicals bills to match my stays. Doctors didnt find anything wrong with me so of course I hand to keep on doing tests because I had headaches ,dizzyness, high blood pressure, muscular and heart spasm etc.<br />I later stopped using this product and after 8 months of huge amounts water,kiwis,spirulina,excercise, detox. My health slowly returned. Forget about these sugar substitutes. Use real natural brown cane sugar, dark organic honey, unsulphured molasses or puree dark raisans and use it in your drinks. This stevia is regulated by the FDA for good reasons. If you are really stubborn use the green less processed  stevia leaf. Leave all white sugar substitutes, processed but so called pure agave, high corn syrup,etc alone. I wish I had been warned before the pain, medical bills and lost wages

review/summary: Excellent Product! Best thing since sugar!
review/text: FYI, you get 200 packets in this order; great for the price. I love it, but as with anything put in the mouth, some will like it and some will not. Go to Hawaii and sample Poi, or to Mindanao and try Durian. Most children in these locations eat them like candy, but others not used to the taste often spit it out. I happen to love this product. I am trying to keep away from sugar and any other sweetener that spikes insulin, or causes PH imbalance, or impacts the storage of fat. I have tried all the chemical sweeteners, and I'd rather eat sugar that those. I knew Stevia was an excellent alternative, but for a time there were no viable products. Recently I bought "Stevia in the Raw" at "the king of retail" and it was better that anything else at the time, however, it bore little resemblance this product, which is the best non-sugar sweetener on the global market thus far.
