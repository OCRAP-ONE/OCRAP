review/summary: My dog loves 'em...BUT
review/text: ...just be sure to wash each one before you give them to your dog(s) because during its processing, traces of chemicals are still left intact on the rawhides. My dog used to have upset stomach every time I gave him one of these, so I did a little google research and found out some disheartening information as to why he might be getting stomach aches. Otherwise these are great, his stomach no longer gurgles like crazy and he's keen on chewing these more than ever now. Just wash/rinse them with water inside and out and they'll be fine :)

review/summary: Variable Quality
review/text: Two out of four bags purchased have been great.  Good for at least a day of chewing by our happy Lab.  However, two bags must have come from old cows, because they couldn't be chewed.  The dog gave up interest quickly.  We tried soaking them in water, but this had little effect once the they dried.  Overall, they're great whan you get a "good" bag!

review/summary: Dogs love 'em, can't afford them
review/text: I have been buying these for my coonhound and retriever. They love them as in they can go through one a day. When I first started buying them a couple of months ago they were $1 a piece, now doubled in price. I can no longer afford their rawhide habit. I have switched to natural bones, cheaper and probably healthier. These are NOT made in USA but Central America.

review/summary: Hollow Rawhide Rolls Not The Best Chewy Choice
review/text: We bought the 6 pound pack of these rawhide rolls and found out they were hollow on the inside.  We understand that they are sold by weight, but the 'hollowness' causes the rawhide to chip off and be eaten quite quickly and somewhat dangerously as choking is a potential problem with the broken off pieces.

review/summary: My Dog loves them!
review/text: There's not a ton you can say about these.  I used to buy large quantity bags of these (different brand) at the local Sams Club but my store decided to stop stocking them.  I thought I'd turn to Amazon, as usual, to find a replacement.  They arrived quickly, seem to be of good quality, and are rolled tightly.  One of these keeps my dog occupied for about an hour to an hour and a half (he's a big dog) before he's completely devoured it.  That's pretty good when compared to others I have bought.  I'd definitely recommend these and will be back for more when this bag runs out.

review/summary: Rawhide Retriever Rolls (20 pk, 06202)
review/text: These rolls have received the excited approval of my 10 yr old Mastif.  He normally goes through<br />other rolls in a few hours.  With the Cadet Rolls the roll appears to be tighter wrapped and they<br />do not unroll/fall apart as easy.  The center stays rolled-up and forces him to chew his way through.  They must taste well as he really goes after them!  Great product!!!!  And, Amazon delivered the package ahead of schedule.

review/summary: BIG bag!
review/text: The package was even larger than I expected!  The bag is roughly 1'x1.5'x0.5' and contained at least 20 10-inch rawhide rolls.  It has a printed expiration date on the bag (2 years from the time I purchased them, which is far more than adequate for my heavy chewer).  According to the information printed on the product, the rolls are 100% beefhide and made in Paraguay.<br /><br />So far my 3 year old 25lb terrier mix is crazy about them. She can go through one roll in a few hours, but I usually let her have half of one every few days.

review/summary: Solved dog chew shattering problem
review/text: These are great chews.....but if you have a big energetic dog, like ours, you might have a problem with them shattering with pieces stuck to carpet and bare feet.  I now run hot water over the chew and put them in a plastic bad for about 30 minutes and then give them to the dog. This solved that problem. Sometimes a small piece will get left on the floor but the biggest problem is over.

They are still a good product and pretty good deal.

review/text: My 50lb lab/shep mix loves these things. The problem is just like someone else has noted she has figured out how to unroll them which greatly shortens the life of these. She can now get through one in an evening when at first it would take her a couple of evenings. Of course I am finding this problem with other rolls as well and currently trying some different things to see if I can find something else that works. I will say that these are the best rolls I have tried. The price has gone up quite a bit since I started buying them, but still probably the best value out there, but no longer a no brainer decision like it use to be.

review/text: I have a 1.5 yr old golden who LOVES to chew! These raw hides are tightly rolled up like the others have mentioned and he has to chew through the whole thing. Luckily it doesnt crumble up like another packet i bought from amazon by another seller. However, they are messy like any other raw hide and the package also looks different from the picture shown. Overall a good product and will definitely order again!<br /><br />I had written the above review immediately after receiving the raw hides, and my golden was vigorously chewing through them all! However I started noticing that he used to fall sick the day after he consumed it (I used to give him only one a week). So I've stopped giving it to him now. They are just sitting in my house, and Iv switched to Pork Chomps, which are pork rolls and are 100% digestible!

review/summary: Best Bone for your Buck!
review/text: Bought these recently for my 1 year old boxer mix.  We had been through a few different kinds of retriever rolls before getting these, but I can honestly say these are the best we have come across.  They are very tightly wrapped, and are pressed at the end to seal so that they don't unroll.  This makes for a very durable chewing experience.  She's really gotta work at them to chew them down, which means more chewing time and going through them at a slower pace.  Only thing I wish is that they were made in the USA, otherwise, a great product!

Our dog loved them and it was a great distraction for him when we were just hanging out in the yard or at a friends house and we didnt want to constantly be watching him. I thought they were so great I wanted to look for a "biggie" pack so we could last a while without re-ordering. I saw this pack and the good review and said, why not...<br /><br />My dog absolutely loves these!! He goes nuts any time I give him one and it keeps him distracted for hours. For the price you cant beat it. If i kept buying the 3 packs I would have only gotten about 10 bones, but instead I got 20. Awesome!!

No residue<br />4. Inexpensive<br /><br />For the above reasons I immediately noticed that my dogs never lost interest in them (to this day) and that they paced themselves much better on them compared to other rawhides... they frequently lose interest in other rawhide brands or binge eat them because they're so weak - NOT the case with Cadet... Anyway, I imagine these  10 inch rolls are ideal for dogs under 60 lbs - any larger and you may not notice the same difference i have.

review/summary: Good dog treats
review/text: This is a good product although not as good a value as what Costco was carrying until they stopped.  My dogs are labs and need something more robust than pig ears or other lightweight chew items which they consume like water.  As a lot of others have commented, they do splinter more easily than the ones at Costco (may be due to the manufacturing or variation in hide used).  They last much longer than other chews and our dogs seem to be very happy with them.  I did have one bad experience where there were issues with the shipping (with live UPS tracking, they left the warehouse after they were estimated to arrive) so if you need them for a certain time period, plan ahead and order early.

review/text: Having 3 Jack Russells and a Shiba Inu gives all new meaning to the word "destruction". As you can imagine, the little busybodies do a whole lot of chewing!<br /><br />These are probably the most tightly rolled retriever rolls, and the rawhide quality is also very good... well bleached, wont stain your carpet (unless you have a severe drooler!) and very thick. The bulk packs are well worth it, and the pricing from this vendor is the lowest I've found! They last quite a while, even with my power chewers. I will continue ordering this product for my "chew crew" as a boredom buster!

They are much more reasonably priced and I have the added benefit of having them delivered to my front door.  Although the shipping is a little steep (they are ineligible for Amazon Prime), it is still cheaper than grocery store rawhides.

I would recommend anyone looking for a good value in rawhides to try these Cadet Retriever Rolls - you won't we disappointed.

review/summary: A great retreiver roll
review/text: My golden will only chew rawhide retreiver rolls.  In the past, the only ones I ever purchased that our dog did not chew up in 15 minutes came from Target; made in the USA.  We moved from a large city to a small town when my husband retired from the USAF a couple of years ago.  We are from 3 hours to 4 hours away from a Target and when we did go, it was difficult to get enough packages to stock up on.<br /><br />I found these while searching on-line for an alternative and thought "well, the reviews seem good, I'll give them a try."  I LOVE THEM.  Mattie, out dog, loves them.  They last and last, so she gets to chew and chew.  I probably won't be buying any other retreiver rolls but these from now on.<br /><br />Thanks Rawhide Depot!!<br /><br />Judy Wiseman

review/text: Look no further.  I have two great danes and these have been their pacifiers since they were little.  If I ever need time without them under my feet, one of these rawhides always does the trick.  They last longer than other rawhides and don't go stale as quickly.  One of my girls is a strong chewer but it will still take her a few hours to get through one of these.<br /><br />I used to get these from Costco for $13 a bag but they stopped selling them. I then found someone through eBay for $18 list (although I would buy 5 bags at a time so I got them for $14/bag).  Now they don't sell this kind anymore and I miss them!  I just found these and plan to stock up.  The Cadet brand is GREAT!  You'll never want anything else once you try these!

review/text: A retriever's gotta chew!  That's what they do!  My bowser tends to ignore most synthetic chew toys (nylon, rubber, etc.) and material 'toys' rarely last 5 minutes regardless of 'quality' (meaning price!).  I give him one of these rolls each morning after breakfast, and it satisfies his need to 'chew' all day.  (As a puppy, he ate an entire couch, the walls - even my lawnmower!)  These are good, high quality, leather chew rolls, in quantity, at a great price.  Through Amazon, a 1-click order brings a 2-month supply to my mailbox.  Now that's service!

review/summary: You Snooze, You Lose
review/text: I'd ask our English Setters, Toby and Abby, to rate these treats, but they won't work for free and Deb already has them plumped up beyond "fluffy." Actually, Toby is somewhat less enthused than Abby, which is OK with her, because as soon as Toby turns his back, she eats his as well - and begs for more. You snooze, you lose. The only quibble I have is with the price - we don't pay this much per pound for our own food. On the other hand, if they only cost $3 or $4, I'd have to buy a crate full every month. The best I've been able to do so far is swear I'll never pay this much again, wait two weeks and order another couple of bags. Believe Abby would rate them 10 stars if she could type. These treats are generally a little less expensive that the competition (and I think equally good, although I confess I've not actually eaten any myself), so they are usually ordered more often.

review/summary: The flavours are not lies!
review/text: These beans are a wonderful thing. The good flavors, you can eat, and they are totally fantastic. The terrible flavors, you can belittle the manhood of your friends with. The in-between flavors? Like grass? They're largely there to confuse you, and do so wonderfully.<br /><br />To sum up my experience with them, an anecdote:<br /><br />Driving along one summer, eating said beans, my two friends convince me to eat the Booger flavoured one. "Okay," I begin "but only if you get a good flavored one ready to get the taste out of my mouth."<br /><br />My first friend passes me the booger-bean, and gets a grape-bean ready on deck. The booger bean was mostly flavourless... until the saliva hit my tongue! Retching, I spat out the window, and demanded the grape bean. Blargh! The dark colour tricked them! It was dirt! Spitting again, I demanded another bean. They produced another dark coloured one, this one seeming noticeably more purple in the light. Noooo! It was more dirt!<br /><br />Pulling over, and spitting out the bean, they presented me with a white one. "Alright," they said "This can only be popcorn, or marshmallow."<br /><br />Seeing no bad option, I took the bean and chewed it gratefully. Then I vomited in my mouth.<br /><br />It was neither popcorn, nor marshmallow. It was rotten egg!<br /><br />Suffice to say, that these are not the kind of jelly bean you buy, thinking that every one of them will be wonderful. The rotten egg, dirt, soap, and vomit beans all taste exactly what they are supposed to. And that is what makes them a fantastic product.

review/text: I was really excited to find Bertie Botts Every Flavour Jelly Beans because my kids would love them.  It was a 2-pack, and for $9 I figured that the boxes would be pretty big.  Boy was I wrong.  The boxes are the size of small raisin boxes, and they aren't even filled very full.  I was very disappointed and feel ripped off.  Breaking the cost down, each jelly bean costs about 25 cents, and these are small candies - the size of jelly bellys.  Don't waste your money unless you have a lot to waste...

review/summary: Harry Potter jelly beans
review/text: we sent these with bertie bunny jelly bean dispenser to our daughter in Texas for Easter.  The cute bunny makes the Harry Potter jelly beans even more of a surprise, mostly good, but always interesting.  These jelly beans are for fans of the books and movies, they are what they say they are, not a sweet treat but cool and great conversation starters!

review/text: So happy to see these nasty little candies are back- my kids were soo disappointed last year when all we could find were the knock-offs. Nothing gets by my Harry Potter fans! The boxes are quite small, so yes- this is expensive for a few jelly beans. Gross ones at that. But my kids will have a ball tasting them and playing HP while they do. Thanks again, Amazon!

review/summary: For Harry Potter fanatics only
review/text: Big Harry Potter fans get a big kick out of these because some the flavors are genuinely odd like those in the books (such as "rotten egg" or "soap") but they're quite expensive for the size of the boxes. Be aware that each box is tiny - not much bigger than a small pack of gum or mints. My daughter enjoyed sharing them with her friends.

review/text: I didn't pay attention when I ordered these jelly beans, and was shocked at how small the box really is.  Only 1.2 ounces.  I paid WAY too much for them, but I hope my daughter, who is a Harry Potter nut, will enjoy them.  Currently, Amazon has 2 boxes of these available for a better price than 1.

review/text: Just received these two boxes which I purchased to go in my son's stocking for Christmas, but the boxes are so small, I regret ordering them, especially for $10! BE WARE! These boxes are about the size of a cigarette lighter. (I bought a box of these years ago and they were a regular size candy box, so i had expected these to be about the same size.)

review/text: A few human flavors mixed with some amazingly gross and disgusting flavors.  Im not going to tell you about them, find out yourself.<br /><br />I tell you though,  HOW Bertie figures out how to make them taste so realistic is scary.  My kids and I had a great deal of fun with these.<br />(actually the fun is not over.  Mama doesnt know the nasty beans have been mixed in her regular beans, and she never reads reviews  hehheh)<br /><br />Easily worth the 4.50 I paid for the 2 pack

review/summary: Fun but don't expect more than 20 beans.
review/text: My son loves the Harry Potter books and movies so he had to have these as soon as he knew they were available. The box was very small and had only about 15 beans in it. There were several duplicates so he did not get one of each flavored, which was a bummer. I also think the price and shipping cost is outrageous for the size.

review/text: OK. I purchased this last week and eat the first box without looking at back side...the effect was: I didn't eat my dinner at all because I felt disgusted all day long. This is just what Bertie Botts supposed to be. But don't try it if you are NOT OK with awful flavors.I took a VOMIT one thinking it was cinnamon...and blueberry flavor tastes like dishwasher. I give it a five star because it is perfectly awful, but don't buy it if you haven't decided how much you can take...just don't!

review/text: Though a little pricey for the size (reason for 4 stars), this was a fun item to buy.  We had a great time on Christmas daring all of the family members to eat the different flavors that come in the boxes.  These are Jelly Belly jelly beans with flavors like vomit, soap, ear wax, booger, etc.  My son swears a bubble came out of his mouth after eating the soap flavor and drinking water.<br />Great for all Harry Potter fans that enjoy a good laugh.

review/text: I didnt buy it from amazon I found it in Borders Book stores, seriously they had a whole Harry potter section just like Barnes and Nobles. I digress, I dont know what the heck possessed me to taste the vomit flavor one but blech...it was so gross, although there were some good ones too. Grass taste just like grass lol, I was too chicken to taste any other flavors after getting vomit and the earwax..it was gross...gross but still pretty fun

review/summary: Bertie Botts' Beans
review/text: I was told in a previous review that these beans were not good. They were right! Some were awful, and my kids enjoyed every miniute! During a Harry Potter themed birthday, we had an "every flavoured bean tasting" The dirt and grass were pretty realistic, but the vomit was a bit coconutty in taste. (Hmmm. Makes me wonder.) Anyway, they were not all meant to be delecious, yet some were (think, Tutti-Fruity) I would def give them a go again should we have the urge.

So, we're planning another HP sleepover...lol.

review/summary: A little disgusting... a lot overpriced
review/text: When Harry Potter first made its debut we had bought a bag of the Harry Potter Bertie Botts Every Flavour Jelly Beans for our children. Yes, they were perfectly disgusting... as they should be... and the kids loved trying to get people to eat vomit and rotten egg flavored jelly beans. Now we are at the end of the Harry Potter era and we purchased these for Christmas stockings. Still just as disgusting but who knew how SMALL each box was. 1.2 oz per box seemed acceptable but for $9 plus shipping????? At most they should have cost .50 to $1 per box. We won't be making that mistake again!
