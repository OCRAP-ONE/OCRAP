review/summary: Allergies
review/text: My boxer-mix has suffered terribly with allergies.  Constant yeast infections in his ears, skin problems, general stinky dog problems.  After taking him to the vet for like the 100th time for steroids and a super-duper ear washing at the cost of $278, I finally decided to research a better solution.  I found that my dog could be allergic to corn or chicken and it would be best to cut that out of his food all together.  I found this brand at Petco and ever since we went to this vegetarian formula he has been *basically* allergy free!!  He's like a whole different dog!!!  Clear eyes, clear skin, lost a bunch of weight, runs around with his brother like they were puppies all over again, doesn't smell and hasn't needed to go back to the vet for his ears!!!  My doggy loves this food and I love that he's finally healthy.

review/summary: My Vegetarian Dogs.
review/text: Being that I am a vegetarian I was having a hard time feeding my dogs Blue Buffalo Chicken kibble. I just could not do it anymore from a moral and ethical standpoint so I started to research 'Vegetarian Dogs' like crazy. Came to find out most dogs who convert to a vegetarian diet thrive on it and I can honestly say this is true. My dogs are ages 2ish,7 and 11ish, all adopted, all Chihuahuas and all came with their own issues. The one thing we all agree on is that Natural Balance Vegetarian Formula is the best. My oldest dog has seriously just thrived off this food, she is so energetic and happy. My other 2 love it and their coats look so shiny and their nasty dog breath has gone away.<br />I know my decision was one that many people will criticize and say is 'selfish' and 'wrong' but the bottom line is I did my research, spoke with the people at Natural Balance, told my vet and in the process found out that the worlds oldest living dog was/is 26 and is a vegetarian. So needless to say, I don't think dogs not eating meat is as big of a deal as we would like to think it is. This dog food has changed my life, my dogs lives and the lives of many other vegans I have met who were against getting a dog because they could not find an ethical dog food.<br />Natural Balance I cannot Thank You enough!!!

review/summary: Not for all dogs
review/text: My wife and I are vegetarian, and after a lot of research decided to start feeding our dog this kibble. Afterall, dogs can clearly survive on vegan diets, as long as they are nutritionally balanced. The whole time she appeared fine, and there were no issues with lethargy, or fur. However, after a few months she started having uncontrolable diharrea, and loads of gas.  After a lot of vet bills and testing we were left with the suggestion to try a different food.<br /><br />So we did a 180 degree turn, and bought a no-grain high-protein food (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZNW346">Blue Buffalo Wilderness Grain Free Dry Dog Food, Duck Recipe, 24-Pound Bag</a>). The bottom line, is that now she seems to be doing much better.  At the end of the day we never figured out what it was about the veggie food that upset her bowels, but changing food solved the problem. We are not super militant vegetarians, so this wasn't the end of the world for us.  Our mantra is minimize.<br /><br />Don't misunderstand me; I've read many good things about this veggie kibble, and there are many stories of people feeding their dog this food for many years with no problems.  So, by all means try it out.  I'm glad we did, and in all honesty I wish we could keep feeding it.  However, I only write my story so that people can be aware that this may not work for all dogs.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After a few bags of the Blue Buffalo Wilderness, we switched again to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CICX6">Prairie Chicken Meal & Brown Rice Medley Dry Dog Food by Nature's Variety, 30-Pound Bag</a> and have been feeding it for around 6 months now. We've had no problems since.

review/summary: Seems good for Purines
review/text: Tastes good & is good for him!<br /><br />My Dalmatian (11 years old) has had problems with bladder stones caused by purines (the same amino acid that causes gout). If he's forming the stones, he will start bleeding slightly after he has peed (bladder stone are a real danger for Dalmatians and sometimes their urinary tracts get completely clogged like his once did, requiring emergency surgery).<br /><br />Dick Van Patten's Vegetarian Natural Balance has not caused any purine related problems. I would recommend it for Dalmatians. I think because it is vegetarian, it has fewer purines than meat based dog foods.<br /><br />He likes it too!

review/summary: Well rounded dog food
review/text: My 16 month old Cockapoo seemed to not like any kind of food we were buying him. I would even splurge and get expensive organic food for him, but no luck. A friend of mine suggested trying vegetarian dog food, and after doing research and finding out there are so few brands to choose from, Natural Balance was my choice. My dog has been eating this brand of food now for nearly a year and he absolutely loves it. Plus, he never has tummy troubles since having been on this food. Other foods used to make him irregular or have diarrhea, but he is completely regular and never has stomach issues.<br />We have him on a completely veg diet and he's the happiest dog I know. I just wish there were more veg options out there for dogs.

review/summary: Excellent high quality dog food!
review/text: This is an excellent high quality food for any dog. Dogs can be perfectly healthy on a vegetarian diet, and this food is a great option for vegetarian owners, or for dogs with allergies or issues with meat. Two of our dogs have been eating this for a few years now, and they are perfectly healthy and love it! They have very soft and shiny coats, are full of energy, and have nice stools. They had very soft stools when they were on another vegetarian dog food brand. Willi (border collie mix) used to be quite picky with his food, we sometimes had to sprinkle something on it so he'd eat it, but not with this food! He eats it up right away. I just wish our french bulldog could also eat it, but she has some sort of food allergies to it.

review/summary: The Vegan Beagle Loves It
review/text: When I found out dogs could live healthily vegan, I jumped at the chance to share my diet with mine. This food was recommended by a friend so we tried it out and my beagle loved it. Granted, he's a beagle and will eat anything. But, I noticed huge improvements in his health after eating this food. He would often vomit after eating when he ate an omni diet and have digestive issues. He was never a dog that could eat meat straight up without getting sick, so perhaps he was sensitive to even the high end food with meat in it I had him on before this. He has rarely thrown up since having him on vegan food, if at all. It's been so long I can't remember. His weight has been easier to manage, and he has a nicer coat and even better smelling breath! All his vet visits have been great. I totally recommend vegan diets for doggies and specifically this brand of food. I usually buy a big bag of it, get the free shipping, and am good for a while.

review/summary: Vegetarian APBT approve
review/text: My husband and I became vegetarian partly for our health but mostly for the animals of the world and the environment. We have been working on this for 5 months now and started felling guilty that we were letting our dogs contribute to the cruelty of factory farming that we despise. So we read up and made the leap for the dogs as well. We had been feeding Organix brand and mixed the first 28lbs with that to ease them into the life style. I recently ran low and tried a small bag of the Natures Recipe Vegetarian and that wont work for us as our 8 year old pitty refused to eat it, she's a food snob. To be fair our 16 month blue nose gobbled that brand down too but she will eat anything I think partly because she is a rescue from the streets. We follow the rules and give free range eggs once a week and they get vitamins as well. Both are happy and healthy. I highly recommend this food and will continue to order it.

review/summary: Healthy and Safe for your Vegetarian/Vegan dogs
review/text: My dogs have transitioned to a Vegetarian diet.  I started with Natural Balance Vegetarian Formula (dry and canned) - initially, I mixed it in with their "old" food (Wellness Lamb & Rice). After about 2 weeks, they were eating only Natural Balance Vegetarian/Vegan dog food.  I eventually also started to feed them V-Dog. I now feed them a mixture of Natural Balance Vegetarian and V-dog food. Since they stopped eating the meat byproducts (i.e. slaughterhouse waste), they no longer have upset stomachs and diarrhea (not to mention gas and runny poop), and their skin issues have gone away.  I would highly recommend Natural Balance Vegetarian/Vegan formula.

review/text: The Vet suspected my dog had allergies. My dog had issues with yeast, and a terrible body odor,black gunky ears, problems with feet etc.. I tried all high quality grain free formulas with little success. I would have to bath him at least once per week to keep odor down. Not easy for a large size dog!! After many tests and being on varies drugs, the Vet suggested a Vegetarian formula. I chose Natural Balance vs. product from the Vet as ingredients are superior. He has been on it one month now and the body odor has not returned. He absolutely loves this food! Never before has he eaten enthusiasitically!! He is 10 years old, and his energy level has increased!! I have still have some issues with his ears, but for right now the body odor is gone, gone gone... Taking one day at a time.....

review/text: My pit bull (2 years old) had been suffering from food allergies from approximately 8 months until a couple months ago. She had sores all over her stomach and when it got really bad they would even go up her back and into her ears. She went to the vet multiple times and the best he could do was put her on steroids and antibiotics. They would go away but then come right back. He put her on the Rabbit and Potato prescription dog food. The food helped and cleared her up but its $75 for a 25lb bag! I am so happy to report that this dog food (mixed with the rabbit and potato) has not brought back any allergies!! So happy and I know she is too :)  Great dog food, happy dog!

review/summary: Natural Balance - Vegetarian
review/text: My beagle has severe food allergies, especially to anything high in beef and chicken. Alternative meats just give him horrible gas to go along with his itchy skin. This food works WONDERS. A few days after feeding it to him, his itching stopped completely. Not only that, but he has a beautiful coat. I have heard a lot of criticism for feeding my little guy vegetarian food. People say that he's not getting enough nutrients and it's unnatural for a dog to be a vegetarian. I would much rather feed him something with more meat protein, but it would only work if I fed him steroids for the itching. I think the food is the lesser of two evils. His vet says that he's perfectly healthy and there's nothing wrong with a vegetarian diet. My only qualm is this: why does it have to be so expensive?! It's worth every penny, but seriously? And Natural Balance NEVER sends out coupons.

review/text: Our lab is allergic to chicken and corn.  He was on Purina HA, which is a vegetarian prescription food that's about 100 bucks for a large bag and could only be purchased at the vet.  We needed to transition away from that and this Natural Balance fit the bill.  Actually we couldn't find any other brand in the stores that made a vegetarian food.  He transitioned beautifully and had no gastrointestinal upset whatsoever.  That was a huge deal for him because the slightest thing upsets his belly.  His poo is actually better on this than on the script food which used to constipate him.  He seems to love the flavor of the Natural Balance and scarfs it very quickly.  He never fails to let us know when it's time to eat.  We're really glad they make this!

review/summary: Great for dogs with allergies
review/text: A couple years ago, i found myself faced with what seemed to be an unsolveable problem. What to feed a 5lb Papillon & 34 lb Beagle with different special dietary needs and a Bichon with no restrictions. . The Papillon due to food allergies needed a food that contained no chicken, corn or dairy products while the Beagle needed a low fat content due to a pancreas problem. I tried feeding them at different times, their own bowls, & even in different rooms with no luck.  I found myself reading  the ingredient list on more bags of dog food than I care to remember before finding Natural Balance's Vegetarian Forumla. I was quite surprised to see that it contained brown rice, peas,oatmeal,pototoes,barley, spinach and even cranberries, all foods they liked. I was even more surprised that it did not have chicken meal or chicken by products like so many other premium foods and that at 8% fat, it was well below the 12% limit imposed by my vet. The nugget size is small enough for the Papillon & Bichon but not to small for the Beagle.  However the best thing is that they like it & are thriving on it! Switching them over was easy and they have firm, compact stools. A sure sign that the  Natural Balance Vegetarian Forumla is providing the proper nutrients they need even with no meat in it. I highly recommend it for any dog.

review/text: I have two cocker spaniels, both got frequent ear infections, one age 6 has had allergies for well over 5 years, thousands of dollars, Vet visits and food trials and nothing helped. I started using Natural Balance Limited Ingredient and noticed a slight improvement on his skin and not nearly as much scratching. He had scratched off all of the fur on his neck and chest and was continuously gnawing on his paws and forelegs.<br /><br />Recently moved to a new area that does not have a pet shop close enough to continue to purchase Natural Balance, so I signed on to my Amazon account and looked up Natural Balance. Read so many good reviews on the Natural Balance Vegetarian Formula I decided to give it a try. MIRACULOUS Stuff!!! I bought a small bag at a Petco a few towns over from where I live, scratching was cut in half within a week. So I ordered the large 28 lbs bag from Amazon. A little over 3 weeks and the fur is growing back!! It looks like a soft peach fuzz and he is barely scratching at all these days.<br /><br />Neither dog has had an ear infection since being on this formula either.<br /><br />Love Natural Balance!!!

review/text: Dogs are omnivores, meaning they can survive on a vegetarian diet, but by no means will they thrive without the inclusion of animal proteins. If you are genuinely concerned about the moral implications of a dog's diet and choose to feed this to your dogs, I would STRONGLY suggest supplementing this food with free range eggs, sustainably harvested sardines, or some other source of animal protein that you deem morally acceptable.<br /><br />I have vegetarian friends who feed their dogs this and other formulas, and when compared to my lab, who is fed a high- protein, grain- free dog food, they almost look abused. Literally, they are all very slim and their fur is coarse and patchy, as opposed to my dog, who is muscular, with fur is as soft as cotton, and as happy as can be.<br /><br />If you want an all- inclusive dog food that will handle your dog's nutritional needs, this is not the dog food for you. That said, if your morals won't allow you to use a dog food with named meat products as the top ingredients (and there are organic varieties), then this may be a good option for you. Please, just remember to supplement with some form of animal protein every time you feed.

review/summary: Three flavors:  Terrible, Excellent, and Not Advertised / Wrong Holiday
review/text: I was very excited to see this holiday assortment when I searched for Ghiradelli's "Pepperment Bark".  There are three flavors:  Eggnog, Pepperment Bark, and IN THE PICTURE it shows Chocolate Pecan Pie.<br /><br />1) Eggnog -- this flavor is terrible.  It tastes like toxic levels of nutmeg, which is poisonous in large quantities.  After one square I was burping nutmeg all day.  I will not risk any more.  Avoid at all costs.<br /><br />2) Peppermint Bark -- Always fantastick, one of the best.  A blend of smooth milk and white chocolates with a refreshing, not overwhelming, peppermint kick.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />3) Pumpkin Spice Caramel -- NOT WHAT WAS PICTURED!!!  After I received the package, I noticed that in the product description language it did say "Pumpkin Spice Caramel", and there's a product substitution disclaimer as well.  So caveat emptor and all that.  Still, having anticipated and looked forward to trying the Chocolate Pecan Pie, this was a let down.  It's not bad, though a bit heavy-handed on the spices for my taste (nothing like the egregious nutmeg in the Eggnog -- this flavor was just not to my taste, that's all).  The real problem for me in the end was that I don't think of PUMPKIN for the winter holiday season, in a bag with little snowflakes on it no less.<br /><br />Bottom line:  I'm sticking to Peppermint Bark in future.

Also the sweetener that they used is VERY artificial tasting.  I am a Splenda and an Equal user so I wasn't looking for real sugar taste but this is just weird tasting.  I will finish the 2 boxes I bought, try to share with some friends, but I will not buy these again, they didn't live up to their name for me.

review/text: Our cat LOVES these bite-sized crunchy treats. She tends to be quite picky, but seems to really like the crunch and the tast of the spelt in these. Started chowing down on them right away. Can't vouch for how effective the tartar control aspect is, but the treats are vet recommended--we do normally only get this at the vet's office. Saved some cash by buying via Amazon.

review/text: I thought it was wonderful! I purchased this to share with my family and it was a hit. My dad kept sneaking them through dinner, and eventually the entire tin disappeared, to be seen every once in awhile when he was in the mood for one more.<br /><br />The fudge comes in a bag inside the tin, and each piece is individually wrapped. From the moment I opened the packaged I wondered if they would taste as strongly of alcohol as they smelled, not something I would like. And I was rather surprised, while there is a hint it is, in all, rather sweet and quite enjoyable. I highly recommend.

review/summary: Surprisingly good!
review/text: I admit that I had doubts when ordering these.  I figured they might be fun for a quick breakfast on occasion.  They shipped promptly, well packaged, arriving in good condition.  Package note said they would only keep for about one week.  I intended to put mine in the freezer anyway.  Each was soft and tender feeling.  You could easily squish them in handling.  That's a good sign - they aren't tough or stale.<br /><br />I expected an uber sugar bomb.  To my surprise, the danish/dough part is less sweet than most other danishes I've had, making for a nice contrast with the sweet filling.  The filling has a true and tasty cherry flavor, although the cheese part doesn't come across very clearly.  The icing on top isn't overly sweet or gloppy either, and did not leave a sticky mess on my hands.  The other thing I was happy about was that there is no scary chemically flavors, and the sweetness seems natural, like sugar, rather than corn syrupy.  For example, I dislike Entemann's products because I think they have a weird overly sweet and chemical quality; I would say that these are better.<br /><br />So - yes it's a sweet, mass-market prepackaged snack cake of a danish - but it's a very good one.

They also said it was caught in the oceans off of Somalia or somewhere, & to be honest I forgot that part.<br />The tuna IS definitely better than the other common store brands. I will try to get the Italian wild caught brand in the future if possible.  If not, I'll opt for this brand.

review/text: I have been enjoying a no/low carb no/low sugar journey for three months. Losing my favorite Yoshida's Gourmet sauce marinade was tough. Next I read scores of positive Seal Sama Sugar free user reviews. One mentioned how well it compared to Yoshida's and another noted it was as good as the best non-diet marinades. We bought three bottles.<br /><br />My wife (not needing diet products) and I have all our thumbs WAY UP for Seal Sama. We have now used it on steaks, chicken and fish and agree that it is amazing. Incredible flavor that does not mask the taste of great steaks, fish etc. Only need 1-2 tablespoons for up to 1lb and only needs two hours marinating time for full flavor. At zero sugar and only 1 carb per serving we are hooked on Seal Sama.<br /><br />Pricing: Lowest we have found - $4.95 with fixed $5 shipping from netrition.com We are delighted to pay this price for such an amazing, helpful and delicious product. Have no idea why Amazon.s price is way too high. Have seen it on other web sites for $6-$7 with higher shipping cost. Delighted to receive a return phone call from none other then Peggy Whitting the gal who created Seal Sama. She answered our query noting the Sugar free shelf-life is 2 years. With that in mind we shall be buying a dozen bottles at netrition using their fixed $5 shipping/no tax so final price will be about $5.40.  Thanks Seal Sama!!!

review/text: I love this sauce.  I use it mostly in stir-fries but my kids love it on rice.  It is hard to find low carb condiments to replace some of the products I used before and I was SO happy when I discovered this one.  I usually buy 6 bottles at a time so there is always one on hand.  It handles well in cooking and also is great out of the bottle if you want to add it after the food is prepared.  It is sweet like teriyaki should be but isn't overly sweet or "fake" tasting, as sugar-free products sometimes are.  I highly recommend it!

review/summary: I've been looking for something like this for years...
review/text: Years ago there was a product by Carb Smart that was a 1 carb Teriyaki sauce sweetened with Splenda.  I used to buy this stuff all the time and one day, it simply just disappeared from the shelves.  I've ordered a few variations of Teriyaki sauce over the years and NONE of them were any good.  When I came by this listing I was a bit skeptical at first but placed my order anyways.  The only reason this product does not get 5 Stars is because when I opened the box and removed the bubble wrap and the protective seal there was a little bit of sauce on the lid.  It had spilled out because the cap wasn't screwed on all the way.  Not a lot at all but enough to rinse my hand off in the sink with.  Plus its expensive.  After shipping this 12oz. bottle of sauce was over $12.00.  That is a bit pricey for just sauce, however I still paid it.  Damn curious nature!<br /><br />The sauce itself is WONDERFUL.  It's even better then what I remember.  I will definitely be using this sauce more in the future and I am happy that I found a Sugar Free Substitute.  I cook a lot of chicken and broccoli on my Low Carb Journey and this really makes it that much more enjoyable.  Plus its great on Shirataki Noodles.

review/summary: Good Energy with No Jitters for me
review/text: Despite it's juvenile sounding name, this isn't a child's energy drink that's for sure. Each tube packs about 42,000% the recommended daily dose of Vitamin B12. The high from this is extremely stable and hasn't yet given me the jitters.  Everyone reacts differently though so to guarantee 100% that you will not get the jitters would be a lie.  When I take it, I feel very awake, alert, and clear headed. I use it before a workout and several of the ingredients make it perfect for the gym. The let down is probably the smoothest you'll find among energy drinks. And if you feel a cold coming on, downing one of these may help tremendously.<br /><br />The name comes from the interaction the mix has with water. You pour one vile into a 16-20 oz bottle of water and the stuff fizzes like crazy! If you don't get the lid on fast enough, you'll quickly find there will be a mess! I've found using a wide mouthed nalgene bottle is the best way to prevent these types of accidents.<br /><br />In addition to the massive amounts of Vitamin B12, it has a good amount of Vitamin C (500mg), Niacin (10mg), Vitamin B6 (2.5mg), Calcium (60mg), Magnesium (100mg), and Potassium (905mg). It has almost every water soluble vitamin meaning that a lot of the excess that your body doesn't utilize, will be flushed through your kidneys. With that being said, drink a lot of liquid with this and don't over use the product (company recommends no more than 3 a day) or the chance of getting kidney stones exists.<br /><br />It has a 317mg "proprietary" blend blend of L-Arginine, L-Taurine, Caffeine from guarana, Alpha-lipoic acid, Grape seed extract, Green tea leaf extract, Ginger root, and Ginseng root. I don't know how much each compound contributes to the 317mg but they do acknowledge that 100mg of it is caffeine (about the same as a cup of coffee).<br /><br />There are multiple flavors but I'm partial to Grape and Orange Soda. The flavors are very sweet and candy-like but they surprisingly have no sugar. 10 total Calories and only 2g Total Carb.<br /><br />This is an excellent product and recommend it over any other energy drink.

review/text: After using Zipfizz for a year, I've been amazed at what it offers me.  I get sustained mental alertness and energy with no crash or fatigue.  It doesn't affect my sleep, and I find that it is easier to get up in the morning the day after taking Zipfizz.  You don't even have to use a whole tube if you're cost-conscious.  Sometimes, I use a half tube and find I get the results I need.  I will never drink Red Bull or Monster again.  This stuff is great.<br /><br />FYI, this thing is loaded with Vitamin B12 - as much as getting a Vitamin B shot from your doc.  Please avoid taking more than one or two tubes a day, because too much potassium can overload and be detrimental to your kidneys.

review/text: This drink is just wonderful.  Although it has caffeine, it doesn't have an alarming amount.  The great thing about this drink is all of the vitamins (I'm not good about taking a multivitamin...).  I drink this fairly diluted; with at least 32 ounces of water instead of 16 ounces and the flavor is just right.  The citrus is my favorite and, sadly, they don't carry that at Costco anymore.  I've been drinking only one Zipfizz daily and work in a school -- a huge breeding ground for germs and viruses -- and haven't been sick in the two years I've been drinking this.  Pretty impressive.  And it is WAY cheaper than a cup of coffee at Starbucks :)

The packaging will be very effective at keeping the stuff 'fresh' and will allow you to carry it around without the little packets opening in your bag. You can also re-close it if you do not want the full serving. The old stuff I used was a tablet that was individually foil wrapped and did just fine too and was much less wasteful. Each serving is in a thick rigid plastic tubes that will be around in the landfill for eons! They are #5 type plastic which is technically recyclable but is almost never accepted (think tupperware container) at local recycling centers. I hope the manufacturer will find a better solution to packaging this awesome stuff!

review/summary: Great drink! Grows on you.
review/text: To be honest, I was at first skeptical about this drink.  In my mind, an energy drink had always been any drink with sugar and caffeine levels as high as seen in Monster and Redbull.  My mother one day brought this home from Costco and told me to try it out.<br /><br />It took me probably 2 or 3 drinks to get used to the taste. It wasn't that it was terrible. I guess the "problem" when I started out was that the taste was just a bit different from what I'm used to.  But I have to tell ya this company did a great job sweetening the drink without using sugar or some other artificial crap that's seen in others.  Once you get used to this drink you find yourself popping one out casually once a day.<br /><br />That being said I've noticed that this drink doesn't have the same type of boost you get with caffeine.  The problem with Red Bull and coffee is that the caffeine, while kicking in a lot faster than this drink, also causes you to crash and burn several hours later just as quickly.  This drink however doesn't have that effect.  It gives me a subtle yet noticeable boost for several hours before giving me a "gentle landing" back to where I usually would be without the drink.<br /><br />Anyhow, that's where I am.  Down to 5 tubes and hunting for any deals on this at Costco and here.

review/text: I'm going to try to keep my review simple.<br />I mix one tube with 8-12oz of water.<br /><br />Pros: noticeable energy boost after 2-3 sips.<br />  When I first tried it, i got a "high" or<br />  a awakening buzz... after 1 sip. you just have to try it to understand.<br />  Strong stuff. take it in sips through the morning.<br />  (I don't recommend drinking the whole tube in 3 mins. )<br />  No crash and jitters. ( But i'm sure you will feel weird if you drink it too fast.)<br /><br />Cons: a little on the expensive side, but far better deal than red bull or coffee from a store.<br />  mixing the powder adds 1 or two extra steps in the morning.<br /><br />Bottom line: I like this product. It simply works.

review/summary: Pink: My new obsession?
review/text: I have to say that this pink lemonade flavor is simply delightful! I started drinking zipfizz to quash my overwhelming addiction to caffeine that had spiraled out of control.  I find that I have received the same pick-me-up that I was getting from 500-600mg of caffeine.  While ZipFizz does have 100mg of caffeine, it does not come with the same 'crash' that caffeine delivers.<br /><br />The pink lemonade flavor is, by far the best flavor I have had.  You can customize the sweet-tartness level by adding more or less water.  I recommend everyone try this product and you will be instantly hooked! Yaaaaay ZipFizz!

review/summary: WONDERFUL!
review/text: I have been using ZipFizz for about 6 months now and I love it.  I am partial to the Grape and Orange, the Pink Lemonade was just a bit sour for me.  I only take one a day and right before I go to the gym.  I compare this to Advocare's "Spark" drink and this product is WAY CHEAPER but contains just about the same things!  Awesome for those on a budget.<br />Some may be confused by what seems like an excess of vitamins on the ingredient label.  But any that you dont use up in the day get flushed from your body though your kidneys.  DO NOT TAKE MORE THAN 3 a day it says on the vile, but I only need one in the morning to help me rip though my workouts.<br /><br />I do not drink caffine in any other form because I am very sensitive to it. But with this drink I have not had a problem, I thought that it would make me jittery or feel awful, but this product does no such thing!  After the gym I am good to go though the time I get home and I sleep fine!

review/summary: Have been drinking ZIPFIZZ for a couple of weeks...
review/text: I have been drinking ZIPFIZZ for a couple of weeks now.  So far my favorite flavor is the Orange.  At first I drank it like medicine... just for the energy.  Now I look forward to it.<br /><br />I was usually very groggy in the AM.  I drank several cups of coffee to wake up, and then I was anxious for the rest of the day.  I was in Sam's one day and there was a lady demonstrating ZIPFIZZ.  I tasted it and it wasn't too bad so I bought a box for 18 dollars.  I have been drinking it almost every day since.<br /><br />I drink half a serving every morning.  It works very quickly for me, and I am not jittery afterwards.  I have more energy and I am even more productive.  My mind is even clearer.<br /><br />I would recommend ZIPFIZZ to anyone looking for energy without the jitters of other energy drinks.  And Sam's seems to have the best price so far.

review/summary: Great substitute for Pepsi and other sodas
review/text: I am a Pepsi addict who is trying to reform. Zipfizz is being a big help in that process. It's easy to carry around, and when I eat out, I ask for an extra glass of water "to mix with my vitamins." I request a separate glass of ice to be added once it is mixed up. Be sure to drink the water down one to two inches from the rim so the fizz has somewhere to go! One of the things I love about soda is the fizz and the "burn" as it goes down my throat. There's just enough fizz in this stuff to give me some of those sensations, and to help me avoid sodas. I don't drink Zipfizz for the energy, and can't say I've noticed any increase in energy, or relief from fatigue, but that's not what I'm drinking it for!  I LOVE the grape flavor. It reminds me almost exactly of the Grapette I loved as a child. I had been craving it for years, but couldn't find any. Zipfizz Grape really works for me. The orange flavor reminds me of Orange Crush. Sometimes I use about half orange juice, half water to mix it with. That makes it taste more "orangy," and mellows it out a bit.  Citrus and Pink Lemonade are decent flavors, too. I usually add a little extra lemon juice to them, just for more kick. Occasionally, I add a splash of Diet 7-Up or Sprite, or other lemon-lime soda just to change it up a little. Yum!!<br /><br />I buy the grape and orange flavors at my local Sam's Club for about $20 per box of 20. Those are the only two flavors they carry. Citrus and Pink Lemonade, I have to buy online.<br /><br />Thanks to Zipfizz, I'm now drinking about two to four Pepsi*s a week instead of one or two a day!<br /><br />I love the little tubes that Zipfizz comes in, and save them to reuse. They are great for carrying aspirin, or other pills. I take the labels off once I've used the Zipfizz, and put on plain labels so I can mark what I have filled the tubes with. Some I use for the powdered CranAloe drink I take. The tubes are also useful for holding little safety pins, straight pins and needles, toothpicks, salt and/or pepper, sweetener, craft beads, etc. I filled one with my favorite seasoned salt so I can carry it to use when I eat out. At Halloween, I don't give out candy ... I give out the freebies I collect all year long ... bookmarks, keychains, pens and pencils, rulers, kid's meal toys, note pads, AND these little tubes. The kids love them!!

review/summary: Sunshine in a bottle!
review/text: This drink makes me feel like sunshine! Some mornings are hard for me to get up; I feel heavy, slow and sluggish both mentally and physically. And if it's dark outside in the winter, it is even more difficult for me to get out of bed. Zipfizz helps me to "wake up" so I can get started on my day instead of conking out under the covers because I couldn't get out of bed fast enough once I've turned my alarm off. I've always used Zipfizz. I didn't know there was a letdown until I tried 5 Hour Energy which kicked in for about 2.5 hours and then I started feeling sluggish again. Zipfizz gives you enough to help your own body to get itself going so that it can keep going.<br /><br />The taste is nothing great though. Don't buy the powdered drink mix. Buy the drink shot (the tubes) instead to get through it quickly.

review/summary: Best Energy Drink Around With No Sugar
review/text: Zipfizz is a great tasting easy to use energy drink.  The price per unit is less expensive than other bottled energy drinks.  Just mix it into a 12 or 16 oz bottle of purified water and shake.  One word of caution, you need to take a couple of swigs from your water bottle before you pour in the Zipfizz, or you will have an eruption of the flavored mix, two or three tablespoons should be adequate.  My favorite flavors are the Berry and Grape.

review/summary: The best flavor.
review/text: Grape zipfizz will not dissapoint. It is the least bitter out of their lineup and gives you a great energy boost that doesn't knock you out in 2 hours. I also like how I can fill up a bottle with it instead of having a shot like those other drinks. I like to enjoy it and sip slowly, not just shoot it down and be done with it. I also feel slowly drinking an energy drink evenly will lead to a longer buzz and energetic feeling with less comedown. A+++ for this product.

review/summary: Great energy booster
review/text: Ultimately, I think personal preference is going to play the main role in whether or not you will like Zipfizz over any other energy drink.  That said, here is what I have experienced<br /><br />Energy Boost<br />For me it gives a nice boost of energy, equivalent to a full cup of coffee.  It seems to last around 5 hours for me without a crash at the end.  I think this is where individuals will have the most variance, as caffeine reacts differently in different people depending on the product.  For example, I don't like what a Diet Coke does to me but I like this.<br /><br />Flavor<br />The flavor is great because it is not overpowering and not to subtle either.  Since it is a mix, you can add more or less water to get the flavor you desire.  I have tried grape, orange, and lemonade.  Grape is my favorite, although an interesting twist on orange is to add a bit of vanilla creamer - it makes for a tasty Creamsicle flavored treat<br /><br />Zipfizz vs 5-hour energy<br />5-hour energy also has the desired energy boost for me, however, it tends to leave me with cotton mouth.  Zipfizz does not do that since it is mixed with water.  I prefer the added hydration.<br /><br />Lastly, often times I only use half of a canister with 16 oz of water.  This helps maximize the value of the product and for me only half of the canister is plenty of an energy boost.

review/summary: Not All Natural
review/text: This product works but the advertising is misleading. Zipp Fizz claims that it's a natural product and on its website says that it is sweetened with xylitol.  Xylitol is a natural sugar made from the birch tree, and used in Europe for over 100 years.  I use xylitol on a regular basis and agree that if it comes from the right source and not from China, where it's made from corn, it is healthy and has very good side effects such as cavity prevention.  But,on the ingredients list, xylitol is the last ingredient, meaning, that it is the smallest ingredient in the formula.  On the other hand Sucralose (also known as Splenda) is very high on the list of ingredients.  That's where the aftertaste is from.  If you don't care what you put in your body then this is a good product as it does work as advertised.  Why add Splenda if the xylitol is in there? Because the splenda is cheaper. So obviously there is no need for the xylitol other than to use it as a marketing ploy.  They know this and have told me that their new product - immune fizz - has no Splenda.  Why not take it out of the regular zipp fizz too and make it healthier too?  I was sucked into the purchase by the xylitol reference only to find the sucralose in the product.  I wonder what else they aren't saying?

review/summary: Grape Disappointment
review/text: I don't feel like I represent the general masses, but the grape is definitely NOT the best flavor out there.  In fact, I'd say it's maybe 3rd best.  The taste was just mundane to me.  I like the fact that the other flavors have a little bit of sweet/tart flavor to them so I don't feel like I'm drinking sugar-free Kool-Aid or Crystal Lite.  I would suggest that first time drinkers go with the Pink Lemonade, Berry, or Orange Soda.

review/summary: Zipfizz grape-
review/text: I was afraid at firt to try this- I really hate the artificial grape taste of most grape juices and products. This, however, was light- not too sweet. It was a perfect offset to the already existing flavors of Zipfizz- orange, lemon, pink lemonade. (All of which are very tart!)<br />As for energy, this product delivers! I first tried Zipfizz under skepticism, but I was completely and pleasantly surprised that after a thirteen hour work day, I went to the gym right after work that night, and had a nice little burst of energy that lasted as long as I needed it to. There are also no rapid heartbeats, palpitations of the heart or crashes, as the product is made with all natural ingredients. That in itself is a sheer bonus, on top of the fact that there is no sugar or artificial sources of taurine and caffiene.<br />If you despise the taste and the artificial contents of stuff like Red Bull and Rock Star and want an actual energy drink that works as promised, then try Zipfizz, you'll be glad you did.<br />Did I mention it's also packed with vitamins? Those other "energy drinks" can't say that!<br />>>>>>>>

review/summary: first energy drink i've tried
review/text: i have been clean and sober almost 23 yrs. and never got into energy drinks but the local wal mart was giving free samples, small cups so i took one, i felt kind of tired but after drinking just a small cup, felt 'great' body and mind so, i bought a 3 pack. 4.88, they only have grape and i've never liked grape, anything but it was o.k. but kind of expensive for 3 drinks but i figured if that tiny cup made me feel, 'that' good, each tube would last me a while.  i gave 4 stars because in my experience, when it gets too 'hot', the tube,  on two occasions, i put one in my pocket, pulled it out later to pour into a cold bottle of water and even though i poured some of the water out of the bottle, it FIZZED UP AND OUT and made a mess, i think the GOOD STUFF gets lost when this happens, has only happened when it was hot and i did not feel ANYthing after, NO ZIPP, like it all came out.  i am going to try just drinking the amount i drank in the 'sample cup' maybe drinking the whole tube, is too much for me becasue i noticed i get almost wired and that's something i don't want to be, any more, just feel 'good'

Not to mention the taste---it is amazing :). Pink Lemonade is my personal favorite, but they are all excellent! I stopped drinking energy drinks because of how bad they are for you and I actually began getting sick (headaches, nauseas) everytime I had one. I started drinking zipfizz and feel better than ever. It is also a good alternative to "pre-work out" supplements. Sometimes those supplements give you too much of a high that makes it hard to come down from. I now use zipfizz before working out too :)!

I like that zip fizz is 1/3 the cost of 5 hour energy.  Stay away from the Orange.  It tastes awful.  Grape and Pink Lemonade taste great.

The warmer it gets, the more it will taste like the smell inside a bottle of vitamins, which is very disgusting.<br />-It's a bit expensive for what it's intended for and a case of 20 doesn't last long.<br />-If you dump the tube all at once into a bottle of water, it will fizz out all over the place unless you put the cap back on extremely fast. Even if you drink several gulps of water out of the bottle first, it still happens.

review/summary: Grape is my favorite Zipfizz flavor!
review/text: As I am sitting here at work, using company resources and time to write this, I felt compelled to see if there was a multi-pack of zipfizz in the grape flavor only. I've only been able to find zipfizz in the multi-flavor pack with pink lemonade (my least favorite), orange soda (pretty good), and grape (my fave!). I don't drink coffee, and I'm exploring ways to wean myself from the diet soda teat. I love how drinking zipfizz makes me feel like I'm taking my multivitamin. I add to mix by brewing a strong cup of matcha green tea and adding it to the bottle with the zipfizz. Tastes great! It also keeps me from falling asleep at my computer by 2:30pm. :)<br /><br />Bottom line, if I had to choose one energy drink, I would choose zipfizz. If I had to choose one flavor, it would most definitely be grape. Love it!

review/summary: Pleasant tasting with a nice energy buzz.
review/text: As someone who doesn't get nearly enough sleep, I am always looking for an effective and tasty caffeine boost. Problem is, I don't like the taste of coffee, and soda has high calories-to-caffeine ratio. Energy drinks typically have a chemical taste that doesn't sit well with me. The Zipfizz Grape Energy Drink Mix provides an excellent boost of energy, yet tastes pretty good. I get as much energy from one tube than I would from a cup of coffee or Red Bull. If you've had a five-hour energy shot you'll understand the type of boost you get from a Zipfizz. It has no calories from sugar, and is low carb, plus since you are mixing it with water you stay pretty hydrated. One caveat: do not drink one of these in the evening unless you plan on staying up really late; I drank one at about 6pm and was up past 3am. Thankfully, I didn't feel jittery or irritable, just WIDE awake. Also, other reviews have mentioned that this keeps you regular, and yes it does indeed.

review/summary: does what it says, decent taste
review/text: I drink zip fizz mostly while biking.  With all these products the question of taste is critical and personal.  The product has a decent artificial grape taste- similar to grape soda.  IMPORTANT FACT:  It is much better when ice cold.  Be sure to mix it with ice or freezing cold water- all zip fizz products taste better cold than at room temperature.

review/text: love this flavor. my other favorite is mixed berry.<br />flavor is not too strong, just enough<br />for new users: great way to boost b vitamin intake, does not give you an energy buzz of any kind that ive noticed but ive always taken supplements and eaten healthy, so thats probably why. for me its an easy better absorbing, non stomach upsetting way to get vitamins. pills go right through you and often give you indigestion

review/text: I love this product. Zipfizz gives me what I need to make it through the day at work. The flavors are all great. My favorite is the pink lemonaid. I usually drink it down pretty fast. My body and mind feel instantly better, almost more alive. Then later on there is no crash. I never notice when exactly it wears off. I never feel the jitters or have a racing heart. This product works wonderful. I do not ever want to be without it. Yippy Zippy  8>)

review/summary: My Morning Coffee
review/text: I have two small children and Zip Fizz gets me up in the morning.  I first bought Zip Fizz at Costco, but wasn't a fan of one of the flavors that came in the variety pack.  Berry wasn't available at Costco so on to Amazon I went.  The berry flavor is my second favorite flavor after orange.  My shipment arrived quickly which was a big bonus for this tired Mommy.  Buy it, you won't be sorry!

review/summary: Great Then NOT
review/text: I first started using Zipfizz about 2-3 years ago and enjoyed during that time period HOWEVER, I don't know if they changed something in the formula or what but now I cannot drink it without side effects. It use to give me the extra kick and energy I needed... through the morning... another through the afternoon. RECENTLY though when I drink just a small amount I get 'VERTIGO' which will last for a few days, actually causing me to miss 2 days of work. I fell ok when I am sitting or lying down, but when I stand I am dizzy and it lasts for days. Also, the muscles in the back and on the side of my neck ache, directly behind and below the back of my ears. This is still an after effect that has lasted since I first experienced this. After initially having the dizziness effect, a month later I wanted to put my theory to the test so I bought another box from my local Costco and took just a few drinks and AGAIN the same effects occurred causing me miss work. NOW I HAVE NEW INFORMATION - My 24 yr old son ( who occasionally would use Zipfizz ) has reported the same effect with his latest use of the product. This leads me to believe they have changed something... or there was ONE HUGE BAD BATCH of the stuff made somewhere. Draw your own conclusions, just my experience. Thanks, Don

I'm an energy freak and have tried MANY, so when I say I like it, it means the energy it gives is good enough no jitters and the taste is so much better than others i've tried.  My boyfriend tried it and the first thing he did was spit it right back out..lol...like I said everyone is different.

review/summary: High energy, taste is just okay
review/text: Zipfizz works for me! I am a busy working mom of two, and some days are definitely properly labeled as "zip fizz days." This product works; I learned the hard way never to take it after 5pm. I couldn't get to sleep until 2am despite how tired I was. The citrus taste reminds of grapefruit juice, of which I am not a fan. It tastes pretty good when added to cranberry fruit juice (instead of water). For my next purchase I will choose a different flavor.

review/summary: A good energy product needing a bit of caution
review/text: I tried this product at a local store and went back for 2 boxes because it is non-caffeine and non-sugar.  As a diabetic and someone who suffers from reflux, this is great.  And the $1 or so each is so much better than the $3 for those 5 hour drinks.<br /><br />A bit of common sense caution however; do NOT drink one close to the end of a work day no matter how much you need a pick me up.  I did that once, just once (never again) and I had difficulty sleeping.<br /><br />Second, if you are going to dump it into a bottle of water, drink about a quarter of the water (or pour it out) before adding.  The thing fizzes and can get quite messy.<br /><br />Third, do not take if you've an upset stomach or feeling nauseous as it can make one gassy.<br /><br />Otherwise, as I said, money wise, health wise, this $1 a pop, no sugar, no caffeine is great!

review/summary: Grape flavor is horrible; no energy boost at all
review/text: I've been drinking 2 energy drinks every morning. (2 for $5 at local convenience store.) I wanted to try something that would be a little cheaper so I bought a case of Grape Flavored ZipFizz.<br /><br />I chose grape because I drink bottled water flavor packets all the time and love the taste. However, the grape flavor of ZipFizz is just awful - its got to be the worst tasting thing I've ever drank. I can get used to the flavor after a while, I'm sure.<br /><br />I'm drinking my second bottle of this stuff today. (84,000% recommended daily amount of B12 anyone?) I don't feel any energy effects what so ever. No jitters, no boost of energy, nothing. Maybe they should scale back on the B12 and focus a little more on energy and taste?<br /><br />Maybe it's just me, but this stuff hasn't worked for me. I doubt I'll finish the entire case, I'm having problems just finishing this second bottle. It's a shame too since I really enjoy energy drinks overall. Having a powered form that I can toss into my bottle waters would have been very convenient for me.<br /><br />I'm giving it 2 stars because I'm generous.

review/summary: Almost, but not quite
review/text: There was this one energy drink I had been buying from Wal-mart.  It was the only place I could find it.  Then one day, it was pulled from the shelf in every single Wal-mart within an hours drive.  And that's a lot of Wal-marts!  This energry drink was quite possibly the best I had ever and will ever taste.  I could get a 10-pack for $1.50.  That price just couldn't be beat and it tasted great too.  The only place you can get it now is from a somewhat shady looking website that sells 10-packs for like $15.  So there I was energy drink-less.  I started looking online for alternatives and I came across Zipfizz.  I figured I'd check some local stores for small packs to sample and give it a try.<br /><br />I purchased this product as somewhat of a "blind buy."  I had tried the orange, citrus, and pink lemonade by purchasing small three packs at some of the local stores.  However, I wanted to try the grape and the berry.  The only way I was going to be able to do that was to buy them online.  So I went for the berry.  About the best I can say is it's not horrible.  Just like the others I had tried, it had a very strong B-vitamin taste to it.  It was very overpowering in this flavor.  Having tried those other flavors, I would have to say this is probably my least favorite.  As for the rest, the orange is definitely top notch.  There's hardly any B-vitamin taste to it as it is masked by the orange flavor.  The orange sort of reminds me more of orange popsicles or an orange flavored drink than it does of an actual orange.  But it's still pretty good.  The same can be said for citrus, it covers the B-vitamin flavor well.  It has a similar taste to the orange, but it tasted like there was some lemon and lime mixed in there.  It was pretty good.  The pink lemonade is pretty good, if you can get past the fact that it's a fizzy drink.  And that's exactly what it tasted like, a fizzy pink lemonade.  It just had a minor B-vitamin after taste to it.  I haven't yet tried the grape, but would still like to.  After my experience with the berry though, I'm not hopeful.  Orange is good enough for me for now and I've actually found it cheaper locally in the big 20-pack.
