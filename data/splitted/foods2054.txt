review/text: There was nothing wrong with these bisquits other than the fact that they stated clearly "Small Original Assortment" on the description, but when the package arrived, it was for Large Dogs.  I have pugs and they were too big for them.  I ended up having to break them all up to feed it to them.  Please ensure for future reference the description matches the product pictured.

review/summary: My favorite Triscuit!
review/text: Triscuits are great for snacks. This version, with cracked pepper and olive oil, has a little bite to each cracker. Thus, I enjoy eating them plain.<br /><br />However, Triscuits are even better when you add other components. One of my favorites is to cut a little piece of cheese and a small piece of onion to go on top of this Triscuit. Then, 25 seconds or so in the microwave (depending on the type of cheese being used) and a yummy little taste treat. I only do about four of these at one time. But the end result is pretty tasty.<br /><br />If I have some leftover chicken or pork, I will cut little pieces off and add to the topping.<br /><br />So, as noted, this is my favorite Triscuit and there are lots of ways of making it even tastier as a (pretty healthy) snack.

It's so bad.<br /><br />The tea + fruit + &lt;godknowswhatelse> combo comes out tasting like urine + gasoline + complex vitamins in a bottle with a pretty, but busy label.<br /><br />If you were looking for another option to Lifewater or Hint (or even Gatorade) this isn't it.<br /><br />If you are looking to have something in your house until the Zombie Apocalypse forces this to be the last beverage in your house (because no one will drink it until there are no alternatives remaining) like me, this is it.<br /><br />Take this one back to the drawing board. Or just sell it to people looking for Zombie Apocalypse guaranteed to be there water.

review/text: I never bought or ate wasabi flavored seaweed snacks before so I had no idea what they would be like. They are light, crispy, medium-hot spicy chips. Although they look light and flaky, they explode with flavor when you munch them. They also taste great in sandwiches and crumbled into salads. I paid around $10 for a pack of 12, using the coupon code ANNIECH8 plus the subscription discount.

review/summary: Great for people who don't like seaweed
review/text: Don't get me wrong, this snack does tastes like the seaweed it is.  BUT of all the seaweed snacks I've tried, and I've tried half a dozen at my local health food store, THIS is the one I decided to buy in bulk as a subscription on Amazon (FYI: I spend a fortune at that local health food store, so don't feel too sorry for it, and I have to strike a balance on spending somewhere!).  What makes this snack better than the others?  Three things: 1) the seaweed is in small sheets and is much thinner -- you don't get a big thick layer of it, 2) it has a great distracting hot & salty taste (salt & wasabi) that gives it a refreshing zing, and 3) it has nice crispiness.  I eat sea vegetables for general health (anti-cancer, etc.) and thyroid health.  A few sheets of these a day and I'm good.  For the first time  (not counting sushi) it's easy to eat my seaweed.

review/summary: Very good if you love wasabi flavor/bite and seaweed snacks in general
review/text: Only get these if you like the taste of wasabi. Although it's a bit more subtle then the wasabi that's dabbed on your sushi, you still definitely get the wasabi bite (they seem to be along the same line of the extra spicy wasabi covered peas, maybe a little bit saltier).  With subscribe and save, these packs come out to $1/pack which is quite a bit cheaper than what you spend outside Amazon (Whole Foods, Trader Joe's or supermarket) for this type of snack.  You do get quite a few sheets in each pack (20) and each one is seasoned with the perfect amount of spicy/hot wasabi and salt.  They are also nice and crunchy since they are packaged separately, and they do not seem as greasy as some other brands I've tried from the Asian markets. Although they are not greasy, one package (which contains two 10-sheet servings) has a total of 4 grams of fat (which is a little above my 3 gram target for low fat foods and unfortunately I cannot eat only half a pack.  They seem to lose their crunchiness once they're opened...that's my excuse for eating the entire pack and I'm sticking to it).

I've also put them in bagels with cream cheese.  Only complaint is on the packaging.  I probably will sort of reduce my purchasing... I think I can replicate the flavors with nori seaweed sheets, sea salt and wasabi powder.  Will also be doing the environment a favor.

review/summary: Inconsistent Taste
review/text: I first tasted Annie Chun's seaweed three years ago while in California. It was delicious, especially the Wasabi, so I purchased about ten packs. After returning home, I found it could be ordered from Amazon at a very reasonable price and have purchased them regularly ever since. NO MORE! The last shipment contained a few packages that did not smell right. The pieces of seaweed had a dull, grey coating on them. They tasted terrible. I blew it off the first couple of times and went ahead with another shipment. Last night I opened a container that smelled of burning plastic. The pieces were once again dull and appeared to have a grey coating on them. The coating, unfortunately, was not wasabi. It is strange that not all of the packages have the smell or coating on them, but now I am uncomfortable eating the product. I trusted Annie Chun's product but have decided to stop purchasing it, going with my intuition that there is a problem at the source they are not addressing.

review/summary: Perfect snack when I'm craving salt
review/text: I keep my pantry stocked with these snacks.  At 60 calories a package, I can eat the whole thing (or even 2 or 3 of them) and not have blown my diet. When a friend told me about them, I thought, "I'm not sure if I like seaweed", but I tried them just so I could say I tried them.  They are so good.  The sesame oil really gives them a good flavor and they satisfy my salt cravings.  My husband loves them too. I can't believe he grabs them for a snack now too.  We're both eating healthier thanks to these snacks.<br /><br />You can find them at the health food stores in the Asian section (Walmart might even have them - I haven't looked in their Asian section).  That way you can try them before ordering a case.<br /><br />I like them so much that I have them ordered on automatic shipment now.  I tried other brands, but Annie Chun's is the best one by far.

They had products from several manufacturers, so we tried a bunch. They ALL basically tasted the same, so we now just buy the ones that are on sale. They are under $4.00 for 8 pack and 10 pack units (depending on the brand). THIS IS MUCH CHEAPER THAN THE PRICE OF THESE ON AMAZON. Since we eat these all the time, this is much more economical for us. My wife hates the "fresh" taste of fish, but she loves these, so I am surprised that people found them too "fishy".

review/summary: Mediocre for Seaweed Snacking
review/text: This is one of many varieties of seaweed snacks I've tried in my life. Most of them I get from the Japanese market, which also remain hit and miss.  This particular brand makes the seaweed snacks too potently flavored with wasabi.  The coating is uneven among several packages I've consumed.  In general, the wasabi dusting overpowers the seaweed and you lose track of the main product.<br /><br />Considering taste as well as value, I rank these are poor if you have local means to pick up some seaweed snacks.  If you aren't near an Asian market, these will do but I might try to find a non-wasabi version.  These are overpowering as well as a tad too salty for my taste.

These have some serious wasabi heat, especially if you eat more than one at a time. I think they are a perfect snack. Now if you are looking for something to replace BBQ potatoe chips than you will surely be disappointed. I on the other had find these tastey and addictive. I will be getting more because I see myself going through these 12 bags very quickly.

review/summary: the gold standard for wasabi seaweed
review/text: These are identical to the excellent Trader Joe's wasabi seaweed; they clearly come from the same source. They are spicy without being painful, and they dissolve on the tongue. I am totally addicted. Per the sharply divergent reviews on this page, not everybody likes seaweed and even those that do don't necessarily like the spicy variety. Try one before buying a crate of it. However, if you do like the spicy stuff, you won't find any better than this.<br /><br />Also, Amazon's prices are excellent -- a 12-pack that costs $20 from Annie Chun directly costs only $15 here.

review/summary: Hotter than other brands.  Delicious!
review/text: I love the taste of seaweed and wasabi, and have an unsatisfiable love for spicy foods.  I have had other brands of wasabi seaweed snacks, and these are by FAR the spiciest.  I saw someone mention that the spice is variable, so it's possible I've eaten extra spicy packs, I suppose, but these have enough kick to "clear your sinuses".  If you like your spicy food no hotter than "medium" you will probably find these too spicy.  If you love hot foods, you'll probably be pleased that these are hotter than most "hot" chips (including potato chips) you've tried.  These are also less greasy than other brands of seaweed snacks.<br /><br />I love them.  Seaweed isn't for anyone as people mentioned.  Sure it tastes fishy.  Do you like the tase of the seaweed in sushi?  If you haven't tried sushi, then this might not be the best intro to seaweed.  If you have had sushi and you particularly like or dislike the seaweed taste there, that should predict pretty well whether you'll like these.  For me, these easily remind me of the taste of sushi with wasabi.<br /><br />I love these and will be buying more.

review/summary: DELICIOUSLY ADDICTIVE snack!!
review/text: I first got hooked on the plain version of these from Trader Joe's; from there, I found the Wasabi flavor at Whole Foods and what can I say: I'm completely ADDICTED!! These are light, flavorful sheets that pack a nice kick with the spicy flavor. These are indeed 'fishy' in taste - hence the SEAweed taste... you know, from the SEA?? But it's not a rancid taste or anything like that. If you don't like the taste of fish, these and other SEAweed products are probably are not for you, but if you enjoy a nice Asian-themed snack, these are PERFECT!! Ordering them on Amazon is definitely a savings over Whole Foods and so far - several orders later - I haven't had any problems with quality, cost or shipment.

review/summary: What's not to like about these? (...other than the addiction!)
review/text: Well, I suppose if you don't like spicy food, these might not be your thing. And if you don't like wonderfully tasty, crispy (and healthy!) snacks, they might not be your thing either!<br /><br />But I'm guessing you already passed these by if you fall into the former category, and I'm guessing not many people fit into the latter.<br /><br />My only complaint with these is that the wasabi coating seems to be slightly variable on them, as in I'll have one piece that's moderately hot, and then another that's really not at all. These are horribly addictive too, so it's not like I can just eat a couple of them anyways! They're fairly healthy, which makes me not feel as bad about sucking down a whole pack, but my wallet is more of a limiting factor than my appetite on buying these damn things!<br /><br />In short, these are tasty but moderately spicy. If you like wasabi, you'll love them. If you like seaweed (in whatever form; seaweed salad, on/around your sushi, etc), you'll love them. If you think you hate seaweed since it sounds icky, I bet you'll still love them!

review/text: I'd never tried flavored, roasted seaweed snacks before (however, do love seaweed and make our own sushi) but ordered both the Sesame and Wasabi due to low price and good reviews. Loved them! Love the Wasabi due to the Wasabi flavor/spiciness. The spiciness definitely adds up as you are eating them and will clear your sinuses after awhile but I think it's great! Love the Sesame due to the saltier flavor. I acknowledge I may be odd for that but I've always been a salt fan and these are so much better than chips! Only one of my co-workers was a fan but my BF loves them as well as one of his co-workers. Just ordered another case of each for us and his co-worker.

review/summary: Seaweed snacks, Wasabi flavor
review/text: Be aware that these are the type of thing you probably either really like or really don't like, and if you don't care for sushi you probably won't like these. Yes, that sounds like a "Duh" statement, but they really are sort of fishy. Crispy texture, and a nice little wasabi kick, but don't let them sit on your tongue too long or they sort of melt and taste very seaweedy. My husband spit out his one and only taste, but I thought they were pretty good. On the other hand, a co-worker actually gagged and wiped her tongue after one bite. Very crunchy and thin, but a little bit goes a long way for me. I don't think I'll order them again simply because I'd eat them occasionally but not as my first choice for a snack. I do like the wasabi tingle, but I'll stick to wasabi peas.

review/summary: Wasabi!
review/text: These wasabi flavored roasted seaweeds are okay. I love roasted seaweed; Its my favorite snack. Normally I eat the sesame or teriyaki flavored. However, because this was fairly cheap for the amount, I bought the wasabi flavored. Wasabi is a moderate (for some mild) spicy tasting spice from the wasabi plant. The spicyness was not the problem; it just....tastes okay. Its a little strong, and its actually more spicy for the nose than the mouth (if you inhale it, it's not a pleasant feeling, but I don't know why anyone would just sniff it). Anyway, i love roasted seaweed, but wasabi is just okay.

review/text: These seaweed snacks are prepared well and packaging is great. You just have to LIKE seaweed and wasabi in a paper-thin crispy/flakey form. Sounded good, but it's an acquired taste, and we've decided after trying them that perhaps the folks at work would like them better.  We left the case in the break room.  So far, no takers.

review/text: I love wasabi sauce on my sushi and my sister made a great oriental seaweed salad for a hogroast last year that had me thinking this would be a product I would enjoy...  Well once you get past the slight amount of heat from the wasabi (sorry I eat habeneros so yes slight heat) it tasted like burnt rubber.  I brought the box into work from there and it sat for a couple months (within which time a couple people opened and tried 2 of the packages)  After that it made its way to the trash can as nobody wanted to eat it.<br /><br />I really am surprised by some of the reviews on here saying its delicious though...  Maybe I just got a bad pack, or maybe its a case of the shill...  Either way Ill stick with wasabi peas for a quick snack and just wait to get my seaweed fix with my sisters salad or at the local sushi bar piled with the nearly tear bringing wasabi they have there.

They help when you crave a small, salty snack. I devoured mine before I could try them on a turkey sandwich, so that'll be my next thing when I buy them again. Mmmmm.

I can still taste the fish and it's been over an hour since I last ate one.  They are super super thin, almost like eating tissue paper. When I first picked one up and placed it into my mouth, my lips started burning. Yes I know they contain Wasabi, but I just didn't expect it to burn my mouth. After a minute or two the burning sensation subsiding. Judging from the picture on the front of the package I was expecting these to be crunchy and not tissue thin. I won't be buying these again.

They are not hot like eating straight wasabi, or watery eye inducing hot like someone drunk made your maki rolls, but the taste is certainly there in every bite.<br /><br />DH loved them after putting his nose up at first bite. After that, he would eat an entire pack in one sitting. I thought that these were a little expensive for the quanitiy but they seem to be very good quality. They are nice and thin and a good way to get rid of the munchies without eating tons of sugars.<br /><br />My final thoughts - if you like sushi or the wasabi crackers by Hapi or Rolands Feng Shui, you will likely love these little rectangular firecrackers to add some variety. Enjoy!

They are very light and only 30 calories for 1 serving (half the package).  If you happen to take a breath when putting one in your mouth, watch out because you will get a wasabi attack in your nostrils.  If you've ever had a little too much wasabi on your sushi, you'll know what I mean.  These are so tasty and the only bad thing about them is that when I eat them, I crave sushi.  These are very appetizing and I would recommend that you buy a single package first if you've never tried them.  If you've had nori snacks before and like the kick that wasabi gives you, you won't be dissapointed in these.  These are amazing.

They have a nice wasabi flavor, strong, but not so hot that it would prevent you from just downing the whole package at once. (Well, not for me anyway. But I am a bit of a wasabi addict.)<br /><br />That said, they are so ephemeral as to be unsatisfying. A better idea might be to wrap these around sushi rice for impromptu maki.

I can't eat them straight out of the package, it's too intense for me.  I've had to find other creative uses for them...adding to soups or pasta dishes or on top of a salad.  I purchased these with the intention of eating them as a snack replacement for potato chips.  Sadly, not an option with this flavor, so I won't be purchasing these again.

The wasabi flavor was not the problem - the dead fish flavor was. As a previous reviewer stated so eloquently, "Granted I've never tried water used to clean fish guts which has been sitting out in the hot sun for three days but I imagine if I were to drink this water, it would taste like these snacks."  So true - TOTALLY DISGUSTING!!!  It took brushing my teeth FIVE times to that nasty taste out of my mouth. I would rate it zero if I could & Amazon should not carry this item because it reflects poorly on them.

review/summary: Two words...Not good!
review/text: There are so many other things you could eat instead of these "snacks" to feel healthy and proactive about your health.  I was really excited to try these after reading some of the reviews.  I like unique flavors, seaweed and wasabi included.  These see through, tissue paper thin wisps are perhaps the worst thing I have ever eaten.  Granted I've never tried water used to clean fish guts which has been sitting out in the hot sun for three days but I imagine if I were to drink this water, it would taste like these snacks.  At best, there is a hint of wasabi which is so short lived there is no way to mask the awful taste.  Find something else to snack on, anything, you'll be very glad you did.<br /><br />Now I just have to find some kind of craft project to do with ALL these little tiny sheets of seaweed I've purchased.  Perhaps a paper mache project...

review/text: Pros: low carb, seaweed nutrition.<br /><br />Cons: thin as paper cannot be used as chip substitute, horrid-horrid fish taste.<br /><br />After eating through 75% of 1 package I became violently ill and spent the day vomiting. Either I am intolerant of something in these (not likely eat seaweed often) or I got a bad package... Seriously, my body clenches when I think of the horror of these things.<br /><br />I am NOT a picky eater, but these are inedible in my opinion.

review/summary: Not for me
review/text: Arg ... I read all the reviews, there seemed to be so many talking about the great taste, and the best on the market ... for those of you that do like seaweed, this very well could be the best on the market and tastey ... for me, I had never tried it, and was just looking for a different, healthy, low-calorie snack ... ummm, they were awful. It's partially my own stupidity, I don't like seafood, and I should have thought that "sea" weed might taste a little like seafood .. it does. So, if you don't like a seafoody taste then don't "try" this snack.

Name brands aren't important to me as price, but some items like corn do taste different under different labels.<br />The cans arrived promptly in advertised condtion without dents. No issues here. Whether you're stocking your home or emergency survival kit, I recommend this item without hesitation.

Sometimes they will eat another type of treat but after 1 or 2 days, they refuse to eat anymore. These are the best!<br /><br />ps: when your cat gets bored with a favorite toy, don't throw it out. Put it away in a closet for a few months & one day when they seem bored again, bring it out of the closet and give it to them. They will be excited about it again. Cats are like kids so rotate the toys and everyone will be happy.

review/text: My cat enjoys these, and buying them off Amazon saves money, but I've noted she's less enthusiastic about this flavor, and she'll only eat it if we're out of every other treat and she's completely desperate not to eat her regular food.  It's not just my cat either; my friend's cat doesn't like them as much as the ones in the orange or blue bags.  Stay away from the cheese flavored ones in the yellow bag; I can only assume they're really gross as they just set in the dish, untouched.

review/text: I'm glad other people's cat liked these, but my cats are both indifferent to them. I got these because my cat went crazy over the cheese puff treats I bought at Target, I think they are call crispies or something. They literally almost ripped the bag apart when it was left closed sitting on the counter because they can smell it through the bags. I have 2 kittens and they fought each other whenever I grab for the bag, no other time do they act like this it's almost as if it's drugs or something. I was hoping for the same effect with these, but my kittens both treat these like it's slightly tastier dry food. P.S. I have 1 himalayan and 1 orange tabby.
