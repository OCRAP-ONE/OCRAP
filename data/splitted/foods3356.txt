review/summary: Excellent for good health of cat
review/text: After a year on kitten food, one of my two cats began to get rather chubby.  He had a hard time hauling himself up onto one of the cat perches in the house.  We switched to this food when they hit their one-year birthday, and my little chubby cat began to lose weight.  Now, a year later, the indoor cat formula is all they eat, and my cat can jump up to the top bunk of the cat perch with no problems at all.  He has an all-star physique.  I do have to say, they preferred the kitten food too at first, but when given no other options, they eat this food with no problems.  If you look at the nutritional content of the food, indoor cat formula has very little fat, while kitten food is quite high in it.  Oh, and I've also seen *maybe* one hairball in the last year.  Not bad.

review/summary: Good Food
review/text: Science Diet has always been known for decent quality food to feed your cat or dog.  This product is no different.  I have a finicky cat who will only eat certain types of dry food and this seems to be one of them.  She took right to the dry without any hesitation and seems to continue to enjoy it.<br /><br />On the downside is the size of the food.  The food comes in large triangular shaped pieces that some cats may not like.  Buy a small bag and try it for your pet.<br /><br />4/5 stars for the size of the food and the price tag.

review/summary: Saved my Cat
review/text: This product was recommended by my vet, and literally saved my cat's life. I was very worried and was willing to try any diet on the market. Really, I have tried many diets etc but nothing seemed to help out my cat after the sudden onset of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).  I have no idea of where that came from. I always gave him clean water; fresh food etc but this caught me off guard. I have been feeding him "Friskies" prior to Hill's and everything was fine until one weekend. After a couple of days of feeding him, I noticed an immediate difference. My cat was no longer passing soft stools (diarrhea), and was eating as he normally did. The diet also seems to have been helping him regulate his weight also. He was a very big guy (~20 lbs) but now he is down to 16, after about 4 months on Hill's. Thumbs up and 5 stars for this product!

review/text: Ok cats, you can stop wiggling and showing me your lovely bellies, and get up and play.<br /><br />Let's get down to the nitty gritty. Hill's Science Diet Adult Hairball Control Dry Cat Food does what it says it does and MORE!!!<br /><br />Now, I DO feed my cats wet food, so I give them Hill's Science Diet Adult Hairball Control Dry Cat Food as a TREAT and a SUPPLEMENT -- and it is powerful stuff!! To be graphic, let's just say that Big Bad Baby Twinkle's poops used to look like small rocks, no matter what I did for her food (and she loves her daily hairball gel too) -- but NOW after feeding her even a small amount of Hill's Science Diet Adult Hairball Control Dry Cat Food (twice a day after she eats her wet food) one look at her litterbox and I think that a German Shepherd has visited the litterbox. To say that this makes me happy may sound wierd but now I KNOW that "stuff" is moving THROUGH her intestines and not getting impacted or staying inside and creating toxins.<br /><br />The same for Cee Cee kitty -- she, who is daaainty and small (BBBT weighs twice as much as Cee Cee and is twice as long as Cee Cee), also pops out some big ones now. I am happy -- yes I am -- this means their intestinal transit time (from eating to pooping) is shorter and they are healthier for it.

review/text: My cat loves this cat food! He likes the big chunks and if I mix it with another variety which is smaller nuggets he sifts through and pulls out the bigger oral care pieces. Another plus - my cat is 13 and has never had his teeth cleaned. The Vet believes the oral care chunks have been beneficial in keeping down the tartar on his teeth.

review/text: This is the only flavor of Science Diet (or any other brand) they will all eat without complaint. I don't know what I'll do if they stop making it. I have 3 cats, two Maine Coons who get hairballs, and this stuff really works to prevent that. As long as they eat some of it daily no more hairballs on the floor. It's a great product. I hope they never try to "improve" the recipe or change it in any way, or my cats will probably reject it as they have so many others! If it ain't broke please don't fix it, Science Diet! It's a winner as is.

There are 2 otherss.  1 is Purina 1 Sensitive which is also great.  the other is a Royal Canin Oral Sensitive.  I think the Science Diet and the Purina 1 are the best.  We also give the cat Prednisolone under a Vet prescription, as the vet said it was inflamatory bowel disease.

review/text: I had to stop giving my  15 year old cat dry food because he could no longer hold it down (even the ones with only whole food ingredients were too hard on his system).  He would even throw up blood clots if I had to leave him with dry food for a couple of days.  His stool became loose and smelled even worse than usual.  I gave him this on a trip that I had to bring him along with me and he has been doing great on it. His stool is hard now and he holds it down.

review/summary: Bought this for the Fiber
review/text: Was feeding my 3 cats - Blue Buffalo Blue Wilderness Chicken Dry Cat Food - which is one of the best brands out there... No grain, all meat, blah blah.  Cats loved it over all the other 'meat only' brands...<br /><br />Only problem was... soft stools...  Talked to the vet and she said that sometimes cats need some form of fiber, even if it isn't nutritious, it helps to bulk up the stools and get rid of the God awful odor...<br /><br />So went up and down the food aisle and this particular brand/version had the highest fiber content of all of the bags of food.  The BWC food has 3.5% fiber... This indoor cat food has 10% fiber... yes it is indigestible corn... that's the whole idea... a form of roughage to helps the bowels.  This food also has added fiber on top of the corn stuff etc...<br /><br />So I'm going to see if this helps with the soft very stinky stools... if it does, I'm sticking with it.<br /><br />So far the cats haven't seemed to mind the larger kibble size.  They chomp a piece in half, and eat both halves...

review/text: My cat has gingivitis, and he's only 2. My vet prescribed fancy expensive food that you can only get from a vet. I did some research, and this stuff is made by the same company, with a nearly identical ingredients list. While i was mixing in his old food with this stuff to acclimate him, he'd pick out the new food until he ate it all, leaving behind his purina!<br />As far as helping his gingivitis, it's helped a little. The plaque has gone down considerably, but the gumline is still reddish. He really loves this stuff, so I'll probably buy this again.

review/summary: My kitty LOVES it.
review/text: The story goes that I adopted a cat from an agency last summer. Having always grown up with dogs and not cats, I went ahead and wandered down to my Target to get a bag of Friskies. About a week later, my kitty (named Sugar) starting vomiting. Confused, I assumed it was the wet food we were feeding her in the morning. So we changed it. Then we changed it again. No results. I took her to the vet and asked. He checked her out and said likely the problem was having a sensitive stomach and he recommended Science Diet. Bam. My cat does great now. She's lost a little bit of weight so she's the right size now. She doesn't vomit anymore. This food works and it works well. I read the negative review here and I would say the problem was unique to the cat. My cat loves it and is doing brilliantly now.

review/summary: The worst snap-lock reseal ever made?
review/text: I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.<br /><br />I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.<br /><br />I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.<br /><br />Theo.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: Worst Junk Food Ever
review/text: I have two cats and have always been feeding them this food,one is 5 and the other 9 years old and they are both 15 pounds.So they are fat and I could never figure out why,since they only got to share on cup between each other all day.So about two weeks ago I did some research on this food and my eyes were opened.I feel horrible that I fed them this junk food and I thought I was giving them the Best out there,since my Vet gave it to me and said it was great for them.<br />So anyways my male cat is now on Wellness Indoor dry and expensive wet food like Blue Buffalo,Wellness and Merrick.He loves it and I had no problem switching him over and I already notice the difference in his energy level.But my biggest issue is my female cat,she will not touch any other food than her Science junk food.I tried mixing it with the new food,starting at 75% old to 25% new,nothing she wouldn't touch it.So I tried 90% to 10%,still nothing.She cried and wined and didn't eat one morsel in four days and was just laying in one spot all day having even less energy than before.So I called my new Vet and she said now it is getting dangerous because she wouldn't eat at all.I had to give her her old junk food back,because I did not want her to die.I have no idea what to do,she is so addicted to this food and I can't get her of it.She hates wet food with a passion.I am worried about Diabetes if she will get any bigger.So I am really sad that nothing seems to work with her.<br />I made her a junk food addict,it's my fault.I wish I never started her on this food at all.

Rice is ok but not as a first ingredient in a cat food; meat by-product is sketchy in general in a food this expensive; corn meal I have no great opinion of, but whatever; but the 4th ingredient - powdered cellulose - is sawdust. SAWDUST is not what I want to feed my cat, even to help her lose weight.<br /><br />No wonder this food feels so "light" physically.  The color is lighter, and it is less dense than normal food because it's truly just fillers.<br /><br />I give it a second extra star because my cat would willingly eat this food and didn't seem to mind a whole lot, but I switched her (50/50 at first) to Blue Buffalo, which has real food ingredients and which she actually does prefer.

They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food.  This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school.  Then they sell the cat food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness.  Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat.  Please try another brand like orijen or evo.  your cat will thank you.

review/summary: Toasted Corn and Rice for Cats!
review/text: I was given a sample by my vet and my cats LOVED the stuff. I immediately saw that the amount they ate of this food was much more than their usual grain-free food, they seemed to be starving and feeding all the time. They also became less energized than usual, my cats are Siamese and are constantly running after each other and very active with their toys. They became lethargic and were not as interested in their usual activities. I called my vet and she suggested catnip and not to worry, hmm, never needed catnip before...<br /><br />Well I did worry, and did my research. Online I found that Science Diet's pride and joy is their belief in using corn and other grains, you also need a chemistry major in order to fully understand their ingredient list. Last time I checked my cats were obligate carnivores and was distressed that such a food was suggested, no less by my vet. Further research I found that the reason Science Diet is so recommended by vets is because Science Diet spends quite a bit of money in the major vet schools in the nation. They also give an incredible amount of money and support to many animal hospitals and shelters, for that I commend them much! I will give credit when credit is due, I think is wonderful that they give so much charity. With that said this food is nothing more than kibble, I can see why my cats were so hungry all the time, this food did not provide the energy they required. Going back to grain-fee, the first ingredients in this product are rice and corn.<br /><br />Also the fact that this food is so expensive when is no different that the kibble in supermarket stores is ludicrous!

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: Not tastey
review/text: I fed this product to my cat and my roommate's cat.  I was experimenting with food since the cats are almost 1, and I wanted to introduce different kinds of adult food so they'd get used to them.  I mixed half Science Diet dry kitten food with this product, and the cats began to eat less.  I was worried about how much they were eating (nearly 1/4 their original diet) so I filled one bowl with this indoor cat food and one bowl with their kitten food.  They barely touched the indoor cat food, while eating most of their kitten food.  I ended up having to mix some canned cat food in with it to get them to eat.<br /><br />Part of it might be that the food is triangular and much larger than the kitten food.  They had a hard time eating it at first, since they were used to the small pieces of the kitten food.<br /><br />Don't be discouraged, though.  My cat can't tell the difference between the kitten food and the regular adult food.  They really enjoy Science Diet's fish flavored food, so give that a try.

review/summary: BAD, do NOT buy!
review/text: Chicken by-product, corn gluten meal, and whole ground corn?!!  Yeah, I'm NOT feeding my cat that, sorry. Googling "corn gluten meal" shows that it is used as an herbicide according to U.S. Patent # 5,030,268. If you Google "U.S. Patent 5,030,268" you will find out.  By-products are all the nasty parts of the chicken, turkey that humans won't eat: feet, neck, spleen, intestines that have bad effects on health. After all there are reasons why humans don't eat these parts, correct? So why should our pets? A good book that explains about by-products and manufacturing is The New Natural Cat by Anitra Frazier.  Because of these ingredients being in most cat foods, I buy Tractor Supply's 4HEALTH INDOOR dry food. Compare the ingredients in the Science Diet food to 4HEALTH and you will see the differences. 4HEALTH is a much better quality product with no corn, wheat or soy at HALF the price.

review/text: I have tried all of the Sensible Food crunch dried snacks.  They are all delicious, and these cherry berry ones are my favorites.  The berry taste is sweet and tart at the same time, and the crunch is very satisfying.  Hard to believe that something this tasty is actually good for you.  I recommend all the flavors.

review/summary: Heavy on apples
review/text: This is good, but it has too many apples.  I was hoping for more berries.  I was also hoping the kids would like to snack on it, but neither one (a 2 and 6 year old) really likes them.  They are also difficult to eat because the pieces are so small.  However, that makes it great for sprinkling on cereal or oatmeal.  Overall, a good product, worth a try.

review/text: This is my favorite flavor of the Sensible Foods Fruit snacks. They are gluten free which is necessary for me with Celiac Disease. I love this flavor and like to sprinkle them on yogurt for breakfast in the morning when berries are out of season and so expensive. I wish the pieces were bigger to make it easier to just eat by themselves as a snack. My daughter is diabetic and also loves this line of snacks.

review/summary: Great Product, with a flaw or two
review/text: This product is decent. It provides a nice amount of crunch-dried (a tad different than freeze-dried) fruit with a great taste. While there are mostly apples, the other fruits are represented well enough.<br /><br />The only problem is the fruit dust. Because of the shape of the package, the only way to get fruit out is to tip the pack. Unfortunately, fruit dust always resides at the bottom and easily creates a mess if one is not careful.<br /><br />All in all, I recommend this product and hope that the organic version of this will be chosen over the non-organic. With apples being number two on the foods most contaminated with pesticides, organic is the only option.

review/summary: YUMMY!!!
review/text: I was looking for a healthier alternative to Fruit Rollups, Gushers and the like.  I wasn't sure what to expect but these are delicious!!!  They satisfy the "crunchy" craving if you are in the mood for chips, and have a wonderful sweet taste if you are craving a fruit snack or sweets.  They have no weird aftertaste (no aftertaste at all except the sweet fruit).  Best of all, they are equivalent to a half cup of fruit.  It IS real fruit, in a different form.  I can't say enough about this snack except I wish it was cheaper.  In this case you get what you pay for.  I highly recommend it and will be purchasing this myself regularly!

review/summary: Fantastic Snack
review/text: This is a wonderful snack to take in the car, office, bus or wherever you may be on the road.  It is very tasty and good.  I shared some with my granddaughter and she loved it.  She is 4 and I almost retired so that says a lot for the range in taste.  I would highly recommend this for a healthy snack for any age group.

review/summary: Great Snack Option
review/text: I think the Fruit & Nut Delight is a delicious and healthy snack option. My husband really enjoys the Apricot & Almond bar. This box is the best of both worlds, and we're looking forward to buying them again soon.<br /><br />My one criticism; I wish KIND used organic, and healthier ingredients. Soy lecithin, for instance, is less than ideal, as is millet (a known goitrogen, affecting thyroid function).

review/summary: Excellent snack bar!
review/text: The goal was to replace a few different granola bar favorites with something relatively healthy and better flavors. The KIND bars are a complete victory for me! WOW! I have tried 3 flavors and all are significantly tastier and fulfilling than many of the granola bars. I love the nuts, dried fruits and the overall freshness. Then there is the dark chocolate version which tastes almost naughty! These are homerun choices for me!

review/text: These are so delicious! I love the KIND bars. They travel well and are very filling without being overly sweet. I have gotten my whole office addicted to them. The Coconut Almond and the Cranberry are my favorite bars for breakfast or a pick-me-up snack but if I crave dessert I will grab the dark chocolate cherry. YUM! My least favorite is the apricot one because I am not a huge fun of dried apricots. Just watch out if you are allergic to soy as the Kind + Protein bars have soy protein.

review/text: One can sells for 3.39 at my local grocery store, so with this special, it's about 2.16/can for 2 8 packs. What a bargain w/ FS. The fruit is soooooo tasty. I usually buy frozen, but this canned is better, so I've converted. I confess I eventually ate a whole can during one evening as a healthy plain fruit dessert since I kept going back for "seconds" a few times. Truly the next best thing to fresh.

review/summary: True Boysenberry Flavor - The Best Fruit There Is
review/text: You know, I've been blessed to live in regions where I was able to have all kinds of wonderful fresh fruits, even very exotic varieties.  And of course I've had non-local fruits, including obscure faddish ones.  :)<br /><br />But I've concluded that nothing tops the boysenberry.  It is a flavor that is impossible to describe, because it is utterly distinctive.  There is no other fruit that tastes anything like it, even though it is a brambleberry and bears a close relationship to those.  If you have never tried boysenberry pie, I really urge you to do so.  I've never met anyone who didn't adore boysenberries from the first bite.  Just something about them.<br /><br />So I had some fear ordering this product, because many "boysenberry" pre-made products somehow lose much of the charm of real boysenberries.  However, this product is really excellent.  They are obviously canned berries, but they still offer up not only a surprisingly fresh berry effect, but they carry that true boysenberry "something" that makes these fruits so wonderful.<br /><br />I've so far just eaten these straight from the can as topping on marzipan cake.  However I full intend to reserve all of the syrup in my freezer until I decide what to make with it.  This stuff is precious.  :)<br /><br />My thanks to the other reviewers who left their feedback to help me decide whether it was worthwhile to try this product.  Pie is in my future!

I am very grateful that Amazon makes them available.  My granddaughter and I made my husband his favorite pie last week.  The berries arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  I used the recipe on the back of the label.  Superb!  I only gave them four stars as they are canned and not fresh.  Way better than nothing.

She would definately recommend this product (and has) to others wanting a good product for a good price.

But these are my dogs favorite biscuit treats & the only reason we would go to Petco.  Actually my dog enjoys the trips to Petco because he can wander around & check out all the smells - Oh well, now we have to find other places for him to smell.<br />Occasionally Petco would be out of the Petite biscuits so buying them in bulk from Amazon is a much better option.  Less expensive too.<br /><br />If the girls @ the specialty pet food store are correct - I cannot say.  All I know is we have been feeding these biscuits to my dog since I got him & we have not evidenced any ill effect.  Actually those girls won't sell any Science Diet or Purina products either - they too apparently have fillers.

It may take a minute to get used to the flavors, only because they are so authentically fruity, they don't taste like the overly sweet gummis you are probably used to, but they are definitely worth a try.  These are different then the original German version of Goldbaren, these are the Saft (translated as "juice" in English) bears.  The original Goldbaren are much more similar to the Gold Bears sold in the US.  These taste more like actual fruit and come in different flavors: black currant, apple, lime, raspberry, pear, and peach.

review/summary: Basic biscuits
review/text: Nothing particularly special about these biscuits.  You can probably go less expensive for better quality or more expensive for better quality.  Does my dog like them?  Yes, but he also eats everything he can off the sidewalk.

review/summary: Great flavor and no salt!
review/text: I tried some of the Benson's Gourmet Seasonings recently and the Masterpiece Mediterranean is a beautifully balanced blend and one of my favorites.  Just like described it is great on any variety of ground meat.  Extremely flavorful and if you want a little salty type taste you can add a little of  "Benson's Table Tasty" after serving.  I am very impressed with Benson's and I recommend these seasonings to all my friends and family (many of whom have to cut their salt intake these days).  I no longer miss the salt as all of Benson's seasonings add so much flavor without salt or potassium chloride.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: Sent the chestnuts to my 89 yr. old mother.  She was delighted to receive them as it brought back memories of she and her siblings roasting chestnuts during the Christmas holidays.  All the chestnuts were fresh and a good size.  Will order again from this vender.

review/summary: YUM!
review/text: I like chestnuts and I always have trouble cooking them. These were easy to work with and cooked perfectly. Just heat the oven to 425 F. With a knife, make a reasonably deep X across the nuts, and bake for 30 minutes. The only reason why I gave a 4* is because I did not like the packaging, it was placed in a paper bag inside a plastic grocery bag. I think they should be put in a zipped or better sealed bag to prevent bugs.

review/summary: molded chestnuts
review/text: The chestnuts arrived closed in a plastic bag and they were all wet... Not a surprise only about 2 out of 25/30 chestnuts were not molded. Everybody knows that chestnuts should be kept in a breathable bag, such as canvas, cloth or paper bag, not sure why the seller ships them in plastic: mold is unavoidable in plastic. Maybe is a biological safety issue. I'm glad I tried 5-6 chestnuts at home before give them as a Christmas gift. I have to throw all them away.

review/summary: Just like Hamburger Helper, without the junk
review/text: tastes just like hamburger helper, actually maybe a little better.  i change the recipe - i only add a 1/2 pound of meat (usually organic ground turkey) and add noodles with a little extra water.  easy to throw together in a hurry if you make your ground meat ahead of time, freeze it in 1/2 pound increments and then throw the meat into a large pot to defrost and then finish off with the rest.  they only carry this at 1 grocery store near me (Bloom) which i don't get to very often (wish whole foods carried this one) so it's worth ordering for convenience alone although the price is pretty good.

review/summary: A great quick meal
review/text: We have been trying to make our food choices a little better lately, buying mostly organic and natural foods, and leaning toward less processed foods. While this is technically a processed food, the ingredients list is completely  identifiable. We bought about 100 lbs of grass-fed beef from a local farmer and this is a great way to cook that up fast and delicious. My husband loved it and asked if I can make it more often. Much tastier than the mostly-chemicals mac-n-cheese and other skillet prepared mixes.

review/summary: Good buy
review/text: My junk-food loving husband had a hard time when we switched to all organic food. He (and the kids) were happy when I found these boxes that really do taste just like hamburger helper. I use them with organic ground turkey and then hadd hamburger seasoning to get that hamburger flavor. We get them delivered regularly through Amazons subscribe and save program.
