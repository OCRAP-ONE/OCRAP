review/summary: Beautiful Baby Corn, Very Shoddy Packaging~
review/text: I have always loved Baby Corn, and Roland Brand Baby Corn seemed like a very good bargain until the box arrived today.  Every single one of the cans was dented/mashed.  If Amazon had properly boxed the interior carton, then I feel that the package would have arrived in a much better condition than it did.  "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."  Although Amazon did make it right by giving me a full credit for this purchase, I still believe that the better choice is to make it right the first time, thereby keeping overall costs down for all of us.

review/summary: Perfect size; great quality
review/text: This was the smallest quantity of Kombu I could find on Amazon. It's the perfect size (for me, at least). There are 10 strips in the bag.  I use half a strip for making beans. I break it off and add to the beans at the start of cooking (after the water has come to a boil) and leave it in for about 15 minutes. Then I remove and discard. It helps tenderize the beans, adds just the right flavor without having to use salt (which I avoid) and has the added benefit of iodine. I'm very pleased with the purchase and happy to be able to find the single bag quantity on Amazon.

review/summary: Melinda's - my absolute favorite hot sauce brand
review/text: I have tried a lot of different hot sauces.  From Daves gourmet sauces to the cheapo "ass in the tub" sauces.  Melinda's is my absolute favorite.  Other sauces tend to either taste horrible, not have enough heat, or a little of both.  Melinda's has never let me down.  I've tried almost every flavor available from this line and every single one tastes absolutly awesome.  If you like your sauce hot, try the Melinda's naga jolokia sauce.  If you prefer something with some heat but not too hot, try the Melinda's red savina or the Habenero XXX.  If you like a mild hot sauce, get the jalepeno or the regular habenero with no X's.  They all taste great and there is something for everyone!  I highly recommend the scotch bonnet sauce from this line.  It tastes soooo good!  Give Melinda's a try, you will not be disappointed!

review/summary: This is "Cream of Coconut" not coconut water or milk...
review/text: I thought I would add a review, as the one star review doesn't seem fair to the product. I have used this brand of cream of coconut for many years (used to own a restaurant and bar) and it is excellent. It can be used in a number of things, but is probably best known for it's use as the coconut element in pina coladas. (I personally like to double up on if I am making them for myself. :) )<br /><br />It is *supposed* to be slightly off white, and it is sweet. It is a condensed, sweetened coconut cream; it is NOT a coconut water or milk. It is not intended as a stand alone food or beverage (though I like to enjoy a bit of it right out of the can-- think coconut candy). I have seen it settle in the can a bit, if it has been stored for a while, but a quick stir will remix it, and it's good to go.<br /><br />I don't know what the previous reviewer had in mind when ordering this product, but the description given describes the product relatively well (cloyingly seems a little over the top)-- however, that is exactly what it is *supposed* to be. I think perhaps the previous reviewer was expecting an altogether different coconut product. If you're looking for a sweetened coconut cream, I would highly recommend this product.

These vanilla bars are not quite as tasty as the chocolate, but they are a nice treat nonetheless.

It was a pleasant surprise to find that the Can Do vanilla are GF.  They are a simple cookie bar with vanilla coating.  Each individually packed bar has two small portions inside, so you can share with a friend or save one piece for later!

review/summary: Simply The Best
review/text: I prepare this on a regular basis (along with Fantastic World Foods Falafel mix) for several reasons.  It's one of my family's favorites.  Allow me to enumerate the reasons why:<br /><br />1) It's easy.  Add the package to boiling water and olive oil.  Allow the tabouli mix to soak up the liquid.  Once soaked, mix with a diced cucumber and a chopped tomato.  Refrigerate in a resealable container.  Even a non-cook can master this!<br /><br />2) It makes A TON of food.  I don't consume more than 1/2 cup at a time, and the other two members of my family do the same.  We're able to eat on this three times before it's gone.  That's usually two dinners and a lunch.<br /><br />3) It's easy to make a meal with this.  Buy hummus (or get the fabulous mix from Fantastic Foods!), the aforementioned Fantastic Foods Falafel mix, pita bread, and olives, and prepare to please a crowd.<br /><br />4) It's TASTY.  I avoid wasting money on eating out by buying Fantastic Foods products because they taste much the same as the fare offered at my local Greek restaurant.  I think this tabouli tastes better than the one at my local Greek place.<br /><br />5) Again, it's cheap.  I can make three meals for my family for less than $12 total using the Fantastic Foods hummus, falafel, and tabouli.  That price includes pita bread, olives, and vegetables.  That's a pretty good deal, if you ask me!<br /><br />If you like Greek/Middle Eastern food, pick this up.  Your tastebuds and your wallet will thank you.

review/summary: Flavorful Berry Matcha
review/text: This was my first fruity matcha from Red Leaf and I had really been looking forward to trying it because of the great reviews. The delicious aroma of this selection made my mouth water as soon as I opened the packet. I have enjoyed boysenberry syrup on many occasions in the past, back in the days when I used to eat waffles and pancakes. This definitely captures the essence of boysenberry nicely with a great balance between sweet and tart. I did what others have suggested, and mixed it up with 2 oz of hot water , then added  some almond milk, a splash of cream, a small amount of sweetener, and some ice cubes and shook it up to make a chilled latte. I will eventually try it hot, but I have really been in the mood for the chilled lattes lately! So this was the third flavor I've had from Red Leaf, and all have been outstanding. I'm afraid they could be somewhat addictive. If you haven't tried boysenberry, you should! I don't think you'll be disappointed.

review/summary: A delicious berry matcha
review/text: When I saw this boysenberry flavor, I knew I had to grab it. I'm not sure if I've ever had boysenberry on its own, but I definitely know I've had it in yogurt form. There are several companies that make boysenberry yogurt, and it's delicious.<br /><br />For all my previous matchas, since they were desert matchas, I had been making them hot the traditional matcha way. Usually, after my first sip, it was a little too intense for me, so I added some milk to help bring out the flavor. But for boysenberry, hot and milk added just didn't sound appealing to me, so I thought I would try something new.<br /><br />I took my water bottle and measured 1/4 teaspoon for matcha. I then filled my bottle with 16oz of water. You can also use a water bottle, but since I want to be environmentally friendly (and I like my filtered water), I decided to just use a regular bottle. I debated whether or not to sift the matcha, but decided I wouldn't the first time around. I shook my bottle vigorously, and then sipped the results...<br /><br />WOW!!! I was really impressed. With all the other matchas, I had a hard time tasting the flavor just straight, but here I can definitely taste both the matcha and the boysenberry. The matcha is not overpowering and overly grassy, and  there are definitely berry undertones. I didn't need to add any sweetener, although I bet if I did it would bring out the flavor even more.<br /><br />I can't believe how easy this is to make. It sure beats using a whisk (no pun intended) and making water on the kettle. Those are good too, but this is better. I'm thinking I need to order some more fruity matchas in the future, since I liked boysenberry so much. I'm not sure how this would taste hot, but it's definitely delicious cold.

review/summary: Deliciously unique flavoured matcha
review/text: This matcha is my first experience with something boysenberry flavoured. I love blackberries, and boysenberries look similar, so I figured I'd give it a go.<br /><br />I'm so glad I took a chance on this flavour! It is really fresh and juicy tasting, with a light berry flavour that is both sweet and tart. It is almost candy-like in both scent and flavour, without being artificial tasting in the slightest.<br /><br />I would urge anyone who enjoys flavoured matcha to branch out a little and try a flavour you wouldn't normally try - I'm betting you'll be pleasantly surprised! All of the varieties that I've tried from Red Leaf so far have been really well done, and pretty much universally enjoyable.

review/summary: Mrs. Knott Would Be Proud!
review/text: As a kid, I practically grew up at Knott's Berry Farm.  I loved everything about that place, and boysenberries hold a very special place in my heart because of the theme park.  So when I saw that Red Leaf Tea carried boysenberry Matcha, I had to try it!<br /><br />And this does the berry - as well as Mrs. Knott - proud!  It tastes very authentically boysenberry... as if I might have plucked a few berries off a vine and pureed them and then stirred the puree into the Matcha - except that this is so much smoother.  The Matcha tastes rich and vegetative, with notes of butter in the background.  Deliciously creamy... this would make a great dessert substitute!<br /><br />Another exceptional Matcha from Red Leaf Tea.

review/text: So when I first smelled the dry powder I thought, oh tart, crisp, light, berry!<br />My daughter's first impression was "Mom this smells like Red Bull energy drink."<br />I was like OMG you are SO right!<br />It does! I have to admit. I do love Red Bull. Actually I had a bit of a Red Bull problem not too long ago, before tea! Thank you tea!<br />Nonetheless it has that exact same tart smell to it!<br />Don't worry though this is totally healthy!<br />Plus after preparing my matcha, adding some ice and milk, it tastes NOTHING like a red bull!<br />Okay maybe a little something like it in the sense that it is light, crisp, refreshing, not too tart but just a slight berry tartness but nothing that is going to make you pucker!<br />I love this!<br />I feel bad and I owe an apology to summer. Here I was craving autumn and forgot all about berries, fruits, juicy ripe tasting delights and had went totally for heavier, richer, creamier, flavors. But you know what ... it is still summer and I am going to totally enjoy drinking this and many other light matchas to come!<br />As I am sitting here in delight sipping away I am noticing this almost earthy flavor to it - no not the normal earthy grassy flavor of a matcha or green tea, but something else. The prominent flavors are still the same, tart, juicy, etc, not to be redundant, but there is something more, its one of those flavors you swish around in your mouth, tap tap tap your tongue around, make those smacking sounds trying so hard to pin point it but it is eluding me! I want someone else to get some of this so they can help me figure it out.<br />Yes this one is a delight and to think I almost passed it up I mean I was not too sure what to expect and didn't want something too overly tart but thank goodness I went for it!

review/summary: Impossible to Find and Expensive in Stores
review/text: As others have mentioned, this has been nearly impossible to find in North Peoria, Arizona.  I've hit every supermarket in the area and the ONLY store that even carries it is an Albertson's.  Over the last month of looking, I've managed to find one bottle today and it was $8.99 for a single 4.8-ounce bottle.  To think I can get it three bottles for twice that price, I'm definitely ordering from Amazon next time!<br /><br />This spice would last quite awhile for the regular family.  We often barbeque for the twelve people in my family: four in my house, plus my parents, plus their four adopted kids, plus my sister and her son.  This spice is pulled out so often that we go through several bottles a year.<br /><br />I would love to see where the one-star reviewer found it online, much less for a lower price.  The only two places I have found are Amazon and a bulk-supplier that sells a 48-bottle case.  Also, this is the exact same size bottle that I found at Albertson's and I have never seen a larger bottle.<br /><br />Buy a pack and you'll never regret it!

review/summary: Smoked or Ashed?
review/text: With a family that loves smoked food, I had high expectation for this product. The description states that it adds smoked flavor to any food. Instead, it tastes more like ASH-very distasteful. However, the biggest problem surfaced when I gave one bottle to one of my coworkers to try (she's the one who introduced me to smoked salt and I wanted her to know how bad this one was). She found small greenish dots (three of them to be exact) growing inside the bottom wall of the bottle. I didn't notice them when I gave it to her because the smoky color of the salt that muted the color. But after examining them under the microscope (we're in that industry), we found the coloration of the dots to be distinct from the colors found in the normal salt content (they had a tint of dark green and were adamantly stuck to the wall even after heavy shaking!). We didn't know what it was but considering that it grew despite the strong alkaline environment inside the salt bottle, we didn't want to risk using them any further. Furthermore, there is no return policy for this product so I just wasted almost $20 on something that I cannot even use.

review/summary: Spice Island Old Hickory Salt a long time favorite!
review/text: I started using Spice Island Old Hickory Salt in the late 70's.  It is the only spice I used on grilled meats and it seasoned all the way through the meat every time.  It is also very good on oven grilled lamb chops.  I noticed a change in the color within the past 5 years.  The original spice was closer to black in color and you only needed to use a little.  The one being sold now is dark brown and takes a little more.  The flavor is still like no other hickory spice I have tried.  This is still my favorite.

review/summary: Take it with a grain of salt...
review/text: My wife and I were introduced to Hickory Smoked Salt years ago in Seattle, Washington at Pikes Place Market.  It's flavor and aroma enhance almost anything from burger's to fish. As a caution, use it sparingly, otherwise you can overwhelm the flavor of your food, and end up thinking you've dumped dinner into a campfire. It took a long while to go through the first bottle, and we searched for it in every store imaginable, but could not find a supply.  Now that we have, we will no longer 'make do without it'.  Thanx, Amazon, for carrying the unique and hard-to-find items that make life a little more enjoyable.

review/text: My wife and I love this stuff; nothing else brings out the flavor of a good grilled steak, nothing. But it seems to be getting harder and harder to find. Have not been able to find it in bulk, so you have to buy it in the typical spice-rack sized bottles. And it is pretty expensive that way. Would love to buy a pound or so of it, but I guess I'm happy that I can still get it. C'mon Spice Islands, gimme a break....and get more distributors so I can buy it locally. The shipping charges are nearly a deal-breaker.

review/summary: What's your Major Malfunction Spice Islands ?
review/text: Well needless to say, this seasoning is the best stuff I have ever used in my 51 years of life. I have heard "That's the best steak" or "That's the tastiest chicken, I have ever had" mor than 100 times from family and friends since I found this spice some 15 or so years ago. Back then however, I only had to purchase one bottle at a time at ANY of the major food shopping markets in my neighborhood. It was always right there in the "Spice Islands Rack" with all the other fine Spice Islands products. Then one day it was like "Old Hickory Smoked Salt" had been discontinued and was impossible to find any longer, meanwhile all the same huge assortment of spices were still available at the same shopping centers.Since that day, I have had to order this product online, purchase 3 bottles at a time, and pay a ridculous ammount of shipping fees to get this product to my famlies table. Why was this product discontinued in markets in the first place ???? Why must I have to purchase online only Spice Islands ?? Seems to me, a product this good, should be within arms distance , in every store, to every customer, in the great ol' United States of America !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Let the foreigners pay shipping costs LOL !!

review/summary: Disappointing on non-grilled foods.
review/text: I can't comment on using this product while you are grilling foods, but when I used this in place of salt in the kitchen, the flavor was disappointing. My hunch is that the cocoa used for coloring affects the flavor, but I'm not sure. I don't know why the cocoa is in there (maybe the color was unappealing without it?) but I wish it was not an ingredient so that I could be sure. I wouldn't care if it was a grey or yellowish salt, take out the cocoa.

review/text: If you ever need a secret ingredient for a barbecue recipe this is it. Add a little to your favorite BBQ sauce and they'll think you are the best cook. Sprinkle a little on your chicken, fish or pork chops before you fry them and you'll be amazed at the flavor. A little goes a long way because it is a salt. If you combine it with other seasonings that contain salt use sparingly or use a low-sodium version of the other spices.

review/text: I bought this gummy bear for my boyfriend not too long ago because he had originally wanted one of those 5lb ones but I couldn't afford it at the time and thought he'd settle for a smaller version.<br /><br />As for the taste, it was okay and decently sweet. I quite enjoyed it although it does not compare to a traditional gummy bear's flavor nor consistancy seeing as it was a bit chewyer and tough, but still like I said enjoyable and not horrendous.<br /><br />The size is what dissapointed me. I wasn't expecting it to be as big as the 5lb gummy bear but was expecting it to be at least bigger than my hand which it was not. It's pretty small.<br /><br />Like mentioned from one of the other comments above, the blue rasberry bear is in fact green, I know because that is the one I received. Despite the irony in the flavor and the actual color I wouldnt mind purchasing another one maybe sometime in the near future if the price went a bit lower. I feel I overpayed for mine (almost $13 with shipping and tax included)

review/summary: Good halva... perfect for gift giving
review/text: I wanted to try halvah and see how it tastes. So I bought this brand. I like the taste and it wasn't too sweet than I anticipated.  It has a semisoft texture, little sweet confection once you bite into it. Later, you can munch on the sesame seeds coarse texture, and it does melt in your mouth. I received a 4 pack gift box, which is a lot for 1 individual but this is great for sharing and gift giving.<br /><br />This is a great snack, if you like Middle Eastern or Israeli sweets. I prefer the walnuts with vanilla and the vanilla flavors. The marble halva had some chocolate into it, but it felt grainy and there are bitter chocolate powder tones to it.  The portion size is little big too, and they cut it into small, thick square slab of halva. Each gift box contains 4 of each of these flavors: vanilla with walnuts, vanilla and marble(chocolate and vanilla).

review/text: The product has a very good taste for it not being a dairy product. There are different flavors, but I feel the vanilla is best, plus you can add coco to change the taste. The taste is very much like a malt drink.

review/text: This is a great all natural product for that on the go person who needs protein in a hurry and a nice energy boost.  Larger drink than most of the comparable drinks on the market for the same money.  I personally like the French Vanilla, but it comes in several flavors.  It tastes great too!!

review/summary: Stevia aftertaste too strong for French Vanilla flavor
review/text: I'm sensitive to stevia aftertaste and I thought it was too pronounced on the Svelte French Vanilla flavor.  The Orgain vanilla flavor on the other hand, does not use stevia, and therefore has no aftertaste.  The Svelte cappuccino flavor is much better due to the coffee flavor masking the stevia taste.<br /><br />Otherwise, I like all the other ingredients in the Svelte drinks.  Additionally, the Svelte containers are easier to open and drink from than Orgain's, and can be recapped.  Furthermore, the service size is larger than Orgain's by nearly fifty percent.

review/text: There's very little you can say about the quality of sour patch kids. Either you love them or you don't. I bought this bag for about eight bucks, and for what it costs it's pretty great. Share it with friends, eat it yourself, the quality of these big bags do not differ in any way from the smaller vending machine style retail size bags of sour patch kids

review/summary: They are sour patch kids
review/text: If you've never had sour patch kids, and you like sour gummy candy, you're really missing out!<br /><br />I don't know how to desribe them except to say that they are a soft, chewy, fruity flavored gummy candy, coated with a sour sugar.  The red ones, after the sour sugar is gone, taste almost identical to red swedish fish, if that helps to imagine what the fruit flavors taste like.<br /><br />My wife and I love them, and the sale price of this size bag was a good value.  The bag is resealable and while the seal can be tricky to engage, it does function to keep them fresh.<br /><br />Our 3.5 pound bag arrived fresh and delicious.  I would purchase this item again.

review/summary: The classic!
review/text: Sleepytime is a popular tea that has been around a long time due to its high quality. The natural flavors and ingredients have made it a required tea for the cupboard of persons interested in healthy eating for the last 30 years! The predominant flavors are of chamomile and spearmint--but the additional ingredients--including rose buds--create a satisfying, complex blend that is very tasty and soothing. Not only is Sleepytime caffeine-free but it contains herbs that are mildly relaxing and healing for the stomach. Drink this lovely tea before bed either with or without honey.<br /><br />Sleepytime contains chamomile, spearmint, lemongrass, tilia flowers, blackberry leaves, orange blossoms, hawthorne berries and rosebuds. The healing qualities of some the herbs in Sleepytime are listed below, however please note that there is insufficient quantities of each herb to have anything more than a very mild effect. Blackberry leaves, which are soothing to the stomach, contain tannins which provides a tea-like base for the flowery flavors of chamomile and rosebuds. Spearmint is one of the milder mints and is also useful to soothe tummy ache. Chamomile is a wonderful herb that has a relaxing effect; it also can be used to soothe tummy aches, headache, menstrual cramps and is a mild anti-fungal.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />"Ultimately, the bond of all companionship, whether in marriage or friendship, is conversation." Oscar Wilde.

review/text: First off, I don't claim to be a tea connoisseur, especially when it comes to black.  I've tried cheap store brands, as well as PG Tip's.  I have to say that out of them all, "Clipper" is by far the best!!  The taste is not overpowering, it's very mellow and pleasant (and it didn't make my tongue feel overly dry)!  It also didn't stuff my nose up (which could have been a possible chemical allergy to the other ones).  The price was fantastic as well (a little over $2 a box)-- especially considering it's organic AND fair trade!!<br /><br />In conclusion I'm extremely impressed; and anxious to try more teas from this company!

review/summary: Surprise! I love it!
review/text: Ordinarily I do not drink sweet coffee, and all the iced k-cups I've tried have been gooey and bitter. I tried this one when Green Mountain had a special, and now I'm ordering more for my daughter! It is very sweet, and makes a relatively small amount (the "iced" setting on my Cuisinart brewer is sends only 4 ozs. over the ice, and I wouldn't recommend more than 5-6 cubes in the glass). But brewed that way you get a refreshing, sweet, nutty drink. It's really rather strong this way, and has a surprising caffeine kick, which I don't get from my hot hazelnut brew. With record-breaking temps in Atlanta this year, it's a welcomed treat!

review/summary: Handiest Dry Food Available!
review/text: My 4 cats and I are in Total Agreement on at least one Subject. We are all very pleased with this Fancy Feast Dry Food in 16 ounce packages. I like it because it is Super Easy to store and Dispense and my kitties like it because they are sold on the taste.<br /><br />This is how the feeding is done at my home. Fancy Feast Dry Food is out all of the time. Kitties may have a snack any time they feel like it, whether it be the middle of the night, early morn, or whether I am at home or not. Two kitties are juveniles, seven months, and no one is over weight, so ad lib feeding of dry food is the rule of the house.<br /><br />At 5 PM, everyone gets one three ounce can of wet food, plus I feed the feral cat at that time. He has been my companion for about 8 years. He is now brave enough to sidle up to the back door and meow to make his wants known. He eats once a day. He is a Trap, Neuter, and Return Kitty and quite polite. He gets wet and dry food and eats the wet in the evening and the dry in the morning. He used to get whatever dry food was on sale, but he is at least 10 years old and he started loosing weight. I put him on Fancy Feast Dry and he has picked his weight back up, filled out, and his coat shines for the first time ever.<br /><br />I was using larger bags of dry food and storing them in my walk in closet. But I have had 4 knee replacements and lugging heavy bags of food became a chore. Also, with kittens ripping and running around, those bags seemed to have a mind of their own and would turn over in my closet; thus, dispensing Dry food on the carpet instead of the cat food bowl. Now I take the lazy lady's way out.<br /><br />I order these 16 ounce bags in three flavors: the green bag which is Ocean Fish with Salmon;the Purple bag which is Chicken<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00437H0OA">Purina Pet Care Fancy Feast Gourmet Gold, 16-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a>and The Pink bag which is Filet Mignon with Seafood and Shrimp <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042DHP04">Purina Pet Care Fancy Feast Gourmet Gold, 16-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />I know this is a little pricier than buying it in the big, economy size bags, but since I have problems with lifting and carrying thanks to my knees, it is worth it for me!! Then as an added benefit, I use the left over bags when I clean the litter boxes. Scoop up the mess, put in bag, seal, and throw in trash. These work MUCH better than grocery store bags which always seem to have a hole in them! So, now, I just put these in my closet and rotate the flavor and the kitties are all happy.<br /><br />My two older cats, ages 4 and 3 have eaten Fancy Feast all their lives. The vet always gives them a clean bill of health and is pleased that there are no over weight issues. The kittens just saw the vet. They started Fancy Feast as soon as their Kitten Kibble was gone. Their coats shine and the vet is pleased with their progress also. So, we are a Fancy Feast Family and Proud of it. We Recommend this brand to you and suggest the 16 ounce pouches to anyone who has problems with the larger bags of dry food!<br />Now, I have finally found my Kitty Litter in smaller bags, so I am a happy camper. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00119SUBK">Swheat Scoop Natural Cat Litter, 10 Pound Bag</a>. Getting ones knees trashed is no fun, but Amazon surely helps by carrying all sizes and deliverying to my door!!! So, keep shopping Amazon!

review/summary: Excellent for Asian dishes.
review/text: I've already reviewed these on a smaller quantity page, but I don't want someone whining about the cost without actually tasting them to deter people from giving them a try. If you're expecting these to taste like something from Olive Garden right out of the package, you'll be pretty disappointed. They are nothing like the standard Italian-style pasta, but if you know how to cook - they are GREAT. I make mine in spicy Asian-inspired dishes. Follow the directions on the package and you'll have a nice addition to your meal. (I would never even attempt to eat these plain) They turn what would normally be a 500-600 calorie dish into less than 100 for a very similar flavor. They absorb the flavor of the sauce/soup you put them in. I make them for lunches a day or so ahead of time and store them with the noodles on the bottom so they soak up as much flavor as possible. The price is not bad, considering how many calories they save you on a daily basis.

review/summary: My Babies Liked This One Right Away
review/text: I tested this one on my twin 10-month old babies and they liked it immediately.  It was their first beef and their first spinach.  I had already given them chicken and they really like it so they are not vegetarians yet anyway.  Mostly I wanted this product for the spinach and the higher iron content.  Somehow they made this particular flavor brand tasty for babies.<br /><br />I like getting these by the case rather than buying them a jar at a time at the store since 2 babies eat so much.  It's good to keep several flavor brands around too I think, to give your baby a variety.  I'm sure I'll get another case when this one is finished.<br /><br />Ingredients per the label: Water, Organic Carrots, Organic Finely Ground Beef, Organic Spinach, Organic Garbanzo Bean Flour, Organic Tomato Paste, Organic Whole Durum Wheat Flour. CONTAINS: WHEAT.<br /><br />This has 110 calories, 31% protein, 100% vitamin A, 8% vitamin C, 4% calcium and 4% iron.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.

review/summary: rotten, moldy food = health risk
review/text: I ordered a flat of food (they were on sale) that contained Chicken Apple Compote Dinner. It contained 3 of this variety and he liked the first one but the others, although properly sealed, were solid and moldy and stinky.<br />One of the Turkey dinners in the flat was also improperly sealed; the lid popped. We were lucky because I just happened to check that one. Now I'm so paranoid that I check all of them several times. I called Earth's Best and they assured me that they haven't had this problem before and that I shouldn't worry about it. I'm so suprised that this got passed QA/QC inspection at a baby food manufacturer. Why would a company take the risk of bad publicity when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety?!<br /><br />We also recently opened 5 other jars in this flat after my son refused to eat them and realized that they were rotten.  3 of them were completely solid and domed at the top!  We poked a toothpick down to the bottom of the jar and it was dry throughout.  Shortly after eating his last dinner of this box, my son started vomiting and refused to eat.  We have contacted the USDA about this.  If this happens to you, please same your jars so you can give them the information they need.  It may prevent other babies from getting sick.<br />I'll never buy anything from Earth's Best again!

Google the Earth Best's website for complete nutrition info. Most 2nd stage food have between 2 and 3 grams of protein a serving. This one has 5grams of protein and only 2 grams of sugars.

When they arrived, one of the 12-packs seemed ok, but the other 12-pack contained several broken jars and was leaking. It smelled and looked like there might be mold under the plastic that surrounded the second 12-pack.<br />  I noticed that the shipping box holding the two 12-packs had air-filled padding on only the top side of the box, which meant that there was no padding protecting the bottom side.<br />  I don't know whether some of the jars had broken at the warehouse or during delivery, but either way, I was afraid to use the unbroken jars too, because what if the seals had broken or what if there were small pieces of broken glass inside the intact jars too?<br />For more durable items, I still order from Amazon, but I canceled my subscription of the Earth's Best jars and from now on will buy jars at a physical store where I can check them first.

review/summary: mine was also improperly sealed
review/text: I also ordered a flat of food (they were on sale) that contained The Turkey and Wild Rice Dinner.  One of them was also improperly sealed; the lid popped.  We were lucky because I just happened to check that one.  Now I'm so paranoid that I check all of them several times.  I called Earth's Best and they assured me that they haven't had this problem before and that I shouldn't worry about it.  I'm so suprised that this got passed QA/QC inspection at a baby food manufacturer.  Why would a company take the risk of bad publicity when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety?!

review/summary: Delicious product, poor quality control
review/text: We had the same issue with this product. Half the flat was improperly sealed, and resulted in an expired food issue.  But you can spot the unsafe jars because they have dried up & turned solid, resulting in a different sound when shaken.  Also, when opened, these "bad" jars are mounded up in the middle and have a rotten smell.  It may be that the product was frozen in shipping, and the expansion caused the seal to break.  I have requested a refund from Amazon.<br /><br />Our baby did love this meal though - it was like Thanksgiving dinner.  The ones that were still edible were delicious, and are one of his favorite foods.

review/summary: GREAT for the Little Guys
review/text: This jar of baby food has 7 GRAMS of FAT and 110 calories - thats triple the fat and double the calories of most baby food!  I highly recommend for babies needing to put on some lbs - as well as picky eaters.  I have to offer my son a variety of 7-8 foods each meal (cheese, avacado, chunks of meat...etc) b/c he turns up his nose at so much (and I can't just say 'well too bad' b/c he desperately needs the calories!) But this is one of the foods he rarely turns down.  I highly recommend.

review/summary: Had No Problem.  They Like This One a Lot
review/text: I wondered why my 10-month olds liked this one so much when the other reviews weren't so promising.  Then I noted that it has twice the calories as the green bean casserole and sweet ingredients that are proven winners with my kids.<br /><br />Here's the ingredient list: Water, Organic Carrots, Organic Mango Puree, Organic Finely Ground Chicken, Organic Whole Grain Brown Rice Flour, Organic Yellow Split Pea Flakes, Calcium Carbonate.<br /><br />Anything that starts with carrots and mango is going to be fairly sweet, and this one is sweet.  The consistency seemed very normal, perhaps because it has plenty of water - that's the first ingredient.  Unlike most Earth Best flavor brands, this one has calcium.  The stated amount is 35% of their daily needs.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.<br /><br />I recommend this particular one, Chicken Mango Risotto, because I think babies will tend to like it as mine did.<br /><br />These cases are being delivered to my home constantly, different varieties of Earth's Best subscriptions.  On occasion a case will arrive in a mess with one or more broken jars. Over time I figured out it would cost the vendor too much to package these jars well enough to ensure no breakage. Now when a case arrives with one or more broken jars, I report it and can get credited for the broken ones only. Of course it's messy when a jar is broken, but I don't have a store nearby that sells this product except one that lists it at a higher price.

review/summary: Great baby food
review/text: The other reviews are very outdated & old. We never had any issues with the quality of this product. My daughter loved it; I loved the fact that she was getting good protein. Most of the other earth's best baby foods have carrot/squash/sweet potatoes, which is fine, however my daughter was turning orange from so many orange veggies. I liked that this one had NO orange veggies in the ingredient list. Slightly more expensive than other meals, which I think is due to the fact it has a lot of meat in it.

review/summary: Nasty
review/text: My daughter thinks this tastes nasty, and I agree. She is sensitive to carrot, so I was looking for a food for travel that delivers protein but doesn't contain carrot. Though she eats homemade turkey and peas all the time, she wouldn't even take a full bite of this. I tasted a little bit, and I can see why.

review/summary: Grainy and a Little Oily but Thick
review/text: I've read other reviewers comment on the calorie content of this flavor and it must be high because when I was trying to wash the dish I served it in in was quite oily.  Also, it has a bit of a grainy texture and I think my 6 month old son finds the spinach a little difficult to digest.

review/summary: Even a fruit hater likes it!
review/text: My 7 mo old despises all things fruit-related (we think it's too sweet for her) yet she likes this one just fine!  I'm perplexed that so many other reviewers say their baby hates it, although I must admit I haven't tasted it myself.  For us it's a tasty way to get her to eat a little more fruit every day.

review/summary: Son seems to like it.
review/text: I purchased this product from B-R-US when it was on sale and my son seems to like it. I was scared of previous post of mold and I ALWAYS double check the food before I stir and serve. He seems to like it, but I recommend the Chicken Sweet Potato dinner.
