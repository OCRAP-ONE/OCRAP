review/summary: Best General Purpose Teriyaki Sauce out there.
review/text: Always on the look for a better sauce I tried this stuff out years ago and its been in my arsenal of spice ever since.<br /><br />Good Teriyaki sauce is an elusive thing. Not too sweet, not to salty, the key is that when you take a bite that the food taste like something other than that meat marinated in soy sauce + sugar. The way the flavors of the sauce come together and transform the meat into something greater than their component parts is key. Not all sauces, in fact not many sauces are capable of this. I've had some sauces that on their own tasted fine but were just not strong enough to impart their magic into the meat.<br /><br />I had blown through at least a dozen different brands before I tried this one and on the first use knew I had a winner. Since then I've tried at least a dozen more, had some successes but as far as a general purpose sauce for Teriyaki flavor this is still the champ.<br /><br />The flavor excellent, it's not quite what you might taste at a Japanese Restaurant. Has its own character and flavor. The important thing is it is a good flavor and works the melding magic. It's a sweet, tangy flavor with a side of sesame which gives it the unique character. Its sweetness has an almost Mirin like quality and in strong concentrations is a bit too much for direct consumption.<br /><br />As a marinade for meats and veggies it is excellent. It does the obligatory tenderization as well as flavoring. I've done beef, pork and chicken and it's a winner on them all.<br /><br />I've also taken to using it as a drizzle on vegetables and rice. Its strong stuff so use it sparingly. On veggies it usually isn't a problem as the extra rolls off, but if you flavor your rice with it be careful because you can soak up too much. I really enjoy it on asparagus, it takes it to a new level.<br /><br />The value you get for the sauce is excellent, the quantity for the money is good. When you first open the bottle you need to mix it up as the sesame seeds all tend to float to the top. Break it open with a chopstick and mix it around till you can shake it up. Refrigerate after opening and enjoy.<br /><br />Pro's<br />Delicous<br />Powerful<br />Flexible<br />Good Value<br /><br />Con's<br />Need to mix it a bit when you open the bottle.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />Excellent! Don't hesitate to get some.

I bought it at a local discount store for $1.75 and have used it on everything... vegies, rice, poached salmon, beef, chicken.  I have used it as a marinade and as a sauce.  Just be sure to shake it veri well before pouring.  I knew I wasn't going to be able to find it for the same low price, but am searching for the best deal I can find.  Whatever the price, I will definitely be buying more of this as it is now the only teriyaki sauce I use.

review/summary: teriyaki heaven
review/text: I married into the Japanese culture in my early twenties and over the past twenty years I have made some good strides in learning how to cook traditional Japanese meals in a fairly authentic fashion. Chicken teriyaki is one of those recipes I think I do pretty well but now that the nest is empty and I cook for one, I don't always want to break out a bunch of ingredients to enjoy a great meal.<br /><br />In my opinion, this marinade is by far the best tasting and very closest to authentic homemade taste that could possibly come out of a bottle. This taste comparison includes going head to head to head with a really stellar recipe made by my mother-in-law who lived in Japan for over 20 years and had it down pat. This marinade can also hold its own against several 5 star restaurant versions I've had in NYC. The flavor is perfectly balanced between the ginger soy and the sweet.<br /><br />The only difference I see with this recipe and home made is the addition of the sesame seeds which I happen to love.<br /><br />Shake well, follow the instructions on the bottle (don't over marinate) and you'll have the best teriyaki dinner without any of the hassle.

review/summary: Nice healthy food -Udate - New grain free flavors!!
review/text: I like this food for my dog. Avaoderm seems like a repudable company. Dogfoodadvisor is a good website to go to to find good information about all kibble and wet food. My dog likes this food, and did very well on it. Her coat was super soft and she had lots of energy. I just noticed during the summer months her urine burned the grass. After some reading on the subject I found that high fish and beef diets can increase the uric acid in dogs and cause burn spots on your grass. Once off the fish and beef soley foods the urin grass burns stopped.<br /><br />Update: Avoderm just came out with a revolving grain free line of kibble. Turkey, Duck, and Trout. My dog is on the Turkey and loves it. She is allergic to Chicken. Even though this has chicken fat in it, it's the chicken protein she is allergic to and chicken fat does not contain the protein. I buy thick slices of fresh, low sodium turkey at the deli and top the food with peices of turkey and she eats everything. I could barely get her to eat once a day and now she is eating 2 -3 times a day and seems to be enjoying it. So far Petsmart, and Webers is the only ones carrying it. I give the Turkey a 5 stars!!!

review/text: My chihuahua/dachshund developed a horrendous skin allergy which got worse when he went outside. He scratched so much, we took him to the vet for a shot, prednisone and antibiotics. I had read about the benefits of Avoderm, and already was feeding them this dog food. I also have a miniature schnauzer. I noticed, when I didn't have Avoderm for a week, but did have Blue Buffalo which is also high quality, that my mix began to shed noticeably. When I bought more Avoderm, he hardly shed. That alone, is reasons for Avoderm. We also bath him with Avoderm shampoo which works effectively with this dog food. He is still on Prednisone, and I bought the largest bag of Avoderm available. With my schnauzer, I've noticed minute changes...no outside odor when she comes inside, breath smells better, even better mood and more running and jumping. She is older.<br /><br />Another benefit, and this is a huge plus, they seem to empty their bowls instead of letting it sit in the evening when they are fed. My mix is still of puppy age so I feed them "All Stages no grain" dogfood. It's not the cheapest, but the benefits make it worth it. I'm very pleased.

review/summary: Healthy, restorative dog food
review/text: We have an old Jack Russell who started exhibiting stress-related problems after our other dog died. Her skin was looking bad and she was chewing on her own feet and legs. I suspected that depression was suppressing her immune system from the loss of her housemate. So I ditched her garden-variety lamb/rice dog food and got her this grainless salmon potato blend instead. It worked! She stopped chewing herself and the skin irritations from that cleared up. She still has some other bumps but she is generally very improved and no longer presents stress-related behaviors or symptoms. Best of all, with this food her poop stopped stinking. Salmon! Go figure.

review/summary: Very Good Dog Food For Dry Skin & High Allergies
review/text: My dog is allergic to almost all major ingredients in almost all dog food. I feed him RAW food but it's getting kind of expensive. He doesn't like eating chicken. Which is the cheapest of all RAW food. He is highly allergic to beef, turkey, duck, egg, wheat, soy, barley, sweet potato, and his list goes on =( So its very hard to find a dog food that has nothing he is allergic too. Have tried so many brands it's unbelievable. Because even if one item is on the very bottom of the list he would break out everywhere for days. his nose turn pink etc. I feed him raw food which he loves and has no problem at all but we travel & sometimes its very hard to have raw meat with you. So it's just a bit easier if he ate kibbles. His poop is solid hard with Avoderm Salmon Grain Free. His coat is shiner & soft. The only thing I don't like about this is that Peas is the 1st ingredients on the list. Also tomato pomace is a controversial ingredient most people say its a by-product remaining after processing tomatoes into juice, soup and ketchup.<br />But so far my dog is very happy eating this and he can't wait until it's time for him to eat.<br /><br />But I will keep looking for something better which is really hard unless I make my own dog food which I don't have time for =(

My super picky 6 yr old didn't want to admit it at first but she ate every bite.  It is not spicy just has a warmth to it.<br />Grab some frozen chicken thigh meat and cook that in a skillet. Throw this on top and simmer... then viola! I served it with Orzo because that is what I had, sweet crisp corn and a salad. Very good. I can't wait to get some more and try it on fish.

review/summary: Complete Recipe
review/text: I never thought I would find a jarred sauce that rocks my taste buds as powerfully as the food at my favorite Indian restaurant.  This tomato-based sauce bears no resemblance whatsoever to spaghetti sauce, and blends well with chicken, lamb, or fish to create a quick meal with all the flavor of home-cooked tikka.  It even has a spicy bite that most recipes soften, so if you like your food hot, this is your sauce.  With rice and a veggie, it's a complete meal, one which I would willingly serve to good company or eat by myself in front of the TV.  If you love Indian food, but don't have time to make your own, this sauce is your answer.

review/text: This has a really good flavor but tastes nothing like any tikka masala sauce I've ever had.  Really easy - I just browned some tofu cubes and onion slices, poured this over the top, and let it simmer for 10 minutes, as the jar says.  A delicious tomato-ey sauce, but not creamy or hot (spicy) like I expected.  Although it's good, it has kind of a nondescript flavor.  I prefer Indian food spicier, but this will definitely do in a pinch.<br /><br />And in response to those who say it's expensive (which it is), it's much cheaper than Indian takeout.<br /><br />Sauce is vegetarian but not vegan (cream).

review/summary: Easy, pleasant, high fiber intake; easier, more pleasant, higher gram count than Metamucil.  Rich, crunchie bran flavor!
review/text: For all the trouble to take Metamucil, for its fiber content, the gram fiber count "ain't" much; 5 grams.  Fiber one is a crunchy, flavorful, bran tasty, cereal which, in  4 oz gives one 14 grams of fiber.  One cup of Fiber One equals 28 grams of fiber.  When I stop to think of the ordeal involved taking Metamucil for 5 grams of fiber, though ignorant of the existence of Fiber One, and its 14-28 grams of fiber, I could commit Hari Kari!  The cereal is as tasty as ones favorite cereal, a pleasant surprise, and by adding a pear to this morning cereal one hits the 30+ grams recommended by the medics.<br /><br />All hail to Fiber One; wouldst I had known about it sooner!  Fiber One is worth the price of admission!  All hail to Fiber One, the greatest product since sliced whole wheat bread!!!

review/summary: Fabulous Fiber
review/text: By the end of a breakfast with Fiber One and some fruit, you could have already met 70-75% of your fiber needs for the day. (Fiber One by itself provides 57%.) It's 14 grams of fiber per 30-gram serving is 40% more than Kellogg's All Bran. Unlike some high-fiber cereals, this one (the "original" Fiber One) contains no sugar, but derives its sweetness from Aspertame. As far as I'm concerned, it's the tastiest high-fiber cereal on the market.

review/summary: GET YOUR FIBER (ONE) !
review/text: A healthy diet is important to me so eating whole grains and fiber is a priority. Of course, like a lot of people, my morning routine is usually scheduled with me spending as little time as possible on each chore.<br /><br />Problems: I want fiber and whole grains. I'm rushed in the morning.<br /><br />Solution: Fiber One.<br /><br />Fiber One is a whole grain, high fiber cereal that contains 14 grams of fiber per serving (60% of the daily value), 0 grams of sugar and just 60 calories.<br /><br />The taste of Fiber One is just fine, but I usually like a little more variety, so I use it half and half with my other cereal. I fill the bottom of my cereal bowl with Fiber One, then layer in my usual whole grain, high vitamin and antioxidant cereal. Just pour in some low-fat milk, and it's ready. With a glass of orange juice and a slice of 100% whole wheat toast, it makes for a tasty and healthy start to my stress-filled and difficult day!

review/summary: a Wagonload of Fiber and crunchy-good
review/text: I bought Fiber One cereal a couple days ago because (1) it was on sale at CVS; (2) I love the Fiber One bars, especially the Oats & Chocolate ("Fart Bars" at our house); and (3) I remembered the old Kellogg's All-Bran Cereal, whose tagline should be "Sticks to Mush in 30 Seconds," and wondered if Fiber One was better.<br /><br />Boy, is it ever better!  No surprise, since the top ingredient is corn bran (Anybody remember Crunchy Corn Bran cereal?  That was truly Da Bomb and I don't know if it's even made anymore), which packs a long-lasting crunch and gets you away from that ol' funky wheat bran "good-for-you" insta-mush thing.<br /><br />I do find it amusing that the cereal's size and shape (like a bacillum bacterium, a stretched-out Good & Plenty) is almost exactly the same as the food our youngest son feeds his newt.  "Human Super-Poo Sticks" doesn't have quite the same ring to it, but make no mistake - this stuff will clean your clock.

review/text: Warning: I'm going to be pretty direct with this. If you want to be regular, eat Fiber One's 57%er. Twice a day, and you don't need to bring a magazine. We hooked my (then) 2-year-old daughter on it when we were potty training, and she goes like a machine. You wouldn't believe how much, given her size. Tells you how much unneeded garbage sits in the average colon. The flakes (honey clusters) are fine, but if you have a normally effective digestive tract, eat this and you'll have great stories for the grandkids.

review/summary: Fiber One + Activia
review/text: Diverticuli and lactose intolerance resulted in this cocktail:<br /><br />1 cup Fiber One = 28g fiber( I call them rabbit turds)<br />1 cup serving of Activia Yogurt<br /><br />Stir both until all Fiber One is coated evenly in whatever random flavor Activia yogurt you happened to grab today. Shovel it in. Now you are done with your fiber for the day, and you can eat whatever you want the rest of the day. The yogurt also has the good bacteria which aids digestion. The flavored yogurt makes it interesting, and the Fiber One provides a granola-like crunch. Rather than look to the cereal itself for flavor and get less fiber with brands that offer maybe 10-15g per cup, you instead go for texture with the fiber and flavor with the yogurt and get much higher daily fiber. I'll probably be doing this daily combo for the rest of my life. My dad has hundreds of diverticuli and is 75yrs old, and has had zero issues with diverticulitis owing directly to his high fiber diet. The doctor cringes every time he looks at his colonoscopy.

review/summary: Love my fiber!
review/text: I started on Weight Watchers in November 2008 and by August had reached my goal with 53.8 pounds lost.  Although I was initially put off by the resemblance to little brown twigs, I discovered the flavor doesn't match and it's my favorite (combined with a cup of blueberries and milk - yum, yum yum!).  My problem was that I got used to buying it at places like Sam's Club and Costco, which stocked it for a while and then abruptly didn't.  I could find it at grocery stores but for a lot higher price.  Having a subscription through Amazon ensures that I don't have to waste time driving around looking for the best bargain - I have it and don't have to worry about running out!

review/text: I never liked fiber cereals when I was younger but now that I'm a bit older I need more fiber to stay regular, so I tried Fiber One & it tastes wonderful! It has a nice texture & flavor, stays crispy in yogurt or milk. It doesn't bother me that it's lightly sweetened with aspartame (though I can understand the ppl who are bothered by this), but it would have been better to leave it natural & unsweetened (or maybe lightly sweetened with stevia). But at least I'm glad it's not loaded with sugar or high fructose corn syrup like so many other supermarket-shelf cereals (including all other fiber cereals, both supermarket brands & organic healthfood store brands...shame on them!).<br /><br />High fiber content & pleasingly moderate in it's carb content (compared to most cereals, I consider this one low-carb). This tastes great in yogurt or even sprinkled on fruit salad.

review/summary: I LOST 100 LBS WITH FIBER ONE SMOOTHIES!
review/text: I've battled with my weight since high school. I'm 50-something now and finally found a way to lose weight without feeling deprived, thanks to my Tribest Blender and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E6GFZI">Fiber One Bran Cereal, 16.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>!<br /><br />I had reached an all-time high with my weight - 220lbs plus. I can't say for sure how much I weighed when I decided to start to losing weight (yet again), because I had stopped weighing myself once I hit 220. I didn't wanna know. However, my actual weight had to be 230 or more because I was wearing my 220lb jeans, but I could no longer zip them at all. So it was either lose weight, or buy a whole new wardrobe.<br /><br />I started trying to find a diet that I could stick to, but I had to face it - I had tried them all, and always failed because of my ginormous sweet tooth. After about a week or two of depriving myself of sweets, I'd wind up breaking my diet. I knew the only way I was ever going to lose weight was to find a way to do it with, somehow, including sweets.<br /><br />I won't bore you with the details, but I finally wound up creating a smoothie recipe that was so delicious that I didn't feel sweet-deprived. I substituted the smoothie for two meals a day and ate sensibly for the third meal. I LOST 50 LBS IN 6 MONTHS! Whoo-hoo!!! I haven't been this "skinny" for over 20 years!<br /><br />I'm still losing too (-60 lbs at the time of this writing). It's been slower going lately, but that's because it's winter and I'm not walking my dog in the park for an hour 4 or 5 times a week. Once the weather warms up, I plan on going back to my walking and I'm sure the weight loss will speed up again.<br /><br />I prepare my smoothies with my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q5TIJS">Tribest Personal Blender PB200 Super Convenience Pack</a>. You drink using the container you used to blend, so there isn't an extra blender container to wash. Rinse the blade assembly with warm water immediately after blending to save more washing. I grind the Fiber One cereal in the small, 8 oz container first. Then, in the larger, 16 oz container or the extra-large 24 oz container (available separately), blend all the ingredients except Fiber One Cereal together, or just cover and shake, to make room for the cereal. Add the Fiber One last and blend thoroughly.<br /><br />The commuter lids are great for taking your breakfast with you in your car. You can make and store smoothies in the 'fridge overnight, with the included regular covers, for a super-fast breakfast. You can also get replacement parts and extra accessories (unlike similar as-seen-on-TV products). You can also get an optional carrying case for the blender to take it to work or on vacation.<br /><br />I like the mason jars for mixing and freezing both dry and wet ingredients with the Tribest, like ground flax seed and home-made veggie blends. You can get extra mason jars just about anywhere and also use them for freezing leftover or batch-made spaghetti sauce, soup, etc. Also dry ingredients like flour, rice, brown sugar (no more hard lumps!), bulk spices, etc. The dry products can store either in the freezer or on the shelf.<br /><br />As far as some of the complaints saying that their Tribest blender died after only a short time - it has a built-in, shut-off mechanism to prevent the motor from over-heating, which can happen if the mixture you are blending is very thick, which over-works the motor. If you just let the blender cool off for a few minutes, it will work again. Thin the mixture with a little more milk or a few ice cubes.<br /><br />There are several Tribest combo pack options for purchasing the blender which can save you money. Just type Tribest into the Amazon search to see them, and to see all the available accessories.<br /><br />Anyway, enough about me - if you've stuck with reading this to this point, you're probably hoping I'll reveal my secret recipe. So, without further ado, here it is.<br /><br />Basic Fruit Smoothie Recipe (makes approx. 14 oz)<br /><br />1/2 cup Fiber One Original Cereal, pre-ground if possible<br />6 oz skim milk<br />1 cup fresh or frozen fruit (nuke frozen for 15 sec. to make blending easier)<br />2 Tbs Sugar-Free French Vanilla coffee creamer (optional), I use powdered<br />No-cal sweetener, to taste (add last, after blending and tasting)<br />1-4 ice cubes, if necessary, to reach desired coldness or to thin a too-thick smoothie<br /><br />Frozen fruit works best because the smoothie will be very cold. Bananas can be frozen if you peel ripe bananas, slice into one-inch pieces, arrange on cookie sheet so that the pieces don't touch, place cookie sheet in freezer until bananas are frozen, put frozen banana pieces into zipper plastic bag, and return to freezer. You want to freeze the pieces on the cookie sheet first because if you just dump all the banana pieces straight into the plastic bag, you'll wind up with one giant frozen banana lump. You can use this method for other fresh fruit too.<br /><br />Suggested flavors: Banana, strawberry, blueberry (my fave!), raspberry, blackberry, pineapple, orange, lime, lemon.<br /><br />Suggested combos: Banana/strawberry, blueberry/strawberry, pineapple/banana, pineapple/orange.<br /><br />Use fruit juices in place of fruit too. Use 6 oz. of juice or, if using frozen concentrate, 2 oz. of concentrate and 2 oz. of milk or the equivalent in ice cubes. When buying juices, choose only those marked as 100% juice if you want to avoid sugar.<br /><br />I often use a few banana slices to sweeten, instead of no-cal sweetener. The banana will also add a little more thickness for the thinner consistency smoothies, such as those made with juice.<br /><br />Other variations: Chocolate (1 Tbs cocoa added to banana smoothie), mocha (1 Tbs cocoa, 1 Tbs freeze-dried coffee, 2 more oz. milk, banana or no fruit), pineapple-upside-down smoothie (sweeten with Splenda Brown Sugar blend - it's half Splenda, half brown sugar), pumpkin pie smoothie (cook and refrigerate pumpkin first and sprinkle in some pumpkin pie spice), sweet potato smoothie (same prep and spices as pumpkin pie smoothie), banana nut (blend in a few Tbs chopped walnuts).<br /><br />For those who want a bigger meal, add another cup of fruit and 2 more oz milk. Use the larger 24 oz container. You could also get all your fiber for the day in one meal by using a full cup of Fiber One Original cereal and a few more oz of milk, juice, or ice cubes.<br /><br />The main point of using Fiber One in the smoothie is that it makes the smoothie meal very FILLING and will keep you feeling full longer. You can't get much more filling in a 14 oz meal than 14 grams of fiber! None of the commercial diet liquid meals can't touch that - and you pay a lot more for them. With two smoothies a day, you're getting over 100% of your daily fiber, 4 fruit servings, 2 cereal servings, and 1 1/2 dairy servings. Fill out your food pyramid with your third meal. Doesn't hurt to take a vitamin/mineral supplement also.<br /><br />And, if you're really into veggies, you can make green smoothies with Fiber One too.<br /><br />I LOVE FIBER ONE AND MY TRIBEST BLENDER!!!!<br /><br />UPDATE: As of Sept. 2010 the weight loss is 100 lbs! Only 15 more to go! WHOO-HOO! This recipe really works! I wound up making mostly blueberry and/or banana smoothies - they're my favorites. I also kept frozen OJ handy for if I ran out of fruit before shopping day. I can't believe the difference when I look in the mirror - not only do I have a waist again - I re-discovered I had cheek bones too! LOL<br /><br />Since I'm so close to my goal, and since it's been a year on this regime, I've eased up on the food restrictions for my 3rd meal and I allow myself a treat every now and again. Yeah, it'll take longer this way, but after 100 lbs, I deserve a break! Besides, all along I allowed myself to get one candy bar when I went grocery shopping. It helped me avoid other temptation knowing I'd be enjoying that candy right after shopping. I still lost the weight fast. I figured, allowing a little was better than getting to the point of utter deprivation frustration and quiting - which is what has always happened in the past. Cut yourself a break every now and again and do it without guilt!

I was excited to see it on sale on line, but now I wish I'd never stocked up. I think I'm sending the rest to the food bank.<br /><br />I actually like the natural flavor of whole grains, but this is something made in a lab and you can tell. My first impression on my first bowl was "wow, this is sure sickly sweet for a 'healthy' cereal". I immediately checked the label for sugar content and was confused that there wasn't any, since the flavor is overly sweet and a bit nasty with it. I quickly noticed all the chemicals and food derivatives in the ingredient list, including aspartame as a sweetener. Ick.

Or just snack on a handful of it is I get a craving for crunch during the day.<br /><br />The only downside is that Amazon is no longer offering it on subscribe and save, and since I live in a place where I cannot buy it directly, I am very disappointed.  But, that's doesn't affect the benefits of the cereal itself, of course!

review/summary: getting fiber the delicious way
review/text: A friend told me about a delicious cereal that is not only low in calories, but full of fiber. I ordered Fiber One cereal about a month ago & not only do I eat a half-cup for breakfast (with fruit) every day, but I have another half-cup before bed. It helps me with weight loss, keeping me fuller, eating less calories. A terrific product. However, I originally paid $18.26 for SIX, 16.2 ounce boxes, with free shopping & handling. When I went on to increase my order, the price now listed is almost DOUBLE at almost $32. for the same 6 boxes. I tried for 30 minutes to write directly to Amazon, but couldn't find any area to do so. This was the best I could find. A good product but not at $32 dollars, after paying less than $19 for the same product & amount. Feedback? Are you reading this Amazon???

review/summary: Fiber One, taste Great!
review/text: I'm a big fan of Fiber One. With 14g of fiber/half cup serving, it fills half my daily allowance. Though it only has 2g of protein/serving, I just make it up with something from lunch and dinner. I notice it taste sweet though it does not contain sugar at all. It's probably b/c I add some trail mix of my own when I have the cereal. The ordering was very simple when the deal for this came up. I missed a earlier deal when this came up and jump on this deal when it appeared. I had my package within 4 days.

review/summary: 14 Grams Of Fiber! Wow! I Hope They Never Change It!
review/text: I've tried all the Fiber One cereals. The one that tastes best out of the box is the one with raisins, but that one has more calories than the regular brand. That one makes a good trail mix if you're hiking. The regular brand is a little bland, so I add fresh fruit to it. Sometimes blueberries, sometimes raspberries, sometimes I cut up a banana. I also buy bags of frozen blueberries or raspberries, thaw some out the night before and add them to the cereal in the morning. I end up with a really great tasting cereal. I'm sure that the fruit I add makes the calorie and sugar count higher, but so what. I think at 14 grams of fiber per serving, it's got the highest fiber of any cereal on the market.<br /><br />A great way to start the morning!

I saw Fiber one recommended on the Instinct Diet (written by a Harvard nutritionist) and decided to test try a box. It is amazing! It is crunchy, delicious and does not taste like cardboard. I eat it dry with my tea as a snack and mixed with home made low fat yogurt and fruit as a breakfast. It keeps my stomach from grumbling, improves my digestion and is actually helping me lose weight. This is a product that truly works like its supposed to. I only wish they made a no-sugar or savory version that I could use to create savory snacks.

review/summary: The Fiber of Our Lives
review/text: Fiber One has been a part of my multi-faceted, health-conscious lifestyle for years. Just like Cherrios, it can also serve as a bit-by-bit snack during a football game or movie. Sure, it takes some getting used to, but it's far healthier than the butter-laden, artery-clogging popcorn of my youth.  The only problem I have is that, just this week, Amazon.Com cancelled my subscription to both Fiber One and the big boxes of Cherrios.  I guess there are not enough fanatical health nuts like me to make it worth their while to stock these items.  So, it is back to the big-box, whole-sale warehouses.

review/summary: YUCK! Contains Aspartame. Alternative listed below.
review/text: It's a shame, because I really wanted to like Fiber One. The texture is great (nice and crunchy...though it makes me think a little of pet food XD ), and the fiber content is super. But the aspartame is a dealbreaker for me. I used to consume aspartame (in chewing gum and 1-4 cans of diet coke a day) and discovered that it was actually giving me migraines and hiking up my anxiety level (haven't had a migraine or panic attack in 4 years since quitting it). If I accidentally get some, I get headaches and start feeling nervous right away... So, while the studies on brain tumors is controversial, I avoid it like the plague.<br /><br />But I found today a wonderful alternative to Fiber One is Smart Bran. It has a whopping 13+ grams of fiber and tastes pretty good without the nasty artificial sweeteners. It also doesn't contain high fructose corn syrup. It would be lovely if General Mills changed their Fiber One to be healthier. 10-20 calories less in a cereal isn't worth headaches and other health impacts from Aspartame...plus it's nice when cereal has a decent aftertaste.

review/summary: ALERT!! - CONTAINS CHEMICAL SWEETENER
review/text: BEWARE - This cereal contains a chemical sweetener called Aspartame (aka Sweet'nLow), which is a dangerous chemical food additive shown to cause cancer in lab rats.  In humans, the effects of Aspartame can be felt as either migraine, other headache, dizziness, nausea, anxiety, nervousness, or bloating.  PLEASE DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH ON ASPARTAME before you consume any product such as this.  ASPARTAME is rated by the governments as "GRAS - Generally Regarded As Safe" - The History of Aspartame is fascinating and you will find that the scientists at the FDA who tested Aspartame advocated it to be banned.  Donald Rumsfeld served as one of the influential political forces that successfully managed to get the FDA to overrule the FDA's own scientists' recommendation that this product be BANNED.  Aspartame's GRAS status means that the US Gov't will do nothing to regulate or prevent its usage.<br /><br />I first started experiencing problems with Fiber-One when I realized that eating a bowl of it without any other food would cause me to feel nauseous.  On occasion, eating a bowl of Fiber-One would give me a migraine along with a feeling of dizziness.  This is certainly not the way that I want to start off the morning.  There are people who can eat Aspartame-laced foods all day long and who are unaware of any side-effects, but they do creep up on you and if you are not as tolerant as some others, WATCH OUT.  You could become very sick eating this cereal day after day, the chemical builds up in your system.  The insidiousness of Aspartame being in Fiber-One is that, if you are health-counscious, you'll tell yourself that if you're not feeling well that you should maybe eat more healthy food - like the very same Fiber-One cereal that's making you sick!!<br /><br />It is unethical and unconscionable for General Mills, a staple brand in this country, to have resorted to using a dangerous chemical additive simply so their Marketing Exec's can push their cereal upon people who are sugar-sensitive.  People with Diabetes BEWARE - Aspartame is known to also cause aggressive insulin responses.  Just because their chemical sweetener contains no calories doesn't mean that your body won't react in that manner, and you may end up on the bad end of an insulin swing as a result.<br /><br />This product should be pulled immediately from the shelves.  I personally am ashamed that a large reputable company such as GM would target a health-conscious individual like myself and yet perform an underhanded trick as adding a chemical sweetener.  I really wish I had noticed the chemical additive in this cereal before I had experienced the headaches and nausea.<br /><br />SHAME ON GENERAL MILLS - BEWARE FIBER ONE CEREAL - I wish I would have been warned before becoming sickened by this "health cereal".

We soaked chicken in this marinade for about an hour, then kept it brushed over the chicken as we grilled it. The result was an enjoyable flavor.<br /><br />While the taste was a change of pace, you may not find it to be considerably different than any somewhat spicy barbeque sauce. If you'd like something different once in a while from just grilling chicken with barbeque spices on it, this isn't a bad choice.

review/summary: Sauce not a Marinade
review/text: I agree entirely with Ghengis.  This is a great sauce and one that i have ordered and re-ordered a few times as I and most guests love it.  As a marinade though - it does not penetrate and if you use it as a marinade and then BBQ, the spice and taste is mostly gone post BBQ.  Best is to BBQ your chicken or steak, apply the sauce for the last 2-4 minutes of BBQ'ing and the result is outstanding.

review/summary: Ohmagawd, NO NO NO!
review/text: You know, I love A.1 Steak Sauce, and this marinade aint any different than a steak sauce in its consistency, but its NOT a marinade! Real marinades have a high acid content to penetrate the meat, this is a SAUCE. Might taste OK on the finished product, but you cannot marinate pork or chicken with this stuff. Well maybe if you let it soak for a month or two.<br /><br />There arent a lot of good jerk marinades on the market, you're better off making your own.

review/summary: The authentic taste & texture
review/text: Growing up in Switzerland, I often had "Bircher Muesli" for breakfast. For those who don't know the history of "Muesli", the cereal was actually developed in the beginning of the 20th century by a Swiss doctor named Maximilian Bircher-Benner as a health food. See the wikipedia article on "Muesli" for more information.<br /><br />The abbreviated form, "Muesli," is a phonetic transliteration of the Swiss-German diminutive form of the German word "Mus", which translates to "mash", "mush" or "puree."<br /><br />Thus, it should be no surprise that in order to be authentic, in my opinion a "muesli" must become a soft mush when exposed to milk.<br /><br />Familia's Original Swiss Muesli is right on the mark - if you let it sit in milk for a few minutes, it'll absorb the liquid, and assume the "muesli" texture - a mush with some nice crunchy bits (nuts) as a counterpoint (unlike most impostor products, including the other varieties sold by Familia, which stay crunchy).<br /><br />The cereal is flavored and sweetened with honey and a variety of fruit (including, according to the ingredients list, raisins, apples and pears), giving it a flavor which transports me back to my childhood home.<br /><br />Four stars for a great authentic-tasting and feeling product. One star deduction for the occasional bit of nut-shell that makes its way into the cereal.

review/summary: As good as I remember it
review/text: This is actually the first branded product I remember.  I first ate this 40 years ago at my grandmothers.  It still tastes as good.<br /><br />I'm so glad Amazon is offering products like this.  My local health store stopped carrying it since it was getting kinda expensive.<br /><br />This isn't like corn flakes -- here a little goes a long way.  But then you also don't get hungry an hour after eating it.<br /><br />And I don't have to force my kids to eat it!

review/summary: Best breakfast ever
review/text: For many years I have eaten only Familia Original Cereal for breakfast. Some years ago my father and I actually toured the plant in Switzerland and was very impressed. Recently I have not been able to purchase this in our local stores so decided to check out Amazon.com. Thankfully I found it and was able to order it, and have it come on a regular basis. We have already finished our first order and are looking for our next. We have shared a couple boxes with friends who also found the product very tasty. I feel this product has helped me tremendously in that my cholesterol has been very good. I was extremely pleased to find this product available through Amazon.

review/summary: Mushy Granola
review/text: "M&uuml;esli" is the diminutive of the German word for "mush", and as some of the favorable reviews declare, mushiness is the goal for M&uuml;esli-eaters. Authentic M&uuml;esli becomes mushy almost instantly when milk is added, though modern commercial Mueslis usually contain desiccated fruit and nut chips that stay gritty in the mush. And a lot of sugar to melt the mush together! If you've spent time in Germany or Switzerland, you'll know that you're expected to add fresh fruit and berries to your Mush, and to soften it with yoghurt or quark in preference to plain milk.<br /><br />The stuff is supposed to be wonderfully healthful, but if you compare the calories to various brands of granola, you'll find that both are higher than you thought, because of the sweeteners. Unsweetened oat bran flakes will get just as mushy almost as quickly, and you can be selective about your mix-ins.<br /><br />The 'Familia' brand dominates the supermarket shelves in most parts of the USA. If you've tried it and you like it, Mazel Tov! But don't buy M&uuml;esli in bulk or in six-packs! It gets stale and extra-tasteless on the shelf, even when the box is unopened. Honestly though, wouldn't you rather have a crisp buttery croissant or a stack of Swedish pancakes with lingon to start your day?

review/summary: It's supposed to be powdery!
review/text: I have been eating this cereal since the 70's. I think some people don't understand that the powdery part of it is what makes it so good.  You are supposed to soak this in milk until it becomes the consistency of oatmeal and then with the whole oats, nuts and fruit for crunch,  MMMM!!!!

review/summary: A good "nut & twig" cereal
review/text: I eat a half cup of this cereal with skim milk every morning.  It's not terribly low in calories, but it has the right kind of fats and it's a good source of whole grains.  I love the taste, and it fills me up and keeps me happy until lunch.  There is a lower fat/calorie version, but I think the extras in this cereal are worth it.<br />This cereal is also a great value.  If you're eating around a half cup a day, a box lasts a long time.

review/summary: Terrific start to the day!
review/text: This was a staple at our breakfast table about 40 years ago. I regularly buy from Amazon because I prefer the large 32-oz boxes to the smaller size. (And in case you're wondering, the red box has sugar added but the green box does not.)<br /><br />Add milk and/or yogurt and let sit for about 10 minutes. Slice a banana or put berries on top and you've got a terrific start to the day. Also, the waiting part is the key in my mind. The nuts and grains come together and there's no grittiness.<br /><br />A little goes a long way. Compare weight to a couple of slices of toast and you'll quickly see. And because there's more cereal and less air, my children have realized they don't need two bowls to make it through lunch time. (Neither do I!)

review/summary: a wonderful start to your day
review/text: Of course the object of this cereal is to be a mushlike consistency and it delivers.  It is delicious as is.  I usually make a 'batch' in the evening and let it sit overnight, we then have it for a few days as I find it is better as the milk absorbs.  The first time I had muesli was buffet style in a hotel overseas.  The setup was tremendous!  All types of fruit platters were at our disposal as was a bowl of yogurt and nuts.  We were encouraged to add to our delight so that is also how I often now eat it when time allows, adding a few spoonfuls of yogurt and with additions of extra raisins or craisins and cut up fruits.  While this may not be the traditional method, it provides variety, after all, all of us living in this household still have our teeth and healthy consitiutions (knock on wood) and are not in the state that this cereal was first designed to help.  I love that it is authentic and have been eating it for years as it is delicious and nutritious.

review/text: I remember eating this when I was a child.  Many many years later I sought it out in stores and could not find it, but was happy to find it here on Amazon.  Rarely does the memory of the way something tastes translate when you try it again so much later in life.  THIS is EXACTLY like it used to be.  Love it.  A little high in calories for such a small serving (only 1/2 cup?), but well worth it.<br />Yum.

review/summary: Nostalgia...
review/text: I grew up in the 70s eating this cereal.  As an adult I have looked for it in stores to no avail.  So, I was excited when I found this online through Amazon.  A bit worried that it would not be as I remembered I was prepared for disappointment.  How wrong was I?!?!  It tasted EXACTLY as I remembered.  Same texture.  Same taste.  Fabulous!!!!!  The trick is letting it sit in the milk for about 5 minutes before enjoying.  I gives it a great consistency.  Yay!!!  I'm so happy with it that I have subscribed to have it shipped through Amazon every two months.

review/summary: As I Remembered
review/text: I was introduced to this product at a child, and recently I took a trip where I was reminded how much I liked it. I looked for it in my rural grocery stores, and when I could not find it, I was delighted to find in on Amazon.<br /><br />This comes packaged in six large boxes. That really is quite a bit. But every few nights, I pour a handful of the product into a bowl and top with about twice as much milk. I throw in fruit then, or the next morning, and I am 14 years old again. It is wonderful.<br /><br />A note, the instructions say you can mix the cereal with milk the night before (cover and put in fridge) or right before eating. It is much better if it soaks. You can also set up parfait glasses of it, layering fruit and cereal and topping with milk before the soak. A fun way to start the morning, and how I have seen muesli served in Switzerland.

review/summary: Great Muesli!
review/text: This Swiss Muesli is a great price through Amazon, and we never run out when the next shipment is "in the mail."  The service is wonderful.  We love this muesli.  The oats and grains are balanced so nicely with the raisins and other fruit and nut ingredients. We mix it with yogurt and additional fruit, including blueberries, strawberries and grapes, and it makes the perfect breakfast.  Left out are the extra sugary, fake textures and flavors.  What you get is a soft textured, delicious natural muesli.
