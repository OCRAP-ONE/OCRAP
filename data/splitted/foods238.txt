review/summary: I think its pretty good and the amount of protein is a plus!
review/text: So I thought thinkthin creamy peanut butter was my favoooorite (but) white chocolate chip has won my heart. I love having one of these when I'm in a rush with a tall glass of unsweetened almond milk ..mmm. They are super good and contain 20 grams of PROTEIN! I love them :). Never have I ordered them from amazon I pick mine up at whole foods/HEB/ or kroger. Try them!

review/summary: Not the best
review/text: There is something about this protein bar that does not sit well with me. I think its the white chocolate. I know its not real white chocolate but it still doesn't appeal to me. I tried it on a whim while traveling and probably won't have it again. I'm more of a fan of the peanut butter variety. However my friend really enjoyed this one.

review/summary: one of Think Thin's best
review/text: I'm a pretty big fan of Think Thin's Chunky Peanut Butter bar and wanted to try some of the brand's other flavors; White Chocolate Chip sounded delicious.  I have to say that this bar has replaced Think Thin's Chunky Peanut Butter as my favorite.<br /><br />Think Thin's White Chocolate Chip bar has an exterior white coating and a tan center with mini chocolate chips.  The exterior coating is more similar to a vanilla flavor than a white chocolate flavor.  For those that enjoy sweets, this may be your ticket to fulfilling your sugar tooth and obtaining a decent amount of protein.  Note: The exterior coating is sensitive to heat so if you will be in warm temperatures, expect meting to occur.<br /><br />I found this bar to be moist and flavorful compared to the typical protein bar and even compared to Think Thin's other products. I'm not saying that you cannot taste the protein.  I don't know if that is something you can escape without massive amounts of sweetner.  It is a very edible option.  The ease of consumption is also appreciated. With some protein bars, you have to worry about chipping a tooth but this bar was easy to consume.<br /><br />These bars can really help you ride out a period of hunger.  I sometimes use them as breakfast bars and can go three to four hours before I feel like a snack or other breakfast item is needed.<br /><br />Think Thin's White Chocolate Chip protein bar has an admirable amount of protein and is sugar free.  Those with sensitivity to sugar alcohols and soy should probably pick another protein bar, however, because the bar contains both.

review/summary: Great Product, Great Price!!... my bars are fresher than Whole Foods too!
review/text: I'm very happy with these bars and Amazon's great price & quick shipping!!!!  I wanted a good, healthy, high protein, low glycemic, etc. meal replacement/ snack bar to eat on the go that I can keep on hand to help me reduce my caloric/ fat intake and stop me from eating unhealthy, fatty foods so I can shed a few pounds.  I went to Whole Foods and asked the employee working in the health bar area and she told me that this brand was a favorite for high protein, no sugar, and pretty good tasting.  She also told me that Chunky Peanut Butter and White Chocolate Chip were the favorite flavors.  I bought them both and liked them and saw that Amazon has them cheaper so I bought a box of each.  I was concerned when I read the reviews on here and someone said the bars were stale/ old/ not fresh, so I was prepared to send them back if need be. I checked the expiration date and they expire in a little more than a year.  I checked the wrapper of my bar from Whole foods and it expires 11 months from now.  Amazon's is fresher, go figure!!  Also, my boxes and bars in pristine condition (no melting or chemical smells or taste, as some reviewer said)  With subscribe & save I'm saving like 60%...LOVE IT!!

review/text: I picked up one of these bars at a bodega on a day when I didn't have time to get breakfast, and I was instantly hooked. I haven't tried any of the other flavors, but the white chocolate chip bar is delicious. The only problem I have with the 10-pack packaging is convincing myself I shouldn't eat all of them in one sitting. (One bar really does leave you feeling satisfied, though.)

I'm on Subscribe and Save and get 2 boxes per month.<br /><br />Buying from Amazon is the cheapest way to get these bars.  I save about $5.00 per box as compared to buying them at the store.<br /><br />I have to admit the first bar I had tasted slightly chemically... I think it must be the vitamin B I'm tasting??  But now they are absolutely delicious and I crave these bars!!

review/text: Take the edge off that hunger and avoid being ravenous when you can get to a stopping point to take a healthy meal. This product comes in many tasty flavors. I keep one in  my purse and one in my desk drawer at all times.I'd say it has taken the impulse out of impulse eating and helps tremendously to maintain a healthy course. I do not use as a meal substitute. It has a real feel of a treat.

review/summary: Good Tasting, Diabetic Friendly - Recommended
review/text: These thinkThin "Brownie Crunch Bars" are very filling and are good tasting (for diet bars), but those expecting a "Little Debbie" brownie will be greatly disappointed. Being a Type 2 diabetic, I am glad that these products are available since they only have about 11 NET Carbs.<br /><br />I find that they make a good breakfast or mid-afternoon snack, keeping me from eating something much worse.<br /><br />These do contain Maltitol and can cause "gastric distress" in some people, so it is a good idea to make sure you know how it effects you before heading out to the weekly Book Club meeting.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/text: Other reviewers here that gave this bar a good review must have been paid off by thinkthin.  Theses are the worst tasting protein bars I've ever tasted in my life.  At least other brands try to make their bar taste alright, thinkthin basically said nope, not even going to try.  The bar barely has any white chocolate taste to it.  The bar is bitter and dry.  It took me 30 minutes to finish 1 bar because it tasted so bad.  Will never buy another thinkthin product.

review/text: I got a box of these yesterday, and at first I thought they were actually spoiled.  After I re-read the reviews, I realized that they are just that bad.  I usually try to throw in a positive, but I just cannot think of one.  If they tasted good and the carbs were not nearly as high (24g per bar) I would be happy to pay the money, but for how bad they taste and how they really aren't very low-carb diet friendly, 1 star.  Really, though, I wish they would have stated the carb count on the ad.

review/summary: High hopes, but disappointed in the end.
review/text: I ordered this product after thoroughly enjoying a competitor's black truffle sea salt product.  I had high hopes in being able to equally enjoy a white truffle version of this condiment because I rate white truffle higher in the flavor scale than black truffle.  The item was delivered on time in a vacuum sealed pouch.  The aroma upon opening the pouch was hypnotizing - made my mouth water in anticipation.  I place a portion into a glass jar to serve from and left the remaining product in the re-sealable pouch.<br /><br />After a couple of weeks the aroma disappeared and so did the truffle taste in the salt from both the glass jar refrigerated sample and the remaining product in the original pouch.  Because the list of ingredients did not identify the source of the truffle flavor, I have concluded that this was a sea salt product with added artificial truffle essence, the laboratory created aroma of truffle that contains no real truffle bits or natural flavoring.  As such I believe I wasted my money on what is now a bag of sea salt whose saltiness is on the bland side as well.

review/text: This isn't nearly as good as the Dunkin Donuts Pumpkin Spice coffee I've been getting at Wal-Mart.  I particularly didn't like the bitter aftertaste that I couldn't adjust out of it.  No matter how I brewed it or what I put in it, that bite didn't go away.

review/summary: OK, not awesome
review/text: I have really enjoyed a few flavored coffees, such as the Pecan product on Amazon. The price was good and the reviews decent for this one, but the flavors dont' really meld, they kinda battle each other. It's like a nice medium roast coffee, it's really a nice coffee underneath, but then it has this whammy of aromatic pumkin, not very complimentary. My wife and I both enjoy nice coffee and have similar opinion on this one. It is holiday-ish and smells GREAT as it's brewing, as the little woman said "I just wanna dive in there!" But the flavors just don't meld. Nice try but not awesome.

review/text: I made this purchase with a bit of caution due to the fact that I'd made a more expensive purchase for Rum Flavored Coffee (different brand, different vendor) a short while back and was highly disappointed:  I'd paid dearly for an extremely poor product that had less taste than Wal-mart great value brand.  Anyway, when I received this pumpkin flavored coffee and opened the bag the aroma immediately told me I had a worthy product.  After brewing a pot the taste told me that indeed I had.  I intend to also try their other flavors.

review/text: I ordered this coffee looking for something flavored and seasonal, I had no idea what vanilla nut pumpkin pie would be like together but it is very good. The coffee is good on its own and decent with creamer, I drink my coffee black usually so when I do use creamer it is flavored and in non-flavored coffee. I enjoy the taste of this coffee straight and will be reordering with this company as this is my 2nd flavor from them and both have been great.

review/text: This is a good value in flavored coffee. Most of them are 3/4 pound or less at this price. This is a full pound of lightly flavored (vanilla, nutmeg, cinnammon) medium roasted coffee. I'm using it in my single-cup brewer and it yeilds a very smooth, non-bitter, light cup of coffee. I havn't tried using it in the 10-cup drip machine but most coffees are just a little stronger done that way.

review/summary: Pleasant Spiced Taste...
review/text: I love a good cup of flavored coffee, but hesitate trying new flavors.  It's not because I don't want to do so, but because if I don't like a coffee I am too frugal to dispose of it.  However, since I love Magnum Coffee Roaster's Chocolate Fudge Brownie Coffee, I decided to give their Vanilla Nut Pumpkin Pie Coffee a try.  I was pleasantly surprised by how well I liked this flavored coffee.  The coffee is a nice medium roast.  It is smooth and leaves no acidic aftertaste.<br /><br />I could not distinguish any vanilla flavor or any nut-like flavor in the coffee.  Nor could I isolate any pumpkin pie taste; rather, the primary flavor was of cinnamon.  Since pumpkin pie has more complex spicing than simply a cinnamon flavor, I was puzzled by the choice of name for this otherwise very good product.<br /><br />This is a very good choice for anyone who likes spiced beverages, and who wants a good cup of flavored coffee.  I think that you might enjoy this on a cold, winter day while sitting in front of a nice fire and reading a good book - perhaps on your Kindle!

Some of the other companies charge almost the same price of the coffee to ship it to you, doubling the price of the coffee!<br />I'm not sure I will go out of my way to buy this again if I am looking for a pumpkin coffee.

I've had no trouble with open packages and the seeds are delicious.  Meaty and not too salty, we enjoy them as part of a healthy diet (yes, I sneak them out of his stash.)  We eat less flour and sugar and more vegetables, protein, beans and nuts.  We spend a lot less money and feel a lot better.  What's not to like?

We recently adopted a second cat, who was being fed purina pro-plan. his coat was gritty and he shed like crazy, he was slightly overweight and kind of sluggish.  after about a month of avoderm, his coat became as soft as our other cat, lost the gritty texture, he lost the weight and has enough energy to keep up with his new friend. the kitties are healthy and happy - i won't feed them anything else.<br /><br />also, i concur with the other review about the salmon flavor, my cats didn't really care for it either.

It smells meaty and clearly appeals to them.<br /><br />But we won't be buying Avoderm again....the poo is horrific. Wet, runny, stinky beyond belief. My big boy, who did mind his manners and ate a graduated amount of the mix over a week as the bag described, had the worst reaction of all. Poor guy cried as he pooped, had diarrhea everywhere, and calmly climbed into the laundry sink for washing as if he understood he was a stinky boy.<br /><br />So yes, it is tasty and priced well, but the aftermath is not worth it. 12 paws and two thumbs down.

review/text: Upon recieving order, Boston Baked Beans were immediately thrown in the trash. It may be a personal preferrence but, they were hard as a rock and not soft at all where the coating is concerned.They were removed from my list. I ordered a good supply but, was really disapointed. Not so much in the seller but, in the product.

review/summary: Yummy flavors!
review/text: So I wasn't convinced about the greatness of Popchips - until I tried them!! Now, although they are more expensive than regular chips, they are so much healthier and taste GREAT so I'm not sure I will ever buy regular chips again!<br /><br />However, even though I loved the basic flavors in the 6-flavor variety I wanted to try some of the different varieties because they sounded good. The only purchase option to try some of these other flavors was to buy a whole box, and I was very skeptical to buy an entire box of 24 if I didn't like the flavor. This variety pack gave me the perfect opportunity to sample each flavor to determine my favorites! I wondered what flavors I would be getting since they were not listed in the description, so in case it matters to you:<br />- Thai Sweet Chili (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />- Parmesan Garlic (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />- Jalapeno (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />- Cheddar (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />- Sweet Potato (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />- Sea Salt & Vinegar (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />- Salt & Pepper (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />- Chili Limi (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />- Sour Cream & Onion (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />- Barbeque (3 .8 ounce bags)<br />- Original (3 .8 ounce bags)<br />I haven't had a chance to sample all of the flavors yet, but the ones I have tried are wonderful. They taste healthy (although they aren't exactly healthy - they are the better alternative) very crunchy and full of flavor. The only flavor I don't really care for is the Original, and that's because it is pretty salty.<br />Don't be skeptical - try this variety pack and find your favorite flavor!

review/text: These are similar to pringles, in that they are made of reconstituted potato flakes that are then flavored.  Buttttttt they are way more expensive.  I really like about half the flavors, I sort of liked a few and a few were really bad.  All in all it was nice to get a variety, but not worth the price.

review/summary: Love Popchips
review/text: Popchips are great - so flavorful and better for you than regular chips.  I ordered the pack of (12) 3 oz (full size - same as in the grocery store) bags.  Below are the flavors I received:<br />- Barbecue (2 bags)<br />- Original (1 bag)<br />- Thai Sweet Chili (1 bag)<br />- Parmesan Garlic (1 bag)<br />- Jalapeno (1 bag)<br />- Cheddar (1 bag)<br />- Sweet Potato (1 bag)<br />- Sea Salt & Vinegar (1 bag)<br />- Salt & Pepper (1 bag)<br />- Chili Lime (1 bag)<br />- Sour Cream & Onion (1 bag)<br /><br />As far as ordering the (12) 3oz bags vs the (24) 0.8 oz bags, per ounce it is cheaper to get the 3oz bags and divide them into individual servings yourself.  The 0.8oz bags are more convenient, though, so it just depends on what you're going for!

review/text: What can I say, I gave them a shot. The assortment of chips they send with this pack is well shipped and stored, however I just wasn't a fan of the taste of the product. I tried many times to eat Pop Chips with salsas, dips, tuna, etc... and I just couldn't get used to the taste. In my opinion they are extremely bland, even when well seasoned. Again, I was impressed with the product packaging and nutrition, just not the taste. I'm a chip junkie, so I was pretty bummed when I didn't like them. I can suffer through baked chips, but Pop Chips aren't for me.

review/summary: Buyer Beware
review/text: I've used this flour for nearly 20 years.  It's higher protein properties lend its self nicely to perfect bread baking.  However . . .read the product details carefully.  This is for an 80 ounce (5 lbs) bag of flour . . that's  seven times higher than the price at your local grocery store.  Furthermore, under item description, this product is listed as having a shipping weight of 41 pounds . . .so this seller is profiting on shipping by a LOT on top of the product its self.

review/text: I have been using King Aarthur All-Purpose, Whole Wheat, White Whole Wheat as well as Bread Flours for several years ever since I discovered KA in a supermarket. Believe me it is well worth the extra pennies for a bag of these flours. I have used these flours mainly for bread (I could live on bread even though they say that man does not live by bread alone) as well as for cakes and cookies.  If you haven't tried KA I strongly advise you to start baking with it ASAP. I do not work for KA nor am I part of the company--just one of their loyal consumers.

review/summary: Like eating a candle.
review/text: My wife bought a "Sweet Obsession Dark Chocolate" bar while on vacation in DC. Opening the package brought forth a waxy looking bar with no chocolate (or any other) smell at all. Tasting the bar was like eating a brown candle without a wick. Not good at all. Biting the 'chocolate' has about the same consistency as biting, I don't know, perhaps an old dried out bar of soap. Doesn't seem to melt in your mouth at all.<br /><br />Poland may be notable for a lot of fine products, this sadly, is not one of them. The label states "Simply the Finest Chocolates on Earth", but at best this could only be promotional propaganda from the bad old Warsaw Pact, Soviet domination days.<br /><br />The label also notes that the product is "Imported Exclusively by: Global Brands LLC" whose website states "You won't believe it retails for $1.00!" Well, I do, and even at a dollar, I would have been dissapointed.<br /><br />On the plus side, well, you do get a lot of it.

review/text: The preceding reviewer gave this "chocolate" two stars.  I am not feeling nearly as generous.  I am thankful for two things: one, the retailer that I purchased this "chocolate" from has a generous return policy and two, I am not shy about returning "unused portions" when they fail to meet my expectations.  Yes, I returned the "chocolate" to the store with a bite missing and no one looked at me sideways; I strongly suspect that I wasn't the first customer to do so.  Incidentally, I tried the milk chocolate variety and this is supposed to be a review about the dark, but I can't imagine that it made any difference. For what it's worth I love Polish sausage, but chocolate?  Not so much...

review/summary: From a Chocolate Snob
review/text: I am quite the chocolate snob, and while this isn't the best chocolate bar I've ever tasted, its certainly NOT the worst! In fact, I was quite impressed with it, considering my husband only paid $1.00 for it! To start with, its a little sweeter than the 65-70% cacoa chocolate I'm used to, but the sweetness is not overpowering. It has more of a rich, dark milky flavor, much like a cup of dark chocolate cocoa. I didn't notice any grainy texture or taste, in fact, it was quite smooth and silky-like. While not the ideal chocolate to compliment a glass of Cabernet, I think it would make an excellent baking chocolate for classic desserts such as chocolate pie or homemade brownies. And for those who think it taste like wax, perhaps it would make a perfect dipping chocolate for strawberries or apples? I'm giving it 3 stars, and if it came with nuts, I'd give it 4!

review/text: For the dollar, the 5.3 oz Sweet Obsessions dark chocolate bar (literally $1) is a reasonable deal.  Global Brands is either lying or deluded about this product's being the finest chocolate on Earth.  Another reviewer said it's like biting into an old bar of soap.  That isn't a real stretch.  My mild disappointment is texture-related.  It also has a little grainy quality to it.<br /><br />I think the sweetness is perfect and you know you're eating chocolate.  I'm sure my dopamine levels are soaring.  It's a good chocolate high for someone who is unemployed and has to pass on chocolate that's four times more expensive.

review/summary: Sweet Obsession Dark Chocolate-YUMM!!
review/text: This product is Dark Chocolate Not milk chocolate! To the people who can't drink milk this is Great ,the reason it's great is because it is one on the original chocolate candy formula's .Originally All chocolate was dark chocolate ,There was no milk chocolate ,without milk and lactose being used as a filler the normal chocolate had 85 to 90% chocolate solids per volume .<br /><br />Milk was added by the Swiss and used as a filler .Way back in the 1880's they found that when you combine milk with chocolate you could reduced the chocolate content in the candy .Milk chocolate was sold as a less expensive form of chocolate because the manufacturers like Hershey could sell a chocolate with 25% Cocoa content for a low price and still make a huge proffit as the could make 3 to 6 cheap candy bars by reducing the Cocoa in each bar .<br /><br />So in America we eat cheap chocolate because we see it as the normal type of chocolate candy. This product is Bitter sweet Dark chocolate and is very dense not waxy like a Hershey candy bar .<br /><br />To the High end consumer this is the Same grade as expensive Belgian Chocolate if sold as a Bitter sweet Dark chocolate,This product does not normally contain Whole milk ,Milk solids,Lactose, calcium extenders,Milk protein or Animal by products such as animal fat,animal derived protein or bulk extenders which alter the favor of real chocolate<br /><br />While this product may contain  a minimum of 40% Cocoa solids(the main favoring and ingredient in chocolate)It is the best chocolate product produced in Poland and A true value to chocolate lovers Any where!
