review/text: Whole wheat, organic, flex seeds mixed in, and you will soak them in tomato or pesto sauce; so can we really talk about taste? Well, if you must know, they taste just fine. We've been eating these for a month now (twice a week), and the whole family (including kids) likes them. Texture is just like non-organic type.[...]

review/summary: So good I almost don't believe it
review/text: This spaghetti is excellent. It's almost too good to be true. It's Organic, it's whole grain, it's got omega-3's, it's high fiber, it's high protein, and it's low sodium (ZERO sodium, actually). The noodles are tasty and have substance, unlike most of the pasta "alternatives." The Amazon price is much better than the grocery store price, and the discount for subscribing makes it even better.

review/text: I was first introduced to these candies by my Grandmother, who is Austrian.  She brought them back from her one of her trips to Europe and I was hooked.  They are small balls of deliciously smooth chocolate covering a hollow crystalized sugar center which holds the liquid alcohol. Great for gifts, entertaining or just a treat! They were very hard to find at a reasonable shipping price so thanks Amazon for offering this product.  I have ordered two shipments already and will probably need another for Christmas presents soon!

review/text: When I recieved my rum filled chocolate the container was opened. It was not wraped in any kind of plastic other then the box it came in. I was REALLY upset about that another thing was when I bit into one of them it tasted the way nail polish remover smell. At that point I had thrown them in the trash. I have had many rum filled chocolate and they tasted great and were wraped properly with plastic. So maybe I recieved a bad packaging this time, but it was a complete mess.

review/summary: Rum Kokos
review/text: These are the most unique delightful imported rum candies.  They are 4% alcohol ( rum ) and loaded with sugar.  They are the size of a candy called a whopper and are sort of like that in the sense it's a chocolate filled ball with chrunchy center filled with a small droplet ( size of a jelly belly ) of liquor rum.  They are very expensive given that it's nearly $15 for approximately 57 pieces in this plastic tub.  Makes an excellent dunker in the bottom of after dinner coffee instead of a lump of sugar.  Very nice to serve as a formal candy with a nice meal.  The taste is excellent ; very strong rum burst at the finale of the chocolate experience.  I rate this 5 stars and will buy again as I bought these at Cost Plus World Market years ago in the international food section.  The only drawback is the price on these as it's free shipping.  They appear to be made in Austria from the foreign label;  Vienna.

If you can drink these with no creaner or sweetener, you are sporting a pair. I hate weak coffee, but these CBTLs are pretty strong. However, in spite of strength, you still taste the flavor.

review/summary: Unhealthy Peanuts - Hope this review helps
review/text: I bought these and the unsalted variety because I make homemade peanut butter. I should have paid closer attention to the ingredients. These peanuts include cottonseed oil, a hydrogenated oil. I don't know why they don't just roast them with peanut oil. Well actually I do know why: Peanut Oil is more expensive than cottonseed oil.<br /><br />If roasted with peanut oil these peanuts would be healthier and in my humble opinion taste better. I've switched to buying peanuts from The Peanut Shop of Williamsburg ([...]), which are also available via Amazon Prime though unfortunately not part of Amazon's Subscribe and Save Program. I just bought the last 3 cases (two unsalted and one salted) though so you'll have to wait until they get more. They are more expensive but better quality and healthier food normally is more expensive.<br /><br />If you care about your health, stay away from hydrogenated oils and, accordingly, stay away from Planter's Peanuts. Once you become accustomed to the taste of unadultarated peanuts you'll never go back.<br /><br />It's been a while since I wrote this review and today, 4/9/2011 someone commented about my original review and the higher cost of the Williamsburg Brand peanuts. Of course, generally speaking, unfortunate as it may be, we often must pay more for healthier foods. Accordingly I thought it would be a good idea to update my review. If there's a Costco near you, there's a Kirkland Brand salted peanut that they sell, in a rather large can. The peanuts are pure and unadulterated and only roasted in peanut oil; no unhealthy cottonseed oil like the Planter's. And, they are, I'm confident either less expensive or most certainly much more cost competitive than the Williamsburg brand to which I alluded in my earlier review. So, in this particular case, provided one has access to a Costco, one need not pay more for a healthier peanut.

review/summary: Excellent taste and great price but need to use properly
review/text: We have the Bunn pod coffeemaker (incidentally the best because you can use coffees from virtually any maker unlike Keurig where you have to use their proprietary pods), and find the go hazelnuts to be very tasty and the price is very reasonable.  I actually think the best tasting pods are the Aloha Island, but they are very expensive--but you should consider these for when you have guests over/weekends only.  The key with the pods is that if you use a large coffee cup like I do, you need to put the used pod in your cup after you "brew" the coffee, just like a teabag.  Of course, if you're fine with the taste without it, then don't do this, but if you want that stronger coffee taste, then do this.  It will make a big difference in taste.  The other reviews here commenting on price are just ridiculous-they should be removed as they are just indicative of people who don't know how to search pricing apparently.  Highly recommend these pods.

review/summary: Poor quality tea
review/text: I received this as a gift; bought mostly for the packaging, I suppose. There is no mention of the type of tea anywhere on the box other than "afternoon tea" -- usually, tea is identified by type (orange pekoe, ceylon black tea, etc.). I even went to the company website to find info on the tea, but only found pictures of the assortment of "Keep Calm and Carry On" and "The Queen's Diamond Jubilee" products they carry, with no descriptions available.The bags were cheap and had no string. I made myself a cup of tea, and found it to be pretty bitter. Save yourself the trouble of throwing this out; if you like the theme, buy a poster, tshirt, or something useful with your money, because for any regular tea drinker, this stuff is no good.

review/text: I had gotten tired of the Redbulls and 5 Hour Energys of the world and thought I'd try something new. I'm a big fan of anything pomegranate flavored and my dad (who rides 50-70 miles a week) said these made a big difference for him. The flavor is great but I haven't noticed any sort of energy pick up after eating them. I've since switched to Sambozan Acai energy drinks and those are a huge improvement.

review/summary: Seems like exposed to too high a temp.
review/text: I got these on a Gold Box and was about the same price as our local stores. Unfortunately the Reeses PB cups were flattened and appeared to have been exposed to a temperature above room temp. Since I am in the midwest and in the 60-70 temps, guess the storage in the Amazon distribution location may have led to the softening/melting. The delivery was quick and packaging was great. So my only conclusion is the candy left the fulfillment center without proper temperature controls when stored. And must likely rough handling before I even ordered it. Spoke with Mateo at CS. He is going to try to make sure that they follow the temp guidelines. If you have a similar Hershey product, please return it. I probably should have. But more concerned that others did not have the same issue. Hopefully Mateo can help with that! Happy Halloween everybody!

review/text: I am disappointed in the most recent shipment I received of the Smokehouse Lamb Munchies.  I have purchased them numerous times in the past however this last shipment of 4 lbs has 1/2 of the bags in little crumb pieces and the big pieces aren't much better.  The packages typically contain large pieces that I cut up, with this shipment all you do is grab a handful of little tiny pieces. I will have to think twice before I purchase these again, I likely would try 1 lb before I buy quantity again.

I'm not sure how healthy they are at this point, I'm still researching.  The package does not specify complete ingredients.  They are light and crunchy and obviously very tasty to my dogs who will eat the entire bag if I let them!<br /><br />Addendum 1/15/11:  Just received an order of these lamb munchies and for the first time I am very disappointed.  They were full of white chaulky fat and had to alert Amazon who graciously refunded me.  I have never received them in this condition in the past and my dogs absolutely enjoy them.  I had to toss this package away sadly.  Now I'm skeptical about reordering.  I hope the manufacturer of this product sees this review and makes note.

review/text: I just sent this as a wedding gift last week, now found several sites that say this is a hoax. They say you can't really name a star, it's only done through certain organization called IAU, here is Wikipedia's answer:<br /><br />The International Astronomical Union (IAU) is the internationally recognized authority which designates stars, planets, asteroids, comets, and other heavenly bodies according to internationally accepted rules. The IAU does not sell naming rights nor does it authorize any other company or organization to do so. The IAU cautions consumers that products and services marketed by ISR and other companies have no formal or official validity whatsoever. In fact with a few exceptions of ancient or Arabic names, nearly all stars are designated by catalog numbers rather than names.[8]<br /><br />The IAU has called the ISR's star-naming business far from dangerous "charlatanry" and their products and marketing have been criticised for "seem[ing] official."[9][10] The company clarifies the products it sells on its frequently asked questions page stating:<br /><br />Astronomers will not recognize your name because your name is published only in our Star catalog.[4]

review/text: My kids, ages 8, 5, 4, 3 and 2, love the taste of this drink (they did not like the chocolate one).  We mix it with juice and water.  Water help its dissolve better.  I love that I am able to give them extra fruits/veggies each day with one great tasting drink.  Good source of antioxidants and has a wonderful alkalizing effect on their bodies.

review/summary: Much Hotter than expected -- JR sent a milder variety no charge
review/text: I bought these because I ran out of the fragrant, fruity green peppercorns that I bought a couple of years back at Zabar's in NYC, and because at least one of the reviews made them sound similar.  The batch I got, however, are hot like a capsicum pepper (hot red pepper.)<br /><br />I wrote a note to JR customer service, and they sent me some pink peppercorns at no charge.

review/summary: Green peppercorns... great pepper taste without a harsh "bite"
review/text: If you are like me and you tend to limit the pepper on your food because you don't like the "bite" of black pepper... try out green peppercorns. They have an awesome flavor that really adds to your plate and yet it doesn't have that bitter edge to it.  That being said, I've ordered green peppercorns from a couple of different spice companies and you can't beat the price of these!  They have excellent value and quality, and I can't recommend them more!<br /><br />Green peppercorns are especially good on fish, eggs, pasta and other light-bodied foods.  I will NEVER go back to black peppercorns again!

Now I just need to perfect my green peppercorn steak sauce...  (any advice will be greatly appreciated.)

review/text: Great peppercorns, fragrant and fresh! I use them in some of the recipes in "Nourishing Traditions", such as fruit chutney.

review/text: These peppers have good color, aroma, and taste. I ordered a pound and am quite pleased with the amount of product per dollar. We use green peppers for many things: poaching salmon, flavoring corned beef, ground in salads, etc. So far I've found the peppers competitive with any other green peppers I've bought and they are less expensive to boot.

review/summary: Love these olives!
review/text: These olives are absolutely the best olives we have ever eaten.  We slice them and put them on our salads and use them in bloody marys.  The combination of jalapeno and garlic are perfect with the large firm olives.  We usually buy them by the case at our regional craft fair, but we are out and I was really happy to find them on Amazon.

review/summary: RANCID!!!
review/text: I purchased these olives as a Christmas gift. To be kind, the recipient stated, "I just don't know about those olives. Something's just not right. I think they might be bad." When I finally was able to taste one I immediately spit it out as I was gagging on the rotten taste and smell. These olives (not the garlic, not the peppers) were ROTTEN!! Now, I understand that things happen and there are bad lots of produce. That is the reason I emailed the company (Leonard Mountain) and explained the issue, asking for a resolution. I received no reply. At that point, I emailed again stating I would take the issue up with Amazon, offering yet another chance for Leonard Mountion to rectify the rotten olives. No reply.<br />Thank you, Amazon for the refund. I wish the manufacturer could have resolved this issue in another manner.

review/text: I have ordered Hawaiian Shaved Ice 10 pint pack for $44 and this time around decided to try Great Northern Polar's 10 pint pack for $29 (both have free Super Saver Shipping).  I was pleasantly surprised and happy with my Great Northern purchases upon testing.  The ten flavors all taste very delicious and I prefer the texture of the shaved ice when G N P's syrup is poured on, as opposed to Hawaiian Shaved Ice's.  I'd definitely recommend this less expensive option for snow cone syrup!!

review/summary: Great Louisiana sauce.
review/text: I was searching for a sauce different from the typical sauces out there, all of which seem way too mass produced, whether its Tabasco or Cholula and specially Tapatios. So I tried this one.... LOVED IT! It may taste similar to some other cajun hot sauces, but you can actually taste the integrity behind it. It tastes like it was home made, and that's huge.<br /><br />So don't hesitate trying this sauce, it is good, perfect level of spice.

review/summary: The best of the energy chews!
review/text: I'm a runner doing 30-50 miles a week and am currently (9/10) training for the Chicago Marathon.  I've tried all of the gels and chews that are out there and these are my favorite.  I don't like gels as that squirt of mush activates my gag reflex.  Plus you always need water with them.  I've tried all of the other brands of energy chews (I think); Sharkies (good but sticky and not very tasty), Clif Shot Bloks (nice package, very sticky on the fingers), GU Chomps (super sticky and caused some nausea), PowerBar Gel Blasts (very good but tough to chew if cold).  The Honey Stinger chews are very easy to chew and you don't need water.  They don't stick to your teeth either.  The main selling point for me is that they taste good and don't cause nausea no matter what.  I'm sticking with these ones.

review/text: They're not as compact as gels like "Gu," but these are great for marathoners.  I empty 2 bags into a small plastic baggy. I carry the baggy in a neoprene pouch.<br /><br />I try to eat about 2 chews every 1.5-2 miles, beginning at mile 4.  Water to wash them down helps, but isn't a necessity.  Easy to eat on the run.  Good consistent and natural energy and electrolytes.  No stomach upset, which I always got w/ Gu.
