review/summary: A melted lump
review/text: I received these as a gift.  Unfortunately, and as others have already reported, each of the three boxes didn't contain the nice individual truffles shown in the photos, but rather the contents had melted into a great big lump of chocolate.  Since these were a gift, I didn't want to say anything, and in fact, I got pretty good at cutting off a lump at a time.  The taste was still fine, but clearly not anything I could serve to others.

review/summary: Delicious, but...
review/text: The truffles are incredibly delicious, however...they arrived on a nice cool 60ish degree day, but once I opened the bag I discovered not truffles, but a melted and then re solidified mass of chocolatey goodness. Again, it was a cool day as are most days in early April in Upstate NY. I don't know if the issue occurred during shipping or before leaving the sellers facility. Bottom line, this is really good chocolate. However you may end up eating it by breaking chunks off a block of it instead of popping a truffle in your mouth.

review/summary: Taste of Heaven, in the Winter seems best.
review/text: I am very pleased... My chocolates weren't scheduled to be delivered until Monday, but they came early, on Saturday :)<br />I was reading other reviews and saw some people got their chocolates delivered melted, mine were not. So I'm guessing the "winter" time is the best time for ordering.<br />I bought the 3 pounds because it was cheaper than the 1 pound, only a few dollars more to get 2 more boxes, and I'm glad I did. The first box is almost gone already... I just opened it today, but I shared with everyone at home and work. It is a great treat! Not too sweet, and the chocolate melts in your mouth.<br />It's a mouthful of heaven. I LOVE IT!<br />I highly recommend this item.<br />The only bad thing I can say about it is that it's so good, it's bad to have in front of your face, because I can't stop going for more

When you put them in your mouth you taste the cocoa powder immediately, but once they are warmed up in your mouth they melt and are like a chocolate paradise.  I normally hate Belgian chocolates, but these are like no other.  I wish they were more available at times other than the holidays, but I suppose that's why I usually find them sold as sets of 3.  Makes a great stocking stuffer or gift for a co-worker!

And then ... he said, "OMG you just have to try these."  We rationed them, otherwise we would have eaten the whole box in one night. As the box began to empty, fear of withdrawals started. I did a search and found them at Amazon.com and at the best price on the Internet.  Bought 6 pounds. Hope it lasts until next Christmas. One pound is gone already. Darn!

I tracked the shipping and found they had been delivered to their porch. The truffle company had not sent the gift card along so my friend had no idea who had sent the chocolates. She called members of her family to ask them if they had sent her a gift. Embarrassing! And then I had to phone her to see if she had received the chocolates!!! This took time, frustration and ruined the gift moment entirely. This<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JDQ4Q6">Donchels Cocoa Dusted Belgian Truffles - 48oz</a> company had failed in a very fundamental way.

review/summary: These Are Not Donckel's Truffles
review/text: We thought we were buying Donckel Belgian Truffles and instead we got Truffettes de France which are not nearly as good. The truffettes have 5 mg of cholestrol while the Donckels have none.  The Donckels have a very light texture and melt in your mouth while the Truffettes are heavy more like a fudge than a truffle.  I believe that the Truffettes manufacturer is preying on buyers like me by closely imitating their packaging. WE thought we were buying one product and got something else.  The products are not even close inflavor or texture.

review/summary: Packed in Puree is what You Want to See
review/text: After moving to the South from the Northeast, finding good products to cook food from my Italian heritage has been hard.  I haven't been able to find a substitute for my beloved Redpack tomatoes.  We buy those by the box up North, but that company doesn't distribute in the South.  After some research I found the label difference was "packed in Puree".<br /><br />Most other brands are packed in tomato juice, and that makes a watery, inferior sauce.  "Purea di Pomodoro" - that's what I want to see!  But when I saw this brand, I saw the magic words and gave it a try.  In fact, last night I cooked up a big pot of sauce and brought it over to my Southern neighbors, and it was a hit!<br /><br />It short, this Brooklyn born Southerner recommends this product, especially to those who are out of the area of the usual Northeastern brands.  I just wish Amazon would put this on their subscribe and save - I use four cans each time I make a pot so getting this regularly to my door would be great.

review/summary: Fabulous flavor and texture
review/text: I am a passionate home cook and have been canning my own tomatoes since I was a child.  American canned tomatoes all contain a "firming agent" that prevents the tomatoes from turning to mush in the can.  This agent also prevents them from breaking down nicely in a sauce, too!  Thus, I always can my own.  However, I will no longer be using my own tomatoes in pasta sauces after trying these Italian tomatoes.  These tomatoes are rich, meaty and are packed in a thick sauce.  They look and taste fabulous, and make an amazing pasta sauce!  My husband and I kept "mmm-ing" as we ate the first sauce I made with these.  I love the fact that they have no additives of any kind - no firming agents, no herbs/spices, not even any salt.  You have complete control over how you season your dishes.  I'm soooo glad I bought a whole case of these, and hope I will always be able to access them.  The case price brings them down to well below supermarket prices for Italian tomatoes.  I couldn't care less that they are not DOP San Marzanos, just like I couldn't care less that my champagne doesn't come from France!  These tomatoes are the same as San Marzanos, without the special government label of tomatoes that come from a small geographic area in Italy.  American or home canned tomatoes are great for soups and stews, but no more American tomatoes for my pasta sauces!  I encourage everyone to give them a try.

It's not necessary to spend money on the certified pricier San Marzanos, in my humble opinion.

review/summary: YUM!  Delicious sauce.
review/text: These tomatoes are so delicious - good price but miles above the flavor of other store brand tomatoes. I don't know if they are 'officially' certified or not but I thought they were really good, as did my Sicilian husband. I noticed other reviewers had problems with badly dented cans. I had about 4 of them somewhat dented, but not badly enough to worry me. I can see where they could've been much worse depending on the shipper/delivery person (gotta love it when "this side down" is the side that's upright and sideways on your porch).  I used them for a new "Sunday Gravy" Sicilian/Italian recipe I tried that simmered for about 16 hours, and it turned out very well. It wouldn't have been the same with regular canned tomatoes. One bit of advice, don't toss the puree!  If you don't need that much liquid either save it for later, or simmer your sauce down until thick enough so you don't lose it.

review/text: I would have given them five stars but for the handful of seriously dented cans. That bothers me a little, but I'm using those cans first. The tomatoes themselves are pretty good. For our first taste, we drained one, crushed the tomatoes by hand, and used the crushed pulp for a flatbread base. Topped with sauteed garlic, prosciutto, fresh mozz and some fresh basil, I have to say it was pretty darn tasty. We didn't do a side-by-side, but I'd say these were just as good as the "certified" San Marzanos we've had, and about $3.00 less per can. I'd also say they were far better than the Hunt's whole peeled tomatoes, and only about $0.60 more per can.

When I poured the product out of the can, I could see and smeall the difference. The tomatoes were in a thick red puree and the soup quickly came together because these tomatoes do not have chemicals to keep them firm.

We found a "certified" brand at a nearby Wholefoods shortly thereafter but they were not available on a regular basis and we were absolutely hooked after having used them in several recipes. You notice this as soon as you open the can. It's like having a handful of freshly picked tomatoes in your hands. And the taste is amazing.<br /><br />Although these are not D.O.P. certified they are by far an excellent tomato and for the price an even better buy in comparison to what we can buy locally.<br /><br />We love Love LOVE these tomatoes.

review/summary: From Italy con l'amore.
review/text: We've replaced canned tomato sauce in all of our favorite recipes with these ravishing red beauties from Italy and we're never going back. Aside from being peeled and then pasteurized in the can, these San Marzano plum tomatoes are just about as fresh as when they were plucked off the vine in the Campania region of Italy. That means they aren't cooked until you cook them, and what a difference THAT makes, especially with sauces simmered all day in a slow cooker or thrown together on the spur of the moment in a pressure cooker.<br /><br />Amazon.com's Free Super Saver shipping makes them a bargain compared to ordinary canned tomatoes and a steal versus the price of San Marzano tomatoes from the store.

review/summary: Great Italian peeled tomatoes
review/text: My father wanted Italian tomatoes for making home made pizzas.  They are sold locally for $5 or more on Oahu.  From Amazon, with subscribe&save discount, I can get them shipped for free for roughly $2.50 a can.  Can't beat that.<br /><br />We have an wood burning oven imported from italy that we use to make homemade pizzas.  The canned tomatoes just add to the uniqueness and flavor of the pizzas we make at home.

review/summary: San Marzanos for better $ than in the store
review/text: My wife uses San Marzanos in her tomato sauces. They cost a little more than the regular canned tomatoes, but we think there is more flavor. These are very rich and delicious. I don't know what these cost in your store, but I figured it out to a $1 savings per can by buying them in bulk, and that's off the CHEAPEST San Marzanos in the store that are actually grown in the USA. These are authentic from Italy. With Prime shipping and the amount of tomato sauce we make, this is a no brainer for us.<br /><br />The cans arrived in good condition.

review/summary: Great for sauce
review/text: Usually I buy a couple bushels of Roma tomatoes from a farmer and can them. This year in the midwest we had drought conditions and it was uncertain if I could get my order. I gave these a try thinking maybe they would be acceptable for this year, and they're great. I made my standard pasta sauce I think I'm done canning. Buying these tomatoes is certainly much more expensive, but so far I prefer these tomatoes. Plus saves a lot of work and storage. Prime shipping by the case is great. I also like that they canned tomatoes only, with no salt or other seasons herbs basically what I'd do at home.<br /><br />I did some research, and as other commenters indicated these seems to be legit San Marzano minus the DOP certification for export the US market. They're imported to California and distributed domestically. Their website seems pretty upfront about their product. Check it out if you're curious. My only concern is about the puree, as I'm unclear if the puree is made of the same San Marzano tomatoes or a cheaper tomato. Either way, it's a fine product. I'm just concerned about getting what I'm paying for.<br /><br />Anyway, this makes a great sauce. I just dump them into a work bowl puree and all and then crush them with my hands. Add to my ingredients and simmer.

review/summary: Disappointed: Sad or displeased because someone or something has failed to fulfill one's hopes or expectations.
review/text: For years, I used the generic store brand canned tomatoes. And for years, I thought if you went canned instead of fresh it was acceptable for the canned tomatoes to taste like a mixture of crushed red bricks in lemon soap water and to smell like absolutely nothing, no matter how far you stuck your nose inside the can. I never dreamed the possibility that one day I might open a can of tomatoes that would smell and taste like fresh sun kissed tomatoes. I wanted so bad to open a can of tomatoes and smell the tomato smell that anybody whose ever grown tomatoes experiences everyday as they water and brush up against their plants. I wanted so bad to taste the fruity sweet taste of real tomatoes that makes you come to understand why tomatoes are fruits not vegetables.<br /><br />It was because of all my disappointments and expectations above that I started my search for a great canned tomato brand. After much disagreement and uncertainty among canned tomato users, I found my way to Carmelina Italian Peeled Tomatoes in Puree. The reviews on Amazon were great and consistent. The fact that Carmelina does not use preservatives or any other flavors to disguise the true taste of their tomatoes was perfect. I thought I finally found the one great canned tomato that would finally let me create great pizza and pasta sauces. With that last thought, I quickly ordered them with 2day shipping.<br /><br />They arrived about two days prior to making this review. I checked every single can and they were all in perfect condition. Two days later with a recipe and all my ingredients in hand I was ready to make an amazing Neapolitan ragu. I'm sure every one of you looking for a great can of tomatoes ALSO has great recipe that requires great canned tomatoes! Well this amazing ragu was going to be my great recipe. The Ragu uses fresh pork and italian sausages that are simmered in tomato sauce for 8-10 hours and then when the red sauce has absorbed every once of flavor from the meat it is slowly poured over perfectly cooked pasta and then topped with parmesan cheese. Sounds like heaven doesn't it?<br /><br />Today, the date of this review, I got all my ingredients ready and made sure to wake up nice and early to give this ragu plenty of time to make its magic happen. I prepped my meat, olive oil, fresh garlic, and thinly sliced onion. I took out three of the cans. I slowly opened the first one with a huge grin on my face. Just days before my whole family called me crazy for ordering canned tomatoes over the internet and paying $35 bucks plus shipping/handling. Whatever, I would have the last laugh when they are stuffing their faces and asking for seconds. I pushed the lid open with the last twist of the can opener and for a second I was hit with mild disappointment. NO SMELL. But I kicked that thought out of my head and plunged my fingers in the can, picking out a soft peeled tomato. I popped it in my mouth and let a big sigh of disappointment.<br /><br />I opened all three cans to make sure I wasn't going crazy. They all tasted the same. Watery. Tinny. Bitter. All three cans tasted exactly the same. I kept on tasting and tasting hoping that I would have one bite that would prove me wrong. Nope. There is absolutely nothing special about this brand of canned tomatoes. For three out of twelve cans to taste exactly the same means only one thing. I could cross off one more name in my search for a great brand of canned tomatoes.

review/text: I am a long-time fan of butter toffee peanuts.  Nowadays, the only place I can find them is at WinnCo in their food bin section.  I LOVE the flavor of their peanuts but am skeptical to buy food in bins.  As an avid Amazon shopper, I discovered these peanuts and thought I'd give them a try.  The package arrived within the estimated date and in great condition.  However, the flavor was blah.  The toffee coating was horrible - no taste at all.  For the price, I expected them to taste at least as good as WinnCo but no such luck.  Won't be buying these again.

If you are looking for a good K-Cup to start your morning, this coffee will work just fine.  At times, it feels a bit acidic (more so than other brands), so I would recommend some form of creamer here.  For whatever reason, these K-Cups do NOT taste quite as good as the bean version you can buy in stores.<br /><br />It seems that Amazon is now offering a decent price on these K-Cups, but you may be able to find them elsewhere for cheaper.

review/summary: OK, but just a "cup of coffee"
review/text: A cup of store-brewed Starbucks Breakfast Blend has always been my favorite cup of coffee. Even when I brewed (regular brewing) it at home I couldn't get the quite same taste, but I could get close enough. Now that I have a Keurig brewer, I was excited to finally see Starbucks BB k-cups.... but, ouch, the price.<br /><br />For comparison, with my Keurig brewer, right now I like Tully's Extra Bold Breakfast Blend and Tully's Extra Bold Kona Blend, both of which I brew on the 2nd cup size (~7oz).  I've liked some other k-cups in the past, but they haven't been available on Keurig's site for a while.<br /><br />Anyway, I finally gave in and bought the Starbucks Breakfast (and House) Blend k-cups (from Keurig's site). Neither is like getting the same cup at Starbucks. I realize it can't be exactly the same, k-cup vs large brew. The Breakfast Blend k-cup is ok, I guess.  But it just doesn't have any of the complexity you taste in a cup from Starbucks. It's just "a cup of coffee".  I brew it on the 2nd (~7 oz) cup size on my brewer... smaller is too strong/bitter and larger is too watery.  To me, it's definitely not worth spending more on the Starbucks branded k-cups since I don't feel like I am getting anything close to the store brewed cup. Actually, I don't even like it as much as the Tully's BB mentioned above, so wouldn't buy the Starbucks BB even if it was the same price. Bummer.<br /><br />(FYI - For me, the Starbucks House Blend is undrinkable - it's too bitter (and I've tried brewing 3 different sizes, from smallest to travel mug).  It's just bitter regardless, with no underlying complexity of flavor. )<br /><br />Hope this helps someone, since obviously taste is very subjective!<br />c-

And where Mr. Neanderthal makes a pot of coffee using 18 spoons of coffee grounds and Willy Nilly uses only two spoons of coffee.  These packets eliminate all that.<br /><br />Would love for Amazon to carry the coffee since I m moved away from Tennessee and cannot buy it in stores.

review/summary: Delicious, gluten-free and soy-free
review/text: Whole Foods got me with this when I wandered through at a time they were offering free tastes. Wow, world's tastiest chicken breast! So I bought a bottle of Borsari Seasoned Salt - Original Blend (the black label bottle.)<br /><br />Unlike most "free sample" induced purchases, Borsari seasoning is something I've bought again and again. I hate to buy large spice bottles and then wonder how old they are when I go to use them again. (My mother has spice bottles in her kitchen that, I kid you not, came with her spice rack at her 1960's wedding...) The Borsari blend works very well for simple dishes I like to cook--pot roast, roast turkey breast, chicken breasts...<br /><br />Recently, we invited friends for dinner who have severe dietary restrictions. My friend and her daughter can't eat any gluten, soy or dairy. I was cooking the chicken and only after I sprinkled on my Borsari did I realize it doesn't say anywhere on the bottle in an explicit way if it is allergen-free!<br /><br />So I wrote to the contact email on the company website. Within a few hours, I had this response from Betsy:<br />"Borsari is completely gluten free and free of soy ingredients.  Borsari is produced in a gluten and soy free facility.  It is 100% natural."<br /><br />For those like the previous reviewer with other allergies, here are the complete ingredients:<br />Sea salt,<br />kosher salt,<br />fresh garlic,<br />fresh basil,<br />fresh rosemary,<br />black pepper,<br />nutmeg.<br />(No preservatives, MSG, Gluten or dehydrated ingredients.)

The savory flavor is just unbelievable and will add an instant professional flavor to any grilled, seared, or broiled red meat.  Simply sprinkle over meat, let sit to room temperature, and cook to your liking.  I get more compliments on this than anything made from scratch.  The citrus and orange flavors are nice with poultry or fish, and also make great fresh salad dressings mixed with oil and vinegar.<br /><br />Any of these products will add and instant gourmet flavor to your cooking and elevate your dishes to new heights.

review/text: This stuff is perfect for a grilled steak (or any meat, for that matter). You don't even need sauce as this salt has more than enough flavor on its own. May seem pricey for a little canister of spice, but I guarantee you, it's worth every cent. Just a word of caution, don't use too much of the salt as it will kill your meat. Rub a bit in and cook 'em. Your taste buds will celebrate.

review/text: I use Borsari sea salt on all my roasts (chicken, pork, beef), on steaks, on the grill...there are so many uses. The first time I bought this I was looking for authentic sea salt (should be grey and a little "wet" looking) and this is what I found. I was a little hesitant based on the price but after my first use I've been converted. We moved south and I no longer can find this in stores so whenever we go home I make sure to leave with at least 4 bottles. Running out is the worst feeling. :) Highly recommended.

I also give it as a small gift to friends and family who invariably ask later..."where can I buy that stuff?" Luckily I can get it in my local Whole Foods but when I move away in retirement to a rural community, I'll be glad to know I can find it on Amazon!!! and yup, all the great reviews are true :)

review/text: The owner of a small kitchen gadget shop insisted that I buy one of his jars of Borsari. I thought he was blowing smoke to move product. But he is from India, so I figured he might know a thing or two about spice.  Well, he was right to be so passionate and insistent.  This is amazing stuff. I'm a burger expert, and have lately been musing over ways to spice up burger projects; without overwhelming the natural ground beef taste or grilled smokiness.  This does the trick in spades. Big thrill. Previously I'd used kosher salt and fresh ground pepper, which is logical and traditional.  This Borsari salt maintains that logic but ads a touch of magic.<br /><br />This would get five stars, but, not to sound silly, does it really need kosher AND sea salt?  A bit less of either would make it less salty, so the other flavors could come through just a tad more.

review/summary: Mmmmmm
review/text: I was shopping at Whole Foods this evening and they were in high gear with the store-wide sampling. The best thing was their beef strip steaks, not because of the meat, but because of this seasoning salt. I took my little beef cube on a toothpick and started walking off. But when I tasted it, I turned right around and went back to find out what they had put on the steak. It was this  Borsari original seasoned salt blend and they had sauteed the steak in the house garlic butter. It gives the steak a definite steakhouse flavor. There's another garlic seasoning I get off the web that sort of works the same to punch up the flavor. On earlier visits, I had seen this in the store at the meat counter and thought "eh". But now that I've tried it, I can't wait to try it myself at home. It was seriously good, and I don't often find food products to rave about. This will definitely have family and dinner guests asking what you did to make the steak taste so good. Very WOW. Get a jar---you'll see. My favorite "single" steak seasoning is Garli Garni. But if I couldn't get that, this would be a good substitute.

And last month when they were out of Borsari Original - I went nuts. I contacted the company. Within hours the regional sales manager contacted me and assured me that Borsari Original would again be available at Whole Foods.  I have to drive 25 minutes to get to Whole Foods...and to get this product - it is well worth the drive.<br /><br />Try it...you'll never use anything else.

review/summary: great olive mix and not salty if you soak em
review/text: These are delicious olives and a nice mixture of different sizes and types. And a great deal for a pitted olive mix.<br /><br />Another reviewer said they were too salty, but that might be true if you eat them straight out of the tub. They are packed in a salt brine for preservation. That's easy to deal with - before I ordered these, I found several web sites with recommendations to soak brined olives to remove the salty taste, and it worked!<br /><br />I scooped a few cups out of the bucket and rinsed them in cold water and then soaked them in fresh cold water in the fridge overnight in a resealable container. Then I drained them and added a bit of red wine vinegar and some olive oil, gave the container a good shake, and put them back in the fridge. The result - very mild slightly spiced and very delicious olives. (Don't soak the whole tub - the storage life is supposedly reduced when you remove the salt)<br /><br />The green ones are big and nice and crunchy, the smaller kalamata and black olives a bit softer. There are herbs and a few garlic cloves and red pepper rings in the mix but only enough to flavor without overpowering the olive taste - I find some supermarket mixes can be a bit too spicy, these are perfect.<br /><br />If you order these, have them shipped separately, because the container will likely leak and Amazon seems oblivious to that (they do stick the tub in a bag, and mine only leaked a few tablespoons worth of brine which stayed in the bag).

review/summary: Be Sure You Know What Greek Country 'Style' Means
review/text: I've gotten a number of different Roland Olive products and they are restaurant quality, good value for the money.  Actually, the same is probably true for the Greek Country style.  I wasn't sure exactly what to expect but the price was pretty attractive.  At least to Roland, Greek Country means the blend of olives includes a bunch of tiny sticks/branches and 'Greek' seasoning which wasn't spared in the least.  I hate picking the stems & branches off and out of the pitted olives - and the spices both overwhelm (IMHO) the natural flavor of the olives and leave a aftertaste in my mouth.  I like the blend of different sizes and types of ripe and unripe olives - and that it's pitted.  I'd suggest getting this along with a container of Roland Kalamata Olives.  You can save the liquid from the Kalamata container - then do a quick wash and shake of the Greek Country Olives then drop them in the Kalamata liquid.  This will remove most of the 'extra' branch material - and in a week or so - the 'over' seasoning will mellow out quite a bit.  If you're good with the intensity of the Greek Spicing, you could probably just wash and shake the olives & container and filter the liquid to remove just the stem materials.

review/text: This says the olives are pitted...they are NOT PITTED.  And they have the most disgusting mixture of oil and spices and the olives are WAY overly salted. I love salt, but these were unedible.  I have sense drained all the juice off of them and I have refilled the keg with filtered water and  a little vinegar, in hope to leach some of the salt and yuk taste out of the olives. In the past,I have purchased Roland Kalamata's in the keg and really enjoyed them, but these are a big disapointment, expecially due to the cost. I this had been a little jar of olives, then I would have just thrown them away. But I really hate to waste the money, so I am trying to repair the damage done by Roland. I will let you know if my "clean up" of the olives helped. And the fact that they are not pitted will hinder my clean up.

These are low sugar,low fat, no trans fat,etc. As important, if you consume these instead of potato chips,cheese doodles,onion dip and salsa chips you will be replacing the bad cholesterol stuff with the good stuff and keeping your sugar intake low as well. A lot of eating is emotional and psychological based,not hunger based. Do the above mentioned swap,give it six weeks and you will be proactively ahead of the curve.

review/text: This stuff is so good, I miss being able to just go over to the store and buying it, but they don't seem to sell it on the east coast except online. Great for sandwiches, and on crackers, or just eat it by itself. It is perfect for any occasion.

review/summary: Excellent but too expensive
review/text: This is one of the best salami I have tasted this side of the Atlantic, but it is way to expensive. You can buy it at Costco for around $16.00.

review/summary: #1 Salame
review/text: This is the best salame.  I look forward to our trip to California every year for the fun and I know that there is always a log of this stuff at everyone of our family members house.  Never really looked into buying it online but now I can enjoy this all the time.

review/summary: COLUMBUS SALAME
review/text: NORMALLY, this Columbus Salame is GREAT... but lately, there seems to be a problem with just "getting the paper off of the salame!"  - I so don't like eating paper w/my Italian Salame, but it doesn't come off, unless you either peel or cut half of the meat off off of the product to get it off! - NOT GOOD! - Somebody is taking shortcuts with this product, and eventually causing good-paying customers who love Italian Salame, to look elsewhere for their "Italian Salame addiction!" - LOL! - The product itself is still GOOD... it's just becoming "TOO HARD TO GET TO," for the money!- I've been eating Italian Dry Salame for over 30 Yrs. now, and I prefer the Columbus Brand, for its consistency! - IT IS, SIMPLY PUT, A SUPERIOR PRODUCT, minus the paper issue! - SO.. I'm taking away "1-star" from the rating because of the "paper" problem!

review/summary: Food
review/text: I was very happy to find this Columbus Italian Dry Salame at Amazon.  We moved into a rural area.  It was hard to find even in the city.  We were pleasantly surprised to find that it came in extra fresh condition - as we got it direct from the maker.  We couldn't be happier.

review/summary: Tastes like c**p
review/text: I bought this salami at Costco, thinking this may be a great way to experience dry salami made in the Italian way. What a major disappointment. Both my wife and I think the taste is terrible, almost spoiled.<br />Now, I love salami. I'm a salami lover. I've eaten a salami sandwich every day for the last three years. Every day!!!!! I buy most of my hard salami at Sam's Club from a vendor called Castle Wood. It 's not as good nor as inexpensive as their previous vendor called Margherita, but it's pretty similar in taste. But, after tasting this product carefully, I'm getting pretty close to simply chucking the remainder of this Columbus dry Italian salame (why do they insist on spelling it this way) in the trash. What a waste. Don't waste your money like I did.
