review/summary: I HATE POP-TARTS!!
review/text: I hate Pop-Tarts, but I LOVE Nature's Path Organic Frosted Cherry Pomegranite Toaster Pastries! The reasons are obvious, Pop-Tarts taste like Brand-X aftificial jelly slathered on cardboard. The taste is bad and the texture is even worse.<br /><br />But, one bite of Nature's Path Organic Frosted Cherry Pomegranite Toaster Pasteries and you are in Heaven. The pomegranite has just enough tartness to wake up your taste buds in the morning, and the breading is light and flaky. Add a mug of coffee and you have the perfect on the go breakfast to hold you for quite some time.<br /><br />These things are YUM!

They are pretty too, so she doesn't feel left out when the others are eating their dye-laden bad for them food. I find it hard to keep myself out of the box....

My young son has a real sweet tooth and these are a great treat for him. In fact my whole family enjoys them.  My husband about died when he saw I ordered a case of "Pop Tarts", but he was pleasantly surprised by the taste and the more healthful ingredients.  I will definitely keep these on my shopping list, and recommend them to anyone, especially families with children who want a quick and tasty snack that's a little more "fun" than a piece of toast and more wholesome than a donut or (most) cookies.

review/summary: A healthier version of the popular breakfast pastry...
review/text: We've been on a pomegranate kick lately and my wife saw these Organic `Toaster Pastries' (don't call them Pop-Tarts) and snatched them up the other day.  She's been looking for a healthier breakfast pastry for the kids since Pop-Tarts, while delicious, are not really all that great for you (with all the artificial colors, hydrogenated oils and such).  These organic pastries are really good and taste pretty much exactly like a Pop-Tart, they even look just like them.  I won't take that step and say that they taste `better', but they taste pretty much the same.  The Cherry Pomegranate flavor is really good, although I would have like more pomegranates.  Instead, I get a lot of cherry.  That is the only reason I give this four stars instead of five.  If you put a flavor on the box, you should represent that flavor well in the pastry and these should have merely been called `Cherry' because that is the only flavor I get.  Still, as a whole you can't go wrong with these Organic pastries.  They are more expensive than your typical Pop-Tarts, and you get less in a box as well, but for peace of mind as a parent they are worth it.

Its a win win situation with these. It'd be nice to buy them here, but keep in mind, other than grocery stores and health food stores I've found them at Walmart too. You can find them many places. Natures Path is one of the best organic companies too on top of that. Great to support.

review/summary: Tastes great, still like nearly candy but at least natural
review/text: I saw these at Big Lots for two bucks a box of six so I bought a few.  I'm not one to buy stuff and eat this type of sugary snack on a regular basis (or at least I refuse to see myself as someone who does), but the organic label was interesting so I gave it a try.  I suppose it helps me rationalize eating them if they are organic, because the more unhealthy and unnatural contents of the mainstream competitive products, in combination to the calories and sugar for this type of "food," is generally enough to dissuade me from buying them.<br /><br />I have eaten Pop Tarts before, and these are every bit as good and tasty or better.  I haven't eaten enough Pop Tarts to be really familar with the varieties and all that, but I think these Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries are not lacking in any way at all compared to my recollection of the artificial and non-organic/natural conventional products.  These were not dry or bland or stale or anything like that.  The only drawback at all I could find with them is the calories and sugar content.<br /><br />The one that I tried is the strawberry frosted style.  If I see more at Big Lots, I'll be picking up some more.

review/text: First, I'd agree with everyone here who says this isn't a "healthy" food.  Because it's really not.  Lots of sugar in this.  But as a snack, it sure beats a lot of the other sugary treats out there, and it tastes good enough, that your kids won't feel deprived if you give them this instead of a twinky.  We also like that it's organic, since we have some issues with GMO foods- allergy type issues, not philosophical issues (not that there's anything wrong with philosophical issues, but ours is a true allergy).<br /><br />And if you want to be really decadent, when you go camping, you can toast marshmallows, and toast these (or not toast them) and use them to make a pretty darn good smore-like creation.

review/text: I absolutely love these, my kids love them too, lol. All the flavors are good with the exception of those chocolate ones (but I wasn't a chocolate pop tart fan either- but even them weren't bad just better to us cold, not hot). Either way these are one of the best and from one who could live on pop tarts in less healthier times is more content that this is a much better substitute. Not only are they organic, but they dont contain any artificial "icks". Bear in mind these types of foods are not for people who are trying to lose weight. It's not a protein bar it's a toaster pastry. It's good for people on the go, great for kids and those who want a more health conscious snack than their counterpart (not fat free, sugar free, but certainly better) and for parents who have chosen not to give artificially flavored, colored crap this makes me feel good (and their tasty!)<br />btw, if you love these you'll also go for the frosted apple cinnamon and blueberry :-D

review/summary: Incredibly Good; Puts Pop-Tarts to Shame
review/text: I never really ate Pop-Tarts until I was an adult.  When I tried them, I liked them well enough, I suppose, but thought they were nothing to write home about.  I bought some of these, along with the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon flavor in a combo pack, on a whim and was pleasantly surprised.  These are excellent.  Think organic, good-tasting Pop-Tarts.  Health food?  Maybe.  More healthy than the "original"?  Definitely.  But more importantly, they taste way better.<br /><br />I like this flavor better than the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon.  The Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon are good, I'd give them a 4 stars even, but these are really, really good.  I like the brightness and slight tartness of these better.  I think it works better with the pastry than the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon which is simply rich and sugary.  I am about to get a big box of the Frosted Blueberry to try those out.<br /><br />As an aside, one of the other reviewers commented on wanting some of the sugar replaced with "natural" artificial sweetener.  I think this would be a big mistake.  They would taste terrible, and, I think, would go against the idea of having a natural version of a processed product.  I would stop buying them if that happened.  If you want less sugar, just eat one of them in a sitting. :)

But, they loved them and never said a word about them being any different than the name brand.

The price on Amazon is sooo much better than the natural markets.

I won't complain since I spent less than a dollar a box, but I would certainly never pay full price for them.  They are organic, which is nice, but they don't taste anything like pop-tarts, so I unfortunately have a little trouble getting my toddler to eat them.  Unless you know you REALLY love this variety or you plan to share it with another family or two, I wouldn't recommend a case this big.  Over all though, the product isn't bad, but it's by no means fantastic.

review/summary: Pop Tarts - Eat your heart out!!!
review/text: I purchased a case of 12 boxes (72 delicious little treats) - of these for $15.00.  I thought that, at that price, it would be worth it, even if they weren't any better than the high fructose corn syrup filled name brand Poptarts.  And I do not regret the decision one bit!<br /><br />The calories/fat/etc are very similar to those of regular Poptarts, but the ingredients are different - sweetened with cane juice, molasses, honey, etc.  They still are pink & covered with sprinkles, in case that's what you're into.<br /><br />The taste & consistency are really what you're interested in though, right?  Well - we've got a win-win situation.  The pastry itself is quite good, similiar to the consistency of a traditional toaster pastry - (in my experience, some foods made with whole wheat flour end up being sort of like paste in my mouth when I'm chewing - but that doesn't happen at all with these) - and the filling is DIVINE - it doesn't taste like a liquified fruit roll up (which is what I think of the cherry filling in a regular poptart) - you primarily taste the cherry - but the pomegranite (or "pomegran" as it says on the box) comes through as well.<br /><br />That being said - these are definitely worth the super low price I paid for them, and in the future, I'll most likely be willing to pay more if I have to - definitely superior to the ones you'll find in my local grocery store!!

review/text: My daughter loves these "Pop-Tarts".  She often eats them in the morning with a yogurt before school.  I will eat them too when I am craving something sweet that won't give me a sugar rush.  These are a great choice for all parents looking for a healthier version of the "Pop-Tart"

review/summary: Way better than Pop-Tarts
review/text: Fantastic "toaster pastries" aka Pop Tarts. Buying them in bulk as snacks for work makes them as cheap as Pop Tarts at much higher quality and taste, and organic to boot.  I have tried all the flavors, and Strawberry is my current favorite- although they are all good.<br /><br />Good company too- very involved in their community.

review/text: I bought these to replace the occational candy bar and for a grab and go snack.  They are delicious and very filling.  Yes they are made with healthy ingredients and yes they are organic.  No this is not diet food.  These babies pack a caloric punch similar to a candy bar and so you need to keep that in mind.  They are great for being a little naughty without filling up on fake food and chemical frappe.

review/summary: Tasty and healthy
review/text: These toaster pastries taste, especially when toasted.  I avoid anything with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, and these fit the bill.  I include them in my daughter's lunch and also have them for snacks.  They are 210 calories apiece, which is a bit much for a snack, but you can always cut them in half.  A case is a lot of toaster pastries, but we are not getting sick of them, and you can also use these for groups of kids, like after soccer games, etc.  The price is less than the local health food store, and now I don't have to make a special stop to pick them up.

Then I decided to try blueberry. Both are great, but I liked strawberry better. The only bad thing is that they have a lot of sugar (20g each).

review/text: So, I'm trying to be a responsible parent.  I buy these and give my kids the "It's these or nothing- no more pop-tarts" speech.<br /><br />Result- my kids eat a lot more cereal.  Even my 2 year old, who eats anything, won't eat them.<br /><br />Personally, I think they're pretty good toasted, not so hot (pun!) un-toasted.  I took 5 boxes to work, and the opinions were universally the same.<br /><br />So, if your satisfaction in eating somewhat healthier outweighs your taste buds, have at 'em!

UMBRIA OLIVE OILS REALLY ARE WONDERFUL BUT A WASTE FOR PASTA AND COOKING UNLESS YOU CAN AFFORD SUCH THINGS. WHEN THE DOT COM PLAGUE HIT US HERE IN  NORTHERN CALIF. I HAD TO STREAMLINE MY TASTE TO MATCH OUR FINANCES AND FOOD WAS THE FIRST TO BE ADDRESSED.  NO MORE SHOPPING AT DRAEGERS IN MENLO PARK, BUT WE DO HAVE A NICE LOCAL ITALIAN GROCERY STORE (AND THEY REALLY ARE ITALIAN ! ) AND THE OWNER SUGGESTED THIS OLIVE OIL, I TRIED IT ( IM A RETIRED CHEF, FOR REFERANCE INFO, SO IM PICKYYYYY ) AND IVE BEEN COOKING WITH IT EVER SINCE.

review/summary: Great Taste!
review/text: I've been searching for a good-tasting protein drink since I had a gastric bypass 3 years ago. I saw this product on another weight loss surgery blog and decided to give it a try. You can drink it warm (unlike most other protein drinks) or cold and it mixes quite easily if you use a container with a blender ball. I thought it was a bit too thick when I mixed it according to the directions (2 scoops in 12-14 oz. of water) so the next time I used more water. Others might prefer the thicker version, though. I also added crushed ice after I mixed it which kept it cold longer and made it more like an iced coffee drink. When I travel, I take my empty blender ball container in my carryon bag, stuffed with ziploc bags filled with protein shake powders but on my next trip will be taking these packets instead.

review/summary: Metallic Taste is the Deal Breaker
review/text: Purchased this to use for travel as it's difficult to find iced coffee in most hotels & using water to mix makes it the perfect travel drink. I so wanted to love this. You have to shake vigorously - preferably using a shaker with a stirring ball or filter - as it's VERY grainy & takes about 2 minutes of solid shaking. Grainy I can live with, but the taste is the deal breaker. It has an incredibly strong metallic taste. The only way to soften the taste is to add lots of milk, which defeats my purpose of bringing a water mixing drink to travel. It's expensive for the convenience and would have been worth it - if only I could drink it. Oh well, the search for a traveling, water mixing iced coffee continues.

review/summary: too salty for a general purpose rub
review/text: Maybe OK for a boston butt, but as a general purpose rub I find it too heavy on the salt. Admittedly, just how salty is "too salty" is a highly subjective thing, and some others obviously like this rub quite a lot. But looking at the nutrition info on the label, the sodium content in this rub is substantially higher than most other commercial rubs/seasons I've tried. So just be forewarned that if your salt preference is more on the conservative side, this may not be the product for you.

review/summary: Beware of the good reviews this is a very salty rub
review/text: I bought this product due to all the good reviews.  I bbq using a weber smokey mountain often.  I usually make my own rubs.  I thought this might be a good product to keep on hand in case I didn't feel like making a rub.<br /><br />Most good bbq rubs have a base of salt and brown sugar.  This rub does not contain any sugar.  It is however very heavy on the salt.  I am used to using a large amount of rub when bbq to get a nice bark.  I made some ribs using this rub and they were so salty they were almost inedible.  I tasted the rub before hand and cut it with some brown sugar but clearly not enough.<br /><br />I have used this rub on other foods and had better results.  A little is very delicious on french fries or corn on the cob where I use this in place of salt.<br /><br />If you intend on using this rub heavily for low and slow cooking plan on cutting it heavily with brown sugar.  I prefer a salty spicy rub over an overly sweet rub but this is too much on its own.  I just wish they used more of the other ingrediantes and less salt as the spice is very tasty.<br /><br />If you plan on using this to spice up other foods in place of salt you may be very happy with this.

review/summary: the best for big pieces of pork
review/text: This is the best rub i have found or even made. No need to drive yourself crazy trying to perfect your own rub, they have done it for you.<br />With butts and whole chickens/turkeys it is great. On ribs go very sparingly, it can overwhelm them! I also like to melt this in water/applejuice/vinegar/butter and inject it directly into the butts (10 to 12LBS typically). I like the keep the butts in the "shrinkwrap" they come in from BJ's overnite then put the rub on at least 4-6 hours prior letting the meat come up to room temp in a bag till it is soaked in then i add another sprinkling. I got a "pizza" shaker type metal shaker that makes the application easy and it works out great. I slow smoke often and 1 gallon of this lasts me right around a year but I use it for everything! Really is worth the money, you will not regret it, just go easy on the ribs as it is a bit salty ad full flavored.

review/text: I grill and barbeque a lot and use "rubs" that I make and a very few commercial products, mainly because most commercial rubs aren't all that good. Byron's, however is the real deal: since buying this stuff, I have used it on ribs, pork butt roast, steaks and turkey. It produces consistantly great results on grilled food, low & slow barbeque and even on oven roasted meats. It adds a nice zip to soups, salads and veggies too. I will be seasoning the Thanksgiving turkey with it at the request of my SO.<br /><br />I concur with the reviewer who urged potential customers to get the big size: it gets used up real fast!!

review/text: The only problem with this rub is that I thought I was getting the jar, not the large size container.<br /><br />This stuff is amazing. It's like everything that tastes good on charred, dead animal flesh got together and conspired to bring the world a delicious alternative to salt and BBQ Sauce. I strongly suggest liberally coating on chicken, pork, beef, and anything else you can get your hands one. I spilled some on eggs once. Those eggs came to life, fried themselves, found some bacon to pair up with, and plated themselves while pouring me a glass of delicious orange-mango-pineapple juice.<br /><br />I love this more than Penzey's seasoned sea salt, johnny's sea salt, penzey's barbecue dust, and puppies. If you knew how much I love puppies, this last sentence would cause you to gasp in amazement.

I went to my local grocery store first and got the little bottle but it went so fast I had to get a bigger one. What a difference it makes to have a solid rub you can use on anything you cook. I use BBBR on almost all of my meat. It's a great base to any real cooks rub. I use it along with some other ingrediants I normally use and it's the real deal !!. The name says it all, Byron is one Bad dude !! If you are thinking about trying a rub other than your own then start with this one. You won't be disaapointed.

review/summary: Pretty darn good tasing rub!!
review/text: I bought this along with Pappy's and Stubb's rub to taste test them all. Overall Byron's was the best tasting/flavor. I like the smokiness of this rub on the skirt steak that we grilled. I went back for 2nds and 3rds. :) As with all rubs, there is a lot of salt. So you have to be careful how much you rub on. Overall the best tasting.. Very pleased.

review/summary: Can't live without it!
review/text: I love Butt Rub! This is one thing we can't live without in the kitchen. We don't use it as a rub since we generally don't cook items such as barbecue but I use it as a seasoning. Goes on almost anything, pizza, eggs, French fries, salad, hummus, sandwiches, pork chops, steak and on! So much better than plain old season salt.

review/summary: GREAT rub!!!
review/text: Butt Rub is by far one of the best rubs you can buy. I normally make my own dry rubs (especially for some things like ribs and pork butt) but this stuff is delicious! It has the perfect amount of twang. I've tried tried it on steaks, burgers, pork chops, country style ribs, etc. and all with great results. But I find it is especially fantastic on grilled chicken and is almost the only thing I season my chicken with now. For those that say it is too salty, this is not a sweet rub nor is it meant to be, and there is a such thing as using too much!  Don't listen to them though, buy some and you definitely will not be disappointed!

review/text: I was watching a food network cook-off, and one of the teams was called "[...]" and I just had to type it in and see what came up. Luckily, it was this delectable spice mix and not something funny :)<br /><br />Butt Rub is awesome on just about anything! If you go on the actual website, you can see the never ending list of possible culinary creations. Its awesome on meat, but also on texas toast (mix with honey, butter, and grated parmesan cheese, spread on the bread and toast in the oven), deviled eggs, homemade fries(or even the kind from the freezer)... there are tons of ideas to put it to good use!<br /><br />I recommend getting the big jar, we already ran out which is why I'm on this page tonight. And just in time for fathers day! It makes a great gift for a Dad that loves to bbq.

review/summary: absolutely fab!!!
review/text: So my child was strictly breast fed until the age of 10 months.  Then I tried feeding her.  I tried just about every organic baby product out on the market, result : BLAH!  She does not like baby food?!?!?!?!  I have resulted in feeding her what she will eat from our meals, or rather what she is allowed to eat from our meals.  I will eventually make all of her baby food but thought, why slave over the stove now if she is not going to eat?  I'll wait until she wants to eat, then I'll slave.  For now, she is nursing OVERTIME!!!<br /><br />Today, at of all places, Lego Land, I see "Sprout" baby food.  It's organic.  I read ingredients . . . . just food!  So, I try it.  I like it.  Tastes like food to me.  Not jar baby food, but like the baby food I made my son.  My daughter LOVES, LOVES, LOVES it.  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE that she eats it.  Bought every one of the different types they had at Lego Land . . . . now I'm going to order on line.<br /><br />If you like whole, REAL, food . . . . try it!

review/summary: Favorite food of my seven month old
review/text: My daughter LOVES this oatmeal.  She flat refused to eat rice cereal when I started trying to give her solids at six months, so I decided to present her with oatmeal instead.  Granted, this oatmeal has applesauce and cinnamon and the rice cereal didn't, but on texture alone this product was an easier sell.  It's smooth and creamy and has a wonderful soft, spicy fragrance from the cinnamon.  Whenever she doesn't finish the pouch (which is rare), I eat what's left.  It's that good.<br /><br />The pouch is fantastic to throw in her diaper bag and I appreciate that I don't worry about glass breaking in her bag or feeling compelled to try and find a use for an empty glass baby jar (well you *can't* just recycle those things, they have to be useful for something, right?).<br /><br />One tip:  I found the applesauce did bind our little one up rather painfully when we first started feeding it to her (wow, was *that* a long night).  Adding in a few spoonfuls of prunes, apricots or peaches when feeding her anything with pears or apples solved that problem.

review/summary: NOT sugary and still tastes excellent
review/text: I am adding breakfast to the 2 regular meals to my 6-months old son's diet. I have been experiencing with different brands(Earth's Best and Happybaby). I picked up the Sprout oatmeal with roasted cinnamon applesauce at my local grocery store. I gave it to my son this morning and he loves it! I tasted it myself and immediately noticed that not as sugary as the Earth's Best apple yogurt oatmeal and pear apple oatmeal. I checked the label of those 3 oatmeal products and by far Sprout has the least sugar in it. Granted it is also the least volume among the three but not by much(maybe an ounce difference). It has the right consistency and tastes great, above all it is organic and made in the US.

I wasn't really sure how baby Chase was going to like packaged, room temperature baby food that was not created with his formula.  I thought I would try it at home before I learned the hard way that he did not like it.  WRONG!  Baby Chase LOVED this oatmeal with apples and cinnamon.  It smelled wonderful.  This was a great first packaged food.  This is now a pantry staple for my baby and I am also going to give a few more Sprout recipes a try.  A+

review/summary: Extremely disappointing product - Mothers Beware - the first ingredient is apple juice
review/text: My son has typically loved the Sprout foods and is a very good eater - with the exception of this oatmeal with roasted cinnamon applesauce product.<br /><br />The product is extremely disappointing as the first and main ingredient is Apple Juice and not real apples (though apples do follow in the ingredient's list).<br /><br />Due to the juice content, the consistency and flavor of this product does not match the other baby foods that have whole foods in the ingredients.  The product tastes more liquidy with the taste of apple juice, and my son refused to eat it.<br /><br />When reviewing the baby food options, I strongly recommend that you consider another selection and not waste your money.

review/text: I bought this for Christmas for my wife who is from France. She was very surprised and said it was excellent. I would buy this Foie Gras again. This company sells different types of Foie Gras, they have a Grade A or B, they have de-veined and they have fully cooked. This was a Grade A which was not de-veined, but it only had 1 small vein in it which was very easy to remove. We spread this Foie Gras on toast and also cooked some on top of deer tenderloin & backstrap. I think this Fois Gras is the closest you'll get to the traditional French Foie Gras. It arrived in a styrofoam cooler box with 4 freezer packs in it and it was still cold when delivered. I give it a 5 stars and will buy it again.

After removing the veins I cured the lobes in salt and brandy. I recommend Jacques Pepin's recipe from his "Christmas Celebration" dvd. I sealed the lobes in plastic wrap and foil but it was too late to serve them on Christmas Eve, so I waited until a pre-New Year's Eve party. I served the cured foie-gras with cherry jam and sliced baguette, along with some candied walnuts. It was gone in twenty minutes. Everyone complimented on the smooth texture and taste of the liver.<br /><br />I will be ordering this from now on every Christmas.

review/summary: If you knew how it was produced
review/text: If you knew how foie gras was produced, you probably wouldn't buy it. Ducks are intensively raised from birth, their toes cut off so that their talons don't have to be maintained. They are manhandled so forcefully that many ducks break wings or legs or sometimes even necks. They are forced into individual cages and remain there, until they are forcefed fat through long metal tubes, to swell their livers. They are given so much food that they struggle to breathe. This happens 3 times a day. Sometimes, the ducks don't survive this maltreatment, and their bodies are thrown into wastebins.<br /><br />I am not a vegetarian but I believe that it is wrong to intensively raise animals in this way. Please show your support and boycott the sale of foie gras.

Edward & Sons is the only brand that they can eat.  We're so appreciative that someone makes a rice cracker that doesn't have lots of extraneous ingredients added.<br /><br />The flavor on all their crackers is wonderful, even the plain.  They always snap and are a wonderful little size.  We use them to eat hummus or eat them all by themselves.<br /><br />It's a wonderful product.  Amazon beats the discount my local natural food store can offer me when ordering a case.  We get these through the s&s program which makes the price even better.

When I saw them on sale on Amazon I JUMPED.  They are a bit anorexic relative to the size I expected and they are definitely SWEET.  Kudos to them for making something this sweet a 100 calories.  Don't think this will act as a good snack, you would need 2-3 of them to make you semi-satisfied but they are yummy.
