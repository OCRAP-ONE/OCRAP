review/summary: A chocolate winner
review/text: I tried the double chocolate version and I think Kellogg's got a winner, if you are ok with a chocolate cereal (but it's made with "Real Chocolate," as it says on the box, so it's GOT to be better, right?) The ingredients list didn't seem all the bad to me, so since my son likes chocolate and he doesn't eat breakfast sometimes, this, at least, is something he likes and will eat.<br /><br />I tried them as a snack and, I have to admit, there is something nice about the texture and taste. Crunchy, not too filling. In milk, the outer layer soaks up the milk and produces chocolate milk (they should call it Triple Chocolate Cereal).<br /><br />The main thing people are probably going to point out is that the filling is not exactly how they depict it on the box. The picture on the box is definitely an idealized version. In reality, the chocolate on the inside is not plentiful and oozing out if you bite it in half. In fact, many of the cereal pieces, which seem to vary in size, don't appear to have anything on the inside. In the ones that do, the chocolate stuffing is not really that noticeable, but you can detect it's there. No big deal, in my opinion.

review/summary: Mmmmm...Chocolatey
review/text: I've never been a big fan of cereal.  I think the main reason for this is that once you add the milk most cereals start to turn soggy and I prefer my food to stay pretty much the same texture when I'm eating it.<br /><br />Krave cereal is no exception to that.  Once you put the milk in the outside shell does start to get soggy.  That's really the only knock on it.  The inside with its liquid chocolate does give you a nice chocolatey burst with every bite, which makes it better than traditional cocoa-flavored cereals.<br /><br />And it's supposedly good for you, so that's win-win in my book.<br /><br />That is all.

review/summary: Just Ok, More For Adult Tastes
review/text: This cereal has a very fresh, very light outer shell, with a creamy chocolate center.  I have to admit, the creamy center takes a bit getting used to, as one doesn't typically associate that texture with cereal.  I'd also like to point out that many of the pieces were missing this creamy center.<br /><br />After the first few bites I thought this cereal was tasty--a very dark chocolate flavor, and not overly sweet.  But it has an odd aftertaste that was soon turning me off.  It is definitely an "adult" cereal--kids who love Cocoa Puffs and Cocoa Krispies will probably not like it.  I urged my two teens to try it when they came home from school and they both made faces like they were eating poison.  One said, "Ewwwww" and the other said, "That's so disgusting."<br /><br />When milk is added, the cereal quicly turns to a bowl of mush.  It is better as a snack straight from the box.<br /><br />Would I buy this again?  No.  While I don't think it's horrible, it's not great, either.  I don't see this cereal faring well in overall cereal sales.

review/summary: Better than Cocoa Puffs!
review/text: Kellog's Krave Double Chocolate Cereal is chocolate, crunchy and satisfying. I liked it with soy milk or almond milk, but plain old cow juice would be fine. It has a light, crisp texture and a real chocolate flavor. For me, it's probably better for that late-night craving even than for breakfast, but a bowl of chocolate crunchy stuff, milk and a piece of fruit wouldn't be a bad start for any old day.

review/summary: They taste much better without milk!!
review/text: This cereal tastes amazing and I am NOT a huge chocolate lover.  The outside is crunchy chocolate and the inside has a creamy chocolate center.  As with most breakfast cereal, this is fortified with vitamins and minerals which gives a nutritional offset to the high sugar content.<br /><br />Now for the bad news-This cereal gets soggy fast. It looses all chocolate flavor and the flavor does not transfer to the milk.  You end up with a bowl of blech.<br /><br />Since I prefer my cereal dry...this works just fine for me.  I would purchase this again but only if it were on sale.

review/summary: Oh My God, This is Amazing
review/text: My wife and I have seen the Krave cereal in stores, but we havenever bothered to pick it up. She's pretty much a chocolate Mini-Wheats person and I am more a Honey Nut Cheerios person (Unless they bring back Smurfberry Crunch). We had a choice of either box as an Amazon Vine option and I chose to do the double chocolate thinking the wife would like it better. Little did I suspect that we would try a few handfulls dry for a texture and taste sample...and then proceed to eat nearly the entire box in one day. Both of us are pretty physical fit people that watch our wastelines and exercise regularly, buy man oh man, did we keep coming back to the box for "just one more taste." This cereal is delicious and we'll be picking up another box (and probably the other flavour) until we get sick of it or Kellog's decides not to make it any more (ala General Mill's and my beloved childhood favorite Fruity Yummy Mummy).<br /><br />I was really happy to see that there was no high fructose corn syrup in Krave and that it's actually pretty nutritous for a chocolate cereal. It's low in fst, has no cholesterol and has a decent amount of fiber. A single serving is only 120 calories and there are only 10 grams of sugar, whichs urprised me as it has a nice sweet taste to it. There really is no downside to the cereal. Our household is really happy with it (even the rabbits!) and we'll definitely be getting this again.

review/summary: Fantastic Chocolate Fix that is really good!
review/text: This is a fantastic snack food and oh so chocolately.  I really think this is the best tasting cereal I have had in a long time and now instead of heading for the cookies and candy I grab a baggie of this.  What's even better is to mix it with popcorn so that you have that salty chocolate yumminess that just makes you want to sit down with a movie or a good book and nibble along the way.<br /><br />I honestly don't care about how many calories this might have as I'm sure it's less than other snacks that I've eaten and really it comes from a company that goes wayyyyyyy bsck to when I was a kid and is one company that I have loved and trusted over the years.<br /><br />Krave has a nice crunchy outside with a really delicious chocolate middle that is sure to please.  I also bought some of the the other flavor which has a white outside and chocolate inside and mix them together.  I do hope this stays around for some time as I'm in love with it.  YUMM!

review/summary: tastes great both dry and in milk
review/text: I am not sure if it is possible to have a more chocolate tasting cereal than Krave. There is a very light coating of chocolate inside the rectangles giving each piece a lot of extra chocolate taste. Krave tastes great both dry and in milk. If you like chocolate, I would definitely give this one a try.

review/summary: A Chocolately Treat
review/text: Kellogg's Krave Double Chocolate cereal is fully of chocolatey goodness. While I think the chocolate taste is a bit much for breakfast, I can see this being a treat for a snack around our house on occasion. We are fairly picky about our cereal as no one likes it to get soggy quickly once the milk is added. Unfortunately, the outer shell of the Krave cereal does absorb the milk quickly so it looses its crunch fast. I think I actually prefer it as a dry snack because there is a better contrast in texture between the crispy outer shell and the chocolate filling inside.<br /><br />Most cereals these days don't really make for a nutritious breakfast and Krave Double Chocolate is no different. It does have 3 grams of fiber per serving but also has a lot of sugar and little protein.<br /><br />Now that I've had the Double Chocolate Krave, I'm curious about the original version as well. I know neither version will be a regular item on our grocery list but we like the Double Chocolate for a bit of a treat now and then.

review/summary: Great cereal, but $5 a box is too much.
review/text: I first heard about this cereal when it was only available in the UK, and I kraved it enough that I wrote to Kelloggs asking them to sell it here in the US. When it finally showed up in the US this year I was ecstatic, and purchased one of each variety. The Chocolate one was a bit bland, but the Double Chocolate one is like eating a bowl full of happy. The only problem is that it disappears too fast! The Safeway near me apparently stopped selling it now, so I came looking for it on Amazon, but $5 a box is too much for how small these boxes are. I've been buying it at $2-3 a box, and I'd say that's the perfect price.<br /><br />One final note: I really wish Kelloggs would release the Hazelnut version here, as that's the one I was most wanting when I first heard about it.

review/summary: Delicious with Almond milk
review/text: From the commercial this looked like a chocolatey cereal but wow, I did't expect it to be soooo chocolatey. I had it with Silk Almond milk and it was quite delicious. I love chocolate and this will definitely curb a craving for even the most gigantic Toblerone. My boyfriend said it belonged in trail mix because it was too sweet for him, but he couldn't put it down either, eating it dry.  I can see this as a curl up on the couch movie-night cereal.

review/summary: Warning: May Prove Addictive
review/text: You can eat this cereal dry.  Or you can eat this cereal with milk.  The experience is, well, different depending on the situation.  It's slightly crispy with a soft center when eaten on its own, but adding milk changes the consistency pretty fast, so be warned if you do not like mushy cereal.<br />However, the taste is surprisingly subtle.  I'm not a fan of sugary cereals early in the day but I enjoy them later so I was surprised that when I ate it with milk the chocolate flavor was complimented by the milk flavor to make a delicious but not overwhelming breakfast.  Likewise, I tried some later in the day on its own and Krave Double Chocolate provided a slightly crunchy, somewhat chocolatey, but not too sweet or too dry treat.<br />The only real quibble is that it's likely to get stuck in your teeth no matter how it's eaten and the texture has something to be desired after chowing down on several at once or after its sat in your cereal bowl for a few minutes; but, in terms of taste and flexibility, this cereal's a winner.

review/summary: addicting
review/text: I'm a healthy eater with a closet chocolate addiction... I'd LIKE to be organic, but have to sneak in the cocoa puffs. Well, I don't have to do that anymore, this cereal can compete with cocoa puffs in every way. I was worried that the flavor may be off, even though it says 'real chocolate' I'm a skeptic, but nope, fills that addiction quite nicely with real chocolate flavor, and I knew this the first bite I took. yum!<br /> My only gripe, which probably wouldn't bother anyone else but me is the name, "Krave" makes me feel marketed to, and I will go very far out of my way to avoid marketing, it makes me feel managed, and the name feels like it's targeting people who love chocolate a little blatantly... but the taste is great, so I give it a thumbs up.

review/text: I sat down to a big bowl of Kellogg's Krave just this morning, and was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  I must say, at first I was quite skeptical about it, as it appeared to be just another sugary choco cereal of no distinction.  While wouldn't classify it as my favorite breakfast cereal, for those who love chocolate in their breakfast, this is pretty darn yummy.  Highly recommended!

review/text: I honestly did not have high expectations for Kellogg's Krave Cereal since chocolate cereal has never been a favorite for me.  I did, however, take a chance on Krave since my family does like the chocolaty morning experience.  Much to my surprise, it was very good:  crunchy fiber with some chocolate taste on the outside and a smooth chocolate center.  Best of all, it did not have the overly sweetened taste of its chocolate cereal competitors.  My family, not surprisingly, loved it but I have found I like it best dry as it makes quite a good snack.  I think they have a winner here.

review/summary: Best Chocolate Breakfast Cereal Ever Made
review/text: Best chocolate cereal ever made IMHO. Krave tastes sort of like Oreos combined with Fudge Pop-Tarts. It's weird because they aren't frosted really, but somehow the insides impart a sense of being frosted. More chocolate-y than Cocoa Pebbles or Count Chocula. Although they are in the shape of squares, they aren't as hard or rocky as Cap'n Crunch and Krave doesn't get soggy very quickly. Unlike Cocoa Krispies, the chocolate doesn't diffuse into the milk very quickly. With Cocoa Krispies, you very quickly get regular soggy Rice Krispies in chocolate milk. This cereal stays more as chocolate cereal and the milk as regular milk. And it doesn't give you as much of a "chemical-buzz" as a lot of presweetened cereal does.<br /><br />I am not even going to try and make it anything about nutrition. People buy sweet cereals for the taste, and for their kids. Having tasted all the chocolate cereals out there since I was a little kid, my opinion is that this is the best chocolate cereal currently being made. Watch out if you like chocolate, because I think kids and parents who like chocolate might battle over this stuff. It could become addictive.

review/summary: Tasty, if you like chocolate at breakfast!
review/text: This new cereal consists of little squares of multigrain, shredded-wheat type material around a chocolate center.  I like the taste, although chocolate for breakfast is not necessarily that appealing to me.  I have a suspicion that this cereal is meant as a way for parents to get kids to eat a relatively low-calorie, high-fiber cereal for breakfast.  Kids who might reject regular shredded wheat -- I always hated it! -- will probably be willing to eat this cereal because of the strong chocolate flavor.  For what it's worth, the cereal becomes very soggy, very fast when you add milk.  Much more so than other cereals I'm familiar with, such as Cheerios.

review/summary: Almost Shocked How Good This Is, But Might Not Be For Every Day
review/text: As someone who unfortunately gravitates toward junk food, something that tastes like dessert while offering some vitamins and fiber is a nice find.<br /><br />It is not a cereal that can be left in milk for a long time, but what I found neat (and a bit odd) was that some bites tasted good, but some bites were great, and I think that means there is a "peak milk exposure time" or whatever where the creaminess of the center actually does taste really creamy. This is not something I've tasted before in a cereal.  Obviously it can't compare with the center of a Valrhona lava cake, but for a breakfast cereal, it was surprisingly chocolaty.<br /><br />When comparing it a box of Red Berries Special K (not a totally apples to apples comparison - see below), Double Chocolate Krave doesn't do nearly as badly as most sweet kids' cereals.  They both have 3g of fiber, and Krave has 25% US RDA of a large number of vitamins (even without considering milk).  True, the Special K (which is touted as a healthy cereal) has 35% or 45% of most of those vitamins, but Krave as a bit of zinc which Special K doesn't. By the way, Special K has a chocolate variety which is also pretty darn good as long you don't mind feeling like you're having mini-Hershey Bars mixed in with your breakfast cereal.<br /><br />The flip side: Krave has a small amount of saturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, and monounsaturated fat, which seems unusual for cereal. Also, I noticed that Krave's serving size is only 3/4 Cup while Special K is 1 Cup, so the fact that they appear to have the same amount of calories (120 per serving) isn't accurate.  On the other hand, I suppose that means Krave is actually doing a bit BETTER with vitamins than it appears if you were to extrapolate how much it would give you in an equal-sized serving.<br /><br />Also, there are wheat (Krave is multi-grain), soy and milk ingredients (the center of each piece of the cereal really is a bit creamy when moist) so people who eat dry cereal only because of lactose intolerance probably can't have this variety.  Last, this cereal settles a bit heavy in the stomach, and perhaps it's slightly rich, or perhaps it's because the chocolate is processed with alkali. If you've noticed that chocolate donuts make you feel a bit ill when you normally can have chocolate just fine, I suspect it might be the alkali. (The same I think is true for the Chocolate Special K.)<br /><br />So don't go crazy and have a bunch of bowls of this all at once until you see how it hits your system. Even though it is definitely tasty enough for seconds.

review/text: I agree with most of the reviewers that this is much better as a dry snack than a cereal.  However, Cocoa Krispies doesn't stay crisp long enough to get thru the bowl, either, so it's not a big minus.  But the milk doesn't get all chocolatey like the other cereals do.<br /><br />The center is a touch of creamy chocolate that was a pleasant surprise, and I even learned a new word from the box.  "Chocovore."  Isn't that great?  I have always said I was a choco-phile but this is even cooler.

review/text: I was pleasantly surprised that the Kellogg Krave cereal was not as sweet as I thought they'd be; I imagined they would be just another cloyingly sweet kid's cereal.  The sweetness is held in check, fortunately, and the amount of sugar per serving size is acceptable.  The exterior whole grain shell reminds me of chocolate Chex, and the soft interior reminds me of Nutella.  They tasted better as a dry snack; once I added milk, they turned into a mushy mess in my bowl.  One annoying characteristic that I did not like was the tendency for bits of Krave to lodge in my teeth after eating.  I believe this is due to the textural difference between exterior and soft interior filling.

review/summary: Very Disappointing!
review/text: These are small bite-sized nuggets of cereal with a chocolate center. I got them thinking it would be a good snack when I had a chocolate craving. The whole grains give the cereal a healthy aspect. And I figured with the chocolate center there would be plenty of chocolate that I should be in a chocolate induced coma after eating it. Sadly, this was not the case.<br /><br />I first ate this as a dry snack in the afternoon. From the picture on the box, I thought the cereal pieces would be bigger. They were slightly more crumbly than a normal chocolate cereal. Then I bit into them and couldn't find the chocolate filling. I broke several apart and found a hollow space for the filling but found nothing. After munching on a couple handfuls I thought I detected a filling. I broke another piece open and found this super faint layer of chocolate inside the piece. Here I was expecting a nice blast of chocolate and got a super light hint. They were also gritty. The only thing I can think of is that is from the whole grains.<br /><br />When I had them with milk, I was not impressed. The first thing I notice is it felt like eating super puffed up dirt. The only chocolate taste I got was from the filling to the puff. The rest had no taste and was super gritty, which was probably the whole grains.<br /><br />I have to say that this is one of the nastiest tasting cereals on the market. The only way it is healthy is the whole grains that taste and have the consistency of dirt. Yes, when you eat the cereal dry you can taste the chocolate, but soaked in milk is horrible.<br /><br />Some people subject themselves to all of the above in the name of healthy eating, which, if you are one of those people, you will probably like this cereal. Otherwise, save your money and buy some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00555HFTY">Cocoa Puffs Cereal</a>. They have the exact same concept but with a real chocolate taste and better consistency.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.

review/summary: Chocolate Whammy!
review/text: Kellogg's new Double Chocolate Krave is more like a dessert than a breakfast cereal. Seriously, that is how I eat it. Instead of some slightly more decadent alternative after diner, a bowl of Krave satisfies my sweet tooth nicely. And it isn't that unhealthy if you manage to keep it to the 3/4 cup serving size.<br /><br />That's the trick though. This cereal is addictive. After polishing off a bowl it is very tempting to go back for a refill. 16 grams of sugar becomes 32, then 48 ...you get the idea. This is not a diabetic or diet friendly food. Freshly doused in milk the cereal "pillows" and a satisfying crunch followed by the release of the creamy chocolate filling. I wish there was a bit more of the filling, but ironically the label indicates it to be the primary ingredient. Krave does get mushy rather quickly, but I've found that I inhale a bowl so fast that it isn't an issue.<br /><br />While not as over-sugared as some, Double Chocolate Krave is your standard fare Kellogg's breakfast cereal geared towards kids with a sweet tooth or adults who want to indulge. It does have a slight aftertaste and the usual  assortment of over-processed ingredients, preservatives, and vitamin & mineral additives. This is a cereal that I would only serve or eat as an occasional treat and not something I would carbo-load my kids with in the morning before school. If sweet chocolately flavor is not your thing in a cereal, then Krave definitely isn't for you. Chocovores, however, may have just found a new favorite.<br /><br />~ Kort

The magic seems to happen when the cereal is combined with milk. Once the cereal has milk on it the chocolate inside does become creamy and smooth. It is not like eating pieces of candy bars, but it has a very delicious chocolate flavor.<br /><br />There are so many different cereal flavors available, I would think creating a new one that would stick would be a challenge. I think Kellogg did a good job with chocolate Krave. It is different than other cereals out there, and after a couple of bites the chocolate flavor becomes addicting. The cereal claims to be whole grain and nutritious. Having a bowl of this cereal, instead of a bowl of ice cream could be a diet improvement, but it is a sweetened processed cereal, although it does taste chocolaty and yummy.

review/summary: Super Chocolaty Sugared Cereal
review/text: Basically, if you're looking for the most chocolaty breakfast cereal you can get, this is a contender.  If you're not a fan of sugared cereals or of chocolate, then this probably isn't for you.<br /><br />Double Chocolate Krave is composed of crunchy chocolate pillow-shaped bites, with a smoother chocolate filling inside.  The outside tastes a little bit like slightly burnt brownies to me, but not offensively so -- sort of like the crunchy leftovers in the bottom of a brownie pan.  The inside has a smoother chocolaty taste.  In milk, this cereal comes into its own -- the filling tastes smoother and more pronounced, and the cereal very tasty overall, albeit VERY chocolate tasting for a breakfast cereal.<br /><br />After trying it, both of my kids demanded that we buy more, and prefer it to Cocoa Puffs.  I'm not sure that I'm happy about that, but they give it a thumbs up regardless.<br /><br />Nutritionally, it's similar to other sugared cereals - 3/4 cup dry cereal is 120 calories, with 10 grams sugar, 3 grams fiber, and the usual vitamin fortification.  The ingredients are mostly natural (but of course highly processed) with some chemicals for color and flavor.<br /><br />All in all, if you are interested in eating chocolate for breakfast, this is definitely worth a try.<br /><br />Update 3/20/12: This is now both of my daughters' favorite cereal.  They go through two boxes a week and have probably eaten ten boxes since the date of my review.  Take that as an endorsement or a warning, as you choose.

review/summary: Eat fast!
review/text: I named this review Eat Fast! because after pouring milk over the chocolatey nuggets, they quickly lost their crunchiness and turned mushy, gritty, and sticky. The cereal sticks to your teeth and you'll be chasing little gritty bits with your tongue. Imagine taking the chocolate wafers of Oreo cookies and soaking them in milk and you get a sense of the taste and mushy texture, but the grittiness is added. It is kind of like a cornmeal grit sensation (not in taste though). Also the nuggets are not nearly as chocolatey as the Oreo wafer, but it reminded me of dunking Oreo chocolate wafers in milk. There is a bit of an aftertaste, but that is typical of many chocolate-flavored products. The milk doesn't turn chocolately like it does with some other chocolately cereals. I actually like it when the milk turns to chocolate milk, but you won't get that here. I actually liked these better eating them dry than in milk. So I also scored them when eaten dry:<br /><br />Ability to stay crunchy in milk: 0/5<br />Chocolatey taste in milk: 2/5<br />Chocolately taste eaten dry: 3/5<br />Texture in milk:  1/5<br />Texture eaten dry: 3/5<br />Sweetness in milk: 1/5<br />Sweetness eaten dry: 2/5<br /><br />Overall Score: 12/35 or 1.5 out of 5 stars, but I'll round up to 2 stars.<br /><br />Recommendation to Kellogg's: Make the cereal much, much crunchier! Do something to it to keep it crunchier in milk. Also increase the sweetness a bit more to bring out the flavor.<br /><br />Forensics: The box shows a Krave nugget cut open to reveal chocolate oozing from inside. In reality if you cut these open, nothing oozes out. They are hollow with no oozing chocolate at all. Instead there is an internal chocolate-flavored coating that once you start chewing on the nugget, it melts and gives the sensation of a liquid center.

review/text: Only 3 grams of fiber, maximum vitamin content does not exceed 35% on any of the listed vitamins, 160 calories with 1/2 cup of skim milk per serving, 30 calories from fat, not for those with milk, soy, or wheat allergies. Tastes good and does not irritate the roof of the mouth.  Appeals to a broad variety of people due to the chocolate flavor so temps young and old alike. Great "adult" cereal to have around for when the grandkids visit as they will likely eat it. Not overly sweet.

review/summary: Tasty Chocolate Cereal
review/text: Kellog's Krave lives up to it's packaging. It has a crunchy chocolate flavored outer layer, and a creamy, chocolate flavored center. It's actually tasty as a dry snack, and fine in a bowl of milk (if you don't allow it to get too soggy). It doesn't have a "real" chocolate flavor, but it's a reasonable substitute. Although the calorie count is 120 per serving, keep in mind that it's for 3/4 of a cup when many other cereals are based on a one-cup serving. AND, there are 10 grams of sugar in one serving of Krave... perhaps a reason why you might start to crave more servings. I wouldn't eat this for breakfast, but it might occasionally satisfy my desire for dessert in the evening by having a small bowl to snack on with a glass of milk. As a replacement for a high-sugar and high-calorie treat, this is a winner, but for a morning cereal... I'd keep searching.

review/text: I have yet to try this product personally, because it is not currently available at our supermarket. But my mother,  soon will be 94, mildly diabetic and a long-time customer for sugar-free products, says they are the best! For some reason our store carries the other Murray varieties, but not this one any more, maybe because there are so many kinds. Mother picks out her own groceries, and was in the habit of buying these about every other week. She bought two other Murray's packages this week, but really wanted the peanut butter. That's why I went searching the internet for them. After I receive them, (12 boxes!) I probably will keep at least one box to try for myself. (It would be nice to be able to buy an assortment from Amazon rather than so many of one variety--that would be a lot for a 94-year-old woman to eat, even if they are that good!)

review/summary: No Health Benefits and Grossly Overpriced....Read the Nutrition Facts
review/text: My wife just brought home a $3 package containing 5.5 oz of Murray Sugar Free Pecan Shortbread cookies, thinking the high price was justified on a health basis. It isn't. Read the Nutrition Facts (per 3 cookies): 160 Calories, 11 Grams of Fat, 3 Grams of Saturated Fat, 18 Grams of Carbohydrate....the same, or worse, than most cookies containing sugar. These cookies may be "sugar free", but the implied health benefit is completely imaginary. Furthermore, at over 50 cents per ounce they are the most expensive packaged grocery cookies you can buy, which is completely unjustified by ingredient cost, and flavor, which is adequate but not exceptional.<br /><br />It's an unfortunate fact that some companies prey upon consumers who seek or need "special" products by forcing them to pay huge premiums for the product. Using Murray's formula, a can of Diet Coke should cost at least $3....but it doesn't, simply because production costs do not justify the premium and the market will not tolerate such an unconscionable mark-up. Neither should you. Don't let your health or dietary concerns override your common sense and lead you to pay preposterously inflated prices for "special" products that, upon close inspection, provide no legitimate benefit.

I like a bite of sweet at night but sugar keeps me awake so these fit the bill. The special that was going on when I got them made it a great deal. They cost up to $3.99 a pack where I live.....so this is a SWEET deal.<br /><br />They still have calories so you cannot eat the whole bag but they don't spike your sugar.

review/text: Love these cookies! When I learned a couple of years ago that I was heading toward diabetes and needed to cut out as much sugar as I could I knew I needed a "sweet" substitute.  I tried various products and found Murray Sugar Free cookies. I like oatmeal cookies anyway so gravitated toward their cookie. I promise I couldn't tell they didn't have sugar in them. I'm so addicted to them that I even carry them when I travel (wonder what the suitcase inspectors think?!) My grandkids even recognize MY cookies and now ask for them over the sugar-loaded kind. Trouble is, I can never find them. I don't know if they're just very popular or the wholesaler doesn't bring enough. It could be that I buyt 4 to 6 packages every time I DO find them. Murray says I can find them at Wal-Mart but never have although they do have the other flavors. Now I look to Amazon and they don't have them either! I have a hint of how drunks feel when they can't get their liquor! Please, Amazon, hurry and get a supply before I run out!

review/summary: Diabetics With A Sweet-Tooth --- REJOICE!
review/text: When I was diagnosed with type-II diabetes about two years ago, it felt like a death blow. I mean, I love sweets. And my favorite were peanut butter cookies (my wife also made a mean peanut butter cheesecake that I still crave to this day but am able to hold off thanks to these Murray Sugar Free Cookies). I'd tried other sugar free items but they all had a seriously bad after-taste to them. The artificial sweetners were pretty bad.<br /><br />But the Murray brand are pretty darned good. And I can eat about 6 of them that equal 32 carbs (I'm a tall guy --- 6 feet, three inches --- with a big frame). There's no horrible after-taste and the peanut butter flavor is just enough to satisfy my slavering pallete.<br /><br />If you're looking for a quality cookie that won't shoot your blood sugar up into the statosphere, these are a great option.

review/summary: Fab, as long as you understand what's in them!
review/text: My fiance & I are following a reduced carbohydrate eating plan.  Given that these are sugar free, they are great for when you need something sweet, but with a slighter glycemic impact than regular cookies.<br />They taste almost like Girl Scout Thin Mint patty cookies!  They are NOT, however, low in calories, or free from ingredients that some may feel are "unhealthy".<br />Since people's ideas vary greatly as to what is bad for them & what is okay, there is some understandable controversy.  In my opinion, most of America is over weight because they don't know HOW to eat, but that's just my take on things.  Everything is conflicting.  Low carbohydrate foods are higher in calories & vice verse.  I have an extreme digestive sensitivity to Malitol (Maltitol), which is a sweetener used in most sugar free chocolate items.  While these cookies don't contain Malitol (Maltitol),there are very few items available that are without it.<br />Bottom Line: They taste great!  My suggestion would be to check the ingredient list & nutritional information each & every time you purchase, I recommend purchasing in a grocery store, rather than online.

Some products that advertised as being sugar free have a lot of other sources of sugar, like alcohol, that are high. The feeling I get with Murray's is that they are reliable in their claims. I see them in all sorts of reputable publications and that gives me encouragement regarding their advertisement. As to the taste I can say they are pretty good tasting. Have tried their other ones and this one and the chocolate are the ones I favor. Who am I? Hungry hungry all the time for sweets but I realize not all sugar free items are created equal. For now a decent 4 stars rating!

What was surprising, however, was that I liked them, too!  As a rule, I do not like peanut butter anything, and can barely stand the smell of it.  But these cookies aren't your typical peanut butter cookie.  They are pleasantly fragrant, delicately buttery and crisp (no mealiness like most others), with good-sized pieces of peanuts mixed in.

review/summary: Good Crunchy Oatmeal Cookies. I prefer soft chewy...
review/text: Good cookies. They're made with Splenda. I guess that makes them sugarfree. They certainly don't taste like they are. I despise the taste of fake sweetners, but the folks at this company did a great job. The cookies are very yummy! I only gave it four stars, because I prefer soft  and chewy oatmeal cookies.

We went online to Murray website and ordered a box.  We are very happy with the product.

I also love the fact that they're portioned out for me.<br />I can't say enough about these cookies and cannot wait until they're available on the shelves again!  Please hurry, Murray! :)

review/summary: wonderful alternative
review/text: My favorite uncle is diabetic, and I always feel awful when I invite him for my birthday and he can't join in on eating cake with the rest of us. I picked up a package of these and used them for a cookie crust on a cream pie with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HVD4">Jell-O Sugar-Free Instant Pudding & Pie Filling, Chocolate, 1.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)</a> and whipped cream lightly sweetened with non-sugar sweetener. The result was gorgeous and tasted pretty good even to those of us who can have sugar. For him? He told me "You know I can't have sugar." and when I told him it was sugar free he dug in with gusto. He said "It's not even my birthday and I feel like I got the best present."<br />It was so easy to make, and the crust was his favorite part. I gave him an extra package of cookies I bought and he enjoyed those a lot too.<br />Love these for making it so much easier to make special treats for my uncle.

review/summary: Big Chocolate Taste
review/text: I could EASILY gain 15-20lbs from Halloween until New Years Day so this year my husband and I decided to try not to go overboard on all the cookies/candy that is so available.<br /><br />I bought these cookies thinking they would be a poor substitute but SURPRISE, they really do have a huge chocolately taste and while they won't take the place of home-made fudge or gourmet chocolates, they are still satisfying.<br /><br />They are tiny, not much bigger than a life saver really and come in 80 calorie packages so I don't have to worry about portion control. Also, it can be hard to get enough fiber in your diet every day so I like the fact that these have 3 grams of fiber per package. My husband is a type II diabetic and these do have 16 grams of carbs but because of the fiber, they don't spike his blood sugar.<br /><br />The only downside to these is they do have 3g sugar alcohol which can cause some people stomach upset.<br /><br />I'm still probably going to have goodies this holiday season but with these cookies in my pantry, I know I won't indulge as often.

review/text: So I have tried all the Torani vanilla syrups and this one tastes the best to me by far. The french vanilla is too sweet and fake tasting, the plain vanilla is fine, but this one imparts a more intense vanilla flavor. I'm a huge fan. My kids mostly love it to flavor their milk, cold or hot. Hey, it doesn't stain like chocolate milk, so that's a plus. Also adds awesome flavor to cocoa. We're not coffee drinkers but I'm sure people use it for that, and I have also tasted ice cream flavored with this that was the best soft serve ice cream of my life. Also delicious made into Italian sodas, using club soda, 2 oz. of syrup, and some half and half. Be forewarned that the three-pack usually comes in plastic bottles, rather than glass. A plus for shipping, maybe not as pretty sitting on a shelf, and less recyclable. Just FYI.

I add vanilla to almost everything since I find that it enhances flavors. Next on my list to try is the French vanilla...

review/summary: Torani Vanilla Bean Syrup
review/text: Not to sure about the distinct differences between this and the (regular) Vanilla Flavor Syrup....<br />My barista son says there is a difference....<br /><br />This is good to me as the other non-bean titled syrup...

review/text: I love using subscribe and save for all of our Torani Syrups. They taste great, I use the Ghirardelli Chocolate sauce and Gene Hicks Big Fat Espresso Bean with my Jura Z5 Espresso Machine. The combination makes a great Espresso and the price on Amazon can't be beat anywhere I look.

review/summary: Best BBQ sauce EVER!!!
review/text: Tried Salt Lick on a recent trip to Austin and LOVED IT. It was so great that I bought up a few bottles to take back with me (I wish I would have bought more!!!). It is quite possibly my favorite bbq sauce (love the original and spicy) and will definitely be purchasing more via Amazon!!!

review/summary: Great Morning Pick-up
review/text: This is a great beverage that has a hint of sweetness to it.  There are several coffee pre-made products on the market these days.  One of the downsides to purchasing these products is being unable to control the sugar content or the quality of coffee.  You have neither of these issues with this drink!!!!  I typically drink black coffee with little to no sugar, but have to say this drink was refreshing compared to other pre-made coffee drinks on the market.  You can tell the quality of coffee is excellent and the sweetness is mild, where other brand drinks are comparable to a mocha milkshake.  I absolutely recommend this to anyone on the go looking for a good morning coffee fix!

review/summary: Morning happiness!
review/text: I'm not a hardcore coffee drinker in that I like more of a coffee drink than black coffee, Turkish coffee, etc. I LOVE the colors and textures of Energy coffee. Every morning I look forward to drinking one or two cans of this. It starts my day off right for so many reasons. I highly recommend it! (I also like the Rescue flavor).

review/summary: Great Nuts as Advertised
review/text: These were great high quality peanuts.  Every peanut in the bag was fresh and looked great. We followed the Sugar Coated Peanut Recipe on the bag.  My grandmother used to make these every Christmas for years.  They were amazing... just like the sugar coated roasted nuts you would find on a street corner in NYC.  The nuts were received only a few days after ordering.  I will buy these again in the future.

review/summary: Yummy Deliciousness!!
review/text: By far, these are the MOST delicious brownies I've ever eaten!!  If you want to treat yourself or thank your friends, order these now.  They are so moist and rich with flavor.  We've had the double dark and the peanut butter - love them both.  They are all laced with caramel and dusted with powered sugar, which just give them that extra something special we've never experienced in another brownie. Anyone we've ever sent them to raves about them constantly.
