review/text: My wife and I love these pumpkin seeds and can only get small bags where we live so it is quick and easy to order a whole box from Amazon.  They are a great source of fiber, but tend to be a little on the salty side.  A delicious snack for people on the go.

review/summary: Partially Satisfied
review/text: I bought two boxes of pumpkin seeds.  The first one had a date of Nov. 7, 2009.  These were really good and crunchy.  Every one had a nice "snap" to it.  But then I got to the second box, dated Dec. 5, 2009, and they were not good at all.  They had no crunch and were tough to chew.  I keep trying, one bag, then a second one, then a third one, with all the same results.  Very disappointing.  So I decided to call Amazon to complain.  The customer service was great, and they sent me a free second box to replace the bad one.  Well I opened it up, and it was dated Dec. 5, 2009!  So basically the same disappointing results!  I'm eating them just because that's all I have, but I'm due to receive my second shipment, and I'm anxious to see what date they have on the box, and how they taste.  As a side note, I decided to purchase a bag from the store to compare, and it was dated Feb. 10, 2010.  Much better!  So hopefully Amazon will keep sending the freshest products possible, and not boxes that have been sitting on their shelves.

review/summary: These are salty and have the shells on.
review/text: Just an FYI these have A LOT of salt, so if you're thinking about losing weight-not a good idea as salt retains water.  These are also naturally low in carbs, so if you're doing a low-carb diet this is a good choice.  But besides the fact that these are loaded with salt and if you don't mind eating the shells these are really good.  I have tried other pumpkin seeds that are out there and by comparison these have a lot less salt.  I saw one brand that had well over 3000mg of sodium while these have 940mg per serving.  Also these aren't as big as some other brands, but give them a try. They are good.  The reason I gave this review a 4 instead of a 5 is because they are salty and I've seen bigger ones.

review/text: I got hooked on pumpkin seeds about 1 year ago. They are also very good for you. They are loaded with the omega fats that you need for a well balanced diet. I like them because the seed is bigger than a sunflower seed. Buying them through Amazon is alot more cost effeicent than at the store. Where I live a 2 oz bag can run anywhere from .99 to $1.19 and the bigger bags (5oz that are offered here) are around $3.00.) I'll never buy from anywhere else again.

review/text: Obviously you can't tell from a picture whether pumpkin seeds have the shell on or not, so we assumed since they were salted that they were probably without the shell. Well, if you buy these, I hope you are the type that likes eating pumpkin seeds shells (we aren't). The seeds themselves were not very large and the shells were not easy to open. I was very disappointed. These, in my opinion, are only useful if you like eating the shell and all.

Before you rate the reviewers down for posting to the wrong product (i.e. crab cakes, shrimp cakes, or seafood-stuffed mushrooms), try to post a reply to one of the reviews, then look at the picture of the product reviewed. You'll see that the reviewers actually reviewed the correct products - but Amazon scrambled the reviews for three different products here.

(I purchase frozen food online from another retailer---everything comes with cooking directions, times, etc...I am used to superior products.)  I perused the original site online for the proper cooking directions, then followed them to the letter.  First, I tasted one mushroom right from the oven, then I waited until they cooled before the next attempt.  Then, I waited one hour and tasted the product again.  There was absolutely no taste.  I couldn't discern a crab taste or aroma; nor could I sense the taste of mushrooms.  I  felt like I had a mouthful of tasteless bread crumbs.  I'm not willing to ingest a boatload of calories while experiencing no taste, so I threw the entire tray of 9 mushrooms into the garbage.

review/summary: Coconut shrimp--coconut flavor OVERPOWERING...
review/text: We received these Omaha Steaks brand Coconut shrimp as a gift. I like coconut is some preparations (pina coladas, certain cookies), but I don't eat it as a snack. I enjoy the scent of natural coconut.<br /><br />Though these shrimp are edible, the coconut aroma and subsequent taste overpower anything else. Even from the oven, the only thing that I can smell is coconut. When eaten, they leave a strong aftertaste that for a while makes one wonder if by mistake you consumed a coconut-scented wax candle by mistake. This holds true even when drenched with cocktail sauce to try to drown out the coconut.<br /><br />I cannot imagine that the overpowering odor is natural coconut, which I find to be pleasant. One of the listed ingredients is "Artificial Flavor," which likely means that Omaha Steaks attempted to "enhance" the flavor in some way. Unfortunately, I can't tolerate the resulting smell, which is an integral part of the perceived flavor when eaten.<br /><br />In short, if you're a huge coconut fan, or if your sense of smell is inoperative, then these might be for you. If you are an occasional consumer of coconut, then proceed with great caution.

review/summary: mmmm, so delicious
review/text: My father used to get these when I was a kid.  They were never available here in the States, so we only got them when he or his family would go back home to England, which wasn't very often.  Us kids would always make sure they brought some home.  They were so delicious that he would hoard them for himself, barely able to make himself share them with his children.  Now that I can purchase them on Amazon I get to return the favor to him.  He was so delighted when I brought some over to his house.  He once again got a hold of them (I gave him only 6) before anyone else could get them.  Within seconds we couldn't find them and he wouldn't tell anyone where they went.  So I then ordered a box for my mother and sister to share.  Well he lost out on extra Crunchies, but I will make sure to order some now and then for the whole family.<br /><br />Crunchies are unlike any other candy bar available here in the States.  It is sweet chocolate poured over a sweet honeycomb center.  You will not be disappointed, everyone I have ever given one to says it is the most delicious candy bar they have ever had.

review/text: For those of you not familiar, "crunchie" bars are solid honeycomb coated with a relatively thin layer of milk chocolate. Personally, I love 'em! They're one of my all time favorite chocolate bars. They're popular both in England and here in Australia where I live.<br /><br />Not much more to say except that you can buy crunchies in a variety of pack sizes (size being determined by the number of bars included), and this 24-pack is the largest I've seen so far. It also offers the best value. Although prices on Amazon do fluctuate over time, as of the time of writing, this 24-pack will wind up costing you just a fraction of a cent over $1.12 a bar. So if you are going to go to the trouble of ordering crunchie bars over the internet, the 24 pack is probably the way to go!<br /><br />That said, it's not like these are a health food. So please... Enjoy in moderation! ;-)<br /><br />Theo.

review/text: So so sooooo goood!! Couldn't believe my luck-- 24 Crunchie bars for $21.00 and free shipping with Amazon Prime!!! I ordered on October 1, and had the candy in my hands by October 15 :) The honeycomb candy center is divine, and the chocolate coating is rich and so creamy. They taste very fresh. Sometimes I eat them slow, and sometimes I munch through a few in one sitting, either way, they are delicious.<br /><br />Great candy, arrived promptly and intact!! ^___^

I ordered them on Amazon, they came right away, and I have them hidden so I can indulge occasionally. They are not very high in calories, are light but able to satisfy my chocolate cravings.

review/summary: Very Good But A Little Salty
review/text: This is very good corn chowder with a strong garlic base. It is a little salty for my taste and seems to have a touch more rosemary than I prefer but overall very good for a dried soup mix. It is not quite as good as "Bear Creek Chunky Potato Soup Mix" that I used to buy and add corn to myself to make corn chowder, but I can't find that particular soup anymore. You must add your own fresh chopped onion, garlic, bacon, chicken broth and milk to make the soup so it is not quite as complete as some of the other dried soup mixes on the market. I would buy this product again.

review/text: You need to provide your own onion, garlic and meat (bacon and chicken or fish or lobster or clams) and dairy (almond milk works too).  The corn, potatoes and seasonings are provided then you add (or not) additional seasonings to taste.  This has become a staple chowder starter in our house and since we are trying to live a healthy lifestyle now, Canterbury Naturals ingredients are the best we have found in a mix.

review/summary: Finally!
review/text: I was introduced to the Pingvin Salt Pastiller about 5 years ago in Miami when I met some Swedish tourists who had purchased them at the Duty Free shop on their way out of the country. I was in love. This is the greatest liquorice on the planet. I don't know why I even qualified that. It's the greatest candy on the planet. According to my Swedish friends, Swedish Duty Free shops were the ONLY place to buy this treasure. Thus, as an American I've been mostly deprived of it over the past five years. I've scoured the internet over and over again, hoping someone would start carrying it, but each time I found the same thing . . . fellow non-Swedes in the same position as me--unable to get a hold of the greatest candy on earth.<br /><br />Until now. I saw this product for sale here. It's not in the traditional Pingvin Salt Pastiller packaging (the pill container--I added a photo), but it looked like it might be the same stuff. Well, I took a chance on it--ordered 3 bags to minimize the sting of shipping--and ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner. This is the real deal. The packaging is different, but the content is the same.<br /><br />Now that I'm sure, my next order will be for more like 10 or 20 bags. Get it while it's available. Who knows when this seller will close up shop?<br /><br />Note: If you've never had salt liquorice before, be warned that it is a VERY strong liquorice and it's very salty. Many non-Scandinavians are repulsed by it. I initially thought it was pretty revolting. But my repulsion very quickly became an addiction. It's an acquired taste, but one that I acquired surprisingly quickly. And now nothing else comes close.

review/summary: What bacon is supposed to be
review/text: I figured there must be bacon out there like bacon used to be - this is it.  If you are of a 'certain age' (over 40 or 50?) you remember the deep smoky flavor of a good bacon; this cannot be found in "store bacon" anymore.  Modern bacon is thin, lightly/poorly smoked - even the so-called 'gourmet' bacon.  This is the old fashioned flavor and thickness of bacon the way it was in the "good old days."  Arrives nice and cool in an ice pack - cheaper if you buy the 12-pack.

review/text: Delivered October 4, 2010.  Expires in barely two months on December 5, 2010.  I signed up for "Subscribe & Save" every six months so I could have one tin a month of this flavor, but it makes no sense to do so since four months before I get another delivery the batch will be past the expiration.  I'm really disappointed since other purchases I've made through Amazon have never had this issue.  The coffee itself is good and one of the few decafs I've tried with a nice flavor, but you need to drink it quick before you have to toss it.

review/text: We needed to find a replacement for the decaf French Vanilla because we weren't able to locate it in our area. After some research, we found the decaf Vanilla Bean Latte and decided to give it a try. We like the foamy consistency as well as the overall taste, especially the vanilla flavoring. We eventually were able to find the decaf French Vanilla but in comparison, we prefer the decaf Vanilla Bean Latte over the decaf French Vanilla and will continue to buy it.

review/summary: foamy sweet drink
review/text: I like this product a lot. It's a good substitute for hot chocolate - when you want a sweet hot drink, but don't want chocolate flavor. Also, this mix produces a nice foam - kind of like a 'real' latte!<br />It is difficult to find this product, the sugared decaf mix, in grocery stores (most carry the sugar-free decaf instead) - and I strongly prefer the sugared kind.<br />I also use it to sweeten/flavor cheap regular coffee.<br />You can make it with hot water, or with hot milk for an extra-creamy drink.<br /><br />I had heard that the "General Foods International" coffees were going to be re-branded as "Maxwell House International" coffees. So hopefully I will be able to find this same product under the new brand.

The taste is not to heavy and not too light.  It's made with real sugar, none of the fake stuff.  And, it has non-dairy creamer in it. Great flavor and MUCH cheaper than what I would pay for a cup of 'special' coffee in a restaurant.  Matter of fact, a whole can is cheaper than some cups of those special coffees in the restaurant.  Either way, I really enjoy it.

review/summary: best of the Wabash I tried
review/text: Went to the store in downtown Lake Placid. Bought a large bag of the extra-large caramel style, the red, and the purple. My wife and I agree the purple is the best. It is more dense and not chewy at all. It has a richer flavor. The red was second place, great but just not quite as good with poor popping. The extra-large was third. The extra-large was large and popped great, but it lacked the flavor and was slightly chewy. You could see that it would be great for caramel popcorn, but not for simple butter and sea-salt popcorn like we prefer. Still, they were all good.<br /><br />The correct way to pop: High heat on canola oil in a pot. Add 3 kernels. When they pop, add rest. Cover with spatter shield, this will keep the kernels in but let the steam out.<br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Good, but not the best Amish popcorn t ype
review/text: It pops into large kernels, but the flavor and texture of this popcorn just isn't as good as the Baby White from Amish. If you're looking for the perfect movie theater style popcorn, get the Baby White and skip this one. However, this popcorn isn't bad and I would prefer it over the grocery store Orville crap. I didn't have many unpopped kernels but this popcorn has fairly large hulls.

review/summary: Wabash Valley Farms Amish Gourmet Popping Corn
review/text: This one in the purple color was very nice. Pops up a very striking white color with purple undertones to it.<br /><br />Great flavor to it, nice and light. Also for quite a large bag, I was shocked these never seemed to "go stale".<br /><br />This was a great purchase to be coupled with the stir crazy popcorn popper!

review/summary: Yummy and pretty!
review/text: Beautiful popcorn when popped and when sitting on the shelf waiting. It popped both white and yellow making the bowl just look more appealing. The hulls did just explode! It was amazing, I've never had popcorn do that before. Great deal, I'm glad we bought the 6 pack. Worked out to about $2/lb. I think some people who gave a bad review must have gotten a bad batch because ours is awesome!

review/text: This popcorn does all pop. Doesn't have much taste. I will get the seasoning salt or something and see how it tastes after that. I have poured butter over it but then to me that defeats the idea of diet stuff.

review/text: First experience with Wabash Valley Farms popcorn and it is great. Ordered purple and the baby white at the same time. The purple is superior to the baby white in my estimation. Almost hulless. Very tender. Will order again.

review/summary: Meh...
review/text: Popped and tasted fine.  The corn is smaller that traditional yellow, so they tend to fly out of an air popper quite a bit.  The shipping and handling is what makes this a less than desirable deal.  Not worth $10 for 2 pounds of this popcorn.

review/summary: eye popping results
review/text: This is excellent popping corn with a light rich flavor, it pops well, has significantly less hulls than most other popping corns we have tried, tastes great, and holds flavorings and cheese well. The popped corn is smaller than many other brands and we like the flavor better.<br />Cons:<br />The un-popped kernels are lighter than many other popping corns, so a few more get blown out un-popped by our hot air popper... towards the end when the number of kernels remaining to be popped in the air-popper gets low. If you don't mind having a few un-popped kernels it's works just fine in the air-popper.<br />The quantity of each order is bit large - twelve pounds at a time (you get six two pound packages per order) which  makes this premium corn price very competitive with lesser popping corns (when buying through Amazon.com).<br />We find the quantity not to be problem though, as we like this corn better than other corns we have tried, so we use it up faster. Of course dried corn keeps very well, and we have found that our friends love receiving a package or two when we visit, and it also makes a great remembrance gift for soldiers overseas, or college students away from home.

review/text: I love the taste of this popcorn! I actually like the fact that it's smaller pieces. The middle hull part is still too tough for my poor jaw. I don't know if this would be different if I cooked it in oil, I've only used the air popper.

review/summary: Yummy, but too expensive here
review/text: The Wabash valley purple popcorn is really good & a lot fewer hulls than the regular grocery-store brand. It is the favorite in our house! However, if you go to the company's own website you can buy the 6 lb bag for $8.99 - almost twenty dollars cheaper than here! You will have to pay shipping, but even with the shipping it is still cheaper than the amazon price.

review/text: I bought this gourmet popping corn believing I was getting better than I can get a my local Trader Joe's... Wrong It was over priced, the shipping cost almost as much as the corn did and most of all the quality of the corn was terrible. The kernels were tiny and not fluffy when they did pop ...mostly they didn't pop. We could not wait to be done with this product! Also I asked to cancel the shipment before it was shipped because the shipping price was too high and still I got it.

review/text: I will not be able to commit on the flavor, because beware this popcorn is not packaged in a safe manner. It come in a plastic bag that is opened at the top, they closed it with a twist tie and nothing else to ensure a sealed closure of the popcorn, anyone can open it at anytime and then reclose it and you would never know it. I tossed it because I would worry if I let my 3 little one eat it that it was contaminated/tampered with.

review/text: We go through this sauce so quickly and unfortunately no local grocery stores stock it anymore (I check every time I enter a grocery store- it's THAT good!!).  It's so great for a dipping sauce, a condiment, an ingredient, etc.  Shipping from TeeBop is excellent too.  They've always come wrapped so well in bubble wrap it's almost a battle getting all the bottles unwrapped! It's great, and so much better than the "original" version.

review/summary: My wife loves it!
review/text: This stuff is hard to find but well worth the purchase.  Personally I prefer the regular Frank's RedHot, especially for the purpose of making hot wings.  My wife, however, doesn't like spicy foods and sauces, but she does like the Frank's RedHot Chile 'n Lime.  I think it tastes like taco sauce, and perhaps it does, but the combination of the ingredients with the lime flavoring makes this product a unique experience for the taste buds.  Given that my wife absolutely loves the RedHot Chile 'n Lime, and the fact that it's made by Frank's, I'm rating the sauce 5 stars.
