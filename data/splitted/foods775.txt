review/summary: Three ingredients - these are amazing!
review/text: I love Lara Bars - all of them.  It's amazing that they have so few ingredients but taste so good.  I even like the chocolate Lara Bars better than a real chocolate bar ... plus you get good nutrition from these bars and don't have to worry about strange ingredients or additives.  My husband and I buy these 4 cases at a time ...

review/summary: Not good anymore
review/text: I was a HUGE fan and recommended it highly.  However, I just tossed a whole box.  Something has changed -- and not in a good way.  I had concerns last year and thought maybe the taste was "off" just on the one box.  So I picked up another box last week.  It's even WORSE!  Since General Mills bought LaraBars (Humm Foods) three years ago, the product just seems to have gone down hill.  It doesn't have the same fresh, alive taste; there is a harsh, metallic flavor that indicates whatever machinery produces the bar now is not being properly cleaned.  Also the bar didn't used to be so oily to the touch.  Oily, weird flavors in nut bars make me think the nuts have gone rancid.<br /><br />Since I am writing, I also want to say it has bugged me for years that AMAZON continues to misrepresent the maker of LaraBars in the title of the product "LaraBar" by "LaraBar".  I suppose this is because people who generally buy raw food product are not usually the same people who support multinational food conglomerates like General Mills.  But it just makes me think that Amazon thinks consumers are ignorant.  I feel insulted every time I see it.

review/summary: Some Amazing! Some Not So Amazing...
review/text: It took me a long time to try these larabars out and I don't know what really prompted me to try one finally but I am so glad I did.  From the flavors that I have tried some just blew me away while some really left me feeling unsatisfied in the flavor department.  I will rate the ones out of 5 stars that I have tried, 1 being terrible and 5 being so delicious.<br /><br />Peanut Butter Cookie- 5 stars for this one, so delicious!!!  It tasted just like peanut butter cookie dough but made with crunchy peanut butter due to the nuts that are not ground up.  Such amazing texture and taste, it actually is better when left in the sun to warm up.  The flavor comes out so much better and texture too.  This has to be my favorite so far out of the ones I have tried.<br /><br />Pecan Pie- 5 stars for this one.  I am not a pie person at all, and pecan pie would never be my first choice but after having this larabar I am hooked on its flavor.  It tastes just like pecan pie, no kidding.  It's so strange how such simple ingredients can taste like the real thing.  It has a very deep flavor, almost a caramel molasses flavor.  There are nice pieces of pecans and almonds but not too many to overwhelm the bar itself.<br /><br />Peanut butter and jelly- 4 stars for this one.  It tastes just like that stuff called goober where there is peanut butter and jelly in the same jar.  I grew up eating that stuff and it's so much fun to be able to get that same flavor with this larabar.  I only gave it 4 stars though because it tends to get really tart due to that unsweetened cherries but still really delicious.<br /><br />Apple Pie- 2 stars for this one.  This was such a forgettable flavor, it was too tart in my opinion to taste like apple pie and they were really heavy on the cinnamon.  Don't get me wrong, I know that they are not suppose to really taste like the title says but it still is my least favorite out of the ones I have tried.<br /><br />Cherry Pie- 3.5 stars for this one.  This actually does taste like cherry pie but does taste like the filling of a cherry pie. I bet if they were to add cashews it would lend more of a buttery crust like taste but maybe not.  While this is a nice change every once in a while it is not one that I would get excited over.  Very tart but I love the ratio of nuts they used.<br /><br />Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough- 0 stars, and yes I can give zero stars if I want.  This bar I took a bite out of and was so turned off by the taste.  Way way too sweet due to the chocolate chips used.  I love the larabars because of the no added sugar but by them adding chocolate chips which contain way too much sugar in my opinion really ruined this bar.  If it were not for the chocolate chips I think that it would have been better.  Unsweetened cocoa powder would have been better.  If you like almost candy bars but want a healthier option then you would like this one.<br /><br />Cashew Cookie- 5 stars for this bar.  This I was worried about trying because I am not really a fan of cashews to begin with but I want to try all of these bars, most of them anyways.  I was so surprised at how scrumptious this bar was.  It was not too sweet at all and the cashews lend such a wonderful almost buttery like flavor.  There is no added salt but I felt as though there was a nice saltiness to this bar.  This is my second most favorite after the peanut butter cookie larabar.  I like this one on days when I do not want any strong flavors and nothing too sweet and this one fits the bill.  I have never had a cashew cookie or heard of them but I can imagine they wouldn't be as good as this bar.<br /><br />I plan to try more so I will update this review soon.

review/text: I don't typically like banana flavored stuff. I'm not that crazy about adding bananas in my shakes. But this banana cookie bar is FREAKIN AWESOME. It is so delicious. I share them with friends all the time and the only friend that didn't like it just had a thing about not liking dates (and the ONLY three ingredients in this bar-o-goodness are: almonds, dates, and unsweetened bananas). THANK YOU LARA FOR YOUR DELICIOUSNESS IN A BAR. Just as tasty as it is nutritious ... and THAT is somewhat difficulat to find in "ready to eat" foods.

review/text: We really like Lara Bars.  We originally purchased our first ones at Whole Foods, mainly because the ingredients list is very pure and simple.<br /><br />When you eat these bars, don't think fruit first, think nuts then fruit.  Then when you hit the chunk or bit of fruit its a nice suprise.  Don't get us wrong, these are great... but there is a marketing difference in "Banana Cookie" vs. "Banana Nut Bread" for instance.<br /><br />Definately worth picking up, especially at Amazon prices/shipping.

Certainly a nutritious enough snack, but the cherries and almonds are pretty subtle and the flavor isn't top-notch.<br />Apple Pie is tasty and available on clearance from Target quite often.<br />Chococonut Chew tastes like chocolatey dates, as evidenced by the coconut as the final ingredient and dates as the first. Almonds overpower your mouth and the taste.<br />Cashew Cookie tastes just like a solidified version of my homemade cashew butter; would not invest in such a thing. Overly salty and bland, and a pretty hideous thing, too.<br />Pecan Pie is alright but certainly not a buy-twice.<br />Same w/ PB Cookie, which tasted more of peanuts than anything resembling a PB cookie.<br />PB & J<br />Coconut Cream Pie is atrocious, tasting like coconut oil and absolutely no cream component.

review/summary: not straightforward about allergen information
review/text: My daughter is extremely sensitive to gluten so many products that promote themselves as gluten free prove to be otherwise when my daughter has a gluten reaction.  For the sake of keeping my daughter healthy I contact companies asking them if they test for gluten and if gluten is processed in the same facility.  If it is then it is almost certainly contaminated.  Most companies give me a detailed and open answer so that I can make the best decision for my daughter.  They don't assume they know if the product is okay for my daughter or not.  They give me the facts and the numbers and let me make my own decision.  Larabar did NOT give me a clear answer.  They gave me a very vague answer assuring me that they went through stringent testing but they did not say what kind of testing.  They also said their products met the FDA requirements for gluten free which is so BOGUS b/c the FDA currently does not have any sort of requirements or enforcements for gluten free labels.  They are proposing implementing one but have not yet done so.  So Larabar is attempting to deceive me.  They also did not answer my question if gluten was also processed in the facilities that process Larabars.  Again, most other companies answer me directly on this and are very helpful.  I was so turned off by Larabar's response that I want nothing to do with them.  It was obvious they could care less about my daughter's health.  Ultimately, they put their profits above children's health.

review/text: I really relied heavily on reviews on this one.  Unfortunately after receiving the bars I was sorely disappointed.  I like the RAWness of these bars but they don't taste like coconut, they don't taste like pecan pie.  They taste like a slightly tart pecan date nut log.  I LOVE pecans and dates but I like my dates sweet.  These aren't.  Too bad for me but hopefully I can help the next guy out. Great deal though for those of you that like these bars.

My expectations were reasonable considering that this is a nutritional product rather than an actual slice of pecan pie, but it was so awful I had to throw it away after 2 bites, followed by a thorough rinse-and-spit session with a glass of cold water.

review/summary: not as good as claimed
review/text: As someone on a low sodium diet I have to make many types of food which most people buy, such as applesauce,bread, ricotta,and granola. I think these bars-and other Larabar flavors- taste 'chemical' to the point that they verge on artificial, despite being haled as all natural.  "Natural" does not equal tasty,and it often means nothing important. Besides tasting better,I wish the sodium levels were more readable - and lower.Sure fat,sugar and protein are all important,but more people die of cardiac disease and hypertension -linked to high sodium in the diet- than from lack of protein.

review/summary: DISGUSTING with a Capital D
review/text: Why put unsweetened ingredients in one of these bars? Unsweetened chocolate? Disgusting. This product lacks flavor and is way too heavy and dense. I also don't know what could be nastier than unsweetened coconut. It needs to be lighter in texture and a lot sweeter (not cloyingly so) and then this might be at least tasty. As it is, it is a waste of money and an absolute disappointment.<br /><br />To the manufacturer: look for inspiration in the flourless chocolate cake sold at Trader Joe specifically for gluten free diets, and check out the flavorful almond horn by Aleia. Both are mildly sweet, but full of flavor.  The chocolate flavor pops in the mouth and makes you forget that it has no gluten in it.  The almond horn delights you with the fragrance before it ever hits your mouth.  Both go great with tea, coffee and fruit, particularly the cake goes well with fresh stawberries.<br /><br />Maybe you just need to stick to a core ingredient and work around it.  There is too much nastiness going on in this disgusting bar.<br /><br />This is a terrible product that cannot be recommended. There are just way too many nasty gluten free products on the market, and this should be placed exactly where I just put it, in the garbage. More $$ down the drain and continued disappointment reigns.<br /><br />I am being brutally honest because I was recently diagnosed with a gluten allergy and have exceedingly fond memories of all of the delicious wheat-based offerings I used to eat and I naturally expect to be able to partake delicious gluten-free substitutes, espcially since they usually cost twice as much as the products containing gluten. This is no substitute for the wheat-based version, to say the least.

review/text: I have been eating Larabar bars for years and love Pecan Pie bars. A few days ago I received a box from a warehouse in Kentucky. The box had oil spots on it and when I opened a bar, there was a strange odor, almost like fermentation. I ate it because I had no lunch with me at work, but now I have 15 more bars that I will not eat. I think the temperature at the warehouse was too hot. I've never had this problem before.

review/text: Everyone in my family shares my opinion that these things taste absolutely HORRIBLE.  I feel really bad for someone who needs to eat Gluten/Dairy/Soy-free or Vegan/Kosher foods.  If I had to live on these alone (and I don't), I'd convert back to being a non-vegan or whatever.  We all tried the Cherry Pie flavor, and what this thing has to do with cherry pies is way beyond me.  It's a lump of semi-solid goop with some nuts and dried fruits that taste sour and bitter and somewhat sticky.  Simply gross to the point I couldn't even finish one bar.  I may not be a health food nut, but I know what tastes like crap when I taste it...and these things are crap all the way. Steer clear.  Even 1/2 hour after, I still have that horrible taste in my mouth and need to go brush my teeth to get rid of it.

review/summary: "Health" Does Not Always Equal Health
review/text: It took me a decade of yo-yo dieting on various plans, four short-term successes, and now, hopefully, a long-term success is on the way. I have lost 35 lbs in 6 months, and going strong. I lost it gradually and within recommended weight loss recommendations (1-2 lbs a week). I didn't starve myself, stop my social life for any diet's decrees, and I definitely wasn't under the tutelage of any one diet. I have done that already and realize a few things: 1) you must exercise daily, 2) you must mind calories, 3) you must eat 3 meals and 2 snacks every day, and 4) the types of nutrients matter (omega 3, 6, and 9 fats, thermogenic herbs, antioxidants, etc.)<br /><br />The greatest myth I busted was any form of perfectionism. If you have a candy bar once in a while, that doesn't mean you are a big failure, you have to start all over, and you might as well do that next week (so you can binge in the meantime).<br /><br />All diets are perfectionistic. They focus on one aspect of healthy eating and run with it to fit the lose-weight-overnight / Can-I-also-have-a-pizza-with-all-the-fixings? mentality of the typical deluded American. That's why we have the Atkins diet, illustrating the worst of this concept. However, these diets aren't bad, because you can extract a jewel of knowledge from each of these regimens. Atkins taught us to watch carbs and not to fear protein (although that doesn't mean you can eat bacon); Fat Flush teaches you the difference between good and bad fats, thermogenic herbs (that raise the metabolism), and a very basic understanding of the Glycemic Index, and Thurmond teaches you what combinations of foods work to lose weight and the power of eating many small meals throughout the day.<br /><br />Larabar is another great example of the focused diet. The jewel is the omega fats 3 and 6, gluten-free, no dietary sweeteners (which increase your appetite and studies have correlated artificial sweeteners to weight gain because of its high glycemic index count), and it being all natural, organic, and kosher. That's great, when you focus on only this aspect. But still, however popular diets have become, Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, and the like can never be ignored. The one irrefutable truth is the calories you take in determine what your weight will be in the immediate future. If there is a high fat percentage, which are calories still, you have to consider that.<br /><br />LARABARS HAVE 45 - 55 % FAT! 200 + CALORIES! These health bars are healthy, but I would only have them as a reward before or after a good workout. This is the first review that I am rating this low because of the padding I suspect going on. One reviewer talks about the low calories, which is totally false. Two reviewers talk about how healthy it is, sounding very close to an infomercial as he focuses on only one aspect but ignores another. The suspicion arises when these two reviewers rate this bar 5 STARS 3-4 FREAKIN' TIMES WITH THE SAME WORDS! They must mention the excessive calories and fat in these bars, or else someone's going to go off of insufficient information and eat one every day with a sedentary lifestyle. Compare this bar to a Snickers, and you may have a different perspective. What is labeled "healthy" can be very bias.<br /><br />MY POINT BEYOND LARABARS: You can't focus on one system of ideas, because health and nutrition and weight loss are much larger and much more demanding concepts of nature's effect on the body. It's how you sustain and develop habits and balance in life, and it's about the knowledge you keep in your head, so you can deftly cut corners through increasing your metabolism or burning the maximum calories. It's about myth busting. It's about making smart choices. It's about knowing what choices are in the first place; if you choose one path, you can't choose another. Sacrifices may be what your particular body requires to be healthy and lose weight. You won't find a real chili-dog diet. You won't find a sugar that tastes exactly like sugar. One path leads to one place, while the other path leads to another. Note the difference, and be realistic.<br /><br />Lastly, the only health change you can make overnight happens in your head, not in your body.

review/text: recently diagnosed with celiac, I've had to restructure my whole vision of food and snacks and how to stay healthy.  I've never had luck with nutrition/meal replacement bars in the past (can we say cardboard?), so I was leery when those on the celiac support boards kept singing the praises of Larabars.<br /><br />I picked up my first one at Whole Foods, and was worried with the high nut content -- I'm not known to be fond of nuts.  but after one bite, I discovered I LOVE nuts -- if they are in a Larabar.  the cherry bars are sweet and sure at the same time, just like fresh cherries.  the dates and nuts balance out the flavor experience.<br /><br />unlike other bars, these are soft and tasty, and beyond filling!  I can usually only nibble half at a time.  but now, I have something to keep in my purse or in my desk at work for emergency food.  everyone else can have a sandwich with their wheat filled bread, and I'm perfectly happy to munch away on my Larabar.

WOW!!

I even got my picky boyfriend to eat one when we were hiking, and now he steals mine!<br /><br />If you are a big chocolate lover, I would just warn you that these don't taste like a chocolate bar - the combination of cocoa and chili powder is really more like a Mole sauce you get in Mexican cooking - rich, but not at all sweet. And the chili powder is not enough to be hot or spicy.<br /><br />I would heartily recommend these to anyone looking at any kind of snack or nutrition bar.

The problem THERE is that I am somewhat allergic to Cashews and the Think Org. bars are loaded with them!  Larabars  use Almonds, which is no problem for allergies, just for chemical sprays.<br /><br />Darn it, guys, why doesn't someone come up with a relatively hypoallergenic product that is also ORGANIC????  When you do, your bars will be my most favored product of the century!!! Otherwise, the Cherry Pie Larabars are unbelievably yummy and raw food, which is always good.

review/text: I cannot say enough about Larabars. Simple ingredients, whole ingredients, and a great snack. However, the one caveat is that the ingredients are not organic and that is why I am providing a 4 star rating. Some foods like Dates with very thin skins I would prefer to have an organic option. I wish that they would offer an organic version of this bar. However, they do taste amazing and are probably one of the best options out there if not the best. These are perfect for me at University for between classes when I am on the go and do not have enough time to go to the cafeteria quite yet.<br /><br />I would recommend trying the flavors before you buy a whole package, however if your willing to take a plunge, the top flavors I have tried so far have been Chocolate Coconut Chew, Coconut Cream Pie, Cinnamon Roll, and Cashew Cookie in that order. Some flavors such as Apple Pie, Cherry Pie, Key Lime Pie, I find can get old a lot faster and I would probably not go through a 16 box of them before I got somewhat sick of them.<br /><br />PROS<br />+Very tasty (LOVE the Chocolate Coconut Chew and the Cinnamon Roll).<br />+Simple ingredients.<br />+Whole food ingredients.<br />+Small, portable.<br />+Price is very reasonable.<br />+Filling.<br /><br />CONS<br />+No organic option.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br />The price at Amazon is superb compared to elsewhere, you probably won't find anything in this price range at this quality, from what I have experienced. They are a good snack when you are on the go, perfect for a University student at that. Simple, whole food ingredients, the way it is meant to be. Definitely recommended. Will get a 5 star rating once they release an organic version!

review/summary: know the facts
review/text: These bars are not marketed as a diet aid.  They are organic raw food bars. Made mostly of fruit and nuts, Larabar products do not hide the fact that natural ingredients have calories and fat.  But can they be part of a healthy diet? Definitely. Taste is subjective - I myself happen to enjoy the flavor, but none of Larabar's products are going to taste like a Milky Way. When you're tempted to go for the really bad stuff, it's nice to have these around, but it helps if you like the taste of the natural ingredients.

review/summary: pecan pie?
review/text: I will keep this "review" simple. Yes, this is a quality product but...<br />Basically this is a date bar flavored with a few nuts. If you like dates and nuts, you will like the pecan pie Larabar. If you think you are going to pretend you are enjoying pecan pie while eating healthy...I hope you have a good imagination. It tastes EXACTLY like dates and nuts because it IS dates and nuts. It's great if you like DATES and NUTS.<br />Don't be romanced by Illusions...and if you find that you are, remember..I TOLD YOU SO! Dates and nuts, dates and nuts, dates and nuts.

review/summary: These are the best
review/text: I heard about these bars from the author of The Lupus Recovery Diet.  She<br /><br />sent me a bar with my recent CD purchase and I loved it.  I have since purchased bars at Whole Foods and was so pleased to see them offered here.<br /><br />The Pecan Pie tastes so wonderful.  Just like a piece of pecan pie.  My<br /><br />favorites are the cinnamon roll and chocolate coconut.<br /><br />I read the other review regarding calories and fat, but these bars are healthy and so filling.  I have one for breakfast on the run, or as a mid<br /><br />afternoon snack.  With a plant based diet, I am not concerned about the calories and find the bars so satisfying. These are the best tasting bars I have ever tried.  It sounds like a commercial, but I honestly am in love with this product.  I have ordered 4 cases for our household.  My kids love them too and they are way better than the cookies and other sweet processed snacks offered for lunches.

Some flavors aren't my favorite, so don't be judgin' if you've only tried one flavor.  Like apple.  Not that good.  I tend to like the nutty ones (I think that applies to women, too).  Pecan Pie, Peanut Butter Cookie, Pistacio.  Pistaci, yo!  And the Chocolate Coconut is good too- but don't expect it to taste like a chocolate bar from 7eleven because these bars is sweetened only by dates- they gots no added shoogs!  RE-SPEC!!

review/summary: Good, but Flavor Names Not Always Appropriate
review/text: I've grown to really like these bars, but the flavor names are a bit misleading.  I've had the apple pie, which is appropriately named, the jocalat(chocolate) I think will be disappointing to most in the beginning if you're really expecting true chocolate taste, but the actual flavor does grow on you, and the pecan pie is really delicious but it doesn't taste anything like pecan pie.  It's more like a very tasty, nutty, gooey date bar.  So if you don't get your hopes up with the flavors, I think you'll like them very much, AND they are truly wholesome and are perfect for the Paleo Diet.

review/summary: Amazing New Flavor
review/text: Peanut Butter and Jelly Larabars is a new flavor (to me, anyway, because I just discovered them in the stores here).  They are really awesome.<br /><br />I admit, I've never been a fan of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with light bread, but I LOVED peanut butter and jelly on graham crackers.  Now that I've gone vegan, I can't eat peanut butter and jelly or graham crackers, but this PB&J Larabar tastes just like the peanut butter and jelly on graham crackers that I used to eat.  And even for non-vegans, these bars are still good - anybody can eat them.  They taste just like whatever the flavor is, and are healthy (even though you'd never know it, because they taste so good!)<br /><br />These bars are healthy, natural, soy-free, vegan, kosher.  They have no added sugar, and no chemicals.  It is amazing how something so natural and simple can be so good.<br /><br />Larabars are good to pack for trips, lunches, or anytime you need some energy (or just food); they are convenient because you don't have to cook, measure, slice, or stir, and you don't need a container with a special lid.  You don't need anything!  You just open and eat!!!  All the flavors are good for energy or hunger-control, but when I am really hungry, my favorite flavors are peanut butter cookie and peanut butter and jelly (the featured flavor in this particular review).  The ones with peanut butter (not really peanut butter, but just peanuts) seem to give me more energy.<br /><br />I love all flavors of Larabars (I haven't yet discovered a flavor that I didn't like), but I do have my favorites, depending on the mood I'm in.  Like I mentioned in the prior paragraph, Peanut butter cookie and peanut butter and jelly are my favorites if I am really hungry.<br /><br />All the flavors of Larabars are healthy, and even though they have no added sugar, they certainly crave my desire for sweets (because they do taste like they have sugar, even though they don't).  I am not really a big "sweets" eater; I prefer salts.  If I could just have salty foods all the time, I think I could totally give up sweets.  But even those who do love sweets, I think these bars would satisfy their sweets desire, also, because they taste like whatever the flavor is.

review/summary: Jackpot
review/text: The Peanut Butter and Jelly LARABAR is really, really good. The company struck gold with this one. If you are a fan of those sandwiches, you'll dig these as an on-the-go-snack. I just have a few minor gripes: one is that I like to "stretch" Larabars  (while still in the wrapper), because they're usually a little fat and brick-like and it makes them last longer/more fun to pick at, but when you smoosh this particular flavor out, it gets a quite crumbly (think pieces of peanut popping out); so, it's not as blended as other flavors. Also, it'd be nice if it were a bit saltier -- sometimes you just crave that, especially if it's a meal replacement and you're in a peanut-butter-and-jelly mood -- and a little protein-heavier. Finally, I really wish the entire Larabar line (not just Jocalat) was organic! That would really be awesome. But, these are nitpick-y things. You'll like this flavor -- a lot. In full disclosure, I haven't ordered them on Amazon, but I believe after eating my first one, I told whoever was in the room with me to please buy me a box of them because it was "SO. GOOD." So, go for it.

review/summary: Get them by the case!
review/text: These things are amazing. Healthy, instant, tasty, and pretty inexpensive at ~$1.50 per bar. They are free of dairy, gluten, meat, soy, etc and are raw, so almosy anyone can eat them.<br /><br />Now onto the flavor analysis. The first flavor I tried was Key Lime Pie. It was really, really good. Next I tried Cherry Pie. It wasn't as good, but with its strong flavor I found it to be the perfect companion to a few pieces of dark chocolate. When I had women over (I'm a young single bachelor) I'd share with them some dark chocolate and a cherry pie larabar and they would almost get as much enjoyment from that as they did from me. I just opened my new box of Lemon and it is easily my favorite flavor so far. Incredible, I don't want to risk trying another flavor because lemon is so good. My roommate preferred the lime but says the lemon is his second best.<br /><br />So to recap: these are good, buy them.

review/summary: Very tasty, chewy and satisfying, although a bit too high in fat for me
review/text: I got these when Amazon was running a very good promotion, so it worked out to something like .60 a bar.  These have a really nice, tangy taste (the cherries) and a really satisfying chewy texture. I like that it's pretty natural and simple ingredients (grounds nuts, cherry, dates etc.), but for my preference, it's a bit too high in fat.  I like my energy bars to have no more than 3 grams of fat (or 4 max), while these have 8 (but then again, those lower fat bars don't taste as good as these).  ;-)<br /><br />I would try another flavor of these if there was another good sale and if I could get any that were lower in fat.

review/summary: Essential, HONEST Nourishment in a Delicious Flavor Assortment
review/text: Ginger Snap is my favorite of the Larabars. For me it seems to provide the epitome of potency these bars have available.<br /><br />The combination of Ginger and Cloves with the nuts and dates, seems to give a cleansing, balancing, renewing, and empowering type of immediate, essential nourishment. I'm amazed at how fast this flavor will give me a solid physical strengthening when I'm lagging from having pushed too close to draining past ready reserves. After just a few luxuriously flavorful bites, I can feel an amazingly positive effect.<br /><br />What I noticed with tremendous relief, and a significant amount of awe upon first reading the wrapper on these bars was the basic, clear ingredients listing along one side, with the "NO SOY, NO GMO" noted on the other side. I had begun to believe that I'd never see a label which would give me that type of refreshing feeling of finally being able to eat something without fear of how much it would contribute to an already painful situation of serious health issues. To find that it would contribute instead to healing and strengthening had literally rekindled a lost concept.<br /><br />With the huge variety of simple, sane, satisfying flavor blends available in this line of tasty and true nutritional offerings, I enjoy asking myself what I most have a taste for at any moment when I need a solid [not pseudo with a skull-and-cross-bones price tag] energy lift. [I always carry at least 4 flavors in my purse.]<br /><br />I don't know what else to say except that I feel blessed, and that I tremendously appreciate what Lara has had the inner wisdom, creative versatility, and visceral fortitude to accomplish.<br /><br />Well done, Lady!<br /><br />Live long and prosper,<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt

review/summary: COLLEGE STUDENT'S BEST FRIEND
review/text: These kept me healthy through college - a GREAT studying snack, because the fruit and nuts both keep you energized and facilitate brain function (at least that's what my nutritionist friend told me). End result was I graduated engineering in 3.5 years with a great GPA! And I did not gain weight like most of my dorm buddies, even though I had very little time for exercise. Seriously - send your kid a pack of these instead of cookies or candy, they will thank you!<br /><br />My favorite bar was lemon - although I think that's a personal preference. Haven't tried all of them, but I mean too. My new husband and my father both need a health makeover (one needs to watch glycemic impact, the other needs to watch fat & sodium), but both love junk food, and so I'm going to try and get them into these too!

review/summary: Cherry Pie Larabars -- love them!  (and also other flavors)
review/text: I have been on a long quest for "nutrition bars" (or whatever you want to call them) that don't have refined sugar, aren't too sweet (however they're sweetened), don't have soy, and generally don't have extra crud in them. These are perfect!<br /><br />I like the flavor, and I like that the ingredients list is so short: "dates, almonds, and cherries". (200 calories, 5g protein, 5g fiber. See larabar dot com for more.)<br /><br />They are a little bit gooier/processed than I was expecting... I had to check after a taste that there wasn't soy in there gluing everything together. But when I think about fruit leather that makes sense. In some ways, it's like a thick fruit leather with some larger bits of fruit and nuts.<br /><br />But I'm really glad to find them and will be trying more flavors. This is just the sort of bar I was hoping for.<br /><br />Update: My next favorite flavor so far is Chocolate Coconut Chew, which should not be mistaken for a candy bar-type snack, as I feared it might. It's not that sweet and not that chocolately. It's more substantial. Ingredients: "Dates, almonds, walnuts, unsweetened cocoa powder, unsweetened coconut". 240 calories, 5g protein, 5g fiber... and I'm sorry I don't have the energy right now to type the rest. (Ah! But you can get it online if you put a dot com after larabar!)<br /><br />I also like Ginger Snap enough to have bought a box. They are, yes, a little cookie-ish (though with the same gooey consistency as the rest). I do love ginger, but I don't find myself reaching for this flavor and probably won't reorder. Ingredients: "Dates, almonds, pecans, ginger, cinnamon, cloves". 240 calories, 5g protein, 6g fiber.<br /><br />Other flavors I have tried (Note that I prefer less sweet things, although all of them have a dose of sweet)<br />  * Tropical Fruit Tart: I won't get this again; for me this was like a pina colada and not what I want in a food bar (partly, this means it was too sweet for me, but also all the desert-y flavors in that bar)<br />  * Peanut Butter and Jelly: Good, and I imagine I'll add it to my bulk rotation<br />  * Cashew Cookie: Good, and I imagine I'll add it to my bulk rotation<br />  * Lemon Bar: Too desert-y for me. Sweet and lemony.<br /><br />(Looking at the larabar web site, Peanut Butter Cookie has the most protein, with 7g, at 220 calories and with 4g fiber... I haven't been able to get that in my local stores yet, but that will be the next flavor I try.)<br /><br />Update 2: So I have bought a few flavors by the box now... but I'm realizing I wonder why these aren't cheaper here. They are 1.39 individually in my grocery store, and 1.27 a piece by the box at the current subscribe and save price of 20.28. So yes, that's a savings, but possibly not enough to buy in bulk.

review/summary: Great GingerSnap Flavor-- real fruit and nuts with NO JUNK
review/text: These might be the best-tasting bars I've ever tried. They keep pretty well, too, although if you leave them in your car (in the heat) they will lose freshness will get hard quickly. They are great as a meal replacement when you don't have time for lunch and you need to grab something satisfying that won't spike your blood sugar and make you feel sick later on. This is a sustained energy-- I think it's the nuts that help it have a lasting energy feeling. The calories in these is always about 300, which is good for a meal replacement.<br /><br />I really love the ginger snap, which tastes just like a real gingersnap cookie and you can taste the real ginger. Although most Larabars are very delicious, and I can't say I have ever disliked any of them.

The health food store sells them for a dollar fifty-nine. That can mean a lot of savings.

review/summary: The "tastier" fruit and nut bar
review/text: Obviously a lot of people like this bar, myself included, so I thought I'd review it a bit differently.  When I was searching for a healthier between meal afternoon snack I read a lot of reviews for a lot of products.  I wanted something with few ingredients, not "fortified" and with some nuts in it.  I settled on these Larabar Fruit & Nut Cherry Pie bars and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P504ZG">Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry Living Food Bar</a>.  I love cherries and I love blueberries so they seemed like good choices.<br /><br />The stats of the bars are very similar, weight (both 1.7oz, not 1.8), calories, fat, sugars, etc.  The PURE has more protein at 6g vs 4g.  The Larabar has no sodium while the PURE has just a bit at 5mg.  The Larabar is thicker, the PURE bar is wider.  Visually the Larabar appears to have more nuts in it, which doesn't seem to jive with the protein stats.  The PURE bar has a grittier texture while chewing so maybe more of the nuts are finely ground.<br /><br />1st ingredient is dates for both followed by almonds and then cherries for the Larabar and followed by blueberries and various nuts, organic agave nectar, rice protein and lemon juice for the PURE bar.  One would think with the extra ingredients in the PURE bar they were added to tweak the flavor or give it a fresher taste, but the flavor of the Larabar is better than the PURE by a pretty good margin.  It has a much fresher and lively taste.  I have to say the PURE bar is a bit cardboardy tasting to me and has a drier mouth feel.  It is not bad, in fact my 2 youngest kids eat them readily, just not nearly as good as the Larabar.  I think the tartness of the cherries in the Larabar kick up the flavor vs the milder blueberry flavor of the PURE (maybe the lemon juice add as an attempt to kick up the PURE bar flavor and tartness?).  In fairness I should probably review the PURE Cherry Cashew bar but I much prefer almonds over cashews so don't plan on ordering any from Amazon.  If I stumble on the PURE cherry in a regular store I will give one a try thugh.  I still get both auto shipped from Amazon for variety sake, but am looking for a better tasting blueberry bar w/ basic ingredients including nuts.<br /><br />For grins here is a comparison of the Larabar, PURE, Snickers, Hershey's and Maruchan Chicken Ramen noodles in a few categories.

review/summary: Cashew Cookie is My Favorite Larabar!!!!!
review/text: Cashew Cookie is my very favorite variety of all the Larabars!!!<br /><br />The reason I love it so much, is because it reminds me of shortbread.  I always loved shortbread, but do not eat it anymore due to the butter and eggs.  I need to find a good vegan recipe for shortbread, if there are any, but this cashew cookie bar is perfect.<br /><br />With my shortbread cookies, I prefer tea.  Therefore, with my Larabar Cashew Cookies, I prefer tea.<br /><br />I love both coffee and tea, but with shortbread, I feel tea is what goes best.  There are certain things that just go together.  Such as cornbread and iced tea; flatbread pizza and bubbly fruit juice; cold weather and coffee; hot weather and watermelon; friends and cozy lunch diners; shortbread and tea.  And in this case, it is Larabar Cashew Cookie and Tea.<br /><br />These bars come in different awesome and amazing flavors.<br /><br />These bars are healthy.  They are vegan-friendly.  There are no bad ingredients, such as sugar, chemicals, or preservatives.  There isn't even flour.  There are only healthy ingredients in these bars: fruits and nuts.  The fruit sweetens them.  They fool you into thinking you're eating something bad, because they taste so good.

review/text: All the Larabars I have tried have been wonderful but the Coconut Cream Pie ones are absolutely decadent!!! They taste as yummy as your grannie's Coconut Cream pie did with none of the guilt. The taste is sweet but not overwhelmingly so. The coconut flavor is prominent and will delight your tastebuds. I highly recommend the Larabar Coconut Cream Pie bars for a bit of sweetness that is actually good for you.

review/summary: Natural & Minimal Processing
review/text: I keep these in my backpack, on my bike, and in the glove compartment. These are a great pick me up that is terrific to have handy when a meeting or function goes long, or to keep me out of the drive thru on the way home from the beach or a road trip. They are high in carbs, but I don't eat them all the time. They are simple, with few ingredients, and are minimally processed. I feel good after eating them, and it doesn't feel like I just swallowed a brick, or that I have to wash it down with two gallons of water. On long bike rides or races they are perfect for balancing nutritional intake. Triathletes take note!

review/text: I've only had the Apple Pie version, but they are really tasty. It's moist and flavorful and contains only dates, almonds, UNSWEETENED apples, raisins, walnuts and cinnamon. This is an ingredients list I can be excited about. It's a quick, nutritious meal on the go and very nutrient dense, with good fats and almost no sodium at all.<br /><br />I will be ordering these in more flavors. Highly recommended.

review/text: No added anything.<br /><br />I eat one of these every morning on my way out the door.  Great complement to some granola and yogurt when fresh fruit is out of the question.  Keeps you satisfied.<br /><br />I love em.  Simple raw ingredients produce a fantastic diversity of nutrition.<br /><br />You won't find natural nutritional balance like this in anything else.<br /><br />To the negative reviewers here: these are not candy bars.  There is no added sugar so they are somewhat tart.  They provide nearly a full meal's worth of balanced nutrition.  Yes, that means fruit/vegetable proteins, fats, and sugars.

review/summary: Strong cherry taste, more tart than sweet
review/text: These bars have a strong cherry taste, but because they have no sugar, they don't really taste like cherry pie. The bars have only three ingredients: dates, almonds, and unsweetened cherries. The almonds are chopped pretty finely, but still give the bar a bit of crunchiness. I love the taste, but if you're looking for something sweet, you might be disappointed. Each bar has 190 calories and 80 of them are from fat.

review/summary: Larabar for President
review/text: Okay, not literally for president, but I must say that Larabar is by FAR the best snack I have ever come across that is satisfying and a healthy alternative to the highly processed crap that is out there.  No high fructose corn syrup, or weird chemical additives derived from petrol products, and definately nothing synthetic!  Nature at it's finest!  If you have kids, they will adore these and won't even know THEY ARE HEALTHY FOR THEM!  I have yet to meet a flavor that I don't like!  Anyone who gives these a bad review either haven't tried them or they wanted them to be a Snickers bar. (I still feel these kick the pants off ALL candybars-but that's just my humble opinion.)

review/text: Only recently have I discovered the satisying, interesting spectrum of<br />flavors being offered by this product.  The lemon is my current favorite, but I have tried several of the others and find them equally satisfying.<br />These food bars are low in calories, high in nutrition, handy snack size and perfect for any folks with certain dietary limitations. Unfortunately,I have many food allergies found in MOST of the commercial snacks on the market, so these are very welcome to me.<br />Check the ingredient panel and be pleasantly surprised!

review/text: Pecan Pie is one of my favorite larabar flavors, so when I saw it at a reduced price, I had to buy the whole box. They are a huge hit with my mom (the health nut) and my sister, who like me, is a college student. I love the ingredients list on every larabar ... only fruits, nuts, and sometimes a few spices, and more importantly, no corn syrups, sugar, synthetic fats, etc. I highly recommend this product for anyone who needs a nutritious snack, a balanced meal replacement, or brain food during a study break.

review/summary: Wholesome Goodness, Conveniently Packaged Into One Bar
review/text: After just one bite, I was completely sold on this bar - it is PACKED with pieces of pistachios and cashews, has a sweet (but definitely not overly sweet) flavor from the dates, and has a nice, chewy texture. Overall, a very pleasing experience for my taste buds - all while nourishing my body, as well!<br /><br />Do not let some of the nutritional information (i.e. the fat and sugar contents) scare you - pistachios are an excellent source of protein, Vitamin E, potassium, magnesium, iron, phosphorous, and zinc; the cashews contribute iron and zinc as well, plus heart-healthy oils and Vitamin B6. In addition, the dates are a good source of Vitamins A, C, and B-Complex, plus iron and and magnesium as well. Even though the bar is only 51 grams, it is VERY satisfying and filling.<br /><br />Everything in this bar occurs naturally - no chemicals, artificial ingredients, or trans-fats here! In fact, the bar contains just three ingredients: dates, pistachios, and cashews - no dictionary needed to figure out its contents, that's for sure.<br /><br />When I received my package of the Pistachio Larabars from Amazon, the box was in great condition, and none of the bars (at least, the ones I have eaten so far; and I eat one almost everyday) have been rancid. Overall, this product (and other Larabar flavors, as well) is HIGHLY recommended, on my part.

It is all natural with no preservatives. you cannot make a better tasting, better for you bar. I eat these on my long runs on the weekends and they seem to sustain my energy very well. The flavors i have liked the best, of the ones i have tired, are cashew cookie, cinnamon roll, apple pie, and gingersnap.

review/text: I am an avid hiker and a dancer. These bars are wonderful for people like me who are active and can't always squeeze in regular meals. I have tried to get as much raw food in my diet as possible and these really help.<br /> As for the calories, I see a lot of people commenting on this. As a dancer I am required to keep my weight down and so I know a thing or two about calories but these are not that high in calories if eaten as a meal replacement or a high energy snack in the afternoon. Remember these are made with a lot of nuts which are full of good fat, protein, and low on the glycemic index. Cherry and Lemon are my favorite flavors. Yum!

I like almost all the other Larabar flavors- except the banana which is kind of bland.  Can hardly wait to try the Key Lime Pie and the Pistachio flavors.  I wish these bars were sold in regular grocery stores, it's a long drive to Wild Oats from where I live...
