review/summary: A bit more protein a bit less wheat
review/text: First, I do have to say our dog Mitzi (a black Chow) enjoys the biscuits and the size is no problem for her, even though she is only 40lbs (small for a Chow). I can't tell if it actually removes tartar, but I am giving it an extra star for that if it does. I am deducting a star because the main ingredient is wheat and a dog should have more protein and fewer carbs in its diet.

review/summary: Mixed opionions from my two dogs.
review/text: I have 2 medium sized dogs, a siberian husky who is a bit of a picky eater and my puli who is a trash can. They both are typically fed Wellness brand products, so I wasn't sure how they would like  the Crunch 'n Clean biscuits.<br />My puli, being the little trash can he is, stared at and played with a biscuit for a while before digging in, which is not his usual form. However, after a few minutes he snarfed it right up and he has continued to do so for the past several days.<br />My husky on the other hand initially left her biscuit and stared at it. Then she licked it and stared at me, leaving it on the ground and walking away.  I tried again the next day with similar results. On day three she begrudgingly took it and ate it, but she left bits of it all over the floor, which is not her MO for our normal brand.<br />I think, therefore, it is likely that how well your dog will or won't like these treats is dependent on how finicky your dog is.<br /><br />They do appear to assist with removal of food particles. I could not ascertain whether they assisted with tartar build-up removal as neither of my dogs really have this problem. However, if the loose food is removed, I suppose you could argue that it would reduce the potential for tartar build-up in the future. It did not make their breath smell remarkably different.<br /><br />The caloric content is high considering the ingredient list (50 cal/biscuit). This could be a problem for anyone with pets that have weight issues as the recommended serving is 2 biscuits twice a day for 200 calories total. The ingredient list also sports a number of grain products, wheat, barley flower,  and corn starch, which could be a problem if your pet has allergies. It also contains partially hydrogenated oils and sugars, neither of which are particularly good for either pets or people. So those people who worry about what their dogs eating, or those with pets with allergies will probably not find this product to their liking. I am most concerned with the calorie content and wonder if the reason I did not notice noticeably fresher breath was because I fed my dogs half the recommended serving (so 1 biscuit twice daily) as I have one pet whose weight I have to watch.<br /><br />All in all I think this is a split decision. I think many dogs will like the biscuits, like my puli and be just fine with them. They are a good size for the medium breeds and they probably will prevent future tartar build-up. For finicky eaters and/or owners, or those pets who have grain allergies, a different choice may make more sense.

review/summary: Dogs like them...
review/text: I've been giving these out to customers at our grooming shop for the last several days, and the response has been very positive.  Most dogs are anxious when they're at the shop, so very few will eat a treat.  However, I've had several dogs eagerly enjoy these while waiting to go home.  If a dog will eat these while waiting for their owner, they must be pretty darn good.

review/summary: the dogs love these - but they love all treats
review/text: If you are looking for non-wheat based treats - these are not them - the first ingredient is flour. The second is wheat meal.<br /><br />Some people are very wary of this sort of thing for their pups, so I wanted to get that out of the way. Do they clean your dog's teeth? I can't say as we brush their teeth nightly - but they are quite hard biscuits - so they have the potential - as do most other very hard treats - to help clean teeth.<br /><br />Size - small - well, really, they are on par with other medium biscuits - so if you have a toy breed - as in less than 10 lbs - they will likely have trouble with these as they are larger than most 'small' biscuits.<br /><br />The dogs love them - of course, the dogs love all treats - but they don't spit them out in disgust ;)<br /><br />Overall, they are fine - the pups have gone through most of the box so far (we have 3 and they get treats a couple times a day). No problems at all.<br /><br />If you have a 15-50lb dog - and are looking for a hard treat that might help with keeping their teeth clean, this is a good option.

review/summary: Can people use these? they work on dogs bad breath
review/text: I have a 12 year old sheltie with older teeth, despite yearly tooth cleanings, his breath is not as good as it should be. He can no longer chew his tooth vet approved tooth cheweys, so I thought I would try these.<br />I am not sure why so many reviers are hung up on "taste", as a 20 year dog trainer I suspect they have very spoiled dogs that are over weight and need to be a bit hungry.<br />The goal of these cookies  is breath work!!! not taste!!!<br />They are cruncy! suggest you do not feed on carpet!  and after two days his breath was better when we played toys. I think they have made an improvement in his breath, and suggest you try a box.<br />two days later,, we skipped a day,,, and I could tell he needed one.<br /> ****I have fed them for two weeks and the teeth  have improved.<br />  If your dog has bad breath, try one of these a day. doglady forest grove

review/summary: I'll buy again: dog loves 'em, good size for large dogs, ingredients so-so, somewhat pricey
review/text: The good:<br /><br />The 1st test of any dog treat is how much my dog likes them (after all, they are treats for him!). He loves these biscuits; in fact, I usually give him a dog supplement with each treat and he refuses to eat his supplement until AFTER each biscuit crumb is gone.<br /><br />I also like the size of the large biscuits: my lab needs to actually chew these; can't gulp them in one bite.<br /><br />The so-so:<br /><br />The ingredients are pretty standard; I home feed my dog, so I do pay attention to ingredients. Still treats are treats, and as such, the ingredients in these once/per day treats are acceptable to me.<br /><br />The amazon.com price for the large biscuits is $3 per pound --- way cheaper than some of the other things marketed as teeth-cleansing, but still, $3 per pound - even with free shipping - is a little high. I checked and these are not offered as subscription items, which would knock off 15% of the price.<br /><br />Overall summary: I give this product 4 stars, marking down just slightly for price & ingredients.  That said, I'm placing my 2nd order now ...

review/summary: Good Clean Treat for your Dog
review/text: I got worried about this brand of dog biscuit when my golden retriever (18 months old) licked it a few times and then sat there. She then ate it all up in a little less than a minute. She didn't attempt to jump for it (she often does for cheese or other treats) but my dog Georgia seemed to be happy with the treat. I don't think this brand of biscuit will appeal to all dogs (picky eaters may not enjoy it though that doesn't seem to be a problem with most dogs) but it is a great alternative for dog owners who want only the healthiest products for their pets.

review/summary: Good price, High Sodium...
review/text: Comparing these to a local mass market retailer per each, this is a really good price + free shipping.  Currently less than $0.50/each can't get them cheaper elsewhere.  These spicy noodles are great, gives more of a kick compared to the regular chicken flavor.  Personally I think they are just spicy enough without needing to constantly "cool off" your mouth after each bite.<br />These are INSANELY full of sodium; however most Maruchan noodle soups are high in sodium.  Some are upwards of 50% of your allowable daily value so this isn't surprising.<br /><br />The nutritional values from the package are:<br /><br />Calories -- 290<br />Calories from Fat -- 108<br />% Daily Value*<br />Total Fat -- 12.0g<br />Saturated Fat -- 6.0g<br />Trans Fat -- 0.0g<br />Cholesterol -- 3mg<br />Sodium -- 1190mg<br />Total Carbohydrates -- 38.0g<br />Dietary Fiber -- 2.0g<br />Sugars -- 1.0g<br /><br />Easy ways to reduce the sodium is to shake off some of the seasoning prior to adding the water or don't drink all of the broth.  Overall, this is a convenient lunch, easily made with hot water and really delicious.

review/text: I was very pleased with the cheese selection I received. It was packed in a styrofoam cooler with ice packs and arrived quickly after being shipped. They won't deliver in summer, but it's worth waiting for cooler weather. There was a lot more cheese than I expected because each one weighed well over a pound. It seems to be a reasonable price, even with shipping, for everything that I received. The pepper jack was nice and hot, the mild cheddar was smooth and mild. Very good tasting and definately not your grocery store cheese. I would definately buy this again.

review/text: I'm a hot sauce aficionado (my kids typically buy me at least one bottle for Christmas & Father's Day).  A friend recommended the Everidae sauces, so I took a shot and tried Everidae medium and am so glad I did. The flavor enhances rather than competes with the food it's paired with. The mix of sweet & spice is most excellent. I tried it on pizza, cooked inside a burger, on scrambled eggs. Putting it on eggs was akin to reaching breakfast enlightenment - without it scrambled eggs now seem sadly lacking, so it looks like I'm a committed Everidae convert.

review/text: Medium Everidae sauce is my personal favorite of the three heat intensities offered by Scoville Farms Everidae Sauce. It adds just enough kick and equally enhances the flavor of whatever you are topping. It is a delish condiment! A common saying at our family table is: "Our family eats spicy. Take a drink of water." The kids will go for a medium variety without any difficulty. They love it as a burger and brat topper, a twist on sweet and sour chicken, and as a pizza sauce substitute.

It contains no grain or gluten like some distilled vinegars, and no added sulfates or sulfites like a lot of wine vinegars.<br /><br />Be careful with this listing though.

I assumed I would receive a case quantity.<br /><br />What I received was one very expensive 32-ounce bottle of Heinz cider vinegar. Amazon customer service (always excellent!) quickly made it right, though.<br /><br />Enjoy the vinegar. Just make sure the listing is clear about what you will receive.

Stopped the meds and took this for 6 months with no healthy modifications to my diet. I eat chicken skin prime rib fat, you name it if it's greasy I eat it. Even so I never went over 184 when taking the Beta Sisterol, which is good, even my doctor said he liked the score. A year later still steady at 184. It seems great for cholesterol and good for the prostate too. Very very pleased!

No, it's not for ED ... do your research, and talk to your doctor about options for treating certain reoccurring issues you may have as you get older. Has prevented further occurrences of the issue. It's not a cholesterol medication; it's for men's issues. Without going into detail, it's related to that walnut-shaped thing we have inside our bodies that has to be checked after we turn (cough!) 40.

review/summary: What sort of product description is this?
review/text: I have not tried this product, and probably wont because when I tried to read the product description, I read the following:<br /><br />"Over 90% of All Men Will Develop an Enlarged Prostate or Some Type of Prostate Problem During Their Lifetime Most prostate problems such as prostate infection, BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) and Prostatitis are caused by an enlarged prostate. As you age, the likelihood of facing the problem of a swollen or enlarged prostate gland increases yearly. In fact, the chance of this happening to you is more than 90%. An Enlarging Prostate May be an Early Warning Sign of More Serious Prostate Problems"<br /><br />Based on this, I already know what the prostate is and what it all means, but now I'd like to know what the product being sold actually does. The description wont enlighten me any more than what I knew before I read this.

review/summary: No Nutrition - And Controversial Brewer's Yeast
review/text: I bought a pound of this Meow Mix Tender Centers for my cat at the local pet superstore near my house. And although she seems to like it, I have to give it a low rating. Here is why:<br /><br />This Meow Mix Tuna and Whitefish Cat Food is like junk food for my cat as it tastes good but has little nutritional value. It has inferior ingredients in the top 5 of the ingredients list (listed below), as well as the addition of artificial colors and controversial brewer's yeast, so no matter how much my cat might like this cat food, I really had to give it a low rating.<br /><br />To start with, the first two ingredients on the list are ground corn and corn meal. These supply no essential vitamins or nutrients to my cat's diet. Chicken by-product comes next, which is a less than ideal form of protein as it is made up of the bits of the chicken that are unfit for human consumption. Salmon meal and fishmeal do provide better forms of protein, but they are not the main ingredients and do not provide a satisfactory amount of protein for a healthy cat. Furthermore, the artificial colors are unnecessary, and the addition of brewer's yeast can cause allergies in cats.<br /><br />Meow Mix, a subsidiary of Del Monte, could have come up with something better!<br /><br />Top 5 Ingredients:<br />1. Ground yellow corn<br />2. Corn gluten meal<br />3. Chicken by-product meal<br />4. Soybean meal<br />5. Beef tallow preserved with mixed-tocopherols (source of Vitamin E)

review/summary: A healthy vegetarian snack!
review/text: I'm always on the lookout for healthy, sugar-free, vegetarian snacks. These taste great. I'm in love. They taste somewhat like a cross between potato chips and the crunchy fried onions you might find on green bean casserole. They're mildly salty, and not spicy at all (unlike some of the other Haldiran snacks). These do cause a bit of gas in the average person, so just be prepared. But they're easy to eat and I now carry them everywhere. I can't say enough good things about them. If they're sold out here on Amazon, they do sell these moong dal snacks at Indian grocery stores, if you happen to live near one. (That's where I first discovered moong dal.)

review/summary: Best Chili Ever
review/text: This dandy chili mix makes great chili. It is one of the best things I have tasted in a long time. It has a clever concept, which explains why it is a `kit'. The bag has 4 separate packets: a main chile packet (the chili powder has almost no heat, but lots of flavor), a small packet of cayenne, a small packet of salt, and a larger one with masa harina. This way, you adjust the heat, salt, and thickness to your liking; some chile mixes has everything combined, and you cannot change it. One kit is enough for 2 pounds of meat, so larger batches will require more kits.<br /><br />Course, I did not follow the included recipe. I tossed the salt (I used sea salt instead) and masa flour (it was plenty thick without it) packets, used beef chuck cut into 1 � inch cubes instead of ground beef (course, it took that much longer to cook, but so what?), and all of the cayenne packet. Boy was it good.

review/summary: Ordering it again!
review/text: I'm on the website today to order a second twelve-pack of this mix.  I haven't shopped around a lot; Carroll Shelby's is the first and only mix I've tried, and I'm very happy with it.  I found it on Amazon earlier this year after being unable to find it in local stores, and I've just recently gone through the first twelve-pack (okay, I gave one pack to my mother-in-law).<br /><br />I've converted my daughter and my mother-in-law to it, as well; they're both chili lovers and we use this recipe together with dark red kidney beans, diced tomatoes, a small can of tomato sauce, and ground turkey (healthier, and cheaper, and there's a small difference in texture and none in taste from ground beef).  We recommend going with the recipe option that calls for a large can of diced tomatoes, and about half the cayenne packet, and about 32 oz of canned dark red kidney beans, drained (the recipe only recommends 16 oz), and between 2 and 3 lbs of ground whatever.<br /><br />Ground beef, not too lean, or chopped chuck, or cubed pot roast are all good candidates for the meat.  As the package used to say, fifteen years ago, don't waste your money on expensive cuts of beef here.<br /><br />The directions are pretty basic and perfectly adequate to produce a good hearty meal.  Use a _big_ frying pan, 13" if you've got one, and have a larger stew pot/saucepan of some kind standing by in case your ingredients are too much for the pan.  Do stir frequently once you've added the spices and flour, because there's some tendency for the mix to thicken up and form a skin on the bottom of the pot, and you'll lose good flavor that way (not to mention the bottom might get burned and ruin the whole recipe).<br /><br />With 2-3 lbs of meat, two cans of beans and a large (28 oz) can of diced tomatoes in tomato juice, the whole thing makes six or seven _really_ generous portions (12-14 oz each).  I make it and freeze most of it in individual portions, taking it in to work and microwaving it at lunch.

review/summary: Delicious Chili Kit with Lots of Flexible Customization Options
review/text: Friends, I love good food. This Chili Kit by Carroll Shelby is excellent. It creates an extremely savory basic chili that is easy to adjust to your particular taste in the areas of: spicy/hot, salt, or thickness.<br /><br />The flavor created by the spices in the main packet is the best attribute. Lots of deep, low, earthy tones that have excellent complexity and subtlety.<br /><br />Another great feature is the brilliant strategy of putting the cayenne pepper in a separate pouch. I only put in a little. My wife likes her chili slightly warm: warm enough to be interesting. So, I put about 1/8th of the cayenne pouch when I cook the chili, then I sprinkle extra on only my serving when I eat my bowl-full. I like a little more warmth to add to the complex flavors without so much heat that I begin to loose the ability to taste all those wonderful layers of tastes.<br /><br />It is another exceptionally brilliant idea to put the salt in yet another separate pouch. Again, my wife does not like very much salt at all, so I don't put any in while cooking. I salt my bowl-full with some sea-salt, and in my opinion a little sea-salt REALLY brings out the complex flavors in this chili mix. I hope more products begin to put the salt in a separate packet. I think most folks would be appalled to see exactly how much salt is in the average meal-mix they buy: like Hamburger Helper for example. Plus for some reason good sea salt just tastes better than the cheap salt.<br /><br />Lastly, Mr. Shelby puts a packet of thickening powder in his kit - in addition to the main chili pack, the cayenne packet, and the salt packet. The thickening agent is simply finely ground corn meal and it does a nice job of thickening the chili if that is what you like and prefer. I have prepared this kit many times both with and without the thickening, and I like it both ways. I now just alternate for variety.<br /><br />PREPARATION TIPS from my personal preferences:<br />*Saute LOTS of onion to go in the chili. At lease one large yellow onion, and I sometimes do one-and-a-half.<br />*Always use the optional 15oz can of diced tomatoes (don't forget to reduce the amount of water used, like the direction on the box say.<br />*Always use the optional 15oz can of beans. My favorite are dark kidney beans, but greatly enjoy black-beans, pintos, or about any chili-style bean. TIP: drain the liquid from the can of beans into a bowl, and use the liquid as substitute for part of the "water" called for in the recipe.<br />*Some favorite toppings in the bowl: sea salt, cayenne powder, diced white onions, pepper jack or cheddar cheese, black olives, guacamole, salsa, sour cream, tortilla chips.<br /><br />I will address some of the complaints by negative reviewers:<br />1)A few said the chili was not very flavorful. Unfortunately in the USA most folks confuse "salt" with flavor. Since the mix has separate salt packet and none in the mix, I believe that nay-sayers have just not put in the prodigious amount of extra salt that they are used to associating with "flavor". As I wrote earlier, the chili benefits from some sea salt, but for my taste, does not need large amounts.<br /><br />2)Some may say the lack of heat is not flavorful enough. Well, there are folks who like things thermo-nuclear-hot, and you just can't get there with the little extra cayenne packet supplied in the kit. The chili with no cayenne at all is slightly warm, and varying amounts of the cayenne powder will satisfy the tastes of 99.999% of folks. For those who like more heat, add whatever crazy-hot stuff you require to get the heat you want.<br /><br />3)If your complaint is that it does not taste exactly like you want right out of the box (like some other brand perhaps), I disagree strongly, because I believe that the customization offered by the different pouches included, is a greatly beneficial feature. If they made it to taste exactly like YOU want, then it probably wouldn't taste like many other folks want.

review/summary: This makes INCREDIBLE chili!
review/text: I've been using this Carroll Shelby chili mix for years, but finding it in local stores has been hit or miss.  It had gotten to where I was buying several packages at a time whenever I could find it anywhere.<br /><br />I was amazed to find it here on Amazon, and for considerably less than I've paid in stores in the past.  I love chili, and usually make 1-2 batches per month during the winter, and at least a batch every couple of months during the summer.<br /><br />There's a recipe on the package, but I don't know anyone who actually follows it to the letter.  I suppose if you've never made chili before, it's a good starting place.  You can then decide how you might want to modify it.<br /><br />I usually use half ground beef and half ground turkey (approx. a pound of each), a chopped onion, a 28-oz can of "redi-cut" tomatoes, a small can of tomato paste, a small can of black beans, a small can of pinto beans; then, from the chili kit, I add the spice packet and the entire cayenne pepper packet.  They used to include a tiny bottle of tabasco sauce; they discontinued that in favor of the cayenne.  I like things a little spicy, and the amount of cayenne here makes for a low-medium "burn" level.<br /><br />Only occasionally do I find I need to use the masa flour.  Usually, my chili is thick enough without it.<br /><br />Finally, I top it with shredded colby-jack cheese, and serve it with cornbred muffins.  We're talking serious yum here.<br /><br />It makes amazing chili dogs, too.  And chili mac.  And chili cornbread casserole (thicken the chili a little, put it in a square baking dish, top with dollops of cornbread batter, bake at 350 until cornbread is puffed and starting to brown).<br /><br />Carroll Shelby's mix has just the right combination of spices to make the best tasting chili I've ever had.  I'll so glad that it's available right here on Amazon.

review/text: As the father and head cook in a home with many children, we grew fond of trying various chili recipes and methods over the years.  This mix has become my favorite go to mix.  I use it as a base and then add the many things we like in our special chili.  It really tastes good and has always come through with a great flavor and wonderful tasting chili.<br /><br />When making the chili for visiting family that might not like it as hot as we prefer, you can leave out the packet of hot spices, or perhaps add just half ;-).  We prefer it with a little kick and find adding all of the spices in this kit to really work well.<br /><br />We like to add many special things to this mix.  Since some may be curious how ours tastes, I'll include the essential ingredient list:<br />2 lbs chuck roast cut into small cubes.  Use your favorite cut<br />A green pepper or two (depends on what we have in our garden)<br />A hot pepper or two (again from our garden)<br />A jalepeno pepper for flavor ;-)<br />A couple of large onions<br />1 28oz can crused tomatoes in puree<br />2 15oz cans pinto beans<br />2 15oz cans black beans<br />Of course all of the seasoning including the hot packet<br />Salt and Pepper to taste<br /><br />5 stars, great mix we always keep some in our home.

review/text: We love this stuff. We don't just use this in our chili though. We use the spices the salt and all of the ceyene no masa. We always use two boxes for 3 pounds ground beef and 1 pound pinto beans. But we add our own stuff. We add one can of el pato (mexican tomato sauce)in replace of one of the cans of regular tomato sauce chipotle paste with adobo, 1/2 of a teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes and 2 table spoon dehydrated minced onion because I don't like the texture of real onions. We like it real spicy. As for the comment from one of the others that said this does not taste like real chili they are completely wrong. If you just eat canned chili then you will probably not like this. This is not meant to taste sweet if you want a sweet chili stick with your canned or I guess you can add some brown sugar. We eat nothing but this chili and will never change that. We make a huge batch so that way we can freeze it and at the end of a long work day we can still have bread bowls with chili or chili dogs. As we speak I have a batch slow cooking. If you have never had it give it a try.

I was thrilled to see it stocked on Amazon!<br />Inside each bag are 4 packets, one of chili seasoning, one of salt, one of red pepper (to make it more spicy), and one of masa flour (for thickening the chili). Enough to season 2 lb of meat.<br />If you don't add any of the red pepper, the result is mild but still delicious!<br />In addition to 2 lb of ground beef, I usually add bell peppers, onions, black beans, and kidney beans.<br />The resulting chili is easy to keep in the fridge (I just put it in tupperware) - makes especially great leftovers.

review/summary: Real Chili....... just the best! Used it for YEARS!
review/text: After living in East Texas for a number of years it became second nature to make chili using the venison provided by a generous neighbor..... ( then it was FREE..... now we pay for it, but it's "green" sustainable and healthy and delicious).<br />This makes really wonderful, authentic chili..... as long as you don't add beans to it! Two kits and four pounds of venison is just the right amount for us. We use : one beer in place of the water, the tomato sauce as called for,the masa mixed in water to a slurry ( for the mineral taste in the masa) and 2/3 of one pack of the cayenne..... perfect .<br />But DON'T brown the meat! Just let it simmer in the spices until it's tender and juicy, then add the cayenne, masa slurry and some of the salt..... give it 20 minutes to thicken up (add a bit more beer if it's too thick for your taste.<br />Top with raw minced onion and cotijo cheese, crumbled fine, a couple of thin slices of raw jalapeno for crunch and a hunk of hot water corn bread<br />on the side bread.....Divine!<br />That's the best part about having the components all seperate.. YOU decide how hot, thick, or salty you prefer...but his spices are spot on. We never add a thing.<br />If it plays in Terlingua, it plays for us.

review/summary: Something has changed about this chili mix
review/text: I used to love making chili using this kit, but something has changed in the mix. When the mix came in the bag, it was fantastic, but since they changed from the bag to the box, it's awful. Earlier this summer, I contacted the company and they were very nice; sent me a couple of coupons, but still I don't like the mix now. I contacted the company because when I made the chili using the mix, the chili was gritty as if the mix had beach sand in it. A few days ago, I bought two boxes of the mix. I made a pot of chili and again, the chili was gritty like sand. I had to throw out the pot of chili.  I then took the second box and mixed it with plain water and cooked it. Again, it was so gritty it was like chewing beach sand. So I know it wasn't something in the meat or in the tomato sauce. I checked the box for a Lot Number, but there isn't one on the box. The Best By Date is Nov 24 2012. Maybe the last two boxes I bought came from the same Lot as the ones I bought earlier this summer. Overall, I will have to scout for a different chili mix. The quality of this mix is not what it used to be.

review/summary: I love this stuff!
review/text: RIP Mr. Shelby...<br /><br />You made awesome cars I could never afford, but your chili kinda made up for that.  Seriously this chili mix is very hard to screw up.  The directions are very consise and clear, and it just tastes great.  I like the fact that all of the spices and flour are kept in separate packest, allowing you to make the chili exactly the way YOU like it.  Personally, I like a thicker chili which is flaming hot, so I end up using everything in the package as well as adding a minced habanero and chunks of beef.  If you add a bit of tomato paste before anything else, you will end up with a very flavorful chili.  You just need a tablespoon.  Anyway, I've been buying this for twenty years and I've never had a bad batch EVER.

review/text: I live on the east coast and chili is not as popular here as it is in the west.  I used to be able to buy this locally but over the last few years it has gotten tougher and tougher to find.  Being able to get a case of 12 is just the ticket, so now I can make chili instead of searching for the seasoning.<br /><br />As for the seasoning, it is the best I have found.  It gives a great base to start from and you can give it your own personality.

review/summary: It's how it's supposed to taste
review/text: I've been eating chili made with this since I was a kid, so for me, this is how chili is supposed to taste.<br />In my family, growing up, Mom did most of the cooking. Except tacos, chili and barbecue which my dad did. My dad, a bit of a racing fan, always got this kind of chili mix for chili. He would make it with chuck steak ground into thick meaty chunks, tomato sauce and use just a touch of the cayenne,half the salt, a bit of the thickener, and the chili flavor packet. Mom would make corn bread to go with it. The chili was served topped with cheese and onions with a thick slice of cornbread on the side dripping with honey and butter. My brother and I both loved chili night.<br />Skip forward to my adult years and my marriage, I explained to my husband one day that I wanted chili for dinner. He said we would get the things to make, and I told him "Dad always made the chili. I don't know how to, so you have to make the chili." He replied that he didn't know how to make chili, so I explained to him how to make it and told him what kind of seasoning to get. The same sort Dad always got. Now it's in boxes instead of brown bags, but it still tastes the same.<br />We make it to our tastes, and both of us make the chili. If I make it, I saut&eacute; a large onion then put in a lb of ground turkey and brown it. Then I add a large can of tomato puree and a can of kidney beans, and mix in the full chili packet, put the salt aside for popcorn another night, a bit of the masa thickener, and a pinch of cayenne and let it simmer for an hour. When my husband makes it, he makes it with very lean ground beef, tomato sauce, kidney beans, chili packet and a bit more pepper than I use, sometimes adding bell peppers and onions in while it's simmering. We usually serve it with tortillas on the side and topped with a sharp cheddar.<br />And my teens love chili night as much as I did when I was younger.

review/text: This winter has been really cold & wet and perfect for chili. I read on a message board for my college sports team's about Shelby's chili and how good it was for a prepacked mix and knowing how much my fellow LSU fans like spicy food, I thought I'd give it a try. I was really surprised how good it was and how little time it took to fix - about 30 minutes total. I'd recommend it to anyone and it is easy to adjust the heat - just add half the package of pepper mix to make it suitable for most tastes.

In fact, this is mt main dish for Superbowl Sunday! We serve it with additional fresh chopped onions and grated longhorn cheese as a final garnish. Yum!

review/summary: Not as good as homemade, but GREAT for a mix!
review/text: I've made this several times now, and I like it quite well.<br /><br />I always add onion, and I usually add green peppers.  I add the salt packet, but I don't add the cayenne or the masa to thicken it.<br /><br />Given the choice between my homemade chili or Carroll Shelby's, I would definitely pick my homemade chili...but the homemade chili takes over a day to make, and Carroll Shelby's takes less than an hour, SO if I'm looking for something quick, Carroll Shelby's is a great option.<br /><br />I also like this because it has a very "safe" ingredient list.  At our house we avoid MSG because my husband is very allergic to it, and that means we usually have to avoid processed foods, and most packaged foods like this.  We don't usually make items that list "natural flavors" or "spices," etc.  Amazingly, this chili works for us because the ingredients are all listed and they are all real things.<br /><br />I highly recommend this chili!

review/summary: Best Chili mix!
review/text: This chili mix makes THE best chili I've had. My dad used it when I was younger, and now I use it in my own chili. That is the only thing similar to my dad's chili. I don't use the salt (growing up I had to limit my salt intake to nothing), and the masa (mine usually turns out thick enough). I use about 1/2 the packet of cayenne and instead of 2 lbs ground beef, I use 1 lbs ground beef (or even moose or caribou since I live in Alaska) and 1 lb of pork sausage. Also, when browning the meat, I use 1/2 the chili mix packet as seasoning, and use the other 1/2 about 1/2 way through my cooking time. I then place the beans, browned meat plus 1 can italian stewed tomatoes, 1 can water and 1 can tomato sauce. set the slow cooker on low and about 1/2 way through I add the other 1/2 seasoning packet. Turns out GREAT every time and I've placed in many chili cook-offs using this recipe.

review/summary: Tough to Beat, Hide the Box & Guests Think You Are a Genius
review/text: With ingedients in four packets, make it hot or not as you wish. Start with the recipe on the box. Nothing extra except meat and tomoato sauce is needed.<br /><br />I used two parts sirloin and one part trimmed center-cut pork chops cut into 1/4" cubes instead of ground beef. I reduced the quantity of this lean mix to 1.5 lbs from 2 lbs. I also sauteed with the meat 3/4 cup onion and 3/4 cup mixed Anaheim and Jalapeno chopped peppers.<br /><br />Thicken with a roux made from the included Masa flour (corn flour) or not depending on your taste. The result can be not only geat chili but also great taco filling, enchilada sauce, or nacho topping. Note that Tex-Mex chili (chili con carne) traditionally has no beans; but do as you like of course. I make half with beans and half without and let my guests choose.<br /><br />Robb Walsh's "Tex-Mex Cookbook" got me going on Tex-Mex food. It's a beautiful book filled with the history of this regional cooking and lots of great recipes.

review/text: I've used Carroll Shelby's Chili Kit for quite a few years now, and it's my favorite mix. It's a nice blend of spices, and takes the guess work out of figuring out how much chili powder to use.  I recommend using about half of the "hot" (cayenne pepper) spice pack unless you really like your chili super hot.  Also works great if you add diced tomatoes and Rotel or mild peppers and onion.  I've been purchasing from local markets for a long time, and then suddenly could not find it in stores.  Amazon to the rescue.

review/text: A Texas transplant to Maryland, it has been hard to find good chili mix at the grocery store.  For a brief and wonderful year, my local store carried my favorite, Wick Fowler's 2-Alarm Chili Kit.  Then they restocked with this stuff.  While it appears to be made by the same folks, it's AWFUL.  They've left out the onions, there's almost no cayenne pepper (they say to make it hot add the whole package, I would have needed about a half dozen of their little packages to even touch hot!), and the herbs and spices are all mixed together so there's not real sense of how much of anything you're putting in.  No problem if it's good, but since it's not...  It appears that they've upped the chili powder quotient and backed off on everythign else.  If you like chili, don't bother with this stuff!

review/summary: Great quality beef, decent flavor
review/text: This jerky contains MSG or I would probably give it 5 stars. The MSG doesn't really bother me personally, but it does add a bit too much saltiness.<br /><br />Aside from being a tad too salty this is really some of the best packaged jerky I've bought. The quality of the meat is some of THE best I've ever seen, as good as I could make myself. It has a nice note of heat in the after taste, but the taste of the beef itself comes thru wonderfully. Awesome texture and consistency and definitely a good value for a whole pound of jerky.<br /><br />I will say value-wise Wild Ride Sweet n Hot is still my favorite choice. But from now on, when they are out of stock this will be my go-to product. If MSG doesn't bother you, try it!

review/summary: GREAT PRODUCT!
review/text: Unlike other clueless people this is the Spanish version of Nutella and it is really similar or the same. So if you like Nutella (which most Americans are familiar with, this is the same thing)<br />Composition of Nocilla and Nutella:<br />Sugar, vegetable oil, hazelnuts (4% Nocilla; 13% Nutella), skim cocoa (8.5% Nocilla; 7,4% Nutella), powdered skim milk (4.5% Nocilla; 6.6% Nutella) etc. so clearly the Nutella has more of a nutty flavor but overall Nocilla is a great snack.

review/summary: Dreadful
review/text: I wasn't exactly sure what to expect when I tasted this stuff, but I guess something that tasted at least a little like, say, chocolate and maybe hazelnut?  That's definitely not what I got with this - it definitely didn't have any hazelnut taste at all and any taste of chocolate was very faint to stay the least.  It sort of tasted like marshmallow cream, except much sweeter (and not in a good way).  It also had a strong aftertaste of artificial vanilla.  Not only did it taste horrible, but the texture was really strange - it was nearly liquid.  Its only saving grace is that it came in a nice re-usable little glass jar so it's not a total waste of money.

review/summary: Only reason I don't give 5 out of 5 is because of the title..
review/text: My dog's new favorite treat... The pieces are very inconsistent, but a dog doesn't seem to care... Only thing is I don't see how these could be a training treat, some of the pieces are as big as my pinky finger... But anyways, it is obviously a very high quality treat and I was pleasantly surprised when I got them.  Oh, and don't be fooled by the ounces (quantity)... these treats are dried, so you get a lot.

review/summary: No complaints from the dog...
review/text: Obviously this is second-hand as I certainly have not tried them. The label states and by appearance this is freeze-dried liver that's cut into treat sized chunks. Our dog loves them and has never said no. They came with a pretty substantial time frame left on the expiration.

review/summary: Huge hit with dogs (and cats too!)
review/text: I got these as a gift for a friend's dalmation (Yuki) but before I could deliver them my cats got into the container and helped themselves!  When the remainder finally made it to my friend and her dog, her dog loved them so much my friend has to ration them -- I think if Yuki had her way she'd eat the whole 4 ounces in a minute!  Also, this company is great -- got my order quickly and in great condition.

review/summary: Our pups love these treats!
review/text: First - these are some very nice, high-quality freeze-dried liver treats.  Both of our dogs love them.<br /><br />They're great training treats for several reasons:<br />1) Freeze-dried so they're not messy<br />2) Dogs think they're incredibly yummy (I haven't tried them myself...)<br />3) Because they're yummy, they're motivational<br />4) They come in nice small-sized chunks<br /><br />They're not perfect treats for other purposes.  For example, you can't use these to hide a pill inside to get medication into your furry friend - you need soft treats to do that.  If your dog is extremely scent-motivated, I'm not sure how well these would work since I don't detect any strong scent or odor from them - but the dogs love the taste!<br /><br />We got these for free with a medication order, and we really like them.  I'd definitely have paid the asking price, so if you're considering this purchase, go ahead.  I don't think you'll be disappointed!

review/summary: A good reward for my pet and wallet.
review/text: You will know if your pet likes these within a heartbeat.  I now buy the 19.5oz to get more for my money.  These are great for overweight dogs but keep it at a maximum of 5 or so a day.  These are high in protein and are as natural as they can get.<br /><br />Very easy storage and have not had an issue with freshness.  I like to keep a 4oz tub on hand to refill from my 19.5oz.  You will not be disappointed!

review/summary: Not our pups favorite - but he'll eat it
review/text: These treats are very dry and brittle.  We like smaller, moist treats for training rather than the dryness and varying sizes of the blocks that come in this container.  Our pup would always eat these treats, but he wasn't as eager in training as he can be with others.

On top of that, it's 100% all natural beef liver, zero preservatives and only 13 calories per bit! Finally, a treat that I can give Tyson without the worries of fattening him up!

review/summary: Ch-ch-check it out
review/text: In a word? Runa Guayuas is cool.  The peppermint is my favorite flavor.  The taste is simple and delicious without the sometime bitter taste other teas tend to develop if they are steeped too long.  What I really like about this product is that even though it has quite a bit of caffeine there  is no jittery or jolted feeling after I drink it but just the feeling of being totally awake.  I have been substituting this in for coffee especially in the afternoon and I really like it.<br /><br />I highly recommend giving this product a try! Not convinced?  Runa is a socially responsible company who works close with the farmers in Ecuador who grow their Guayusa.  Their story is inspiring and this is a business worth supporting!<br /><br />Cheers!

review/summary: Delicious & immune boosting!
review/text: The guayusa, as always, gives that nice balanced boost that I've come to love. However, the ginger balance of this really does it. To be honest I think ginger is usually an overwhelming flavor in a lot of teas, and this one does it right. The orange adds a hint of tart sweetness (no, that's not an oxymoron) that really rounds it out.<br /><br />One note for the prior review, while it may be cheaper on other sites, for this product the shipping options actually make it cheaper than where I've seen it pretty much anywhere else.
