review/text: I have been trying many different coffees from Amazon over the past year. I can't really decide which is the best. I just started using a package of Cameron's Woods & Water whole bean coffee and I am beginning to think that I am in love....<br />I will try another bag of this coffee before deciding for sure, but I think this is the one. It is very smooth, no bite. I also noticed that while many whole bean coffees are "messy" when you grind them, this one is not. I definitely recommend that you try it.

If we stayed in one place for more than 3 months at a time, I'd definitely sign up for the monthly shipping program, or whatever it's called, because that's an even better deal.

review/summary: it's okay but nothing to write home about
review/text: I love Cameron's French roast, I love the quality of it, the high roast on the bean, love the overall flavor.  So I thought we'd enjoy their lighter roast too when we want a less robust coffee.  This didn't do it though. It's an adequate coffee, meaning not terrible and it is fresh, but it's got a back sort of oily/clanky flavor reminding me of supermarket brands, which isn't terrible but not good either.<br /><br />I always freeze my coffee, taking out what I need for about a week and storing those beans in a container in the frig, so the coffee is always fresh and we use a Cuisinart grind and brew, which makes great coffee.<br /><br />I would use it again if I had to, but I wouldn't recommend it as Cameron's best nor would I go out of my way to buy it.

review/summary: Great Coffee after a bad start
review/text: I am quite disappointed.  I read the reviews about this coffee from Cameron's that had received a 5 star rating.  When the coffee arrived the bag was evidently open and you could plainly smell the aroma of coffee.  I am sure that whoever packed this bag of coffee could also smell the aroma of coffee escaping the bag and indicating a faulty seal, but they shipped it anyway.  I ordered premium coffee and I got coffee from an open bag that had been slowly going stale for God knows how long.  This is not what I payed for and certainly not what was advertised.  Where was the quality control ? Who checked this order ?<br /><br />Update: Amazon replaced the order of course, and the coffee is quite good for a medium roast.  As a matter of fact I get it shipped every 2 months and I blend it with another French Roast and it is almost as good as Back Country Roasters Cowboy Mud (excellent dark French roast)

review/text: As the previous reviewer stated, I also received one measly box of 16 pop tarts for $27.  Wow, those are some expensive pop tarts!  ;)  When I called Amazon to rectify the situation it took a 45 minute call trying to explain to the CS rep that no one in their right mind would pay $1.69 PER pop tart.  They finally assured me they would send me the correct order.  So I waited....and whaddaya know....once again recieved one box.  LOL  I called again and had to go through the whole 45 minute convo again explaining how much a pop tart *should* cost.  This CS told me he couldn't resend, but would just refund my money.  Thank heavens.  My blood pressure couldn't take another delivery!

review/text: Now, this is a flavor of Pop-Tarts done RIGHT. The crust is graham-cracker, so it adds a nice kick to the whole treat that the regular crust doesn't. The filling is half marshmallow and half chocolate, and when you toast the tarts long enough, the filling becomes all nice and gooey and you can lick it out of the edges. Frosting is also pretty good, but the real treat is the filling and the fact that the crust tastes better than most others.

review/summary: Tasty low calorie sauce
review/text: I was surprised to see this delicious sauce rated so low, but then I read the reviews and saw people had been having problems with receiving the wrong item or with open and spoiled jars. I have ordered this twice now and luckily have had neither of those problems. Hopefully this means those problems are no longer happening.<br /><br />As to the sauce itself, it looks and tastes very fresh. It's a little spicy, but not too much, and so long as you mix it before serving is not watery as one reviewer described it. The colour is good and it looks very appetising when mixed with something such as a wholewheat rigatoni. It is also very low calorie, only 40 calories per serving (or about 200 for the entire jar), and has only fresh, wholesome ingredients, no preservatives, etc. I like it so much I have set it up for auto delivery, which brings the price (which is a little high) down 15%.

I've ordered this sauce several times recently and all containers have been intact with expiration dates far in the future.  I've odered this sauce more than once because I like it very much.  The price is very reasonable compared to other brands in the stores when it can be found at all.  It's spicey, as it should be, but not overly so.  As with their other sauces, there are recognizable chuncks of the various ingredients rather than a uniform liquid when its impossible to tell what's in it.

In fact, I would be surprised if you even made it through the meal.<br /><br />I'll have to contact Amazon as well, because at least one of my containers was leaking and I received a variety pack instead of only arrabiata. I love arrabiata sauce and it's not easy to find. However, something just went very wrong with this one. It's possible that it arrived spoiled, because it tasted somewhat foul and I developed a stomach ache a couple hours after I tasted a few bites of pasta and pushed the plate aside.<br /><br />I don't even know if I want to try out the other three containers anymore. Life is short. Eat accordingly.

I was right!! As with the bacon flavor, if you want a treat that will last a while, this is definitely not it! It takes less than a minute for my dogs to make one of them history.<br /><br />Just FYI: I've ordered this item twice and both times I received "Better Than Ears Plus Hip & Joint" (which contains glucosamine and condroitin). That's fine with me, but it's not listed in the description so I thought I would mention it for those who may have concerns about supplements.<br /><br />And just in case you're confused by the 1.95 pound specification, it translates into 36 "ears" per package. I just wish Amazon would make this item available through Subscribe & Save like the bacon flavor!!

review/summary: Delicious cookies, but not single serving packs
review/text: Let me start by saying that I really like these cookies. If you're going to give your child cookies, these are not so bad healthwise. However, the size leads you to believe that one bag contains a single serving, when it actually contains 2 servings at 120 calories each. That's a bit too many calories in a snack for a young child, I think. I buy snack packs so that when I'm on the go, I can open a bag and hand it to my kid. I don't feel that I can do that with these.

review/summary: Bit Too Dry
review/text: These don't taste like cardboard, thankfully; they have a pleasant, subtle almost nutty flavor, as if peanut butter is in them. However, the texture, even in the center of the cookie, is not moist at all!! I was hoping the outside would be slightly crunchy while the inside was softer and moist. They also crumble easily. They are alright but nothing I'd purchase again.

review/text: This was another great find on Amazon Grocery!! They are very tasty, crunchy little cookies.  My family has really enjoyed these, they have a great mild chocolate taste and quite the crunch.  Most of the animal crackers/cookies that I've purchased for my family have become dismembered sometime before my children get them out of the package, these are mostly whole and you can really tell what the critter is before you pop it in your mouth ... Extra fun snack time for the little ones.  All in all, the box of cookies is well worth the price and I feel good about packing healthier snacks in my children's backpacks for school.

I haven't tried any of the other flavors but as an adult who loves chocolate I can tell you that these are very yummy.

review/summary: THE Best Healthy Cookies Out There!
review/text: These chocolate chip cookies are addicting! They are the best tasting cookies out there, and they are healthy for you too! They are crisp, fresh, and have an even amount of chocolate vs cookie flavor. They are not animal crackers by any means.<br /><br />The only thing I would suggest is to make sure you have them delivered to some place cool (not to your door step on a hot July day!) as one batch came out a little not-so-crisp, and I'm pretty sure it was because of that.<br /><br />These cookies are almost twice as expensive in the stores where I live if I buy them by the bag. Forget that! I'm sticking with them here on Amazon!<br />Thanks, Amazon!

review/summary: Did the recipe change?
review/text: I notice that the most positive reviews are from a few years ago, and the most negative reviews are more recent.  We used to buy these in larger containers at the local "healthy supermarket," and my family really liked them.  That was a few years ago.  Now, they sit in the back of the pantry and no one touches them--either the recipe changed or my family's tastes changed.  They are dry, about half of them are broken, and they taste like sweetened cardboard.  (We have the vanilla variety.)  The individual packs are handy for hikes and portable snacks, but I've noticed that they frequently come back unopened.  Guess I'll look for an alternative.

review/summary: VEGANS BEWARE - These contain milk.
review/text: These are delicious and actually have pieces of peanut butter in them. Crunchy but still creamy, and so yummy. However, I didn't check the ingredients before purchasing and assumed that - like the Vanilla, Chocolate Chip and Oatmeal - these would be vegan. They're not - they have whey and milk powder in them. For a non-vegan, these taste great and are a more healthy choice than your standard cookie.<br /><br />For the calorie counters: these have almost 50% more calories per serving than the other Snackimals flavors. Most of the other flavors are 110 calories per 10 cookie serving, and the Peanut Butter are 150 calories per 10 cookie serving.

The deal you get on amazon can not be beat. I have gotten these from health food stores at a MUCH higher price than the rate they go for here. I do no have kids but when I do these will make it into their lunch  boxes. For adults who are looking to maintain weight but give into your cravings this is the perfect snake. i love love love these. I would highly recommend to everyone.

review/summary: So good!...........
review/text: One of my carry-over faves from childhood is animal crackers.  I love them.  I'll have to admit I am a big fan of organic items and also am a sucker for clever/cute packaging, so I brought these home tonight to give them a whirl.  Delicious!  These are not a thick animal cracker like nabisco, but a thin crunchy one.  The peanut butter tastes just like a peanut butter cookie should and is not overly sweet.  The package is 7.5 oz and carries 7 servings of 10 cookies for 150 calories (25 from fat).  1 g saturated fat, 2g fiber, 10 g sugar, 3g protein and 2% calcium, and 4% iron.  All natural ingredients, with natural peanut butter, no hydrogenated oils, artificial flavors, additives or preservatives.  I would feel fine eating these or giving to a kid for a sweet snack.  The first ingredients on the label?  Organic unbleached flour and peanut butter.<br /><br />I'm very happy I tried these and will definitely try more of the other cookies in this brand's line.<br /><br />Overall a delicious product, well packaged in a convenient resealable bag.  Perfect for car trips, home or office.  Now you can indulge and feel slightly better about it!

review/text: All kids like animal crackers, don't they? Well our three-year-old boy certainly does. So my wife picked up a 7.5-ounce bag of Barbara's Shackimals Chocolate Chip animal crackers. I'm leery of having snacks around and I'm not too fond of having the kid eat a lot of snacks, but my wife assures me that these are relatively healthy snacks. Hmmmmm. I suspect that these are just as much for her as for the boy. Well, what can you do? We already have them and the bag is open. I might as well try one just to see what they're all about. Mmmmmm. Somewhat dry and crunchy. Nice chocolatey taste, but not too heavy. Sweet, but only lightly sweet. Nice snack or treat! Of course, the boy loves them! I'm going to have problems staying away from these.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: Choc. Chip review: I wish I found these before the kids got out of school for the summer because they are a great school lunch item.  I like the ingredients and packs are big enough to share with another person.  I bought based on good reviews and found them to be crispy and delicious.  They taste like those little animal crackers you find in the small, red, zoo-like boxes with the string handles I had as a child but these are crispier and better ingredients.  I didn't sense the chocolate chip in the flavor but they are good. Recommend! :)<br /><br />EDIT:  Tried the Oatmeal flavor and was sadly disappointed..2 stars from me. The taste was bland and nothing exceptional for the over-the-top cost.  PLUS...Amazon only lets you review ONE FLAVOR even if you try others.  Obnoxious and deceptive...makes all flavors look 5 star when they are NOT.

review/text: My son has a ton of allergies and there are so few things he can have that are not homeade.  These cookies however have made the list for snack food he can eat being that they are free of peanuts, wheat, soy, treenuts and more.  I have not found an animal cracker on the market that is free of all those allergens.  usually they at least have soy. the bigger deal for me though is that these things are GOOD! I tried them and love them.  I don't eat them of course but the majority of the allergy free food I try of my sons, i dont' really like.  I'd never eat them more than once. these though I coudl definately.  My other son loves them too. It is so great to find a snack food for a small child with allergies that he can take to school and be like every one else.

review/summary: Really tasty cookies despite confusing reviews
review/text: I'm not sure if there was a bad batch of these sent out in 2011 or something, but the bag I bought for my son on 5/27/12 was really quite good. If you're familiar with the Nature Valley Oat and Honey granola bars, the oatmeal Barbara's Snackimals taste almost exactly like those, only they're much neater to eat and easier to chew since they're thinner and smaller. Yes, the cookies have a tendency to break, but they taste *great*. My son (2 1/2) loved them, and even his two cousins (6 and 2 1/2), who get more sugary treats than he did, helped to demolish the bag. All the adults were a bit jealous, I think--the Snackimals were much tastier than our potato chips . . .

review/text: I purchased these because of the outstanding reviews. I needed some cute, yummy animal cookies for my nieces baby shower. I was making a banana pudding in my trifle dish and wanted little animal cookies to march around the edge and show through the bowl. Well, I am happy to say it worked and these were yummy! I had quite a few bags left and my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed them! He is now asking for more. LOL So I am going to try some of the other flavors.

review/summary: THE BEST ANIMAL CRACKERS EVER
review/text: I just bought these for my daughter today at our local health food store and I was very skeptical, but now I'm addicted to these. I hate to say that I ate my daughter's cookies but I did and will "sadly" have to go buy her some more tomorrow. I LOVE sweets but these are perfect, not too sweet but just perfect and you don't have to feel horrible about eating them all! LOVE THEM!

review/summary: Glorious
review/text: The Barbara's snackimals are an unexpected surprise.<br />These cookies come in a 2 servings per bag package at 2.25oz each which in perspective is more mass than a 99cent bag of chips at Subway et al. So relatively satisfying portion if eating as intended, 1 bag at a time.<br /><br />Delicious oaty flavor, tasting of molasses and vanilla, 2 of their few ingredients, these cookies are crispy.  Yet they chew down to goo just like the old-fangled animal crackers with the carnival packaging.<br /><br />I feel good about buying them, relatively snacking, and I feel good about consuming them, again, relatively speaking.<br />Recommended in all ways, no drawbacks that I have discovered yet.

review/text: We've tried the vanilla and now regularly order the oatmeal version for our kids' snack. Both are very good.  The oatmeal variety has more "texture" but our 5 year old still loves them. I also eat them occasionally and also prefer oatmeal; they are sweet but not too sweet and make a great snack!

review/text: My kids really enjoyed these animal crackers. I purchased them as an easy snack, to throw in the zoo bag or park backpack for busy summer days. I appreciate that they don't use refined sugar and they have whole wheat. My kids love the shapes and the taste. They taste quite good and held up well. This is my first time to try the Barbara's Bakery brand. Can't wait to try other varieties.

review/text: My 3 year-old daughter and I need to avoid wheat-- but are not strictly gluten-free.  We also avoid all artificial sweeteners, corn syrup, etc.  These animal cookies are great.  She is able to bring them to school and eat them when the other kids have "regular" animal crackers and she is excited to be eating the same thing.

Amazon is great because I can't find them in stores all the time, often can only find the Oatmeal flavor.

review/summary: More chocolate than you expect
review/text: Being a natural, somewhat healthy cookie, I expected a carob-y cardboard flavor.  Not so!  While you can see very small specks of chocolate, I think most of the chocolate flavor comes from the pale brown swirls throughout the cookie.  The chocolate is far more flavorful than you would imagine.  They are simply wonderful, cute little cookies.

review/summary: My kids love these
review/text: These are great animal crackers. My kids all love them. It's great to have a portable snack that my chemically-sensitive kids can eat. These are going to be great to bring on picnics, to the park, on car trips, etc.<br /><br />The biggest quibble I have is that the "snack-size" bags are a little too large for younger kids (pre-schoolers or kindergartners) to finish at one sitting. If I send a bag in with my kindergartner for snack time, even though he loves them he can't finish them all. About 1.5 oz would be plenty for young kids.<br /><br />Ironically, they are cheaper per ounce in the snack size bags than in the larger boxes. You'd expect it to be the other way around.<br /><br />I'll definitely be ordering more of these.

review/summary: Good quality product, but the flavor is not what I had hoped
review/text: First, this is a good quality product: they use quality ingredients and the crackers have a nice "animal cracker" crunchy texture. Flavor is such a subjective thing that I hate to down-rate a high quality product too much just on that basis. But I won't be ordering any more of these.<br /><br />My oldest son says they don't have enough cinnamon to achieve a strong cinnamon flavor, but too much to achieve just a hint of cinnamon flavor. I think they actually have the right amount of cinnamon, but aren't quite sweet enough, especially on the exterior. They just come across a little bit bland. I know a lot of people say that is just because people are used to over-sweetened foods, but I think the chocolate chip flavor Snackimals have just the right amount of sweetness. In any case, my kids don't like them - but they do like the chocolate chip flavor.
