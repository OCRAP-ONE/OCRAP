review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: I haven't seen these since I was a little kid.  Used to find them in Hi-Health stores.  All-natural, preservative free and you wouldn't believe it.  The red packages are plain honey and VERY sweet.  They will give you a sugar buzz for sure.  Milk and honey are my favorite.  Don't know how you would describe "milk" flavor but whatever it is, it softens the honey flavor and makes them great.  I don't like menthol so I'll leave the description of those to those who might like them. :)<br /><br />These are made by a company in Italy and again, they are probably the best candy I've ever had in my life.  They are hard coated but after a bit become soft and they are filled with honey or 'milk and honey' centers.  Not something that will break your teeth.  These are well worth the price, and without all the extra gunk in all the other candies out there these days.  Get some!

review/summary: Greatest treat around
review/text: Last year I had coronary bypass surgery and my daughter came to stay with me. She went food shopping and ran across these little gems. She remembered me eating them from when she was a child. Well, now she is hooked on them too. I love the milk and honey the best, and the older the better. I love it when the hard part of the candy becomes soft and the whole thing is chewy. I purchased a box, but the expiration date is 2014. They will be long gone before they get chewy.<br />I can always count on Amazon to have whatever product I am looking for.

review/summary: Not very good
review/text: Tony Luke has made a name for himself here in Philadelphia with his sandwiches. The Roast Pork sandwiches are a favorite of many. Now his company is marketing a frozen version of the Pork Sandwich, which I recently tried. (1) the meat tasted oldish--not quite bad, but not fresh. (2) The method of heating the pork (boiling bag in jus) means the pork does not have a "roasted" flavor, and the "Italian seasoned jus" does not hide the off flavor of the pork. (3) The bun is cheap, nothing special. (4) There were actually two pieces of bone in my sandwich. My impression was that big bucks became more important than quality.<br /><br />His fresh made sandwiches are probably better, but the frozen variety is a rip off.

I had hoped this would prove a longer lasting alternative to rawhide for the greyhound, and if not, I thought at least the other dog would like it. Well I bought this weeks ago and so far I can't convince either dog to be interested. As far as they're concerned, it's a flavorless hunk of plastic.

review/text: Bought these for my teething 3.5 month old Wheaten Terrier and she went to town on them. Last quite a while and pass through my dogs system pretty easily without causing any heavy diarrhea or making her sick. Def recommend this for a teething dog or just a dog who loves to chew (which is pretty much ALL dogs). My silky terrier finds these extremely uninteresting, but she's a picky brat. If your dog will chew on anything with even a slight flavor, these will work out well.

review/summary: Durable Nylabones are Less Durable Lately.,,
review/text: These durable Nylabones seem to be somewhat less durable in the past couple years.  I have an older Nylabone in the same flavor  & size that my dog is still working at, and it's still in good shape. But I've purchased two more in the past year, in this and another flavor, and each time the pieces of plastic come away too easily & quickly.  By 20 minutes into chewing, there are too many large pieces coming off, and I have to take it away. Swallowing this stuff is not good. I think Nylabone might be intentionally making these LESS durable so that we'll have to buy them more often, since the old ones lasted a lifetime.<br /><br />Also - note that this item is indeed the newer, textured version of the toy.  I was hoping it wouldn't be, but I couldn't find it in this flavor and size in the untextured, and the description didn't mention it either way. My dog didn't seem to care either.<br /><br />As for all the Souper sized Nylabones, I wish they'd make the same thing just a bit longer in length. My dog is very tall but with a long narrow snout. He doesn't like anything that's too big to easily get in his mouth, like the "big" dog Nylabone toys. This toy is almost long enough for him to hold it well with his paws while chewing, but not quite.

review/text: My Lab has always been an extremely aggressive chewer, to the point where we don't dare get him any plush chew toys any more because they'll be shredded on the first day. We got this for him when he was about 4 months old and he showed no interest in it. He much preferred the Nylabone Dura Chew Wishbone Wolf instead. This was simply too big for him and he preferred other chew toys that fit his smaller jaws better.<br /><br />He's now 7 months old and he's grown to the point where he LOVES this Nylabone. It's super hard so it'll last a very long time for even the most aggressive chewer. As with any hard plastic chew you need to supervise: throw it out before it gets too small.

review/text: These things last at least 20 times longer than a typical rawhide chew toy.  The base material is not digestible but the pieces that break off from the toy are small flakes that pass right through my dog.  In other words, the nylon material does not break or fracture off; instead, it slowly wears down in a controlled manner.<br /><br />I did not have very good results with the softer, clear nylabone rubber bones -- my dog was able to chew off medium-sized pieces, which could easily get lodged in his throat.<br /><br />-Protect internet privacy.

He chewed on it for 2-3 hours... this will definitely be a repeat buy from me!  The only thing is I find the bone a little too small (which is my fault, the product dimensions were clearly stated on the website).  I have a 21 pound dog and it looks a little too tiny for him, so I think I'll get the next size up next time I purchase this.<br /><br />I've also tried the other variety nylabones, which don't fair well with my dog (edible chews, etc).  The softer ones get gobbled up by my dog to quickly, which is why I stick with the durachews.  For those powerful chewers, it's the best!

In fact, they don't show much interest in the Nylabones unless I do this. I think maybe because when the outer layer is roughed up it releases the smell and encourages chewing. I will never buy a different brand of bone for my dogs!  Thank you Nylabone for making such a wonderful product!

review/summary: No This Will Not Kill Your Dog
review/text: I just want to see that the "Most Helpful Critical Review" is NOT what you should go off of. At the time of writing, this person claims warnings and that your dog can die. If you read your review, she states her dogs chew at these until nothing is left. For the record, the instruction manual in the packaging and common sense say that if large chunks are breaking off or the nubs on the end get too worn, then THROW IT AWAY. Not doing so can very well kill your dog, but thats because hes not using it properly. People die from ladders too, doesnt mean I'm gonna stop using it so long as I follow instructions.<br /><br />On to the item itself. I love Nylabones. My Husky loves Nylabones. I usually get just the regular basic ones, but my dog is coming up on a year old, weighs 43 pounds, and chews like crazy. So I purchased the Dura-Chew Large, rated for dogs over 50 pounds. I looked at pictures, read reviews and thought "I can't wait; he'll actually be able to use it for more than a week". The item arrived, and by the next day large gashes were on one side, and the other was already bristling (it's supposed to, see my above paragraph if you don't read instructions). By the middle of the next week, I threw it out.<br /><br />So I give it three stars. It's a great product, my dog loved it, and he used it. However, I certainly would not call this "Dura-Chew", nor rate it at 50 lbs+. Perhaps the weight rating is only for the size of the bone. A good product, but powerful chewers look elsewhere.

review/summary: Great investment
review/text: My lab loves just about anything nylabone makes. These chew toys are a little more expensive than others but they last for a considerable amount of time and they dont make a mess. Personally, I wont give my dog rawhide treats, besides the safety warnings, I also find them to be very messy, leaving white, pasty residue where ever my dog takes them. The nylabones do not leave a mess and my dog seems to enjoy the flavors. The material they use doesnt shatter or form sharp edges, so it has a safety advantage over rawhides or real bones, too. Needless to say, I've been very pleased with the nylabones I've purchased and will not be switching brands anytime soon.

review/summary: Good for serious chewer
review/text: My dog is a serious chewer. He actually eats bedding we put in his crate so we had to purchase a high quality Kuranda bed that he can't get his teeth into. Toys can be a problem. I've found Nylabones work very well for him. He has several styles, including this one and loves them. I give him one at night when he is put in his crate and also when he needs something constructive to do during the day. He will often go to his crate, pull out the Nylabone to carry it to where he wants to lounge at the moment. I would definitely recommend this for heavy chewers. We haven't had a problem with Regal breaking off pieces to swallow, but it's always a good idea to supervise any new toy with your dog before giving free access to it. All dogs are different. For Regal, this works and has lasted well.

He will eat anything and has almost died despite my best efforts to keep him away from harmful things.  I find he loves this bone and will go to it at night when we are watching tv and he gets bored.  He likes the thunk sound it makes when he drops it on the tile floor.  I highly recommend this toy for anyone dealing with an "orally fixated" dog with a high energy level.

review/text: One of the best pieces of advice I received when I got my puppy was to expose her to Nylabone products.  They are one of the few dog toys that, 6 years later, she doesn't destroy within  5 minutes.  This item was much smaller than I expected, making the price, along with shipping, not such a great buy. The term "wolf" was misleading. Could of purchased same item in pet store for this price.  Better for a small, maybe medium sized dog.

review/text: We purchased this just before adopting a 45pound, 6-month-old blue heeler mix. It took him a couple of days, but he will now chew on it for a few minutes at a time. It is perfect for redirecting his chewing - when he grabs something he shouldn't chew, we replace it with the nylabone or his kong to show him what he is allowed to chew on. He doesn't seem like a super tough chewer, so far the nylabone shows no wear and tear, but I might worry with a larger/stronger dog.

review/summary: Nylabone is reliable in product quality
review/text: I have three dogs.  Two of them are nearly 50 pounds and one of them is just over 20 pounds.  Regardless of their sizes, all three are STRONG chewers.  This means only the highest durability dog toys can be given to them and this one passed the test!<br /><br />This bone is a very good size (Souper) and the chicken flavor seems to really draw my dogs to it.  Usually those flavorings appear to wear off over a couple of days, but we've had this one for a bit now and the dogs still pick it over their other toys.  Of course, that may also simply be because it's currently the newest of their toys and therefore the most awesome and amazing and fantastic in their eyes.<br /><br />Bottom line:  I recommend this to any strong chewers and the length is perfect for my dogs to wrap their paws around it/prop it on their arms while really chewing down into it.

review/summary: NylaBone Dura Chew, chicken
review/text: My dogs jumped on these! I've purchased the Souper bones for years. They've loved the Soupers but deviated with the hope of providing at least a small change for them. The reaction was positive, to say the least. Maybe it's the texture but my Chessie was very happy. He mauled his on the first day, an unusual reaction for him. It's still usable, it just bears thorough "Chessie marks". My GSD loves his too.<br />I've not given any dog a rawhide chew for many, many years. Some may report no problems but a Lab chewed off the end of a rawhide chew; I lost him due to that darn thing. Good luck to you if you furnish those to your dogs. I sincerely hope that you never face the same tragedy. Oh yeah, ONLY NylaBone chews for my guys. I love them too much to see them foolishly lost.

review/text: I ordered two of these bones for my two pitbull mixes. Both of the bones together, shipped, on amazon cost what one of them was in the pet store. These bones hold up well to my strong chewers and they're only able to get little shaving pieces off at a time. To the people who have trouble with these bones because their dogs ate them, These bones are NOT edible! It states it directly on the package. If your dog swallows large pieces of things or chews large pieces off these are NOT for your dog. ALWAYS supervise your animals when they are chewing on toys. All in all these bones are great for my two big mushball pitters. :)

review/text: We got this for our black lab puppy. She is an aggressive chewer. She loved this bone, so much so that she destroyed it. I don't recall exactly how long it lasted, but only a couple months. We upgraded her to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000084ERH">Nylabone Galileo Bone Dog Chew Toy, Souper</a> which is very durable, but has some if it's own drawbacks (mainly it is very hard plastic as noted in my review of that product).<br /><br />I was going to give this bone 4 stars, but I guess the fault can rest on my dog. I'll give this 5 stars and recommend it to anyone who things their dog isn't an aggressive chewer. If they are, this won't last very long. The Galileo bone lasts, but is a little too hard. I wish there was a bone similar to this in texture, but a little more durable. But if your dog is a moderate chewer, I'm sure they'll like this bone.<br /><br />Hope this was helpful and that you find the right bone for your four-legged friend!

If your dog will chew on anything with even a slight flavor, these will work out well.

review/summary: better than most
review/text: I like Nylabone products because most, if not all, are made in the USA.  After all the recent scares with dog products, I at least hope that the products made in the US are safe.  This company has been around for a while and is recommended by my vet.<br />I have an extremely hard time finding something that will last beyond a day or two for my black lab.  Even though I buy products that say they are for aggressive chewers, they never last long.  This one seems to have lasted a tad longer.  Not as long as I wish, but certainly more than some others I have purchased.  It is the right length for my dog to grab and hold too.<br />If anyone out there knows of a product for a strong chewer that can last a long time...I'd love to know.

review/summary: Great for Power Chewers!
review/text: My Pit bull loves them! She is an extreme power chewer and they last about a month with her, then her Chihuahua sister steals them once they become smaller for her to chew on :-) It's so much more reasonable than all the money I was originally spending on bully sticks. I still keep them around but more so as treats since I now have something else to occupy her on a daily basis. They help keep her out of trouble and she's not destroying all the other toys in the house to satisfy her teething urges.

review/text: My 22 lb Frengle (half Beagle, half French Bulldog) will devour almost anything rawhide or "gummy" like the other nylabones.  This one is perfect... he chews on the bone for at least an hour a day and it doesn't wear down much.  I've also purchased the cylinder shaped hollow bones which are just way too heavy and dent my floors... these can be dropped from couch height and they're light enough where they do no damage.  I will buy no other dog bone (besides the bacon flavored version of this).

review/text: Nylabones have long been my favorite chew toys for my big German Shepherds. The dogs love them, they last a long time and don't make a mess on my carpets. If my dogs take them outside, they can be washed and reused. The souper size is great for big, strong dogs and last several months even with daily chewing. I highly recommend Nylabone durable products. These are a bargain because they last so long and Amazon's price is the best anywhere, even over pet supply discount sites.

It's his absolute favorite toy, and hasn't lost any of its appeal in months!  We had tried giving our dog rawhides and bully sticks and all kinds of other things, which all gave him diarrhea.

review/summary: durable..for a normal chewer
review/text: i bought this product for my two dogs, a pomchi & a minpin/chihuahua mix. i got it mainly for the minpin because she was chewing up all the wood in the backyard. i got the bacon and chicken flavor and hoped to heaven that they wouldn't reject the toys. my pomchi isn't much of a chewer, but i would find her under my bed chewing it once in a while. hardly made a dent in the bone. the minpin however is a BEAST at chewing. after 3 days with her nylabone, there was severe wear on one end. after a little less than a month, both ends of her bone have been pretty much destroyed. don't get me wrong, its a great product and it can withstand normal chewing, but this one in particular is not durable enough to stand the jaws of my monster minpin. but she really enjoys it, and i'll keep searching to the perfect nylabone that can hold up to her powerful chewing habits!

review/summary: Ok, but a little too soft for our dogs
review/text: I don't know what it is about the white colored nylabone material; it is just so much softer than the yellowish material. Even though both are labeled "Dura Chew" The dogs have not yet taken off sizeable pieces of this bone, but they can leave pretty clear tooth markings. This chew needs closer monitoring than the other nylabones we have bought.<br /><br />*************<br />UPDATE: It is a little more than a year since I first put up this review and I just bought a liver flavored Nylabone that is also made from this white colored material. I'm uploading a customer photo to show the difference. If you have a dog that is an agressive chewer, you may want to stay away from the white nylabone material.

review/summary: Safe and durable!
review/text: I buy these bones for my dogs to chew on and play with when outside, unsupervised.  They are durable enough that pieces don't break off and there is minimal risk of choking.  They seem to last forever but are soft enough that the dogs want to chew on them.  I bought the largest size because I have medium and large sized dogs.  That also minimizes risk of choke and/or other injury.  They are also easy to spot in the yard when mowing the grass.  If you do accidentally run one over, they break or splinter and leave sharp edges.  I would remove them from your dogs yard in that event.  Otherwise, the dogs seem to like them (are willing to pick them up, take them from you, and carry them around) and chew on them quite often.  They are great for mildly interactive toys but do not provide a lot of exercise - other than chewing.  Good "keep your dog busy so you can get stuff done" toys!  :)

review/summary: Good product but I was expecting the Wolf size to be bigger
review/text: The product is very good.  It is the type of bone I was planning to get for my dogs.  They don't seem to chew on it much.  I am not sure why, they both love to chew and have chewed on the previous nylabone dura chews.  I love the fact that this product lasts so long and it is hard for them to destroy.<br /><br />When I ordered the product I couldn't find what size the Wolf bone was - dimensions ect.  I just assumed that wolves are fairly large animals so this bone must the the same size as the long one I purchased last year.  I was wrong.  Wolf is the medium size as far as I can tell.  There is nothing wrong with the product.  I just wish that the size would have been a little more clear when I ordered it.

review/text: My 60-lb golden/lab mix loves these bones -- but only the chicken flavor. She wouldn't touch the liver or "original." She's the first dog I've ever had that likes these really hard bones. She's done a good job of chewing down both ends over a period of a year or so, and I've already got a replacement for when the little knobs are completely gone. For now, they are nice and rough and probably scour a lot of tartar off when she gnaws on them.

review/summary: My dog loves it
review/text: Rusty is a 60 pound American Dingo mix with jaws like an alligator. He's an extremely powerful chewer who quickly destroys most toys, but not his Nylabones (we have several). I hope everybody who buys one of these heeds the warning on the label: toss it when they chew through the thick knuckle end so large sharp pieces don't break off. The Nylabones last for a long time until the knuckle is chewed away, so it's not worth a short time of extra use to risk our dog's life and health.<br /><br />Besides the Nylabone, we give Rusty raw cow shank and knuckle bones or raw turkey or chicken wings and necks as daily treats*. He's 4+ years old, but his teeth and gums look sparkly clean and healthy and his breath is sweet.<br /><br />* NOT COOKED, cooked bones splinter, raw bones don't. Dogs' digestive system can handle bacteria found on raw meat, not to mention the bacteria on cat poop, rotting carcasses, and whatever other disgusting things they eat. Gotta love them!

She's a very aggressive chewer and will rip everything else to pieces within minutes but this is the only thing that lasts.<br /><br />Definitely recommend this toy and a frozen Kong for your dog's chewing habits! The ONLY downside is that the plastic gets a little pokey-stabby after it's been through some tough love.

review/summary: Great New Kool-Aid Flavour
review/text: Peach Mango seems to be the liquid flavor trend as of late. I'm seeing this combination regularly now when just a few years ago it was almost unheard of. Now Kool-Aid has jumped on the bandwagon. My wife loves Kool-Aid and Peach anything (I wish she had gotten to try Peach Twizzlers Pull N Peel when they were around). I on the other hand am not a fan of artifical sweetners or fruit flavoured products that are mostly long polysyllabic chemical compounds disguised as food. So I wasn't expecting to like this.<br /><br />Imagine my surprised when we both loved it. We finished off a pitcher quickly and really could taste both peach and mango flavors, even though there was none of either in this mix. Even better, there is no high fructose corn syrup in the mix! Yes, there are artificial colors and flavors but the fact this had no HFCS or asparatine was a double win in my book. One glass is only sixty calories, has 18 grams of sugar and even a smattering of vitamins C & E. Not bad.<br /><br />The only real problem is that Peach Mango Kool-Aid seems to be exceptionally hard to find. No supermarket in the DC metro area seems to carry this. It's definitely the first time since Ecto-Cooler where I can honestly say I have a KJool-Aid craving.

review/summary: Hey, It's Kool-Aid...
review/text: What can you really say about Kool-Aid. It's basically flavored sugar water. Definitely not something you'd want to drink or serve your kids everyday, but every now and then it is ok, I suppose.<br /><br />This is actually the first time in over 10 years that we have even had Kool-Aid or any similar sugary juice drink in our home. I just try to stay away from these types of products in general. It was nice to have something different on hand.<br /><br />This drink is definitely sweet and if you try to use less mix, well, it is just less mix and doesn't taste very well. Overall the flavor is pretty good if you like peach mango flavors in general. It isn't a natural taste of course..it definitely has that artificial Kool-Aid taste to it, but tastes good anyway.<br /><br />If I was in the habit of buying these types of juices/mixes, it is one that I would buy based on the flavor alone. We tend to stick to milk, water, orange juice, cranberry juice etc though - all the  boring stuff :/<br /><br />It mixes up quickly and fully dissolves. You can mix up a single serving or a whole pitcher, so it is pretty convenient to have on hand.

And Peach Mango?<br /><br />Well, in terms of convenience, this kind of Kool Aid is the wave of the future, compared to mixing scads of sugar with a packet of Kool Aid in a two-quart container. Like Tang, it mixes really easy, and it doesn't separate unless you leave a mixed cup of it out for a long time.<br /><br />In terms of flavor, though... I don't know if it's the sweetener that Kool Aid is using in this product, but it tastes a lot like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XOMHV0">Crystal Light On The Go Metabolism Plus Green Tea Peach Mango</a> (without the flecks of green tea). It's got kind of a diet taste to it, and upping the amount of powder you use just makes it sweeter, rather than having a more robust flavor. Even Tang gets more orange if you add more powder!<br /><br />Kool Aid Man isn't busting through anything over this flavor, that's for sure.

review/summary: Awesome Fruity Kool-Aid!
review/text: One, I like Kool-Aid. Two, I like fruity drinks. Three, I love this Kool-Aid. It's sweet enough without being cloying and it's fruity enough to be light and refreshing when you want something other than water but not as sugary as soda. As to the flavour of this Kool-Aid it's definitely more mango-y than peachy in my opinion. I also needed to use a bit more powder than the recommended amount to get what I would consider a fully flavoured drink instead of just mildly flavoured water, however that's not that unusual with Kool-Aid. (Except for maybe the Fruit Punch flavor. I can usually use a bit less of that than recommended.)<br /><br />Overall, I do enjoy this flavour and would definitely buy it again.
