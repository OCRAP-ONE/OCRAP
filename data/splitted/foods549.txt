review/text: This item came package very nicely, and it was a relatively fast delivery. However, I will say that--as much as I love this product--the product is a little bland. It would take a bit before I could actually start to taste the cracker flavoring.

review/summary: Great Sardines
review/text: I just got these today, and let me tell you, these are good sardines!  I don't notice the lemon a lot, but it may be cutting the fishy taste of the sardines.  The "lightly smoked" may also be helping with that.  Whatever it is, these are really good eating!<br /><br />I previously reviewed the Roland sardines, and while they are ok, they aren't in the same class as these.

review/summary: Good product - but clueless vendors' shipping charges. ???
review/text: The texture and taste of this syrup is much more enjoyable than most other watery, flavorless, sugarless concoctions that many manufacturers are passing off at premium prices.  If you've tasted the original Mrs. Butterworth's, and liked it, this is the one and only sugar-free alternative that is likely to become your favorite.<br /><br />However...<br /><br />The ridiculous shipping charges, that the third-party Amazon vendors are asking, is excuse enough to go elsewhere to make your purchase.  This is now a stable and popular grocery item that is widely available for well under $5.00.  Your favorite, local, grocery mart probably has it.

review/summary: Better than pasta made from regular wheat flour!
review/text: I just could not believe how absolutely delicious this pasta is. It was perfect in texture and it just tastes fantastic. I don't know why the reviewer's pasta turned out gummy, but mine had no problems. I don't look at it as a substitute for regular pasta. I actually like this BETTER, there are no down sides to it at all. It doesn't stick together like regular pasta either, or to the bottom of the pan. Einkorn flour dissolves quickly unlike dwarf wheat (regular) flour and the products made from it are less sticky too.<br />Try it, I promise you will like it!

review/text: I have fed Nature's Variety Prairie cat food for 4 years.  I go between Salmon and Chicken flavors.  I have a maine coon, which have long hair. Before, I used various brands which left her with matted hair and lumpy hairballs on her coat that would not brush out.  I tried Prairie and all of her problems went away in 2 weeks feeding.  Now her coat is soft, smooth, silky and it is very easy to brush her now.

review/text: I'm stunned.

I recently bought a bag of Prairie and added a little to the Chicken Meal Instinct kibble  and my one cat pawed at the bowl like it needed to be buried and the other one picked out the Prairie.<br /><br />What's in Prairie that's not in the other kibble formulas Nature's Variety makes? Could it be some cats are put off by grains? I know I've got smart cats, but beat me with a feather if they purposely walk away from dinner with grains!

It is coffee-esque. So it's a nice brisk (but not too brisk) morning tea.<br /><br />I like to pair the citrus with green tea for a hint of fruity, and boost of energizing tea. For $7, these tea leaves can't be beat. And they are strong enough to yield several servings from one scoop.

It is very important to make sure the water is boiling prior to putting in the pasta.

I find this pasta to be the only one that seems to taste like regular wheat pasta.  My husband and son do not have Celiac and they don't even notice that they are eating gluten free pasta.

Alas, in a move to "measure like sugar," the manufacturers have bulked it out significantly more with, apparently, cornstarch.  Worse, you can actually TASTE the bulking agent, and it tastes obtrusive and peculiar.  I will no longer be buying this product.

Having little choice (questerionable store brand vs. Splenda), I figured I'd give Splenda a try.  Did not like it at all.  Too sweet and with a definite artificial taste that isn't present in Equal. I'm sticking with Equal.  Ordering from Amazon is so easy and, while I didn't really plan to order an 8-pack, I guess I won't have to hunt it down in the stores for a long time.

I know another reviewer complained about them being flavorless, but I couldn't disagree more! I can make a cup of coffee that rivals anything you could buy in any coffee house! Be sure to roast them past 2nd crack and let the beans degas for 12-24 hours after you roast them or it will taste like you made a cup of coffee out of grass clippings. But if you roast them right, they make a delicious cup of coffee!

It would be nice if the package included a "key" of some sort, and if you're buying for a picky eater or someone with food allergies, this could be a risky pick.<br /><br />The flavors we tasted were all subtle and delicious, though, and included:<br />-very dark chocolate with light, crispy chocolate nibs<br />-a smooth, lighter chocolate with a creamy hazelnut filling<br />-a maple chocolate - better than you would think, without an overpowering maple flavor<br />-a creamy, chocolate-covered caramel<br />-a smooth, mild peanut butter truffle<br /><br />All in all, there were about 70 large-sized, beautifully wrapped candies, and not a single one we didn't like.  They are an amazing treat, as long as you don't mind the surprise of not knowing which flavor you might unwrap!

review/summary: Drastic Price Increase
review/text: Plenty has been said about how delicious Kirkland Premium Choolates are; and I fully agree. However-I question the drastic price increase from $19.99- in Dec. to $49.99 in Feb.! Aside from the increase being ridiculous and disappointing-I had to check around to be sure I wasn't hallucinating! What caused this, besides obvious greed, to me. I won't be ordering them anytime soon,nor for a very, very long time at this price![They may be being sold by a private party...now; originally purchased thru Amazon].

I'm going back there next week to buy some more it is a great gift to give.

review/summary: A very tasty selection of chocolates - YUMM!!!
review/text: This a very nice selection of chocolates from all over the world.  There are 8 different types of candy in the jar (I am attaching a photo shows 4 of them which are representative). They look attractive and taste great! Most candies are rich  milk chocolate with differently flavored ganache inside the hard chocolate shell. Several of them have the rich chocolate ganache infused bit of different nuts. My favorites are the ones that use hazelnut. One of candies has ganache which has has a nice coffee flavor, another has a strong peanut flavor.<br /><br />Even though normally I prefer dark chocolate, I found that I really like this collection of chocolates and bought this jar many times at a local Costco store.  Costo prices this jar at 9.99 and brings out in the fall. This jar makes a nice option for Halloween and a nice yet inexpensive present at Christmas. I have used this jar at Yankee swap at work, and it was a big hit!<br /><br />Ali Julia review

review/text: Until this year, these chocolates were the best.  Kirkland (Costco) has substitutes most of the chocolates with cheaper chocolates.  These are not gourmet chocolates anymore. I won't be buying these anymore.  The countries listed need to be revised.  United States is now one of the chocolate producers.  I'm guessing they are the cheaper, less tasty ones.  Oddly, Switzerland chocolates are last on the list, or the least amount you will get.<br />P.S.  These are only $9.99 at Costco.

review/summary: Great Product for coconut water fans!
review/text: I'm very active and a huge fan of coconut water and drink 1 or 2 cans a day (sometimes more).  I'm definitely aware of the carbon footprint that I'm leaving as I contribute to shipping coconut water around the world.  But for me, nothing beats coconut water when exercising or when i first wake up in the morning.... I admit my addiction.  I LOVE COCONUT WATER!!!<br /><br />A friend of mine told me about CocoHydro and i was skeptical at first.  I read about it on their website, it seemed like a noble idea coming from a good company, so I decided to order it.  To my surprise, I really like it!  I would have ordered the Original flavor, yet Amazon was out of stock (i've backordered), so I ordered the Pineapple.  It is really good!  Pretty authentic flavor and I can definitely feel it hydrating my body.  It's in my water bottle when I'm on my bike and it works great!  I do look forward to trying the Original flavor, as that will be the determining factor for my ultimate opinion on this product.<br /><br />I do add more of the powder than is recommended on the instructions, as i like a stronger flavor.  I also add a pinch of salt, as I like more salt when I exercise.<br /><br />This is definitely going to be a staple in my kitchen and water bottle!  Its much cheaper than buying cans of coconut water.<br /><br />While nothing beats a fresh coconut cracked open, sitting on the beach of Costa Rica, waiting for the perfect wave to come in, this is a great alternative for us coconut water addicts in North America.<br /><br />I support it.

review/summary: Use a lot, and try mixing into other drinks
review/text: Good for rehydrating after a workout. The taste of the powder isn't very strong, so if you're looking for something with significant flavor, you'll have to use a lot. Two heaping spoonfuls for a full glass of water is what I'll use. The pineapple flavor tastes like faintly sweetened pineapple, not like coconut water, so if you like the taste of coconut water and that's what you're looking for, I'd get the original flavor instead. For a flavor blast, try mixing this into orange juice. It's DELICIOUS.

review/text: I had high hopes for this product having read other reviews.  I was disappointed.  It didn't seem to "sweeten" my baked goods.  It had a weird bitter taste that I did not like.  As far as baking with it, my baked goods came out looking great, but not tasting as sweet as I wanted them to.  Also, the product does not measure cup for cup to sugar so you need to use more.  For one cup of sugar, you need to use 1.75 cups of Just Like Sugar.  So product is used fast, it is expensive, and not readily available like other sweeteners.

review/summary: Better than sugar in just about every way.
review/text: I use Just Like Sugar in baking and to sweeten my coffee and tea.  There is not the overwhelming sweetness of sucrose here, but it's to be expected and I'm not surprised by it.  I actually prefer a milder level of sweetness, and this product perfectly sweetened my homemade brownies, a wonderful compliment to the unsweetened chocolate I used.  I will use the white baking Just Like Sugar in all of my recipes, but avoid the Brown variety whose acrid aftertaste I could not tolerate.  The white is a winner, and so powdery fine that I don't need to put in a blender so that it will properly dissolve in mixtures, as I've had to do with other sugar substitutes on the market.  No digestive concerns noted.  The fiber in this sugar seems to be well tolerated. Will definitely be purchasing more.

Upon contacting them, Customer Service of the Vendor reacted immediately; they sent me the brown sugar and a pre-paid envelope with which to return the extra baking product.  I cannot comment on the product--haven't used it yet; but I can definitely vouch for the fact that this company is responsive.<br /><br />I thought the price was a bit high and a 9 dollar shipping charge was excessive for A three pound shipment--but, Hey, the proof is in the pudding.  I don't mind the price if it is as good as it claims to be (I tasted a bit of the brown sugar when it arrived and it certainly had the flavor).  I am going to use this product extensively and then I will comment on its quality.

review/summary: DID I FORGET TO MENTION? -- IT TASTES GOOD TOO!!!
review/text: "Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ" is one of the healthiest and tastiest foods you have available at your local grocery. When you read the label, you see a lot of nutrition and few calories for just 2 tablespoons. But much of what wheat germ has is not on the label. For instance, it promotes gentle regularity and is an excellent source of chromium, selenium, and other trace minerals. It is also a balanced package of protein, carbohydrates and fat, without saturated fat. It promotes heart health and provides an energetic feeling. Mixed with vitamin C, some people use it as a very effective antihistamine without side effects.<br /><br />Since 1982, I have incorporated "Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ" into my daily diet. The easiest ways to achieve this are as follows:<br /><br />1] Adding to cold cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, soups, homemade bread, puddings, macaroni and cheese, applesauce and literally anything you want that has sufficient moisture.<br /><br />2] Substituting wheat germ for bread crumbs in meatloaf, veal/ chicken cutlets, or any fried batter.<br /><br />Kretschmer's Wheat Germ comes toasted in a vacuum-sealed bottle which makes it a very stable and fresh product. It even has an expiration date printed across the top of the bottle in plain sight. Raw wheat germ from the health food store tastes awful, turns rancid sometimes before you buy it, and is usually poorly packaged.<br /><br />This "Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ" gets a 5 for nutrition, ease of use, packaging, and value which makes Kretschmer's Wheat Germ hard to beat. Oh, I forget to mention --IT TASTES GOOD TOO!<br /><br />DOWNSIDE: This 12 ounce package costs only $1.00 less than the 20-ounce package and should be passed by when the 20-ounce size is available. Sometimes the 20-ounce size is out of stock or absent from store shelves so check first.

review/summary: Not for sensitive stomachs
review/text: Our husky began teething, and we decided we needed to get her something to chew on apart from socks, underwear, and furniture as all of these were apparently more interesting than her toys. Embedded flavor seemed like it would be great to keep her interest, and it did. We supervised her carefully and she never broke off pieces larger than a grain of rice. Diarrhea was an almost immediate result and took her 3 days to recover. While the product itself seems great (she loved it, it kept her busy, and was fairly durable), it's definitely not something to give to a dog with a sensitive tummy.

review/summary: Perfectly Mellow Tea
review/text: I lived in Japan for 4 years so perhaps I was predisposed to like this sort of thing, but after trying it once at a Japanese restaurant, I was hook.  I recently found this product and recommend it highly.<br /><br />One teabag makes a large pitch of this pleasant, mild tea.  It's taste reminds me a bit of Sugar Smacks without the sugar, or even Sheerios.  Doesn't sound like a good taste for tea you say?  Well, you'd be suprised.  A co-worker who tasted it said it reminds her of coffee, which I can see too.<br /><br />Recent studies have shown it has many health benefits, including the ability to improve the fludity of the blood.  I'm not sure how that translates into overall well being, but I know that drinking it makes me feel healthy, and I enjoy the flavor.  It may not be everyone's cup of tea (sorry, had to), but it is worth trying at least once I'd say.  I have a container at work and I sip iced Barley tea throughout the day.

review/summary: Healthy, natural, great-tasting caffeine free tea
review/text: The idea of boiling grain to make a tea never occurred to me.  Surprisingly in Seoul, many restaurants serve barley tea, called bori-cha as their standard free beverage.  Most of my Korean colleagues love it.  It is a kind of cultural icon.  Growing up with Honey nut Cheerios, I assumed that barley needs honey, so I added honey to my barley tea and it is to die for.  My Korean colleagues consider this sacrilege, but I still recommend it.<br /><br />Barley tea is also popular in Japan and Ecuador.  Apparently, we are behind in the discovery of this wonderful tea.<br /><br />The taste of barley tea is a bit like regular tea, say Lipton, but softer.  Most importantly for me, this tea is healthy and natural.  I don't drink coffee, black or green tea for health and personal reasons.  Tea made from barley is healthy, refreshing and enjoyable.  You must try some.

The teabags are pitcher-sized, so all you have to do is drop it in a pitcher of water and refrigerate it overnight, and you're done. (Use filtered water -- it makes a big difference.) I like it plain and think it tastes slightly sweet by itself, but I know people like to add sugar to it, too. Since it's caffeine free and calorie free and really refreshing when cold, it makes a great alternative to plain water for staying hydrated in the summer. I keep boxes of this stuff in my pantry all summer. My local Asian Supermarket also carries this product.

review/summary: Great morning coffee replacement!
review/text: This is just how I remember drinking barley tea for the first time in Shinjuku, Japan. This tea tastes just as great and brings back memories for me. It has a toasty nuttiness flavor, similar to dandelion tea but more light and refreshing. Says you can steep in cold water, but I enjoy it by putting one tea bag in my coffee maker and brewing it that way. Makes a wonderful morning coffee replacement. Individual tea bags are larger than normal, each making 1 qt of tea (equivalent to 4 cups or 2 water bottles). I drink lots of healthy tea (moringa, dandelion, green tea, white tea, oolong), and this one of my favorites!<br /><br />I find placing one tea bag into my coffemaker is so convenient for me as it is enough to fill a 10 cup carafe with strong flavor within minutes (not watered down and faster than cold steeping). For any left over hot tea, I let it cool down to room temperature and place it in the fridge for a refreshing drink anytime. My highest recommendation for this tea is using clean, great tasting water as it really makes a difference.<br /><br />I only see one ingredient listed on the box: Barley. Manufactured by House Foods Corp in Tokyo, Japan. Hope this helps.

review/summary: Yum!!
review/text: After having a great experience with barley tea, I figured that I needed to find some bags to brew up my own tea. (It'd be cheaper, that's for sure.) What initially drew me to this brand was that the instructions are in English, which is something that is not guaranteed with each brand out there on Amazon. If you are new to brewing, this is will be easy for you to understand.<br /><br />The teabags are sealed up in foil packets, with many bags in one packet, so depending on how long you'll go between usages you might want to put the remaining bags in the foil packet in a ziplock. (I know that some are especially sensitive to the difference in taste that comes from teabag containers being left open.) Each bag can be used to make 1 quart of tea.<br /><br />This tastes pretty good and I loved how easy it was to make. You can either brew it with hot water or leave it in the refridgerator to brew in cold water. It's rather fast when it comes to steeping, so I was able to enjoy the tea after a few hours in the fridge.<br /><br />I'm absolutely going to purchase this again when I head back to my local Asian food market.

review/text: I am not, repeat, a tea drinker.  My youngest son talked me into trying some Mugicha Tea at our Family Christmas get-to-gether.  I fell in love with it imediately.  We had a quart of the tea with sugar.  He adds way too much sugar, but the flavor was great.  He had made two quarts of non-sweetened which I tried last.  Result:  Just as great and also left no aftertaste.  It was soothing, and quenching.  I will be ordering this from my local store once I find the one that carries it.  Again, GREAT DRINK.
