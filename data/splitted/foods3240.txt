review/text: this is authentic Thai curry. My partner(American) like this flavor the best. The 10 oz. pouch has lots of potato with mild thai yellow curry in coconut sauce. It is creamy with some what spicy sauce. It is vegetarian, but meat can be add for a hearty meal.  We eat it with white rice. One pouch is enough for one, or  two small portions. Very easy to prepare, just heat and serve.

review/text: I bought this sauce hoping to recreate a local Thai restaurant's dish. Taste is pretty good but I kind of assumed the package was sauce only. It contains potatoes which almost makes it little more than a single serving. I would have preferred just sauce to add my own local potatoes.

review/summary: Extremely delicious-- the best sweet barbecue sauce I've ever had
review/text: I am not a bona fide cook, nor am I a barbecue expert. Most of my sampling of authentic down-south barbecues has happened on business trips, and I've sampled most of the types of barbecue sauces available at the local grocery stores. I happened to luck on this one at the grocery store the other day when shopping for something that wouldn't be too spicy for the chillun. We brought it home that night and used it to dunk pieces of chicken, and I was blown away.<br /><br />I am at a bit of a loss as to how to describe the flavor. It is sweet and tangy, and slightly spicy but just enough to be pleasant-- I don't think people with even sensitive palates would dislike this sauce. In a way, though of course they have some different ingredients, this is like a much more refined, more delicious version of the Sweet Chili chicken nugget sauce from McDonald's, which we also like. (No, this is not the creme de la creme of food connoisseur reviews, but you knew that going in.)<br /><br />The ingredient list on my bottle includes these items in order: water, vinegar, sugar, tomato paste, molasses, and honey, with less than 2% of salt, aged cayenne pepper, natural smoke flavor, modified food starch, dextrose, spice, corn syrup, caramel color, garlic, xanthan gum, onion, sodium benzoate as a preservative, maltodextrin, tamarind, autolyzed yeast extract, and natural flavor. Ingredients may of course change over time, so make sure to read the ingredients on whatever you buy.<br /><br />I've only used it for dipping, not actual barbecue. As a grilling sauce I'd say it's ever so slightly on the thinner side of normal, possibly due to vinegar content, but would still work for grilling, especially with extra basting.<br /><br />ETA: During the writing of this review, I had to go heat up some chicken so I could have some of this sauce.  Mmmmmm.

review/summary: Lots of okay matcha for amazing price
review/text: Matcha comes in many different grades. Make no mistake, you are not going to get a full pound of high-quality matcha for less than several hundred dollars.<br />This is not matcha for drinking; it is matcha for cooking, baking, and even adventurously powdering breakfast cereal and ice cream with. If you want the stuff used in a Japanese tea ceremony, plan to pay a minimum of a dollar a gram, but if you want a lot of decent matcha for other purposes at a good price, this is it.

review/summary: Culinary teas bulk matcha vs. "tea ceremony quality" matcha
review/text: I am new to matcha drinking, so was somewhat concerned re: customer comments Culinary Teas matcha being "brown" (i.e. a not the correct bright green color). I had only tried Starbucks Matcha (PLEASE BE ADVISED - it is very tasty, but probably because the number one ingredient on the label is sugar). Also, a pound of Starbucks Matcha (as sold on a popular auction site) costs about the same as a pound of Culinary Teas bulk Matcha)...so you are getting far less of the expensive and healthful green tea powder and more sugar (the Starbucks product is somehow micronized so it does mix into solution much easier than a less processed pure tea powder). The teaspoon on the right is Teavana (at $16 for 30 grams - thats 2 Tbsp) they said it was the highest "tea ceremony" quality matcha. The teaspoon on the left is the bulk (1 lb, silver bag) CT product. Photo taken without a flash and not retouched so actual colors show. CT matcha  is slightly less brilliant green. I mixed exact quantities (1/2 tsp) of matcha in 8 oz of liquid with exact quantities of sweetener (a blend of xylitol and stevia that I am experimenting with). The CT matcha tastes slightly less "green" and slightly more bitter than the Teavana, but I did the math ( a pound of CT would cost $240 at the Teavana $16 per 30 g cost) - so I am very happy with my CT purchase. Will use the smaller container for my "working" supply, freeze the rest and use as needed. Am finding Matcha to be a great substitute for my "too much coffee" habit and prefer the less instantaneous (but prolonged) energy boost it gives - not too mention alkalizing instead of acidifying, ECGC, and possible metabolism boosting effect.<br />PS Most Starbucks barristas do not know the Matcha powder contains sugar, so they will tell you the are not adding any. As consumers, we need to ask companies to STOP ADDING SUGAR (in whatever processed form it takes) to everything they make.

review/summary: Not great matcha, but for the price it's good for everyday use
review/text: It tastes good enough and is affordable enough to use every day. It's not sweet and super bright, almost-neon green like medium and high grade matcha, but it's not bitter, unpleasant, stale, and brownish like Malden's similarly priced matcha. It is only slightly more expensive than Malden's matcha ($3.40/oz. or $2.62/oz. in bulk vs. Malden's $2.50/oz) but the quality is superior. I highly recommend this as an overall good mathca at a really good price.<br /><br />If this is the first matcha you try you won't be disappointed. But if you're not impressed with the taste keep in mind that the next step up in quality available through Amazon is at around $10/oz (ex. DoMatcha's 2nd Harvest).

review/summary: Green tea powder for life!
review/text: At first glance it may seem that this product is somewhat expensive--$30+ for tea, right? But a pound of green tea powder is A LOT!!! For a 6 oz cup of tea or most other uses you only need to use about a half a teaspoon or things get a little strong and murky. But I add it to everything--my morning protein shake, yogurt, Gatorade for the gym, etc., etc. and still I have yet to make a dent in the bag. I have also looked at green tea powder at places like Whole Foods and Asian super markets, and this is a really good deal in comparison. So buy some and enjoy!

review/summary: You get what you pay for - Quality worth every penny spent
review/text: This product is everything you would expect, and then some. The shipping was fast. The Matcha is sent in a resealable, heavy-duty FOILED plastic bag, EXCELLENT quality. I recommend using a small tin for everyday use, taking no more than an ounce or two from the larger bag, to preserve the flavor and freshness.<br /><br />The taste is WONDERFUL. Very fresh, very green, very subtle, yet intense.<br />I purchased this product after Starbucks raised their prices (again!), because I had become a frozen green tea frappucino addict...Now I am just a Matcha addict.<br /><br />I love it in the evening warm, in a large mug with a good splash of milk, and simply adore it from the blender with milk, ice cubes, some vanilla syrup and a splash of whipping cream for the frothy, creamy taste...<br /><br />I use 2 level teaspoons, not packed, to a 20 oz. mug, so figure 1 teaspoon per "regular" coffee cup.<br /><br />The illustrative picture is what your matcha will look like. None of the other vendors show the color/quality of their product...For something like this, being able to see what you will get is half the issue. I can tell you that the flavor, which is the other half, is also the quality you would expect and wish for.

review/summary: Good but not quite starbucks
review/text: I bought this item based on the good reviews it got and for the price. I think this is a product that is more useful in baking than a hot tea - it seems to require a lot of careful mixing that is too much hassle for a quick cuppa. It was green and not brown like one of the reviews here stated. I just bought an ice cream maker and am planning to use it for that or just to add to my morning smoothie for a boost. I recently got a bag of the Starbucks version that is mixed with sugar and it blends very easily with hot water. They don't sell it in their stores in powder form like you can buy coffee, but I know enough people in the Starbucks biz to get it on a regular basis. I think I will stick with that version for a hot tea, but I think this 1lb bag is good value for my baking purposes. Hopefully the ice cream will be as good as I want it to be!

If you want cooking, smoothie or food grade matcha at an affordable price, ten this is the stuff. It is not brown. It is green.  Bright green no, but green.  Considering the price, the quick delivery and if you want to be able to afford to drink this at least twice a day, this is perfect.  No complaints.

review/text: Fast shipping, quality product in durable bag with ziplock. Good quantity and cheap. Good taste. The only drawbacks is that product is really difficult to dissolve. I like to make mine with vanilla soy milk, but I always have to stir out the powder in a small quantity of boiling water before adding the soy milk and then microwaving or steeming it. It still does not dissolve completely. Also this is a problem because green tea should be made with water that is about 60 degrees to preserve the best taste...  I would like for the color to be more like the color in the photo, but it is a much more muddy green color. Not like starbucks...but maybe that means it is more natural - I dunno.

The matcha came in neatly packaged with a note from the company who makes it.<br />Secondly, the first thing I did was to make a cold cinnamon matcha smoothie with 2% milk. It was delicious! The matcha is a deep green color and had a very fine grain, there was hardly a difference between this and ridiculously expensive "ceremonial grade" matcha. This matcha, as long as it is properly sifted and mixed properly, will make beautiful drinks.<br /><br />I will definitely be ordering more of this when I run out but that won't be for a while- I ordered the 8oz bag. :)<br /><br />I can't wait to make matcha sugar cookies, and mocha cupcakes with matcha frosting.

review/text: The matcha green tea powder had a great color too it. The packaging was in a large, sealed reflective foil bag with a label showing the manufacture's nutrition information. (Note: The bag was not resealable, so make sure you have a container to store it in after opening.)<br /><br />The tea itself was a nice green color, very close to what is pictured in the description. I did not find it having a brownish tint at all, unlike some of the reviews that I have seen on here. It was all green. I could not find a better price for 8 oz. of matcha tea powder.<br /><br />I personally started drinking matcha tea recently so I cannot determine how much better or worse it is compared to other brands. I do, however, have to say that I love the taste of this tea. I drink it unsweetened as both hot and iced tea. I also have successfully replicated great smoothie recipes and  an iced latte recipe from my favorite beverage establishments (this stuff has saved me so much $$$ in smoothies that it has already paid for itself.)<br /><br />Overall, I am very satisfied with this product. I was even more impressed with how fast it arrived. I was expecting 7-10 business days for it to be shipped and arrive, but it was at my doorstep in 3 business days!

Because a little goes a long way, it is definitely worth paying a little more $$ for this product...the other ones might be cheaper but you need a lot more in your cup to make a good quality green tea latte.

I purchased this to drink every morning and to use in cooking and frappuccinos.  So far,  it is best for frappuccinos where the flavor is enhanced with plenty of sugar and Mimic Cream (almond, cashew cream substitute).<br />I would not recommend this product.

review/summary: Ok Matcha for the price
review/text: Tried matcha green tea powder for the first time and this one is actually not too bad.  It doesn't taste muddy and I taste the matcha green tea flavor.  So far, I've only tried this with hot water and as an ice tea. I will try it in smoothies next week.  Satisfied with the product and price but the only drawback is the packaging.  I cut a slit on the side and fold it after using, but a lot of the powder came out! So I had to pour it all in a tuber ware. You gotta change the packaging to a zip lock bag or something.  I wanted to order more but in the 16 oz, but the only thing stopping me is that there is a shipping fee AND it's sold by another company, why is that??

review/summary: high shipping, no cute tin, but great product
review/text: Bought to use in a cheesecake recipe that we've been enjoying for a year now using instant powder subsitutes...this is a reasonably-priced nice-sized sample to use. $5 shipping is a bit goofy for a soft 1-oz. packet of powder, but luckily I had a gift certificate. I look forward to trying different recipes with this. Cheesecake tastes good, a lot earthier/more organic now that we have the real matcha. I think I'll try making iced lattes now. Too bad it didn't come in the cute little round tin that they show it in...that was an appealing package but the resealable soft packet is nice too.

It only comes in a silver packaging, with a home-made looking logo on the bag. No Nutritional info, no ingredients. The communication was also very poor. took 2 emails befoe i got a response.

review/summary: Makes a decent diet cola
review/text: I have an iSi Twist and Sparkle Beverage Carbonating System and wanted to make a diet cola.  Most diet cola syrups on the market for home users use splenda and/or acesulfame K which I don't like the taste of.  I'm used to and prefer the aftertaste of aspartame or saccharine.  This was the only extract I could find that was unsweetened so I could try my own sweeteners.  I ordered the cola flavor from Jack's Country Store here on Amazon.<br /><br />I tried making the soda with both erythritol and saccharine (sugar twin).  I couldn't get the sweetness right with erythritol, but the Sugar Twin worked fine.  The extract flavor is between a cola and a rootbeer flavor.  I used the following mix: 3.5 cups water + 1 tsp cola extract + 1/4 cup Sugar Twin (if using erythritol use closer to 1/2 cup) and optionally, juice of a lime to boost the acidity and push the flavor closer to a cola and away from rootbeer.  You could also use a bit less extract and sugar twin, I like it a bit strong.

review/summary: Authentic reliable product
review/text: I won't disagree with other reviewers about the wintergreen. This is an ingredient in authentic root beer and there are flavor notes in the Homebrew extract. That said, this product has been around for at least the past forty years. We used to buy this at Calico Ghost Town and Knotts Berry Farm in the '60s and it has same delicious flavor today. Try the Sarsaparilla or Birch Beer mix if you want a different old-fashioned variety. This stuff is great for flavoring homemade ice cream too.

review/summary: If you got Ginger Beer, consider yourself lucky
review/text: I've been making all kinds of soda for the last 5 years from various concentrates, with a home-made carbonation kit that consists of little more than a tank of CO2, some hoses, a filter and regulator.  I regularly get the Homebrew Root Beer and Homebrew Cola and have tried every other flavor they sell.  For starters, the Ginger Ale (and several others) keeps the essential oils in an alcohol suspension, yet is sold in a plastic bottle.  It doesn't take a chemist to figure out just how stupid that is.  Every bottle I've received has been partially collapsed, bubbled/sticky on the outside and has 'particulate matter' on the inside, due to the volume of alcohol migrating through the plastic.  Same with the Lemon flavor as well - it's been totally revolting.<br /><br />Avoid this - get the Ginger Beer instead of the Ginger Ale, use Koolaid unsweetened mixes for the fruit flavors, and really just use the Homebrew label for the Cola and RootBeer products.  Get any soda concentrate with essential oils in suspension (read: most) from a distributor that uses glass bottles.<br /><br />My Soda Rig:<br />*The Carbonator - fits to 20ounce and 2liter bottles: [....]<br />*Ball Lock Disconnect - connects the Carbonator to the CO2 tank: [....]<br />*5lb or 20lb CO2 tank (get the 20 if you don't need your rig portable) - local beer homebrew or welding store.  Make sure it's food grade.<br />*Dual Gauge CO2 Regulator: [....]<br />*3-6 feet clear tubing with 1/4inch interior diameter.  It only needs to handle 50-60 psi, so it doesn't need to be reinforced.<br /><br />Most of this stuff can be gotten cheap from various local sources or somewhere here on Amazon ([....]).  Once you put it together, you can start carbonating just about anything.

review/summary: Root Beer
review/text: I bought this hoping to make a Root Ber my grandkids would enjoy helping make and drink. We followed the included directions carefully. The resultant root beer was drinkable, but tasted like wintergreen, very strongly. I thought it was OK, but the grandkids wouldn't touch it after one taste. Decent wintergreen soda, but not muck like root beer, although the stuff smells great.

review/text: I ordered this item, and was instead shipped a different item (ginger beer).  There is a difference, and the company that makes this makes both.  However, Amazon's warehouses are too stupid to recognize the difference.  When I politely pointed out to them that they had shipped me the wrong item, they very politely apologized, and promised to send me the right item...whereupon they sent me exactly the same wrong item again.  When I complained again, and asked them to either find the right item, or refund my money, they ignored me.  If you really want ginger ale, you can buy this mix on the Internet from other suppliers.  Don't say I didn't warn you.

review/text: My wife and I are big fans of gummi candies, so I thought I would surprise her with these. The strawberry flavor was great but the texture was more like a jellybean than what we consider a true "gummi" and we weren't fans of the sugar coating which also detracted from the proper gummi texture.<br /><br />The worst part was the $9.29 shipping cost for a $[...] item. I should have been paying more attention, but it's not like Amazon makes an effort to highlight the shipping costs - the cost of the item is in bold red type and the shipping cost is always smaller and in grey.<br /><br />So 3 stars for the candy and 1 star for Euro Food Mart.

review/text: I have been on endless search for healthy natural sugar substitute for a long time.  Even though Stevia is wonderful for sweetening smoothies, beverages and even home made chocolate, it is NO GOOD for baking.<br /><br />Friend suggested I try the Coconut Sugar.  I love the fact that it's organic and detailed research leads me to believe that it's truly natural and beneficial, and experience has proven it does not cause any spike in my blood sugar, thus not irritating my pancreas in the process of digestion.<br /><br />The taste is intriguingly rich and earthy and adds extra flavor to both tea and baked goods.<br />Of course I would recommend consuming with moderation (no excess sweetener is 'good for you'), but as a natural and healthy sweetener, this one seems to belong among the best!

Really, you can drink it with just water.  It tastes like milk, mostly.  Easy to get used to.  I usually put it in milk.<br /><br />Another thing, this is not just for bodybuilding.  I had a nagging shoulder injury for months, after I started taking extra protien, it healed rapidly.  It really does make a difference for soft tissue injuries.<br /><br />I also find that it kills my appetite.  It's 100 calories (180 with milk), but I don't feel like eating anything else for hours.<br /><br />Check the nutrition info, and how well it dissolves; this is the only choice.

review/summary: Better than most
review/text: Pure protein, no sweeteners or flavors but tastes great. It tastes like malted milk w/o the sugar. That most protein powders are sweetened flies in the face of trying to be healthy. You don't need the additives and you certainly don't need to train your body to always crave sweets. The best part is that, without any flavoring added, Jarrow's Whey Protein tastes delicious with plain milk.

review/summary: good stuff
review/text: This stuff tastes a lot like powdered milk, so if you mix it with milk you'll barely taste it. It's not too gloppy, either - give it a good stir and it dissolves easily enough. If you're looking for a protein powder without any artificial sweeteners, this is a good choice.

review/summary: Great taste, Good for lean muscle growth
review/text: This is my go to source of a clean protein. It is comparably low in calories, carbohydrates, and sugars which makes it great for building lean muscle. This is not the supplement to take if you want to bulk up and gain mass. The natural-unflavored version that I always get tastes a lot like milk when mixed with water, and does not have chemicals or artificial sweeteners which a lot of other brands use to make their product taste better. The only complaint I have is that the powder doesn't mix very well with just water, and requires a lot of mixing especially if you follow the recommended amount- which to me seems like too much.

review/summary: Builds muscle? Yes. All natural? Yes. Delicious? Ugh, no!
review/text: I wanted to buy a whey protein that didn't have artificial sweeteners and was all natural. Jarrow makes great products. This whey protein has 17g of protein per scoop. It's sweetened with Erythritol which is a sugar alcohol. It's in small amounts so it shouldn't affect people sensitive to sugar alcohols much. If anyone is wondering, the amount of sugar alcohol from what I understand, can give you gas and laxative effects. It's also sweetened with the sweet leaf stevia/rebiana which is calorie free.<br /><br />My only gripe with it is the taste is horrible! Yes, I chug it down fast, but it tastes and smells like cherry cough medicine!

review/summary: GREAT PRODUCT !
review/text: This is a great product that normally is not available at nutrition stores or discount stores, given that it has NO flavor. The other Whey proteins on the market are either Strawberry, Chocolate, or Vanilla - and make your drink taste nasty. Having the option of no flavor is wonderful, your other ingredients come out of the drink when mixed. Outstanding product and I would highly recommend this to anyone who is actively needing to take protein for dietary or workout purposes.

review/text: I'll admit on the advice of my trainer I was not excited about adding protein shakes to my daily regiment. I was pleasingly surprised by the taste though. It's difficult to get the powder to dissolve in water but mixing it with soy milk and shaking it up did well for me. It also fills me up for a time between meals while providing me the protein I was lacking.

review/text: I started drinking protein shakes about two years ago.  When I went to my doctor he suggested that I drink the Jarrow Formula Whey Protein shakes as they are low in sugar content and high in protein.  Once I tried the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005XH6SD8">Jarrow Formulas Whey Protein, Berry, 2 Pounds</a>I found that I loved the berry taste.  Usually when I try to find this flavor in the stores they are out or don't carry it, but I have had success ordering the berry flavor online at Amazon.  If you like berries, I just know you will like the taste of this shake!

review/summary: mmmm Milkshake
review/text: I got the 1 pound french vanilla flavor. I haven't tried a lot of protein powders but the few that I have had either a very grainy texture, were chalky or just plain unpleasant. Not this powder though. I mixed mine with cold milk and threw it in the bottle shaker. It dissolved easily, no clumps or grainy texture. It tasted like a vanilla milkshake and along the same lines for consistency. There were no hardships trying to choke it down with big gulps.<br /><br />The reason why I gave it four stars instead of 5 is because after I finished it up, it eventually made my stomach hurt a little from the sweetness. But I have a sensitive stomach so it will take a few more shakes before I'm used to it. I might try the unflavored next time but I'll wait and see what my reaction is after I've finished the whole pound. This will definitely be a second time purchase though.

review/summary: Yeach
review/text: Ok, yes, this particular whey protein doesn't contain artificial sweeteners or other stuff you don't want in your diet but it really tastes awful and I haven't found a satisfactory way to dress it up.  I tried putting it in my coffee...it just ruined my normally delicious cup of coffee.  I tried putting it in juice but I had to make the juice (from frozen) really concentrated to make it taste ok..and then it still smells awful.  Jarrows whey may be better than 30 others out there but it's still not good enough to make me happy to take it.  I always like it when other reviewers tell me what's a better option so here's my advice.  Buy a jug of Optimum Nutrition Solid Gold.  It has fake sweeteners which I don't like but it tastes really good in a glass of skim milk! I'll probably throw the rest of this Jarrows whey in the garbage (unless I figure out how to cook with it or something).

review/summary: Sweet Treat!
review/text: I buy every available flavor of these for my grandson as he eats them for snack. They are delicious and a great 'pack and go' treat that is easy for him to eat by himself. They are very easy at his age to manipulate without adult help (he has been eating them since one year, about 6 months now) and very neat so no dribble or clean up issues! They are about the right amount for one fairly hungry little guy or two snacks if he is just needing a little boost. And because they are fruits and vegetables, without any undesirable chemicals added, it is a safe and clean treat! Delightful! We would probably have loved them had we discovered them even earlier...but their utility goes far beyond the 'soft food' stage! He is otherwise eating/chewing all regular food and loves these packets I cut open and recycle!

review/text: I don't have any children - that I know of. These are for me, and they are super yum. But I'm not just draining these pouches all willy-nilly. This is largely a post-workout recovery drink.<br /><br />It's like a little smoothie so you get some yummy fast acting carbohydrates to replenish your glycogen stores, as well as some vitamins from the fruit. Price wise there are cheaper post-workout solutions but you get what you pay for. Plus, these are a fun/awkward conversation starter with that cute girl in the lululemon workout gear. She's all like "ew, why are you eating baby food?" and you're like "I'm not eating baby food, I'm drinking it. I don't have a kid though, seriously. Want to go out sometime? We could get dinner and have adult food."

Now at 15 months she is a pro at eating them straight from the pouch, using the top as a straw. We always make sure we have a couple of these in our diaper bag when we run errands. They're the perfect portable snack! Also love that they are organic and you know EXACTLY what you are feeding your child! Now with our second on the way, we will for sure be buying these for years to come.

review/text: I ordered this product because it was organic and easy when out and about with my baby.  However, we I received my order, one of the pouches I noticed had been punctured and was moldy.  I threw it out thinking it must have been a fluke, however I ended up with another punctured pouch (that wasn't moldy, thank God) because I fed half of it to my baby before I realized it had been punctured.  I was disgusted and concerned that my baby had eaten it.  I went to the companies webpage, found no phone number so I emailed them at a provided email about the packaging issue, and never heard a peep out of them in response to my concern.  I was kind and undemanding, just notifying them of the issue and they didn't even have the courtesy to respond.  I will not purchase Plum organics again.  I will stick to Happy Baby or Sprout.

review/text: I was so excited about discovering these great convenient baby foods.  They didnt have anything like it for my first 2 children.  I started feeding it to my baby at 6 months- she LOVED all of the flavors- however I think she gets most excited about the Blueberry, Pear, & Purple Carrot. (Spinach, Pears, & Peas is a close second).  I noticed at 7 months, she was so excited that she grabbed the pouch from me and started feeding it to herself! Apparently the spoon was slowing her down.  Now at 8 months, I just hand it to her and she takes care of it!  Amazing!  They are more expensive than Gerber baby food, but the convenience is just great for when we are out and about- so its worth it.  I have found babiesrus has them on sale often for $1 a piece. Amazon's price is good with free shipping- but thats if you want to buy 24 of the same kind.  Very happy with Plum Organics!  Highly recommend!

I am happy to say that I have found it in spades in this brand!  The bergamot comes through not only in the aroma but also the taste. (I also really like the color of the box!) This company also makes a "double bergamot" Earl Grey but I actually prefer the regular (this one) to the double. If you have become unhappy with your current Earl Grey, I recommend that you give this one a try.

review/summary: Perhaps Brewing Wrong?
review/text: I find that most (not all) people in North America brew their tea for too long a period.  When I first visited China I was amazed at how quickly after pouring the boiling water into the pot, they poured out the "finished" tea.<br /><br />I recently purchased a Keurig machine and have it perfect for making this tea.  I only drink it iced, perhaps that is the difference?  Two bags in the permanent filters and run through twice (using the large cup setting).  Poured over ice with a bit of milk.  I use Stevia for my sweetener.<br /><br />No bitterness.  Just perfectly brewed aromatic Chai Tea.  With the double spice, it gives my tastebuds the perfect "kick" that I desire.

review/text: This chai has good flavor but needs more black tea leaves to make a fully satisfying cup of tea. It leans on cloves but not overly, to my taste. The Tazo chai has more tea leaves and tastes very good if used properly -- 2 mugs of tea or an extra large mug from each tea bag. I've gotten used to the Stash spicing now (have enjoyed 6 boxes) and like to drink both the Stash and the Tazo (also finished 6 boxes), which I drink straight, in succession, in the morning. Then I switch to decaf Tazo chai which is very good and makes 2 mugs per tea bag.

But this Double Chai Spice has a strange chemical flavor. Tried mixing it with regular black tea because the chai seems to be lacking a tea flavor.  I have tried other brands of chai and have made my own.  There's something off about this - it's got a strongly astringent, bitter flavor.  I wonder if it's because the spices are ground to a powder?  The best chai is made with whole spices.

review/summary: Addictive
review/text: I have never cared for flavored teas.  I'm not sure what made me try this, but I am so glad I did!  It is positively addicting! The aroma is wonderful and it tastes even better than it smells. I have signed up with Amazon's auto-shipment to insure that I will never run out.  Simply delicious!

review/summary: not a strong enough flavor
review/text: I didn't think the flavor was strong or distinctive enough. A pretty inoffensive tea, but after being spoiled by Tazo's Teas, it's hard to look at a tea like this the same way.

review/summary: stash peach tea
review/text: This tea is hard to find so I bought 6 boxes. When you open the packet, the bag smells exactly like fresh peaches. The taste is not masked by other flavors such as cinnamon. It makes wonderful iced tea.

review/text: Stash Premium Chai Spice Black Tea can be hard to find on the local shelves, but is never more than a few clicks away on Amazon! The price is great and delivery is always as promised. Enjoy your tea from Amazon.

review/summary: As a person who has never really liked tea
review/text: this is my drink of choice.  I'm addicted.  I drink 3-4 cups a day simply because nothing else tastes this good.  I've tried other chai-spice teas; none of them compare.  The downside to telling everyone to buy this tea is the prospect that you might actually do it, raising the prices.  You should try it, it's good.
