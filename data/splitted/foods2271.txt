review/summary: Cherry Pie Larabars -- love them!  (and also other flavors)
review/text: I have been on a long quest for "nutrition bars" (or whatever you want to call them) that don't have refined sugar, aren't too sweet (however they're sweetened), don't have soy, and generally don't have extra crud in them. These are perfect!<br /><br />I like the flavor, and I like that the ingredients list is so short: "dates, almonds, and cherries". (200 calories, 5g protein, 5g fiber. See larabar dot com for more.)<br /><br />They are a little bit gooier/processed than I was expecting... I had to check after a taste that there wasn't soy in there gluing everything together. But when I think about fruit leather that makes sense. In some ways, it's like a thick fruit leather with some larger bits of fruit and nuts.<br /><br />But I'm really glad to find them and will be trying more flavors. This is just the sort of bar I was hoping for.<br /><br />Update: My next favorite flavor so far is Chocolate Coconut Chew, which should not be mistaken for a candy bar-type snack, as I feared it might. It's not that sweet and not that chocolately. It's more substantial. Ingredients: "Dates, almonds, walnuts, unsweetened cocoa powder, unsweetened coconut". 240 calories, 5g protein, 5g fiber... and I'm sorry I don't have the energy right now to type the rest. (Ah! But you can get it online if you put a dot com after larabar!)<br /><br />I also like Ginger Snap enough to have bought a box. They are, yes, a little cookie-ish (though with the same gooey consistency as the rest). I do love ginger, but I don't find myself reaching for this flavor and probably won't reorder. Ingredients: "Dates, almonds, pecans, ginger, cinnamon, cloves". 240 calories, 5g protein, 6g fiber.<br /><br />Other flavors I have tried (Note that I prefer less sweet things, although all of them have a dose of sweet)<br />  * Tropical Fruit Tart: I won't get this again; for me this was like a pina colada and not what I want in a food bar (partly, this means it was too sweet for me, but also all the desert-y flavors in that bar)<br />  * Peanut Butter and Jelly: Good, and I imagine I'll add it to my bulk rotation<br />  * Cashew Cookie: Good, and I imagine I'll add it to my bulk rotation<br />  * Lemon Bar: Too desert-y for me. Sweet and lemony.<br /><br />(Looking at the larabar web site, Peanut Butter Cookie has the most protein, with 7g, at 220 calories and with 4g fiber... I haven't been able to get that in my local stores yet, but that will be the next flavor I try.)<br /><br />Update 2: So I have bought a few flavors by the box now... but I'm realizing I wonder why these aren't cheaper here. They are 1.39 individually in my grocery store, and 1.27 a piece by the box at the current subscribe and save price of 20.28. So yes, that's a savings, but possibly not enough to buy in bulk.

review/summary: Great GingerSnap Flavor-- real fruit and nuts with NO JUNK
review/text: These might be the best-tasting bars I've ever tried. They keep pretty well, too, although if you leave them in your car (in the heat) they will lose freshness will get hard quickly. They are great as a meal replacement when you don't have time for lunch and you need to grab something satisfying that won't spike your blood sugar and make you feel sick later on. This is a sustained energy-- I think it's the nuts that help it have a lasting energy feeling. The calories in these is always about 300, which is good for a meal replacement.<br /><br />I really love the ginger snap, which tastes just like a real gingersnap cookie and you can taste the real ginger. Although most Larabars are very delicious, and I can't say I have ever disliked any of them.

review/text: I'm a fan of Larabars and the peanut ones are my second favorite.  All of them have only a few ingredients (less is better) and no preservatives or additives. Although I was quite surprised by the price of a box of 16, which pretty much equals over two bucks a bar.  My local grocery store sells them for one dollar, thirty-nine cents.  The health food store sells them for a dollar fifty-nine. That can mean a lot of savings.

review/summary: The "tastier" fruit and nut bar
review/text: Obviously a lot of people like this bar, myself included, so I thought I'd review it a bit differently.  When I was searching for a healthier between meal afternoon snack I read a lot of reviews for a lot of products.  I wanted something with few ingredients, not "fortified" and with some nuts in it.  I settled on these Larabar Fruit & Nut Cherry Pie bars and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P504ZG">Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry Living Food Bar</a>.  I love cherries and I love blueberries so they seemed like good choices.<br /><br />The stats of the bars are very similar, weight (both 1.7oz, not 1.8), calories, fat, sugars, etc.  The PURE has more protein at 6g vs 4g.  The Larabar has no sodium while the PURE has just a bit at 5mg.  The Larabar is thicker, the PURE bar is wider.  Visually the Larabar appears to have more nuts in it, which doesn't seem to jive with the protein stats.  The PURE bar has a grittier texture while chewing so maybe more of the nuts are finely ground.<br /><br />1st ingredient is dates for both followed by almonds and then cherries for the Larabar and followed by blueberries and various nuts, organic agave nectar, rice protein and lemon juice for the PURE bar.  One would think with the extra ingredients in the PURE bar they were added to tweak the flavor or give it a fresher taste, but the flavor of the Larabar is better than the PURE by a pretty good margin.  It has a much fresher and lively taste.  I have to say the PURE bar is a bit cardboardy tasting to me and has a drier mouth feel.  It is not bad, in fact my 2 youngest kids eat them readily, just not nearly as good as the Larabar.  I think the tartness of the cherries in the Larabar kick up the flavor vs the milder blueberry flavor of the PURE (maybe the lemon juice add as an attempt to kick up the PURE bar flavor and tartness?).  In fairness I should probably review the PURE Cherry Cashew bar but I much prefer almonds over cashews so don't plan on ordering any from Amazon.  If I stumble on the PURE cherry in a regular store I will give one a try thugh.  I still get both auto shipped from Amazon for variety sake, but am looking for a better tasting blueberry bar w/ basic ingredients including nuts.<br /><br />For grins here is a comparison of the Larabar, PURE, Snickers, Hershey's and Maruchan Chicken Ramen noodles in a few categories.  Stats are listed in the order I listed them in the previous sentence.<br /><br />Calories:  190, 190, 280, 210, 380<br />Total Fat:  8g, 9, 14, 13, 14  Saturated Fat:  0.5g, 1, 5, 8, 7<br />Sugars:  21g, 20, 30, 24, 0<br />Protein:  4g, 6, 4, 3, 10<br />Sodium:  0mg, 5, 140, 35, 1540 !!!

review/summary: Cashew Cookie is My Favorite Larabar!!!!!
review/text: Cashew Cookie is my very favorite variety of all the Larabars!!!<br /><br />The reason I love it so much, is because it reminds me of shortbread.  I always loved shortbread, but do not eat it anymore due to the butter and eggs.  I need to find a good vegan recipe for shortbread, if there are any, but this cashew cookie bar is perfect.<br /><br />With my shortbread cookies, I prefer tea.  Therefore, with my Larabar Cashew Cookies, I prefer tea.<br /><br />I love both coffee and tea, but with shortbread, I feel tea is what goes best.  There are certain things that just go together.  Such as cornbread and iced tea; flatbread pizza and bubbly fruit juice; cold weather and coffee; hot weather and watermelon; friends and cozy lunch diners; shortbread and tea.  And in this case, it is Larabar Cashew Cookie and Tea.<br /><br />These bars come in different awesome and amazing flavors.<br /><br />These bars are healthy.  They are vegan-friendly.  There are no bad ingredients, such as sugar, chemicals, or preservatives.  There isn't even flour.  There are only healthy ingredients in these bars: fruits and nuts.  The fruit sweetens them.  They fool you into thinking you're eating something bad, because they taste so good.

I highly recommend the Larabar Coconut Cream Pie bars for a bit of sweetness that is actually good for you.

These are a great pick me up that is terrific to have handy when a meeting or function goes long, or to keep me out of the drive thru on the way home from the beach or a road trip. They are high in carbs, but I don't eat them all the time. They are simple, with few ingredients, and are minimally processed. I feel good after eating them, and it doesn't feel like I just swallowed a brick, or that I have to wash it down with two gallons of water. On long bike rides or races they are perfect for balancing nutritional intake. Triathletes take note!

review/summary: Strong cherry taste, more tart than sweet
review/text: These bars have a strong cherry taste, but because they have no sugar, they don't really taste like cherry pie. The bars have only three ingredients: dates, almonds, and unsweetened cherries. The almonds are chopped pretty finely, but still give the bar a bit of crunchiness. I love the taste, but if you're looking for something sweet, you might be disappointed. Each bar has 190 calories and 80 of them are from fat.

review/text: Okay, not literally for president, but I must say that Larabar is by FAR the best snack I have ever come across that is satisfying and a healthy alternative to the highly processed crap that is out there.  No high fructose corn syrup, or weird chemical additives derived from petrol products, and definately nothing synthetic!  Nature at it's finest!  If you have kids, they will adore these and won't even know THEY ARE HEALTHY FOR THEM!  I have yet to meet a flavor that I don't like!  Anyone who gives these a bad review either haven't tried them or they wanted them to be a Snickers bar. (I still feel these kick the pants off ALL candybars-but that's just my humble opinion.)

review/summary: Wholesome Goodness, Conveniently Packaged Into One Bar
review/text: After just one bite, I was completely sold on this bar - it is PACKED with pieces of pistachios and cashews, has a sweet (but definitely not overly sweet) flavor from the dates, and has a nice, chewy texture. Overall, a very pleasing experience for my taste buds - all while nourishing my body, as well!<br /><br />Do not let some of the nutritional information (i.e. the fat and sugar contents) scare you - pistachios are an excellent source of protein, Vitamin E, potassium, magnesium, iron, phosphorous, and zinc; the cashews contribute iron and zinc as well, plus heart-healthy oils and Vitamin B6. In addition, the dates are a good source of Vitamins A, C, and B-Complex, plus iron and and magnesium as well. Even though the bar is only 51 grams, it is VERY satisfying and filling.<br /><br />Everything in this bar occurs naturally - no chemicals, artificial ingredients, or trans-fats here! In fact, the bar contains just three ingredients: dates, pistachios, and cashews - no dictionary needed to figure out its contents, that's for sure.<br /><br />When I received my package of the Pistachio Larabars from Amazon, the box was in great condition, and none of the bars (at least, the ones I have eaten so far; and I eat one almost everyday) have been rancid. Overall, this product (and other Larabar flavors, as well) is HIGHLY recommended, on my part.

review/summary: Tasty, but why aren't these organic?
review/text: If you squish together dates & bananas, mix in finely chopped almonds, form into bars, and dry the bars a bit so they're not too sticky, you basically have a Banana Cookie LaraBar.  I think they taste quite good for packaged bars and are healthier than most of the available food bars.  They taste like, well, bananas, dates, and almonds, with the almonds providing a bit of crunch.<br /><br />Although the ingredient list is only three words long, the wrapper text extolling the healthfulness and near-magical virtues of the bar is seven lines long.  To partially quote, "Real food, raw food... No chemicals, no fillers, no medicinal tasting supplements.  LaraBar is never cooked.  Never Processed...[will] leave you with a pleasing sense of vitality and well being for hours to come."  And there's more information on the wrapper, "uncooked * unprocessed * no added sugar * non-GMO * gluten free * dairy free * soy free * vegan * kosher."  The LaraBar website also tells you (in case you haven't figured this out) non-irradiated, no sulfites, and no colorings.<br /><br />All this is well and good, but if they're going to the trouble of making a bar that's so fabulously healthy for you, then it would be nice if they used organic ingredients.  Eating a bar made with conventionally grown (pesticided) fruit invalidates some of the healthfulness of the bar.  The bar tastes good, but in terms of healthfulness, I think LaraBar can do better.<br /><br />P.S. And what's with the two dots above the first letter A in Lara?  Do they want us to think it's an exotically Scandinavian product?  Like Haagen Daz, Lara bars are made in the U.S.A.

review/summary: Amazon larabars taste stale and dry!
review/text: I've gotten this flavor larabar from the grocery store and loved it. In fact, that was the reason why I purchased it from Amazon - because the cost per unit is so much lower. The peanut butter cookie bar from the grocery store was moist and delicious. The bars I received from Amazon taste stale. They're dry and crumbly. The expiration date is not until 2013 so I don't understand why they would be this way but they are. I won't be reordering any more Larabars from Amazon!

review/summary: OK taste but surprise on last pack of white fuzzy
review/text: I figured I would give Larabar a try since I want to cut down my chips/cookie snacking on those late afternoon. I also shared them with my family and friends which got me varying opinions.  There was only one person that complained it was too sweet. Other health conscious, ingredient readers were impressed with the make and taste.  For myself, I thought they were OK. I don't normally snack on fruit bars like this so it took a bit to get accustomed to the sticky and "oily" fruit bar.<br /><br />As I was coming to the last couple bars in my Key Lime Pie, I ventured to get the Coconut Pie. Oddly, they almost tasted the same except for a slightly stronger coconut taste. It still had the "core" of dates and nuts,etc.  What really jumped at me is on my 2nd to last Key Lime Pie ... I noticed fuzzy edge on the bar.  The box stated it hasn't expired either so I am hoping this is a single bad bar in the box.  However it doesn't help that to search the term on the comments here that someone had a whole box of *bad*.  I'll see how the coconut pie fares but the mental image is now stuck on me. It is an OK alternative but I may seek another late afternoon snack.

review/summary: Dogs love 'em!  Plus they're entirely USA grown, processed, etc
review/text: I am always on the lookout for dog treats made ENTIRELY in the USA.  That is, the animals are born, raised and slaughtered here, and the processing and packaging takes place here.  I've been reading horror stories about products from China, but you also have to be aware that even those that say "Made in the USA" could include ingredients from China.  I've looked into it.  I don't trust food products with Chinese origins, period.  And I'd rather give the biz to companies loyal to US workers.<br /><br />All that said, as disgusting as lungs and hearts might sound to me, dogs love this stuff!  And they're satisfying enough for my 15 lb Pomeranians that one does the trick, they don't just gulp them down and swallow them, and keep coming back hoping to get more.  They take more than a nanosecond to consume.  Finally, there are no added ingredients.  One Pom is diabetic, so no added starches/sugars for him.<br /><br />Great product, good value for the quality, and made in the USA!

review/summary: Finally, a Healthy and Tasty Chip!
review/text: Sometimes you want sweet, sometimes you want salty. When you want salty, consider trying these chips.  Substitution is the name of the game when you're wanting to eat healthy and maintain or get to a healthy weight without depriving yourself a nutritionist taught me.  Finding these chips was serendipity!  You can have 20 chips for about 130 calories--about 6 calories per chip!--and they taste as good, if not better, than potato chips.  If popcorn could be made into a chip, this is the result.  I'm eating them as I write this review.  They have no saturated or trans fats, not that high in sodium (only 7% of daily allowance), no cholesterol, not high carb (7%) with 2 g of protein and even a little iron.  What's not to love?  And 20 are very satisfying.  I like dipping them in guacamole.<br /><br />You can pack a bag in your purse or your child's lunch.  As their bag says, they're the new shape of popcorn!  I've lost 30 pounds over the last two years eating healthy and these chips are guilt-free.

review/summary: Very Good and 100% Natural and Healthy Snack....
review/text: I had to write a review on this mainly because they really are SO GOOD! They are bite sized clusters, being 100% natural with No preservatives, No Artificial flavors, No Added Colors. Ingredients are: Almonds, Brown Rice Syrup, Pecans, Cashews, Organic Sugar, Sea Salt and Sunflower Oil. I bought 2 bags of these at Sam's Club and I decided to look for them on Amazon because I thought they'd be cheaper, and I actually paid about $8.69 for the same 24 oz. bag at Sams Club. Wow, now I want to go back to Sams Club, these are so good, but I think very overpriced if you purchase them here. I would suggest going to your local Sams Club if you have one in your area, the size of the package is exactly the same.

review/text: I discovered these almond, pecan, cashew clusters about a year ago while shopping at Sam Club's. They were sampling them with yogurt. OMG ... one bite and I was hooked! I LOVE these. My kids love them. They are PERFECT by themselves or in yogurt. A serving size (~5 bite-size clusters) is 170 calories w/12g of fat (as is expected from nuts). They are very addictive ... almost like eating candy. Unfortunately, it's not hard to find yourself eating more than 1 serving. :)<br /><br />These are are 100% natural and the only other ingredients outside of the nuts are brown rice syrup, organic sugar, sea salt, and sunflower oil. I paid around $8 for a 24 oz bag at Sam's Club.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have been trying to reduce the amount of sugar in my diet, so I have switched to just eating raw/plain almonds, pecans, cashews and walnuts. :)

I prepared a small serving anyway hoping the coffee flavor would kick in after the wet ingredients were added but it still just tasted like a bitter dark chocolate mocha. Bleh... unless you like mochas and/or dark chocolate, then you will probably like this stuff.<br /><br />This was a very disappointing purchase.

review/summary: Ghirardelli Unsweetened Cocoa Excellent
review/text: Over the years, I have tried various brands of unsweetened cocoa powder to use in baking and for mixing in my morning coffee.  Ghirardelli's "Natural Unsweetened Cocoa" has become my number one cocoa of choice. It has a very rich flavor and is finely ground so it mixes readily.<br /><br />I purchase approximately one cannister each month from my local Whole Foods market, where the price has been $4.99 per 10-ounce/283-gram container for some time now.  The price for the very same item on Amazon's website (actually one of their resellers) is currently way too much for the product.  Hopefully Amazon (or their reseller) will price the product more reasonably, as have other grocery retailers.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Ghirardelli's "Natural Unsweetened Cocoa" is an excellent product.

review/summary: Excellent Flavor!
review/text: Once I used Ghirardelli's unsweetened baking cocoa I have never gone back to any other brand. The flavor is rich, pure and really captures the essence of what chocolate is SUPPOSED to taste like. Compared to other brands like Hershey's and Nestle, Ghirardelli's cocoa is much, much darker which surprised me a little. I have tried to use other brands since, but their flavors don't even come close to comparing. Maybe I'm a chocolate snob, but I can't use any other cocoa (not to mention chocolate chips) now besides this one.<br />The only downside is that the unsweetened cocoa is very difficult to find. Ghirardelli does sell it through their website however. ([...]) I highly recommend this product. But be warned - you might not be able to go back to the other cheap stuff!

review/summary: Ghiradelli - Simply the best cocoa powder available
review/text: Ever since my curiosity was piqued at the tender age of two, when I, while pretending to nap, witnessed my (very pregnant) mother wolfing down milk chocolate Hershey Bars, I have been obsessed with chocolate. By the time I started school, I knew that every single member of my family --- siblings, parents, grandparents, and cousins --- was afflicted with chocoholicism. As an adult, I realized that this trait must be genetically dominant, since all of my children, and each of my nieces and nephews, has no willpower when confronted by the presence of "C". Thank heavens that modern medicine has made us aware that this is not a disease, but merely an ultra-healthy yearning to keep antioxidants flowing into our bodies at a rate adequate to maintain our physical well-being, psychological balance, and generally off-beat sense of humor!<br /><br />Since I am the premier baker of this extended family (Look, I see no reason to affect false modesty here! Each of my closest relatives will readily admit to having been born with serious kitchen-utensil-and-cookbook-direction-reading impairment.), my kitchen must be stocked at all times with multiple cans of Ghiradelli unsweetened cocoa and several bags of Ghiradelli chocolate chips, both semi-sweet and double-chocolate. These items provide the essence of my chocolate cakes; frostings, fillings, ganaches, glazes, and fudge; brownies; cookies; puddings; and Mexican "mole" sauces. No other brand of chocolate, at any price, comes close to the taste and finish of Ghiradelli.<br /><br />Hint: for cakes, brownies, and buttercreams, instead of just baking chocolate or just cocoa, try using equivalent parts cocoa (dissolved in hot coffee, milk, or cream) and melted double-chocolate chips. I consider 1/4 cup packed and then sifted cocoa to provide taste equivalent to about 2/3 cup double-chocolate chips.<br /><br />ENJOY! ------  Beth Baker

review/text: Hi.  First, Ghiradelli Chocolate, while difficult to spell, and argumentative to say ;-)  - is THE greatest brand of Chocolate that I've ever tried.  Of course, Godiva is good, but not Ghiradelli Good!  I purchase the Unsweetened Cocoa Powder for my mom who is Diabetic and addicted to Bottled Starbucks Frap drinks.  Even with the Splenda version, I would rather her try making her own "Mochas" with the powder.  I worked at Starbucks for 5 years, so I know how to make Mocha :-).  Now my question is aftertaste.  Of course, I couldn't buy just one can of a product that practically has zero calories per serving, no sugar, etc...and send it to my  Mom, so I bought one for me as well.  However, recently - I wake up every morning with the saltiest taste in my mouth (I know South park fans will immediately snicker and think of Chef."  My doctor doesn't  even know what it is.  We've tried stopping medications, etc...but I think I've narrowed it down to this product.  Can completely natural cocoa (with only 3% of your sodium intake) have any other ingredient or be made with a process that would create such a salty (I went to bed eating salt packets) taste?  I usually do make a decaf mocha just before bed.  To all of you cocoa experts - thanks for any advice you can give!

I felt an immediate difference. I didn't get tired at 3pm like I normally do. I was more alert and focused. I felt great. We tried the Navitas powder because it was cheaper. However, it gave me stomach aches and digestive problems. I felt no improvement in energy. I also can't stand the taste - and I'm pretty tolerant of that kind of stuff. My boyfriend hasn't experienced any negative side effects. He says he doesn't mind it. But we both prefer the Sambazon fruit pulp packs instead.

review/summary: Cheap, but terrible taste
review/text: This Navitas brand does give you a lot of quantity for your money.  I do question how good this is.  Acai is supposed to be frozen within 24 hours of harvesting or else it loses all the good stuff that the hype is all about.  I do not know if this is or not nor could I verify it anywhere.  This is the second brand I have tried and I do not feel any of the effects and this is after taking this for a month.  This brand does taste terrible in comparison to the mawe 100g pouches being sold here on amazon.  Mawe has a slight amount of cane sugar added and is not as finely ground.  It definitely tastes better, but then it is more expensive as far as how much quantity you get per dollar spent.

review/summary: No weight loss
review/text: I've been using this in smoothies about every other day, and haven't noticed any weight loss, but it seems to have a beneficial laxative effect.  I mix about a 1/4 cup with ice, organic yogurt, a banana, and perhaps a whole orange or orange juice.  Looks really grainy, and purple, but goes down easily.  It doesn't seem to vary the flavor of the smoothie significantly.  It's not bad tasting, to me.

review/text: ill get the neg's out of the way. ....the bag. fist time i used it the glue holding on the ziplock part, came unglued. thats it.<br /><br />as fo the product its great. many servings for a great price considering acai is an expensive product and difficult to handle. i emailed navitas and they informed me that this product is considered "RAW" so it is not denatured and none of the benefits derived are damaged or altered. plus with the powder over the liquid, you get the skin kept in the mix which with fruits and such, this is where most of the beneficials come from. so i say A+<br /><br />oh and taste is great. i literally teaspoon some and just put it in my mouth twice a day. study acai and stop your other supps so you can buy this as a replacement. benefits are endless in this nutrient deficient society. and real food is the most bio-available source!!

review/summary: great stuff to bake with!
review/text: I just made a batch of cupcakes using ground oatmeal acai powder and bananas with wild blueberries and they turned out awesome. the batch made 22 cupcakes and i used a cup of acai powder so there was over 2 teaspoons of acai in each cupcake as well as 3tbs of ground oatmeal. Sooo if you want to make some superfood cupcakes this stuff works really well. I have added it to smoothies and it was like okay but not supernummy. I've added it to chocolate and that was good.<br /><br />I don't take acai for weight loss so I can't speak to that. I take it for its antioxidants.<br /><br />Another person commented that this powder should be refrigerated after opening according to the small print on the package. This is probably a good idea but I will say that I missed this info and have had my bag open for 7 months and it's great- hasn't gone bad at all.<br /><br />In summary, I recommend baking this into goods or blending it into chocolate or jelly :)<br /><br />Hope this helps someone!

review/summary: must refrigerate after opening
review/text: I don't see it listed on the product information section on amazon but it says on the package under recommended storage that the item should be stored in the refrigerator after opening. most dried powders do not need to be refrigerated. I thought this was an important tidbit of information that was left off the amazon page. i cannot say whether it would go bad if it wasn't kept refrigerated, just makes me a little wary wondering how long it'll keep now that it's opened. it's a lot of powder and a little goes a long way. It doesn't say use within x number of days on the package, so all you have to go by is the expiration date. the expiration date i believe is for products that haven't been opened yet. so now that it's been opened how long will it last? so my suggestion is buy it only if you plan on using it often.<br /><br />as far as the actual product goes, it doesn't dissolve well in cold liquid like iced tea. I tried mixing a teaspoon worth in a glass of iced tea and stirred it up with a spoon. the color of the iced tea changed color so you know some of it did dissolve, but the majority of what i added seemed to just rise to the top in clumps. my suggestion would be to mix in a smoothie that you create in a blender. or mix in yogurt.

review/text: I'm not sure about the weight loss aspect of this, I have lost weight but I have no idea if it has anything to do with this stuff, either way that's not why I bought it. I bought this for the supposed antioxidants and I've continued to use it because I love the taste and I suspect it's also been giving me an energy boost... another aspect which I can only guess on but can't really quallify. I mostly use this in smoothies, but it's also really good just mixed in greek yogurt and I've added it to iced tea several times. The packaging for all Navitas Naturals products is easilly ripped, especially at the top where it seals, this is something that bothers me but since I love their products I've just decided to overlook that and invest in some bag clips.

review/summary: Noticeable Benefits this far!
review/text: I've only been taking this poduct for coming up on 2 weeks but already I noticed some results. I feel much more energetic; less lathargic. My constipation has ceased....*smiles*... Taking this has restored a natural rhythm for me and it's easier to go when I do go.  My significant other says that I look slimmer-- now I don't know if that's a direct Navitas effect OR if the energy I get from it is just giving my workout endurance a boost, but I could care less so long as I'm seeing and feeling the results!  I haven't changed my diet any, just added navitas and went back to the gym. In the past "diet" seasons, I usually get tired pretty fast before I reach the peak of my workout so I am convinced that the Acai powder is what's pushing me thru.<br /><br />Now as for the taste; I agree that it is similar to what most acai powder users are saying-- it looks like fresh ground coffee; smells like old tea leaves; tastes like dirt. Unless you're brave enough to pull a Rocky "drink the raw eggs and get your tough guy/gal on", I wouldn't recommend the "spoon in the mouthful and chase it with water" option-- believe me the water will not wash it down fast enough for your comfort.<br />I've found that the most successful options for me have been to mix a  teaspoon into your favorite yogurt/smoothie or stir a heaping teaspoon into a tall glass of cranberry juice (or some other strong tasting juice). It is true when mixing it into thin liquids that some DOES stick to the glass, but when that amount is compared to the amount I put in, I know I've ingested most of it. I just drink fast and keep stirring between gulps. Whatever the mix, you'll probably experience a hint of "prune" taste but not so much if you balance it right. After a little while of getting used to and discipline to stay on the routine, I found that it's not so bad and overall the benefits (and knowing you are doing something great for your body) makes enduring a little odd taste very worth it.<br /><br />Seems to be a good value for the money; one bag looks like it will go a long way consuming one teaspoon a day.

review/summary: Beware many reports of toxic effects from Navitas
review/text: Confirmed Goji Berry causing severe nausia cramping and intestinal pain.<br /><br />I was introduced to goji berries during the summer as a friend I met had just opened a raw food cafe. His food NEVER (I mean never) gave me any problems it was all delicious and much of it was cacao and goji berries. He has very selective about his sources and does not trust many companies out there.(His Goji comes from Sunfood)<br /><br />When I returned home from Alaska I decided to try more superfoods and bought a trail mix by Navitas that was Goji, Cacao Nibs, and Cashews. That day I had a green shake for breakfast and a banana for a snack then just a pinch of Goji Berries afterwards. Within the hour I was writhing in pain and couldn't imagine what it was.<br /><br />This pain is severe. I wanted to die. It lasted about twelve hours. Including vomiting and diarrhea<br /><br />Next day I had a big green salad for lunch and then feeling better grabbed another SMALL pinch of goji and within 20 minutes I was in the exact same pain. I knew then it was the goji and instantly typed "goji stomach ache" into google and found threads verifying it.<br /><br />I called my friend and told him about my reaction and he asked me if it was Navitas.  I didn't recall and didn't have the bag on me but he said he bet 100% it was them.  He had similar reaction to their product and did hydrogen peroxide tests and found them to be rancid.  Got home and verified his assertion.<br /><br />Again, I never had this problem before eating Goji from Sunfood, but this Navitas is killing me.<br /><br />BEWARE: Detox can be painful enough even on a quality Goji berry.  You should start with very small amounts and I would recommend trying alternate brands NOT navitas.

review/text: As someone who takes many types of green products (Spirulina, Chlorella, Blue Green Algae etc) everyday, I have a pretty good idea of what a good supplement should be like, and this stuff really works well. It gave me hours of intense energy to concentrate on whatever I needed to get done. I looked at the ingredients and it has all kinds of good stuff like: Wheat Grass, Barley Grass, Alfalfa, Spirulina, Spinach, Brocolli, Chlorella, Rose Hips, Green Tea, Flax Seed Powder and more. I would recommend this for anyone who needs more nutrition in their diet, and needs more dark greens. This is a great supplement for those who don't get enough veggies (but a better idea would be to take this supplement, and eat your veggies).  Tastes especially good with fresh apple or pear juice.

review/summary: Very impressed and I don't get impressed easily
review/text: Im not someone who usually writes reviews on products but I have made an exception. This product really works. I have recently quit drinking coffee (ok I have one occasionally) and I needed something that I could drink in the morning that is healthy and provides energy. From my first time using it and every time since (I am now almost through my first box) I felt a boost in energy and mental clarity that lasted me throughout my morning and into the afternoon. This stuff really works!

review/text: This is a great product and very impressed with the shipper. I would highly recommend this product, I do have an increase of energy and notice my skin and digestion issues has improved greatly.  I recieve the canister for home (auto ship) and purchased the singles to carry to work. I have shared these with others including my husband (who was reluctant) but found out he was secretly adding it to his daily protien shakes.

review/text: I got this on a lark after reading a food blogger rave about it - and it makes a HUGE difference in my morning.  I haven't noticed any improvement in my skin or hair, but I can feel the difference in my body when I throw one of these in my morning smoothies.  I have a lot more energy and I feel much stronger.  Love this product.

review/summary: Tastes great
review/text: Tastes just like regular black tea only a little weaker. Don't get it if you expect it to actually taste like raspberries. I bought 6 boxes to use in the first half of my menstrual cycle for building a good uterine lining. It's organic, good tasting, and has health benefits without the caffeine. Can't go wrong!

review/summary: Doesn't smell as bad as regular sticks
review/text: Our dog, Molly eats a large bully stick every 7-10 days and it is refreshing when one doesn't have to endure the smell of rotten corpse.  Don't get me wrong, this bully stick still smells, but the smell is ten times less intense than a regular bully stick.

review/summary: Good price on a nice yerba set
review/text: Based on the picture, I was worried that the gourd might be a large one, since the pic shows a gourd that's only maybe an inch or so shorter than a 1.1-lb bag of mate. That would be way too big for single servings (I think it works better to have a gourd that holds just a little more yerba than what you need for the amount of mate you want to drink - I use 2 8-oz mugs of water with one gourdful of yerba).<br /><br />But as the other reviewer said, this is a small gourd. In fact, it's smaller than any I've used before, but it's still big enough. The only qualm I have with the gourd is that the bottom is too round, so if I set it on the counter with the bombilla in it before I've filled it with yerba, it will roll over. This is probably common enough with small gourds - and I expect it varies from gourd to gourd, so yours may have a flatter bottom than mine.<br /><br />The bombilla is the spoon style, and the filter part is actually curved slightly, like a very shallow spoon. This was unexpected, and I find I can use the bombilla itself to clean the yerba out of the gourd, which is convenient. The bombilla is all one piece - it doesn't come apart like some do, which means you can't hand wash the inside of the filter, but it should also remain as solid as it is when you first get it. I've had the kind that comes apart, and after awhile the filter would be loose even when it was screwed on all the way.<br /><br />Also, Taragui is a popular Argentine brand of mate - this is the style that has the stems, and it's pretty strong without being overwhelming or too bitter. It's a brand I'm always happy to go to.<br /><br />Finally, this price is well worth it. It's hard to find a balance between product price and shipping cost on yerba mate, and this is the best deal I've seen for what you get. (I would probably have paid $25-30 for a gourd, bombilla and 1 kg of Taragui shipped, at the site I usually buy from.)<br /><br />Edited to add: I saw that another reviewer received out-of-date mate. Just wanted to point out that mine has its "best by" date in 2013, so apparently it's not consistent.

review/summary: Great yerba and mate
review/text: For the price this is a great deal.. The gourde(mate) is small, too small I thought at first, but then I realized that the size helps to make a better drink. The taragui yerba was very good as well. The bombilla that comes with the set is large, easy to use and clean.

review/summary: Out of date yerba mate
review/text: I've not yet cured the gourd or even tried this product, so it might be fine -- but I would like to point out that I purchased this product the last week of Oct. 2010, and the sell by date on the Taragui yerba mate is Nov. 2009 -- a year out of date!  That's not quite how things should be done, I think.

review/summary: Needs to update picture and get better packaging
review/text: I ordered this starter set as I've heard alot of great things about Yerba Mate so since I had a couple other things to order I ordered this up as well. I've just received it and I only have two qualms about this set.<br />The first is that Amazon needs to update the picture of this product with what is actually shipped out. The gourd isn't anywhere close to the size of the one in the picture. It's about a third of the size from the picture. I understand that a big mate cup is not needed but if someone is ordering this item I'd say they may be disappointed with the difference.<br />The second issue is the packaging. Unlike the picture where the Mate and Bombilla are separated, the product I received had the Bombilla inside the Mate and held in the center by a cardboard insert. This led to finding a damaged product when I opened the box and found the Mate halfway up the Bombilla and pieces of the gourd in the box.<br />This seems like a great price for a starter set but you may be better off either buying everything separate or buying a second Mate cup just in case.

review/summary: Good starter set
review/text: This is a good starter set at a good price if you would like to try the tea, mate, and bombillas.  The tea arrived fresh and has a very nice flavor, not too bitter. The mate is a little different than what is pictured, and a little smaller. However, it is a gourde so it's understandable that they will vary in size. I like the bombillas, and cleaning it hasn't been a problem so far.  Just make sure to rinse it as soon as you are done using it.<br /><br />I took off one star only because the product packaging was somewhat sloppy. If it were to be given as a gift, I would have had to repackage the whole thing. The shipping was fast, and the shipping box itself was neat and sturdy.

review/summary: Almost great, but still bad.
review/text: I thought that this was going to be a great deal when I ordered it, and quite frankly, it almost was. The yerba mate tasted good, the bombilla was fine too, no problems there. Unfortunately the mate itself had a sizable crack in it, so now I have to drink the stuff out of a mug until I can find a new mate. Not happy about this.
