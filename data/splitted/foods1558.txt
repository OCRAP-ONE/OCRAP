review/text: This kept my dog's attention for a couple minutes the first few times we used it, but now she has no interest.  I think my 2 year old enjoyed it more than my dog did.  It seems to slide around too easy and our dog has a tough time getting the yellow "cups" out.  She's not overly food driven, so that may be part of the problem.  Guess we'll try something else.

review/summary: Great interactive toy for dogs!
review/text: My two year old Havapoo (half Havanese, half Poodle) loves this toy! She is food motivated and she is smart so I thought this would be a good challenge for her. It took her five minutes to figure out how to remove the yellow cup. In the beginning, she was pawing at it. Finally she figured out a way to remove the cup with her mouth. Within ten minutes she was able to find all the hidden treats. After this exercise, she was a bit tired from all the mental stimulation, she took a nap for a couple hours. LOL. It was just the right level of difficulty for her. There was a tiny bit of frustration but any more frustration, she would have given up. Now, this is the only way she has dinner. She is getting more and more efficient at removing the cups. I didn't know if this would be too big for her mouth, but she has no problems. This is a great toy and a fun way to keep your dog stimulated and active.

review/summary: Love it!!
review/text: I'm happy to say that all three of my dogs had no issue with the yellow covers cracking. They are hard plastic, but they are fairly thick and don't give even to a hard squeeze. My dogs all realized that the object was to get the covers out of the way, not to chew on them, so that may be the issue. My 4-month-old German Shepherd figured this out very quickly and even put the little covers back on after all the treats were gone, as if she expected them to refill magically, lol! It took my 3-year-old golden retriever a bit more time to figure out and she used her paws quite a bit whereas the puppy was all teeth. It was very interesting to see them try different ways of figuring out the puzzle. However, my 3-year-old malamute is kind of a baby and he tried very briefly before he looked at me and started to whine. Clearly it's not as much fun for a furbaby who is used to having everything handed to him! My girls still get very excited every time we pull this out though. We always use a high value treat in the puzzle, something special that they don't get every day. They will play the game over and over and over as many times as I refill it. I definitely think this is something most dogs can do on their own if you need to keep them busy for 10-15 minutes but my girls seems to enjoy it even more when I'm there cheering them on every time they have a success. The materials are very durable, in my opinion, and clean up couldn't be easier. The holes are very easy to wipe clean and a quick rinse under the faucet for the rest is generally all I need to do for the rest. Wonderful toy at a great price if you have highly intelligent dogs who get bored easily!

review/summary: Good fun, but too easy
review/text: We have a 16 week Cocker Spaniel-Australian Shepherd mix (~20 lbs). We got this toy for him when he was only around 10 weeks old.  It was challenging for him the first time.  When we gave it to him the next day, he knew exactly what he was doing and got all the treats out within two minutes.  We even timed it.  Now, as soon as we set it on the floor, it takes only a few seconds for him to get each compartment open, and we don't give it to him very often.  It's a cute/fun way to deliver some treats, but it's not long before he's looking at us like, "Okay, now what?  What's next??"<br /><br />Pros: Opens easily so it's not too frustrating.  The star design makes compartments a bit more challenging if the treats are pushed further inside.  You can put a dab of peanut butter in a few, and it will take him longer to lick it out, but you might have to clean it after.  The grips on the underside really help hold it in place so that he doesn't slide it around the floor too far or too quickly. It has withstood his strong bite/chewing. It is rare that he flips it over, too, so it's weighted well.<br /><br />Cons: Too easy, finished with it and bored within a minute, if not a few seconds.

I will definitely try the other Kyjen games and see if they are more challenging.

review/text: This product was way to easy for our 4 month old pup Raisin. The compartments opened up very easily with each nudge. It does serve well as a puppy food/snack bowl if your pup eats too fast - making him move from compartment to compartment to eat will slow him down. Not great for trying to improve or test your puppy's IQ, but a fun way to feed him.

review/summary: My Dog gave it 2 paws up :)
review/text: My Large Shepard/Chow/Collie Mix is very smart and easily bored. Lets just say he can disembowel a stuffed toy in seconds. Anywhoo, we needed to find a toy that at least challenges him a little bit. The Paw puzzle was fun for him and my family to use. He's definitely food motivated so this was a perfect fit. At first he was laying down while trying to lift up the cups and he couldn't get them up. So i was a little worried they might be a little to smooth for him to lift up but then he stood and gripped the cup in his teeth and pulled it up. He now has the hang of it and can find all the treats in no time. Its great for training (you add the command find it to your routine and it can become a whole new trick/job for your dog). The only down side I can think of is that it's a bit bulky for a toy (you can't just throw it in a dog toy bin) and that it might get old fast for some dogs or owners to use. My other dog is a Amstaff mix and she showed interest in the treats but no desire to search for them lol. So certain breeds may not think this is the bee's knee's. Its easily cleaned, a nice grade of plastic ( although i worry about the cups cracking). You definitely want to supervise while your dog is having fun with this toy. Other than that its fun, and well worth it.

review/summary: Affordable Dog Puzzle!!!
review/text: I bought this puzzle to help entertain my smart and curious and food driven dogs. My "boys" love it! We play it every single day. Often to work on obedience (sit, get it, down, get it!) and just for fun administration of treats and even dinner. My golden retriever loves it, but is a chewer, so he must be supervised with it. He pulled the cups out and thought that in itself was the reward... LOL  but once I simply pointed to the treat hidden in the pawprint dish, he figured it out and was a happy camper. I also bought the spinner, which is actually my favorite of the two styles. I can get my golden's entire kibble allotment for one meal (we feed twice a day) inside it, so it slows down his feeding (so he doesn't gulp it down and get bloat). I know that my dogs love it by the perked ears and bouncing when they see me pick one of the toys up. They also sit and wait to be "released" to start their game. Great fun! The plastic is nice too since you can disinfect it easily or wash it in the sink without worrying about warping, splitting, or cracking wood like on the expensive models of similar toys. Plus, the price has been great and I found it at my local canine speciality store too!

review/summary: too easy, even for "not-so-smart" dogs
review/text: i called up Kyjen customer service for a recommendation on a puzzle toy, and *bonus* got a iive person on the phone (brownie points for great service). I have a mini dachshund, who, although adorable, is not so bright and difficult to train. Kyjen kindly recommended the star spinner. But upon receiving this item, my dachshund figured it out within minutes---i thought she had to be a Border Collie to solve it so quickly!<br /><br />Unfortunately, I wanted this toy to last for a while but this one unfortunately is too easy.  See, If you spin the star just 20 degrees, *all* the treat trays are exposed, and all the dog has to do is walk around to each open tray and eat the treats. If the trays were exposed one at a time or randomly. it would increase the dogs playtime and challenge them further.<br /><br />However, my dog does love other Kyjen Toys -- the Tail Teaser,  Egg Babies platypus and Hide-A-Squirrel in the junior size. Based on the great customer service and other toys, i will try some different Kyjen puzzle games instead.

review/summary: Affordable Fun for your Dog!
review/text: I have a golden retriever as well as a pembroke welsh corgi. They love their food and tend to inhale it. But they are also very smart and tend to get board. I bought the Star Spinner as well as the paw print shaped toy by this same company and they had a blast from the moment I filled it and set it on the floor! I love that the toys are plastic. So they are much easier to clean (just spray and rinse in the sink, or wipe out with a clorox wipe). Particularly since my corgi prefers soft/moist treats as compared to my dry kibble loving golden. I bought this for roughly $20 at my local canine specialty store, which is far more affordable than the "name brand" products. And since I worry about the bacterial growth on the far more expensive wooden models, the easy to clean and disinfect plastic one has been perfect for us. Safety Note: as with ANY dog toy, please supervise your dog while using. Their "drive" will be increased while playing with the toy, and with the paw print model with the removable cups, don't let your dog chew on the cups, but redirect him to the treat inside the dish after he pulls out the cup. My golden retriever loves it so much that I now use it to give him his kibble every day! Which is much safer as the bigger dogs tend towards bloat, which can kill your dog. This allows him to have fun while eating tiny amounts of kibble at a time. Win,Win!

Bacon is a schnorkitzu (schnauzer yorkie shihtzu). i imagine larger dogs would chew the yellow parts up pretty quickly.<br /><br />i'm looking forward to getting another puzzle toy in the future.  i recommend this toy.

review/summary: Good idea - implemention flawed. Maybe good for small dogs.
review/text: I recently got this Kyjen Kibble Drop puzzle toy for our two dogs. We have a 65 lb German Shepherd Dog and a 60 lb Golden Retriever. Both have been learning "nosework" so I thought this would be a fun toy to add to our scenting games.  I plan to use it by dropping one yummy treat at a time and having them find and get it from one of the 4 cups.<br /><br />I'll give you my conclusion first, and then you can decide if you want to read the details below for more info (including size of the toy info).<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />I don't see how this toy could just be put on the ground and left for your dog to get the food out of the cups. Unless you have a very small dog, your dog's attempts will just move the toy around on the floor.  For larger dogs (like ours) the toy is way too lightweight and the flaps over the cups are too low to the ground for effective "nosing the flap" technique. In addition, any dog who couldn't nose the flap effectively would need to use her mouth -- and would naturally pick the arm up in her mouth in an attempt to get at the treats in the cup - thereby dumping all of the treats out of the other cups (hey - problem solved!!!). So, that means to play with this, you'd have to be there to hold the toy down/in-place while your dog does the puzzle and gets the treats.<br /><br />I think this toy would work best (maybe) for a small dog. Kyjen needs to make a heavier and larger sized version for medium or larger dogs.<br /><br />---------<br />.... Now, the details ....<br /><br />First, let me give you some sizing basics about this toy, so you can see if it will be a match for your dog's size.  I measured the toy and it's 10" wide.  The top of the drop-in treat hole chamber is 4" high. Each arm sticks out almost 4" from the middle dispenser. Each treat cup at the end of the arm is about 2"x2" when you lift the flap.  If you look at the very end of the arm, where the flap shuts, the height of the flap edge from the ground is under 1".  The arms of the toy obviously slope upwards from the end, so I am talking about the very end of the arm. This is an extremely lightweight plastic toy, weighing in at just 6.2 oz.<br /><br />Whew, now that all the stats are out of the way... how is the actual puzzle toy?<br /><br />Initially, I had all the flaps open and just put a treat in an open cup so they could "find" it. They didn't have to open the flaps during that phase. The 2x2" cup size is just adequate enough for them to get the treat out. If your dog is good at licking a treat out, this small size will work fine. If your dogs likes to mouth the treat out, and you have a larger dog, the 2x2 chamber size will likely be an issue. Our GSD was having trouble getting treats out because of this, although she eventually figured out how to cram her nose in there and use her tongue at the same time. :)  I would imagine a really large dog would have to be pretty good with his tongue to get a treat out of the small cups.<br /><br />An issue that appeared right away even with this simple usage was that the toy is SO lightweight it moves as soon as the dog touches it. I had to hold the toy in place or else they would just push it across the floor while trying to lick the treat out of the (flap open) cup.  I think Kyjen needs to add some weight to help keep this toy from moving so easily. The bottom has little rubber non-skid feet on each arm, but they do nothing.<br /><br />So... moving on to the phase where they had to open the flap to get the treat.... There is an issue here. For larger dogs, the flap is so low to the ground, that they can have trouble nosing it up. Our Golden tends to lie in front of what she "finds" when scenting. So, her head was already down on the ground level, which made it easier to work on flipping open the very-low-to-the-ground flap. Our GSD stays standing, though. So, from that angle, she couldn't really use her nose to flip the flap up (although she tried). She also used her mouth to try and open it, pawed at it, etc. I'm sure if I wasn't there to hold the toy from sliding, she would have just picked the whole thing up in her mouth -- problem solved! :)<br /><br />Now you can see why I wrote my summary above. From my experience, this is just the wrong size/weight toy for our dogs. I'll still use it for scent games, because I only need to drop one piece at a time in and I can hold the toy in place for this. But I am not sure how else this toy could be used unless you have a small dog.<br /><br />This is a hard toy to rate because of these issues. It's a good idea, but the implementation is flawed. Which is why I rated it so low.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br />c-

review/summary: Good idea however....
review/text: This toy is not that great for my pug. He loves finding stuff in the little cups, however the yellow covers are impossible for him to get off. His mouth won't fit around them so he can't pick them up with his teeth, when he uses his nose to try to get at them the cups just fall back into place and if he uses his paws (that's when he's really frustrated) he winds up just flipping the whole thing over. I have turned the cups upside down so that he can grab at the edges and that works for him. However, it's not really a puzzle because he even figured out that if the cup is sticking up, something is in there. I even have a hard time getting some of the cups out because of the way it is shaped. It's not a bad toy as a starter puzzle but if your dog has done puzzles before, this one won't keep him interested. And if you have a dog with no snout, it's not really worth it.

review/summary: Good concept, too easy
review/text: My German Shepherd took less than 1 minute to take off each cover and that included the time to eat the treat. I was looking for more of a challenge for him. Guess he is one of the too smart for his own good, or at least too smart for this toy. The one star is for my dog, it might work well for others.

review/summary: Just too smart
review/text: I purchased the Kyjen Dog Games Paw Hide Treat Toy.  Labs are exceptionally smart and I try to give mine, Autumn, a variety of challenging toys.  She loves her chew toys but she needs to be challanged.  First of all she found her toy under the tree wrapped and without a treat in it.  How did she do that?  With encouragement we allowed her to open her toy.  I took it away after she examined it.  While she wasn't looking I put a few treats in a few of the compartments.  It took her a few minutes to figure it out.  Next time, no challange at all.  That is why I only gave it 4 stars.  It was too easy, but I think to some dogs it will be great, others fustrating.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043A71PU">Kyjen Dog Games Paw Hide Treat Toy</a>

review/summary: Amazing Toy!!!
review/text: My dog loves this game.  As soon as he sees it, he runs over and waits for his command.  Even though there are 7 areas to hide treats, I usually only do 4 or 5.  When I give him the commad "Find the treats" he sniffs by each cover until he finds the one with the treat.  Then he gets his jaws around the cover and tries to pull it off, sometimes not on the first attempt.  He goes around until he has pulled off each cover that holds a treat.  The ones that are empty, he does not bother to remove the cover.  Really AMAZING Toy!!!!<br /><br />I would recommend keeping the toy hidden until it is time to play, especially if your dog is a chewer.  The covers are small and can be chewed up quickly.

review/text: I bought this toy for my 8 month french bulldog a couple of weeks ago and he loves it. I usually set it up for him 2-3 times a week and he is so excited when he sees me getting it ready. At first I was worried that his flat face would prevent him from getting the treats but he has no problem. I would recommend this for anyone that wants to boycott boring toys.

review/summary: Too easy for my "special" dog
review/text: I bought this as a cheaper alternative to New Tca Interactive Plastic Dog Toy Tornado Helps Prevent Boredom With Different Puzzles ... sometimes the off-brand toys are great, not in this case. The problem with this toy's setup is that all of the compartments are available at the same time. Two quick turns and the toy is completely empty. The "game" lasts for under 5 seconds for my "special" dog. To add further insult, its poorly made.<br /><br />I threw it away.

review/summary: Made in China... BOO!!!
review/text: I watched a video on this product.  I'm trying to buy more American made items to support my country.  For whatever reason, I thought this was made in the US.  I bought all 3 Kyjen Dog Games.  They all work just fine.  On this particular one, the rubber sticky foot that stops the game from sliding around, was stuck to the instruction sheet rather than the game itself.  I was able to gently take it off the paper and it had enough stick left to stay on the game.

review/summary: A Good Thinking Game
review/text: I have 3 dogs and even though one was not interested the other 2 were. They had fun trying to figure out how to get the treats even to trying to get me to get it for them (ha!). However, once it was figured out, they had fun eating the treats. I will warn multi-dog houses. You might try this on a individual basis. 2 of my dogs who normally don't fight over food at all got a bit possessive of the toy. Also, do not leave unattended so it doesn't get chewed up. Otherwise, I say go for it. It is a good thinking dog toy.

review/summary: Too easy a game
review/text: As some other reviewers have mentioned this toy was not much of a challenge for my food motivated Golden Retriever.  It took him less then 3 minutes to pick up each of the little yellow cup covers and eat his treat.  I will continue to use this toy, as I already own it.  I might even ue it sometimes just to put his dinner in so it will take him a little longer to go from well to well instead of gobbling down his bowl of food.  I do like the fact that the toy is all plastic so it can easily be washed.

review/summary: Affordable, and not too challenging.
review/text: Not a bad starter puzzle, especially for the price.<br /><br />My Lab/Border Collie had it totally figured out within about 20 minutes, so it wasn't super challenging for her. She had more issues with the cups located in the "palm" section of the paw. It was hard for her to get her mouth on them, and almost impossible to "slide up."<br /><br />The primary complaint I have with this toy are the yellow cups. They are flimsy and could be easily cracked into pieces with very minimal effort for a decent sized dog, or an aggressive chewer.<br /><br />DEFINITELY do not leave your dog alone with the toy. (This should go without saying..but...)<br /><br />Would I recommend the toy? Maybe. I think it would be ideal for medium sized dogs that aren't too smart for their own good. (If your dog can unscrew things, open doors, drawers, etc..then you may want to go for a more challenging toy. I wish I had of.)

review/summary: Kyjen Dog Games Treat Wheel (Misc.)
review/text: I have a 95lb pitbull/ mastiff mix that often loves his rope bone and his squeaker toy and thought it would be great to challenge him with some thinking toys.  I was a bit weary of this toy because my dog might chew up the plastic treat covers but found they are rather tough and that food incentive was greater than the chew incentive.  Overall it took about 10 minutes with the advice of the instructions and my pup was on his way to collecting treats from his new puzzle.  It takes him a few seconds now to pull the right cap off and start chowing on his goodies.  Another thing I would like to note is clean up is pretty easy.  I washed the tray and cups with hot water and soap and let dry next to the counter.<br /><br />This is a Social Writeup

review/summary: Think of this not as a puzzle or toy but more of an interactive feeder
review/text: I would definitely agree with others that this is not a very challenging puzzle toy.  So why do I give it 5 stars?  Well, challenging or not, this toy keeps my dog engaged and happy while eating!<br /><br />When my husband and I adopted our little dachshund/miniature schnauzer mix, he wasn't eating very much.  The vet told us that once he acclimated to his new owners and surroundings, his appetite would pick up.  Well, it didn't.  After two months, he still would not eat very much out of his bowl.  He would take 3-4 bites and would walk away from all his food.  My husband and I had to force our dog to eat or hand feed him - neither of which we liked.<br /><br />I read up on dachshunds and found out that they are hunting dogs.  I thought that maybe if we made getting his meal a bit more of a hunt or challenge that he would like it more - and sure enough, I was right!  Ever since we bought this star toy, he eats ALL his food with no problems!  It is such a relief not to have force or hand feed our dog and to not worry if our dog is getting enough food.  The fact that he enjoys it and likes it so much is just the icing on the cake and makes us so happy!  So, for our dog, it's more of an interactive feeder than a toy or brain game but we feel that it was well worth the money paid!<br /><br />We've had it about a month now and our dog eats out of it 1-2 times a day and it's holding up just fine.  He is a big chewer and he's tried to chew this a few times but so far, has not done any damage.  We have high hopes that this will last for a while!

review/summary: Great Toy to get dogs thinking!
review/text: I have two rat terriers, and they did not understand instantly what they had to do.  They actually had to think and use their powers of deductive reasoning to figure out how to get to the treats.  Their main drive in life is to eat, and then play, so this was perfect.  I loaded the treat compartments with their favorite chicken stick treats and then rotated the base and put the plastic puzzle pieces in.  It took them about 10-15 minutes of playing, barking and trying to get to the treats.  Eventually they figured out that the puzzle pieces ALL had to be removed before they could spin the base and reach their goal.  It was so much fun to watch.  Great toy Kyjen!<br /><br />This is a Social Writeup

Also since he is color blind like all dogs of course, the neon ball was very interesting to him. He rolled it around the house happily. The red part is great too because I can actually clean it unlike his other furry toys.

review/summary: Cattledog approved!
review/text: Great toy for short periods of observed play.  My adult cattledog figured out how to removed the ball almost immediately, while the puppy took several minutes.  Even so, they have not tired of playing the game.  After removing the ball quickly a few times, they will complicate the puzzle by tossing the cube around, batting at it with their paws, pouncing on it...and only then remove the ball.  They wait for me to put the ball back in, and wait until I tell them to "Go find".<br /><br />This is not for the dog who runs off with a toy and plays keep away, as the thin rubber "bars" of the cube could be easily chewed and ingested (my puppy had to be told not to chew it).  Of course, all of the Kyjen puzzle toys are designed to be enjoyed by dogs playing in the company of their owners.  They are excellent training tools for "wait", "go find", "give" and the concept of taking turns (one dog waits while the other finds).  I work my dogs on them for about 15 minutes, then put the toys away.  They stay new and exciting that way.

review/text: Our Lab puppy was able to figure out how to turn the red bar and left the dispenser lids, but the angle of the treat pod is such that she can't fit her snout, or manuvuer her tongue very well to get the food.  Even turning her snout sideways didn't help.  The idea has promise but unfortunately the design is lacking.  We'll keep trying but it doesnt really hold her interest since she can't get the reward.

Had to show him that there was something inside.  Does very well removing the cups now.  Timing him he is down to a little over 2 minutes.  You do have to show them how it works a few times if you don't have a super smart dog.

review/text: After purchasing the Kyjen 6 squeaker snake from PetsMart and realizing that it was a great toy I quickly looked up Kyjen online and found/purchased several other toys.  One of which was this treat wheel.  I have an American Bulldog/Chow mix who I think is pretty smart but I was still worried that she wouldn't be able to figure out the puzzle.  She figured out how to lift off the yellow cups fairly quickly but it took her a few tries to figure out how to spin the wheel.  She's got it down to an art now and loves playing with this puzzle.  I am also amazed at the fact that she has not destroyed/chewed any part of this puzzle as she has destroyed almost all of her other toys.  I would definitely recommend this product to others who want to challenge their dog.

As one of the other reviews stated, my small breed cannot get his mouth around the yellow pieces, but is able to get them off with abundant effort via scratching and using his nose. As smart as my lil guy is, he gets the yellow piece off and thinks his reward is being able to play with it. But it was his first attempt and we're working with him, showing him the treats are underneath. He was continuously excited and determined to figure out the game. I expect over time he'll get better with it and the learning process in itself is fun.

review/summary: I'm not saying my dog's a genious, but.....
review/text: The layers spin very easily and my 5 year old female weimaraner cleared each slot of hidden treats in less than a minute. If you nudge it gently it opens & aligns and as long as you don't bump it, it stays in place to eat each dish. I even tried to use it to feed her dinner to slow her down, but that didn't work at all--she aligned it once and ate out of it like a bowl. Bummer, I spent over $20 for a piece of plastic that will end up in a landfill. Stick with frozen kongs...

review/summary: Help pup "wise up"!
review/text: Great little toy for you an your pup to play with together. You'll be surprised how easily they get the hang of it, no matter how clueless they are at first! We play "treat wheel" about once a week so she doesn't get it too fast. We get down on the floor next to her and praise her as she plays with it. She really enjoys playing with it, and will try and get the food from it, even if she has a bowl of the same food right next to her!

review/summary: I'm Amazed
review/text: I was really skeptical as to whether my Jack Russell Terrier would even bother with this type of toy. But I put it down for her the day I got it and she spent a good 45 minutes playing with it, retrieving the food, and me refilling so she could play some more. That's an incredible length of time for her to spend on one activity. I'll be getting some more toys like this I think.

review/summary: Paw Flapper Fun, But Too Easy
review/text: I got my dog the Paw Flapper because he's a Basset Hound mix and loves to use his nose. He's also pretty smart, so keeping him occupied can be difficult. Unfortunately, this is a super simple puzzle. The first time he played with it, it took him about ten minutes to find all the treats. The next time, it took five minutes. There really isn't anything that challenging about it. Opening the flaps takes my dog a second, and all he has to do is keep pushing his nose into the holes to rotate the top and find all the treats. He had fun, but then it's a toy full of treats, so that's a given.<br /><br />The puzzle does seem to be well made though, so it's not a bad product. It just isn't challenging enough. I'll be returning it and trying one of the other puzzles.

review/summary: Reviews for the Treat triad, Paw Hide, and Star Spinner
review/text: Paw Hide- she sniffed a little and went straight to the covers and after she got one off trotted away like that was the prize! I showed her the treats and she proceeded to get them all. She figured it out pretty quick. I use it as a more challenging way of dispensing treats now.<br /><br />Star Spinner- she spun the thing and figured it out pretty quickly. Not much of a challenge there. Still, a fun way to dispense treats.<br /><br />Treat triad- this one was the most challenging, as it has 2 parts to it. She turned the red part around and then went to open the containers. Therein lies the rub. IMO, the container cover extends too far down so as to make it very difficult for her to grasp it with her mouth or her paw. She was unable to get a grip on it so she could not get to the treats. She didn't like this one.<br /><br />Overall, I don't find them to be that challenging, except for the Treat Triad but that one, I think, has a design flaw. Its not mentally challenging but physically so. I'm not sorry I got them but I expected more.

review/text: when I opened this, I thought no way my little Lhasa Apso is going to be able to play with this.  So wrong.  I stated with some yellow cups upside down (easier for her to grip them) with a few right side up.  She figured it all out very quickly.  It's lots of fun to watch her get the big yellow cups in her small grip, place them carefully all in one spot.  After a few times, she was able to grab all the cups placed in the red container the proper way.  She loves finding treats!

review/summary: Poorly constructed and designed
review/text: This is a review for the Treat Wheel by Kyjen. This is my second product with them and will most likely be my last as the other one had some design flaws as well. Overall, the concepts seem to be good, but there's always one glaring flaw and cheap materials/construction. This treat wheel is a good idea: pull out the "pegs" and find the treat then use your nose to push the wheel around until you find a secondary treat in another chamber. However, the execution is anything but good. First, the pegs are in too deep and with little (except a dangerously small hole to snag a nail) to grip except super slippery plastic. I tried myself to push and pull the item out of place, and it wouldn't budge (not surprising since 3/4 of it is "buried") and my dogs just grew frustrated and quit. I thought of using it without the pegs and just as a spinner but all the chambers are connected, and the top portion is so badly attached to the bottom that it wobbles about instead of spinning smoothly around. Plus, the chambers are so slick (all the toy being made of that same super slippery plastic) that the treat just slides around. And forget durability. I've seen Dollar Store toys constructed better. A medium to large dog could break this thing in one sitting.

review/summary: Moon Rover Rescue
review/text: This is a review for the Moon Rover Rescue toy.  While touted as one of their more durable toys, I found the plush toys to be more durable than this!<br /><br />I bought this as a replacement puzzle toy for one of my dogs, who adores plush toys and puzzle toys.  The second dog I have is more destructive and you really have to watch him with toys.  I was hopeful that the plastic would hold up better and the plush-lover would get more enjoyment out of his toy before it would get destroyed.<br /><br />The moon rover was much too difficult to get into (or out of) the moon; neither dog was able to retrieve it.  Within 30 minutes chunks of the moon were missing and the front part of the rover was chewed off as well.  Even though we're thorough, we were picking up chunks of blue plastic around the play area for a few days.  This purchase was a complete waste of $20.

review/summary: The Paw Hide is a great little toy.
review/text: Im out working in the daytime and feel real bad that my energetic pup is home bored to death! So finding this toy calmed my fear of doggy daytime boredom. It has seven (my favorite number) treat chambers that challenged my dog to lift each cup in order to reveal its prize!<br /><br />It is a must have when teaching the basics of eating obedience/command. It also taught him important problem-solving skills. I had to turn the pieces upside down at first because my dog smelled the treat through the space but cried because he was too inexperienced to figure out how to get it. I suggest this technique if this puzzle is too challenging for your dog; at least till they figure out how to successfully pull the piece off when turned the right way.<br /><br />The Non-skid pads on bottom is an amazing feature. I guess the makers knew mischievous dogs would push the entire toy around as an additional part of the game lol. Its base material is plastic which is perfect for washing. My dog chooses to use his teeth to pull up the pieces not his paw, so slob is usually all over this toy. I'm so glad it's plastic!<br /><br />Its a must have because it provides hours of fun, and I encourage anyone with a curious doggy to get one!!!

review/summary: Good Toy
review/text: I bought this as a birthday gift for my dog.  The plastic is pretty thin.  He loves tennis balls and playing fetch, so I thought it would be a great brain teaser.  He figured out how to lift the doors to get at the tennis ball, but when he goes to grab it, it ends up rolling back into the trunk and over to another hole.  Then he just gets irritated.  It slides easily on the hardwood floor, so he ends up pushing it around the room trying to get the ball out.  We put it on a rug to keep it from sliding around and then the doors don't open as easily.  I'm going to try to put some rubber slip grip stuff on the bottom to see if that helps keep it in place on the hardwood floor better.  He tries to dig the tennis ball out of the top opening since the doors don't work too well and then he ends up knocking the whole top portion off.

review/text: This adjustable puzzle toy is a good way to provide a challenging way for your dog to have treats.  It is fun for them if you just put one or two treats inside or many.  The rubber "feet" on the bottom do grip the floor somewhat which makes it more stable when the device is tightened up for extra challenge for your dog.  This is one of what could be many puzzle toys to entertain your dog.  My dog gets excited when I bring out a puzzle toy because he knows that with a little work, he gets a treat.

review/summary: Nice, basic addition to the collection...
review/text: I have a Fox/JRT/who-knows-what terrier mix who really enjoys puzzle toys, provided there is food in there to motivate him. I purchased both Kyjen's Triad and their Jigsaw Glider. My pooch went right for both, and my only (minor) complaint is that they're TOO easy.<br /><br />Forrest has mastered other treat toys, including the Aikou (done in under two minutes), and Nina Ottosson's Dog Magic and Tornado. With the Triad, he had the "spin" and "flip" mechanisms figured out in a few minutes. Keeping the flip doors open long enough to detract the treat, however, seemed to require some skill and practice. Not generally a "cheater", he finally resorted to flipping the whole unit upside down, to discover that doesn't work very well either, unless he kept rolling it over and over repeatedly. He did (during the initial test drive) get the hang of flipping the flap and keeping it up long enough to get his hard-fought reward. I may make mention that he has a long, narrow snout, and the patience of a saint once his tongue makes physical contact with food stuffs. A friend of mine has a young Border Collie/Karelian Bear Dog cross who is still figuring out all the parts to the Magic, so these Kyjen toys would be appropriate for him, as well as any dog just becoming familiar to puzzle toys, and learning how they work. It's also worth a mention that if you're not willing to sacrifice peace and quiet for your dog's amusement, do not purchase. Nor if you have squeaky-wheel neighbors living below your hard wood floors... unless they're out of town.<br /><br />My terrier has a short attention span, in that if it's TOO hard, he loses interest after a while. Not one for extreme challenges. Nina Ottosson's Twister is still a "project in the works", and not one I would recommend for first-timers and beginners. Kyjen's Triad and Glider are not in this category. For the money, I'm happy to add them to his collection. I just fill 'em all up at once, and let the racket commence!

She's learned that it won't usually be in the last place I stop - but in which other one? Dogs are as different as the rest of us, but seems to me that only a rather slow dog or a lovable-but-dumb one would find this toy mentally challenging after the first time or two.  I give it three stars for their sakes.

review/summary: Cattledogs love it!
review/text: This is one great toy!  My busy, mouthy Cattledogs like it so much they will ask to play with it, sitting and staring at it on the shelf where it's stored.  When they first got the toy, it took them just a minute or two to get their mouths around the squirrel, but it took a couple days of play periods for them to figure out how to pull it out of the hole (it's a tight fit).  I let them play with the squeaky squirrel for a few minutes, then put it back in and say, "Go find".  They love it, and will throw the "stump" around and thrash it back and forth, extending the game.<br /><br />While the toy is very durable, it is suitable only for observed play, as the chewy rubber of the exterior could be ingested.  All the  Kyjen toys are made for interactive play, but it's a point that must be stressed: these are not chew toys.  The other thing to keep in mind is the amount of dog slobber all that "Go find" spreads around.  You may want to confine the play to a room that is easily mopped.

But after a couple good retrievals the older dog looked at me as if to say, "Are you kidding me?", inserted a toenail into the top hole of this thing, and flipped it over to get the treat.  I'm going to try gluing it to a board so he can't cheat.  But overall, I'd say this is for very small dogs or slow ones.

review/summary: Rocky loves this Squeaky Rover
review/text: Rocky loves all types of squeaky toys but this one is the best, he has hours of fun trying to get the rover out of the moon ball. Whenever i have guests i let rocky play with the moon ball and the rover. It keeps him occupied for hours. Its perfect for little dogs with lots of energy. Rocky has little paws that way he can stick his paws in the moon ball and retrieve the rover. Its easy to clean unlike other squeaky toys just wash with water and let dry and its ready to keep him occupied and lets me entertain my guests.

review/summary: My dog seems to like this puzzle
review/text: I have a beagle and we have never bought a doggy puzzle for him before, so I was looking for something easy and also something that would make him use his great sense of smell. This puzzle is perfect! Although he figured it out in about 10 seconds, it is something that can be reused over and over again due to the 4 treat chambers. He never knows exactly where the treat went and sometimes I sneak one in while he's not looking, so later he will catch scent of it and retrieve it. It's very entertaining for both of us and I will definitely buy more dog puzzles in the future.

review/summary: My dog loves this!
review/text: My dog usually inhales his food and then gets an upset stomach.  Then, he barfs.  This feeder keeps him busy for 10-15 minutes, which is long enough to prevent the upset stomach.  Two big thumbs up!

review/summary: Sooooo good and fast
review/text: What more can you ask for, these are the best cream egga since I was a kid.  My mom always got us a cream filled egg for our Easter.  Even whan I was in Vietnam she managed to get one to me!  The only thing I could have wished for to make them perfect would have been a yellow yolk.  Oh well, the taste brought back such wondeerful memories that I would have paid twice the price to get the quality.  They are wonderful.  I seldon write reviews, but these needed swomeone to say how good they are.  One word of caution, the shipping and handling fee is steep, so I checked to see how much more it cost for "expedited" and since it was only a buck more for the 6 eggs I ordered, I went with that and sure enough the arrived much faster.  This is the third order I have made with them in two years and their quality has been very consistant!!  If they are not hand made they sure look and taste like they are.  When I run out, I will be ordering more, even if it isn't Easter.  I hope they will stil make them up for me.  I can't put a price on the wonderful memories of my Mom that they brought back.

review/summary: Spacon - it's as good as Bacon
review/text: My family LOVES Spam, and of all it's variations (Spicy, Garlic, Cheesy, Plain, etc) - Hickory Smoke is by FAR the best. If you're not sold on the idea of Spam, try this Spacon recipe:<br /><br />Start with some Hickory Smoke Spam and slice it thin - about the width of an individual sugar packet. Cut those slices lengthwise, so you have long, thin strips like bacon. Pour a little olive oil in a cast iron skillet and get it nice and hot. Fry your Spam slices until they're nice and crispy on both sides, then remove to a paper towel. Serve with eggs, hashbrowns, or whatever your favorite breakfast foods are. It tastes like bacon, but more crispy and less fatty (and much lower in calories).<br /><br />It also makes great sandwiches: Slice thicker, about 1/4 inch, lightly fry it with some Pam/non-stick spray and set it on Rye bread with lettuce, tomato, and Smoked Paprika Mayo (just mayo mixed with smoked paprika). Delicious!!!<br /><br />Also, if you're a fan of smokers and BBQ, try sticking a block of Spam in the smoker with your brisket, pork butt, and ribs. It's unlike anything you've ever tasted.<br /><br />Really - if you love pork, there's absolutely no reason NOT to love Hickory Smoke Spam.

review/text: SPAM Smoked Flavored, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)Great tasting, if not particularly healthy, convenient, versatile product. Moderation will be the key to enjoying it without much guilt. Cans arrived in carton of mixed flavors of same product, a number of which were damaged and leaking. Amazon replaced ALL, even undamaged ones, quickly. Hats off to Customer Service with a wish for Packing and Shipping to greatly improve techniques so as to avoid annoyed customers and sheer waste.

review/summary: Frat Boys Favorite
review/text: Sent three flavors of Spam as a joke to our sons Fraternity House where most had not even heard of the product, other than in their email, and it turned out to be a big hit. All the boys are hooked and Spam is no longer a dirty word with them. The Hickory Smoke was their favorite followed by the Low Salt Spam. We sent them a waffle iron, waffle mix and real Vermont maple syrup to round out a breakfast. We got 30 thumbs up from them and requests for more.

review/summary: Not really a significant difference in taste...
review/text: I cannot find this variety of SPAM at the local grocery store, and I'm surrounded by food snobs. I just happen to have grown up with luncheon pork meat and love to eat Hawaiian musubi. I tried the original version and wanted to try the varieties I only see on the manufacturer's website, so I ordered this. I still like musubi, but I understand I don't need to eat musubi every day, and I don't need to have this particular flavor. The original will do. I just wish the food snobs would stay away from me. I'm not sharing my SPAM with anyone snobbish anyway...

review/summary: Camping tradition at its best
review/text: What do you think of foodwise when you go camping? well besides the case of beer, you have the dogs and the marshmallows! Nothing like roasting these suckers over an open fire, or just pop them in your mouth from the bad. Soft, and fluffy, these suckers don't get hard and stale as quickly as other brands do. Definately a great product.

review/summary: I've eaten these for 15 years
review/text: I have been eating these pepperonis for 15 years.  I have had two go bad in storage but that is not Bridgford's fault.  They store for a year or more at room temperature if you keep them in a cool room but if one gets a puncture in the wrapper or exposed to too much heat, etc., then all bets are off.  If the wrapper is still vacuum tight and the expiration date has not passed, then it should be fine.  If the wrapper is loose at all or the product has expired then, yes, you might have one that is bad.  If it is as bad as some here describe then it is my guess they are eating spoiled food.  Not smart.  But in 15 years of eating these, I have only thrown out two for spoilage and that is after having stored them for quite a while.<br /><br />These do have more fat (and more flavor) than bagged pepperoni.  They do make great pizza but you will have a hard time slicing them as thin and even as some big factory - so just don't expect the exact look, feel, and taste.  These are still delicious in their own right.<br /><br />I have to laugh about reviews from folks who eat seemingly spoiled food and then say that anyone who likes this must work for Bridgford. No, I do not work for Bridgford.  I just eat their products.

review/summary: Great if you like solid/dry meat snacks.
review/text: I eat this like a summer sausage with cheese crackers. I'm a fan of meat snacks like beef jerky and summer sausage.<br /><br />I know that this is meant to be used as a pizza topping but all the summer sausages I have tried lately are very moist almost like Spam or potted meat. I like a more dry summer sausauge so I thought I'd try this.<br /><br />This is very dry and solid. This is a plus for me.<br /><br />If you eat it in thick pieces like I do, it has a grainy quality to it. The spices are very strong, distinct, and unique.<br /><br />Where this loses points is the pepperoni casing that surrounds the pepperoni. In most sausages, the casing is so thin that you can't even taste it or know it's there.<br /><br />The casing on this is thick and it tastes similiar to wax paper.<br /><br />I don't think I'd buy this again even to use on pizzas. It will take me a long time to use the two sticks I have left.<br /><br />It's a decent product but just not good to use as a meat snack. It's not worth buying it for pepperoni on a pizza, either, for me. I'll just stick to Hormel for that.

review/text: This is great pepperoni, but it's not for everyone. If you're tired of buying the limp tasteless mush they package precut in bags at the grocery store, this is what you should buy. It's good seared, baked, and raw. We've served it frequently with cheese and crackers. Many guests (but not all) appreciate the bold flavor. For a pack of three and with a subscription, this price can't be beat. It'll last you a good long while.<br /><br />(Just make sure to cut off the casing before eating!)

review/summary: Haven't order online yet, but this is abolutely the BEST!
review/text: The person with the negative view must have received pepperoni that had accidentally been punctured at some point. Something is definitely wrong. I have been eating this pepperoni for over 30 years and it is fantastic! Thirty years ago, my brother convinced me to put some slices of the pepperoni in my spaghetti sauce; it was outrageously good. I have used it ever since--me and my entire family.<br /><br />I even eat it "raw" (can't be raw or it wouldn't keep). It's one of my primary snacks on the Atkins (and I've lost 25 lbs). I hope the nay-sayers try it one more time--they are missing out.<br /><br />The super Wal-Marts sell it and they are always running out. And by the way, I live in Sacramento and I'm an instructor at a college; don't work for Bridgeford! I'm only online because Wal-Mart runs out so fast (just came from there) and I would like to buy a large supply I can count on. Actually, I have two, inch and ahalf pieces that I've hid from my husband in the fridge. I guess I'm addicted!

review/summary: As expected.
review/text: Haven't bought this online, just at the supermarket.<br />It's good on homemade pizza. Thick slices are amazing. Just peel off the casing or it warps the pepperoni into a concave dome that pools the fat. And there's TONS of fat.<br /><br />Another tip would be to put the cuts on paper towels then nuke them. Good to get rid of as much grease as you can.<br /><br />LOL at the people eating them "raw" and giving it a negative review. What the hell are you expecting?<br />This isn't a sausage stick to eat like you just bought from a gas station.<br />The fat content is way too high be to eaten plain. Add chunks to a soup, bread, whatever.
