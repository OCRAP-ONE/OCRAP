review/text: very diappointing flavor.  I thought Timothys made fine coffees, but skip this one.  You might as well get unflavored coffee, since you can't taste any vanilla in this one.  I am trying another brand next time- Gloria Beans, perhaps?

review/summary: Way too strong for me
review/text: I love Timothy's coffee pods, so when I bought a Keurig, naturally I bought Timothy's.  I bought two flavored coffees but they are way too bold and strong for a morning coffee drinker.  I am now trying Gloria Jean, Emeril and Caribou, looking for a pleasant morning cup.  I may consider opening up the K-cups to see if I can dump the contents into a toddy maker, I hate to toss these, but find them unpleasantly harsh.

review/text: After using French Vanilla creamer in other coffees, I made the jump to French Vanilla coffee.  What a mistake.  Definitely not the same.  Not even close.  This coffee is weak and the french vanilla flavor is barely noticeable to me.  Ended up pitching the rest and going with that amazing Italian Blend, also by Timothy's.

Having our Keurig has really made a big difference for us in being able to have the drink we want and not having the aftertaste of the other when we brew a cup.<br />I highly recommend The Keurig and Timothy's K-cups in the tea as well as the coffee flavors.<br />My mother is getting a Keurig from my sister and me for her 73rd birthday this month.<br />If you purchase, sign up for the automatic shipments.  It is much cheaper and the boxes are 24 count. The boxes at a local store are only 18 count boxes.

review/summary: Melt in Your Mouth Delicious!
review/text: "Bounty" bars consist of a soft, almost molten center of sweet coconut coated in an outer layer of milk chocolate. You can easily buy them "over the counter" here in Australia. But if that's not the case where you are, and you don't mind a diet rich in junk food, then yes, this is a candy bar worth going to the trouble of ordering over the internet.<br /><br />Note that here on Amazon you can purchase bounty bars in boxes with varying numbers of bars inside, so it is worth your while to crunch the numbers and think about what package offers the best value for you. At the same time, it may not be entirely in the best interests of your health to have _too_ many of these things lying around at home all at once!<br /><br />Theo.

Amazon is in the process of sending me the Mars Bounty Coconut bars that I originally ordered. Hope I get the right order this time. I will let you know when it arrives if it is the right item. It seems their packaging recently has been really poor, with no protective packaging on the product, or the wrong product altogether. I order a lot from Amazon and am a Prime customer.

review/summary: very good dried beef, but WHY so much?
review/text: This dried beef makes great creamed chipped beef. One can buy it in supermarkets in Philadelphia, or in Maryland and Delaware, but not apparently here in Connecticut. (I guess the managers here suppose not enough people would know what to do with it.) However, on the Amazon.com site a shipment costs nearly $120 plus almost $25 shipping. That must be one hell of a lot of product! Too bad it can't be bought in, say, lots of 10 of the small packages (about 5 oz. each) as they are sold in supermarkets. What retail customer not doing a fund-raiser is going to want that much?

review/summary: Great Mix of High Protein, Low Fat and Low Carbs - and it's Turkey, not fish!
review/text: First and foremost, I cannot stress how important it is to feed your cat an all canned food diet - cats do not have a drive for thirst, so only a canned food diet will keep them correctly hydrated [diabetes, urine crystal free].<br /><br />Important to learn: if you feed your cat all wet diet, they only need to drink 1oz of water a day to keep fully hydrated.  If you feed your cat an all dry diet, they need to drink 7oz of water to keep hydrated.  That's a full cup of water!<br /><br />Second, cat food must be high in protein, high to low in fat [depending if you want your cat to be lean], and have no more than 10% carbs.  Dry foods are 30% plus percent carbs. Diabetes is rampant in older cats, and it's recommended to keep their carb intake at 5-10%.<br /><br />You should feed grain-free diet and feed meat from feathered birds, not beef, never fish.  Grain free almost always means high fat, so be careful if you want to keep your cats lean and healthy.<br /><br />I feed this Fancy Feast formula, plus Merrick's cowboy cookout or grammy pot pie [grain free, low fat], plus wellness turkey and chicken formulas [grain free, low protein, high fat].  I use Fancy Feast to entice the cat then they eat whatever else is in their dish [wellness, etc].  Grain free food, while great for them, doesn't really taste great.<br /><br />This formula is:<br />56% protein<br />33% fat<br />10% carbs<br />74 calories per can

Instead, I received 8 boxes of the Primavera Medleys. This contains three different kinds of cat food one of which is fish.  I have a cat that is prone to bladder infections anytime she eats fish.  Normally, I would return an order that wasn't correct.  However, my cat is hungry and would like to eat!!  So I have 12 cans of wasted cat food.  When I reviewed my order, I discovered that this company was under review for problems with orders.  Thanks, Amazon.  I would have liked to have known that before I ordered this product from you again!!!!!!!!  :(

review/summary: Delicious But SALTY
review/text: I absolutely love Chicago-style cheese and caramel popcorn like Garrett's.  So, feeling a craving for the stuff, I decided to try this gourmet cheddar cheese popcorn.  It was delicious, but very salty.  The cheese is also not the same quality of stuff that they use in the better Chicago popcorn shops.  Frankly, it didn't taste as cheesy and a bit fake.  The popcorn itself was quite fresh though.<br /><br />All in all, I guess if you're desperate for some gourmet-esque popcorn, this stuff is good.  However, in my book, it doesn't compare to the real, fresh gourmet popcorn shops' stuff.

review/text: I tried the variety pack of the popconopolis from Amazon. Really liked all of it except for the cheese. For my taste the cheese was way too salty. If you thought Cheese Doodles gave you orange fingers, you should have seen my fingers after eating some of this. The coating seemed to be a fine powder that really caked onto my fingers. Also, with this one cone the popcorn had no crunch...seemed stale. Maybe this was just a bad or outdated cone. I love my junkfood, but actually threw away a small portion of the cone. One of those things I asked myself, why did I eat that much? I wasn't enjoying it.

This popcorn is unreal... if you like pecans and caramel popcorn you will LOVE this. I still<br />have a hard time figuring out how they make it so good but whatever they are doing they are doing it<br />right!  It is fresh and crunchy - PERFECT for a late night snack and a cuppa decaf coffee, feels like<br />you are eating something super sinful yet it isn't too bad for ya.<br />Can't beat the price either! I sent this to my mother in law as her mothers day gift and she was super<br />thrilled - she actually hinted to us that she wanted this because we had sent them a 5 pack sampler and<br />this one was her favorite.<br />She said she hid them where noone else can find them.<br />Hope this review helps.... I am also in hopes that the chocoloate zebra will be available on Amazon too...<br />That one is amazing as well  :0)<br />PS: The cheese one is softer and kind of stale even though the flavor IS something to write home about -<br />don't get it unless you don't mind it stale-ish. Also the husks can get annoying in the cheese kind.

I've tried a few flavors and decided their Caramel and Cheddar Cheese (both white and regular) are for me, the best flavors.  The caramel is much better than any of the others I've tried at my local grocery.

review/text: A co-worker brought this popcorn to share.  We couldn't believe how good is was!  He finds it at Costco.  I don't have time to shop stores so I immediately went to Popcornopolis.com and placed an order for a variety of flavors.  Everything was awesome!  I'm a frequent Amazon shopper but just today thought to search for it here.  Amazon offers it much cheaper but the selection is limited.  Don't hesitate to try this popcorn!

review/summary: Cheeeeeesy popcorn!  But read here first.....
review/text: This is great tasting popcorn... First tried it at our local blockbuster DVD store but then went direct to the Popcornopolis website and ordered direct - the big cones.  At Blockbuster and direct from Popcornopolis it was fresh and crunchy but for some odd reason this tasted a bit stale from the very first.  The flavor is amazing and just a large handful will satisfy that salty craving but it may be a bit stale if u get it from amazon... I do highly recommend Popcornopolis though... It IS the BEST popcorn you can get and we've tried a lot! The pecan and zebra is unreal too.  I recommend giving it a try at your local blockbuster first then their direct website. They have a nice array of yummy addicting flavors - we've gotten many many friends and family addicted to it and it makes a great gift if shipped direct from Popcornopolis- they have neat packages.  (by the way... The candied ones tend to be fresher from the beginning and last a long time!)

review/summary: Best Cheddar Popcorn EVER!!!
review/text: I consider myself a foodie and am always trying to find the best of everything.  I tried Dale and Thomas popcorn when it was one of Oprah's favorite things and yes, it was good.  My local Costco store had the Popcornopolis people in-store for a few days and I was IMPRESSED.  The zebra (white and dark chocolate drizzled) was really great but the cheddar was like none other I have ever tasted.  WOW.  It has to be good if it says "Why is this popcorn so good?" on the back of the bag with an explanation.  Oh and two thumbs up for the perfectly sized, individually sealed cones.  I can eat one cone in one sitting (and they aren't tiny!) and can stop there.  It is a good limit-setter.  :)

review/text: I just bought the Zebra flavor after sampling at a holiday booth. The sample had chocolate drizzled on each piece.  False representation. The actual bag contains few pieces with chocolate. (less than 10& of pieces have chocolate) It looks and tastes like Crunch 'n Munch or Cracker Jacks.  If you're looking for gourmet popcorn, this is not it.

review/summary: Love this
review/text: I have made yogurt on and off for years and this is by far the easiest way. I highly recommend this. No advance planning, muss or fuss required. I start it before I go to work in the morning. It only takes 3 minutes to make the yogurt from my end, the longest part is waiting for the water to boil for the container. Very quick and very easy! When I come home it is done and all I have to do is refrigerate it for the next morning. The yogurt is delicious and I've even made my own yogurt (from scratch) and it worked well. There are web sites that tell you how, if you are interested in doing this. The packets usually come in groups of 3 and are available on line or in stores. It is new to the USA so unfortunately, not many stores are carrying it as yet. I think that will change as people discover how great this system it and how delicious and fresh the yogurt is. Hopefully (Hint to Easiyo) they will sell the packets individually too.  Really, I love this product.

review/text: I first came into contact with the EasiYo yogurt maker staying with friends for a month in NZ. I could not believe how easy it was to make yogurt and it was better than any yogurt that I had tasted before!! I bought the maker while in NZ and only four packets of the low fat greek to bring home. I thought that of course I could find it in the USA and my local health food store knew what I was talking about. The owner has one too and has tried to get a francise to carry it in her store to no avail. Bad NZ! It would make it so much easier to enjoy. Anyway as I said it's so easy to make, so delicious and smooth to eat, that anyone that likes yogurt, I guarantee you'll love this product. Hopefully NZ will let go and allow it to be carried in the USA!!

review/text: I actually found this yogurt maker in a thrift store in Auckland last year.  I wasn't sure at the time if I was making a good decision, because it took up a LOT of room in my suitcase to get it back to the States.  But, oh my gosh -- I love this thing.  First, making the yogurt is so easy, and the Easiyo packets are the best.  The yogurt is *very* creamy, and just so fresh when it's homemade.  It's those NZ cows!  Second, I love not having all the additional sugars in my yogurt.  Third -- it is cheaper than buying yogurt in the store!  I actually use some of the yogurt from the batch I make to use as starter for the next batch.  So, one packet of yogurt actually makes two batches for me.  Just delicious--- you will love it!!  In NZ, my friend made meringues, added dollops of yogurt and fresh fruit -- just the best dessert ever!

review/summary: Plastic jar makes me nervous, quart glassjar substitute breaks
review/text: If only the jar inside were not plastic, which makes me nervous, especially with boiling water potentially leaching toxic compounds.  But a quart glass jar will break from the shock of the difference between the cold contents and boiling water.  If you try to use warm water to prevent the glass from breaking, warm, 95 F water added to the starter causes it to gel into lumps.  This will help prevent the jar from breaking, and the yogurt turns out okay, but after that, when you transfer a quarter cup for the next batch and add milk, you'd better not heat the milk up too hot, keep an eye on it.<br /><br />One of the reasons I bought this yogurt maker was that it was less of a hassle and used less energy, but the workaround to avoid the plastic container is a bit annoying.  Wish they made a metal jar, if that's possible...

I spilled a little outside trying to get the sprayer to work and ultimately ended up transferring it to another bottle I had layout around the house. It smells awful, but works great. Even the area where I spilled it has been squirrel free, so the birds have been free to enjoy the feeders without squirrels stealing the food. This stuff works great, and is all-natural and rated for organic gardening, which I was thrilled about too, since I make a point not to spray chemicals on my lawn.

review/text: The Inglehofer Cranberry Mustard is a delightful balance between sweet and spicy. It is perfect for turkey and mixed with diet mayonnaise in chicken salad. The tiny size jar is perfect for stocking stuffers or hostess gifting. I would like a larger size for everyday use.

review/summary: My dogs love them!  I think the value, not so much.
review/text: I have two Jack Russell Terriers and they simply love Bully Sticks!  We have "bone day" on Saturday mornings and this is the bone they have come to love and to expect each Saturday morning.  The only thing that buyers should be aware of is the "regular" bully stick is really, really skinny.  My two medium breed dogs finish them in about 5 minutes.  In my past purchases of Bully Sticks from other retailers, I have come to expect that "regular" size is more like about a 1/2" to 3/4" in diameter.  These regular ValueBull Bully Sticks are more like 1/4" to 1/2" in diameter and I probably would not have considered them to be such a "value" had this size been established.  They are however, 6" in length.  The dogs still love them, but this was not the deal I thought I was getting.

review/summary: Tiny, Tiny,Tiny
review/text: If you are talking ounces you would be better off getting a 12 pack for 19.99 at petsmart. These are tiny. They are only as big as a pencil in diameter one way. They are flat and about half pencil size the other. I do not even know if they are truely pizzle sticks as the ingredients only say beef chews. I personally never saw a cow with a pizzle this small! Must be calf ones.<br />I have small dogs so I am sure they will love them. They did come on time and were boxed appropriately. But for $50.00 it is not worth the price! As a shopper for dog treats for over 30 years these are worth about $25-$30.00 if you compare to whats out in the regular pet stores. Won't purchase again.

review/text: Very few of the sticks are the actual size shown. Many of them were as wide as a straw! It took my dog less than 1 minute to chew it up (the Regular size ones take him 15 minutes). Also, they were of all different widths - nowhere near as consistent as shown in the picture. A complete waste of $$.

review/text: Although these bully sticks measure 6" they are by far thinner than others on the market.  I am slightly disappointed in this product and I don't think I'd buy these again.  On the plus they are all natural and my dog does love them.  However, I'd rather pay the extra $10 for the thicker sticks.

review/summary: Scented crystals are great!
review/text: I've always been a fan of crystals in the litterbox, and the fact that these are scented really is great!  My basement does not smell like cat, while at the same time, the smell is not so strong that my cat refuses to go in the litterbox.  My cat must use the litterbox more than others, because I've never had the experience of one bag lasting a month.  It lasts two weeks (non-scented used to be 10 days).<br /><br />They are also pretty good at not tracking all over the place.<br /><br />I use the subscribe & save option to make this even cheaper, but I found that it was already 20% less than 7 lbs of "high quality" crystals  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HWE6F0">Ultra Pet Cat Litter Pearls (Original) Crystal Clear, 7-Pound Package</a> and not too much more expensive than the bulk stuff <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ML1OK">Clear Choice Silica Crystals Cat Litter Pail, 12-Pound</a>.

review/text: Target no longer sells my most economical and favorable cat crystals, however, though these are about a 3rd more expensive, my cats love it and so do I. Odors are kept to a minimum and clean up is fairly simple. It will never be a pleasurable task, but, my cats rarely go a day without having their litter box cleaned.

Nice and bright, works great with "electronic" gadget cakes (xbox, cell phone, etc.) makes them look like they're all powered up.  Great with airbrush--little bit goes a long way, but also works well for painting on tiny details.  This set would be great for anyone looking to take their cakes to the next level.

review/summary: Well worth tasting.
review/text: I tried this on a whim at the local health food store. I am completely enamored with the product.  I serve it with Bosc pears and it has been a hit.  The crisp sweet of the pear with the tangy and creamy taste of the chocolate goat cheese is a marvelous opposing match. I give the cheese high marks as a dessert cheese. Others must like it where I live because I have to reserve the log or logs before they are sold out.

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: After having been diagnosed with a thyroid nodule, which later turned out to be cancer, I thought I had better try to get more iodine in my and my family's diet.  After researching some, I found that Dulse is a great natural source of iodine.  I tried a package of this, and found that it is pretty good.  The package came with a suggestion to stir-fry it a few minutes in a hot skillet, to make it like "chips", which I tried.  I and my family enjoyed it much better that way.  The quality of this dulse is great, and the price seemed comparable with others I could find.  I ordered more of this, and am using it as a regular supplement to our diet.

For myself, I like the taste so use large pieces, but for those who don't care for the taste, I grind it into a powder using a coffee grinder, and then add it to the dish.  That way the nutrition is there without the taste.  I also like this company's kombu.

review/summary: Tasty Asian instant coffee
review/text: On a recent trip to Asia, I fell in love with this coffee.  More like a coffee-flavored sweet beverage, these combine lots of sugar, lots of cream, and some instant coffee into one delivery vehicle.  It's a sweet, warm comfort drink with the need for nothing more than hot water and a container.  Quick, easy, and tasty.  Also, cheap.<br /><br />Note that these are not for American sized 24oz cups.  These are for actual 1-cup cups.  If you use too large of a vessel, it will taste watered down.

review/text: I enjoyed this coffee because all the elements that I enjoy are included.  It has just the right amount of creamer and sugar.  I am working overseas where it is difficult to get things so this was perfect.  The first time I ordered it came perfectly packaged.  The second time it came in an open box and it appear that extra sticks were placed in the box to make up for the missing ones in the open package.  On top of that the box was open and held together by a string.  A STRING.  It apparently was shipped directly from Thailand.  I will make sure I know where my purchases are coming from in the future.  Over all this is a great product but the shipping is questionable.

review/text: After staying in SE Asia for a while, I found these in the supermarket and boy, was I impressed. Even my husband, who typically likes his coffee strong, started swiping my Nescafe coffee packets. They're easy, they dissolve perfectly and are delicious. Just the right sweetness and coffee taste, in my opinion. It makes me wonder what Nestle is thinking not offering these little gems in the States. The price overseas for this 30 pk bag is about $3. I am in sticker shock at the nearly $17 price tag and refuse to pay that much. They're good but I'll stick with the Vinacafe which we've found locally, until the price drops for Nescafe.

review/summary: Heaven, nostalgic is what i think of and feel when i 1st drank this coffee.
review/text: I i was born and raised in west Africa half of my life. and i grew up drinking coffee and tea we grew ourselves. so Nescafe brand has been part of my unforgetable childhood, after i came to America i find it extremely hard to drink the coffee here, because its too strong for me and i can get easily addicted to the caffeine, which is bad news for me cause i don't like being dependent on anything that i can control or stop. so i gave up on coffee and stick to my tea and hot chocolate. recently my THai roommate in college gave me a pack of these coffee after coming back home from winter break, i told her that i dont' drink coffee anymore, but then i started to work night shift at the hospital and need to stay awake since im not use to working at night. so one day i drank this coffee praying that i wont get addicted to it, and i swear i almost cried, because it gave me that nostalgic feeling i have been craving and searching for the past 10 yrs. the coffee is not at all too strong, nor too light its just perfect, it has creamer which i love n sugar but i add more sugar because i have a sweet tooth. overall you will NOT be disappointed if you buy this product.
