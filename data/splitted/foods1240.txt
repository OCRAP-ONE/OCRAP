review/summary: Great for salads, but watch the pricing!
review/text: I love garbanzos in salads, and the Libby's garbanzos are pretty decent. Watch the pricing, however. In my experience, generic garbanzos are also pretty good, and I can often get the Budh's brand of garbanzos gor 99 cents. So unless the price for 12 cans is $12-13, these may not be the best buy around.<br /><br />Amazon Prime customers, of course, do get the benefit of having these delivered to our doorstep in two days or so. And it's nice to let someone else do the toting on these cans. So that alone may make paying something of a premium a good idea.

review/summary: The Best Among the Best...
review/text: Having tried most of the Lindt chocolates I can say that this is the best one if you are into dark chocolate - it even beats those round ones which are also amazing. And I have to say that these are not so easy to find... the only other place I found them was at Target. The interior of the chocolate is soft and moist and is basically one of the best chocolate bars I have ever tasted - I've just ordered 24 bars (they come in packs of 12)!!! And the other benefit is that dark chocolate is better for you than milk chocolate and the 60% is tastier than the 70% which is also great. Basically you can't go wrong with Lindt.

review/text: The original thought was nice - a high tea at home with friends and an impressive tin of French Tea biscuits; now imagine the thought of watching from your airline seat while the luggage handlers drive over your luggage with the baggage cart and tow motor- several times!  The latter image is reality when you buy these tins for $35 per tin, plus FedEx shipping.  It was unrealistic to expect thin dry cookies to travel the world, across the US, stored in countless warehouses, handled by brutes of all persuasion, and literally dropped at my front door, and arrive fresh, whole, intact, and delicious just in time for high tea.

review/summary: We really gave them a breathtaking surprise!
review/text: The son is abroad and surprises us with the sudden news that he and his fianc&eacute;e have decided to get married the following week, however, the big celebration will be some months later with all the relatives present, of course. Now what can you do when you're tied in Germany and your kid and his bride walk into Boston townhall to commit themselves to each other? There must be some gesture, some sign of "We're thinking of you and we wish you all the luck and happiness in the world". We decided to give this sign with flowers. Now, that's a rather difficult thing to do when donor and recipient are thousands of miles apart. We love giving flowers as a present. What can be more beautiful than a bouquet of fragrant roses? But we'd really like to SEE the flowers ourselves before giving the present to the couple. Well, we solved the problem by ordering 40 Stems of White Spray Roses by SPRING IN THE AIR to be delivered on the morning of the wedding date. And it worked out just fine: the roses were delivered to the house on time, they were absolutely beautiful and fresh (the bride took photos and sent them to us), the couple was delighted, and the bouquet lasted for more than ten days - the couple even took them along on their short honeymoon trip and back home. Thank you for excellent service and super quality. We will certainly use SPRING IN THE AIR again in the future.

review/summary: Cure for the Cold
review/text: One of the things mothers are really good at is oatmean (or cream of wheat).  It was so much the salvation of my misspent pre-adolescence that I still often experience spontaneous regression when eating it - with raisins, brown sugar, and milk thank you!  It was only much later that I discovered that there was an expensive, gourmet version of my cheap old breakfast.  Expensive here, I mean.  If you are across the ocean they only get this kind of money in posh hotels.<br /><br />Even though that be the case, steel cut, old fashioned oatmeal really has a taste and texture of its own one worth pursuing if you want to have your comfort food and luxuriate in it at the same time.  You can make darned good cookies out of it too.  I'm not addicted to this, but it adds a little variety and comes with all the innate healthiness that oats seem to have.

I've gotten Milo in cans forever, but I ordered these bc of the jar, which I thought would take less room on a shelf. Other than the misleading picture, the product was as usual, packed well and shipped fast. Milo mixes best if you warm up a bit of milk first, mix in the powder (and sugar if you like it sweet), then add the rest of the milk. Otherwise the chocolate doesn't melt as well.

They are very convenient because I basically live at school six months out of the year. We put them in the microwave (sans lid of course) for about two minutes and then add the spice packet and vegetable packet. I used to only use about half the spice packet, silly me. Now I use the whole thing because these bowls are just so good with all of the spice! On top of being a really excellent deal, we can eat them being vegetarians without worrying about any hidden ingredients. Definitely worth purchasing.

If you like spicy soups this is a good soup for you.  Since then I have had one of these soups at least once or twice a week. They are great because you can pack these as a lunch on the go or if you do not have much time at home you can just boil some water and have a very good soup in a few minutes.  I would definitely recommend these soups to everyone.  They are spicy but not so spicy that you will go running for water. Just a small kick just to let you know it is there.

review/text: I used to live in Costa Rica and I miss it very much. I noticed that the majority of Costa Rican cookbooks in English instruct the cook to use Worcestershire sauce instead of authentic Salsa Lizano from Costa Rica. Salsa Lizano is used in an extraordinary number of Costa Rican dishes, and it's used as a condiment with many others. I was excited to see that I could buy it on Amazon, as it's not easy to find elsewhere. I highly recommend it for all of your Costa Rican recipes. It also goes well with many American recipes, like steak, chicken, and anything that you'd use A1 or Worcestershire sauce with. I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Great flavor enhancer
review/text: This product is a staple in Costa Rica.  It is found on practically every restaurant table and in most homes.  It adds a great flavor to any food, especially soups and poultry.  It is not a "hot sauce" but a flavor-enhancing table condiment which is used much like Maggi sauce is used in Europe and the rest of Latin America.  If this Costa Rican company had the marketing resources of Nestle (Maggi's owner) it would probably displace it internationally.<br />Try it!

review/summary: Favorite Torani flavor so far
review/text: I drink coffee every day so I've taken to ordering different Torani flavors, and I hope to try them all. So far of the ones I've sampled, (Chocolate Milano, Butterscotch, Cheesecake, Salted Caramel, Toasted Marshmallow, and Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough) this one is definitely my favorite! The flavor does remind me quite a bit of cookie dough, which is a pleasant surprise because sometimes the intended flavor doesn't quite hit the taste notes it was going for. I will definitely be ordering more of this in the future!

It doesnt make it very fesable to use in my shop when it costs me twice as much as other flavors to get.

review/summary: The Best Yet!!
review/text: We have an 18 year old Siamese that has had hairball issues her whole life. We have tried every suggestion our vet has made, invested in most of the hairball products out there. Prior to the IAMS Adult Hairball Care, we used the regular IAMS hairball formula. It did the job, but this new Proactive Health Adult formula appears to work more gently, therefore, she seems to be more comfortable and the throwing up hairballs has stopped almost entirely. It is also interesting to find out that when given a couple dry foods, side by side, that she will always go to this one. We have fed our cat this product since it made an appearance in our area a few months ago and the convenience of getting it through Amazon is a bonus!!

review/summary: Healthiest cat ever
review/text: A while back, when my cat was around seven years old, I noticed he was starting to drink more water.  I know what that means -- his kidneys were starting to struggle with the protein load; something which affects all cats if they live long enough.<br /><br />With other cats, as they aged or started showing signs of trouble, I switched them to Feline KD Prescription Diet, something available only from vets.  it's healthy for them, but it's expensive, inconvenient to get, and the cats don't like it very much.  Since my current boy had been eating Iams all his life, and this "Active Maturity"  had just become available, I thought we'd give it a try. It's been great.<br /><br />His water consumption went back to normal. He looks fabulous and incredibly healthy -- perfect teeth, perfect eyes, shiny gorgeous fur.<br /><br />My only complaint might be that he likes it a little *too* much, if you know what I mean. I'm in danger of having a fat cat who begs for  more constantly. (He's licking my arm to try to convince me to feed him as I type this!) But that's more a problem with the cat, than the food.

review/text: I have a cat named Charlie who loves this food. I have found that he looks healthier and his coat looks nicer when I feed him Iams then with other foods. He also seems to love this food and gets excited when I go in to the kitchen... that's his time to show off (I think) that he can eat.<br />This comes in a 5 pack and Amazon shipped it right away, so no complaints there.<br /><br />Edit:  March 20, 2011<br /><br />I can not recommend this food anymore. Too many recalls and the ingredients are garbage. I am using Chicken Soup for the Cat Lovers Soul and my furry friend looks better, lost weight and is more active. To Iams... you have lost a customer due to your outsourcing and horrible product quality control.

review/text: I was looking for a night time snack for myself that would satisfy my sugar cravings but not have a ton of calories.  Well this certainly fit the bill.<br /><br />These are so good and the small bags are just the right size.  Yes I could eat a whole box of these in one sitting but that kind of defeats the purpose.  But because these are low in calorie I don't feel guilty if I eat two packs.<br /><br />I didn't even look at expiration dates since I don't care and they're not going to last the month.<br /><br />I do wish they had this in all chocolate but the cinnamon is really good also.<br /><br />I'm really glad I got in on the subscribe and save before they closed it but the price went up.  I saw K-mart has these for $5.99/box which is better but it's worth it to have them delivered.  I don't know why the price hike.<br /><br />All I can say is Yum Yum!

review/text: Chocolate Teddy Grahams are so yummy!  As an adult, I love them.  I'd imagine kids would too.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- No high fructose corn syrup.<br />- Crunchy little bite-sized cookies.<br />- Nice chocolate taste that's not fake.<br />- Great to eat in the car, at your desk, or wherever.  It's a portable snack.<br />- Sweet but not sickeningly so.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- I really have no cons other than they will get stale if you don't wrap the bag up tightly.<br /><br />OVERALL OPINION:<br />I enjoy Chocolate Teddy Grahams as either dessert, or a snack with a cup of coffee.  It's a sweet pick-me up that doesn't leave me feeling too guilty.  Cures the need for chocolate, and has a nice crunch that sometimes I really want.  Oh yeah, and they're cute little bears!

review/summary: Great flavor, soft gum
review/text: This gum tastes very good, much better than the "Trident Layers Strawberry & Tangy Citrus" version in my opinion; that flavor has too much tang and not enough sweet, for me.  The Cherry Lime version has less tang, more sweet -- YUM.<br /><br />Trident Layers gums in general don't get tough or rubbery but rather stay soft for a long time.  I also like the size of each piece, just the right size in my opinion.  For comparison, Trident Tropical Twist pieces are a little too small, although I like the flavor of that gum also.  (Note that I am a grown adult female with a child-sized mouth who must use small-sized tooth brushes).  Trident Layers Gums are also individually wrapped in a foil wrapper; other Trident gums like Tropical Twist are wrapped in a thin waxy paper.<br /><br />I wish the flavor of Trident Layers Cherry-Lime lasted longer; it lasts longer than some, but I think Trident Tropical Twist flavor lasts a little longer, in spite of their smaller size.<br /><br />I also like the sturdy wallet style packaging; it provides very convenient access while protecting the gum from other things floating about in a drawer, pocket or purse (and it probably helps keep the pack fresh longer after removing the plastic wrapping, too).  Other gums produced by Trident lack the wallet packaging, even new ones like Trident Tropical Twist that I mentioned above.<br /><br />With the current competitive pricing by Amazon (shouldn't be much more than a dollar a pack, else wait a few days because the price fluctuates), there's nothing to complain about here.  It's all good, 5 stars!<br /><br />EDIT 04/24/2012: Beware of the EXP date; I bought a pack from a local store with an exp. date of June 30, 2012 and the gum was already stale.

review/text: These crackers are amazing. I half expected them to taste "healthy", which we, as Americans have come to know as relatively tasteless. Another great surprise from Amazon grocery! They actually taste like graham crackers should. They're light, crispy, and just the right amount of sweetness. Add to that the bonus of 70% organic ingredients, and that's a winning combo for me. They are perfect for our family tea time.<br /><br />My original plan was to use some as crust for a cheesecake with a healthy twist. This might not happen, though, as these are quickly turning out to be a repeat treat for the kids and myself alike. Luckily there's 6 boxes to a case, so I have enough for both.<br /><br />I hope my review helps! Happy, healthy snacking!!!

review/text: It seems like everyone is more or less in agreement that these are a great healthy snack, but are split between them being good tasting or not.  I for one do not mind the taste, however they are not overly delicious by any means.  What I have been doing is spreading either humus, or the low fat Laughing Cow cheese wedges on them.  Either one adds enough flavor to make them pretty good, and a serving of each is a nice, healthy, under 200 calorie snack.

review/text: These crackers are definitely a healthy snack, but they don't taste exactly like what you think of when you think about a graham cracker.  They are softer and don't have that crisp snap to them.  They are small.  They do help fill-up your sweet tooth, which is what I got them for.  They have a little sweetness to them, but aren't sugary.  They are OK overall--a good snack for young children.

review/summary: Graham???
review/text: I wish I would have heeded another reviewer's comments about this product not tasting good. She was right. Sometimes the majority is wrong! These are not like Honey Grahams, and in fact, they have very little "graham" taste (actually just pretty flavorless overall). They are not "light and crispy" as the package states. Instead, they are thick and crunchy--probably excellent for a toddler cookie to be knawed on over time, especially since there is hardly any sweetness to them. However, since I am not a toddler and my taste buds already know what a graham cracker should taste like, these fell way short.<br />They sound healthy though, if that is exclusively what you are looking for--or if you like foods with very little flavor. The package says that the Amaranth flour that these contain along with wheat flour, has a bunch of nutrients not found in other flours. I'm still trying ways to make them palatable for ingestion (dipping in milk-they don't even get soggy, slathering stuff on top of them, etc.). Thankfully, my dogs like them.<br />Sadly, Amazon will not allow these to be returned, so I am stuck with six boxes. I called Health Valley on their "customer promise of satisfaction", and to their credit, while they could not replace the case, they did offer to send coupons for other HV items to compensate.<br /><br />I'd suggest you try to find them in a grocery and try one box to see if you like them before ordering the case.

review/text: I am always looking for more healthy snacks for my family so I purchased these based on the reviews posted on Amazon.  They are indeed healthier than many other cookie/graham-type snacks out there, but they lack a bit on taste.  The only way I can really enjoy them is if I spread peanut butter on top, otherwise they are very bland and a little dry.  My kids didn't like them either.  I'll finish the amount that I ordered but I don't think I would purchase these again.

review/summary: Health Valley Used to Be Perfect Brand...
review/text: ... before they started using white sugar in all of their recipes.<br />(You can just skip to the last paragraph if you don't care to read the whole thing).<br /><br />Let me preface: A comment under one of my recent reviews challenged my credibility and accused me of 'not being discriminating enough, posting too many positive reviews in the row'.<br />While I have written many low star reviews in more distant past, recently I have deliberately focused on the products that I love, and that have truly been very useful to me over the years. However, in an effort to make my reviews more balanced, I set out to look for items that I feel merit low rating and it did not take me long to come up with ALL current Health Valley line.<br /><br />Consuming white sugar has caused numerous problems for my health and I had to, happily and willingly, give it up long time ago.<br />The founder and original owner of Health Valley, George Mateljan, was very passionate about good quality, healthy food and had pledged, among other things, to NEVER use any white sugar (nor artificial sugar substitutes) in his products. True to his word, ALL of his cookies, bars and cereal were delicious (even though a little pricey) AND they were sweetened with fruit juice only.<br />That's why these Amaranth, and also rice bran cookies and couple of his cereals used to be my favorite and a regular staple in my pantry.<br /><br />(Just a brief insight into the history of the company - he founded it back in 1970 and it was the first company to produce healthy prepared foods in the United States using fresh, quality organic ingredients. They introduced hundreds of convenient, delicious items that were packed with nutrition and flavor yet completely free from white flour, refined sugar, hydrogenated fats, excess salt, chemical preservatives and artificial colors that are so common in highly processed foods.<br />George participated in every aspect of the production at Health Valley and personally created most of recipes used.)<br /><br />That all has changed in late 90's, when the company got bought by Heinz.<br />Very shortly afterwards, an "evaporated cane juice" became prominent ingredient in all of their goods. Rose under a different name is STILL a rose, and no matter how glorified the politically correct "cane syrup" sounds, it STILL is a white sugar, a complete poison to my system.<br /><br />To my great dismay, there are so very few options these days for really tasty HEALTHY cookies, that would be fruit juice (or Xylitol) sweetened. Most of the 'sugar-free' varieties are made with artificial substitutes like Sucralose, that are even worse for human consumption than sugar itself.<br /><br />To sum up the previous: If consuming white sugar is not of any concern to you, then these cookies (and other bars and cereals from Health Valley) would still be a better option than many other commercial brands 'out there', thanks of the overall higher quality of ingredients.<br />For me, just because of the white sugar issue, all of their products have been off my list long ago.

review/summary: Just okay Coffee
review/text: This coffee is not quite what I thought it to be. Taste a little on the strong side. It is rather pricy, and yet I found it on sale, so I thought. I have plenty of caribou and that should hold me for a while until the seasonal coffees come out, hopefully they will not be so high in price. Saw a review on the Kcup coffees and found that they got the rating of being simply just "ok", so it is more of the easy of making the coffee rather than the price or quality of the brew of coffee. I shall keep my eyes peeled for the cheapest place to buy my kcups. The day break of the caribou is the best variety of the caribou brand.

review/summary: Taste is obviously subjective
review/text: I find it interesting when I see a wide range of comments for a product, particularly if for a food or drink. Taste is obviously very subjective. If I was a Maxwell House drinker I might say this coffee was great. If on the other hand, I roasted my own beans (I do), I would say this coffee is disappointing. I bought a Keurig and Breville machine for convenience. I generally use the "My K cup" and grind my own beans. At the office, however, I do use packaged K cups. I prefer a stronger brew, but a medium roast. So far I have found Wolfgang Puck's Vienna Coffee House blend to be very nice. The Caribou Blend was too weak for my taste. This morning I used 2 k cups for 1 mug. It was stronger, but lacked any real flavor. On another point, I wish there was some consistency or change in language when k cups are described as bold. Too many people thing that means a dark roast. It does not. I see so many people comment that bold is roasted too dark for their taste (like Starbucks). Bottom line .... I'll use 2 k cups of the Caribou Blend until I use the 2 boxes I have, then it's back to Wolfgang.

review/summary: Very Smooth - Best Keurig Coffee I've Tried, So Far
review/text: I'm a big fan of Illy coffee. It is a very smooth coffee. I was tired of having to work (clean stuff)to make my coffee so I purchased a Keurig.<br /><br />I purchased a sample pack. The only coffee I was impressed by was the Caribou. It's a slight bit weak for my taste but it is oh so smooth and flavorful. I actually purchased this pack because it was so good. It's as close as I can come to Illy on my Keurig, so far.<br /><br />I also purchased the Caribou Mahogany but it has not delivered yet. I'm hoping it's stronger, yet smooth like the Caribou blend. I like strong but smooth. I'm not interested in bitter.<br /><br />If you want a delightful smooth full bodied coffee, this is it. I drink coffee more for the taste than anything else and I'm extremely picky so I was pleasantly surprised when I was pleased by the Caribou Blend.

review/summary: Good coffee
review/text: Most of the reviews I have read were pretty much how the coffee tasted to people. Since everyone's taste is different, I think it's a moot point. What is important is how fresh the coffee is. I found that each cup had the same freshness so that's a nod to consistency. As for my own personal taste preferences, I drank Folgers Classic Roast for years and since that isn't available in K cup, I've been drinking the Caribou Coffee blend as a replacement. It tastes fine to me and the caffeine keeps me going all day.  I haven't had any problems with using the Caribou Coffee K cup either. When company comes, this is one coffee I don't share :)

review/summary: Caribou: an average cup of coffee.
review/text: The aroma of this blend is sharp and bold, but not as appealing as some of the other varieties ive tried, semi astringent. I brewed this on the 7.25oz setting and found it to be strong and dark enough to use milk and one tsp of sugar.<br />The taste is underwhelming, and seems to be along the lines of an average at best cup of coffee. The taste characteristic is along the lines of walnut and brandy, which is nice but not present enough to make this blend memorable.<br />It is as drinkable as a mild cup of starbucks coffee...

review/summary: Doesn't Bite back
review/text: I just received my order from 1 Quick cup of this coffee today and was never so anxious to try a Kcup due to all the raving reviews. I brewed it in my B40 @ the 9.25 mug size and added cream and a sugar substitute. This is a wonderfully blend; not harsh not weak and it doesn't try to be something it is not. I know that sounded a bit odd but that was my first impression. This is my third cup this afternoon so I would like to try another cup without the nuances of the other kcups on my palate<br /><br />Not to be redundant from what the other reviewers have written; it's very mellow yet rich and doesn't bite back and leaves no harsh after taste. Can't wait to try it later @ the 7.25 mug size.<br /><br />UPDATE: Well I just had my Caribou @ the 7.25 mug size and it was as delicious as the larger mug size. A bit more after taste but again not offensive. Though I read that this coffee is a medium roast, to me, it tastes more like a light roast which I seem to gravitate to. I will brew it @ the larger mug size just so I can enjoy it longer. Caribou differently hit the nail on the head with this one. So it wins a spot on my top ten favorite Kcups list.

I could tell by the burnt unappealing aroma of it that I wouldn't like it.  It tasted bitter to me with a little bit of a bite to it.  This one's for you if you like a more bitter/bittersweet coffee--it just didn't appeal to me because I like a smoother taste with less of an aftertaste.

review/text: Caribou Coffee is one of my favorites in spite of the fact I have to order the regular type online since we don't have any where I live. I ran into these K-cups at Target and thought I'd give them a go.<br /><br />I have occasion to offer people coffee in my office and the K-cup Keurig brewer is perfect for this as it makes just that cup for that person and it's fresh. Without exception everyone I served this too has loved it and asked for the name to purchase for themselves. It is full flavored but not dark and it has a very smooth taste with no bitterness (this is important to me..I find many K-cups to have a bitter aftertaste that affects the aroma of the coffee as well). A normal adding of cream and sugar works fine as well - you don't need more or less than your usual (again helpful when you are making it for clients and such).<br /><br />This is THE favorite for my office and one we will continue to purchase. Enjoy!

I hate to be the lone dissenter, but I didn't like this coffee at all; in fact, it was the first of the four samples I've tried so far that I did not like.  To me, it tasted like over-brewed coffee--i.e., like coffee that has been sitting in the pot for several hours.  It wasn't bitter, exactly, but it just did not have a particularly appealing flavor.  I definitely would not buy this coffee again, and I would not recommend it.
