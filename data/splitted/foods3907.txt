review/summary: Very Good, But Not My Favorite.
review/text: My nearby Fresh and Easy Market has a display of Kind Plus bars and I find it difficult to pass without picking one up. I like the nutritional specs and the low sugar content of the bars. Plus they're quite good tasting. I often have one as desert with my evening meal, as is the case tonight. This one was Almond Cashew with Flax. It was good, but I didn't care for it as much as several others. The chocolate one is my favorite. In any case, this is a good bar with good nutrition.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Good for you, tasty, but gooey
review/text: I really like these KIND bars. They're tasty, they're light, and they're good for you.<br /><br />The bars I'm reviewing are Pomegranate, Blueberry, and Pistachio. They really don't taste like any of those, they taste like an almond bar with various bits of indistinguishable fruit bits. Here are the ingredients, with the titled ingredients in all caps: Almonds, blueberry pieces (BLUEBERRY, apple, and plum puree), raw sugar, glycerol, citrus fiber, cashews, honey, raisins, glucose, POMEGRANATE, crisp rice, chicory fiber, PISTACHIOS, soy lecithin, natural flavors. The ingredients are always listed in descending order of how much is included, and KIND pulled a fast one by calling their "blueberry pieces" a separate ingredient, since it's really just apple puree. By my math guesstimate, there is less than 5% of Pomegranate, Blueberry, and Pistachio in the whole bar.<br /><br />Basically, this tasted like an almond bar. My advice is to read the ingredients, and expect it to taste like what's in the ingredients, and not go by what the title is on these bars.<br /><br />They're also really gooey. These are probably the stickiest bars I've ever had. I never pick them up with my hands, but I eat them out of the plastic.<br /><br />Also, I've ordered about ten of these boxes off of Amazon, and one box was rock hard. Not this one, but another kind. So if your box is hard as a rock, then just order another one, and odds are it will be okay.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Good for you<br />+Lots of natural ingredients<br />+One bar is a good snack (not too sweet, not too small, just right)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The ingredients on the title of the bar misrepresent the actual ingredients<br />-Very gooey and sticky. You won't be able to touch them with your hands<br />-From my experience, 10% of the boxes have bars that are hard as rocks

review/summary: Good but maybe my package was old.
review/text: I thought that these bars were very tasty if a bit on the expensive side.  My main complaint is that the bars disintegrate as you open up the packaging. Since the bars are also very sticky remain stuck to the rapper as they break apart so you are stuck having to pick off pieces of the bar from the inside of the wrapper (which is difficult because the wrapper is plastic not foil). I don't know if I got an old box of these or if they're all like this. Regardless I probably won't risk getting another box like the first.

review/summary: Taste great, but way overpriced for the size and ingredients.
review/text: I must admit I like them, and they are a healthy alternative to a candy bar.  But at about $1.50 each for a very small light bar, they're too expensive for most.  Honey, nuts, and a few pieces of dried fruit shouldn't cost that much.  A competitor may come along hopefully with a better value.

review/text: I do like the taste of these bars, however, do plan to get sticky when eating.  These stick to the plastic pouch and are difficult to get out, especially if you eat them while bike riding, running or working out.  You end up with a mess on your hands.  Refrigerating before eating may help, but may also lead to tooth loss.  These are my thoughts!

review/summary: Reminds me of Christmas time when I was a girl. . .
review/text: I couldn't believe my luck. This little nut bar was included in my variety pack of these yummy Kind bars that I had ordered from Amazon last month. The taste and texture of this nut bar is the exact same taste as the beloved "no bake fruit cake" that my Nana made us when I was a little girl back in the 50s and 60s. It must be the dates and the particular kind of nuts because it tickles my taste buds in just such a way as to send me back years ago. I thank you Kind bar makers as being genius in your combinations of ingredients. I love these things... Love, love, love. I have just recently made an order with Amazon for a box of 12 of these things... and just when I remembered a book I wanted and decided to add that to my order... gosh, well, I goofed up and I hope that Amazon figures it out for me just in time because if I get all 24 of these nut bars I am in real trouble. I will eat them till they're gone. So, please, cross my fingers Amazon does their usual magic and gets my order just right! I have been invited to "Like" them on my Facebook page, but then I don't go there often and... well, if I tell everyone, then they may become hard to find in the future... sorta like telling everyone where your favorite fishing hole is and then not being able to go there because it's so crowded.<br /><br />Computers are so picky!  I offered to write a review of a different flavor of this Kind bar and it told me that only one review per product per customer... but I could edit my review! So, here I am. Back again to further praise and describe what has become my favorite snack food. They are so filling though, you have to watch it because it becomes a meal substitute and then your friends think you're no fun cause you won't eat with them! You're already full! The protein in these bars make them ideal for trail food, however, if you don't have the teeth for nuts, stay away. This last bar I decided I'd praise is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TNANSO">KIND PLUS, Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate + Protein, Gluten Free Bars (Pack of 12)</a>. I found them in my local grocery store but they often run out and that's what sent me to Amazon for a check on their availability. Yum! Lucky me! So, I'm out. I ate all I ordered last month and I'm daydreaming of them right now. Should've ordered them a week ago so I wouldn't be out now. These dark chocolate bars are so delicious I can conjure up the taste and sensation right now because. . . now here's the heaven part of this daydream. . .they taste like Baby Ruth candy bars from when I would a youth!  Yum, yum, yum.<br /><br />Gotta love it, guilt free candy! But, wait, everyone, it is NOT guilt free if you make it an extra snack, but instead make it part of your meal planning day. The nutrition and calorie info is printed on each bar and if you buy them in the carton, then the info is even easier to read.

review/summary: Just as good as ever! High quality, natural ingrediants :)
review/text: I suppose I should be embarrassed o admit publicly that I climbed up on my grandmother's counters to get to where she had these hidden away on a high shelf (so us kids couln't get to them)... That was a long long time ago, and much has changed since, not least of which as how difficult it now is to find any kind of wholesome packaged food.  When it comes to candy, cookies, sweets, people seem even more willing to close their eyes to what is in them.  After all, we know this is an indulgence and not something we are buying or consuming for it's nutritional value, right?  That does not mean it has to be bad for you! or that you have to put up with things which are not food grade in your food!  and this product proves the point:)  I am really glad to find that they are still as good as I remembered them to be, and that the company has not succumbed to the temptation to pad profits by using inferior ingredients. These are both really good, and... well, while not good for you per se, they are not bad for you; no trans fats, no chemically altered ingredients.  It's something you can feel good about giving your kids (or even yourself).<br />I should not be here writing this up, should not even have opened the box (I did buy them for my son.... to show him what chocolate covered marshmellows should taste like), but these sat in the post office in 100 degree heat for 4 days, so I opened them to make sure they weren't ruined.  That was the beginning of the dn :O  I am glad my order was for 4 boxes....so there will (probably) be some left when he gets home from school ;)

I really like that they're grain free and contain alternative protein sources like duck and venison. Overall a really great product and the price isn't too bad, especially compared to similar products on the market.<br /><br />Do note that these are made for SMALL BREED dogs. They are much smaller than Milk Bones. This doesn't concern me, but if you have a larger dog these would be pretty insubstantial.<br /><br />Also, these were shipped by Amazon in one of those envelope type boxes and several of the treats were broken. I would recommend buying these in an actual store--I know PetSmart and PetCo both carry them. You would likely be able to get them home in better condition that way.

review/text: My dog was a very picky eater when we first took him home from the shelter.  He has since adjusted and no longer gives us issues at meal time.  However, even when he wasn't eating his Natural Balance kibble he would eat these dry treats.  They are great for training as I can easily break one into smaller pieces to use as rewards for teaching commands.  The only problem is that they are not tasty enough for training outside of our home - he can't be bothered by these treats when there are distractions around.

review/text: I bought a couple of bags of these treats for my Yorkshire Terrier and he loves them!<br /><br />I sometimes put them in the Kong toy if I feel my dog needs some mental stimulation ;-).<br /><br />They break apart easily for training.<br /><br />They're a good size for a small dog.  Keep in mind the 8-ounce bag has the smaller treats for smaller dogs and the company makes a larger bag, which I believe contains larger sized treats, but I could be wrong.

review/summary: A treat for Rosie and Brandy, and other dogs with sensitivities
review/text: Age finally caught up with our dogs. They suffer skin problems, gas, indigestion and irritable bowel syndrome. The days of table scraps are past. We buy dog food and treats that won't upset their stomachs. We switched to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003982KVM">Natural Balance Potato and Duck Formula Dog Treats</a> after our dogs developed skin problems due to food allergies.<br /><br />We have two adult, female dogs: a 28-pound Cockapoo (Brandy) and a 21-pound Miniature Schnauzer (Rosie). Both dogs receive a treat after going outside to relieve themselves. These treats are smaller than other brands we purchased before. That has been a nice change since we do not want to feed the dogs too many calories outside their regular meals.<br /><br />If your breed is larger than my dogs, I recommend you consider a larger treat. We also recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CR00E2">Newman's Own Organics Dog Treats</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HN5Z4K">Bit-O-Luv Bistro Beef Recipe Dog Treats</a>.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.

review/text: These are great treats for a small dog. These arrived very protected, no issues with broken or crushed treats. My dog has allergies, so I limit his exposure to beef and chicken. These are perfect! Having worked in a veterinary practice that deals with dermotology issues, these are perfect and priced just right. Especially if your a prime member and dont have to pay shipping fees. I guess even if you do pay the shipping, its cheaper than paying for gas to get them!<br />My dog loves these! I will be getting more for him.

review/summary: DO buy these treats for a large breed dog
review/text: My dog loves these treats, at 50 lbs he is a smaller-end of the range specimen of a large breed (Standard Poodle).  Many have written here that these treats are not as good for larger breeds -- I beg to differ.<br /><br />The standard size of these treats is $8 for a 14 oz. bag.  The treats themselves are 40 cal / treat.<br />The small breed size is $6 for an 8 oz. bag, but on a per treat basis the cost is probably the same and the treats are only 7 cal / treat.<br /><br />My dog requires about 1300 cal / day, and his food is about 420 cal / cup.  So if I use the treats *meant* for a large breed to reward my dog for going to his crate before I leave the house, staying patiently while I unload the dishwasher, moving away on command from the hamburger my son drops on the floor during dinner so that he doesn't lose his food, leaving the squirrel right away to come in from the backyard when called, and one other just because I feel like it, then I have to reduce his food by an entire half cup.  If I use the small breed treats, I don't have to do anything.<br /><br />Put another way, these treats are more substantial than a tiny training treat and my dog knows it, but they are still low enough in calories to be used with some frequency for a larger dog.  They are not as long lasting as a bone or a chew, but I can give him three of them if I want to make him feel really rewarded and still only be dishing out half the calories of the larger size treat.

review/summary: Great ingredients, but too hard
review/text: My dog, who is about 16 lbs, doesn't feel it's worth the work to chew and break apart these very hard, tiny treats. I was disappointed because the ingredients are great, but they are just too hard. Even breaking them apart with my fingers is quite a task. My dog gnawed away at the first few and got them down but then after that decided they were just too hard for him, and I guess not tasty enough to do all that work. But I'll give them 3 stars because they are grain free and made with high quality ingredients.

review/summary: A good treat for small dogs on grain-free diets
review/text: We started using these when we first put our pug on the LID food in Potato and Duck from Natural Balance.These treats are available in both regular size and the smaller size for small breeds. We got the small breed size, which measures roughly 1.25 inches long and is shaped like a dog bone.<br /><br />Spanky was happy to have these treats, although I don't think they are his favorites. They don't have any distinct smell that makes them particularly enticing. However, they are a nice convenient size and he's still happy to take them as a handout for when he's been a good boy.<br /><br />It's very important during the initial 6-8 weeks to stick to the diet and not let your dog anything else. This allows the vet and you to evaluate the reaction to eating the food and whether their allergies (in our case it was irritated skin on our dog's belly) show improvement. However, dogs like to have little treats now and then so having these treats in the LID potato and duck formula made that testing period easier.<br /><br />Now that we've finished the testing and determined that he does better on a grain free diet, we've tried the Natural Balance Sweet Potato & Vension Treats, which are a bit more aromatic and appealing to him. Since he does well with them, I will buy those in the future over these. However, if you are trying out the Potato and Duck food, I would definitely recommend buying these as well so that you can still give your dog a treat now and then.

review/summary: A Treat for a Flea, perhaps!
review/text: I had paid $7.81 for Natural Balance Potato and Duck Formula Dog Treats, 8 ounce bag. Since it did not specify for the size of dog as I purchased this online through Amazon.com, I assumed it would be "middle-of-the-road" which I predicted for medium size dog. When I finally got the product, I was shocked! I knew the amount of the product would be small but the size of the treat is even smaller than expectations would allow. If I had a dog the size of a small rat, it might have been a comparable treat. Be weary of what you pay for online and NEVER assume! I don't know a dog who would find this a treat as it is the size of a flea...a chihuahua would have found this treat but a speck in his diet. Not worth the money nor the time I had to wait for it.

review/summary: better than other strawberry sodas due to sweetener
review/text: I am a soda conniseur and I like to try new sodas all the time. This is a delicious strawberry soda from Mexico that is commonly sold in mexican groceries and bakeries in the U.S. It is one flavor from the 10 or so different varieties from the Jarritos company. It tastes like other strawberry sodas but but lighter with no afterbite and it is less sugary. The sweetness tastes more authentic and light as they use the more expensive cane sugar instead of the cheap high frutose corn syrup sweetener most soda companies use now. The carbonation of Jarritos is a bit lighter as well and seems to make the fruit taste better.<br /><br />Jarritos is now the best selling Mexican soft drink brand in the U.S. This offer is for a single serving of the soda, but they sell other sizes and volumes at Amazon.

review/summary: Good Premium Rice..
review/text: I bought Tamanishiki and the Kagayaki rice to compare them to the rice i buy in Japan, now that I'm in the states.  Comparing the Tamanishiki to brands like botan calrose, nishiki, kokubo, I can tell you that The Tamanishiki rice is a BETTER rice hands down. Now the Kagayaki Rice was Much better than the Tamanishiki because the Kagayaki was more polished than the Tamanishiki.  So in my opinion Kagayaki is the BEST - top of the line, however Kagayaki cost a little more than the Tamanishiki. Tamanishiki would definitely be my choice if i didn't want to spend the extra money. Hope this helps... anything is better than that what i was doing before, which was shipping my rice all the way from Japan. LOL!! yes this is how much I love Japanese rice. I've had them all.

review/summary: The Absolute Best
review/text: I grew up on Kokuho Rice and have always preferred short grain rice to other varieties in general.  Certainly a fragrant basmati with a saucy Indian dish or a creamy arborio under a veal shank will always please, but I always keep plenty of short grain sushi rice on hand and rarely go a week without.  While Tamanishiki Super Premium Rice is relatively pricey, I find I eat less than 25 cents worth at a sitting.  The taste is certainly worth such a paltry sum.  I usually add just a touch of butter and a dash of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P1YOGE">Fusion Black Truffle Sea Salt, 4.0-Ounce Jar</a>.  Tamanishiki rice has a unique sweetness and an amazing consistency.  I also enjoy it with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ND7E7G">Spicy World Spanish Saffron Filaments, 1-Gram Acrylic Box (Pack of 3)</a>, which easily surpasses the more pricey, but more authentic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZM8WE">Zoe Brand Diva Select Bomba Rice, 17.5 Oz Bag (Pack of 2)</a>.

review/text: I'll start this review with a confession: I am a Bloody Mary snob. My friends and I spent the majority of our college years in pursuit of the perfect Bloody Mary recipe. After enough trial and error to give any mere mortal cirrhosis, we came up with what we consider the Best Bloody Mary In The Universe(tm).<br /><br />Because of that, I am glad that Demitri's is not as good as ours. But dammit, it is close. Really close. The only issue I have is that the Classic Recipe is a bit tame for my taste. I am aware that Demitri has a couple of spicier versions but for the sake of my ego, I don't think I'll try 'em anytime soon.<br /><br />If you're looking for an easy and delicious Bloody Mary mix, look no further.

review/summary: Best for hot chocolate. Also easiest. And keeps the calorie counts down too.
review/text: Love this stuff. I just nuke a not-quite-full 10- or 12-ounce mug of 2% milk, stir in a heaping spoonful of this powder and yum!, what a great send-off into the Land of Nod for me, or treat for visitors coming in from the cold. At least as satisfying and considerably less caloric than an equivalent dose of Ben & Jerry's or Haagen Daz or chocolate anything else that I can think of. Not sure why, but I find it tastes even better with low fat milk than regular. The label says 140 calories for 1/4 cup, which is their recommended amount for adding to 8 oz. of milk--a somewhat higher ratio of powder to milk than I use.<br /><br />Please note that you can buy a three-pound can of this product here on Amazon for a much lower per-pound price. If you're wary of buying that much of  something you've not  yet tasted and are not yet sure you'll like, then start with this one-pounder.  On the other hand, if you go for the best-buy bigger can and you don't find it to be the be-all and end-all hot chocolate choice for you, you'll find some appetizing looking recipes for other uses on the product label and some interesting other drinks ideas amid the Amazon customer reviews on the 3-pound product page.

review/text: This is my go-to hot cocoa beverage for winter.  Very tasty and, yes, a bit decadent if you're watching your sugar.  Try adding a spoonful to pouch cocoa for a needed boost of yum.  Or use it in place of cocoa in a cake.  I did that once.  Best.  Cake. Ever.

review/text: My dog previously ate this brand of food, but the new bags I ordered here seem to be a problem.  She didn't want to eat it, then when she finally did eat it, it made her sick and gave her terrible gas and gurgles.  Switching to another food, she ate normally again and the stomach issues cleared up.  I left some of this food in a separate dish and it's still sitting there untouched.  She doesn't want it, but will eat other foods.  Amazon also does not seem to allow returns of this food so I'm stuck with a very expensive 4 bags of bad food.

review/text: A friend had given us some panettone over Christmas. My husband loved it and wanted more.  I couldn't find it in any of the stores, so I tried online. This is when I found out that it is a seasonal item.  I happened to find some in stock, so I ordered 2.  They arrived promptly and my husband dived right in.  He thought it had great flavor but it was a little dry.  I figure because it was out of season it was probably sitting around for a while.  I'll wait til closer to Christmas before I get some more and stock up and maybe freeze a few.

review/text: I've tried lots of different protein bars over the years and these are by far the tastiest (Triple Choc is the best in my opinion) - I actually look forward to eating these things!  I sometimes eat one of these in place of lunch or as a snack in the late morning and middle of the day (half in the mid-morning, half after lunch).<br /><br />The bars are relatively low-cal and have a decent amount of protein which, per their packaging, is more easily absorbed than other protein supplements.  I can't speak to their science but the bars seem to be working for me . . . I've lost around 10 lbs over the past month and put on a lot of muscle.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good protein bar, look no further.

review/text: I am following a low carb way of eating and was looking for a protein bar that didn't remind me of a tootsie roll.  This is nice and crunchy, but a little too sweet for my taste.  So instead of eating it by itself, I add it to my morning breakfast of greek yogurt, nuts, and coconut oil/flax seed oil.  Now the sweetness is offset by the tartness of the yogurt, and perfectly balanced out.

review/summary: Great ingredients, great bar
review/text: These Creme Filled Wafer bars taste absolutely amazing!!!  They do not have any of the chalky taste of most high protein bars and it is very light and crispy, compared to any other bar on the market. I have a very busy lifestyle with work, the gym, surfing, mountain biking, etc, so bars and protein drinks are a staple.  I have tried many bars and this one is my favorite.  I used to love zone bars because they were crispy and not as "Dense" as most protein bars, but then I discovered these bars and I will never go back.  These bars are the perfect snack when you need protein fast. I take no xplode before I workout so I can't eat anything 2 hours prior to my workout. My workout are usually 1 to 2 hours long and not eating for 4 hours can really put a strain on your goals of bulking up.  I take a power crunch bar with me to the gym and eat it during my workout. Its light enough where it doesn't reduce the pump I get from the no xplode and it's just enough to get the protein you need to build muscle.

review/text: I was lucky enough to meet the creator of Power Crunch while on holiday in the Sacred Valley in Peru. We had 2 weeks of day to day trekking in the Andes and our in-take of daily Power Crunch bars really saved the day. The terrain, the altitude and the food were challenging while being of our normal whole-food diet. I felt like Power Crunch really helped my body adjust and get a little extra out of an eXtreme vacation and tour schedule. I'm so excited by the taste and texture I'm ready to find a distributor in Asia so that Power Crunch can be part of my active daily lifestyle. You only need to try one to be hooked; do it when you need a little extra boost and you'll be back for more.

review/summary: Tasty and light
review/text: If those dense, heavy nutrition bars are too rich for you to tolerate or if you can't handle them after a hard workout, this one is worth trying.  It's very tasty and light.  The wafers give it a nice texture and crunch and it will remind you of those creme wafer cookies from childhood but much tastier and with better nutrition.  I will say that if you're looking for a "super bar" this may not be ideal because it does have a little more fat in it than other bars I like and a bit less protein and carbs, but it's worth buying because it tastes really good, it's light and easy to digest.  For me, this is a great meal replacement bar/snack or great after a light to moderate workout.
