review/summary: Crazy about Chow Fun!
review/text: My whole family--especially the eight-year-old--loves these wide rice noodles (chow fun). They are not easy to find outside of a Chinese market, so buying in bulk is a good idea. I love the mouth-feel of rice noodles anyway, and wide is just that much more fun. Plus, they are not flimsy (like rice vermicelli), so are easy to stir-fry. I use a simple Cantonese style, with some soy sauce, some oyster sauce, and a little beef stock. Be sure to use plenty of oil when you stir-fry, as the noodles do absorb it. But your dish will be so beautiful, it's so worth it. Lastly, if you are on a no-gluten diet, you are gonna go ga-ga over these!<br /><br />The directions on the package for presoaking are good--but instead of warm tap water (which has more lead in it from the pipes!) use cold water and warm it in the microwave. Be sure your noodle container is large enough so that the noodles won't stick to each other too much (and you will have to stir from time to time--again, to keep them from sticking). If you have to do something else, you can store the partially softened, drained noodles in the fridge--they'll be fine when you get back. Then saute as usual. Serve quickly so that the noodles don't get mushy. Voila! A fabulous and easy meal with minimal work (just a little advance effort).

review/text: Primo soda mix tastes more like Coke Zero than Diet Coke, which is a good thing.  Not a big fan of aspartame aftertaste in Diet Coke.  Just three pumps of the diet cola syrup gives you a drink very close to any national brand.  I go for icy cold water when I carbonate, which produces smaller bubbles and a better taste.  Great option to satisfy my family's diet Coke habit at a fraction of the cost.

review/summary: Doesn't taste like Diet Coke
review/text: This was my first time trying an at-home soda maker. I only drink diet soda, so I was really hoping this would taste like the real thing. It doesn't. I'm sitting here with the drink I made with this syrup and a Diet Coke. The drink I made is bitter and, in my opinion, has very little sweetness to it in comparison to the Diet Coke. I'm not sure what the previous reviewer is talking about, but this doesn't taste anything like Coke Zero to me either. I've been drinking diet soda daily for more than 20 years, so it's possible I'm just super sensitive to minor differences in flavor that won't bother other people. Personally though, I'm not impressed.

review/summary: A great way to get your cookie fix.
review/text: A review for cookies?  Why not?<br /><br />My wife and I love Oreos.  Every once in a while she picks up a bag at the store and we eat some with milk.<br /><br />The problem is that we feel compelled to finish off the bag before they get stale.  Since all the kids are gone that's tough.  It's not really good for us and after 3 or 4 nights it gets kind of old.<br /><br />Recently she got a 12 pack assortment of cookies which contained Oreos, Nutter Butters, etc.  I wondered if there was a way to just buy a whole bunch of "snack packs" for Oreos and sure enough Amazon has them.<br /><br />Now we can have that 6 cookie "fix" without having to remember to pick them up at the store or worry about them going stale if we don't finish them off.

review/summary: The perfect format for a student like me, but be careful
review/text: Three important details about me:<br />1. I have a ridiculously fast metabolism so I always want snacks.<br />2. I'm a student often stuck in long, boring lectures or labs.<br />3. I'm cheap.<br /><br />That's why I was so elated when I found this deal.  I already love Oreos and I'm always searching for small snacks I can shove in my backpack when I'm running out the door.  I tend to buy boxes of snacks and just cycle through them: peanut butter crackers, Nutty bars, bags of M&Ms, Moon Pies, etc.  The 48 pack of Oreos was my most recent one and definitely one of my favorites.<br /><br />They're packaged pretty lightly in little bags of 6 Oreos and I find it to be the perfect amount so that I'm satiated but not wasting any due to losing taste.  One pack of 48 will last me at least a month (sometimes I eat two or three packs in a sitting, okay?) so Subscribe & Save seemed to be my perfect snack solution.<br /><br />Of course I didn't realize how much Subscribe & Save sucks.  The price on these literally doubled after my first month and I had to cancel my subscription.  That said, the product is great but don't trust subscribing through Amazon.

review/summary: Still The Best.....
review/text: I have had an Oreo addiction since just about the time I knew what a cookie was.  Its funny how Oreos have managed to hang on and become such a family favorite despite all the competition of much fancier cookies that are available.  No nugets going on here, chocolate bits, caramel, icing, or peanuts either.  Just a tasty chocolate cookie shell with a delicious vanilla filling.  Keeping it simple has been the best policy for Oreo lovers for decades now. These little packages contain Oreos that are a smidgen' smaller than the regular box or bag sized variety.  What the cookie and candy industry refers to as the fun size.  That might explain some of the negative comments as to these Oreos being rather cheap with the filling.  In my opinion the ratio is the same, they are just smaller.<br /><br />This 12 pack is an excellent buy on Amazon.  Buy two of them and you get free shipping and for the majority of us, no sales tax.  A fine buy if you have a lots of Oreo fiends in your home that prefer a measured amount of these great cookies.  Like a lot of other reviewers here I tend to eat less of them when they come in the little packages as such.  Great classic Oreo cookies at a good price.  Highly recommended...

review/summary: Excellent sandwich cookie
review/text: Ok, for some of you (NAMELY Mr. A. H. of Detroit, Michigan), anything but a chocolate sandwich cookie, embossed with Nabisco symbols and filled with white creme is a travesty, but Golden Oreos are a worthy addition to the cookie line of Nabisco. These are vanilla cookies, slightly flavored with burnt sugar, filled with the familiar white creme.<br /><br />Unlike classic Oreos, the Golden version have not suffered much from having trans-fats removed. The cookie is still crisp enough and the flavor is the same. By contrast, original Oreos seem a bit softer due to the change in recipe.<br /><br />Another good feature is the fact that Golden Oreos don't leave a dark mess on your teeth. So you can eat one and not check yourself in a hand mirror afterwards if you are being in public. This is a very nice cookie with a cup of tea or coffee and a standard in our house for teatime or dessert.

review/text: Each pack contains 6 Oreos.  That's a tidy size for someone who wants a little snack but tends to overdo it with a big bag of Oreos!  However, having 48 of these in the house has led all of us to a bit of Oreo gluttony.  You know how easy it is..."Oh, there's only 6, I'll have another pack."  As a result our box of 48 has barely lasted a month for three people.  So, I will probably not get this anymore because it's too tempting!

review/summary: Chocolate Cream Oreo Cookies 101
review/text: This is less of a review of the actual cookies; though I rated them 5 stars.  The real merit of this "review" is to provide  information that may help others avoid the confusion that I experienced when I received my order.<br /><br />I stumbled upon the product page on Amazon for "Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream."  The Amazon product image clearly said "Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream" and I had never seen that product description or package previously.  I had seen regular Chocolate Cream Oreos before and even original Double Stuf Oreos (with the white filling) in local grocery stores but never the Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream.  I put my concern about the potential need to buy new pants aside and I ordered a case of 12 boxes, which is the minimum order.<br /><br />I received the case promptly from Amazon.  When I opened it, I found 12 boxes that simply said, "Chocolate Cream Oreo".  I uploaded a picture of what I received.  I called Amazon and told some nice representative in India that I received the familiar regular stuf Chocolate Cream Oreos that I have seen in stores and not the Double Stuf Chocolate Cream I had been expecting.  He apologized and shipped another case.<br /><br />I received another case today and it was the exact same product that I received a few days previously: "Chocolate Cream Oreo".  Instead of calling Amazon, I decided to call Nabisco (Kraft Foods, Inc.) for clarification.  The number is listed on the package 1800-622-4726.<br /><br />The following is probably the real virtue of this review.  I was told that the package now for the Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream does not say "Double Stuf" anywhere.  As I mentioned, I uploaded an image of the Double Stuf product package that I received.  According to Kraft, the only way to tell is the UPC and package weight.  The package weight for Double Stuf Oreos is 1 pound 1 ounce.  The package weight for regular or normal stuf Oreos is apparently 15.6 oz.  The UPC for Double Stuf Oreos is 04472700.  The UPC for (regular stuf) Chocolate Cream Oreos is 044000025298.  Since the package does not say Double Stuf anymore, I am not even sure what my local grocery carries.  I need to check the package weight and UPC at the grocery store.<br /><br />Therefore before you jump, head-long, into buying 12 boxes of this magical Double Stuf Chocolate Cream, you may want to check what your local grocery store carries.  I really do not see the logic in having 2 different products with the same package, but there you go:  that is apparently the case with Double Stuf Chocolate Cream and regular stuf Chocolate Cream Oreos.  I will also mention that it would be interesting to see a side-by-side comparison of Double Stuf and regular Oreo cookies.  My guess is that the difference is not as significant as you might expect since I initially thought my cookies were regular stuf.

review/text: I'm the biggest Oreo cookie eater you'll ever find, so when I discovered they make sandwich cookies I was interested however the taste is significantly different from a regular cookie.  The icing is the same, but the cookie part is soft and mushy like a moonpie.  You can't really dip these in milk because they fall apart.  Not recommended for those who grew up with the dippable kind of Oreo cookies (that being most of us).

review/summary: keeps cookies tasting fresh and crunchy
review/text: These are always going to be more expensive than buying the single big pack - remember when oreos were packed into three plastic tubes in a plastic box.<br /><br />These oreos always come out crunchy with a very pliable filling that can be easily nudged-rolled off if you don't like the filling.  If Nabisco sold individually wrapped cookies, I'd pay the extra money as I usually only want one cookie.<br /><br />I will always choose to buy oreos packaged in as small a serving as possible despite the expense unless I get some kind of vacuum sealer.

review/summary: How can you not like Oreos, especially small packages
review/text: Great item at $16 (on sale).  My problem with supermarket packaging is the problem that the cookies taste great but once you open the package for about a week the cookies gets moist and taste not nearly as delicious as when the bag was open.  So these small packages, I think 6 cookies each is the perfect size.  They will all taste great and crisp.

They make a good snacking food in the afternoon or even in the morning. Just be warned, these things are filled with sugar. Each pack has 6 oreos, which I tihnk is too much for one serving. I usually split one pack for two days.

review/text: My review is for the product cookie itself, not what might happen if you buy food from Amazon. Oreo is a classic cookie, and while I can't say that I am a big fan of all their flavors, I really enjoy three flavors - original, Uh-Oh Oreos, and the top of the list, Mint Oreos. The flavor is strongly reminiscent of the Thin Mint cookies sold by the Girls Scouts. Unfortunately, they only sell their cookies once in a while, but I can head to my store any time I have a craving for the flavor of chocolate and mint in a cookie. I even like this better than original Oreo, and that's saying a lot. Nom nom.

review/summary: Chocolate covered Oreo recipe
review/text: Everyone loves Oreos. They're even better dipped in chocolate. I made a plate of them for my son's Cub Scout cookie auction and a plate of my cookies sold for $20. So yummy.<br /><br />RECIPE<br /><br />2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips<br />2 tablespoons shortening<br />1 package Oreos<br />*optional: 1 cup white chocolate chips and 1 tablespoon shortening<br /><br />**Before you begin, make sure everything is absolutely dry. Even a drop of water will ruin your creation.**<br /><br />Melt the chocolate chips with the shortening in the microwave for 1 minute. Stir until melted. If needed, heat another 10 seconds at a time until melted. Be careful not to burn the chocolate.<br /><br />Place one cookie in the chocolate and coat. Use a fork to scoop it out, tapping against the bowl and scraping the bottom of the fork on the bowl to remove excess chocolate. Place on wax paper and let it set. Store refrigerated.<br /><br />Optional: To make it pretty, melt a cup of white chocolate with a tablespoon of shortening at 70% in the microwave for 1 minute. Dip a fork in the white chocolate and let it drizzle from the fork onto the semi-sweet chocolate covered cookies. If done neatly, your cookies will look beautiful.<br /><br />Hint: I do one batch in semi-sweet chocolate and one batch in white chocolate. Then, I drizzle the cookies with the alternate chocolate. Plate them together for an eye catching presentation.

review/summary: Mmmmmm, vanilla-y goodness
review/text: I second Joanna Daneman's observation that these golden Oreos are preferable to the regular chocolate Oreos when you are in public.  Oh, how many times have I enjoyed an Oreo milkshake on a hot day, only to smile widely at everyone with a mess of chocolate cookie in my teeth?  *shudders*<br /><br />So, only downside to the Golden Oreos is that I don't think they'd be as good in a milkshake as regular Oreos.  But the pluses are many with the Golden Oreos... a crisp vanilla cookie that is very good all on its own, but sweet biscuits and gravy, the vanilla cookies are paired with a sweet filling.  They are addictive.<br /><br />If you like vanilla sandwich cookies, try the Golden Oreos!

review/text: It is hard to imagine something as good as the original chocolate oreo.  That was in the days when Oreo only meant one thing:  Two chocolate wafers and vanilla cream.  The best way to eat those was to soak them until they were soft in ice cold milk (only could get whole milk back then).  Now there are how many things with the oreo name? TOO many.<br /><br />But this! The Golden Oreo.  Truly wonderful.  Totally different than the original oreo.  But wonderful. It is also BETTER than the current chocolate Oreo.  I wish I could taste-test the original oreo for comparison, but cannot be done...

My parents purchased this at Walgreens/(or BJ's) thinking the fancy box would have better ingredients of less quantity instead should have looked at what these are made of. It is not sweet and leaves a oily taste in the mouth. I don't write reviews too often and have never written reviews for a product i have not purchased from amazon, but after this tastes so bad i decided to write a review after seeing the false ingredients list on the Amazon page.<br /><br />The ingredients listed are incorrect, see pictures for more details. Ingredients in order: Vegetable oils, sugar, reduced fat cocoa powder, whey powder, cocoa butter, vanilla artificial flavor.<br /><br />Edited Jan 4 2011

I wish I could make this creamy, chocolatey, mouth-melting flavor, and stamp it on anything with chocolate, because it is perfect. The packaging is great because it comes in four bags which believe me, it's more than enough for a party. If you really like chocolate, but have been discouraged by brands that are too sweet, bitter or oily (Lindt),  buy this and you or your gift recipient will truly enjoy this gift!!! This is so good it's indulgence itself!!!

If you are looking for good, inexpensive truffles skip these and go get yourself Trader Joe's French Truffles or even Russell Stover. This product is clearly made for the quantity over quality loving crowd.

review/text: My dog is an older schnauzer and the vet restricted him to salt free treats. Most dog treats have salt in them for flavor so finding something was a problem. I finally looked on Amazon (should have looked first) and there are several salt free treats available. The Three Dog Bakery sounded good and I thought I would try them. The quality is excellent, an inner sealed bag to keep them fresh. I cut open the bag all of the sudden my dogs head went up and the tail started wagging. These cookie actually smell delicious (not like most dog treats). The only problem now is I cant give him all the cookies he wants. Hes limited to 3 a day per vets orders, but he seems to know when his treat is due and reminds me. All in all a great value and makes the dog happy.

review/summary: Soup Can Contains "Small Amount" of BPA
review/text: While shopping at Costco recently, I tried one of the free samples of Amy's Lentil soup. I was really surprised at how delicious it was so I bought a pack of it. When I got home, my very health-conscious daughter asked me if I checked to see if it had any BPA in the lining of the can. I said that I had not. Today I spoke with a Customer Relations person at Amy's Kitchen and asked her if Amy's soup cans had any BPA. She told me that they had a "small amount," but that they were testing other cans and should have no BPA in them by next fall. What I've read is that no amount of BPA is good for you and even a small amount might cause all sorts of bad things in one's body (cancer, heart problems, etc., etc.). I'm not trying to point the finger at Amy's products in particular, just make people aware that even CERTIFIED ORGANIC foods can be packaged in unhealthy containers and consumers should be aware of this.

review/summary: Not to my taste at all
review/text: I bought these because of the good reviews and because it makes more sense to buy lentil soup canned than it does to spend $6 every day getting the same thing from Pret, Soupman, or Hale and Hearty in Manhattan during the workweek.<br /><br />Since it's not exactly a complicated soup, and since I liked the soups at all three of those places, I figured I couldn't go wrong with this item.<br /><br />I was mistaken.<br /><br />This soup's texture better resembles gravy than soup. The smell and the texture also reminded me far more of a can of beans than lentil soup.<br /><br />Now, Pret's lentil soup is also quite thick, so I'm not sure that's what puts me off. Pret's soup is indeed loaded with sodium but  I don't think that accounts for the difference in taste, as this product isn't even the low-sodium version.<br /><br />Taste, of course, is subjective, and it's clear that others like it. As for me, well, I've got 11 cans of soup for which I need to find a homeless shelter.

review/summary: Lentils aren't just for old people!
review/text: I always thought lentils were beans for old people, but I love Amy's Kitchen soups so I wanted to try this. Good thing I did! I love it. The flavor is perfect and the consistency is perfect and it tastes excellent. Sometimes I even squirt in some lime juice in the spoon before eating it, just to mix it up a bit.

review/text: This soup is unbelievably delicious. It is rich, savory, hardy, and yet low in calories. After finishing a bowl, I always want seconds, but never have had too, since it is so filling. The soup has so much flavor, I am able to add in more vegetables, without watering it down. My favorite addition is some leftover spaghetti squash!

review/summary: Great soup, unfortunately 3 cans arrived damaged with dents & bumps
review/text: This is a great tasting soup, it's addictive. It's organic and delicious. Unfortunately, right smack in the middle of the package, I got 3 heavily bumped cans with dents on them. They say to never eat anything that's in a bumped can, cancer or something, I don't know. That's what I've heard since I was a kid: if the can is dented, throw it out. Well this soup is expensive, that's 3 cans out of 12 down the hole! :( Otherwise product also arrived extremely hot. I was concerned and I opened a can right away and it smelled of strong (garlic or onion?). But after I warmed it up it seemed fine.<br /><br />I recommend the soup, but I don't know what to tell you about the bumped cans. I haven't even checked the rest I was so disappointed about the dented cans. How's about a refund on those, Amazon?<br /><br />ETA: Found out these cans are BPA lined a toxic carcinogen which releases xenoestrogens into the food when kept in warm warehouse or hot UPS truck. I'm currently detoxing xenoestrogens and see many health problems gone...only to come back whenever I eat anything plastic-laced. :-/

review/summary: Seeds in a baby food?
review/text: Ingredient list is nutritionally solid, but you can't put strawberry seeds into baby food and expect it to be well-tolerated.  I actually give all kinds of these pouch baby food purees to my 3-year-old boy because he loves them and they're good for you no matter what your age.  Of the dozens of different varieties of pouch baby foods I've given him, this is the only one he has rejected, saying "I don't like seeds."  He is typically pretty tolerant for his age but this grossed him out.<br /><br />Also obviously the price here is ridiculous.

review/summary: Exquisite Brew
review/text: .<br /><br />The name of this coffee shouts to me "powerful".  Thunder in the Rocky Mountains can be very loud and strong.  So I decided I must try this product,<br /><br />I have often been disappointed about my coffee selections. I became rather fond of strong but smooth coffee while serving in the military. After my retirement, my strong coffee turned bitter and my mild coffee was weak. Reducing the portion before brewing seldom helped strong coffee from becoming bitter. Increasing the portion did not help the mild coffee gain strength. So, I am now on a quest for better coffee.<br /><br />Boyer's Rocky Mountain Coffee is my second choice from Boyers. I selected Rocky Mountain because it was advertised as a strong coffee. Rocky Mountain is a dark roast Guatemalan coffee that claims to have a distinct smoky flavor.<br /><br />Rocky Mountain is really good coffee. It is not bitter, but rather is very smooth, full flavored, and rich. Rocky Mountain titillates my taste. It is a pleasing drink, with a taste that lingers awhile. I endorse Boyer's Rocky Mountain Coffee to those who are strong coffee lovers. I judge the coffee superior, and highly recommend it.

review/text: I can't eat much in the way of refined sugars because of a  health condition, and Maple Syrup is a refined sugar. I make a more benign Maple syrup by adding a tablespoon of this to about 12 ounces of Agave nectar. It is delicious and I can't tell it from grade B (the dark kind) maple syrup. I am thinking about trying an experiment, adding it to Splenda or Erythritol/Stevia mix and putting in the food dehydrator to make maple sugar substitute. I'll let you know how it works.

review/summary: My cats love this food, but can't find anywhere
review/text: Nature's Best was the best cat food I could find for my two cats' palates. It was the only type we tried that worked for both cats that neither would barf up (one is a DSH, one is a Himalayan) constantly. They never did the snotty kitty ignore thing when this food was in their bowls, and they ate it with almost the same excitement as when they get wet food.<br /><br />As far as I can tell, this food is great for keeping kitty coats healthy-looking and promotes muscle mass retainment -- I find that latter point important as my older cat gets into her mature years. The cats seem perkier with the food. All this leads me to assume that this dry food is made with the right stuff to keep housecats not only healthy but happy as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately this food seems to no longer be available in stores, which is a real bummer. Nothing I've switched to seems to make them as happy with their dry food as this kind did. I've stayed with Felidae's dry cat food since it is grain-free, and they like it well enough, but I miss Nature's Best.

But I usually don't buy TM teas for everyday use because they are pricey. I'm glad I tried this one - the green tea is so flavorful. That said, I'm no connoisseur of green tea, and the flavor is a bit "flowery" as one reviewer noted. I like it, but that's my taste. TM teas take a while to steep, so be sure to put your saucer on top or your tea will be cold before your first sip.

review/summary: Holy crow! This sh*t is HOT!! (which is a good thing)
review/text: I bought a bottle of Dave's Insanity twelve years ago at a hot sauce store in Boulder, CO, back when Dave's was the hottest sauce made. One or two drops in a pot of soup made the whole thing damn near unbearable (yet my roommate managed to use half the bottle in around 2 months).<br /><br />So when I saw the salsa, I thought I knew what I was getting into. I assumed that the salsa would be pretty ungodly hot  but somehwat milder than the sauce, given that this contains OTHER ingredients like tomatoes and onions. Boy, was I wrong. This stuff is as hot as the Insanity sauce, even though it is "diluted" with salsa ingredients. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. The heat won't kill you, and it won't even cause any real damage. (It'll just feel that way.)<br /><br />Don't expect to empty the jar at the same rate at which you scarf down that chipotle corn salsa or the green olive tomatillo tapanade, though. I eat a little bit of this everyday with tortilla chips and sour cream, sprinkle a tiny amount on a plateful of nachos, and spread an 1/8 teaspoonful on quesadillas, and have for the last three months. I think the salsa level has decreased by a few tablespoons in that time, and to me that seems like progress.<br /><br />Good stuff, but only for committed chileheads (or, more accurately, for those chileheads who should be committed).
