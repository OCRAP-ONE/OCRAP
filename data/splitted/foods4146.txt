review/summary: Something's wrong with this coffee
review/text: These K-cups are either extremely old or they're not authentic Green Mountain K-cups. The coffee is weak and has a bad after-taste. Both my spouse and I have noticed this independently of each other.<br /><br />I tried to contact the seller to ask about this but couldn't figure out who it was.

review/summary: Terrible Price
review/text: I love this coffee and when I bought it, I also bought another brand. The price, around $20.00 was for two boxes of the other brand. I thought it was a pretty good deal although you can sometimes find it for $9.95 each at Target.  When they arrived, I discovered that I had paid for only one box of Breakfast Blend - a complete rip-off.  Even directly from Keurig, it's cheaper.  Will never buy this again.

review/summary: Do NOT buy from Mike's Grocers!!!
review/text: What I received today in shipment is a joke! I have the product on the desk in front of me. I see 4 packages of Green Mountain Coffee..Breakfast Blend. The 4 packages arrived NOT in an outer box! The packages are held together with yellow strapping tape. ALL 4 packages are ripped open in one way or another. One package has the bottom ripped off almost entirely and several coffee pods are missing. This disaster of shipping  was sitting out on my front porch in 95+ heat on a very humid Texas day. Mice, giant tree cockroaches, or kitties could have been prowling around inside the boxes. I can't believe UPS even accepted such a crappy packaging attempt. PLUS...I tried to find this Mike's Grocer online. The address on the return slip is 7 Prospect ST APT #4....an APARTMENT???? How do I even know where in the heck these pods originated? I LOVE Amazon and buy almost everything from them. This is my first REALLY horrible experience. Amazon....please get rid of this retailer!!!!!! Brenda Spurlin

review/text: I was excited to see this 50 pack of coffee! Read all about how "if you like Dunkin Donuts, you'll love this".  Well its not good at all.  Comes out looking like tea. Has the flavor of coffee but its really just water.  Trust me, I am not a fan of the "Rocket Fuel" they serve at Starbucks but this is nothing like Dunkin.  Just cancelled subscription.

review/summary: Not the best, but CERTAINLY, not the worst!
review/text: This is a breakfast blend coffee and, for many coffee producers, a breakfast blend also means "the strongest daggone brew we can make" mentality.  Well, caffeine is caffeine and this guy is a bit strong for me.  I prefer Caribou's breakfast blend over this Green Mountain version. It's just entirely more smooth, no bitterness at all, and just a very enjoyable cup of coffee.  I think this one tastes a bit burnt, like Starbuck's, not at all as nice as some of their other blends (especially the pumpkin spice - awesome!).  Try it to see if it suits your taste but get the 12-pack first.  Otherwise, if you think the way I do, 24 of these guys is a LOT of coffee to wash down!

I get 4 or so people together. You pull out a single jelly bean. Since you don't know if its a good one or a gross one it makes it interesting. Each person has a dice and they roll to see who eats it. Lowest roll eats the jelly bean. If two people roll the same low number they roll off. Some people think the jelly beans aren't so bad. I have seen some people throw up and others eat them no problem. Enjoy!

review/summary: Thicker, mild banana flavor instant oatmeal
review/text: Since watching my cholesterol, I have been using Quaker's instant oatmeal Fruit & Cream variety, which only has two packets of the Banana flavor in it.  Since that one is my favorite flavor (it's made with dehydrated banana flakes), I have been searching around for a box with more of the banana oatmeal packets in it.  I have seen the Quaker instant oatmeal Heart Healthy series in stores, but never this Banana Bread variety, so I purchased this one box (rather expensively) from Amazon. You do get a larger portion (it fills up about half a 9 oz. hot cup, as opposed to about a third with the other), and even with repeated dabs of hot water to loosen it up, the product remains a thick consistency that you can stand a plastic spoon up in.  The banana flavor is very faint, to me it has more of a maple syrup flavor, and the ingredients only say "natural and artificial flavor," nothing about dehydrated banana flakes.  I think this Banana Bread type is made to go with cut-up banana slices to accompany it, to boost its flavor - personally, I am going back to my original Fruit & Cream box, and be satisfied with a lesser but better, more natural banana instant oatmeal product.

review/text: We've loved the John Wm. Macy Cheddar CheeseSticks and didn't know how they could be improved upon. But John Wm. Macy did improve them. These Cheddar CheeseCrisps are the same wonderful flavor with an improved shape. These Crisps are cut into squares rather than long sticks and are easier to get out of the package, eat, and use with other foods. We noticed there was always some breakage in the packages of sticks and these crisps solved that problem. You must try these unbelievably delicious treats.

When you find a product<br />you like so much you tend to count on the same taste, my guess is the cheese isn't the same.<br />I don't blame Amazon for this, it's the Company that isn't living up to the standards it should.<br />I was always willing to pay the price but now it's not worth it. If I ever hear back I'll fill you in<br />but so far after 3 E-mails to Macy's NOTHING. Before I gave them 5 stars, not now.

review/text: Someone brought these to a potluck lunch at work, and if I knew who it was I would thank them personally.  These Cheese Crisps are unlike other snack products, and unlike my expectations (that is to say they exceeded my expectations considerably).  What you will find in this package is not a cracker although it has a cracker-like shape.  It is DEFINITELY not just another poofy, greasy, "cheese flavored corn curl" product although that may be what comes to mind if you only glance at the box.  John Wm. Macy CheeseCrisps are robustly flavored and firmly crunchy, with a high level of quality that is evident from the first taste.  I invariably consume the entire box in one sitting.  If it is open , it is gone! Dear family of mine, be there when the box opens or lose out.

review/summary: DELICIOUS!!!!
review/text: These cheese crackers are the BEST!!! I love cheddar and Asiago, so these crackers are a perfect match. The taste of asiago and cheddar are the right amount, not too subtle, not too strong. There is also a hint of pepper in the taste. The chips are crispy. I first tried in when it was sold on Costco (cheaper, but in much bigger bag, 22 oz) but they don't have it in stock all the time. I was craving for it already and Costco didn't have it so I searched online, and amazon has the best online price. Better than the John Macy's online store itself. The package came quickly,  and so far I think I finished 3 boxes and they are all the same great taste. If you like cheese, you'll most likely love this one. You can really taste the cheese in each and every single chip, unlike other chips that claim to be cheesy but you can't really taste the cheese at all. This is perfect. The picture in the box showed the chips in perfect square shapes, the inside, though, are not all like that. I mean some of them are broken chips, which is fine if just eat it by itself, but if you are using it as a base for some oeur d'oeuvres or something you should realize that some of the chips are broken into smaller pieces.

review/text: As far as natural snack foods and texture, it's pretty good. I like the crisp and the combination of flavors. My only complaint is the cheddar taste isn't as powerful as advertised. I would like a more deep and powerful cheddar cracker but these are good.

review/summary: John Macy's Cheese Crisps Do Not Ship Well
review/text: The first case of crisps were excellent but the last two cases contained over 3/4 broken pieces and less than 1/4 whole crisps.  The taste and the texture was outstanding but since the crisps were so broken they were only good for sprinkling on a salad or for topping a baked savory dish.

review/summary: Fantastic taste splurge every day
review/text: I remember back when the only flavor you could get your hands on were the cheddar twists and they were absolutely delicious and completely addictive.<br /><br />When they came out with these crisps I thought it was a stroke of genius.  They are the perfect size for snacks at a casual gathering with friends, pairing beautifully with fresh fruit and wine, the tang of the cheese and the kick of heat at the back of your throat the perfect counterpoint to the sweetness of grapes, apples and pears.<br /><br />When having a more elegant gathering I'll put out black olive tapenade or a quick relish made with finely diced English cucumber, green onion, a touch of sundried tomatoes and marinated artichoke hearts.  They disappear off the trays and because of their sturdiness they hold up pretty well to having a dollup of something on top.<br /><br />These also offer a delicious alternative to croutons when served with a salad because of the complex flavors that you can get.<br /><br />The one thing that I will warn folks about is that these crackers are crunchier than your traditional crackers, not as dense as biscotti but it gives you about the same crunch when you chew, but the beauty of these crackers is that the more you chew the more flavorful they become, and they really pair beautifully with adult beverages of every sort.<br /><br />Give these a try as an alternative to chips and you'll find they can be more addictive than chips and they're healthier for you!

review/summary: John Wm. Macy IS Awesome!
review/text: I first purchased the John Wm. Macy's Cheddar & Asiago Cheese Crisps at my local grocery store in the deli area.  They were a little pricey which caused me to almost bi-pass them.  The first bite made me want more and more.  They are so crisp and extremely flavorful.  They are awesome with a dip, hummas and better yet - just plain.  I really hate to cover up the flavor of the crisp itself.  I located these at Amazon and OH MY - what a savings of $1.75 A BOX so I ordered a case of 12 boxes.  If you love cheese as much as I do you will definitely keep these on hand always!!

review/summary: Great Seasoning And Tenderizer
review/text: I recently tried this tenderizer/seasoner when I saw it at a discount store here and found it excellent.  It's the same big 27 oz bottle you get for a very reasonable price here on Amazon, and it is well worth it for the taste, and its tenderizing ingredients.  When it comes to tenderizers I have never really found all that much difference in how they work as to actually softening the meat. Even the cheapest brands I have picked up seem to break down the sinew in meat that binds it together, and thus has it cooking up a little tough at times.  What sets this Bolners brand apart is its taste beyond its performance as a tenderizer.  Just a lick of it on your finger will tell you it adds a delicious touch to steak or any other meat you favor.  I love it and use it all the time now and will be ordering more of it from Amazon when I am done with this bottle.  Really delicious seasoning and tenderizer that I highly recommend.

review/summary: "Phenominal!"
review/text: "Phenomenal is how I describe those lemon bars." My 26 year old son actually took a moment to email me that sentiment after he ate one. The rest of the family agreed. I have made a lot of lemon bars from scratch that were always good and eaten many others on dessert tables but these were so much better. Here's why: The crust is a very good balance of its ingredient and doesn't fall apart under the absolutely luscious, creamy, tart lemon custard that's on the top. They also looked very nice when they were dusted with the powder sugar topping that came in the box. You'll get three packets in the box: one for the crust that you combine with your own butter, one for the lemon filling that you'll combine with your own eggs and 3 lemons, and a generous amount of powdered sugar to sprinkle on the top. (I only used about half of the amount provided.) The directions are very clear and helpful, also. Be very careful to follow her blending speed recommendations and total times for mixing as you combine ingredients.<br /><br />I'll admit I was a little worried when I first took them out of the oven because they looked so different than when I had made them from scratch in the past. The toothpick test in the center made me even more nervous when it came out a little wet but if you follow the directions of letting them completely cool, they will not disappoint you! I'll never make them from scratch again and will probably be less enthusiastic about any other lemon bars I encounter in the future if they aren't made from Ina's mix. These are THAT GOOD!!!

review/summary: A dismal failure
review/text: I am normally a very big fan of the Barefoot Contessa Pantry mixes. I have tried a few (like the blondie mix and the chocolate muffins) and they have always turned out really well. However, I am sad to say that these Lemon Bars were a dismal failure. First of all the crust calls for almost 2 sticks of butter, which I was willing to try, but the taste of the crust was gross, as if you were eating a bar of butter, not at all like the advertised shortbread taste. Also, the filling was way too sweet and did not set properly, it was runny to the point that I could not even cut the bars, they just turned into an icky sticky mess. I had to throw the whole pan out, it was such a waste, considering that the mix was expensive and after 2 bars of butter and 5 eggs, I wasted good ingredients. I would have made do if the taste was passable, but I don't think anyone could eat them. Ugh. I am giving it 1 star as I am willing to take a hit on my baking skills, though honestly, I have been making baked goods since my teens and I have never had anything turn out as badly as this mix did. These are certainly not your grandma's Lemon Bars. I'll have to find a Lemon Bar recipe to make from scratch because this mix just doesn't cut it.

review/summary: Hotel Waffles at Home!
review/text: I started by buying the Presto 03510 FlipSide Belgian Waffle Maker here on Amazon. We experimented with the Presto and Epicurious recipes and cooking times. Three keys with the Presto:<br /><br />1) Use cooking spray on the griddles, not butter or oil, which cause mottling. [EDIT- now that my Presto is "seasoned" a bit, I don't wash it more than necessary and I often skip the cooking spray altogether]<br />2) Ideal cooking time is 3:15. I don't see why others complained about the timer feature.<br />3) Don't try to be healthy and use egg whites or substitutes...it doesn't work as well.<br /><br />What DOES work is this Carbon's Malted. I think what's sold here is the same as they sell at a fancy cooking store known as W-S. We've been trying to find a malted recipe like you find in hotels and restaurants. With some Googling, you might find ideas about going to home brewing stores to source liquid malt. Well, consider the value of your time and just get this. Add butter, water and eggs, cook for 3 minutes 15 seconds and enjoy.<br /><br />Don't forget- splurge on real maple syrup...life is short and how often do you have great waffles?

review/summary: Light, crispy and easy.  Perfect combination!
review/text: I don't buy mixes for anything.  Combining flour, baking powder and a few other things is not difficult and is easier than having various cake, pancake, etc. boxes filling the cupboards.  I bought my first Belgian waffle maker (the Waring Pro - excellent, by the way <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009K3SY">Waring Pro WMK300 Belgian Waffle Maker, Brushed Stainless</a><br />) and made my first batch of waffles.<br /><br />It took 1 � hours.  I needed to let the yeast rise, mix everything just right, wait and wait and wait...  The waffles were very good, but they were not something I would have made on other than special occasions.<br />I tried another recipe.  A little faster, but it still took an hour.<br />I read the reviews for this mix and tried to find a recipe I could make from scratch that would replicate the mix.  The ones that looked like they would be close weren't any faster than the recipes I had already tried.<br /><br />Then I gave up and bought this mix.  I am really glad I did.  It is very quick and almost foolproof.  I had an 8 year old making them this morning.  Stir the mix with an egg and some water, add a little melted butter, and you are ready to go.  Pour it into the waffle iron (I use setting #5) and in just a few minutes serve crisp, very light waffles.  Easy and tastes great.  Waffles are now a common breakfast around our house.

review/summary: Hubby loves the smell and flavor of this mix's waffles
review/text: I'm a super lazy cook, and so I don't feel like making mixes from scratch. (I tried, and it didn't taste as good as this, anyhow.)  Although another reviewer complained about the vanilla "fakey" smell, we love it. I love how the house smells when I make these (or when we reheat frozen ones I make from this mix.)<br /><br />I like the flavor, even if it's kinda bland (other reviewers touched on this). The texture is nice. It freezes great for reheating through the week, so I make one big batch that covers several breakfasts for me and hubby.<br /><br />This is a solid, good product, and I've ordered it more than once from amazon. Note that it will be good for about a year, so if you don't think you'll go through all these cans in that time, you may want to skip the amazon purchase and get one or two at a time. I find that three cans takes me fine through a year, as we don't eat waffles every day/week, and I don't use this for pancakes, as we like Heidi's Grainy Day for that. (Also available here at amazon).<br /><br />Thumbs up.

review/text: For ease of preparation, for wonderful flavor, for great texture, this is the best mix I ever used.  I normally never, ever use mixes because I'm such a purist:) I order the six-pack so I can give some as gifts!  I do add just a teaspoon of real vanilla and it makes it a little more exciting!  But, I'm just being fussy...this is the real deal and the price is great!

review/text: This mix makes nice crispy waffles but the flavor was surprisingly bland.  Next time I make them I'll throw in a tablespoon or two of sugar and see if that helps.  I was hoping for a mix comparable to Bellegem and this is not that mix. If you're looking for waffles with amazing flavor, you should pass this one up and try Bellegem instead.

review/text: Used with a waffles, this mix is very good.  Testing with the Kitchenaid Pro Line Waffle Maker, waffles came out very light, crispy and with a very soft and moist interior.  During cooking, the house smelled amazing.<br /><br />I also tested with a Betty Crocker scratch recipe.  The waffles came out a bit heavier, but still crispy and moist.  The flavor may have been slightly better using Betty Crocker's recipe, but the texture could not compare to that of the Carbon's mix.<br /><br />While I don't think this mix is necessary to make outstanding waffles, it is very good with an unbeatable texture.

review/text: I have used it over the last year and find that it is great.  One 16oz. container makes about 5 waffles.  I had to tweek the label recipe by adding water as theirs came out thick.  The waffles are consistently good.  We have used the waffles with syrup, ice cream and fried chicken, all tasting great. If writing this uplifting review gets me a dozen complimentary cans they will be gladly accepted.

review/summary: Good  Breakfast Treat
review/text: First the good about the product; it comes with all the stuff in the flour, so all you have to add is water, egg, and melted butter.  It is very quick to fix; less than two minutes if you have your act together.  I have made both the pancakes and the waffles (the recipe is slightly different for each one), and I tried variations. I tried milk in place of the water, it wasn't much better (but it wasn't worse).  The thing I found that improved the waffles and pancakes was using BUTTERMILK!  That made the taste much better.  If you try the product, do try the buttermilk substitution for the water; leave the egg and butter amounts the same.  As for the bad, there isn't any, sorry to disappoint those of you expecting me to say negative things about the product.  I guess  my only negative thing is it is not the cheapest product in the world for pancakes/waffles.  (But you often get what you pay for!)

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: I'm a newbie when it comes to homemade waffles. I purchased a belgian waffle maker through Amazon and was looking for a good recipe for the waffles. When reading the reviews of the waffle maker, so many mentioned this waffle mix that I figured I would give it a try instead of making my own. I'm so glad I did! I used the tip of adding milk instead of water and followed the rest of the directions exactly. From start to finish this morning, I was enjoying fresh waffles in 5 minutes. The taste was restaurant quality and it was easier than I imagined.

review/summary: THIS is the waffle mix you have been looking for!
review/text: You know those absolutely wonderful Belgian waffles you make yourself at motels or hotels that are too small to have a full-on kitchen to make breakfast for their guests, but are too classy to serve just coffee? You pour a cup  of waffle batter in the waffle maker, rotate the handle, wait for the beeps, and then lift out the yummiest waffles you've ever had. I wondered for years where to get the recipe for the batter, and finally found an award-winning Executive Chef who ratted Carbon's out. This is THE stuff! Easy to make, easy to run out of! Simply delicious! Will fill your kitchen with a wonderful aroma!<br /><br />Amazon's price is the lowest I've found. Would make a heckuva wedding present if somebody else is giving a Belgian waffle maker!

review/summary: I blame my wife...
review/text: I've always been a "pancake person." Waffles just weren't my thing, but whenever we'd go back to visit my wife's family in Fort Wayne we always had to have breakfast at "Richard's" for the waffles. I guess you could say that waffles are in my wife's DNA.<br /><br />Two or three years back Richard's wasn't the same and it was my husbandly duty to satisfy my wife's waffle jones. We bought an inexpensive waffle maker and proceeded to try almost every waffle recipe available on the world wide web, but to no avail. Then we discovered Carbon's. Okay, the waffles still weren't nearly as good as they once were at Richard's, but they were much better than any others that we tried.<br /><br />We eventually purchased a terrific waffle maker (a Waring WMK-300, a birthday gift from my wife) and we now have unbelievable Carbon's waffles. Yes, better then Richard's EVER were, and yes, I've become a "waffle person."<br /><br />We have waffles about twice a week and this small-can six-pack lasts about three months. Highly recommended!!!

They just don't taste the same as the hotel ones do, and they frankly are really just not that good.  I has signed up for recurring deliveries of them, but I will cancel that soon, and will give away the remaining 5 cans I bought.  The best kind I have ever made or found thusfar has been Maple Grove Farms waffle mix, but the local store I used to get them at no longer carries them.

The scent of the waffles cooking is heavenly, but I was very disappointed by the flavor. They were very bland, not at all what I expected from the smell that filled the kitchen. Even with some butter and syrup I thought they were bland. Definitely a disapointment based on the other reviews. I ended up finding a quick recipe online that was much better. I won't be using the rest of the mix.

review/text: We had waffles made with this mix in a hotel and they were great, so we decided to get some for home use.  On a whim I substituted coconut oil for the 2 Tbs. butter called for in the recipe, and wow, was it ever good.  The coconut flavor compliments the vanilla and malt flavors well, and reminds me of Shipley's Donuts, which are fried in a coconut oil blend.
