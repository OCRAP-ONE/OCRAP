review/text: Wow, these are incredible! I can't believe it, they are healthy, don't spike my blood sugar and taste fantastic!! I am a chocoholic and these solve my cravings.. I eat them at room temperature, I heat them in the microwave for 5-10 seconds- and yummy- melty chocolate brownie and sometimes I freeze them when I feel like having a frozen candy bar. I keep them in my car and have them on the go.

review/summary: Wonderful for the Taste Buds
review/text: I am a bit of a beef jerky connoisseur, and this is the best original beef jerky I've ever had. I live in China, and the beef jerky here tastes a little different so my mother-in-law occasionally sends me Extra Value or Jack Link's beef jerky. I'm going to be telling her to start purchasing Bridgford's Sweet Baby Ray's beef jerky when my birthday and Christmas rolls around. Some beef jerky is too salty or a bit on the hard side, but not Bridgford's SBR's beef jerky. Their jerky is tender and has a great blend of seasonings. Although brown sugar, sugar, molasses, caramel, and pineapple juice powder are part of the ingredients, I wouldn't describe this jerky as sweet. My wife, who is not big on red meat, found Bridgford's jerky to be quality stuff. If you like beef jerky, you can't go wrong here (unless you are unfortunately allergic to wheat and soy). If beef jerky is not your favorite snack, I encourage you to give Bridgford's beef jerky a shot. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

review/text: These treats are huge, and they sell them at the boutique dog shops for $4.99 for one, so I'm happy to buy them in "bulk".  They work really well with my dogs because for some reason, my dogs don't like just plain old rawhide.  They like the chicken on top.  I don't buy the flavored rawhide because it usually stains.  And these treats last a long time.

review/summary: Hardly what I would call species appropriate, but better than kibble
review/text: The maker of this diet claims the following about NRG Maxim Grainless Dog Food Diet on the website:<br />"It is goodness you can actually see, not just when you read the label, but from the moment you open the box and recognize shredded fruits and vegetables like in your own trail mix.Enzyme active fresh fruits and vegetables provide enriched immune system support. Vegetable based carbohydrates combine with dietary fats to supply energy in a balance that does not stress the pancreas. Not only is meat the first ingredient, it is more than 1/2 the formulaFor everyday convenience NRG is the refreshing way to provide enzyme rich whole food nourishment...NO SHORT CUTS...Quality without compromise...<br />The Best Raw Food Value...1 KG of dry measure Maxim is caloricly equal to 10 lbs of frozen food."<br /><br />My notes:<br />Shredded fruits and veggies are simply filler and are not digested by dogs. On the other hand the powdered, raw veggies and fruit that the manufacturer knocks will offer some enzymes, vitamins, minerals, electrolytes, etc. Sadly the shredded produce in this product is simply a great way to waste your money ($15/lb for something that costs the manufacturer $1/lb). I am not against people making money, but I am against deceptive marketing. This product is better than a lot of pet foods, just don't fool yourself into thinking it's better than a home-prepared or commercial, frozen raw diet.<br /><br />As for meat being "more than 1/2 the formula..." I should hope so. Exactly when did it become acceptable to make meat and animal products less than 95% of the diet of a carnivore?<br /><br />As for this product being the best raw food value, I have to laugh. Even if the wet ("frozen") weight equaled 4.5 times the dry weight of the finished product you're still only getting about 50% meat. When I air-dry chicken the weight after drying is approximately 30% of what it was. Based on that, I'm doubtful there is truth to the statement "1 KG of dry measure Maxim is caloricly equal to 10 lbs of frozen food". I could see this was the case if the 10lbs of frozen food was different food.

review/summary: let's get cooking with Cardamom
review/text: Although Cardamom is an expensive seasoning, perhaps the most expensive after Saffron, the price on Amazon is still way too high. You can expect to pay between eight and nine dollars for this 1.75 ounce bottle by McCormick Gourmet Collection and of course you're also not forced to purchase it in packs of 3 in your local stores so get it at your supermarket and save (a lot). I appreciate Cardamom because it always adds a wonderful fragrance and flavor to both savory and sweet dishes. I do a lot of Asian cooking and often substitute Ginger for this. If you're not fond of fresh Ginger and find that dried Ginger tastes like sawdust you will be pleasantly surprised with Cardamom. It has a lemony-orange sweet taste but it's not at all overpowering or obnoxious like Ginger or the dreaded Turmeric. I am not sure why Amazon finds it prudent to add the word "decorticated" to the title. It's just going to confuse people even more. If you're looking for one hundred per cent pure ground Cardamom this is it.  McCormick also has a very long shelf-life for this, at least 3 years. Remember, it's always easy to spice up your life.

review/summary: Nice little charger
review/text: When my grandfater passed away a little over a year ago, I took over his horse boarding operation. In his last few years, he had several people "helping" him with things around the farm - including fence building & repair. What I found, unfortunately, was an absolute mess.<br /><br />Before reviewing this charger, let me state that NO charger will work properly if your fence is in poor condition. My grandpa had a mix of wire, poly-tape, and poly-rope. His charger was connected to thin copper wire, and it was a "continuous output" charger, which should NOT be used with the polytape or rope. It will simply burn through them, which was happening a lot. A continuous output charger also does not allow some animals to "release" from the fence, so I was finding a lot of dead birds.<br /><br />In learning what I needed to fix the fence properly, I had a GREAT conversation with a technician at Fi-Shock. So big points to them on customer service. This guy knew what he was talking about, and gave me some fantastic advice on the wire I needed and the proper charger to use. I replaced the copper line that fed the fence with insulated, galvanized high-voltage line. I also replaced most of the poly-rope with tape. Initially I had an older intermittant charger, but found that the insulator was burned out and it was running in a "continuous" mode, too. That charger was putting out a full 4,000v and felt like a snake bite, but it actually caused a section of my fence to catch on fire!<br /><br />I purchased the Fi-Shock SS-550X charger through Amazon for a great price, compared to the MSRP. The other chargers we had were Fi-Shock and had held up well. Plus I appreciated their customer support and the information on their web site. Hooking up the charger was easy. I really like the green and red connector screws because they are easy to identify, and easy to use with gloves on. The charger also has a light which is easy to spot and which flashes to indicate the intermittant function.<br /><br />I have now had this charger in use for a couple of months, and it seems to be working pretty well. My only concern is that for @8 acres of fence, I'm only testing out at about 2 lights (2,000v) on my tester. Per the manual, that's the expected number I should see. The charger is rated for "1.2 KV +/- 20% open circuit voltage" output to cover 15 acres, so it seems to be putting out the expected charge. It seems to be turning the horses for now, but I have NOT yet touched it yet (thankfully) to see how it feels. We just had an ice storm, and the SS-550X has hummed away while the fence was coated in ice - definitely a good thing! But for the keeping of four horses on 5 acres, I would like to have seen this charger be a little stronger (around 3k volts). When I would unhook my old charger, I'd get a little spark and the horses would jump. I liked that! They do not seem to register this one as much. I have my charger connected to two grounding rods to ensure I have a good ground.<br /><br />That said, my only real complaint - and the reason I have removed one star from my rating - is that recently the charger STOPPED working. Initially I could not figure out why. I checked the fuses, checked the fence, and checked the power source, but could not figure out the issue. Eventually I decided to just replace BOTH fuses (1/16 amp time-delay) with the extras from the package, which resulted in the charger working again. We had not had any storms in the area, so I can't imagine what might have caused the fuse(s) to burn out. Oddly, NEITHER one looks to be blown, so I could not tell on visual inspection which one was bad. So it was a little disconcerting to see that my fence could go down all the way without some failsafe. I understand that the fuses are there to protect the charger in the event of a surge, but SOME indication they were blow - such as a failure light, a beep, or having the charger light turn red or something - would have helped tremendously. Fortunately I had the extra fuses, so I was back up and running quickly. But I have NOT been able to find the "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FPAK00">Time Delay Fuse, 1/16 Amp</a>" at my local farm supply stores. If you are ordering the charger online, I would advise ordering extras.<br /><br />One final note: As a word of caution, this charger is intended for the keeping of livestock - not children. While a charged fence putting out @1500 volts may indeed keep unwanted animals and people off your property, it should NOT be implemented to keep children ON your property (as noted by the other reviewer). This charger has enough output to stop a human heart if the conditions are right.

review/summary: Had high hopes, but dogs still got out ....
review/text: I hate giving bad reviews, but unfortunately, this charger didn't work out for me as well as others.  I had an older Zareba 10 acre charger that worked fantastic, but recently quit due to a part of the wire shorting against the fence.  My fault for not checking the lines as often as I should.  Anyway, thought I'd give this 15 acre Fi-Shock a try to replace the Zeraba I had ... same company now, right?<br /><br />As it so happens, after basically rewiring everything in my yard from troubleshooting, it finally started to work.  I'm not sure what I did in order to get it working, but my assumption here is that it's not as "forgiving" with weeds and tall grass in those situations where you have to wait a few days before you can trim.  The Zareba had NO issues zapping through weeds.<br /><br />Advertised is 1200V but I managed to only measure 800V even at the box.  The furthest point from the charger measured 800V so my wiring is pretty good now I'd say.  Still, the dogs dug under the wire and got out the next day.  One is a longer haired dog and the other is short ... either stupid or it wasn't enough voltage - probably a combination of both.<br /><br />So, I'm hoping that even though that Fi-Shock owns Zareba, that it doesn't affect how Zareba makes their fence chargers.  I ended up returning the SS-550X and going with the 20 acre Zareba charger - a couple bucks cheaper but hoping it works at least as good as the 10 acre I had.<br /><br />Because it isn't putting out it's advertised voltage of 1200V, I assume either it's not working 100% or the description is slightly off.  Regardless, Amazon's return system is painless and fast.  Love shopping here!

review/text: Works very well over a large area.  keeps animals and children in the yard that needs to be kept in and other animals and children out that need to be kept out.  My kids and I had a bit of a competition to see who could hold on to the fence the longest. The dog got zapped twice and decided not to touch the fence again.  Although it does no harm I felt sorry for the dog, he must think some invisible foe is attacking him, he now knows to avoid the fence.  The cat seemed to sense the fence and waited until I turned it off to slip under the wire. Any person or animal touching it will get a fright and let go, it sure beats having kids get hurt on your property or fall into the pool etc.  and a sure way to keep animals in or out.  Fantastic product.

review/text: We cook with it regularly.  Ever since we began using it regularly my acid reflux has all but vanished.  I know that is one of the claims, and the reason we use it, but have to say, it's working for me and as far as I'm concerned that's good enough for me, plus its rock salt saltyness is excellent.  Use it.

review/summary: Exquisite Soft White Tea........ with an edge
review/text: After having tried this Dragon Pearl style tea in a friends Chinese restaurant (which was her personal stock) I set out to try to purchase something similar.  My friend is from Fuzhou, PRC and her family works in the tea industry there.  The product she gave me to drink looked like this product but must have been from another universe in flavor and quality.  This product is harsh and not at all smooth or with the fruity or flowery notes of the type she had.  This product has a coarse or harsh taste all the way through your drinking experience. Much like boiled peach pits. It is much harsher than my other White teas(loose) and actually taste worse than my Temple of Heaven Gunpowder Green Tea. Preparing the tea in your YiXing teapot chinese style will not improve your experience. It isn't what I would expect for the amount paid.  I also found the Phoenix Dragon Jasmine Pearl Green Tea only marginally better than this style.  I will not fault the service of the company only this product. Find a higher quality product.

review/summary: Yummy for a boxed soup--vegan, veggieful, healthful
review/text: I usually just don't buy canned/boxed veggie soups. I find most just plain suck. But this one is quite nice. Granted, it's a convenience soup, so it's not gonna shine like homemade, but it's quite convenient, yes, and flavorful and serviceable. Even my veggie-not-so-friendly hubby will eat this and enjoy it. This is great for those soup and sandwich lazy lunches, when I can split the box with hubby.<br /><br />It's got a nice texture, not too brothy or too thick. It's got a nice mouth feel. Not too acidic, as some veggie soups can be, overusing tomato. This is a great addition to a low-calorie/weight watching diet. The whole box is only 150 cals. There's lentils and brown rice in there, too, so you get some protein. (And it adds to the nice texture).<br /><br />Low calorie, with fiber and vegan-friendly, pleasant flavor. It's a good deal and in these economically-challenged times, great to take to work (if you keep a bowl there), as the package opens easily with just your hands. :)<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />UPDATE, 11-26-10: A commenter asked about the sodium. Here are the stats:<br />Nutrition: calories/cup 75, fat 0.5g, cholesterol 0g, sodium 440mg, total carbohydrate 14g, dietary fibers 4g, sugars 2g, protein 3g.

Our newborn cries a bit more when we put these on her which makes me believe they may be uncomfortable.  She has had more leaking and accidents leading to wardrobe changes in these diapers in comparison to the pampers brand.  They did have a nice notch for the umbilical cord.  I do like that they claim to be chlorine free and more sensitive.  I plan to try other chlorine free diapers to see if they have the same feel.

review/summary: Where have you been all my life?
review/text: Providing you haven't been permanently indoctrinated by the food police and medical researchers (who change their recommendations every 5-10 years without so much as an apology for their previous now-proved-incorrect recommendation) against the use of all fats and butterfat in particular, this can be a very useful, convenient, and I suspect healthy product. There is no end to the ways one might profitably use this product - - - as a coffee creamer, in preparation of hot cocoa, mashed potatoes, to fortify non-fat yogurt with the fat that was supposed to be there in the first place but was removed by the powers-that-be, etc., etc., etc. The secret to using it successfully so that it mixes well in liquids is this: place the amount of powder you wish to dissolve in a cup, glass, or other container, then add a VERY small quantity of liquid (milk, soy milk, hemp milk, rice milk, etc. all work well) and stir briskly with a spoon (plastic does the trick) until dissolved. This takes only a few seconds. The important thing is to resist the temptation to add more liquid than required initially - - - the amount of liquid should be less than required to cover the powder. After stirring well for a few seconds you will have a very serviceable liquid cream to which you can then add the amount of total liquid you wish to use, stirring again as you do so. I find it works better as a coffee creamer if the liquid cream is stirred well with somewhere between 2 oz and 6 oz of milk, soy milk, hemp milk, etc. before using. Otherwise it has a very strong cow's milk taste which some may find unpleasant. This method of preparation works well also for mashed potatoes. When using in something with the consistency of yogurt, just add a spoonful or so straight, without prior dissolving, and stir well for a moment. With proper use this product is so convenient, tastes so good, and improves the consistency and texture of certain foods so much you will not want to do without it once you try it. Oh, and if you are hesitating because of the price, keep in mind that a little bit goes a long, long way and the product has a long shelf life without requiring refrigeration.

I purchased the Nido (pack of 3 whole milk) powder from Amazon and mixed a can of that along with this powder and let me tell you....it has liquid half and half beat by a country mile and don't even get me going on how much better it is that that FAKEY powder creamer crap.  SO....I am givin' this review up to Mandy because I read hers and totally agreed and the FIRST person to review this product convinced ME to purchase it.  WHEN this is back in stock I will get more.  Any doubts still?  Read up on artificial creamers and SEE what the "long term" effects from ingesting that can be....it's scary!  By the way I vacuumed packed my "mix" and got 3 nice size bags of product.

review/text: The reason I am trying this out is because I use instant dry milk and to make it taste smoother I wanted to add just a little cream.  I have added the liquid but since I live a long way from a store I needed something that would keep for a long time.  This really works.  I was a little worried that the expense of the jar would be prohibitive to use on a regular basis but you only need a tablespoon to a half-gallon of mixed milk to give it a creamier taste,that is at least for me).  I am sure if you used this product in puddings or other milk products it would work just fine.  I did use it to make yogurt and the taste was great.

review/summary: Very Happy-No Corn Syrup Dry Cream
review/text: I bought this product with two goals in mind. First was a dry cream option that I could keep in my desk at work for coffee and tea. The second goal was to have some dry cream at home that could be used for medium term food storage and emergency substitution purposes. This product works well for both purposes.<br />For coffee and tea, this product works well as a low-carb, no corn syrup creamer. However, I found I like it best when mixed 1 part cream powder to 1 part dry whole milk powder (similar to what others have said). This does increase the amount of sugar per serving, but it is still significantly lower than anything else I have found. It does take a little stirring to get it to mix well, but this does not distract from the results.<br />I wonder if the price will drop if this product becomes more popular. Let's hope!

review/summary: Coffee Creamer taste test comparison
review/text: My wife and I just taste tested this product versus real heavy cream in coffee.  She was single blinded, while I knew which was which.  Made coffees and then added 1 teaspoonful of heavy cream and 1/2 teaspoonful of Heavy Cream Powder (initially) to each cup.  The "powdered" coffee was darker than the real cream coffee so I added more powdered cream to match the colors.  In the end I used about 1 full teaspoon of the powder.<br /><br />Though she thought the coffee with the real cream tasted slightly nuttier, which she preferred, she thought they were very close in flavor.  I thought they tasted almost identical, and did not prefer one over the other.<br /><br />It does not dissolve as quickly as I'd like, but it only took a little stirring to do the trick.  Once fully dissolved and stirred there were no visual differences in the coffees.<br /><br />I plan to use this at restaurants that don't offer real cream, and in camping recipes.  The manufacturer's web site does not currently offer any storage/shelf life info on the product, nor does the product packaging.  We are keeping it in our freezer.  The web site does not have any rehydrating suggestions or recipes, although it says it will in the future.

review/text: I did an experiment with Peak Powdered Whole Milk and Willpowder. We bought both, used both. Peak came out ahead on all counts. The Willpowder is good but another reviewer (Sophronia "Euphemia" in San Diego) hit the nail on the head: it tastes like evaporated milk and doesn't dissolve well - there's a consistency that is off-putting, for lack of a better word. (I still want to try the Nido product but it seems expensive) Keep in mind if you're on a low-carb diet, Willpowder is CREAM with zero carbs and Peak is powdered WHOLE MILK with carbs. You could also use the Peak to make so-called Hood milk and lower the carbs: Homemade Low-Carb Milk: One cup:<br /><br />1-2 Tbs. of heavy cream (depending on how creamy you want it)<br />1 1/3 Tbs. of instant dry milk<br />1 cup of cold water<br />sprinkle of salt<br />tiny sprinkle of Splenda (if you want)<br /><br />Just put the ingredients in and shake it up.

review/summary: Not optimal for a good cup of coffee
review/text: I found the baristas of my favorite cup of coffee (Philz Tesora) use heavy whipping cream and brown sugar. Over a few months I've been able to get close to the same great taste and quality, grinding my own beans and using the same ingredients, though it became a chore to always have heavy-cream on hand.<br /><br />While searching for alternatives I found this highly rated product. The thought of being able to have my favorite cup of coffee at home or even camping excited me but in the end this product let me down. Though it does soften up a black coffee like milk or heavy-cream does it adds somewhat of a light buttery finish to every sip that feels unnatural. Additionally the powder when mixed in to piping hot coffee never completely dissolves making it awkward to make someone a cup of coffee without explaining what the powder is.<br /><br />If you're not a picky coffee drinker, and just looking to soften black coffee to stay awake, this might be passible, but otherwise I'd use this product for other things besides coffee.<br /><br />Pros: Powdered, looks great, even has a spot on the container to list the opening date.  I assume this product will last forever.<br /><br />Cons: Unnatural light buttery flavor. Impossible to dissolve completely in beverages. No expiration date listed on the container and no protective seal under the lid to ensure freshness.

This would have been a nice option for hot, away from home locations and still have real cream.<br /><br />Think I will opt for an insulated container or a can of organic evaporated milk next time.  Really hoping this was going to be an option to the very unhealthy creamers on the market.

review/text: I had high hopes for this as a replacement for toxic coffee creamer, but it tastes rancid to me. Ruins my coffee and anything else I try to use if for.<br />In researching a bit, I read that any fat that gets "powdered" becomes rancid and damaged in the process, so maybe that's what is happening.<br />I wasted quite a few dollars. It's going in the trash.

review/text: I love to cook.  I love to eat.  I love Stubbs.  Ha, wasn't sure how I wanted to open this review and then `BAM', that happened.  Truth is, I really do love this stuff.  I'm not the biggest meat person in the world, and I'm certainly not the biggest BBQ person (I know, sacrilegious, especially for a Texan) but the other day, when rooting around for something to marinade my pork in, I happened across this stuff and it looked and sounded good, so I gave it a try (that, and the homemade BBQ recipe I was going to use looked like it would take far too long for my busy Sat. afternoon).  This stuff was so good that I've been using it on everything ever since, from sandwiches to pasta (yes, I said PASTA).  Anyways, if you like your meat a little on the sweet side then dive right it.  That sweet bourbon flavor has HUGE bite and really coats the meat well.

review/summary: Way Too Boozie
review/text: I love to make pulled pork sandwiches. It's very easy by putting in a 3 - 4 lb cheap cut of pork like a Boston Butt in a slow cooker along with 14 oz of beef broth on low over night. Then, remove the meat from the pot and put in it a baking dish. After it cools, pull it apart with forks and mix in a bottle of BBQ sauce and bake in the oven for 30 minutes.<br /><br />I decided to try this BBQ sauce for a change for my usual Sweet Baby Ray's. The other versions of Stubb's might be very good as I have not tried them but I found this to be way too boozie. That was about all I could taste. I love a little bourbon in BBQ sauce but it was extremely over-powering in this.

review/summary: Great Chai Tea!!  Amazing value!!  I LOVE IT!
review/text: I gave up coffee and have been drinking Chai Tea for almost a year now.  I've tried all different kinds of brands; numi, stash, celestial, tazo...etc.  Last one that I really liked was Numi.  I liked the subtle hint of spices that's not overwhelming, but nice and sophisticated.  However this India masala chai blew my mind.  It is the best chai i've ever had.  I should mention though that I usually take my chai w/ milk and honey.  What I do is I use 2 bags w/ 8oz boiling water, brew it for 3~4 min and put 1/2 cup of milk and 1 table spoon of honey.  If you drink your chai plain or if you like  mild chai this is not your brand, but if you like FULL & BOLD tasting Chai, this is your brand.  Besides it is amazing value!!!

But you get 72 tea bags per container, as opposed to 20 or 16 for all the other brands, at about the same price. So if you are like me and drink chai for breakfast every day, than it's hard to go wrong with this deal. One of the best tea bargains I have ever come across in a long time.

review/text: I haven't ordered this online, but I just wanted to say how much I LOVE this tea. I usually get the cardamon or the marsala chai, but I also have a soft spot for the ginger. I usually pick these up at a local Indian grocery for 2.99 a 60ct box. My mother, who introduced me to this brand, thinks its very strong and uses 1 teabag in about 12oz of water; Personally, I like my tea strong, so I tend to mix the same amount of water with two flavored + a basic black teabag. Mix in a little sugar and/or milk and its the perfect wake-me-up or after dinner drink (the ginger version is particularly good for that.) Our household goes through several boxes of these in a month!

review/summary: Amazon made me an offer I couldn't refuse
review/text: This is more a review of Amazon than tea:<br /><br />I'm a chai-drinking guy, enjoy a couple of mugs of hot, sweet, milky tea during the morning as I work and sharing a pot with my wife during the mornings on the weekend. I've tried many brands, some better than others, but the best I've found is TeaIndia's Masala Chai; my wife and daughter also like TeaIndia's Ginger Chai which has more of a bite.<br /><br />I first bought TeaIndia's Masala Chai at an Indian market when I was working 90 miles from home; $4.99 for a box of 72 bags. It was far better and also 75% less than the well-known American and British brands I'd been buying in 18- or 20-bag boxes. Later, I found this product at a small Indian market in my home town for $5.99, more than the other store but no 90-mile drive required.<br /><br />But when I went back for more they were out and didn't know when they'd get more. I like to support local businesses, but after several weeks of being told "sorry, we're still out" and drinking a not-as-good brand while I waited for more to come in, I checked with the TeaIndia site itself (too cumbersome to ship from India and no clear information on where else I could buy locally) and then with Amazon.<br /><br />Amazon carried TeaIndia for a case price (six boxes in a case) for less than $20; that's about $3.33 plus shipping. And six boxs at a time is not a problem, each box is sealed and could sit on my shelf just as well as the grocer's; or we could keep the unopened boxes in the garage refrigerator or freezer to ensure it wasn't going stale.<br /><br />Then I saw the subscription offer - if I agreed to have Amazon automatically send an amount I chose (1 case in this instance) and at an interval I specified (I chose every 6 months) and bill me automatically, the price was less than $17 and the shipping was free. So now I'm getting my favorite tea, won't have to drive and hunt for it, won't run out and will be paying less than $2.90 for a box of 72 bags. Thanks, Amazon, I think I'll go pour myself another mug of tea.

review/text: I'm not a big tea-drinker, but I do enjoy Tazo Organic Chai Tea.  I purchased Tea India Masala Chai (box of 72 bags) at a local Indian market (about $5).  I have to use two bags per cup to get much flavor (is the tea stale??), and I find the taste a little cardboard-y -- the first sip just makes me grimace.  Also, the tagless/stringless bags are a little tricky to squeeze out -- nothing to hang onto while you move the bag around in your tea-bag squeezer. I'm going to hand this tea over to my friend who seems to like all tea and any tea.

This has a strong smell - kind of a harsh dried orange peel smell  but doesnt have any real spice flavour.  This is a total waste and honestly  I dont understand how it got such great reviews from others.<br /><br />Money wasted.

The data safety sheet shows it to cause brain cancer and has actually been tested on humans. That's why I have stayed away from anti-perspirants for years. I finally gave up with plain deodorant and tried this product. Degree Girl Just Dance doesn't contain dimethicone so feel great using it!! I find that it works great for those who get smelly armpits. This makes my armpits stay nice and fresh. And trust me, just deodorant wasn't doing the trick. I'm a happy girl now!

Some days of the week I have 5+ hours of martial arts training and this product holds me over perfectly. On normal days it definitely lasts 24 hours, maybe even more. In general, I feel like the deodorant side of it is more effective than the antiperspirant side. After an hour of an intense cardio workout it might get a *little* moist, but that could also be the surrounding skin so who knows. I have forgotten what my sweat smells like. The fragrance is nice and light, so it won't overpower your perfume and generally blends in nicely.

review/summary: This may be the best tea I've ever had
review/text: I am a tea lover.  I won't touch coffee, not even mocha or coffee icecream.  Over the years I've gotten to know various different teas and tea brands.  Adagio is one of the best brands I've tried and its prices are better than average for tea of this quality.<br /><br />Yunnan Gold is Adagio's premium grade Yunnan tea.  Its lower grade, Yunnan Jig, is quite good and very inexpensive, but Yunnan gold is fantastic.  It is an assertive tea, able to stand up nicely to milk and sugar, but it isn't the slightest bit bitter.  I have had it black and it was still tasty, but I prefer to have black teas light and sweet.  Even when I have accidentally over-steeped it (you should steep it for about 3 minutes), it was smooth and mellow.  There is a natural sweetness to this tea and very complex flavors that are spicy yet subtle.<br /><br />FYI, this is considered a black tea.  Black teas are so named, based upon how long they are allowed to ferment.  Green tea has the least fermentation, oolong has some fermentation, and black teas are allowed to reach complete fermentation.  Generally speaking the more a tea is fermented the more caffiene it contains.<br /><br />This is a perfect all day tea.  A pleasure first thing in the morning, and yet delightful all day and into the night (it has caffiene so if you have insomnia avoid drinking it and all caffiene beverages after 4 PM).  If you like bold tea, like a hearty Assam or Cylon, this tea might be too delicate for you, although I still suggest you give it a try, you might be seduced by its many virtues.

It's my start of the day. No sugar, no milk, no lemon. My only wish is that Adagio start packing bigger quantities, for customers who live on this side of Atlantic.

review/summary: Great Customer Service - Not so great antlers
review/text: I have 2 boxers and 1 boston/pug mix - my dogs love, love, love antlers and unfortunately after about 24 hours, I had to remove these antlers from my dogs because they started breaking apart into small sharp pieces. The first time I purchased antlers from a different vendor, they lasted for a few months with daily chewing and they never once broke into smaller pieces.<br />On the other hand, the customer service was great. There was a minor mix-up on the ship date and since I received the package one day late, they refunded the shipping cost.

review/summary: Rave reviews
review/text: I didn't get a chance to sample these organic cookies myself, but I sent a box to my sister in law as an advance Easter pick-me-up surprise and they have been a phenomenal hit. The cookies are delicious and look great, and  Beautiful Sweets has a whole variety of themes for year-round occasions.<br />One very minor issue, I wish the product page had specific information about shipping times. It took Beautiful Sweets about a week to ship my order; there's nothing wrong with that, but it would just be nice to know, especially when you're used to Amazon shipping everything so quickly.<br />On the positive side, they emailed with tracking number as soon as the package shipped.<br /><br />I will definitely be ordering more from Beautiful Sweets in the future. Sister In Law doesn't know it yet, but she's getting the Halloween special!

review/summary: Great for older cars that need the benefit of Glucosamine & chondroitin
review/text: My cat is 13 years old and didn't move around as well as he used to. A friend of mine had great results taking human glucosamine and chondroitin supplements. We looked at the natural supplements available- and there was no way that my cat was going to let me give him pills everyday, unless I wanted to be shredded and bit(he is a bit feisty about meds). These treats, given only 3 small ones a day are the perfect answer. He will jump on my lap to get to these, he loves them (and he is kinda picky). He does seem to be moving a lot better these days.

review/summary: Cats with arthritis
review/text: These do not look or smell very appetizing, but Casper loves them. He has been having his statutory 2 a day and wants more. He has found where they are stored and has demolished 3 paper towel rolls in an effort to get at the bags.<br />I haven't seen a dramatic improvement in his legs yet, but it does seem he is not limping quite so much. Time will tell. ***UPDATE**** Time did tell - NO MORE limping - brilliant!!!

review/text: I gave this to my elderly cat who has been clearly having troubles getting around for a while.  The very next day the difference in behavior was obvious - my other cat was even impressed by his greater willingness to play.  Simply amazing, I wish I had known about this years ago.

review/summary: Perfect cat treats!
review/text: My cats go NUTS for these treats!!!  I've been looking for a cat treat I can give to my cat who is allergic to any type of mammal or poultry protein (have to get food from the vet) and these are just fish plus some barley and vitamins (see ingredient list).  Most treats have a chicken or beef base, even if they're fish flavored.  What a relief to find these, and the glucosamine/condroitin is just a nice bonus, since my cats are getting a bit older (9 and 14, respectively).  Oh, and did I mention they LOVE THESE TREATS?  The allergic kitty spends lots of his free time sitting in front of the cabinet where I store these treats, looking wistfully at the door.  (Um, isn't it all free time for cats?  Right.  He pretty much lives in the kitchen now...)  Try these!!

review/summary: Zukes Hip Action
review/text: I had been buying Cosequin from my vet for my slightly overweight (OK .. obese) cat Jackson.  It cost $45 per month.  It was helpful for years, but recently he had begun limping again (at age 14).  I learned of Zukes Hip Action and decided to try it just for fun.  Jackson is now jumping on furniture, no longer limps and has a silky smooth coat .. all in about 6 weeks.  AND .. it costs about 1/10 as much and Jackson LOVES it!  Strongly recommended.

review/summary: I'm in shock!
review/text: When I took my 15-year-old, overweight cat in for a senior wellness exam, the vet. said the x-ray showed serious arthritis.  I just thought she wasn't getting out of her cat bed because she was elderly and tired.  The doctor prescribed Adequan, but either I didn't get the medication into her muscle properly (entirely possible) or it just didn't work for her; I saw no difference.  I tried Cosamin, but my cat seems to be able to smell it, no matter how carefully I mix it in, and won't eat even tuna if it has that in or on it.<br /><br />Then I saw these in a store.  Although I was certain they wouldn't work and doubtful my finicky cat would even eat them, I figured, What the heck -- it's worth a shot.  Wow!!  After a few days, she started perking up and moving around, and now she acts more like the cat I knew a few years ago.  She even "smiles" more!  And crucially, she still loves these treats -- she doesn't seem to get tired of them.  She is (as I mentioned) overweight, so I give her 3 a day.  I wish they would make them in more flavors than just chicken and salmon, but like I said, so far, she hasn't gotten tired of them, even without the extra variety.  Thank heavens for these treats!
