review/summary: Amazing!!
review/text: I kept hearing about this product, and finally decided to order it.  WOW!!!!  It is amazing!  So much so that I've already ordered a second one (after less than a week) because I don't want to run out!  It has replaced my morning coffee.  It's not one of those you have to make yourself drink, it's actually really delicious and enjoyable!  Definitely a must have!!!

review/summary: Holy Click! This stuff is amazing!
review/text: My first shipment arrived today and I am soooo pleased! I mixed mine with 1.5 cups milk and shook it for 60 seconds. Tastes like a chocolate milkshake with a hint of coffee. I drank it down to the last half cup and it was chunky at the bottom. I shook it another minute, still chunky. Added a bit more milk, shook another minute - still chunky. Fortunately the chunks are very tasty. Tomorrow I will try it in the blender and see how that works out. If I don't like it I think I will have to invest in the shaker cup with the mixing ball because I'm sure I will be drinking this every day. I drank it at 11:15 AM and by the time I got to the gym I felt euphoric - definitely enough caffeine for the 1-cuppa-day-kinda-girl that I am. I buzzed through my hour long circuit training class like never before! I didn't start to feel hungry until about 3 PM, ate an apple, then still had enough energy to do a 20 minute zumba class on my wii. Phenomenal!! I have my amazon auto shipment set at once a month, but now that I see that there are only 14 servings in a container I am switching it to every 2 weeks. I never want to run out!

review/summary: For what it is, it's great.
review/text: I'm not expecting my protein drink to actually taste exactly the same as a mocha from the corner cafe. I think that would fall under the category of "unreasonable expectations". But if for some reason, you must supplement your protein intake artificially (as I must), this is a very nice option. I frankly can't begin to understand the complaints here about it being hard to prepare. I add two scoops to about a third of a cup cold, nonfat milk, stir it smooth (just using a spoon, with no problem), fill the rest of the mug with water and nuke it until it's drinking-range hot.<br />Note: Do not heat it to near boiling and then sit it by you to slowly cool as you sip, like you might with a real coffee drink. Too much heat curdles protein, powders, and *yuck!* (I think this is what's been happening to those who complain of its lumpiness, or "boogery" texture.) Just heat up it to the temperature that feels comfortable to drink.<br /><br />I really look forward to my Click every morning, just as I used to with my morning coffee. Now if only it was so dang expensive.

review/summary: Yummy treat
review/text: I'm getting ready for RNY (gastric bypass) so I'm trying out all the protein powders and trying to lose some weight before surgery as well.<br /><br />Came across a review for click on one of the RNY websites I frequent and they rave about Click so I thought I'd try it.<br /><br />It's 2 scoops of yum! It's not really something I'd drink each day for my protein requirements but more like an additional - instead of my coffee or maybe instead of the local "fourbucks." It's great in a bullet with some ice and tastes just like a frappy type drink. You can also add it to your regular coffee as added protein.<br /><br />I'm happy that I found it. I like the Vanilla more than I like the Mocha and I'm usually a chocolate lover.<br /><br />Great product, worth the money. Great for a splurge and to shake things up.

I like to mix 1:1 on the mocha and vanilla myself with some soy milk and ice, blended. Delicious.

review/text: I am a lap-band patient and was having a very hard time finding a protein shake that I actually could stomach, but this one is the winner.  I use fat-free milk, and some vanilla almond milk to mix mine up.  Its quick, tasty, and gives a nice jolt with the espresso already in the mix!  I have yet to try it hot, but for quick and easy cold mixing I highly recommend one of those blender bottles.  I also like their new flavor: vanilla latte.

review/text: This is my favorite morning protein supplement! I start everyday with Click. My favorite part is that it is GREAT made with water as directed--unlike other powders that don't have great taste or texture unless mixed with milk. It mixes really well and as long as you stir half-way through heating (as directed) and don't over-heat (scald) the consistency is great. I'll take this anyday over fancy coffee drinks from a coffee shop!

review/text: I am THE original drinker of click and what I mean by that is I am a personal friend of Greg Smith (owner) and have been drinking click since he invented it and gave it to me at the gym in a mason jar probably 3 years ago!! This has been a great healthy alternative for a person who was a regular customer at Starbucks every morning, and better yet it is cheaper!!  I crave click every morning over any coffee!!  After my early morning workout it gives me my vitamins, minerals and most important the espresso boost I need to jump start my day. My preferance is to drink it cold, it mixes well in water and if you want some extra protein just add milk, an egg, or my personal favorite is a scoop of muscle milk protein.

review/summary: Too sweet and messy
review/text: The taste: B+<br /><br />This drink is quite tasty. It isn't the best instant coffee drink I've ever had, but close.<br /><br />But it is way too sweet for my taste. I put only one scoop (instead of the recommended two scoops) in a glass of water, and it is still too sweet. But this comes from me who usually drink black coffee, so may be just my personal preference.<br /><br />The fact that this drink uses primarily fructose instead of glucose doesn't help either. The recent studies show that fructose is "more bad" than glucose due to heart disease and diabetes concerns. (I provided a scientific link here, but it was edited out by Amazon. But you can search on the Internet.)<br /><br />Primarily because of the sweetness, this drink is enjoyable at the beginning, but by the time you have had just a few sips, it becomes tiring, as if the only remaining dominating flavor is its sweetness, and there is very little other fragrance left. In contrast, a good espresso or latte drink maintains a strong fragrance all the way.<br /><br />However, it is an energy drink, so it is unfair to compare it with espresso or latte on the taste department. I'm just reviewing on this so readers may have proper expectations.<br /><br />The convenience: C+<br /><br />You shouldn't buy this just for its convenience, which is lacking for this product. It isn't easy to prepare this drink at all. For a hot drink, for example, it takes many steps, including mixing, shaking, microwave, stirring, microwave again, and shaking again. It isn't terribly difficult to do if you really want to have the drink, but frankly, I find it easier to prepare real espresso on my automatic espresso machine.<br /><br />In addition, it can be quite a messy experience to have this drink. Must be because it's a protein drink, the container becomes very dirty and very difficult to clean even if you try to clean it right away.<br /><br />The nutrition: Don't know. Supposedly good.<br /><br />But to be fair, I believe most people buy this product for healthy reasons, not for its sheer taste or convenience. I'm not exactly sure how it performs in the energy department, as I have no trustworthy way to measure, but the nutritional ingredients in this drink would indicate that it is far more nutritious than regular coffee.

review/text: Click is a fantastic protein drink.  I don't give it five stars because when its made by the directions it really is only mediocre.  But make it with 14oz of skim milk and pour it over ice it is as fantastic as the other reviews rave.  I don't recommend blending it with ice it separates in more powerful blenders and gets a bad tasting froth. I make it every day and would gladly choose Click over other beverage indulgences like hot chocolate or a milk shake, not just because its a healthier choice but because it tastes as good.

review/summary: Confirmed Click-a-holic
review/text: As a recent weight loss surgery patient, I found that my tastes had changed significantly after surgery and I could not use any of the protein supplements suggested by my doctors. I tried a dozen alternatives and found that I could not use any of them and this is a very bad thing for WLS patients. I then tried Click as recommended by the good folks at BTV ([...]) and I was hooked. It tastes great, like a mocha from Starbucks but with only 120 calories per serving. I got 15 grams of protein. I got a buttload of vitamins and minerals as a bonus and I cannot recommend this highly enough. The energy boost works well since I substitute a Click for breakfast. A kick in the pants to get me going, 120 calories and enough protein that I don't get hungry. What's not to love?

review/text: Tried this to have a high protein beverage at work that I could quickly mix and drink when I did not have time for a "real" lunch.  I have tried this hot and cold and the taste is good.  The problem is it does not mix well.  It does OK with a blender or one of those special blender bottles with the interior ball for mixing, but not by just shaking.  It takes too long to get it to mix and even then there are clumps of stuff.  The clumps make it hard to clean up (very sticky on the containers used).  I might as well just heat a can of soup.

Coffee Coolatta from Dunkin Donuts has about 700 calories and 80 grams of sugar, I had to eliminate it from the diet.

Healthy protein, low sugar iced coffee slushy.<br /><br />I also like adding other vanilla or chocolate protein powders, instant coffee, vanilla extract, or regular coffee.<br /><br />I prefer the vanilla to the mocha, but both taste excellent.

It's smooth and the coffee flavor covers up the protein flavor for the most part. I add a little sugar free syrup or a dash of pumpkin spice and a little pumpkin and I have a satisfying drink that wont take 500 calories out of my day. I do use a Magic Bullet to mix mine though, but with that I have never had an issue with mixing it. I have also never tried it warm, so I can't comment on that either. I have been a loyal customer for over a year now and will likely remain so.

review/summary: CLICK Espresso Protein Drink
review/text: A+ ... I have been using CLICK Espresso Protein Drink with PB2 for over a week now.  Before purchasing I had been using another whey protein powder that was NOT very tasty, but none of them ever are, they are just a recovery drink for after I run. So, I was curious to see if this one would be any different as so many were saying.<br /><br />They are right, it has a wonderful strong coffee taste, not bitter, no aftertaste and I had no problems with mixing it in the CLICK shaker that I purchased with this.  I like the size of the CLICK shaker, its small & measures easily ~ my other shaker for the health food store is too big. I'm not sure why others say it doesn't mix well, since I had no problems.  I did try to put it in my coffee to see how it would taste & it was a no go. It did not mix in hot coffee very well, but then again, that's not what it's meant for. I do use room temp bottled water when mixing, as I am a freak of nature & do not care for cold water, but, for the review, I chilled after mixing & it stayed mixed up and maintained it's great flavor. If you add PB2 expected very small "nutty" residue to remain from the PB2 and not from the CLICK. This is not an issue, just worth mentioning.<br /><br />Energy rush is not so prevalent for me, but I can see where someone could be speeded up with this drink, so if you high blood pressure I do not recommend this. I do NOT recommend this for kids or teens because of that fact. I just like the good coffee taste in my protein drink. I do recommend the PB2 for a healthy additive to this protein drink as well.

review/summary: Mix up early, enjoy later
review/text: I'm new to Click, I love it!  I have learned to mix it up about 2 hours earlier, and just let it sit, either on the counter, or in the refrigerator.  You get a smoother drink.  I'm using a shaker with the wire ball.  Second tip, this does have 12g of carbs if you're counting, but the good news is a half-recipe is actually a good size, which is ONE scoopful with ONE cup of water, and then poured over ice.  It's perfect for an afternoon pick-me-up.  It's not necessary to make the 2-scoop version unless you're hungry.  I havent used it in a blender yet, I'm still just pouring over ice, but one day I'll make up a frappe.  You'll be pleased when you see how the dry powder more fully blends with water if you just let it "set a spell."  Of course, you also get twice as many drinks if you train yourself to have a smaller one.

review/summary: Tastes like Choc milk w/ Coffee boost!
review/text: This is amazing stuff! Does not taste like a typical protein shake, yet it isn't over-powering with coffee flavor. When mixed with water (12oz) it gets a nice chocolate/coffee flavor. I've mixed half black coffee, half water and it gives an extra caffeine boost. Definitely helps curb appetite and a good addition for protein in my diet. Love the Mocha flavor and the Vanilla is just as good!!

review/summary: Best Protein Supplemental Ever!
review/text: Until now protein powders have given me a lump in my throat. I've tried and tried to drink them. I've spent hundreds of dollars on canisters of different powders, different flavors, only to give them away to my grown kids.<br /><br />Then I saw an ad for Click. I thought, "Why not. Let's try another one. The kids will drink any protein powder I don't like."<br /><br />When it arrived I mixed one up and realized that this is not your average protein powder. It was smooth and didn't leave that huge lump in my throat. I added a little non-dairy creamer and poured it over ice and was astounded! Wow! What a great glass of iced coffee!<br /><br />The kids don't even get offered a glass, let alone get a canister of this stuff.<br /><br />I like the vanilla even more than the mocha and they now have a decaf version.<br /><br />The bottom line: This protein supplement tastes like a nice coffee and not a protein powder.

review/summary: Best protein I've had
review/text: This is my absolute favorite protein mix. I mix one scoop with 8oz of really cold milk and just sit back and enjoy. It almost reminds me of coffee ice cream. You can actually use this stuff in ice cream to make a less sugar/higher protein treat. You can bake with it as well. You can drink it hot or cold. There are so many different flavors that can come of it when you use flavored syrups. Bariatric friendly, for sure. 2 years post gastric bypass and no negative effects.

review/summary: Best Protein Drink Out There!
review/text: As a weight loss & fitness blogger and runner, I've tried so many protein drinks. CLICK is by far the most delicious - yes! it's delicious - product out there. The mocha is my favorite, and for only 120 calories per serving, I know it's not going to blow my diet. It's great pre- or post- workout, as a meal replacement (made with milk), a snack, hot, cold, blended. You name it. I always feel great when I drink CLICK, energized, never shaky.

review/summary: Its Click-a-reffic
review/text: Funny that I got the email to review Click Mocha, as I just made a shake and sat down at the computer. This stuff is wonderful. I prefer mine cold with soy milk, ice, water, and some Torani Sugar Free Syrup. I drink a click shake every day, often two times a day. I had gastric bypass surgery in Jan. 2011 and Click helps me get some needed fluids in and gives me that little boost of energy. I've always bought it from Amazon via subscribe & Save as they have it $10 less pluss free shipping than I can find it anywhere else, even from Click.  Get that yummy coffee drink without having to deal with the snobby girl who seems insulted that they even have to work, just because you are there to spend money. Make it yourself, many other ways to enjoy click than my choice to make it a shake.

But buy it for the flavor: it is absolutely the best decaffeinated tea I have found.

review/summary: Exquisitely good
review/text: I LOVE coffee. I not only grind my own beans, I roast them as well, and try beans from all over the world. At the same time, I am unable to eat anything containing sugar (or other sweeteners or chemical additives). So when I happened upon this coffee extract at a local store and realized it was simply pure extract of coffee, with nothing added, I bought the one bottle they had.<br /><br />Wow! The stuff is exquisitely good. For lunch I often make myself a protein and fruit "shake" with a banana, apple, homemade yogurt, an egg, a little orange juice -- and a tiny shot of this extract (a little goes a long way), all topped with a sprinkle of nutmeg. The extract adds amazing and complex coffee flavor: rich with simultaneously subtle overtones. Though I no longer eat wheat or other grains either, I CAN imagine how good this would be in cake or other baked goods. (I intend to try it in a couple of the nut-flour based baked items I make, using it instead of almond extract.)<br /><br />This is the only Bakto Flavor extract I've tried (so far). But based on how good it is, I certainly intend to try more of them. And I very much appreciate that they have no additives, and especially not sugar (or alchohol). My only regret is that it doesn't come in a bigger bottle. And it's a tad expensive -- though I understand why!

They also remind me of being in Scotland (my favorite foreign country to visit). The ginger oatcakes are to die for if you like ginger and/or ginger cookies. They aren't too sweet and they are very addicting to just eat by themselves. I also found them to be a wonderful substitute for graham crackers if you want to make a cracker crust for your pumpkin pie. The ginger in these crackers really goes well with the pumpkin. Even my friends and family who aren't wheat-free loved the pie crust these made.

review/text: These are by far the best rice cakes I have tried. They are really crunchy and don't have that styrofoamy quality that most cheap rice cakes have. They also taste great. Not too salty or too sweet - you can actually taste the rice. Only complaint is that they crumble a lot and have to be careful not to drop all that goodness on the floor. That means I have to use a plate or eat them over the sink. In any case, they taste so good that this minor problem will not prevent me from buying them again.

review/summary: Awesome source of clean carbs.
review/text: **EDIT 5/6/12: How did these go from $22.95 (subscribe and save) to $45.68!?!?! Outrageous!!**<br /><br />These brown rice cakes are one of the best sources of clean carbohydrates you'll find. Nothing but brown rice. They are also great because they are ready to eat out of the package. Anyone that's concerned about their diet knows that it's difficult to find clean carbs that are low on the glycemic index and that is convenient to eat. This is one of the only items that really covers all those bases. In fact, talk to any serious bodybuilder (they are the most extreme dieters of all the athletes) and they will tell you that these are a staple of their diet, especially when they're prepping for a show.<br /><br />Some people here complain about the fact that they crumble. That is due to the fact that there is nothing in them to make them stick together! In fact, I'm surprised that they stick together at all.<br /><br />Others say that they don't taste that great and that they're bland. Well, again; it's just brown rice! Nothing more.<br /><br />If you're looking for something that tastes fantastic and that sticks together like glue, get some rice crispy treats. But, if you want clean carbs that are low on the glycemic index, and that are convenient and ready to eat, this stuff is pretty much the best there is.

review/text: I was looking for an alternative to bagels and came across <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FVZW7K">Lundberg Eco-Farmed Brown Rice Cake, Salt Free, 8.5-Ounce Units  (Pack of 12)</a> and,  based upon the reviews, decided the product was worth a try.<br /><br />The product was so nicely packaged, doubled wrapped for freshness and in a carton with each unit separated by cardboard to keep crumbling at a minimum.  I really wasn't expecting much since I had tried plain rice cakes before but never developed any enthusiasm for them.  However, this brown rice cake was such a nice surprise that I have added the product to my subscribe and save favorites.<br /><br />I chose the salt free because the toppings I choose usually provide more than enough salt already.  Depending on whether I am in the mood for spicy or sweet, I enjoy these rice cakes with hummus or peanut butter, etc.  The cakes are so light and easy to digest and seem to go well with all sorts of toppings.

review/summary: Guilt-free cake
review/text: Okay, it is nothing at all like a birthday cake, but if you like something with a little taste, that is chewy and nutritious, these salt-free rice cakes made with brown rice is a good choice.<br />I wish they wouldn't crumble quite so much, but it is worth it for these little treats.

review/summary: Dry and Edible; they fall apart in your hand, not in your mouth
review/text: I ordered these in an attempt to have healthier snacks. I usually enjoyed the taste and texture of rice cakes. Maybe this is just what brown rice cakes are like versus the white I'd previously known, but these were the driest rice cakes I'd ever known. Most of the rice cakes fell apart somewhat at the slightest touch, and as I finally eat the last bag after four months with them, I have a spare bag of the crumbs which is almost entirely full.<br /><br />On the plus side, they are rather shelf stable. The first bite months ago was as good as the last one.

review/summary: Great olives and a great price
review/text: I've ordered these olives three times, and will definitely be ordering again. The only reason I'm not giving them a five star review is that I find the brine to be way too salty, but I fix this by rinsing them thoroughly and then soaking them in plain water in the frig overnight, then draining and storing in a gallon baggie. The olives are big and very delicious once I've gotten rid of the excess salt.

review/text: I tried these at my local market just because they were new and looked delicious.  Extra large pumpkin seeds, who wouldn't want them.  I bit into a handful and they were the saltiest tasting thing I had ever ingested.  It literally tasted like I had swallowed a teaspooon of salt.  Germack generally delivers a high quality snack, but these are horrible.  STAY AWAY unless you need a sudden boost in your salt intake, because these will sour your stomach.

review/text: Bought this at Ralphs, 1 for $4.49 to try and was unimpressed. The high protein is great, but you can find that in other grocery store products. The high fiber is great for diets, and you can't find this high in any other pasta, but it tastes and is the texture like macaroni for kids. It definitely tastes and feels better than some "healthy" pastas available, but I'm just not sold on this. If you want low net carbs and that's your main goal, definitely use this and add in meats, veggies, and cheese to your dish for a good meal.

review/summary: satisfying snack
review/text: The Alpsnack bars have a nice semi crunchy texture, and complex flavor.  The bar is a mix of dried fruit, brown rice crisps, and hemp nuts, and the flavors of these manage to remain relatively distinct as the bar has not been blended into a homogenous mass. (unlike many other bars on the market)<br /><br />The Coconut Mango Papaya Alpsnack is my favorite, but the other flavors are good too.  I usually eat Banana or Apple Lara bars, but Lara bars are heavy on dates, and have a dense sticky texuture.  Alpsnacks provide a nice change, and can stave off hunger for a long time.  This is likely due to the high protein content of hemp nuts.<br /><br />The Alpsnack's biggest fault might be the texture, which is not fully crunchy - semi soft rice crisps aren't ideal, and the bars are mildly crumbly - but I think this a natural result of the Alpsnack being a packaged product.  Additionally, the flavor is a bit unusual, probably due to the hemp nuts.<br /><br />Overall, an excellent product, one of the few energy bars I have seen with a low sugar (and salt) content in addition to mainly unprocessed ingredients.  These are my new favorite snack bars.

review/summary: Excellent kit wine
review/text: I have been having very good luck with this company's Amarone della Valpolicella kits, following Paul Keller's instructions for making better wine from kits (easily found using google). My first such kit is a year since start of vinification, 6 months in the bottle, and has had compliments from friends who are wine connoisseurs saying it shows excellent promise for a year-old wine.<br /><br />This is my second Barbaresco kit; the first is not yet ready to bottle (~80 days since fermentation began), but already tastes very nice for such a young wine. This kit may end up producing better wine than the Amarone. My only qualm is that the labels they ship with the kit say "Barbera". Barbaresco is made from Nebbiolo grapes, not Barbera, so I'm not sure whether this is really Barbaresco or Barbera. Either way it shows promise.

review/text: This is a good wine kit. The wine is very dry. Tastes somewhere between a Cabernet and a Merlot. The kit has juice, corks, labels, chemicals and capsuls. I bottled a case dry and sweetened the rest. It would have been nice if there was some potassium sorbate included with the chemicals so you could use it if sweetening the wine. Wow what a major difference when sweet. You get more of the fruity taste out of the wine. I am well pleased and looking forward to trying other varieties from this vendor. It would be nice to know the dryness of the wine in the description. I would highly recommend this to anyone.

I almost got third degree burns from the first bite, but I was hooked.<br /><br />This is Matouk's flagship sauce, and it is very very hot. Made with Congo Peppers, or Chocolate Habaneros<br />from Trinidad. This habanero ranges from about 325,000 to 425,000 Scoville units, and matures to a deep purple<br />brown color. This is an absolutely scorching puree of blazing peppers. The hottest sauce I've found without<br />capsaicin extract added. Particularly good on fish, but my favorite use is as a finisher for pork tenderloin<br />on the grill. Careful not to serve this to guests unless you have a couple of gallons of yogurt around to help<br />soothe the burn. 5 Scovies!

It is not hot like "Dave's" or "After Death" or the other concentrates but it is about as close as you can get and still have really good flavor. It is the hottest sauce that you can find that actually tastes good.  If you are an experienced pepper lover that is tired of novelty sauces that taste like cardboard this is a must try. It is really really hot and really really good!

review/text: This hot sauce packs some pretty good heat and the flavor is pretty good too.  I first found Matouks Salsa Picante Hot Pepper Sauce and then tried this flavor (Flambeau) out because I thought it might be hotter.  In my opinion, it is about the same level of hotness and the Salsa Picante has a little bit better flavor.  Bottom line is that they are both great hot sauces but I lean towards Matouks Salsa Picante Hot Pepper Sauce flavor.  I've also shared both of these flavors with hot sauce aficionados and they all agreed with above sentiments.

review/summary: Tender
review/text: I was a little concerned to buy the popcorn, as you never know what you are going to get.  But I did and I am glad I did.  The popcorn is nice and tender, pops easy, great taste and hull-less.  I have moved from the microwave popcorns and glad I did because of this product.  I like the fact the the popped corn is small but great!

review/summary: Shipping is INSANE!!!
review/text: I love the popcorn, but the shipping costs are INSANE!! A total rip off. Wabash Valley Farms or Amazon or whoever is charging the shipping is out of their mind. 5 Stars for the popcorn. Minus 4 stars for the terrible cost associated with shipping. Argh...Yes, the popcorn is tender and luscious, and it melts in your mouth like you're eating cooked grasshoppers, but come on!!! Can't you ship this product for less?<br /><br />Shipping the 6 pound bag is even worse. *sigh* Too bad really.
