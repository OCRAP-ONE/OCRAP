review/summary: Greatest stuff ever!
review/text: I absolutely love PB2! Most of the time I just put some in a baggie and take it to work. During a break, I will pour a little water into the baggie and mix it by squeezing the bag a few times. That way I don't have to carry a spoon to work or wash a bowl when I get home. I dip a banana into the mixed up PB2 and have an awesome snack!<br /><br />  Another way that I like to eat it is mixed up in some plain Greek yogurt. I mix a spoonful of PB2 and a spoonful of sugar-free jelly into a 5.3 oz Oikos Greek yogurt container. It is delicious just like this or spread on some toasted thin buns. Mmmmm....mmmmmm!<br /><br />  The only downside is that I don't like it by itself. It has to be on a banana or an apple or be mixed with something.

review/summary: A very good food product!
review/text: Hi! I bought this from Warehouse Deals. Product arrived in an airtight bag which looked a bit small for the money. When mixed with water to reconstitute the amount of peanut butter seemed okay. Product tasted very fresh. This is an excellent product if you like peanut butter but worry about fats and oils. Most are removed. I recommend the product. It has multiple uses. Can mix with honey, use as a topping and of course make peanut butter cookies. That last one is my favorite. PB cookies are my weakness.

review/summary: Amazing for peanut butter lovers who watch their calories
review/text: So, I am a peanut butter fiend - I admit it!  However, I am very health conscious, and I realize I can't eat peanut butter all day and stay thin. However, you really could eat PB2 all day and still successfully watch your weight.  This stuff is remarkably good, and I've tried just about everything out there in terms of lower calorie peanut butter substitutes.  I absolutely crave this stuff - So, if you love your PB&J but don't want to trade in for a larger pair of pants, then PB2 is the way to go.  It really does taste great.  When it comes in these 16 oz. bags like this, they're a bit messy. Powder seems to get everywhere.  I usually pour them into a large zip-lock bag (but a canister would be even better) to scoop out what I want, when I want it. Just a little tip there.

review/text: I work in a hospital setting and have shared my love for this product with my co-workers ... what a find!  Word travels fast when a  product is THIS good with THIS many attributes. I think half the hospital is now ordering this! (the other half haven't heard yet. LOL!)  First, if you love peanut butter, you will love this stuff!  What's not to love?  The fat is almost gone, but the taste ... is ... WOW!!! Add it to a shake. Mix it with, chocolate shakes or vanilla shakes & bananas or ... you name your pleasure. Um um um... and um um um again.  Second, If you simply like peanut butter cups but don't eat them because of the calories, the fat or the sugar ... welcome to a new way of enjoying your candy ... smoothies with PB2 and chocolate.  Try it. Just ... TRY IT! You will not be sorry.

Small price to pay! Tastes even better than regular peanut butter and I can eat it daily, getting the nutrients of peanuts without the fat and extra calories!!<br /><br />A month later, and I'm almost done with the bag. I'll DEFINITELY be purchasing again.

review/summary: Not bad...
review/text: I am a passionate peanut butter lover, but as peanut butter is so high in calories, PB2 appealed to me. I actually haven't tried mixing it with water as per the directions, but I don't think I would enjoy it on its own or on toast, just as it isn't sweet enough (sorry, I need that bit of added sugar!). HOWEVER, I'm big on adding peanut butter to cottage cheese, and 2 tbsp of this PB2 powder to 1/2 cup cottage cheese is lovely! It's also quite nice mixed in with vanilla frozen yogurt (1 tbsp to 1/2 cup). I'd probably purchase again just for those uses alone, saving me 150 calories!

We use it on toast, in smoothies and dip apples right into the straight powder. For someone doing weight watchers, it is an awesome find. Love, love, love.

I take 1C light chocolate soymilk, 1 frozen banana, 1/2 C frozen blueberries and 2T PB2 and put it in a plastic tumbler.  Then I go to town with my stick blender (if you don't have a good one, you don't know what you are missing).

The taste was a little more bland than the regular jar brand to which I am accustomed. I let my Mom taste it and she agreed it's not bad, and she eats a lot more PB than I do.

review/summary: Great Considering the Calories
review/text: This was my first experience with powdered peanut butter (didn't know such a thing existed until I found PB2 while browsing the best sellers in Grocery & Gourmet Food).  I think that while it is not quite the same as normal name brand peanut butter, but when you compare it to Skippy or Planter's brands - the two I had in my house to compare it to - this peanut butter has 75% fewer calories.  There is no way that I would rate this as being 75% less satisfying, so if your goal is to find a substitute for peanut butter that is better in terms of overall calories, this is the way to go.  It might take some experimenting to get it to a consistency you like.  The recommended 2 tbsp powder to 2 tbsp water was a bit thick for me.  Finally, I would highly recommend this to anyone who uses peanut butter as an ingredient, as opposed to just eating something with peanut butter on it.  The powder dissolves much more easily than you can get actual peanut butter to mix into a sauce.  I particularly have enjoyed it in milk shakes.

I took a chance and bought the chocolate PB2 and regular PB2, best to buy both 1-1b bags. LOVE THIS STUFF. Its great in a smoothie, i dont like it by itself. You can mix it with water but i end up wanting to put something else in there to make it taste better. I have used it in cookie recipes for the peanut butter flavor and love it in smoothies. I will be planning to buy more this summer, since I will be having more smoothies.

review/summary: Great for recipes, but not quite for actual peanut butter
review/text: Im not sold on using this as a peanut butter substitute (like for PBJ sandwich or dipping crackers or celery), but it is rock solid for recipes.  I like that I can get full blown peanut butter flavor in recipes (cookies, smoothies, cakes, pie, pancakes, ice cream, etc.) without the 200 calories of actual peanut butter.  The PB2 website has hundreds of recipes to use this with.  I check their site all the time for fun uses of PB2.<br /><br />As for making actual peanut butter (e.g. mixing the powder with water), I did not like it and wont use it for that.

review/summary: More than just a spread
review/text: I don't mind eating regular peanut butter because if I eat peanuts I expect to get the natural oil that comes with it.  I can get organic PB that only has sugar added and the oil is the same.  However, I love this powder! I am supplementing snacks in my diet for protein shakes and I have vanilla protein powder (it can be mixed with a variety of other flavors). But when I drink plain vanilla protein it's kinda bleh, so I add the PB2 chocolate and it's a Vanilla PB Chocolate dessert!!  I think it is great for those who are really strict with their diet and uses protein powder or smoothies and such.

review/summary: Will never have to give up my PBJ Smoothies on HCG Diet!!! Yayz!!!
review/text: I started the HCG diet and realized that I had to give up my beloved PBJ smoothies until I stumbled across this amazing product. When you mix as directed, it's a bit different than traditional peanut butter. It tastes more like the natural pb without sugar, which I prefer anyway. I mix in with a little less water for a more dense texture. When I blended with fresh strawberries, ice, a touch of fat free milk and stevia I found that this made the most delish lowfat/sugar PBJ smoothie ever! The regular version is usually a whopping 600-800 calories! This version with PB2 is merely 120 calories! Can't beat that! Amazon has the best price on the stuff too! THANKS! :-)

review/summary: UPDATE 07/12:  OMG, this is AWESOME!!!! Finally a really good alternative to high fat peanut butter
review/text: Guys: Although this may not have the exact taste of a typical commercial brand peanut butter out of the jar, it is VERY CLOSE.  THIS IS THE ONE THAT SATISFIES A CRAVING FOR CREAMY PEANUT BUTTER without all the fatty oil.. It has no chemical or weird aftertaste (it's the most peanut-nutty tasting alternative out there which I've tried), and you really can adjust the consistency based on the amount of liquid you add.  Although  I previously favored the "Better-n-Peanut Butter" brand sold here <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KUQG3O">Better N Peanut Butter, Better N Peanut Butter, Orig Lf, 16.00 OZ (Pack of 12)</a>and at Trader Joe's (which needs no mixing or preparation and has a real peanut butter texture), I must admit that the taste of "better n peanut butter" is not nearly as good as PB2 ( "Better n Peanut Butter" is less peanut-y and does have an odd sort of after taste) and it needs to be refrigerated after opening or it gets moldy (trust me.....yuck).<br /><br />Anyway, back to this product:PB2.  It has a very good peanut buttery taste and if you're cooking with it or mixing it in drinks or smoothies (like a banana smoothie), the texture is a non-issue. And having it in these 1 lb packages makes it much more affordable than buying the small jars sold here or directly from PB2's website (where they add $10 shipping).  And if you get at least three bags at Amazon, it qualifies for free shipping (it works out to about $8.70/lb). I also ordered the chocolate which is also good (not a strong chocolatey taste, more like a hint of cocoa), but my favorite is still the plain PB2.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br />Guys: I just tried another product from Byrd Mill and searched under peanut flour product (basically peanut butter with the oils removed as well) that's also very good  (it's cheaper than the PB2 product here if you buy the 5 1lb. option....I ordered -1- 5 lb bag and the total price with shipping was approx. $32.65 (therefore about $6.50/lb). The package comes in about 4 days after you order, but the one negative is that it is not vacuum sealed.  It's in a plastic bag with a twisty tied around it and then placed in a large paper bag with a folding top (the kind of bag that coffee beans come in, but bigger). In order to keep it fresh, I use about 1 lb. at a time and then vacuum seal the rest.  They also sell larger and smaller quantities at slightly steeper discount with little change in shipping. You have an option of getting a dark roast (more peanut-y) or light roast (less peanut-y tasting) and either 28% fat left in (at 6g/serving) or 12% (at 3g fat per serving).  I buy the dark roasted, 12% fat.  It is definitely more peanut-y than PB2 and is smoother and creamier in texture. The only big difference from the PB2 product (which I prefer, others may not....) is that Byrd Mill does not have any salt and sugar added (it's just pure roasted de-fatted peanut flour) so you'll most definitely want to add a little salt (maybe even a little honey) to the mixture to suit your taste if your using it plain (like on a sandwich, or with crackers or right on a spoon.  So if you find yourself snacking on peanut butter every day to satisfy your peanut butter cravings, go ahead and try this.

You mix it fresh, when you need it and have none of the added sugars, salt and whatever else the manufacturers might add.  Far less fat, too.  It is a wonderful product.

review/summary: Wow!  Glad I ordered the pound bag
review/text: As much as I love all things peanut, the grand goober is taboo while I'm counting calories.  Looking for peanut flavoring or extract, I was shocked to find PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter, a product I'd never imagined.  Based on the glowing reviews,  I opted for the large size, which proved to be the right choice.  This stuff is FABULOUS.<br /><br />It's a very fine, dry powder with such an intense peanut flavor that very little goes a long way.  A 2-tablespoon (12 gram) serving has only 45 calories and 1.5 grams of fat, but reconstituted with 2 tablespoons of sugar-free grape jam (instead of water), that's enough to coat 2 slices of toast for a sinlessly delicious PB & J.  I've also used it successfully to make no-guilt Chinese cold peanut noodle, peanut sauce for chicken, and substituted PB2 everywhere I'd used peanut butter or peanuts in the past.  Low calorie, low fat, scrumptious and versatile -- what a concept.

review/text: I purchased PB2 after finding a recipe for a Butterfinger Smoothie.  I had heard about the smoothie from a friend who is a personal trainer.  I made the recipe immediately when I received the PB2 powder.  It was wonderful!  It really tasted like a Butterfinger.  For anyone trying to increase her protein intake and avoid adding fat, this is the perfect product.  There are tons of recipes on the web for smoothies using this product.  I also used it mixed with a tiny bit of water as a dip for apples as a much lower fat alternative to apples and peanut butter.  I just placed another order for the PB2 combo pack with original and the chocolate flavor.  My next order will be the 6 or 12 pack.

review/summary: Not Peanut Butter, Peanut Flavored Peanut Butter
review/text: I ordered this at the asking of my wife because she is dieting. I was against it from the start, but I will make my review fair.<br />The product is not peanut butter, if you expect peanut butter than you will be disappointed. It tastes like peanut butter. If I could compare it to something it is like eating a regular Oreo and a reduced fat Oreo. The reduced Oreo tastes like and Oreo, but really just leaves you wanting the real thing. This product is no different. If you mask it will jelly and bread, the off taste becomes less noticeable, but there in lies the problem. You have to add more calories back in to make this product taste better. There by negating the fact that you have cut calories. As I explained to my wife after we both decided this product was not for us. The problem with any peanut butter food is normally everything but the peanut butter. The fat is the healthiest part. You wouldn't eat omega free fish because it's lower in fat, why would you do the same to peanut butter?<br />The only way I could recommend this is if you are doing a starvation sort of diet (i.e. you eating this with celery and water). If you are doing a healthy diet don't cut out the peanut butter of your PB&J, cut out the jelly first and then the grain. I eat again "regular" non-hydrogenated peanut butter will celery, now there is a healthy food.<br /><br />Pros<br />+lower calorie<br />+great price here on amazon<br />+does taste similar to peanut butter<br /><br />Cons<br />-less nutritional value<br />-doesn't taste like real peanut butter<br /><br />I will give it four stars if you are doing a starvation sort of diet, which I don't recommend, but it does taste alright for a lot less calories. For everyone else I give it one star as you should not be eating products like this and the product itself is not that good. Overall 2 stars, weighted towards everyone else.

Although I like the mixture of the two, PB2 is good enough and low cal enough on its own that I would recommend it to any peanut butter lover that wants to watch their caloric intake (like me!). I will definitely be purchasing it again.

I mixed each with water and it tasted amazing.  I added a half a pack of Equal to the 2 tablespoons of peanut butter and it was even better.<br /><br />I had given up peanut butter because it was just too many Weight Watchers points and now I can have it again.  This is just about perfect and I was a total skeptic.<br /><br />Another surprise was that it wasn't as costly as I thought.  My $8 jar of Jif has 35 servings and this $10 bag of PB2 has 37 servings. For a mere 20% increase, I'm thrilled to buy this.

review/summary: Feeding my sweet-tooth AND shrinking my waistline!
review/text: I'm not worried about my fat intake at all, but I love peanut butter and would easily eat 400 peanut butter calories daily. I'll eat a spoonful by itself, put a couple in a smoothie... With the same amount of PB2, I'm eating 90 calories. That means I can dip apple slices & dark chocolate, eat spoonfuls, and still put some powder in my smoothie without gaining 2 pounds a month.<br /><br />I bought one bag of chocolate and one of regular and mixed them together (thinking if it was nasty, the chocolate would help it taste better). It actually tastes really good! I tried them separately and they were both good, but I prefer them mixed. My boyfriend says he can't tell that it's not regular peanut butter (I can tell) and that he prefers the powder to real peanut butter in shakes and smoothies. (I make fake ice-cream all the time by blending ice, almond milk, banana, and pb2).<br /><br />Honestly, the powder doesn't taste the same. However, it is close enough to make me keep eating it instead of the real peanut butter in the cupboard. I like that I can make it as creamy or as thick as I want.<br /><br />I took a chance buying the larger bags because it's cheaper by weight, and I am not at all disappointed. PB2 is well worth the money and I will be buying it regularly.

review/text: This product is a dream come true and I haven't even used it in recipes yet.  I love mixing up a small bowl to go, and eating it with sliced apples as a snack.  It's great on rice cakes with sliced bananas too.  The texture (without all the peanut fat) is obviously not as heavy/oily as peanut butter, so picky kids used to regular peanut butter might not like it.  I find it very satisfying and remnicent enough of peanut butter that it's a treat without the thought of packing on calories and fat as with regular peanut butter.  I also love it in smoothies, which usually require a ton of peanut butter to even perceive the taste of peanut, but not with this... A few teaspoons and a frozen banana with almond milk and you've got a smoothie to die for without the guilt.  I'm definately reordering this product.  I liked the PB2 Chocolate as well, but it's not as versatile as the PB2.  I only tend to use the chocolate one in smoothies, whereas the plain PB2 can be used and just add a little cocoa when you want it.  I also love how easy this stuff is to take when traveling...  Again, LOVE this product.

review/summary: Yum! And less fat and calories!
review/text: Love it!<br />Is it the same as good ole fashioned peanut butter? Ok, probably not. But it's VERY CLOSE! If you can handle all the fat and calories from the real stuff, go ahead and stick with it. However, if you LOVE peanut butter, but find you are needing to cut back, PB2 is the way to go!<br />It's a little pricey. I think there are places to get it cheaper, but I went with Amazon since I was ordering other items and getting free shipping.<br />Mixing it with water and reconstituting it works fine, although a little grainy. And many have already commented that it doesn't amount to much, making it hard to SLATHER on stuff. Since I'm not making peanut butter sandwiches with this stuff, it's not a big deal to me.<br />It's not as sweet as many PB's, it's definitely more like a natural peanut butter in flavor. Personally, I love it for mixing it into my greek yogurt. YUM! A little extra protein and it tastes like a creamy peanut butter mousse. I love it!<br />I haven't tried mixing it in oatmeal yet, but that's next! I started mixing the regular stuff into my oatmeal every morning last summer, but realized I was taking in too many calories and fat along with my regular diet. Soooo, ready to try this option!<br />Great for smoothies or protein shakes too!

review/summary: Does so much more than regular PB.
review/text: I first bought PB2 after reading it online, and paid 10 bucks for the 6.5 oz jar at a specialty food store.  I was hesitant, having had less than stellar luck with low-calorie peanut butter products (Walden farms, better n' peanut butter, etc).  I also am adverse to products whose ingredients I don't recognize.  But this one really, really delivers.  It has the same taste as regular peanut butter with a slightly fluffier texture. Ingredients: Roasted peanuts, sugar, and salt.  That's it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />GREAT taste<br />Very low-calorie<br />16-oz package is a waaaaay better deal than elsewhere<br />Much more versatile than regular creamy PB<br /><br />Cons:<br />Needs to be mixed with water, which means another bowl to wash<br />Can't eat it out of a jar with a spoon (which, if you're dieting, might also be a pro!) :]<br /><br />Ways I use it:<br />Sandwiches (of course)<br />In cookies, cakes, brownies, and other places where the consistency of PB is tricky<br />With my whey protein shakes in the morning (chocolate whey powder or cocoa powder, PB2, almond or regular milk, ice, makes a reeses cup milkshake!)<br /><br />I shop on amazon almost daily and never review products, but I really, really love this one.  Very highly recommended.

review/summary: Amazing product!
review/text: I bought a small container of this product (PB2) to try it.  Not only do I love it, but so does my family, including our teens.  Our family follows the Weight Watchers program and this is a wonderful way to have peanut butter without all the points.  Just ordered a one-pound package of both the PB2 and the PB2 with chocolate.  We make smoothies with the PB2 chocolate using frozen bananas, ice, skim milk and PB2 chocolate.  Delicious!!!  Tip for sandwiches - with the PB2 we mix 6 tablespoons of powder with 3 tablespoons of water (3 points).  When using it in the kids sandwiches, I add one teaspoon of regular peanut butter.  Makes 2-3 healthy, tasteful peanut butter sandwiches.

review/text: I bought this for my sister because she has been wanting to try it for so long so I thought it would be the perfect Christmas present.  She loves it.  Says it tastes just like peanut butter (and that was coming from when she just ate it off a spoon and only mixed with water).  I like it also, but I still think all natural peanut butter tastes better, but this is great for smoothies because the "peanut butter" doesn't stick to the blades making a very messy clean up and it gives the perfect amount of peanut taste.  I will definitely repurchase after using it all up.

review/text: This is a good product IF you like sugar and salt in your peanut butter.  I like plain old peanut flavor in my peanut butter, so I have a choice to make:  either the oil from Smuckers or the sugar and salt from PB2.  I'm not sure which I'll choose long term.<br /><br />UPDATE:  PB2 is my first choice all the time now.  Not having the oil is worth the little sweetness that is present in the PB2, and the salt tastes about the same as the salt in the Smuckers Natural.  It's very convenient to mix as needed, and it really is just as good as regular peanut butter.  And one serving is only one Weight Watcher point.  3/15/3012

review/summary: Great on a cut...value not so much
review/text: To get this out of the way: No, this does not taste exactly like peanut butter. It is close, especially near the end where the roasted peanut taste really comes through, but unless you are strictly buying off-brand surplus peanut butter, this won't fool anyone in a blind taste test. Then again, it has a quarter of the calories of regular while maintaining a (pretty good!) semblance of the taste and texture. Note, however, that this isn't the greatest bang for your buck. While this and the smaller, peanut-butter jar size seem like they would last a while, it tends to go fast as you need to mix two tablespoons of what is a relatively loosely-packed powder with a tablespoon of water. Despite that, it is diet-friendly, a decent amount of protein, and a staple of my cutting diet. Definitely get this if you aren't pauper-poor.

review/text: PB2 is a great idea, and a much healthier option for PB lovers; however, when I want PB, I want PB, and messing with the PB2 is not something done quickly unless you are just making PB2 with water. Excellent mixed with honey, preserves, etc., but it takes more of those things that are not water to make the PB, and is there really a point of mixing PB2 with something other than water if you are looking for the health benefit?<br /><br />As a huge fan of crunchy PB, and having eaten only natural PB for years, I already receive the benefit of not eating hydrogenated oil (we all have to have some fat), so I'm not gaining the same benefits from the PB2 that I would if I were moving from Jiff or Skippy to this almost no-fat product.

review/summary: Great for making regular peanut butter less oily!
review/text: I bought this powdered peanut butter to "fix" the consistency of my favorite natural peanut butter by Sunland. Natural peanut butter tends to be very oily, and I hate anything with an oily or greasy consistency but I am always trying to find ways to increase my intake of healthy fats, which keeps me lean and totally ripped (I am the same size 2 in my 40's as I was in my 20's thanks in part to my PB&J addiction!) Mixing PB2 in with regular peanut butter gives it a perfect drier and firmer consistency that is so much more palatable. My daily peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are absolutely delicious now with no gross oily mouth feel! I love the fact that PB2 is also all natural. Great product!

review/summary: Tastes pretty darn close to real peanut butter ...
review/text: I travel a lot for business and I can never find decent peanut butter anywhere outside of the US. I toyed with the idea of bringing a small jar of peanut butter but it was heavy and there's always the probability of leakage. I was looking around Amazon one day and saw this. It got really good reviews so I tried it.  My fellow reviewers were absolutely right ... for dehydrated peanut butter, this tasted almost like the real thing. Now I'm not comparing it to Skippy of Jiffy because those peanut butters have a lot of salt and sugar in them. I buy the all natural peanut butter (no sugar or salt added) and when hydrated, this PB2 was almost as tasty as the hydrated all-natural version.<br /><br />It has instructions for the water to power ratio but I like to just mix to my preference. If I feel like a little creamier / smoother, then I add more water and vice versa. Obviously, it's more pricey than the peanut butter you would find at Costco or the supermarket but in addition to being light in weight, it's also 85% less fat than regular peanut butter.  I'm planning on packing several ziplocs of this yummy powder with my on my trips so I can have it on my bread for breakfast. The hotels always have jams and jellies but they never offer peanut butter. Now, I'm packing my own and loving it.

review/summary: Great tasting low fat peanut butter
review/text: PB2 is a staple in my kitchen. I also keep a container at work to make quick and easy snacks. It's a powdered peanut butter - peanuts with most of the fat removed, plus small amounts of sugar and salt for flavor. The amount of sugar per 2 tablespoon serving is only 1 gram (equivalent to 1/4 of a teaspoon). I'm a dietitian and recommend this to my patients who need to follow low fat diets but don't want to give up peanut butter. My favorite way to eat this is with apple slices, although I've had patients tell me they like to dip their fresh fruit directly into the powder. Amazon seems to have the best prices for this item.

review/summary: Cannot Live Without My PB2!
review/text: I use PB2 twice a day, sometimes more. I follow the Weight Watchers 2012 plan and this stuff is VERY 'point' friendly. Not to mention it tastes wonderful! Who would have thought? Needless to say, I mix it up in vanilla yogurt and add berries or I mix it up in chocolate pudding and add bananas.  I make smoothies with this stuff, and I will also mix it with water to make a creamy peanut butter for a nice peanut butter sandwich! The 1 lb bag is the way to go, especially if you love peanut butter! I have turned SO many people on to this stuff where I work that it's kind of a running joke now. Everyone loves PB2 and most importantly, can't believe HOW GOOD it tastes! Another bonus: 5 grams of protein in just two tablespoons! Awesome!

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: I absolutely love peanut butter but it's such a high calorie food that I really have to limit my consumption. My typical morning begins with a bowl of oatmeal which I like to mix about 150 calories worth of peanut butter into. I recently discovered this product and decided to give it a shot in hopes that I could shave a few calories off of my oatmeal and this product didn't disappoint! I admit it lacks the creaminess you get from real peanut butter but all the flavor is there at a fraction of the calories and fat! My morning oatmeal which used to be approx. 370 calories is now down to around 240 thanks to PB2! I haven't tried using it in anything else just yet but this one change in my diet has made the product worth it to me!

review/summary: We're hooked!
review/text: My son and I have been ordering this stuff for months now, a bag a week. My son is a vegan endurance athlete and needs a lot of protein to fuel his workouts. He adds PB2 to almost every meal. His favorite is oatmeal with PB2 and bananas. Yum! It tastes great and is reasonably priced on Amazon. Since we have Amazon Prime, it's a breeze to just click a couple buttons and sit back to wait for our PB2 delivery in two days. Definitely a product we'll be ordering MUCH more of.

review/summary: Low in fat but it was good fat
review/text: PB2 is low in fat and calories (2 tablespoons of PB powder = 45 calories, 1.5 grams of fat).<br /><br />It's fabulous in my banana & PB smoothie (banana, milk, honey, PB2).  It tastes soooooo good, and because it's low in fat and calories, I can have this as a snack without feeling too bad.  I also mix this with chocolate soy milk for a quick drink.<br /><br />I don't like it as much in a sandwich, but it satiates that craving.  It was a great thing to try, but I probably wouldn't purchase this again only because something about removing healthy fats kinda gives me pause for thought.<br /><br />As a not-so-healthy option, it works great in flavoring buttercream frosting and dusting truffles for extra peanut flavor.  :)

review/summary: Sold!
review/text: This was the best idea ever.  I have a SERIOUS peanut butter addition.  I thought I was just going to have to stop buying it because it was getting so out of hand.  I usually mix regular PB with Greek yogurt (the unflavored kind...it has the lowest amount of sugar) to try to lower the fat/calorie content, but I wont be doing that anymore.  This tastes just as good, if not better.  I also found that if I used yogurt instead of water, that a little bit less PB2 needs to be used.  I typically mix a little water in there, too.  For a treat, I would also put just a lil' bit of PB2 in with some Greek yogurt and maybe a bit of SF jelly and some cereal!
