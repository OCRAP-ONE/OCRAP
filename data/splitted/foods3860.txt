review/text: I think this is a great pancake mix -- you would never know that it's gluten-free.  I agree that if you mix it as instructed, it's too thick.  I just add extra liquid to get the right consistency.

review/summary: My husband couldn't tell they were gluten free
review/text: I made them as directed, but the batter was too thick.  So I added an extra egg and more buttermilk (buttermilk was my milk of choice) and they were REALLY good.  Like normal pancakes.  My kids loved them!  I think pancakes are a treat food, so we won't be eating these every day, but I'm done trying recipes that call for several kinds of flour only to have mediocre results.  My next favorite pancake is plain old buckwheat (made with buttermilk).<br /><br />I sound like a buttermilk commercial, but everything turns out better in the gluten free world when you add it in.  Doesn'd help if you can't have dairy - if I couldn't do this, I would go with full fat coconut milk and some vinegar or lemon juice.

review/summary: Best Gluten-free mix
review/text: My son is autistic and on a gluten, wheat and casein free diet. Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free pancake mix is the BEST tasting gluten-free mix we've found! He loves the taste, which is a super achievement! Amazon has the best price for Bob's Red Mill products. I have the automatic renewal every month and save 50% on the price compared to buying locally. GREAT product, GREAT price and delivered to our home. Can't ask for more than that!

Chocolate chip cookies, yep;  Surprise Jelly muffins, that too;  Brownies, you bet; crepes, oh my what a hit with the family; yeast rolls and so much more.  I order this on the Subscribe & Save and am glad they offered it.  When I need buns I make my pancakes a little thicker and use them as bread.  My family say they like the Surprise Muffins best then pancakes and they love pancakes any time of day.

review/summary: The only pancake mix we will buy...
review/text: Pancakes preferences are pretty personal.  I agree with the reviewers that say this mix results in a somewhat dense pancake -- and that's why we love it!!!  These pancakes are not rubbery, floofy, sickly-sweet UFOs.  They are tender, creamy, soft, lightly sweetened, solid, and absorb syrup well!  Leftovers are great room-temp as open-face peanut butter sandwiches.

review/summary: Yum
review/text: These are pretty fantastic for from a mix pancakes. If you follow the instructions from the package to make them they're kinda so-so, but if you substitute 1/2 a cup of yogurt and enough liquid to thin the the batter to the proper consistency for the milk that it asks for you get a really fluffy and pleasantly sweet pancake. Without the addition of the acid from the yogurt they taste a little too much like baking soda and don't rise very well.<br />I suspect one could use orange juice to the same effect if you were avoiding dairy/soy/nut liquids.

review/summary: Barely passable
review/text: Add me to the list of folks who doesn't get the good reviews for these pancakes. They are not delicious. They have a strong corn texture (sort of a cornbread pancake), they are extremely crumbly. They are dry. They are neither light nor fluffy and really barely even passable for pancakes. I added fresh blueberries to ours and that was the only saving grace. Really very not good and I won't buy this again.<br /><br />There are so many genuinely great GF mixes these days, I don't know why Bob's Red Mill couldn't do a better job on this mix. 2 stars are just because they are easy and edible. Maybe I could have turned the mix into something good by making a million modifications, but that wouldn't really be a review for the pancakes made as the mix recommends, would it? Though I am glad some people have found a way to make this mix better.

review/summary: Turned them into waffles with success!
review/text: We are just starting on a GF diet for our son, so we wanted to make a 'special breakfast'.  After reading some other reviews of this product, here is what I did:<br /><br />1- mixed the mix in a bowl with 1/4 tsp of Cream of Tartar<br />2- double the milk to 1.5 cups (using skim milk)<br />3- added one tbsp of white vinegar to the milk to sour it (helps give flavor of buttermilk)<br />4- mixed two tbsp of real butter (melted) into the milk<br />5- separated two eggs, put the yolks into the butter/milk mixture<br />6- whipped the egg whites to 2-in stiff peaks<br />7- added the egg/milk/butter mix to the dry (slowly so it combines better)<br />NOTe - at this point i noticed the dough was a lumpy hard ball in the middle of the bowl, so I then added (about-sorry will measure next time) 1/2 cup more skim milk to liquify it a bit.<br />8- folded in the egg whites<br /><br />We use a George Foreman grill with the removal grill plates.  I put on the waffle plates, and cranked it up to high.  once it was warm, I put 1/2 cup of batter on each side of the waffle plate, closed the lid, and five minutes later had nice crispy waffles that both kids (and both parents) loved.  We used syrup as a topper.

review/summary: These make awesome pancakes.
review/text: I have been on a gluten free kick for a while, just because, and I like these pancakes better than any other I have had. If you make these per the instructions ( I use ground up flaxseeds instead of eggs ) they are very dense pancakes, which are still good in their own right but not be for everyone. I add some extra water in addition to the almond milk they suggust and I couldn't ask for a more fluffy delicious pancake. My husband had no idea that they were gluten free until I told him.<br /> I have no purchased this from amazon so I can not comment on the shipping but in my experience they are always great, as for the product, if you are in need of a gluten free pancake mix you should try this out for sure. I plan on making this on auto ship when I run out of my current bag.

review/text: This was the first Gluten Free pancake mix I tried, and was very excited when they came out just like a 'normal' pancake. As a disclaimer, my husband and I were used to eating grist mill style pancake mixes that have a more hearty texture.<br /><br />There is a learning curve to this mix. If you make sure that you don't cook them too fast they will not taste as dense and hard. If you stir them a lot, they don't have as much of the gritty taste. I even mix up a batch and leave half of it in the fridge for the next day and they still come out great (although a little heavier).<br />I've tried others, and they taste too much like Gluten Free for me...these don't.

review/summary: Egg-free waffles with this mix
review/text: I used this mix to make waffles and used 2 TBL. flax seed meal in place of the egg. Added about 1/4 cup extra rice milk. This was pretty good. The flax gives it a little nutty flavor. I prefer savory toppings to sweet, so not sure if this would compliment berries or jam. Fresh maple syrup seems to compliment well. Be warned that this isn't a fluffy waffle though like the traditional waffle that is soft to cut into. This waffle is pretty dense and crispy when done, but I like them that way. I prefer waffles to pancakes so I haven't even used this mix to make pancakes yet.

They are thinner than wheat pancakes, but have a nice texture if you don't try to make them too thick, which tend to get dense.

Bob's Red Mill is probably legally gluten-free--20 ppm, or close to it--but it makes enough people sick that you have to wonder.<br /><br />If you are still getting sick and you are eating this, or you are feeding this to a gluten-free kid who is still getting sick, either you and a substantial portion of celiacs on various websites are ultra-sensitive to the small amounts of gluten in this, or it's not actually gluten-free.

Some of my pizza had thick sections that tasted spongy and thinner ones that were crispy.<br /><br />Follow the directions. Some of the negative reviewers clearly did not.  Saw that someone tried to use a pizza stone when the directions say to use an oiled pizza pan.

review/summary: Lemonhead lovers, this is for you!
review/text: I wasn't really sure of this tea, Lemon Matcha. I ordered it for my wife in the hopes that it would be her gateway matcha drug, but she really doesn't like matcha, so it will likely be a bust (though she'll be a good sport and try it anyway). But I'm only a citrus fan to a point, that point usually being grapefruit. Mmm, grapefruit.<br /><br />When I first started mixing it, it smelled like a mix between Lemonheads and lemon cleaner. But the sip is pure lemonhead. It tingles down my tongue! It's tasty in its own way, and if you're into Lemonheads and the like, I would definitely recommend this to you. My wife has a coworker who loves lemon, so this matcha might be hers after another cup or two. It has a lemony bite that someone who enjoys lemons and sour candy might love. It's more of a mild vegetal flavor than a stronger matcha, which my wife appreciates in a matcha. The lemony bite can be cut with a touch of sugar, so while I can see that this matcha would be right up the alley of a lemonhead lover, it's just not the tea for me. I am extremely grateful to have tried it, though!

review/summary: G2 huge improvement over old Gatorade
review/text: I was recently exposed to this product on a weekend tactical firearms training session. 95 plus degree temps with no clouds here in the south can cook you. On Saturday I stayed with tried and true plain water. Ten hours in the sun running drills carrying extra weight in both weapons and ammo took it's toll on my 56 year old body. I collapsed into my recliner at home and slept like a baby. Day two, one of the other students offered to share his G2 powder. I was ready for something other than plain water so I took him up on it. Before I could finish the sixteen oz. drink I could feel the energy returning and the pain leaving these old worn out bones. Thinking it might be physiological I tried it again a couple of days later in the middle of yard work, another hot day draining me of energy. Same results. I must admit the last time I tried Gatorade it was in a bottle and I puked. It has been years ago and I could not even see it on the grocery shelves without feeling a bit queasy, but this new stuff? I don't know what is different maybe nothing but it works. Bottom line I highly recommend.

If she knew the answer, she could pick whichever jelly bean she wanted (some colors are less of a "risk" than others), but if they didn't know the answer, they had to spin the spinner and take whatever jelly bean it pointed to. There were a lot of giggles and it was a great way to start the party off. Be sure and get the chocolate frog molds on Amazon. They're really easy to make and the kids loved them.

review/summary: Very gross, as advertised
review/text: I bought this item because I think I tried what must have been the 1st edition and it was fun to guess which flavor you got and laugh as friends made weird faces while eating the gross flavors. I was able to eat most of those 1st edition gross ones, save one or two. This 2nd edition tastes stronger and I couldn't swallow any of the gross flavors. I remember booger and the barf being weird in the 1st edition but not unmanageable; in the 2nd edition after one bite I had to spit them out. I didn't try toothpaste or dog food in the 2nd edition, but the others were all very true to their name.<br /><br />Seeing as this product is supposed to taste gross (well, the trick flavors) and taste like the flavors advertised, that's why I gave it 4 stars - lives up to its name. The other reviews are correct: you can't smell or see a difference - it's only when you bite into it that the true flavor is revealed. I subtracted one star because I wish they were only slightly gross but still edible, but maybe I am just sensitive to rotten eggs and baby wipes.<br /><br />Unfortunately I didn't realize this listing was for a pack of TWENTY FOUR of the small boxes, so I have no idea what to do with all those! Maybe I can pawn some off in a white elephant Christmas gift or give them to small children. Yay for holidays and neglectful parents!

review/summary: The best boy fun!
review/text: My 8 year old got these for Christmas and loved them every second until they were gone. These are jelly belly jellybeans that look identical to each other- good tasting ones and bad tasting ones. You can't tell them apart until you eat them. My son would strategically lay these around the house for his two younger brothers to pick up and eat. He would then watch them to see what kind they got. This was one of his favorite things on Christmas day as he would give them out and then laugh (especially when Grandpa got pencil shavings instead of banana). Great boy fun!

review/text: We bought these thinking we could slip a few in on my dad since he always has jelly beans. We decided to have a competition  with everyone grabbing the same color of jelly bean and popping them in our mouths at the same time. You can try to smell them before you eat them but it won't help you because they all smell the same, they just don't taste the same! When you get a bad one, you know it! We watched Dirty Jobs on how they make these and after seeing that episode, we knew we had to get these. We are so happy we did. Bean Boozled lived up to our expectations! Many of our friends and family will be getting these for Christmas!

review/text: I bought these thinking it would be fun to share with friends.  We had mini competitions with each of us grabbing one jelly bean and seeing who got the yucky one.  You can't tell the difference as to which one is the real flavor and which is the bad flavor until you break through the outside shell.  The yucky flavors are so dead on it's amazing.  I wouldn't recommend these to anyone with a weak stomach.  The barf, rotten egg, and skunk flavors are really nasty.

review/summary: Good, but only for pranks..
review/text: I picked a box of this up in London, as part of a Harry Potter candy package, and they definitely are good-if you take being gross as good. The first time I tried them, I stood over a trash can so I could spit them out if I got a bad one. I mainly tried the berry blue/toothpaste flavor, because the toothpaste one doesn't taste too bad. After a couple, I had lost my daring-ness, and stopped.<br /><br />I took these home, and showed them to my cousin. We had fun figuring out which were the bad ones, so that we could give them to her dad and brother. (if you make a small opening in the jelly bean, you can tell which one it is by the smell-its pretty obvious.)<br /><br />Unfortunately for us, her younger brother figured out they were the bad ones, so he didn't try them, and her dad got lucky, and got a good one that by mistake got into the bad pile...<br /><br />So overall, these are good if you want to trick someone, but aren't that good for eating.. especially since only about 5-7 of the jelly beans are good.

I read many reviews that said it didn't have a taste or the taste was minimal so I bought it. But when I tried it, I found the taste to be a little overpowering.<br /><br />Aside from that, it was very easy to use and it does look pretty. I guess I will have to really flavor up the other ingredients so I can wash out the taste in the wrappers.

I'm a college student and live in a tiny room with no stove or oven, only a microwave and a small fridge. Needless to say I don't cook at home and buy a lot of microwaveable foods for when I can't afford to eat out. When I'm studying or just relaxing in the afternoon and feel like a snack between meals I'll grab one or two of these and enjoy them. I also keep a few in my backpack and car in case I ever feel hunger pangs on the go. I can't attest to how healthy they are but I can say for sure that they satisfy my hunger temporarily. They are a delicious snack and I haven't noticed a bad aftertaste as I have with other products I eat way too often. I'd definitely recommend them.

review/text: I'm usually pretty busy during the day so taking time to eat lunch is a real stretch. since I'm on the Atkins diet this is the perfect substitute for a "sit-down" a serving is four packets- I usually have only two and that keeps me going until dinner. Professional packaging, clean wrapper, excellent product.

review/summary: Good Meat Snack - Recommended
review/text: This review is for the Slim Jim .28oz (Pack of 100) Meat Snacks. Being a Type 2 diabetic, these are great snacks to have on hand since they are very low in carbs. The flavor is just spicy enough to make them interesting, but is certainly not overpowering.<br /><br />The casing is a little tough and it does seam a little more greasy than my favorite meat snack, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GW0UGG">Jack Link's X-Stick, Original, 0.5-Ounce X-Sticks (Pack of 50)</a>, but the smaller size makes Slim Jim good for a "pocket snack".<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Nothing beats a Slim Jim
review/text: I used to buy one of these every day at the store I work at.  They're the perfect snack.  We charge $1.39 for them.  Buy here by the case, have it shipped to your door, and you'll save 67 cents a slim!  I'm considering subscribing to this item as my wife loves them too.  Do yourself a favor and add one of these to your cart.

review/summary: Slim Jims have nothing on X-Sticks
review/text: I selected these Slim Jim sticks to try because the Jack Links X-Sticks Bacon Cheddar flavor I usually buy was out of stock. The Slim Jims have a good flavor, but they are far more greasy, and their casing is tough, like eating wax paper. They are also a bit more "dried out" in consistency. I feel that all the Jack Links sticks I have tried are much better than the Slim Jims. X-Sticks are less dry, far less greasy, and more tender to chew.

review/summary: Great snack for the troops & movie watching
review/text: These taste great, salty and meaty - they hit the spot late at night watching a horror flick or action movie with especially bad acting, but great special effects. Being single sticks in single serve wrapping they also make excellent items to put in your care package to our troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, etc. Slim Jims don't melt, go stale or wilt in the heat or at the bottom of a pack out on a march.<br /><br />Granted these things are so not health food - I mean come on... the whole point of junk food or comfort food is that it tastes great and makes you happy. Period. If you're worried about calories or sodium intake, then you need to be shopping for something all together different like lettuce or carrots. Don't slam the Slim Jim for being what it is - we all KNOW what it is... it's a greasy, fatty, salty stick of meat in a little plastic baggie made to be eaten in 3 bites with a cold mug of beer in the other hand and a bag of Fritos as a side dish.

review/summary: Since I can't think of anything else to write about...
review/text: I guess I'll review this. Bought one at the gas station, and personally, i love it. The inside has a cheesy-like texture, and it tastes quite spicy. Like all red meat, though, it's not good for you, so eat sparingly. I know meat eating is slowly declining, but here where I live, veganism is not seen. So ignore PETA's cries and take a bite out of this.

review/text: If you are a fan of Slim Jim, buying this package is perfect. Each Slim Jim is packed in a small, snack sized plastic wrap and the price is really great for the 100 Slim Jims this package offers. With that said, this is not the most healthy product...think, sodium, preservatives, fat, and the list goes on...If you are okay with the health factor though, this package is great.

review/text: These are nice tasty treats. Very flavorful, a little spicy, and chewy, but overall good. This is a perfect snack when I don't get to eat right away.<br /><br />Only con I have is that a few of them had a bit too much fatty stuff b/t the meats and it kind of oozed out. It was a very weird pocket of fat and flavor in the meat.

review/text: If you like regular Slim Jim's, then you should like the Nacho flavor.  Similar to most of my food reviews, these are great for a low-carb diet.  For low-carbers the only problem is the HEFTY dose of sodium, so drink lotsa water with these.

review/text: They're not quite as tasty as the regular slim jim, but when you want a little more spice these are what you'll need for your Slim Jim fix.<br /><br />Every once in a while you'll get some that have far too tough a skin, and for that a deduction I give them.  I also wish they were lower in carbs.  They can get rid of those carb fillers and up the price if they need.  That tiny bit of carb filler makes a big difference for those of us watching our carbs, and I would love to see those removed, leaving only the carbs used for flavor.  I can only eat a few in a single day because of those darn fillers.  WAH!

review/text: I got a new batch of these tasty sticks and it seems they withered down the skin quite a bit. Even just early this yr, I had to many times spit out the skin because I just couldn't chew it enough to let it go down. I was basically chewing on it enough to get the inner "meat" out of the tough casing. Now, I can barely notice the casing and *everything* goes down much easier. I just had 2 sticks and they were yummy!!

review/text: There is a reason that Slim Jim doesn't ever quite say what it is.  It isn't a beef stick.  It isn't jerky.  It is what it is.  I remember eating them when they first came out and wondering what they were.  Now, tasting them again, I remember the question.  There is some kind of meat in there, but it is treated in a lot of different ways.  A Slim Jim is still as greasy as I remember, as well.  The trick is to enjoy them without eating them to excess.  For what they are, they are convenient, tasty, and can be fun.
