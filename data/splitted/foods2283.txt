review/summary: ZERO RATING
review/text: I purchased this to give as part of our company gift to a coworker who was getting married.  I paid over $80 - $52 for the gift and $30 for overnight shipping.  WHAT A WASTE!!!  The product is certainly not as advertised.  The basket is so tiny, that it may be a decent picnic basket for a toddler.  There were 4-5 tiny products inside.  There was not even a note attached, that is had specified would be.  I was seriously embarrassed to give this is a gift.  It's worth about $10, if that.  I had to run out to the store and purchase a few bottles of wine just to fill the sparse basket so it didn't look so cheap.  WHAT A JOKE THIS WAS!!!  We are a group of dissatisfied cutomers and will NEVER purchase from this company again.

review/summary: I LOVE THIS BASKET!!
review/text: I received this basket as a present for my anniversary and I absolutely loved it! It has everything you need in it for a gourmet dinner and more. It came in a cute basket that's reusable, and had an amazing hand tied bow in top, and when I cooked and ate the food inside it was delicious! The other person who left a review said there was no instruction on how to cook noodles but I honestly thought that was kind of common sense(LOL). Anyways overall this was a great gift and I highly recommend it!!

review/summary: Basketful of dusty disappointments
review/text: The "Art of Appreciation That's Amore! Romantic Dinner For Two - Italian Gourmet Food Gift Basket" was a basketful of bunk.  I have been 100% happy with everything I've ever ordered from Amazon until this debacle:<br /><br />1. They sent the "gift" basket to my address (billing), NOT to my dear mother celebrating her 86th birthday.<br />2. Amazon customer service was fantastic.  When I (erroneously) received the basket, they immediately sent out a replacement basket to my mother at no extra charge.<br />3. Nice, eh?  I got a "free" basket for myself to enjoy.  That was until I opened it up to find - mainly, paper grass stuffing with a few token food items all about travel size (like airplane fare) including a little bottle of balsamic vinegar (with dust on the bottle), some crackers, small packet of cheese that looked like it would be punched full of flavor but in fact was more like goopy cheddar, a slim bottle of olives that also looked rather old, and a few other pint sized sundries, ultimately unmemorable.  All for the price of 50 plus clams.  You could hardly call this a Romantic Dinner for Two; there's some cheesey cheese for you...<br />4. Oh finally, the Amazon link didn't give you the opportunity to write a gift card, or put a note in the basket, so that when my mom received the gift it had a generic card and she had no idea who it was from and what it was for (until I called).<br /><br />I put this on Art of Appreciation, not Amazon (who did their part to rectify the situation).<br /><br />Don't bother.

review/summary: Best gluten free pasta on the market
review/text: After being diagnosed with celiac I tried at least a dozen brands of gluten free pasta before finding Jovial.  Some were terrible and some were tolerable, but none were acceptable to my 5 year old until I tried Jovial.  This is hands down by far the best gluten free pasta available on the market.  It looks and tastes just like regular pasta.  Anyone would be hard pressed to know this was gluten free pasta.  Here in the NJ/NY metropolitan area we expect a lot from our pasta and Jovial would stand up with the best of them.  Even my mother, who is undoubtedly the most finnicky eater I know, was fine eating this pasta, which is the best endorsement any food product can get.  Don't hesitate to try this GF pasta, you will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Not As Good As I'd Hoped
review/text: Every review I'd read of this pasta was glowing, so we thought we'd try it. I've been gluten free for almost two years, and so far, we've tried Trader Joe's, Tinkyada, Schar, Bionaturae, and Le Veneziane pastas.  We assumed Jovial would quickly become our favorite.  Instead, we found it somewhat disappointing.  The flavor is very nice, but the texture was disappointingly similar to the other brown rice pastas we'd tried.  We were careful to follow the timing recommendations on the box too.  I have several more boxes, so if I make Jovial again with better results, I'll update this review.  Meanwhile, our favorite pasta remains Le Veneziane.

review/summary: Best gluten free pasta we've found
review/text: My teenage daughter and I are on a gluten free diet. We've tried several pastas but all of them had unusual textures. When she tasted this one, she told me it's "almost freaky" how much it tastes like regular wheat pasta. I like the fact that it doesn't have a long list of ingredients I can't pronounce. It's brown rice and nothing more.<br /><br />The only thing we don't like about it is that is the texture the next day. We tried using it for a pasta salad for her lunch and it didn't taste that great. But if you eat it as hot pasta as soon as you make it, it's very good.

It did seem to take a little longer than the box said, but we did cook a double batch in less than double the water.<br />I recommend this product.

review/summary: Best Gluten Free Pasta Ever
review/text: I have tried many gluten-free pastas and they are pretty much horrible. And expensive. My best options pricewise have always been noodles from Chinese grocery stores (like Millet, Black Rice, and Mung). However, it is almost impossible to cook them al dente. In fact, they are not formulated for that. Asian cuisine usually prepares their noodles soft. This stuff is nothing short of amazing. It cooks al dente and if I didn't know any better, I would have sworn it was made from wheat. In fact, it is actually better than any whole-grain wheat pasta I have tried. If you find it on sale, buy a dozen boxes. I found 12 oz. spaghetti for $2.39 the other day at local HF store and am sorry I did not buy more.

It is ridiculously good and I would recommend it to anyone.

review/text: *****<br /><br />Temple of Heaven Gunpowder Green Tea is a premium Numi tea. It is a low-caffeine green tea, is certified organic, and is kosher.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer says it better than I ever could: "Our whole leaf Temple of Heaven - Gunpowder Green Tea is gently steamed within hours of being plucked, then skillfully hand rolled into small tight pearls. This process preserves its delicate flavor and aroma far longer than other green teas. Steeped in hot water, the leaves unfurl, releasing a well-rounded, full-bodied flavor. Rich in fluoride, calcium, and anti-oxidants - and with very little caffeine - this is a perfect choice to greet the evening."<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love green tea, or want a green tea that you can drink in the evening, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi.<br /><br />*****

review/text: I drink a lot of tea, and I can barely find the words to describe how truly wonderful this fragile oolong is. A small amount of leaves yields a pale, yellow-green tea that smells divine. In my clear pot I can see that the leaves are whole, without any of the usual broken bits or twigs. It's beautiful to look at, and the taste!  "Complex" is spot on: along with the greenest, freshest coconut you can imagine, and a hint of subtle florals, there's a lingering nuance that's almost--but not quite--toasty. Like green coconuts seared by flames at a luau on the beach. At midnight. Oh, I am going to savor this...

review/summary: Eureka!
review/text: We've always wondered why the Kettle Corn we got at fairs and festivals tasted so much better than what we tried to do at home. We finally learned that Mushroom popcorn makes for a much fluffier, fuller and superior bag of Kettle Corn! Determined to surprise my fiance for the holidays, I started a quest for Mushroom popcorn kernals and finally found JustPoppin. Eureka! I quickly ordered 2 lbs, along with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0058IBRK6">Stainless Steel Induction Stovetop Popcorn Popper</a> and we've been poppin' up a storm ever since! It took some practice (watch their videos) -- but we quickly mastered homemade Kettle Corn and now laugh every time we pass the grocery store brands. There's simply no comparison. JustPoppin's customer service and support is terrific, too. We've been ordering from them for over a year now and enjoy trying all their new varieties, flavorings and popping techniques!

He did mention the hulls and said "So long as you chew it and NOT try to inhale it, it would be good" and good it was. I only stove top so it was great to see the corn pop up so big, just a handful and it filled up a 24qt bowl (Cause you can't eat good popcorn in a small bowl). Lightly seasoned to taste with salted butter and seasoning salt, Perfect! So I only wrote cause of the knuckleheads that bad mouthed something that I thoroughly enjoyed. Buy a small sample and see for yourself and don't let others keep you from the good stuff...

review/text: I bought a 3lb bag and had it sent to my parents.  They raved that it came out great so I bought a 5lb bag myself.  I have tried it once so far.  I popped 1/4 cup with 1 1/2 tbs of butter flavored canola oil in the 6 qt Lindy's popper.  I followed the instructions that states that you should only toss in a few kernels at the beginning while the oil heats up.  When those three pop, dump in the rest since the oil will be at optimum temperature.  I did so and started to crank away.  All the kernels popped in about 10 seconds since it was a small batch.  Came out fine, but a little chewier than expected because since the kernels were fuller than regular butterfly popcorn.  It did get a little crispier when more steam was allowed to escape.  Flavor was fine with a light bit of popcorn salt.

review/text: This stuff tastes great -- almost as good as the sugar stuff, but without the calories. I usually take 3 key limes, two tablespoons of coconut syrup, and pour a sprite zero on top for a coconut limeade.<br /><br />FYI I have seen this stuff at World Market.

review/text: I use this to make healthy curry sauces.  Sometimes I will just add a dash to my brown rice and it brings a new life to it.  Love it!  and it lastes a long time since it only takes a little bit to change the flavor of chicken or rice.

review/summary: Here's the low down
review/text: This is a sugar free syrup made with Splenda. As a self diagnosed SUGARAHOLIC I will be the first to say that I HATE sugar substitutes.  However, when I started my low carb diet I needed to search high and low for something that would suffice.  What I make is called an Italian Soda.  I take club soda, put a few tablespoons of cream in it, and a tablespoon or two of this syrup and I have a low carb coconut cream soda that is DELICOUS!  I have tried it with other sugar free flavors but for some reason the coconut is the absolute best, and YES you can taste the coconut...absolutely.  However, when I put it in coffee - not so good.  So it really depends on what you are putting it in.  For some reason, the club soda and cream compliment the syrup and it doesn't taste sugar free.  But coffee and this syrup - I'll pass.<br /><br />I use this syrup often and go through bottles pretty quickly.  I get it for 6.99 at Cost Plus World Market but am considering ordering it online because I've been driving a half hour to get it and need this stuff often.

review/text: I enjoy the sugar-free coconut syrup and am unable to find it in my area.  However, once ordered, I was unhappy with my purchase from Amazon.  It cost me ~30% more than if I had purchased it from Lollicup...and when it was delivered, it was actually delivered in a Lollicup box!  Though I have appreciated ordering books from this, this Torani experience will make me think twice about ordering food items directly from Amazon.com.

review/text: I didn't think that anything could be done wrong in delivering the World's Best Candy, but this supplier seems to have found a way.<br /><br />I ordered the item on October 13th, and it was something like 17 days before it got to my US address. And most of that time was not in the mail, but the time that it took before they put the candy *in* the mail.<br /><br />Yankee Traders is the name of the supplier. So, if you buy this package (only available from this seller), don't expect to get it by mail any time soon.

review/summary: Great Product at a Super Price
review/text: From espresso to latte, I love coffee.  I usually use a small amount of sweetener along with powdered creamer as I find milk or cream leaves an aftertaste.  But always I want to taste the coffee, even when a flavor is added.  When traveling or visiting friends, I can't always get coffee how I like it (rarely do I find the coffee is too strong for me).  I keep a container with me that combines one part Capp mix with three parts creamer.  It kicks up the coffee flavor, adds a touch of delicious sweetness, and provides the "cream" in my coffee so I don't have to use skim milk or whatever else I encounter outside my home.  The pack of two 48-ounce cans lasts a long time.  The price is better than other top brands and I couldn't tell the difference in a blind taste test.  I've purchased this product twice and then signed up for subscribe & save (love that feature).

review/text: I have been enjoying this cappuccino mix for years.  Sam's club used to sell it then they switched to Sam's Choice Brand which doesn't even compare.  So then I had to buy it from the company.  Buying it from Amazon is like getting a can free!!!  I am enjoying the automatic shipments as well with free shipping.<br />The cappuccino mix tastes a little to me like a light chocolate mixed with coffee and a little vanilla.  I love it and everyone I share it with enjoys it as well.

review/text: I usually get the French Vanilla Cappuccino from 7-11 or another convenience store.  It had been $1.10 if you provided your own cup, but even that price went up, and some mornings were too hectic, or the weather was too bad to go out and pick up my morning fix.  I've tried several other brands that you can purchase in the grocery stores, so that I can make my own at home. Nothing was as good as that convenience store cup!  I did an internet search and found several people state that the Victorian Inn French Vanilla would be exactly what I was looking for! They were right!  I have been drinking this for about 2 years now, and Amazon makes the purchasing and delivery too quick and easy NOT to order it.

review/summary: Truly strangely addictive
review/text: I discovered these in a local health food store when I began searching for seaweed products as a way to add some iodine to my diet. The store carried lots of products, but most were processed with nasty canola oil which I try to avoid as I do all the high-PUFA oils. Then I found SeaSnax which use olive oil!<br /><br />I bought some and the rest was history. Now I buy them in bulk from amazon because the price is much better. Yes, they do have a slightly fishy odor and flavor - but I *like* that. You may not like them as much as I do if that bothers you. But for me they are the perfect snack - great taste, a nice crunchy mouth-feel, low in carbs and calories. No matter what your eating goals or eating style - low carb, low cal, low fat, vegan, etc. these snacks can fill the bill, but you *must* like that slightly fishy taste and scent. However in my case I do!<br /><br />I think the onion flavor may be my favorite though I love all the flavors. Like the others, the onion taste is not overly strong, but just gives a nice little hint of additional flavor.

review/text: This item is a gyp and the seller produces false advertising. I received this item today and its horrible.  I paid $30 for this? The tins of tea appear larger in the add. This set will make about 8 cups of tea (for $30). The packaging is not the same and it is NOT a GIFT set.  Basically, I got 4 tiny tins of tea in a plain brown box and I did NOT get the tea strainer as promised. I was supposed to get a nice flat-style green box that looks like a gift box.  This thing looks like it was packaged by UPS or FedEx. The FREE gift wrapping was a piece of red ribbon tied around a cardboard box.  How can I give this as a gift?! How can I CALL this a gift?! I could have gotten a set (locally) that was twice as nice for about $10.00 more (fool me once). When I tried to contact the seller, I got their answering machine eventhough it was during business hours and the mailbox was full so I could not leave a message. Do not do business with these people. Maybe they are fine throughout the rest of the year but when its Christmas and when the going gets tough, they get going....right out the door, close shop, take the phone off the hook, lock the doors, etc.

review/summary: Excellent quality food.  Katja approved!
review/text: My first experience with Tiki Cat was from ordering the variety pack, which is exclusively fish varieties.  My cat, Katja, absolutely loved them (except for the sardine varieties, which she was so-so about).  Tiki Cat was the first and only canned cat food brand that she seemed to really enjoy.  After seeing Katja so enthusiastic about Tiki Cat, I became determined to keep this brand in her rotation, but I was also concerned about feeding her so much fish and some of the Tiki Cat varieties contain carrageenan, an ingredient I'd rather not feed to my cat.  Luckily I quickly discovered that Tiki also makes varieties with chicken.  Knowing that my cat loves tuna, I decided to order Hookena Luau with tuna and chicken.  She went bonkers for it!  And I feel good that she's getting chicken along with her tuna.  The appearance of this food is also truly amazing.  It looks like real home cooked food, chicken shreds and all.<br /><br />The Tiki Cat varieties I now buy include Hookena Luau, Napili Luau (salmon and chicken), and Hawaiian Grill (ahi tuna).  Katja loves them all.  These varieties do not contain carrageenan, which is great because canned cat food without carrageenan is incredibly hard to find.  I use the Hawaiian Grill variety to mix with other healthy brands (i.e. Nature's Variety Instinct canned) to make them more palatable.  I feel very fortunate to have found this brand of cat food.

Capsules were poorly assembled; most were cracked or split, leaving a large portion of product loose in the bottle, as was the case in all 6 bottles. Further inspection revealed brittle, poor-quality capsules which seemed to be assembled in haste (read: off balance and/or incomplete assembly) thus causing splits & breakage. Since "consistency" is the focus for this product, I would NOT recommend this brand.

review/summary: orecciette for everyone!
review/text: The orichiette shape of pasta is hard to find in grocery stores and usually, if you are lucky enough to find it, you will find it pricey.  On the other hand, the shape and size is PERFECT for mixing with meat crumbles and greens.  You stick the fork in orecciette (along with a bit of meat and/or green) instead of laying the pasta on the fork.  It is almost like a small dumpling in that respect.  Orecciette with rapini and hot Italian sausage is to die for!<br /><br />The Anna orecciette is far cheaper than buying semolina flour and making the pasta youself. The value, therefore, is excellent. In fact, for the average person,semolina flour is hard to come by in the United States, even if you are an expert at forming the "little ears".  The Anna orecciette product tastes great, cooks in about 10-11 minutes to a good "al dente" stage, and does not stick together (if you stir occasionally). My only quibble is that it appears somewhat lighter (in color) than other pastas I have in my canisters, so I wonder about the "100% Duram Semolina" claim.  On the other hand, perhaps my other pastas are what should cause me to worry, and they all cook up white, anyway.

review/summary: Light & delicate - but shy on honey
review/text: This Supplier creates a pastry that looks impressive on the table and is light and fresh. It arrives fast, is well packaged and can be placed on the table minutes after receiving it. It is great for holiday times where there are lots of people coming & going (it is a rather large batch of baklava). It is not messy to eat - which for me is a draw back as it indicates less honey/syrup than I like in baklava.<br /><br />Maybe the baklava I was raised on in Chicago (sweet, gooey) was not authentic - but that is what sticks in my memory and this product is different than that. Not bad - just different. Maybe I don't want authentic...

review/summary: Absolutely awful
review/text: This is quite possibly the worst thing I've ever tasted in my entire life.  Even upon first opening the wrapper, I was hit with an unpleasant chemical smell.  Very unappetizing.  I could barely swallow the first (and only) bite I took.  It has a heavy cinnamon overtone, which I think is an attempt to mask the terrible taste of the thing.  It is very hard, dry, and tastes like soap combined with three-week-old brown rice.  If there was a contest to make a food item that tastes the LEAST like carrot cake, this would win, hands down.<br /><br />I am so disappointed because I've tried other products by NuGo that have been really tasty.  I hope I can send this back.

review/summary: Edible, but only just
review/text: I should start by saying that I eat the  Nugo Free Dark Chocolate Trail Mix bar daily, often twice a day.  A mini-meal with good protein that is edible and doesn't have soy is hard to find.  I go through 4 boxes at least of the Dark Chocolate Trail Mix bars a month. Everyone in my family eats them.<br /><br />SO...I ate one of these in the sampler 3-pack I got directly from the company's website (a good way to start).  The Dark Chocolate Crunch ones were OK, but as another reviewer described with these, there's definitely a stale cereal quality to them.  The "carrot" "cake" "flavor", though: teeth-rattlingly sweet, no carrot flavor that I could discern, and definitely a strange taste.  In short, not pleasurable.  I've eaten my share of gross protein bars, raw food bars, and other products, and so my tolerance for things that aren't really the texture or flavor that food should be is pretty high.  And I've certainly eaten worse.  But I've eaten better, and I actively like the Dark Chocolate Trail Mix flavor.  Certainly get a sampler 3-pack from the company directly if you're curious (I think they do free shipping, although the Amazon price is better for the cases).

I purchased these without realizing that they are gluten free, etc.  I can see that that was totally my mistake.  I didnt read the description fully.  That being said, these are quite awful.  The taste alone is not the problem, I think it is the texture that is horrible.  Gave a couple away, but will probably throw most of them away.  The shipping was very timely, and the description listed fully what I was purchasing, so I cant complain too much.  I have never purchased anything else gluten free, but based on this experience, I will stay far away from anything gluten free in the future  :-)  That should teach me to pay more attention to the description!!

However, the non spicy ones don't taste any different than a normal batch of peanuts you can buy anywhere.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this product based on the price and the price of shipping. $8 for a bag and $8 for shipping along with inconsistent seasoning on the peanuts makes this a no go.

review/text: I love Stacy's Pita Chips in the Cinnamon Sugar flavor.  However, they've got quite a bit of fat and more than a few calories in them.<br /><br />Honey Maid cinnamon graham crackers have a comparable amount of calories to Stacy's pita chips, make no mistake, but the fat content is lower.  Also, the price is far better for Honey Maid graham crackers than it is for Stacy's pita chips.<br /><br />In any case, these cinnamon graham crackers are a great substitute for Stacy's pita chips.  The cinnamon crackers are a favorite of mine to grab as a snack with a tall glass of cold skim milk.  They have a satisfying crunch to them when I bite into them, though I could do without the crumbs all over.  They're also great to take on the road for those times I get hungry (those crumbs are easily brushed off of my clothes, after all).<br /><br />I highly recommend these.  If you eat them frequently or you have a family, the pack of 12 is a great buy.

If you're interested in it, give it a Google.<br /><br />To me the Islay whiskeys that I've tried all tend to have a smoky, peaty taste, with a hint of the sea.  But of all of them, Lagavulin is my favorite. If you are a drinker of scotch whiskey I promise you will notice the unique and distinct difference right away.  It's wonderful.  My wife who is NOT a scotch whiskey drinker enjoys Lagavulin 16.<br /><br />Over the last decade or so it's seemed to have gained popularity here in the US, I've noticed a substantial increase in local retail prices which typically range $75-$85 for 750ml.  We've also experienced some supply shortages believe it or not, so the price listed in this ad seems very good.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this whiskey.  Give it a try, you will be glad you did.

review/text: You open the bottle and the smell hits you.  This ain't no frilly Scotch.  This Scotch is going to put hair in places you may not be accustomed to having it.  You take a sip and your voice drops.  You take a second sip and suddenly you have an oversized sword in your left hand.  At this point your wife is confused and the kids are scared, but there's no turning back.  After the third sip the accent comes.  Slowly at first.  An 'aye' here, a 'lad' there.  But slowly takes a back seat after the fourth sip.  Your accent is now full steam, you look out the window and Brian Cox nods in approval.  A kilt falls from the ceiling as you realize you're now naked.  You stand proud, take the fifth sip, and your wife looks at you with hunger in her eyes.  It's a good day to be a Scotch drinker.

review/summary: This is a great drink for diabetics!
review/text: I have been drinking this wonderful stuff for a few years now. Until recently have been able to purchase it at our local AFB Commissary, but they have stopped carrying it. Decided to check Amazon.com and there it was! Sugar-free, decaffeinated and delicious! And what's more, it's on Prime so it comes with free shipping. I like the Mocha flavor the best although the French Vanilla is acceptable. The Mocha is like a great cup of hot chocolate, with a hint of coffee and so creamy smooth. I can have this any time of the day! Only 60 calories per cup! That's 'way under the 100-calorie snack that's popular now. I highly recommend it. And thanks to Amazon.com, I can get it for just about the same price as the Commissary!

review/summary: Good product;high price
review/text: I have used this product for several years, so I obviously like it. Have iused both French Vanilla and Mocha flavors. Primary reason is that I am diabetic and this doesn't upset my diet too much. The only problem with this offer for me is that I made the cardinal sin of a buyer. I saw the price and jumped on ordering it before I checked the size of the container. We have been buying this product at our local Smart & Final for about $9.00 per 26.5 OZ. These were $6.00 each for only 8.5 OZ.

review/summary: Low Calorie, Rich Tasting, and Chocolate!
review/text: Caffe D'Vita Sugar Free Mocha Cappuccino was an unexpected satisfying surprise the first sip I had. My mom who is a diabetic asked to see if I could find this product for her online.  She lives in another state and the store that carried Caffe D'Vita Sugar Free stopped ordering it.  She made some for me when I was home visiting and I could not believe how wonderful it tasted. And it is also caffeine free! A serving has only 35 calories.  It comes in a variety of flavors as well.  What started as 1 person drinking the Mocha has spread to many of her friends and my friends as we introduce a warm cup of Chocolate Mocha to them. It can also be served and prepared cold or iced with a blender.  Great product all the way around.  Enjoy!

review/text: This is...hands down...THE best decaf cappuccino out there.  I'm hooked and so are my friends.  You can buy something similar in the stores, but not for this price.  Great for Christmas gifts.  Love it!
