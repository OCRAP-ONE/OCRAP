review/summary: Full Bodied, Awesome Ceylon Tea
review/text: Dilmah is one of the best tea's i've had in the world.  if you like the richness of a full bodied tea without the bitterness, you can't go wrong.  super smooth and just a pleasant experience.  you can have it with or without milk and it's great both ways.  it does need to be brewed for 3-5 minutes, but it's worth every sip!

review/text: This is an excellent quality tea.  It has a well-balanced taste, and is strong enough for milk.  For tea with no sugar and no milk, try the single origin teas from Dilmah which are more delicate.

review/summary: Good daily drinker, if you like bright black teas
review/text: Good strong flavorful black tea. The leaves are CTC cut, which increases the surface area for steeping, but not necessarily a process that truly "premium" leaves are subjected to. Ceylon tea has a characteristic bright flavor that lends itself feel to a little milk and sugar.

review/summary: Favorite proper tea by far
review/text: I'm a Brit living in the US and so it's tough to find a tea up to the standards you'd get back in he UK, but we discovered Dilmah tea whilst living in Australia and I was delighted to find I could get it via Amazon! This tea has plenty of flavour but is pretty light. It's perfect for those of us who like a "proper" cup of tea i.e. with milk dumped in it, but also it's light enough to drink without milk for you crazy folks who don't know the proper way to drink tea!!<br /><br />Oh, I almost forgot to mention I was very pleased with the pricing on this too.

review/summary: Most Delicious Black Tea
review/text: We first found Dilmah in a clearance shop years ago. They had NO idea what a valuable product this was, so we bought every box they had. The first taste really was a revelation. Never had I had such dark tea without the bitterness and astringency of the cheaper teas you find in the shops these days.<br />We hoarded our Dilmah and only used it for special treats once we found we were down to one box. Then I found it on Amazon and now we can have it all the time. I just bought this three pack so that I could give two of the three boxes to a friend who shared the clearance tea with us.<br />What a relief to be able to buy Dilmah anytime now!<br />If you have never bought it, be sure and get a box and read the little pack insert with the story of the owner and his family and his devotion to tea.

No waiting for them to chew during training. They were exactly what I wanted, and ordered, and were shipped out right away. I had them within a few days of placing the order. I would order from them again.

review/summary: Perfect size snacks for Dog Toy
review/text: Until recently I was purchasing these snacks at my local Pet Supermarket. They no longer carry them so I went to Amazon.com. The reason they are perfect for my two dogs ( a Lab and a Chow mix) is not the size obviously but because I have a dog toy that is one of those toys that you pull out the center and fill the different layers inside with treats. After putting the center piece back in you shake it around and the dog has to learn to push it with his nose or paws to get the treats to lay just right to fall out. Well my Lab learned in one day and just loves this toy. The ONLY treats that I have found that fit are this brand and he loves all the flavors but especially the cheese flavor and the yogurt brand. There are quite a lot in one bag and reasonably priced. Yes, I will buy more!<br />Buddy Bits Rocks!

review/summary: Buddie Bits Review
review/text: My three chihuahuas (4 lbs, 8 lbs, 9.5 lbs) love these little treats.  The treats are small so that they are easy on their little mouths and teeth and they are small enough not to contain way more calories that I want them to have (have to keep them trim and healthy).  They are also lightly crispy rather than hard and crunchy (many chihuahuas have dental problems), so I don't have to worry about gum  or tooth damage or pain.  From the response that I get whenever my chihuahuas just see the package in my hand and the way they dance around until they get their treat, I have no doubts about how much they enjoy these little crispy treats.<br /><br />I first purchased Buddy Bones (a bigger treat but same recipe) from my local Pet Supplies store and broke them into smaller pieces because they were larger treats and my little dogs had some trouble chewing them.  Pet Supplies quit carrying these treats so after checking Petsmart and Petco, I was getting a little discouraged.  Then I had the (its seems to most non dog lovers I'm sure) thought to try on Amazon and here they are. Not only did I find the treats my dogs love, but I found a much smaller version and I do not have to break them up into smaller pieces.  Now when it's treat time, my three little dogs don't look at me with disappointment any more.

review/summary: My Dog Loves These Treats - Far More Than Any She Has Ever Had In Her 12 Years As My Companion
review/text: I received these Best Buddy Bits for my dog about 6 weeks ago - and she absolutely loves them.  At 12 years of age, she is far from training age where I could use these as training treats, but historically, she has loved chicken flavored treats more than any other flavor of treats.  That is why I bought these treats, and she has loved me for it from day one.  She has a habit of prancing on her hind legs over to me when I get out her treats and she hears the bags crinkling.  However, with these treats she runs towards me and starts standing on her hind legs so excited to get these treats.  I have never seen her so excited to get a treat in her 12 years with me.  I think that goes to the quality of the treats, and to her love of her master when I give her these treats. LoL.<br /><br />My dog is a small Rottweiler at about 65 pounds.  However, that is big enough that I have to give her about 20-25 bits each time I give her these treats.  Times three times a day, that is a lot of treats.  I am certainly glad I purchased four bags of these Best Buddy Bits.<br /><br />I will have to tell you that until I received my shipment from Amazon, for some reason, I thought these treats were named Best Buddy BITES.  I do not know how I made such a blunder.  Imagine my embarrassment (in front of my dog since she was the only one around) when I realized that I had been wrong this entire time. Oh well, at least I am certainly straight on the name now!<br /><br />One last item, the Crude Fat (min) level of these treats is 13%, it is a bit more than I usually like to give my dog, but I will overlook it on these treats because she absolutely goes bonkers for these treats.  The things I do for my dog.

Also, great because my hands don't get the smell on them from the other type of treats that are soft and chewy, so I can leave these in my pocket or hand without fear of the smell getting on me....so nice...people that train dogs understand this......  Will do all their tricks and listen perfectly for these treats......was so happy to find them on Amazon, my local pet store carried them for a long time then tried something new. I think they are going back to Best Buddy Bits after talking to the manager, if not I will continue to purchase them through Amazom.com.  THANKS!!!!!

review/summary: Yeah  for Best Buddy Bits
review/text: Our dog Callie loves these treats.  Her Auntie from Connecticut sent her these for her birthday and she loved them so much that after she ran out, we found them at Amazon. (of course)  We bought 2 more bags.  Callie sniffed the box they came in and got all excited.  She has the nose of a lab.  She is a 60 pound dog and these little treats go a long long ways.  They are small in size but get so much reward for the bite.  One bag will lasts for several weeks because you choose how much to give.  You can give 1 or 10.  The bag never seems to finish.  There is a lot of enjoyment out of one of these little bags because you can teach your dog tricks and reward them with like I say 1-10 little bits.  We love them also because they are healthier than other treats.  She loves them because they are good.  That's all that matters.  By the way you can't beat the price.

review/summary: Great Xylitol
review/text: I received this order of Xylitol with all 6 pouches in perfect condition, and already I've used it up!  I love the taste and find that not only is the blood sugar reaction much more gentle than standard cane sugar, but after a month or so of eating it consistently I find it to be far more satisfying in general.<br /><br />A tip for sensitive people, especially those with candida issues (since Xylitol kills yeast): try only a little bit at first and slowly work your way up before cooking with large amouts.<br /><br />A couple interesting things I noticed while cooking with it is: after eating 3 pounds of xylitol a month, there was no weight gain, though the equivalent in cane sugar would have done so, and I've noticed my food keeps for ridiculously long amounts of time (I don't know if this is the xylitol specifically or another ingredient, but it seems to be this sugar).<br /><br />Overall, since this natural sweetener is safe eaten in moderation and in fact beneficial, give it a chance.  Even if it doesn't become your only sugar, xylitol's excellent to have on hand.

review/summary: Emerald Forest is a reliable source for Xylitol
review/text: I have purchased xylitol from Emerald Forest for several years and was pleased to find it on Amazon. My dentist was the first to introduce me to the benefits of xylitol gum to reduce cavities and he also mentioned research indicated that people had fewer ear infections when they used xylitol (bacteria love sugar). Since it tastes just like sugar, I keep it in the coffee corner at work and no one has identified an aftertaste or a difference in the sweetness. (I do let people know that the "sugar" bowl has xylitol and several people have switched at home to xylitol) A couple years ago I communicated concerns with Emerald Forest over importation of xylitol from China but was impressed with the level of care: the company had safeguards in place to assure product purity. I see that their product is now derived from American trees and is just as fine a product and competitively priced, especially if you subscribe to monthly delivery. My husband uses xylitol mints and I note that Amazon is carrying them too. Emerald Forest's Xylitol is a healthy choice at a great price.

review/text: Xylitol is the best sugar substitute right now. The other artificial things like sucralose (etc) taste weird but xylitol has a clean sugar taste. Also, since I have a very cavity prone kid, it is nice to allow him to  have sweetner in his tea and not worry since xylitol also inhibits the growth of bacteria in the mouth.<br /><br />I have used it in baking as well. Works great.<br /><br />Given the cost of filling a cavity, the extra cost of xylitol is worth it.<br /><br />Oh...and one more thing, it can be diluted and used as a nasal wash for people with sinus problems because it inhibits bacteria growth (in the nose as well as the mouth....it may even be good on wounds for all I know).

review/summary: Yes~!
review/text: Well, first of all, if you are already planning on getting a Xylitol sweetener anyway: Emerald Forest is made in the USA from American grown birch trees, unlike most other brands which, of course, come from China. And, as I'm sure you realize, if every american bought only $65 more per year in American products, we would produce literally hundreds of thousands of new jobs (that is not an exaggeration, but rather an estimation, as I cannot recall if the statistic is 200,000 or 300,000).<br /><br />Now, if you aren't sure about getting a Xylitol supplement, allow me to address some of your fears.<br /><br />First, what is Xylitol? It's the sap of Birch trees, gathered much like maple syrup, and dried into a crystal form.<br /><br />What does it taste like: almost exactly like sugar, though you may note a cooling sensation in your mouth. This is where the claims of 'mint flavored' arise from. I, personally, do not taste mint, simply feel the cooling. However, my father is convinced that there is a very mild spearmint taste. Regardless, there is no mint in the product, and it shouldn't create allergies.<br /><br />Why would you use it? Well, aside from being nutritionally superior to sugar, most people use xylitol for one of two reasons: to lower their carbs/calories while still eating/drinking sweets, or to improve their dental health. Xylitol has some mild antiseptic qualities, and has been conclusively shown to help keep teeth and gums cleaner and stronger (it is the main ingredient in all those dental health gums, like Orbit). If you have ever had sugar free gum, you have tasted xylitol- and I bet you couldn't even tell it wasn't sugar!<br /><br />Lastly, what about those upset stomach problems you're seeing in the one star review section? Too much, too soon. My father drinks his coffee with, I kid you not, six tablespoons of sugar. The first day we had Xylitol, he tried to pull that stunt using it. First off, since Xylitol is sweeter than coffee, he had to stop at four tablespoons before it became 'too sweet' (hard to believe he could comprehend such a thing...). But that much Xylitol on a body unused to digesting it gave him massive cramping and diarrhea for about half the day (not very long, and not very painful, just very, very annoying). START SLOWLY. Take no more than a teaspoon a day for the first week, and continue using sugar as you would- mix the two together. Wean yourself off sugar carefully.<br /><br />My father can now handle a few tablespoons in his coffee (which he drinks three-five times a day) with no upset, but he and I have been using it for weeks. Just be sensible, and you'll be fine.<br /><br />Finally, as stated above, this brand is a more trustworthy source for your Xylitol needs than Chinese brands (being sold by American companies, of course), but if you are still unsure, you might not want to spring for the 6-pack just yet. Luckily, you can easily obtain a 1lb bag from the same company, or you can go to your local health grocery and ask the staff if they have Xylitol (maybe also be branded as 'birch sugar'). When you're ready to make the change for real, and drop sugar entirely, you can certainly come back here and buy in bulk. No need to rush.

Granted, I eat very healthy foods and sugar was my big indulgence. This is the only substitute I have found that tastes just like sugar.

Yes, it costs more, but it allows me to enjoy the "sweet" tastes in goodies again.  I bought it first on-line from Emerald Forest, and am very glad to find it here at Amazon.  THANKS!!

review/summary: I have been to the Emerald Forest Plant and its clean and well run
review/text: The two people who gave negative reviews must be owners of competing brands of xylitol. I've been to the Emerald Forest plant in Broomfield, Colorado. Its a very clean, well run place. The owner is a genuine, warm and friendly man, Doug Stauffer. A photo of him sitting on a tiger with a pony tail reminds me of Ben & Jerry's ice cream.<br /><br />The employees care about their product and are excited to show a visitor around. I started using his gum a couple of years ago and haven't had a cavity since! My dentist asked me what I was doing differently (as I used to have cavities all the time) and I said, Chewing Emerald Forest gum!<br /><br />Doug personally inspects the factories where he buys product from and knows that all are quality places that treat their people well.<br /><br />Highly Recommend Emerald Forest!

review/summary: Poor customer service
review/text: I ordered some xylitol and erythritol products from this company and found some of them had a very, very strange, foul smell. Kinda like mothballs. They get some of their products made in China (the erythritol, apparently), so I called the company with my concerns, worried about possible contamination. I waited politely while the receptionist asked the CEO if I could have a refund just for the strange smelling items (even though it is listed on the web site as refundable). She came back and said, yeah, they'd take it back this once, but they would never accept another order from me again. Next she started to chastise me for ordering more than one of the same thing since I'd never ordered from them before. (Note: I only wanted a refund for the unopened bags of the item in question. I did not ask to return anything else in the order.)<br /><br />I explained that I had ordered it before from another company, but she interrupted me to say that I should test one item from each new company before assuming the items are the same. Well, in chemistry class we've learned that pure chemical substances should be the same, and it says as much on their own web site. While I was pointing this out, she hung up on me.<br /><br />I had ordered a wide variety of this companies products - xylitol, erythritol, candies, gums, etc. Some were ok, but the ones that had the bad smell had me worried. I was very surprised when they did not want to stand behind their product guarantee and told me not to order again when I was only returning the items that seemed to be defective. I have learned that some products are made in the US, but when I called I only inquired about the erythritol, which they themselves confirmed was made in China.<br /><br />NOW foods offers the same items that I have ordered and they smell and taste just as sweet as sugar. They are also available here on Amazon.com.<br />Try them instead -- I am sticking with them from now on.<br /><br />---------------------------------<br />-I ordered a wide variety of things, including this item: erythritol, xylitol, gum, candy, etc. It included this item and a lot of other things.<br />-I asked only for money back on items I tried that were suspect as being defective, and then only for the items I had not opened.<br />-I asked the manufacturer if the items were safe to consume, given the very odd odor some of them emitted.  This was as a result of a legitimate concern.<br />-I did not know at the time that only some products came from China -- the customer service rep did not make that distinction when I asked. I was therefore worried about all of them.<br />-My review concerns primarily the customer service problems I had, as well as the concern with the origin of their products I had ordered in general.<br /><br />Personally I think it is odd that when I called to return a small part of a rather large order that the customer service rep did not want to honor the guaranteed refund posted on the web site. She literally chastised me for asking to return the items since I had ordered several of the same thing. How was I to know the substance would smell so badly? She said I should have just ordered one. What difference does it make since I had only opened one? The others were perfectly sealed. She said she would take them back after much ado, and then said they would never accept another order from me. (Like I would anyway after that).<br /><br />This company should not post a guaranteed refund when they don't mean it.

Others who try the items made with the xylitol can't tell the difference.  Emerald Forest Xylitol is US made, not imported from China which is very important to me.  Amazon's subscription price is the best I have found.

It also helps repel bacteria in the mouth. This product has been around in Europe for 100 years and why we don't use it more in the USA is a mystery. I'm diabetic and this product does not raise blood sugar. It's amazing to have something to replace sugar in my coffee!  Ask your dentist about this product.

review/summary: GREAT FOR HUMANS, TOXIC AND DEADLY FOR DOGS!!
review/text: I have been purchasing natural sweeteners from Emerald Forest for years and have never had any issues with customer service.  For a while I had switched to erythritol because it is zero calorie/zero carbs, but after finding that all erythritol is derived from corn, I switched back to xylitol.  Although I hear they may have imported from China in the past, now all Emerald Forest xylitol is made from 100% American hardwood.  Can't beat that!  This sweetener has no funny aftertaste, and is great in a cup of coffee or baked into baked goods.  WARNING: XYLITOL IS EXTREMELY TOXIC TO DOGS, so do not feed anything with even small amounts of xylitol to your dogs.  I am very careful when feeding my young children, not to let them drop any baked goods, etc. on the floor, as it will cause vomiting, seizures, hypoglycemia and liver failure in dogs.

review/summary: Xylitol, is this indeed a sugar substitute?
review/text: Xylitol is a sugar alcohol, which has a different chemical formula.  It has less calories per gram than sugar.  And since this is not sugar, carbohydrates, supposedly, it does not contribute the risk of the cavity. Ants and other insects don't seem to like xylitol.  It's because they are not carbs so they must not know about how to break them into parts so they can make energy out of them. So although I spill a bit while cooking in my kitchen, I don't see ants exploring in the kitchen.  It sounds very promising.<br /><br />However, there are some trade-offs.<br />The price.  Come on, 6 pks for how much? Wait,  [...]bucks for 6 pounds.<br />How much is the granulated sugar by CH at my local costco warehouse? It's about [...] bucks for 10 pounds.  that's roughly about 10 times much.<br /><br />The taste.  Not quite as rich as the original carb.  Well much better than other sugar substitute but, not quite.<br /><br />So, is this a good buy?  You, be the judge. Unless you are really concerned about your weight or diabetic but still care about the taste, I don't recommend this product.

review/text: As a gluten-free chocoholic, I will say that these are the best mass-produced, gluten-free chocolate chocolate chip cookies I have found.  The quality of the chocolate is very good -- a nice, rich, bittersweet flavor.  The rest of the cookie, however, is disappointing.  The cookies are very thick (more than 1/4"), dry, and brittle.  That's rather surprising given their fat content:  a whopping 9g per serving.<br /><br />If you're a baker, you're better off making your own.  But if you're not a baker and you love dark chocolate, these might be right up your alley.

Shame on Amazon. I love Amazon and order from them frequently every month and love their service. But regarding this issue I think THEY ARE WRONG not to voluntarily do the same thing. The government requires manufacturers to list ingredients in the order of largest content first. I had ordered this as part of Amazon's Subscribe and Save program because it sounded like a great product after reading the ingredient list on the site. Wrong. I had to relunctantly cancel it.<br />They taste great. No wonder with sugar as the largest ingredient.

Especially since I rarely bake. I hope amazon keeps these cookies on forever. Yes, it is true they are crumbly but it is easy enough to clean the mess. 170 calories per 2 cookies which is good if you're on a diet. Organic is a plus in my book. I'm using these to keep calories in me cause I ain't on no diet and need to gain weight due to health issues that have caused a major downfall. So, yes please, keep the cookies coming. - Smiles -

They are somewhat tender to begin with, and I don't know how Amazon can package them in a special way to prevent such destruction. We all know how packages are treated by the carriers who deliver them....not delicately, that's for sure.

They also arrived more crumbled than intact, a problem classic in gluten-free baked goods that can be easily corrected by tweaking the recipe.  This is not one of this line's best offerings.

review/text: You do not have to be "Gluten Free" to enjoy these RIDICULOUSLY DELICIOUS cookies! They are Rich, Decadent and Divine. Even my wheat-eating boyfriend can't get enough of them. They are dangerous. A chocolate lover's dream. Just be warned: they're addictive and won't last very long in the cupboard unless you hide them from yourself! Not only the best GF cookies I've ever had, but the best cookies--period.

review/summary: Scrumptious, organic and gluten free!
review/text: I adore dark chocolate and found these cookies to be ultra-satisfying.  Their flavor was superb, as was the texture -- crisp without being hard, and the yummy chocolate chunks...of course, it was nice to at least pretend to be virtuous by purchasing and consuming them ("I'm supporting organic foods!")!  Let's face it, some cookies (and other foods) that purport to be healthier for you than others taste like cardboard.  These aren't like that.  In fact, my only complaint is that it's hard to stop eating them once I've opened a box!  But then, we all know that dark chocolate is a good source of antioxidants, so...

It would be nice, as with most things, if they were a bit less expensive and also didn't have to be bought 'in bulk,' but overall they're very good especially compared to some other 'organic' offerings.

review/text: When these cookies are fresh and not overbaked, they are delicious.  They melt in your mouth, and the chocolate and chocolate chips are very chocolatey.  Recently, a shipment that we ordered was apparently not manufactured correctly.  The cookies were too hard and dry and the amount of chips seemed to be less than normal.  I'm hoping this was just a bad batch.  I hope Pamela's doesn't ruin a great product by inconsistent preparation processes.

review/text: These wheat-free, egg-free treats are tasty. I have bought the espresso ones, but I have to say these are better. It has a lot of chocolate chips its soo yummy, but it isnt sickeningly sweet. Its good to have with a nice cup of coffee.<br /><br />The only thing is I would suggest is they should give 2 cookies instead of 3 by making the cookies a tiny bit thinner. Somehow 2 was a little unsatisfying, and the cookies were like too thick for my taste.

review/text: Chocolate heaven for even the most ardent chocolate lover. Sweetly decadent with a richness and flavor that does not compare to any other cookie, wheat-free, or not. I used to be a O*** cookie lover until I discovered the white sugar, regular salt, wheat and hydrogenated oil was "doing" me in. These cookies made by Pamela top the O*** cookie by miles.I have tried a few others also but always come back for more dark chocolate. Thanks for a new chocolate enjoyment.<br /><br />D<br /><br />PS if chocolate is not your "thing" the ginger cookies are excellent too, with bits of real ginger in each cookie.<br /><br />D

review/summary: Ridiculous Cookies
review/text: These cookies are ridiculous. I don't know what kind of chocolate is in these chunks, but it's got to be the richest, most decadent dark chocolate I've ever tasted. I thought it was just me, so I asked my sister if she'd like a cookie. She said, "Wow! These are SO good!" I didn't realize that they were gluten free until I read the label. I've never had a gluten free anything before. Maybe it's the organic chocolate. These are crispy little cookies that are so delicious that I think I may have addicted not only myself, but my sister too. Like other people with reviews here, I  ordered them to round out an order to qualify for free shipping. This is a "re-order" item now for sure.

review/text: I bought these cookies as a dairy free treat.  The flavor is good, but almost every cookie is in pieces with some reduced to crumbs.  They came in a sturdy box, but they were destroyed somewhere in the process.  I'm still eating them, I'm not crazy, they taste great, but I probably wouldn't buy them again.<br /><br />I found Divvie's cookies at a local store.  They were super-good and not crushed.  They are dairy, egg and nut free.  I would probably try ordering from Divvie's to see how their cookies hold up during shipping.

review/text: Very disappointed in these cookies - I was hoping for a something great and ended up with extremely dry cookies, some were already broke on arrival and others broke by just opening the individual bags. The cookies are small - the image here makes them look a decent/normal size but they really are a bit smaller. Case they are shipped in is great for storage, in fact that was probably the best thing about the purchase. Look elsewhere for Dark Chocolate chunk cookies though...unless you like dark, crumby hard ones.

review/text: Pamela's dark chocolate chocolate chunk cookies are delicious thick crisp cookies that will give you a sugar high.  They are very sweet.  If you are wanting a chocolate cookie that is as sweet as candy, look no further!  This one tastes great!  Amazon has them at a great price to sell too as my local Jimbo's sells them for $3.85 for the 5.29 oz box.  They keep fresh a long time.  I have ordered them several times from Amazon and it has been hit-or-miss for fresh unbroken cookies or something suitably to make a pie crust or so stale they are garbage, but Amazon stands behind the order and either replaces or refunds!  Way to go, Amazon!  Thank you!

review/summary: rich flavored chocolate cookies
review/text: These cookies are rich and creamy with a wholesome taste. They don't have a bitter taste like most dark chocolate does, so if you're looking for a traditional bitter taste this is not it. They aren't as soft as bakery cookies, but not crisp as crackers either-they are a medium softness.There are 9 cookies about 1 3/4" in diameter.<br /><br />The cookies are placed in a plastic container wrapped in a plastic bag within a heavy paper box. I opened a few boxes and looked in the window of the other boxes and none were cracked. I had bought them as Christmas gifts mostly because the current picture shows a red and green box, but I was disappointed that the box was actually orange and pale green. Nevertheless, one of my relatives liked them a lot and so did I.

review/summary: I like them, my 11-year old loves them and my husband dislikes them
review/text: When I got home from work, my cookies were waiting for me at the front door; baking in the sun on a 113�F day, probably for 2 or 3 hours.  Inside each pack, the two cookies melded together and would not separate.  They are about 2 inches in diameter and break/crumble easily.  They can actually be quite messy to eat, so beware giving them to a child or while wearing white.  ;)  They are not soft, moist or chewy at all, but not brittle either.  The center of the cookie has a small pool of dark chocolate that kind of oozes out when you partially bit into it.  The expiration date on the cookie wrappers were about 2 weeks from the date of arrival, so I store them in the freezer to keep longer.<br /><br />My 11-year old son, my husband and I tried them while they were still hot.  My husband (a junk-food-junkie) only ate half a cookie and threw away the rest.  He prefers soft cookies, so these were just too hard and bland to him.  He'd give these 2 stars.  My son, on the other hand, loves them and would give them 5 stars!  In fact, he chooses these over fudge popsicles and other favored deserts, which kind of surprises me.  He prefers the typical American child's diet, like pizza and hamburgers, so I was expecting him to throw his away too.<br /><br />I think the cookies have a rich DARK-chocolate taste (fringing on being too rich) and almost tastes like there is a hint of alcohol in them (like rum or something like that).  I don't know why I taste that, but I do every time.  I'm not a milk drinker; however, I usually need to drink it with these cookies.  It's easy only eating 1 package because they are too rich to want more.  I think these are good cookies, not great, and would personally give them 4 stars.<br /><br />I suspect that the unusual circumstances of waiting in 113�F weather tampered with the cookies texture and perhaps taste too.  I have never tried this brand of cookies before, so keep in mind I don't have any reference to compare these to.

review/text: These are good tasting cookies if you enjoy chocolate. Have a nice gooey chocolate center. They also have nice texture. I ususally enjoy best chewie chocolate chip type cookies, these are harder but not too hard.<br /><br />But that also does lead to their one drawback, they do tend to crumble and with the chocolate in the middle that can get a bit messy. One last positive point though. At least for the 2-count pack of 50, 2 is a great snack size. Enough to feel full but not too much. Recommended.

review/summary: The best cookie for dark chocolate lovers
review/text: These are simply the best dark chocolate cookies I've ever tasted.  This is one product where the hype equals the reality.  Extremely intense dark chocolate flavor with high quality dark chocolate chunks.  Every month I buy Ghirardelli double chocolate cocoa and these cookies to satisfy my chocolate craving and both are so much better than the waxy, overly sweet, bland chocolate you find at a grocery store.  I discovered these when buying Christmas gifts for my mom who switched to gluten free, and I've been hooked ever since.  If you love intense dark chocolate, these are your cookies. Keep them in the fridge in the summer since they are so packed with chocolate that they'll melt otherwise.

review/summary: Delicious and Gluten-Free
review/text: These cookies are delicious and gluten-free. I bought them as a gift for my daughter who has Celiac disease. But I eat them, too, just because of the taste and texture! The sale price was great, and they are wrapped individually for convenience. Great for packing lunches or just a snack on the go!

review/summary: A 2-inch circle of chocolate perfection
review/text: I recently discovered I am gluten and dairy intolerant. Even before that, though, we were already buying these cookies at our local health food store. I have never been a cookie fan (yeah, crazy, right?) but these are perfect - there's no other way to put it. They are amazing either by themselves or dipped in coffee or dark red wine. The only difficulty is trying not to eat a whole box in a sitting, especially when my chocaholic husband is at home. We try to stick to the portion size listed in the box (2 cookies, 170 calories) just right enough to take care of the occasional sweet tooth.

review/summary: Great taste
review/text: These cookies are really good, you wouldn't even know they are gluten free if you didn't read the package. My only complaint is the size is a little small for the money althogh the individual packages are really nice to help with portion control.

review/summary: So unbelievably delicious
review/text: These cookies are a chocolate lover's dream.  They do not taste like packaged cookies at all- and I can't even tell they are gluten free.  I will warn that you will think of these cookies all the time once you try them, so be careful when buying them in large quantities.  I have to hide these from my hubby and dole them out one package at a time every few days/day or so.  The two cookies per package makes these the perfect serving size to share, or not...

review/summary: Deliscious
review/text: I am trying to follow an organic and gluten free diet. I also like to buy from reputable companies. So it is hard to come across products that meet my criteria. But these cookies do it. They also taste deliscious. It is hard to believe that they are not made from wheat. They also taste very fresh.

review/text: I usually don't eat many deserts or try to find gluten-free foods that replicate gluten-full foods, but these cookies are actually delicious. I eat them as a nice supplement to breakfast.

review/summary: wayyyy too good for my waistline!
review/text: These babies are MUCH too good for my own good.  The chocolate chunks are large & made of very good chocolate, and the texture is chewy & firm.  To me, they actually taste just like a really good brownie mix-- as if somebody took unbaked brownie mix & turned it into a cookie.  I told myself I was going to try just one for dessert, & ended up eating the whole frigging box, only very reluctantly giving one to my friend.

review/summary: Yummy but lots of sugar and too crumbly
review/text: If you like sweet and like chocolate, then you should like the taste of these. The main ingredient is sugar, so these are very sweet. They are also very crumbly, and only 9 cookies in each box, so they are expensive (and a box is only 5.29 oz). But because they are so tasty and 89% organic I'm giving them an overall 4 star rating.

review/summary: How can dark chocolate disappoint?
review/text: I was really disappointed with these cookies. I love anything dark chocolate, and the fact that they're organic was a big plus when I was contemplating the purchase.  However, some of the previous reviewers were right - they are over the top sweet (and I've never felt this way about any other cookies, especially dark chocolate ones). I've never tried gluten free cookies before, so maybe that's why they don't taste as good as I expected. Usually chocolate cookies go very fast at our house, but I still have most of the box sitting around.
