review/summary: Finally Found It!
review/text: I am just so glad that I finally found this product.  It is not distributed anywhere in Michigan.  I use to make annual trips to Florida and pack my trunk full while I was there.  One year I even had it shipped and the price was astronomical.  This is the only Puffed Rice product that is the real thing.  Those knock off brands in bags don't hold a candle to the Quaker product.  I will purchase this again and again through Amazon.

review/summary: Quaker Puffed Rice
review/text: I was thrilled to find out that the Quaker company still made Puffed Rice cereal, and also had an online store to purchase from. It was quick and easy to order what I wanted, and made an 85 yr old woman very happy to be able to have her favorite cereal for breakfast again. She has diabetes, a bad heart, and is a fussy eater. Not only is Puffed Rice good for her, but she also loves it and wants it everyday!

review/summary: Real Puffed Rice!
review/text: I have no idea why you can't find Quaker Puffed Rice in the U.S. anymore, or, at least, not anywhere in the U.S. except at Amazon. This is the real stuff, and it looks, feels and tastes just like it always did, which is great! The info on the side of the box says it's made in Canada, and there's an 800 number, in case anyone wants to call Quaker and ask them what they're thinking by removing their product from American markets. Anyhow, you can buy this with confidence-it's the real Quaker Puffed Rice you remember from your childhood. Thank goodness for Amazon-they always have everything!

I hadn't thought about that cereal for years.  It sounded so good that I went on line to Amazon and found ten boxes for $30.00 with free shipping.  It arrived shortly thereafter and I took a few boxes to my daughter-in-law and she was thrilled.  Best of all it still tasted exactly like it did years ago.  Excellent transaction

review/summary: Educational
review/text: I ordered this honey along with many others and have to say it is unique. No other honey comes close to this strangely dark goo. My first thought when I opened the jar that contained this semi-solid honey was that I had been duped and was sent something rotten. It honestly smelled like something you would not willingly eat. But I went ahead and tried it anyway. It tasted like dirt at first and was not sweet at all. After a second or so the flavor changed to a heavy sweet like dark honeys usually taste like.<br />I now realize that when the product description mentions "an earthy peat moss flavor with a bright finish", all it means is that it will taste like dirt with a slight bitterness and then turn sweeter. Unless you like odd flavors or are going to mix this with other products to create a complex flavor, I wouldn't recommend this honey to just drizzle or to eat alone.

review/text: I agree with the first poster---this was complete waste of money. No one in my family could eat it. It was beyond hard and tough, and I have eaten many, many brands of jerky in my lifetime. I simply cannot believe that this product got through quality assurance testing. I wish I had asked for my money back for this because it was totally justified. At any rate, I was lucky that I had tried other Trail's Best products that were excellent beforehand. If I had to judge their other products based on the quality of their ham jerky, I would never have ordered from this company again.

review/text: I'm a big fan to Arrowhead Mills' shredded wheat cereal, but I thought I might try this other kind, just for variety. It's okay, but it's not very substantial. I put a lot in my cereal bowl--including yogurt, chopped fruit, raisins and chocolate chips, and this cereal just seems to disappear in there. Maybe if you just add a little milk and some raisins or so, it might be more impressive. However, I don't think I'd order it again. I'm going back to the shredded wheat. Pricier, but you get what you pay for, I guess.

review/summary: Theo Milk Chocolate
review/text: I was delighted to find Theo chocolate on amazon.com. I can no longer have chocolate with soy in it (which all common brands of chocolate have); Theo is soy-free. I had found Theo chocolate at a store 2 hours from my home but dreaded asking my husband to take me back there (the store doesn't do mail order). Oddly, the Theo website didn't mention that their chocolate is available through Amazon. It's less expensive at Amazon, as well, plus it qualifies for free shipping. The 45% cacao milk chocolate bar comes in a flat, 3-oz bar, similar to a regular Hershey bar. It's scored into 6 horizontal sections. The candy itself has a slightly "waxier" mouth feel than Hershey's but tastes richer. I'm happy with it, and will buy it again when my supply runs out.

Neither of us can resist eating the chocolate plain, despite my intentions to ration it.  It is simply delicious.

But once bag is opened, you have to store in plastic or glass container to keep fresh - so not convenient unless you're using entire bag at once.<br /><br />I've cooked it traditionally, boiling and then cooling - and also the way it suggests on bag, boil quickly and cool longer.  Both work fine.<br /><br />Again, my favorite thing about this pasta is the texture.  When I add a small amount of olive oil it melts in my mouth.  The flavor is bland (which it's supposed to be - it's pasta!) and it goes well with an assortment of cheeses.<br /><br />They're a little more expensive than other brands, but worth it to me for taste.<br /><br />Love to mix it with vegetables.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Best GF pasta
review/text: The best gluten free pasta brand I have ever tried.  The texture is just like "regular" pasta.  Don't overcook!  I cook it for 10 minutes.<br />It tends to get a dry texture when stored in the fridge.  But add some sauce and microwave it and it gets nice and soft again. For cold salads,  if I make a tuna pasta salad, I try to make just enough, because of the dryness factor.

review/text: I love this product. It tastes great and doesn't have any wheat or gluten to which I am allergic to. My husband who doesn't have the allergies notes decreased bloating and thinks it tastes better than regular pasta. I also love the energy saving cooking directions. You boil the water, throw the pasta in, bring it to a boil, then take it off the heat. In 20 minutes, you are done! Fabulous!

review/text: I have tried just about all their products and they are all excellent. You really can't tell the difference from regular pasta. If you're gluten free try Namaste stuff too, the pizza dough (only one I tried so far) is superb. I liked it better when I made the pizza crust thin and then cooked for about 10 min before adding toppings then cooking for the remainder, makes a better texture this way, imo.

review/text: I'm giving Tinkyada Brown Rice Pasta (in all its shapes and sizes) my highest recommendation--it surpasses every other brand I've tried of gluten-free pastas--and being a pasta lover, I have tried many brands. No weird texture/taste with Tinkyada and it cooks up as creamy or al dente as you want with a simple addition/reduction of cooking time. Sauces cling to it exceptionally well. Had a gloppy problem with Japanese yam-based noodles, and the other brands of rice/corn noodles had strange textures and tastes. Tinkyada, I love you for the wonderful pasta dishes I thought were gone forever. Thank you so much!

review/summary: I can't think of a single negative thing to say. . .
review/text: I've had no success with other gluten-free pastas. I tried one that turned the water bright yellow and then tasted like a cross between a corn kernel and styrofoam, and I tried one that tasted just fine as long as what I wanted was a tasty blob on my plate. Yuk.  When I read Bill Henderson's book on healing cancer (I'm a stage III ovarian cancer survivor) and discovered that gluten can work against all the other things I'm doing by possibly feeding my cancer cells, I imagined never having pasta again. When I found other pastas that purported to be tasty and easy to cook, I snapped them up and brought them home to create my fave pasta dishes. Disaster! The aforementioned corn-y yuk-extravaganza and the gelatinous (but, hey, TASTY) glob made me think it was sayonara, pasta. Then, just two weeks ago, I saw this pasta at a local market, and I bought it up thinking that it would also be a disappointment. Imagine my surprise today when I cooked it up and found it not only holds its shape but tastes good and handles sauce beautifully. Wowsa! I'm in pasta love! I cooked mine by boiling it up for approximately 12 minutes, and it didn't glob up, fall apart, or otherwise cause me any grief. I drained it, rinsed it, and then tossed with hot sauce. It kept its shape throughout and did a good job of doing the same as I forked it up. I'm so impressed. I will now order a case of the stuff and have it ready for pasta salads and tosses (tapenade with some extra garlic, anyone?). I love to take pasta and simply toss it with extra virgin olive oil, garlic, fresh basil, and a bit of salt and pepper. Very simple and quite excellent. Also, I'm looking forward to combining this with my fave sauce, which is simply fresh organic tomatoes processed to crushed consistency, olive oil, fresh basil, lots of garlic, and a wee bit of pink salt. So very delicious! Next, I will take this pasta and turn it into pasta salad for a weekend gathering. I shall let you know how it goes. :-)

review/summary: Just like the "real thing"!
review/text: If you can't eat wheat pasta, Tinkyada is the brand to buy.  The white rice pasta I bought at the store was mushy and didn't hold its shape.  It was a pale imitation of the "real thing."  But Tinkyada's pasta I can enjoy eating.  As long as you cook according to the directions, you can't tell it's not "normal" pasta. I usually add a bit of oil to the water with the pasta to discourage sticking, because I don't do a very good job remembering to stir it!  It's also brown rice-based, so it's healthier for you.  One warning, if you put plain pasta in the fridge, it will be hardened when you pull it out.  But, heat it with some sauce, or reheat it in a pan of water on the stove, and it's nice and soft again.<br /><br />I like the penne shape.  It holds its shape well when cooked and doesn't fall apart.  It's great for a casserole to be made ahead of time, as the pasta won't fall apart with reheating and lots of stirring.  This shape is good with a smooth sauce, but I especially like it when there's something chunky mixed with it, such as diced tomato or meat chunks.  Definitely recommend this brand, as well as this particular shape.

review/text: I have Celiac and cannot eat any Gluten or Wheat products. Pasta is a favorite of mine. It took me some time and trying of different pasta products. By far 'Tinkyada Brown Rice Penne' is the best and closest to regular wheat pasta in texture & taste (mostly the texture) Once you put gravy or sauce over it, there is hardly to near none of a taste difference. If you like 'al'dente', only cook for 8 to 8 1/2 minutes after it comes to a boil. The package suggests 15 to 16 minutes. Don't do it. If you don not have a health food store near you to buy this product, you can get it shipped to you from amazon.com.

The flavor or bergamot is high.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about this tea is that the sachet it comes in does not have a string.  It comes in a circular sachet kind of like those coffee pods.  I still drink it everyday and have it on subscribe and save so the string doesn't bother me that much.

review/text: I have had this wonderful treat in Germany but these guys are selling old and stale stuff.  And the shipping was over $20.00<br />I have written to them about it and will update this review if they make good on selling outdated candy.<br /><br />These guys did make goodand ship another order to me but unfortunately they didn't check the product since it too was stale.  Sadly, I feel like I can't change the review.

review/summary: Deliciously smooth goodness in a cup!
review/text: The Southern Pecan Cream is rich, smooth, and without a hint of bitterness. This is my favorite Berres Brothers flavor although Highlander Grogg runs a very close second. It sure beats going to a large retailer for a cup of coffee that alone would be half the price of a fabulous bag of these beans! So buy some, perk a fresh hot pot, and enjoy copious cups of delight for a lot less money.

review/summary: Nice Variety, Tasteful Presentation, Great Idea!
review/text: Got these for my sister for her housewarming... for individuals with small households these are ideal - spices are so expensive and to make most recipes you need a reasonable selection but they go bad so quickly (relative to how much is left) that it can be very discouraging.<br /><br />The presentation is beautiful... my sister couldn't decide whether to put them away or display the tins on the counter!<br /><br />The selection in this collection is fairly wide ranging and useful... she was very excited to get the more fragrant spices that you need to be fresher for them to do their job.<br /><br />This is not really "cheaper" or more economical than buying jars of the included spices... but the difference is that in six months or two years when you need ginger again you won't be forced to choose between old ginger with little flavor left or springing for a new jar... the next packet will be as fragrant and intense as the first packet was.  So while not a lower cost in the short run, in the longer run it's more convenient and flavorful and, ultimately, a reasonable balance between flavor and cost.

review/text: I just found PB2 and PB2 with chocolate and I am thrilled.  I love sugary goodies but I'm not a fan of calories and I don't like chocolate.  I thought I'd try PB2 with chocolate anyway and I'm so glad I did!  Eating a serving or two of PB2 with chocolate satisfies my sweet craving without breaking my calorie bank!  Sometimes, when I want to splurge, I spread some PB2 with chocolate on a graham cracker, spread some marshmallow fluff on another and sandwich them together! YUM!

review/text: I tried someone's recipe with the frozen banana, no dairy milk (eek used dairy!), and pb2. First of all, major froth - I assume because of the actual milk. Second of all, NOT enough PB2! Anyway, long story short, if you use this in recipes, it's awesome and low in calories. I like mixing it with a tiny bit of water and applying to animal crackers.. To the people who say this doesn't taste like peanut butter, I DISAGREE! It tastes exactly like crushed peanuts, the only different thing is the texture.

The jar doesn't last as regular peanut butter.

review/summary: I can eat it with a spoon
review/text: This is fantastic. If it's really 85% less calorie and fat, I will eat it with a spoon with no reservations. Being constantly on some type of diet, it is a real find. It tastes a lot like peanut butter with chocolate mixed together. I used it first with Yonanas mixer and it worked out rather well with bananas and berries (very little berries, or otherwise the taste clashes)I've bought Peanut butter powder too so I can't figure out which one I like better, they are kind of similar, but both yummy. One little critics I have is the packaging. I had trouble opening it, so in the end I had to cut it. Now it sits open and I would rather have it tight closed. Any ideas? (except zip lock bag)? Next time I think I will buy it in a jar. And I will buy it again.

review/summary: Reasonably Delicious
review/text: This is a pretty solid alternative to peanut butter. If the instructions on the label are followed, the peanut butter ends up a little more liquid-y than one might expect, but that is easily remedied by adjusting the amount of water. This works well for sandwiches, and is an awful lot less messy than trying to add proper peanut butter to a smoothie. I've not yet tried using it in baking, but it seems like it would be satisfactory, so long as the amount of water is reduced when making the paste.

review/summary: A tasty alternative.
review/text: I really love peanut butter, but one sandwich worth of peanut butter uses up most of your daily intake of saturated fats generally. This powdered stuff doesnt come close. It is as easy to use as simply stirring with a spoon and comes out just fine by my estimation. There isnt really a noticeable drop off for me personally, but i dont really eat really sugary peanut butter anyway (i would normally buy Justin's or somesuch). The chocolate is just right in this as well. Although i wanted to be able to eat PB&J's without taking up all of my fat intake, i also wanted to have something for my daily smoothies. I play around with variations, but my go to drink is kale, banana, apple, mango, and mint with flaxseed meal. This makes a great addition to that blend.<br />Anyway, i have seen mention of cheaper prices elsewhere, but for me, with Prime membership and a $5.50 price point currently, i feel the price is more than adequate, especially when factoring in no shipping and two day delivery.<br />I recommend trying this product. No transfats, high fructose corn syrup, or any added carp. Just a good, simple product.<br />Enjoy!
