review/summary: Great price on large box!!
review/text: I used to buy Pop Tarts @ Target and they were close to $3 for one box of (3) packages which would equal 6 individual Pop Tarts.  You can't beat the price on Amazon! Wish they offered the low-fat ones.

review/text: Except they were all crushed, not do to Amazon's fault, the box I got was in perfect condition. I guess, they could have been stale, and when they were shipped it damaged them. I believe it to be a manufacturer's problem.

review/summary: Delicious and came on time
review/text: I originally ordered these pop tarts so that I could have them sent directly to my husband who is in the military, deployed and using an FPO address.  I'm not sure what the rule is but the merchant (and many other merchants I've tried) couldn't send the food directly to the FPO address so I had the food sent to my place and then I repackaged it and sent it to my husband.  Looking back I will now just save myself the extra money and just buy it from the store and ship it, but the poptarts arrived from the merchant to my place in a great time, and I kept a pack for myself and they were good.  So, if you need a big pack of pop tarts and don't want to go to the store for them, this is a good method to get them. :)

review/summary: Poor packaging
review/text: I was excited to find a package of 48 Pop Tarts for so cheap, Until they showed up.  When we received the brown box from the UPS man my mouth was watering.  Then I opened the box to find the case of pop tarts just sitting inside the larger box with nothing to keep it from moving around.  I grabbed the box of Tarts and lifted it only to have the bottom of the colorful box open up and 4 boxes of frosted goodness fell onto the table.  Before opening the individual box I was a bit leary.  Yep, not to my surprise the foil wrapper was full of crumbs.  We now eat the pop tarts with a spoon.  Oh well live and learn.

review/summary: POP TARTS
review/text: I was extremely disappointed in the pop tarts I received.  First of all, the package arrived with the wrong zip code. So it had travelled all over the state before I received it.. (The other product I ordered at the same time arrived in a different box and much sooner than the pop tarts, and with the correct zip code. So I know Amazon has my correct zip code.)  The pop tarts were so old that they were all broken up and they tasted extremely stale. I have ordered and received many other products from Amazon which were all excellent, so I know this was an anomaly.

review/summary: My 'Special Treat' for those leisure times
review/text: This coffee is like a fine wine.  It should be enjoyed during leisurely moments when a cup of coffee is an indulgence and never during a gallon pot coffee marathon of day old coffee dregs.  This coffee is appropriately named the 5 Star Hotel Blend because it lives up to the quality of an extra luxurious hotel's offering.  I love all of the Community coffees, but this one is my special favorite. This blend is a medium roast so it is always just right.

review/text: I wouldn't go so far as to say I would rather drink Folger's, but this coffee is definitely a disappointment.  I did get the already ground coffee and as someone indicated, the whole bean may taste fresher.  But, the coffee tastes bland and stale for the most part.  It does remind me of hotel coffee - the stuff they put in your room for the little coffee makers!  It isn't the worst, but it definitely isn't 5-star hotel restaurant quality.  I got a great deal on it and I would say that this is an example of getting what you pay for.

review/text: To say 'this is bad coffee' or 'this is good coffee' is a bit hard, as taste is subjective. There is no universally 'great' coffee. I would say this a mild coffee, not very acidic, medium to light roast with a slight toffee undertone. If that appeals to you, you'll probably like this coffee. If you miss Louisiana and want some familiar products shipped to you, you'll love the coffee as well as the nice price. For what it is, it's fine. If you want a bold cup that is dark and rich, pass. If you like light and drinkable, catch it on sale and give it a try.

Would be willing to try ANY Community coffee -- it being on sale was just the icing on the cake. Life is too short to drink mediocre coffee -- if you drink Community you get the best there is. A true taste of New Orleans.

If you were to walk into an old automotive repair shop and buy a cup from a vending machine it would taste better than this.  If you served this in your store as a courtesy to your "guests" you would lose business. The only use I can see for this product is to spread it in the garden to prevent slug and snail infestation.

review/summary: BIG Disappointment
review/text: After subscribing to one of the premium coffee clubs for years, my husband and I decided it was time for a change. We went online and read all the wonderful reviews for this product. To say we were disappointed is an understatement. We found this coffee close to undrinkable. No robust coffee taste. No aroma. The grind was large and looked like something had been mixed in with the coffee to "stretch" it out. The taste was offensive - sickly sweet. We used the suggested amount which resulted in glorified brown water. Used more next time and it did not brew stronger. Because we had to use so much, one 12-ounce bag lasted 4 days. We are 2 people who drink 2 mugs of coffee a day each, so even the good price didn't pan out. I don't know what standard all the other reviewers use, but when I drink coffee, I expect it to taste like coffee, not bark.

review/text: I've been suffering with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (a.k.a. Myalgic Encephalomyalitis, CFIDS, CFS and ME) for 21 years and one trigger I've found is sugar. After too much I find myself crashing hard. This is not the case with Agave Nectar. I love this stuff, it lets me enjoy sweets without some of the horrible effects.<br /><br />Agave Nectar has a very low glycemic index. This causes the sugars to be absorbed into the body much slower. I have found that this prevents me from 'crashing' after a sugar rush.<br /><br />Glycemic index is a system that ranks foods by the speeds at which their carbohydrates are converted into glucose in the body.<br /><br />I use this just about everywhere I would use sugar, including my coffee. I also make chocolate bars using it with bittersweet chocolate.

review/text: Madhava Agave Nectar is a low calorie natural (and kosher) sweetener, that can be used by everyone, not just diabetics. It is made from the Agave cactus plant. Tequila is also made from this plant. You need only 1/4 as much Agave as you would sugar. Its very low glycemic load is something every dieter and type II diabetic can love.<br /><br />What I like about Madhava Agave Nectar is that it is processed naturally, without the use of chemicals. We use it in soups, glazes, and for baking. We found the pricing on Amazon very attractive in comparison with local health food stores.

I needed to replace the sugar in my coffee, desserts, etc without having to use artifial sweeteners which are bad and taste awful. M. Agave nectar comes from a plant and it is sweet and yummy. Now nothing replaces the taste of good old white sugar but agave does great. You can googel info on agave in the internet. Great for those with diabetic life styles. It also does not give you a sugar high or low like white sugar does. Its worth using it , I love it and order now by the dozen.

review/summary: Better than Sugar and low GCI
review/text: I LOVE this stuff!<br /><br />It is liquid, so it dissolves easier.  It is low GCI, so it is probably better for everyone, but especially anyone who is subject to sugar crash and diabetes.  (Sometimes people eat a load of sugar, then crash because their body rebels.) It has a nice taste.  It is natural.  (I understand that white sugar is bleached.) In being natural, it does not take away from the healing properties of green tea.  It can be used in baking, although I have not done so.  I have seen a book out there to use for baking.<br /><br />It is certified USDA organic.  This almost 12 oz size is a nice sized bottle -- about 5" of syrup (almost 7" high if you measure to the bottle top) and about 2" diameter.  It is also available in raspberry flavor, which I have at work (yum).<br /><br />I like it better than the taste of sugar.  Sugar tastes much sweeter to me.  This tastes just right and a little goes a long way.  60 calories in a tablespoon but it is low GCI and you don't need much.  Ingredients are: pure organic agave nectar, organic natural flavor, natural color, citric acid.  No long words I cannot pronounce!  There's a good thing!<br /><br />In case you didn't know it, agave nectar comes from cactus.  Guess, what?  It sure is easier to buy it in the bottle than to squeeze it out of the cactus leaf.  I am still picking those sticky things out of my hands!  :-)<br /><br />BTW, the bottle is sturdy plastic, easily transportable, and now has a nice flip open and closed top.<br /><br />Whether you buy the amber, light, or raspberry, they are all good.  Light has the same 60 calories, so don't think you are going to save any by buying light.  You might be healthier by buying agave products though.  Tastes good, too!

review/summary: Makes good wine -- Recipe suggestion
review/text: Fermented Agave nectar is a really refreshing drink with a twist of lime. I usually use a wine yeast when I make some. In Mexico they ferment an Agave drink called Pulque.  The best kind of nectar to use in dark unfiltered, it has the most nutrients.  I find it helps to add a little honey to get the yeast going.  I use about 1/2 gallon of nectar to make a 3 gallon batch.  It takes a long time to ferment like honey.  You can also distill Pulque to make Teqkillya! A good addmixure plant to Agave nectar is Yarrow.  Yarrow contains thujones, the active intoxicant found in Absinthe (derived from Wormwood) but without all the toxic sideffects.  It can be 5% alcohol but with Yarrow added it'll feel more like 8% alcohol.  Cactus prickly pears are also good to mix in Agave nectar fermentations but it's an expensive addition. There's nothing like it on a hot day.  Yeah, I know most of you won't like my review.  Oh well, I'll deal with it.

review/summary: Agave Nectar
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FMZMN8">Madhava Agave Nectar, Amber, 11.75-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a><br />After using Agave (in place of honey and syrup) for over a year, I accidentally found it on Amazon. I now buy it only through Amazon as it saves me 50% over my local grocery market, and it comes directly to my door.  Also, there is no shipping expense, as a case meets the free shipping requirement.<br />Agave Nectar has a pleasant taste similar to, but somewhat milder than, honey.  It has a lower GI than honey and syrups, for anyone wishing or needing to watch their sugar intake, as well.

review/text: I love this stuff!  I have a sensitivity to honey (and it's a little strong tasting anyway).  The agave nectar has the consistency of honey, so it can be substituted 1:1 in recipes.  I use it most in smoothies and on pancakes instead of syrup (the glycemic index is lower), but I'm starting to bake with it a bit.  Still trying to figure out how to substitute it for white sugar, but I'm getting there.  One of my friends and I usually split a case...makes it a lot less expensive than buying a bottle at a time at the health food store.

review/text: I dont care much for the idea of starving to death, so i bought a bunch of cans of this stuff for survival purposes. Buddy of mine eats this stuff all the time and loves every spoonful. He said the menudo sin maiz had alot more fat in it, then the regular stuff. Looking at the label, he was right. During a survival situation, everything you could get your hands on will be lean meat, cats, dogs, birds, fish, rabbits ect ect. You need fat in order live and stay healthy. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CP6IAA">Cornbeef Hash</a> is also another good survival food. If you think bad times are coming, you might want to buy a couple cases, or more. If you think the Government is gonna be there to put food in your belly during a collapse, you might want to think about the situation further. I'm gonna get me some more also and put it up.<br /><br />This stuff smells so bad, people in the area might not even make a connection that your heating up food? Im gonna use it as a soup base to add in other stuff i wouldnt normally eat. You'll eat it if your hungery, and its good for you also. Thats the whole point i guess in a post SHTF type of deal. Buying this reminds me to get some metal soup bowls.

When time to sift, I just pour the litter from the "in use" pan into the empty pan with the sifter.  I lift the sifter, dump the sifted contents into the trash, pour the litter back into the "in use" pan, put the sifter back into the empty pan, and put the "in use" pan on top.  All this in less time than it would take me to scoop!  It is my opinion that the instructions would be better illustrated this way--no potential for clumps stuck to the sifter.  Hope this helps!

review/summary: Great pans for wood pellets!
review/text: I recently made the switch over to wood pellets from clay-based litters.  In doing so, I needed to buy some new litter boxes, and the Van Ness sifting pans seemed to fit the bill.<br /><br />I've been using them for two weeks now and love how easy they are to use.  I don't know how well they would work with clay-based litters - I never really liked the sifting litter boxes I had used when I used to use clay.<br /><br />However, for wood pellets (which are biodegradable, odor absorbing, cheaper, and last longer) it works great.  The sifting slots are big enough to let all of the sawdust fall through, but the solid pellets and solid waste remain on top.  It's also nice that they give you an extra bottom pan to swap out when cleaning.  The boxes themselves easily fit my cats (one is rather large at around 15 lbs.) and they had no problem adjusting to them from the XL Booda Domes we used to use.<br /><br />I purchased 3 of these (one for each cat), and I would definitely recommend them to anyone else using wood pellets for litter.

review/summary: Don't buy for Feline Pine litter
review/text: This would be a great litter box for some litters, especially with the double bottom trays that make cleaning easier.  However, contrary to a previous review, I found this box bad for Feline Pine wood pellet litter.  The slots in the top sifting pan are exactly the same size as the Feline Pine pellets, so pellets block most slots.  In addition, the top sifting pan does not sit sufficiently high above the pan below it.  Both lead to powder piling up very quickly in the top pan, defeating part of the purpose of Feline Pine.<br /><br />If you use Feline Pine (and I recommend that highly) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00176CC20">Feline Pine  Original Cat Litter, 40-Pound Bags</a>, buy the box made specifically for it, sometimes offered on Amazon but, if not, at [...].  It has the right sized holes in the top tray and the proper height difference and thus works terrifically.  It costs a bit more but is completely worth it.

I read the review from the person who puts the litter in the box without the sifter and then dumps it into the box with the sifter to separate the clean litter from the doo.  I tried this and it works better than the instructions that come with the box.  I bought a second one and it takes me about 3 minutes to clean both with only occasional use of a scoop to loosen debris.<br /><br />The elevated sides do not keep my cat from flinging litter everywhere.

review/summary: Works ok for pine litter
review/text: I've only used this for pine litter not clay. It works ok. The best thing about it is that underneath the screen I line the bottom pan with 1/2 a kitchen garbage bag and some newspaper (the newspaper of the free weeklys fits perfectly) The cats can't tear the plastic or paper because it's protected by the sifting part. Clean-up is much easier.  Also the second pan is super convenient and can even be used as a litter box independently of the hood in a pinch. Hood is nice for keeping litter inside when the cats are pawing at the litter to cover up. (It's obvious this thing is not meant to be picked up by the hood - as long as you always pick it up using the pan portion it will not fall apart or dump litter on the floor.)<br /><br />Where it doesn't work great is that only some of the saw dust falls through. (Urine without sawdust will also fall through... but lining the bottom pan makes this less problematic) A lot of it gets stuck in the holes along with the pellets sometimes requiring a lot of tapping. It was taking me a lot longer to clean the litter than my other litter box where I use clay. I was going to give up on pine all together (my cats don't like it as much as the soft clay), but I altered my methods and after scooping the poop, scoop up the areas of "sawdust mountains" and basically sift it so the saw dust falls into the trash and the pellets stay in the scoop. Then I can get by without doing the whole tapping thing/change everything every day. (It's hot and pine does not have great odor control.)<br /><br />Overall I think I can live with this system, despite it's imperfections. Less silica dust which is key for me. Litter box overall is cleaner. Pine pellet tracking is overall easier to deal with than clay tracking. Will get another sifting box for my second cat.  My other cat is BIG and I've seen him use this litter box - it's a little on the small side for him. Still deciding whether to reorder this or experiment with a different sifting box to see if it works better.<br /><br />DEC 2011 EDIT:<br /><br />Since I wrote the review I've tried the x-large Van Ness sifting pan (highly recommend avoiding - doesn't work for feline pine at all) and the boxes specially designed for Feline pine (as well as the Litter Robot).  It's definitely worth buying the litter boxes from feline Pine over this one even though they are more expensive. They do work so much much better than this that I ended up getting a second Feline pine pan despite still having this one. They do lack the convenience of that second solid pan that this one has - so I actually use my no longer used Van Ness pans to put the sifting part of the feline pine pan on while I'm cleaning out the bottom part. So I've downgraded this from four to three stars since while it is marginally acceptable for Feline Pine, it is considerably more bother than just using Feline Pine's.  I have to admit though with a 100% Feline Pine household I had some issues of one of my two cat peeing outside the litter box.  I ended up getting a Litter Robot (which gave me much pause because of the price) which has worked great (However, one must have clumping litter with the litter Robot so it is  not compatible with feline pine pellets). The best thing is that the cats exclusively poop in the litter robot but do use my two feline pine boxes to pee sometimes. Since feline pine works great with pee but not so much with poop this is the best of all worlds and I believe both my cats are happier.  I am definitely happier and spend a lot less time dealing with the litter boxes.  Bottom line: it's worth paying more for the Feline Pine Pan over this one if you use the pellet form of Feline Pine.

review/summary: Great idea, wish it worked ~very messy~
review/text: We bought the large sifting box, the nicest one (with lid). Did not work for our 2 cats.<br /><br />We used extra-clumping litter, as instructed (that's the kind we use anyway), but the clumps of pee get stuck on the sifter.<br /><br />The "hard" waste sifts out just fine. But the pee causes a huge gummy mess. It's too big & gets stuck on the sifter. Then I had to spend several minutes, each time, shaking & scrubbing the sifter pan into the trash bag. And (hate to be overly descriptive here) if your cat ever has diarrhea, the sifter will get ~really~ messy.<br /><br />I then bought a kitchen scrubber to scrape off the residue each time. I'm laughing, in retrospect, as to how much effort I put into this - I really wanted this to work. I can imagine if you only have one (small) cat who only pees small bits at a time, it may work better.<br /><br />Tried feline pine & also crystals. Successfully sifted out the poop, but the urine just goes straight to the bottom, which *never* gets sifted out. It starts smelling quickly, & you have to manually clean the box.<br /><br />Then, the box has fallen apart on me "twice" while trying to move it - the plastic latches pop off easily. Made a huge mess all over the floor.<br /><br />Then one day I decided this was much more work than my old basic litter box. This is a great idea, wish it worked.<br /><br />If anyone knows of a better product or method, please leave a comment. For auto-sifting, so far I've found the liner bags work better than just about anything. I've also tried toilet training, but the smaller cat jumps into the toilet to give himself a bath if the toilet lid is left open (he loves to swim - we can't stop him from jumping in the tub or shower with us. Yeah, I've got some crazy cats. We love them.)

review/summary: Inconvenient
review/text: I've always used the regular "litter tray with the scooper" procedure but when I saw this type, it seemed too good to be true. It was. When you pour the litter on top of the strainer tray, some of the clean litter sifts through and the cats end up with half of the clean litter originally put in. The clumping litter makes solids adhere to the underside of the strainer tray. You have to bang it against something to get the dirty litter off. As you do this, litter sprays around the floor -- no matter how hard you try to be neat, adding an additional "sweeping step" to the whole procedure. Also, the litter you have "strained" weighs in pretty hefty when you're crouched on the floor lifting and sifting the entire tray of litter daily! So, I say, if you just scoop it daily with a regular scoop, you will get the job done in half the time, with half the mess and half the trouble. I'm going back to the old method.

review/summary: Way better than scooping
review/text: I have to tell you how I just cut down on litter box cleaning by 10x. I bought this box.  We'd had one of these before but the problem was two fold. First our cats need a covered box or they make a huge mess. Second the "waste" would clump to the sifter thing which just made it gross. The other day I read on a blog how these are so awesome if you don't follow the directions. You don't use them as the litter box. You use them as a giant scoop. You pick up the litter box, pour all the contents into this. The stuff in the filter you throw out. The litter that goes through you put back in the box. We have three litter boxes. Took me longer to take the lids off than to "scoop" them now. You don't get the stuck yuck either because it isn't drying and clumping to the sifter.  Best investment in a while

review/summary: Best Litter Box For the Feline Pine Litter
review/text: I prefer feline pine litter to sand litter for varies of reasons, one of them being that they do a fantastic job absorbing odors. The pines break apart after being urinated on, so something like a screen that can screen out the sawdust would be ideal. This sifting pan works great. We put a trash bag around the bottom pan, so after all the sawdust are screened out we just throw away the bag. Easy and clean.

review/summary: Makes a dirty job easier
review/text: We bought our first sifting litter box with this design many years ago and always loved the ease of using the sifter, rather than scooping. Clumps could be a problem, but the ease of sifting outweighed the occasional tough wet clump.  (Besides the whole thing should be cleaned periodically anyway)<br /><br />After adopting 2 more cats, we needed more litter boxes.  I tried one of this model and found that the design had been greatly improved.  The size and distance between the slots was modified, allowing for more sifting and fewer clumps. The plastic used for the sifter and trays is slightly more flexible and easier to handle. Sometimes I have to bang the sifter against the inside of our garbage can to dislodge all the clumps, but it generally comes clean quickly.<br /><br />Even our neighbor, who takes care of our cats from time to time, remarked on the ease of cleaning these litter boxes.<br /><br />I like this model so much that I purchased a 2nd one.  The entry says "assorted colors".  Both of mine are purple.  My cats don't care.

review/summary: Big poopy mess
review/text: My husband and I had been using the omega paw rolling litter boxes for three years with few issues.  The only downside is that when rolled, after the plastic has had time to warp, there is some litter that leaks out when rolling the box.  Nothing a dust buster can't suck up in a jiffy.  These pans were a new addition and were a total nightmare.  No scoop needed is a lie.  My cats managed to practically empty the litter out of the pans and the mess that wasn't on the floor was left in the pockets of the sifter that required a separate scoop to clean out.  If you use Tidy Cats for small spaces or something similar, this pan is not for you.  The litter gets stuck in the cracks and you need a toothbrush and a head pin to get it out of the little cracks and crevices.  It seems like a great idea in theory, but for the type of litter we use and our cat's tendency to send litter flying, we would be spending hours scooping, sifting and cleaning.  :o(  We are back to omega paw and our poop drawer will do just fine.  Unfortunately after all this our cat for the first time ever left a pile for us on the litter mat in defiance when we returned to omega paw.  :o(  I guess she liked the mess.

review/summary: Not for wood pellets
review/text: I bought this on the chance that it might work for wood pellets.  The simple answer is 'no'.  The sifting tray sits directly on the bottom of the main box, meaning that wood pellet dust has nowhere to go other than the small amount that would fill the sifting tray mesh.  I'm sure it would work well with normal clumping clay litter, but for wood pellets it gives no advantage.  It does seem well constructed and if I were using clumping litter I would probably give it 5 stars.

review/summary: Great litter box for pine litter
review/text: I bought this litter box to extend the lifetime of the pine pellet litter. This box works wonderfully! The box come with 3 layers, a sifting layer and 2 catch pans. The sifting layer is the perfect size to let the used litter that has turned to 'saw dust' to sift out but not the intact pellets. The 2 catch pans allow me to place the sifting layer down someplace other than my floor when emptying out the used litter. The sides are a great height and angled in to help prevent urine from my male cat from going over the sides. A bag of pine litter now last 3x as long as compared to a standard litter box.  I highly recommend this litter box for those who use either pine or clumping litter.

review/summary: Exactly as it says
review/text: For once a previous "As Seen On TV" product works the way it says it does.  This was by far the easiest cleaning of a litterbox that I've ever done outside of an automatic (and with multiple cats, you have to monitor them pretty closely).  The worst that happens is that you'll have to be careful to keep a fairly deep layer of litter - about six inches - and you MIGHT have to clean/scrape the screen.  But I always maintain a deep layer (less stinky that way, it seems) and I had to scrape the box every day anyway.<br /><br />One way or another, it WORKS.  I'm buying more.<br /><br />UPDATE 5/24/12: I bought two more (one for travel), and have not regretted it. I just wish there was a model with a hood instead of just a high curb, because my tom cat occasionally - to put it delicately - aims "high". Otherwise I like it and I recommend it to plenty other people.

review/summary: My rabbit loves it!
review/text: My pet rabbit basically potty trained himself in a couple of days. I have 6 pans with two gray sifting trays. I place small triangular wedges of wood in the 4 corners of the pan. Then spread out a thin layer of cat litter. Then I place the sifting pan to rest on the wooden wedges. This keeps the sifter surface above the litter by about 1 inch. The rabbit drops his raisins that fall between the grade making it very easy to take the sifter out and hose it down in the yard. I take the spoiled litter pan with its contents and place those into a plastic bag I get from the super market when I go shopping. I tie the bag up with the spent litter and it goes outside to the waste bin. I hose down the litter sifter and pan every other day. The sifter does a great job of protecting the sensitive feet of rabbits. Rabbits are very clean animals and don't like to be near too soiled litter.

review/text: I purchased this litter box for my cat who has far outgrown her kitten box. I like this box because of the high back so that she doesn't kick quite as much litter out of the box as she did before and its working well for that. As for the sifting, I took another reviewer's recommendation to use the 1st tray like normal then pour the litter through the sifter into the 2nd tray. This works very well, no problems with the soggy litter getting stuck in the tray so far. My only difficulty is dumping the sifter, I like to re-use grocery bags for the kitty litter and the tray is a little big for that so its been a tad messy but if you use a larger trash bag it will be fine.

review/summary: Not the best if you have more than one cat
review/text: Urine will glob up the sifting clay litter and stick in the sifting holes.  You have to bang the crap out of it to get it out, literally.  I do have more than one cat and sift the pan daily, more than once if needed.  But in the end it is not worth it.  Go for the Breeze if you want a sifting box with NO SMELL!

review/summary: Could be better, but it works
review/text: This litter box is too small and the walls are not high enough. Even my 1 year old kittens sometimes make a mess around it trying to cover their "business". I didn't know that this litter box has actually 4 separate parts. The top part does make the walls higher, but it comes off easily. I use this litter box with feline pine original and keep the sifting part underneath and use it when I need to separate saw dust from the pellets. Someone recommended this method in one of the reviews and it works for me well.

review/summary: Buy several --my plan
review/text: I bought this but lifting up the litter and pouring it into the empty pan after sifting the waste out, each day was heavy lifting. I bought 7 and used only the sifters from six of them. Then each morning I lift out one sifter and set aside. By the end of the week it is not so heavy to lift. It makes sifting out the waste a snap.<br /><br />Downside: Need more litter to fill up past all the sifters. Messy to store the sifters after lifting out. Need a large mouth reseptacle for dumping the waste.But I use this in an outbuilding. Not recommended for in the house.

review/summary: All in one sifter
review/text: I really like this litter sifter. It gets both end products out and keeps the litter cleaner longer.  The 'splash guard' is a bonus feature.

review/summary: doesn't work
review/text: We are using Pine litter. It doesn't work as expected. It makes a big mess when sifting, also it's hard to sift because the unused bits stuck at the bottom, and the powdery part will not go through.<br /><br />We are going back to our old Booda Dome litter box.

review/summary: Waste of Money!
review/text: If I could give this product 0 stars, I would. The description sounds great but what they forgot to mention is that when the urine clumps up it doesn't go through the spaces. This cat litter box causes triple the mess to clean up. Buyer beware. Don't waste your money!

review/summary: i'm addicted
review/text: I have a document of about 10 pages of health benefits of aloe juice.  Add onto that the essential benefits of coconut juice.  Flavor that with natural sweetning.  I always know when my body is lacking something critical, because foods that contain these elements taste unbelievably good.  I have been addicted to this juice, which is why I need to order from Amazon in bulk.  Finally it is to the point of just tasting great, but I will continue to order as it is still my favorite beverage!

review/summary: These rock!
review/text: Awesome!  These are pretty healthy for a sweet snack and they don't taste "diet" at all!  You get lots more in these bags than most 100 cal snack packs.  I like the fact that they use evaporated cane juice instead of processed white sugar too.  If you're a sweet tooth and need a good healthy crunchy snack you will love these!
