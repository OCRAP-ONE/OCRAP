review/summary: Love This Line of Products(!) But This One Needs A Little Improvement
review/text: Stevia sweetened colas has finally come of age and I love many Zevia flavors but this one has a strange and unappetizing taste after swallowing it.  Now my 5 year old likes it so theres a critic in the house who differs with me some, anyhow.  But seriously it needs more work to get the flavor to something not so odd and unlikable.

review/summary: doesn't taste good
review/text: I've had a few different flavors- this is by far my least favorite.<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars because I can *see* how some people would like it.<br /><br />It just wasn't for me. I thought the flavor was off, it tasted nothing like orange soda. It was also a bit too sweet for me.<br /><br />But please try other flavors! The other ones I've had (black cherry, cream soda, root beer) are really good.

review/summary: Unnatural orange taste and unpleasant to drink
review/text: Ive tried Zevia Root Beer (loved), Cherry (loved) Dr. Zevia (just ok) and now Orange. This flavor has been the worst so far.<br /><br />I cant even finish a full can. Bitter with to me a chemical aftertaste, I'm not sure how people can drink this. It just tastes like a chemical experiment. I guess some of Zevia's product my taste buds can enjoy, some they can not. Definitely will not be buying this flavor again.

review/summary: Worst Orange Soda Ever
review/text: They had this on special at a local market, so I thought I'd give it a try. The black licorice aftertaste was so powerful, it made it impossible to really taste anything else after the first sip. If I wanted to taste black licorice, I would have eaten some.<br /><br />Terrible, terrible soda. Terrible, terrible experience. Threw the other five cans out. What a waste of money and potable water.

review/text: I love Zevia.  Can't say anything bad about a soda with no calories, no caffeine, and no aspartame.  My most recent shipment however, was less than satisfactory.  One case had a can that had ruptured, soaking the inside of the box, and the cardboard had begun to mold as a result.  Yuck.  It was not a particularly hot day when it was delivered, between that and the mold I'm sure the can burst long before it arrived at my door.<br /><br />Another case not only had a ruptured can, but was missing one as well!  One of the four sixpacks had only five cans, and an empty plastic ring where a sixth should have been.<br /><br />Maybe the packagers got thirsty.

review/summary: orange soda!
review/text: When I was a kid, I loved Orange Crush.  Now, I don't drink soda with sugar and diet sodas contain a chemical sweetener of some sort that generally taste like crap.  Not this one!  It contains Stevia which is a plant that is naturally sweet but calorie free, no diabetic impact, etc etc.  It also uses Erythritol for sweetness which is a sugar alcohol.  I like the taste, it doesn't rot my teeth, and it doesn't make me sluggish or fat.  The one downside is the price.  Economies of scale rule the beverage business, and Zevia is a small player.  The product benefits offset the price in my mind and using Amazon Subscribe & Save offsets some of the cost.  That is certainly the cheapest way to get Zevia.

review/summary: Not as Good as Cola or Root Beer Flavors
review/text: This is the first Zevia flavor I got to try.  I didn't really want it but it was all Amazon had in stock and ready to ship for Prime members (more on that later).  I was so eager to try it I popped a can open right when I got it in the house.  My initial thought was that it was gross but I thought I could get used to it by the time I get through the entire case.  My wife tried it at room temperature and she hated it.  She didn't touch anymore orange or the black cherry I got later because of that first taste.  She's since had some nice cold root beer and cola Zevia which she was impressed with.  My nearly three year old son also had a taste test of the orange flavor.  He's not a soda drinker so maybe that had something to do with his reaction.  He drank about an 1/8 of a can which surprisingly all came back up on my kitchen floor about two minutes after he drank it.  He said he didn't like it.  Ha.  Out of the four flavors of Zevia, orange is my least favorite.  I will not be ordering it again due in part to its taste, which I would say is okay, but also the price for it.  I am willing to pay the price for now for a couple of the other flavors, but not orange.<br /><br />There are two major problems with ordering Zevia products.  First, they're expensive.  At just over a dollar a can they are pricey, no other way to describe it.  The second, is availability.  Amazon is really having some issues with keeping Zevia flavors in stock with Prime shipping.  The third party sellers all have exuberant shipping prices bringing your case of soda to over fifty dollars.  I've emailed Zevia about this and did get a response from them.  I hope Amazon can keep it stocked and Zevia can keep them supplied.  It's a good product but it's been frustrating trying to order due to Amazon's stock.  Due to the high price tag I put it on a monthly schedule to save 15%.  It helps but I wonder if Amazon will have it ready to go each month.<br /><br />The Zevia Orange is an okay tasting soda.  I will not be purchasing any more of it even if it's all Amazon Prime has in stock.

review/summary: Good Stuff! Not Overly Sweet!!
review/text: OK,..I'm speaking on behalf of the Orange Soda here. When I first popped the tab and drank a sip of the Zevia Orange,..it did NOT hit me with the anticipated sweetness that I had come to expect from say a Diet Sunkist Soda or any of your typical SugarFree Orange sodas. I wasn't disappointed per say, but just surprised a bit by the unexpected lack of sweetness.<br /><br />Now, with that being said,...and a few cans later,..this has quickly become my "go to" drink when I want a refreshing orange soda. It is very good and very quenching (due to the noticeable lack of sodium) on a hot summer day. The aroma is wonderful and the flavor is very close to as real as you can get before drinking straight orange oil. It's a really good soda and I'm now tempted to try the Root Beer and the Cola.

review/summary: Better than Sunkist and Orangina!
review/text: Ever since I learned about the dangers of sugar and chemical sugars, I have avoided them like the plague.  Then when I accidentally discovered an online ad for a "stevia-sweetened" soft drink named Zevia, well, let's just say I was hooked.<br /><br />Zevia is an alternative to diet soda that is sweetened with my two favorite sweeteners: erythritol and stevia. Wow! There is no calcium-removing phosphoric acid like you'd find in regular toxic sodas. And the taste is great! I've only tried the Orange and Natural Twist flavors with Orange being my favorite so far. I hear they came out with a new root beer flavor so that makes a total of four different Zevia sodas to choose from.<br /><br />Diabetics and those with Candida will welcome this new alternative to soda. I know me and my father sure did. Can't wait to open a nice cold one right after I write this review. Ahhhhhh!

I didn't think it was possible to feel worse about my miscarriage, but then this pathetic thing arrived on my doorstep. Not only that, but it was delivered over a week late (we opted for 2 day shipping). The description doesn't bother to mention anything about the contents, so allow me: 15 small chocolate items. Small, small, small. There were 3 regular sized chocolate bars and the rest were miniatures.<br /><br />They sell those mini Ghirardelli squares for 50 cents at convenience stores. Yet somehow 4 of those, 3 chocolate bars, and some other miscellaneous minis stuffed haphazardly in a cheap, crappy basket and shrink wrapped in a shipping facility cost $40??<br /><br />I don't know how else to phrase it, this thing sucks.<br /><br />We learned our lesson with this "gift basket" stuff- BUY IN PERSON (same goes for flower arrangements).

I was concerned that they might be too hard, since the box says "baked with rough oatmeal, for a coarse oaty texture".  If I had to describe them, I'd say mealy.  Unlike a lot of gluten free products, these didn't come broken.  They are delicious, and very filling.  I had two as a snack, and then couldn't eat lunch for awhile!  I had mine with peanut butter, but they'd be fabulously addictive with cheese or Cheez Whiz.  We're all about Cheez Whiz at my house and buy it in bulk.  Give these little charmers a try, and you won't want to be without them. Millions of Scotsmen can't be wrong, and neither can I!

I encourage you to ignore the previous review about there being alcohol in the extract: all extracts are suspended in alcohol- normally an pure fruit oil and alcohol mixture.<br /><br />Anyways, the extracts were well packaged and shipped quickly. I was pleased to find that the 4 oz container is tinted glass and the aroma is superb. I have used the extract in various baked goods and it provides a lovely hint of lemon.<br /><br />The only con about this item is that it is very subtle. I need to add what seems to me to be a lot of extract to get the dominate lemon flavor in things like lemon poppy seed muffins.<br /><br />I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who is in short supply of fresh lemon juice. This makes an excellent substitution.

review/summary: GREAT LEMONY EXTRACT!
review/text: I Really like this Lemon Extract it is of premium quality with excellent results I do a lot of Baking and use many different Extracts and they are all made with a very high percentage of alcohol is the only way, Vanilla, Vanilla Nut, Orange, Coconut, Butter, Banana, Lemon, Anise, Extracts, I use them all, except for Almond extract, we don't use that one too much. I am always looking for different Brands and some are very good like this one. We make Pound Cakes of various flavors, among many other things, and the Lemon and Orange ones are some of my Favorites.

review/text: I buy so many of these crackers a year the company should give me free stock!  I use these in recipes that call for regular saltines and it just gives the recipes that extra "punch" that they would not otherwise have.  The butter in them just adds an extra moistness but they're also awesome as a dip cracker.  Plus, they add a little extra flavor when crushed up into soups.  They do have a tendency to get stale quicker than others though but I guess that's why they make Ziploc bags! Highly recommend!

For the amount of money I paid for this, these Skittles will last him a good month or two (he even went out and bought a motion sensored candy dispensor at CVS for them). It's just great for the money you pay for all of those Skittles!

review/summary: Slightly variations from the Mint Flavor
review/text: I tried several different flavors of Mentos gum, but was rather disappointed by the overall product.<br /><br />First of all, the good points. The gum comes in a hard, durable container, which is easy to carry around in one's pants pocket, and also facilitates dispensing. Additionally, I like the initial texture of the gum, as it has a hard exterior shell and a soft chewy interior core, which immediately releases a burst of flavoring. Lastly, the texture and consistency of the gum is maintained throughout the mastication process.<br /><br />Now, the bad part. The biggest drawback is that the flavor only lasts at most a few minutes, necessitating me to eat several pieces at once in order to maintain any semblance of lasting mint flavor. Compared to other rival brands such as Dentyne or Eclipse, this is unacceptable. I'm not interested in chewing a piece of bland plastic after just 2-3 minutes. Some have also commented that the hard container makes too much noise in one's pants pockets when walking around.<br /><br />In summary, the Mentos are best used as an ephemeral breath mint, rather than a long-lasting gum.<br /><br />Now in regards to this particular flavor of red fruit lime, I find that the flavor lasts slightly longer as compared to the mint flavor.  Still not long enough, but just a smidgeon longer.  Additionally, the packaging is deceptive, because the core of the gum is most certainly not green colored.

review/summary: Oh Danny boy...the matcha, the matcha is calllling....
review/text: Irish cream teas tend to make me sad. What I've found is that they tend to taste like regular tea with a hint of Irish cream in the background, like you had poured a drop or two into your tea. Which is all well and good, but I drank Irish cream straight up when I was in college, and I want something that tastes like the drink itself. At this point, you're probably wondering if I did anything but drink in college. The answer is....no, not really. Ha! I want an Irish cream tea that I can splash into other teas to make them taste like Irish cream.<br /><br />So I cheated a little with this one. Just a little, I promise! I mixed my spoon of matcha with a few drops of my Irish cream agave before adding the water. I was blown away. It was so, so, so good. It got me through an incredibly long day at work and it kept a smile on my face long after it was gone. It smelled and tasted so strongly of Irish cream that my boss side eyed me a few times until I showed him it was just matcha. And then he was jealous.<br /><br />I love this tea. With the milk allergy issues, Irish cream was one of the things I had to give up and it was with a heavy heart that I did so. This is one of those teas I've been searching and searching for and once again, Red Leaf Tea did it right. I am constantly impressed by them...you'd think by now, I'd just expect their matcha to be amazing. But no, every time I get a new package, I'm floored by the tastiness.

review/summary: Creamy Boozy Delight
review/text: I got this one special for my boyfriend as a surprise. Last time he got to pick out a matcha, we ended up with Cola, so this time I thought an alcoholic drink matcha was in order. More sophisticated? Well - more adult anyways ;)<br /><br />He is loving the flavoured matcha as much (if not more!) than I do! This one smelled sweet from the get go - creamy and .. tangy? Smoky? Not smoky! I'm trying to describe what irish cream smells like - it doesn't have the smokiness of whisky - but it definitely is sweet and creamy! I knew it was going to be a real treat - just like the real thing!<br /><br /> What a neat flavour experience! I prepared the matcha straight and thick for the first bowl. In this state I tasted mostly matcha with an aftertaste of sweet cream that lingered after finishing the bowl. It was very creamy and pleasant.<br /><br />Next I tried it over ice with 18% cream and sugar. I thought my eyes were going to roll into the back of my head and be lost forever! This was mine and Mike's favourite way to enjoy it. It's sweet, but because you have control over the amount of sugar, it's not crazy sweet and cloying. You could probably enjoy cup after cup with the only buzz coming from the energy of all that matcha you're drinking!<br /><br />This one is so so good mixed with the Madagascar Vanilla matcha - it just adds a bit of something that takes the creamy flavour over the top. Come St. Patricks day, it would be an awesome drink to mix with mint matcha (Mint is on the way in the mail as we speak!) and hey - it's already green! No need to add any food colouring for your Paddy experience ;)<br /><br />Now - if a Guinness Matcha ever comes out - I know the perfect one to mix it with ;)

review/text: I'm experimenting with various Campbell soups because I'm on diet.  And from a diet point-of-view the Beefy Mushroom soup is not bad.

There is less than 1/4 cup of anything solid, ie, mushrooms or beef cubes.<br /><br />Another minus is the MSG (monosodium glutamate).<br />Another minus is the 890 mg of sodium.  Yikes!

review/summary: Campbell's Beefy Mushroom Soup Is Still Made
review/text: I'm another one of those people who have looked for years, without success, to find Campbell's Beefy Mushroom Soup on the grocery store shelves.  But, by searching on the internet recently, I came across the soup for sale on Amazon.  Others, as well as myself, have wondered if the product was fresh stock since it's very hard to find.  Well, I recently called Campbell's to inquire if the soup was still in production, and they assured me it was.  So, last fall, I ordered 2 cases of the soup on Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H136JY">Campbell's Beefy Mushroom, 10.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> and the expiration was in 2011 or 2012 (I forget).  I've already used up all the soup and I'm ready to order more.  When this soup first appeared in grocery stores years ago, the label had this YUMMY recipe on it, which I have used ever since.  It is my husband's favorite hamburger dish.  This recipe transforms ordinary hamburger into a delicious comfort food your family is sure to love.  It's so easy to make, but ohhh sooo good!  Here it is:<br /><br />"Campbell's Salisbury Steak"<br /><br />1 (10 3/4 ounce) can Campbell's Beefy Mushroom Soup<br />1 1/2 lbs ground beef<br />1 egg, lightly beaten<br />1/2 c. fine dry breadcrumbs<br />1/4 c. finely chopped onion<br />1/8 t. pepper<br />1/4 c. water<br /><br />1) Add 1/4 c. soup, egg, breadcrumbs, onion and pepper to the ground beef and mix well.<br />2) Shape into 6 patties.<br />3) Brown both sides in ungreased skillet, over medium heat; not cooking them completely.<br />4) Drain off the fat.<br />5) Spoon over the patties the undiluted Beefy-Mushroom soup and 1/4 c. water.<br />6) Cover the skillet and simmer over low heat 20 minutes or until done, spooning the gravy over the patties occasionally.<br />7) Delicious served with mashed potatoes, cooked green beans and rolls with butter.<br /><br />Serves 6

review/text: I haven't been able to find this in my local grocery stores so have stocked up through amazon. I sometimes have this soup on its own but I especially like it with pasta and it's a cinch to make. My favorite easy-easy-easy recipe is to take a can of the soup, add 1/4 to 1/2 a can of water (optional -- as "sauce" it's thicker without the water of course), cook it on the stovetop, pour half of it over cooked pasta or egg noodles (the standard 2 oz. UNCOOKED weight per serving), and mix well. Put in a medium square Ziploc container, snap on the lid, and freeze. (So the way I do it, I get 2 servings per can of soup.)  I usually have several of these in my freezer so if I am lazy I just grab one to take to work with me -- it heats up in the microwave in 2-3 minutes.  It makes a pretty filling lunch that is low in calories, very low in fat (maybe 2 or 3 grams per serving including the egg noodles), and quite tasty!  (Yeah, no veggies, so have a salad with it, :-) .)  You can get more recipes at Campbell's web site or elsewhere online -- I am always experimenting with their soups, and amazon makes it easy to stock up on them and try lots of different things.

review/summary: BACK by popular demand
review/text: While not yet back in the stores, some company has heard the voice of the customer and responded.  It has now been in production for a few weeks and supposedly coming soon to a store near you with no need to settle for old product @ $2 or $3 a can bought from scalpers.  This is one I have been demanding since it was discontinued.  Now if I could just get Kraft to start making yellow mustard again, Heinz to start making Cajun BBQ sauce again, and about 50 other products that are apparently no longer pulling in enough to make it worthwhile in today's shave every penny from every inch of shelf space world, things wouldn't seem quite as bad.  It is these little seemingly insignificant things (when they are around every day) that add to the ability to cope in an ever stressed out environment.  Too philosophic for a missing can of soup and bottle of mustard?  Priorities all messed up?  Remember NEW COKE!  Better yet, remember when you got a wooden case of Coke delivered to your door in 5 minutes (you have to be over 45 for this one) if you called and said you just drank a flat or funny tasting Coke?  To you younger folks, this is TRUE!  Guys on trucks drove all over the city with cases of Coke to deliver to anyone who had a complaint.  That was customer service.  Give me the late 50's and early 60's WITHOUT RACISM anytime.  We can find a way to get there.  Demand the Bureauracracies give us our lives back.  We don't need them.

review/summary: Amazing Product!
review/text: Like most Amercians, curry was a mystery to me, aside from the reputation for 5 alarm heat! I looked up the definition of curry & found it to be a very complex product of many, many exotic & sometimes obscure spices. A co-worker gave my husband a box of this product after an especially good potluck.<br /><br />This product lends a deliciously rich and complex flavor. You control the heat by deciding how much you want to use. I made a curry vegetable stew with cashews and garbanzo beans and then used a small piece of this product to add flavor. I then added a cup of Greek Yogurt to add some character to it. Wow! Delicious and hearty. My husband loved it. And somehow the curry spices neutralized the gassy potential of the chickpeas. I added a little extra curry to my bowl to bring the flavors up to my liking, as my husband won't eat anything with detectable pepper heat. I plan to order the "Mild" when my current box is gone.<br /><br />This product is wonderful, convenient & highly recommended. AND the shelf-life is phenomenal. I know this because I cooked with it recently, only to discover afterwards it was YEARS beyond the "Best Used Before" date. It had no rancidity & was so good I would've never known if I hadn't looked at the box.

review/summary: Brings me back to Japan everytime!
review/text: This is the. best. Japanese. curry. EVER.  Period!  Growing up, I lived with my family in Japan for eight years and curry was a family favorite (even for two very, very picky little boys).  When we moved back my mom was able to find this at the local Asian market - and years later, when I moved out and had to cook on my own, I found it on Amazon.  HURRAY!  This is a staple in our house, especially during the winter.  It is now a family favorite for MY family - husband, and kids aged 6, 5, and 2.  It is SUPER simple to make (trust me when I say this!  I am not much of a cook!).  Just add chicken and veggies to the pot!  I do alter the recipe a bit but adding only 1 onion and more carrots, but that's just our personal prefernce.  Half a package will feed my family of 5, with leftovers.<br /><br />This curry also comes in mild and hot.  Hot is too spicy for my kiddos and mild is too mild for my husband.  But they are all good.  Try it - I PROMISE you will love it!  I would give it 10 stars if I could!!

review/summary: a family favorite for twenty years
review/text: I married into the Japanese culture and a whole new world of cuisine was opened up to me. I didn't know that curry is actually a staple dish in many Japanese households, nor that sauce mixes like this are a very "traditional" way of making curry, meaning it's one thing that home cooks don't usually make from scratch. This brand is the favorite and most popular from what I was told by my in-laws and I can see why.<br /><br />It comes formed sort of like a chocolate bar with break points in it that you can snap off as much as you need. The flavor is warm and not to spicy; I prefer mild but my family likes it a little hot and this was not too spicy for me. We usually add beef cubes, potatoes, onions and carrots and serve over Japanese/sticky rice and it makes a fantastic supper.<br /><br />Very pleased with this product and highly recommended.

review/summary: Rooibos Tea and Spices.
review/text: Rooibos is Afrikaans for "red bush." Grown in South Africa's Cederburg Mountains and harvested during the summer, this tea acquires its unique red color as a result of fermentation (in mounds) and oxidization, when it is spread out to dry in the sunlight; naturally it is green.<br /><br />Rooibos is known for its health benefits stemming from its rich content in vitamins, antioxidants, flavanoids and minerals (inter alia, magnesium, calcium, iron, copper, zinc, potassium, fluoride, manganese and alpha-hydroxy) and has a long tradition of medicinal use among the local Native population; among other things, it is known to help cure asthma, hay fever and other allergies, acne, eczema, colics, indigestion, insomnia, and nervous tension. Containing very few tannins and no caffeine, rooibos has a distinctive aroma and amber color.<br /><br />This tea blends well with various spices and condiments; my favorite mixture is a delicious loose leaf blend sold by my local tea store, which features orange peel, cinnamon, grated coconut, finely minced chili and red pepper. For a more commercial alternative, though, Tazo's Red Bush tea is a great choice as well: a rich, exquisite blend of rooibos, hibiscus, orange peel, rosemary, several lemon ingredients (lemon myrtle, verbena and balm), as well as a number of sweet spices. Enjoy!

review/summary: Soft Drinks Made With Cane Sugar for My Guests.
review/text: Some time ago (September, 2009) I wrote a review for Mexican Coke. It came in 12-ounce bottles in a 24-bottle case. The bottles resembled the old fashioned Coke bottles. The main distinction between Mexican Coke and that manufacture in the USA was that Mexican coke was made with cane sugar whereas American Coke was made with high fructose corn syrup. Some people worry about possible health effects of HFCS and others simply don't like the taste as well. Personally, I think the Mexican Coike tastes a bit better. Gormet Coca Cola? Well, whatever, Mexican Coke has now become a big favorite and you can find it all over, even in restaurents.<br /><br />Now, on my last trip to my local Costco store, I found a 12-bottle case of "Vintage Soda," a variety of past-famous American soda beverages. There's Dad's Root Beer, Bubble Up, Nesbitt's Orange Soda and NuGrape Soda. All are made with cane sugar. They're quite good, but I have no standard bottles for comparison. Also, I only rarely drink sodas. I have a supply at home, but it's mainly for guests. Some guests want diet drinks and some don't care for diet sodas. so for the sweetend ones, I use the cane sugar varieties.They get good reviews and it makes for an interesting conversation piece.<br /><br /> Gary Peterson

review/text: We've tried every brand (DeBoles, Tinkyada, etc.) and the Quinoa pasta is the easiest to cook.  Add a bunch of oil to the pasta water, bring to a boil, and pour in the pasta *while stirring*.  Bring to a new boil, turn down to a simmer, and cook for 6-7 minutes (depends on heat--test after 4 minutes).  Drain and if you overcooked it, rinsed under COLD water--sometimes you can save GF pasta by doing this.  The quinoa pasta is high in protein and an excellent GF pasta.

review/summary: Read the fine print on the box of QUINOA Ancient Harvest Supergrain Pasta
review/text: While this pasta tastes better than many whole grain pastas, I am giving a ranking of 2 because although the packaging strongly suggests this product contains a significant amount of quinoa, the actual amount of quinoa in the corn-quinoa blend may be just slightly greater than the amount of dried spinach needed to color a few of the pieces green. So don't have your decision swayed by the side or back panels, which detail the wonderful nutritional profile of quinoa and its history of cultivation. Note that the company's website states "our Corn/Quinoa gluten free pasta is primarily a corn based product." So maybe they should be putting the word "corn" in the big print?

review/summary: Falls apart, leaving a gritty mess
review/text: I really like the other Ancient Harvest GF pastas.  I tried two boxes of this and varied cooking times, sauces, and experimented with a few other variables.  Without fail, anytime I had to re-heat the pasta, it fell apart when I stirred it.  I am the only person in the house who has to be GF so I am usually the only one eating the pasta.  It is kind of a pain to make a single serving of my pasta and a pot full for everyone else.  I like being able to make a few serving to refrigerate and have something for lunch the next day, but the way this pasta just crumbles creates a texture I can't stand.  It's tiny pasta pieces and sauce, which I haven't had with the other pastas.  It's also the only brand that I had trouble finding a good cooking time.  The box says 4 to 6 minutes, but that always left hard pasta, even when dropped in salted water that was at a rolling boil.  I would check minute by minute and it seemed to be different every time, and sometimes it seemed like only half the noodles were cooked well and the others were too hard or over-cooked.  I'm a decent cook and don't have that issue with the other AH pastas, GF pastas, or the wheat pastas I cook for the rest of the family.  I will skip the shapes and stick to the other pastas made by Ancient Harvest.

review/summary: Perfect Texture and Flavor!
review/text: I have cooked this pasta several times and had no trouble with it at all. I have no gluten intolerance, so my use of this pasta started out as experimental, and my continued use is simply based on taste and texture.  I wonder if the negative reviews of this pasta came from people who don't otherwise prepare pasta correctly. I have had no trouble with it, as it cooks like traditional pasta. Generously salt the water, bring to boil and add pasta. Allow the water to return to a boil and continue to cook on full heat until the pasta is done.<br /><br />It's important to note, I suppose, that cooking time varies among all stoves regardless of whether or not the pasta is semolina based or gluten free. How much heat a pot of boiling water receives is going to affect cooking time. As for any pasta, the time on the box should be used only as a guideline to give you an idea of when to check your pasta. Pasta water must be salted, and the pasta occasionally stirred.<br /><br />This pasta may come out too hard if it's not been cooked long enough, I guess. Too soft means it was cooked for too long, (and perhaps that the pasta water was not salted), which is why you taste the pasta before dumping the pot into a strainer. Again, this is true for all pasta, so my guess is people who had a problem cooking this pasta were probably interpreting the cooking time too literally and not sampling a piece before straining. In my kitchen, all pasta colors cooked evenly.<br /><br />When the pasta is cooked correctly:<br /><br />the pasta texture is excellent and very comparable to traditional semolina pasta. In fact, regarding texture specifically, there is little discernible difference at all. My family of regular pasta eaters could not discern between this and regular pasta. I served it with marinara sauce which probably masked the subtle flavor difference. This pasta is made from corn and has subtle notes of corn to it, the way a spinach pasta has notes of spinach: it still tastes like pasta. These are mostly detectable when the pasta is eaten completely plain, but hardly when the pasta is sauced at all. In fact, the notes of corn actually work really well with certain dishes and I would certainly choose this pasta for certain dishes for that very reason.

review/text: I've tried quite a few different brands of this type of microwave meal that doesn't need freezing or refrigeration, and most of them are not very good. What they lack in flavor, they make up for in high fat, salt, or other junk I'd rather avoid. They also have a tendency to taste like plastic.<br /><br />This Barilla Penne and Marinara were pleasantly surprising. The sauce smells a bit more like basil than I usually like, but tastes great, with a good combination of fresh tomato and spices. The pasta was perfectly al-dente. Actually, it was much better than expensive frozen dinners have been able to produce.<br /><br />Adding a little fresh parmesan, this was a tasty and filling lunch.<br /><br />The only downside is in the packaging, which seems overly substantial. The tray and inner sauce holder are both made of very heavy plastic, which seems like a waste. Fortunately, they are recyclable.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: Barilla's Penne Traditional is a very tasty microwaveable meal with plenty of pasta.  The sauce compares well with some Italian restaurants - chunky bits of tomato, smooth tomato taste and nice firm pasta.  It cooks up really fast.  Once cooked, the sauce needs to be mixed with the pasta and that can be tricky if not paying attention.  The tray with the sauce needs to be carefully lifted off the main container and poured on the pasta.  Not a big problem but has the potential to spill.<br /><br />Otherwise, mix and enjoy.  Barilla also makes a spicier version of this pasta containing basil - not bad either but I prefer this one.

review/summary: Good for lunch, part 2!
review/text: I tried another variety of these Barilla mezze penne dishes, so my observations on the basic product and its packaging are in that other review, with a good impression overall. I found the packaging to be user-friendly and love the fact that these meals have all-natural ingredients.<br /><br />I thought that the taste of this mezze penne meal with the traditional marinara sauce was just like the other one I tried, with the real difference being that the other one had whole wheat pasta. I don't know that I really distinguished any difference between the two, having them for lunch on two consecutive days, but I did enjoy both.<br /><br />In this one I noticed the chunks of tomato and onions. The sauce was thick enough for the pasta, yet it still poured easily from the separate container upon coming out of the microwave.<br /><br />I like that you don't have to add water to these dishes before microwaving; the pasta is already cooked and just has to be heated.<br /><br />Overall, my impression of this product was very good.

review/summary: Not the worst thing I ever tasted.
review/text: Okay, this is not your sweet nonni's special Sunday sauce, and the penne aren't her own hand cut and rolled individually around the handle of her wood spoon little pastas that you grew up with (and if the food was that good, why the heck did you leave home?  Ask yourself!).  But it won't kill you.  And if you are up to here with tunafish sandwiches, on a budget, in a hurry, and trapped inside because Life As We Know It has come to a disasterous end, it's not a bad lunch.  It's not good, but there are worse things, and we've all probably tasted them. Canned spaghetti, for one thing. Or canned chicken noodle soup, lord help us and the poor chicken that died in vain for that stuff.<br /><br />If you are used to those bottled supermarket sauces, you might find this completely acceptable.  It is mostly salty and slightly tomato-ey.  The sauce is a tiny bit on the bitter side, probably from dehydrated garlic. It has that metallic aftertaste. But you can taste the basil, there are little red chunks that could indeed be tomato, and the texture of the pasta is not as bad as it might be. It has a sort of gummy/pastiness, but not that slimy tongue-feel of canned soup noodles.<br /><br />You have to cook it a bit longer than the instructions state, especially if you have an underpowered microwave.  The portion size is decent, but it's not exactly low cal, packing about 350 calories. If you add a salad and a beverage, you're looking at 500 to 600 calories easy, and you could have had a Big Mac or a ham and cheese sandwich or something really really good instead.<br /><br />If you work in an office where people steal food, offer the crooks a taste. This stuff is not so good that they'll be tempted to "borrow" a box when you're not looking.<br /><br />I would definitely buy this if I were a survivalist. A good change from the  canned beefaroni. I might buy this to keep on hand at work for emergencies...days when I forgot to bring something from home or going out for real food was not possible, and every restaurant in town suddenly stopped delivering. I would not buy them as an altenative or replacement for the real thing.  And the real thing is so easy to make...and takes no time at all.  Boil pasta according to package directions. Put a little olive oil in a frying pan, throw in some finely chopped garlic. Let it saute on low heat...but don't let it brown. Cut a pint of cherry tomatoes in half and toss them in. Add a pinch of sugar and a pinch of red peper flakes or some cayenne or chili powder. Diced chile peppers are even better, as many as you like for as hot as you like.  Cook for ten minutes. Drain the pasta, toss it into the frying pan and swirl it around so it gets all mixed up with the tomatoes and garlicky oil. Add some shredded basil.  You can throw in some diced mozzarela, sprinkle on parmesan or asiago or whatever Italian grated cheese you like.  20 minutes, start to finish, and you have something really nice. With crusty bread, a tart green salad and some wine, it's a feast. Buy some supermarket lemon sorbet and tart it up with grated lemon peel and some mint leaves and you are a chef.

review/summary: Perfect for a quick lunch!
review/text: I was impressed with this meal, I couldn't imagine the quality Barilla is known for being seriously ready for consumption in sixty seconds. What I love most about it was the fact that it had real sauce that is comperable to what you would put on your homemade pasta. Most meals like this taste more like an upgraded cup of noodles, where this is a nice meal in a crunch. Now I will say you really need to read the instructions before cooking. The opening instructions can be assumed and cause the sauce to go flying when the food is done cooking. With that in mind, it's not ideal for kids to cook on their own. The film was rather tight and I can see a child or pre-teen getting burned if they are not paying attention while the open the contents. With that, please be careful. Outside of that, it was delicious for a microwave meal.

review/summary: Another good quick meal option.
review/text: My partner and I both work from home, and so we often need quick-fix meals for lunch in the middle of the day. So we gave these a try, and were quite pleased! The pasta softened up very well, and the sauce heated up with no problems at all. Very tasty as well, and while the portions could have been a little bigger, overall we were pretty happy with them.

review/summary: Very Good for 60 Second Meal
review/text: The Barilla Mezze Penne with Traditional Marinara Sauce was ready in 60 seconds when cooked on high in my 800 watt microwave.  The penne came out perfect - not too hard or soft.  The traditional marinara sauce was quite good, but I prefer the spicy marinara sauce. It was a little hard to pull the cover off, and the sauce, since it was in a separate little container, did splatter a bit.  The meal consists of 320 calories and includes 6g of fiber.  For a 60-second meal, it is very tasty.  Just add a salad and slice of french bread - and this makes for a super quick meal.

review/summary: Just Ok, but a Brilliant Idea!
review/text: Barilla's new pantry Mezze Penne products are an exciting lineup.  You can enjoy a hot pasta meal in 60 seconds.  Furthermore, the product stores at room temperature, which allows you to take it to work to use in a work microwave, or to have it shipped from a store like Amazon.com without worry in most climates.  This product includes the Traditional Marinara Sauce.<br /><br />The pasta sauce is stored in a bin above the pasta.  To prepare the meal, you peal back the top seal to expose the sauce and allow ventilation.  You heat it for 60 seconds.  Let it cool, remove the rest of the seal carefully, pour the sauce on the pasta, transfer it to a plate should you wish, and eat!  It's fast, and it is simple.  No refrigeration required.  It truly is a nifty idea.<br /><br />The only downside is that they are not the tastiest products.  I have tried the Tomato & Basic, Marina, and Spicy Marina.  It's extremely difficult for me to tell a difference between any of the sauces.  The sauces are not great.  Just ok.  My favorite is probably the Spicy Marina, but it's truly stretching it to call one my favorite and again, to even differentiate the taste between sauces is difficult.<br /><br />In terms of the pasta, it comes out slightly gooey and not as soft as it could be.  Just ok.  There are some additional instructions provided, to add some water to the pasta after the first 60 seconds and cook longer, but these instructions are not completely clear.  I tried this once, and the pasta did not change at all.<br /><br />Overall, a brilliant idea.  With the great storage ability, it's not bad to have one or two of these on hand for a long work day, when you want a simple lunch or dinner fast.  However, in general, I would not want to consume these on a daily basis.  Perhaps, over time, they will improve the product.  If they could include just a slightly higher quality sauce and pasta, it could be a real winner.  Right now, just ok.

review/summary: Very tasty!
review/text: This pasta was very good! I was a bit skeptical at first about the pre-cooked pasta in a container that did not need to be refrigerated, but I ate it and had no ill side effects :)<br /><br />The instructions to heat up the pasta and sauce were simple and because it's not a frozen meal, it only took about 1:30 in the microwave. The pasta was cooked well. The sauce, while simple marinara, was really good. Just enough seasoning to make it taste good without taking away from the great tomato taste. The marinara was also chunky and not pureed or watery or runny.<br /><br />Overall a very good product that I would eat again.

review/summary: Surprisingly Good
review/text: This Barilla brand meal comes in a microwavable dish and needs no refrigeration or freezing. I have tried other brands and they do not compare too this in taste. Plus the other brands I have tried all required the addition of water too the noodles before microwaving and this does not. Easy too store and cook!<br /><br />The Penne with Marinara Sauce is microwaved in its container for only sixty seconds and the pasta came out just fine. The marinara sauce was flavorful and when mixed made for a fast and delicious meal. I found it enjoyable and as I can no longer lift boiling water this is an excellent alternative. Not as good as home made but much better than canned pasta and other brands of microwavable meals I have tried. I would get this again.

review/text: I am a professor and associate dean at a local college, so my days are typically long and I rarely have time to make or buy food. Usually, I will grab a frozen meal to throw in the microwave at work. But this is not ideal because...well...we all know the good and bad of frozen meals. So when I saw that there was another option, I became extremely excited! I grabbed one of these meals and brought it to work. It is perfect! There are specific instructions on how long to microwave and what to microwave. When you follow the instructions, it is a really good meal! I won't say that it tastes exactly like when I make pasta at home, but it's definitely a better option than your typical frozen meals.

review/summary: Tastes FRESH and it is actually filling
review/text: This product is hands down one of the BEST shelf stable meals on the market. It is easy to prepare but I do caution to pay close attention to the packaging as the sauce is separate from the pasta and you don't want to splash your clothing when you take the plastic film off after cooking so hold the bowl firmly.  The sauce is rich and has chunks of fresh tasting tomatoes,basil, oregano and other spices that you can SEE and more importantly taste! The pasta is cooked but firm and it holds up well to the rich sauce. There are NO preservatives which makes it even more remarkable for being so flavorful. I would highly recommend these for a quick lunch or to use as a mid afternoon snack if you are having a late dinner. I want to try all the varieties!

review/summary: Mediocre but passable in a pinch
review/text: I can't say that I recommend the Barilla Mezze Penne with Traditional Marinara Sauce but neither can I pan it. Let me start off by saying that I do not usually eat microwaveable meals (i.e., soups, canned pastas, frozen dinners, etc.), not because I have anything against them, but because I can't find any that I like. So, I was very much looking forward to trying this simple pasta dish with marinara sauce, hoping I might finally find a quick, easy meal that I like. I was skeptical that the pasta would come out firm enough for my liking and was pleasantly surprised that the pasta was a fairly decent firm texture to it when cooked according to the regular cooking instructions. (There are additional instructions for those who prefer their pasta softer.) While the texture was good, the flavor was not so great. The sauce tasted OK but the pasta itself had a slightly "off" flavor to it that would push past the sauce flavor if you didn't put enough sauce on it. If you scooped up enough sauce with it, I found it to be OK (not good, but OK). My teenage daughter also tried it and she did not notice an "off" taste to the pasta but did find the sauce to be a little to "tangy" after eating about half of the portion.<br /><br />Preparation was easy. You peel back a small corner of the plastic and microwave for 1 minute. That's it. I did have a little trouble removing the plastic cover once it was cooked. I really had to finesse it carefully so as to avoid spilling the sauce all over the place, but other than that, it couldn't have been easier.<br /><br />All in all, this pasta is palatable if you are in a pinch but it's certainly nothing to look forward to.

review/summary: Better Than Expected
review/text: When you sit down to eat one of these microwave meals you don't usually expect much. In this case I was pleasantly surprised.  The sauce had a good flavor and the noodles didn't taste like cardboard. For a quick lunch at work or at home this would be a good choice.
