review/summary: Lovely and subtle
review/text: For those who prefer strong tea, this may not be the tea for you. If, however, you enjoy a smooth and mellow cup, there are few teas that possess this blend of delicacy and grace. The combination of Earl Gray and lavender are softly melodious, a perfect quiet harmony that will leave you relaxed and satisfied. I wasn't expecting much from a commercial tea but this was a most pleasant surprise.

review/summary: My Favorite Tea
review/text: Delicately delicious, smells heavenly and taste is wonderful, hot or cold.  To make 3/4 gal iced tea just add 2 regular family sized tea bags and 5 lavender bags to almost boiling water and let steep 10-12 min., lightly sugar and cool.  This is very refreshing.  Figures out to $.22 per bag, great value & easy.

review/summary: Wonderful Flavor
review/text: I just tried a box of this tea recently and really loved it flavor! I never thought I was an Earl Grey tea lover let alone a fan of black teas. But this tea has changed my mind about both completely. Now I am a fan of both black tea and Earl Grey tea.<br /><br />I like that Revolution uses whole tea leaves in each tea bag. I also love the taste of lavender, but it does have a strong taste to it, so lavender must be used sparingly. Frankly, I was concerned that this particular tea would taste overwhelmingly of lavender, but to my delight the lavender taste was very subtle and delicate and it complimented the Earl Grey tea nicely. I will most definitely try this tea again.

review/text: I was hooked on this tea for a long time - it had great flavor and was frankly the best earl grey tea I'd ever had.<br /><br />Then, I had three bad experiences in a row, where the tea smelled and tasted like dish soap - absolutely horrible.  I'm guessing some kind of product was sprayed on ..?<br /><br />It may just be my own personal experience, as I got all three boxes from the same location in California.  Still, having the same thing happen with 3 different boxes on 3 different occasions has turned me off this tea for life.

review/summary: Interesting and enjoyable
review/text: Revolution Earl Grey Lavender Tea is a blend of Ceylon, Darjeeling, and Formosa oolong teas scented with French lavender buds in addition to the usual oil of bergamot.<br /><br />This tea comes in a pyramid-shaped bag with fine mesh that allows the leaves to bloom to make two pints of strong tea. There were only a few lavender flowers in the bag but they lent the tea a pronounced lavender flavor and mild lavender scent at the expense of the bergamot, which I had trouble detecting either by smell or taste.<br /><br />Now, I am a big fan of both lavender as a scent and Early Grey tea as a beverage but I don't generally appreciate floral flavorings.  Rose water taffy or rice pudding, lavender risotto, candied violets, anything of that sort always reminds me of soap, and not in a pleasant way.  Even vanilla is not a favorite, although I do enjoy hibiscus.<br /><br />However, the acidity of the tea balances out the floral qualities and after the first few sips, I began to enjoy the flavor and then was able pick up on the lavender scent when sipping.  I now appreciate this interesting, almost exotic taste in the way that citrus-scented Earl Grey tea must have been received when it was first introduced to England.  Definitely worth trying if it sounds interesting to you.  I may even get some food-grade lavender buds and make my own blend.

review/summary: In Oil...
review/text: I'm not expert as many are on this site, and so you can take this with a grain of salt, but I found this recently at our local market. I do happen to grow some spices, but I'm not always up to doing what I need to, so these 4 spice combo's are advertised here as be mixed with oil and good then with bread. ( Speaking of salt one of my mother's endearing superstitions is the spilling of salt, pinch over the left shoulder when you spill!)<br />The 4 choices of flavors are Sundried Tomato and basil( they call this Tuscany), Garlic and Tomato(Sicilian), Rosemary and Garlic(Rosa Maria), Roasted Garlic and Cheese(Parmesan Blend). I used making flatbread and made 4 kinds quickly today. I would not recommend replacing fresh herbs, but I like this and will send one out with my daughter because the kids liked the flavor.<br />Mom's flat bread recipe is good too, and I just sort of rolled it in the spices and did use this spice creatively:<br /><br />Hearth Flat Bread<br /><br />1 pkg. dry active yeast<br />1/2 tsp. sugar<br />1 3/4 cup flour<br />1 tsp. coarse kosher salt<br />1 tbsp. fresh thyme leaves<br />3/4 cup water ( might need bit more)<br />1 tsp. oil<br /><br />In a food processor combine yeast, sugar, flour , salt and thyme. Pulse and combine. Add the water in a steady stream until he dough gets to forming a ball, now you turn it out on a board and knead with the heel of your hand until the dough is smooth and elastic.<br /><br />Coat a bowl with oil. Place the dough in the bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Put in a warm spot to raise it until double in bulk, about an hour.<br /><br />When the dough has doubled punch it down. scrape it onto the counter or board and knead it lightly into a smooth ball. Cut into 20 pieces and with a rolling pin roll out to form ver flat 5 to 6 inch circles.<br /><br />Preheat a stove top grill pan over a medium high. Do not oil. Place bread on hot grill and cook without touching it until you see bubbles on the surface, about 1 to 2 minutes. Turn and continue to cook 1 to 2 minutes more or until bread has puffed up. Serve immediately.<br /><br />( mom says she got this from the Television Food Network)<br /><br />Again there are other's here with far greater insights, but if you see it you might like this to add to cabinet spices.

review/text: The main ingredient in all of these spices is SALT. If you need to watch your salt intake steer clear of this product. I'm sure this product would taste great for dipping bread if there wasn't so much salt in it. I'm not saying it tastes bad, its just that the salt overpowers all the other spices. I did give it two stars because I found another use for it, it is great on corn on the cob in place of salt! I guess that means I should try it on Popcorn!

review/text: This product arrived ahead of schedule. I was concerned after reading some of the reviews that it might have a lot of it's contents leaking in the wrapping, this was not the case but apparently someone wrapping it had sticky fingers as the wrapping was very sticky/syrupy. The product was thicker than I expected which is desirable for a product attempting to be pancake syrup but the taste was way to strong so to make it work for me I mixed it down with agave nectar and got a desirable taste. By itself it taste more like a concentrate that needs mixed down. I'll still try the maple syrup flavor eventually hopefully it doesn't taste like concentrate...we'll see.

I typically make "Swiss Method" coffee in a Jura superautomatic espresso machine.<br /><br />Typically, I've avoided the flavored coffees.  However, in this case I really enjoy the taste of the various flavors.  According to their website, Jazzy Java is Cafe Excellence's signature coffee.  It is a blend of butter rum, cinnamon and pecan flavors.  I really enjoy it.<br /><br />The roasting job done on the coffee is worth mentioning as well.  It looks to me like a full city roast, roasted to the 2nd crack.  It's quite full bodied and fresh, but importantly not overroasted.<br /><br />I generally prefer either decaf or half-caf and you wouldn't know that this is decaf coffee if you hadn't been told that it was.  I've tried Cafe Excellence's non-flavored coffees as well and they are also very good to excellent.  However, this blend is special.  Highly recommended!

review/text: So, this is pretty much the least expensive way to get Big Red on Amazon, and I have no problems with the product. It is Big Red (yum) and it arrives in less than 5 days. My only gripe is that each time I have ordered (two times total), 1-2 of my cans are crushed. It could probably use a little more padding for shipping to protect it.

review/summary: Simply one of the best espresso beans made
review/text: As a former shop owner, I can attest that this espresso earned extremely high ratings from my customers...prepared right.  I learned directly from Caffe' D'arte how they roasted their beans unlike the masses...sizing the beans and then roasting so that none are over or under done...then packing and shipping promptly to ensure freshness.  This comes in varied sizes if you get from them...1-5lb bags and whole or ground...I prefer whole bean and grind to get it just right.<br /><br />I have tried every one of Caffe D'arte's blends of coffee and espresso and this is my personal favorite that is not their Alderwood Roast blend (wow...that is even better...which is hard to believe).  If, for whatever reason, you get this and don't like it, I would suggest that it's something in your machine or methodology that is lacking since I have been able to extract a perfect shot thousands of times and had nothing but fantastic feedback from my customers.  Again...this is what I have at home, and my staple for routing the competition in quality.  You won't be disappointed, and if you visit Seattle, be sure to get to the roaster on the south end of town and the shop downtown.<br /><br />Having moved onto other things and long ago sold the shop, I seriously get jonesing for this coffee that keeps on calling my name to order more. I've never been disapointed in any of them...and doubt you would be either.

review/text: I just received my creamer and although it is delicious, it was quite a mess to clean up since the box was leaking creamer everywhere.  Gross.  I opened up all of the boxes and four of them had creamer packages leaking.  In all, there were 22 individual creamers that had burst open.  I'm guessing that they had froze at some point during shipping.  What a mess.

I couldn't detect any caramel taste to it.  One sip was enough for me due the overwhelming sweetness.  It tasted like someone had dropped a few dozen tablespoons of sugar in my coffee.  If you like extremely sweet coffee and don't care about caramel flavor, you might like this product.  If you mainly want caramel flavor, you would be better off with a caramel syrup or flavored coffee beans.

review/text: The product description claims "It contains no high-fructose corn syrup in regular flavors and no aspartame in diet flavors." This is true - instead ALL of the 12 sample flavors we got with our machine contain SPLENDA (sucralose), whether "diet" or not! You have to read the fine print to discover this. Prior to reading the fine print, we tried the root beer: hmm, tastes like root beer but with an artificial after-taste. Then the "Dr. Pepper": hmm, tastes like Dr. Pepper but with an artificial after-taste. Checked the fine print: sugar, PLUS SPLENDA. Who would have thought the NON-diet flavors would contain SPLENDA? We threw the remaining 10 sample packs out and will look elsewhere for flavorings that don't sneak artificial sweeteners in - Monin syrups come to mind.

review/text: The regular Cola is OK at best.  I bought the Sodastream and was unaware that most of the flavors have acesulfame potassium.  The Cola has a chemical taste which I think is coming from the acesulfame potassium.  I'm not a health food nut but I try to avoid artificial sweeteners.  The sample pack had some good tasting flavors such as Orange, Dr. Pepper, and Root Bear which all tasted as good as anything you buy in the store.  However I'm a cola drinker and the regular cola won't cut it for me.  The Diet Cola is even worse.  I'd like to try the Tonic but the reviews are terrible.  I'm planning on trying the All Natural Cola.  If the Natural Cola does not work I will be selling the Sodastream.  Sodastream is a ingenious idea, but unless they can come up with better cola's I think it will be a passing fad.

review/summary: SULFITES!!!! NOT MENTIONED BUT INCLUDED!!!!
review/text: I have worked for a major retailer for the past 20 years, we sell Soda Stream and all its accessories.  I even performed ALL the product samplings this past 4th quarter.  I bought one for myself.  I like it okay but slowly came to realize that every time I drank the diet cola my face would erupt with cysts that were huge and raw.  I thought it was stress or something else.  I went to an allergist and tested with very strong reaction to "sulfites".  everyone, I mean EVERYONE look at your bottles of syrup and despite all the "healthy" mumbo jumbo find the small print "contains sulfites".  My Dr. told me to stop drinking the soda stream diet cola (I believe all the flavors have sulfites, but I could be wrong) for several weeks.  I complied and stuck with good old Diet Coke.  My face cleared up within a few days and was cyst free.  Them my Dr. instructed me to make a batch of the diet cola in the 1 liter bottle and drink it throughout 1 day.  The next day the cysts were forming again and then progresively got worse.  Stopped using soda stream products completely and have had NO flair ups since.  I would be very careful as sulfites have many bad side effects.  I truly loved the product, its simplicity and sold tons of it because I thought it was great.  Little did I know I was selling something tainted with sulfites.  If you have noticed any strange blisters, cysts or acne do as I did with my Dr.s instructions and see for yourself.  I am male so don't insinuate it was a "monthly menstrual cycle".  BEWARE.

review/summary: SodaStream Jet
review/text: My family LOVES the sodaStream fizzy water,  and HATES the flavors SodaStream makes-  there is a definite aftertaste of Not-Sugar (sucralose) in the concentrates,  which can trigger migraines in sensitive people (like us).  However,  we have found that mixing the fizzy water with half juice (real cranberry is a favorite, and even the V8 V-Fusion juice blends)  gets us drinking more water and less juice without sacrificing taste. For lightly-flavored waters we do use a small amount of natural flavor extracts (we like McNess- no propylene glycol)  rather than the fruit flavors offered by SodaStream.  Definitely get an extra 2-pack of bottles,  though,  to keep chilled water ready for fizzing in the fridge. The gas cartridge refills  are quite easily found, as well.

review/text: Even though I opted out of recieving "email reminders" to leave feedback/reviews I just received one from this company, so here's my review:<br /><br />I've already left a review for the SodaStream machine, and it is not complimentary due to the monopoly on the CO2.  Had this firm read my recent reviews they would have seen that I dislike being asked to leave feedback and reviews.  It is unprofessional.<br /><br />The product is just ok, but being hounded to leave reviews/feedback prevents even a three star review.  If I were to buy this product again, and that is very doubtful, I'd go back to buying from a brick and mortar retail store, pay a higher price and sales tax.

review/summary: The taste isn't quite right...
review/text: I love the product so far - I think it's a great idea, saves money and saves me from carrying heavy bottles up 3 flights of stairs... but the syrup tastes "off". I would compare the regular flavors to off-brand, diet soda, and I haven't tried the diet flavors yet because I can't imagine that they would taste any better. I can tell that they use Splenda (or something other than real sugar) because the "sweet" taste that's found in most sodas is just not there.<br /><br />All of that aside, most of the flavors DO taste similar their counterparts (Fountain Mist = Mountain Dew, Lemon Lime = Sprite, etc.) I would recommend getting the Variety Pack to find which things you like before you buy a bottle that makes 12 liters.

review/summary: great product
review/text: I purchased the Soda Stream (Starter Kit)  as a Father's Day gift for my husband. We both enjoy soda water, but there are only a few brands we've found which do not taste "soapy."<br /><br />We've only had it for a week, but this little gadget works as advertised. It is easy and quick  and effective to use, and we all like that we can control the level of "fizz."  I like more, the kids like less. I bought extra bottles and flavorings (for the kids) so everyone could do their own. We use it mostly with filtered water, although the tap water works perfectly well too, as long as you have good tap water.<br /><br />The flavorings will be used  not as much around here, although they seem good and the kids like them.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product. The only caveat I would give at this point, is make sure you want more "gas" in your life.  My entire family is doing a lot more belching and burping than we ever have before, but we like this machine!

Anyway, unless you like and can drink diet drinks you will not like 'regular' flavors either.

review/summary: What Every Consumer Should Know - NOT Economical
review/text: The taste of SodaStream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands.  This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi.  Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering.  The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much.<br /><br />While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal.<br /><br />Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products.<br /><br />Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money).<br /><br />Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer.<br /><br />One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables. Instead of going to such establishments once every 3 to 6 months, customers will now visit once every 1 to 2 months. That makes an enormous difference for generating impulse purchases at such retailers. One could argue then that transportation costs could increase for the individual consumer.<br /><br />Total Costs = $1.73 per Two Liter -- More Expensive Than Retail<br /><br />*Concentrate<br />Flavor cost bottle of concentrate $4.99<br />Liters of product per container 12<br />Flavor/l $0.42<br /><br />*Carbonator<br />Volume of CO2 130<br />Cost of CO2 per refill (130 liters) 29.99<br />CO2 cost per liter $0.23<br /><br />*Sodastream Equipment Costs - Amortization Per Liter<br />Equipment cost $89.00<br />Equipment life (years) 5<br />Discount rate (cost of money) 8%<br />Liters per month 10.00<br />Monthly amortized cost $1.80<br />Cost of equipment per liter $0.18<br /><br />*Water Cost with Brita Filtration<br />Municipal water costs per liter in US $0.0004<br />Brita filter three pack (454 liters of water output) $16.95<br />Brita cost per liter $0.0373<br />Water and filter costs per liter $0.0377<br />(assumes you already own Brita Pitcher so no equipment costs, just incremental filtration)<br /><br />***TOTAL COSTS PER TWO LITER = (Flavor + CO2 + Equipment + Filtered Water) * 2<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.73<br /><br />Without filtered water:<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.65<br /><br />*****What does CO2 Really Cost????<br /><br />THE MATH BELOW IS WHAT SODASTREAM DOESN'T WANT THE CONSUMER TO KNOW<br /><br />*Restaurant Carbonation (note distributor prices, so there is still a distributor profit)<br />weight of CO2 contents of large restaurant CO2 tank: 50 lbs<br />weight in grams: 22,680 grams of CO2<br />cost to refill - Summer 2011: $35<br /><br />CO2 grams/liter of carbonated water: 7 grams<br /><br />*Efficiency of Restaurant CO2 Carbonation<br />losses: 10%<br />available CO2 in tank (residual is required for pressure): 85%<br />net accessible CO2 of total: 77%<br />usable grams of CO2: 17,350 grams<br /><br />*Output<br />carbonated liters of water: 2,479<br />cost per liter in USD$: $0.014<br /><br />*SodaStream Output<br />SodaStream Refill: 130 liters (quoted end product)<br />Cost per refill: $30.00<br />cost per SodaStream carbonated water: $0.231<br /><br />*SodaStream Markup Economics<br />ratio of SodaStream to Restaurant prices: 16.3x<br />SodaStream inflation price over restaurant pricing: 1534%<br />math: [y/x-x] to give increase over base case restaurant pricing<br /><br />This is an incredible 1500% markup<br /><br />Pros<br />Saves plastic<br />Allows flexible mixture of flavors<br /><br />Cons<br />Cost of output is not compelling<br />Grossly inflated CO2 refill costs<br />Another store trip required for refills separate from grocery store visit<br /><br />***Disclaimer: I am an investor who has used the product multiple times.

I may be on either side of the trade by the time you read this -- I am not very sentimental.

review/summary: Warning, non-diet syrup contains Sucralose (Splenda)
review/text: This stuff would be pretty good if it wasn't for the artificial sweetener.  I'm not sure why they insist on putting sucralose into a product labeled as non-diet, especially after touting that it contains real cane sugar.  It does, in fact, contain real sugar.  But the advantage is negated by the unmistakable aftertaste caused by the sucralose.<br /><br />I think they're trying to keep the calorie count down by creating a "half diet" drink.  But I don't like diet drinks.  I've never had one that didn't have some sort of weird taste or aftertaste.  I don't drink a lot of colas either, but I like to treat myself to one every now and then.  So, when I do drink one, I want one with real sugar, no HFCS, and no artificial sweeteners.  I used to seek out Mexican Coke for this, and I was hoping to get a similar product with the Sodastream.<br /><br />I think a lot of people are attracted to the Sodastream by the prospect of getting a purer product.  They're going to be disappointed by the presence of artificial sweeteners in these syrups.  It's not a big deal to me because I mostly use the Sodastream to make plain seltzer, but I'm sure their syrups would sell better if they would get rid of the sucralose.

review/summary: Sodastream
review/text: After years of dealing with increasing price of soda, finding place to store it and returning  empty bottles decided to give this a try. We bought ours at Costco which came with 1-130L Co2 Carbonator, 2 1-Liter Stainless Steel Bottles and trial flavors pack for $99. First let me say I'm very pleased, the flavors are not bad at all and i can use my own filtered water from either the fridge or Pure faucet attachment and no longer need to pay or bring back bottles for the deposit. They also have much less sodium than store bought soda with the exception of Diet Rite.<br /><br /> I have tried many diet flavors and the ones i like the best are Orange, Caffeine free cola, dr pete, Fountain Mist, Cream Soda and Root Beer. As for the cost it has changed everything, no longer have to pay deposit, return empties or search for sale price on soda which means lot less trips to the store saving me from impulse buying and gasoline usage. I can now make fresh bottles of soda whenever I need it (unlike store bought soda which can lose carbonation)  and any flavor I feel like at the time. Already used up  1- 130L Co2  carbonator bottle so ordered 1 full bottle + 1 exchange for empty bottle from SodaStream web site this way I'll always have one full bottle when one is done. You should always search the web for coupons for any online store before ordering and SodaStream is no exception, saved $15 which is the price of the license on a new bottle.  So it cost me the same as if ordering to exchange 130L Co2 Carbonators, pretty sweet. If you order 10 bottles of syrup at a time you get one free  and with on line coupons and cashing in points your earn from them with every purchase can save you more than just the shipping cost, the cost of a trip to the store. For me the SodaStream is well worth the cost.

review/text: I drink energy drinks maybe once or twice per week.  I usually stick to red bull or rock star as those cans don't overdo the caffeine and have a decent flavor.  The soda stream mix tastes very similar to rock star and costs a lot less money.  Just watch your serving size when you use the soda stream.  All canned energy drinks have a limit whereas you could drink the whole bottle of soda stream if you don't watch your serving size.

review/summary: Splenda in every flavor...tastes horrible
review/text: Wanted the Sodastream for my birthday.  Got it, made up the first cola.  It was horrid.  Got to reading about the products.  Sodastream seems to be so proud that they did not include aspartame in their diet products, and used only sugar in their non-diet products (Instead of high fructose corn syrup).  However, they also put Splenda (another artificial sweetner like aspertame) in every flavor they make...diet or not.  It leaves a horrible aftertaste in the non-diet drinks.  The whole point of not drinking diet pop is because people don't like the taste of diet pop.  My Sodastream is going back to the company with a message stating that if I wanted diet pop I would buy it myself, and they should only put sugar in regular soda.  They brag about real sugar, and then hide artifical sweetner in every product hoping no one will notice.  It shows in the bad taste of their regular sodas, and, in my opinion, does not make them a very reputable company.  Buyer beware.

Also, as of 2/15/2012, they charge 40-50% less at the SodaStream webstore but you may have to pay for shipping.  However, if you buy 10 bottles at Sodastream, you'll get 1 bottle free.  I'm not slamming the Amazon merchants but I think consumers should be aware of the significant price mark-up.<br /><br />(With this exception, I've found Amazon prices to be competitive with other stores so I continue to be an Amazon Prime Member.)<br /><br />If you only want one bottle, it may make sense to pay twice as much with free Amazon Prime shipping.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: This stuff is wonderful.  I like carbonated drinks, but not the sweetness or all the strange ingredients.  I use this with a very small amount of syrup or lemon juice and it's great!

review/summary: It's ok, but it's no "Diet Coke"
review/text: As other reviews have mentioned, this pice is ridiculous.  However the product itself is decent.  I purchased this elsewhere because I love the taste of Diet Coke and read some reviews that  tastes just lke Diet Coke.  (My parents have had a soda fountain in their house since I was 2, I'm 31 now) ...  This tastes alot like Coke but no like Diet Coke(which makes sense, it doesn't use aspartame, it uses the sugar free sugar stuff)<br /><br />It is nice being able to make soda on demand though ...  I'm going to siphon some syrup from my parents and try that (if it works, you can get 5 gallon "bags" of Diet Coke from SAMs club, makes 35 gallons of soda)

review/summary: Are they kidding with the price?
review/text: Either I'm missing something and this is a double pack, which the description does not seem to support, or these people are insane.  There are loads of places to get this same product for $3.99, $4.99, even as high as $5.99.  What are they thinking?

review/summary: brings back memories
review/text: Over 70 years ago my Grampa took me to the beach almost every day., To me, highlight of the outing was when he bought us "Orange Crush" in the heavy dark brown bottle, from the vendor boy.  Back then the juice was unfiltered and there was even small bit of orange in it.  For many years I hve tried to find something to drink like the ORIGINAL OC.(to no avail)  I use my seltzer siphon and if I tinker with the amount of syrup I can get really close to perfect.  I am so glad I bought this, just great.,

review/summary: Pretty good taste; goes a long way
review/text: Contains both sugar and sucralose (Splenda), which leaves me a bit of an aftertaste. (Your mileage may vary.) Everyone else in the family likes it -- pretty good root beer taste. We don't have a "SodaStream" carbonator, but just use plain old carbonated or sparkling water to mix it. A little goes a long way, making it cheaper than most alternatives.

review/summary: Energy Drink vs Red Bull
review/text: I love this product.  I've heard alot about the Sodastream and finally decided to purchase one, and as I drink a lot of Red Bull (mainly as a cocktail mixer), I gave this mix a try.  Quite impressed on just how I can't really tell the difference between this Energy Drink Sodamix and Red Bull, other than the price.  On average I spend about $2.25 per can of Red Bull, and this Sodamix will yield 50 8oz servings, so easy math says $112 for 50 cans of Red Bull or $6.99 for the Sodastream Energy Drink Sodamix 16.9 Fl oz bottle and 50 8oz servings.  And as not to be biased, I have a few friends who also drink Red Bull who all agreed that it was a toss up on tasting the difference between the two products, and how much money could be saved.

review/summary: Energy Drink Flavor is Spot On!
review/text: I have to say that if you are a fan of the energy drink with the initials R B (moo) then you will be a HUGE fan of this. The flavor is a perfect match. I am so hooked that I will never spend a dime in the store for the name brand again.

review/summary: NASTY!!
review/text: I will never understand why they put Splenda into non-diet drinks but I can tell you that it was a horrible idea. So diet is undrinkable and so is regular. It tastes sooo awful. Maybe they'll get with the program and fire the fool that thought people would want to buy crap in a bottle.

review/summary: Great Cola Taste
review/text: The tase of this cola is better than the "REAL" cola.  I drink 1/3 of a liter of this cola and then I switch to a non-caffine cola of which I drink 2/3 of a liter daily.

review/summary: Redbull?
review/text: Someone said that it tasted like a Sprite. No it doesn't to me. Not even close in my opinion. It's a Energy Drink. It tastes more like Redbull but with a less tart flavor. I couldn't taste any after taste so that was a plus. Even if it does have Splenda in it, I don't even taste that and I don't like Splenda. It isn't my favorite flavor as I am not a fan of Redbull, but if you do then this syrup just may be for you.<br /><br />*EDIT* I just realized when I wrote that it does not taste like a Sprite the person was commenting about the Lemon Lime syrup. I apologize about that.
