review/summary: MAY BE DANGEROUS! Product developed white mold!
review/text: I bought these imported sweet potato chips because they are less than half the price of SAM'S YAMS which are my dog's favorite treats. The first bag seemed fine, but the stored bags all developed what appears to be a silvery white mold, although the expiration date is December, 2013. I have no idea if this could be dangerous to dogs, but I tossed mine out, because we have had terrible problems with food poisoning of our pets from imported ingredients.<br /><br />If anyone else has had this experience I would like to know if the white stuff is natural or is, in fact, dangerous. Thanks!

review/summary: Won't buy again
review/text: My dogs LOVE these sweet potato chews so I was excited to order them a 2 lb. bag here.  I was very disappointed when the chews came, though!  While they weren't rock hard as another reviewer stated, they are dried out and not nearly as fresh as what I can buy locally.

review/summary: Sweet Potato Review
review/text: We've tried several types of sweet potato treats but this is the best we've found so far, mainly because it's the only one our yorkie will eat:) Others are so hard/rubbery you can't even cut them with a knife. This brand is chewable for bigger dogs and tearable for our yorkie plus she loves the flavor. My only concern is that the product is made in China but the ingredients seem pure.

If I'm leaving the house, and I'm going to be gone awhile; I leave him a couple<br />treats to keep him happy for at least a little while. I've given him a mixture of this treat & that treat<br />over time. But he always/Always/ALWAYS.....picks this one out of the pile first. A perfect treat; especially<br />for a dog with either a sensitive stomach/or skin allergies. And wholesome too !!

review/summary: Healthy Veggie Dog Treat
review/text: When you are looking for a Organic Veggie Treat for your Dog. This is a very good one. It is Rubbery Veggie slice that the dog loves to chew.<br />Do not give too many in a days time or you will have a loose orange stool to take care of. So 1 or 2 a day is best. I also found that although the puppies love to chew them if you give them more than 1 a day their baby teeth/gums become painful.<br />I switched to the Sweet potato fries for my puppies to keep away from the gum/tooth pain. My adult dogs Love the chips.<br />Great change from all the other Meat-additive treats out there.

review/summary: Product may be dangerous
review/text: Healthy Pets reports that sick dogs who have eaten sweet potato snacks show symptoms similar to Fanconi syndrome, "a condition in which the tubules of the kidneys don't function properly."  According to Healthy Pets, products implicated in anecdotal accounts include:<br /><br />Beefeaters Sweet Potato Snacks for Dogs<br />Canyon Creek Ranch Chicken Yam Good Dog Treats<br />Dogswell Veggie Life Vitality<br /><br />According to Becky Lundgren, DVM, of the Veterinary Information Network, "Anecdotal reports from veterinarians indicate similar concerns about sweet potato pet treats made in China. Although no evidence is available that these sweet potato treats cause kidney issues similar to those related to chicken jerky treats, pet owners should be aware of the possibility."<br /><br />You certainly should. A prudent course of action that every shopper should take is simply looking for a "Made in China" label on any package of treats, and, if finding one, returning it to the shelf.

review/summary: Made in China!
review/text: This product deserves no stars.<br /><br />I read ingredients SO carefully. In my local pet store I decided to get my boys something different and bought them this treat. Checked the ingredients and they seemed fine. Brand is "Beefeaters USA". After a few weeks my dog was vomiting, had bloody stool, and drinking a lot of water. Five hundred dollars later after xrays and blood panels he came back cancer-free and with nothing blocking his system.<br /><br />Puzzled, I googled some of the brands of treats I was feeding them, and information on the organic dog food I feed them. Beefeaters is made in China AND is on the list of tainted dog treats. Thinking it was only chicken jerky I did not think to check.<br /><br />I learned the hard way. I will now either make their treats or make sure it is safe before buying.

review/summary: yummy treat
review/text: My little dog loves sweet potatoes, so this seemed like the perfect treat.  The 'chips' weren't what I expected, but she loves them.  The 'chips' are big slices of sweet potato, and are soft, not crunchy.  I was disappointed at first, but Misha begs for them, so that's what counts!  The slices are too big for my little girl, but cutting them into smaller sizes isn't a problem.  Will definitely order again!  It's a shame they are made in China, but I guess they are too expensive to make in America.  They are irradiated (according to the FDA - Food irradiation is the process of exposing food to ionizing radiation to destroy microorganisms, bacteria, viruses, or insects that might be present in the food.) so they are safe for our four-legged babies.

review/text: Our family dog, a 5 year old (human years) Shih Tzu didn't take to this at first. It took a good week before he would try it. After he tried it, he was all over it. He's allergic to everything so it was nice to find a treat that he could eat. We found this at Pet Smart and got the clear plastic bucket (about one pound of treats). It's lasted him about 8 months now--serving it to him about 2-3 times a week ahout 2-5 of these treats each time. We'll be getting him so more of these. He's pretty happy when he gets these.

review/summary: Highly Recommended!
review/text: This is my favorite thing to feed my 11 year old aussie for a chew.  Her canines have become pretty worn, partially because she developed a habit of chewing her way out of chain link kennels about 5 years ago (which I no longer keep her in) but also because I used to give her very hard chews when she was younger.  I still give her a chew in the evening but it is always something pretty soft.  I like the Sam's Yamz but they are pretty pricey and then I found these!  I purchased my supply from Amazon which is perhaps I didn't have the same experience as the previous reviewer with them being pretty hard. The pieces in the bag I got were very soft and chewy.  With free shipping these are a great deal and don't wear done my dog's teeth!

review/text: My dogs love these.  There a healthy alternative to the other treats out there.  The one thing with these are it softens the stool and turns it orange.  If your dog goes on the neighbor's yard that's good but we all know the pain of picking up soft poop.  I guess it all comes down to how much you love you mut.<br /><br />I only give each about 1 or 2 a day and thier fine.  If your dog likes these, then try giving them raw sweet potatoes or sweet potatoes that have been semi cooked in microwave.  My dogs eat them as it was the beef or turkey jerky.

review/text: These beans are a mix of roasts.  There seems to be some fairly light beans and some darker beans.  This is a good full bodied coffee that will stand up to drinking with buttery biscuits and sausage gravy.  My husband really liked it this morning and says it's a really good morning coffee.<br /><br />This coffee does have quite a bit of the darker roast flavor and it is not a meek coffee.  Not nearly as smoothe as the Monsooned Malabar or as rich as the Columbian Supremo.<br /><br />Frankly, I liked the Poor man's blend better, it was more complex.

review/summary: Wow! Excellent pancakes for being so easy to make
review/text: This potato pancake mix takes no time and no brains to make.  Stir the dry mix into 2 cups of water, let it sit for 2 minutes (while your frying pan heats up) and you are ready to go.  The cooking instructions say fry the pancakes for 6 minutes which struck me as rather long, but they were right - lowering the heat a bit and letting them go 3 minutes on a side produced perfect results.  Beautifully browned, crisp on the outside and tender on the inside, the pancakes retained the shredded potato texture and were neither mealy nor spongy.  Considering that they started from a dry mix, the real potato flavor and texture of these pancakes were nothing short of excellent.  The box says it makes 24 pancakes 3 inches in diameter, but I would estimate more in the neighborhood of 12 to 18.

review/text: The first time I ordered this pasta, I did not realize that it came in a gigantic bag.  I have ordered other pasta on this site that comes in the regular packaging that you get in stores.  So,  in those cases, I would receive ten little bags in a bigger bag.  But with this 11 lb order, the entire pasta order is in a single bag.  I like the environmentally friendly aspect of the bulk purchase with this bag of pasta.  For making larger batches of pasta for a family of four with left overs for the next day, this big bag is much more convenient.  I don't have to open multiple packages.  The quality of the pasta is really the same as the others.  And, when donating food, this is a great way to get more bang for the buck in terms of donation and quantity.

review/summary: Good stuff!
review/text: This pasta is simply great! I have been buying the Bionaturae Spaghetini in whole wheat for awhile now and tried one bag of this fusilli from my local store before buying this 11lb bag here on Amazon at a savings of about $1.50 per pound- not too shabby! Anyway, it is just as great as the spaghetini (like Angel Hair) and my family loves the fact that you don't get that unpleasant aftertaste that so many whole wheat pastas have with Bionaturae. I am so glad to have discovered this product. When we eat the spaghetini you cannot tell that it is not regular semolina pasta. This fusilli is more noticable but that is because it is much more dense and we had it with a light sauce as opposed to spaghetti sauce on the other. For the great nutrition and taste, this is a winner. I didn't mind the big 11lb bag, I just measure out a pound at a time and twist tie it off. I store mine in the freezer after an invasion of grain moths from some dog food and it is just fine there. Enjoy!

review/text: These chicken chips are devored daily by my 2 toy poodles. High in protein and low in fat make these healthful and senseable for weight control. They are also excellent for training, you don't have to worry about odor or staining when you keep them in your pocket. They also have an incredible storage life. Try them.

review/summary: Better Than "Cookies"
review/text: These crunchy treats are irresistable to my Coonhound and Shepherd-mix, both of whom need to watch their weight. They're dried, coin-shaped pieces of chicken: high in protein, very low in fat, and NO sugar. My dogs appreciate them at least as much as their more calorie-laden "junk food" cookies and treats. They are perfect for training treats, too. My husband has turned them into a bedtime snack ritual that they all look forward to every night.

review/text: Got Sami & Mikki started on Smokehouse Chicken Chips when they were just puppies.  Every time we left the house I told them to go to their cages ( I called it Day Care) then they would get a Chicken Chip.<br />Now all I have to do is open the container with the Chips and say "Day Care" and they are in and ready.  I do not shut them in in the daytime, but at night we go through the same routine only I say Nite Nite time and they go in and get their Chip and I do lock them in at night.  When Petsmart stopped carrying the Chicken Chips I tried several different kind of snacks - none to their liking.  Then I found them on line and have 2 happy pups again.

review/summary: Product of China may have caused my dog to become ill
review/text: I have purchased chicken chips in the past and they were not from China.  Shortly after purchasing this order my dog became sick.  I cannot say it was from this order of chicken chips but he got sick shortly after I started feeding him this order of chicken chips.  I had to pay a $500 vet bill when my dog had blood in his urine.  The vet could not determine what caused the urinary tract infection.  My sister told me to check the container to see if the product came from China, it did.  She gave me a different bag of the same product that was made in the USA. Check your packaging.

review/text: these small "all-chicken coins" are no longer being sold at my local or chain pet-stores, so i was thrilled to be able to get a large tub (fyi: smaller packages are also available, but why get a small "zip-locking" pack if you can buy a well sealing jar of them?) thru amazon! they do not stain your pockets so you can always carry a few around for your pooch, or for a nice stranger's dog that you randomly meet (i had some in a jean's pocket for >3 months, not on purpose, and they did not crumble, stain, smell, or go stale), they can be easily broken in half for a mini-dog, and my not-food-motivated boxer totally loves them! so say good-bye to all of those messy or crumbling dog treats, and spread the word: as soon as your friends (well, the ones with dogs) see you that have found them (i still do not understand why my local pet stores dropped this dog-treat line), and that their dogs like them, they'll be asking to "borrow" a handful :-)

review/text: This is the best popcorn I've ever tasted hands down. The taste is unlike anything I've had before and I was hooked after the very 1st bag! I can really tell that it's all natural, it doesn't give me stomach aches like a lot of other popcorn with junk in it does.<br /><br />I was surprised by the flavor. Usually I'm not a huge fan of rosemary, but this is mixed with the parmesan cheese and the flavors really complement eachother well. Simply amazing!<br /><br />My only gripe is that it's just "slightly" expensive for what it is. Even if the 3 pack was $1.50 less that would be appreciated.

review/text: I purchased a three pack the other day.  I loved the Parmesan & Rosemary flavor.  My 4 year old loved it too - and he is a picky eater.  It was simply delicious.  We mixed ours in a bowl and my son tried to lick the bowl clean!  : ) I look forward to trying the other flavors.

review/text: This popcorn is all the right things: organic, chemical free, but most of all, FANTASTIC tasting!!  My kids love to help "cook" by the simple process of pouring on the canola oil and flavor packet once it's done popping.  Even though we've let the kids try, on several occassions, it really is our special, after the kids are in bed, cuddle-on-the-couch, with the hubs and a glass of wine, at-home-date-night treat : )  Rosemary Parm is our fave, but they are all fantastic!!<br />We will be purchasing Quinn Popcorn as teacher gifts, this holiday season.  It's such a happy little box of love that needs to be shared!!

review/summary: The BEST popcorn you will ever eat!!
review/text: I probably should work for this company because I tell every single person I know about how fantastic ALL of their popcorn is.<br />Great flavors but this is my favorite. It is worth the money because not only does it taste fantastic but I use less than half the oil they provide so it is really not fattening.  Yummy

review/summary: Quinn popcorn
review/text: Quinn popcorn has the right idea.  Straight popcorn in a biodegradable bag with no chemicals, additives etc.  After popping the corn, flavor is added by adding oil and a flavor and shaking the bag.  It should be heavenly.  But in fact the parmesan had the consistency of flour and just coated my mouth.  And I shook that bag a lot.  I would recommend mixing everything in a bowl instead of the bag; that might help.  The idea is terrific.  However I think better results could be obtained by popping plain corn in a brown paper bag and adding fresh grated parmesan and a bit of oil.  Perhaps the other two flavors would be better but I just tried parmesan and rosemary.  It was disappointing and I so wanted to love it.

review/text: I was looking for a healthy popcorn option and unfortunately this is not that product. Fortunately, the oil and seasoning were packed separately, so the popcorn could easily be eaten without it, but you end up paying for something which is discarded. The popcorn kernels were fresh, but average in size after being popped. I will stick to the store brand in the future.

review/summary: Best New Product on the market!!
review/text: I offered this company some help through kickstarter, and was really excited to try this product.  I first off loved the packaging and the simple look to the bag.  The print was large and easy to understand and wasn't cluttered.<br /><br />The best part of this brand is that you can control how much oil and seasoning you put on the popcorn.  It may take some practice to get the timing right in your microwave to pop all without burning it.  The Parmesan and rosemary is by far the best flavor with the lemon a close second.<br /><br />The only thing I would change is the maple flavor, it needs to be sweeter or maybe a different type of maple as it has an almost cardboard flavor.<br /><br />I stopped eating other microwave popcorn a long time ago and find making it myself to be a hassle when I have a random craving.  I am seriously addicted to this now and will be buying again right now.  They need to start selling at my local grocery store soon I think!!

review/text: This is the best meat rub I have ever used!  The maple undertone really adds a taste never experienced before and a small amount on both sides is all that is needed.  It really helps hold in the moisture too.  This would be a great gift for any cook but especially those who do outdoor grilling.

review/summary: FEE BROTHERS MAKE TERRIFIC AND VARIED BITTERS!
review/text: All I can say is that I love FEE BROTHERS various beverage products.  They have an amazing line of flavored Bitters.  Bitters are terrific if you've never tried them. Most folks know only Angostura Bitters but there are a wide variety of them.  Don't think of them just for alcoholic cocktails but also for non-alcoholic beverages and drinks, sauces, salad dressings, baking and cooking applications.  My first experience with FEE BROTHERS was their Orange, Peach and Mint Bitters which I bought a few years ago.  I really enjoyed them and found them quite versatile in bar and kitchen.  The Lemon Bitters are no less terrific than the previously mentioned ones, as are the Cherry and Cranberry (which I've also tried).  There is one caution with the Lemon Bitters,...due to the action of the lemon oil in the bitters on the inside plastic "dash/dropper" cap, it becomes loose & can easily fall off when shaking drops of Bitters.  I sadly did not look before dashing a few drops into a cocktail shaker and suddenly I found a good 1/3 of the bottle in my cocktail shaker because the cap came off.  You either have to use a dropper or carefully hold the cap on the bottle when you shake a few drops.  I E-mailed FEE BROTHERS and they wrote me that they were aware of the inner cap problem and were working on it.  They then sent me a new bottle of Lemon Bitters and a complimentary bottle of their Cranberry Bitters.  I was really impressed with their promptness and thoughtfulness in sending me not only the replacement but the free bottle of the other Bitters.  Top notch product and company.

review/summary: Where's the Smoke?
review/text: OK. I was all puckered up to really like this version of smoked olive oil (I thought the one I'd been guzzling was the only one in the world!). I figured at the rate my family consumes The Smoked Olive's local brand (they literally put it on almost EVERYTHING!), it might be worth saving a couple of bucks (after shipping it wasn't so much cheaper after all). I was excited the day it came (like 10 days after my order) and got out some of my homemade, wood-fired oven baked ciabatta bread. A big sloppy dip (I like olive oil) on a hunk of bread entered my mouth and... what happened to the smoke? There wasn't a whole lot of smoke to begin with, but the initial flavor literally fell off. Like some poorly executed wines that just have no character. Yeah, I'm spoiled and prejudice living in Sonoma County where the best artisan foods are found. I guess this is a perfect example of "you get what you pay for".

review/summary: super flavor for vinaigrettes, reductions, any savory dish
review/text: This has been out of stock locally, though I keep asking for it wherever better olive oils are sold. It's a superb oil to begin with--very fresh and buttery, smooth and without any bite---but the added smoke dimension is really present; it doesn't overwhelm a sauce or dressing, but it doesn't vanish, either.<br />It's great when brushed over seared sea scallops just at the end of cooking. It marries well with citrus flavors. I've added it to a port-cherry sauce for duck breast, yum. It's good in any vinaigrette, but especially ones used with whole-grains.

The toast slice, squared shape lends itself to a sandwich eating experience. They hold up to spreading goodies on them & don't disintegrate into your lap when bitten. The taste is fresh, crisp & lightly salted. i haven't seen thesein local stores.Well done product!

They're better than any other rice cake I've eaten, and I've tried 3 other brands.  These are thinner and more dense.  My boyfriend even likes them.  :)  They're slightly salty, but the nutrition information is the same as for the other varieties of Suzie's.  This was my favorite flavor.  :)  I eat them like giant potato chips.

review/text: These seasonings (other flavors: Sicilian & Tuscany) there is also a Parmasan blend, but the first 3 are my personal favorites, are absolutely DELICIOUS!!! They are also very versatile, you can have them with olive oil for bread dipping or better yet, use them to cook chicken, ground turkey burgers, fish, just about anything you can think of. I've tried a few other seasonings at the supermarket but they are waste of money, you get a lot more seasoning and a TON more delicious flavor with the Dean Jacob's seasoning collection.

review/summary: Somewhat bland/sweet
review/text: I was attracted to this item for its low sodium content (2 T solids = 1 cup broth = 20 mg sodium). Has a sweet taste due to the corn syrup solids that are the first listed ingredient. I wanted to use this to saute vegtetables without oil and as a soup base, but the sweetness will limit its use for that. I'll be looking for another low sodium alternative or perhaps, making my own powdered herb/vegetable base when I get ambitious.

review/summary: RATHER HAVE THE SALT THAN THE SUGAR .
review/text: I thought this item would be a good addition to try on the diet I've been following.  I was looking for a low sodium, vegetable flavor.  The brand I usually use DOES make a vegetable flavor, but not in the low sodium variety.  I have not opened the package of Frontier as yet.  I was not happy after reading the label.  The first ingredient listed on the label is, "Corn Syrup Solids."  There is a carbohydrate content, a sugar content and a relatively high calorie content, comparatively speaking.  My usual brand has about 10 calories per serving. Frontier's has a calorie content of 60 per serving.  Frontier website states, "Frontier Natural Products Co-op specializes in natural and organic products."  I did not expect to get sugar in their soup product, albeit a less sweeter one.  Lower dextrose, nevertheless is still sugar.  If you look on their website, this is what Frontier states about the product:  " Vegetable Flavored Broth Powder, Low Sodium  - Use this rich flavor blend of tomato, onion, garlic, carrot, basil, celery seed, kelp, parsley, spinach, turmeric and bay for soups, rice and pasta. Pure, natural taste-without fillers, hidden ingredients, artificial flavors, preservatives or colors. "  DOES ANYONE SEE CORN SYRUP SOLIDS LISTED, HERE? :( DISAPPOINTED and didn't even taste it, yet! Not what I was expecting.
