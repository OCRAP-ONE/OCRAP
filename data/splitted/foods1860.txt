review/summary: Excellent product!
review/text: While I buy many items from Amazon both because of price and convenience, this particular product is substantially overpriced. Jif Natural is available at WalMart for $5.98 per jar ($11.96 for 2) which makes it less than half as much as Amazon is charging. Jif Natural is an excellent peanut butter, both in flavor and consistency. It does not require stirring or refrigeration, and it does not contain an overabundance of preservatives. I highly recommend it for all you other peanut butter lovers ... just not at this price!

review/summary: Fantastic White Truffle Flavor
review/text: Many olive oils say they are "truffle infused", but they really just taste like regular olive oil. This stuff is the real deal. You can really taste the white truffles. It is a little expensive, but I think well worth the splurge and you don't really need to use that much since the flavor is strong. I used to buy this at a specialty store in Manhattan when I lived there, but now living up in Waterford I can't buy it in stores. Now I get it on Amazon. The shipping and handling is expensive. I wish that were less.

review/summary: Cheap, nutritional, but not vegan.
review/text: I was shopping around for nutritional yeast, and based on the price and the reviews I found online, I decided to go with this brand.  It is definitely packed with nutrients and is a great source of many vitamins and minerals.  It's flavor is good, although this is the first nutritional yeast I've bought, so I can't compare it to other brands.  The smell upon first opening the jar seemed a bit strong, but it wasn't as bad after using it and opening/closing the jar a few times.<br /><br />I am mostly writing this review to let other potential customers know that this product is NOT VEGAN.  I guess everyone defines veganism a little differently, but this nutritional yeast contains whey from milk, so if you don't want to eat dairy, or can't for some health reason, you should be aware of that before you purchase it.  I will quote the ingredients list from another website:<br /><br />"Other Ingredients: Nutritional yeast, calcium carbonate, whey (from milk), magnesium carbonate, potassium phosphate monobasic, choline bitartrate, niacinamide, potassium chloride, d-calcium pantothenate, para aminobenzoic acid, bromelain, GTF chromium yeast, inositol, cyanocobalamin, ferrous sulfate, selenium yeast, papain, pyridoxine hydrochloride, thiamin mononitrate, riboflavin, sodium chloride, zinc sulfate, manganese sulfate, biotin, folic aicd, potassium iodide."<br /><br />This is the same as what is on my jars' labels.  You can get the entire nutritional facts and ingredients from the Twinlab website [...]  It's a nice product at a reasonable price in a large quantity.  In fact, it's going to take me a while to go through two pounds of it (how much yeast can a guy eat?).  When I finally do finish it, I won't be ordering again due to the dairy, but if that doesn't bother you, I would actually recommend this product as it seems to be a good deal.  I gave it four stars because the dairy thing was really my fault.  I should have done some more research of my own.<br /><br />Happy shopping.

review/summary: Power-Packed Nurtition
review/text: Brewers yeast is loaded with many essential nutrients.  It is packed with nutrition.  I especially love this Yeast Plus product as it is even more loaded with vitamins and minerals.  Brewers yeast is not something to write home about as far as taste goes.  So, I mix a heaping tablespoon into my smoothie every time I make one which is several times a week.  That covers up the taste.  I especially take this product because it is loaded with B vitamins and potassium.  Though brewers yeast is not great tasting, another advantage of this product over others is that it seems to have a much milder flavor.  Sure, it's not ice cream, but it will do a whole lot more to benefit your health and well-being.

review/text: I'd give it three and a half stars, couldn't decide between 3 and 4.<br /><br />I use a lot of nutritional yeast, mostly for popcorn flavoring. The taste of this one isn't my favorite. It is a rather strong taste, but I'm glad to have it for variety. Good value for the money.<br /><br />It is a dense powder. Most of them are light and flaky. This means I can keep a lot more in a small container at work.

review/text: This is the first time I tried this yeast, and since I liked it, ordered another one. It is quite powdery and not flaky. It has a strong smell I'm not used to with yeast, but I like it nonetheless. We use it on popcorn and in soups and (as hippie as this sounds) put it on our fried tofu with soy sauce. I trust Twinlab and that is why I was willing to try it.

review/summary: Who expected to find milk products in "nutritional yeast"?
review/text: TwinLab super rich yeast had RAVING fan reviews; and looked to me like it would be the right choice.<br />I am on a totally vegan diet for personal health reasons, and "nutritional yeast" is a frequent ingredient in vegan recipe books.<br />...Imagine my disappointment when i received the product (Amazon really is Amazin' at fast shipping), pulled out the product, and tried a taste.<br />Something didn't seem right.  A closer look at the ingredients told me why.<br />The third ingredient is "whey (from milk)".<br />Egad, boys and girls! THAT's NOT VEGAN!<br /><br />Well, I'm not blaming anyone but myself.<br />I lapsed my habit of reading the label before buying, and did so at the wrong time.<br />And I will find the "nutritional yeast" of my dreams; oh, yes I will.<br />I know you are out there somewhere; and I shall not rest until I have found you.

review/summary: A very good middle-of-the-road blend for those who just want a plain old cup of coffee...
review/text: The Caribou Blend k cups have fulfilled our household's need for a plain old cup of coffee in the morning that isn't anything fancy, but still gets the job done. We were searching for a blend that was smooth and flavorful while still being easy to drink and mild. I particularly like medium roasts and I don't care for a coffee with a lot of acidity and a bitter aftertaste, so this one fits the bill.<br /><br />The only downside to this k cup is that the aroma. It wasn't the most appetizing after the first cup was brewed, but it made up for that in taste. This isn't a point that really bothers me, but I could see it being a downside for some people.<br /><br />When I brew this blend on my way out the door, I often throw in some french vanilla creamer and it's my perfect morning caffeine kick.<br /><br />So far this is the best average blend we've tried. We're open to others but until we find something better, we're sticking with the Caribou Blend.

review/summary: YUMMMMMM!!  Great gummy!
review/text: My son and I are both big fans of gummy candies. He had proclaimed his favorite as<br />the blue sharks, such as these. I'd had them before too, and while I loved the blue<br />raspberry flavor (yes, in my 50's, blue raspberry is still one of my favorite flavors!),<br />I'd always found the sharks to be TOO gummy - more stiff, thick and not very easy to chew,<br />sort of like chewing on a thumb-sized eraser.<br /><br />He wanted these anyway, so we ordered a 5 lb bag. How big a risk could it really be, after all?<br />If they were horrible, we'd just never order them from here again.<br /><br />Well, they were GREAT!!<br />Without a doubt, we received the freshest gummy candy we'd ever had! The smell alone when opening<br />the bag was wonderful. Then the taste... super fruity and easy to bite. Each shark was super soft,<br />super fresh and tasty. I am almost ashamed that the four of us went through this 5 lb bag in a fairly<br />short amount of time! They were so much better than expected that we "foundered" on them. It was hard<br />to stop eating them.<br /><br />Fresh, fruity, tasty - sharks have moved up the scale to be one of my favorite gummies now too.<br />As long as the sellers keep providing such fresh snacks, we'll keep buying!

review/summary: BEWARE this can ruin your diet!
review/text: These shark gummies are the tastiest and most addictive I have ever eaten. I loved them from the start and was consuming them from the time I awoke to going to bed! I had just given up smoking, and these were the most wonderful replacement ever! I am dribbling now thinking about them. But, just one taste and I shall be eating a 5lb bag a week again!<br /><br />Yipes! I put on 10 lbs in weight in a month! That would have increased if I had not weaned myself off the gummies. The worms are terrific, so are the cherries, but these shark gummies, too wonderful to describe! But, very dangerous!

review/summary: Additonal Info on this product
review/text: Not to be a negative review, but adding some information I learned on this product that I feel should be on the product description for buyers. The information on the package states that the fries should not be given to small dogs. Well, we have a 10# Maltese small dog. Seller was very quick to respond to my question on this, saying that the product is like jerky and should be cut into smaller bits for small dogs. Well, I tried to cut it into smaller pieces, but it is tough stuff. Also, the product is from China. Not a surprise as lots of stuff from China. Other sweet potato fries at local store are from China also. And they say sweet potato jerky on package. I elected to ask Amazon for a refund and they were very prompt to issue a refund. I will go back to my local store and buy the treats I had purchased; the sweet potato fries were soft and moist and no problem for our small dog. These would probably work fine with a larger dog and be no problem for dog to eat.

review/summary: Best NY Pickles I've had in Decades!
review/text: Having grown up in NYC and remembering my trips to the lower east side with my dad, walking through the streets to find The Pickle Man, who sat outside his tiny store with several barrels filled with pickles. We'd approach and my dad would say something to him, he'd hand me a pickle, I would take that crunchy bite, the saltiness, the sour, rich aromatic flavors would explode and I would just say "mmmmmm" and that's all my dad wanted to hear, as he spoke in Yiddish to the man in the black clothes and made a motion towards that particular barrel. Shortly thereafter, we'd leave with a shopping bag, several glass jars filled with pickles and pickle juice. That's what I saw in my mind's eye as I took my first byte of McClure's Garlic Dill Pickles. I am hooked! And I feel like I am "home" every time I have one!

Olive pickles, but they are definitely priced at a premium.<br /><br />My father purchased these in Michigan, and I figured I would write a review.

review/text: This rack of lamb cooked up beautifully and tasted terrific (with a whole lot of herbal rub plastered all over it) but it was just WAYYYYY too fatty.  The amount of grease coming off of it astounded me. I did let it rest on a rack after cooking it so I could eliminate a lot of the grease but there was a whole lot more on the meat itself.  I chaulked it up to a really nasty, fatty, horrendous meal that I allow myself to eat once a year because it really does taste great but is just so unhealthly to ingest. Usually I reserve this once a year deadly treat for eating fried clams .... but......not this year.  I will not ever be buying nor recommending this lamb product!

review/summary: Nice Mild & Sweet Cinnamon
review/text: This is a good mild and sweet ceylon cinnamon.<br />Anyways, i'm using it to lower blood sugar, i'm not diabetic but i'm trying to loose weight and by lowering blood sugar it helps regulate the insulin levels. A teaspoon of cinnamon a day lowered my blood sugar levels after eating a meal, i simply sprinkle it on my food or mix it in, it's mild enough that i sometimes don't even notice it's on my toast etc.<br />Higher insulin levels lead to less use of excess blood sugar (and sugar is stored in the body as fat), so a reduction in insulin after a meal is significant. If cinnamon can help control the level of blood sugar and, by offshoot, fat levels, then that is corroboration of what some have said regarding its weight loss potential.

review/text: I adore cinnamon and try different types and sources. Sadly, this cinnamon is tasteless. It is extremely dry [which I assume means it has very little actual "oil" in it]. Moreover, its texture is actually unpleasant. It feels as through the cinnamon bark has been "cut" with some tasteless, dry filler. Oddly, there is a mild clove aftertaste to this brand. That is not unpleasant but I prefer the spicy flavor of Saigon cinnamon, but that is a personal choice. I can't recommend this particular Ceylon cinnamon. Sorry.

review/text: I bought a pound of this a year and a half ago to use for baking and to sprinkle on my morning oatmeal.  It arrived quite fresh, unlike bottled spices, but the flavor is inherently less hot than the grocery store cinnamon I've always used.  I can use a lot more cinnamon at a time, but to get enough flavor I need to use at least a little more. My one-pound purchase is almost gone. I've decided that I like buying bulk cinnamon but next time, I'll get the hotter kind.

review/summary: pretty good yogurt sauce...
review/text: ...but the grand total of 3.5 tiny pakora contained within the sauce were dense, sort of tough. If you find something else to add to the sauce, you might have a decent dish - the sauce is tasty, though a bit thinner than I would expect.<br /><br />There are at least three problems I see. The pakora (traditionally, a fried dumpling of gram (say, chickpea)) flour are too few... except for the 2nd problem, that they aren't very good. So - less is better? Anyway, over 2/3 of the pouch was sauce. But, I don't think anyone will feel slighted by less of *these* pakora. And, thicken the yogurt sauce... water is relatively cheap in such small quantities - even when you ship it across the planet. Bottom line, the product is hugely water.<br /><br />All-in-all, I don't think this product was well thought out and it underperforms.

review/summary: Really works!
review/text: I stumbled upon this drink while in my local Ralphs store. I was just looking for some different sort of energy drink. Before lunch a few days later at work, I was exhausted, to the point of basically falling asleep in my chair. I drank this along with my lunch without thinking about it. That was around 12:30 PM. When four o' clock hit, I suddenly realized I had gone almost four hours since having lunch and still felt very energized. Now, while my normal lunch (with a Gatorade or soda) will energize me, its effects last a maximum of an hour. So without even thinking about the fact that I was drinking an energy drink (the packaging does not really look like an energy drink, after all), I completely felt its effects for hours. I'm fairly certain this is not just some placebo effect, either.<br /><br />Oh, it also tastes nice, nothing like your typical energy drink. I've since signed up for Amazon's auto-order, to receive a case of this stuff every three months, though I may bump that up to once every one or two months since it's so effective!

review/summary: A Light and Delicious Snack
review/text: I have always loved cheese puffs but finding the perfect one was difficult.<br /><br />Cheeto's "Dangerously Cheesy" Cheese Puffs were disgusting. I do not think their "cheese" is even real cheese. I wanted something plainer and healthier for myself.<br /><br />I have tired smaller companies but they always ended getting bankrupt or discontinuing their plaining cheese puffs.<br /><br />Finally, I tried Smart Puffs from my local supermarket. I was a little skeptical; they were so cheap! When I got home and popped one in my mouth, I was so surprised each puff was lightly covered in cheese. Each puff was not completely crunchy; they sort of slowly melt in your mouth as you chew!<br /><br />I will definitely recommend anyone who looking for a healthy snack alternative this product.<br /><br />Pros:<br />A healthy snack<br />Lightly covered in cheese<br />Delicious, too!<br /><br />Cons:<br />It is so hard to put down a bag!

review/summary: A Mouthful of air
review/text: This is a snack that I can't find in our local markets.  I ordered a case of puffs from amazon.com on a whim.  Shoping for food online was a first for me. When this huge box arrived my wife and I couldn't believe the size of it.  We had a good laugh unpacking 24 bags of Smart Puffs and ate one bag full right away.  The puffs tasted quite good and with the reasonably healthful ingredients they contain we did not feel guilty eating them.<br /><br />The puffs have a pleasant natural cheese taste.  However, eating Gourmet Smart Puffs is a somewhat startling experience. Pop a couple of the puffs into your mouth chew a few times and it feels like a crunchy mouthful of cheesy air.  Is that strange or what?<br /><br />I think I would like a bit more substance to my snacks, but I guess one can't have it all and still remain reasonably healthy.  Smart puffs do not seem like junk food.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, your fingers do not get all yellow eating Smart Puffs.  I have ordered my second case of Robert's Smart Puffs.

review/summary: Like Cheese Jax not Cheetos
review/text: I was expecting the Cheetos like snacks that are in the Chaos mix (which is quite yummy), but that's not what these are.  They are thick and airy like Jax, not hard a crunchy like Cheetos.  They taste good, but if you're looking for crunchy, this isn't it.<br /><br />Does anyone know if they sell the Cheetos like stuff that's in Chaos by itself?

If you get the junk food craving, snacking on Smart Puffs Real Wisconsin Cheddar Puffs will satisfy your craving without too much guilt.<br /><br />These little gems are baked, not fried, and taste so good when popped into your mouth. Kind of salty, kind of cheesy, and just plain delicious.<br /><br />Highly recommend.

review/summary: Tastes good but DEVIOUS Nutritional Information
review/text: Yes, I do like the taste of these cheese puffs.  Enough said about taste.  Here's the issue -->  Get a bag, look at the nutritional information and ask yourself "How many calories are in a bag of these puffs?"  Your initial answer will likely be 140 calories as that is what is printed on the bag of "about 1" servings.  In actuality, the bag is 1 3/8 oz or 1.375 oz.  So, there is over 190 calories in a bag which is more that 1/3 more calories than what you observe via a fast look at the nutritional info on the bag.  I consider this devious at the very least.  Now, is that not so SMART or what??

I've never received any other damaged products from Amazon, so I made the mistake of ordering the chips again, thinking it was a fluke. Evidently not. Will not buy these from Amazon again.

review/summary: Possibly the best Pirate Brands product.
review/text: I've bought everything Pirate Brands has made (except for Potato Flyers) and this one is probably the best overall. My wife and I can't stop eating these. They're simply awesome. Very cheesy, good texture, very easy to chew, no greasy/oily aftertaste or residue on your hands, just precious cheese dust! We like mixing these up with other cheese snacks (pirate booty, gold fish crackers, etc) and pretzels for a nice custom snack mix. These are sure to please anyone that likes cheese curls, just don't tell whoever you give them to that they are more healthy than normal cheese puffs and they'll never know the difference!

review/summary: Pretty good for a 'healthy' snack, but not great
review/text: The best thing about these is the smell when you first open the bag - pure white cheddar goodness.  Too bad they don't taste like that.  The first few are good, but when I ate more than 5 or 6 'puffs', I got an acidic taste in my mouth.  At that point, most of the cheddar flavor went away.  If you're ok with eating one small handful of these, by all means, buy away - you'll be pleased.  Otherwise, they're just ok, not great.  At least they're not as bad for you as other snacks of this type.

review/summary: good alternative  snack
review/text: while no junk food or snack food is actually good for us...this one comes close to being satisfying for a salty snack with lots of  cheesy taste but without the strange ingredients of the other popular cheese puff brands.  I like them.  Light and they  do not upset the system with additives and colorings.  A little too addictive with all the salt but if you can be disciplined this is a good alternative when you simply must have something crunchy and salty to eat.  I would buy them again.  No orange fingers and no weird carb feeling after eating them.

review/summary: Smart Puffs Real Wisconsin Cheddar
review/text: Boy was I dissapointed in these babies.  I thought that they would taste like an actually puff, but they tasted like nothing, honestly. I love pirates booty, that is my favorite and one that I am going to stick to.  These taste like a very very weark version of pirates booty, no flavor to speak of at all and not worth the money.  So I would buy a bag at a store first to try before purchasing online in a large amount.  Dont expect much flavor or anything form this snack, unless your into eating flavorless food.

review/text: For me - these are great - they're light and crunchy without the bright orage residue of others.  My baby loves these (she's not been spoiled by others kinds) and my older boys don't care for them.  they prefer other kinds of chips.  I think if you start them very young or try them later once the kids are old enough to grasp the idea of nutrition - they'll be a big hit.  I personally prefer the taste of these over other brands and other types of salty, crunchy snacks.
