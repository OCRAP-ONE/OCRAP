review/summary: So Good That You'll Wonder Where They Went
review/text: Tostitos with lime used to be my favorite tortilla chip. Corazonas now is. This is partly because I like Corazonas taste better, and partly because I don't want to have to pick up 6 bags of chips from a store every month when it can get delivered right to you.<br /><br />If you know that you like "hint of lime" type chips you won't be disappointed by these, they're a great kind of dipping chip. If you want the added benefit of a "heart healthy" chip, Corzonas is your choice. I eat them with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FAGWZC">Fischer & Wieser Salsa A La Charra, 17.5-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)</a> and they're great, but it's just a personal preference.<br /><br />I expect these chips to spend some time on my subscribe & save list. I agree with the other reviewer though, they get gobbled up way too quickly!

review/summary: The Ultimate Tortilla Chip!
review/text: These T-chips are 'finestkind'...light, fresh, flavorful, and healthy, to boot. Dip these things in some chilled salsa verde and you'll be well on yer way. The only suggestions I would offer are to tone-down the lime a bit, possibly use a key lime, and to lighten-up on the salt. Incidentally, someone wrote in about the problem of a few crushed chips in their shipment...hey, "no hay problema"...isn't that why The Great Spirit created chili?

review/summary: THANKS AMAZON!!!
review/text: I've been reading through some amazon reviews concerning groceries, because honestly I was a bit hesitant to order food online. Some of the reviews were really bad, saying that they received open packages blah blah, others were of satisfied customers. I went with the latter and ordered, and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />My first box of Anna's thins was purchased at IKEA cause they are swedish cookies, and I fell in love with them. They are the perfect cookie for me. They are so thin (meaning less calories!) and bursting with flavor. The Chocolate mint is my favorite! They use good cocoa and real peppermint oil! Nothing artificial. And the price is perfect at Amazon with free shipping!!! I received the box is perfect condition with all the individual boxes inside ALSO in perfect condition. So I have to say I will be ordeing more groceries from Amazon. I highly recommend this cookie it's very well balanced, and not icky sweet, just right.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: Cookies delicious; packing the WORST!
review/text: I have been a fan of Anna's cookies for years and the ginger have long been my favorites, so when I saw this price I jumped.  Too fast.  The shipment arrived in about 10 days (awfully slow for such a huge company, IMO) - cookies appeared to be well-packed in their own little case.  However we opened them to find that each and every box, of twelve, contained cookie crumbles.  Not one single cookie in shipment arrived unscathed; OK, I guess, to crumble on ice cream, etc. - but definitely not what we'd wanted.  Returning all 12 today; we'll see how Amazon handles that.

review/summary: yes they really are THIN.... and tasty, even as crumbles.
review/text: Yes, some of the thin crackers are broken, but it was obviously not due to Amazon's shipping-- the box containing the crackers was thoroughly wrapped in bubblewrap which was carefully packed with other packing material in a larger box.  A few of the crackers at one end of each 5.25 ox box are broken, but they taste just as good as the whole ones.  Very nicely gingery.  Not, to be frank, as gingery as Trader Joe's "Triple Ginger Thins", but TJ's does not ship, and the closest one to Miami is in Atlanta... so these will do quite nicely.  I've signed up for a subscription.

They apparently fought the whole way to our house, and the Gummi Bears won! They don't call them "thins" for nothing you know. The packing job was not the best, and many of the thins had turned into crumbs. Time for a chocolate pie crust I guess.

review/text: I was craving my absolute favorite GS cookie in October and went on a desperate search for a possible equivalent. What I have discovered in these delicious thin wafers is amazing. Defying all appearances, OMG these are soooooo good. I won't mourn for GS cookie season any more. These are wonderful "consolation," and now I'll buy the GS simply to support GS. I have no trouble believing that these were originally created for a King, as the box says. Don't be alarmed; they look dry and thin in the classic European manner of visual understatement. They taste MARVELLOUS, but no one steals them because they LOOK -- eh -- blah. But in the mouth -- AAAAAAH -- they melt into a perfectly balanced, luxurious mint chocolate that I now crave on an ongoing basis. Not just good, they're OMG good!

Each cookie is delicate and deliciously crunchy. The ginger flavor is mild and there is a hint of cinnamon and cloves. They remind me of cookies I once found in Holland. Although these are made in Canada from a Swedish recipe. These may contain peanuts, milk powder, whey and lactose. So if you have allergies - beware!

review/summary: Best ginger thins next to homemade~
review/text: As a kid, I had neighbors from Sweden, and the wife would always make ginger thins for me and her kids every Friday after school. After her husband died and she moved back to Sweden, I never really ate any cookies as good as hers. The ginger snaps that come in the big brown bag taste alright, but just too hard. I found this brand at a Walgreens about a week ago and I'M IN LOVE. I just wish they came in a bigger box~ I haven't ordered them from this seller yet. The cookies are very fragile. I could almost bet that I would have a box of powder by the time they arrived. For anyone looking to buy this brand, try looking around locally. If not in a typical store (like for example Walgreens, Winn Dixie, any other grocery store), try looking for the nearest European market. There's one near me where I buy my Lion Bars from, so there may be a different brand of ginger thins there.<br /><br />&lt;...><br /><br />Good luck~!

I've tried some other flavors but the Cappuccino flavor is my favorite by far. Since our local store often runs out of this flavor, I was thrilled to find them available here through Amazon. (Also, I rarely buy "store-bought" cookies, "snob that I am", since my mother spoiled me w/her delicious homemade, (truly homemade, never anything from a mix), baking of cookies, pies, cakes, breads,etc. I, literally, never walked through the door without the aroma of freshly baked bread, cookies, etc. I admit it---I was the envy of the neighborhood for having a mother like that. Of course, I took it for granted & couldn't have imagined anything else!) Anyway, I hope you enjoy these yummy cookies too!

review/summary: A COOKIE not a CANDY
review/text: This is a tasty product, but the label can be misleading. It is a thin chocolate COOKIE and not a thin chocolate mint CANDY.<br /><br />Each box has the cookies wrapped in a sleeve, which once opened will require the cookies to be stored in another container to maintain freshness.<br /><br />Since they are thin, these cookies can't take rough handling. They break easily.

review/summary: Best Ginger Snaps in the World
review/text: Anna's Ginger Thins are so good that, once we discovered them, we started buying them by the case!  These cookies have a wonderful ginger taste and they go great with hot tea or coffee.  They are very thin, as the name implies, so they are easy to bite into and they almost dissolve in your mouth. If you like ginger snaps or ginger cookies of any sort, you owe it to yourself to try Anna's Ginger Thins.  You will love them, and your guests, if they are lucky enough to have you share them, will rave about the great cookies you serve with your tea or coffee.  Buy some and enjoy!

review/summary: Chocolate lovers take note
review/text: These chocolate thins can be used in many ways. The cookies are great just as they are, but also good crushed into a good vanilla ice cream, or used instead of graham crackers in a pie crust. Amazon seems to have a packaging problem as some of them arrive crushed - that is the drawback.

I'm very pleased with my "double order" of Anna's cookies from Amazon--which I must confess are just about half gone. I'll definately look to Amazon for futher orders of Anna's Thin Ginger cookies. Because I was so delighted with the first box of cookies I tried, I wrote to the email address on the box requesting the name of markets in this area.  The reply I recieved from the staff at Anna's in B.C. told me about Amazon.  Many Thanks for this amazing treat.  I would highly recommend it to anyone. I especially love these cookies with Marzcapone (Italian cream cheese).

review/summary: Loving them.
review/text: These are great! They aren't quite ice cream, but that doesn't bother me. My local health food stores carry it for a lot less. I like them best frozen solid, as they seem gummier a bit melted.<br /><br />My favorite is coffee, similar in flavor to Blue Bells.<br /><br />The strawberry is great, too and is most like real ice cream. It has some strawberry in it and a soft texture without being gummy.<br /><br />Chocolate tastes like a plain, barely sweet fudgesicle.<br /><br />The choc peanut butter is like a salted version of the chocolate.<br /><br /> The vanilla maple is a sweet icy treat, but does not resemble vanilla ice cream, although I really like it.<br /><br />The mint choc cookie (no cookies in it, just flavored) does taste like "thin mints" although it is not very sweet. All three chocolate ones are only eaten a few bites at a time by me.<br /><br />The cookies and cream is a bit of a flop. It looks strange and tastes like a chocolate-like version of the vanilla. I probably won't get that one again.<br /><br />Some markets still have the older versions which are different recipes. The chocolate is gummier and less sweet than the new, and the strawberry banana (now just strawberry) is okay, but so much better without banana (even though I like banana).<br /><br />I haven't been one to eat more than a half pint at a time, but you certainly could with whichever flavors you really like.<br /><br />I will be stocking up on Coffee, Strawberry, and Vanilla Maple, and buying the others if they are out of them or I get bored. While several stores near me have it, they don't have every flavor.

review/summary: Great for Dieting, Needs work on Available Options at Quantity Pricing
review/text: I have recently been on the Optifast medical weight management program, and a full pint resembles protein-calorie levels of one of the RTD meals or powdered shakes. If you opt for the 1/2 cup serving size, you can add some Walden Farms calorie free topping <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RVEJEE">"Walden Farms Chocolate Syrup, Sugar Free, Calorie Free, Gluten Free, Carb Free, Fat Free, 1 oz. individual package"</a>  (caramel is my favorite, but chocolate and marshmallow work) and add some fruit or nuts and have a very reasonable diet-worthy snack that does not feel lacking in any way. The initial taste impression does not say 'ice-cream', but if you let it soften, the mouth texture and taste are good, and it is dense enough to fill you up! I am a convert. I have gone through a 10-pack in about 3 weeks, and my only complaint is this: I would like a low-price online option (the 10-pack pricing, at about $5.60 a pint is reasonably low) where I can select what flavors comprise my 10 pack. I would probably get 3 coffee, 3 peanut butter chocolate, 3 maple vanilla and 1 strawberry in my ideal assortment. Hopefully, Amazon will offer better variety at quantity pricing, or my local Whole Foods Market or Lunardi's market will start offering more flavors.

review/summary: Send That Skinny Cow To The Slaughter House!
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 2:21 Mins<br /><br /></span>After seeing this product online and checking out so many positive reviews about it, I was eager to try it myself. But more than hesitant to spend $37 to $60+ bucks in order to do so. Luckily, Arctic Zero is carried in stores not too far from me. I had to drive about 30miles to the neighboring town in order to get it, but it was well worth the trip!<br /><br />I bought a pint each of chocolate, chocolate peanut butter, mint chocolate cookie, coffee, and vanilla maple. Packed them in the iced cooler I brought with me and headed back home. Once back I sampled each of the flavors. The first one I tried was the peanut butter chocolate. Tasted pretty good, but I didn't detect a whole lot of peanut flavor going on. It also had a fairly icy consistency. After tha, I tried the chocolate and was thoroughly impressed! Maybe it was because the chocolate pint wasn't as steeped in the ice as the other had been in my cooler, but this time the texture was creamy like any other ice cream. And it had a great chocolate flavor. I honestly could have eaten the whole thing right then, but wanted to see what the others were like, so went on to mint chocolate. This too had a fairly subtle flavor as far as the mint went, which I guess some might appreciate. But the texture was just as creamy as the chocolate had been. The coffee was icy and my least favorite flavor. But I'm historically not a coffee person so it may just be a personal preference. Maple vanilla wasn't bad either, but again, I could take it or leave it. So after tasting them all, I wanted to find out if the icy consistency of some of them was a product trait or was just letting it soften a bit the key to creaminess heaven. So I let the coffee sit out for a couple of minutes, and sure enough it was as creamy as the chocolate had been.<br />I'd say depending on your taste preferences any of them would be completely satisfying as replacements for their fattening counter parts....I would serve this to anyone and dare them to know the difference from reg. ice cream. And the fact that the whole pint has the same 150 cal. as those teeny tiny skinny cow cups, not to mention less sugar(it actually has less in the whole pint than skinny cow does in it's little cup) and zero fat, I'm definitely a convert.<br />I also really like the fact that it has some health benefits too, with the added protein and fiber. And that while I will probably try to eat this sparingly as it's pretty expensive, if I ever want to pig out, I can eat the whole thing guilt free! Which is a new concept when it comes to ice cream. I actually had to keep reminding myself while I was sampling them; "It's okay!" LOL!<br /><br />Edit; If your Arctic Zero hardens up in the freezer, I found you can get it back to a creaminess state by just popping it in the microwave for about 10-15sec depending on how hard it is to start with. That amount of time didn't cause it to melt on me just go from hard and icy back to smooth and spoon-able while remaining cold.

review/text: I recently ordered the 10-pack so I could try all of the flavors after reviewing the positive reviews here.  After trying it myself, I can say I am very disappointed.  The texture is more like frozen yogurt and the flavor is a cross between lowfat yogurt and frozen no-fat milk.  There is nothing creamy in the flavor. I would suggest just blending it up as a smoothie.  It definitely didn't satisfy my urge for ice cream.  If you want to try it yourself, the best flavor is the vanilla maple.  It comes the closest to tasting like it's in the ball park of ice cream.

However, you cannot eat this stuff without a chisel to get it out of the carton.  The flavor is is just so-so.  But, the biggest drawback is that it is the consistancy of ice cream that has thawed and been refrozen.  I won't be buying this again!

I am on weight watchers and it is great way to take care of that craving for ice cream.  I have tried the flavors I have been able to find in the stores locally.  Strawberry, Vanilla Maple, Coffee, and Chocolate Mint.  I wasn't crazy about the Chocolate Mint, probably because I don't care for mint.  The other flavors I like.  It freezes harder than ice cream so I have found if I sit it out for about 20 minutes before I want it the consistency is more creamy and most like ice cream.  Wish that we had more flavors locally.  I would love to try the Chocolate Peanut Butter.

review/summary: For 150 calories?  Oh, yeah.
review/text: Is this exactly like ice cream?  No.  But, c'mon... for 150 calories?  It's close enough.  One thing that surprised me is that I sat down with every intention of eating the whole pint and getting my 150 calories worth, but found that after just 1/4 or 1/2 of a pint (depending on my mood), I - or rather, my sweet tooth - was satisfied.  Hard to pick a favorite but the Maple Vanilla surprised me with how very good it is.  The coffee is great and the chocolate hits the spot when that's what you're craving.  The Mint Chocolate Cookie tastes like a Girl Scout Thin Mint.<br /><br />One tip... to make it a bit more like ice cream, let it sit out a few minutes and soften up some.  It can be a bit like sorbet or an icy kind of milk when straight from the freezer, but letting it soften up definitely makes it seem creamier.

review/summary: Great Substitute
review/text: No. These are not ice cream. They are not frozen yogurt, either. The creaminess is missing. BUT since I lost 50 pounds on WW, I am all for substitutes. I will not complain when someone comes out with an ingenious product that has barely any calories per serving, tastes pretty amazing, and curbs the sweet tooth craving. After a little experimenting, I also figured out that (since this product is rock hard) if you microwave it for about 15 seconds, it can become pretty creamy instead of like eating ice (which some have complained about). The consistency becomes a little closer to the "real deal" - like ice cream. Finding low calorie items to throw on top (like PB2, fruit, or Truvia with cinnamon) can turn it up a notch, as well as using it with frozen bananas,agave,and raw cocoa for a low cal milk shake!

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I was somewhat worried about getting ice cream in the mail, but that was my only option, as Artic Zero is not sold in any of my local stores. It arrived in one day and was well packaged with Styrofoam and dry ice. Even though it was a hot summer day, the product arrived fully frozen.<br /><br />If you are expecting Artic Zero to taste like like gourmet ice cream that has 1000+ calories a pint, then you will probably be disappointed. It's not truly ice cream, but a protein shake in the form of a frozen treat.  If you are concerned about sticking to a healthy diet and like the idea of indulging in an occasional frozen treat that only has 150 calories a pint (not to mention zero fat, low carbs, and high protein) then you will probably enjoy Artic Zero. Others have complained that Artic Zero is somewhat icy and too hard to eat. It is if you eat it straight from the freezer. If you put the entire pint into the microwave on high for about 15-20 seconds, this gives it a soft and creamy consistency that is very much like ice cream.<br /><br />I like all the flavors that come in this six-pack, especially the Mint Chocolate Cookie and the Vanilla Maple. The mint flavor is heavy on the chocolate and light on the mint. It doesn't have any cookie chunks, but it does sort of taste like a Thin Mint cookie. The Vanilla Maple doesn't really taste like maple, just vanilla. I think it's the most versatile flavor, as you can make a wonderful and healthy sundae by adding fresh fruit, PB2, or sugar free chocolate syrup. If I could customize this order, I would do without the strawberry flavor. That one was a neon pink color and very fake tasting and almost too sweet. Even when partially thawed, it had more of an icy sherbert consistency and not the same creamy consistency of the other flavors. It also seemed to get gummy as it melted, which the other flavors did not. Some reviewers have complained that this product tastes like cardboard and that it isn't sweet at all. I completely disagree. I have a sweet tooth and found this product plenty sweet enough for me. If you love the Weight Watchers or Skinny Cow ice cream treats, you will love this, as it tastes similar and you get a much larger volume of ice cream for the same amount of calories. You can also add a scoop to smoothies or milkshakes for a special treat.<br /><br />I can only eat about half of a pint in one sitting, but it's nice to know that if I did eat the whole thing, it would only cost me 150 calories. Artic Zero is a splurge for my wallet, but not for my diet.

review/text: Ok, if you can't have sugar or artificial sweetner I guess this is for you.  If it is all you can have.  I bought Vanilla maple and chocolate peanut butter.  They have NO sweet taste at all - zero. The vanilla maple tastes as the name says but without any sweetness.  The texture is not good - like frozen milk, not creamy at all. The chocolate peanut butter is a better flavor but still NO sweetness.  It tastes like chocolate with a hint of peanut butter.  Very disappointed as all these reviews convinced me this would be good.  if you are looking to just have these flavors in your mouth, they may work but it is not going to satisfy your sweet tooth.

review/summary: ITS GOOD!
review/text: THIS FROZEN DESERT HAS A SMOOTH TEXTURE AND MILD FLAVOR.  YOU WON'T MISTAKE IT FOR ICE CREAM.  ITS LIGHTER, MORE LIKE FROZEN YOGURT AND LESS SWEET.<br /><br />I FIND THE FLAVORS SATISFYING AND REFRESHING.  EACH FLAVOR TASTES LIGHT BUT NOT BLAND. THE CHOCOLATE MINT AND CHOCOLATE PEANUT BUTTER HAVE JUST A HINT OF THE SECOND FLAVOR. IF YOU LIKE STRONG FLAVORS THIS MAY BE TOO LIGHT FOR YOU.  TOPPINGS MAY BE AN ENHANCEMENT.<br /><br />AT ABOUT $5.70 A PINT (INCLUDING SHIPPING) FOR THE TEN PACK IT IS NOT FAR OFF FROM THE LOCAL PRICE.  IT IS NOT WIDELY AVAILABLE AT LOCAL SUPERRMARKETS WHICH MAKES ON LINE ORDERING MORE CONVENIENT.  LOCAL FOR ME MEANS A HIKE TO A STORE THAT CARRIES IT FOLLOWED BY A RACE HOME TO THE FREEZER.<br /><br />INCLUDED IN THE PACKAGING IS AN ORDER FORM.  IT IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON THEIR WEBSITE.  THE FORM IS LAID OUT FOR YOUR LOCAL GROCER TO PLACE AN ORDER.  WORKS FOR CONSUMER LIKE ME WHERE ITS TOO HOT NOT TO PURCHASE IT NEARBY.  WORKS FOR THEM BY INCREASING THEIR DISTRIBUTION.<br /><br />NEARBY OR ONLINE I INTEND TO BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN.  AT 150 CALORIES A PINT, ADDED PROTEIN, AND LOW SUGAR ITS SUITABLE FOR DIETERS, WEIGHT LOSS SURGERY PATIENTS, AND THOSE WHO LIKE A TREAT WITHOUT ALL THE CALORIES.<br /><br />THERE ARE TWO NEGATIVES:<br />-THE TEN PACK DOES NOT OFFER A CHOICE OF FLAVORS AND COMES IN JUST ONE COMBINATION.<br />-THE PACKAGING IS INADAQUATE.  THE DRY ICE WAS NEAR THE BOTTOM WHERE THE CONTAINERS WERE STILL FROZEN.  THE CONTAINERS ON TOP HAD BEGUN TO MELT.  FORTUNATELY I GOT EVERYTHING INTO THE FREEZR WITHIN MINUTES OF DELIVERY.  THIS NEEDS MORE THAN ONE PACKAGE OF DRY ICE.

review/text: I really enjoy this peppermint tea.  It has a nice light flavor which I enjoy drinking after dinner or when I have a cold.  I first found "Tao of Tea" when I was searching for single ingredient teas, which are surprisingly hard to find.  I there are common ingredients to many mixed teas that I cannot consume to I am very thankful for the single ingredient teas.  It is also nice to mix a few single ingredient teas to make my own blends which I KNOW that I can consume all the ingredients. The fact that these are organic is a plus!

review/summary: For you health buffs, this is an alkalizing drink
review/text: Besides tasting delicious when mixed with cold milk (and it mixes better now than it did a few decades ago), it is important to remember that the body resists disease better when it has a slightly alkaline pH than an acid pH. Eating meats, sweets, and junk food will get you an acid pH. A couple of glasses of this daily will help, but not guarantee, you keep a healthy body acid/alkaline balance. Greatly reduces the chance you will get or suffer long from canker sores in the mouth resulting from over-acidity. This drink is the only substance I have ever found which speeds their healing. And it's just plain enjoyable to drink.

review/summary: Why is this stuff so hard to find?!!
review/text: I have been a huge fan of this, the ONLY authentic malted mix, in my estimation, since childhood 6 decades ago.<br /><br />I can understand that not every grocery store might want to carry it, but I am absolutely baffled that it is such a rarity on ANY grocery stores' shelves!<br /><br />I guess when Nestle bought Carnation, it became just another product and no one is really attempting to market it. More's the pity.<br /><br />I have found it on the shelves of a WalMart superstore in Kingston, NY, as well as the Kingston Shoprite down the street from the Walmart. Kingston is the largest population center for a radius of about 15 miles, and boasts a meager population of about 23,500. 2 stores within a half-mile of each other carry it where population is so sparse.<br /><br />I live in Westchester county, in the suburbs of NYC (pop. 8,000,000) and can't find it anywhere! Not at the A&P, Super Stop and Shop, NOWHERE! I have to drive to Harlem, 20 mi. away, in NYC to find it.<br /><br />My opinion is that it's a failure of Nestle's salespeople. SOMEONE within a 5-mile radius of Mamaroneck, NY (pop. 18,350, in a densely populated area) should carry it!

review/summary: Great food, but consider the costs.
review/text: I have an old, soppy Saint Bernard who's missing a bunch of her teeth.  And don't start nagging me about doggy dental care!  I adopted her from a rescue organization & the damage had already been done when we got her.  Anyway, we started supplementing her dry kibble with this canned food; and although she really likes it & the consistency is great for her toothlessness, the price increases EVERY TIME we order have left me seeking other options.<br /><br />After weighing out all the costs, it's actually cheaper to buy ground beef in bulk & boil it up for her, and mix it up with some brown rice and/or eggs.  I don't know if this diet is "healthier" for her, but she isn't gaining any extra weight & her coat looks fantastic.  And I have peace of mind in knowing ~exactly~ what she's eating.  She's almost 10 & probably doesn't have a whole lot of time left with us, and she seems to prefer the hamburger/brown rice/egg concoction to the canned food.  And my budget likes having a couple of extra dollars a week, too.<br /><br />I really do think it's a great food.  Just make sure you do your own cost calculations to find the best value for your already-stretched dollar.

review/text: My sister told me about Organix brand dog food.  After reading the ingredients I began buying it for my dogs.  I only feed them premium dog foods like Organix and Chicken Soup for the Dog Lovers' Soul.  They contain real meat products and no fillers.  Organix takes this a step further with organic food in the ingredients.  The price is a bit higher, but it's worth it to have healthy pets!  My last dog died of cancer, and after a lot of research, I believe that high-quality pet food ingredients without fillers are the best plan for healthier pets!

review/text: I bought a case of this (Adult Organic Turkey and Organic Vegetables Formula)12.7 oz cans beause my dog adores the Organix Dry Dog Food  and he does very well on it. As soon as I gave him a little canned (a small amount mixed with his other food) he started vomiting white foamy stuff the following morning.  I ended up giving a can to a friend and her dog had horrible breath (from his stomach--does not have bad teeth). I didn't give the rest away, will throw it away. I emailed the company twice and they couldn't  bother to respond in about two weeks. Apparently they don't stand by their products. Now I don't trust any of their products even though my dog does fine on the dry formula.

review/summary: My FAVORITE cola on the market
review/text: Not overly carbonated, extra nice cola taste and best of all no caffeine. I actually hunted this stuff down the other day and wanted one real bad late in the evening...It was only then that I realized that it was caffeine free!<br />-<br />Real good stuff.

review/summary: was great
review/text: I used to buy this all the time then I moved and couldn't find it for about a year. I found a place that sells it recently and bought 12 bottles. Well it smelled like mildew and tasted horrible. I emailed Sprecher about it but got no reply. Now Im afraid to buy it anymore. It had some numbers on it that could be a date? 120131138 If that's the date it was made its only 3 months old. If its an expiration date its only 3 months expired. Either way it tasted horrible.

review/summary: Best tool for wine pouring
review/text: This wine aerator works wonders for wine.  It gives a whole new meaning to flavor.  I bought this as a Christmas Gift after trying it out at a local wine store.  I think it will be a hit at our gift exchange.  The price on line was much better than the wine store which was also a bonus.

review/summary: Awesome invention!
review/text: I absolutely love my Vinturi kit!  IT is amazing how it turns a $5 bottle of wine into at least a $20 bottle.  Really a great invention.  Great conversation starter if you have people over.  And its sleek and beautiful.  Plus the price was unbeatable!
