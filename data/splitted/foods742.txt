review/summary: The only chips worth buying!
review/text: Once you've tasted these chips, it's impossible to taste another chip with the same kind of flavor, crunch and overall deliciousness!  My whole family holds other chips to Madhouse standards and we have never tasted another like it!  These are hands down the BEST CHIPS ON THE MARKET!  We like all of the flavors....not picky when it comes to Madhouse- they are all the best!

review/summary: The Best Chips
review/text: I was introduced to Madhouse Munchies some years ago and they still as impressive.  From the moment you open a bag of Madhouse Munchies you will be greeted with the crunchiest, tastiest and healthiest potato chips.  I'm a sucker for the original Sea Salted but both the Barbeque and Vinegar chips delight.  An excellent  AVA (American Vegetarian Association) product.

review/summary: these chips are worth eating
review/text: Who needs potato chips when there are full of bad oil, salt, cholesterol, perservatives? But now we have found a chip worthy of eating often.  These chips are cooked in oil that is healthier (don't tell the kids) and taste way better than the average chip.  No oily taste like others, just potato and awesome spices.  I even stick them in the kids lunches.

You can buy small bags or larger quantities.  Order them and you will find that not only isn't one chip enough, one bag isn't enough.  Also the price on Amazon is amazing.  Enjoy!

review/summary: The Best Salt and Vinegar Chips, Period
review/text: I first discovered Mad House Munchies Sea Salt and Vinegar Chips at Farmers Market in Woodstock VT years ago. I have tried others, none have come close, not even Cape Cod (a damned good chip). I have ordered them by the case from the factory and now I'm happy to see them on Amazon.<br /><br />Mad House sent an email out today offering a free pint of Ben and Jerry's or a free bag of chips in return for a customer review. They can keep their free gift, I just want you to know that they make a great chip.

review/summary: unimpressed by flimsy chips
review/text: I bought these chips because of all the positive reviews (and because they were cheap, with Amazon discounts), but I'm underwhelmed by both the Madhouse Munchies chip flavors I've purchased:  the Mesquite BBQ mentioned here, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HDKZZK">Madhouse Munchies Sea Salt & Vinegar Potato Chips, 5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />The chips are perfectly edible (unlike some other chips I've tried, I won't have to give away every bag because I can't use them at all at home), but thin and insubstantial -- at least compared to the much superior Kettle brand chips I've been buying from Amazon, such as their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBVO">Kettle Chips, Sea Salt & Vinegar, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a> and their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4FI">Kettle Krinkle Cut Chips, Salt & Fresh Ground Pepper, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a> -- and the 'fire sweet' smokey quality of the barbecue flavor is a bit overpowering (especially with a weak chip underneath, offering nothing to back it up with other flavor notes).<br /><br />I'd prefer to get much more satisfaction and flavor in return for my caloric over-indulgence than is offered by Madhouse Munchies snacks so far.<br /><br />Unless you've already tried Madhouse Munchies brand from your local grocery store and loved their chips, I wouldn't advise purchasing this in bulk just yet.  There are far better chips available here for just a little more money (when you take advantage of sales and discounts).

review/summary: This Is the Way to Go ...
review/text: ... if you use cardamom a lot. The powdered cardamom is a waste of money; once the jar is opened, it loses 90% of its flavor within a day or two. The whole pods are troublesome to peel, though if you use cardamom less than once a week, the pods retain the maximum flavor and justify the trouble. But if you use cardamom in the quantities of either a Swedish baker or an Indian curry-maker -- or, like me, both -- a 16-ounce bag of decorticated seeds will 'get you through'.<br /><br />You can grind these seeds in a mortar, and it's kinda fun to do so, but I'd recommend a small cheap electric coffee mill dedicated to cardamom only. It won't clog and it won't need washing.<br /><br />If you buy the whole green cardamom pods, you can use the pods in coffee, putting the pods in the filter cone with the grounds. Assuming, of course, that you like the taste. It seems to be growing in popularity in the USA and Canada; lots of creameries are now offering cardamom ice cream. Yum!

review/summary: This is a good deal if you bake with cardamom
review/text: I bought about a tablespoon of these seeds from a local weigh-your-own-spices vendor and it cost about $2.  This product costs slightly less than $1/oz in bulk, and 2 oz. ($2 worth) fills a tall spice jar.  If you do any Scandinavian baking and use cardamom on a regular basis, it is well worth purchasing this in bulk.  You can divide the stash among friends.  For convenience, it sure beats buying cardamom in the pods, and if you have a means to grind it yourself (even a hammer on a folded piece of cloth will do), it will be much fresher than buying pulverized cardamom.

review/text: I had never bought cardamom before and wanted to investigate before buying any, since it is expensive. I learned that the powdered version loses its strength quickly. So I tried this whole spice. Very nice! The fragrance is overwhelming. Clearly it is fresh. I gave some to a friend and she could not stop holding it up to her nose and raving about it. I don't grind it until I'm ready to use it. I enjoy it mixed in my coffee beans and will be trying it in other ways, such as chai.

review/text: It is excellent quality. I use this in curries all the time and it also gives great fragrance to steamed rice (combine it with a clove or two). This is better than getting the powder which loses its aroma and flavor rapidly. I put about a quarter of this in an airtight jar in the spice cabinet and I froze the rest. It crushes easily in a mortar/pestle in a few seconds so it's simple to use often.

review/text: My items were received very promptly and in excellent condition. I bought this item for my mother-in-law because she makes a lot of coffee cakes with cardamom and said hers was getting old.  Unfortunately, she didn't want them and I don't bake.  It was then that I found out they could not be returned.  So I have about $20 worth of cardamom that will probably never get used. I don't understand why they could not be returned since they were still in the sealed package they came in.  Even grocery stores will take returns.  Live and learn.

review/summary: Fig bar *with*, not 'covered by', dark chocolate. Good alone, but seemingly ideal as an ingredient/filling/topping/accompaniment
review/text: This bar is somewhat akin to being a kind of ~'chocolatized fig newton interior', albeit one in which the fig component is 100% fig (though isn't 'gritty' in places the way the interior of a fig newton is).<br /><br />Just minutes ago, I finished eating my first bar of this.<br /><br />An important distinction to make is that the name of the product (& which is found on the product packaging of each individual bar) states "Fig Bar with Dark Chocolate" -- i.e. WITH -- but the Product Description online states "Fig covered in dark chocolate" -- which gives the errant impression that this bar is a slab of fig interior, with a dark chocolate exterior, which is NOT the case.<br /><br />The fig & dark chocolate components have been mixed together -- however, when one tastes this, it's almost as though the fig & dark chocolate 'take turns' with your tastebuds -- even though there is definitely an initial fig+dark_chocolate_together overall taste, as I chewed each bite, there was a sort of alternating aspect to which of the components I was tasting in any given split second (somewhat as though hearing a duet being sung by 2 singers, & simultaneously being able to register individual voices & ~'harmonies' [when it comes to the tastes which involve contributions of both the fig & dark chocolate]).<br /><br />It might seem strange to utilize a singing/duet -type analogy, but honestly, I was a bit surprised by how the fig aspect would suddenly 'register' with my tastebuds, & then a split second later, I was 'registering' the dark chocolate, & then a split second later, I was 'registering' both -- it was like different distinct aspects of the respective primary ingredients were still 'standing their ground' despite being part of a mix -- i.e. the 'what makes a fig taste like a fig' aspect wasn't 'crushed' in the process of the smushed figs being mixed with dark chocolate -- & so there's a kind of interestingly multidimensional taste to this.<br /><br />Also, to clarify, the chocolate taste is definitely one of dark chocolate -- i.e. it isn't the 'sweet' taste associated with other kinds of chocolate (it's sweeter than unsweetened chocolate, but this bar would not end up confusing anyone doing a taste test, as to whether it was any kind of 'candy bar' -- this bar tastes like what it's advertised to be -- fig with dark chocolate, period).<br /><br />The ingredient listing on the individual bar's packaging states that these bars are 90% fig & 10% dark chocolate.  The 'how much fig to be mixed with how much dark chocolate' ratio that has been used with the product seems to accomplish what the manufacturer likely set out to do -- i.e. allow the consumer to enjoy *both* tastes, & not have any one taste 'overpower' the other.<br /><br />Texture-wise, this is very much like the Oskri 100% fig bar, but has a slightly more firm texture due to the presence of the dark chocolate.<br /><br />The nutrition profile of a 1.9 oz bar (per what is on an individual bar's packaging) =<br />Calories : 60<br /><br />Total Fat : 2 g<br />Saturated Fat : 1g<br />Trans Fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 0mg<br /><br />Total Carb : 13g<br />Fiber : 2g<br />Sugars : 11g<br />Protein : 1g<br /><br />The ingredient profile =<br />Figs 90%<br />Dark chocolate 10% (sugar, chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, soy lecithin, natural vanilla)<br /><br />The product packaging conveys that the product is Vegan, Lactose Free, Gluten Free, & Kosher.<br /><br />Consistent with the minimal ingredient mix associated with this bar's composition, one does not taste anything else -- this bar tastes like fig with dark chocolate, & that's it -- no artificial whatnot interfering with the taste or nutrition.<br /><br />Lastly, & this might sound strange, but something I find appealing about the Oskri fig with dark chocolate bar & the Oskri 100% fig bar is that they are an easy, convenient, conveniently sized & indirectly ~portion-controlled, & shelf-life-stable-for-over-a-year (the bar I just ate was manufactured in Feb 2012 & has an expiration date of August 2013) way to obtain (& keep on hand) an atypical ingredient for baking -- or for an ad hoc addition to or topping for various baked goods (& the 100% fig bar, in particular, but also this bar, to an extent [though especially if heated slightly] could be relatively easily spread atop either toast, bagels, or various breads, or various confectionary items [& specifically, those which wouldn't 'fall apart' if something were spread on with slight pressure]).<br /><br />This is an interesting taste, & a not-so-easy-to-find ingredient mix (at least in my experience, & especially in such an unadulterated form [this stuff is 'pure & simple', & without food additives]), & while the manufacturer of the product might not have intended this type of use (as a baked goods add-on/mix-in, or as an alternative to ~jelly or cream cheese), it's something I can't help finding the product readily useful for & utterly compatible with.  And truth be told, after eating one bar, I think I'd actually prefer to have a little something 'with' the fig & dark chocolate -- but I'm glad that the manufacturer didn't include it (or in any way render a new form of fig newton) -- I like the fact that I have the option of pairing this with whatever baked-type base or ~wrap-around form of baked whateverness I so choose...<br /><br />Additionally, given the fig/fruit component, & even with the presence of dark chocolate in this particular bar (versus the Oskri 100% fig bar), the next 'frontier' of food pairing that crosses my mind for these Oskri fig bars, is to try them with pears, &/or blue cheese, &/or proscuitto (& with the 'ultimate' being proscuitto-wrapped figs & blue cheese [I can't help but think that I'll also try it with the dark chocolate-ized version, as well, just to see what it tastes like :) ]).  Basically, anything one might find compatible with figs, I would venture to try with cut up pieces of or a mashed version of an Oskri fig bar (of one kind or the other).  Who knows... this fig with dark chocolate product might end up being a part of my next homerun hors d'oeuvre (I'm already imagining what pieces of it might taste like wrapped in bacon [that possibility has just leapfrogged all others as the gotta-try-it-first pairing :) (& after that, bacon-wrapped fig & dark chocolate with blue cheese)])...<br /><br />I'm glad that this product is available, & look forward to 'experimenting' with whatever add-on/mix-in -type pairings turn out to be a fun & interesting way to enjoy this readily accessible & conveniently mixable/mashable/moldable form of fig.

review/summary: AMAZING UNEXPECTED FLAVOR COMBO W/ OFFBEAT BRAND NAME
review/text: There was always something intriguing about this brand of snack bars, and the unusual name is part of the mystique. Since I have tastes that are off the well-worn track, I finally took the plunge and tried out the dark chocolate fig bars. And I was delightfully surprised. They remind me of the old "Apple Bakes" bars that we used to get at one of those "Big Lots" kind of stores, which feature clearance products. So you might not get bowled over by this one's fairly humble presentation, since it seems to have minimal hype. But I really appreciate their simple list of ingredients, and here you get 90% fig in each bar! It's a very dense snack - not unlike a brownie. The box they come in is also a nice touch -- very practical and perfect for hiding!! It looks like they are also made in Wisconsin, so I am glad I am keeping my purchase money fairly local. Plus I have a close relative who lives up there! All in all, this bar (and the other tasty nutrition-savvy ones by the brand) is "the road less traveled" but definitely packed with satisfaction. I plan to savor this box for a while and use the rest for gifts. Looks like 2012 is going to end in an awesomely Oskri Christmas!!

review/summary: Delicious, expensive, nutritionally misleading, poorly described
review/text: First, I want to say that I love these bars. They are delicious in a way that is unique to other treats and they are filling. I can eat one for breakfast and not be hungry for hours.<br /><br />HOWEVER, they are expensive. Now I don't mind paying for an expensive treat given that I am on Weight Watchers and stumbling onto this little gem of a filling treat at 60 calories per bar was like finding a dieters miracle.<br /><br />But for the price, I want to know that what the label says or what the Amazon description says, is, in fact, what I am getting. The labels, last time I ordered these, said, 60 calories, in bold print on the front of each bar. This time it says 150. Additionally, the Amazon description gives two conflicting nutritional explanations right within the same description. One line says "Fig covered in dark chocolate; Delivering only 60 calories per pack; 2 grams of fiber; 1 gram protein; 2 grams total fat; 11 grams sugar" while only 4 lines down it says, "150 Calories per bar, 3 g Fiber; 5g Protein." This is only the description online, the label itself has a couple more conflicting nutritional facts. The front of the label says, "150g calories, 2g protein, 5g Fiber, 2g Fat, 26g Sugar." The back of the label is another story entirely.<br /><br />Again, I love these bars but I pay a lot for them and for Weight Watchers and poorly reported information is derailing my progress and wasting my money and for this reason, I am giving it only 2 stars.<br /><br />Lastly, despite the description, these are not covered in chocolate. They are bars of fig with little bits of dark chocolate within (when you are lucky...often times I've opened bars where the chocolate was omitted.)

review/summary: Thin & crispy but too salty
review/text: I love blue corn tortillas and their products. I had been eating the Guiltless Gourmet brand Blue Corn Tortilla Chips for many years but ultimately found their chips a bit thick & bland. I decided to try out Garden of Eatin, and I am glad I did. Thinner and crispier than the GG brand with a richer blue corn flavor. If I didn't know they were baked, I'd think they were fried! My only complaint is the excessive salt which is super obvious on a dark blue chip. I just brush the extra salt off but this can be a pain. I'd buy a salt-free option if they offered it in their baked blue chips, but they only offer it in the fried blue chips. For now, these'll do.

review/summary: Too salty and nearly expired.
review/text: I ordered a case of these chips from Amazon because I like the regular Garden of Eatin blue chips and usually like baked chips better than fried.  I ordered a case (and put myself on subscription) to get the best price and figured I could eat a couple of cases a year.  But these chips are too salty - eating them actually burns my lips!  And all of the bags in the case I received from Amazon on January 5 have "best by" dates of February 3, 2010.  How am I supposed to eat 12 bags of too salty chips in less than a month?  Since Amazon does not allow returns on this item, I'll probably just donate my case to the food bank.  I highly recommend that before you order this item, buy a test bag at Whole Foods first.  And don't order a case unless you can use it within a month.  Learn from my experience!

review/summary: like stale popcorn
review/text: These 1.5" rounds are cut too small for dipping, and may be too fragile for proper Tortilla dishes - so it's a shame I'm now stuck with a case of them.  considering the soy is at the end of the ingredient list after various oils and before the salt, then such soy is just a marketing gimmick to help excuse such a disappointing blue corn chip.  Target's Archer Farms Organic Blue Corn With Flax Seed Tortilla Chips - are much better and cheaper.  Thank you Amazon for double boxing this and sending out a 3 Month long dated product during a 50% off sale.

review/text: The chips are great, with a family of seven the only shelf life I worry about is keeping them there.  Really though, did you see the price?  Like $1.12 a bag. Whole foods may finnally have someone to hold them accountable destroying health food stores.  Thanks Amazon, for carring the brands whole foods wont bother with any more and for having prices that you can feed families with.

review/summary: Good, as long as they are still fresh
review/text: I bought these chips in May 2009, and they were best eaten by 9/12/2009.  When I first got them, they were very tasty and exactly what I had expected.  I would have rated them 4 or 5 stars then.<br /><br />However starting in early August, there was a definite odd taste that was starting to creep into the chip.  And here in early September they are totally inedible.  My guess is that the oils used have gone rancid in the chip, since they are using natural oils.  Normally this is a very good thing, but the longevity of the product is sacrificed due to it, which is a problem when you are buying chips in 12 bag packages!<br /><br />So if you are purchasing these chips please make sure you are able to eat them quickly, they will not be any good about 1 month before the best eaten by date.  I had to throw away about 5 bags....

review/summary: I love the sesame in these chips, you will too!
review/text: I love sesame in general. It makes foods more satisfying. There are two brands of blue corn sesame chips I know of; this one and one by Kettle. I think I might prefer the Kettle brand a little over this one since they use sprouted corn. Somehow that improves the flavor a little. These are still a 5 star product though. Sadly, I just searched for the Kettle chips and found they have been discontinued, so not only are these a great choice for sesame blue goodness they are your only choice!<br /><br />Of course chips like these are pretty high in fat, so it is not a good idea to eat them too often. They are quite addictive as well. For a little addition to a lunchtime meal you will not be disappointed. I hope you like them as much as I do.<br /><br />-Dan

They should be labeled Corn & Black Bean chips.  They don't taste bad, as far as chips go.  But they are definitely nowhere near as good as the old Trader Joe's variety.

review/text: I've been eating these chips with my lunch every day for over two years now. I love the taste first of all. Unlike two other black bean corn chip products I have tried (and more and more chip makers seem to be making black bean corn chips now), these are what they say they are: corn chips with black beans in them - - no lime or herb or any other kind of "flavor enhancer".<br /><br />I like the price of the chips here on Amazon. A 7.5 ounce bag sells for around $3 a bag, sometimes less when on sale.  Here, the case price works out to about $2.25 a bag,  - and delivery is free.

review/summary: The best corn chips out there
review/text: Although these are way more fun than regular white or yellow corn chips, they taste pretty much the same as any other color of natural corn tortilla chips.  These chips are blue because the type of corn they are made from naturally grows blue - there's no blue dye here!  Garden of Eatin' is my favorite brand for chips, because they put so much  thought into all their products, from the organic corn to the cold-pressed oils.  They even use filtered water!<br /><br />The chips I got were all really fresh, delicious, and crunchy, except for one bag out of 12, which had a good date, but tasted a bit stale.  To my surprise, not many of the chips got broken during shipping, although I'm not sure I'll be that lucky to get unbroken chips everytime I order these.<br /><br />If you've never tried these, I suggest getting just one bag from a local store, and wait to order from here till you know you like them.  If you already know you like blue chips, get them here, as this price is unbeatable.

review/summary: The best chips ever invented, truly the pinnacle of human acheivement and civilization
review/text: Fate has smiled upon you today, for you have stumbled upon a review of the best corn chips on the planet.  Yes they really are that good.<br /><br />I'm not in thrall of the whole "organic" thing generally, but I have to say these blue corn chips themselves are somehow FAR better than competitors. Crisp and thick cut, a strong corn taste. You probably don't think a chip can have a strong corn taste, but these do, because unlike competitors they're not cooked in a month old batch of mystery oil.<br /><br />The person who came up with this "red hot" flavoring is a genius, this is the best flavoring for chips ever invented.  It will make your toes curl and your eyes roll back into your head.  It is only a little hot, but it builds up a bit if you eat the whole darn bag, which you almost certainly will.<br /><br />I also recommend their plain blue corn chips for dips, but for the love of everything that is good don't get the unsalted ones.

review/text: I specifically ordered these chips because the nutrition information states they have 4 grams of fiber per serving. They taste good, so I ordered the case from Amazon. (In fact, I even signed up for subscribe and save) When my package arrived today, the bag says they only have 1 gram of fiber per serving! I called Garden of Eatin' and was told that there was new analysis and testing done which shows they only actually have one gram of fiber per serving. That's a huge difference! The customer service rep said the testing was done in September, yet the nutrition information on their own website still shows 4 grams of fiber. To me, that is false advertising. How hard is it to go in change that information on your own website!<br /><br />So, bottom line, if you don't care about the amount of fiber...these are really tasty chips. But if the amount of fiber is what attracted you to them, don't buy!

review/text: I've order the Seasame Blues before and thought they were great. The 7.5 ounce bags are round compared to the triangles. When you open the bag you get a strong odor of bad oil. The taste also has the bad oil to it. Unfortunately I sent a box to my sister after bragging about them. I called company but no word yet.

review/summary: Wonderful Amazon experience
review/text: My first shipment of corn chips was rancid and absolutely inedible. That was very unfortunate because Garden of Eatin'chips can be very tasty. The Amazon vendor was no longer shipping so they were not replaced. I thought I was out the cost of a case of corn chips and still hungry.<br />  But...........<br />Upon hearing my concern, Amazon found a vendor and sent a new shipment at their cost next day. Those chips are absolutely perfect! Amazon's responsiveness, service and customer care is exceptional! Thanks Amazon for a superb customer experience and for renewing my faith in Garden of Eaten' Blue Corn Chips!

review/summary: 25% chance of rancid chips - No Thanks
review/text: I have eaten the varieties of these for years and appreciate the concept- organic, not over salted, good varieities, etc.<br /><br />But more and more often, whether purchased here or in the store, in all varieties, the chips come with a sharp odor and flavor that to more suggests that rancid oil was used.  Sometimes it is subtle, sometimes terrible, and I am sick of wondering if I am eating something that has gone bad- and rancid oils are really bad for you, which defeats the purpose of this product. I can return them to a store but not to Amazon.  This is still a huge pain and not something that anyone should have to do.  I had to throw out a whole case of sesame blues from Amazon, which is a bad deal at any price. I am done with your rancid products.

review/summary: Regular tortilla chips.  Not flavorful.
review/text: I have noooo idea what the "blech" titled review is about.  My bag is not spicy at all, and the chips definitely don't taste bad. They were not too crunchy either.  In fact they are almost plain regular chips.  No big pizzaz here.  I was sad about that.<br /><br />I was actually really hoping for something limey! And Spicy! But don't expect that here.  I've almost gone through a whole bag, and maybe 1% of the bites have a hint of lime?  Zero bites have had a hint of chili.  99% taste like regular unflavored tortilla chips.  Well...a suuupppper small hint of flavor.  I'm almost wishing I had bought the pico de gallo instead.<br /><br />Basically, if you've been eating any chili-lemon flavored cheetos, completely wipe your memory and expectations- nothing that bold and tangy here.  (Which can be good and bad, my hubby hated the cheetos chili-lemon unspicy flavor and was worried we'd get that here, so he's happy we didn't.  I was looking forward to getting that popping taste, and am sad that wasn't there.)<br /><br />** WARNING: If you've never ordered full size bag of chips from amazon, be warned, 12 bags is A LOT!!! I opened the box and my jaw almost dropped, cause I don't know what I'm going to do with all the bags.  I'm sure they'll disappear at parties though.  (I had ordered mini 2oz bags from Amazon, and with those, the bulk amount is more manageable.)<br /><br />** Also, to make you feel good...I was at Ralphs shopping and one bag of 'Garden of Eaten' chips cost $5.39.  I think it was jalapeno cheese, and that's all they had, but regardless, I felt so good that I got the same thing for about $1.25 a bag (yea Amazon had it on sale). Yippy :-)<br /><br />** Chips were not stale, chipped or smashed on arrival, in case you're wondering.  And expiration date (on my on sale ones) is in about 4 months.

review/text: Lime and chili? When I saw that on the package, I was most intrigued! It seemed like an odd combination. But I like the taste of lime and I really like the zing of a good chili.<br /><br />Well, the label is half right. The taste of lime is really quite distinct and refreshing. I really enjoy that part of the equation. But from my experience with these chips, the chili taste is overpowered by the lime (or there was not much of the chili flavor to begin with).<br /><br />Still, the lime test is so refreshing!<br /><br />All in all, a good product because of the lime. But, in the end, rather unsatisfactory, because the pairing of lime and chili doesn't quite work.

They are absolutely delicious, spiced up just right, perfect in taco salad, with salsa or just fine all alone (and it helps if your alone too because when sharing these chips are addictive!)<br />But I HAVE TO SAY that these chips purchased through amazon were the best NO EXAGGERATION, that I have had. I thought it was just me but then my husband was like "i dunno what it is but those chips are GOOODDD!!" They were fresh, so fresh and this size bags makes it better for snacking/sharing as opposed to the larger bags from the store.<br />Stop reading and order these, your family will thank u :-D

review/summary: My Favorite Torilla Chips
review/text: I tried these chips about 4 years ago before the blue corn tortilla chips were popular. The second I finished eating one chip I knew I would be a customer for life. These are absolutely amazing. I wish all of the ingredients were organic but i won't be too picky. The 12 bags are quite a bit to get in one order but it is much cheaper than getting it at a local store. If you like to entertain these would be a good idea to keep handy for a more healthy option for your guests. I love these little guys. I would recommend to anyone.

review/summary: Yuck-a-moldy
review/text: If they were not on sale, I wouldn't have bought them, having tried other brands of "guac-a-mole" flavored tortilla chips.  I'm glad I didn't pay full price.  The taste is hard to describe - somewhere between gasoline and garbage, neither of which I've ever actually ingested, but which these chips brought to mind by taste and smell.  How do people eat and enjoy this crud?  The only explanation I arrive at is they've never savored the exquisitely smooth and sprightly taste of true guacamole made with ripe avocados and fresh cilantro.<br />I had to give this product one star because Amazon said so.  I guess that star could go for the unbelievably corny (no pun intended) "new look, same great taste" icon on the upper-left corner of the bag.  Its such a quaint reminder of the inane, inconsequential marketing style of the "Mad-Men" era I grew up in.

review/summary: Great chips, but...
review/text: I really like these chips. We go through a lot of corn chips in this house and it is important to me that our corn chips are organic as I refuse to eat GMO corn. They have a great flavor and the perfect amount of salt. My only complaint is that this last case we recieved, the chips are so fragile! They are breaking really easily, they are not holding up to any amount of dipping, which is a bummer. I'll still buy these chips, I'm just not as pleased with them as I have been in the past. Perhaps it was just an odd batch, as they haven't always been this way.<br /><br />We have bought several flavors of Garden of Eatin chips and this brand is a winner, overall. Definitely our favorite corn chip brand!

The only problem I see is that garden of eatin has a line of about 15 different tortilla chips. The only one's baked are these two.

review/text: I love the salt free blue corn chips. When I lived in Florida I ate salsa/hummus/blue corn chips for lunch pretty much every day. There was so much salt between the salsa and hummus, that I really didn't need it on the chips. When I first started with the salted chips, my mouth would be on fire after a few chips. The salt free was an awesome find, and I love that amazon sold them in bulk so that I could afford them.<br /><br />Only con is because I'm single/live alone, and going through 12 bags of tortilla chips before they expire is a challenge (natural products tend to expire quicker). I ate them after the "best by" date, they just ended up being a little stale. No fault of the product, just my own issue to deal with. Still 5 star product!

review/text: I have always loved these chips and buy them often at the grocery store. Since Amazon offered them at a very good price I purchased a case, However, upon receipt I was disappointed and immediately notified the company (Garden of Eatin). They were not as good as the ones in the grocery store (they seemed to be darker and greasier)and I wondered if they were old. The expiration date indicates they are fine. I do not dislike them, though I love the store ones, and have decided to keep them. Salsa can fix anything. However, I will not purchase them again in bulk from Amazon. My biggest disappointment has been that the company never responded to my email.

review/text: I have always loved the Garden of Eatin' Chili-Lime chips, but these are a close second.  I also ordered the Nacho (which my kids like, but I can't eat).<br /><br />Anyway, the Guacamole chips are a great snack for long drives, but it is too easy to eat the whole bag full!

review/summary: two small issues
review/text: I have no idea why I ordered these... must have been pretty hungry that day and just needed something to fill the order to get my free shipping.<br /><br />But speaking of shipping, I ordered these "MINI WHITE ROUNDS" and an equivalent order of "TATO SKINS".  The "skins" arrived unbroken while the "rounds" were about half rounds and half crumbles.  I think the difference was that the "skins" people engineered the size of the box just right so the puffy bags held each other in place, while the "rounds" people just threw a dozen bags into the box and only filled it about 3/4 of the way, leaving the bags free to slop around inside.<br /><br />Secondly, just the cursory test, I opened a bag and tasted a few, sort of expecting a "tostitos" or "mission" kind of taste, but they were just a kind of bland corn tortilla taste... which is exactly what they were supposed to be, but ... well you know... expected a taste that would keep me reaching back into the bag until I was ashamed of myself... the "Tato Skins" certainly did!  Maybe they'll be better when I dip them in some quacamole or something.

review/summary: crunchy, tasty, wholesome
review/text: A marvelous crunchy treat, acceptable to even the most finicky toddler. Wonderful with salsa and sour cream, hot spinach and artichoke dip, and many more ways. If they used a different fat to cook them (the label currently says safflower and/or canola) they would be perfect. I love that they're free of GMO but I'd be even happier if they contained a healthy fat such as lard or coconut oil, or even olive or sunflower or grapeseed would be an improvement.

review/summary: Broken Chips
review/text: These are great chips!  I also like the red chips.  UNFORTUNATELY, Amazon ships these out in the vendor boxes which are very flimsy.  All of the chips end up broken.<br /><br />It's so funny -- everything else Amazon sends out is in rugged Amazon boxes -- sometimes the item inside is in the vendor box so you get double protection.  The items that should be double boxed (chips) don't get any protection at all and they are the most fragile.

review/text: I bought the wrong item.  These chips were disappointing.  The regular Garden of Eatin' Black Bean tortilla chips are high in fiber (4 grams) but these chips are only 2 grams.  Sorry I bought them.

review/summary: Best tortilla chips snack, period!
review/text: We only buy organic natural foods without any hydrogenated oil or MSG. These chips are the best we have ever tried. We like the other Garden of Eatin' flavors we have ordered, but these hot spicy blues are the best. Truly if you like spicy you will crave these and nothing else will do. Even our 9-yr-old loves them! As of this writing we are down to 1 bag and they are currently unavailable - Amazon, please BRING THESE BACK!

review/summary: The BAKED version of these chips is misleading and non-tasty
review/text: Has soy grits and flax in it, not what you expect in chips, and not adequately labeled as such when purchasing. Not the usual corn taste, although it has some health benefits. It's just not what I expected/wanted, and won't buy again.

review/summary: A rare low-salt chip
review/text: My wife says that she can taste a mild sweetness from the blue corn -- I cannot.  Honestly they taste like regular corn chips to me.  The difference is that without a thick coating of salt attached, like essentially ever other chip on the market, I _can_ taste what's on top of my chips.<br /><br />Me, I like 'em with nacho cheese.  It's amazing to not have my lips searing from the salt as I eat hot dipping dressings.<br /><br />I wish I didn't have to buy a case at a time to get the good price, but the bags are fairly small, so you'll go through them fast at a party.

review/summary: Garden of FakeLime Detergenty Flavors and other Natural Flavors
review/text: I'm just going to say it: These CHIPS Taste like DETERGENT.<br /><br />Given that Garden of Eatin' blue corn, and red hots chips are my favorite of all time, it's puzzling how they can produce such an unfortunate product as "Chili & Lime".<br /><br />First of all, where's the chili? I don't even taste it. Even tho I'm an advanced chili pepper user, I have a very keen palate. I detect less than 1 part per billion of chili in these here unfortunate chips.<br /><br />Also, I detect fraudulent lime flavors and *that* my friends is an egregious error from such a reknowned company. The red herring that it's NOT natural is "NATURAL FLAVORS WITH LIME". The translation here is that these natural flavors could be really anything, could be any combination of terpene extracts from 'natural sources'. For example, fake lemon flavor in candies and wood detergent is often an extract from lemongrass because it's cheaper than from lemons. But it's a different chemical also. Fake lime is immediately a mistake, and anyone-not just supertasters-can tell.<br /><br />This fakeLime taste, or 'floor detergent flavor', is reminiscent of a childhood fragrance- the strong chemical citrus waft of mopwater that a theater employee was using to mask the rotting popcorn-soda-slurry smell by the dumpster.<br /><br />In other words, it seems as if Garden of Eatin found the cheapest, strongest floor stripping chemicals from Big Lots, extracted the lime scent component and littered it lightly onto these chips.<br /><br />So if you want to mop floor with a tea of these, or you are considering a colon cleanse, accept no substitute.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------<br />Ok so along the lines of constructive criticism:<br /><br />ATTN: Garden of EATIN'<br /><br />Please contact Tostitos sensory labs scientists. It is imperative that you find out how Tostitos makes their hint of lime chips because they got it right. Use at least 500 ppm nanolimeparticles and same same for chili. Coat those suckers with maybe 1/2 to 100% of the rate used for redhotblues.
