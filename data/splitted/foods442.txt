review/summary: Folks these delicious snacks are 3 POINTS on the New Weight Watchers Points plan!!!
review/text: I purchased a bag at a local gourmet deli in NYC because they had about 1/3 the calories of all the kettle fried chips.  First, I was shocked that there was only 1 serving in the bag (even though the measurement says 1 once the bag is bigger than you think).  After calculating the points I decided to give them a try.  Boy am I glad I did!  I almost felt guilty for having soo much to crunch on (there are a lot of these fries in that there bag).  I must reiterate 1 bag (1 oz) is 3 points!!! This is major.  The flavor is great and you will not feel hungry.  I am ordering a bunch of these right away.

review/summary: YUMMY & Low Cal!
review/text: These are really tasty!  I got the 6 type combo pack, which had plain sea salt, vinegar, cheddar, honey mustard and onion, jalepeno and honey barbeque.  The honey barbeque, honey mustard and onion and cheddar are my favorites!  These are similar in texture to the Andy Capp's Hot Fries.  I've lost over 80 lbs and am always on a lookout for low cal, yummy snacks and these fit the bill.  My kids really like these too and I don't feel bad letting them have them because they don't have a lot of fat or calories.  I would like to try the cinnamon ones soon!

I was surprised by the low calories and that the whole bag was one serving, not 3 servings like so many other "low calorie" snacks.

review/text: These SmartFries are so awsome!  With regular chips and bagged snacks you get maybe 10 - 15 per serving, but with SmartFries you get 65 per serving and only 110 calories.  I never even get close to that many though as I usually get my fix in around 20.  If any of you love the Trader Joe's Skinny Fries, then you're in luck because these are the same thing and the same price if purchased in multiple bag packs.  I am a frequent buyer of this product.

review/summary: Good for Low Cal Snack
review/text: I am always dieting and ordered the multi flavor package of these.  I admit I like some flavors more than others.  At first I wasn't sure I liked them because they are so light and airy but they are filling and only 110 calories, 2grams fat, 1g fiber. A filling, crunchy snack bagb you can keep in a desk or in the car that won't wreck a diet but is emotionally satisfying if you need a saltry crunch.  I didn't think I would like the vinegar ones, but I really do.  The sligtly salty ones are the least flavorful in my opinion but sometimes I use dip with them. I will definitely order again.  The bagsv are big and sometimes I only need to eat half to feel satisfied, honestly. (Not like the PopC**ps where I can eat a whole ig bag) Wish I could get them in stores. They grow on you and for me they were worth the money to stay on my diet.

review/summary: love love but take out some salt please!
review/text: I was so excited about receiving these and wow the crunch and flavor is great! 1 ounce for only 110 calories is awesome. At the bottom of the bags though I found a lot of salt so I re-checked the nutritional info and found one bag has 11% of daily intake of salt! That is just too much for me with my BP issues etc. The pop chips are yummy too and only have 6% daily salt.. for a little less than one ounce and the pop tortilla chips are also 6% per 1 oz. bag. With the great taste of the fries you just don't need all that salt anyhow! So to people not worried about their salt intake ( everything else is very healthy) go for it.. but for people like me just be a bit cautious. This was to be my newest best healthy snack but guess I will have to enjoy sparingly and keep on looking. My score would def. been a 5 if not for the extra, in my view, unnecessary salt. Hope this helps!

review/text: I purchased the 1.1 oz.-24 bag variety pack.  I actually didn't care for 2 of the 6 flavors though I realize this is just personal preference.  I thought the other flavors were tasty.  You get a lot of snack for the calorie content.  I think they are very comparable to PopChips but you get a much bigger portion(1.1 oz. of Smart Fries for 110 cal vs. popchips - 100cal for 0.8 oz.). I like PopChips but I'd rather be able to have more snack for the same calories. The Honey Mustard & BBQ flavors are delicious & were my favorite.  If you're a chip addict like I am, this is a good deal.  It was a big enough serving to satisfy my craving without completely blowing my daily calorie intake.  I will definately purchase again.

There should be something fun if you're fighting the calories, and this was perfect! For 110 calories, you get 65 smart fries, and I actually felt full after eating a bag. They're light and crispy and very flavorful. Here's what I thought about the flavors:<br /><br />Honey Mustard and Onion: My fav by far! I can taste the honey dijon and the sweet onions. Delicious!<br />Vinegar Splash: Lots of vinegar flavor!<br />Honey BBQ: More subtle in flavor, but very tasty.<br />Vintage Cheddar: Classic Cheese Curl flavor, light and salty.<br />Sea Salt: allows the potato flavor to shine through. Yum!<br />Jalapeno Trio: I liked this one the least, if I'm going to eat a flavor like this I would want something greasy with it, which would defeat the purpose of a healthy snack!

review/summary: Smart Fries taste great!
review/text: I purchased these for my kids. I am always purchasing alternatives for chips (that they love so much) and I stumbled upon these. I ordered the variety pack so the kids could experience different flavors and they were so happy when they ate them. I usually purchase Pop chips and Pop corners, but I thought these would be a fun change for my kids and I was right. After they each tried their own bag, they immediately told me how much they liked them and almost everyday during the Christmas break they wanted a bag for their afternoon snack. They have tried all the flavors in the variety pack and I have not heard any objections yet. I tried the sea salt, cheddar and salt and vinegar varieties and enjoyed the flavors of each. If you like Pop chips, then chances are you will like these too. Although the seasoning on the fries are not as intense as the flavoring on Pop chips, I still think these are an enjoyable snack for kids and adults.

review/summary: Don't listen to those bad reviews...these are yummy!
review/text: Well first I'll start by saying that those bad reviews are probably from people used to eating full-fat products like Cheese Puffs! If you're the type that's aware that you have to make small sacrafices for a healthy lifestyle, then you will love these. They satisfy my cravings when I need a cruchy, saltly snack. And when i'm craving something sweet...the honey mustard flavor does the trick. I say give em a try! Just got my second order in the mail yesterday.

review/summary: These saved me.
review/text: If you're ever in the mood to just munch on something and not have it kill you in calories, this is it.<br />It has crunch and a little salt. Looking at other reviews, it IS a lot like eating air, but again,<br />for those of us who can't afford to eat a bag of chips, this is the best substitute. You're not going to<br />eat one and be like - WOW. This is the best snack I've ever had. BUT, it's the  best when you're looking to find something crunchy that you can eat while watching a movie. It works for me so well, that when my local BJ's stopped carrying them (which is a sign I know), I had to go directly to the vendor to find where I can get them. Now I have to buy at Trader Joe's and they're much more money now. Still - they work for me like nothing else.<br />I must add I only like the Sea Salt. I've only tried one other flavor and didn't like it. If anyone finds out where I can buy the huge economy sized bag that BJ's used to sell, PLEASE tell me! It's a great deal! I wish they didn't stop selling it...

review/text: I've been looking for low calorie snacks to munch on and I'm glad I found these. I've only tried the honey BBQ so far but the flavor is really great. I expected the consistency to be like that of Hot Fries but they are actually really smooth. You get a ton of them in the bag, too. I usually don't like to buy the 100 calorie Oreo packs because half the bag is air and you're still hungry afterwards but that's not the case with these. Full bag, full of flavor, full belly. I'm happy with the price too so I think I"ll stick with these.

review/summary: Delicious low calorie snack!
review/text: I discovered these on a whim at a discount store and they were surprisingly delicious. They have an awesome crunch and great potato flavor. The best part was the nutrition stats: only 110 calories, 1.5 fat, and 2 fiber per ounce (which is a much larger portion than expected and very satisfying). The original flavor is very good, but could use a touch more salt. The jalapeno is also really tasty: a little sweet, a little smoky, and just a little spicy.

review/summary: These are great but the mix of flavors is not the best
review/text: I love Smart fries so they get 5 stars. However this pack is not the best mix of the flavors. It good if you don't know what you like and want to try 1-2 bags of each different flavor. However, if you know you like certain flavors and are looking for a bunch of them you should just buy the seperate flavor packs.<br /><br />The flavor of the smart fries themselves are amazing. I have been using these as a subsitute for eating other salty or sweet snacks. The whoel bag is only a little over 100 calories and if you swap them out for the right cravings they are going to save you a junk load of calories.<br /><br />The price here is alot better then local stores that I have seen. At my work cafe they have these for about 2 dollars a bag. So anything under 1.50 would have been great but under a dollar a bag that's just awesome. I am planning on stocking up on some of the 1 flavor packs for a long road trip since these are an excellent "snacking food" when your not starving but want to munch :).

review/summary: Great alternative snack!
review/text: Had my first package of these today - the Cheddar.  I was surprised at how many are in the bag.  I was expecting maybe a dozen and it was easily 3-4x that. If you're looking for an alternative to potato chips and greasy stuff that's bad for you, these will do the trick. I'm trying to cut all saturated fat from my diet so having something like this to snack on or to throw a bag in my lunch is going to be great. Great flavor and texture.  Sure they aren't as filling as regular chips but that's kind of the point, right? A full bag should do the trick - it certainly did for me.

I found that flavor to have one awful after-taste to it (and I absolutely LOVE cheese) so the next time I order these I'll choose the 3 flavor pack instead of the 6.  It's too bad that Amazon doesn't give an option to customers to mix and match varieties.

review/summary: Potato Styrofoam Tubes...
review/text: These are nothing like french fries. When you open the bag, a bunch of little tube-shaped flavorless "potato sticks" are staring back at you. They are literally the consistency of styrofoam. Ever had cheese curls? They're the texture of that, but the exterior is smooth. It is extremely odd. Due to the smooth exterior, the "sea salt" (which I find to be remarkably similar to table salt) doesn't stick. So the entire bag is covered in salt, but very little ends up being on the actual "fry"<br /><br />I'm sitting here eating a bag as I type this, and honestly, it's really hard for me to finish. They don't even taste like potato. They taste like paper. Salty paper. I mean if you're into bland and tasteless food, this will be right up your ally. But there are many other healthy alternatives that taste SO much better.

I must say that all the varieties are enjoyable.  However, the BBQ, honey mustard, and plain potato chips or fries stood out in front of the assortment.  This brand's packages are much fuller than others.  The chips or fries have a sweet and spicy, tangy BBQ flavor.  I say they have more of a Memphis than Carolina style BBQ taste.  I would say they will pair with almost any kind of hearty sandwich or make a filling snack.  Yummy!

review/text: I ordered the Variety pack of 24. The only flavor I didn't care for is the Salt and Vinegar but that's only because I don't like that flavor in anything. I gave them to my grandkids and they LOVED them!!<br />I was VERY surprised when I opened a bag and saw how many were in a 1 oz serving! WOW!!! Not like your typical lo-cal/lo-fat snack chip where you get about 10 chips and you're done. I love the texture and everything about these fries. I'm already trying to decide what flavor/flavors to reorder. This is definitely on the top of my snack list.<br />My only suggestion is if a little bit more salt could be added to the Classic Sea Salt flavor. They didn't have quite the flavor punch I was expecting but they were still very good. I think a bit more salt would make them PERFECT!!<br />I'm so glad I came across these fries and I'll definitely spread the word to friends and family.

If anyone wants the recipe let me know!<br /><br />When I first got the bottle and opened it I smelled it....it smells like Pralines. Then I pour my self a sip....it taste like Pralines, with no bad/artificial after taste. But be warned its very sweet. With that said its syrup and your not suppose to use alot. I've seen a sugar free one, but I haven't tried that one.<br /><br />I gave it five stars because it is exactly what it is, and its good. If I knew how to bake I imagine it would be very useful.<br /><br />I wish it was cheaper because everyone we make the drink for wants us to make it when they come over.

You should be aware that Xylitol has a spearmint type sweetness to it. It may alter the taste of some foods because of this trait. I use it in my coffee as a substitute for regular sugar and I am completely satisfied.  You need to add slightly more to get the same level of sweetness, but its close.

review/text: These fart bags are awesome.  Once you step on them they take a few seconds to go off and start smelling so you can make your get away.  Truly awful smelling and a great tool for any practical joker to have in their tool kit.

review/summary: Terrible
review/text: I thought these were a good bargain but these particular models are really bad. I've used fart bags before and these don't small at ALL! They are really weak. The writting has spelling mistakes (who cares) but just feels they are really bad quality. Save your money, buy the better ones.

review/summary: Change is good
review/text: Ramen is a quick and easy meal, you can doctor it up to be fancier and more filling.. or eat it plain if in a hurry.<br /><br />It's a great staple to have in the pantry for quick meals, or emergency situations. All you need is hot water.<br /><br />But... with only a couple of flavors available locally, it got boring. I don't even remember exactly how I ended up on the page with all the Ramen soup flavors but I did.. and I'm glad.<br /><br />I ordered four new flavors that day, and found them all to be very good.<br /><br />The Roast Beef has that hint of roast beef background flavor, I was surprised. It was different enough from the plain beef that I liked it, the plain beef I've never really liked much, only got it so that I wasn't eating only Chicken. This will be one that I'll get again.

review/summary: What do you say in a review about ramen? It's cheap?
review/text: I bought this only because it was on sale for under $5 when I bought it. It isn't necessarily any better than any ramen I have had as I would say that most flavors all taste like ramen.<br /><br />I prefer the beef flavor to this roast beef flavor which is a little over powering but with 1/2 to 3/4 packet it is alright. I am just going to put this in a closet somewhere for food storage in case of an apocalypse and we have no food left and we have already eaten our dead...

review/summary: Good flavor
review/text: I ordered this flavor when I saw it was on Amazon, as most stores in my area do not carry it, and only carry Chicken, Beef, Shrimp and Oriental flavors. I guess there isn't enough demand for other flavors which is sad because the ones Ive tried that they used to have are way better than just Chicken and Beef. I enjoyed this flavor a lot. It is rich and satisfying. It does remind me a lot of roast beef, the flavor is kind of subtle, but is good all the same. I remember I used to be able to get this at the gorcery store and loved it and others such as Pork, Lime Shrimp, etc, sadly I now depend on Amazon for more Ramen variety. Thank you for carrying this and other Ramen, Amazon. I will continue to buy this and other hard to find flavors of Maruchan( like Creamy Chicken and Lime Shrimp, try those, they are delicious) for easy, tasty lunches.

review/summary: Glad I Finally Found This Again!
review/text: I don't know why grocery stores in my area are no longer stocking this particular flavor of ramen, but I'm glad to have found it on Amazon because it's the only flavor my son will eat.  He likes the spicier flavors, but has a health condition that causes great stomach upset if he eats them, so this is a blessing for both of us.  Ramen has always been one of those great little things to have when you need to fix something quick in a pinch, or when you want a lighter meal so we have missed it.  I have to admit that I had some concern about expiration dates buying on line, but it's about a year out so this ramen will be fresh for a good long time.  It was also packaged very well and arrived in great condition!

review/summary: Hmmm... Green Beans!
review/text: Green Beans & low sodium Spam <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E52ZV2">SPAM 25% Less Sodium, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)</a> have turned out to be the simple, tasty & nourishing snack I desire instead of the full meals I used to prepare. Have been looking for something simple with a fresh taste that allows me to remain at home and have it delivered to my door, when involved in creative work.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE - To the one complaining about dents in cans: "HEALTHY" is a State of MIND, and NOT a "state" of the physical symbols you see on earth. The stomach contains ACID for a reason. Everything that goes in is being dissolved. Only what you BELIEVE matters.<br /><br />How do I prepare Green Beans & Spam?<br /><br />(1) I pour the beans into a large storage container, add my mix of Onion powder <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EZZISK">Tone's Onion Powder - 20oz shaker</a>, Garlic powder <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EZSF12">Tone's Garlic Powder (21 oz) - Large Restaurant / Food Service Shaker Top Siz...</a>, Cajun Mix <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EZIEFE">Tone's Cajun Seasoning - 22 oz. shaker</a>, Garlic Salt <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00275QAMI">Olde Thompson California Garlic & Sea Salt, 8.8-Ounce Grinders (Pack of 2)</a>  and Sage <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001XWRL42">Simply Organic Sage Leaf Ground Certified Organic, 1.41-Ounce Containers  (Pack of 3)</a>, before I set it into the fridge.<br /><br />(2) I dump the spam from 2 cans out on a cutting board, cut the longer side 1st in half, and then both halves in half, and again, yielding 8 slices twice. The 16 slices are laid-out flat, when I dust them with garlic powder, onion powder & paprika <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001XWRNCW">Simply Organic Paprika Ground Certified Organic, 2.96 Ounce Containers  (Pack of 3)</a> for easy browning. I then use a large non-stick pot, bottom filled with Olive oil <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPQRUC">Carapelli Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 44-Ounce Plastic Bottles (Pack of 2)</a> and heat the pot on the highest setting. As soon as  I enter the slices, I turn off the power, and then turn all the slices, and set 8 each in a container of suitable size to be refrigerated, after they browned enough. These 16 slices last for 4 days.<br /><br />For each meal, I spoon green beans and a slice of spam in a microwavable bowl, also open a can of Tomato with Jalapenos <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039KDRCQ">Ro-Tel Diced Tomatoes Hot, 10-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> tasting better and fresher than any other canned hot salsa, and great with green beans and spam.

review/summary: Very tasty
review/text: These bars (all of the roll types) are hard to eat. That's actually part of why I like them so much. Because they take some effort to bite into and chew, they basically force you to eat slower. As a result, you feel more satisfied at the end of eating one than if you had scarfed down a candy bar in three bites. I don't find them hard as rocks though, just very chewy. If you don't like chewy food, then these are definitely not for you. I also really like the texture contrast between the crunchy/crispy outside and the chewy nougat inside of the bar.<br /><br />There is a bit of a mess factor involved in eating these, as noted by one reviewer. The caramel is sticky and sometimes leaves traces on the wrapper, and the outside crispy/crunchy coating tends to crumble off a bit. If you want to keep the inside of your car spotlessly clean, you might not want to chow down on a Go-Lean roll bar while driving. Nevertheless, I still think these are some of the best bars out there. They are not discernibly chalky nor do they have a strange chemical aftertaste the way that many protein or energy bars do. They really are like fortified candy bars. And they pack quite a high protein and fiber punch for only 190 calories each, while only having about 13 mg of sugars--about 1 Tablespoon--per bar (I was expecting more like 25-30 mg when I tried my first one). The chocolate turtle roll is my favorite flavor, but honestly, I've tried every single flavor of the Go-Lean Roll bars, and they are really all quite good.

review/text: These are surprisingly filling and pretty close to candy bar tasty. I sometimes have a Zone Perfect bar for lunch but it's hard to make it to the end of the day without feeling famished; these Kashi bars keep me satisfied up to dinner time. As others have said, they are quite chewy, which I like, and the nut/grain coating has a good crunchy texture. Know that if you try to wolf one of these down quickly, the crunchy coating makes for a pretty effective abrasive against the roof of your mouth... in other words, chew slowly!<br /><br />Amazon's price per-bar is quite high compared to just a pack of 4 that you can find in big-box stores.

review/summary: Too chewy and dry
review/text: If you have dentures or braces or loose teeth, don't try to eat these.  The first time I bit into one, I was unprepared for the resistance I met, which resulted in a small battle with the bar complete with slobbering and growling.  Note to self--do not eat in public.  My solution is to microwave the bar--after removing the foil wrapper!--to soften up the caramel.  The taste is decent--and may or may not be worth the struggle of actually consuming it.  Personal decision, I suppose.

I didn't mind finishing as it did taste like peanut and somewhat like caramel but it's so darn hard that I couldn't give it better than a 3.  I don't want to lose teeth eating these things.  High in carbs and sugars so definitely will spike your insulin level big time.  I'd probably rather have a regular nut roll for that many carbs and sugars...
