review/summary: Love Sheffa Savory Bars
review/text: I do not like or crave sweets very often. I always gravitate towards savory foods. I like the idea of bars for snacks and meal replacements, but I could not stomach the always sweet bars. I found these advertised in a magazine and ordered a case from amazon immediatley. I was sort of nervous that these would taste bland. These bars are actually delicious! They have just the right amount of spice and are savory, not sweet. Loaded with fiber and great taste. I love these bars for snacks when I am on the go and unable to stop for food. The best part? They are gluten free.

review/summary: BEST NEW CHIPS!!
review/text: These new chips are AMAZING!! Instead of the classic junk food chips which I normally used to eat in front of the TV, these chips are the perfect replacement. They have the same amount of calories as a bag of chips (140) but they have 15 g of protein! The high protein keeps me fuller, longer, and I stop snacking after one bag. Oh, and they taste great too! They are also low in sugar (only 2g!), gluten free, vegan, and kosher. Perfect snack when you are on the go, or just chilling at home and want something to munch on. Definitely LOVE these chips!

review/summary: Quite good with milk.
review/text: Although these do not have the texture of regular honey maid Graham crackers they are still quite tasty. Not too sweet with more honey taste than regular styles though. They do not melt in your mouth and are roughly the size of a quarter so I would not recommend letting your infant or toddler have any unless they were crushed or wet. They can become lodged in the throat. But in bowl of milk with a spoon is delicious.

review/summary: Wonderful tea; my absolute favorite!!
review/text: This tea is delicious either hot or cold.  Its aroma is so wonderful and soothing that it would be worth brewing even if you didn't drink it.<br /><br />I love to drink it year-round, and I just wish it were available through Subscribe & Save!<br /><br />If only Celestial Seasonings would ALSO make a decaff version of this tea, I could enjoy it in the evening as well.  (I'm super-sensitive to caffeine).  But at least this "regular" version is a great start to my day.<br /><br />Since I sometimes have trouble finding Nutcracker Sweet at a reasonable price, I occasionally "stretch" it by brewing it thus:  1 bag of Nutcracker Sweet + 1 bag of PG Tips + 3 cups of boiling water.  The two teas complement each other very nicely.<br /><br />When it's iced, sweetened with Xylitol (which dissolves best while the tea is still warm), and laced with a bit of milk or Half & Half, it satisfies me more than most desserts.  I even know some people who add a drop of Irish Cream....

review/summary: An excellent tea!
review/text: I bought this on a whim because it was on sale.  How fortuitous!  It's one of the best-tasting teas I've ever had, and I'll definitely buy it again.<br /><br />It's black tea, which means that it's caffeinated, so it's a great late-night studying drink during Finals Week, and a toothsome alternative to coffee.  It tastes a lot like gingerbread to me, and I suppose this is supported by the vanilla and cinnamon aromas.  It smells so good that I keep going to my cupboard and opening up the box just to smell it again.  It *tastes* like there's sugar in it, but the ingredients list doesn't register any, so the spices must do all the work.<br /><br /> In summary: a superlative and sweet tea!

review/summary: SO STINKY- DOGS GO NUTS!
review/text: Our vet sells these so I grabbed them in bulk.  My dogs go insane for these little treats.  I personally believe it is because they are really smelly so it gets their slobber going!<br /><br />My best advise is to take them and shove them into rawhides or other items that you want a long chew.  Great bang for the buck, 2 of these little treats shoved into the ends of rawhide rolls gives both dogs a good 45 min of chew time.<br /><br />They make a cat version too that our cats totally dig.  BEWARE- these kind of treats must be locked up or they will be eaten.

review/summary: Almost as good as my memories
review/text: I purchased the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I4L0ZW">Cadbury Curly Wurly 1oz</a> (which from a hair point of view has icky connotations) because the author of a candy nostalgia slideshow claimed they were like my much beloved, horribly missed Marathon bars.  Now, what they lack in texture, they almost make up for in quality.  This is nice Cadbury milk-chocolate and caramel, not the brittle, purposely soured milk of M&M/Mars (if you didn't know why you keep eating M&M's, it's because the slightly soured milk in the milk chocolate leaves an aftertaste that you try to cover with . . . more candy.  Genius!  Evil, but genius.).  However, the original Marathon bar was a much thinner braid with no lumpy parts, and it could really get some stretch on it if you wanted to.  If I had a real Marathon bar and a Curly Wurly side-by-side in the present and had to choose, it might go to Curly Wurly, but memory is a powerful thing and the Marathon bar is right up there with McDonald's deep fried cherry pies, FallsBrand hotdogs with warmed mustard relish, and Sunkist Natural soda--magic foods of the past that become even more powerful as legends.  I've been off soda for 1.5 years, but will gladly go back on if there is a Sunkist Natural substitute.

Problem is that the meat was not frozen like it should be when being shipped from one location to the next and the frozen packs that are suppose to keep the meat cold were completely defrozen. The meat was not even cool to the touch. If I had been gone for the day that meat would have been outside all day and would be rotten. Cosidering what I paid for that is completely unacceptable not to mention disgusting. I put this meat in my freezer immediately but this meat should have been frozen in the first place. I really don't think I will eat it. Buyer please beware!

review/summary: a true blood sausage
review/text: This Boudin Noir arrived surprisingly fast and in perfect condition. It is a blood sausage for real lovers of blood sausage - all natural ingredients, good spice mixture, and LOW FILLER content. The potential downside is that with so little filler (e.g. rice, oatmeal, or potato in most such sausages - largely just onion and fat in this product) there is a lot of congealed blood, which gives it a fine grainy texture that can be unexpected. I for one really like this sausage and plan to order it again sometime in the future.

The problem with the product is that it is an eastern european wurst,I believe it is called a gurka ,not a french blood sausage., had rice and other sort of meat not blood,one should not try to sell a northern european  this product as a blood sausage.  Also it was advertised as being a les delices product,and that it was not!  Five dollars is a lot to pay for each sausage,not including shipping.  PS I live about 2 hrs from the store.

Also has a lower acidic level than other coffees and is gentle on the stomach. Does not cause the usual heartburn or upset stomach other coffees can. One word of caution however: It can become very addictive! It's sooooo GOOD you want cup after cup after cup after cup! It's a wonderful way to start each morning! With Jamacian Me Crazy in your cup you're deliriously happy and ready to start the day! Also great in the evening as an after dinner drink. No need for dessert with Jamacian Me Crazy!

review/summary: Check ingredients before purchasing!!
review/text: The labeling debate continues ... Natural... Doesn't mean it's natural to consume! How can a product geared towards children that boasts 'made with real fruit and vegetable juice' also contain an ingredient that among other things, prohibits the normal absorption of vitamins and is used to clean industrial products? Please search 'mineral oil' before purchasing Motts products. There are healthy gummy alternatives out there or you can offer actual fruit and vegetables at snack time. I am referring specifically to Mott's Medleys assorted fruit fruit flavored snacks. Let's keep our kids healthy!!!

Course, as an adult, one might actually want to eat two or three packs before they feel sated, there should be larger packets of this product. Overall fun and yummy.

review/summary: Decent
review/text: Soy nuts are never going to be anyone's idea of comfort food.  No one's ever going to come home at the end of a hard day and say, "Man, I could go for a beer and some soy nuts!"  If you're eating these, it's probably because you're trying to find something to take the place of a much-less-healthy snack that you'd otherwise be eating.<br /><br />All that being said, these aren't half bad.  They are, as another reviewer noted, somewhat chalky.  You will want to have something to drink with these -- preferably water.  The flavor of these is pretty good, though.  Barbecue is the best of the various flavors these come in.  One problem with the soy nuts is that the manufacturer hasn't seemed to figure out how to get the flavoring powder to stick well to the soy nuts.  Because of this, a lot of the powder falls off, and the flavor has to be reasonably strong for you to taste it.  Barbecue makes it pretty well, whereas some of the other available flavors don't.<br /><br />Once again, these aren't bad.  I don't know if I'll buy them again, though.  I MUCH prefer Genisoy's soy crisps, which are genuinely awesome, and almost as healthy.

review/summary: Good, but not great.
review/text: As with most soy products, the Zesty BBQ Soy Nuts are a bit "chalky." The best solution is to eat these nuts along with a good drink.<br /><br />The nuts are crunchy and taste similar to any other bbq'd flavor product(chips, etc). The macro-nutrient balance in this product is terrific(4 grams of fat, 9 grams of carbs(5 being fiber), and 12 grams of protein.<br /><br />I have added this product as a replacement for potato chips. I've founded that combining half soy nuts, half peanuts is a great way to balance nutrition and taste. Definately give that a try!

review/text: Tried these out thinking they would be a healthy snack substitute for peanuts. The taste and texture really are no comparison to a peanut, they are far inferior. The seasoning they put on these tastes good enough, but its incredibly messy and after eating just a few you will have a thick coating on your fingers. Even a napkin isn't enough to clean up your hands, you will have to wash them afterwards. I was disappointed in these and wish I had sampled at a store before burdening myself with 12 bags of them. Do yourself a favor and don't order these unless you've had them before and the taste, texture and mess are acceptable to you.

review/summary: CATNIP
review/text: After several attempts to engage my aged cat with this catnip I finally filled an old nylon stocking with it.  Now that she can smell it more intensely she is quite content.  I love to watch her doze off.  Slowly the eyes close, then the head drops, the lips may or may not part, the tongue may or may not protrude, but always the head drops until her chin sits on her stocking filled with catnip.  I think it may be equally entertaining for me.<br /><br />A side note:  Until recent years, and still in many part of the world, people have drunk catnip tea (usually in the afternoons) for its relaxing qualities. It is a member of the mint family and quite safe.  It can also be used as a mint would be used in foods.

I put out some of our older stuff to alleviate the disappointment and received the usual happy reaction to catnip. For whatever reason, this catnip was a dud for all three of my cats.

review/text: I used this yeast to make a batch of dry mead and it came out very well. The initial signs of fermentation were very delayed, took mine almost 3 days to make a single bubble. However, that is most likely due more to the slightly low temperature in my house. Once fermentation started things picked up quickly and everything went to plan. I ended up with a great tasting mead with a slightly fruity taste, this coming solely from the yeast. If you want a dry mead get this, if you want a sweet mead I'd go with something else.

review/summary: Dark and Savory Brew
review/text: I don't write many reviews.  I'm not so good with words.  Every once in a while a product comes along that demands a great review.  The BackCountry Mud Coffee is one of those products.  I love coffee.  I am 56 years old.  I started brewing coffee in a percolator(with Chock Full O'Nuts coffee) when I was 12.  It was a Sunday morning gift to my parents.  If you think making a good cup of coffee is difficult theses days, try brewing Chock Full O'Nuts in a percolator.  Leave the pot on the stove for an extra 30 seconds and the coffee becomes undrinkable black tar. Put the flame up a little too high and the pot would overflow leaving on the stove a lake of coffee grounds.  I learned early that brewing coffee was an art.<br /><br />I left the Chock Full O'Nuts behind a long time ago, but I still like my coffee strong.  The key is the coffee must be strong and smooth, not strong and bitter.  Often I have found myself cutting a bitter french roast with a less acidic coffee like sumatra in order to make it palatable.  Not so with this brew.  The BackCountry boys have managed to create a blend that is strong, flavorful and smooth - Perfect -  and as we used to say back in the mid 1960s.....Good to the Last Drop.  Enjoy

review/text: The beans seem fresh, which is excellent. They also seem to be of high quality. It brews a strong and fragrant cup, a quality I like. I didn't like this coffee very much, but it was in the roasting. I prefer dark/ French roasts, but this one tastes a little burned - or maybe I should say half of the beans tasted burned (half the beans are darker than the other half). I'm not sure if the burned taste is purposeful or not (it's described as "rugged" and is "cowboy" coffee). I like the general quality of the beans well enough to order a different type of dark roast from this company. The packaging is minimal (in a good way, no waste) and helps to keep the beans fresh.

I tried to knead it, but was only able to knead the very center portion as the rest was so dry and hard that I could not move it. I tasted it and had to spit it out. It was horrible. I had a friend, who is a professional baker, look at it and taste it.  She had to spit it out, as well.  It just was not edible and I was not able to use it. I had to throw the entire can in the garbage and come up with a replacement at the last minute.  I would never waste my money on this again. I do not recommend anyone buy this product. I love marzipan, but this was horrible.

review/summary: My favorite Olive Oil
review/text: I was so happy to find this oil on Amazon!  I had been ordering through a local restaurant in Massachusetts after seeing the small colorful cans on their dining tables and tasting it on salads.  I love the olive oil and I love the scenes depicted on the cans.  We toured Italy last year and this invokes such pleasant memories of our trip.

review/text: The attractive packaging and customer reviews made me very eager to try this. I have recently learned the joys of dipping French bread into seasoned olive oil and had hoped this would be spectacular. It was anything but. I said it was insipid. Another member of my family said it even tasted "tinny". It really wasn't pleasant at all.<br />I will use it to cook with but really couldn't stomach it fresh. I got it on auto delivery and I'm cancelling that right now.

review/summary: Great tasting healthy alternative to coconut oil
review/text: This popcorn tastes great and is comparable to the Great American brand. Even better it uses healthier sunflower oil and not coconut oil. As to the other reviews that state it's too salty, you can find the same type of reviews with many of these pre-measured packets. The good thing about this brand (as well as several others) the ingredients are separated, so you can adjust to your own taste. I don't like very much salt on my popcorn so I use 1/4 to 1/2 of the salt packet. If others are over that like saltier popcorn I get mine, and then sprinkle some more on the rest. As for reviews saying the popcorn is "chewy" I belive that's more the timing of heating the oil & the quality of the machine. I've done multiple taste tests with guests (as we have tried several pre-packaged brands) and this wins more frequently than others. But for me the clincher is the sunflower oil. If you want a great visual effect, put some coconut oil based mixture and sunflower oil based mixture in two clear jars and store a little below room temperature -- around 60 degrees. You'll find a solid block of oil with the cococut mixture, while the sunflower oil mixture is still liquid & see through. Not exactly what I want stuck in my arteries.

review/text: Coconut Oil is so tasty, it goes great with anything sweet. I use it on a piece of bread with honey, so good. It is also good for Asian style sweet dishes, gives an excellent flavor. If you using it as a dietary supplement by taking a tablespoon; it can be quite difficulty to swallow because of the texture. One thing about this oil is it doesn't refrigerate well and at 76 Fahrenheit it melts completely.

review/summary: Awesome Stuff !!
review/text: This was my first time to try coconut oil, other than using the red kind for popcorn. [which works great in a Stir Crazy] I will be repeating what many have said, but just to add my thoughts....I hope Amazon stocks this FOREVER !!  Smells lovely, like coconut, reminds me of the beach. At room temperature, it is solid....and if I have one tiny complaint, it can be a little difficult to spoon out of the jar. I don't want to soften/melt it each time I need a teaspoonful, so I struggle a bit and scoop it out.<br /><br />  On toast or English muffins, you can use it just like butter, but it seems to have a much more pleasant taste, and leaves the bread more crispy, {never soggy like butter can sometimes pool on toast in little patches.} To use making scrambled eggs or an omelet, it's easy to use, just like any oil, and adds no real discernible taste to me. It's great to just take some and rub on your skin, you then smell wonderful, and it soaks right in....leaving your skin smooth and silky. I have dry skin, and using this coconut oil or almond oil is something that has changed my life....tossing out all the "off the shelf" lotions that never really helped.<br /><br />  Only time will tell if all the health benefits pan out for me. But I enjoy using this instead of butter, and plan to continue to do so. The price is great here on Amazon, especially on Subscribe and Save. It was delivered quickly, although it was just tossed into a large box, and allowed to roll around in transit, which I thought was strange packaging. But it was undamaged, and still solid, no evidence of leakage in the box.<br /><br />  I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to try healthier oils, and anyone with dry skin. I read online that this can be mixed with garlic oil and Vit. E liquid to make a healing ointment. There is a lot of info online regarding the positives of coconut oil, and Dr. Oz recommends it, for what that is worth to you.

review/summary: Gotta Love Amazon
review/text: This product is simply amazing. It is a much better value on Amazon than anywhere else I have seen. I recently went to an over-priced "Parisian" hair salon to get a keratin treatment and it left my long, natural hair severely damaged, breaking, and feeling like straw. Yes, I am still miffed. My sister insisted that I ditch all the expensive treatments and commercial products and just let my hair go natural and treat it with coconut oil which she uses on her gorgeous, long, black tresses. In desperation, I ordered several bottles. They came surprisingly fast and I immediately tore open the box and after inhaling the euphoric aroma for a half a minute, I slathered it on my hair and scalp and left it on all day (while indoors). After I washed it off, my hair was visibly silkier, shinier, and had much less breakage. I'm in love! Also, I use it on my skin and it absorbs well and leaves my skin supple with a slight smell of coconut. Love the price, love the product. Can't go wrong.

I do like the see through container this one has though a bit better since you can see exactly how much you have left a little easier. I use the oil for my GI tract since I have several issues with it and have difficulty with handling and absorbing fats. I try to eat at least a tblsp a day, usually spread on toast, it's excellent as a spread. I use it in baking in place of butter and other oils and sometimes for cooking too.

review/summary: What "Extra Virgin" label  mean for coconut ?????
review/text: If the label say "Cold Pressed" and "Organic", it would make more sense to me than saying "Extra Virgin"  blah blah blah because this "Extra Virgin" theme is borrowed from the olive oil) and which does not make any sense for coconut. The "Extra Virgin" label is just for marketing purpose and to make the product itself more appealing to buyer.<br />I have no way to verify if this coconut oil is truly organic or cold pressed, since I wasn't in Philippine at the time they made it, but<br />I hope they are honest.<br /><br />Anyway,<br />I like the taste of this oil, I mix it with peanut butter, and I wish if I can find a coconut oil with a stronger coconut taste. For me the coconut taste is not strong enough. I tried different brand from amazon, and all has the same taste. I tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E1MI">Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 29-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)</a> and has the same taste as this one, except this Nature's oil brand is sometime cheaper<br />I like it, and will keep doing so as long as they offer it at a competitive price.
