review/summary: Perfect Dessert Tea - Baby Bear
review/text: I'm not a coffee drinker and got tired of not having something to drink with a dessert. This tea is perfect with milk and sugar! I feel like a grown up when I drink it. Don't get me wrong I know I could just drink hot chocolate and I do but sometimes depending on what I have it with or when, hot chocolate is too sweet. Which feels hypocritical for me to say because that's how I like it, but only when it is the dessert. So this is my perfect medium. It's like a term I like to use, it's baby bear! We all know the story of Goldie Locks and the three bears. Well coffee is pappa bear's bed, too hard to get over the bitterness. Hot chocolate is mamma bear's bed, too soft or sweet for everyday. This tea is baby bear's bed, just right. Now I'm no Goldie Locks but I'd like to think of myself as that content when I drink this tea. Love it!

review/text: OK its tea right!  Well, it's good.  Stash makes some really great teas.  This one is pretty good, probably one of the best on the market right now.  Much better than bigelow's teas, in my opinion.

review/summary: Love It or Leave It!
review/text: From reading other reviews, it seems people either hate or love this tea with no in-between.  I happen to love it...am here to re-order.<br /><br />Last year this product disappeared from local stores so I reluctantly ordered this box of 6 ... good grief-so many! Surprisingly, barely a year has passed and I'm out (in spite of having an average of 4-6 other favorite boxes of tea open at any one time).<br /><br />As with most teas, the flavor definitely improves with a bit of milk or cream (my favorite) or honey (with the milk or instead of ...). Sometimes I brew two bags at once...my favorite: this vanilla nut with Trader Joe's Organic Mint Melange.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Great version of Chai tea
review/text: This is far and away my favorite Chai tea to drink.  It is meant to be served with some type of sweetener and milk (which it recommends on the box).  I prefer to standard Chai.  I have this sitting next to a box of Tazo Chai, and I am always grabbing a bag of the Stash Decaf Vanilla Chai.

review/summary: Smooth and delicious
review/text: I've been drinking Stash teas for some time now but usually stuck to their caffeinated versions.  Once I found out I was pregnant, I made the switch to decaf and was happy to find that Stash has a nice selection of flavored decaf black teas.  However, this tea in particular is a favorite.<br /><br />In order to really bring out the flavors, I would suggest adding some milk and a sweetener (I usually use honey and if I do use sugar, I use turbinado sugar).  This makes the tea very smooth and creamy, something close to a tea latte.  The flavor is nicely chocolaty with just the right touch of hazelnut, which I find to be overpowering in large quantities.  I often drink this tea as a dessert-like indulgence but it would also be good in the morning in place of a flavored coffee.

review/summary: Good, mild green
review/text: I am an avid tea drinker and so I was at a bit of a loss when I became pregnant.  I wanted to cut caffeinated tea out of my diet during the pregnancy but soon found that meant my choices were limited to herbals and a small handful of decaf black teas, which were mostly flavored.  One day I came across this one at the grocery store and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />I've long enjoyed Stash teas for their quality, which is pretty incomparable.  I generally prefer loose teas to bagged but Stash is one of those rare teas whose flavor isn't compromised by the bag.  I found this to be the case with this particular tea.  It's not a very complex flavor, which is why I wouldn't give it a full five stars.  However, it is very mild and has a nice, subtle nutty flavor.  It's definitely a good tea for those who are new to greens as when it's brewed appropriately it has none of the bitterness or strong grassy flavor that can sometimes come through in greens.  It's an easy drinking tea and I sip it throughout the day, to the point where I drink around three oversized mugs of it a day.  In light of this, I now order it by the 6-pack from Amazon in order to have a continuous supply.

review/summary: Great tasting Tea
review/text: This is a great tasting Tea that is unfortunately no longer on the store shelves in my area.<br /><br />It tastes sort of like a creamy hot cocoa. So it's a great replacement if, like me you're lactose intolerant. It also comes in regular I believe for those who need their caffeine fix :)<br /><br />Also of note is that each tea bag is individually sealed in a foil package so the last bag is as fresh as the first. I've seen a lot of tea companies switch to loose bags and they get old quickly after you open the box. These are always fresh.

review/summary: chocolate hazelnut tea
review/text: The first time I tried it I was kind of dissapointed. It just tasted like chocolate flavored water. I brewed it a second time and got better results. You have to steep it till you get it kind of strong, add quite a bit of sugar and milk, and it is quite good, for a tea. I think that was the problem, I expected hot chocolate - you can't get hot chocolate from a tea. I would rather drink ovaltine, if I want something that tastes chocolatey. It does smell wonderful. I gave it four stars as a tea, and not especially as a hot chocolate drink.

review/text: This is my favourite tea in the world. The taste is unique: chocolate with hazelnut. If you're a chocoholic like myself, you'll love this tea. Plus it's decaf, so you can have as many as you like.

review/summary: Not bad for a decaf green
review/text: As someone who loves Japanese-style green tea, I highly recommend Stash's regular green tea. That's why I ordered their green decaf. However, this decaf does not have the same qualities as their regular green tea. The tea is not green in color -- it is more of a brownish color -- and it doesn't have that fresh "green" taste I enjoy with their caffeinated version.  Maybe green tea just doesn't keep its color or flavor when it is decaffeinated.  It's not too bad though, and I'll have to keep trying it to see if it grows on me.  I actually have not found the perfect green decaf yet.<br /><br />PS: After a long period of thinking I didn't like it, then going back to try it again, it may not be as bad as I first thought.  Most green decafs disappoint, so don't consider any green decafs as having true green tea flavor.  Stash's isn't objectionable like some, it's just bland.  It's a bit better than most green decafs, but not nearly as good as good Japanese caffeinated green tea.  For true green tea taste, try a Japanese Sencha or Macha caffeinated tea, like Kirkland's Signature Macha or Yamamotoyama teas.  I very much DISlike the Stash Organic Premium Decaf Green however, and urge you not to buy it. I have a concern about the levels of fluoride in green teas (especially Chinese teas, so I've read), but I suppose if consumed in moderation, like everything else, the risks shouldn't be of great concern, and the benefits probably outweigh them.

review/summary: My cure for morning coffee
review/text: My doctor recently suggested (strongly) that I cut out my 3+ cups of coffee per day. Now mind you, I am a Starbucks drinker. I LOVE my coffee and I have for years. I told my doctor and myself that this was not possible. However, I re-thought and considering my health issues, I decided to take the plunge, so to speak. . . into the No-coffee, no caffeine pool. But what to substitute on those cold mornings??? I have enjoyed Stash Chai tea for a few years but it was always a treat for winter days when I was already over-coffeed. I tried many teas to see if anything satisfied to replace for my morning joe. Nothing, truly, Nothing satisfied my taste buds, my comfort buttons...my need for a stimulating aroma. Until. . . I went back to my STASH Chai. Decaf as it is, it satisfies all my taste and aroma needs and we are now 7 months out and I declare myself fully De-coffee'd. I no longer need that cup of jolt any longer and I am fully satisfied by my STASH decaf chai. I am amazed and delighted! I want to stock up on my tea, lest they stop making it! Heaven forbid! I get my STASH with the regular subscription monthly. Can't be without my STASH Decaf Chai!

This does not taste like vanilla or nut to me, it is kind of fruity and has a bad aftertaste.

I even sweetened my tea with molasses to sweeten it, and it didn't even mask the taste very well. Word of advice try any other tea flavors from Stash but this.

review/text: All the ladies at my office LOVE this tea. I introduced a coworker to it and she convinced me to buy several boxes for the office. I just bought a box last Friday and today (Monday) it is half gone! The flavor is not super chocolatey, but has a delicate chocolate taste to it with creamy hazelnut notes. It's great with a splash of almond milk and a tiny bit of sugar. This and Mighty Leaf's chocolate mint truffle tea are my two favorite afternoon teas. When I'm craving something sweet, I just have a cup of this tea and it satisfies my sweet tooth and my chocolate cravings all at once. Again, if you're looking for a really chocolatey drink, this tea isn't anything like, for example, hot chocolate. It's just a hint of chocolatey and nutty flavor.

review/summary: THE ONLY TEA I DRINK!
review/text: Like others, I too have a big issue with caffeine.  And, most decaf teas are dull. Even the other Chai Teas (in other brands) didn't taste as good as Stash's Chai Tea decaf does.  So, this is the only tea that I drink!  It starts me off every morning.  I add 3 packets of the Natra Taste sweetener and some milk and it's just delicious!<br /><br />I love the flavor.  I do not find it heavy in clove, or cinnamon or anything.  I find this a very nicley well-balanced, flavored tea.  Of all the Chai Teas on the market (reg. or decaf) I love Stash's blend the best of all.<br /><br />I was buying it regularly at my Safeway grocery, and then for some reason, it just wasn't around anymore. In fact, there wasn't any decaf tea at all in the store.  Geez!  So, then I went over to the Giant (a longer drive), and was buying it there.  Suddenly, it's not there anymore either. Geez!<br /><br />Thank God I found it on-line.  So, these people have me now as a loyal customer and I hope this is going to be available for a long, long time.

review/summary: First Time Tea Drinker
review/text: I never drank tea before, then a friend bought me a Chai Tea latte.  I liked it.  I didn't know what brand would taste the most like what was bought from this coffee/tea stand.  I liked that Stash has a decaf, because I intended to have it as an evening drink so I went with that.<br /><br />Day one, I didn't steep it long, yet it tasted very strong.  I added skim milk as that is what I use, which did not help it along since it's not rich, also I added sugar as it's supposed to be a sweet drink.<br /><br />Day 2, I bought regular soy milk, no low fat or no vanilla soy since the tea has vanilla.  I didn't steep the tea as long, I used a bit more water, then added 1/4 of a cup of soy milk along with 2 good sized teaspoons of sugar.  It tasted perfect! I think I could probably reuse the tea bag today for my 3rd cup!<br /><br />Reviews can be off when people do not use a product properly, and maybe other users are used to a different brand, as I have seen other brands with different ingredients.  I'm happy with it, to where I don't feel the need anymore to try another tea, since at first, I thought I may have to.  I have a local store that sells items at a good price.  18 bags were $2.69, so I have no reason to buy it in bulk online.  I think I'd save 8 cents on a 3 month supply, then there's shipping.

Previous posters are right:  it's a delicate brew that should be steeped only for up to a minute (two if you're brave) in sub-boiling water.  Any longer brings out a strong bitter taste thanks to the very young tea.

review/text: I gave up coffee a little more than a year ago, and have been, shall I say adventurous in my pursuit of an alternative. I've become a fanatic tea drinker, and find that only those with natural ingredients are worthy. Stash makes a phenomenal lemon ginger tea- but this chocolate hazelnut, although full bodied, leaves a bad taste in my mouth- an aftertaste, that is. I believe it has to do with the fact that it has natural "flavors". No real chocolate or hazelnut here folks. I gave 3 stars because of the quality of the tea.

review/summary: Love the Flavor
review/text: Stash Chocolate Hazelnut tea is my new favorite variety (and I drink a lot of tea). I bring the water just to the point where it starts to boil and then I pour. I let it steep for about 3 minutes and drink it hot. I added a half packet of stevia and a dash of milk to this tea and loved the results. It tastes rich and smooth and for me is a great substitute for hot chocolate. I could definitely taste the chocolate, but the nut flavor was less noticeable. I especially like that it's decaf, so I can drink it in the evenings while I'm relaxing with a book. I haven't tried it iced or without milk, but I plan to. I've tried other Stash teas and thought they were superior to most other brands I've tried.

I think most of the reviewers who hated it already had their own favorite vanilla-nut tea and found this tea different from what they expected?<br /><br />I usually dislike Stash Teas, but this flavor is just so pleasant and homey. Add some sugar and milk and it's a real treat. I agree with the reviewer who found it reminiscent of hot cocoa. It does have a tiny chemical smell, or maybe that's the vanilla. I have a poor sense of smell. It's a very cozy winter tea, but I like it too much to not have it all year 'round.

review/text: These sunflower seeds are larger than the standard sunflower seeds you can usually find in your local supermarket (usually the David's brand in my area) so there's more inner seed to eat.  There's also a lighter coating of salt from the brine wash on them, so while there's enough salt to make things tasty, your lips aren't going to go numb from all the salt quite as quickly as with the other brand.  The shells are easy to crack with your teeth, and they break cleanly; also the bags are filled with full-shelled seeds - there are very few broken ones.<br /><br />I devoured the first batch I ordered, and I'm now ordering a second batch.  If you like snacking on sunflower seeds, I think you'll like these.

review/summary: Best on a cold winter night with a book
review/text: It's hard to believe that I've been drinking Sleepytime tea for almost 18 years. My parents are avid tea drinkers and started giving my brothers and I sleepytime tea at night when we all turned 8.  Winter nights were spent in front of a fireplace reading a book with a cup of sleepytime tea. No matter where I am, when I have that cup of tea I know I'll sleep great.<br /><br /> It doesn't make me super drowsy, to where I couldn't drive if I needed to, but this tea is what makes the end of my day so worth looking forward to. No matter how crazy the day is, there's a cup of sleepytime at the end of it all and pages from a great book.<br /><br /> This tea is so amazingly tasteful and aromatic, it just SMELLS relaxing.  The sweet smell of "Egyptian chamomile, cool spearmint from the Pacific Northwest, and lively Guatemalan lemongrass" make this tea one of the most amazing tea's I've ever drunk, and makes just about anyone who's ever tried it a lover. From my good friend and her husband, to my own husband (who doesn't drink anything hot but hot coco) and our friends, this tea has been passed down from my parents and will continue to be passed to my children. It's a great tea that becomes a tradition quickly.<br /><br />It's great hot, warm, or cold - and is also available in a "throat tamer" version in the pillow's for the times when you've got a sore throat too!

At the time, my main requirement was no caffeine, so I thought a nice herbal tea would fit the bill. I was pleasantly surprised. The tea is a nice mild mint with some chamomile. It needs no sweetener, is delightful any time of day or night. I wouldn't say it makes me sleepy, but it has a relaxing effect, perfect for anytime you need a little de-stressing time.

review/summary: Overpriced?
review/text: Unless this is a misprint, they are charging almost double plus high postage for the same pod tea you can get elsewhere on the net for much, much less. They are charging approx. $41.95 for 48 pods. Elsewhere the pods cost between $9.95-13.95 for 24 pods, plus $7.49 postage. Most other places also waive postage if you buy more than $50,00 worth but this place doesn't. Either this is a misprint and it's $42.00 for four packages of 25 pods each (96 pods) as it is at the cheapest site I found on the net, or this is a massive ripoff. Hope it's the former.

review/summary: First Colony Coffee
review/text: Very disappointing.  I have purchased this in the past from the First Colony website and it was very good.  The coffee in this purchase was very bitter and did not have any cinnamon flavor or cinnamon sticks mixed in with the beans as it had in the past .  We are throwing it all out.  A complete waste of money.  I would not purchase from White coffee again.

review/text: I will not give this coffee five stars. I haven't had a five star cup of coffee in a very long time. This is a very good coffee. The beans I received were very fresh, none of that stale, musty odor that you sometimes get (most recently with Fogbuster). Good oil content, beans uniform and firm. The taste is rich and slightly bold yet smooth. I paid $27.00 for 5 lbs. from Amazon Subscribe and Save and I see it is now almost $42.00. Honestly, that's not a good enough "buy" for me.

review/summary: Very good coffee for the money
review/text: I have always been Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee beans lover over the past 12 years.  I have tried alternative beans and blends over the years from starbucks, DD.., and whatever local store sells..  Just can't find anything better than these JBM coffee.  On top of that, the JBM blends we used to get locally was no longer available.  I have tried many online JBM beans and they weren't really make me thirst for more.<br />We decided to shop online again and I have done my home work and narrow down to few in to my To-Try list.<br />This is the first one I gave it a try from Organic Camno Island coffee roasters.  Based on these reviewers,  I thought it looks promising and they were right.<br />It is really good coffee for the money.  Sure it ain't  $6/lb but it is not $45/lb JBM beans either.<br />We use your typical MR coffee machines... it is not we can't use a better machine,  rather, a good coffee would taste good even from the simplist standard coffee brewing machines.  It is really coming down to freshness of the beans and amount of water added.  It is not always true that hotter water temp makes brewing taste better.  That is from my personal experience tasting from these $15 machines vs the fancy starbucks machines and other industrial grade capaccino machines.  It is hard to judge reviewers brewing method as everyone do it different way as well.<br /><br />I am a black coffee drinker with no sugar or milk and cream added.  A good coffee to me would taste better without other additives added to enhance the flavor.<br /><br />Ok,  now, how does this bean taste when I brew it to my liking?<br /><br />Dark and rich and not acidic at all.<br />A hint of cocoa/vanilla with light sweetness from the beans itself.  It is definitely a treat.  This is definitely a worthy coffee to try.<br />It is on my subscription list now.

review/text: I just finished this coffee which was fine if you like a medium dark roast, nicely mannered, moderate taste to offer just about everyone. Good choice as a coffee nobody will dislike yet not a flavor for those who like a really strong wake-up. Good for an afternoon "Kaffeestunde" entertainment. But I am not likely to reorder it since I like the much darker, oily, stronger flavor coffee bean. The parrot picture on the bag is nice too to look at. I'll try another Camano Island coffee next time but know I can always come back to this one without risk if need be.

review/summary: Not spicy.
review/text: This sauce was okay as a general pasta sauce, though sweeter than what I prefer. It is sweeter than most common store brands (Bertolli and Publix brands are my standbys), which is surprising given the claim of "no sugar added." Also, it has about half the calories and fat than the same serving of Bertolli.  However, if you prefer a sweeter sauce, you may want to try this. For instance, if you like Classico, I think this would be an upgrade.<br /><br />It was definitely not spicy. Perhaps a bit strong on the garlic (I generally add more to most sauces, but tried this one on its own), but to me that does not fit the definition of spicy.<br /><br />Also, not sure of the mechanics behind this, but upon putting it in the bowl with the pasta, it got pretty watery (more than any usual water carryover from the pasta). As it cooled, it seemed to reconstitute to a good thickness. If you were cooking with meat or soy in the sauce, it might be less noticeable.<br /><br />Overall, disappointing for the description (spicy) and price.

review/text: I have tried lots of biodegradable dog waste bags and love the composting capability of them.<br /><br />I recently purchased the BioBags and found a major problem with them, after being "filled" the bottoms tend to rip open.  Before you know it you have a big mess.<br />Since I have 4 boxes worth, I have been double bagging and found sometimes that both bags rip open. I hope this is just a bad batch from the manufacturer.  But I am not going to purchase these again.  It is a huge waste to use 2-3 bags per use and I know I am going to upset my neighbors if I have to leave the mess on the street after a bag breaks open.<br /><br />I am going back to some of the other brands that are more durable, even if they cost a little more.

review/summary: unreliable - often impossible to open
review/text: These are terrific, sturdy, and environmentally friendly poop bags - when they work.  The problem is that you can get a batch of them in your order that are impossible to pry open.  This has happened to me before, and the vendor was responsive to the problem. But now that they are sold by amazon directly, there's no place to get another box to compensate.<br /><br />I'm going to look around for another brand that doesn't have this glitch. Otherwise, these bags are actually much more expensive than they are listed, since so many of them are useless. You can have a perfectly fine box, and then your next one has this defect.  Very frustrating!

review/summary: These biobags ain't what they used to be
review/text: I have been purchasing BioBags from Amazon for more than a year and have been delighted with the quality, strength and size.  My most recent re-order disappointed.  The bags are considerably thinner and the side seams often break when picking up dog deposits.  I notice on the packaging that they now meet California Law and say the bags should be used within six months.  Since there is no use by date on the package, I don't know how long they have been sitting on the shelf deteriorating before I received them.  Either way, I will be looking for a different biodegradable, compostible poop bag in order to remain environmentally correct.

review/text: These bags are great.  They are 100% biodegradable and compostable.  I loved the regular sized bags, which were perfect for me.  My husband said he wished they were bigger so I was very pleased to find that they come in this larger size.  I was a little hesitant ordering them after I read a poor review by a mother who said her children refused to use the bags, and said the sides of the bags were splitting.  I have never had this problem, and wonder if they were using the smaller size bag for a very large dog, or if the children were not as committed to the environment as the mother.  I will never hesitate to bye these bags in either size ever again.

review/text: After using another product, I thought I'd try something less expensive and that led me here.  The very first dog walk and the bottom of the bag dropped open splattering poop everywhere.  I was very disappointed.  On the positive side, the folks at the company stand firmly behind their product and sent additional bags to me.<br /><br />I have been using these now for three months and just set my account to auto-order.  I've come to the realization that for my larger dog (42 lbs.), I need to double bag.  While this should not be, they are still the least expensive option available that is earth friendly.  For my daughters chihuahua, these bags do fine.  If your dog is medium sized or bigger, prepare to double bag and order appropriately.<br /><br />I recommend this product to anyone owning a small-medium sized dog (>30 lbs.) and strongly commend the company's customer care.

review/summary: For Environmentally Concerned Pet Owners
review/text: We have a greyhound that can put out a lot of poo to be disposed of. I was concerned about the amount of plastic bags we were using and adding to land fills. After doing some research I found that these bags were 100% biodegradable in a reasonable amount of time while other so called biodegradable bags would actually leave some plastic residue. This company also makes garbage can bags as well which I can find at a local Whole Foods but no local merchants carry the pet waste bags. So I order them from Amazon in a quantity that will qualify for super saver shipping.  I always get them quickly in a very timely manner. These bags are also quite easy to open up when ready to scoop up waste. I've struggled with many of the other bags out there trying to open them up. These are a more expensive product but really worth it for dog owners who have to dispose of the waste in the trash.

review/text: Unlike some of the other bags out there, such as the "biodegradable" Bags on Board, these bags are TRULY biodegradable/compostable. The Bags on Board are made from polyethylene that will break down, yes, however it will leave little pieces of plastic everywhere which means it's not truly biodegradable in the strictest sense.<br /><br />These bags are made from corn and will supposedly compost at the same speed as an apple core (I haven't tried it), which makes them compliant with whatever the California law is that requires this.<br /><br />The price from Amazon is also one of the best around and not too terribly more expensive than the Bags on Board solution per bag.<br /><br />The bags are easy to use and are good for the environment and give you a more sterile way to pick up dog waste than using paper towels. You can always just use plastic shopping bags, but if you care about the environment even a little, putting biodegradable waste in a plastic bag that will take 100+ years to degrade is certainly not a environmentally friendly. If you don't care about the environment, skip these bags and take a bunch of plastic bags from Wally World.

They are black instead of green like the 3 gal bags if that matters to you.  Also, I haven't been filling it fast enough recently so I was worried that the moisture would start degrading the bag while it is in the composter.  So far it's been about a week and that hasn't been a problem.  I love that these bags aren't just degrading into plastic particles but are BIOdegradable.  I wish they were cheaper...

I emailed BioBag and received a response within 10 minutes offering to replace the box, so that was fantastic.  We'll continue to purchase these for our little poop machine.

review/summary: Great Alternative to Plastic Bags For Doggie's Dirties
review/text: Bought these for my 16 pound Schnauzer and they are generally just the right size. On those longer walks/jogs when he's especially, shall we say, prolific, a second bag would be helpful. So far I've managed to make it work with just the one bag- but it can be tricky. I had been concerned on occasions when it was raining out that the bag would begin degrading before I got back to the house, but despite getting close to soaked, they've always held up well.<br /><br />It feels great knowing that these are certified biodegradable and compostable. I hate the idea that plastic bags full of doggie dootie are filling up our landfills.<br /><br />I would definitely buy these again and I plan to try this brand's kitchen garbage bags as well.

review/summary: Perfect for Diapers
review/text: As I'm slow to transition to cloth diapers, I'm ever searching for any little thing I can do to lessen my impact by using disposables.<br /><br />I purchased these bags to keep in my baby's diaper bag and I find they are a perfect size for at least one little diaper (in size 1's right now), and probably two.<br /><br />I don't imagine I'll have any problem with putting full sized diapers in these as well.<br /><br />Of course, if I throw these into a larger plastic trash bag I defeat my purpose, so I take them home and toss them into my outdoor trash can.<br /><br />Great product with multiple uses.
