review/summary: Good Dog Food - Amazon Subscribe/Save Ripoff
review/text: Well - I'm not changing my review of the dog food. I stand by Pedigree and my dogs thrive on it. HOWEVER, I bought my first 24-pack for $12.66 and did Subscribe and Save. Thank goodness I looked, because the price when my next shipment was due had gone up to $24. Then it was $17, now I think it's $16 something.  You simply cannot tell me the price of this dog food DOUBLED in less than a month. There is something very wrong here, so I'm not downgrading the dog food, I'm downgrading what Amazon is doing with pricing. Very, very wrong. Beware of Subscribe and Save. Like another reviewer, I'll be going back to lugging cans of dog food rather than pay double.<br /><br />Initial review, prior to price increase: *I have to have wet food around for my older rescue dogs - and my own two love this as well. Was surprised to find it on Amazon, available at a better price than the store and with subscription I will NEVER run out again. I know some people don't like Pedigree due to high filler content, and if I had my druthers, I'd be feeding my crew a raw, organic diet.  But I don't. With the rate people are dumping dogs, we feed them as best we can and there is NOTHING wrong with Pedigree Dog Food, canned OR dry.  I have two 8 year old dogs who have been raised on it and they are the picture of health. So with that in mind, give em all the love you can and don't feel like you're doing something wrong by feeding them Pedigree. This is much cheaper than I can get at the store and now I don't have to haul crates of food into the house. *

review/summary: My beagle wolfs this stuff down
review/text: so I think that he likes it.  He always looks around for more under his dish.  As I combine the food with a weight control dry dog food, it does not bother me that much of the can content is gravy compared to the higher calorie traditional ground dinner varieties but pet parents serving it alone may feel that it is not enough due to the higher water content.  Price with subscribe and save is very good.

review/text: This is my dogs favorite dinner.  At subscription price it came to $.70 per can which is competitive with a walmart or foodlion sale.  HOWEVER, 3 cans arrived smashed open which put me back to paying regular price PLUS having to clean off all the gew that spilled over the unsmashed cans.  (Thats for a packaging review).  Had they all come in tacked, and I didn't have a mess and a $$ loss, I'd of given it 5 stars for the convenience and price.

review/summary: Horrible product - caused problems for my dog
review/text: I bought this particular canned Pedigree dog food from Petco for my dog, a spayed female corgi. Before trying Pedigree, we were feeding her Science Diet dry food. I bought a 12 pack of the ones with beef and ones with country stew. It was cheap (&lt;$1/can).<br /><br />Within a few days of feeding her the wet food mixed with some Science Diet dry food, her vagina started smelling strongly like fish. A few more days went by and thick bits of mucous were appearing on the fur around her vagina. One time I saw her pooping and at the same time saw a thick rope of mucous drop from her vagina. A few more days later, her fur around the vagina was tinged pink and later became red. It was evident to us there was mucous and some blood coming out of her vagina. So we stopped feeding Pedigree and went back to just the dry Science diet food. In a few days her excessive vaginal mucous and blood stopped. She is back to normal now.<br /><br />All in all we only fed her 5 cans of Pedigree dog food. For those 5 cans to cause this much problems is astounding. I would not recommend Pedigree to anyone after what happened to my dog.

review/summary: Great for dogs with sensitive stomachs!
review/text: My 7 year old border collie has a very sensitive stomach.  Purina, Benefit, Science Diet, and even home made dog foods (rice, oatmeal, carrots, chicken) would give her diarrhea and/or make her vomit.  She hates peanut butter, cheese, apples, carrots, and all the standard treats dogs usually love.  But once I put her on this stuff, she eats regularly, never gets sick, and has bowel movements with no troubles at all.  This food is great!  And the price is amazing for the amount you receive.

review/summary: Great food for allergic dogs
review/text: Our three year old German Shepherd suffers from severe food allergies which cause itching, redness, and hair loss. We tried many different types of food, including the most expensive, all natural, and allergen free types on the market. This is the ONLY food he can eat. After two weeks on this food his redness was gone, his hair was growing back, and the itching was practically gone. He has been on this food exclusively now for a year and a half and is doing great! The Amazon price is high, we buy ours at the local farm supply store where it is $26 for a 40 pound bag.<br /><br />If you have a dog with allergies, at least give this food a try. This is a premium food at a bargain price. I have read reviews of many dry dog foods, and this one ranks 92 on a scale of 100 for quality, healthfulness, and safety. For the price, you cannot get any better.

review/text: My high energy Siberian Husky loves only this teeny tiny kibble (She wolfs down the larger kibble and gets a tummy ache.)... This wonderful dog food might actually have a higher quality? fat content? (I could be mistaken? maybe that's why it is so appealing , so tasty to my high energy Husky?)  I prefer this food to the other brands. There is less input AND less output (both) with high quality food. The inexpensive grainy food ends up being eaten in greater quantities, and of course, more mess, more clean up after wards., ew.

review/summary: Yes, great ingredients. But Diamond Pet Foods are RECALLED
review/text: This is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.I too love Grain Free dog food and love that the first ingredient is actually the real meat.<br />My baby girl loves "Taste Of The Wild" in Bison mainly.<br />I searched relentlessly for a reasonable priced food that has no by-products, dyes and are grain free. Which my lil' white Maltese needed for her allergies and tear stains.<br />But, now Diamond Dog Food has been RECALLED for "Salmonella"<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled too.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these "better than store" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the "better" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying.

review/summary: So-so for Senseo? Maybe a little better...
review/text: This pod has a very nice flavor in a medium roast. For pod coffee makers that aren't too fussy about pod size it would be fine, but for Senseo (I have the 7810, regular machine) the size is slightly problematic. One pod just fits in the one-pod holder, but if you make a full (single) cup it's not very strong. Two pods are too thick for the two-pod Senseo holder. So what I've done is to run a half-cup with one pod in the single holder, stop the machine and change to a second pod (both pre-moistened) and run the second half of the cup. This makes a nice cup of coffee, but the extra step is kind of a pain.<br /><br />Revisiting this a couple of weeks later, I was too harsh. Thing is, I'm used to a really strong cup of coffee, and often drink French Roast or espresso. This coffee is a lighter roast - as a Breakfast Blend should be - so it has a lighter flavor. The pod is a little unusual in size, as I originally wrote (it's larger than a standard Senseo brand pod, but smaller than, for example, a Baronet), and you can't fit two in a double-pod holder. But as I've experimented, if I pre-wet the pod and put one in a single-pod holder and pull a regular single cup, the result is a really nice (small, not giant American style) cup of coffee, with excellent flavor. I'm leaving it at 4 stars as I think it could be a slightly heavier pod for even more flavor, but this actually has become one of my favorites.

review/summary: Community Coffee 16217 Breakfast Blend Single Cup Coffee Pods, 18-count (Kitchen)
review/text: Pods are small round flat filter bags filled with coffee, tea or other flavoring to be used in Pod machines such as Senseo machines, but can be used by simply placing in a mug and adding hot water.<br /><br />If you use a pod machine, please try Community Coffee Pods. The Breakfast Blend is a Medium roast. Community Coffee makes a dark roast pod which I have not tried.  One Pod makes the best drink using about 4 oz of hot water which is rather small, so I use two pods to make 8 oz of coffee. I have used my Philips Senseo machine since 2005 trying all the Senseo flavors I could find. I did not like any of the coffee flavors until I tried Community Coffee Pods. I have used Community Coffee Pods for about five years. The Senseo Tea Pods are a close second.<br /><br />Community Coffee Pods are individually wrapped for freshness and the used pods are compostable.

review/text: My actual rating was 0 stars, but system wouldn't except it.  I thought I was purchasing a Community Coffee K-cup for my Keurig.  That was the search I did in the Amazon search line.  When I received it I found out it was filter bags of coffee.  Spent $60 on 6 boxes, big mistake on my part.  I did notice they called them pods, but I thought it was a different term for K-cup, another big mistake on my part.  It does not work at all in the Keurig.  The coffee comes out with the look of slightly dirty water and has no flavor whatsoever.  Tried many other ways of brewing it, like a used K-cup with a plastic lid made for it, wetting the bag before brewing, nothing worked, the water flowed through the "pod" like water instead of steeping like coffee.  Keurig owners save your money.

review/summary: THIS is gluten free??????
review/text: Yesterday I spent my day in the strawberry patch. I picked eight quarts, and while most of the berries were destined for jam, I made sure to set aside a bowl full of berries to make the first strawberry shortcake  of the season.  Shortcake in our family consists of a generous portion of sugar-sprinkled fruit, a large helping of fresh-whipped cream (sugar and vanilla, too, of course), and all served on top of a still-warm biscuit fresh from the oven that must be made from scratch (Bisquick? Blech.....).  We've only been gluten free for just under two years, and for that time I've neatly avoided, and sorely missed, those homemade biscuits.  Last night I grabbed the  Mama's Almond Blend that had been waiting patiently in my cupboard, screwed up my courage, and made my mother's old fashioned biscuit recipe with it.  Using a fresh-layed egg from one of my hens, baking powder, sweet butter, whole milk, and a small amount of xantham gum, the dough mixed up precisely as it would have had I used wheat-based flour.  The biscuits plopped onto the parchment-lined baking sheet like they always used to, and they baked up golden brown and crispy on the outside, soft and tender on the inside.  Oh, they were heavenly!  The best part of our dinner aside from the food I was inhaling (and yes, our dinner consisted solely of strawberry shortcake - another family tradition on strawberry picking day) was when my non-gluten-free partner in crime took his first bite, and then looked at me and asked, "How come you're eating these biscuits?  Aren't you going to get sick?"  He literally could not tell that these yummy treats were gluten free!  I've tried many other gluten free flours in my role as a gluten free product tester, and this one is literally the best I've had.  While other gluten free blends are decent, and can produce the end result many are after, Mama's Almond blend is stellar: texture, taste and results all parallel gluteny flours, and in my recipes Mama's outperforms the rest of the pack of gluten free flours.  My little two pound bag is nearly gone - a batch of chocolate chip cookies this morning proved that it is dollar-to-serving worth its weight (and will significantly increase MINE if I continue to bake and eat like this!); the dough didn't even need to be refrigerated like other gluten free doughs before baking.  I'm one happy camper - and this will be my personal go-to choice for flour from this day forward.  It's a marriage made in gluten-free heaven!  Next up for Mama's Almond Blend - cheddar biscuits to go with homemade chili...and with blueberry season around the corner, and peaches ripening shortly after them, I think I'd better stock up - gluten free summer baking never felt so good!

review/text: This is a great product.  I have not had a single baking disaster using this flour blend.  Rachel Carlyle's the real deal.  It is obvious that developing this blend (& her coconut blend) was a labor of love.  Her cookbooks are a must have. Cinnamon Swirl Coffee Cake, yum.  Mochaccino Delights are the best cookies I have ever made.  And they are easy to make, the recipe makes about 48-56 cookies (and they freeze great).  Her blog/newsletter has great recipes also.[..]  I have great admiration for Rachel's commitment to gluten free baking.  She will convert a recipe to gluten free if you send her the recipe.<br />This is the only flour blend that I have used that results in baked goods that do not dry out in one day.  It is worth every penny.  Thank you Rachel!

review/summary: not low carb
review/text: I bought this flour because I thought it would be low in carbs...it is 43 net carbs/2 oz.  The first ingredient is white rice flour.  Almonds is the fifth and last ingredient.  This is not suitable for diabetics or those on a low glycemic diet.  If you are on a gluten free diet, you may like this flour, but you need to buy xanthan gum to use it in your recipes.  All of this should have been posted in the product description.  I feel cheated.

review/summary: Best Blend!
review/text: This gluten free blend flour is the best I've tried!  Sometimes, I blend my own, but buying the 4-lb bags is more budget-friendly.  The almond flour is very fine, and there is no buttermilk or milk ingredients in the blend, either.<br />  It adapts itself to any recipe.  I like that you have to add your own xanthan gum to create the different textures needed for bread, muffins, cakes or cookies.  I have even omitted xanthan gum on accident, and it doesn't make a huge difference to the consistency of the product- baked goods still turn out great! I am addicted to the French Yogurt Bread recipe on the back of the packet, and make it in my bread maker with no problems.  I definitely recommend this product!!

review/summary: gluten free mama's almond blend
review/text: I bought this along with the baking cookbook.  I made the basic brownies from the recipe in the cookbook, it was really good. I am the only one that is gluten intolerant in the family, but since I am the Mom and I do the cooking, we are all eating gluten free.  We all like the brownies and I think that this flour blend will be a good replacement for wheat flour.  It is also more reasonably priced than others.

review/summary: "Almond" Blend?
review/text: I hate to rag on something when it should have been "my responsibility" to check whether I'm being screwed.<br />The product should be simply called "Gluten Free Flour", without any mention of almond, for it contains, if any, only trace amounts of it (I didn't even open the bag, as is the last item on the ingredient list.)<br />To make matters worse Amazon doesn't allow for returns on food items, which is understandable; I don't fault them for that. But the clear mislabeling of the product should be, in my opinion, Amazon's responsibility.<br /><br />In short, if you're looking for Almond Flour THIS IS NOT.

review/text: I'm so excited to see this on Amazon now!!  I have been buying this flour from a store that is 1 & 1/2 hours from our home because it is a terrific GF/CF/SF flour blend! Gluten Free Mama also makes a Coconut Flour Blend for use in dessert baking.  GFM suggests substituting her flour blend cup for cup for any NON GF recipe and it seems to work well...sometimes takes a little tweaking with the right amount of Xanthan Gum, etc, but it certainly opens up a whole new world of GF baking/cooking!  We bought GFM's cookbook, too and it is the perfect accessory to her flour.

review/text: I am so happy to find this company! Finally, my teenage son can have food that tastes traditional. We loved the pizza crust, and have been baking bread with the flour blends 3 times a week. It is awesome. I have shared it with other gf families, too, and they are thrilled with the results, also.<br /><br />Switching to GF after a lifetime of eating "normal" has been difficult with 2 jobs. It is time consuming to learn a new way to cook, and when the expensive end product gets thrown out because it tastes awful, a person can get pretty discouraged. But everything we have tried with GF Mama's blends has been delicious. We will order again and again. Thanks!

I am sure if you are looking for something that is simply gluten free that this is a lovely product, but if you like me are trying to avoid all grains this is not for you. Also I am a little annoyed that now I can not return it because it is a  grocery item.

review/text: I know this flour has been out for a little while but for those of us who lived through those awful GF cookbooks where you had to make your own flour blends - finally, thank God! I had given up on baking completely. My husband came from a family where they make everything from scratch and couldn't stand not having baked stuff. We substitute it in regular recipes. I don't make bread or anything with it. It is a little crumbly and maybe I should add xanthan gum or something but I don't care. By far the best GF flour out there. I've tried a lot of flours. The coconut blend isn't as good... it tastes funny, bland maybe, flat (I really like coconut too).

review/text: In the spirit of helping my children learn that healthier eating DOES NOT necessarily mean no more treats, we got a couple of these on a Buy 1, Get 1 deal at a local store. We packed them for lunches on a few different days as a treat, and they have been requested ever since. They taste delicious, according to the kids.<br /><br />As for Mom, I like them because they are much more healthy than the standard high-fructose corn syrup laden "fruit" treats that are typically marketed for kids. We tried the Clif Z-bars first (rave reviews) and then moved on to these. It says a lot to me that these children's treats were among the first to comply with California's more strict school-lunch laws. I have no problem keeping these stocked in the pantry for an occasional treat, and the kids have no problem eating them!

review/summary: not as good as expected
review/text: Being a big clif bar fan, I thought these would be great. However, they were very bland. Thankfully they were not sickeningly sweet like a fruit roll up and the ingredients were healthy. When I think of the taste of these snacks, mediocre is the word that comes to mind.<br /><br />Since this is more something I would get for the kids, I had them taste the snacks. They didn't like them at all and refused to even put them in their lunchboxes.<br /><br />These fruit snacks are healthy, but not tasty.

review/text: These fruit ropes are innovative and delicious. Even though they are marketed as a child's product, they truly are great for kids of all ages! I enjoy them as much as my grandchildren. Especially if you are a licorice lover, these twists make an excellent, healthy substitute. Of course, nothing can compare with a child eating a real piece of fruit to get their daily requirements, but for finicky eaters, or when it's treat time, these fruit snacks cannot be beat. Both my grandchildren, and myself, highly recommend them!

review/summary: Convenient on-the-go nutrition, sans sweetener.
review/text: This is a perfectly sized, neatly packaged, fantastically fragrant hunk of hunger-appeasement. Kids will find the plastic wrapper easy to open, and not too hard to crimp shut should they want to save half for later, which they might: dried fruits are always more intense than fresh, and this snack packs a wallop of organic apple puree and organic fruit flavors, bound together with organic apple juice and pectin.  That is some rarified fruity madness.<br />I don't have kids, but if I did I'd sneak these into their backpacks every morning; instead, I keep these in the car and in my purse, for when I get so busy I forget to eat. It happens. I'm blonde. My husband snacks on them before *and* after meals; I can be convinced of their desert-worthiness with a hunk of high grade chocolate sharing their plate.<br />These snacks are a good source of potassium (great for writer's cramp or lost-weekend-recovery), with almost no sodium and very little sugar.  At 70 calories each, they're just the thing when you're too hungry to decide what you want to eat for dinner. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: This is an amazing tasting product. It is real fruit, no artificial ingredients. It has a great texture. The size is prefect for a purse, pocket, brief case, or lunch box. It only has 70 calories, which is equivalent to two organic fruit strips. It is the perfect size for a snack in between meals or for a nice energy boost. The only caution is if you have dental work (braces, crowns, loose fillings, etc), you might want to stick with fruit strips. This is very chewy and may cause damage. I found that out the hard way. Otherwise, highly recommended!

review/summary: Fruity and easy to take along :-)
review/text: These fruit snacks come in individual wrappers, so they are good for lunchboxes and travel. They are moist, sweet and fruity - probably high in carbohydrates, but also concentrated with micronutrients. It's a pleasant way to get a serving of fruit when you are not close to a fruit stand.

review/summary: Tart but tasty, my 20 month old loves them too
review/text: I got these through the amazon Vine program. It was nice that they sent a whole pack this time since it allowed both me and my son to try them out.<br /><br />If you look at the ingredients there is no added sugar, the sweetener is apple juice.  There are also some added vitamins in there which is an interesting idea for a fruit snack.<br /><br />When I tried them I thought there were very tart, almost sour, and definitely not overly sweet.  I liked the tartness though, as I am not a big sweet person.  They require a small effort to chew off a bite; not like jerky but tougher than a fruit roll-up.  I was worried that my 20 month old son would have trouble eating them because of the chewiness.<br /><br />Well, my 20 month old would give them 6 stars if he could.  He loves them.  I was surprised he liked them so much since they are a bit sour.  He does have to work some at chewing them; but he seems to like that, he kind of uses them as a teether.  Also they are coated in a light layer of oil so they aren't too sticky in his hands.  I don't know if I will get to eat any more of them because he got the box of them off the counter and has declared that the "Fruities are mine!"  I finally had to hide the box after he ate two of them, so he would lay off and find something else to do :-)<br /><br />All in all a great snack.  I like that all of the sugar is from fruit, that there are some added vitamins, and the taste is great too.  Great snack for my toddler too!

review/summary: Like a Tasty Organic Twizzler, way better than other so called "Fruit Snacks"
review/text: The Clif Kids Twisted Fruit rope is a great product.  It can replace those nasty "fruit flavored" roll ups and "fruit snacks" that are made primarily of corn syrup and artificial color and usually no fruit at all.  The twisted fruit rope is made out of actual furit, and even provides one serving per rope.  The ingredients are simple: apple puree, apple juice concentrate (makes it sweet), flavors, pectin, and fruit and vegetable colorings.  None of the chemicals from those bright "fruit flavored" concoctions, and everything is organic!<br /><br />The taste is great, too.  It's a bit tart, but with a nice berry flavor.  The texture is chewy, and it looks, tastes, and feels like a big Twizzler.  The ropes are packaged individually to throw in lunch boxes or backpacks, but I found myself reaching for at least 2 at a time.<br /><br />There are a couple of things I didn't like.  The strips are a little sticky;  it helps if you hold them by the wrapper instead of taking them out.  The sugar is also still fairly high.  There are 9 grams of sugar, a whopping 45% out of each 20 gram rope.  It's not added refined sugar, but the sugar comes from apple juice concentrate, which is much sweeter than natural apple juice.  Combine that with the sticky nature of the product and it's probably a good idea to have your kids rinse their teeth after eating one.<br /><br />Those drawbacks aside, these snacks remain far superior to candy or those gooey little "fruit snacks" as a tasty treat for kids (or adults!).  Keep in mind actual fruit is always a better choice, but if you need something portable, these are a great option.

review/summary: Awesome, heathy, low calorie boost for the active kid or adult.
review/text: I don't have any kids--that I know of--and I'm not a health nut but I eat a lot of Clif Bars while cycling.  It's the only real food that's truly portable and it comes in a great variety of flavors.  And now they've come out with the same sort of thing for active kids, at a portable and properly sized 70 calories of fruity fueling deliciousness.<br /><br />The thing that Clif understands that most people don't is, snacks are like kindling for the fire that keeps your internal engine going strong.  If you're sitting at your office desk drinking Gatorade and chomping down sports nutrition bars, you're really doing nothing more than producing fat and consuming too much salt (which is what electrolytes are), which increases your blood pressure, adds to stress, et cetera.  On the other hand, if you're out even just walking around the town or city that you live in for more than an hour at a shot (shopping, sightseeing, whatever), and eat something while continuing to move, your body will immediately use that to give you an energy boost, and will burn more calories--given that the activity level continues and is high enough to burn more than you are consuming--by turning to your fat stores next.  People know this instinctively, but tend to overconsume in those times of need.  The sudden influx of calories, particularly sugars, is like spraying lighter fluid on a fire that's already burning--which of course will suddenly burn hotter--ergo, you will lose weight or at least your endurance will increase if you're already thin--but if you consume too many calories at those times your body's systems will be overwhelmed (getting you ready for a recovery nap).<br /><br />I tested these out while cycling, where I usually go an hour before consuming anything but water, then eat a Clif Bar, and go on for another hour for my average ride or several hours during an event such as a 100 mile "Century" ride.  I found that because the twisted fruit rope is just sugary enough and has a good amount of carbs for fuels (with only 70 calories per serving), it gave me an immediate boost that lasted a good half hour.  I only consumed a 70 calories--the calories in one Clif Kid Twisted Fruit, Strawberry--but during that 30 minutes I burned at least 250 calories (if it was a casual ride, which it wasn't).<br /><br /> (During a recent 100 mile bike ride, I burned about 900 calories per hour on average, for 6 hours, which is 5,400 calories or 1.5 pounds of fat, or 2.7 large pizzas worth of calories or 42 Hostess Cupcakes--or 36 PINTS OF GUINNESS!  I would need to eat 77 of these Clif Kid Twisted Fruit, Strawberry ropes to stay even at calories consumed vs. burned, and then add 2050 calories more to account for my resting metabolism.)<br /><br />But I'm not on the bike every day like I used to be, so like any office worker/weekend warrior, I have to do both--consume an enormous amount of calories while at play, and consume a minimum of calories during work days (Wall Street job, power sitting a good 10 hours a day).  This seems the perfect snack for both because it has an extremely reasonable amount of calories--only 70--and yet it's a refreshingly sweet item that will give me a nice little boost maybe twice a day.<br /><br />For a kid, this effect will be far better since kids are more active.  You could give a child two or three of these for the day and tell her/him to eat them whenever they like--which more than likely will be a bit before lunch, another in the afternoon, and another around when they're heading home.  Perfect.  Conversely, if you give your kids money for whatever snacks they like, inevitably they'll get all their calories at once, with lunch and likely from the highest calorie source (and the schools should be sued for selling candy in their cafeterias--so friggin irresponsible).<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: This kid sized snack is great for even us big kids who sit around all day working.  I don't have any children, but I'll be buying these for myself from now on.  Perfect nutrition for both work and play.

review/summary: Vegan Organic Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Certified Organic. Kosher Parve. Sweet 'n tangy strawberry flavor. Wonderful fruity aroma. Fun. A single "rope" in an individually wrapped package. Perfect for on-the-go, a quick healthy snack, or your favorite anyone's lunchbag. 70 calories per snack. An organic healthy version of the red twizzlers I used to enjoy when I was a boy. Made with organic apple puree, organic apple juice concentrate, organic flavors, pectin, and fruit & vegetable juice colors. Clif is a trusted brand and leader in healthy organic energy bars and snacks. Another winner just for kids. Hide the box well from any 'big' kids and still young-at-heart adults. Highly recommended. [Received one box of 18 pieces at no cost through the Vine program.] This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews for more great choices.

review/text: I give it credit for being organic but the flavor is off. I got the strawberry and I don't think it tastes like strawberry at all, maybe it's just me but I found that I don't really care for the flavor. The ingredients say everything is organic but it is made from apples and not straberries. It says it has organic flavoring but does not state what the flavoring is from. I don't think I would buy this again only because I didn't like the taste.

review/text: I really like the taste of these as well as the nutritional values. I know it says they are for kids but after trying them I think I might end up finishing them off myself J/K! I like to find snacks that are nutritious to give to the kids because I don't think starting a habit of eating a lot of junk food all the time is the right message to send. With these they taste good enough that its almost like giving them junk food without them knowing that its good for them.

review/summary: Awesome taste -- and no added sugar!
review/text: I like that this entirely made from organic ingredients, each serving has an entire serving of fruit, and it has no added sugar.  Even the coloring comes from fruit and vegetable juice.  The best part?  It tastes wonderful!  It has a tart strawberry flavor, and the texture is great.  It's not gritty at all, like some natural fruit snacks are.  I got Clif Kid Organic Twisted Fruits to keep around for my grandchildren.  If they're lucky, I *might* still have some left when they get here!  I've definitely got to buy some more.  If I didn't already know these had no added sugar, I never would've guessed it from the taste.<br /><br />I've tried all the flavors.  They're all good, and they all have good texture, but strawberry is my favorite, probably because it tastes purer to me (only one fruit flavor, instead of two or more fruits competing for my taste buds).

review/text: This is a great item to keep in a desk drawer, brief case, glove box or purse to hold you over until the next meal.  Not only is it organic, but each stick is the equivalent of a serving of fruit.  (Another bonus: no artificial colors or preservatives.)<br /><br />I don't even LIKE strawberry flavored items...I prefer fresh strawberries. That's why this product came as a real surprise. The taste is tart and sweet and fresh.  Excellent!<br /><br />Also, the twisted stick form is easier to eat than the flat fruit "leathers" I tried.  Therefore it would be less messy in the hands of little ones.  (The wrapper can be slid down or pulled back like a banana peel, preventing sticky little fingers...a very helpful feature for snacking in the car.)

review/summary: Chewy Goodness
review/text: This Twisted Fruit is billed as a healthier alternative to other snacks targeted at kids.  This snack boasts one serving of fruit, a good source of vitamins C and B, and tastes almost as good as a less healthy alternative although the strawberry has almost a more grape taste than strawberry.  It also says it is fun it untwist and eat but it really isn't that easy to untwist and the snack itself is a little greasy to hold and you will be reaching to wipe your hands after eating.  Plus the snack does get caught in your teeth like other snacks of its ilk.  But the organic make up and the fact it does leave kids fairly full, adults may want two or more to be satisfied, makes this a much better alternative to the sugar snacks that currently flood the market.

review/summary: Tangy, Convenient, AND It's Healthy
review/text: I got these Clif Kid Twisted Fruit snacks because I'm a fan of other Clif brand products (Clif Bars, Luna Bars, Luna Minis) and I'm always looking for healthy food that's easy to eat on the go.  Even though I'm not a kid, I do enjoy having convenient, go anywhere fruit that I can eat.  I have tried various dried fruits and fruit leathers, but they are always either too dry and tough or too overly sugared.  Clif Twisted Fruit is a nice compromise, while still being all natural.<br /><br />Each twisted fruit is about 70 calories and has the "nutritional value" of a piece of fruit (so says the label).  I'm not sure how they really transfer the nutritional value of actual fruit into a processed product, so I wouldn't recommend this as a fruit substitute, but it does taste good.  The Strawberry flavor I tried is tangy and not overly sugared like most processed strawberry flavors.  The twist is brownish red, like natural strawberry preserves, not bright red. It is sort of gummy like fruit snacks, but the texture is not dry and tough.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed these fruit snacks.  My husband did too.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for a good lunch/snack food for either kids or adults--both sometimes need to be tricked into healthy eating!

review/summary: Not Just for Kids
review/text: Food is one of my obsessions, so I'm always happy to sample something that's possibly delicious AND healthful (and, to conform to my dietary restrictions, vegetarian). This turned out to be a good choice, with organic certification thrown in for good measure.<br />Clif Kid Twisted Fruit contains only fruit puree, fruit and/or vegetable juice, organic flavoring, and pectin. One serving contains a modest 70 calories and, considering the size of the serving, a fairly impressive daily percentage of several vitamins (mostly B's) and minerals. It's definitely the sort of snack you'd encourage your child to eat.<br />All of this, however, is meaningless unless the snack in question, shall we say, exceeds "palatable." No problem! The strawberry flavor explodes in your mouth as soon as you bite in, and it just gets better from there. The flavor is just sweet enough and very tangy, and the texture is chewy and smooth. I imagine that if soaked overnight in some water, a Twisted Fruit would be an excellent addition to a smoothie as well.<br />Twisted Fruits also work for grown-ups. They're easy to toss into a bag for a "whenever" pick-me-up and would be a nice, tasty way to take in some light nutrition after a workout. A versatile, healthful means of satisfying a sweet tooth (or, in my case, "teeth") that's appropriate for all ages.<br />BTW, MANY thanks to Clif Bar and Co. for providing such a generous sample for our review. I like to think that what goes around, comes around.  :)<br />Update: My friend's fruit-loving five-year-old went nuts for them. A hit with the target audience!

review/summary: Great for Adults
review/text: I have long been a big fan of Clif bars (Chocolate Brownie flavor), so I was eager to try this product. I was pleased to see that just one of these ropes equals a full serving of fruit, and that the added sweetening comes from fruit juice.<br />Texture is pleasingly firm, although a friend who tried it wondered whether kids would like it because it the "chew" didn't last long enough. The flavor is intense mainly because of the concentrated fruit content and there is an interesting "sweet-sour" flavor probably due to the added pectin. Kids who are used to very sweet fruit treats may not like this aspect, though.<br />Here's a Pro/Con list to summarize:<br />PRO<br />-Certified USDA organic<br />-Full serving of fruit in each rope<br />-No added sugar or high-fructose corn syrup<br />-Convenient (see comment about packaging, below)<br />CON<br />-Kids may not enjoy the sweet-sour flavor<br />-Individual packaging (it's a compromise between being convenient or being green)

review/summary: These are FANTASTIC...just not quite strawberry.
review/text: Delicious fruit-twists with a great, chewy texture - the twist is thick enough to feel substantial.  Way better than those "Fruit Roll-ups" of old times.  Would definitely recommend to anyone with kids or infants instead of other sweetened snacks (that would probably contain some kind of weird chemical)...this stuff is all natural.<br /><br />The 9 grams of sugar may be a bit much for an 2-3 year old to have more than one or two per day (unless you don't mind them running around with their arms above their head, bouncing off walls, and yelling with a big smile on their face.)<br /><br />On a final note - this review is for the Strawberry flavor.  While it does have sweetness and light strawberry flavor, it is rather "tart" for a strawberry.  In fact, the ingredients don't actually list "strawberries" anywhere in them:  Organic Apple Puree, Organic Apple Juice Concentrate, Organic Flavors, Pectin, colored with Fruit and Vegetable Juice.  With that said...the apple puree/apple juice taste like they were Granny Smith or maybe Gravensteins.<br /><br />So, while not exactly tasting like a fresh picked strawberry by any stretch of the imagination (hence the 4 stars rather than 5), they are very tasty.  (If given a Strawberry one without knowing which flavor it was prior, I don't think everybody would agree that it's strawberry.)  At any rate, I will certainly buy these in the future - will try other flavors to see if they all have "tart apple with hint of &lt;flavor>" flavored.

review/summary: Tasty, healthy and very convenient.
review/text: I'll be short and to the point.  This is a very good product.<br /><br />Each Clif Kid Organic Twisted Fruit serving has only 70 calories, but is all organic with no added sugar.  I think it's a great snack for adults as well as kids.  I'm one of those people with a sweet tooth and I've got to have some form of sweets around at all times.  One thing is for sure, munching on one of these is a lot better for you than reaching for that candy bar.<br /><br />The only slight criticisms I have is that it's a touch more tart than expected and the primary ingredients are "apple puree" and "apple juice concentrate" with no specific mention of strawberries.  Also, while the price is a reasonable value, it's not a terrific one.  I'd strongly recommend that you consider the "Subscribe and Save" option, which knocks an extra 15% off of the price.  You can always cancel S&S later if you change your mind, so there's no downside to signing up and it will save you money.

review/summary: Sadly, one of the only sources of fruit my son will eat!
review/text: I can not express how surprised (and happy!) I was to find out my son loves these fruit ropes.  The Mixed Berry were the first we tried and they are actually pretty tart.  I did not think that would go over well with a kid that really only tolerates a bland banana or apple every now and then.  But he LOVES them.  I added them to Subscribe and Save and almost every month I have to order more before the scheduled delivery.<br /><br />There's not much to them as far as a filling snack, but they apparently satisfy the little ones.  They are "dense" and chewy so they take a few minutes to eat and satisfy the craving to have a snack.  With a full serving of fruit and added nutrients, it seems like a no brainer.  When you include our neighbors that visit all the time, these are a hit with at least ages 3 to 10!<br /><br />I am anxious to try more flavors and will go for the Variety Pack next.

review/summary: Great tasting, healthy snack@
review/text: They are soft and chewy, not like the leathery texture I'd come to expect from this type of snack.  It's nice to have the flavor variety pack.  None of the flavors are the "bad" one that everyone leaves until last.  We just reach into the box and pick out whatever comes out.<br /><br />Our whole family enjoys these.  In fact, I think mom and dad eat more of these than the kids do!  They are consistently gone in much less than a month, such that I'm considering increasing our subscription order from 1 to 2!

review/summary: Very Good Product
review/text: Based upon the reviews, I decided to try these as a healthy adult snack.  I was expecting a larger package size, but was pleasantly pleased with the quality and taste.  Perfect, just what I was looking for. I have signed up for the automatic shipping option on these to get them at a lower price also.

review/summary: My toddler LOVES them and so do I!
review/text: I gave my toddler one tonight after dinner as a treat...he got extremely excited and immediately went to work on it. It's not very big, but it certainly is a healthy choice and lasted him a few minutes! I love them too!

review/text: Usually, these products have way too much sugar and are not that healthy.  This one is organic and is low in calories.  I like it as much as my daughter does.  We purchased the variety pack on Subscribe and Save for extra savings too.

review/summary: Used this for our party favors
review/text: My son loved this healthy snack.  It comes in fun flavors, and looks like licorice.  It seems easier, i.e. less messy, for kids to eat than some of the other fruit strips out there.  And because of the packaging we were able to include them in the favor bags for his party as an alternative to candy.

review/text: The kids and I love this product. It is one Weight Watchers point. It is also not as sticky as some flat fruit leathers. Why eat high fructose corn syrup, sugary "fruit" snacks when you can eat the real thing.

review/summary: Yummy, Healthy Anytime Snack
review/text: I like to keep snacks on hand, but not the classic junk-type snacks.  These are perfect for our family.  The kids are able to grab them anytime they need something to munch on, and I don't worry about them OD'ing on chips or candy.  We love all the flavors; they're tart and chewy, just right for a sweets craving.

review/summary: These twists ROCK
review/text: These are awesome.  They are organic and one full serving of fruit.  They aren't flat, they are wide chewy twists, and they taste like CANDY!  I also love that they are fortified with some extra vitamins because my 3-year-old is a very picky eater.  Since they are pretty thick and a so chewy, I don't give them to my 1-year-old yet.  With him I stick with the flattened fruit.  Don't tell the kids, but I sneak a few of these to work to help get another fruit serving into my own diet.  I love the sour apple.  I just subscribed to get a box every month.  I didn't know you could do that.  Cool!
