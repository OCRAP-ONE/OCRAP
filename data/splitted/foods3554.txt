review/summary: One of my favorite "fast food" products!
review/text: I have been using this brand of curry paste for decades.  I usually picked them up at Korean or Chinese markets and at a really good price.  I found them to be incredibly useful for a wide variety of dishes.  A really quick meal could be made by mixing the paste with coconut milk over low heat.  I could then add it to cubed browned beef, chicken, tofu or shelled shrimp, diced potatoes, tomatoes, onions, garlic or a myriad of other ingredients.  When served over Jasmine or Basmati rice I would have tasty meal for my family in less than 30 minutes.  The curry pastes can also be used for more complex stews and curries or even as a rub for a roast (I like to mix the green curry with a little grainy mustard and rub it on a chuck roast.)<br /><br />About 3 or 4 years ago this product (and the others in this line) started to get harder to find.  I have heard this same complaint from friends of mine across the county.  I could purchase something similar, but not the curry paste that I was used to.  I am so happy to have found this product on Amazon.  The price is just a little more than I found at the ethnic markets, but not very much.  I will buying this here on a regular basis from now on.

review/summary: Impressed again
review/text: I first tried the Pineapple flavor and was waiting to try the Original to cast my final rating.  I'm still very impressed.  While nothing beats a fresh coconut, this is a great alternative.  I'm a coconut water addict and consume anywhere from 1-3 cans a day.  This adds up in $$$.  For people like me, who drink coconut water everyday and use electrolyte replacement mixes in my water bottle when i'm biking, this is a dream come true.  My kid actually loves eating the powder straight!<br /><br />I recommend this product for people who love coconut water as much as I do, are aware of the environmental impact shipping coconut water around the world, packaging waste, want it all the time (like me) and like the convenience of the powder.  For purists, stick with the fresh coconut.  But for price, flavor, environmental impact and convenience, CocoHydro is awesome!<br /><br />Thanks CocoHydro for making this product!  It's a great creation!

This stuff is better than all but one product as far as taste but comparable to even that one (VC). However, this is so much cheaper and it takes up less area to store (yes, I use that much)!

review/summary: Excellent option for coconut water addicts!
review/text: I have a potassium deficiency and have found coconut water to be an excellent addiction to my diet. I even notice a slight energy boost after drinking it. The flavor is just slightly sweet and coco-nutty with a faint saltiness like most sports drinks have. It's really easy to pack a couple of tablespoons into a Tupperware or small zip-lock and shake it up with water after a workout. The product dissolves quickly and easily leaving the water slightly cloudy. Overall CocoHydro is as good if not better than packaged coconut water (I compare it to VitaCoco Original). The environmental impact of using a powdered product is much less than the tetra packaged waters. I have even subscribed to a monthly shipment so I won't have to drive to a health food store 45 min away for my fix.<br /><br />Bottom line, it tastes great, it costs less than other brands, and I will be buying it for the foreseeable future.

review/summary: Surprised.
review/text: I had tried one other coconut water product on amazon and was not to impressed with it's lack of almost no coconut flavor. Coco Hydro on the other hand is probably as good as it gets for powdered coconut water. This one actually does taste like coconut water, it's a light taste though, but defiantly noticeable. This isn't as good as something like Vita Coco though, but about the same in taste as Zico coconut water I'd say. It's not bad at all. The nutritional content is very impressive and completely identical to that of Vita Coco and Zico.This product contains dextrose which is the same as glucose and is actually the only sugar that is good for the body and works in the blood to feed your cells, and be rest assured, this dextrose is not from corn, its made from tapioca. Mixability of this product is superb, add water, stir, and like a minute later its all mixed perfectly, I still like to let it sit for about 5 minutes though. The package recommends 1 tablespoon per 8 ounces but I found that the coconut flavor is just to light for me so I do a tablespoon and a half and thats perfect for me. All in all a great product, I would give it 5 stars if I didn't have to use more then a tablespoon per 8 ounces, It costs a little more doing it that way and I'm going for a cheap alternative. This is still cheaper then regular coconut water though even though I use more. I personally think this should be priced at $8.99.

review/text: It does not taste like the canned coconut water to me (which I love) but it is much cheaper.  I do a lot a yoga and frequently had foot cramps.  I took supplements but coconut water was the solution to my problem.  The problem with coconut water is that it is expensive.  This powder is a cheaper alternative and seems to have the same effect.  I add a little coconut flavoring and a few drops of liquid stevia and it really pumps up the flavor.

review/summary: The only thing missing is the nut !
review/text: This powder mixes with water to create a light flavored coconut water, just like the water I have had on Bombay street corners, but without the nifty shell-cup. Recently, I have had a hankering for coconut water, but I have found buying the tetra packs, can, or bottles to be expensive. This is about half the price, but you have to provide your own water.<br /><br />I would take this traveling with me, or back country. When my sister saw it on my counter she mentioned that it was exactly the product that her friend, a professional competitive bicyclist, uses while racing. (200-400 miles on a bike in a day is a lot without the proper snacks.)<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.

review/text: I agree with previous reviewers who say this doesn't taste like coconut water. No matter how much or how little water I disolved it in, I could not get a flavor that resembled coconut water in ANY form (canned, tetra pak, fresh) and I have tried them all.<br /><br />Maybe the people who gave this good reviews just like the taste and the fact that its a natural, low calorie rehydration beverage. But I grew up on an island in southeast asia drinking coconut water right from the coconuts themselves and now I drink it from tetra paks, and trust me this does not taste like either of those.

review/summary: Serves its purpose just fine
review/text: I'd like to be under a tropical palm tree, sipping real coconut water, but I'm in the frigid north, doing the best I can.  This is an instant powder so I didn't expect this to have the 'weighty' flavor of fresh coconut water; however, I really appreciate the light and refreshing  flavor, especially when i am consuming lots of water during heavier workouts.  I have found the dilution of a Tbsp / 8 oz ( 3 Tbsp in my 24 oz water bottle) to be nice and light when I am active;  however, for keeping in the refrigerator for general drinking, I like more taste, so add more powder.  The amount of powder really makes a difference in the taste.  I have tried a couple of other instant coconut waters, and their first ingredient is sugar -- not at all appealing to me  So I am pleased to find a drink powder that has its first ingredient 'evaporated coconut water'.

review/summary: Not Even Close...
review/text: ...and I'm not talking about fresh coconut water. Even canned coconut water from Costo is far better.<br />I really don't understand the 5-star reviews. I wonder if these people know what a coconut tastes like.<br />An earlier review mentioned the after-taste. It is closest to stale processed white cheddar cheese.<br /><br />Seriously, if you weren't told that this was coconut water, you'd never guess. It's that bad.<br /><br />If you're near a Costco, go get the canned Foco coconut juice. (12x17.6 oz cans for under ten bucks). At least that one has a semblance of coconut in it. (and is cheaper by the ounce. 160 calories for the 0.52 Liter can - which is not too bad for an 80% juice but it does have added sugar and water)<br /><br />I was going to give it a 2nd star for the low calorie count (so one could add fake sugar to make it sweet), but after looking at the nutritional facts, I don't know what the calorie count really is.... Why? Nutritional facts state 5 calories per serving. No mention of the number of servings in the container. Serving size is 22g, but package weighs 275 g. So that is 12.5 servings (not 25 servings as advertised). So is this 5 calories per ounce of mixed drink or 22g of powder.<br /><br />Bottom line, skip it. Hopefully the pineapple flavored one that should arrive over the next few days will mask the cheese aftertaste.<br /><br />UPDATE: The pineapple flavor does mask the cheesy aftertaste. I'm going to have to mix the original and the pineapple as there's no way I'm going to be able to drink the original one alone...

review/summary: YAY Coconut! BOO Coco Hydro :(
review/text: I really, really, really wanted to like this. I like other things from this company and I LOVE coconut water - especially straight outta the nut! No sweeteners needed. (I also like coconut manna, and coconut smell, and coconut milk, shredded coconut, etc). This tastes nothing like coconut water. I think the stuff they add to it is what ruins it. It tastes salty and fake. I wish they could/would just dehydrate the coconut and powder it and package that. Maybe it would be different.<br /><br />I love coconut water, but don't feel comfortable with the environmental cost of shipping, etc. i was happy to find it in powdered form, and happy that there were so few ingredients. I REALLY wanted to like this. I'm so bummed. I can't even give it away.<br /><br />I see it is out of stock - maybe they are reformulating it?? Big Tree Farms, if you read this, PLEASE improve the taste of your formulation and let us know when you have. I'll GLADLY update my review for an improved product!<br /><br />I rely on reviews to help me make informed buying decisions. I hope this review helped you too!

review/summary: Great solution!
review/text: Coconut water is great as a natural substitute to all those artificial electrolyte drinks. Problem is, it's a bit of a fad right now. You can't find them sold everywhere and they are often on the expensive side. That, and many of them come from far-away places and if you're bothered by the thought of all the added cost of shipping palettes of packaged water, this product is the answer!<br /><br />From what I can tell, this product is nothing but coconut water, in powdered form. Sure, it might not taste as fresh as water from a fresh coconut, but I can carry this anywhere, I can travel with it, and I can mix some up any time I want. The convenience alone is great, but knowing the manufacturer doesn't have to pay all the overhead for shipping it in water form is wonderful.<br /><br />This dissolves pretty easily, but pouring it into regular temperature (tap) water instead will make it dissolve faster than if you pour this into a glass with ice cubes (in case you want to add this into a glass of ice water at a restaurant).<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Potassium Pick-me-Up
review/text: I've been using CocoHydro, Original, for 2 months now. I remember finding their website and inquiring about the nutritional information for this product before it was even sold on the market. The company has been very considerate and prompt to answer all my emails and questions! I suffer chronic hypokalemia (low potassium) in conjunction with a lifelong history of eating disorders and health problems in relation to them. I need all the added nutrients I can get, including weekly nutrient IV therapy due to radical defeciences and digestion/absorption problems. I have been using Cocohydro as a supplement everyday and love it. It's a great way to boost electrolytes. I add it to my food and beverages, even fresh coconut water that I drink daily... every little bit helps. I was expecting more of a coconut taste and was surprised to find it rather bland but my primary purpose of usage is supplementation so it doesn't bother me that it's plain. The amount of potassium in 1 single serving literally almost compares to the amount of potassium in a serving of fresh coconut water. I can double the fun and add both together for a super boost! I have no interest in the flavored varities but I'm sure they offer more taste than the original - for those who feel they need added flavor. I order through subscribe and save and get a discount on my purchases! I get 2 bags sent to me every month so I don't have to worry about running out or ordering again. PS. Great for car or travel, carry an extra in your car or bring one with you - you never know when you will need an extra boost!

review/summary: Good concept... but at the cost of taste :(
review/text: Have been buying all the tetra-packs (zico, real, vita, ...) for a very long time so was excited to see this dehydrated coconut water. I liked the concept of not shipping all that water around if you can extract the "good stuff"... reduced cost and environmentally better... but unfortunately it did not turn out (for me) to be the best thing since sliced bread :( No matter how much or how little powder I add to the glass of cold/warm water, it just DOES NOT taste like real coconut water.. or even like the tetrapacks. I really wanted to like it but taste is obviously diluted for amounts of powder they recommend as a serving... and when you slowly increase the amount you add, the "dextrose" part of the powder kicks in... and adds that weird sweetness. In short, for me the taste was not acceptable...  even for the saved cost and environmentally friendliness....  back to the tetra-packs.... except when I can get close to some *real* coconuts, that is!

review/text: This is terrible terrible terrible.  I wanted to belive.  But, alas, it was not true.  THIS IS NOTHING LIKE COCONUT WATER.  IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE.  IT'S NOT EVEN TANG.  I WOULD RATHER DRINK TANG.  This is disgusting.  Does not taste like coconut water, tastes like dextrose and bitter aftertaste, even when prepared in hot water.  The worst.  Save your money.  You will be disappointed.

review/text: I was very happy with this purchase.  I received a 4 box pack for a great price shipped for free right to my front door.  Sure beats going to the store with two kids!! My children ages 5 and 2 absolutely love drinking their capri suns.  We can never keep enough of it in stock as they like to help themselves to it all day long.  Grandma and Grandpa keep stocked up on this product at their house as well. :)

review/summary: Tasty, but a bit sweet
review/text: I decided to try this variety instead of the regular mead at the "Made in Oregon" store. I have to say, I like it a lot more than most wines. It has a fairly decent alcohol percentage (11 to 14 I think), but it doesn't taste too strong. It is a little pucker-up-because-of-sweetness, though.

review/summary: Change is not so good this time
review/text: I must say the whipped peanut butter bars are amazing and only 100 calories but the Protein Fit Peanut Butter bars that I used to love are not very good at all anymore. They are not horrible but they are nothing like they were. They just don't taste as peanut buttery anymore; more cardboardish than they used to. They are also much smaller. I am operating under the assumption that there used to be a lot more calories in that thing than 140 because it's much worse and smaller now for the same amount of calories. This is very disappointing because that bar used to be my favorite. I was so excited when it came back that I ordered 8 boxes. Disappointment!!

review/summary: NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL.
review/text: I bought this item because I had eaten the original peanut butter protein bar for years, but was sad to see it discontinued, and really happy to see it out again. I ate one and noticed immediately that it tasted totally different. I reside in Canada so I know that south beach was owned by Kraft and this was definately not kraft peanut butter. Sure enought I looked all over the bar and its not made by kraft anymore. Not only that, but its loaded with sugar and carbs which the old bar was not. This was made to be a low carb high protein bar originally and now its just another granola bar. Wont buy again, and am disappointed that this new company would put the South Beach name on a product that is nothing like the original.

review/summary: Good Bar, But...
review/text: I love the taste and texture of these bars.  However, I liked them a lot better when I could buy them at the grocery store in the "cereal bar" isle for $2.oo to $2.50 a box!  They suddenly disappeared, then reappeared in the protein bar isle, at about double the price!  I honestly don't see a big difference in the nutritional value of the bar, just a big difference in the price!  That's why I ordered them on Amazon, cuz they are slightly cheaper that way, but not enough to make me want to order them again.  Amazon did a great job with order/delivery, my frustration is with South Beach.

review/summary: Another great product ruined
review/text: Companies don't change things to make them better, they change them to try and increase their profitability.  Kraft has taken what was a great product and turned it into pure crap.  I'm sure some bean counter somewhere got a big raise for coming up with the "new" version of these bars and saving the company one penny per bar.  I'm sad to say that the great peanut butter bars I enjoyed are now gone.  Thanks Kraft.

review/summary: Deliciously Rich Diet Peanut Butter Treat
review/text: The food I miss the most when dieting is Peanut Butter. I walk by those brightly colored containers in the grocery store, take them down from the shelf salivating and lamenting the fact that about 2 tablespoons of the sticky goodstuff is about a meal's worth of Weight Watcher's points.<br /><br />Sigh.<br /><br />So I jump at the chance to consume any diet-centered peanut butter product. These South Beach treats are very good: covered in peanut butter, with the deep rich nutty taste that one would expect. I was very pleasantly surprised by how thick was the flavor, and I realized 20-30 minutes after I was done, I felt quite full. These are a must-buy for any peanut butter-lovin' dieter.<br /><br />The only downside is for those dieters on Weight Watchers, and I understand that this is made for the South Beach dieters: this treat comes in at about 4 WW points which is a little higher than my typical target for any non-meal snack.

review/summary: Liked the Taste
review/text: Never having eaten the prior version of this product, I can't comment, as others have, on what it tasted like before and if I would have liked it better, so I am only judging this product on what it is today.<br /><br />I can honestly say I like the taste and think it tastes as much like peanut butter as you can get without being 100% peanut butter.  It fairly well melts in your mouth and doesn't stick to your teeth, which is a plus for most people who wouldn't be able to brush soon afterwards.  But as with all peanut butter products, my only concern is the % of FAT. Of the 145 calories in each bar, 45 are from FAT. While that is a little disheartening the good news is that it contains 0% cholesterol and only 2% of the daily allowable sodium intake for those that must watch such things. My wife, who is an aerobics instructor has tried these and also likes them and think they make a good quick energy bar.  They also contain 3g of fiber or about as much as 2 slices of whole wheat bread.<br /><br />So judging this product on taste and convenience plus price I think it is well worth a try. Taste, like beauty, is in the eyes of the beholder, therefore I think it is a pretty good looking product overall.

review/summary: Weird aftertaste, and a small bar...
review/text: LOOKS: I uploaded a picture to the "Customer Images" section: this is a pretty small and compressed-looking bar.<br /><br />SMELL: Right off the bat, you know you're getting a peanut butter treat, as there's a strong smell once you open the packaging.<br /><br />TASTE: It's got the consistency of a Rice Krispy Treat, but slightly softer and less sticky. The peanut butter/soybean aftertaste will stick with you for a while, so I don't recommend eating these without something to cleanse your palate.<br /><br />NUTRITION PERCENTAGES (from the wrapper):<br /><br />Vitamin A: 15% daily values<br />Vitamin C: 4% daily values<br />Calcium: 15% daily values<br />Iron: 15% daily values<br />Thiamin: 25% daily values<br />Riboflavin: 25% daily values<br />Niacin: 25% daily values<br />Vitamin B6: 25% daily values<br />Folate: 30% daily values<br />Vitamin B12: 25% daily values<br />Phosphorus: 10% daily values<br />Zinc: 10% daily values<br /><br />**NOTE** If you have allergies, the wrapper advises that in addition to peanuts/soybeans/milk, the bar is processed on equipment which also processes tree nuts, eggs, wheat and sesame.<br /><br />MY VERDICT: While the bar did sate my food cravings, I wasn't very fond of the aftertaste. The peanut butter got messy at room temperature so I had to gobble this up pretty quick. I doubt I'll eat these again.

review/summary: A Mixed Bag of Peanut Butter Bars
review/text: The peanut butter flavored South Beach Diet protein bars are more like granola bars than anything else and they are high in protein and fiber. The taste is not bad but the peanut butter bars are try and leave a lingering aftertaste in the mouth. They aren't bad but they aren't exactly good either. On the plus side, they are pretty filling though the price seems a little high (FYI--I got a five pack of bars for free through the Amazon Vine program). According to a friend who was familiar with the older South Beach peanut butter bars, this is a very different--and less tasty--product than the previous version.

The reviews for this product seem to be more of a warning to people who ate the old peanut butter bars of this type than reviews of the actual product.<br /><br />I do understand the frustration when they change these products because I am such a picky eater. Even slight changes in a product can make something that was once a favorite, intolerable. I never had the old bars so I will never know what they were like before.<br /><br />I don't need fancy food. I just need something that has a decent amount of protein in it. These have that protein and I am grateful for them. They are very filling for their size and great for someone trying too lose weight.

review/text: I used to LOVE these bars years ago and they seemed to help with my weight (along with the South Beach lunches) but WOW did they change this product for the worse! I have a feeling that the old bar wasn't as healthy as advertised and they probably got busted for it. It just tasted too good to be that healthy.<br /><br />Instead of changing the nutritional values, they changed the product? Makes no sense to me. As another reviewer said, it tastes like cardboard. That's the EXACT thought I had when I bit into one. I bought 3 boxes and ate just two bars from the first box and threw the other boxes away.<br /><br />Taste varies by person but if you're looking for the original great bars, these are NOT them.

review/summary: Amount of Grains Correct, Shipped Improperly, Grains Appear Inactive
review/text: I received the promised 3+ tablespoons of Milk Kefir grains, but the product was shipped in a plastic tub that had nothing, like tape, to keep it closed during shipment. As a result the product arrived in a plastic lined shipping envelope, but the plastic container had come open and what (if any) liquid was shipped with the product had spilled out along with the grains, inside the envelope, with only a few grains remaining in the plastic tub. Simply adding some cellophane tape or shipping tape around the edges of the plastic tub lid/container would likely have kept the product contained properly during shipping. Also the package was HOT when it arrived. The grains "looked" large and healthy, if a little bit crushed, however I have tried making milk Kefir 2-3 times since I received the product, according to the instructions included in the shipment, and the milk curdles very little, even if I leave the grains for two days, instead of just one. I'm hoping the grains are still just in shock. Some grains seem to float while others sink to the bottom of the glass jar filled with fresh whole milk, that I cover using a rubber band and coffee filter, so the mixture can breath at room temperature away from any direct light. Also the grains were in large clumps in the shipment or appeared to be, but now have broken down to much smaller clumps. The color of the grains is close to the color of milk. I'm hoping the grains that sink to the bottom aren't dead or totally inactive, but most milk Kefir makers seem to indicate their grains float on the surface or the milk. I'll try making milk Kefir for one more week, but if the milk still isn't curdling, then I'm afraid these grains arrived dead/inactive and likely never will become active. Any buyers should be forewarned that the seller wants you to pay return shipping for a full refund and says they will not reimburse you for this cost, and this must happen within one week of receiving the product. I purchased water Kefir grains from another seller that were shipped with liquid in a totally sealed plastic bag, that arrived unbroken - they have been making water Kefir successfully in the same environment, so I'm certain that the environmental conditions are not a problem, also those water Kefir grains have since doubled in volume (grown). I am not using metal utensils, only plastic, nylon, or glass (jars, strainers).<br /><br />It's now September 16, 2012. I had to give up on getting these Milk Kefir grains to work properly (or at all). My Water Kefir grains I had received from another seller are now busting at the seems in productivity. They went from 3-tablespoons to 2.5 quarts of Water Kefir grains by this time. I found a website that told you how to gradually convert Water Kefir grains to Milk Kefir grains, and using this technique I now have very effective working Milk Kefir / Milk Kefir grains. They don't grow as fast as the Water Kefir grains, but they do product Milk Kefir that's delicious and viable.

review/summary: Old product?
review/text: Really pleased with first order back in July. Not so much with the second order. When the second order arrived the packaging hinted at the difference. The first order was packaged better in a clear plastic bag inside the box. Second order came in gray plastic bag hiding the contents and was sloppily taped together. Inside was a baggie tied with a twist tie containing the candy that looked like someone did it in their kitchen almost. The product in the second order looked and tasted old, like something left in a warehouse too long. Candy is not fresh-tasting and it looks almost oxidized or something -- a strange, muddled color of purple. When I have bought Pops that looked like this at the store they always tasted old and were a little chewy. These look and taste the same, so guessing they have been sitting somewhere too long. The outer candy coating is chewy and somewhat soft (the middle is supposed to be chewy). So to sum: first order great tasting and nice package, second order tastes stale and the packaging was not as good. Both arrived quickly though, but probably won't buy this again.<br /><br />Update 10/12/2012: This order was not filled by Candy Mafia as I had thought. It was actually "fulfilled" by another Amazon vendor. I ordered from Candy Mafia previously and the product was excellent. So the review above does not apply to Candy Mafia.

review/summary: Best Cranberry Tea
review/text: I have used this tea for years to help promote overall good health.  I combine it with their Green Tea (1bag of each to 2 cups hot water).  I don't use sugar with this combo but you might.  I don't like the green tea taste alone but the Cranberry Tea makes the green tea much tastier plus, I feel, a better aide to my immune system. When my immune system is feeling low, this combo revives it quickly (although it may take a little longer to notice the effects when first starting to use it).  I use it 2 - 3 times daily, initially, then once a day.  I have tried this companies' Weightless Cranberry, which, I feel, is not as good as this product for my purposes.  This Traditional Medicinals Organic Cran-Aid cranberry tea is promoted for urinary infections.  Before I started combining it with green tea (which I did not discover until several years later), I used it for urinary tract infections and it cleared it up quickly.  For urinary tract infections, I used to consume lots and lots of Cranberry Juice with little or no help.  The help I received from this tea was a blessing!  I am very anti-biotic resistant.  I do not take antibiotics anymore for urinary infections.  I am not a tea drinker and it was difficult for me, at first, to discipline myself to drink teas.  I am very grateful for this tea.<br /><br />I have used different tea products from Traditional Medicinals and, overall, have been very satisfied with their products.<br /><br />Until I developed issues with anti-biotic resistance, I was not into the "natural health movement."  Over the years, since then, I have tried many different health aides.  Some of the naturals do not work at all.  When you find the ones that do work, you stick with them.  This is one company and their teas that I have used since the late 1970's.  I am so glad to have found this on Amazon so that I do not have to drive for miles to get these teas any longer.

review/summary: awesome food and smells like fish!
review/text: Unlike most pet owners in the world, I have fed my dogs high quality foods for years, with Acana pacifica being one of them. I don't buy it from amazon but get it by subscription from a petfood site for 54 bucks shipped for the large size.<br /><br />what do I like about this food?<br />dogs are carnivores with an identical internal anatomy of the wolf. dogs do not need carbs, veggies or grains. Acana is much higher in meat than a lot of other foods, and has no grains.<br /><br />firm stools! Out of all of the foods I've used, including, wellness core, TOTW canidae, acana, evo, acana always proves to give firm stools, second only to taste of the wild.<br /><br />Acana is  ethoxyquin free<br />Acana also does not denature their foods.<br /><br />cons-<br />price....a little pricey, but on subscription it is very reasonable.<br />bag is not resealable<br />customer service sucks..never answers emails or phone calls.<br /><br />I also think that, while Acana has a lot of meat content, it doesn't hold a candle to foods like , orijen evo. Orijen is made by the same company as acana, and is 80 percent meat as oppose to 60 with acana...but acana is less rich an my pup does better on it :)...I think 65 percent meat would be perfect for acana, but 60 percent is still working fine for us.<br /><br />to close,<br />I'd recommend this food if you want to feed your pets a high quality diet that is better than 95 percent of the foods out there but are on a budget and can't feed a raw diet or a diet such as orijen. (or your Dogs JUST do Better ON THIS THAN orijen)

review/summary: Glad I switched from Science Diet!
review/text: I bought Acana Pacifica cat and dog food for our cat and dog. They were both raised on Science Diet. I thought SD was a good brand. I've noticed my cat eats substantially less with Acana, not because he doesn't like it, which he does, but because Acana seems to keep him satisfied longer. Also, his kitty litter doesn't smell anywhere near as bad as it did with SD. Our dog now eats all his food at once rather than waiting till he is so hungry he has to eat, as he has done for years with SD. Our dog also seems to defecate a lot more easily and his feces is wet. Our dog always had to strain to defecate with SD and his feces started becoming very dry and hard with SD -- that's why I decided to finally research dog and cat food brands. I am really glad I made the decision to switch their food to Acana. Yes, the food is more expensive than SD but they eat less and eat better and do seem happier.

review/summary: Acana Pacifica, an outstanding food!
review/text: I have a 1 yr old Portuguese Water Dog who has had a couple of issues with food. First, she doesn't tolerate much in the way of grain.  So any foods containing grains, even "easy to digest" foods with rice were a no-go for her.  I then tried a wonderful dehydrated food (which my 2 bichon girls do wonderfully on) but it still did not work for her. Even the grain free formulas made her poop 4 large stools a day.  She was always going!<br />Next issue is slightly dry and flakey skin.  It is clearning up now on Acana and her coat looking super shiny!<br />I do add raw food 'toppers' such as meat, egg, yogurt, organ meats for extra nutrition.  Makes me feel like I'm spoiling them a bit- and it's about a Tablespoon on top of her kibbles.<br /><br />Poop issue now that she is on Acana- not an issue!  Poops very small and firm twice a day right after meals.  Never any burping, gas or gurgling tummy either.  Good stuff!

review/summary: My dogs LOVE IT!
review/text: I bought the smaller 5.5lb bag just to try it out.<br />My dogs LOVE IT.  I have three dogs, two 15 year old Pekingese that are VERY picky eaters and a Great Pyrenees that will eat just about EVERYTHING. I switched from another holistic dog food brand to this one since this is GRAIN FREE (even though it has potato in it) and my picky eater couldn't get enough of it.<br />However, when you first open the package, you can definitely smell the fishiness of it.  It almost smells like those Asian style dried squid snack.  But it is a lot more moist than most dry dog food and I can tell it tastes better by smelling it and looking at the texture of the food.<br />I was going to get the Orijen Six Fish instead of this one because of the dog food review website I was looking at.  But after two hours spent reading user reviews from different websites, I found out Orijen had some serious problems with their dog and cat food where animals died or seriously injured after eating that brand.  So far, I haven't read or seen anything bad about Acana, so I went ahead and bought the bag to try it out.  I made sure I got the Pacifica one because it is one of the best kind of protein you can feed to your dogs (non-farmed fishes that is).  So far so good, but its something that will take longer than just a month or two to reach... in order for them to get "better", I suspect I will have to continue them on this product for at least a few months to see the real difference. Perhaps I will write an update then.

review/text: I don't know what the magic ingredient might be (perhaps fennel?), but I always feel better after drinking this tea when I have a stomachache or intestinal disturbance.<br /><br />Yogi is good at imparting complexity to its teas, and Stomach Ease has a pleasing blend of flavors. There is a medicinal tang to it, but that's nice when you want some healing action. The flavor is so good, I sometimes drink it when I'm feeling fine, just for fun.<br /><br />All the ingredients are organic: licorice root, cardamom seed, fennel seed, coriander seed, peppermint leaf, ginger root and black pepper. I can't detect the peppermint, which is good news for me, since I dislike minty teas. The other spices predominate.<br /><br />Stomach Ease might not do much for a serious stomach virus or chronic condition. But I find it amazingly effective for digestive disorders of the common sort.

If you do decide to try this, buy a small bag (silly me bought the 10 lb) in case your dogs don't care for it, like mine.

He was given about 6 months to live and it was suggested that he be put on a special prescription diet.  After much research, I found Organix to be a better quality food that met his dietary needs. Our vet was very impressed with the food and recommended it over the prescription food. My 16 year old dog has been eating Organix dog food for several years and is still very healthy. Castor and Pollux Organix foods are excellent!  My only complaint is that the Organix Indoor food is not available in a larger bag online.

review/summary: Great Cat Food!
review/text: As a member of the pet industry I'm happy to say that Organix cat food is my food of choice for my Snickers :) She's been doing great on this food, and I can see a difference in her skin and coat, and her overall health. I love the quality of the food as well as the fact that its organic. Great great food choice for those looking to switch their cats to something healthier!

review/summary: Excellent Cat Food for my cat with colitis, it works better then Vet's Rx Food
review/text: I'm feeding my cat for over a year, and his coltls improved !!! When I fed my cat Rx from the VeT's office it did nothing for my cat, so I was looking for the solution, and this is IT !!! Almost no colitis, and much less constupation, my Vet is ok with this food too, and my CAT loves the test of this food. This is an excellent cat food, it works better then Vet's Rx for my cat with colitis, this one is a super saver. I will recommend this food to all CAT and DOG owners. ORGANIX the only way to go Healthy Pets !!! Feed this food to your Pets and they sure will keep you company for many years. Amazon keep it in stock !!! I was looking for the larger 14.5 lbs bags, but did not find it will be great if Amazon will get it in stock.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: This is a great cat food with high amounts of meat. My two Bengals love it and chow down. This is a great break from other catfoods.<br /><br />HOWEVER... and this is a big however... I wish it didn't have rice and flaxseed in it. Carbs, even if organic, are still bad for cats over the long term. While the product itself is 5 starts I would not use this catfood in a long term diet. Once and a while it's probably fine but consider grain-free catfoods for their regular feeding.

review/summary: My cats wouldn't touch it.
review/text: I have 2 cats that like to throw up their food.  I thought I'd try something better for them to see if it helped.  I don't know because they wouldn't eat it.  But to be fair they are older cats and are probably just used to the junk food (regular store stuff) they have eaten all their lives.  The food may be fine if your cats will eat it.  I gave it 2 stars for the idea of better food.

review/summary: PRODUCT OF CHINA - DO NOT BUY!!!!
review/text: Only after I purchased this and opened it did I see 'Product of China'. They do not have to adhere to American food safety standards in China. BUY SOMETHING ELSE.<br /><br />I would rate this no stars but Amazon won't allow that.

review/summary: Bad packaging
review/text: Not as good as a previous purchase and all 24 cans were dented (some well beyond normal wear and tear).  As this cost about 25% more than the other brand available on Amazon, would have thought that the packaging and the quality would have been better.

review/summary: BEWARE: PRODUCT OF CHINA
review/text: not only is this product from China, but the cans were so badly dented, I could not tell if they are punctured.  The damage did not occur during shipping.  The case inside the shipping box was attempted to be taped up but it was in pieces.  Since I will not feed anything to my dogs from China, I requested a refund.  If I knew that this was a Product of China, I would not have purchased.

review/summary: QUALITY MACKEREL
review/text: When I open a can of this mackerel, I drain it, and while it is still in the can, run water over it and drain it a couple of times. Then I store it in the fridge without liquid in a sealed container. It looks good and smells good. But this is for my 13 year old Bouvier (dog). He's gotten a quarter of a cup per day mixed in with his dry kibble since he was 4 months old. He loves it. What I noticed is that he has been almost totally flea-free his whole life. I have shared this info with other dog owners who noticed that same anti-flea effect. Anyway, it is a great source of Omega-3 for him. Amazon's price was great and the free shipping made this a fantastic bargain.

review/text: This is much better than the Roland brand Mackerel ... more meat, less liquid.  I don't eat this; my dogs eat it in order to provide variety and fish oils.  I also use it to make microwave mackerel cookies for the dogs ... use as training or just treats.  GREAT mackrel!

review/summary: Mackerel in water with salt; tastes good. Product of China.
review/text: This mackerel tastes good. It is water with salt inside. The cans state that this a product of China. It is a "Chicken of the Sea" product though; so I thought it is worth trying. I read that the fish are hand packed into the cans after having machines gut and and remove the heads and tails of the fish. I have bought pink salmon from this same brand (USA salmon) which I like too.

review/text: There is way to much surgar in this hot chocolate it's like having sugar flavored chocolate, I am going to have to buy some pure powedered chocolate and mix it in the bag, other then that I would say it would taste good if it was not so sweet.
