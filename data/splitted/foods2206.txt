We have found we like it best when we mix 1/2 TBSP with 8 oz. of real apple cider.  You get the true apple cider flavor with the hint of caramel and that seems just about perfect.  Always best if you can use the real thing:)

review/text: I was really looking forward to tasting this cider. The result? It was a little disappointing. I was expecting a nice tart apple flavor with a hint of caramel, but it was the other way around. You definitely taste the caramel with a teeny tiny hint of apple. I added some raspberry powder flavoring, cinnamon, and honey to it to make it a little more flavorful. All-in-all, it's just okay. I wouldn't recommend this item to anyone unless they are LOVE caramel.

review/summary: Possibly the greatest soda EVER!
review/text: Ramune has to be one of the coolest and most unique soft drinks that I have ever seen. My kids had been dying to try this stuff ever since they had come across it on J-Box, the popular Japanese import webshop. Ramune is incredibly popular in it's native Japan, and now it looks like the fun is beginning to spread here in the States.<br /><br />To open a bottle of Ramune, you have to remove the top, pop out this little plastic plunger from it's casing, and then use the plunger to pop out a marble that seals the neck of the bottle. The neck of the bottle has two indentions that will hold the marble when you tip the bottle back to drink from it, keeping the neck of the bottle clear. Hold the bottle the wrong way, and the marble will clog things up. You can avoid carbonated overflow when opening by pressing gently on the plunger until it depresses the marble; knock it down with force and you're sure to get a fountain of spray.<br /><br />The original flavor reviewed here tastes a lot like Sprite, but Ramune also comes in several other flavors. It uses high fructose corn syrup and/or cane sugar as a sweetener (It lists both on the label, which usually means that it uses whatever is cheapest on the world market at the time of bottling. Listing both also means that they don't have to change their labeling every time they change sweetener.)<br /><br />This is a way fun product that kids (and most adults) will have a blast with. It's a smaller portion (8 ounces) than what we're used to here in the US, but that actually works out for us as we're trying to limit the amount of soda that our kids consume. Ramune works great as an occasional soda treat and the fun factor alone keeps us coming back for more. Ramune is easy to find at just about any Asian market, but for those who don't have easy access to one, ordering here on Amazon would be recommended.<br /><br />Also, for the safety conscious, I can attest that these drinks are very safe. We've never had a problem with the marble, and I can't find any reports on the internet that would indicate any safety concerns with this drink. It's not a choking hazard, in other words. Ramune means 'carbonated' in Japanese, and I can highly recommend this wonderful and very different drink.

review/text: If you ask me, the bottle is the coolest part of this product. There's a marble at the top and you have to push it through, then the bottle narrows in to catch it. That was very cool, always fun to open. As for the drink itself, it tasted a bit like Sprite (which I'm not a big fan of), only it has a very pungent after-taste that tastes a bit like cough syrup. I don't know, just buy it for the bottle to see what I'm talking about and pour it out, haha.

Unlike American soda's like coke and dr. pepper these are fruit flavored and have FAR less sugar and sodium in them making them a much healthier choice of beverage; as healthy as a soda could possibly be that is. All flavors taste great and the bottle is 100% recyclable. I'd recommend them to anyone.

review/summary: Sweet and creamy
review/text: I always said I hated white "chocolate" until I tried this.  I guess I never really had true white chocolate before.  This stuff is sweet, creamy and delicious!  You have to really want something sweet though.  It doesn't satisfy my craving for chocolate, but when dark chocolate just wont due (because I'm wanting something much sweeter) I like to nibble on both this white chocolate & intense dark chocolate creating a enjoyable snack!  The best of both worlds.<br />My one complaint is the non organic soy lecithin.  They don't say it's GMO free and soy lecithin is available in it's organic form (it didn't used to be) so there is no excuse not to make the switch.  Finding non-organic ingredients in certified organic foods is a big peeve of mine.<br />Aside from that, yum yum all the way.  If you've only had the cheap versions of white chocolate you don't know what your missing!<br /><br />Update:  Green & Black's is now owned by Kraft.  I will no longer be purchasing Green & Black's products.

review/summary: One of the Few Organic White Chocolate Bars...
review/text: I will admit that I am an avid white chocolate fan.  I cannot get anough of the stuff, although I love chocolate in general, sometimes white chocolate just taste better to me.  I will admit however that most white chocolate (even gourmet white chocolate like Godiva) is usually plasticy in texture.  The next best white chocolate I would say that is not organic are the Lindor white chocolate truffles.  Other than that, it is just tough to find a good high quality white choclate.<br /><br />  Even if you hate white chocolate, you may just like "Green and Black's" white choclate.  It has actual texture to it, but is still smooth and creamy in your mouth.  It is just too good to describe, you have to try it for yourself!<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy

review/summary: Best white chocolate EVER. Hands down.
review/text: Many things that people think of as "white chocolate" are actually confectionery coating---they have no cocoa butter in them at all. Even real white chocolate often has a chalky taste depending on the quality of the other ingredients. Green & Black's White Chocolate with Vanilla is the one type of white chocolate I've tried that never, ever has that chalky taste. It's unbelievably buttery, rich, and smooth, with specks of real vanilla throughout.<br /><br />Here's my favorite way to use G&B: heat up a cup and a half of whole milk to scalding hot (microwaving it works fine). Break up one bar of G&B white chocolate into small pieces. Whisk the pieces into the milk until smooth, then pour into two small mugs or glasses and serve. You could also add a shot of flavor syrup, a couple drops of natural almond extract, or a bit of liqueur to the drink for variety.

review/text: This is the best white chocolate I have ever had.  I am a big fan of pretty much all chocolate but white chocolate can be tricky, many I've tried are too waxy and have almost no taste.  I used to swear that Lindor made the best white chocolate (don't get me wrong, all of their chocolate is absolutely divine) but when it comes to white, this is the creamiest, most delightfuly sweet vanilla white chocolate ever.  I wouldn't say the same about the rest of the Green & Black's chocolates however, they are good, but they are a little too bitter for my tastes.

review/summary: excellent snack!
review/text: Garbanzo beans as a snack? Who would have though they'd make a great snack? The makers of the Good Bean have accomplished making a relatively healthy snack that taste good. When I first tried some I did have a reaction of "this is a bit chalky." But after a couple bites I got used to the texture. These are not similar to peanuts or tree nuts in texture. I like all four flavors although the Smokey/Chili could be spicier and have more lime flavor for my taste. The cinnamon is my least favorite but it is still a tasty treat. I really like mixing the pepper and sea salt together. The only downside in my view of the Good Bean is the sodium content. 7% daily sodium is higher than I'd like (each packet is 2 servings so one packet has a lot of sodium (over 300 mg). Nevertheless, as a snack these are a great, low-fat, high-fiber option.

review/text: Always on the lookout for a healthful, portable snack I ordered the variety pack so I could try each flavor. The chili-lime is definitely my favorite flavor with cinnamon, salt and pepper following, in that order. Overall the beans are good; one negative is the texture. A bit "powdery" on the inside... though it kinda grew on me; my expectation for texture were due to the product billed as "crunchy" so I was expecting the texture to be more like a roasted nut. But, that said, I would order again, though probably wouldn't order pepper again. I do think the beans would be good mixed with nuts for added flavor and texture.

You know you're getting a good snack when you don't have to eat the entire pack, and yet not putting on wasted calories!<br /><br />I recommend this treat for those who love to snack, but don't want to  eat the wrong things!

review/summary: grossly dissappointed
review/text: My overall impression is that they are dry, dry, DRY, DRY!!  Get it?. They have a very strange sort of powdery texture...and a lot smaller than they show on the bag or than any garbanzo bean I have ever tried. The sea salt flavor tastes a lot like roasted, salted soybeans...I was hoping it would be better than that. All of the other flavors are contained in a crunchy coating on the outside of the bean. The cinnamon tastes very cinnamon-y without being sweet. The chili is slightly spicy. The cracked pepper tastes little different to me than the sea salt flavor. I will not purchase again and made the mistake of buying a mixed case......not cheap either....wonder if I can just boil them back to life?

review/summary: These are just okay
review/text: This is a high protein, low fat, and relatively low sugar snack. My overall impression is that they are dry, dry, DRY. They've got a weird, sort of powdery texture. (Yeah -- dry.) However, assuming that doesn't bother you, the flavors aren't bad. The sea salt flavor tastes a lot like roasted, salted soybeans -- pretty good. All of the other flavors are contained in a crunchy coating on the outside of the bean, presumably stuck to the beans with cane juice. The cinnamon tastes very cinnamon-y without being sweet. The chili is slightly spicy. The cracked pepper tastes little different to me than the sea salt flavor. I have not purchased again and probably won't. My family had zero interest in digging into these.

review/text: Looking for a delicious crunchy snack that won't go straight to your waistline? These paper thin - beautifully seasoned crackers hold up perfectly on their own and to any/all of your favorite toppings. Hummus, cheese (hard and spreadable), vegetable wafers (cucumbers, zucchini, roasted peppers etc), chip dips, salsa... I could go on forever. At 120 calories for 19 crackers (0 calories from fat) these wonderful wafers will satisfy any snack attack and you'll feel great about eating them. I initially found these in a "Health Food Store" but Amazon sells and ships them for cheaper money. Quality was as good or better. Well... that's what I think. Oh, and YUM!

review/text: This is and has been my favorite cereal since I was a kid. It stays crispy in milk for a while. It has only 3 grams of sugar, but the sweetness of the rice immensely helps out with the taste, so you really dont need that extra sugar anyway.<br />I was thrilled to finally see that Amazon carried Kellogg's Crispix Corn & Rice Cereal, 17.9-Ounce Boxes, as our local grocer only carried the smaller 11-12oz boxes, for about the same price.<br />With these being just under a Lincoln per box, it is comparable to my local grocer, even with coupons.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon

review/text: I love mushrooms. I been eating them all my life. From fresh to dried to brined. I wouldn't call these mushrooms, but rather a mess. This is a 3rd different roland brand mushrooms I bought and all 3 been mediocre at best. I think the problem is 2 fold. 1, the mushroom come in this flavorless goo that it suffocates it. 2 preboiling them kills the flavor and makes it taste like cardboard. I have had these dried and brined before and all the time they had texture to them. These do not have any flavor or texture. Dissapointed. You are better off buying fresh button mushrooms than these!

In addition, these canned goodies contain very minimal preservatives to keep them healthy. That's why I feel safe eating these breakfast sausages as often as I could.

Echinacea provides a slight tingle on the tongue due to the presence of alkylamides.<br /><br />Traditional Medicinals recommends drinking 5-6 cups a days as soon as symptoms appear and then gradually reducing the dosage as symptoms improve.<br /><br />Numerous clinical studies have examined the effects of Echinacea.  Echinacea stimulates activity of cells that fight infection in our bodies and increases the number of these cells such as the white blood cells and lymphocytes. These immune cells attack bacteria, viruses and abnormal cells, including cancer.  Echinacea has a positive effect on wound  healing, lessens symptoms and speeds recovery from viruses.<br /><br />Echinacea also has anti-inflammatory properites which aids recovery from psoriasis and eczema and may help arthritis.  It also may increase resistance to candida, bronchitis and herpes and other infectious conditions.  Echinacea should not be used continually for any longer than 5-8 weeks.

review/summary: Best tea ever . . . for the benefits
review/text: I think people these days would benefit from being schooled in writing an appropriate review.  Really now.  I'm on here because of the person that gave this product 2 stars.  This product is well known in the voice over/singing  business - as the best tea for the benefits it provides.  You do have to steep it a while before drinking & in my opinion, the tea is not very paletable.  But I am willing to drink it for the benefits it provides.  If you are a singer or voice over artist - it does exactly what it says: it coats your throat & you can sing or talk for a very long time.  It's worth a try & the Slippery Elm DOES indeed coat your throat.<br /><br />Thanks ~<br />Rose of Rose Recordings, LLC<br />rosecllc dot com

review/text: I never rate things on here but I had to make an exception for this tea. Usually any hot drink will alleviate some discomfort in a sore throat, but this throat coat tea goes above and beyond that. No matter if it's a sore throat from sinus drainage, a cold, or whatever else, this tea has always cleared up all the itchy, scratchy, and painful problems I've had for at least a couple of hours at a time. That's more than a lot of medicine is able to do.

review/text: Very French, Very Roast is what I call it. Not quite the connoisseur yet but it's a Darker Roast where the bean is crunchy and brittle.<br />The aroma and the flavor achieved by the Maillard reaction is Tres Francais (Pun Well intended) as Maillard my dear friends was French.)<br />This little roasted bean gives rise to a huge stalk of Coffee; so use less than your typical breakfast blend to brew. For the price it's a steal compared to a Starbucks.

review/summary: French Roast - Community Coffee
review/text: I ordered three bags of community coffee for a super happy lucky inexpensive price.  The coffee arrived quickly as described.<br /><br />The coffee beans were shiny and deliciously fragrant when we opened the bag.  We ground the beans and brewed the coffee, and it tasted fantastic.  The French Roast had a nice, dark, "awesome coffee" flavor.<br /><br />This coffee isn't for people who like freeze dried Folger's crystals or gas station coffee.  If you buy your coffee already ground, why are you reading coffee reviews, just buy whatever crap you usually do.<br /><br />THIS COFFEE tastes like Mike Ditka made it.  It is filled with awesome.<br /><br />My wife tried the coffee that I brewed, and she said that it made her want to wear a t-shirt with three wolves and a moon on it.  After she drank the coffee, all she wanted to do was ***********.  We ignored our friends and family for two weeks while we did nothing but drink fresh ground fresh brewed Community Coffee and *****************.<br /><br />Seriously guys, if you need that something extra to make a spark for you and your significant other, buy this Community Coffee.

review/summary: Excellent quality, but may be a bit too strong.
review/text: With hundreds (if not thousands) of coffee brands and/or types, it's tough to choose one, especially online without tasting.  I took a shot at Community Coffee's whole-bean French Roast.  I bought a Hamilton Beach coffee bean grinder, so I refuse to buy pre-ground coffee.  Psychologically, doing so would negate the value that the coffee-bean grinder would provide to me.<br /><br />With that aside, 2 of the 3 bags of coffee that came in the package were shrink-wrapped, meaning that you could see the shapes of the coffee beans through the package since it was vacuum sealed.  The other package was loose, like you'd see at your typical grocery store. I'm pretty sure it didn't effect the quality of the brew, but it's just something that I noticed.<br /><br />Moving on to the bottom line here: the coffee tastes good, but might be too strong for some.  I'm used to good 'ole McDonald's coffee, which to me, is decent.  I like Peet's and various Sumatra blends from Coffee Bean and Starbucks, but herein lies the issue with choosing coffee: how do you know how strong a particular coffee is going to be?  A solid solution would be to rate the coffee on a scale of 1-10, 1 being weak and 10 being super-strong.  In using this guideline, I'd rate this coffee a 10 in terms of strength.  It's great early in the morning when you need a quick jolt of caffeine, but not-so-good in the afternoon or evening.<br /><br />Anyhow, this was worth a shot...I plan on ordering more Community Coffee, just a weaker blend.

review/summary: You get what you pay for, so true.
review/text: Living in Alabama, I was pretty excited at the prospect of buying coffee online from our neighbor to the West.<br />The price for Three 12 oz bags of "French Roast" whole bean coffee  was mighty tempting, also, since I could order enough to have FREE delivery, thus saving over 10.00 for the same amount bought at the local store.<br /> The Good news: shipment was FAST..Ordered on a Friday, had the beans in hand Tuesday afternoon.<br /><br /> Opened a bag, found lightly oily fresh smelling beans ( this is good) but noticed instead of the expected uniform dark dark chocolate to black color, there were mixed light brown to dark brown beans...not good. Uneven roast.<br /> I have been drinking whole bean French and Expresso roast coffee since mid 70's, grinding my own every morning, and have been using the Aero Press for almost a year now, so I KNOW what a good cup of coffee is supposed to taste like. Rarely have not had decent uniformity in my  morning coffee all these years of using French roast whole bean.<br />  So, I whipped up a cup, in the usual way.<br />Blecccch.<br />Light thin brew, not much body or flavor.<br />Nowhere near the depth of body and taste of either Starbucks or Fresh Market French roast whole bean coffee I had been buying.<br />Reminded me of the time I had made a mistake of buying A&P whole bean coffee.<br /><br />  Just to be fair, I made a 2nd batch,<br />No improvement.<br />A thin tasting cup of coffee, more akin to a very strong cup of name brand ground canned coffee than to fresh ground whole bean dark French roast.<br /> Sigh....stuck with 6 bags of this stuff, which of course I can freeze and mix in a handful with a bag of the Starbucks  that I now  have to go out and buy tomorrow at the grocery store.<br /> Disappointing...

review/summary: Anyone knows.....
review/text: Anyone knows that if you are going to bake a country ham, you need to soak it.  Soak it in something that will allow the water to cover the ham.  Soak it for 2 days, changing the water twice per day.  I soak mine in a cooler and put some ice in it to keep it fresh.  When I was a chef in a restaurant, I would soak them in the walk-in, still remembering to change the water twice per day.  If you are going to fry the ham and make a red eye gravy, I would slice the ham and only soak the slices for a couple of hours, pat dry and then fry, making sure you do not fry it too much.  If you do, you will find that it becomes extraordinarily salty.<br /><br />For the person who wrote the review in January of 2012, I would suggest two things.  Make sure you read a recipe when you start using a new product, and number two, do not become intoxicated before you type.

Steer clear of the glass shards and you'll be fine. I pick them out with scotch tape which I tap all over the ham before cooking. Otherwise its an excellent product.

And note that I mention money, because I hope you have a lot of it if you want to buy some of this delicious salsa. I don't know why it's so expensive, but I guess mouth-kicking, life-changing flavor like this only comes from tomatoes hand-roasted by magical elves, and magical elves don't come cheap. So save up your pennies, mortgage your home and buy a few jars. You won't regret it.
