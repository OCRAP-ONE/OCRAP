review/summary: Very good product!
review/text: Having recently discovered that what is sold for cinnamon in my area is not really true cinnamon and that producers are not required to specify on the product what it truly is and that it contains high amounts of coumarin, I am truly shocked.  I found the Indus Ceylon Cinnamon to have a very delightful aroma and flavor.  I plan to continue to use Ceylon cinnamon in the future.  Thanks for a great product!

review/text: I ordered this for my mother who has arthritis in her back to use with raw honey everyday for the anti-inflmmatory effects of the cinnamon... I have not tasted this particular brand but I use Ceylon cinnamon myself from another source and it is very mild, sweet and tasty...I particularly like that it came in a jar for my mother's use... that did sway my choice

review/summary: Review for Indus brand Ceylon Cinnamon
review/text: To whom it may concern,<br /><br />I recently received my order from "Indus Spice Company" of 16 ounces of Ceylon Cinnamon.  When I opened the package and tasted the product, I was shocked that it didn't have the sweet taste of the Ceylon Cinnamon I had bought from "My Sage Spice Company" last year.  When I put some in my mouth, there was hardly any taste.  It's texture was gritty and the small bits seemed to stay in my mouth which was annoying.  I paid about $12.00 more for the pound of Indus Ceylon Cinnamon because it was organic.  Since it was organic, I thought it might taste better.  I was so wrong.  Now, I've since bought the product from My Sage Spice Company again as I had last year.  My only problem is how to return the Indus Company Ceylon Cinnamon and hopefully get my money back.  I would appreciate any help you could give me in negotiating the return of the Indus Company product.<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Mike Waterworth

review/summary: Really yummy miso
review/text: I love this soup but can not purchase it nearby. This miso is white and has a rich, creamy flavor. It's my favorite miso. It's low calorie, low fat, high protein. I sometimes have one for breakfast and it satisfies me until lunch or eat one during those late morning or mid afternoon craving times. A twelve pack gives you 36 servings, perfect! It comes in a nice display box, easy to slide into your cupboard or pantry.

review/summary: Instant Miso
review/text: I ordered this after reading the few reviews and decided to give this a try. Basically, one large pack holds 3 individual packs of one serving. Tear open the first and take out the three packets. Relatively simple, and not messy at all. I poured one packet into a cup of hot water (the packet recommends anywhere from 2/3 cup of hot water or more) and waited for it to cool down after stirring. The scent that came from it was very delicious, a great miso aroma, and the first sip was spot on with a lot of the miso I've tried in restaurants. I loved how everything dehydrated came back to life after about 5 minutes of it cooling down, and found every bite delectable. I was very happy with the soup, as I am a fan of miso. The texture, and taste were fantastic and I'm very happy with it. The only issue was despite stirring it frequently while it cooled, when I was finished there was still about half a teaspoon of the mix that, well, didn't mix. But it did not take away from any part of the soup. Will definitely buy again. :-)

review/text: This product has excellent reviews (Except mine of course) and was going to purchase it until I read the ingredients...Did any of these people read them????? I don't think so. Sure it's high in protein, sure it's low calorie. But did anyone realize it has MSG????????? Now, I am not going to lecture you about how bad it is for you. I am sure you are capable of doing your own research (Or at the very least you should if you are into eating healthy). My advice is DO NOT BUY this product if you care about your health. In fact do not buy anything that contains MSG. It's poison for your body.

review/text: I was skeptical at first, but my "wolfie" has been on a raw diet for a while, so this seemed like a good companion snack. Surprisingly, "dried" doesn't always mean lack of moisture, as these are some juicy morsels that keep my pet performing tricks for treats until I give out. Each one is a generous portion, even for my baby who's a pretty big boy, so I always slice them before feeding. It's also great to aid those sometimes finicky eaters, as an occasional sliced topper for meals. The package may seem small, but a little goes a long way.

review/summary: Cats love these!
review/text: I bought these recently for my two kitties that eat a grain-free diet.  I thought these would make a nice treat and boy, I was not disappointed.  They love these so much they refuse to accept any other treats I offer.  As another reviewer said, these are too big to be bite-size for a cat, so I cut them up (which is kinda gross, but better for them).  They're a bit stinky to me but they store easily and one package will last a good while for my two cats.  They absolutely love these.  As soon as they see me grab the bag and head for the kitchen shears, they come running.  They purr as they eat them, and then they come over and thank me with plenty of rubs and more purrs.  These are definitely unbeatable, and I'll be trying out a few more of the other varieties as well to see what they like best.  A bit pricey when compared to cheapo grain and cheese snacks, but well worth the extra expense to feed them something better suited to their diet that they love.

review/text: These are not only a great deal, but very delicious, too!  And, they are a low-cal, guilt-free treat when you wrap them around broccoli slaw with mung bean sprouts, sesame seeds, lime juice, a little chili oil, cilantro, sugar or Splenda.... Great way to get creative and hands-on with your food!  The kids loved it!!  We dunk them in a little sweet chili sauce.  One thing to note: I think it says to soak them in water for 30 seconds or so.  Really, it only needs 5-7 seconds.  It might seem like it's not soft enough yet, but take it out anyway!  It continues to absorb the water and soften for the next few minutes.  The wrapping technique takes a few tries to perfect, but you don't feel bad about eating your trial runs!!  We ate them fresh, not fried or baked.  Although, I'm sure that would be delicious, too.  I bought the 3pks.  There are several in each pack, and they're shelf stable.  So, at this price, go for the 3pk!  You'll want to wrap these babies around everything!  Leftover coleslaw is what we're wrapping today!

But I instantly liked them and now keep a bag in my car, in my office, and even by my bed. They have a cocoa essence, a nice crunch, and I love the texture and taste that the sunflower seeds add.  I decided to see what my housemate and friends thought so I had them try them too.  Everyone so far has immediately liked them.  They don't take the place of a nice dark piece of chocolate, but I used to snack on cheetos or baked lays, and now I have a snack I enjoy more and is much better for me.

For a snack, the list of ingredients seemed pretty healthy (healthier than chips or pretzels, for sure), so I ordered a box of 6 pouches. They aren't bad, but definitely wouldn't be my first choice as a crunchy snack. They have a chocolatey taste and a nice crunch, but don't keep my satisfied for long. The chocolate taste is a a bit artificial. I would try another flavor, but maybe start wtih one pouch from the health food store to see if I like them enough to order an entire box!

review/summary: satisfying crunchy cocoa snack
review/text: I am a lowcarb high protein dieter, and sometimes I crave a crunchy snack. The sunflower seeds up the protein and give them a healthy punch. They are handy portable and yummy.It is not like chocolate candy, more like a little cookie/cracker/granola.For me it gives me the sweet and salty I crave. I also like the sea salt , and sante fe salsa flavors. I use the subscribe and save program and always have some on hand.

review/summary: Good Nutritional Value, but Taste Like Stale Cookies.
review/text: I first discovered Somersaults a couple weeks ago and they were quite good. Not only did they taste exceptional (Sea Salt and Salt and Pepper varieties), but the nutritional content was excellent, quite in contrast to most snacks. As such, I bought a third variety and this one was the Dutch Cocoa. Alas, I just don't care for these at all. The first two tasted like a very interesting salty and nutty snacks. These tasted like stale cookies. Okay, some people might like them, but I'm not one of those. I'd still say that they're good in their nutritional value, but I don't care for the taste on this variety. I'm going to have trouble finishing the bag.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: So Wonderful!
review/text: These are different than any other anchovy I had ever tried.  I first had tried then when I was in cooking school.  I was just blown away!  I know it sounds counter intuitive, but they are less salty and have much more depth of flavor.  The can is quite large but you can keep them for about a year/year and a half.  Once you open the can and have used the amount you need, just cover the top of the anchovies COMPLETELY with salt so you cannot see them.  I then put a layer of plastic wrap then foil to seal.  When using the anchovies, pull the number you need out of the can, soak them in water or milk for a few minutes to remove all of the salt.  You will need to remove the fillets from the backbone.  What you end up is an incredibly wonderful fillets.  Use them in pasta sauce and everyone will ask you for the secret.  Combine a few with melted butter, brush on crostini toasts then top with a little mild cheese.  Your guests will gobble them up and ask for more.  They will not know this is your secret ingredient.

review/summary: Old World Delights
review/text: These traditional Italian and Greek culinary delights are preserved in the ancient manner (Brine and Salt) and are from the perennial fishing grounds of the Meditterean Sea rather than Peru or who knows where? These are premium Anchovies whose quality far exceeds the supermarket variety. These anchovies are nothing like the slender, stiff, olive oil soaked fillet "saltbombs" found in the little 2OZ tins or glass jars at supermarkets everywhere. It would take about 16 of these tiny 2 OZ cans to approximate the same amount sold here. At up to $2.50 for 2OZ fillets X 16 the economic advantage becomes clear. In any case, it is the exceptional quality, size and flavor that should guide your purchase.<br /> As a bonus (if prepared correctly) they have a much reduced sodium content. It is true that they require simple preparation: Rinse the salt and soak in fresh water for about a 1/2 hour before filleting and easily removing the spine bone and optionally scales. A simple task that is rewarded by a supple, meaty anchovy fillet that makes any dish requiring anchovies as good as it can get. I usually soak and fillet the contents of the entire can in advance and put them in a small jar submerged in olive oil and store in the refrigerator for long term availability. You can also store the unused portion in the can they were packed in by salting the next exposed layer as the item description suggests but, for me, fiddling with plastic wrap and exposing the fish to absorb the flavor of the can in the refrigerator is solved by re-packing them in a convienient sealable container.<br />Used in pasta dishes with roasted grape tomatoes,sliced garlic, and olive oil(Acciughe + Pomodoro) you'll soon wish the can was even bigger. Try a three or four of them mashed with a few cloves of garlic & a tablespoon or two of tomato paste and add to beef stew for that subltle "Umami" flavor that enhances the beef flavor without any "Fishy" taste. Diners (including fussy children) will detect there's somthing special, but will not suspect fish had anything to do with it. It has the same effect as Worchester sauce or Thai fish sauce which is essentially fermented fish. These savory anchovies melt away in a variety of sauces and stews. Great(for anchovy lovers) on Pizza, salads, Anchovy butter for steaks- you get the idea... Having them handy will encourage their regular use. You will definitly want to add them to your regular cooking arsenal.

review/text: These were exactly what I was expecting.  Growing up in a Greek traditional house my Mom had salted sardines at every major event.  We would by 10 lbs at a time, rinse the salt and other things that naturally come along with it that we would not eat.  In a glass jar soak them in apple cider vinegar for a couple of days in the fridge.  Yum!  The only disappointing thing is the price.  I know my parents would not have spent $20 on 2 lbs.  It is shocking how expensive they have become. I wish I could find them for less as I would order them more.

review/text: Great product, but I ordered in August and shipping took a few days.  I didn't feel so great receiving a very warm can of fish.  I immediately opened it and placed it in the fridge.  At first it was a little soupy but is firmed up and the contents were fine.  Actually, peeling the filets off is pretty simple just do it under running water and start from the head end and peel off one filet at a time - takes about 10 seconds per fish.  As others have said, they are not as salty as oil packed because you really need to rinse them off.  Also, soaking these fish first is completely unnecessary.  Just run them under water while you peel and they are perfectly fine and not salty once they are boneless - soaking in milk or water for twenty to thirty minutes does nothing but waste time.

After reading the "Cod and Country" cookbook I began removing all the anchovies from the can and keeping them in one of those "glad ware" containers.  Just pour on some extra salt and seal the container.  This does keep the anchovies well.

In fact, we prefer the maltitol-sweetened ice cream to all others including commercial premium brands.<br /><br />Jorge recommends limiting your consumption of alcohol sweeteners to 100 gms to avoid flatulence. I have not found this to be a problem with the ice cream whereas it has occurred with xylitol sweetened iced tea.<br /><br />Give it a try.

review/text: splenda type sweeteners wont work with chocolate; theyre not sweet enough. this stuff does the trick. its about as sweet as honey is, in my opinion. great stuff. but dont over do it... if you ever tried to make/bake anything sweet with splenda and it didnt taste right, you should try this stuff.

review/text: Warning:<br />Maltitol can produce intestinal gas, bloating, and diarrhea. Even if you don't exceed recommended amounts, you can still get sick like I did. Don't exceed 100mg (just under half a cup) in a day, or you'll become very, very sick. Don't say I didn't warn you.

review/text: Only after I ordered this product did I become aware of the adverse side effects of use of it! Use in moderation and with care.  The manufacturer says it can cause diarrhea if too much is ingested, but that's not how it affected me!  Flatulence!  Not diarrhea, just massive amounts of flatulence! Not very nice- so don't ingest if you plan to attend any kind of social gatherings!

review/summary: Warning!  WARNING!  -ALCOHOL SUGARS!
review/text: Buyer Beware Please!  This sweetner is not for everybody. Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body. You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell. I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before. I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping. As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant. Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetner could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market. The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetner* down to the very bottom of the label and read "maltitol" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little.  I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ... it's the maltitol!

review/summary: These do keep me from getting hungry.
review/text: When I saw this product on the supermarket shelf my curiosity was piqued both by the name and the claim they would release energy throughout the morning and keep me from becoming hungry.  I bought one box - at a lower price than the Amazon price because it was a featured item - and began my experiment.  I'm very happy to say that I'm impressed.<br /><br />I have now finished the five packets in the box (with four breakfast biscuits per packet) and can say they taste very good and definitely do work.  I have one packet of the biscuits, a serving of yogurt and a piece of fresh fruit and this combination holds me for at least four hours, often past that if I'm super busy.  I like the crispness of the biscuits and the fact that they were all completely whole in their packets yet not hard.  The flavor of cinnamon brown sugar was not overwhelmingly sweet, just enough for that tiny satisfying taste.  From a nutritional standpoint, the four biscuits contain 230 calories, 80 of which come from fat.  There is no high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils or artificial flavors or sweeteners.  They contain 3g dietary fiber (12% daily need) and 8g total fat (also 12%).<br /><br />For a convenient way to satisfy your breakfast-on-the-go, this product is quite outstanding.  Just remember that you do need to add other healthy items to make them a totally nutritional breakfast.  I'm definitely looking forward to trying other flavors.<br /><br />I do wonder about the name though.  At first I thought it was some weird take-off on a well known cheese-like product!!

review/summary: Ok chocolate, but too expensive for what you get
review/text: I have been on the search for an erythritol or xylitol sweetened chocolate for a while.  I found this on amazon and was thrilled that it is sweetened with xylitol.  The $14.99 price tag freaked me out a little, but I took the plung anyway.  Well, the bag is really, really small.  You don't get much chocolate for that hefty $14.99 price.  Maybe a dozen little individually wrapped chocolates.  I guess I should have read the description better, or I fooled myself into thinking each piece of chocolate was bigger than it is. The chocolate tastes pretty good, has a bit of a crunch to it.  It doesn't melt in your mouth like other 60% and higher cocoa bars do.  If it were cheaper, I would probably buy more to see if I could cook with it.  However, had I known just how small the bag is, and just how few pieces of chocolate I was getting, I would not have purchased this.  I gave it 3 stars because it does taste good, but it is just way too pricey for what you get.  If you have a diabetic friend and want to splurge on a treat, this would be a nice gift.

The bag had a bit of powder and some very small bits in it, but aside from that all of the mushrooms were of good quality.<br /><br />A few had stems that never really re-hydrated (a good fresh shitake often has a tender enough stem you can eat it along with the rest of the mushroom), so that was a waste of money, but most were good.<br /><br />These wood ears are not quite the same as the tree ears I am used to (re-hydrating to a brown color and not being quite as crispy as the tree ears I have used before).<br /><br />On the whole, this is a good price of a whole bunch of dried mushrooms in one bag.

review/summary: Dried tart cherries from the Cherry Capital of the World!
review/text: My first experience with dried tart cherries was when I went to visit a friend from Traverse City, Michigan about ten years ago.  As a teenager, she had worked in the cherry plant removing pits from the fruit, not uncommon for natives of the Cherry Capital.  She took me down to Meijers to buy a box of dried tart cherries to carry home on the plane as a special treat.<br /><br />Then a few years ago, I began buying cherries at Trader Joe's and they became a pantry staple for me. Once I realized my friend could get them on sale at Meijers and ship them to me for a significant savings and slight quality advantage over the ones I had been buying, I asked her to do that several times.  It never occurred to me to look for them on Amazon where the cost is about the same as having them shipped from Traverse City and I won't have to bother my friend.<br /><br />Normally I do not buy sweetened fruit of any kind but the slight amount of sugar is necessary due to the tartness of the cherries, much as lemonade or cranberry juice must be sweetened, and it is completely unnoticeable.  A slight bit of oil is also required to keep them from turning into a solid mass of moist chewy goodness!<br /><br />A few of these are great in smoothies, but not too many, as the flavor is very intense.  I also enjoy them in oatmeal and cold cereals, with milk chocolate, and out-of-hand as a snack.  Once, after carelessly mistaking them for raisins and adding them to scones, I got a very pleasant surprise!  They are great in rice pudding, cr&egrave;me br�l&eacute;e, ice cream, and chicken salad.<br /><br />A wonderful one-dish lunch or light summer supper is "Barley, Bacon and Avocado Salad with Roasted Chicken", but with these dried tart cherries added.  The recipe is easy to find on the internet.<br /><br />If you ever have the chance to go to Traverse City to see the cherry blossoms or the fall leaves up on the peninsula, please take advantage of the opportunity as you will surely enjoy it.  Now if I could just get Honeybell tangelos from Amazon, I'd be set!<br /><br />These are the smaller half-pound containers that make great little gifts.  The bulk box is a bit less expensive by weight:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H7LVKY">Traverse Bay Dried Cherries, 4-Pound Box</a>.

review/summary: Ah, perfection!
review/text: As you can see from the reviews for the other sized containers of these cherries, they are really something special!  I used to choose my breakfast cereal from a cupboard full of 20 or so assorted varietes of cold cereals to keep more morning meal interesting, but now that I have these cherries, I actually look forward to having the same oatmeal with cherries every morning!  I sprinkle a handful in the bowl with 3/4 c. quick oats and 1 cup milk (for the calcium), microwave for 2 minutes, and it just makes my morning; and I am fully satisfied until lunch.  The cherries have the perfect amount of tartness and are soft enough to chew easily (not dried and leathery like some dried fruit).  Also, they don't come in bags, as advertised here, but in clear round containers with replaceable lids.  And they are cheaper than the bagged SunMaid ones in the grocery store!  This quantity lasted me about two months, so I just bought some more.

review/text: I loved these.  They did look a lot like raisins...but tasted better.  Some were more dried up than others.  Some were really "meaty".  They came in 4 plastic sealed transparent plastic tubs. The plastic tubs were about the size of a normal tub of store-bought pimento cheese spread. There were no pits or stones in any of the ones I got. I understand that finding pits or stones is not an unusual occurrence with dried cherries, but I didn't have any. I wouldn't like to chew down on one unknowingly.  Next time I plan to order the larger box of these.  I didn't use them as any thing but a snack, but I would like to try them in a dessert bread.  I have had them in salads before and if they are given time to "plump up" they are very good.

review/summary: great cherries!
review/text: I bought these because my toddler loves to snack on dried cherries, but the cost of getting dried cherries can be a little rough.  I was buying Mariani (sp?) brand bags from the store, which ran almost 4 dollars for just a couple ounces.  I figured there had to be something better. So I ordered this to see if it would work out, as 2 lbs for 14.00 and change (using subscription), was quite a bit cheaper. I have to agree with the other ratings: these cherries are awesome!  They have much better "cherry" flavor than the Mariani ones, have better color, and are just a tad softer to boot.  They're dried, but not so dried out that they're ridiculously tough like dried fruits can be.  The tart cherry flavor comes through really well, while not being bitter eating. I've been tempted to snack on them myself a few times! Having them in small containers versus all in one bag is also extremely handy for keeping the supply fresh.  If Amazon keeps the price this good, I won't be buying from the store ever again.

review/text: These dried cherries, along with the blueberries from this same company, are soft and a nice texture and flavor. They are not the typical tough, dry, chewy, dried fruit you normally get from other places. These work very well in homemade breads or just to snack on. I'm anxious to try some of Traverse Bay's other products as well now that I'm so happy with their dried fruits. Very good quality product.
