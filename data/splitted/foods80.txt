review/summary: To salty, dident microwave right.
review/text: I am a lover of pork rinds so i was really looking forward to eating fresh ones, neathers to say they dident cook in 5 mins like it says it would and if you put it in that long most would burn to a crisp by that time, another thing that really dident appel to me is that the taste is like they poured tones of salt on them before they packaged them.... i wanted to eat pork rinds NOT salt, if i wanted to salt i would just get it from the salt in my seasons cabnet...very disappointed...

review/text: In all fairness my friend absolutely loves this product.  I purchased it based upon his suggestion.  Unfortunately, the smell (oil I am assuming) of it cooking made me feel ill.  Even though the product cooked perfectly, the smell lingered in my microwave for well over a day.

review/text: I considered buying these but the health risks should be considered.<br /><br />These are cured, stored with salt, and have nitrates.<br /><br />If you look on the american cancer society web site you will see that those are cancer causing concerns.<br /><br />you can still eat well when avoiding such things.

review/text: I have popped several of these bags in the past week, And every single one of them does not pop up as much as they used to. They used to pop up like a bag of popcorn does, These bags stay very flat in the microwave oven, And when you take the bag out you have to be very quick about opening it, Or it implodes and sticks together!<br /><br />I used to purchase these Microwave Pork Rinds direct from the company, And had never had a problem until now.<br /><br />So it's up to you to decide if you want to buy these or not, They are very tasty and very healthy for you too!

review/summary: i REALLY didnt want to like these
review/text: my husband loves pork rinds, i however was freaked even thinking about "deep friend pork skin" but i am always willing to try new things so over the years i have choked down countless brands of pork rinds to appease my husband.<br /><br />one day i was at work (at a hotel) and i notice over on the snacks for sale shelf microwaveable pork rinds. i was like WTF you gotta be kidding me, so being the good wife i am i buy them (more as a joke than anything else) for my husband well he zapped them bad boys and started happily munching away, oohing and ahhhing over how good they were, so i tried one (i refused to tell him that it was pretty good)..over time i bought him more, even ordering them thru the hotel (ya employee discount!!) and he noticed that i would ever so casually walk by and snatch one from his bag. finally i gave up and just made myself a bag. i am now hopelessly addicted however no longer work for the hotel so i needed a new supplier....lol<br /><br />our microwave has a popcorn button, on a whim i gave it a shot figuring it would be a microwave disaster, much to my surprise i got PERFECT bags of porky crunchy goodness EVERY TIME, and when i say perfect i mean not one single under done or burn piece. for the life of me i cant figure out HOW the microwave can use the same button to make popcorn and the pork rinds so perfectly. but i chalk it up to magic<br /><br />be forewarned if you have dogs.....these are doggy crack, (yes i know...don't give the dogs people food...yadda yadda) i am convinced if you waved one of these little buggers in front of your dog and told him to speak, he wouldn't bark, he would recite Shakespeare. i have never seen my dogs go that crazy over ANYTHING else

review/summary: If Popcorn and Bacon Had a Baby
review/text: My day had been nothing exceptional.  I had forgotten to take lunch and the afternoon was dragging.  Upon returning to my desk I saw a bag of these on my desk that had been here for a few days; a gift from a friend.  I decided to take them to the microwave and give them a try.  I fully expected to "pop" them and open the door to the worst smell I could fathom.  Imagine my surprise when the bell dinged and I opened the door to the delicious smell of still sizzling savoriness that is Lowrey's How n Spicy Bacon Curls.  It was like cherubim descended from heaven and placed God's favorite snack in my mouth.  I was bathed in a pillar of light and from nowhere the volume rose to a crescendo of Beethoven's 9th Symphony.  At that moment I realized that my life had been building to this moment ... this one perfect instant in time.  I felt as if my tongue was nodding in approval and I shed a single tear of joy.  If I have another son I will name him Lowrey.

review/text: We really love this product.  Many times we have bought pork rinds from the store and have had to toss them out because they were no longer fresh.  But Lowrey's Microwave Pork Rinds are made fresh each time you microwave a bag. It's amazing how much the 1.75 ounce bag makes - more than enough to share.  If I have a complaint, it's that they are a bit salty.  My husband & I have remedied that by adding them to our popcorn (we pop on the stove), then the salt is dispersed into the popcorn. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K3LQ1E">Lowrey's Bacon Curls, Microwave Pork Rinds (18 Bags, Original 1 case</a>

review/text: I'm currently deployed and I'm on a low carb and high protein diet.  But my current location doesn't allow me to go out into town easily to get the type of foods that would keep me on my diet. So i ordered this from amazon.<br /><br />Pros<br />fast shipping!<br />taste great<br />Zero carbs<br /><br />cons<br />does make the room smell once you open the package<br />so be mindful of anybody else who might complain. just open it outside, through a window, or stand under a ventilation fan.<br /><br />I've read reviews of people have trouble cooking it. here's my method.<br /><br />-the instructions says cook for 2 minutes, but i set it to 3 minutes.<br />-after 45 seconds I open the door flip the package and shake it to spread the pieces out again<br />-after another 45 seconds i flip the package one more time and help the bag expand by just shaking the pieces around.<br />-then I'll let cook for about a total time of 2:10-2:20 then stop and open the bag and place the rinds in a bowl or container.<br /><br />I'll then look through to see if any have not expanded yet. I'll just throw them in the microwave without the bag on a plate or napkin and just let them cook for a minute.<br /><br />there, you are done!<br /><br />i like to dip them in hot sauce. ENJOY!

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: These pork rinds are delicious, but learning how to cook them in your microwave takes some practice. My first 2 bags were wasted, but I finally just dumped the bag on a paper plate and microwaved it and they turned out GREAT.  The bag has NOTHING to do with the cooking, so I actually just emptied all of my bags into one big ziplock bag so I can put how many I want on a plate and only cook a few at a time (cooks better that way)<br /><br />All that said, when these babies puff, they are delicious.

review/summary: Wonderful pork rinds. Microwave with care!
review/text: I first tried Lowrey's Bacon Curls when they were offered at a local club store. Since then, the only way to find them had been to order them streight from the manufacturer, until now. I'd had mixed results with the microwave process. I'd had many bags just burn without popping. Recently...just for fun, I thought I'd see what would happen if I tried lower wattage. It worked!! Now I use my 900 watt microwave vs the 1100 watt microvave I'd initially used.

If not, then Lowrey's needs to look into this and fix whatever has happened to a once great snack.

review/summary: BAD BATCH
review/text: This was my second purchase of this product. The first purchase was great, but this 2nd must have been a defective batch. Most packs did not cook correctly because they were not sealed tight and opened during cooking. That caused them to burn or not cook completely. I did not send them back because I kept thinking, maybe the next one will be better, but I was wrong. There are a few packs left, but I'm hesitant about microwaving them. I will probably purchase some again, but it will not be anytime soon.

review/text: I love these things.  I used to be able to get them at Wal Mart and a couple local grocery stores.  Now I have a hard time finding them--but they are available through Amazon.  I like all kinds of Pork Rinds--but most of the ones you buy in the store--already made--have a high fat content.  People on a low carb diet can eat any kind--but if you are watching your fat intake, these are an excellent alternative.  I always include them in my diet--they are not the most filling snack--however, a bag usually satisfies your craving for a salty snack.  I buy boxes of them at a time from Amazon so I never run out.

review/summary: I eat these too much
review/text: I'm kind of addicted to these.  I like both the Hot and Spicy and the Plain Lowrey's Bacon Curls Microwave Pork Rinds, but like the Hot and Spicy best.  I found the perfect time in my microwave of 1:20, but had to experiment to find the right amount of time.  Before taking them out of the plastic I shake them a little.  Once in a while they will fly out of the bag when I try to shake it when the bag is out of the plastic and opened flat like the directions show.  You really need to get them dispersed in the bag before popping if you want full big puffy pork rinds, which I think needs to be done more than 5-6 times like the directions state.  Some bags do seem fuller than others, however.  I have to agree these do stink when taken out of the microwave.  I turn my stove fan on before taking them out of the microwave and pour them out of the bag under the fan and hold the bag and bowl up to the fan for a few seconds.<br />I've tried dipping these into ranch dressing which is a bit of a treat too, but seems to make the porky too soggy, but I like the taste of it.

I bought 2 cases of them. My whole family is addicted to them. Did i mention I LOVE THESE THINGS. They go into my microwave for 1 minute and 20 seconds and you have hot fresh pork rinds. They are so much better than the pork rinds in the bag on the potato chip isle. 2 Thumbs Up

review/summary: Unbearably salty
review/text: For starters, I'm not salt or msg averse. I enjoy salty food like chips, jerky, and bacon. However, these pork rinds are ridiculously salty tasting. To give you a better idea of what I'm referring to, Kettle Chips Sea Salt variety have 55 mg of salt per 1/2 oz of chips. Lowrey's pork rinds have 310 mg of sodium per 1/2 oz serving. That's roughly six times the salt content of a food considered relatively salty by most people. I read a review on here saying that they were too salty and decided to order them anyway thinking the reviewer was some salt hating baby. Boy, was I mistaken. I wish I hadn't ordered these.

They're light and crispy if they're popped correctly, a little on the salty side because of the MSG seasoning (beware migraine sufferers). Not all of the bacon chips pop, and you can't eat the ones that don't because it's like plastic before they're nuked in the micro.  Now, I am stuck with the rest of the box.

review/text: THESE ARE VERY TASTY FOR A QUICK SNACK, BUT THEY ARE A LITTLE TRICKY TO MICROWAVE. EACH MICROWAVE OVEN COOKS DIFFERENTLY (SIZE AND POWER WATTAGE) IT TAKES A FEW PACKS TO COOK JUST RIGHT. VERY EASY TO OVERCOOK OR UNDER COOK AND THIS EFFECTS THE TASTE GREATLY. AFTER YOU LEARN THE EXACT SECONDS FOR YOUR MICROWAVE THE BETTER THE TASTE. IF YOU OVERCOOK THEM THEY HAVE A CHEMICAL LIKE TASTE...YOU MIGHT AS WELL THROW THEM AWAY! (IF NOT COOKED JUST RIGHT)... I LIKE TO WATCH THE BAG COOK FOR BETTER RESULTS. I TAKE THE BAG OUT AT THE POINT OF INFLATION, NO LATER OR THEY WILL BE OVER COOKED. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE LIKE NUKING POPCORN, BUT IT IS MORE DIFFICULT.<br /><br />+++UPDATE 1-04-10....WE GO THROUGH ABOUT 2-3 BOXES PER MONTH BECAUSE WE ARE ON A LOW CARB DIET.

review/summary: Tastes good, at least
review/text: For a microwavable chili, this stuff, and the firehouse variant, do taste good. However, I never get to eat the full container because it tends to explode in the microwave. I've followed the directions exactly on the label, as well as tried some tweaking, and nothing so far has prevented it from exploding.<br /><br />The problem is the plastic lid that is to be left on. It is left on because it is vented but covers the chili to keep it from splattering. Irony is there is not enough venting, the chili plugs the holes, and as it boils and water vapor expands, it basically becomes a messy bomb in your microwave.<br /><br />I wish I could say it was user error and that there is a way to enjoy this without the mess. So far the firehouse variant hasn't exploded on me, but it also has less meat and beans to it. Since the firehouse variant is not really all that spicy, I may just stick with that until Campbells can make this not a bomb.

Add some sour cream and eat it alongside rice for a more fuller meal.<br />I'd prefer a home cooked chili, but who has the time to shop/prepare it when working over 40hr/wk.

review/text: I love Chuckles, so the temptation to buy some in bulk overtook my better judgement recently. I don't know why, but I was surprised to discover that each HUGE ("Movie Size" box was mostly air and contained a small clear plastic wrapping with 8-10 pieces of candy in it. I AM old enough to have fallen for this. I ate them all quickly to quell my feelings of having been made an idiot out of yet again by air-filled boxed nothingness. Chuckles is a great and classic candy - But this packaging is quite deliberately deceptive and insulting. I would shop for other packages (at other sites) should the Chuckles-urge overtake me yet again.

review/text: I do not understand the bad review below. The Chuckles boxes come to 40 ounces. The Chuckles bars are 48 ounces at nearly twice the price. That's right. The boxes cost almost half as much.<br />The boxes are big and inside the Chuckles are in a plastic bag. Yes, they are not evenly distributed. Oh, well.

review/summary: Great  Treat
review/text: My brother and I were talking about candy that we enjoyed as children.  I bought the Chuckles Theater boxes as a gift for him. Moist, tasty and there's plenty to share. The quantity may be too much for some, but they always have a houseful of kids watching movies and eating snacks.  This is a great movie treat for all ages at a good value.

review/summary: Bigger box but NOT a good value!
review/text: Kind of  a ripoff.  I bought the theater box instead of the 5 piece candy bar version and that turned out to be a big mistake.  Each box has only 8 or 9 pieces and they are randomly filled so you are not guaranteed even 1 piece of each flavor.  One box had 6 green pieces and 3 black.  A better value is 20 pack of the original 5 piece bar.  This theater box is sold by weight (4oz) and not volume.  The box is about 90% empty- Ripoff!

review/summary: Best chili powder I ever tried!
review/text: I had a recipe that called for a lot of dark chili powder and the only place I could find it was amazon.com.  I bought a jar of this and it made two batches of the chili recipe I have.  The chili was the best I'd ever made.  I can vouch that this chili powder really does make a big difference in the flavor of a chili.  It is rich with a bit of a kick.  Everyone has been crazy for it, and I think its due to this chili powder. I'm back to buy the bag this time!

It does the trick--and the quality is great.<br />TastePadThai shipped my order very fast!  When I opened the box I was surprised to find that they had also included a complimentary assortment of fresh Thai herbs (kaffir lime leaves, lemon grass, thai peppers, and galangal).  How generous!  I will definitely shop with TastePadThai again.

review/text: Utz Honey Wheat Braided Pretzel Twists are a great snack to keep on hand for a little guilt-free munching. They have a wonderful, mild sweet and salty crunch. With 0g trans fat, no saturated fat and no cholesterol, you'll want to keep them on hand.<br /><br />I absolutely love the packaging. It's very convenient to put out when you have company over, keeps leftovers fresh (Leftovers? What leftovers?), and when you're all done, it's great for storing sewing supplies, little toys, or even a jar to save change for a rainy day!

So, if you are looking for an alternative to orange juice and can tolerate the calories, you might want to give this drink a try.

review/text: I ordered this bouquet for valentine's day and was happy to see how great this arrangement looks once it blooms.  you should expect all the flowers to arrive unopened and they mostly bloomed in 2-3 days.  I received 14 stargazer lilies and 19 irises.  the glass vase was simple but functional and attractive.  2 packets of plant nutrients were included and i expect the flowers will last at least a week (5 days so far).  all i did was cut the flowers under running water and plop them in the vase with 1 packet of food.  you could arrange them yourself for slightly better results.

review/summary: I am sad
review/text: I was very disapointed with these flowers. Several of the  stargazer buds were damaged, as if they had been frozen, and several others are such that they will not  open very well, although there is still time for them to improve perhaps. But, the number of flowers for the money was wholly inadequate. On the bright side, the Iris' are blooming nicely and are beautiful. Based on the condition of the stargazers, and the inadequate number of stems,however,  i do not think I will order from this company again

review/summary: A bit expensive, but you do get what you pay for
review/text: The stargazer lillies in this bouquet have an amazing scent that fills a room, which the recepient told me was "heavenly". They live quite long when cared for properly, but it's important to remember that these particular flowers ship in bud form -- on delivery day, they aren't like the picture on the page here, but will reach that point in 3 or 4 days' time. Take that into account and plan ahead.<br /><br />The reason to choose this one over the standard version is the extra stems of the stargazer lillies because, as I mentioned earlier, the scent they carry is fantastic (the more the merrier!).

review/summary: Budding flowers arrived on time
review/text: I pre-ordered this product from ProFlowers through Amazon two weeks ahead of Mother's Day and was quite happy when it showed up today on the scheduled date. It was delivered by FedEx. The flowers were slightly wilted from being out of water for the 12-24 hours they were in transit but they perked right up after being put in water.  Included in this package was a nice vase and 2 packets of plant food.<br /><br />Keep in mind these are mostly buds and will take a day or two to fully open so you might want to have them delivered slightly in advance like I did.<br /><br />The only possible negative I can think of is the fact I was not provided a tracking number by email to track the package, but it did arrive on time and in good condition.

Their web site is really geared for pure beef products with no explanations for products of multiple origins.  I know my sister has multiple GI problems but she can eat one of these every once in a while without a stomach upset.  She does complain of the salt content though.  If you don't care how these hotdogs are made then I highly recommend them for great flavor.

review/summary: Not for me
review/text: Wow! This really hurts me to do this, but I have to give this syrup the lowest review it has gotten yet. This was my first time ordering  Hidden Springs Vermont Maple Syrup, and I did so because the other brands weren't available in the 1 Half Gallon variety. I wanted to go with 1 Half Gallon this time because I go through the 32 oz. containers too quick and the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup also saved me money by buying it in bulk. Now to the bad part, I usually purchase either the Coombs Family Farms or Highland Sugarworks brands of maple syrup and I love their taste; it was a bitter disappointment when I first tasted the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup and realized I'd made a huge mistake.<br /><br />I do not cook with these syrups, I use them for one thing and one thing only -- pancakes, waffles, or French-Toast. The aforementioned brands I usually purchase are awesome on my breakfast products, but the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup had a very funny off-putting taste that made it impossible to enjoy my breakfast. Don't get me wrong, it isn't nasty, but in comparison to Coombs or Highlands it is terrible.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I feel like I wasted $36 on maple syrup, as I now have about 60 oz. of Hidden Springs Maple Syrup that I won't eat. Perhaps it'll make a good cooking syrup and I can find some good recipes calling for maple syrup. But in summation, if you're going to spend this much money on maple syrup, buy Coombs or Highlands, there's a reason they are the top purchased syrups on Amazon.

review/text: Living on Guam can at times leave much to be desired. We were sitting here talking about when we visited our family in Wisconsin and had some home made ice cream at an Amish farm. I remembered how good it tasted and I remembered I had some Maple syrup ice cream while there, sooooo. I got on line and found this 1/2 gallon, price wasn't bad  (here at a local store a pint of REAL Maple syrup will cost $12.00) and it had free shipping. I had it in a few days, and made the ice cream right away. By the way I also made pancakes and sausage for dinner, and this here Maple syrup was as good if not better than what I had 8 years ago. VERY well packaged, and really fast shipping. Nice bouqet, great light amber color, great job to the cooker. Oh yea, by the way, the ice cream came out wonderfully.
