review/summary: Tough call
review/text: I'm pretty much of the mind that if the water is clean than it will be doing its job as far as providing hydration & sustenance to the body. That being said I find myself pretty much unmoved by Essentia's claim for a 9.5PH factor, electrolyte infused & great taste.<br /><br />Quite frankly it tastes like filtered water. Unoffensive & yes, thirst quenching. I suppose the real bone to pick here would be the price. A case of this = twelve 1.5L bottles runs between $22.00 to $68.00 bucks. A case of 24, 20ox bottles runs for about $31.00 - meanwhile a case of Aquafina: 32/16.9oz bottles can go for as low as $4.95. And tastes pretty much the same.<br /><br />So I suppose the real answer is not so much the water itself but how much you are willing to pay?

review/summary: The best water I've ever tasted!
review/text: If you love bottled water, and are looking for one that is the purest and cleanest tasting then look no further. Essentia drinking water is purified through micro-filtration, UV lighting and reverse osmosis which leaves it as one of the best PH balanced waters available 9.5. There are no No chlorine or fluoride and the water is only enhanced with pure minerals. This water is so clean you can taste it and I absolutely love it.

review/summary: It's Good Water, But...?
review/text: I popped open a 1.5 Liter bad boy after a six-mile run and felt refreshed, but it was very hot and I don't know that the refreshment was from anything more than recovering from severe thirst.  I drank the entire bottle in about 15 minutes.<br /><br />I take other pre-workout and post-workout supplements and many of them have potassium and electrolytes.  I noticed that a bottle of water from Wal-mart, bottled at a municipal plan, contains the same level of potassium as Essentia.  I down a couple of 16.9 ounce bottles of that water after running as well.<br /><br />So, I can't attest that this water will change your life.  I can't even attest that it's worth more than other waters.  pH balanced water sounds great, and there's really nothing from a taste level that's bad, certainly.  But did it impact my overall physical recovery after a run?  I don't think so.  I was less thirsty, of course, but my legs didn't spring into action any faster or anything like that.<br /><br />It's good water.  Given a choice of this water or another brand that was similarly priced, I'd reach for this one.  But I also didn't experience a compelling reason to switch from the cheaper Wal-mart water.

review/summary: Good tasting water with electrolytes.
review/text: This Essentia purified water is infused with electrolytes, which are ideal for an energy boost.  While a lot of athletes get their electrolytes from Gatorade, this water would be perfect if you don't care for the Gatorade sweetened flavors.  This water tasted great and has no lingering aftertaste.<br /><br />There are no calories, and the pH level is 9.5.  The water is bottled in the state of Washington.<br /><br />Unfortunately the one negative is that the price is high for bottled water.

review/summary: Pleasant tasting water
review/text: I conducted a blind taste test between 4 different waters:  tap water, tap water filtered through a Brita filter, a popular bottled water, and this product.  All of the waters were at room temperature. Not surprisingly, the tap water tasted the worst.  The bottled water was next, and I would say that this water tied with the Brita filter water for good taste.  The Essentia water tasted "softer" (similar to Evian), but with a better flavor. It has a little after-taste which I presume is related to the minerals.  I can't evaluate any health benefits because I've only tried the product for a few days, but I'll update this review if I notice anything.  Bottom line-- at home I'll still probably use Brita-filtered water because it's less expensive, but when buying water at the store or needing bottled water for any reason, this is an excellent choice and better-tasting than typical bottled water.

review/summary: Crisp, Smooth, Taste PLUS Electrolytes & Balanced pH
review/text: Essentia has a nice, clean taste with no hint of chemical residue.  I've only tried one bottle so far, so I can't speak to its long-term health benefits.<br /><br />I DO know that UV treated reverse-osmosis water is the "safest," although, as with distillation, the R-O process also depletes minerals.  Which is probably why Essentia has added electrolytes, a big plus.  My hubby has a health condition that demands he carefully monitor his electrolyte levels, so this water makes that just a little bit easier, with a good balance of magnesium, sodium, and potassium, without any of the added sugars of conventional sports drinks like Gatorade.<br /><br />If you take vitamin supplements like I do, it's especially important to use a chlorine-free water like this for mixing and simply taking your supplements.  Chlorine SERIOUSLY interferes with the efficacy of supplements; this is especially obvious with green drinks, which will actually lose some of their color (and TONS of their nutritional value).  A compelling argument for giving a little more thought to the water you drink...

review/summary: Good taste - haven't hit on the benefits yet
review/text: I haven't felt any difference using the Essentia water after a workout - honestly the pH doesn't seem to impact the post-workout thirst, but the benefits from the electrolytes are a nice addition. I'm not a big fan of sports drinks so this unflavored option is welcome. If there's anything I can say that I don't like, it'd be that the water feels "heavy". I generally drink a generic bottled spring water (the tap water is very hard and tastes off to me) and in comparison the Essentia felt almost thick on the tongue.<br /><br />For the green folks, the bottle itself is listed as BPA free (PET 1) but it is not biodegradable (but it will not leech into the soil either - it simply won't breakdown).<br /><br />The purification method the company lists on their website is microfiltration, UV sterilization and reverse osmosis. For those who aren't familiar with these processes, safe to say that it really will not matter where the original water source originates from if these processes are used. Both microfiltration and reverse osmosis will remove most of the large particles and the UV light will kill off the organisms. Using a spring water source would really be irrelevant at this point because you'd essentially be stripping everything out of the water, leaving nothing but simple H2O.<br /><br />All-in-all, the Essentia didn't taste bad, and the flavorless electrolyte source is a great option if you're not a sports drink fan. Also, the fact that it didn't taste "salty" like the Disani-type waters was a big plus for me.

review/summary: If I'm going to buy bottled water, I'll seek this one out.
review/text: I try not to buy a lot of bottled water.  It's expensive, and I don't like the extra plastic it creates even though I  always try to find a recycling bin for my empties.  However, there are those days where I forget my water bottle or want more to drink than I carried with me.  For those few days, I'd choose Essentia drinking water as often as I choose spring water even though Essentia comes from municipal sources.  Essentia's silky texture is very cool.  It reminds me of the lake and creek water we drink when out and about in rural Alaska (NOTE: you should NOT drink lake and creek water without verifying its safety).  I chose to try out Essentia since I was curious about the whole 9.5 pH thing.  I don't feel any difference in consuming this pH of water, but did find it nice to drink as water.<br /><br />In short, I can't say I'll be a regular consumer of Essentia since I'm not a regular consumer of bottled water.  But on the few days that I am, this is a choice I'd make.

review/summary: Good water, but could not confirm pH 9.5 benefits
review/text: Essentia has two major claims about this water: it has a smooth taste, and it also has health benefits due to 9.5 pH level. I can confirm that it does indeed taste good, but my research on pH 9.5 benefits were not conclusive.<br /><br />First of all, it really has high pH level. I have a test kit for my aquarium, and it confirmed that this water's pH is near asserted levels. But when I performed some research whether it really has benefits, I ended up with mixed results.<br /><br />Most majority of water sources (whether tap water, or special ones like Fiji) seems be alkaline (high pH level). And I know that natural water sources that are advertised to have health benefits are also in this area. But they are usually not that high (at least recommended levels are up to 8.5), and they contain beneficial minerals. Essentia lists only a few of them.<br /><br />Drinking such high pH would probably not upset your stomach (since our diets are highly acidic, this would only neutralize it). However I would not recommend it for any other use. For example coffee would not taste right. And it would probably kill your fish in the aquarium.<br /><br />Overall, this is much better than tap water, or regular bottled ones. While I cannot completely vouch for its chemical benefits, most of my research points in that direction. If the price is right (currently it seems to be higher than normal), I would recommend this.

I refrigerated it since I prefer to drink my water cold and then also pour it over ice.  What can I tell you?  I don't think it's my imagination when I tell you that it does taste smooth.

review/summary: Unflavored Gatorade?
review/text: The label said this water is 'smooth'.  Dont know about you but I've I've never had water that wasn't smooth.<br /><br />Kind of like tap water in that it really isnt as tasteless as spring water.  Essentia, according to the label contains potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, as well as spring water.  The label says it's best available ph at 9.5.  (Not a clue what that means.)<br /><br />The label also says it hydrates better.  I'm thinking this may be true as my thirst was quenched with less of Essentia than of regular tap or spring water so I drank less.  Not sure if this is a good thing or not.  Also, I did not have to run to the bathroom in a half hour.  This could be coincidence of course.<br /><br />I have to admit I did feel a bit more energized by Essentia.  Not sure if this was my imagination or just another coincidence.<br /><br />All in all I found Essentia to be a good experience.  I would buy more.<br /><br />Thank you.<br />MEF

In its defense, not only is this water good for rehydration after exercise, but for the times when one is sick and requiring an infusion of electrolytes, I would choose this product over another "sports" drink in a heartbeat.  Will keep a bottle on hand for emergencies, but at the current high cost, I will not purchase for daily consumption.

review/summary: Re-hydrates Quickly!
review/text: The Essentia 9.5 ph drinking water taste similar to Aquafina or Dasani water and those brands I don't like, but this water was a little better tasting than those other brands. I wanted to give this water a chance and not compare it to those brands so, I drank it and monitored myself to see if there were any added benefits but there wasn't.<br /><br />The added electrolytes came in handy when I was on the treadmill and it seemed to re-hydrate me almost immediately without any extra calories that I would usually take in if I drank a sports drink. The water was smooth but I didn't really care for the taste. The water didn't give me any other benefits other than quickly re-hydrating my body and that's a good thing for me. I would drink this rather than sports drinks, but other than that I don't know if it is doing my body any good.

review/summary: Tastes good but quite expensive
review/text: I tested this water against my regular tap water and Whole Foods spring water - it does have a smooth and almost silky quality and a pleasant taste. We blind tested all three and could reliably identify each of them (just checking it wasn't my imagination!). I only received one sample bottle so I can't comment on its claim to 'hydrate better' or any of the supposed health effects, though some other reviewers have noted long-term benefits.<br /><br />I like the oversized bottle - if you're trying to drink more water each day, it's ideal for taking to work to measure how much you're actually drinking. It's a good product though the biggest downside is the cost compared with other bottled waters or home-installed filtration systems.

review/summary: About the same as normal filtered water.
review/text: There are wide selections of bottled drinking waters available.  This current trend of high pH water claims many "healthful benefits including being a natural antioxidant, flushes out toxins and neutralizes acidity in the body, more hydrating than conventional water, etc." from online health and nutrition websites.  Let's give this Essentia 9.5 pH drinking water a try.<br /><br />Likes:<br />>Decent taste; similar to my home water filter system with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YOQ0C2">Watts Premier 531105 RO-Pure Annual Filter Pack</a> that also uses reverse osmosis purification.<br />>I drank the sample 1.5 liter bottle for two evenings during my after-work workouts and didn't notice any improvements in performance but it did quench my thirst very well and seemed to have shortened recovery time with less sore muscles (perhaps from some lactic acid buffering properties AFTER the workouts).<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />>I appreciate this sample but the cost of Approx. $5 for each 1.5 liter bottle is very high.  My Ro-Pure system filters the same amount of water for far less.<br />>Healthful benefits are only claims and not proven through scientific studies with proper clinical research methodologies.  It's difficult to draw conclusions by just drinking 1.5 liters.<br />>Possible long term effects of high pH drinking water with ingredients of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, and calcium chloride (salts/electrolytes).<br /><br />Overall:<br />Overpriced "trendy" drinking water that tastes about the same as home reverse osmosis filtered water.  Claims of high pH water health benefits questionable.  Works OK as regular drinking water but doesn't improve performance during workouts.

review/summary: Like the Idea...Not Sold on the Product
review/text: Tastes good, smooth...I thought (husband thought it tasted salty and chalky compared with our reverse osmosis system).  I like the idea of the alkalinized pH and electrolytes...but I'm not willing to spend the amount asked for this product.  For pennies on the dollar I can mix an electrolyte formula at home, add some gatorade powder, or eat a salted banana or some prunes to restore electrolytes.  I also am certain that the pH will make no difference long term if one's diet is not also addressed (in which case this water is no longer needed).  There is a lot of information available online about the acidity of foods and the types of symptoms one can expect if they have trouble with pH...and what to do about it.  I'd rather spend my money on the right food than on expensive bottled water that is likely no better than what I already have under my kitchen sink.  I did like the 1.5L bottle, I liked the water...I just am not convinced it is worth the price or the convenience.

Unlike many bottled waters or sports drinks, I did not find a metallic aftertaste and I did not detect an odor. I was a bit concerned with the price--though the Amazon price of almost 30 bucks for a 12 pack of 1.5 liter bottles seems a bit more reasonable than some of the other prices out there. Still, this is reservoir water--as other reviewers note. While the water was refreshing enough and kept me hydrated, if I'm going to pay this much for water, I would prefer something a bit more natural.

review/summary: Clean taste
review/text: First off, I normally don't buy bottled water, so I'm not an expert on the taste of bottled water.  I do, however, buy a lot of sports drinks for drinking while cycling and working out.  I wasn't sure how to review plain ol' water, but I decided just to compare it with the water I get out of my faucet.  The Essentia does indeed have a better taste to it.  By comparison, my tap water has a slightly bitter taste (I'm guessing from chlorine or other chemicals added to purify it).  Essentia's water really has no taste, which is actually a good thing.  I'm not sure of the benefits its pH balance has for your body.  The addition of electrolytes does mean this product can do more for you than plain tap water if you're working out and losing a lot of water through sweat.  If you won't miss the sugary taste of a sports drink, this is a good zero-calorie alternative.

review/text: I have tasted a lot of different types of bottled waters, and most are little more than once or twice purified city water, and the taste shows, they don't taste good at all, some even have a plastic-like taste...  Thankfully, that is not the case with this water, in regards to taste.<br /><br />  The bottle doesn't really say how many times it has been purified, and what process it uses to purify the water, but it does state it is Alkalized, which is supposed to be very good for your body.  I have a local Asian restaurant where all of their water (they do this themselves, they have a purifier and what-not) is purified through reverse osmosis and is then Alkalized, which they say, has been known to cure illnesses in countries like Japan for a very long time.  Water processed that way does have a pretty good taste.<br /><br />  I would have to say, although this water may seen expensive, it really isn't, the bottles are a little smaller then two liters, so they last a while, as well as the way it is processed as well.  Since the bottles are so large, this is more of a water you would drink around the house rather than take on the go with you, unless, say it was at work or in your car.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy

review/summary: HEY GUESS WHAT? IT TASTES LIKE .....  BOTTLED PURIFIED WATER!
review/text: It was okay, not the type one would expect; but a bottle of purified tap water, for I had provided even a sample of this water to the local Department of Agricultural Division to be tested for clarity and only to find out the report was this:<br />It was filtered tap water with some chemicals added to it, pretty much what one could get from your own water system here except since we no longer provide flouride any longer so there were no differences but as far as the PH Balance, it was lower than it should be. (End of Report)<br />Personally, I have had many bottled waters, but this one falls to a rating of a 2.5 stars, I prefer Spring Water and was hoping that this would be a much better bottled water than I hoped it would be being the Touring Cyclist that I am.

review/summary: Tasted great to me
review/text: I must admit, although it is bad for the environment due to the plastic bottles, I regularly consume bottled water.  I have tried many versions, and while one would think that water is water, they really do taste differently.<br /><br />In terms of taste, I thought this water tasted good.  I chose to chill mine before drinking it, and found it to be very refreshing, without any chemical or metallic taste that I was able to detect.  It tasted, in short, like water.  I did not think the change in pH made it taste any differently, so that is a real positive for me.<br /><br />While I cannot speak to the accuracy of the claims of the benefits to this particular formula of water, I can say that if the water does indeed contain the additional electrolytes, this provides a good alternative to sugary high calorie sports drinks.<br /><br />Many reviewer commented that this is merely treated water from municipalities, as opposed to spring water, and therefore not worth the cost.  If this were the sole source of my water intake, I would agree.  I would not purchase this for the whole of my drinking and cooking water.  But when looking for a bottle of water to take on a trip or throw in a backpack, or a source of electrolytes after athletic activity (or illness) I think this would fit the bit quite nicely.

review/text: I have to be honest. I'm not entirely sure how water's PH impacts the body. I haven't really heard very much information on the subject. The Essentia Drinking water tasted good - it has a nice smooth taste and I like that it has added electrolytes. I'm a long-distance runner and so I drank some of this water following a workout. I can't say that I noticed a huge difference between the water that I usually drink and this one, but it wasn't bad. Good taste and the electrolytes (and zero calories) made this a good post-workout drink.

review/text: You know how when you drink gatorade, you've never really quenched your thirst?  Do you know what I mean?  When I drink gatorade, or anything else with electrolytes in it, my tongue always feels kinda dry afterwards.  Like I should have just had plain water instead.<br />This stuff tastes fine.  I don't think it tasted "silky smooth" like the bottle said, but it was fine - tasted like water.  (You want "silky smooth" water?  Try Fiji water!  It rocks!).<br />I didn't get anything out of this.  I didn't feel any different or notice any tangible difference.<br />I mean, if you're big into getting electrolytes but don't want to drink gatorade or any of those other goofy products, then this is for you.  Me, I'm sticking with Poland Springs, or Fiji when I can get it!

review/summary: Great Tasting Water
review/text: I am very picky about my water. I moved to Florida at the age of 15 and I quickly realized that I could not drink the tap water. I can actually taste the difference at restaurants when they serve tap water versus purified or bottled water. Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water is the best water I have ever tasted. It tastes completely clear and delicious.<br /><br />I only received a 1.5 liter bottle, so I did not notice any of the medical benefits of the 9.5pH water. I do have GERD, but didn't notice a difference with drinking the 1.5 liters of water over 2 days. The price is a little steep on this water, but I would consider buying more for the taste and to see if it really helps my GERD.

review/summary: Nothing Special
review/text: I have to say from the beginning that I was a bit skeptical about the claims on the bottle of this product, the primary one being that it is "Doctor recommended to protect, improve and enhance the quality of your health." There is no information as to what kind of doctor is making the claim or as to what the specific recommendation is for. I have to wonder if, in fact, the claim, is simply in reference to the fact that most doctors recommend water over any other hydration source.<br /><br />The label also claims proprietary technology in the bottling of this water. However, that technology is described as reverse osmosis, which is pretty standard in the water bottling industry (it's what keeps most bottled waters from being nothing more than tap water). The claim this water makes that is missing from other bottled waters is that it is "infused with electrolytes" and "alkalinized and restructured using ionic Separation Technology." Now, it's been a long time since I've had a science class, but the fact that the ingredient list includes "purified water, sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate and calcium chloride" lead me to believe that this is nothing more than water that has been basically filtered and had some salt added to it to keep it soft.<br /><br />That being said, the taste of the water was just fine. It didn't have the chemically taste of tap water, but it wasn't as crisp as other bottled waters I've had (I'll take Aquafina or Arrowhead any day). I tried the water both chilled (as I prefer it) and at room temperature. Even chilled, it missed the crispness that I like in my water. It may simply be that I was expecting more considering the claims on the bottle; it may just as well be that it was over alkalinized. In either case, the taste neither bothered nor pleased me.<br /><br />As far as the size of the bottle itself, I'd say it's quite generous. At the current price of 28.25 for a dozen 1.5 liter bottles, it's a good value in comparison to other comparably sized bottles of water on the market. This makes it convenient for the mini-fridge at work, but much, much too large for the cup holder in the car where I'm more likely to want to grab a bottle of water for when I'm on the go.

review/summary: Water taste, sturdy bottle
review/text: This Essential bottled water comes in a 1.5 Liter (50.7 fluid ounces) recyclable bottle, which roughly translates to about six servings of water (8oz servings). Zero calories. The bottle promotes a silky smooth taste, better hydration, electrolytes infused and pH of 9.5 which is on the alkaline side of things.<br /><br />On the first claim, I liked the taste, it tasted slightly different than the water I usually drink, but no big difference. To me, the Essentia water tasted better cold/iced than room temperature, it has a nice crispness (for lack of a better word) to it. I drank this at different times and different days, before and after and in-between meals, so as to get a more rounded and averaged out taste. I did not taste any plasticiness.<br /><br />On the other three claims, without having access to a research lab, scientists, and hundreds of test subjects, I am afraid it is above and beyond a customer review to answer those claims. On the plus side, nothing bad happened to me after I drank this water :)<br /><br />The bottle appears to be a sturdy one, it arrived undaunted and undamaged. I don't know if it is reusable, but it is definitely recyclable.

review/text: This isn't bad water; but it's not great, either.  I don't like to be able to taste my water much, and this has just too much of a mineral taste for my preference.  If there was nothing else around, I could certainly drink it, but I would never go out of my way to buy it, especially at this price.<br /><br />But everyone has their own preference for water.  To give you an idea of mine, I am okay with most bottled waters, but I HATE Nestle Pure Life.  If you like Nestle, you probably like a more flavorful water, and you might enjoy this Essentia.<br /><br />Also, as far as I know, the alkaline pH of this water is a little unusual.  If you have a problem with stomach acidity or GERD, it might be worth trying to see if it helps.

review/summary: Now This IS Water
review/text: Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water is the kind of water I've always heard about, a tasteless beverage. Even when I was a little girl and heard someone say water has no taste I would think, "Yes, it does."<br /><br />I use a Brita Filter system which is fine for making coffee and tea as well as for cooking. But, it does get annoying spending a chunk of my time everyday filling the pitcher so I'm drinking and using water that smells and tastes like it was scooped from a swimming pool with a spritz of this chemical and a splash of that other one. So keeping some bottles of Essentia 9.5 pH in my refrigerator has it ready to go when all I want to drink is a nice, cold glass of water that refreshes without images of the pool at the gym flashing in my mind.<br /><br />Essentia 9.5 pH gives me exactly what I want. A glass of water that leaves me feeling refreshed and hydrated with no aftertaste.

Some people have talked about different aftertastes or flavors but to me it tastes the same as other bottled waters, even when drunk back to back. If this is healthier than just drinking water it's a great option - no calories, no added ingredients to give flavor, etc. Basically just water with hidden health benefits.

review/summary: Alkaline Water - Yes it is
review/text: A blind taste test was conducted among three members of the family ranging from 8 to 49 years of age. We used Poland Spring bottled water and Essentia 9.5 ph water, both cooled to identical temperatures. No family member was able to tell the difference in taste. Comments ranged from, "It's water, right?" to "Did you put the same thing in both glasses?" So...it looks and tastes like water.<br /><br />We next tested the pH using materials drawn from a 40 year old Gilbert Chemistry set. Remarkably, the Essentia water was, in fact, between pH 9 and 10, quite a bit more alkaline than the Poland Spring or tap water, both of which proved to be neutral in pH. A phenolpthalein solution turned pink when mixed with Essentia water but remained clear with both the Poland Spring and tap water.<br /><br />A MedLine search did not reveal any evidence for studies that have definitively identified health benefits of alkaline water. One study indicated that patients with metabolic acidosis due to renal failure may benefit from alkaline water, but human studies are still necessary to demonstrate any real value.<br /><br />Some individuals may enjoy using this water to mix with concentrated orange juice for a low-acid product. Drinking it alongside a high-acid meal such as a meal containing tomato sauce may reduce heartburn/reflux. Your mileage may vary. Otherwise, I'd be concerned about the potential negative impact of drinking large quantities of alkaline pH water without neutralizing it in advance. I don't see that any long term studies have been conducted to demonstrate safety of high volume intake of alkaline water.<br /><br />But for occasional use, this tastes just like any other bottled water.

review/summary: Good pH Water, So So Taste
review/text: I don't know that there is anything about Essentia's taste that will wow you.  It is high pH, as in its alkaline water, and it is purified.  On the other hand its municipal tap water, apparently from a variety of municipalities.<br />So, while it is probably good for you, as far as its pH and electrolytes, taste wise it is just OK.  It doesn't have that "clean" taste familiar to those who drink spring waters.  Instead it tastes like what it is, tap water.<br /><br />You may indeed notice a "silky" taste - it has sodium bicarbonate in it.  That's baking soda to you and me.<br />I am not sure exactly why the sodium bicarbonate is in it, since Essentia advertises that they use electrolysis to split the water into negative (alkaline) and positive (acidic) ions.  It may be that the sodium bicarbonate is meant to support the stabilized pH or aid the electrolytes.<br /><br />Either way, if I want baking soda in my water, I'll add it myself.<br /><br />IThe bottle size is nice, about the equivalent of three "individual size" (16.7 ounce) water bottles.  So this is something you can drink over a few hours, or during physical activity to replenish lost fluids.  At the same time, the bottle is not so large as to make it a problem to bring with you.<br /><br />If you are looking for alkaline water, this might be a good purchase for you.  If you are buying water purely for superior taste, this isn't anything special.<br /><br />Overall, it is what it is advertised to be.  I am a little put off by the baking soda content, but other than that, it's OK.

review/summary: HIgh pH (alkaline) Water has bland taste
review/text: Water is normally neutral pH. Distilled water is 7, making it neither an acid (low pH) or a base (high pH). For a few years high pH water has been touted as improving performance and being better than neutral pH water. The highest pH of these waters is 9.5, just like Essentia.<br /><br />I can't say that this water improved anything, but I can say I wasn't impressed. The label said nothing about it being alkaline water just proclaimed the pH. This sent me running to the Internet to find out more about that measurement and what it meant. It would have been nice to have had a little more information on the label.<br /><br />You might think that with a bottle of water you would have a short list of ingredients. Pretty much I'd like to see a list of one: water. But not so with Essentia. After filtering their water by reverse osmosis, essentially the process a Brita filter uses, they up the pH, I assume, by adding a bunch of bases.<br /><br />But unlike mineral waters and many other bottled waters, they do not include a mineral analysis, so you don't know what's in there. All you know is that they have been added.<br /><br />The label didn't make me happy because I felt as if they were being stingy with information. While by buying in bulk on Amazon, I might be able to see more information, I can't see it in the store.<br /><br />But what about the taste?<br /><br />As you would expect from something with a high pH, the taste was flat and dull. I trued it cold & at room temperature, with & without ice. The taste actually improved when my tap water ice melted.<br /><br />Unless you want or like alkaline water, don't bother.

review/summary: Great for those on an Alkalinian Diet
review/text: I used to think that all water tasted the same. As in it was all tasteless. Then I went through a pregnancy where I had a very highly sensitive sense of taste and the taste of tap water made me sick. It was embarrassing and I felt stupid lugging bottled water everywhere but only room temperature bottled water was tolerable. I wish I'd known about Essentia at the time because it is the only bottled water I ever tried that I literally could not taste. It's absolutely weird.<br /><br />I first discovered Essentia through my extended family (mom, grandmother, and aunts) who were all trying to improve their health through the Alkaline 'diet'. They tried to convert me to it but talk about an expensive lifestyle change. It wasn't for me but the only water they'd drink was Essentia which got complicated when I had them all for a visit and had to go to a specialty store for it. Having now given it a try I can see why they preferred it but unless I were going to go Alkaline (or experience another pregnancy with the crazy highly sensitive tastebuds) I don't think I would be that concerned with choosing Essentia over another, less costly, bottled water option.

I understand that the main focus of this water is the effects of alkaline pH on performance and wellness, but I would need to drink this product over a longer period of time to evaluate any personal differences I might experience.<br /><br />Health benefits are so individualized that basically one has to try a product for themselves to evaluate the outcome. The product is priced right. Unfortunately, the mouth feel and strange aftertaste will prevent me from doing that.

review/text: First of all, I hate buying bottled water because I feel like it's such a rip off when I can take a good hydroflask water bottle, fill it with tap water and ice cubes, and have long-lasting cold water. However, I have to be honest and say that I loved the smooth taste of this water. I can't really speak to the "healthiness" of it, but on pure taste alone, I would buy this water for a refreshing drink. The normal metalic or plastic taste of bottled water is not present here (at least I couldn't perceive it) and the water is so smooth! This is stating the obvious, but it tastes better cool or cold and when it's at that temperature, I could not detect any aftertaste. I would buy Essentia at my local convenience store if they carried it!

review/summary: Clean tasting water, convenient bottle size
review/text: I found this to be a great tasting water. It's crisp, clean and has a smooth, refreshing taste to it. I didn't taste saltiness or any noticeable flavor. The larger 1.5 liter bottle is convenient for bringing to the gym to keep hydrated during a workout or for a long day at work. I can't say I could tell if the 9.5 pH or electrolytes made a difference or not, but I did like the taste better than the average bottle of water. I had to take a star off because although it's a good water, the price is a little on the high side for me.

review/summary: Delicious, soft water that seems to work well as an unsweetened Gatoraid substitute
review/text: When I tasted the Essentia water, I thought it had a smooth, soft taste. Not a crisp water; more earthy and gentle. It is very easy to drink, and tasty.<br /><br />I didn't just want to taste it and review it, though. I put it through its paces. The first thing I did was pick a hot, muggy summer day to test the electrolytes. I spent some time at the beach, in the sun, walking around. While I always love spending time at the beach, I usually get a headache from a combination of sunglare, heat, wind and inadequate hydration. Even if i bring plain water, I tend to get low enough in electrolytes by the end of the day that a minor headache comes on.<br /><br />I kept the Essentia by my side, drank most of the 1.5 liter container, and got through the day and evening comfortably. That is a real plus in my book, since I don't like sweet drinks like Gatoraid or energy sodas. This was a super easy way to drink water and keep my electrolytes up.<br /><br />With the rest of my Essentia, I decided to gather as many waters as I could and do a larger scale taste test. In front of me I have: Essentia, Function (with electrolytes, from CVS), Kirkland (from CostCo), Crystal Geyser (bottled in the Sierras), R/O water from my parent's filtration system, and plain Southern CA tap water.<br /><br />These are all flat waters, not sparkling. They are all at room temperature. The first two are electrolyte waters, and Kirkland's water has added minerals (for taste, the bottle says). And really, those three taste the absolute best. More on those in a minute.<br /><br />The Crystal Geyser water has the least amount of "taste" than the other three bottled waters. It is a little...flat? Boring? Staid? This isn't like wine tasting, so I am searching around for the words to describe the different tastes of water. This one just tastes like nothing more than "wet".  Arrowhead, which I often drink at home, has this same unexciting non-taste. Not bad, not exceptional.<br /><br />The reverse osmosis filtered water is tastier. It is a step above those forementioned  "mountain stream" advertised waters. It is softer and rounder and more enjoyable in the mouth.<br /><br />The tap water is...ok, blech. Don't drink the tap water in So Cal unless you have to. My parents don't even use it in their coffee.<br /><br />Back to the top three waters, Essentia, Function and Kirkland all have added items. The added "minerals", in all three cases, are sodium and/or phosphate bicarbonates. Baking soda, mainly. Also magnesium and calcium source minerals. This is interesting, since Kirkland is not advertising their water as an electrolyte replacement fluid. My guess is that Kirland may not have as much electrolyte particulates by volume? Or it could be the same darn thing in each. If anyone wants to call these compankes and find out, I'd love to know.<br /><br />Which of these three top waters tastes the best? Essentia, to my palate. It is almost creamy, very soft, very delicious. I would absolutely switch over to this brand if the price was right. However, if the Kirkland product was much cheaper, I'd stick to that one. It is still delicious. The Function brand is a little less round, somehow. Less zesty, as far as unflavored water can get. :-)<br /><br />I do recommend trying the Essentia, at least to see if you can taste a difference, since I don't think most of us get enough electrolytes in a day. Getting more can only be a good thing, and its easier than messing around with adding baking soda on your own.

review/summary: Tastes fresh, has electrolytes
review/text: If I ever had a choice of bottled 'plain water' I suspect Essentia's would be the number one or close to that. Essentia's is simply 'good water'. It tastes good, the way good water is expected to taste with no aftertaste, it has no odors and it's crystal clear. This being said, I can't see myself paying more for 'water' than I would for the same amount of premium gasoline for as long as I can get 'almost as good' out of my well for 99% less even when I factor in the cost of the filters.<br /><br />Price aside, consider me impressed. Besides purified water, the ingredients list includes: sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulphate and calcium chloride. And, of course, it's got electrolytes.

review/summary: An okay filtered municipal tap water with slight "chalky" aftertaste, but the misleading health claims and hype are quackery!
review/text: Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:<br />*** Somewhat recommended, with reservations and only lukewarm fuzzies.<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />+ Not too expensive compared to other bottled water, although it is not cheap either.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />- This bottled water product's labeling, product descriptions, and health claims are misleading.<br /><br />At first glance, this 1.5-liter bottle of water that I am reviewing looks like another one of the many varieties of bottled water on the market.  There are many kinds of bottled water: "spring water" produced from an underground formation where the groundwater naturally flows up to the Earth's surface, "artesian water" obtained from a well that taps into an underground aquifer, "mineral water" produced from a well or spring that naturally contains trace amounts of minerals that some people consider to provide health benefits, "ground/well water" produced from a well that tapes into an aquifer, "sparkling water" from a spring or well that is naturally carbonated, and "purified water" produced by distillation, deionization, reverse osmosis, or other purification processes.  This Essentia Drinking Water is "purified water"; this bottle contains municipal water (i.e. tap water that comes from your faucet) that is purified using reverse osmosis and ultraviolet light for disinfection.<br /><br />The label on this Essentia water bottle is filled with marketing hype and technical terms designed to make it sound exotic:<br />* "Infused with Electrolytes For A Difference You Can Taste"<br />* "Silky Smooth Taste"<br />* "Hydrates Better"<br />* "Electrolytes Infused"<br />* "Best Available pH at 9.5"<br />* "Doctor recommended to protect, improve, and enhance the quality of your health."<br />* "Our Proprietary Technology: Water purified by reverse osmosis; infused with electrolytes for taste; alkalinized and restructured using Ionic Separation Technology."<br />* "Ingredients: purified water, sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, calcium chloride."<br /><br />There are two ways to evaluate this water product.  One way to review this water is based on how it tastes, how safe are its added ingredients, and its cost.  Since Essentia includes a variety of health claims and marketing statements on the water bottle's label, on the Amazon product listing, and on the company's Web site, the veracity of this statements must also be scrutinized since the marketing hype of most other brands of bottled water is just limited to the "freshness" or "purity" of their taste without making other health-related claims.<br /><br />First, on the basis on its cost, with all of its marketing hype and hoopla, at least this water is not priced far more expensive than most other brands of bottled water.  But there are various other bottled water products on Amazon that cost less on a per-liter basis.  And if you think that this slightly pricey water can be justified based on its health "merits", keep reading...<br /><br />As for taste, that can be a highly personal preference, but I like my water to simply taste "wet".  :-)  If I want some kind of flavored drink - tea, wine, beer, fruit juice, etc. - I will drink that instead.  But nothing hydrates and quenches as easily as pure and simple water, with no additives or flavorings added to it.  This particular Essentia water does have a smooth texture to it.  Most other bottled waters taste more crisp than this Essentia water.  Again, you may either like the smooth texture of this water or you may think that its texture is rather flat and bland.  Unlike drinking "distilled water", or bottled water that was purified using distillation with no additives, this water has a very slight subtle aftertaste that might be considered as either "chalky" or "metallic".  Those are my highly subjective adjectives that I associate with this water.  I can only surmise that this is due to the small amounts of additives that were used in this water.  This aftertaste is not too objectionable, but if I just want to hydrate myself drinking "water", I really prefer my water to be without any identifiable taste, texture, or odor.<br /><br />Next, since this is not just a bottle of pure H2O water, let's consider what was added to this water: sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, and calcium chloride.  Sodium bicarbonate is the same thing as baking soda.  This water was made to have a slightly alkaline pH of 9.5 by adding sodium bicarbonate.  People sometimes also adjust and raise the pH of their swimming pool water by adding sodium bicarbonate.  Dipotassium phosphate is sometimes added to various food products as a buffering agent or emulsifier.  In this water, it serves as one of the "electrolytes" that is added.  The term "electrolytes" is just a subset of minerals that are found in both the Earth and the food that we eat.  Also serving as an electrolyte is the addition of magnesium sulfate.  Magnesium sulfate is sold in drug stores as "Epsom Salt", and you can either soak your feet or body in an Epsom Salt bath to soothe sore muscles, or when ingested in larger quantities, magnesium sulfate also can serve as a laxative.  Calcium chloride serves as another electrolyte in this water.  Calcium chloride is sometimes used as a food additive.  The trace amounts of calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus in this water do not qualify as a measurable part of your daily nutritional intake of these minerals, regardless of how much of this water you drink each day.<br /><br />Essentia is definitely not the first bottled water manufacturer to add electrolytes to either bottled water or drinks.  During the 1960s, Gatorade was possibly the first large-scale commercial drink that was produced with the goal of adding electrolytes of sodium, sugar, potassium, and phosphate to hydrate and replenish athletes who lost fluids during physical exertion in hot weather.  On Essentia's Web site, they have an FAQ question/answer of: "Why should I drink Essentia if I get my electrolytes through sports drinks?  Essentia provides a blend of dissolved minerals that emulate the ratio of the body's own mixture and concentration - providing the correct proportion of electrolytes without all the sugars and other additives you typically find in sports and energy drinks."  There are several problems with that statement.  First, if you are actively exercising and sweating, your body can actually use those extra calories, and if you are just sitting in front of the computer or television, guzzling Gatorade just adds useless calories and electrolytes.  Second, if you are drinking Essentia at home, this product's claim that it provides "the correct proportion of electrolytes" implies a one-size-fits-all balance of electrolytes, which is simply not true as we all have different bodies, diets, and lifestyles.<br /><br />None of what Essentia refers to as "Our Proprietary Technology" is really that "proprietary" or exotic.  The reverse osmosis purification of municipal tap water is commonly used to produce bottled water, and the addition of various electrolytes or minerals to water has been practiced by other bottled water manufacturers for many decades now.  Some people think that drinking plain distilled water tastes boring and, mentally at least, they like the idea that drinking water that is naturally infused with minerals from a spring or well/aquifer adds an extra measure of health benefits.  The addition of trace minerals do add noticeable flavor that mimics natural spring water.  Also, slightly flavoring the water with minerals masks the residual odors that can be left by the plastic water bottle; the plastic odor is still there, but you notice it less.  The same principle applies to using a room deodorizer to mask the existing odors in a house; that old cat urine smell is still present inside the house, but you notice it less and therefore the house smells fresher.  The most common electrolytes/minerals in spring water are calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, sulfate, and chloride.  The Coca-Cola company markets a "Dasani" bottled water that, like this Essentia, is municipal tap water purified via reverse osmosis.  Dasani has magnesium sulfate and potassium chloride added to it.  Perhaps the Dasani taste testing panels decided that their water tastes better without the addition of calcium?  But for whatever reasons, this Essentia water has a slight residual "chalky" or "metallic" aftertaste, as if it had a tannic undertone like the aftertaste after drinking a dry red wine, that I do not really care for.  I do not want my drinking water to leave a subtle aftertaste in my mouth.<br /><br />Essentia also competes directly with "Glaceau Smart Water", which takes an approach similar to Essentia's water.  Glaceau Smart Water is municipal water purified via distillation, and then infused with the similar ingredients of calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, and potassium bicarbonate.<br /><br />Not to be outdone, another of Essentia's alkaline/electrolyte water competitors, named "NEO Water" (to ride on the futuristic coattails of "The Matrix" fame??), pumps out even more junk science drivel filled with fear-mongering misleading statements, calling itself "Alkaline, Electrolyte, Antioxidant Super Hydrator ... ultra purified healthy and refreshing water formulated through proprietary technology to balance, revitalize and propel you unlike any traditional water", and "NEO's unique antioxidants neutralize free radicals the body releases when under exertion".  But when you really dig further into NEO Water's claims, there are *NO* antioxidants in NEO Water... just potassium bicarbonate, calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, which is similar to the mundane chemicals added to Essentia and Dasani water.  NEO Water's marketing nonsense says that its "alkalinity allows its molecules to carry more oxygen than normal with an extra attached electron (hydroxyl ions). As a result, these molecules are able to seek and neutralize free radicals in your body and prevent free radical damage to your cells. These natural antioxidant benefits leave your body rich in oxygen and energy."  Again, like Essentia, NEO Water hopes to blind and persuade the consumer by overwhelming you with exotic totally false techno-babble; it ascribes its antioxidant benefits entirely to its 9.5 pH alkalinity.  So if you really believe in this nonsense, you could, in theory, obtain far more amazing antioxidant protection simply by dissolving an antacid tablet into your tap water once a day.  As with Essentia's water, NEO Water's "ultra purified" water is simply municipal tap water purified using the common method of reverse osmosis.<br /><br />This Essentia Drinking Water is not the first product to tout the benefits of "alkaline water".  There have been previous highly-hyped products based on ionized water, alkaline water, and combination alkaline-ionized water.  There have even been so-called "liquid oxygen" drops that supposedly contained "O4" molecules (instead of the "O2" oxygen that is in the air) dissolved in a liquid, and by ingesting 10 drops each day, you feel more energized, but this quackery completely ignores the fact that oxygen is best utilized in the lungs, and not in the stomach.  Just as the "liquid oxygen" drops are a distorted version of twisted junk science based on the concept of oxygen bars (at least in oxygen bars, you do breathe in the oxygen instead of putting drops of useless oxygen in your stomach), this "alkaline water" concept is a distortion of the "alkaline diet" alternative medicine belief that the foods we eat can affect the acidity of urine and blood, which can then affect our well-being, susceptibility to disease, and energy level.  If you are an avid vegan/vegetarian practitioner of an alkaline diet, then this 9.5-pH alkaline water can keep your diet on its alkaline-based theme.  But if you regularly eat meats, poultry, seafood, dairy products, eggs, grains, processed sugar foods, and colas/sodas, all of which significantly boost the acidic levels of your food consumption, then drinking a slightly alkaline water makes absolutely no difference to your health.<br /><br />Your stomach has a healthily acidic pH that ranges between 1.45 to 3.5; your stomach must be very acidic to aid in digestion.  However, blood must always be slightly alkaline, with a pH of 7.35 to 7.45.  If the blood's pH drops below 6.8 (more acidic) or rises above 7.8 (more alkaline), death may occur.  But your blood automatically stays within its healthy pH range regardless of what you eat or drink because your blood utilizes several buffering systems.  The most important buffer for maintaining acidity/alkalinity balance in the blood is called the carbonic-acid-bicarbonate buffer.  To form the bicarbonate in this buffering system, your body uses carbon dioxide... guess what, carbon dioxide is in (over)abundance in the air that you breathe and you do not need sodium bicarbonate baking soda added to your drinking water to maintain a healthy pH in your body.  In fact, consuming too much supplemental sodium bicarbonate can actually lead to constipation, convulsions, diarrhea, frequent urination, and vomiting.  There is only a tiny amount of sodium bicarbonate in each bottle of Essentia water, so you do not have to worry about overdose.  But my point is that all this hoopla and hype about this water being of the "Best Available pH at 9.5" is purified nonsense.  Some other fear-mongering alkaline water sales gimmicks claim that, to quote another Web site, "Excess acidity weakens all our systems and forces the body to take minerals from vital organs and bones to buffer/neutralize the acid and safely remove it from the body."  But this is totally false fear-based junk science contrived to mislead you into thinking that your body will rob its vital organs and bones of minerals to neutralize excess acidity.  But our body's carbonic-acid-bicarbonate buffer simply combines carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air with water to make the blood plasma more acidic if it needs to, and it can prevent excess plasma acidity and raise its pH to be more alkaline by having the lungs convert the bicarbonate back into CO2 which you then breathe out.  A similar phosphate buffering system also helps to maintain the pH of cellular fluids, using phosphate instead of bicarbonate.  Phosphorus is present in nearly all foods, and regardless of whether you like to eat lots of meats or lots of vegetables, you can get plenty of sufficient phosphorus in your diet without needing to add it to your drinking water!<br /><br />Drinking too many acidic drinks such as sodas and colas can have a detrimental effect of eroding your tooth enamel, but guzzling all those colas have absolutely no effect on the pH of your cells and bodily fluids.  And regardless of how much alkalinity you consume and put in your stomach, your body is going to make sure that your stomach stays within a healthy acidic pH range and your body will use its pH buffering systems to keep your blood pH between 7.35 and 7.45 regardless of how much acidic or alkaline food and drink you consume. If you are familiar with logarithms, also realize that the pH scale is logarithmic (pH is not a linear scale) and drinking 9.5 pH water really has no effect on your various bodily fluids compared with drinking tap water or any other bottled water. And if you really could somehow artifically adjust your stomach, blood, and bodily fluids entirely to a 9.5 pH, you would be immediately wheeled into a hospital's emergency room because your body and its stomach cannot handle that kind of alkalinity.<br /><br />If you suffer from frequent heartburn or acid reflux disease (gastroesophageal reflux disease), drinking this 9.5 pH water will NOT help the least bit.  Your stomach acids need to constantly stay very acidic to maintain proper digestive functions, and the slight alkalinity of this water has no effect on the stomach acid that is entering into the esophagus of people with GERD.<br /><br />Trying to market bottled water based on its "silky smooth taste" and "hydrates better" claims, its over-hyped "9.5 pH" attribute, and all its overexaggerated health claims constitute marketing trickery to fool consumers by utilizing the "if you believe that it can really work, it does indeed work" placebo effect.  The placebo effect is a very powerful phenomenon that can frequently affect everything from clinical trials of pharmacological substances to faith healing.  Basically, if you have a hopeful mindset of expectancy and conditioning that makes you think that something will work, then that perception can become 100% of your subjectively observed reality and outcome of the treatment.  For examples of other placebo effects: If I told you that you can get stronger bones by breathing milk through your nose instead of drinking it through your mouth, or if I told you that you could be revitalized by just holding broccoli in your hands for two minutes every day instead of eating it, if you really believe or hope that to be true, then after breathing the milk into your nose or holding the broccoli in your hands, you may think to yourself, "Gee, I feel better, stronger, and more energetic after having done that!"  Likewise, if you really HOPE to feel more hydrated after drinking this Essentia water, you may actually feel more refreshed simply because you BELIEVE that this water is hydrating you better than drinking other sources of water, when in fact the tap water from your faucet could have hydrated you just as refreshingly.<br /><br />The Amazon 'Product Description' for this Essentia water falsely states even more overexaggerated health claims: "Essentia Water provides unmatched hydration, health benefits and smooth taste.  Its superior hydrating qualities come from a special electrolyte formula and optimal pH level of 9.5, which gives your body more of what it needs to thrive.  Drinking Essentia Water boosts the antioxidant properties of your immune system and helps bring your body back into balance.  It also helps maintain normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and more."  Again... these claims are way wayyyy overexaggerated!  Compared to your overall health, fitness level, and daily food diet, the trace minerals found in this water and this water's slight alkalinity really make no difference in boosting the "antioxidant properties of your immune system", nor does it "help maintain normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and more".  With this litany of false health claims, I am surprised that they also did not pile on claims that this water "increases libido, cures erectile dysfunction, grows hair on balding men, makes women sexy, and fixes the national debt" too.<br /><br />Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:<br /><br />I must admit that I personally do not regularly purchase bottled water for home use, even though I will sometimes buy it while I am away from home, both because I think that filtering my tap water through a Brita filter produces water that is just as tasty and healthy as bottled water and, just as important, I think that too much plastic (and petroleum) is used in the production of bottled water and most plastic bottles end up in our overflowing landfills.  Roughly 1.5 million tons of plastic is used to make water bottles.  And this does not include the energy used to make the plastic and the oil used for transporting all the bottled water.  It takes about two liters of water used during the production process just to make one liter of bottled water.  So behind each 1-liter bottle of water is another two liters of water that was expended during its production.  Essentia states that their plastic bottles are "safe and recyclable", but we can all reduce our carbon footprint if we drink less bottled water.  In many developing countries, tap water is either unavailable or unsafe, making bottled water a better option if residents cannot boil their tap water before consumption.  But here in the U.S., some bottled water manufacturers, including this Essentia bottled water, use fear-based advertising claims that their water is healthier than tap water, which it really is not.  The concerns for the taste of tap water are valid, however, especially with tap water that has residual smell or taste of chlorination.  But residual smells and taste issues can be easily and economically remedied by using various activated charcoal/carbon filters at home to treat your tap water.  Anyway, the tap water that comes out of my faucet at home is also slightly alkaline like this Essentia water, and many municipal water supplies are also slightly alkaline, so there is no need to purchase this bottled water that has baking soda added to it.<br /><br />This is not a bad bottled water.  It is priced competitively with other bottled waters.  But it has an odd aftertaste that I do not like.  And the techno-jargon claims that revolve around this water's selling points - 9.5 pH, "ionically separated water", "Infused With Electrolytes", and even falsely stating that this water boosts your immune system - amount to nothing but purified snake oil hogwash.  To quote William Shakespeare, all this marketing hype about 9.5 pH and electrolytes is really "much ado about nothing"!

review/summary: Over Hyped Bottled Water
review/text: The bottle says, "A Difference You Can Taste." For me that would not be a good thing. I don't want my water to taste like anything. Fortunately, this water disappointed...it tastes like, well, water.<br /><br />Now comes the problem. Essentia's Web site is full of hype, but what it comes down to is this: Essentia is filtered city water, just like Aquafina or Dasani...using essentially the same methods. I suspect the raise in pH is from the second ingredient, sodium bicarbonate, aka baking soda. I compared the water test results provided by Essentia on their Web site and those of my local water authority.<br /><br />Essentia says, "Electrolytes are dissolved minerals in the body that conduct electricity, such as calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium. We add trace amounts of those same elements in a formula that complements the body's naturally occurring mix and concentration." They must be really trace amounts. Reading their water test report, neither calcium or potassium are listed, and only .68 mg/l of magnesium. The sodium level is about the same as in my tap water. Certainly not the electrolyte levels of Gatorade.<br /><br />I can find nothing in my research that indicates a pH of 9.5 is anything special.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I'm not impressed. I often buy bottled water instead of soft drinks when traveling. If this were on the shelf in the mini mart, I would reach for the Poland Spring or Aquafina instead.

As for the higher ph the jury is still out weather it does any good or not. I did a lot of research and you can find both pros and cons. Some very respected Medical researchers say there is no way this water going into the acid stomach can do any good. I wanted to give it an honest try. Myself I prefer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CQWWKY">FIJI Natural Artesian Water, 16.9-Ounce bottle (Pack of 24)</a> You can get it here at Amazon and in my case it is considerably cheaper to do it subscription vs local purchase.

review/summary: An options for runners who usually use a sports drink
review/text: The makers of Essential Water claim to deliver "unmatched hydration, health and taste."  I'm not sure it delivers all of those benefits, but it is a good option for runners like myself that don't want the calories from sports drinks, but need to hydrate and replenish their electrolytes while exercising.  That said, buyers should now that water comes from public water sources.<br /><br />- Source - The bottle says the water is "purified by reverse osmosis."  However, it doesn't mention where they get the water so I called the customer service department and asked.  I was told the water came from "municipalities"- in other words public water sources.  The person explained that "it doesn't matter where the water comes from, the only thing that matters is the purification process." I disagree.  I prefer water from natural springs.<br /><br />- Taste - I didn't discern any noticeable difference.  It tastes like the water I filtrate at home.<br /><br />- Size - It comes in a 50.72 oz bottle. I drink a lot of water through the day and usually have water at my desk.  I find an entire gallon too big to handle and a large cup too small.  I like this size because it doesn't take up too much room, but lasts me about 1/2 a day.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because it is cheaper than a sports drink and provides the necessary electrolytes during a run.  However, I wouldn't buy it to substitute another brand that uses natural spring water.

review/summary: Great alkaline water, 9.5pH
review/text: Got a bottle of this at my local Whole Foods market to try. It has a silky taste as it advertises and it is a great starting water for people -like me- who want to see if alkaline water can make a difference in how they feel and with stomach acidity. I liked it so much, I got a case from Amazon, delivered 2-days later with my Prime account (I love it!). I am slowly going through the case, one bottle every other day, sometimes everyday. I have to say that I have noticed a stamina related improvement but I will have to watch this for more days. I was away for 5 days not drinking it and my stamina was hampered so that is an experiment I can believe, but I need more proof. Tha page says bottles are BPA free but the label on the bottle has no such remark so I am not sure which is true. The price for the 12-case was just $20 when I bought them a few weeks ago, but now I see that Amazon has increased the pricing to $25. I will check with my local Whole Foods market and if price is lower for a case there, will not buy from Amazon the next time around -sorry Amazon.<br /><br />If you are now starting to get interested in an alkaline diet for improving your health, this is a great introduction along with several books on reducing the  acidity of food intake and stomach environment for all of us with GERD, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0982708319">Dropping Acid: The Reflux Diet Cookbook & Cure</a> which I also purchased.

I also feel like I can drink more of it without getting bloated than I did with Evian.  It tastes smooth and does well at quenching my thirst, better than some other bottled waters I have tried.<br /><br />I have now subscribed to a couple of cases of this direct from Amazon each month, as the price per liter works out less than I was paying for Evian from the store on a regular basis, and with a subcription, the shipping is always free.  Hard to beat that.<br /><br />Not sure why anyone would want to get same size bottles from the NutriCity listing for this on Amazon, as the price listed there is currently listed at $66.33, and no option to use amazon prime or to be able to subcribe and save.

review/summary: Nothing noticably special
review/text: The water came very quickly and in good shape.  It was quite a bit of water (maybe 40 pounds) to receive via free shipping.  From what I could tell by my own pH test readings it seemed to meet what was advertised.  As far as effect on urine pH testing I could not see any noticable difference from drinking the water.  As a minimum it was just regular bottled water, had no chlorine, and tasted OK, nothing remarkable.  I now have second thoughts about buying a product that leaves behind so many plastic bottles.  I have switched to another source of bottled water that does not require so many bottles.  I am also not so concerned about the pH aspects of the water.<br /><br />I will try pH buffering tablets, also adopting a diet that emphasizes alkaline producing foods vs acidic.

It's pretty expensive and there are great waters out there for a fraction of the cost that are just as wet.<br /><br />Essentia has electrolytes for flavor. Well so does Smart Water and it's like half the price. And really, does it really do anything for the flavor? What does an electrolyte taste like anyway? Do electrolytes come in different flavors?<br /><br />Water is important. Cost is important. I can't find anything about this water that makes it a value at this cost.

review/summary: Will drinking this brand make you drink more water?
review/text: Although the 1.5 Liter size is a bit too large to carry around conveniently, the water does taste good. What I liked about it was that it was not carbonated, it was smooth, and it did not leave an aftertaste.<br /><br />I really don't think that the pH of water is going to change your overall body health, but many like to think that the water they are drinking is pure and free of nonessential elements. The makers claim that Essentia has a special electrolyte formula but it is difficult to analyze this without a comparative chemical analysis.<br /><br />The important thing to remember is that getting plenty of fluid is very important to overall hydration. It is felt that water is the preferred fluid (vs soda, coffee, tea, alcohol, flavored drinks, gatorade, etc.) Drinking the proper amount of water, in addition to other beverages in moderate amounts, every day will help you to be more healthy and lose or maintain weight so make sure you know how much you need!<br /><br />Instructions to determine basic overall fluid need per day:<br /><br />  1)  Weigh yourself and write down your weight.<br />  2)  Take the number of pounds you weigh and multiply that by 2/3.<br />  3)  That is the number of ounces you should drink everyday. The conversion is: 30 mL to one ounce.<br />  4)  For example, if you weigh 150 pounds, two thirds of that is 100 and that is how many ounces you should drink daily. So that would be 3000 mL or 3 Liters of FLUID.<br />  5)  Add 12 ounces of water for every 30 minutes you work out.<br /><br />If you are under the care of a health care professional or have conditions that alter your fluid need from the average person, please seek advice.<br /><br />So, if drinking this particular brand of water helps to make sure you have adequate fluid intake because you like it more than tap water or other bottled water -- go for it!

review/summary: A Long drink of Water
review/text: This water is pleasant to drink, tasting clean and fresh.  I did not find it to be as smooth and silky as either Smart Water or Fiji water. Frankly, it was on par with the water that I pour out of my Brita Filter. It was palatable chilled and also made a nice cup of coffee.  Although the large size is nice to have on hand, I found the bottle unwieldy for anything other than in hyouse, in refrigerator use.<br /><br />As far as the health benefits claimed, I cannot confirm  that the ph is 9.5.  It is really just municipal tap water purified.  Drinking water is certainly beneficial and clean, purified water is better than the alternative. Would I buy it inlieu of juice or soda?  Sure.  Would I buy it over Smart Water or Fiji water?  Probably not.

review/summary: Premium water that you'd never be aware of without the premium price or label...
review/text: OK. Honesty time. I did a blind taste test between this water, some Nestle Ice Mountain bottled water (purchased at Meijer) and some Great Value bottled water (purchased at Wal-Mart). I couldn't taste any discernable difference between these waters, despite the difference in costs. They were all cold, wet, and refreshing.<br /><br />I finished this large 1.5 liter bottle of water in three sittings - all while watching TV or reading. I can't say that the water seemed any more refreshing or thirst-quenching than any other make of bottled water I've ever had. I realize that some effort was put into optimizing this water, but are the benefits REALLY discernable? Not to me. The difference is sort of like doing 24 push-ups or doing 25 push-ups. Either way, you're accomplishing what you want to do. I think the biggest difference is what you believe in your head. If that positive mental boost is enough for you, than go ahead and get this water. It certainly isn't going to do any harm, right? You'll just end up spending a bit more money. If you'd rather have the standard variety of bottled water and pay less money, do that. No harm in that route, either.

review/summary: Good recovery water, bph free etc but not wild about the taste
review/text: My spouse is training for a marathon so has been on a bit of a tangent about water, hydration etc...I also run and thought this would be interesting to give a try.<br /><br />The first thing you will notice is this is a big bottle! It's a nice sized but don't expect to fit this into the cup holder at the gym.<br /><br />BPH free - I've become much more aware of this growing problem and have taken pains to reduce/eliminate BPH products as much as possible.<br /><br />Vitamins and minterals - yet one additional nice touch without the sugar or other substitutes. Just plain energy and hydration without the harmful additions.<br /><br />Price - for a case of 12, the price is actually pretty good especially when compared to isolated bottles of water...most of which are not BPH free. It's also fairly equitable to sports drinks (filled with inferior sugar and chemicals).<br /><br />Taste - this is where we differed. The spouse tasted absolutely NOTHING whereas I felt it had a slightly salty type taste. Nothing major but just sufficient to be less than desirable. It is indeed "soft and silky"...very similar to water from my Big Birki filter. I like the fact that it's not filled with impurities.<br /><br />All in all, I would consider purchasing this above other water options and certainly above chemical/sugar laden sports drinks.

review/summary: tastes a little salty at first
review/text: I usually drink tap water and can only compare this to that experience. I used to drink city water which was treated with Chlorine which I would purify using a Brita water pitcher. That allowed me to review the harsher chemical elements from the taste. This water, since it is pre-filtered, lacks such chemical tastes out of the bottle, of course, but the first sip carried a salty taste reminiscent of bicarbonate of soda. This quickly dissipated and then it really didn't taste like much of anything, which is how water should be.<br /><br />Others have talked about a "silky" taste, but that is really about the mouth feel of the water (the equivalent of texture in food). If you are the sort of person who really attends to the experience of drinking water, this may be of value to you, but I think most people are drinking water for hydration, not for its taste or feel. The health benefits are something that I think one cannot measure. You can either take their word for whether or not the pH levels or electrolytes are helpful or not as it'd take a long term study to really know.<br /><br />If you're going to drink bottled water anyway, this would be a nice choice. If you are mixing water with other things and are sensitive to chemicals from other types of water purification, this may also be a good option. However, for most people, I'm guessing that they'd be just as happy with filtered tap water. I know that I will be.

I did like the taste of it, very fresh and clean, but to be honest, it didn't really taste any different than the filtered water I get from my own fridge.  So while I liked it, at the end of the day it was water, and there wasn't anything special about it that would lead me to want to buy it rather than drinking my own filtered water for free.

review/text: I love water and this water tastes great and is extra smooth. It is supposed to have a pH of 9.5 which makes it more alkaline which is much easier on our bodies and systems. I am a huge fan of alkaline foods such as salads and green juices, you can even get rid of indigestion by drinking some dissolved bicarbonate of soda in water. So, it is not surprising that this water actually has a small bit of bicarbonate of soda in the ingredients. This water has no after taste and is smooth and refreshing. It may be even better for hydrating because of the 9.5 pH. I would purchase this product in the future.

review/summary: It's Filtered Water with Baking Soda & Salt in It....
review/text: So according to Essentia's website, "Most bottled waters offer purity but not additional benefits. With Essentia, you get added electrolytes as well as a much higher pH level, providing superior hydration."<br /><br />I looked up the additional ingredients and found that it's pretty much filtered water with scant amounts of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) included.  In fact, each of the other additives (dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfat, and calcium chloride) are pretty much added salts.  Factoring that in with the 0s across the board for calories, sodium, carbohydrates, proteins, etc, you're really getting water with ridiculously scant amounts of mineral in it.  Will it make a huge difference in your life, such as giving you a better night sleep or amazingly clear skin?  Probably not - the placebo effect of you believing that you feel better will, though.  When it comes down to it, you can be chugging all this 9.5 ph water, but it won't matter much once you eat something...the acidity or the alkalinity will change immediately once you eat.<br /><br />When it comes to taste, the water actually tastes like the bottle water I chugged in China.  That said, it tastes like water, but with a metallic tinge to it.  It's not bad, but it's something I personally don't like tasting in my water.  If I had to say a water tasted "silky smooth", I would immediately turn to Voss water, but that's just me.<br /><br />All in all, it's still water, and if offered it, I would drink it.  But I do ding some stars for taste, hype, and cost.  It's probably cheaper to buy a reverse osmosis distiller over time - at least you can filter enough water the entire family!

review/summary: better than flavored drinks
review/text: This water tasted better than some of the flavored vitamin type water drinks. But I find nothing to rave about the taste. I drank it at room temperature and used it during my kungfu class. Not familiar with the science of the 9.5pH and how that will affect the body long term. It did quench my thirst during a class which lasted a few hours. This water tasted like my tap water which is run through the fridge built-in filter. I did not see a difference in the two, however my 5 year old grandson said it tasted like plastic.<br /><br />It seems a sad state of affairs to me that we even have to bottle and sell water. I am old enough to remember our homes all having drilled wells that drew water from the aqua filter which runs under our island. It was free. TV was also free and much better quality. Now the aqua filter is being polluted by run off, making it necessary to filter water. I am hoping we don't get to a global state where water is more expensive and scarce than oil. Not making these remarks to be political or preach, just explaining my reasoning about how I feel about bottled water. I only buy it when I can't carry enough with me to get through a day, or a trip or other outing. I buy it instead of flavored drinks, or soda or energy drinks and I resent having to pay such a price for water and am sorry that we have to use so much extra packaging on basic items.

review/summary: convenient source of alkaline water
review/text: This water is based on the premise that many people experience an acid/alkaline imbalance.  In general, the western diet is more acid-producing, and there are issues that arise from a chronically acidic condition.  An approach to being overly acidic is to counter the acidity with alkaline foods.<br /><br />There is one school of thought that says alkaline water can't really change the pH of your cells because your body automatically maintains its own pH balance.  But maintaining a proper pH balance is difficult if you're constantly introducing acidic foods and drinks.<br /><br />Water can be either naturally alkaline or naturally acidic.  Chemically pure water is one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms connected by covalent bonds.  In nature, water dissolves many different substances which give it various tastes, odors and pH values.  Pure water has a pH between 6.81 and 7 depending on the temperature.  Water with a pH less than 7 is said to be acidic and water with a pH greater than 7 is basic or alkaline.<br /><br />A pH of 9.5 puts Essentia water somewhere between baking soda and milk of magnesia.  So this water is not just mildly alkaline - it is quite alkaline.  The taste is really quite pure.  I couldn't detect any off-taste or odors.  The water just tasted clean and pure.<br /><br />In my opinion, drinking a bottle or even a case of this water won't magically restore your body to an ideal pH level.  But it will induce your body to potentially counter an acidic state, particularly if you tend to be overly acidic.<br /><br />If you wanted to make your own alkaline water at home, you could do it by getting a good quality distilled water and mixing in a half teaspoon of baking soda.  This will give you water in the 8.5 to 9.0 range.  But I guess the benefit of drinking Essentia is that it's is purified through micro-filtration, UV lighting and reverse osmosis which rids it of chlorine and fluoride.  They also add minerals back in and restructure the water through ionic separation.  What is ionic separation?  In this case it is a process that creates smaller molecular clusters which support more rapid hydration.  But understand that water molecules don't organize unless there is an impurity in the water (hence my suggestion of making your own with distilled water).<br /><br />My verdict:  If you suspect or know you are overly acidic, Essentia could help make your body more alkaline (provided you are not negating the effects by continuing to consume mostly acidic items).  If convenience is what you're after, this water is going to be consistent and it will have a great taste.

review/text: I was really looking forward to tasting the one bottle of water since I drink a lot of it (water). I buy Smart Water by the case. I have a sodium deficiency so need the electrolytes in the Smart water. I also live in a town that has no public water at all. We all have well water as our supply.<br /><br />This is a 1.5 bottle of water, which is a nice size. I drank it in one day and within that day I did get sick. I did not think it was the water until I read what alkaline water can do to you. I read, can't claim it, but read that the alkaline detoxes your body and neutralizes the acid in your stomach. We need acid in our stomach to process the food we eat. I read a lot of people that got sick drinking alkaline water, it might be a small percentage but I was one of them. Supposedly over time after it `cleanses' out yours system, you will feel better. With one bottle and getting sick, I cannot say that.<br /><br />It did taste good but not great. I could taste an aftertaste that was metallic like and it just did not seem crisp to me. I did finish the whole bottle, again in one day, but sadly would not buy this or drink this again if given a few more.<br /><br />The fact that it has so many additives, good or not, but yet no claims can be made or studies have been done to prove the benefits, I am leery.<br /><br />Yes it was good, not great, but getting so sick on the day I drank it and reading others that went through the same thing online is enough to keep me away.

review/summary: Pure Water
review/text: Water with a PH of 9.5 is very desirable, when you drink water this high of a PH your literally protecting yourself from many diseases. This is perfect for taking along with you on our walks or trips it will hydrate you much better than  ordinary filtered tap water.  Water is a very important substance that we put in our bodies and it has to be pure and balanced at least, this is not just balanced it is over the top.<br /><br />Essentia is as smooth as silk, soft and very refreshing. We used to have a natural spring near our summer home I used to go and fill our jugs up with water in a natural spring and this water reminds me of that spring water.<br /><br />I like this water and I would buy it for myself.

review/summary: It's Just Water
review/text: Whoever sells this makes a few claims that would be hard to verify without running some sort of scientific tests, such as the electrolyte thing and the 9.5 pH. But even if I assume that's all true, it still didn't do anything for me that regular water wouldn't--certainly not to an extent sufficient to assuage my guilt at using a non-biodegradable plastic bottle.<br /><br />I drank this 1.5 L bottle (Vine reviewers only get one) a glass at a time over the course of a few days, usually after running.  It was really no more refreshing than the water I usually drink out of my filtered tap. It quenched my thirst neither more quickly nor more slowly than usual. It tasted a bit different, but that's true any time I drink water that's not from my usual source. The taste was inoffensive, but I certainly wouldn't describe it as a "silky smooth taste," which is what the bottle promises.<br /><br />And what can I conclude from all of this? That the experience of drinking this liquid is, in fact, no different from that of drinking plain old WATER!

review/summary: Water with an aftertaste
review/text: I drink water all day long. Usually plain out of the tap water. If it tasted like this I would not. Perhaps the electrolytes that they say are added provide some health benefit but they seem minimal and there are better ways to get them. This water had an almost metallic aftertaste (such as you get with over chlorination)Also at a hefty 1.5 liters the bottle is not a convenient size unless you plan on leaving it in the refrigerator to use.

review/summary: Delightfully surprised!
review/text: I am one of those people who is not good at drinking water.  I know that it is vitally important to drink plenty of water each and every day, but I have never been one who could make myself drink much of it.  It is because of this that I am always on the lookout for great water beverages and let me tell you, I have had little luck.  Most mix in leave an ick aftertaste because of the fake sugar.  I also greatly dislike carbonated drinks.  When I saw this Essentia product, I was very curious to give it a try.  Through the years, I have tried many different brands of bottled water.  Some have a "soapy" taste, some have just a plain weird taste and others are not bad.  Where does Essentia fall into?  I would have to say that it falls into a category that ranks high on my taste bud o meter.<br /><br />The bottle claims that it has a silky smooth taste.  I don't know if I would say that, but it does have a very crisp and fresh taste to it.  I spent the afternoon outside mowing (on a rather hot day) and when I came in, I cracked open the bottle of Essentia.  It was delicious.  Now, of course I was dying of thirst, lol.  An hour later I am nearly finished with the entire bottle! For me, that is amazing, lol.  I am really enjoying the way the water tastes (or lack of taste, whichever the case may be, lol)  I can honestly say that I will hopefully be purchasing more bottles of this in the very near future.  I have not seen it in stores around our area, so will probably order from Amazon.<br /><br />Bottom line, I am incredibly pleased with this water, look forward to enjoying it in the future and highly recommend it!!

review/summary: Good
review/text: I like the size of the bottle the Essentia comes in as it is a 1.5 liter. It will last you a while if you are carrying it outside for work, sports, or outdoor activities.<br /><br />The manufactor uses a special technology to get a 9.5 ph. The bottle says, "purified water infused with electrolytes for a difference you can taste." it seems it can help hydrate, but I disagree with a part of the statement. The water taste good, yet it taste just like any other water in a bottle. My wife tried it and could not taste a difference either.

review/summary: Taste better cold. Has been chlorinated.
review/text: I would have preferred this be natural spring water but it was processed to come very close to a natural taste. As long as you get to near freezing temps. Hot and room temp reminded me of my mom's city water that is run off from the sewers which is highly chlorinated and filtered to kill bacteria. We have an artesian well for our own water than can not be beat for purity but this at least does not leave a bad taste like some bottled water we have tried. Upon opening I truly expected a profound odor. It was there, but not as bad as expected. We have had bottled water that had a fishy odor upon opening at room temp.<br /><br />This is not something I would choose to stock up on or consume in large quantities. Plain old water from a natural source is what nature intended for us anyway. Nothing is better for you than that.

review/summary: An Extraordinary Water
review/text: I didn't know what to expect when I received this bottle of water from amazon. Our tap water tastes terrible, so we always drink the generic store-bought bottled water which is a cut above tap.<br /><br />Well, ESSENTIA bottled water is gorgeous.  To me it tastes like what fresh water from a spring would probably taste like.  It is so fresh tasting with absolutely no after-taste.  I don't know how they do it!  The label reads purified water with electolytes, so obviously this is not spring water, but it is a superior bottled water that I would highly recommend.  I'll definitely get this again.  A clean, fresh, wonderful tasting water.

review/summary: Very drinkable alkaline water
review/text: Without wading into the controversies surrounding the use of alkaline drinking water to improve body chemistry, I can share with you that this water is very drinkable in that it is largely indistinguishable from our tap water notwithstanding its "ionization" and the addition of electrolytes.  It did not upset my stomach or cause any other physical reaction, as is sometimes reported when using other alkaline water products.  If you're inclined to go alkaline, this product appears to be an effortless - if pricey - way to do so. The 1.5 liter size is perfect for a day at work, too.

review/summary: I like
review/text: Well, there really isn't much that you can write about a product that is as simple as water, so I'll try to keep this review brief. When it comes to bottled water, I either like their taste or I don't. The ones that I like are Desani and Nestle waters, with most of the other ones not making the cut. Essentia is definitely in the "like" category, so if you have a similar taste to mine you'll like this one as well. I've been reading about the benefits of 9.5 pH for your health, and they seem persuasive so if this is something that you might be interested in then I'd say to give this water a try. The 1.5 liter bottle is a bit too large for me, so I'd probably go for a smaller size (0.5 liter or so) in the future. I also like the sports bottle shape of the cap more, but I don't think that Essentia comes with those kinds of bottles. Overall, very satisfied.

review/summary: Simply Good Water
review/text: I am not a water expert.  In fact, I am one of those people who simply does not drink enough water.  Although I try to keep some at my desk and by my bedside, it can take me a week to get through a small bottle of water.  Instead I drink everything from milk to soda to coffee.  As such, I'm not going to talk much about PH levels and the various additives in this water.  Frankly, I don't really know much about that, and I'll leave that discussion to the experts.<br /><br />When I got the Essentia Water, I really wasn't expecting much.  I can say this:<br /><br />Taste - the water tastes good.  Since the water has an ingredients list containing lovely Latin terms for things I've never heard of, I was a bit afraid that there might be an aftertaste.  Nope - just tastes like very good, very clean water.<br /><br />Hydration - I felt refreshed and hydrated after drinking it.  LOL - I can't answer to the better sleep they advertise.  I have an energy-filled four-year-old who wakes me at odd intervals.  I can certainly say that I felt refreshed all day and the next day as well.<br /><br />In fact, when I opened the water that day, I shocked myself - I finished the whole 1.5 liter bottle!<br /><br />Bottom line - I liked the water and I've ordered more.  I see less sodas and more water in my future.  :-)

review/summary: I was surprised
review/text: Water.  It's sort of difficult to review because a lot of us take it for granted.  At home, I distill my own.  (We have well water which is high in minerals. Not good for coffee.)  I also tend to drink carbonated water instead of sodas so I'm very used to a neutral taste.<br /><br />When I received this sample I was first surprised at how large the bottle was.  Personally I like a large bottle as there's less recycling and I don't have to be constantly remembering to refrigerate the next bottle.<br /><br />The other thing that surprised me was how refreshing this water was.  I don't know about you but sometimes after doing something strenuous -like mowing an acre in 95-plus degree heat- water doesn't satisfy my thirst.  I can drink water until I slosh and I still feel dry.  With the Essentia I was happy after about half a bottle.  I drank the rest so that I was sure I was hydrated, but I wasn't 'dying of thirst' after drinking half.<br /><br />The one down side I had was that I thought the water had the slight flavor of the plastic container.  I liked the water enough though that I'm going to get another bottle at the grocery store and see if that was just a fluke.<br /><br />Pam T~

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: Firstly I should mention that I only tested one bottle of this water, so as for long-term benefits of the 9.5 pH I can't really comment, but as for taste I can safely say it is a refreshing bottle of water. And I should also mention that I'm pretty picky about my water. Not all of it is created equal, that's for sure. Essentia certainly passes my Yum scale and feels plenty hydrating--although no more than my usual bottle of water, as far as I can tell.<br /><br />I like the 1.5 liter size because I like to keep a bottle of water handy pretty much all times, but do be aware that it's pretty big so if that's not what you want... keep it in mind.<br /><br />Overall, great tate, affordable price, maybe long-term benefits due to the bonus electrolytes and balanced pH. A great choice, IMO, but I wouldn't really consider it any more fantastic than other bottled water.

review/summary: Refreshing Water - Recommended
review/text: This Essentia 9.5 pH drinking Water is good tasting, having no real discernible flavor, and is quite refreshing. The 1.5 Liter bottle is more than I typically drink in one sitting, even after working out, so consumed my test bottle over two days.<br /><br />My first observation is that does taste significantly better than our municipal provided tap water and on par with the filtered water that we buy in bulk for regular "hydration" when working out. I did not notice any immediate quantifiable benefits from the adjusted pH or additives, but did feel more refreshed over drinking plain water.<br /><br />This is a reasonably priced alternative to sports drinks and regular bottled water!<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Water water
review/text: This water is very refreshing - meaning it does have a nice `no-taste'. It's a bit better than my tap water; but luckily I live in an area where the water always comes out very high on `taste tests'.<br />It is refreshing and a bit clearer tasting but as for being worth paying a price for when good reliable tap water is available, I have my doubts. If you are not sure your water is good then this might be a better alternative; but quite frankly on an environmental scale of avoiding an overabundance of plastic bottles, I would rather see it sold in bigger containers where a consumer could refill their own - traveling is another matter.<br /><br />As for the ph. of 9,5...Pure distilled water contains an equal number of H+ and OH- ions and is considered neutral (at pH 7), neither basic nor acidic. It might pay you in the long run to see what your local water's ph. is. Ours is ph. 8. I'm not sure if that little bit in a ph. difference would matter. It seems as if most of the claims this company makes for its water would be cured by drinking more of any good clean water - which granted this is, it just costs more than good tap water.

review/summary: Purified water rather than spring water
review/text: It is important to note that this is not bottled spring water like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F9HM6G">Evian Bottled Water 24 bottles 11.2oz</a>. (Incidentally, Evian spelled backwards is naive.) Instead this is water that has been purified and then supplemented with calcium chloride, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulphate and sodium to adjust the pH of the water. So if you are on a low-sodium diet, you probably don't want to drink this.<br /><br />When I drank this water, I immediately noted the rather bland taste. The truth is I prefer the taste of the filtered water from my refrigerator water filter or my Quixtar filter. However if you feel the health benefits of pH balanced water are legitimate and worth the investment, then this product may be for you.

review/summary: Good tasting water.
review/text: Good tasting water.  This is a big bottle of water; 1.5 liters is equivalent to about 4 soda cans or 6 glasses of water.  Plastic bottle is not as flimsy as most water bottle which crumples on your hand.  Normal PH level of water is between 6.5 to 8.5, whereas pure water is 7 and  less than 6.5 PH may be acidic or called soft.  Acidic is considered not good for your heath if it is what you drink most of the time.  Hard water is above 8.5 PH, and considered not so much of a risk to your health than acidic.<br /><br />If you drink a lot of water bottles, this is a good alternative for many of the popular brands already in the market.

It makes you feel fuller when you are watching what you eat, it makes your skin look healthier and is important as a part of a good diet.<br /><br />Now you might think water is water, right?  No, not really, there is one particular brand of water on the market that I just think doesn't have a good, clean taste, you know, tasting like it has a lot of minerals and such.  This water is very good, refreshing, clean taste and comes in a nice 1.5 liter bottle, perfect to put in the door of the fridge.<br /><br />Overall, very good tasting and even moreso chilled.

review/summary: Tastes great and comes in a huge 1.5 L bottle
review/text: I doubt that Essentia water can truly provide some of the health benefits that it claims. It claims that it promotes normal blood pressure, provides restful sleep, promotes good heart health and increases muscle strength. However it has a nice taste and I enjoy drinking it.<br /><br />It certainly tastes a 100 times better than tap water and it tastes better that the average bottled water. There is only one brand that I like slightly better. One big difference about this water is the size of the bottle. The average bottled water is 16.9 oz. This bottle is 1.5L and it perfect for me. I usually drink a lot of bottled water when working outside in the heat or while exercising. I can down a regular bottle of water in a few seconds but this bottle will last me a while.<br /><br />The cost per bottle is a little on the high side but you have to factor in the size of the bottle. Each Essentia bottle is equal to 3 1/2 regular size bottles. That being said the cost is still a little on the high side but that is the case with all of the higher quality bottled waters.

review/summary: A more natural taste.
review/text: Let me first say that the packaging looks different than what it shows on the website. It looks and feels antiquated. But what matters is what is inside, correct?<br />I tasted essential against 3 other waters. One was a simply filtered water (from refrigerator disperser), another had minerals added- bottled water, and the other one was tap water (which tastes different depending on what part of the country and even in different municipalities).<br />Lets just say that essentia won...here are the differences from worst to best:<br />- Tap water: let's just say its like taking a big gulp of pool water...you know that chlorinated taste.<br />- regular bottled water (from local non-spring source, reverse osmosis, destilled, and minerals added): it's tasted like any other bottled water. It's ok and this should be the base standard.<br />- Filtered water (from my refrigerator): I might be biased but the filter does a good at removing chlorine and particulate without removing some minerality, it tastes fresh and clean.<br />- Essentia (aka, the winner): the mouthfeel is smooth and it coats your mouth, it doesn't weight heavy on you, I guess this might be the electrolytes or PH balance. It was pleasant and reminds me of spring water but not necessarily "refreshing". I believe it will serve its purpose vs some of the sports drinks out there.<br />The other thing that bothered me was all the health claims that they make. I guess you could make those for water in itself. At the end of the day I would go for natural spring water over any other source/method of bottled water.

review/summary: Nice clean bottled water with faint mineral taste
review/text: I normally drink NYC tap water which has a great flavor.  It comes from beautiful reservoirs upstate and is closely monitored for safety.<br /><br />When I do drink mineral water, I will almost invariably choose something like Vichy or Apollinaris with a bit of flavor and some bubbles.<br /><br />However, this Essentia water is quite good for a lightly-mineralized non-gaseous bottled water.  It does have a very faint soft mineral taste on the tongue which might not even be noticed under ordinary circumstances.<br /><br />It comes in a large 1.5 liter bottle that is surprisingly easy to grip and pour and I really like the fact that it is filtered and treated with UV light.  It would be good to keep on hand for emergencies.<br /><br />I am a little skeptical about any advantages of the 9.5 pH except as it affects the taste.  I would think that the gastric acid in the stomach would make the pH of this water irrelevant instantly.

review/text: This is definitely one of the better bottled waters I have tasted. It has a crisp clean flavor that tastes more like a distilled water than a spring water. It doesn't have a soft taste, which I find many bottled waters do have. It reminds me more of the flavor of Dasani or Aquafina bottled water over softer ones like Fiji water. Each 1.5 liter bottle is huge, so keep that in mind when comparing price to number of bottles. These are much larger than you would drink in one sitting. Very delicious cold, right out of the refrigerator!

It is enhanced with minerals and honestly, I can taste the mineral taste which I like. Funny that a good tasting water is different from most drinks that we consume. Water is one that we want without any taste or flavor - just pure, fresh, wet and clean. Essentia is one without any noticeable flavors but the mineral taste.<br /><br />I really liked it and gave it to my family too. They were surprised with a yum which isn't really a reaction that I normally get from water.<br /><br />It has 9.5 pH factor and infused with electrolytes. Can't really tell those things from drinking it but good to know. Recommending completely on taste. It's excellent tasting water.

review/summary: It's water...with some extras added.
review/text: This water is what the description says...smooth, and jolted with some extra minerals to help out after a hard workout.<br /><br />Ingredients:  Water, baking soda, dipotassium phosphate (salt that dissolves very easily; this also controls acidity), magnesium sulfate (epsom salt) and calcium chloride.<br /><br />My original take before drinking the water was "why on earth can't we just eliminate all the ingredients except for...you know...that water?"  Well, after downing 50.7 ounces after a workout where I was dripping wet with sweat, I think I can answer my own question.  No, the water didn't taste better or magically make me feel like I didn't just workout.  But, as an alternative to Powerade or Gatorade, drinking a bunch of this Essentia water to restore electrolytes is MUCH better than all the Red #40 and High Fructose Corn Syrup you'll find in the flavored junk.<br /><br />Recommend...

review/summary: Tastes Great & I love the size...
review/text: I am very picky about flavors of water.  There's only about 2-3 out there that I care for.  My favorite brand and the only bottled water that I purchase is Nestle Pure Life.  This tates very similar to me.  I love the flavor and I do think it's silky, smooth as described.  I have zero complaints about the flavor.<br /><br />This size of the bottle is perfect for me when I'm outside for long periods of time like doing yard work or playing outdoor games.  It's a great size to take to sporting events too.  The only thing it's not handy for is my walking.  I walk daily and always take a bottle of water with me but this is a bit too big and bulky for that.<br /><br />I can't really give any feedback on the benefits that it lists such as sleeping better and helping to maintain normal blood pressure because I haven't used it for an extended periord of time but if it does those things then it's just an added bonus for me.  I would buy it simply for the taste.  I don't think the current price is bad at all.<br /><br />I would recommend this water.

review/summary: Good to have on a long hot motorcycle ride
review/text: I figured a 450-mile mid-August motorcycle ride would be a good way to evaluate Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water, so I poured a bottle of it into my CamelBak and set off from my home in northeast Arkansas for Indianapolis and the MotoGP races last Thursday morning.<br />The stuff kept me well hydrated and clear-headed all the way to Indy, which was a very good thing because we were overtaken by torrential rains just as we reached the city and had to negotiate flooding streets and rush-hour traffic to reach our motel, which wasn't where we remembered it because the interchange has been reconfigured.<br />Throughout it all, I never felt the "out of it" fatigue that goes with dehydration on a hot day. It's also easier on my stomach than regular tap water or ordinary bottled water.<br />Essentia will be my water of choice for future hot weather rides.

review/summary: ...Water...
review/text: The water is said to taste silky, but to me it just taste like regular water. If you were to give me water out of a sink in a cup and this water, I honestly couldn't tell you the difference. It does keep you hydrated, but if you want that regular tap water would do just as well.

review/summary: Better Than Spring Water
review/text: I know most people think water is...plain as water.  If you don't notice any difference between Fiji water, Poland Springs, and NJ tap water, then you might be right.  Personally, I notice a big difference.  Fiji, comes from aquifers that run below the Earth's surface unlike spring water.  It has a high silicon content that gives it a fuller body and I like the taste of it much more than most bottled waters.  Essentia is filtered water that is "enhanced" to the point where it has a similar feel and flavor to Fiji.  I can't say I notice a difference due to the pH, but sure, that sounds nice I guess.  Overall, I like Essentia's mineral taste and silky texture.  It is free from chlorine and flouride that plague a lot of tap water.  The BPA, Phthalate free bottle is great too since i have young children.

review/summary: It tastes ultra clean
review/text: Okay so I didn't expect anything spectacular but both my husband and I tried this and we were both a little dumbfounded. I don't really know how to explain it and all my husband had to say was it tasted "soft" We have filtered water and it there was a difference. This water is refreshing. Worth the price? Ummm, not in my opinion. I think we are an average household and there's no way we would afford to drink this on a regular basis. We do want to stress that we did like the water, but not for this price. I'll stick to my filtered/bottled water.

review/summary: Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water
review/text: Not sure what to say, it's water....It didn't taste any different than my tap water after it goes through my Brita filter. If it has any health additives it won't be noticed for some time and won't be sure it's from drinking this water. It did taste fresh and had no chemical taste of any kind.

review/summary: Very hydrating
review/text: I'm pregnant, and for whatever reason am feeling constantly thirsty.  This was an absolute blessing.  The additives don't leave too strange a taste, and I found it very hydrating--it's nice to have something quench my thirst. The bottle size is great, making this the sort of all-day bottle you can take wherever.  Very impressed with the product.

review/summary: Great water, don't know about health claims
review/text: There are a few things I do know, the normal PH for water is 7.0 when neutral. I also know that a ph of above 10 or below 3 will kill the fish in my pond. So I wouldn't recommend adding it to your goldfish bowl.<br /><br />But I have also read articles on the fact that our American diet leads to acidity, and we can help compensate by drinking alkaline water.<br /><br />So if you feel like this is a product that is helpful, this water tastes like water and does all of the same things water does. I drank a huge glass before bedtime, and sure enough, it got me up in the middle of the night. Interestingly, I did drop a full pound of water weight overnight as well, but I can't be sure it was caused by the water, although I will be repeating the experiment.

review/summary: It's water
review/text: If you couldn't tell, it's a bottle of water. A really big bottle of water. It has a slight taste to it, like one person said kind of a tap water taste, but I didn't think it was bad. I didn't particularly find it any more refreshing than any other water. I don't know if I truly felt the effects of the "best available pH" (9.5). It did have a pretty silky feel to it as I drank it. It is supposed to have electrolytes in it so if you want to be able to have hard workouts in the heat where electrolytes are truly needed and you don't want the sweet taste of sports drinks or Vitamin Water AND you don't mind the high price, this may be for you.
