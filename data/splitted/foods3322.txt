review/summary: Cats and Dogs LOVE them
review/text: My cat and dogs LOVE these, in a sort of sick drug addicted way.  They are pricey, and you have to store them in the fridge, but my pets seem to think they are wonderful.  If you are trying to train a pet to do something, these would work very well because my non-food driven pets would do probably just about anything for these things.  I don't buy them often because they are expensive for such a little container, but they are nice for Christmas or some special time.

review/summary: The Cat is Happy!
review/text: I buy these on a regular basis for my 22 year old cat. He loves them. They are kind of expensive, but he is worth it. And he does not get them all the time, but when we go to bed. My dogs love them as well, but they don't get them as often. They are freeze dried chicken (I have tried the other ones:beef, liver: cod, with less good results). Every once in awhile one of the treats is a bit hard, and those I give to the dogs. Some containers have more hard treats than others (about every fourth in some), but most are pretty good. I have also tried other brands and they are not as well liked by my cat as Halo. When the container gets low, I sometimes sprinkle the crumbs on his food. He loves it.<br /><br />I bought them from this seller because I was running low. I typically buy them at Whole Foods Market in Texas, but have been out of state a bit and needed some. I tried this seller and they were very quick and the treats were about the same price at the ones at WFM. My cat is happy. When he is happy, I am happy.

review/summary: My cat goes nuts
review/text: Man, my cat loves these treats. As soon as he gets eats a piece, he looks around frantically for another.<br /><br />I've tried out these treats on three other cats. One didn't know it was food, but the other two went frantic over the treats also.<br /><br />One note though, this is the first time I've used them and just now, probably 3 weeks after I've opened the package, I saw the "Must refrigerate after opening". I feel bad giving my cat what might have become spoiled treats, but he never cared. I threw out what little I had left and am buying more.

review/summary: Cat loves it, but it is fragile for shipping
review/text: My cat flipped out the first time I fed him the treat.  He acted like it was miracle from the heavens and was so excited.  They seem to be good quality and tasty.  The only issue is the fact that it is freeze dried means it doesn't ship well.  There are a few big pieces but a lot of the pieces have been smashed to dust.  I am not sure if there is a way around this, but it is sad to throw away the dust at the bottom which I am sure is equal to a few treats.

review/summary: Still great after many years
review/text: I've been feeding Halo freeze dried chicken treats since 2002. I won't give them anything else because these are simply the best. All I have to do is call out "treat" and they all come running because they know they will get these. This packaging is new but I like the new package because it no longer takes up as much space as the cartons did and also that I can squeeze all the air out. The treat itself is still the same as it's always been and I've never had an issue with quality control.

review/summary: My cat would walk over hot coals for these!
review/text: My cat, Gigi, would walk over hot coals to get to "liv-a-littles".  She loves her other treats....but these are a special thing.  Although she is 10 years old, she does amazing tricks for liv-a-littles.  (She even asks for them by name!  In cat speak...."mmr-a-mmmrr".  She now does about 6 tricks, including jumping through hoops, rolling over coming back to a sit, blah blah blah....video to come on youtube soon.  Search for "Gigi" .  In the meantime...get your cat's these treats!  My cat goes INSANE for them!!!  Worth every penny!  I used to buy them at Petco, but they stopped carrying them.  Amazon has a great price.  Trust me.  If you want a bond with your cat (tricks or no tricks)...get them these liv-a-littles.  You will be amazed!  And they will be soooooooo happy!!!!  (Plus, they are all protein and incredibly healthy!)

review/summary: Great treat for diabetic pets
review/text: Bought these treats for my diabetic cat, as he can't have any treats with "stuff" added to them. These are completly natural and high in protein. They do have sodium added however, so I use them sparingly. My cat inhales them!!! The chunks are a little too big for a cat's mouth, but very easy to break into smaller pieces. Overall, great natural treat.

Totally worth buying even though the price is high for the amount of treats you get in each container.

review/summary: Great healthy and delicious treat
review/text: Who'd have thought plain freeze-dried chicken would be so irresistible to cats? I also call this stuff 'Kitty Krack' - all my six cats love it.<br /><br />The healthful part is also a very big concern for me since one of my cats is diabetic. Halo's is one of the very few treats around that's low carb enough that I can give them as a reward for him cooperating with blood testing. It works great. The diabetic guy heads right to his testing spot on the sofa as soon as I get the jar of Liv-a-Littles out of the fridge and give it a shake. The other kitties follow us and wait for their share of the treat action.<br /><br />It's not cheap, but I give them each a small chunk and a little extra for the one getting blood-tested, and a jar usually lasts for five days or so. Well worth it.

review/summary: HER FAVORITE HIGH QUALITY TREAT!! AND SHE'S TRIED THEM ALL
review/text: Wow this stuff is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G...my dog is on the ground trying to find CRUMBS of this stuff from our last training session. I know its a HIGH HIGH PRICE compared to other traditional items for what seems like a small canister of it, but really its worth it. Its healthy. And really two regular sized chunks of this (maybe theres 30 chunks in the jar), anyways just a few chunks broken up are perfect for a training session for a puppy. One chunk is about an inch to an inch and a half and I break it up between 3 and 4 pieces...today is the first day she's tried it. It's cheaper to get it in the store (petco) if you're getting just one jar (due to the shipping you will have to pay)...however if you and your dog like the stuff it's worth spending a hundred on the larger quantity, and then breaking it down you're only paying $8.00 a jar (and thats including shipping) when you order up. ALL I CAN SAY IS WOW WOW WOW... and after she stopped looking for crumbs, she did a little cute wimper wanting more, and then came over to me a few minutes later (As I was typing this review) and came over to do some more 'playing'...hehe I petted her and left her alone for a bit now she's chewing on a rib bone from last night. Anyways this stuff is amazing!! You should try it...<br /><br />Sandra and Lilly [the dog =]

review/summary: Halo Liv-a-Little Chicken Cat Treats
review/text: This is an outstanding product.<br />I have 2 cats, and I am very conscious about what I feed them. They are like my children, and I only want to feed them the best. I heard about Ellen DeGeneres' company, Halo, and their products for pets. I respect Ellen and her deep love of animals. The treats are all natural, just freeze dried pure white chicken meat. I bought them, and gave each of my cats a small piece, and WOW, you would have thought it was catnip. They both started purring and rubbing up against me for more.<br />Now, it is a nightly treat. At around 9:30, they both let me know they want their chicken, and I feel happy knowing I'm giving them something safe, and healthy.<br />I will admit that they are expensive. It is not a very big jar, but I break apart the large pieces, and give them each 2 small treat size pieces a night, so the jar lasts a long time. Once you open them, they do have to be stored in the refidge. The only problem that I have is that everytime I open my refidge, one of my cats tries to con me into giving her an extra treat. This rarely happens, but you have to be careful not to shut the door on a tail.<br />I have recommended this product to several friends, all of whom have had the same result with their cats.<br />*****

review/summary: Pavlovian Response
review/text: If you expect to ever open the freezer in our house without being surrounded by five sharks, er, cats, you have another think coming. The freezer is where we keep these treats and their dry food (to kill storage mites, which will infest even airtight containers at room temperature or the fridge. The freezer will kill them), and any time the door is opened I am swarmed by kitties you'd think haven't eaten in a week. T turns into "Godzilla Cat," an 11-pound sleek black DSH with round, golden eyes who loses his mind at the mere mention of these treats. Noisily demanding satisfaction, it is a task to distribute the Liv-A-Littles to the maddening crowd with any degree of fairness. They are also extremely useful to use as a reward when administering medicine. I pretty much have no problem giving any medication that I've previously tried (and failed) with Pill Pockets. Happy cats = happy people  >^..^&lt;

review/text: Halo makes great products, my cats love them.  They especially love the Liv-a-Littles White Meat Chicken Protein Treats.  The only issue I have is that lately they seem to contain more pieces that are so hard I can't even break them apart.  Obviously, if I can't break them, my 6 month old kittens don't stand a chance.  I keep buying them because they are superior to everything else on the market (in my opinion), but given the cost, it does get a bit pricey.

review/text: My cats go nuts for these treats.  They are soft enough to break into smaller pieces for piggy kitties that don't chew.  They would also be good for a cat (or dog) who is sick and not doing so well eating.  You could crumble them up on top of some food, or maybe coax them into eating a few plain.  They are basically pure protein, which is fantastic since most house cats tend to be a bit portly, my two included. And as we all know, protein is one of the main nutrients, especially for cats.  These are my cats second fav, but it's a very close race.  I've got my friends' cats all hooked too!  Even the super finicky ones!

So when my friends gave my cat these chicken treats for Christmas, I was a bit skeptical.<br /><br />To my surprise and utter disbelief, she goes crazy for these treats! I ordered them online and had to wait four-weeks since they were on backorder.  Maybe all kitties are liking this treat!<br /><br />The backorder issue is my reason for four stars...Otherwise, I'd give it five stars.  In my panic to find more treats in the interim, I found that Whole Foods carries it for ~$10/container.

We use Halo as a reward at medication time, and to tempt cats who are feeling under the weather.  A little "chicken dust" on their food, and the appetite is back.  For ill or elderly cats, this product is a must-have.  I do wish the chicken was organic, and I would be willing to pay a little more for that benefit.  Yes, these are expensive, but a little goes a long way.  We just don't feed the regular grocery store junk any more.

review/summary: Guard with your Life
review/text: Both cats love Halo's Liv a Littles Freeze Dried Chicken Breast. My youngest cat wanted nothing to do with these treats for a long time then one day changed her mind and now is the biggest fan in the house. I haven't tried the Beef or Salmon. Chicken is king around here.<br /><br />I reserve these for once in a while treats or to entice eating by sprinkling it atop newly introduced wet/raw foods. The Halo website says the chicken is made in a marinade broth of sodium phosphate, salt, and carrageenan before it's freeze dried. I trust Halo's practices but do wonder how much salt is used in the process and wish the amount was on the label.<br /><br />I also have a tube of Thrive Freeze Dried Chicken from a UK company that has been very popular at holistic pet retailers lately. Their claim is that it's 100% freeze dried chicken and nothing else. I can't garner any more information than that from the tube or the manufacturer website, but my cats go nuts for Thrive just like they do Halo.<br /><br />These are expensive little treats but the cool thing about them is they can be served as solid chunks or broken into dust like particles, or wet by adding a little water. I have to think that with so many cats out there who have lost teeth, this is probably a superior treat to have once in awhile.

review/summary: "You Complete Me"
review/text: A brief glimpse into the world of Cinnamon, the Chihuahua Princess of Midtown Manhattan:<br /><br />"My Daddy not only does all the typing for me (I'm preserving a manicure, naturally), he also caters to my desire for home-cooked meals. I know, I know: whatever complaints may thus ensue about me being spoiled and finicky are completely his fault, but Daddy knew that when he decided that both nutritionally and economically (not to mention emotionally) this worked out best for both of us.<br /><br />That said, I've lately become a bit fussy -- even when it comes to really, really good meals like freshly cooked pork or beef or chicken with the vegetables that Dad insists I eat. You might understand if I were to turn my cute little nose up at, say, Alpo... or even Grade-B ground beef; but I'm summarily rejecting the good stuff that my old man tastes and actually enjoys as he's preparing it for me. I think it's a phase, because I feel just fine, but I'm trying this whole new "I am not amused or pleased" routine to see how far it'll get me with him. I'm holding out for a mink hoodie and a pony to ride in the country this summer."<br /><br />OK, now on to Dad's own story:<br /><br />"I saw these on Amazon as I was searching for the desiccated beef treats my girl likes. These were about a third the price and one of the few brands in the price range that was actually just MEAT and not some sort of dehydrated hodgepodge of gunk.<br /><br />I figured I'd give them a shot. I opened the container when they were delivered, and tasted it myself after reading the ingredients (which are "chicken" and "marinade", basically). Dried chicken. What's not to approve?<br /><br />The princess was given a piece. She turned her nose up at it and returned to her faux-nap.<br /><br />But as soon as I'd turned my back I heard the chewing and within moments she was at my feet looking for more.<br /><br />I was still waiting for her to eat the plate of delicious food I'd slaved over an hour or so earlier, so I wasn't giving in. Test complete. Treats would be saved for a time when they were actually deserved.<br /><br />And then I read the label as I pretended not to notice her neediness. "...as a tasty incentive at mealtime."<br /><br />Hmm...<br /><br />I took out another chunk, crumbled it on her food, and watched as she sniffed, licked, walked away, reconsidered, and returned to the scene of what she HAD considered my culinary crime.<br /><br />Incentive indeed. Her plate was clean about two minutes later. She was fed, I was vilified, and these chicken treats elevated in both our opinions to the level of 'Heroic.'"<br /><br />From both Cinnamon and Daddy;<br /><br />"Thank You, Halo Liv-A-Littles."

review/summary: May have made our kitty sick
review/text: We try to feed our cats wholesome healthy foods, so we thought these treats would be a great alternative to the kitty junk food they had been eating.<br /><br />Our 12yo girl cat sniffed these and turned up her nose. She is superrrrr picky, and lots of times will not consume something the first time you offer it to her, so no biggie.<br /><br />Our 2yo boy cat, as other reviewers described, went nuts. We gave him a few small bits (maybe the equivalent of 3 regular cat treats in size) and were delighted that we had found a treat he enjoys (he does not like the treats typically found in supermarkets and such).<br /><br />About 24 hours later around 11pm we noticed he was straining to urinate, unproductive, and jumped in and out of the boxes about 15 times in 30minutes, growling and hissing at the box, and hissing at us when we tried to pet him or pick him up. He urinated on our bed, on his bed, on his pillow, and on the couch. This cat never urinated outside the box before (except during car rides in his carrier) and had never hissed before (even at his evil, manipulative, bullying "older sister" cat that loves him dearly).<br /><br />We called the vet, who squeezes him in first thing in the morning, he had a uti. Several hundred dollars in medicine, overnight hospitalization, and aftercare, he is better.<br /><br />The only thing we changed in his diet (or, for that matter, in his life) in the two months leading up to his illness were these treats. After the vet told us UTIs were usually related to diet, we threw these out. We will probably never know exactly what caused his illness, but we have a sneaking suspicion...

review/summary: Really tasty! .. and good for you
review/text: I got these on a recent Jet Blue flight and were very pleased with them. They're crunchy like nachos, but have a meatier texture. The surface of the chip has lots of bumps and bubbles that you can see and taste. They add a nice mouth-feel and crunch to the overall experience of eating these chips.<br /><br />One bag has only 140 calories (35 from fat) and very low sodium (110 mg), so you can eat a whole bag without feeling much guilt. There are no artificial additives or preservatives in this product. The only comment I have is that the taste is a bit sweet because of added sugar. I prefer a stronger salt taste.<br /><br />Popcorners are also relatively hard to find. After having these on the flight, I looked for them at a local Boston supermarket. I only found Kettle, but none of the other flavors (butter, sea salt, white cheddar, cheesy jalapeno). An excellent and healthy snack.

review/text: Fantastic snack food.  Once you try them, you won't be able to get enough !  They're also great because they're not that bad for you in terms of healthy eating.  The smaller bags (1.1 oz) all come in around 140 calories for the bag, and little to no saturated fat (some have .5g, which is still super low).  Add to all of that, the fact that they taste great, and you may have found your substitute for unhealthy chip snacking.<br /><br />I know some people have had a hard time finding these chips in stores, and I can say that the the place I've found them most consistently is World Market.  Every one I've gone to has had them and I'm super glad they do.  Do yourself a favor and buy a bag there, see if you like it and then come back here and order the 40 pack.

When he was a pup, we had him on Purina Puppy Chow and when he turned two, we took him to visit a family member and noticed he kept trying to eat the other dog's ALPO. Needless to say, the other dog wasn't too happy.<br /><br />When Buddha was old enough to have dog food, we knew what to buy. When we walked in with the bag, it's like he knew exactly what it was. He jumped for joy, did a quick little spin and was ready to eat. I swear, if he were human, he'd have a handkerchief around his neck, fork and knife in hand.<br /><br />He loves ALPO Come'N Get It. Not only does it smell delicious (unlike other dog foods that smell like Play-Doh), it's inexpensive, so it doesn't hurt our wallet. He certainly doesn't seem tired of the flavor as he certainly acts as though he looks forward to being fed. As soon as he hears the bag, he comes running.

review/text: Once my cat ate Fancy Feast she became insufferable if she did not get her can a day.  I started with 1/2 can to give her as a daily treat.  Well she would start pacing and following us around feeding time.  Also she is part Asian so she talks a whole lot.  So to see her or hear her you would have thought we were torturing her until she got here can and then  when I got it and opened the can she started meowing very fast until you set her bowl in front of her like we were starving her.  Then she is ok until tomorrow.  Sometimes she will wolf it down and want more.  Thankfully she still eats dry food too or I'd have to start buying in bulk to save money.<br />I have also noticed that her fur is very shiny and she is very energetic not like she was in need of the energy.

review/summary: Bad food made cats very ill x 2 boxes
review/text: My cats have eaten this food for years, I usually buy the orange box with the chunk of meat. I sometimes buy different flavors. About two months ago I bought the kind that is chopped up I bought it before a 100 times, but this time my one cat developed vomiting, and then he vomited so bad he started throwing up blood tinged vomit. I was so scared. My other cat got diarrhea. Anyway, at first I thought my one cat vomiting could have eaten something else, it was a guessing game. So in 3 days my cat got well again thank goodness. So time passed and I bought the orange box of food nothing happen. Then last week I changed out to the chopped kind in the light purple box and the same thing; cat vomited so bad I had to feed him honey water to keep his sugars from dropping and keep him hydrated, and my other cat diarrhea again.  It has to be this food and I swear I cannot understand why all of a sudden both my cats get ill from this food unless it's bad some how, certainly they both didn't develop a allergy at the same time, so I bet the food was toxic. I'll never buy again.

review/summary: Bernie loves it!
review/text: Our fat cat Bernie has always eaten dry food. We got a sample can of this in a bag of his Purina dry food and gave him a little to try. He at first backed off from it..then tried it. He now gets half a can each night when my wife comes home as a special treat...he still has his ration of dry food...and he pesters her until she feeds it to him.

review/summary: OMG! kitty crack!
review/text: My 8yr old, Toni, was getting fat, lethargic, gagging up hairballs 3x a week + had lethal smelling poop. After ruling out any medical issues the vet told me i was basically feeding Toni crap. I went on a quest 4 remedies of these issues. I wasted a ton of money on stuff Toni wouldnt touch. I eventually found a pricey but healthy dry food (Castor+Pollux Organix Indoor Adult) + a great hairball remedy (Vets Best Hairball Relief + Digestive Aid) but Toni never liked the "healthy" canned foods til my neighbor sent me home with a can of Fancy Feast. Granted its not the healthiest can food out there but it was a huge step up from what she used 2 eat. Most importantly, Toni licked the plate clean! She goes absolutely gaga over this stuff. Any flavor, any texture and there are tons of varieties! Shes lost 3lbs, is playing with her toys again, is shedding less, hairballs are non existant + her poop no longer requires a breathing mask! Happy healthy kitty = relieved mommy.

review/text: Overall, this product is good.  It appears from the label that there is nutritional value and there is not a lot of filler.  The ingredients list does not start with a lot of filler.  There's good variety so if your cat is like mine, it won't eat the same thing every day, this is a good option.  Overall, I recommend this.  The price is even better if you plan out your purchases and subscribe to it.  There's a discount price and no shipping.  Even if the price is the same, you're saving $$ on the gas and tax alone running to the store.

review/text: This sliced food looks very satisfying.  It's juicy with gravy and the chunks of meat look filling.<br /><br />And it doesn't smell bad, which is great.<br /><br />The cans are the tiny 3oz cans.  They are very easy to open and I don't get kitty food splashed on me.<br /><br />He seems to lick his plate with all the Fancy Feast products, so they are winners in our house.<br /><br />This is a great product.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is my kitty is more into the Fancy Feast Loaf Variety Pack.  But, he doesn't seem to mind a little something different once in a while, as long as it's still tasty, which this one seems to be!

review/text: My older cat is a picky eater and he won't eat any other wet food and my female kitten makes alot of noise as soon as she smells the food when I open the can, so all I can say is that changing their wet food is not an option since they love this stuff. I especially like how the meat is sliced or grilled and my cats prefer it that way instead of the mushed kind.

review/summary: Macadamia Nut is my new favorite Torani flavor!
review/text: I've been trying to lower my caloric intake but I can't stand plain water, so lately I've been drinking water with a little bit of Torani syrup added to it (3/4 - 1 oz syrup per 36 oz glass), and I have to say that the Macadamia Nut flavor is definitely my new favorite!<br /><br />The flavor is distinctly Macadamia Nut, with the same buttery nut flavor that I love in white chocolate macadamia cookies & Ferraro Roche candies (both of which I'm trying to avoid now). As soon as I opened the bottle I could tell that it was going to be good just by the smell, but I was surprised to find myself skipping over my old favorites (Coconut, Mango, & Orgeat/Almond, linked below) and choosing the Macadamia Nut flavor for most of my drinks now. I've been avoiding caffeine, but I definitely think this would be great in coffee or hot cocoa too. And this morning my husband replaced some of the sugar in his pancake recipe with this syrup & the results were wonderful!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2SQ">Torani Syrup, Coconut, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2T0">Torani Syrup, Mango, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2ZE">Torani Syrup, Orgeat (Almond), 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)</a>

review/summary: This is not a review of the product, rather just a thought on Venezuela's situation
review/text: I read the product specifications and I couldn't help but feel a pang of pain at reading "Product from Colombia". Harina PAN is originally a product from Venezuela, and it has a lot of history. As a matter of fact, it was the first corn flour industrially produced, and at the time it was akin to the effect Henry Ford had when he created his production line. Before Harina PAN, women all over the country had to produce the dough for arepas single handedly. The creation of Harina Pan was really revolutionary and allowed for the arepa to survive the changing times. And now, thanks to that person in power whose name we all know, I see that product, which is almost synonymous with Venezuelan identity, identified as "from Colombia". It really does hurt.<br /><br />So, if you are reading this you are probably a Venezuelan expatriate or someone interested in Venezuelan cuisine. This product is, as a matter of fact, fabulous. It's so great even though it's hard to find in Venezuela (again, thanks to our economy), people bend over themselves to buy it when it finally arrives at any given supermarket. Even people who work with the government do this. I recommend it very highly. Cheers.

Leftovers (if any) freeze good too.<br /> Also makes a vegetable dip that everyone wants the recipe for - mayo, sour cream, minced onion, minced garlic, pommery mustard: its so good you don't need the veggies!<br />I am not a fan of plain mustard so don't know if you can use this product alone as a condiment.<br />Bon appetit

review/summary: Best Straight Mustard Ever
review/text: When you say "mustard" this is the stuff you should mean-- fragrant, acidic, sublime.  Unfortunately, the price reflects not only the wretched value of the dollar against the Euro, but a 100% tax imposed by the US government!  Imposed during the Clinton years, the 100% tariff on French Mustard still remains on the books-- and it's more than high time it came off! Write your Senators and Reps-- I just picked up two jars in Paris at an overpriced shop there-- at under 10 Euros each!<br />If you can't wait, though, for the wheels of government to grind this mustard fine, exceedingly fine, then pony up the extra dosh and get some. Me, I'll be bringing a bigger suitcase next time, and considerably more than two jars home with me!

review/text: Used to be able to buy this mustard in almost any cheese shop at a price thought high at the time ($9.00) - but no more...it just seemed to have disappeared.  My family used it exclusively  and we all had uses for the crock, too. So I began a search for my mustard and finally found it on Amazon.  It made my day!<br /><br /> I love the mustard itself - so different from the usual; this is only seeds, water, spices, etc.  For the last few years have been buying it on Amazon. Use it on everything - sandwiches, lamb chops, deviled eggs and still love the crock it comes in. If you Google "Pommery Mustard" you can get recipes and rave reviews from restaurants who have incorporated into their menus.<br /><br />It's a bit pricey because of shipping, but worth every penny and it lasts a very long time.  Have told friends about it, and once people use it they never want to go back to the yellow/brown/ supermarket type.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon, you came through again!

I  will actually crave this and eat it straight from the crock W/ a spoon, so you can only imagine it on a sandwich. I use this in many of my recipes and it makes them so special.

review/summary: Best mustard ever.
review/text: This is a stone-ground mustard that is just wonderful on a sandwich or in recipes that call for mustard where it is not completely blended into the other ingredients but is still visible on its own.  The flavor is wonderful; not too strong or too hot.  This isn't a Dijon-style mustard and there is no hint of horseradish.  Try it and you'll be hooked.
