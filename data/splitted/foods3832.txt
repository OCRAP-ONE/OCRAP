review/summary: The Cheerios replacement for gluten-free babies & toddlers
review/text: Just what the title says - for all you parents of gluten-free babies who see people feeding their kids Cheerios everywhere and anywhere, these puffs can be that "anytime, anywhere" snack that keeps your baby happy. The container is already a good size for carrying in a purse or diaper bag, so you don't even have to empty them into a baggie to bring with you.<br /><br />They dissolve fairly easily and our daughter has been eating them as finger food since she was about 8 months old. She loves them and so does our five year-old.<br /><br />One thing to watch out for if you are gluten-free: not all varieties of these puffs are gluten-free, though they are all clearly labeled if they do contain gluten, so it's not hard to identify which ones.

review/text: I got these puffs and they are wonderful!  My kids don't even want to eat the other brands of puffs anymore!  My kids love the Sweet Potato Puffs because they are crunchy, sweet and always taste fresh!  I love that you get more puffs in this container than any other brand.  I really love the HappyBaby products and think that they are the best!  Even my four and two year old sons love their products!

We can eat gluten but it is nice to know that there are yummy choices for those who cannot!

review/summary: Perfect for babies who want to be social!
review/text: I started giving these to my 7 month old daughter because every time her 2 1/2 year old brother had something to eat she looked at his food longingly. She loves them and blazes through them pretty fast. She's been able to work on her dexterity while trying to pick them up and she chews them (she has 8 teeth already) though they dissolve well too. I picked this product since the ingredients are right in line with the foods I've been introducting to her. Wish there were other flavors that were gluten free, but we'll be there soon enough (and other brands don't seem to have a gluten free option). They are rather boring tasting to the rest of us, but for a new solid food eater, they allow them to eat socially with the rest of us.

review/text: My daughter loves these and will clap and giggle when I take them out.<br />When  my older daughter was at the age of eating puffs, it didn't occur to me that there was sugar in baby food.  Sounds dumb, but it really hadn't occurred to me.  I am a big fan of Gerber formula but these puffs win over Gerber without a doubt.  With Subscribe and Save these are a fantastic value.  They are organic and don;t have the sugar like the other brand.  We have also tried the banana and she loved those just as much.

A must for when we're out & about and she needs a quick, non-messy snack.

review/text: I just want to say "Thank you HappyBaby!".  Hallelujah!  As a mom who has a gluten free baby who also only eats organic, I was delighted to find this product and what's more important?  My son really likes it!  The cereal melts in baby's mouth, so not much of a choking hazard and it is just crunchy enough that it's nice on those sore, teething gums.  There is only one store within a 30 mile radius that carries this flavor and no stores have the only other gluten free flavor, which is strawberry.  I was happy to find that Amazon carries both flavors and sells them for a wee bit less than the market I found it at.  Woo doggy.

She likes the puffs fine in this flavor - now that she has been able to tolerate other grains I have tried her on other flavors thinking she must be bored of the same flavor all the time - but so far she only likes this flavor.

review/text: I love the fact that the puffs are organic but they have no taste whatsoever.<br /><br />I can't tell apart sweet potato from any other flavors available by happybaby (we have tried banana and green apple). My daughter never ate them, and now I tried giving them to her little brother and he just spits them out.<br /><br />I'd say that if your baby would not eat bland foods (like baby cereal without any fruit/veggie), then skip these and try other brands. Gerber puffs have a lot of flavor and my kids love them.

review/text: First, I love that there is finally a gluten free version of Puffs for my kids.  When kids finally discover the fact they can feed themselves, they can get over excited and stuff 800 Cheerios in their mouth!  At least with Puffs, they dissolve better than Cheerios.  Plus they are cheaper ounce for ounce than the Plum kind and Gerber.  This is a great healthy, snack for little ones.

review/summary: Convenient & tasty
review/text: I recently bought an 8 ounce home popper and had read favorable reviews about the pre-packaged kernels, coconut oil, and salt packets.  After scouring Amazon and reading the reviews, I finally settled on Great Northern.<br /><br />The packaged shipped immediately within a day of purchase and arrived on schedule.  Be warned that based on the climate in your area, the oil portion in the packets may be solidified or liquid.  Regardless, it melts instantly in a hot kettle if you receive it solid.<br /><br />As for the taste, I was not disappointed one bit.  Some reviews have mentioned that it is too salty, but I found it just right.  I do prefer salty foods, though.  Based on the look of it, I thought it would turn the popcorn a ridiculous yellow hue, but it didn't.  The taste was exactly like you'd get at the theater or ballpark and it was not too greasy.  I highly recommend this product for anyone looking to make theater style popcorn at home.

review/text: After reading reviews I purchased the 2.5 oz. pkgs. of Great Northern Popcorn. It popped up nicely.  Very few "old maids". I did notice that a lot of moisture gathered on the sides of our popper (the Waring WPM25 model) during the popping process so I pulled the tray of popcorn out promptly. I could see if you left it in the machine, even for a few minutes, that the popcorn could absorb the moisture and lose its crunchy texture.<br />I will definitely buy this product again.

review/text: I think the Wabash Valley Farms portion packs taste the most like the popcorn I get in my local theaters, but the Great Northern Popcorn Company's Portion Packs taste the best.  Using the full portion of flavored salt does make it too salty for my taste so I use just 3/4 of the portion amount (the 4-Oz. portion pack contains exactly 1 teaspoon of flavored salt).  I've also found that the 6-Oz. portion packs work just fine in my 4-Oz. Maxi-Matic Table-Top Popper, better suited to movie night party quantities.

review/summary: Nothing like real carnival style popcorn
review/text: With all the rave reviews, coupled with the fact that these pre-packs include all the right ingredients, I assumed the  result would be at least 75% authentic carnival style popcorn for my popcorn maker. After all, I have used packs like this for over 10 years (at a previous employers Ag Equipment business), of which was amazing!  This product is not. On a scale of 1-10, I'd rate it about a 2. It is edible; although extremely salty. Tastes nothing like carnival style popcorn, severely lacking in butter flavor. The only positive aspect of this product is the convenience in the pack itself. So if you're used to buying cheap jiffy-pop, over the stove style popcorn, this would be better. I Would not recommend.

review/text: I like that these packages are just the right size for 1-2 people and that there are very few unpopped kernels.  This does taste a lot like the popcorn at the movies.  If you like your popcorn very salty, this is the product for you!  However, I don't!  I like more butter flavor and only a little salt.  It's simple enough to snip off a small corner of the popcorn side of the packet and pour out most of the salt.  Unfortunately, out of the 20 packets I bought, six of them were not separated properly and the salt and kernels mixed with the oil, so I am stuck with the six overly salty bowls of popcorn.  I really wish this company made a low salt or unsalted version of these packs.  I'd definitely buy more if I didn't have to taste all that salt!

review/summary: Salty
review/text: I had high expectations but it was extremely salty and tasted nothing like movie theater popcorn. Next time I try popping it ( I do have 23 more packs to go through) I'll try cutting back on the salt in the packet. I don't know how this popcorn got such ratings. I'll give it another shot though out of the love I have for popcorn.

review/summary: OLD POPCORN
review/text: I recently purchased this popcorn and less than half of the popcorn popped.  And those that did pop were tough. I believe these were old.  I've purchased other brands and they all have an expiration date printed on back each pack.  These had no expiration dates printed, therefore there was no way of knowing how old these were or how long they have been in their stock. I popped the jolly time brand and it popped perfectly.  I also find that this is on the list of things that can't be returned per Amazon.com policy.  I'm going to purchase the Jolly time popcorn at Smart & Finals. Cheaper and there fresh!!!  What a rip off!!!

review/summary: Best Popcorn Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: My family loves the taste of the popcorn and our guest love the fact that I have a popcorn machine that I proudly display in our bar area of our home. When I say it taste better than movie popcorn is that when you couple our popcorn machine with a high quality popcorn product like Great Northern, you get a complete balanced salt, butter and movie popcorn flavor. Don't go cheap on the popcorn and you will never buy microwave popcorn again. Great Northerns 6 oz popcorn bag comes premeasured and you will never have to add salt or additional butter to get the movie taste that we are all after. Plus the upside, unlike movie popcorn where you go to that giant butter machine,squirt that liquid death over the top part of yor popcorn only to find that it never reaches the bottom of the bag. This has the same great taste without making you feel like a short order cook at McDonalds and each kernal taste just like the first. I am a part time chef (fulltime banker:)), I will never buy any other popcorn product again after eating this.  Kuddo's to Great Northern for a fantastic and consistantly GREAT product!

review/summary: Updated Review
review/text: Had to rescind my previous review, I finally figured out why the popcorn was not working properly.  I got the Paramount Entertainment popcorn maker with the 6 oz kettle.<br /><br />Here's the right way to pop this corn in the 6 oz version, take exactly half of the three ingredients and put them in and THEN when they are done do the other half.  No more 60% old maids anymore, thing is the bag seems sized to the 8 0z hopper and its just too much for the 6oz at once so alot wasnt popping.  Doing half at a time changed everything, very good popcorn!

review/summary: Ok in a pinch, but found better alternative
review/text: Got this to go along with the Maxi-Matic 4oz machine.  It gets the 3 stars just because of everything being pre-packaged.  I didn't care for the flavor of the popcorn and found it not buttery and overly salty.  Will try to not dump all of the salt in next time.<br /><br />I found a better alternative was using a product called Butter-it which I purchased a gallon of through a local restaurant since it is sold by Sysco. It is a soybean oil base so it's liquid. Use 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 heaping cup of kernals and if you want add a splash of salt and it is the best popcorn I have ever had....well, it is the same as in the pub I got the oil from, but still the best.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I was very excited to try this popcorn given all the rave reviews.  Like another reviewer, however, I am disappointed by the amount of unpopped corn.  I did three batches in my new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NCPXBG">Maxi-Matic EPM-450 Elite Tabletop Old-Fashioned 4-Ounce Kettle Popcorn Popper Machine</a>.<br /><br />There was over a third of the popcorn left unpopped in each of those batches.  I was afraid it was my new popper so decided to try it in my old Stir Crazy popper.  This time there was about 1/4 of unpopped kernels but at least a full cup of poorly popped corn (tiny, tough pieces).<br /><br />So I tried some old Orville Redenbacher's I had in the pantry in the new popper.  Almost all of it popped with only about a tablespoon of unpopped kernels.<br /><br />The flavor of the Great Northern was wonderful and what DID pop was crunchy and not at all soggy.  I don't know if I was sent old product (I couldn't find an expiration date anywhere) but I won't be ordering it again.

review/summary: Popcorn
review/text: We have purchased this popcorn twice. It's just the right amount for our popcorn popper as we have a 4 oz kettle on the stand up machine. About 95% of the corn pops so expect to lose a little but this is normal with an automatic paper as occasionally a popped grain of corn will take an unpopped grain of corn with it as it leaves the kettle. The oil in the packages in the first batch stayed firm however the oil in the second order is completely melted. We have not yet figured out the reasons as storage condition for each were exactly the same. This is a good product however you are paying a lot more than bulk ingredients when it comes prepackaged like this.

review/summary: Perfect movie theater popcorn!
review/text: These packets are all you need to achieve the perfect movie theater popcorn experience!  If you love popcorn like we do look no further!  It's not to greasy and is a little on the salty side but it only makes you want to eat more!  To make, just follow the instruction on the packet by pre-heating the pot then dumping the contents in.<br /><br />The packets are divided into a solid oil side and a kernel/salt side.  If you want to reduce the salt content, Just pinch the bottom of the packet where the salt is, holding some of the salt back from going into the pot.  Although, our family loves it just the way it is!<br /><br />I highly recommend this product as I will be buying more soon through Amazon.com!

review/summary: Great for the price
review/text: I've been buying this popcorn on the subscription program for the last 1.5 years. Overall, the kids absolutely love the popcorn - it tastes even better than the movies and for under $1.00 per bag, I figure I'm getting a good deal. However, one issue I have is the large number of "Old Maid" unpopped kernels. I haven't used other brands, so I'm not sure what is normal, but it seems that about 20% of the kernels do not pop. This is an average over 1.5 years of using the Great Northern brand in a Great Northern popcorn machine.<br /><br />If you have found a popcorn that makes a higher % of the kernels, you may want to avoid this brand, unless of course, it costs 25% more $.

review/summary: I love this product
review/text: I have used about 5 or 6 boxes (24 count) of this brand and have really liked the flavor and the the freshness in every order that I received. I have only tried one other brand and thought it was stale and did not like the flavor. For me it is not to salty in fact I add a little salt before I pop it. I use one or two a day and always have a bowl of popped corn out for my grand kids. When ever they come over they always head to the snack shack (a little stand alone cupboard)for a treat. We try to have healthy treats but I think the pop corn is probably more healthy than the granola bars,crackers,cookies or dried fruit snacks and they seem to like the pop corn best. The only problem or maybe a benefit is that I have to floss a lot more.

review/summary: not movie theater popcorn
review/text: This popcorn is not the same as movie theater popcorn. If you have ever been to target and tried the popcorn that they sell at the little target snack bar it the same as that but ten times saltier. I recommend only outing half of the packet of salt. I am the tips of guy that eats super salty popcorn but this was way to much. Instead of buying this you should buy coconut oil, and kernals from the store, it ends up to be cheaper and tast allot more like movie theater popcorn

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: Great popcorn.  My family and I love watching movies and eating popcorn.  We consume more popcorn during the fall and winter months.  We received this popcorn and quickly made our first batch.  Wow.......It was great.  We made the mistake of not mixing everything together (oil, popcorn, and buttery salt).  That was our fault because we didn't read the instructions due to excitement.  But our first batch was still very good (a little salty because we added the salt mix last).  We made another batch two days later and it was awesome.  This is as close to theater popcorn made in our house ever.  It was really, really good.  Every kernell popped and it was a perfect balance.  We will NEVER, and I mean NEVER buy microwave or store popcorn again....We will be placing another order very soon.  I almost forgot to mention that we bought the 8oz bags.  That was enough for a large bowl which will feed 2-3 of us.  Can't wait to order another batch.....Enjoy

review/summary: Pretty Good Flavor
review/text: This stuff is great. I use it in my whirley pop and it makes perfect popcorn. Flavor is pretty darn close to movie theater. Everyone in my family loves this stuff. I do like a bit more salt on my popcorn but this can be a bit too salty even for me. I cut the salt pack open before the rest and take out the salt. I would say I use about half to 3/4 what comes in the pack. Then I cut the rest of the pack open and dump it all in. This is about the right amount of salt for me. The only problem is the salt is butter flavored so you loose a bit of flavor doing this. I'd say make a batch like normal first and then adjust the salt to taste if needed. That's an easy fix. I save the salt and then I use it for future popcorn making without the kit.<br /><br />If I can find some smaller sample packs to try of other brands, I may look into that in the future when it's time to order more. But if I don't ever find anything else, this stuff is pretty good.

review/summary: closest to theatre style popcorn
review/text: Really good tasting popcorn, best I have tasted yet. A bit salty in my opinion. Just a hint, when making popcorn in theatre style poppers, always pre heat the kettle, it avoids soggy corn which sticks together. Fact is, the only thing that makes theatre corn better, is what's used in the preperation, meaning your oil and seasoned salt. You can make just as good as popcorn on a cheap popcorn maker with the proper ingredients.

review/summary: For grandkids,,,, easy really great healthy snack
review/text: We just got the Great Northern Princeton popper a few weeks ago and also sent a 24 count prepackaged case of the Great Northern 8oz pop corn. The kids (11 and 6) really love it... They actually do the popping themselves. I have just ordered the auto buy/shipping option for having them delivered every 3 months. Got a 15% discount to do it and makes it really convenient and saved a bit also. The kids have raved about the popcorn and the popper also,,,so its been a rally good deal for us. This popcorn is very healthy for the kids (Check out the actual info about the product with Coconut oil). If there are any problems in the future I will amend this rating. Hears hoping that this works out well.

review/summary: Poppin' Good Northern Popcorn!
review/text: I have a commercial type popcorn popper in my man cave garage. I entertain a lot. I have tried to measure out my own popcorn but tired of that, so started buying Northern Popcorn packs a number of years ago. It always pops perfect and tastes great. Its always a hit. I highly recommend. OH, And if you want less salt, just cut back on that portion. I tried other brands of packets and they were way too salty. I personally like the recipe Great Northern uses. Keep poppin' my friends.

review/summary: Ballpark Popcorn in my Kitchen! Woo-hoo!
review/text: I enjoyed the popcorn at our minor league ballpark so much that I was craving it even when we weren't heading to the games! Then we moved, and I admit I panicked a little bit - great addictive popcorn is 'few and far between'. I sent email to the ballpark, and the concessions manager gave me all the information about the brand of popcorn they were using. It was very exciting to find out I could order the same all-n-one packs from Amazon!<br />I have been thrilled with the 2.5-ounce size... it's the perfect size for a popcorn loving snacker. More than one snacker? Open 2 or 3 packs! Easy to make on the stovetop or microwave. I'm back to order more!!

review/summary: Dan's Perfect Popcorn
review/text: Dan's Perfect Popcorn<br /><br />Note:  This is a very thorough recipe, but it is very important you follow these steps closely.<br /><br />Heat 2 TBS of vegetable oil in a medium sized pot for 5 minutes on high.<br /><br />Pour in 1/2 cup of popcorn kernels and leave uncovered.  As soon as the first kernel pops, put the lid on crooked to let the steam escape.<br /><br />Note: If your popcorn rises too high and is close to touching the bottom of the lid (use a clear lid) then remove the lid. Do not let the popcorn touch the moisture that accumulates on the bottom of the lid. It will ruin all those pieces.<br /><br />When finished popping (about 1 second in between pops), pour popcorn into a large bowl and place the empty pot back on the burner (now turned off).<br /><br />Add 1 TBS of unsalted butter (cut into small squares) into the pot you just cooked your popcorn in. Hold the pot and angle it so that the butter just stays on one side of the pot. If there are any remaining bits of popcorn in the pot, use your butter knife to knock them down into the melted butter. These are great little nuggets of joy while eating the popcorn!<br /><br />Slowly pour half of the butter over the popcorn in a circular fashion, starting at the center and working your way outward to the edge of the bowl. You want to pour a little more butter around the center and less around the edges, since the center of the bowl is the deepest. Sprinkle salt (1/2 the amount you would use) over the top. Use your butter knife and your opposite hand together to lightly toss the popcorn.<br /><br />Note: It is important to salt your popcorn after you pour the butter and before tossing, because the salt will stick better to the popcorn.<br /><br />Pour the other half of the melted butter over the popcorn. Sprinkle the other half of salt over your popcorn.  Lightly toss again.  Taste it.  Add salt if necessary.  Eat right away.<br /><br />Note: If you like your popcorn more buttery and/or oily, add 1/2 to 1 TBS of each to the recipe.

review/summary: Movie theatre popcorn from the microwave at home!
review/text: I looked at the old fashioned pop corn poppers (you know, the red cart and metal popper), but those looked like they would be a lot of work to keep clean as well as take up counter space I don't have. However, I still really wanted "movie theater" or "carnival/fair" popcorn. So I got the Presto popcorn popper that goes in the microwave and works either with or without oil. If you get the 2.5oz size pack of Northern popcorn, you can easily split it in half and make 2 batches. (The Presto popper is too small for a 2.5oz pkg all at once.) This stuff tastes great. Yeah, I know palm oil is horrible for your heart etc. etc., but THAT is what makes all that fake buttery taste so yummy. Like another reviewer said, the salt packet is a quite salty so I only used half (maybe even less) the salt for all of the popcorn in each packet. After looking at several online distributors, at $18.95 (subscription price) Amazon has the best price. 4 1/2 stars

review/summary: Perfect movie night popcorn
review/text: WOW.  This popcorn is delicious.  We purchased a large 4oz popcorn machine for our game room family movie nights.  When it first arrived, I wanted to try it immediately.  So, I bought some Orville's at the store and I was disappointed with both the number of popped kernels and the taste.  After the Great Northern popcorn arrived, I was immediately hooked on the flavor and ease of use.  The packages are easy to use and the product tastes great.  Our family only uses about half of the salt flavoring and can not tell a difference in quality of the taste.  My son says it tastes better than at the movies.  Now when we go out to see a movie, we keep the popcorn bag and replicate the experience at home!

review/text: When I read about Great Northern Popcorn packs, I was skeptical.  I thought it was just another gimmick to get me to buy everything prepackaged at a premium price.  After all, popcorn is all the same, right?  My wife insisted that we try it and I am glad we did.  If you love movie theater popcorn, this will be the closest you will get to making it at home.  I tried others and they just do not compare.  I am not sure if it is the type of oil they use, the type of salt, or the popcorn itself, but this popcorn is second to none.  Also, everything is conveniently measured out for you, so this makes the task of making popcorn so much simpler.  If you try it, you may be surprised how much more popcorn you start to eat!
