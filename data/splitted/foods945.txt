review/summary: Decent white whine - lousy Riesling
review/text: I am not a white wine expert but I make plenty of wine.  I enjoy a nice Riesling during the hot summer weather but this one will not qualify.  Don't get me wrong, it is a decent and enjoyable white wine.  Nothing special but enjoyable.  I suspect this will make some white wine slushies and white sangria this summer.  My kids will like it so it will certainly not go to waste.  Buy it for an OK white wine but not for a Riesling.

review/summary: Vino Italiano Riesling
review/text: I made this kit earlier in the year and all my friends enjoyed it during the summer months.  It is real easy to make and you can tweak the recipe as you wish.  I added some golden raisins during the second fermentation and back-sweetened with 215 grams of dextrose which gave it a medium dry taste.  It takes a couple of months to get over the awkward bottled stage so don't rush it, it does get better with age.  I started mine in February and it didn't hit it's stride until August-September.

review/summary: Nice.
review/text: This was my first attempt at wine-making but had previous experience with home-brewing.  I found the instructions to be easy to follow.  Like other reviewers, I made the wine to an SG rather than to 6 gallons, which came up to about 5.5 gallons.  Like one of the other reviews I read, I found that the wine did have a slight bitter taste when we tried our initial bottle, but once we gave it a few more weeks to mature, it sweetened slightly and the after-taste disappeared.  We have shared this with several of our friends and have had very favorable comments.  I'm very happy with kit and am looking into other varieties from Vino Itialiano.

review/summary: Top Notch Wine Kit
review/text: This product arrived perfectly and is a super easy wine kit to make. Completely dummy proof as long as you already have all of the equipment. I've already tasted it and it tastes just like any other Riesling. I should get 16 or so 1.5L bottles. Not bad for just over $40. That's roughly $2.50 per bottle. It's way better than the cheapest stuff you can buy in the store, trust me...

review/text: It is always such a hassle trying to get fresh poppy seeds for our European recipes in special days. A few stores carry them where I live, but never as fresh as the ones I got from Amazon!<br />The package might be a little too big if you don't bake a lot, but they freeze very well, just the way they come packed and from the freezer to use, it takes just a few minutes.<br />And the price at Amazon is better than ALL the local places.

review/text: My family loves poppy seed bread and I must say that these poppy seeds have the best flavor and they are so fresh. I keep one package in the refrigerator to use and store the rest in the freezer for later. I originally bought them to save money. The little jars you buy in the store are extremely expensive and you only get two loaves of bread out of them. I would definitly recommend buying these.

review/summary: Dependable brand!
review/text: To start with, Bob's Red Mill is a great brand in general! They have reliable, good quality items. I love their oatmeal and selection of gluten-free items. They rock!<br />They are not certified organic, thank goodness because they're expensive enough, but they are the closest to good quality/natural, organic without being organic.<br /><br />They are a little on the expensive side but these seeds are worth it. They are very consistent (more so than Frontier brand). The flavour is normal (good) as far as poppy seeds go.<br />You can see in most bags, I've noticed, pieces of pod etc. So just beware of that if you are cooking, I don't think eating a bit of pod or stem ever hurt anyone though.<br />Using a lot of seeds at once I recommend these over Frontier (any day), based on the flavor(though some like Frontier, it now freaks me out).<br />I haven't received any, ever, that seem to be stale or old.<br />Might want to refrigerate what's left though in a zip/lock air-tight container to keep fresh.<br /><br />They also come with a Lemon Poppy Seed Cookie recipe on the back! (Same on each package though)

review/summary: Funky smell, good taste
review/text: I was disappointed when I opened the first bag as there is a strong rancid like smell. I looked at the expiration date, and it supposed to last until 2014. I opened a second bag, and the smell seems to be rancid as well, but somewhat less. I opened the second one thinking that maybe, it is just one bag, and I didn't want to deal with the hassle of returning it. Now, I did not use poppy seeds for baking ever, and I'm trying to figure out if these seeds developed the rancidity because of the packaging or are they supposed to smell funky? I bought flour from the same brand, and it was excellent. Did someone have the same experience?

review/summary: Catnip Garden
review/text: This catnip is very easy to grow and the cats love it.  I simply sprinkled the seeds in the garden and kept them well-watered during the current drought and they produced very bushy and healthy plants. I pick a leaf off of the plant for each cat, wash the leaf thoroughly, and the cats immediately run to the door to meet me when I bring in the leaves!  They eat them whole and fresh.  I am going to dry some for this winter.  Growing this treat for the cats saves a lot of money, and anyone who buys the dried stuff and pays the market's price knows how expensive that can be!  Just be sure to wash the leaves off.  You never know whats been running around the garden at night and you do want to keep the cats healthy!  I am going to harvest seeds to grow in a pot on the windowsill and try that next.  Definitely worth the price and effort.

review/summary: Would be 5 stars if not a product of China?
review/text: First off don't be scared by the "Product of China" label..  The duck used comes from a breed of domesticated duck used primarily for egg and meat production. It was bred from the Mallard in China.<br /><br />  Yes America produces Pekin Duck too, but have not done a good job at dehydrating the meats in bulk for jerky uses, only for culinary usage and it usually isn't cheap or easy to find.<br /><br />95% of duck meat consumed in the United States is Pekin duck, and who knows what percentage of that is actually our own US product.<br /><br />  Our friendly Asian brothers have been farming Pekin Duck since the days of the 5 Dynasty, that's about 1100yrs ago or so.<br /><br /> In 1873 nine ducks were exported from China to Long Island, New York and there are currently from what I can see only a couple of towns in Indiana that handle that predominantly for the US markets.<br /><br />Not all dogs are meant to handle waterfowl, but if they do and you don't like this product then go get a hunting license to make your own duck jerky.

review/text: First Impression: Natural Balance Dog Food Rolls are like puppy crack. Dad buys the roll and cuts it up into finger sized pieces. Then he uses his Food Saver to vacuum seal the left over pieces of the roll. When Dad trains me, he uses pieces of the roll as treats. He keeps them in a ziploc bag in his pocket when we go on walks. I didn't like the Turkey flavor as much; they were drier and less tasty. I would recommend the Natural Balance Dog Food Roll Lamb Formula to any Rottweiler, but I won't share mine.<br /><br />Conclusion: Absolutely the best training treat I've ever had! Liver treats are good, but they can be too rich and upset my stomach. Plus dad says these are WAY cheaper than the liver treats.

When the Koo Guavas arrived, I tried them and it brought me right back to when I lived in New Zealand.  They are fantastic and I highly recommend them to anyone.  They are pricey, but well worth the cost.  I only wish that I could purchase them in the supermarkets here in Texas.

review/summary: Reminds me of my Childhood
review/text: I grew up in Africa where you could pick guavas right off a tree while you were on vacation. Well that is where I first tasted guavas. My dad boiled them in a sugar syrup and we served them with custard. The Koo guavas have been a favorite since I moved back to the States. I keep buying this brand and love the flavor. While these are not as delicious as fresh quavas they are a close second.

review/summary: Tastes Like a Hay Bale, but that's okay :)
review/text: While amazingly nutritious, this powder does taste like a fresh bale of alfalfa hay smells - slightly sweet and like a barn. I found just mixing it with water, that it was pretty hard to get down unless diluted heavily and ice cold. However, I was not used to drinking wheat grass juice or any other grass-based drinks. BUT ... once I mixed it in with a simple smoothie of banana, ice, Greek yogurt and raw honey, it was very tasty. The fruit masks the grassy taste. It would probably do well mixed in with a Green Machine juicing recipe or another favorite recipe for your juicer with lemon juice and ginger to cut the grassy taste. I would buy it again. :)

review/text: This was my first purchase of any kind of green superfood drink. It doesn't taste great without fruits or juice. I purchased the green tea energy flavor from Amazing grass and it tasted better with or without juices or fruits. The two orders i placed from one of the amazon sellers, had an expiration date of 2 months from the date i received it... I placed my next order directly from Amazing grass and the expiration date was over a year.

review/summary: Itchy skin rashes in some parts of my body
review/text: I have been taking this product for two months now but for some reason,the last 2 weeks, itchy skin rashes have manifested in some parts of my body. I stopped taking green superfood for a week and my skin rashes have diminished.<br />I resumed taking the product again but skin rashes came back again. Definitely, the cause of my skin disease is this<br />product. For other people, this product may have worked but not for me.<br /><br />My friend has recommended new probiotic supplement. He said, the supplement is very potent, everytime you take one capsule, it is equivalent to 24 servings of average yogurt. If anyone is curious, you can search  Regenesis Probiotic supplement on Amazon and check out for yourself..

review/summary: bad reaction
review/text: I bought this product on the strength of the reviews but after one or two days of taking it I had a bad reaction to it including dizziness and the onset of depression and anxiety. Someone mentioned that Maca is a strong her and made their heart race a little after taking it. Another person said their skin broke out in a rash. Yet another reviewer mentioned Alphalpha- which this product has and which is meant to be bad for some reason (I'll do the research later) My only interpretation personally for me as to why my body reacted to it is the chemical additives e.g silica which is a well known neurotoxin. I have a very sensitive central nervous system and thought I would take this to get essential nutrients. But I think the multiple combinations and the large quantities of each herb/veg was just too much. I have since binned it and I'm scared to ever try it again. Since then I've bought a juicer and juice cabbage, cucumber, carrots, celery and other veg everyday and that's worked out much better for me in terms of boosting my energy, memory and concentration than this nightmare powder did.

review/summary: What a great find!
review/text: I absolutely love Amazon and practically 'hang out' on Amazon like some people do on Facebook - LOL! That being said, I really enjoy reading the reviews and the comments of fellow Amazoners and learn so much by doing so. I really appreciate the information that other reviewers include and when I have found a particular reviewer that I recognize over and over again, I have clicked on their profile to read more about them and about what other items they have reviewed and BOY has that been fun!<br /><br />And that is precisely how I stumbled upon this Amazing Grass Green Superfood mix!<br />I was reading the profile of another reader and she raved about it. Well, any time I am out of my green powder, I order a different brand. This way, I am always using a different product and can try them all out and see which one I really do like the best and will stay with. As timing would have it, I was almost out of the one I was using, and saw this review, and ordered it!<br /><br />I signed up for the Auto-delivery (as you can cancel at any time) and it reduced the price as well as free shipping - yay! But, the real test was in the flavor, and it's blendability (new word?). It shakes up well (shake, not stir), and the taste is pretty good. I add it to smoothies, or drink plain in water or juice and like it either way. It seems to be economically doable for me, possibly lasting 60 days, so that is a better deal than most out there.<br /><br />I felt better immediately after drinking it - with more energy - probably due to the Maca. Maca is something you want to research before taking, and certainly before ever giving to children. I have some Maca in a bag, and when I have added only a tiny bit of it to a smoothie - I didn't like the way it made me feel at all, and it made my heart go a little crazy, so IMO, be cautious.<br />This, however, gave me a burst of good-feeling energy without the heart palpitations of other ill-effects, so I was happy.<br /><br />All in all, I think I have found my favorite green drink so I'm sticking with it and if I have any other opinions, I'll update my review.<br />I think you'll like it too!

review/text: I've been using green drinks for over 6 years now.  I gave this one a try because of the ingredients.  It's comparable to some other green drinks.<br /><br />After drinking it for two days, I've felt a ton of more energy and no crashing. That never happened with my other green drinks. The taste is grassy, slightly minty and powdery.<br /><br />They recommend using 6 oz of water, but I have to dilute it with 24 oz to be drinkable.  Otherwise, it's just too much at one time.<br /><br />Overall, if you're interested in a great green drink at a reasonable price, you can't go wrong with this one.

I've found that 4-5 cubes of ice, a banana, bout 1/4 cup of apple sauce, a scoop of this stuff and a shot of sugar free chocolate syrup and you don't even know it's in there. On it's own though this stuff tastes like grass clippings.<br /><br />If you want something with less sugar juice 1 cucumber, about a pound of carrots, an apple or a pear and 1 scoop of this stuff. Tastes great over ice. I do the shake in the morning and the juice after dinner like clockwork.

review/summary: Acquired taste
review/text: This wasn't as bad as expected! It smelled awful and looked like swamp sludge so I expected the worst as I took a sip. Surprisingly, it wasn't bad at all! The more I drank it, the tastier it got. It is reminiscent of Chinese herbal medicine (which is not an appealing taste to most people, but really, you learn to like it).<br /><br />As for the health benefits, I can't just say "Oh I felt energized immediately after drinking it." I'm not sure if I felt anything. But this was my first cup, I'll have to edit in a few weeks or months! As for fullness, it was too thin to make me feel full. I guess if you mixed it with fruits and veggies and maybe some protein powder it would keep you full.<br /><br />All in all, I'm super pleased and will definitely buy again. Furthermore, this is an amazing price!!! It's 30% cheaper than what it would be outside of Amazon.<br /><br />EDIT: After taking this product for a couple of weeks, I can safely say that it is still amazing! It blunts my appetite tremendously, and I always feel lighter and more energized after having a cup or two of this stuff. My bowels have been awesome and my cravings for bad foods have gone away. I drink this every time I get tempted to eat something unhealthy and it works to keep me away! Heh.

review/summary: Amazing Grass Works!
review/text: This is a good product.  I use once every day although you can use up to three times a day.  It gives you energy - very noticeable boost when you first start using it, not as obvious after a while - BUT, if I don't use it, I notice the difference in my energy level.  On the weekends when I want to stay up late, I mix up a glass and I'm good to go for a couple of hours more; however, I can still sleep if I want to.  I have a really sensitive system and typically "energy" stuff makes me jittery or nauseaus, but this stuff isn't like that at all.  Just a good, solid, healthy, energetic feeling.  It looks awful but it tastes good.  I mix it with Simply Orange, pulp-free orange juice (I like pulp but the grass sticks to the pulp and doesn't mix as well) and it tastes great.  My friend mixes it with vanilla soy milk and loves it.

review/summary: My daily supplements..
review/text: This is one of the best products in the array of "greens" out on the market.  The taste is most definitely one of the best.  Green Superfood is a great addition to a balanced alkaline/acid diet.  When my body is overly acidic (which is obvious when my stomach or body is sluggish or feeling like I'm coming down with something), I make a shake and it helps to balance it out.  I used to add a few items to the mix to make it even more powerful, i.e. fresh kale, banana, aloe, and flax oil.  Nowadays I simply use a frozen half banana, flax oil, and a touch of carob powder.  Mix it up with a bit of ice and you have a great shake, especially good during the summer months.  And for some crazy ideas, especially during the really hot months, add a bit of Baileys or Kahlua to the mix.  Yum, yum!  It's like having your vegetables with your junk food.  Or maybe try adding some Breyer's Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream and present it to the kids (sans the liquor, of course).  There is a kids version of this product, also.  Both an adult version and the kids version come in chocolate, but I like making that decision for myself, so I buy the plain.  This is a great way to get your vits/minerals in a powdered, raw food product.  It's gluten free, vegan, and no soy fillers.  Also, 70% organic.  You would have to eat a truck load of raw foods to get the same level of nutrients that you receive in one scoop of Amazing Grass Green SuperFood.  And no, I do not work for the company.

review/summary: full of nutrients, not full of taste
review/text: I was not expecting this to taste like a milk shake by all means, but the taste was pretty tough to take. I purchased this for its nutritional value. Based on others reviews mentioning that it did not taste good, I understood it may not taste the best. I thought - oh I can handle it not a big deal. I was wrong. In order for me to drink it I had to put a scoop of it in very hot water in a cup with a lid, shake it up, then drink it as though it was a tea. It definitely has a strong grassy taste  to it and you really have to taste for any hint of berry in it.<br /><br />I am giving this product a 3 for the taste. I will say that I did notice an increase in my energy level from drinking it though in comparison to other green super food supplements I've taken. If you can stand drinking grass, and getting a decent energy booste, I'd say this one is for you. If you are expecting this to taste like berries with a hint of grass in it, this product is not for you.

review/text: This has been a great find.  Recommended to me by a friend.  It has given my husband and I noticeably more energy.  We have been drinking a scoop full in about 8 oz of juice/smoothie/whatever 2-3X a day for two weeks now.  Sure, there is some grit when mixing, and it does take a good stir to get it mixed.  I have a tiny whisk I use for just juice or water and it mixes it well.  We like it in OJ in the morning (it isn't pretty to look at, but just start drinking and its pretty good, and its good for you!) We think it tastes pretty good, considering its contents.  We are new parents, not health junkies by any means.  Early 30's, working full time, not exercising enough and this helps us get back some of the energy we need without extra caffeine or mid-day crash, and helps us hit the veggie count we want for a better diet.  No noticeable side effects-- no gas or stomach issues.  I am glad we found it.

review/summary: Amazing Product!
review/text: I probably sound like a late night infomercial, but I've honestly had amazing results with this SuperFood and I love it!<br /><br />I already live a fairly healthy lifestyle to begin with, but found myself dragging physically and mentally and didn't have that second or third gear that I used to. My acupuncturist recommended taking wheat grass powder to increase my alkalinity and I bought this SuperFood by accident. I decided to use it anyway and I'm extremely happy that I did. After the first scoop I could feel an immediate change in my energy levels. It's not like a caffeine rush, but more like a sustained level of energy and alertness. It's most noticeable for me at the gym as I have a lot more strength and stamina when I'm working out. Another plus is that I have a much more consistent appetite than before. That's a good thing for me and I definitely feel the urge to eat more than I used to...maybe the cleansing effect of all of the extra fiber? I also sleep better too even with the extra energy.<br /><br />I do two scoops with 25oz of water in the morning and two scoops with dinner. The packaging recommends 1-3 per day. You can mix it with shakes, juice, etc, but I don't mind the Earthy flavor. The powder doesn't dissolve entirely so I suggest getting a Blender Bottle so you constantly mix it. It's also convenient for when you're on the go...throw in scoop or two, add water and you're out the door.<br /><br />I really can't recommend this product enough, but please don't think that this is some cure-all if you plan to eat junk food, smoke, drink a lot, etc. However, if you're trying to live healthy and want to improve your energy levels then this is definitely worth giving a try.

review/summary: Wonderful additive for a healthier me
review/text: I wanted to continue taking a superfood green mix however could not continue spending what I was so on another product, so I researched an alternative. My research led me to Amazing Grass Green Superfood. I love that it is organic and love that it has Maca in it as well. I find that it tastes best with OJ. I also had trouble mixing this to the point of zero clumps. I discovered the perfect way to enjoy this delicious addition to my day and I want to share it with all of you. First, put one scoop in your glass. Then, add just enough of your liquid, I suggest OJ, to cover the powder in the glass. Then, with a knife, stir the mixture so it makes somewhat of a "wasabi/soy" consistency. You want a pasty texture and make sure to mix around the edge of the glass with the knife. Then, pour the rest of your desired amount of liquid on top and mix once more. It ends of perfectly mixed with no clumps. I also want to add that I am a breastfeeding mom. This product does not contain parsley. Many of the other products do. While parsley has wonderful health benefits, I have read it is not recommended for breastfeeding mothers. I hope this is helpful and you should definitely buy this product.

review/summary: A boost of health in a bottle
review/text: I previously wrote a review for the smaller, 8.5oz version of this supplement powder, which is the exact same product but costs slightly more. When I finished the smaller one in 2 months I got this one because the shelf-life is around 2 years, depending on when you buy it (both my purchases had August 2013 as the expiration date). Per my last review:<br /><br />This is very healthy stuff. I don't eat as much vegetables as I should, but this helps balance my diet with the chock-full of nutrients it provides. The most appealing benefits to me are 100% DV vitamin A as beta carotene, powerful antioxidant blend, and probiotic active cultures like those in in yogurt.<br /><br />The aroma is pleasant and so is the taste, but the solubility is difficult. Since it contains insoluble fiber, it doesn't dissolve completely with water or juice. Smoothies are best for this mix. I tried cold water and hot water, and its quite gritty in both --not sand-like mind you, but sort of like not completely mixing cocoa powder and trying to drink it. Speaking of which, for some odd reason the taste and aroma reminds me of hot cocoa. After discovering hot water doesnt help dissolve everything, I wouldn't recommend it since heat can diminish a lot of the nutrient power this mix provides, especially the antioxidants.<br /><br />Per the label, it is best kept frozen or refrigerated after opening.<br /><br />UPDATE 12/10/2011 ***********<br />I find that I like the taste when it is mixed with vanilla-flavored soymilk. One way I use the mix is to add flavor to my high-fiber cereal and soymilk, which looks gross since your milk turns green, but at least the gritty bits are masked by the cereal and dont bother me one bit (pun?).<br /><br />UPDATE 1/20/2012 ************<br />I'm really enjoying this supplement powder! I can sense myself feeling better throughout the day. Since I take this supplement first thing every morning, I have become more regular in my bowel movements (almost clockwork) and noticed good changes in my stool, defecating clean and easy. At first, I was very gaseous as my body tried to get accustom to the high volume of fiber in my supplemented diet. But after a couple days the flatulence subsided, and I was reaping the benefits of fiber without the sound effects (which by the way did not smell... at least to me =P ).<br /><br />UPDATE 2/2/2012 ************<br />I noticed that there is another size available for this Green Superfood (17oz vs 8.5oz) for a cheaper price per ounce value. Just to let you guys know, I bought this one back in November 2011 and the expiration date for my container says August 2013. Thats nearly a 2-year shelf life! But I think they are referring to the shelf that is in your refigerator, rather than your cupboard.<br /><br />UPDATE 2/24/2012 ************<br />I've been taking this every weekday at work, one scoop every morning with my cereal. Finally finished the container roughly in two months. As I try to reflect on any long term changes, I do notice that I wake up easier for work, which is at 4:00 AM every morning. I try to get at least 7 hours of sleep, but most of the time I fall asleep between 10:00-11:00 PM, and surprisingly I'm still mentally awake until that time.

review/summary: I just started using Amazing Grass Green SuperFood
review/text: I have instantly noticed an increase in my energy and overall well being.  This makes it so convenient to get your greens regularly.  I've made it my first drink of the day with my green tea, it gives me steady energy & curbs my appetite.  The day before I started using this, I was starting to catch a cold, the next morning I drank this and I felt like my immune system got an immediate boost and I was fine by later that day and the cold never settled in.  The taste is very mild so you can add it to your protein shake or drink with water by itself.  I put it in the blender for 5 seconds and it's easy to drink.<br /><br />So far I like this product and will continue reordering.

review/summary: I think its a cheap insurance to good health
review/text: I think the berry flavor is far better than the veggie powder as far as taste goes but I don't mind either one. The nutrition seems the same for either the veggie or the fruit so I would experiement with all of them with flavor.  I add this to some juice, kefir, some coconut oil whatever, but I always add stevia with it.  I think this is a very cheap insurance to staying or getting healthy.  I battled with my health my whole life.  I try now to stay as natural as I can with my health care now.  It leads me to `well' a lot quicker. I was one of those DES babies you may or may not have heard about.  Our mothers took DES which was a drug to prevent a miscarriage but what happened was it caused problems with the baby and left a compromised immune system.  This is why my whole life it has been one thing after another.  Well, THIS powder is fantastic.  When I take this consistently I have far more energy and I just seem to stay well.  When I get lazy about it and stop taking it I have no energy, I get foggy brained, down in the dumps.  Big difference. I figure if I take this in the morning, the rest of the day is covered as far as my fruits and veggies are concerned.  What I do eat on top of this is a bonus!  If you `really' really can't stand the taste then add the stevia, add fruit, juice whatever, it so worth taking this powder!!  Personally I have no problem with the flavor. I have the super foods on auto-ship.  That is a great program to save money when you know you will use the product all the time.  I like that you can cancel anytime if you want to.  Five starts from me!

review/summary: Not Bad
review/text: I must admit, I was a bit turned-off by it initially. I don't recommend trying it in water for the first taste, no matter how curious you are. It works great in juices, go for the thicker ones as the mix floats to the top quite quickly in thinner juices, even when using an immersion blender. I've been drinking it daily for about 3 weeks now, and I actually find myself craving the taste if I forgot to drink it that day. And as others have stated, I do notice a difference in my energy levels towards the end of the day. This product isn't an instant energy boost, but provides sustained energy throughout the day. I highly recommend it, especially to get a few extra servings of veggies in one's diet. I'm thinking of trying the berry one next, just to see if it's any different/tastier

review/summary: Too much iron
review/text: I took this product in my iced tea every day after eating something (without eating something first, I got a bad stomach ache and nausea) and the taste was very palatable (with three packets of Stevia in the tea to kind of cover the veggie taste).  After almost two weeks, I noticed I was extremely lethargic - even after ten to twelve hours of sleep - and couldn't think clearly.  I had completely forgotten that years ago I had these same symptoms due to taking a multivitamin with iron in it.  Blood tests at the time showed I had way too much iron in my blood.  I didn't think the 10% iron in this product would bother me but it did.  I stopped taking it a week ago and I guess will just ride things out until my blood levels normalize. I gave the product a high rating because its not the product's fault that I wasn't paying attention to the iron level within it.  If my system didn't retain so much iron, this product would probably have really helped me!

However, if you aren't afraid of veggies and unprocessed crap, then the taste is just fine.<br /><br />I love the stuff!

review/text: I have to order more of this stuff. I've almost finished my first canister. Bottom line with this, it makes me feel good... and it keeps me regular. The taste is good. I have it with orange juice or just with water. Either way tastes great. Of course, it is more filling with orange juice. It is actually lick-your-lips good with orange juice. I mix it with about 4 oz juice or water. I was only taking it once a day. Now I've moved up to twice a day... first thing in the morning and in the late afternoon when I get home from work, I take a "shot" before I workout for a nice energy boost. It has become a very good habit.

review/summary: Loves it!  Nutritious and Delicious Goodness....for greens :)
review/text: I love this stuff! The first few times I took it, I noticed that later on in the day I felt that I had more energy. I had forgotten that I had taken it and was wondering why I felt better on those days. The only difference that I recalled is that I took the greens earlier that day. I have been using this product for over 2 months now and I now generally feel better. This was an added bonus to me because my reason for buying this product is that I wanted to do something more for my health for the long term benefits. I think this stuff is truly amazing because it has so many health benefits and it so much easier than eating (or juicing) the recommended 5-9 servings of fruits and veggies a day. And for greens, yes, it tastes excellent especially if you mix it with juice. My favorite juice to mix it with is the V8 splash berry blend -Yummy (with crushed ice and a straw :). I'll normally water it down for me and other members of the family just to cut a few calories but for others that really want to mask the "green flavor", I will serve it to them without watering it down. Hope this helps. Cheers!

review/text: I am new to the Superfood concept, and this is one of the first products I've tried.  It is excellent!  It mixes well with anything I happen to dream up, and I found it easy to substute entire meals with my gree smoothies.  I usually start with some organic tea, add ice cubes, Superfood,  then my "special" juices.  I vary between Acai, Mangosteen, and Noni.  And then I also add protiem powder, because I've found that my energy level takes a big dip if I don't suppliment all the green stuff with some protien.  Sometimes I put in a bit of plain yogurt and honey to smoothe it out a bit, but it's not necessary.  I find that I'm sipping on my "green shakes" all day long.  Great stuff!

review/summary: Great With Orange Juice!
review/text: TASTE:<br />Ok, so with just water this stuff straight up tastes like rabbit food (no, I have never tasted it but I have smelled it). I didn't know how I was going to stomach this whole tub, even though the ingredients are incredible. I thought I was going to have to revert back to my 7 year old self and each the veggies not because they taste good, but because they're good for you.<br /><br />Lucky for me, I tried mixing it with orange juice and it's 10x better. After just tasting the rabbit food version it makes the orange juice mix taste like bliss. Granted, I'm sure it still tastes like rabbit food and not like the tastiest thing in the world but it's really not bad at all. I was thinking of trying the chocolate version next time but I'm actually enjoying this original now!<br /><br />RESULTS:<br />I just started on this regimen and I already feel so much more energy! I'm an elementary teacher and usually come home and not want to move until the next morning but now I feel ready to take on the world (think Mother Theresa meets Hope Solo). I didn't even look at the advertised energy benefits until now so I'm pretty sure it's not a placebo. It's hard for me to fit in enough fruits/veggies for the day so this makes it a bit easier. If I see any more benefits as I continue on this journey I will make sure to edit!

review/summary: A great choice for an organic supplement
review/text: I'm a long-time and fairly diligent vegetarian.  I probably do not require much if any of the supplements in this mix, but a little extra(and this mix will not overload you with potentially unhealthy non-soluble vitamins like certain pills might), is probably beneficial.  I do not normally use much if any acai, goji or seaweed related nutrients in cooking or smoothies, so I appreciate that some of those are in this mix as well.<br /><br />The mix is 100% vegan and organic, and my impression is that the ingredients are ethically sourced which is important to me. . .some are even grown stateside.  I believe this company sources its organic wheatgrass, for example, from Kansas.<br /><br />On the downside, the apparent quality and organic nature of the ingredients lead to a somewhat costly mix, and the 60 servings in this particular size will go fairly quickly if you rely on this as a central supplement in your diet.  Also, while some vegetarians and healthy eaters might enjoy the taste of this item by itself in water or some other mix - taste is largely learned, and if you are just starting to transition to a healthier diet from a more traditional diet this item is likely going to taste strange and potentially unappealing.  I recommend adding it to a pre-existing smoothie recipe (probably the best option for new healthy eaters - but make sure your smoothie is healthy too, or you are defeating the purpose) or sprinkling it on some other foodstuff.  Do not cook it into foods though, or you will lose many of the nutrients.  Also, refrigeration is recommended.  I do not even notice the taste when it is added to something else.  By itself, it would no doubt be distinctive.  I do not know why this company is advertising this particular blend as great tasting on its own - that is not a good approach for a mix of this kind.  On the other hand, this company does carry a berry and chocolate flavored blend (and the flavorings truly appear to be "natural") that may prove more palatable to those with pickier taste buds who just want to mix it in water, soymilk or some other beverage.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: Great Product. Would higly recommend. Excellent value for the price paid. Good tasting. The enzymes in this product really help with the digestion and processing of food. I was looking for a really good "Green" drink and have found it in Amazing Grass.

review/summary: great supplement for breakfdast shakes
review/text: Even my little 2-lb dog loves it mixed with vegan mayonnaise.  Mixes great in my protein-fruuit shake and tastes good also.  I expected to have more of a strong wheatgrass taste.  It taste green but a good green.  I definitely am going to purchase more.

review/summary: taste is extremely unpalatable...
review/text: I haven't been taking this supplement long enough to confidently say that it's made a huge difference in my energy level but I haven't seen any negative side effects so I've continued with it hoping to see a difference soon. However, one thing I CAN confidently say about it is that the taste is so unappetizing that I have a hard time drinking it. There's a cloying sweetness to it that is reminiscent of cherry flavored cough syrup, only it's green and in powder form...

review/summary: Amazing Grass How Sweet The Sound!
review/text: When I first ordered Amazing Grass, I did so because of all the rave reviews, (5 stars) on Amazon. Since I didn't know how it would work for me, I delayed a review of my own until now.<br /><br />I have to say the effects have been nothing short of Amazing for me! My sense of well being has increased dramatically, I sleep so soundly now it is almost unbelievable!<br /><br />My energy level has increased and my BM is now regular, with complete evacuation!<br /><br />I ordered my first 17 oz. container mid June, 2012 And Since Then Have ordered 2 more for a total of 3 in a 2 month period.<br /><br />I am on auto ship as that is the best price available on Amazon.<br /><br />Amazing Grass, Amazing!<br /><br />I Appreciate it when others rate products, so I hope this helps you.<br /><br />David In Honolulu, Hawaii.

review/summary: Great mixed with juice!
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised with this powder! I read many reviews that said it was gross and what not, but I mix a scoopful with a tall glass of apple juice or orange juice and it is honestly not bad. I'm a picky eater, and a vegan so I struggle with getting enough greens in my diet, but this has been a life send! The only part that takes getting used to is the texture. No matter how much you stir it with the juice, it's gonna be gritty lol. I just chug the glass and it makes it more bearable lol.

review/text: LOVE the product. GREAT price. This is my 4th container of the amazing RAW GREEN food. I also give this to my "dogs" who I call my Girls / 4 footed children. They go nuts trying to get to the plate when I am mixing it into a small portion of wet dog food. It certainly can only help all of us. I use the Chocolate & or Orange......YUMMY, mix it with Almond MilK & it is just like a milk shake! I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in improving their overall internal health.

review/text: The product is great! I'm currently deployed and was looking for a vegetable supplement, given we dont have access to fresh fruit/veggies all the time. I love this product, though at first I wasn't too keen on the taste, but it's so neutral you get over it quickly. The alkalinity is awesome too! It will always settle my stomach, and feels good after I take it! I will definitely continue to order this product! I highly recommend it soldiers in field environment, it's highly nutritious and mobile....

review/summary: Good, Healthy Addition
review/text: I bought a canister of this product to supplement my daily protein smoothies (usually consisting of non-fat plain kefir, unsweetened vanilla almond milk, high quality whey protein isolate, coconut oil, cinnamon, a bit of liquid stevia and a handful of frozen berries/ice cubes) since I don't get as many "greens" into my system as I should. I find the the taste bearable when added to smoothies - adds a sort of "earthy" flavor, but doesn't overwhelm the general deliciousness of the other ingredients at all. I've never tasted the powder mixed with only water; based on the distinctive aroma emanating from the canister, I'm quite sure I'm not missing out. Bottom line, I like the list of ingredients and it's easy for me to incorporate. The product is pricey, but worth the health benefits, in my opinion. To the reviewers mentioning how nasty this product tastes - maybe try it in a smoothie? It's not a Snickers bar; based on the contents alone, I had a pretty good idea that I'd have to mask the taste somehow!

review/summary: Helps With My Quest To Eating Healthy!
review/text: I have been drinking this for over 6 months now and really do love it.  I do not like drinking it in plain water, though.  Instead, I mix one scoop of this with 6 to 8 ounces of Jumex or Kerns guava nectar and it really tastes good like that! I have tried just about every kind of juice with this stuff and have come to the conclusion that The guava tastes the best with it.  I also add a tablespoon of melted coconut oil that I take to help control cholesterol among other benefits, and a tablespoon of ground flaxseed.  I drink this two times a day. I also take my vitamins with this concoction and it helps me to not get a sick feeling that I sometimes get when taking pills.  It looks really yucky and my kids avoid coming in the kitchen when I am drinking this but I feel so much healthier and have so much more energy.  Plus, I feel great that I am able to incorporate so many great things into my diet in less than a few minutes a day! After six months of this ritual I have experienced better health, better weight management, higher energy levels and healthier skin, hair and nails.

review/summary: Mixes well with vegetable juice
review/text: This is my favorite green powder supplement.  It's mild and quite delicious, especially when mixed with my daily celery-carrot-cucumber-apple-beet juice combo.  It dissolves well (it's not so fine that it is clumpy, like many other green powders), though you will have to stir the drink occasionally, otherwise some will settle at the bottom of the glass.  I haven't tried mixing with just water, nor would I want to.  I like how it is a combination of different greens, as each one has its own unique beneficial properties.  Good price, especially considering that you will get many servings out it.  Like all green powders, it is a highly convenient way to get your greens in each day.  I store it refrigerated and it doesn't spoil.

review/summary: Great Green Powder
review/text: This is a great product, for the price here on Amazon.com - Green drinks contain Chlorophyll, which detoxifies and alkalizes the body.  Fruits and vegetables can each contain hundreds of phytochemicals and phytonutrients, which can help rejuvenate cells and repair DNA and prevent chronic illnesses.  Combinations of various green foods and fruits have a synergistic effect and complement the helpful effects of each other. In recent years there are more and more books and articles explaining how diet affects our DNA, and the importance of fruits and vegetables for preventing and reversing illnesses.

review/summary: Disappointed!
review/text: I normally don't write reviews, but do read them because I value others opinions.<br /><br />This product was pretty consistently recommended, and I have a different view and felt like others might like to know it.<br /><br />I am a pretty avid Greens First user, but I am also open to trying other products that have the same benefits at a cost savings, and so that is what I was looking for.<br /><br />Overall, the product is okay and comparable in nutritional value.  However, this product has little taste!  I guess that is good compared to some green products, but compared to Greens First this is not a pleasant experience.  Greens First actually makes me look forward to my greens each day.  Those that thought this product tasted good and was minty should try Greens First if they want a real taste treat.<br /><br />For me, this product just didn't cut it.  I immediately dropped my subscription after my first can.
