review/summary: Taste is not my only indicator of quality anymore.
review/text: When I was a less healthy and natural eater, this sauce was my #1 choice. It is, however, laden with high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) and preservatives, and when we rid our house of HFCS and hydrogenated fats, this had to go as well.<br /><br />If they made a version with sugar instead of HFCS, I'd buy it, but with our messed up ag subsidies and big business domination, it's unlikely.

review/text: I purchased this tea at a mall after sampling several flavors I instantly was hooked. Although they are a little pricey a little goes a long way. I now buy them on Amazon at a fraction of the cost. And after several weeks of drinking these teas my skin has taken on a glow. I have had people tell me that I look so healthy and I am sure it has to do with the antioxidants and the other ingredients. I purchased soothing nighttime teas and they work great. I highly recommend Teavana and all their  products. One very happy customer!

review/text: I feel like I've tried the whole spectrum of gluten Free pastas out there and this one is by far the best.  I had tried rice pastas and quinoa pastas but none held up or tasted as good as this.  The quinoa would break up into bits and be a mess and the rice just had a different taste.  With this brand I actually feel like I'm eating what the rest of the family is having.  Heck, I think I could just feed everyone this and nobody would know the difference, and unlike those other pastas, this one doesn't break the bank.  I'll be buying a 12 pack.

review/summary: Amazing Raw Vegan Snack
review/text: Coco-Roons are the perfect size for an after dinner dessert or a mid-day snack.  Typical raw "bars" are usually more of a  meal, where these little gems are like cookies.  Unlike your typical cookie though, it doesn't take more than one or two to be pleasantly satisfied.<br /><br />The Lemon and Brownie varieties are amazing.  The flavors are rich and exactly what I would expect them to be.  There is nothing subtle about their taste at all.  They both have a slightly dry but not crispy exterior, while the inside is moist like cake.  This can be a tricky texture to achieve in raw vegan foods so I was duly impressed.  Additionally, the cacao in the brownie did not leave a bitter aftertaste as many raw cacao products do.<br /><br />I have also tried the Almond & Strawberry flavor and was not at all thrilled.  This one, in my opinion, missed the mark in every way.  Almond & Strawberry is supposed to be a take on the classic PB&J, but it doesn't take more than a bite to tell you that it's nothing of the sort.  The taste is very bland with only a slight hint of almond and no perceptible strawberry flavor at all.<br /><br />This is a snack that I will continue to buy.  I find that, while on the expensive side, they are definitely not excessively so. In my opinion, Coco-Roons are worth the cost as an occasional, healthy treat.  I would love to try the Apple Pie and Vanilla Maple flavors next.

review/text: Wonderful sticky Japanese short-grained rice, cooks perfectly in a rice cooker like this one (or any good rice cooker) I bought on Amazon:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BFTAT6">Tiger America 10 c. Elec Rice Cooker/Food St ( JNP-1800 )</a><br />Check out my review of this fabulous cooker to see what the experts recommend to properly prepare your rice so it's always wonderfully tasty.<br /><br />If you follow the specific directions on various Japanese rice-cooking web sites, by spending a little extra time prepping sticky rice before you cook you'll get perfect rice every time, even in a pot on the stove. This rice always turns out perfect -- I add a little more water than what's recommended by my rice cooker because we like moister, softer rice. It still turns out sticky and perfect. It's absolutely wonderful with any food you can think of, even for breakfast with some egg or tofu.<br /><br />There's a reason this particular rice is so highly rated -- it's short-grained and grown in the USA, always perfect texture, always perfect rice. Many other so-called sushi/sticky rices are medium-grained and just not the same. I have compared prices in the very few stores I could find that carry this brand and type, and Amazon's price is competitive, especially if you get free shipping. I highly recommend this rice for all purposes and tastes.

review/summary: Great Sticky Rice, a bit pricey
review/text: The rice is great and the containers are great too. (The containers make great light-bug lanterns).  The quantity is decent but one would expect more for the price. However, if you are like me- far away from any place that may sell small grain rice (sticky rice, sushi rice) then this is actually a decent price for buying on line (especially with free shipping if you are a prime member). I searched the web over for a good price on this rice and this one ranks up there in lowest price AND best quality (and you get those awesome clear containers that can have a multitude of uses).  If you live where you can buy it locally, it would be a lot cheaper to do that.  The rice is of high quality; the bonus being that is grown and packaged in the U.S. (Alvin, Tx).

review/text: I was in a thrift store before the first Friday in December and they had many Christmas coffee / tea cups for 10 cents a cup.  It hit me to buy those cups and fill them with small treats for their holiday relaxing time.  One of my treats was a single tea bag from the 20-count Twinings Christmas Tea bags.  Almost everyone thanked me for the small treat; telling me how tastey they thought it was and asked for more information about the tea I had included in their cup...sadly, I went back to the store where I bought my tea and they were OUT !  After looking several places, I had to give up.  Your tea must have been a great hit in my area.  I can hardly wait to find more and enjoy a second cup before our cold winter weather is over.  I am sure my class member will also be looking for a box of the Twinings Christmas Tea bags.<br />Mary Alice La Rue

This gluten free crust tastes better than most ordinary pie crusts I've had... so surprised.  Really tasty, especially when warmed up.

review/summary: this LATTE is absolutely delicious and good for you too
review/text: Most people mention to me that this coffee tastes 'very good' and 'smooth'. Most comment on the noticeable energy and stamina that day after just one cup. Some have lost weight and most experience detoxification within one week. If you have health issues or ailments, you may want to search-engine 'ganoderma (comma) 'any disease' you can think of, to find out more. You will find many brands of 'healthy coffee' out there-in my opinion this brand and this flavour (latte) tastes the best. But I highly recommend you taste the product and see what it can do for YOU. Every 'body' is different. I'm just one person, but for me, this brand has positively affected my: blood pressure, sugar cravings, mood, flexibility, migraines/headaches, skin, allergies [prone to sinus allergies]. I am happy to report that I have NEVER encountered: jitters, crash, burning stomach, nor nausea with this coffee (as was the case with my previous habit of 3 to 4 cups a day of 'regular' coffee). Go to pubmed, answers, reishi to learn even more about Ganoderma. This LATTE flavor of OG healthy coffee includes creamer & sugar in a perfect mix-no need to add anything else. It is important to note that 8 ounces of hot water added to the latte sachet contents in your favorite mug is the best way to experience it. [for the MOCHA & HOT CHOCOLATE, I recommend 8 oz. of hot water as well].

review/summary: Great Coffee, and I'm not into the MLM thing at ALL
review/text: It seems like many reviews for Organo Gold products are written by people who work the MLM business (Amway-style) side of this thing. Very self-promoting to endorse a product you sell, yes? It makes for less-than-reliable reviews.<br /><br />I was subjected to the spiel. I laughed it off. However, I honestly love the coffee! I'm on a diet plan and the Cafe Latte is only 2 WW points. The taste is GREAT in my opinion, and I have always been a coffee snob who only drinks Chemex-brewed coffee. The Organo Gold has much less sugar than I would normally have in a homebrew or work-brew cup, and NO dairy. Health-wise, it's a positive.<br /><br />I don't know how beneficial the Ganoderma is, and I really don't care. I've been drinking ONLY Organo Gold coffee for 3 months now and I haven't grown any new limbs or anything - so it seems safe. It's incredibly handy at work, and for travel as well - though I drink it every day regardless.<br /><br />It's NOT normal coffee. Purists may not like it I suppose. I just really enjoy the taste regardless, also the smoothness, the lesser caffeine level, and the ease of prep. I no longer need to keep fresh half & half or sugar on hand at work. I would consider this a "coffee alternative". I have tried pretty much every "instant pack" coffee out there, and none come even close to the quality of Organo Gold. They do one thing, and they do it well. The quality is evident if you do side-by-side comparisons.

I have tasted both the mocha and latte and they actually taste the same nor have I noticed a "surge" in energy...I am pretty active already, but was looking for that afternoon boost and I did not get it from this...I will go back to my sugarfree international instant coffee...it taste better and better yet it's CHEAPER!

review/summary: Healthy Coffee?
review/text: How can any coffee (latte) with the primary ingredients of sugar and non dairy creamer which is actually hydrogenated oil be marketed as healthy? In order to have a therapeutic dosage of ganoderma (lingzhi), the shell of the spore must be broken and you have to have well over 10g of the lingzhi (ganoderma) based upon the person's weight and condition to be effective. Nice tasting coffee, but not a healthy coffee. You would do better going to get some Folgers and keep the money in your pocket.

I like ramen soup, but the problem with regular Maruchan ramen is that it has msg and wheat (gluten) and also twice the sodium per packet and its preserved with TBHQ. All of which is bad for me. Also ramen is fried, these rice noodles are steam cooked, not fried. Best of all, if you get these from Amazon, they cost almost half the price compared to the supermarket. I mean the supermarket price was reasonble, but Amazon is Great!

review/text: I'd switched from Crystal Light (which was sweetened with aspartame) to Walmart's Great Value brand (sweetened with sucralose) primarily because sucralose seems to have the edge when it comes to safety and taste.  Of course, studies, potential side effects, and taste buds vary so...<br /><br />Safety aside, I find the 4C products have more "punch" -- no pun intended -- and I enjoy all the flavors.

The 4 sweet treats were light but tasty and just right for a midafternoon snack or a dessert.  The cheeses were very flavorful and useful for everything from simple cheese and crackers to grilled cheese sandwich and even a quick  macaroni and cheese dinner.  The sausages were great for snacking.  A couple slices after work made a tasteful snack and could help him wait for dinner.  Or, a few slices with eggs in the morning made for a great breakfast.  All in all this was a very successful gift, and at a very reasonable price.

review/text: If it lasted, it would be a good chew.  It's a little smelly but compared to a chew-hoof it's Chanel.  Puppy took it from my hand and went straight to work, and it lasted about 20 minutes.  He's a bigger chewer now but at the time he was not the most ferocious, and it would last maybe 8 minutes now.  No mess on the floor - little nibbled bits that stick to your socks - like you get with real bones.  No loose stool either, but there were some FUNKY smells going on in his vicinity a few hours after each bone.<br /><br />For a more durable chew without the stinkies, try an antler.  I'll post a review on those if I can find them in my order history.<br /><br />Based on the dogs I've owned, this would be great for a Sheltie, spaniel, bichon or other small- to midsize- puppy that isn't a serious chewer but needs a job to do to keep him out of trouble.

review/text: I bought these bones for my adult dog and a couple of young teething puppies I was fostering.  My adult dog was able to devour these things in no time (I eventually got him the larger sized bones so it would at least last him a good minute instead of seconds).  The puppies loved to chew on these things and were determined to eat them as fast as they could.  When one puppy managed to finish, she would go after her sister's if she still had some left.  These things actually smell good enough that you might almost want to eat one.  haha  They don't last too long but they are a good treat for a dog, especially one who is teething.  They still don't last more than 5 minutes but if you want to spoil your dog, this is a good way to do it.

review/summary: I Love These Say My Dogs
review/text: I bought these during Amazon's 4/3 promotion.  I have two golden retrievers who are spoiled badly and I am constantly looking for healthy treats for them.  These are perfect because I can open one package and have one bone for each dog.  They love these and sit waiting for them.  They are not soft but not like rawhide so when they chew on them, it helps clean their teeth.  There are enough vitamins and flavor to keep them interested until the whole bone is gone.  I would definitely buy again.

review/summary: Dog loved it, until his first bowel movement.
review/text: I am a big fan of treats that are digestable.  I purchased this product thinking it would be safe to feed my dog.  I left the treat for my dog on my way out the door for work, when I arrived home 4 hours later the treat was fully gone and the poor dog could not control his bowel movements and had diarrhea.<br /><br />This diarreha lasted for 2 days, and was so bad that I had to take a trip to the vet which ended up being one of the most expensive trips I've made there yet to have him tested for various illnesses.<br /><br />I didn't attribute the diarrhea to the product at first, but a week later I again gave my dog this bone treat and a few hours after eating the bone the diarrhea started back up again.<br /><br />I'm unsure what exactly about this product is "healthy", and would argue against it being "edible".  Sure technically you can give this product to your dog and if he eats peices it won't require surgery to remove.  But you'll spend 2-3 days dealing with uncontrolable doggy bowel movements, and excessive dehydration.  And if your not quick enough to realize it's this treat causing your problems you'll spend a few hundred bucks at the vets office like I did.<br /><br />And don't get me started on how quickly these things can get eaten....<br /><br />From now on I'll stick with bully sticks.

review/summary: does the job
review/text: For the price, it would be nice if these bones lasted longer, but they do their job so I'm not complaining. I spoke to someone at a pet supply store who recommended these as an alternative to rawhide chews, and he said they're fully digestible, while being good for dogs' teeth and gums. My dog (a 30lb beagle/coonhound) LOVES the bacon flavor, and it keeps him occupied for a little while (probably about a half hour). At this rate, these are a little more expensive than rawhides, and serve the same function, but are safer for your dog, since they are more easily digestible than rawhide. Ultimately, these bones are a pretty nice treat for my dog, but I'll also be looking for some longer-lasting chews to keep him occupied for longer periods.

My two Pom's love them and it is their morning treat.  They won't let forget to give them to them as they make sure they stare me down till I do. lol  They can be eaten without any worry of anything happening to them as they don't contain plastic or any other foreign material. Unless I find a bad review or hear that there is a recall on these, hope there isn't, I will continue to buy these Edibles.  My boys like the bacon flavor the best out of all the different flavors offered.  Amazon also offers a really good price on these.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: My dog is being treated for a condition that requires me to reduce her exercise level to almost nothing.  I'm desperately trying to find treats that will keep her quiet and aren't rawhide.  The vet told me I shouldn't give me dog rawhide on a daily basis, so I decided to try these edible Nylabones.<br /><br />My dog loved how these tasted, but she finished them in a matter of minutes.  The description calls these "edible chews," so I was expecting these bones to keep my dog occupied.  I wouldn't call these bones "chewy" either.  They seem to be slightly tougher than a Milkbone, but just as dry.  I have been a fan of Nylabone products for as long as I can remember.  I raised all my puppies with Nylabones, but these edible Nylabones don't last long enough.<br /><br />On the plus side, my dog did enjoy these treats and they didn't give her an upset stomach (she has a pretty tough stomach though).

My boxer boy has a sensitive stomach, and these have never given him any "digestive" (read "gas" or "the runs") problems, although I limit him to just a third of a bone a day.  May not be the healthiest, as one reviewer said, but seems to make my dogs limited life happier.  Not to mention, most real bacon is loaded with salt, chemicals, and saturated fat...not too healthy either!

review/summary: Read the fine print
review/text: We bought the multi-pack that comes with the standard non-edible nylabones. After 3 minutes of our puppy chewing on this "edible" bone, we got concerned that he had bitten off a chunk of it. To our relief, the bone is technically "edible", but the fine print says for puppies 6 months and older. To me, that's a little misleading. I'd consider a puppy under 6 months old.<br /><br />Our dog passed the 1-inch chunk he'd eaten, but it was his first soft stool in the 6 weeks we've had him. The rest of the bone found its way into the garbage. Nylabone should reconsider selling a multi-pack of these bones mixed with the non-edible style. We were ultra-concerned when handing him a bone that he managed to eat assuming it was the same as the others.<br /><br />My advice, steer clear of these "healthy" edible Nylabones.

review/text: My 60-lb lab mix loved this bone (the large size)! I like that it doesn't leave a nasty mess all over the floor and didn't give Hobbes any gas or stool problems. But I bought it thinking that it would last awhile, since its large and feels hard, but he finished it in 5 minutes flat. Not very cost effective, since they are pretty expensive and don't last long, but I will reiterate that my dog absolutely loved it.

review/summary: Very disappointing if you have previously used the plastic Nylabones.
review/text: My puppy is teething so I had previously purchased the original Nylabone made out of flavored plastic. The dog loved it, not super excited about the regular bone but she did put a lot of work into destroying it. When she finally finished the original plastic bone I decided to go back to the store and grab some more. I was looking around and came across these, "natural," flavored bones and thought.... "SWEET!!! Same great bone but easier to digest!" How wrong I was. First off this is NOTHING like the plastic teething bones. They crumble easily... and by easily I mean my 3.5 month old Wheaten Terrier destroyed these in less than 30min, and she's only about 15 pounds right now. They are recommended for dogs 6 months + with pretty much a full set of permanent teeth because they can shred the bone more easily and to a finer debris. For my dog this was BS... she destroyed these into tiny little flakes that can be easily digested AND managed to get them all over her underbelly and tangled in her fur. The mess wasn't an issue.. the durability was. This is basically an expensive treat, I much rather give her bullysticks over this as a treat (and they last longer). If your dog is teething, this is def NOT the Nylabone version you want. Stick to the original plastic flavored bones or frozen towels. Both work great.

review/text: I've tried other store bought pesto sauces but none has ever come close to what I've prepared from scratch - until now.<br /><br />I've put this sauce on pasta and even added a bit to my homemade beef vegetable soup (after the soup was cooked).  It was delicious.  Both dishes tasted like they were prepared with fresh basil.<br /><br />What I would suggest is after the pasta is cooked, retain a little of the water before draining it off.  Once the pasta has been drained, add a few tablespoons of pesto sauce to it and toss (3 to 4 tbsps. per pound of pasta).  Then add the pasta water, one tablespoon at a time and continue tossing.  Don't add too much water; just enough so that the sauce spreads and coats the pasta smoothly and evenly.<br /><br />It's quick and easy as well as delicious.  If you add a piece of garlic bread and a salad, you've got a complete meal that is satisfying and inexpensive.<br /><br />Buono Appetito.<br /><br />Note:  it contains 234 mg. of sodium

review/summary: Neat way to finally get some ZZzzs
review/text: I was excited to try this product after my positive experience with the NeuroSonic energy/focus drink from this line. I use this on nights I'm not tired and need to wake up early for the next day.<br /><br />MY SLEEP SITUATION:<br />I have the issue of being relatively tired in the evening and then getting a "second wind" around 10, which causes me to want complete tasks when I should be sleeping or winding down for bed.  If I'm not watching the clock I can be up till 2 A.M. doing random around the house or reading articles.  When I do sleep I also have nights where I wake up multiple times to shift around on my bed, which is disruptive to my sleep cycle.  To address this, I have tried a variety of sleep shots, drinks, supplements, and teas.  Many of them are not strong enough, do not keep me asleep the duration of the night, make it extremely difficult to wake up in the morning, or make me feel like a zombie when I am awake.<br /><br />TASTE (10/10):<br />Now I will begin to tell you about this refreshing sleep drink.  This lightly carbonated liquid is easy to drink (I consider it "chuggable") with a soft flavor that reminds me of strawberries and tangerines.  The taste does slightly linger in the mouth for a bit, but it's a pleasant taste either way.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE (10/10):<br />For this drink to work, I have to cooperate as well and hop into bed with the lights out.  If I don't do this, the drink doesn't reach its potential.  The first effect is a relaxed feeling within 10 minutes of consumption. About 15-25 minutes after drinking 1/3 to 1/2 of the bottle, my eyes to start getting very heavy.  At this point I can be watching an interesting show and nothing can keep me from passing out.  It feels great when I am falling asleep from this, like a well deserved rest. I do not wake up in the middle of the night after drinking NeuroSleep and feel like I get more out of my sleep.  I also do not feel overly tired waking up as long as I have 7 hours or more to sleep.  I have drank NeuroSleep many times but never get to the second half of my drink because I fall asleep, so I actually get 2-3 uses out of a bottle.  I'd imagine the effects are stronger when you drink the entire bottle before bed.<br /><br />COST (7/10):<br />I pay 2.39 for a 1 serving, 14.5 oz bottle. Even if it was 1.99 I'd feel a lot better about the price, but that is just a personal opinion.  The price does not keep me from purchasing the product 1-2 times a week and I am able to split one serving.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great sleep aid drink which I'd recommend to people who have trouble falling or staying asleep and want to stay away from prescription sleep aids.

I'm an insomniac, I constantly have sleeping problems and various methods like valerian root and such haven't really helped. This drink combined with a small dose of my usual sleep medication knocked me right out. Usually I have to take twice as much meds to sleep through the night! I would say this is definitely worth it, and the hype lived up to its name.<br /><br />One note is that none of these drinks seem to list their flavour on the bottle, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. The flavours I've had are good, I just don't know what they are/meant to be.

review/text: I haven't slept through the night in I don't even know how long. I drank one of these before bed last night and I fell asleep faster and stayed asleep until my alarm woke me up. I wasn't really expecting much out of this, seemed kind of gimmicky, but this drink worked better than sleeping pills ever have.

review/summary: It works. Just have to know how.
review/text: If your thinking about trying NeuroSleep, you definitely have chosen a legit product. Some people may say it doesnt work but, how are you going to sleep with 14.5 fl oz. In their stomach? You have to drink a little bit. And i mean a little bit. Im 6'3 220 and i drink a teaspoon to get a 2 hr nap when im not tired at all during the day. So i say a tablespoon of this stuff if you ate about 3-4 hours before you go to sleep, you lay down, relax and it sweeps you off to dream land in a matter of like 2 minutes. This stuff is genius. I cant wait to try the other flavors!

review/summary: Interesting results
review/text: So I saw this at Publix, I was skeptical as I am with every product that is not FDA promoted. (clearly says that the claims haven't been proven) I was thirsty so might as well have it!<br />Well, bad idea. I was so skeptical I drank it as if it was lemonade while on my computer for a bit... about 30m - 1h later, bed was claiming me. Next morning I woke up before my alarm, ready to GO (which NEVER happens, I hit the snooze button at least 3 times). I didn't have a drop of coffee that day, I usually have 3-4 cups. I didn't try it today, sleep was meh, and needed at least 2 cups of coffee, there was certainly a difference. Will try it tonight as well and see if the results are consistent.

review/summary: pretty good
review/text: I used to have some trouble falling asleep, but a little while after drinking almost a full bottle of this stuff i started to feel really drowsy and ended up falling asleep a lot earlier than I usually do. Tried it for a few more days and seems to work, but I'm not totally sure. It does seem to have some affect though. Has quite a lot of magnesium in it, i think 75%!  The taste isn't the greatest, not very sweet, for some it might even takes borderline like medicine. It's not completely horrible though. It tastes best when you first open it so I wouldn't leave it sitting in the fridge for a long time otherwise the taste might get worse.
