review/summary: DO NOT EVER USE THEM!!!
review/text: 3 orders not one of them good!  First roses sent to me (day after my 2 orders), mailed to me even though there are florist who work with them in town.  110 degree heat the boxed flowers have no moisture inside - no water caps or even moist towelettes just cut flowers open on the ends with a plastic open wrap around the top.  Well they were wilted, brown and gross!  Smelled of MOLD!  Called they fed ex'd another batch, mold free but tired looking never really looked any better after water.  Local grocery store better flowers at 1/3 cost!  2nd order I made for relative.  Days later got a call that they can't fill the order as requested, made changes to order supposed to get gift certificate for the problem.  Just found out the order never arrived - from the intended recipient!  Called them, all of the sudden emails arrive (while i'm on the phone) saying they have a problem and I need to contact them (after the delivery date)  the emails have a date stamp when they were sent but the typed in date was days before - really?!  How moronic, I can tell when you sent the email - it has a date stamp!  Anyway they claim they tried to call and left messages - I have caller ID and voice mail - THEY DID NOT CALL!  So no flowers for my relative oh but they will mail something (of their choosing) out today for them - gee thanks late and lame Hope it's not a funeral wreath.  They missed the b-day so now it just doesn't matter anymore.  Plus that gift coupon for $20 they were 'emailing' oh well now when I ask where that is - oh well I guess we mailed it and you will get it in about 6 weeks.  Seriously???  How are you sending it? Pony express?? Is someone walking it to me??  They failed, lied and tried to make it look like they did what they said.  Unbelievable!  Oh but we are not done...  Order number 3 (made at same time as order 2) I though i better ask if that one delivered ok...they say 'What order?'  They claim they have no order.  It's on the same receipt as the previous one - paid the same time.  They totally missed that one but they won't even refund my money until I send them a copy of my receipt. MY RECEIPT?  Are you serious, they don't have a record of it ?  I paid with paypal, they have that and with the order number they should have the original full order that includes all this mess we have been dealing with for the other one.  Never in my life has a national company so screwed up - repeatedly.  The only orders these morons can get right are the ones that actually make it to a good local florist then anything that goes right is the florist not 1-800-flowers.<br />Do yourself a HUGE favor - find the nearest florist or floral department in a store (many will deliver), call them and place your order - any online map service or phone service will help you.  Do not ever use 1-800-flowers!!!

review/summary: Ehh....I could have matched the bouquet better if I'd have done it myself.
review/text: I ordered the large version of Fields of Europe, the orange rose version. While the flowers are "close" I really didn't want pink roses. If I wanted pink roses I would have ordered that bouquet instead. I was hoping for something that really popped of summer, not a springy love bouquet. For the price, they should send you what you order and not just make it up and hope for the best. I've ordered lots of flowers through 1800flowers and I think from now on I will find someone else! Just disappointed that something that cost $75 would come looking closer to what I was wanting.

review/text: We purchase the small cans to give our fussy dog just the right size serving for breakfast. I worry that this company might change their formula one day. Tip for fussy dogs? Start with this product or a treat and then see if REX will switch to a top dry food. Our dog eats this and then wants something else because he is still hungry (OK, yes, I did switch to dinner). Keep mixing the variety for REX, the spoiled. and even offer a few different dry selections to MR. FUSSY. Do not try to just feed Mr. Fussy duck. Mix it up.

review/text: I love this brand of chews for my Shih Tzu. They do not come apart easily so she really just chews on one for hours. Other brands that I have purchased in the past break apart and she chokes on them. Some other brands she actually tries to swallow whole, but not with these. She just chews on them and bites off little pieces at a time. I will not give her any other raw hide chews. These are the best.

review/summary: tasty not over-powering shrimp chips
review/text: Two good things are apparent about these snacks right away, they arent round like the typical chip, but are more shaped like 'fries' making them easier to eat; and you can clearly taste the shrimp flavor but it's more delicate than some snacks, so the taste is not over whelming or too salty- even though there is some MSG included on the ingredient list.  The consistancy is also quite nice, there is a crunch to them, but the chips arent so hard as if you're chewing glass or some foreign matter; eating these won't make sensitive teeth hurt. They also come in a four ounce bag; enough to satisfy but not make you feel bloated and easy to count calories if you care about such things.  If you like your snacks with a seafood taste there really isn't a downside to this brand.  Enjoy.  Hope this helps.

review/summary: Suddenly Pasta Salad, Classic, 7.75-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)
review/text: Around three years ago me, my college room mate Kenny, and my girlfriend went on a cross-country roadtrip to hang out in Kenny's uncle's condo at a ski resort during the summer.  Now, Kenny's uncle Rodney is a weird dude to be sure, and in retrospect we should have known something was up when he invited three college students to stay with him in the wilderness for a week, but at the time we were just excited for an adventure and a free place to stay.  It took us almost a whole day to find the play when we got nearby; it was in the middle of podunk nowhere and there was nobody to ask directions of because the ski resort was deserted during the summer.  By the time we got there it was already dark, but Rodney welcomed us and provided us with booze.  We were content until we realized that we were starving, that Rodney's condo was out of food, and we were all too smashed to go get any.  I was distraught until he assured me that "there would be plenty of food tomorrow," while discreetly watching Angela (my girlfriend) out of the corner of his eye.  Soon, we were all passed out in Rodney's guest rooms.  I distinctly remember Angela getting up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom (I assumed), and thought no more of it until I awoke at 4:00AM alone, and the bathroom was empty.  I went and found Kenny, and hungover and starving we went in search of the two missing members of our party.  It was dawn when we smelled it: an unearthly aroma wafting through the house and tempting our taste buds.  The smell got stronger as we approached the boiler room door in the basement.  We began to open the door when Suddenly Pasta Salad! The entire room was filled with it!<br /><br />We never saw Rodney or Angela again, but we visit that condo for the pasta salad in that delicious room every summer.

At first I was pretty worried because the guy at the counter stared at the box for a long time like he couldn't figure out something and then he made this really scared face at it and didn't say anything. Still, it was surprisingly good for the price!<br /><br />I went back for more the next day and the place was totally gone! There was just an empty lot and when I asked someone walking by if they knew where the place was, they said that there used to be a bodega there but it burned down 20 years ago. So, no luck there! I hope I can find that place again because they had some other cool stuff and even some antiques.

review/text: I like Fig Newtons and have been missing them since I cut out white flour and enriched flour from my diet. These are made with whole grain and taste very good. The reason I can't give them five stars is because even though the advertisement does not list "high fructose corn syrup" as an ingredient, the actual nutrition label does. This is an ingredient that I try not to have in my food, but it is getting very difficult to find products that don't contain it.

review/text: While not readily available in many markets, the fat free fig newtons are an excellent dessert alternative for those trying to lower chlosterol without drugs. Very tasty and satisfying. The price and free shipping save us about 30% at Amazon compared to the Safeway market. Almost time for another case!

review/summary: Perfectly portable snack
review/text: I have to stay for long hours at school, and I've been looking for snacks I can bring that aren't too unhealthy. When I found out about these fig newton minis, I was pretty excited since I absolutely love the full size fig newtons. Since they're smaller, there is of course much less of the fruit filling.. but still, a delicious snack. The size of each individual bag is quite small (a little over 1oz) so it's not too great at staving off those hunger pangs, but it helps.

review/text: These are Fig Newtons, what can you say?  Everyone likes them (or not).  They are a nice-sized snack in a nearly indestructible foil wrapper.  You get two double-length cookies, approximately equivalent to 4 regular Fig Newtons.  Good for tossing in lunches, purses, the car, etc.  Arrived very fresh and in good shape.  Handy as a somewhat more nutritious snack.  We like them enough to order more, when on sale!

review/text: If this is the first time you've considered tasting a Fig Newton then, Welcome to; America, planet Earth, or back from the dead. Nabisco has been baking these little gems for over 100 years and they are a part of American culture. If you actually haven't tried a "Newton" they are small cookies that consist of a soft cake outer sleeve with sweet fig jam in the middle. These packages are half the size of a regular package of newtons and come in a rigid plastic tray, inside a plastic bag, inside a small cardboard box. These were fresh and well within the "best by" date.

review/summary: Doesn't Work For Our Family
review/text: I bought these wipes a month ago and used them every day for a week before tossing them in the trash.  We live in a wooded environment and there are areas where water stands for awhile after it rains.  Mosquito's are everywhere and our only break from them is during the Winter season.  We've tried everything and the only two things that work for us are full coverage clothing and the dark green spray bottle of OFF Deep Woods Repellent.<br /><br />For these particular wipes, we used one wipe per person before going outdoors.  Mosquito's began attacking us immediately.  We returned indoors to use more wipes in case one wipe per person wasn't enough.  The mosquitos still attacked.  So we returned indoors to shower up and apply our anti-itch bug cream.  I continued to go out every day for the rest of the week using these wipes and the same thing kept happening no matter how many wipes I used.<br /><br />My youngest is allergic to Mosquito bites so it's a big deal that we have a good repellent.  She's been to the hospital for mosquito bites (how we found out she was allergic) and has to be put on antibiotics to prevent her skin from becoming necrotic.  Our Pediatrician said that while there is a lot of debate on whether to put Deet containing products on young children, she suggests doing so carefully and properly which we have done.  Once I tossed these wipes, I purchased OFF Deep Woods Repellent Spray.  It's in a dark green bottle with an orange pump top.  That product has worked excellent for us and my youngest hasn't been bitten.<br /><br />I think the idea of wipes is nice for a few reasons but we're going to stick with the bottle of spray.  These wipes may work for others but they didn't work for us.

review/summary: love it more than other wipes
review/text: i bought these last summer, and absolutely loved them because i never got a bite when i used it (i usually use 2 if i'm scantily clad). i live in texas, and mosquitoes LOVE to bite me. i'm slightly allergic, and the bites stay around for weeks, so it was such a relief to find this product. i like it much more than the spray bottle because i feel i can cover all of my skin.<br />i prefer it to the off! brand of wipes because i like the smell better. this has less DEET than the 'off! deep woods' one, but i really dislike the super-strong smell of that one, and for normal use, 7% DEET is plenty.<br />if you are in the woods, though, i would recommend products with more DEET. i use this for outdoor festivals and parties at night.

review/text: My two year old son is severely allergic to mosquito bites. Within minutes the bites open like a soar and begin to oozz. They last for days and usually leave scars so we need something to keep the msquitos away and these cutter wipes have been great. We live in a hot humid climate so we have mosqitos almost year around. Every time we apply the wipes he has stayed bite free. We love the wipes because we don't have to spray anything that could possibly get in his eyes. I can't say enough about these wipes!!!

review/summary: not individually wrapped so you can't just stick one in your purse or pocket
review/text: It's my fault for not reading the reviews carefully since I now see that at least one reviewer mentioned the fact that these are all in one package, albeit resealable.  What I wanted was individually wrapped wipes to take in my purse for when mosquitoes suddenly began biting my ankles at an outdoor restaurant or on a picnic.  The package is too heavy to take the whole thing in my purse and even though it's resealable it's hard to seal it really tight so the wipes tend to dry out.

review/text: I use these in a primarily urban environment and around parks that have mosquitos. They work well as a repellant for our family. The wipes are much more convenient to pack on trips and to give to children to apply to themselves. I always keep some of these around, and will buy more as long as they keep selling them. I bought on Amazon because my local stores were no longer selling the wipes.

I was offered no discount or upgraded shipping, no additional product with my order, no discount on my next order, not even an apology for the 7 day delay. Just an excuse that the email order was lost and that her IT guy would be on the problem tomorrow. This is not the first problem I have had with an order. They do not give a tracking number. When asked for one the odds of getting one are 50-50. I have had so many problems with my orders I will go without my Aunt Lizzies cheese straws. I will miss them greatly however I need the hassle associated with ordering them less than I need the cheese straws. Ann, I wish you the best in the future and suggest you participate in customer service training classes to refrain from losing additional customers in the future. FOLLOW UP: Here it is almost a month later. I just received an email notifying me that my order shipped on the Aug 9th. I have not placed an order! What more can they do?

review/text: These grits are excellent.  Amazon, in their product description says that "hominy grits are coarsely ground hominy or corn".  That statement is incorrect.  Hominy IS corn...that has the germ removed and is soaked in a weak lye solution.<br />Grits made from hominy are superior to grits made from regular cracked corn.  If you like grits, you will love this product from Angelina's Gourmet.  One item missing from Amazon and Angelina is cooking instructions.  Bring 1 1/4 cups of water to a low boil.  Add 1/3 cups of grits. Turn heat to its lowest setting.  You want the grits to barely simmer, not boil!  Stir well and frequently for the first couple of minutes.  Cover pan , removing to stir every couple of minutes.  About 15 minutes will do it.  The longer you can cook without going dry, the creamier the grits will be. Serving size?  It's one serving for me, maybe two for you.  You can figure this out......not rocket science.

Some cookbook authors, and on-line chefs, say grits and cornmeal are the same.  But, other sources say the two are different.  I was searching for natural, slow-cooking grits and couldn't find them locally.  In grocery stores I could only find Instant or Quick-cooking grits and one of the recipes I wanted to try warned me away from those products.<br /><br />I'm glad I bought these even though the 10lb bag is going to last me a long time.  I have enjoyed the cooking process, the versatility and, eating them.

review/summary: My favorite so far
review/text: This coffee is closer to what I drank at the kafeneios in Greece than any other Greek or Turkish coffee I've tried. It's absolutely wonderful and very much worth trying if you like Greek or Turkish coffee. My favorite variety so far, I have a cup of it every morning with breakfast. My only complaint is that I can't find larger bags of it!

review/summary: Not Ideal for the Task
review/text: After playing sports for many years I thought the "Lace Cover" would save me a lot of electrical tape that I normally use to secure boot laces. So when I saw these I thought what a great idea. Well yesterday they were used for the first time and......FAIL. The Lace Cover comes in 1 size only ( too large for most people ). I have a reasonably large foot ( size 13 US )and although the Lace Cover is elasticized , was reasonably loose fitting. Hence , they never really did cover the laces properly. Then after some scrummaging ( Rugby Union ) , one of the lace covers vanished completely. Although the item is not expensive , save your money. It's back to the electrical tape for me !

review/summary: Watch out for this tea
review/text: Oh my gosh.  I bought this tea and drank my first cup in the late afternoon.  By evening I was having the worst stomach cramps and diarrhea.  I belatedly looked at the ingredients and the first one is senna leaves.  During internet research I discovered that some individuals may experience discomfort or cramping after using senna products.  Also the following admonition - don't take senna for more than a week or so or your body could end up relying on it to contract your bowels.<br /><br />Side effects can include:<br />*diarrhea<br />*intestinal cramps or gripping pains<br />*rash<br />*severe weight loss<br /><br />Senna should not be used by persons with Crone's disease, Diverticular disease and other similar diseases.<br /><br />Senna is not a daily or causal supplement and excessive use can cause liver damage.<br /><br />I wanted to die my insides hurt so bad.  Any weight loss you may accomplish with this tea may not be worth the pain.  Be aware before you use.  I threw my remaining 29 tea bags away!

review/summary: really good tuna; wild caught off Thailand; "good alternative" according to Seafood Watch
review/text: I often need fast protein & I find this tuna to be the answer; it is delicious, not fishy like Trader Joe's tuna.<br /><br />I looked up the best sustainable canned tuna choices, since I love tuna, and hope to not eat unsustainable food ... a website I like & trust is the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch site; I consult it before buying seafood, and they give Tongol tuna, wild caught off the coast of Malaysia to be a "good alternative" - this Natural Sea canned Tongol Tuna is wild caught off the coast of Thailand - so enjoy a safe pleasure!<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Tongol Tuna<br /><br />Most tongol tuna is ranked as "Avoid" due to high levels of bycatch and poor enforcement of fisheries regulations.<br /><br />Consumer Note<br />Tongol is typically marketed as either tongol tuna or canned light tuna, and is gaining popularity as a slightly moister alternative to albacore (white) tuna.<br /><br />Summary<br />Unlike most other commercially caught tuna species that travel the world's oceans, tongol tuna is "neritic," meaning it favors nearshore waters. It's found in the Indian and Western Pacific Oceans.<br /><br />Over 90 percent of tongol tuna in the market comes from four nations: Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia and Thailand. All have numerous management measures in place to help protect tongol tuna populations; however, Malaysia is the only one that also has adequate enforcement. For this reason, tongol tuna from Malaysia is ranked as a "Good Alternative."<br /><br />Tongol tuna is caught in a variety of ways. Gear such as trolls, handlines, or pole gear is more selective, and tongol tuna caught these ways are "Good Alternatives."<br /><br />Tongol tuna caught using all other gear (including gillnets and purse seines) has high bycatch of sharks and juvenile fishes and is ranked as "Avoid" - unless caught in Malaysia, in which case it's a "Good Alternative."

review/summary: Finally, healthy gum!
review/text: I've been a chewing gum addict since high school, but have decided to avoid aspartame.  Imagine my dismay when I found that every gum at the grocery store and warehouse store contained it!  Happily, I discovered this gum at a local health food store.  The gum is flavored with natural ingredients (Fruit also contains artificial flavors), has no food coloring, and is sweetened with Xylitol (a natural sweetener with oral health benefits).  The flavors are delicious (I like to chew one Green Tea with one Cinnamon), and Amazon's price is awesome compared to $2 for 10 pieces I paid at the store.<br />The flavors do not last as long as gum that contains aspartame, and I miss having a gum wrapper in which to dispose of my old gum, but I love being able to enjoy gum without worrying about my health!

review/summary: I like it a lot and it work for what I purchased it for
review/text: I purchased Spry at the recommendation of my dentist to assist with dry mouth(not to be confused with cotton mouth :P, but I am sure it could help with that too).  I am not a big gum chewer, but decided I would like this better than the mouth wash, which I have tried.<br /><br />I like all the flavors of this package.  I try to chew on a piece after eating/drinking anything, but usually at least twice a day after a meal. After using Spry, I have noticed a significant improvement from before trying Spry. My teeth and mouth feel cleaner longer than with just regular brushing.  Additionally, dryness isn't nearly as bad as before.<br /><br />At first I thought the price was a bit high, but I don't feel that way anymore. Is cheaper per piece than many popular gums. You don't want to buy this with the impression that it can replace your typical chewing gum.  It wasn't designed to be a long lasting gum.  However, I haven't had any problems chewing on a piece of Spry for up to 20 minutes(direction say to chew for 5 minutes) and it didn't start to break down or taste bad.<br /><br />I recommend this product.

review/summary: So happy to find this online
review/text: I am a big time snacker. So, instead of consuming all those calories when I snack, I often opt for chewing gum just to keep my mouth moving. I have purchased this product at the local health food store but was turned off buying it because of the high price. But I love it, it tastes good and is a guilt-free chewing gum without all the garbage in regular gum. I especially like that it helps prevent tooth decay in between meals. Sure, the taste doesn't last as long as regular gum, hence the need for buying it in bulk.<br /><br />I am so glad I could purchase it online for a good price. So worth it.

review/summary: Quick Burst of Delicious Flavor
review/text: I love the flavor of this gum and I love that it is healthy.  All 5 flavors taste great to me.  I think the price is also great.<br /><br />That being said, I will be trying other brands and options before buying this again.  The flavor lasts right around 30-45 seconds of normal chewing.  I usually pop in a new piece every few minutes depending upon my mood.  Sometimes I'll chew up to 10 pieces in a 30 minute timeframe.  I like to have flavor for at least a few minutes and this gum does not do this.<br /><br />Initially when I tried these, I would have given them 4 or 5 stars.  But now that I'm so used to the flavor disappearing on me quickly, 3 stars is the perfect rating for me.<br /><br />I would maybe buy again.  But I'll be trying some mints and other brands before I do this.

review/summary: Great Gum
review/text: I felt that I might have a problem with things containing Aspartame, so I decided to look for a gum that didn't have it. This gum is aspartame free, and so far hasn't caused any adverse effects. Gum with aspartame would give me a headache (and no, not from the chewing). I also switched diet sodas, and now only drink Diet Rite or Diet Coke with splenda. I never realized that my little headaches were cause by anything. I guess I thought the chewing of the gum and the caffeine from the sodas caused them, plus they weren't terrible headaches. But now I am headache free! Such an easy little change improved my quality of life. I would recommend this gum to anyone! It tastes really good, and all my friends that have tried it, like it. The only downside is it can get tough, but I don't mind. I only chew it to freshen my breath. I don't think it's a good gum for exercise.

Especially considering that it cuts down on cavities (by giving you something sweet to chew on without the sugar or fake sweetener).<br /> Some say that the flavor doesn't last long but I haven't experienced that problem. It does fade but maybe my taste buds are extra sensitive to pick up the flavor longer.

The scents are terrific and flavor lasts about as long as traditional (unhealthy) gums. There are PLENTY of pieces packed into each large container so you can chew to your hearts content.

review/summary: Bad Flavor & all kernels don't pop
review/text: I bought this because it was mini bags of ACT II popcorn ,which in the past the larger bags where very tasty and tasted fresh.<br />These small bags however have a funny taste and taste old ( and the date on them is good for a long time) These are not a good fresh crunchy popcorn taste.All the kernels don't pop and if you do get them to then the bag burns.I won't buy this kind again.I stick with pop secret.

review/summary: Magic Potion from South America.
review/text: Mate is actually not tea but a tea-like beverage originating from Argentina and Uruguay, and primarily consumed in those countries as well as in Paraguay and southern Brazil; brewed from the dried leaves and stemlets of the perennial Yerba Mate tree. Its name derives from the quichua word "mati" designating the gourd in which it is traditionally served. On average, 300,000 tons of Mate are produced each year.<br /><br />In its consistency similar to green tea, mate has a distinctive, full, bittersweet flavor with a note of alfalfa, resembling that of tea but milder. Of the 196 volatile chemical compounds contained in Yerba Mate, 144 are also contained in tea. Knowing its manifold health benefits - among the plant's ingredients are the alkaloids xanthine, theophylline and theobromine as well as vitamins C, E, several B vitamins and numerous minerals - the South American Guarani Indians have traditionally used the plant for medicinal purposes, inter alia as a stimulant to the central nervous system, to promote mental, physical and cardiovascular activity, enhance resistance to fatigue, reduce fever, mitigate thirst and hunger, decrease blood pressure, and as a diuretic, laxative, purgative, sudorific, and antirheumatic.<br /><br />Legend has it that knowledge of the infusion's powers was first imparted to a young Guarani woman and her father by a mysterious shaman, rewarding the woman's faithfulness in staying with her exhausted father while her tribe continued their search for arable land. In recent years, mate has become a cultural phenomenon throughout large parts of South America, and it is now gaining increased popularity in Northern America and Europe as well. In South America, sharing mate from the same container and the same straw (bombilla) is a symbol of closeness and friendship, both in a family and in other social contexts.

review/summary: Very good biscotti
review/text: I'm spoiled with biscotti. We have a great local company that makes lots of flavors and it's my favorite biscotti. That said, this is hands down the best nationally distributed biscotti I've had.<br />The chocolate is a nice thick coat and the biscotti itself is not too sweet. Just sweet enough to make a nice treat. The individually wrapped packages keep it crisp without letting it get too hard.<br /><br />Biscotti is twice baked, the second baking gives it the right amount of hardness and people like different amounts of hard. I want a cookie that I can bite into without soaking it for several minutes in coffee by that will also hold up to being dunked. If you are used to very hard biscotti, this may be too soft for your tastes.<br /><br />Nice size, doesn't fall apart in coffee, good amount of chocolate and individually wrapped. These are a good option for people who want a treat on the go with a cup of coffee.
