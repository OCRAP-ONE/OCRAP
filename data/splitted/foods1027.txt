review/summary: Great Taste. Poor condition
review/text: Review of Pirouline Wafers.  I've received two orders.  I love the texture and taste.<br /><br />My last order was for a party.  In each can at least half the wafers were in small pieces.<br />Inedible, let alone a treat for a party.<br /><br />With regret I cancel my subscription.

review/text: The dark chocolate ones surpass all other flavors we've tried.  They're decadently delicious.  You may want to keep some tins on hand for unexpected guests -- these elegant cookies look wonderful on a tea tray and make an excellent presentation with coffee or ice cream.  Amazon offers them at a very reasonable price, given that shipping is free with Prime membership.  What a great deal!

Once I determined that's what I had, I went on the hunt to find some "cheater" meals that could be made quickly and I would still be able to eat them.  Mrs. Leeper's Cream Tuna came through.

review/text: I am a huge fan of all of Dave's products and this mustard is no exception. It is spicy, very slightly sweet, tangy and delicious. It is not however, nearly as hot as Dave's other products. In fact, folks who are not as capsaicin tolerant may be okay with the heat here, I rate it as just above what you would get from a hot cherry pepper. This mustard goes great on hot dogs or sandwiches and I have used it to spice up some soup stocks. I recommend it.

review/text: My finicky daschund/chihuahua mix dog, Timmy, readily eats this food and digests it well. This smaller rolls (1 lb) are much easier to work with than the larger rolls if you have a small dog. Also, the smaller roll is more likely to stay fresh until you finish using it. We have tried the beef rolls. Upon opening the first initially, I was struck by how much it smelled like real human food.

We're able to refrigerate everything that we cut up and use it until it runs out. Great product. Would recommend it to anyone.

review/text: My baby loves the taste of Cerelac!! I grew up overseas and that's all we had as babies and I've decided to feed my daughter the same thing. It comes in wheat as well as rice mixed with fruits and vegetables. I love that it comes mixed with milk so it's naturally thick when mixed with water. It is a bit pricey but worth it! Unfortunately, most stores in teh US don't carry it so it's great to find it online.

review/text: I've tried them all. I've sampled each kind. I know that taste is subjective, but if bold is your thing, and delicious true coffee flavor is what you seek, give this a try. I don't buy mine, by the way, anywhere but at Target, where they're $9.95 for a box of 18. I usually buy 5-6 boxes at a time (they sell out quickly). For the decaf equivalent of this, the French Roast (also Green Mountain's brand) is equally as bold and flavorful. Happy Holidays!

review/summary: Good coffee - variable price
review/text: I'm a fan of the extra bold K-cups.  This is one of my favorite XBold varieties.  It is very consistent flavor from cup to cup.  It is strong, with almost a chocolate undertone and very little bitter aftertaste compared to most K-cup dark roasts.  Trying to extend my dollar a little further I had an extra large coffee mug one morning (the usual one was in the dish washer - dirty) and decided to brew my standard large cup and an extra brew (same k-cup) with the smallest setting.  I was surprised that it still had a lot of flavor and didn't taste watery or weak.<br /><br />Much better than the Green Mountain Dark Magic or Double Black Diamond.  Those left a bitter and burnt aftertaste, even with more sugar and cream than usual.<br /><br />For reference I also enjoy Emeril's Midnight Magic and the Newman's Own (medium roast, extra bold).<br /><br />Just be mindful of the price fluctuations and make sure you check the price per K-cup, some entries list price per ounce - which can make the coffee look more or less expensive than others.

review/summary: Strong, dark and fantastic
review/text: This is my favorite K-Cup. When I visit a Starbucks, I'll get their Sumatra whenever it's available. I now have had the opportunity to compare the Starbucks Sumatra K-Cup vs. the Green Mountain Sumatran. I'm torn. Maybe Starbucks has slight advantage. But there's a pretty significant difference in cost between the two. So Green Mountain wins.

review/text: I was new to the K-cup game and had been trying out different brands/types and just could not find a good BOLD/Dark Roast coffee.  Finally I did!  Green Mountain Coffee Extra Bold Sumatran Reserve is great!  I love starting my morning with a good bold cup of coffee.  If you like bold/dark roasts, then you'll love this one; if you prefer a "lighter" coffee, you would be better off with something different.

review/text: This is a great product and tastes really good. It has a sweet and mild taste my child loves and I think it is a good mainstream flavor that a lot of babies will like. I think I am still getting used to the pouch style but I appreciate that it has a zip top.<br /><br />It can be warmed up in a cup of hot water if desired, but I find that takes quite a long time. It has the texture that is age appropriate to other Stage 2 foods. I find if we want to mix it up a bit, it works great as a stir in with plain oats or cereal and lasts two servings that way.

review/summary: Kentucky Spirit is Kentucky bourbon at a higher level
review/text: Wild Turkey is good Kentucky bourbon whiskey and Kentucky Spirit is Wild Turkey's top of the line expression in regular production:  Master distiller Jimmy Russel's statement product.  It's a single barrel selection with the barrel and rick numbers on each neck label served up at 101 proof to keep most of the cask goodness intact.  I was expecting it to be good.  It exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />In the glass it's a dark coppery bronze color.  The nose is rich and complex and evolves strikingly through time.  Time is a big factor here.  This stuff is 101 proof and has a lot of alcohol to disperse.  Initially, the aroma of butter - as in brown butter and buttered corn is striking.  As it opens up, sweeter sherry, treacle, pecan pie, citrus and floral notes join in.  It's a positively delicious aroma.  First sip shows a toffee sweetness that explodes across the palate with apple flower, toffee frosting, maple candy, citrus spritz and vanilla oak.  It's a paradise of plant esters in a distilled spirit.  Finish is long and complex with unfolding layers of aged sawn wood, perfumed sweetness, bitter orange/dark chocolate fudgy notes and spicy spirit.  The glow in my mouth lingers for many long minutes, decaying into oak and toffee coffee bittersweet.  It's what bourbon is all about - yet it's quite rare at this price point.<br /><br />This is among the finest bourbons I've ever tried.  It's right up there with rare limited editions in sophistication and distinction.  Yet it treads a careful line through its disparate flavor elements, staying balanced among sweet and dry, floral and woody, bitter and sweet.  What a masterful performance.  I could drink it every day.  Comparable quality in Scotch whiskey or French Cognac would cost multiples of what you get for less than a U.S. Grant note here in the US.  Beyond the bargain aspect, the richness of flavor and complexity and balance of presentation shows that American distillery at the high end gives nothing up to the masters of the old world.  This is a first rate distillate - right up there with the world's best in refinement and sheer yumminess.  Jimmy Russel, I take my hat off to you.

review/summary: My dog loves these - they help his teeth stay clean
review/text: I originally started my dog with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004WBZ47C">Paragon Hedgehogs</a> - made of the same substance at the toothbrushes, but in a larger form factor - when he was a teething puppy about a year ago.  At that time, he was really slow to finish an entire Hedgehog, but once his adult teeth came in, the thing would be gone in a day and that was way too much dental chew to be ingesting at a time.  Now we give him one toothbrush a day after dinner.  He'll spend half an hour looking for the perfect hiding spot for it and then give in and eat it.  He loves these "toothbrushes" and gets so excited when we give one to him.<br /><br />These treats are made from vegetable starch and have a mild smell like potatoes.  They are currently made in Holland.<br /><br />The "toothbrushes" come in a few sizes. Our pup is 15lbs and we give him the "toothbrushes" from the "small 28ct" bag.<br /><br />The one issue I have with these chews is that they contain titanium dioxide (for coloring) which some studies show is toxic in large quantities.  I'd prefer if they left this ingredient out but unfortunately I've found that nearly every dog chew has something questionable in it.

review/text: Our three dogs love these chews, which we alternate with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CE9I9S">Sam's Yams Big Boyz Sweet Potato Dog Treats, 1-Pound Bag</a>. A daily dose of these chew treats seems to minimize the tartar buildup. We usually feed this medium size to our two 50 pound-ish dogs and the large size to our 65-lb Aussie/Chow mix. We appreciate the all veg, highly digestible ingredients and great chewing action (they're good and chewy, but not hard enough a dog might break a tooth on them), and the fact they're made in Holland, while our dogs seem to appreciate the flavor and gum-massaging action. Be sure to have plenty of fresh water available for your dog, as ours always enjoy a good long drink after finishing their chew treats.<br /><br />This product comes in a variety of sizes, and the sizing information isn't always clear. The "product dimensions" given here describe the size of the PACKAGING, not the product. For clarification, these Paragon medium-sized Star Toothbrushes measure 4" long and 1 1/8th" wide at their widest point (the base of the "handle,") while the large size are 5 1/2" long and 1 1/2" wide at their widest point. I hope that's helpful.

review/summary: You pay for what you get.
review/text: I bought this product because it looked like a great deal: 5.5 ounces of ceremonial grade matcha green tea for about $14 with free shipping. I liked what I got - at first. It was sweet, had a good umami flavor, a little seaweed-taste, and almost no bitterness. I took a good look at the label and I understood why it tasted very different from the matcha I had before. This tea is mixed with a good amount of brown rice powder. It is definitely not pure matcha. It has more of a brownish look to the powder, not the bright or dark green color that I'm used to. I'm not buying it again. Not the best. You get what you pay for.

review/summary: Sort-of Matcha... OK for smoothies
review/text: If you've ever had real matcha, this will be a disappointment. The powder looks like a light grayish-green. It tastes suspiciously bland and sweet compared to even 2nd harvest matcha. On the plus side, it doesn't clump like real matcha - it dissolves quickly and easily in even cold water. I don't get quite the "boost" I do from pure matcha, and having the rice syrup additive adds sugars that I'd prefer to omit, but if you're making a smoothie that will have fruit or some glycemic sweetener anyway, it's a good economical option.

review/text: You know, I was sceptical initially.  I am a coffee afficiando - I'm part Cuban for Godsakes.  My wife has been using these k-cups for about two years or so, and I've always turned my nose up at her quick cups.  But I've been too snobby.  I tried one the other day - I had my usual ground and pressed large cup in the morning, and was looking for another smaller cup in the early afternoon.  I didn't feel like pulling out the burr grinder, french press, and boiling the water.  So I poppped a cup in when the wife was out in the garden and tried a cup.  Whatta ya know - not so bad at all.  Good flavor - definitely not just "dark water."  It was a good cup of coffee.  Now, of course, it is not the same as the cup I get when I go through what I go through for the near perfect cup I shoot for every early morning.  But for a not-so-bad quick cup, the Keurig system and these k-cups deliver.

review/summary: Definately not what I was expecting
review/text: I've enjoyed Jamaican Blue Mountain from the Amber Estate for a number of years but as its price climbed to at times over $75/lb. I had to look for an alternative.  The description of Reggie's Roast Panama Blue sounded like it might fill the bill, unfortunately, this was not the case.<br /><br />Top quality Blue Mountain coffees are most often given a light, mild roast which allows their nuances to gently fill your senses with an essence I can only describe as honeyed liquid gold.  Reggie's Roast Panama Blue is said to be a blend of Jamaican Blue Mountain and Panama Boquet coffees.  I suspect it contained very little of any Blue Mountain coffee, much less a "blue" from the top quality estates.  I found the roast to be darker than expected and the result was a somewhat coarse coffee with chocolate over-tones that had none of the light, bright honey notes I had expected.<br /><br />It was worth a try, but this coffee just doesn't do it for me.

review/summary: Great on his system but no breath improvement...
review/text: My basset hound LOVES these - we give him a half a check-up bone each morning when he goes in his crate (and now he goes RUNNING into his crate after walks with his leash still on.) He gobbles them up, and best of all, they don't bother his sensitive tummy like every other dental chew we have tried! Another major plus, is due to the white color, they don't stain our carpeting! The only downside I see to these, is that they don't seem to freshen his breath. Smelling the bones individually, they don't really smell particularly minty or like anything that might freshen the breath either. If your dog has bad breath that stems from poor oral health, these may help. But, if your dog just has dog breath from his food, these aren't going to give you much improvement. That said, it is very hard to find dental chews that don't have harmful ingredients for dogs with sensitive systems, and these work beautifully!

review/summary: BEST TREATS OUT THERE!
review/text: A friend gave a bag of these to me as a Christmas present for my dog (a German Shepherd), and she loved them so much I had to ask where she got them.  They don't sell them at PetsMart or at any of the grocery stores I shop at, so now I have her pick them up for me at Costco, since I don't have a membership.  I agree 100% with what the other reviewers are saying - the treats work like a charm to keep teeth clean & breath fresh, and the doggie is nuts about them.  But they ARE too pricey on Amazon - I don't understand why they have to be $22-$25 a bag, when Costco sells the same exact product for about $10 per bag.  They do work though, and I use mine as a 'bedtime' treat.  She gets the bone as a reward for going to her bed (the crate) at night, and it's hilarious because no matter where in the house she is, as soon as I say it's time for bed she literally sprints to her crate!  Just because she knows she's getting the bone as a treat.  Wonderful product!

review/summary: Bones to clean doggies teeth must taste good
review/text: My fussy little mix (yorkshire/shihtzu) will not eat or accept anything he does not like.  He won't accept treats on a general basis and nixes all hard food.  Poor little fellow came into my life with a set of bad teeth and since has had many extracted.  So, chewing on hard and large items is not a possibility.<br /><br />The good news is that he has actually accepted "Checkups"  and I am thrilled because maintaing what few teeth he does have is a challenge.  The bad news is that I have to cut them into bite size for him and this is not easy.  So, if the product came in smaller bits for little dogs it would be good.  If they were just a tad easier to use, I would give it all 5 stars!

review/summary: Not like Claim Jumper
review/text: Claim Jumper restaurants use Helen Grace's Fudge Topping on their Mud Pie dessert. I had this dessert recently and liked the fudge accent so well I decided to buy some. Unfortunately, my experience at home was that the Fudge Topping out of the jar tastes different from the topping at the restaurant, it's far sweeter out of the jar. It also seemed to be of a different consistency. The Fudge Topping out of the jar, even though it started out warm and smooth, froze instantly into unappetizing globs on top of the ice cream. I'm not sure what the explanation is for these differences, although I suspect Claim Jumper somehow tweaks the topping before serving it. At Claim Jumper on top of their Mud Pie, it's fabulous, but at home, out of the jar, this topping was a disappointment. Helen Grace does offer refunds though and their customer service is excellent, and that's why I gave them two stars.

I remember they used the Helen Grace sauce, so I ordered a small jar to see if this was the same thing.  I was so happy when I tasted that same yummy taste of thick, rich hot fudge sauce over my ice cream!  I did warm it up so I could just pour it. I will definitely be ordering this in a bigger jar for my family to enjoy!

review/summary: sometimes too fresh..
review/text: this food is great my dog has been on it his whole entire life since his breeder put him on it. but the only downfall is, getting a moldy bag. chicken soup uses everything fresh and if its not cooked all the way and packaged a little big undercooked taa-da moldy bag of food. well i was out of the area and my pup ran out of food. so i called chicken soup, they advised me that the closest dealer was 30 miles away...ok drove there got the bag went home, opened it up, all moldy and smelly. had to drive back get another bag. of course i opened it up before i went home and it was fine. the company is great very willing to make you happy. i called the company let them know i got a bad bag of food. they sent me a 40 dollar check for another free bag. so later that night about five minutes away from my house i went to a pet shop ive never been to. well they had the food. ugh i was so mad called the company again, told them your selling food here and its not listed blah blah told them my story. but even if the date is fine you may want to open the bag at the store to see if the food is fresh.

review/summary: dog loves it, improved stool and reduced amount of food
review/text: I have an almost 11 month - lab weim mix - who is close to 100 lbs. When I got him he was on some high protein food from the feed store. I switched to purina puppy for large breed and he had loose stools. I then moved to wellness, pricey! and still loose stools...and ate a ton with ribs still showing. vet said it was fine but I felt like he was semi-starving. searched around on the net and saw this, saw it was wayyyy cheaper then wellness (and their bag is 5lb less) but got the same or better marks on the dog food rating website for being all natural. got it, dog loves it and his stools are much firmer. he still eats a ton (he is a large, active, growing puppy) but he has filled out - no more ribs showing than the bottom two slightly which is better than all of them. I will definitely keep buying this. I can't find it locally so just get it from amazon but with free shipping, its almost easier having it delivered to my door.

review/summary: Great Food at a Great Price!!
review/text: I began my search for the perfect puppy food after finding out that Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet and other so-called "Premium" pet foods are basically the same junk as Kibbles 'n Bits, but with a premium price. My research led me to the Wellness brand, which is a great food but a bit on the pricey side. I stumbled across Chicken Soup and decided to compare the two, since the price was much more reasonable, but I honestly didn't expect it to come close to Wellness. "Chicken Soup" really blew me away! The ingredients are just as good, if not better, and my pups LOVE it. My only complaint is that the bag tears very easily, but if cheaper packaging keeps the price down I will live with it HAPPILY. I highly recommend this food, and I will be staying with this brand when my pups are old enough to transition to adult formula.

review/summary: Excellent Puppy Food
review/text: Before I commit to purchasing an item, I do research on the product. Choosing a food brand for my lovable German Shepherd puppy was no exception. It was while I was scouring the internet for reviews on selective dry (kibble) large breed dog food for puppies, I came across several respectable websites that ranked Chicken Soup for the Puppy Lover's Soul at the top of its category. Compared to other brands that rank highly in puppy kibble, like Orijen, Innova and Wellness, Chicken Soup offers quality food at an affordable price. As the kibble is high in meat content and contains quality grains, and my puppy loves it, Chicken Soup for the Puppy Lover's Soul is a brand I recommend.<br /><br />In the instance your puppy dislikes this food or has an allergic reaction to some of the ingredients, be sure to consider the following when deciding on another dog food:<br />1. Always gradually transition to the new food. Over a period of days, balance the quantity of old to new food (75% old/25% new; 50% old/50% new; 25% old/ 75% new). If you do not do this, your puppy will have loose stools and possibly feel sick.<br />2. The main ingredients. There needs to be plenty of meat products, and if there are grains, check to see if they are high quality whole grains. Usually, a good indicator of the quality of a product is the first few ingredients listed. If these are meat, like the chicken, turkey and chicken meal of this product, then this should be a food to consider.<br />3. Try it out for a few weeks. If your puppy does not like it, feels sick, has loose stools or a dull coat, the dog food is not good for your puppy. It doesn't matter if the food is the best food; it is not good for your puppy and you should not continue to feed it.

review/summary: REDICULOUSLY fast shipping!
review/text: I know Chicken Soup is a great brand- our adult Great Dane loves it, so I ordered a bag for the Dane Puppy we are getting for Christmas.  No ability to review the actual product yet, as we don't have the puppy yet, but I'm sure it will be just as excellent as the Large Breed Adult formula.<br /><br />The REAL amazing thing about this product was the shipping.  I'm pretty sure that, even with Super Saver shipping, this product made it to my door within 36 hours of me clicking the "Submit Order" button!  That's nuts!  Thanks Amazon!  I'll never be driving 30 mintues to get this great food again- I'll just get it online (same price as I'd pay in the store after taxes are added) and save gas!<br /><br />UPDATE (03JAN12): We are mid-way through transitioning the pup from the crap food the breeders were feeding him to Chicken Soup (about 2/3 cup of each per feeding)...  he seems to love the taste, the kibble is just the right size for a great dane pup, and best of all...  his trips to go poo are already decreasing in frequency and it is getting easier to celan up (more solid).  Can't wait to see how much better it is when we are at 100% Chicken soup in another week or so!

review/summary: My Opinion
review/text: I was a Veterinary Technician for 12 years and my Vets have recommended this food to me for my own dogs. The Vets I worked for don't sell dog food like a lot of Vets do and this is the food they fed their own personal dogs. My dog has been on it his entire life (10 years old), he was on the puppy formula as a pup, then adult formula from 1-8 years old, and now he's on the senior formula which adds Glucosamine/Chondroiton in the food. He truly is the picture of health. He's a Yellow Labrador and he's in remarkably great physical condition, he even jogs 5 miles a day with me every single day. I have never had any problems with this food and my dog loves it. I love their ingredients (Chicken, Turkey, Duck, Salmon, etc.) most of which is their first ingredients and their quality is second to none, can't beat it for the price.

We switched from Nutro Ultra (which she liked) because of some questionable ingredients. This food had a higher rating and was slightly cheaper.

review/text: I bought this after doing some research on better quality dog food. Blue was recommended to me, but it was a little pricier than what I wanted to spend. This dog food provides my boxer/pit mix puppy with even more energy, a great shiny coat, and no more toxic farts or doggie breath from the underworld (I also put a little chlorophyll in her water so that also might be helping). All in all, I am happy with this dog food & placing another order. I wanted to go thru a whole bag before I reviewed it. Also the bag lasted for about 2.5 months with about 2 servings a day

review/text: I started my 6 month-old puppy on it and she instantly loved it. I'm happy with it because it's not full of undesirable fillers. I research the dog food I put my dogs on and am pleased enough with this brand to put all my dogs on it.Thank you, Amazon, for handling it!

review/summary: Made my puppy sick
review/text: I bought this puppy food based on the other reviews. Unfortunately, this food not only made my puppy have bad gas but he also had loose bowel movements that he wasn't able to control.<br /><br />I hardly ever write reviews but I do rely on other reviews before I make a purchase. I would not recommend this food! I gave this item 1 star because I couldn't give it zero. Buyer beware and good luck cleaning up after your puppy.

review/summary: Knorr Seasoning is very good.  Shipping is a bit much.
review/text: My local stores (Giant, Safeway, and Whole Foods) no longer carry this great seasoning so I had to find it online.  I was glad to learn that Amazon had it, but they were only handling it for a third-party supplier.  The third-party supplier charged a reasonable price of $4.59 for a 3-ounce shaker of Knorr Aromatic Seasoning, but the shipping and handling charge of $8.64 for one shaker seemed silly.  I ordered two shakers for $8.87 in S&H costs, which felt a little better but still was a but much since the two items weighed only 6 ounces.  One would expect that if a clerk is going to gather one item for shipment he could just as quickly and easily gather and pack two of the same item with virtually no additional time or effort required.  Since I couldn't find a better source, however, I ordered it here and was glad to be able to obtain the product.
