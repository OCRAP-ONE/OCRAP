review/summary: I love just about anything with lavender in it!
review/text: I've finished drinking 2 of the 6 boxes of Lavender Tulsi Herbal tea. I like this herbal tea as I enjoy the taste of lavender and am glad that the lavender is mixed with another herb as straight lavender can taste quite strong. I'm not sure I like the flavor of tulsi, but I guess it isn't so bad mixed in with the lavender.

review/summary: a bit disappointed...
review/text: I have purchased and enjoyed the Stash brand of teas for years...though never this mix of green and black chai. I was surprisingly disappointed with this blend. Can definitely taste the green tea more than I can taste the chai. For me, it's a weak blend of spices compared to what I usually enjoy in a chai. I felt confident (obviously) when placing this order of so many boxes, and wish I could exchange or return them. Been trying to doctor it up with added spices I have in the kitchen cupboard which helped a little, though decided to just give it away to friends and family who might enjoy.

review/text: Your nostrils will flare at the aroma of this tea from the opening of its envelope to the last drop of tea from your cup. Amazingly fresh-tasting (and smelling) mint tea. This mint tea tastes like it was grown and dried within the week. I prepare the tea with new water each time (I don't re-boil the water). I also make my tea using spring water vs tap water which contains chlorine. The tea is sweet tasting and I find I use less honey than with other mint teas. In addition to the high quality organic mint tea, I will comment on the subscription service I use to obtain this mint tea. I have subscribed to automated replenishment to make certain I am never out of this wonderful tea. The Amazon automatic replenishment service is very reliable and easy to adjust quantities and delivery frequencies. ENJOY!

review/summary: Great Green Tea!
review/text: I drink a ton of green tea and recently purchased this from Amazon.  I like to try new green teas every once and a while, but I think I found my new "everyday" green tea.  I was looking for an organic green tea without all the caffeine (since I drink it so much) and believe this is probably the best green tea I have ever consumed.  FYI: I only drink this green tea cold and use 5 or 6 bags to make a gallon.  Buy this green tea with confidence if you like to make a pitcher and drink it over a couple days.

review/summary: Natural, Mild, Subtle Chamomile Tea
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers--that's all! Although I do like this, it means that the tea is rather weak, but still a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little mild and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker!<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for about 37 years, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****

review/text: I was a little skeptical at first, but that thought was soon halted.  It is almost like a two for one deal. I get the relaxation of chamomile tea while smelling lavender.  I was so impressed I brought some to work and had everyone try.  I received mixed reviews.  What I did notice was that tea drinkers that preferred milk or sweeteners in their tea did not like.  While those that used honey loved it.

review/summary: Bitter Green Tea
review/text: First of all, the picture that Amazon has with this Organic tea is not the right picture. We are LONGTIME fans of the non-organic Stash Green Tea. In fact, we've probably tried more Green Teas than most people can even imagine. The non-organic Stash is the ONLY green tea that our family drinks.<br /><br />Now, about this organic. My mistake. I saw the picture and hit "add to cart" without reading the title. When it arrived, I thought "oh, boy" and quickly filled our tea jar with the bags of one of the six boxes. We eat/drink as much organic as possible, and I thought we were going to discover something new to add to our shopping list.<br /><br />What a disappointment. We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion -- and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The "burnt" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.<br /><br />So, we recommend that you try the non-organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.<br /><br />Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box. Perhaps, if we were willing to try another box, we'd change our minds . . . don't think it's going to happen . . .

review/summary: This tastes like CINNAMON OIL, not a traditional chai blend
review/text: Wow, was I looking forward to this after the great reviews. I got it today & made a cup right away. What a huge disappointment. The cinnamon oil is overpowering in a very unpleasant way. I cannot taste or smell any other spice. The green tea does come through a bit.<br /><br />I forced myself to finish the cup. I doctored it with extra fresh cardemom and fresh star anise. It was not worth the effort, it was as if I'd never put them in the cup.<br /><br />If you like true chai flavored tea and do not want the cinnamon to overpower your taste buds, this is NOT for you. Stay away from this stuff.<br /><br />Even from the perspective of the cinnamon flavor, this tea is not pleasant. I understand cinnamon is good for lowering blood sugar levels, so if you want to use this as a medicinal tea, I guess this would be acceptable.<br /><br />I can't send this back, so I'll be using it in a pot of boiling water for a cinnamon potpourri. I wouldn't even mix it with my other chai teas as there is just too much cinnamon oil.<br /><br />Stash would have been better off just using the real spices and skipping the oils. Now I am concerned about the green tea chai from Stash. I have some on order and they noted that they included clove oil. I'm hoping it won't taste like a cup of clove water.<br /><br />Very, very disappointed.

review/text: I tried this brand of green tea after drinking both Celestial Seasonings and Twinings green teas. This one had a very strong, very strange flavor. It almost tasted like a meat broth rather than a tea. I think another reviewer who described it as a "burnt" flavor may have gotten it right. I tried it once, and immediately switched back to Twinings. I recently tried a second bag, thinking maybe I overreacted the first time, but had to pour it away.

review/summary: This is a staple at my house
review/text: I love this tea!  I'd underestimated that, however, when I subscribed to the Stash organic sampler.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAQ">Stash Premium Organic Tea Sampler, Variety Pack of Eight Flavors, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>  I (mistakenly) figured that I'd still get enough of this to suit me, but was wrong.  Yes, I do enjoy the options, but even so, was too soon out of this one.  That's why I came here to subscribe to it.<br /><br />Many times only this particular tea will satisfy, such as first thing in the morning, or when I want an afternoon lift.  I was brought up with the old German custom of "tea time," where black tea was daily served at 4 pm., and so I've been a black tea fan for most of my life.  That tea was OK (it was all I knew), but this black tea is significantly better!  I'm attached to the taste, which carries the familiar acidic "bite" of black tea, but balances it with the alkaline health effects of green tea.  Like some others, I'd been initially put off by the black/green combo, wondering what to expect.  Now, however, I can say to anyone considering it, that if you like Earl Grey tea, then you'll love this version!<br /><br />For me, the flavor is best when the tea is piping hot (and less enjoyable if allowed to cool).  Consequently, I tend to brew it in an insulated stainless steel mug, which is then topped by a silicone cup lid (similar to the one at this link).  [...]<br /><br />Currently I'm exploring infused tea, being curious about why gourmet tea drinkers will tend to disdain bagged tea.  I just may discover flavors unexperienced!  Even so, I doubt this Earl Grey version will lose its high placement on my favorites list.  Simply put, it hits the spot.  Anyway, teabags are very convenient to use first thing in the morning!<br /><br />I've been a long-time fan of Stash (even before I switched to organic tea only), and so I've welcomed Amazon's prices.  With the addition of the "subscribe & save" option, this is an especially good deal.

review/text: I ordered this tea based on the glowing reviews, however in my opinion, the quality just is not there.  I usually drink Japanese brand green teas like Yama Moto Yama and Ito En, and sometimes the Chinese-American brand Triple Leaf.  This Stash organic decaf green tea is the worst green tea I have ever had.  It is a very bitter green tea compared to the brands I am used to drinking.  The color of the tea is not as green as the other brands I usually drink, but rather has more of a yellowish tone.  I had wanted to switch to an organic brand of green tea to avoid pesticides, etc. which may be found on the tea leaves of other brands, but this tea was a major disappointment.

review/text: This tea is excellent!  I like delicate teas just fine, but Stash's plain Honeybush is pretty bland.  The vanilla flavoring in this tea is subtle enough that you may not recognize it as such, but it rounds out and sweetens the flavor of the honeybush to give it a body that tastes like more than just muddled water.<br /><br />I don't care for most black tea because I find it bitter, and I fancy this my black tea substitute.  The flavor is warm, mellow, well-rounded, and has just a suggestion of sweetness and depth to it. Tazo Honeybush is also delicious, but has weird mystery ingredients (artifical and natural flavor, anyone?  Mmmm!)<br /><br />Unlike some of Stash's teas, this is also perfect iced or at room-temperature, with no filmy crust of flavoring and tea dust to form on top.  If you have ever liked a honeybush tea, I am confident you will like this one.  The flavor is also similar to rooibos, if you've tried that, but rooibos has a wider range of flavors it can adopt than honeybush does.  Honeybush is always, as its name suggests, just a bit warm and sweet.

review/summary: Try with lemon juice!
review/text: I was looking for a mild flavored tea that I could use to make a lemon tea and this organic chamomile tea is perfect. It does have a lovely aroma but I don't like drinking it without adding the juice of half a lemon and a packet of stevia. Then I add a little honey. I'd recommend using two tea bags for one cup or mug.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Lovely Green Tea
review/text: I was looking for an organic green tea that had not been grown in China or Japan.  I contacted Stash and was told this tea originated in Japan, but was grown in Brazil.  This organic green tea is amazing.  My first impression was that it contained a more generous amount of tea than those I had previously made tea with. When I pour boiling water on a tea bag, the green tea blossoms out even without dunking the tea bag.  I found the taste to be smooth and not at all bitter.  A single bag will easily make a small pot of tea.  If you were to seep a single cup for a while, it you might find it a bit strong. This is a notably lovely organic green tea that is grown in Brazil.

review/text: I have been drinking this tea blend for over a year and never grow tired of it.  Love the blended flavor and the oil of bergamot.  Being organic and fair trade certified is also a plus. To those of you who have tasted earl grey black and green teas separately and are curious about the mix--I would say the black tea flavor predominates, but the result is an extremely satisfying tea blend.

review/summary: The BEST green tea.
review/text: THIS is my morning addiction--not coffee.  I've been drinking green tea for years, and I've tried many brands.  I keep coming back to this one though.  One mark of its quality is that the brewed tea is actually *green*.  If your green tea looks brown, then the tea has oxidized and it is of much lower quality.

review/summary: My 'everyday' tea. :c)
review/text: I love the idea of having green tea everyday.<br /><br />...However, I thought this could never happen to me because I couldn't seem to enjoy it on it's own.<br /><br /> This is the first 'real' tea I have been able to honestly say; I LOVE. The smell alone makes me smile. It was my answer to wanting to be a 'real' tea drinker. I used to buy boxes and boxes of differing types of herb teas. But those are usually so boring. Almost like Kool-Aid without the guilt. *sigh* Peppermint used to be my 'safe' go to, when out with friends, but often times I found them to be weak or lacking. Stash organic black and green chai, really does it for me, and nearly everyone else I introduce this tea to, feels the exact same way: They wanted to be 'real tea' drinkers, couldn't stand the taste, found this and voila!<br /><br />I do add sugar so, it tastes more like desert than tea... but even when I don't add a bunch, this tea can actually take the 'less sugar' test. Can it hold up, without sugar?? Yes, even then, but, sugar is pretty much a must for me.<br /><br />All that said: Because of this tea, I now enjoy green tea on it's own! How that came about: Getting familiar the 'green tea flavor' when it tastes this fantastic, helped me familiarize with the flavor of green tea. After trying this, I moved on to Stash's 'Green Chai' so now I'm quite familiar with the green tea taste. Thus, I sometimes surprise myself and just drink plain old green tea! Hooray!!<br /><br /> TMI? Likely, but maybe someone will find this helpful and take the leap. :c)<br /><br />PS Thank you Amazon for making this available here!!! I could only find it in one store in my hometown (I store, I otherwise NEVER go to) and NEVER anywhere else! Imagine my joy finding it readily available here. :c)

review/summary: Time for Tea!
review/text: I have been buying this tea for a while from a local grocery store but it must be popular b/c it was often out of stock on the shelf so I decided to start buying from  Amazon to ensure I would not have a tea shortage.  Like one reviewer mentioned the bergamot or earl grey flavor is not as strong as some brands but this particular combination of earl grey black and green together is difficult to find especially in an affordable organic tea.  Prior to discovering this tea I used to use one earl grey tea bag and one green tea tea bag, but this product just makes it simpler.  This is also a great tea if you're like me and really prefer the taste of black tea but want to get the benefits of the green tea too.

review/summary: Better than Bigelow's Earl Gray Green
review/text: I was disappointed as I could not taste the bergamot like I can in Twinings Earl Grey. It was much better than Bigelow's Earl Grey Green and there was no bitter aftertaste. Maybe I expected it be more like the original Earl Grey. I was hoping that I'd like it as I would get the green tea benefits with the black tea taste, but the flavor still fell flat for me as it did not have the delicacy of Twinings. I think I'll stick to Salada green tea and keep my black tea Earl Grey. Salada doesn't have that hay like taste or the bitter aftertaste that some green teas have and it's inexpensive. Also, Celestial Seasonings has a Mandarin Orchard green tea that's really good.

If you're feeling hip, you could go down to your local shopping mall, go inside a Teavana store, and spend over $100 bucks on a fancy teapot.  Or, you could just buy a stainless-steel electric water heater for $10 and this tea for under $20.  I drink at least 2 cups of the stuff at work.  While it's super easy to screw up a good cup of coffee, it's impossible to screw up a good cup of Stash Early Grey Black and Green!

review/text: This decaf really disappointed me, esp. given the other glowing reviews.  It does not appear green, nor does it taste "green" (ie: doesn't have that fresh "grassy" flavor many describe as found in an authentic Japanese green tea).  Actually, this could be a good paring with seafood, because  I sometimes detect a slight fishiness in the taste.  Yuk.  Stash Decaf Green, the non-organic, non-premium tea, is actually a little better than this one.  What people like is a matter of personal taste, but I won't ever buy this tea again.

review/summary: Cuppa Green
review/text: Like many regular tea drinkers I prefer the loose-leaf variety when I am at home, but the afternoon cuppa at work calls for something a little less complicated.  I am OK with sacrificing flavor for convenience, while saving some pennies at the same time.<br /><br />So far, I have been pleasantly surprised by Stash's brands of Certified Organic green teas.  I have drank both this straight green tea and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDK6">Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey Black and Green Tea</a> combination.  The teas come from the Yamamotoyama Brazilian tea gardens, which were initially planted with Japanese seedlings.  The processing methods and standards are all based on Japanese system.<br /><br />The flavor of this Premium Green Tea is really nice, with a subtle grassy flavor that I enjoy in decent green teas.  I find that too many American-produced green teas are "watered down" in flavor, lacking the oomph that one finds in a true Japanese or Chinese green tea.  This cup, however, is close to the real thing. It also gives off a nice green color, which is always a good sign.<br /><br />By no means the best tea you will ever drink, but this Premium Green Tea might just possibly the best inexpensive tea-bag style green tea on the market.

review/text: I ordered this product thinking it was the Le Gout Chicken Base I love so much. When I got it, the first thing I noticed was the color was a bright mustard-yellow instead of the darker-colored one I was used to. Comparing the labels on the bottles, I then realized this was a "chicken flavor base" instead of "chicken base". Comparing the ingredients, you can see that chicken is not even listed as an ingredient, only chicken fat. Since this is a grocery item it cannot be returned. My mistake, just don't want anyone else to make the same one I did.

One caveat:  It stains badly if you spill it so it's best to keep it away from any heirloom tablecloths you may have.

review/summary: Fabulous Hibiscus TEA!
review/text: I haven't had Hibiscus tea before, despite living in Hawaii for a long time.  I saw Dr. Oz recommend it for high blood pressure and lowering cholesterol, as well as other benefits.<br /><br />I drink regular tea all the time, every day.  But it has caffeine and I try to reduce my caffeine intake.  I received my order very quickly and was surprised by the volume, but had to remember these are whole flowers.  I brewed my first teapot (I only drink iced tea), and was SOOOOoooooo happy!  I sweeten with stevia, so i sweeten the whole pot and then pour over ice cubes.  I was so pleasantly surprised.  It is absolutely DELICIOUS!  and no caffeine.  These blooms are just FIRST rate!  I Highly commend this product and will purchase again.  It's just Great!

review/text: I have to get this for my son because it's the only one he likes.  I tried to get him the "Bare Fruit" chips which are in my opinion tastier and also made in the USA but they are definitely hard to eat for a 2 year old (plus the bag doesn't have a Mickey Mouse on it...sigh).  So, these are good and easy to eat and all is great if the severely faulty Chinese quality controls don't fail yet again.  It worries me that these come  from a country that has sent us deadly toys, deadly toothpaste, deadly baby formula, deadly dog food and treats, amongst many others, but hopefully he'll outgrow these ones quickly.

review/text: The original title of the Jumbo Sunflower seeds stated 12 per case. I ordered them based on that information, figuring out the cost of each bag I would be paying. When I received them, the case only had 10 bags. I wrote to them TWICE and received NO response. I expected a refund for the two missing bags or for them to send me two additional bags.  But they didn't even have the courtesy to reply.  Since then, I see they have changed the title to "10 bags".  However, the description still says 12.  Be aware you will only get 10 and it's a horrible price to pay for such small bags.

review/summary: Very Handy. Quick And Easy. Rather Bland Taste.
review/text: The little grocery store where I shop had a display of Kraft Easy Mac macaroni and cheese in 2.05-ounce cups. So, I thought I'd test a couple. I've always liked their boxes of easy-to-fix macaroni and cheese and these would be really handy to have in the pantry shelves. Well, on the first one I really screwed up on the instructions. It was my own fault. I put the cheese powder into the water before microwaveing, not after. It was a disaster. The mixture boiled over and filled the microwave tray. What a mess, but I earned it. The next time I carefully followed the instructions and all turned out well. In 3 1/2 minutes, it was done to perfection, and quite easy, I might add. The mac and cheese tasted rather bland, not nearly as good as the brand I had been using. But, it certainly was quick and easy and in a nice one-serve container. Very handy.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

If I was a big fan of garlic I would have given it a 4-5 star rating, but since the type was labeled "original" and not "garlic" it was an un-welcomed surprise.

review/text: If you are one of the beef jerky lovers who really enjoys the soft tangyness of beef jerky that is most resembled in terriaki flavored beef jerky, you should know that it is extremely hard to find such kinds. Sometimes it's just sheer luck that you get a bag of the same texture you want. To me, I felt that this beef jerky wasn't as good as some of them but definitely better than a lot of the main brands out there. This bag, has a LOT of beef jerky, and it is somewhat soft. However, it isn't like chewy/tangy and is still a little dry. Some people like it, but to me the texture is not great. The flavor profile though is delicious.

review/summary: good Amazon value
review/text: whenever Amazon sells Jerky under $1 per ounce, I always like to sample it.  I recall seeing this brand at my local Target over $1.50 per ounce (BTW - Target's $1/oz house brand Pepper Jerky is great).  I tried Wild Ride's Peppered and Hickory, since sweeter flavored Jerky are rarely done right.  Peppered is always a safe flavor to try since few makers can screw that up, and this one did not disappoint - very nice balance of pepper and smoke without downing it in salt.  the Hickory tasted like pickled meat with a strong dill and parsley aftertaste, while being way too salty and moist.  both had about the same gristle percentage than that cheap import Amazon sells from World Kitchens Jerky.  If you like your Jerky drier, just leave it in the fridge in an open bag for a few days.  I'd call the Pepper a 3 star jerky, and the Hickory 2 star jerky, that both earn a bonus star as long as it's available under $1/oz.  One annoying thing about the package - the ingredients list is microscopic - sort of makes you wonder what they are hiding...
