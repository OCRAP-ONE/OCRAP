review/summary: A lovely soft cookie with a generous chocolate shell
review/text: Nice gingery flavor.  Soft cookie.  Generous dark chocolate coating.  Very high quality dark chocolate.  I liked each flavor and texture on its own, but I'm not convinced that ginger and dark chocolate are the best pairing.  That's just my opinion.  If you like that combination, you will love these.

review/summary: Tasty cookie if you need a gluten-free or vegan option.
review/text: These Lazy Day dark chocolate ginger cookies are free of any gluten, wheat, dairy, and eggs.  You would think a cookie without these ingredients might taste like cardboard.  But I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  While the cookie isn't crisp and tastes slightly stale, the flavors work well and it's a tasty treat.  The ginger is subtle.  The dark chocolate isn't of the highest quality, but still enjoyable.  If you require a cookie without these specific ingredients, you will likely be happy with this purchase.

review/summary: Tasty Ginger Cookies !
review/text: "Lazy Day Chocolate Gingers" (8 in a box) [from Lanarkshire, Scotland] remind me of a gingersnap cookie that has been covered about a third with Belgian dark chocolate.  The ginger taste is strong, but not overpowering - but like a `snap' of ginger at the back of the mouth.  This cookie is not as `firm' as the basic Gingersnap, making it a more of an enjoyable eat rather than trying to break through the hardness of the fondly remembered Gingersnap cookie.  The old-fashioned one seemed to be more of a thinner, HARD wafer, this is more of a thicker, softer [medium, moderate-size] cookie. The box said that they were good for another year, but maybe due to the heat this week they seemed a little crumbly.  The box claims that these gingers are: "Gluten, wheat, dairy and egg free.  Suitable for coeliacs and vegans" but "contains soya".  Much better than the original.  Caveat: I did receive a free box of them for review.)

review/summary: They surprised me
review/text: I don't need a gluten free product, but was surprised when I tried them.  I love dark chocolate and I like ginger flavored cookies.  So it was a pleasant surprise to try these and like them.  I was afraid they would taste bad and I would have to throw them out, so when I tried them, I ended up liking the chocolate and delicate ginger flavor.  Great job!

review/summary: Very Disappointing
review/text: In theory these sounded very good - in reality, they were a huge disappointment.<br /><br />The ginger taste was very mild, and was unfortunately overpowered by the chocolate.  It seemed overly sweet, which was a surprise since I had expected Belgian chocolate to be less so.<br /><br />Also, the cookie itself wasn't as crisp as it could have been.  The overall texture wasn't enjoyable.<br /><br />This could just be my taste, but I think it would be much better if the cookie was a crisp "snap" type, and if the chocolate was more semi-sweet.<br /><br />With all this said, there is a chance that the cookie suffered from poor storage/packing.  Perhaps it was just going stale, and if a fresh cookie had been sent, it would have been crisper.  If that is the case, then I didn't get to taste the cookie at its best - maybe it typically is much better.

review/summary: Tasty cookies which were poorly stored & improperly marked
review/text: These cookies are quite tasty. The ginger is there but it's subtle & not over-powering. The cookie is just a bit chewy, which is nice for texture.<br /><br />Although I could recommend the cookies on taste alone, I can't recommend them due to the condition in which they were received. The chocolate had melted & re-hardened at some point, perhaps more than once. The cookies were stuck together, and the chocolate was mis-formed. To make matters worse, the chocolate had bloomed & had the tell-tale signs of white. Chocolate bloom is characteristic of storing chocolate in warm conditions and of improperly tempering chocolate.<br /><br />Moreover, the manufacturer placed a batch sticker (050411) over the nutritional information on the back of the box. I attempted to peel back the sticker but still could not read nutritional information because the sticker did not come off. I have no idea how many calories are in the product, much less fat grams or fiber grams. Because the FDA required that nutritional facts are displayed on convenience foods sold in the US, a food manufacturer really should know better than to slap batch stickers over nutritional information. Likewise, Amazon should know better than to make improperly marked food products available for sale.<br /><br />I give these cookies 4* for the taste but took off 2* for condition. I took another 1* off for lack of nutritional information.<br /><br />Simply, I don't recommend.

review/summary: Not a bad tea cookie
review/text: As a celiac, I'm always keen on finding new gluten-free treats, so I was very excited to order these chocolate ginger cookies from Lazy Day Foods. I was a little surprised they were manufactured in Scotland, but they seemed fresh enough upon arrival. The chocolate had melted somewhat in-transit so that the cookies were stuck together, not that that's a bad thing.<br /><br />The combination of ginger and chocolate is a bit unusual but I kinda like it, especially since the ginger taste is fairly muted. The chocolate is a medium-dark, not especially bitter but certainly deeper than most mass market chocolates, and it overpowers the ginger. The texture is crispy and the cookies crumble fairly easily, so they're suited to dipping in tea or cocoa.<br /><br />Altogether it's not a bad cookie, but it is a special-interest item and is priced accordingly. I may get these for a special occasion but it won't be a regular purchase.

review/summary: These are pretty good, a nice surprise
review/text: OK, so I have to eat gluten-free for strict medical reasons, not just to be a fashionable gluten-free dieter.  Always eager to try out a new gluten-free food, and especially a dessert item, I jumped on this one.  I had not heard of the brand or product prior to finding it at amazon.  Dark chocolate ginger...hmmm, sounds great, and gluten-free at that, it sounded promising.  So I just received the package today.  As I've seen before with cookies and chocolate, there was a bit of melting of the chocolate.  Not bad enough to ruin the experience, but it was worth noting.  Definitely don't leave the delivery baking in the sun on your porch on a sunny summer afternoon.  What I found once I pulled the cookies apart is that they don't crumble like some gluten free cookies can do, these were firm and mildly crunchy.  The ginger and chocolate were a nice mild flavor, the ginger having just a bit of that ginger sort of bite to it.  I liked that these cookies didn't have a bad aftertaste, they didn't taste like cheap ingredients were used.  I thought also that I'd really like to have one of these with a cup of coffee, that the ginger and chocolate would be complemented by a medium roast brew.  All in all, I'm happy to have found another tasty gluten-free treat.  I'm also pleased that amazon carries it, as their customer service has always been very responsive with any product or delivery issues.  So, if you like ginger and chocolate flavors, and you prefer gluten-free foods, this one is worth a try.

review/summary: Very good cookies
review/text: I shared these cookies with my family and we all enjoyed them.  As others have noted, they arrived in relatively poor condition, looking as though they had been overheated and handled roughly.  This made them rather unappetizing to look at.  One of the cookies was broken into several pieces.<br /><br />The ingredients were along the lines of what I expected for a non-wheat cookie.  The oil used was not identified, but everything else was clear.  Sweetness is provided through golden syrup- replacing corn syrup or other less desirable artificial products.<br /><br />Opening the box, I immediately enjoyed the aroma of ginger cookies, and my doubts raised by the appearance of the cookies were thrust aside.  Each cookie is half coated in wonderful dark chocolate. We are a bit snobby when it comes to chocolate, but this chocolate left nothing to apologize for.  It was exactly what dark chocolate is supposed to be.<br /><br />The cookie itself is not terribly crisp- it has a texture more like a shortbread cookie.  I took this as resulting from its non-conventional ingredients.  The ginger flavor was about right and tasted "true."  It didn't taste artificial or overpowering.  While occasionally the chocolate coating could hide the ginger flavor, a nice ginger aftertaste always came through.<br /><br />I do not normally avoid gluten or wheat so for me this was a bit of an experiment.  I have to say that it was a successful one.  I did not miss the missing ingredients and would be happy to share these cookies with anyone without identifying their makeup.<br /><br />The condition after shipping was an issue, but I trust one that will be resolved quickly- leaving a great cookie in a good box.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Interesting Taste, But With A Few Problems
review/text: On the box, it says these cookies are crisp and gingery and they are dipped in Belgian chocolate.  The cookies were not at all crisp.  I can't tell whether they were not stored properly, and that's why they ended up with a somewhat soft texture, or if crisp meant something else to the manufacturer.  They really weren't even soft either.  They tasted more like they had been around for awhile, and were beginning to soften.  The ginger part was correct.  I like ginger, and I found these to be fairly gingery, but the taste wasn't there immediately.  After I had eaten half a cookie, I tasted the ginger, and it had a strong aftertaste, so it was a pleasant surprise.  I am a milk chocolate fan, and I wasn't sure I would like the darker Belgian chocolate.  It wasn't very sweet, but it too was better than I expected.  Let's face it, most gluten free baked goods are going to be disappointing if we expect them to taste like the things we remembered.  In this case, I had no frame of reference for this kind of cookie, so it was probably less of a disappointment to me.  They didn't taste like generic American cookies, so that was one point in their favor.  I would like to have had these fresh, so I had a better basis to review them. I don't like really crunchy cookies, but I don't like them soft to the point of sogginess either.  These veered towards the soggy end of the spectrum, but I actually did like the flavor.  It was different, and the somewhat sharp chocolate saved them from being boring.  These were made in Scotland, and they did have the kind of flavor that you would associate with a foreign foodstuff.  My kids used to buy a similar type cookie at the British market here in town, so if you used to like imported cookies, you would probably like these.  I think they are rather pricey for eight cookies, and unfortunately, the cookies did come all stuck together in the package.  Initially, I thought they were big sandwich cookies, but I don't think they actually are.  Had I seen these cookies in a store, I would have probably passed them by.  It's an awful lot of money for eight cookies, and I'd have been cranky at getting eight soft almost soggy cookies for the price. I didn't hate them, and I didn't love them either, but I don't know that I would buy them again.  If I could be sure of getting a fresh package, I might give them another shot, but as they are, no, definitely not.  If they could resolve the packaging issues, and ensure a crisper cookie I would like them much better.  Maybe a thin cookie would have produced a better crunch. Then again, a thinner chocolate dip would have been better too.  All in all, not horrible, but I think I will stick to baking my own, in the future.  Manufactured gluten free food is a matter of taste.  If you don't have the time, and you have the money, fine, but otherwise, spend some time in your kitchen.  They will be much less spendy, and you will get a larger yield, and the pleasure of doing something yourself.  If you have to buy a packaged cookie, I recommend Glutino's chocolate or vanilla sandwich cookies.  I prefer the vanilla, but my husband eats the chocolate.  They are really close to Oreos in the chocolate flavor.  It's the only kind I buy.  These were an interesting idea, but they weren't quite right.

review/summary: Not good.
review/text: If you even like this product...the bottle design doesn't allow one to effectively shake up the ingredients before pouring therefore you get all oil right off the top. I suggest pouring it into a bowl and whisking. It contains xanthan gum but it wasn't effective as an emulsifier. No one flavor stood out but I could taste the canola oil. I like tart and this isn't. With the sweetness of the fig, a bit more acidity would have balanced it out. I found the flavor cloying and unpalatable. I even tried adding wine vinegar to it but it didn't help. It ended up sitting in my refrigerator for over 6 months. I finally used some to baste the top of a pork roast and poured the rest down the drain. I still can't figure out why they added caramel color when balsamic vinegar is already dark and so is fig paste. Also, I bought this on sale (it was a discontinued item) at my store. I asked one of the managers why it was was discontinued and he said usually it's because the product was not a good seller. I can see why.

However, perhaps they did but did not care as the customer cannot return the item. I've used the other two bags but had to throw out the open one for safety reasons. DO NOT BUY!!!

Grape Kool-Aid is just awful, as are most of the other flavors.  This flavor would sell like wildfire.  Let's start an email campaign!  Let's make mango a truly mainstream flavor next to cherry, strawberry, fruit punch and grape.<br /><br />Right now we have a handful of packets left, but if we ever ran out and couldn't find any at our regular store, this sounds like an o.k. deal (much more than we usually pay, but it's worth it!).

review/summary: 96 packs??!!!  You better really like this flavor.
review/text: And I do.  I gave a negative review on Kool-aid's packaging of this product for another flavor, because I felt it was ridiculous, especially since you get two separately packaged boxes of Kool-Aid, which means they could sell them separately, if they chose to. I consider the price and the way a product is sold to be just as important as the product itself, so I'll leave that review there. That being said, I broke down and bought this flavor since I love Mango so much.  You'll love it even more when added to the pina-pinneaple flavor also sold on Amazon. Oh yeah, you'll have to buy 96 packs of those as well. Good luck finding these flavors in your stores.  I have no idea why my three favorite flavors (this one, the lime and the pina-pinneaple) are not to be found anywhere near me.  I live in la and you would think a product called "Aguas Frescas" could be found close, no? Anywho, you'll love the flavor and so long as you're willing to drink it for a couple years, it's worth the price. After trying to figure out what to do with 96 packs of this stuff before I got bored, I figured I'd mix some of it in my Vanilla ice cream in order to make a Mango-vanilla ice cream concoction that turned out to be pretty dang good.

Splenda tastes just like sugar with no bad aftertaste. We have changed to using slightly less than 8 cups of water to make the taste richer. We have also increased the Splenda to 12 packets (1/2 cup) to make it sweeter.<br /><br />Addendum: It is even better when mixed 50/50 with Pineapple <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZEBMO">Kool-Aid Aguas Frescas Pina Pineapple Unsweetened Soft Drink Mix, 0.14-Ounce Packets (Pack of 96)</a>.

review/text: This is one of kool aid's best flavors, my family and frieds love the taste, every other pitcher I make is mango. Have looked for it in four (4) surrounding cities and can not find it. Went back to store I originally purchased from (60 miles away) and they don't have it any more. Great price, with fast shipping.

review/summary: Versatile & Pleasant berry flavor black tea
review/text: I'm really enjoying this black tea with a good berry flavor  Even when I brew it very strongly it does not get the bitter edge some black teas do<br />I may not be quite as photogenic as the display photo  but is very flavorful. so far I've served  it as a dessert  and Tea , tea rather than as a dinner tea but it should do well with meals and I expect it would  be superb for a tea smoked duckling  variant.  It makes great iced tea as well as a good cozy comfy hot tea.<br /><br /> I bought it because I thought it would make a good winter holiday beverage which it will but I think it will become one of my favorite everyday teas too and I'm drinking it  ( iced) so fast during a autumn heat wave that I may need to buy more for the holidays.<br /> I think this will be the blend I use in  teetotalers' punch this Christmas

Those seeking a more flowery-flavored honey would probably prefer Savannah Bee's wildflower honey or the "Winter White" variety. A drizzle of tupelo is an excellent addition to plain Greek yoghurt.

The thing about this product is its vibrance, which quite frankly makes the grocery store brand seem dull. It's as if they infused in granule with as much Red-5 that they could pack in. Mind you sugar and artificial coloring aren't the best things for you, but they make for fun times with food. Would I recommend you to buy it, sure would. After all what do you have to lose, the bottle is cheaper then your store brand and with amazon prime there's no trip to be made to the store.

review/text: I have a Border Collie puppy and I plan to have her in agility training once she is old enough (at 14 months). I want her to grow up the healthiest and strongest she can be. I have done so much research on foods and this brand has a cool name [like Artemis Fowl ;-) ]. Her coat is so shiny and soft (even though she is a rough coat) and she is happy and playful all the time.<br /><br />The first four ingredients on the label at MEAT products. There is sufficient water content and probiotics included. Flaxseed and fish meal for the Omega 6 and Omega 3 essential fatty acids. The source of carbs and additional protein is from whole grains Barley and rice with Oatmeal and millet. It has fresh fruits and vegetables (which are important in the diet as well- I give my puppy apple slices and carrots to snack and chew/teeth on).<br /><br />I alternate brands occasionally depending on how tight money is that month. Another brand that my puppy eats and really likes is the "Chicken Soup for the Puppy Lovers Soul" dry and canned. I feed the Chicken Soup for the Cat lovers soul to my cat all the time. That brand is high quality and about $12 for a 10 lb bag. Very reasonable.<br /><br />Good luck on your dog food choice.<br />try searching the site "Dog Food Analysis".<br />Great informational

When I finally tried this brand of honey mustard, I was taken back AND delighted at the same time.  When I have chicken fingers, for example, I love to dip them in a honey mustard that is sweet and delicious.  THIS mustard is hot (just the right amount) and sweet and delicious!!  I like it better than regular honey mustard.  You should try it, but when you do, just know that you may never go back to regular honey mustard ever again...or even regular mustard mustard ever again!!  It is THAT good!!

review/summary: Easily the best mustard I've ever tried
review/text: Through out my life I've tried various mustard's and up until I tried this mustard, I never was much of a fan of mustard.  Either the mustard was too watery, too salty or in some cases, entirely tasteless.  Then I tried this mustard and this the only mustard I will use from now on.<br /><br />But not only is this the best mustard I have ever tried, compared to other mustard sodium content, this has the least.  Only 45 mg per serving and compared to other mustard's, that is extremely low.<br /><br />Sure there might be other mustard's that may very well taste good, but I like this one the best.  It should be noted I have tried organic, non organic, kosher, USDA certified and even have tried made to order mustard, but none of them were ever as good as this mustard.<br /><br />So if your looking for a break from regular mustard or just looking to try something new, I would recommend this mustard.

This cereal is dense and probably should not be consumed in large volumes at a sitting. There is a LOT of fiber and iron in it.  Other than that, it would be the perfect breakfast cereal. Unlike other high-fiber solutions, Grape-Nuts is versatile.  You can eat it cold with milk or heat it up in the microwave with said milk and enjoy a tastier alternative to oatmeal. You can sprinkle it on yogurt for a texture explosion in your mouth. I've even made bran muffins with them, and they are delicious.

My stretch goal was 10 minutes, though it took better than 20, and i was sabotaged by Dave who added more when i went to get water.  Realizing after the fact that this many Grape-nuts was representative of about 120% of my daily fiber and 360% Iron, not to mention 800 net calories or so pre-milk, i became slightly worried and have been slugging down water ever since.  I havent eaten Grape-nuts in a while, and must say, despite the extreme circumstances, i really enjoyed them, and will eat them again tomorrow assuming im hungry then.  They were tasty, slightly sweet, and not in need of any additives to enjoy.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: No grapes or nuts, but 100% delicious compact nutrition
review/text: Grape-Nuts are one of the oldest ready-to-eat packaged cereals still on the market today. Introduced in 1898, Grape-Nuts followed the first breakfast cereal (Granula) by a few decades, but stuck around much longer. They pre-date Kellogg's Corn Flakes by nearly a decade. Like Kellogg's early cereals, Grape-Nuts were initially marketed as a natural health food. Made from wheat and barley, without added sugar, they still pack a great deal of nutrition into a compact space. Each half-cup serving of Grape-Nuts contains 33 grams of whole grain, 48 grams of carbohydrates, 6 grams of protein and 7 grams of dietary fiber. They're low fat (1 gram per serving) and contain no trans fats.<br /><br />Grape-Nuts have a sweet, nutty wheat flavor and are very crunchy; too crunchy for some cereal eaters. The nuggets are small and soften slightly in milk. Those who prefer softer cereal can make hot grape nuts by adding a third-cup milk and microwaving the mix for 30-60 seconds. More time produces a softer result. Those who like something sweeter than the natural 4 grams of sugar per serving can add raisins, chopped fruit, a teaspoon or two of sugar, or sweetened soy milk. Their compactness also makes them a good pick for travel rations or backpacking, and a full serving is quite a bit smaller than for a typical flaked cereal.<br /><br />Grape-Nuts are great for breakfast, an afternoon snack or a treat before bed, and you can sprinkle them on yogurt to add some crunch! Recipes for Grape-Nuts bread, bars, pudding, muffins, tabbouleh salad and many other items can be found on Post's Grape-Nuts website and elsewhere on the Internet. [�2010 hyperbolium dot com]

review/summary: Good deal, good for you
review/text: I bought this 4-pack at about $12 or roughly $3/box.  If I've got a coupon and they're on sale at the local store, I can beat that price, but having them sent to my door "sweetened" the deal.<br /><br />I'm a border-line vegetarian and since I rarely eat meat, don't have that traditional source of iron in my diet.  Whole grain foods, like Grape nuts, help make up the deficiency, in this case a half cup providing 90% of the RDA of iron.  The fiber is also noteworthy, with a half cup providing 7g or 28% of the RDA, as is Folic Acid with 50% RDA.  A healthy list of other Minerals and Vitamins are represented in lesser quantities.<br /><br />This cereal is hearty, dense, crunchy, and tastes "healthy".  I'm not going to lie and say it's delicious or anything like that!  It'll give your teeth a workout. I like to throw on raisins or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YR7A9Q">Bob's Red Mill Shredded Coconut Unsweetened, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> to make it a little more palatable.  Sometimes I grind it in the coffee grinder and add to baked goods I make for additional nutrients.<br /><br />The Sodium is higher than I'd like at 290 mg per half cup (with milk 15% RDA), but the sugar is low at 5g per serving.  Ingredients: Whole grain wheat flour, malted barley flour, salt, dried yeast.<br /><br />The 4-pack arrived undamaged and the expiration date was just under a year away. If the price stays the same, I'd buy more in the future.

review/text: My title says it all.  I began appreciating this the older I got and the less enthusiastic I've become towards chemically-flavored or too sweetly flavored cereals (it has a nice, malty flavor to it, as well).  Yes, you do need decent teeth if you're eating this cold with milk (it sounds like you're chewing gravel), but like others noted, this can also replace hot cereal, since it's so easy to put this in the microwave with no-fat milk or almond milk.....it modifies into a really satisfying, soft and chewy oatmeal. You can also add a little bit of it to other less substantial cereals to make them more filling.<br /><br />And although it doesn't look like much in the bowl, about a third of a cup goes a long way. It's VERY dense and therefore very filling......each tiny box weighs a lb and a half, and that's not sugar weighing it down, either.  It's like the black hole of grain cereals ;-)<br /><br />This is close to $5.00/box in NYC, so using Subscribe and Save and having this delivered to my door makes this is a great deal.  AND it had an expiry date a year into the future, so no stale cereal here. Great job, Amazon.

I especially love that it's not sweetened, unlike almost every other cereal out there, which allows this cereal to be very versatile in cooking various dishes, not necessarily always sweet ones.<br /><br />Though I generally try to stick to low-carb foods, I occasionally indulge some Grape Nuts cereal with milk (or almond milk) & a touch of stevia sweetener as a treat. Has good fiber content. I love that it can be eaten cold or warm, crunchy or softened. YUM!<br /><br />This 4-pack price of just $12 is excellent. At the store a box costs me $5 each.

review/text: I love the convenience of ordering Grape Nuts from Amazon, but something has to be done with how they rotate their stock. I placed an order on 6/24/2011 and was very pleased that the expiration date of the cereal was 5/05/2012. Imagine my surprise when I placed a 2nd order on 12/21/2011 and the expiration date was 5/02/2012. How is it that 6 months later you are fulfilling with older cereal?

review/text: Much better price than I'm able to buy it for at local grocery stores (none of them carry these larger 64oz boxes). However, now that I'm trying to re-ordrer, it appears that Amazon will only ship it if I buy $25 worth of other stuff at the same time. I belong to Amazon Prime but it make no difference. First time I've encountered anything like this with them. Would have been five stars otherwise.

review/summary: Don't like cereal however LOVE Grapenuts
review/text: This cereal is crunchy, healthy, lots of fiber and so satisfying. I am not a cereal person, however this is not like other cereals.  No mush.<br />Many reviewers say they are paying $7.50 for 24 ounces.  Time for you all to look elsewhere or check out the "oversized" box/packages isle of your grocery store.  I pay $5.99 for 64 ounces at SaveMart (a grocery store who pays a living wage and is immaculately clean to boot).  It's been that price for quite a long time.<br /><br />When I crave sweets I eat a bowl of grapenuts.

If you have never eaten them... you may want to start small before committing to purchasing a wholesale bundle of this cereal.  My own fault for not doing so - I bought the 4 pack of 21oz. cereal.  A small handfull tasted tolerable out of the box, but a bowl full with milk tasted like burned acorns to me (yes, I've eaten burnt acorns).<br />Pros - plenty of fiber and very filling<br />Cons - Nasty taste (unless you already like this stuff, in which case you're not reading the reviews).

review/summary: Miracle Frooties are sooooo cool
review/text: Like most people, I was skeptical about trying Frooties.  I read a lot of articles about the product and watched many You Tube videos.  Curiosity finally got the best of me and I placed my order.  My order arrived today.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that they included a free Frootie in with my invoice as a thank you.<br /><br />I started by lining up a host of items: Lime wedges, Lemon Wedges, Star Fruit slices, Pure Vitamin C powder (incredibly sour), Plain Greek Yogurt, Sour Cream, Brussels Sprouts, Red Wine Vinegar, Tabasco Sauce & Vodka.<br /><br />I popped my Frootie in my mouth and swished it around for about 3 minutes.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to swallow my saliva so I just held it in my mouth the whole time then spit when I was done.<br /><br />First, the lemon wedge.  I took a bite and my eyes lit up.  It tasted like a lemon that someone had rolled in powdered sugar.  It was sublime.<br /><br />Next I tried the Lime wedge.  Again, you taste the lime but it tastes like a lime candy.  I started laughing.<br /><br />The Star Fruit tasted almost like a soft apple.  It was sweet and had a mild crunch.  I ended up eating about 4 slices of that.<br /><br />I mixed the vitamin c powder into a glass of water.  When I took a mouthful, I naturally expected a very sour taste.  Instead, it tasted like a light lemonade.  I was so curious that I actually stuck my finger directly into the Vitamin C powder and tasted it.  It tasted like a Pixi Stick.<br /><br />The Greek yogurt tasted tart still, but had a very pleasant sweet taste.<br /><br />What surprised me the most was the sour cream.  It tasted like a really creamy frosting...hard to explain but I had 3 teaspoons of it!<br /><br />The Brussels sprouts tasted like chestnuts.  I really enjoyed their flavor.<br /><br />The Tabasco sauce almost tasted like a V8 juice EXCEPT the tip of your tongue can still sense the heat.  So it was sweet, but the tip of my tongue told me otherwise.  I now realize why people shake it onto their tongue in the videos.<br /><br />The red wine vinegar still smelled very much like vinegar as I brought it to my mouth.  I had a hard time with that one.  But when it hit my tongue, it tasted like a port.  It is nothing I would drink, but I had to take a sip out of curiosity.<br /><br />At this point I was starting to worry that my stomach was going to pay me back, but it felt completely fine.  I journeyed on and tried a small sip of vodka, which simply tasted like water.  There wasn't much of a taste.  I imagine if you squeezed lemon juice into it, you would probably have a fantastic "lemon-drop".<br /><br />After my tasting spree I cleaned everything up, got a glass of water and went into the other room.  About 1 hour later I found myself going back to see what a Brussels sprout tastes like without the frootie.  I bit into one and it still tasted like a roasted chestnut.  To check myself I bit a small wedge of lime and it too still tasted like lime candy.  The effect was still working after more than one hour.<br /><br />I got online to order another package because I have organized a "Flavor Tripping Party" which is what these parties are called when you pop a frootie and serve all these bizarre foods.<br /><br />If you've got an adventurous spirit, give them a try.<br /><br />I hope my ramblings have helped answer someone's questions and motivated someone else to give them a try.

review/text: These tablets are the best brand I have tried so far, and they work very well. THe tablet itself does not taste so bad, and the effects last about a half hour with constant eating probably longer if you are not eating as much. I definitely recommend cutting up your food beforehand... or while you are waiting for the pill to dissolve (it takes about 7 minutes). Of the four people who I had try this, all of them felt very profound effects. Some recommendations:<br />>Oranges (my favorite)<br />>Lemons<br />>Mix lemon juice and water, it tastes like really good lemonade.<br />>Limes (still pretty sour, but still delicious).<br />>Grapefruit (NOT white grapefruit). This tastes like sex.<br />>Apple Cider Vinegar (Just a sip, it is still very strong, but it is worth trying it).<br />>(Mangoes Do NOT work very well)<br />>Lemon Juice tastes really good, still slightly sour but like a lemon drop candy.Put. It. On. Everything. EVERYTHING.<br /><br />Warning: Eating tons of citrus in a short period of time may give you a stomach ache, acid reflux, the runs, or death. It is totally worth it.

review/summary: Performed as expected
review/text: I was hoping to find a powdered version but settled with the tablets. We found that it was better to chew them down and let the granules melt on your tongue. After half of a tab was taken, we noticed a change in the taste of certain foods, but I think it might have taken a full tab to get the effect completely for some of the more intense foods.<br /><br />I have to admit that I don't like the resulting flavors. There's this kind of faux sweet, kind of nasty, artificial sweetener tinge to everything I tried and it left me feeling a little off, but I don't feel it was the product's fault or deficiency, so much as my personal tastes. Because of that, I rate the product with five stars because it did everything that was advertised. I only mention the distaste for its, um, taste, in case there is anyone else who feels ill from fake sugar flavors. The tabs don't actually have artificial sweeteners in them, but the taste effect they produce tastes (to me) reminiscent of foods seasoned with fake sugars. So sure, it's fun to try out a flavor trip, but unless you have serious designs to use this product for diabetic or dieting reasons, playing the 'taste game' hardly warrants the headache you get as you try to scrub the horrible memory of what balsamic vinegar chased with Equal tastes like from your tongue.<br /><br />Never... never... try balsamic vinegar on miracle fruit, even if you don't mind that Sweet'N Low flavor.<br /><br />So, the point is, if you can drink diet sodas, eat sugar free gum, and other artificial sugars without trouble, then the effect of foods on miracle fruit probably won't bother you. But if you're one of those people who can sense fake sugar in something a mile away and it gives you a major headache, then you might feel like me when I say 'weee, that was fun, but not really worth it.' and never try it again. It is fun to offer them to your guests though, and let them enjoy them, though.

review/summary: They're working great for me, so far.
review/text: Maybe these tablets work better for some people than for others. I've read some opinions online from people who said they didn't work for them, but they work just fine for me.  Only on foods that are sour or tart, though; these tablets really do make them sweet!  After coating my tongue with the pill the first time, I ate a lemon and it tasted like lemon candy.<br /><br />So far, I've found they work very well with whole lemons, lemon juice mixed with water, granny smith apples, yellow grapefruit, and salad with a simple vinegar and oil dressing (makes the dressing sweet without adding sugar).  They're okay with limes - makes them palatable but not quite as delicious as the lemons.  Red grapefruit just becomes too sweet, though; I didn't like the effect with that fruit at all.  With bland foods the tablets didn't make a difference.  They only seem to work on sour or tart foods.  But hey, if you're on a low-carb diet and want to minimize or avoid artificial sweeteners, this is one way to do it.<br /><br />Also, you really can cut these big tablets in half and just use half at a time.  That's what I've been doing and it's been working just well.  Oh, and as for the "cardboard" taste, yeah, the tablets aren't tasty.  Though I didn't get nauseous or anything from it, either.  It's just a bland taste, somewhat like cardboard, but what really matters is how it makes sour food taste afterward.  I personally have no problem taking them.

review/summary: They are amazing!!
review/text: I bought these already confident that they would work (I did my research). I was so excited when they finally came, I immediately opened it and immediately put half a tablet in my mouth (I didn't have a sour buffet prepared so I didn't wanna waste a tablet on dinner.) I must say I was shocked at the flavor of the tablet. I had read from various sources that the berry has no taste. I didn't realize this meant they tasted like PLANT. I felt like I had grabbed a stem from a tree and chewed on it. So, it was rather gross. But after tablet dissolved I grabbed a lemon, squeezed it into a cup, poured in some water and took a sip. It wa the sweetest lemonade I've ever had! I got curious and licked the lemon itself. It tasted like candy!! I got adventurous and put some lemon juice on my chicken. It tasted like I had soaked it in lemonade :/ the effect didn't last very long I think because I swallowed the sloshed pill too early and it was only half of it. So the lemon started tasting funny. Half sour half sweet. And my water tasted like watered down lemonade. I tried again with the othe half and had to stop myself from eating a whole box of strawberries, they were so good. Kiwis are also delicious. Let me just warn you that things taste sweet, but they still FEEL sour if that makes sense. I'm very happy with this product (except for the taste of the actual tablet) and even plan to use it for my brother's science fair project!! :D

review/text: I was very excited about this, but hesitant to believe some of the claims people had made.  I bought some unsweetened grapefruit juice, strawberries, pineapple, and a lemon.  The tablet took a long time to disolve, like how many licks to get to the center long, but it was worth it.  I ate the lemon, it was almost like an orange and it wasn't sour at all until about 15 minutes in.  The grapefruit juice tasted like it had a pound of sugar in it, and the strawberries tasted like icecream.  It didn't last quite as long for me as some reviews listed and I used the full tablet.  There were some residual effects for the next 30 minutes after sour started tasting sour again... like the tomato sauce in a slice of pizza tasted sweet.  Over all well worth the buy even for the novelty.

After 10 seconds or so, they were eating up lime wedges like no tomorrow.<br /><br />This one, in comparison, is like a standard hard tablet. Everyone sat around for several minutes waiting for them to dissolve.

review/summary: Twice the size, not even half as potent.
review/text: I love the novelty of miracle fruit tablets. I purchased another brand a few months ago and loved it. The sensation was that of eating fruit for the first time. Everything was sweet, and the sensation lasted about 30 minutes of some serious taste testing of really sour foods (Vitamin C powder was the craziest, it was like eating pixi sticks.)<br /><br />When I received this package of Frooties XL, I figured this would be as good if not better experience than before. I shared a few with some coworkers and while it did at first go as the tablets before, it wore off very quickly. Perhaps in the span of 5 minutes or so.<br /><br />The tablets are oval in shape and almost twice as large as the ones before, but I noticed the tablets tasted a bit different from the other brand. I couldn't be certain, but the mixture they form these tablets with could be binder heavy and less product overall. It could also be that during transport they degraded as it recommends you keep the product at or below 20 C or 68 F and it's warm in FL. Either way, I am sad that this batch for whatever reason was not up to snuff with what I had remembered.

review/summary: Try this to experience what seems impossible: sour = sweet
review/text: This is quite the novelty item.  People you try and explain it to, look at you like they are thinking... "ok, I hear what you are saying but I don't quite believe the conviction with which you are expressing how indescribably strange and pleasant the experience of eating sour stuff after miracle fruit can be.<br /><br />But then, when you get them to try it and then have a slice of lemon, you should see the disbelief followed by a "wow!" look that passes across their faces.  My favorite so far is plain sour yogurt.  its SOOOOOOO good!  My friend likes lemons, which she described as tasting like a lemon lollipop as she liked the lemon wedge.<br /><br />I almost gave this 4-stars because for a few hours afterward my tongue didn't quite behave normally.  Nothing too awful, but just felt a bit chalky or with a hint of bitterness to other foods I ate.  Nothing terrible, though, and after a while things were normal again.<br /><br />I had to give 5-stars in the end because this product is just to unbeleivable and everyone should give it a try at least once.<br /><br />it is pricey for what you get, but I found that to try it out 1/2 of one of the pills dissolved on your tongue is enough to experience it just fine.  It may not last as long, but you'll get the idea.

review/summary: Worked perfectly
review/text: I recommend that you use as small a portion of the tablet as possible at first, and try to contact that portion with every point on the surface of your tongue. There doesn't seem to be a lack of potency even if you use only 1/3rd or 1/4th of the tablet, but you have to remember to touch it to as much of your tongue as possible before it dissolves.

review/summary: Good Clean Fun
review/text: I hosted a party with 8 other people. As others have said, some experienced a stronger reaction than others, but everyone had some sort of sweet experience with these tablets. The favorites by far were the limes (even over the lemons), goat cheese with fig preserves (fig tasted like honey), blackberries, and stout beer. Things that didn't change much were the watermelon, bread, IPA (although it was slightly sweeter to me), tequila, vodka, and feta. The oranges were almost too sweet for most of us. All of the foods retained their essence, just without a sour taste.<br /><br />These worked exactly as advertised and the party was a hit. The experience lasted for about the hour it said it would. I recommend trying it at least once.

review/summary: Expensive but fun
review/text: I feel I was misled about the "1 lb. shipping weight".  At most this couldn't have weighed more than a few ounces, even with the shipping box.  It was so lightweight, for a moment, I thought there was nothing in the box at all.  The description doesn't say how much you get, so be forewarned, you will get just (10) TEN tablets in the box.  Not affordable for most people who are seeking help with low sugar diets, but I will say the tablets definitely enhance the flavor of strawberries.  I have not tried it with lemons yet as I don't have any, so I'm saving the rest of the tablets for when I have some more food to try.  I am looking forward to it.

review/summary: Weirdest thing ever!
review/text: The miracle frooties were so weird. I was a little unsure about if they were going to work or not, but it turns out they really do! It was expecting a lot more out of them, but i guess they will have to do. The only bad thing about them is when you eat lemons and limes your lips burn a lot and give your sores. Other than that these things are amazing!

review/summary: These Worked Really Well
review/text: After reading about miracle fruit and flavor tripping, I was eager to try it out for myself. I was somewhat apprehensive in purchasing these specific tablets based on other reviewers' experiences but they worked great! They seemed to be extremely potent and the effect lasted for about an hour. It was a fun little experiment.

review/summary: UNSWEETENED CRANBERRY JUICE.
review/text: Trust me on this. Possibly the biggest "WTF?!" experience of all with these little tablets. I got a bottle of it and then tried the juice as an afterthought after already trying limes, lemons, etc... It tasted like regular, old-fashioned ocean spray -- sweet and cranberry-y.<br /><br />A few hours later, I realized that I didn't know what the cranberry juice tasted like by itself...<br /><br />HUGE DIFFERENCE.<br /><br />Ordering a few more boxes to continue with the experimenting.

review/summary: They Work Great, With a Few Foods
review/text: These pills arrived a couple of days ago and I could't wait to try them.  I simply broke the pill in half and let it dissolve on my tongue for a minute or two.  I read a review earlier that said you could not actually eat a whole lemon, however I had 2 and would have eaten 3 if I wasn't afraid of throwing too much acid in my face. The pills themselves are about the size of a jellybean and have a dried berry taste (however the taste is not that strong).  I also tried orange juice, which was so sweet that it was gross.  The last thing I tried was a shot of vodka. The pills don't do much to mask the taste, although it did take the burning sensation away. The taste of the lemon was by far the best. It tasted like a very rich lemonade. Some people said it tasted like splenda, however I thing it tastes like you've added real sugar. Overall I would recommend this product to try, but after you've had all of the sour things you can think of there really isn't much use for them.

review/summary: Miracle Frooties Are Awesome!
review/text: I saw some mixed reviews for Miracle Berries here and just had to share that my experience was awesome. I ordered mine direct from Miracle Frooties ([...]) because I was worried about delivery in time for a birthday party. Their customer service was prompt and efficient and the order arrived just as they promised. My friends and I had a *BLAST* challenging each other to try weird and bitter things. There were folks of all ages, including young children, and it made for good, honest fun for everyone ~ giggles all around! :)

review/summary: So Cool!
review/text: I went looking for these after watching an episode of United States of Tara (Season 1, Episode 12: Miracle). I was very curious when I began my search.  Of course, I started at Amazon.com.  And of course, Amazon had it!  I was so excited to finally try them, came right on time.  You get 10 dissolvable tablets; plenty to get your taste tripping party started! My kids and I had so much fun!  I had been telling them all week we were going to do an experiment, they bugged me EVERYDAY!  They were so surprised that the tablets really worked.  They do exactly what they claim:  simply turns sour to sweet.  The lemons truly taste like eating lemonade.  The strawberries are my favorite. They think frooties are THE coolest.  My only complaint (hence the four stars) is I wish they dissolved faster - More melt in your mouth.  Although rather expensive, I'm glad I tried it and my kids had a cool experience.

review/summary: Works
review/text: We tried these and I was worried that they may not work. They did work well. My family has loved trying them. We even enjoyed our lunch salad no dressing with just fruit and greek yogurt all natural. Tasty.<br />The pill was hard and took a few moments to melt but it worked right away.  It lasted for 20-25 minutes of active eating. I think the acid in the sour foods washes it away. I would try it again.

review/text: I purchased a box of these to share with my friends, and we were all amazed with the effect. Lemons were the best - so sweet and delicious. Beer got mixed reactions - some said it tasted like a wine cooler or grape juice, and a few said there was no change. The effect seemed to wear off after about 45 minutes.

review/summary: Works exactly as described...
review/text: I ordered these thinking it would be a fun thing to try. As some have described the taste of the tablet is not pleasant but I wouldn't go so far as to say it's going to make you gag or vomit... just unpleasant. It takes several minutes for the tablet to dissolve and frankly you either have to swallow a lot of saliva or spit at least a few times during this process... The package directs you not to swallow the contents but it seemed pointless to spit it all out. I decided to try to keep it all in until it was at least dissolved and I cracked it a few times to speed up this process. I also had a friend swallow the contents and they didn't experience any negative side effects, but this was just their experience.<br /><br />We had a good selection of sour foods and drinks set out to sample. Several different types of citrus (lemons, limes, grapefruit etc), pickles and pickled veggies, Worcestershire Sauce, Vinegar, Hot Sauces, ect. I'm sure you could get much more creative but these are just a few things we tried. The lemons and limes tasted amazing and sweet but you could still feel a bit of burn on your tongue same with the vinegar and hot sauce. The taste was altered and sour became sweet but your other senses such as smell and the sensitivity of your tongue remain and certainly effect the experience... for instance I can't stand pickles and while I ate them and they weren't sour... the smell was still revolting.<br /><br />The effect lasted for about an hour and sweet foods and drinks taste VERY strange during this time... even unpleasant. We all experienced a horrible after taste when eating or drinking anything for a couple hours after the effect had ended... it seems like it takes a bit of time for things to taste right again.<br /><br />All in all still a good experience and the product worked completely as described.

review/summary: Cool product but results hardly last
review/text: I bought these XL tablets because i thought they would last awhile....but they don't. I only tried half a tablet since these XL are supposed to be extra potent and the packaging description even says you can cut them in half for a "regular dose".<br /><br />These tablets take a minute or two to dissolve and are pretty bland tasting, but nothing horrible.  I even read some tips to make the effects last longer and scraped my tongue before sucking on the tablet.  Its pretty amazing how a lemon tastes good! i even squeezed lemon juice into a cup and diluted it with a bit of water and it tasted like i was drinking sweet lemonaid! Sadly, the effects only lasted about 5 minutes and then everything was normal.  So if half a tablet only gets you 5 minutes then i'm guessing a full dose gets you about 10 minutes.  Its cool for a party gag or something odd to try but i kind of wish the effects lasted longer

review/text: This product did exactly what it said it would, make sour things sweet! Don't expect anything unreal or magical things though! It takes so long for the tablet to fully dissolve in your mouth, (not to mention that it tastes pretty bad) but once it's done, it works! If you are looking for some diet help or to be astounded with some magic or something, don't get it! if you are looking for a fun and interesting thing to try with some friends, go for it! It's amazingness is kind of exaggerated.

review/text: Cons: I ordered a box and tried it with vinegar to reduce my blood sugar. This product did not affect the taste of the vinegar. The tablets taste like cardboard and took forever to melt/dissolve on my tongue. I will try again and if it works better I will update this review. As of now, the product did not work as advertized.<br /><br />Pros: The product was shipped super fast and arrived on time.

review/summary: Wanted to try this miracle fruit thing....
review/text: My husband bought these because my parents wouldn't stop talking about this miracle fruit thing.  We bought them last minute so we could take them to my parents house.  Personally, these things tasted like some sort of nasty cardboard, and you can eat the box if you want a comparison.  You have to dissolve it on your tongue, but while you are doing that, you have an urge to vomit because of the strange taste.  However we did eat lemons before and after, and the lemons were quite pleasant to eat after you had dissolved the cardboard pellet on your tongue.  Regular pop, beer, and other foods were disgusting after eating the cardboard pellet though.  Cool for a novelty item at a party when you want to sit around and eat lemons, but I don't see much use for it other than that.  I wouldn't buy these again, but they did work - which is why I'm giving it 3 stars.

review/summary: Another marketing scam
review/text: I put the tablet in my mouth and kept it in there for a long time until it dissolved, just like they said to do.  It didn't change the taste of any green vegetables or carrots like I was hoping it would do; but really, that was no surprise since they don't claim it will change the taste of those.  They claim it will change the taste of lemons and some other tart fruits.  It did make the lemon juice very sweet; but it was a yucky, cloying sort of sweetness that kind of reminded me of stevia or saccharin.  I tried mixing the lemon juice with water and it tasted even worse.  After a minute or two I just couldn't stand to eat any more.  All in all, I would say save your money and don't buy this.  It's another hyped-up marketing scam.

review/summary: tastes like the fruit, delicious
review/text: These gummies are the most delicious I have tasted. Compared to their American counterparts, these are practically the real fruit. Their flavor is fresh and bright, and they taste just like the real thing, but with that fun gummy texture.<br /><br />Kiwi is one of my favorites because, unlike many other candies, this flavor is subtle and not obnoxiously sweet. The seeds add a fun little crunch, and the hint of tanginess makes it taste more like the real fruit...though it could be tangier. They go fast because they are so good--I definitely recommend them!
