review/summary: Great candy ... not so great price.
review/text: My first impression was this is very good candy ... my second was that you sure don't get much for your money (30 M&Ms) at over a dollar a bag.  I had assumed these weren't available in our area, but have since found them at several large local chain stores in their checkout aisles for about 50 cents a bag (same size).  The convenience of having them delivered to your door is not worth double the price.  Live and learn!

review/text: Bought this as a present for a friend for his birthday. Up to now, he could only find single packs here and there, this is not a product easily found in stores.  I was so surprised to find such a large quantity and on line at that and this made his day.  Product was wonderful and came on time and so worth it.  This made a wonderful gift for my coconut chocoholic friend.<br /><br />Thanks so much.

review/summary: Brace Yourself for a Big Hot Mess.
review/text: I ordered this product not knowing the location of the fulfillment center from which it would ship.  Turns out it shipped from Sparks, Nevada.  I made the assumption that the person at Amazon.com responsible for warehousing things like chocolate in August would have the common sense to use one of your fulfillment centers where UPS Ground shipments wouldn't be transported in an unrefrigerated truck in 98F weather.  Amazon.com has about 20 different fulfillment centers around the US, yet they choose one on the edge of Death Valley.<br /><br />Pretty genius, folks.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I was very excited to receive these M&Ms, however, they were a huge disappointment. They do not taste like pina colada or little morsels of heaven. They taste like m&ms with a hint of artificial imitation coconut flavor. The 5 star average over 16 reviews won me over and I bought these at more than a dollar per package. In retrospect, I can't believe I paid vending machine prices for a "grocery store" purchase. Finally, YMMV, but more than half of my packages had broken M&Ms and about one third had large clusters of M&Ms that had melted and then fused together. 3 star product, -1 star for the price, and subtract another for the condition. Ugh.

review/summary: One star becasue of the condition of the bags of M&Ms & the M&Ms inside
review/text: The product tasted fine. The only problem I had was the conditions the product was in when I rec'd it. I inspected the box before I opened it and it was fine, the carton of candies inside the shipping box was also fine. But once  I opened the carton there were M&Ms loose inside the carton and 7 out of the 24 single bags were split open along the one seam. Since I bought the candy for my candy jar @work and could only get them in the single size bags I decided to open all the single bags and consolidate them into one big bag. Once I started to open them all up I found that not one of the bags had whole M&Ms. Every last bag had cracked or mashed M&Ms. And I found at least 2 more bags'seam opened once I touch the bag.<br />This incident wouldn't have been so bad if I hadn't also rec'd a similar product(Strwaberry & Peanut Butter M&Ms)at the sametime and they managed to get to me whole. I bought them via Amazon but they were shipped from a different company. I would never buy this type of product through Amazon again if Amazon is the shipper.

review/text: It's like chewing on Pina Colada.  Those who miss Bounty will enjoy the finish of this candy.  It has the famous candy coated crunch and there is no coconut texture - like myself who loves the flavor of coconuts but can't stand the shreds of it in food.  It's smooth and creamy in the middle and ends with the crunch.  So grab as many as you can of these.

review/summary: no coconut here
review/text: I saw a package of these while standing in the grocery line, thought they might be good, and added it to my cart. On the way home, I opened the package and ate a few. They tasted okay, (chocolate is always good right?) with a coconut(ish) flavor, but I noticed a weird after-taste. I looked at the ingredient list and saw that coconut was nowhere to be found. I looked at the front of the package and realized that I had missed the cleverly placed "artificial flavor" right below the word coconut. I ate a couple more, couldn't stomach any more and threw the rest in the garbage when I got home. These things do not taste good and the folks at Mars should be ashamed of selling such artificial junk.

review/text: These are SO good. If you like Mounds bars then you'll LOVE these. It's like eating Mounds bars with a candy shell. I had them a few months ago when out in CA and couldn't find them at all in NY. Then recently on a trip to Cape Cod I found them in a CVS (on sale too, 2 for $1.00 too!) and I bought the whole box. but now I only have a few left and was excited to see them on Amazon...but for way too much $$. I'm going to keep looking and hope that M&Ms releases them in a larger bag and increases their availability for purchase. If you see them, get them. You won't be sorry.

review/text: Love the product, hate the shipper!  I discovered the coconut M&M's at a car wash and fell in love. My friends & I went on a hunt and were so pleased to find them on Amazon. I've ordered them before without a problem.  This time was a disaster!  The outside box was fine, but inside was a mess.  Most of the individual packages were not fully sealed resulting in unprotected, squashed &/or melted candy.  I returned them immediately and am awaiting a refund.  Although other reviewers mentioned this as an issue, I had to give it a shot.  What a disappointment!!

review/summary: Bitterly disappointed
review/text: I just can't believe all the positive reviews on this product.  Every company should get one free pass for making a mind-numbing mistake and putting out an absolutely horrible product.  For the folks at M&M, this IS that product.  Peanut M&M's have peanuts in them.  Almond M&M's have almonds in them.  Peanut butter M&M's have peanut butter in them.  Pretzel M&M's have crunch pretzels in them. One would logically assume, given this company's stellar reputation for quality, that Coconut M&M's would have coconut in them.  One would assume that, but one would be wrong.  Instead, it's just a regular M&M with a slight hint of a god-awful artificial coconut flavor with an overwhelming aftertaste.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but I imagine it's similar to what it would taste like to lick a freshly lacquered antique table.  If you open that bag thinking that you're going to be eating little bits of coconut joy (like a Mounds or Almond Joy bar), you too will be bitterly disappointed.

review/text: I couldn't begin to review the M&M coconut as it arrived packaged in such a way that every one of the 24 bags were fused together by the heat. It is true, that you allowed me to return it, and equally true that you credited me for the sale, but the vendor must be stupid. The company is based in Arizona!!! and they didn't think that the M&M's would melt????? It brings into question the business of sense of AZ Perfume. Even the name indicates that it is hot there!!I would Never order anything from them again. I contacted the President of the Co by e-mail and in two weeks he hasn't even deigned to answer me. That does not speak well for a vendor who represents Amazon.com, does it??

review/text: I love the McCormick spices in the large bottles sold here on Amazon.  They are a great value over buying spices in small bottles at the grocery store, and so far I've been happy with the ingredients in all the ones I've bought.<br /><br />This Bayou Cajun seasoning is a little salty, but because it has no MSG I like using it in jambalaya, on grilled shrimp and salmon, and in dirty rice. It's got a little bite to it, but it's not too spicy for the family's tastes. The shaker lid makes it easy to dispense the right amount, and the rectangle shape of the bottle allows me to stack it with other bottles in my pantry.  With free SuperSaver shipping on orders over $25, this is a good value for those who like to cook with Cajun spices.

review/text: This is a great product.  I made the potato cakes for breakfast.  Just add water to the mix.  The potato cakes were ready to fry up in just a couple of minutes.  I slapped them down on the griddle with a bit of olive oil.  They browned up very nicely and were just crispy enough.  One little package made 6 nice sized potato cakes.  I only used 2 of them so I just put the others in individual sandwich bags and put them in the freezer.  I figure I'll take out a couple more next weekend and heat them up on the griddle while the eggs and bacon are cooking.  These potato pancakes have a great texture and they stayed together well.  I am so glad I made this purchase because these potato cakes taste much better than the frozen potato hasbrown type potatoes.

review/text: Another 30 lb bag is all gone.  My 9 month old Newfoundland puppy just weighed in at 135 pounds.  He seems to like it, no allergies, or digestive upsets with this food.  He eats about 2 bags a month and I'll be needing to get him a job to help pay for his food soon.

review/summary: My Pit Bull Mix Loves this!
review/text: I give him raw chicken when I can but have to keep dry on hand for when I run out. I wanted grain free since my last dog died of cancer (he was also getting raw chicken but then I gave him Purina One for a couple of weeks and he just went down hill from there). I believe it is the grain in the food as grains (sugar) feed cancer. Dogs would not run out to the fields and steal the grains. They will steal any type of meat. This is what their creator intended for them to eat & survive best off of.<br /><br />Wolves live longer than there same-size dog counter parts. Yet we bring dogs to the vet, they are pampered, fed daily & vaccinated. It's the grains! The corn causes problems with their bones. This is why our animals get arthritis and hip dysplasia so early!<br /><br />My dog LOVES this stuff. I've also tried Chicken Soup for the Soul food, he doesn't care for that.

review/summary: Best and Lowest cost Grain-Free dog food as of writing this review
review/text: We have several German Shepherd Dogs who despite all being related have a wide variety of coats, sizes, head structures, preferences and temperaments. In the past on commercial cereal dog foods this one was picky or that one had a coat issue.  NOT ANYMORE. Not since we switched to TASTE OF THE WILD. Finally, a food that I am comfortable serving to them for quality, they all DEVOUR within minutes leaving none to waste and all their skin and coat issues are gone.  YEAH!!  yes, this dog food SEEMS to be a bit higher cost than the commercial cereal dog foods, however in terms of reduced odor, reduced coat issues, reduced skin issues, increase vitality, increased vigor therefore increased health - it's allll worthwhile!<br /><br />Even though we currently have full grown dogs I still mix in a bag of Taste of the Wild Puppy formula every few bags, especially in the fall and winter months to give them extra energy. The puppy formula is the perfect boost for our very senior dogs. In the future when we have a puppy I will most definitely consider feeding them TOTW Salmon Puppy formula for healthy development.<br /><br />Our dogs love the salmon flavor the best though they obviously enjoy Taste of the Wild over all other brands of dog food.  A family of mallard ducks moved into our pond for the summer - we were giving them a few bits of TOTW - Salmon daily, as well. Initially they were hesitant then the ducks would paddle over to me at feeding time, as well!

review/text: We decided to get a Newfoundland puppy and brought him home, prior to this I had researched dog foods and decided to go with holistic select giant and large breed puppy[the food he was being fed at the breeder wasn't available around us or online]. I had done the gradual switch from his food to the new food and after days of diarrhea and a vet visit and researching, I decided to change his food to this. From the first bite, we have had no problems. He is now a healthy, growing boy who loves his dog food and I couldn't be happier.

review/summary: My first none fried ramen style noodle
review/text: Never really understood why these noodle packs fried there noodles. Maybe it preserves them longer, i don't know. But I was happy to see this Koka brand at my local Asian market. The cook up in 2 cups water, you add the noodles and veggie "garnish" to the water to hydrate. When the noodle is to your liking, add them to the bowl with the 2 seasoning packets. One is in powder form, the other is a chili sesame oil. Beware this stuff smells strong out of the packets, kinda like fish sauce. But after it mixed with the noodles and cooked a little in the heat, that smell became sesame and chili. There was no hint of that fish sauce smell or taste. Struck me as interesting. Anyway, the flavor is great, noodle had some give and did not stick or turn mushy. All was not good but great. Love this flavor and will now try all the others.

The conditions for the evening event were hot and muggy with slick surfaces from a pop-up storm. I was racing in the 10k and normally go all-out with these shorter distances. At mile 4 after all the slipping and sliding in mud, I started really feel the fatigue coming on and remembered I had the RevHoney with me. I took about 1/2 of it and could feel an immediate surge of energy that powered me through the next 2 miles. It was easy to use and the taste was great.

review/text: If you like cardamon tea, this is an incredible deal.  When I placed the order I had no idea how much tea 500 grams was equivalent to, and when I opened the box I was more than a little surprised to find the tins to be so large!  I have been making one pot of tea a day with it for a week and I have barely put a dent into my first opened tin!  For the low price of $23 for three tins, this may very well last me the entire year and is a value that simply cannot be beat.  I've always loved cardamon bread and this tea provides all the flavor of that bread without the calories :) No need for sugar either, just a bit of milk.  Thank you once again Amazon, for unmatched value and a great product.

review/text: I adore cardamon but I admit to being dubious when I first found this tea in my local Indian grocery. Not anymore. Black tea and cardamon make a wonderful combination. As soon as I found this brand here on Amazon I had to buy the three pack so I could give a tin to my sister and niece. This is a decent black tea with just the right amount of cardamon. It is great to drink plain but the cardamon is highlighted by adding sweetener and the taste is even better. My favorite is to add both sweetener and half-&-half. Then I just sit back, my hands wrapped around the cup, sniffing the wonderful aroma while I sip and let the world pass by. For a tea that is also a dessert, add honey, half-&-half or cream and a little bit of vanilla. It's delicious.

review/text: I am a huge fan of black teas, but ceylon-based teas have never been my favorite. I think this would be good if you like Amhad's Earl Grey (which, unfortunately, I don't), but might not be so good for people who like a more traditional black taste. The problem is that this is such a huge quantity, and not retunable, that I'm left with three caddies full of cardamom tea that I don't like. However, it's beautiful for gifts!

review/summary: Treasure Summer Memories  ~natsukashiku ajiwaeru~
review/text: A popular Japanese carbonated drink most often associated with the season of summer, though suitable for drinking all year round. Ramune carries a sense of nostalgia, and Shirakiku as well as other brands note this on their bottles with regards to the taste ("mukashi natsukashii aji").<br /><br />Reminiscent of citrus-hinted candy, the flavor of the drink itself is more along the light and neutral side of the sweetness spectrum, making it an ideal companion with almost any meal or snack as well as by itself.<br /><br />As with any Ramune bottle, the method opening and drinking is part of the experience. A marble traps the pressure inside the bottle, and popping it inside is required for opening the bottle. Inside, the marble stays in the top area while the indents on one side act as stoppers so that the marble does not block the flow of the drink. Drinking  Ramune properly involves keeping that marble away from the neck, which some people (for good reason) treat as a game of sorts.<br /><br />Refreshing however way you have it, and Shirakiku is a decent brand I purchase often (other brands of Ramune, such as the MiZuKi imports, also provide selections with a hint of other flavors such as lychee).

review/summary: Ichiban Desu Ne!?
review/text: I first stumbled across this wonderful concoction in a department store in Okinawa. My buddy and I each bought a bottle almost as an after thought (it gets brutally hot and humid there) and wandered back out into the street. We couldn't open the bottle, no matter how much we twisted and pried and appealed to examples of familiar American packaging! Eventually we were forced to go back inside and ask the sales girl for assistance, which she very graciously gave us, although you could tell she thought it was funny. And I suppose it was, at that! See, this stuff even transcends the language barrier! (If you're reading this, Calloway, I want my 200 yen back!)<br /><br />The top of the cap must be punctured in order to open, and the neck of the bottle narrows to a point about midway up (or down, if you will.) You can see the indentation I refer to in the picture above. A small marble is allowed to roll freely in the upper chamber, resting while upright on top of the narrow hole, so that when you tilt the bottle back to sip the marble rolls out and allows liquid to pass the choke point. We got such a kick out of this unique design that we both bought more bottles to take to sea. I still have some of the Okinawa vintage left, but I'm not sure it would still be good to drink.<br /><br />The flavor I had was a cross between citrus and bubble gum; certainly not your standard Coca-Cola sugar rush. (Sorry, I like Coke too, but comparisons must be made!) I understand other flavors are available, and are no doubt just as good. Oddly enough, I didn't see this product offered for sale very often on the Kanto plain, but I probably just didn't know where to look. Once I was living in Yokosuka I got hooked on another Asian drink. I forget the name, but it tasted a little like an orange creamsicle. I miss Japan so much! Guess I'll just have to settle for drinking Ramune until I get back to that part of the world. Enjoy!

(The only way to get the marble is to wrap the bottle up in a lot of newspaper and then shatter the bottle. It's pretty messy but pretty much the only way to get it.)<br />2) What I like most about it is that it has a very neutral taste, it won't overpower whatever food you're easting. It also doesn't taste too sweet, but it contains the same amount of sugar as coke per oz.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) The 200ml translates to 6.75 oz; that's about 1/2 the size of a regular can of coke and therefore 4 times the price!<br /><br />Overall, a pleasant conversation starter, for those who want a soda with a neutral taste, and don't mind spending some dinero for it.

I'd suggest giving those a shot once you get bored of playing with your newly discovered bottle-bound marble.

The flavor does not seem to be altered with any artifical sweetners or sugars.  The flavor and sweetness are all natural.  I will definately purchase these again from this seller.

review/summary: high fiber, but lacking in taste ...
review/text: Those who transfer to a gluten-free diet know that getting enough fiber in their diets is a challenge.  Perky's Crunchy Flax Cereal is the highest fiber gluten free cold cereal I've found (6 grams or 24% of your daily allowance in a 3/4 cup serving). (Please let me know if you've found others with 6 grams or more of fiber a serving!) For its fiber content, it gets raves!  As a person who takes medication that leads to constipation and who can't eat many different fruits because I have interstitial cystitis, it's impossible to get enough fiber with fruits and vegetables alone. So, I eat this cereal every day and sometimes twice a day.<br /><br />I used to eat some great high fiber cereals before going gluten free.  While this cereal is a lifesaver because it is high fiber, the taste leaves something to be desired.  The ingredients in the cereal are sorghum flour, ground flax seed, raisin juice, honey, and salt.  That's it.  I'm thrilled there aren't a bunch of preservatives and artificial things in the cereal, but I wish they'd work on improving the taste of this cereal and perhaps making it available in various flavors.  As is, the cereal tastes a bit like a bland version of grape nuts. I've tried adding fruit and it helps a bit.  The best I've been able to make it taste is by adding a little stevia for more sweetness and come ceylon cinnamon (safer than regular cinnamon for those with IC) to it, but that blah taste still breaks through.<br /><br />The cereal stays super crunchy in milk for awhile before getting softer - good or bad, depending on what you like.  There's 200 calories in that 3/4 cup serving, which is a bit high, but you are getting a lot of omega 3 fatty oils from the flax seed, so that's a nice trade off.<br /><br />Aside from the taste, this is a great cereal.  But come on, don't we want our cereal to taste good?  That's the reason for the 3-star rating.

review/text: I can't say this is bad honey. I paid even more for it at a grocery store, then the amazon price. It is not that good compared to Meeks Honey. However, this honey is good on cold cereal. Other honeys tend to get stuck in a big lump when added to cold milk. This one dissolves in cold liquids much better. Maybe it is not raw? Maybe it is processed? I don't know why it dissolves in cold drinks.

review/summary: illy issimo caff&egrave;
review/text: Illy issimo caff&egrave; Italian espresso style coffee drink is a 6.8 fl. oz. (200 ml) blast of sweetened caffeine in a can.<br /><br />1930s Italy under the rule of Mussolini greatly contributed to the development of modern coffee culture, improved coffee-making, and new types of coffee-making equipment. The Horn of Africa (where coffee originated) was under Italian colonization and companies such as illy and Bialetti were founded.<br /><br />In that tradition, this drink is now made in Denmark under the issimo brand from illy and distributed in the U.S. by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />This canned cappuccino has a slightly bitter dark roast coffee taste with the right amount of sugar and a pleasant mouthfeel. It's not as good as freshly made espresso but it's not bad at all. I do prefer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">illy issimo cappucino</a> as a treat.

review/summary: Naturally sweet and delicious, consistency like babyfood
review/text: Despite the "unsweet" descriptor, this applesauce has plenty of natural sweetness.  It doesn't need one bit of added sweetener, although I do add a dash of cinnamon.  It appears they obtained such a naturally sweet applesauce by cooking down the apples quite a bit, so the texture is smoother than a typical applesauce--more like applebutter or babyfood.  This product feels heavy on the spoon, and lacks the textured mouth feel of most applesauces.  I'm not deducting any stars for that, b/c while I don't care for this texture, others might prefer it or not mind.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a great product, particularly since it's made from organic apples.  The Environmental Working Group consistently finds apples to be in the top 2 or 3 most pesticided fruits.<br /><br />In terms of taste, the only applesauce I've found to be better is making my own raw applesauce by tossing a couple of cored Fuji or Gala apples into the Vitamix blender for a few seconds.  (Two apples per serving.)

review/text: I was looking for healthier snack and dessert alternatives for my kids and I saw a jar of the regular organic applesauce in the super market and decided to give it a try. Now my 3 yr. old son can't get enough of it. He wants it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Strangely enough, he was not that way about other sweetened applesauces. I like it because it has no sugar and no preservatives. It has to be healthier for him. I also tried and must confess it's pretty good stuff.  They have some different flavors and we like them all.

review/summary: Best non-perishable hummus, but bar is not set high
review/text: Leaving a review since no one's reviewed this yet.<br /><br />I just left a review for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H226SA">Yehuda hummus</a>, which in my opinion is a notch slightly below this in taste, cost, and container size. The good news is neither Wild Garden nor Yehuda have preservatives.<br /><br />I'll leave most of what I said in the Yehuda review, but the bottom line is I've found non-perishable hummus to be expensive and disappointing in both taste and ingredients. You would think that a company which is clearly not ethnically-geared, and has a lot of non-traditional (I wanted to write "illegitimate") hummus flavors, would be inferior to the authentic-sounding name brand imported all the way from Israel. Yeah, no. There's no need to bring that Yehuda crap all the way from Israel. Americans should be perfectly capable of making crappy canned hummus, and apparently we are, viz. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HP5HX8">Manishewitz canned hummus</a>, currently unavailable or I'd be trying some. I tried a boxed dry "mix" variety once too and it was a disaster.<br /><br />I've found Wild Whatever's taste to be the closest to the mass-produced "fresh" variety you find in the Costco refrigerated bins, which is really how you should go if you don't need it to be non-perishable. The fresh stuff can also last for weeks, especially if you don't mix it up, and keep a coating of olive oil over the top. Costco's the only place I've found to get a decent-sized container of the fresh stuff. The token "dip" size you'll find in grocery's regrigerated section is the same quality as the Costco fresh stuff, just mighty tiny, and ridiculously expensive for what it is.<br /><br />Wild Whatever's glass jar has a wide mouth and short height, so it's geared for eating out of the container. Yehuda's can mouth is a little narrower, and can taller, but I've never had much of a problem eating that all the way from the can, too (I usually ignore the pull tab and open from the bottom, and pop the top at the end if I really want to clean it out).<br /><br />Complaint mode on: I really don't think it would be THAT much more expensive to use real olive oil and some vestige of real lemon, instead of el-cheapo veggie oil and citric acid? Wild Whatever skips the oil route altogether. *Sigh*.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS, since Amazon so graciously forgot:<br />Chick peas, tahini, water, sea salt, natural spices, citric acid.

review/text: Who would have thought that Amazon would carry Buddy Biscuits, but when I found them I was one 'Happy Camper'.  I found out when my dog was just a baby that many of the dog foods (crumbles, treats, etc.) caused her to have an upset stomach.  We went to a campground in Utah and they had little packs of Buddy Biscuits for the dogs.  Amazingly "Pippy" loved them and they agreed with her and they are so cute!  Since that time we have been able to locate the Peanut Butter Madness in a few stores, but when I found that could order them on Amazon I was very happy.  And since she is so picky she will not eat the small size or any other flavor, but she will do anything she can to get her Peanut Butter Madness.

They are "thin" enough that you can break them into smaller pieces with your hands, but "sturdy" enough for a big dog to get some "crunch" and "chew" out of them. My dog also has severe allergies, and these are one of the few treats he can eat that I buy. Otherwise, I have to make (bake or dehydrate) all of his treats. Amazon's price is the lowest that I have found anywhere; literally 50% less than what the pet stores charge. Would definitely recommend to a friend.

review/text: I can't understand how these cookies could possibly get a bad review. I consider myself to be a cookie connoisseur and these are pretty much the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had. I don't mean the best "gluten free cookies" but best cookies ever!<br /><br />I dropped the cookie dough on a pizza pan greased with light olive oil and cooked them at the recommended temp for about 8-9 minutes.  They came out PERFECT!! I did another batch on a darker pan that had been lightly coated with the same olive oil and even though they only cooked for about 7 minutes, the bottoms were burnt and they were a little too hard for my taste. I don't know much about baking, but I know that a lighter cookie sheet/pan makes a better cookie.<br /><br />Maybe they were a little too great, because I have eaten 2 dozen of them in the past 24 hours. There goes my diet =(

review/text: This cookie mix requires 1 egg, 1 tablespoon softened butter and 2 tablespoons of milk.  It was hard to mix and to drop by tablespoons onto cookie sheet.  The directions didn't say to grease the cookie sheet or use parchment paper or anything like that so I didn't thinking that they were the kind of cookie that makes its own grease as it cooks so it slides off and you would not want to cook that kind of cookie on a greased sheet because that would be like frying your cookies.  Anyhow, this cookies are dry and if you decide to make a batch of these you will definitely want to do something to keep them from sticking.<br /><br />While these are not so bad that they go directly into the trashcan, I am not sure that they will get eaten up and eventually end up on the trashcan any way.  I much prefer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DZKKKC">Pamela's Products Incredible Chocolate Chunk Cookies Mix, 13.6-Ounce Units (Pack of 6)</a> for a dutch cocoa tasting chocolate chunk cookie and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004B7TV2G">Chocolate Chunk Cookie Mix</a> for a traditional tasting chocolate chunk cookie.

review/summary: Best GF Choc Chip Cookies on the market!
review/text: These Arrowhead Mills GF cookies are the most comparable to "regular" choc chip cookies.  They come out of the oven warm and soft and taste great!  If you need to avoid gluten and haven't tried these cookies, you better.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.

review/summary: My preferred gluten-free cookies
review/text: Out of all of the gluten-free cookies that I've tried these are my favorite.  I put in a soy-based butter-alternative and add a little extra to make them very moist.<br />I'd give it more stars if the product was somehow healthier.

review/summary: Very Dry Unfortunately
review/text: My husband picked up overstock of these boxes of chocolate chip Arrowhead Mills cookies at the Canned Food Outlet nearby.  They were a fantastic deal, and still a year out from their pull date.  Though my daughter doesn't seem to mind them as much as we do, they are overly sweet, sandy, and very dry and crumbly.  I will not be buying them again and am very unhappy to have 10 boxes left!<br /><br />HOWEVER:  Arrowhead does make a fantastically soft and gooey luxurious brownie mix that kids gulp down and consume like no other brownies I have ever baked.  I highly recommend that product instead.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: My kids and I tried this mix for the first time today.  All of them loved the cookies--they are the closest we have tasted to wheat based choco chip cookies.  They have the right balance between crispy and chewy, are packed with chocolate chips and did not have a gritty taste.

review/text: The cooked result was too gritty. Skip these and buy Pamela's Chunky Chocolate chip cookies. You can eat them right out of the box and they taste good.
