review/summary: Excellent value and quality
review/text: I will admit that I was worried about buying these after reading the review from the person whose pup became sick after eating four of these, but I decided to take the risk and carefully monitor my own pup.  My 3-month old Golden Retriever puppy came to me with giardia (for which he has been treated, but at the time, he was still experiencing some problems), so I didn't want anything to exacerbate his gastro issues.  I'm relieved (no pun intended) to say that my puppy, along with my two Great Pyrenees, and my gimpy old lab/husky mix, have all four gone through this 5-lbs package of rawhides (in just a little over a month) with no problems at all.  I sent some home with my mother for her terrier mix and for my sister's doberman, and they've had no problems, either.<br /><br />The rawhides are a good mix of small and relatively thin, along with a some (more than half of) which are larger and thicker.  There is no odd (eg., chemical) smell coming from the rawhides, and the bag is resealable - like a giant ziploc bag.  I'm placing my third order (sent one bag to mom and sis for their dogs); the quality is excellent and the value is unbeatable.<br /><br />August 2011 Update:  I have had these on a monthly auto-shipping order for several months, but the last two shipments were bags with rawhide chips that are almost entirely small and thin, and have not included the larger & thicker pieces I mentioned earlier.  I hope the next shipment will bring back the larger pieces.  If it does not, I do not think I will continue to purchase these.  They are fine for small to medium dogs, but are simply too small for my 70+ lbs animals, and they just don't last very long.<br /><br />December 2011 Update:  The last three shipments have seen a return to a more diverse sizing of the chips.  I expect that there will continue to be some variability, but I am especially pleased with this month's bag, since it has many of the thicker chips I prefer for my big dogs.  These thicker chips might be less than ideal for the smallest of dogs, though I think most determined pups would be okay with them.  I plan to continue to receive this bag on a once-a-month automatic shipping order for the foreseeable future; I think it might be possible to make this bag last more than a month even giving all four of my dogs one chip a day, but we're never that orderly, and I find that I'm usually out of chips several days before a new shipment.  With fewer dogs, you can expect this bag to last several months.

review/summary: Warning - Made Lab Retriever Sick After Only 4 Rawhide Chips
review/text: I read the positive reviews and I really liked the price so I ordered these rawhide chips. My yellow Labrador Retriever weighs 80 lbs and daily gets a rawhide chip (primarily Walmart generic brand) as a treat in the evening for years.  My Lab will eat everything in sight (including socks) and never has stomach problems. After giving him only four rawhide chips in two days, my Lab developed a severe case of diarrhea and he's still sick after four days.  He is an inside dog which makes it a real problem since he needs to go out hourly to do his business. Plus he's not feeling well and just lies around. I called the vet right away, and he recommended some immodium-type medication short term only. Since his appetite is fine and he isn't throwing up and he isn't getting any worse, his vet and I think he will be fine.  The vet advised me to throw away the rest of the rawhide which I have done.  I called Amazon.com and my money was cheerfully refunded which I greatly appreciate since I used the refund to buy the immodium medication.<br /><br />This is just a warning to make sure you only give your dog one bone chip at a time and wait a day or so to make sure he can tolerate it.  I don't know why these rawhides made my dog so sick but it could have been just a problem with this batch. I won't be buying this product again but I will definitely continue to buy from Amazon.com

review/text: My dog absolutely LOVES these... though he's not sure why.  He takes them and runs circles... every once in a while he'll drop it and bark at it... then picks it up and start running again.  Considering the rawhide is gone by the time I get home, I think he eventually figures it out... either that or I've got a TON of rawhide bones buried in my yard somewhere :o)<br />Seriously though - no extra stuff, just plain chewy rawhide fun - it's a winner in my boys eyes!

review/summary: Warning, Made my Doberman Sick!
review/text: I like to give good reviews but unfortunately, this time I can't.  This product made my doberman very very sick, Twice!  I thought, the first time it could have been something else.  Then I remember reading the post that said warning don't feed, her lab had explosive diarrhea, well same thing happened to my doberman.  So the second time, I tested it out, gave her two chips as a snack, then the next day, the same thing.  So, that's the end of those chips for me!  I will say, I think it's only for certain dogs as my heeler can eat them, with no problems.  So, it just depends on the dog and dobermans are known for having sensitive stomachs although, no other raw hide chips have ever bothered her in this way whatsoever.  Just want to put it out there, to help give you an informed decision.

review/summary: My dog gives it 5 stars
review/text: Dog-la loves 'em and just today, he was asking me to order another 5-lbs before he runs out.  Which I did, because the price is right w/s&s, he gives me 3 minutes of peace while he chews, and his teeth are pretty clean on a chewie-a-day.  And, well, he's got me trained to serve him obediently.<br /><br />No problems for him, and he's got a bit of a sensitive stomach (he can eat random cat poop no problem, but let 'im swallow the tiniest piece of plastic while eating through a bottle to get to the treats inside, and, bam, massive surgery bill and lifelong intestinal scarring).  I appreciate the reviewers sharing their tails of caution, but I've had no problems.  I give one with dinner and dog-la noshes on (inhales? magically adsorbs?) some kibble and veggies (30 seconds, max), and then grabs the rawhide and enjoys a relaxing chew.  Once in a blue moon, I give him a rawhide unattended (but that's a bad idea with basically ANY chewable, because dogs can gnaw off a chunk and inhale/swallow it).  He's sitting on my foot 99% of the time he's chewing these and he's never choked or suffered stomach upset from 'em.<br /><br />Dog-la seems to digest these perfectly; I sometimes see pieces of other rawhides in the pooper-scooper, but not these.  And he's a definite fan.  He won't eat some types of rawhide (especially flavored ones), but he he gets all eager and pushy when I pull these out, as if to say, "good human, GOOD human! Now, release. Drop it, drop it! NOW, gimme, gimme, gimmmeee!"  6 months of daily use, and he's still madly in love.  And he's not getting fat on them.<br /><br />EDIT to add: Dog-la did "choke" on one of these.  He started breathing funny and kind of clearing his throat - he was still breathing, but it stuck in the back of his mouth and after a couple minutes he hadn't cleared it on its own.  I freaked out a little, but it was easy to grab and pull it out - he then finished chewing it (yuck).  I keep a couple week supply of these in a tub for easy access, where they dry out a bit, so that may make them a little harder to chew.  I'll still buy them.  I've had food get wedged in my mouth the wrong way (luckily, I have fingers, so I can pull it out) and I'm not a complete and utter pig like my dog. LOL  I don't think having a flat object lay flat in the dog's mouth and slip back where he can't quite chew it is a product defect at all.  But I no longer give him rawhides unattended, ever.

review/text: This was a very large bag of rawhide chips for the money.  The only complaint I would have is quite a few of them are just too small for my dogs to chew.  I have large dogs, so the ones that are 2" square are too small.  I would say maybe 10% of the bag contained small ones.  Still a good deal I would say.

review/text: I have been ordering these for a while.  My dogs have always liked them until the last batch.  All of a sudden, they do not like them and just leave them lying around.  I thought they smelled funny, like a chemical smell when I first opened the bag, so I called the company.  They said that they would check into it, and sent me a box of replacement dog goodies. Guess I never thought much more about it until I read some of the reviews about these chews making dogs sick.  Guess I won't buy them anymore...

review/summary: Makes my dogs go "NOM NOM NOM!"
review/text: This is a good deal. A great deal cheaper than buying any size bags in local stores. If you have two big dogs who can chew through rawhides at an alarming rate, this is a good deal.<br /><br />I only give this 4 stars because of sometimes wild inconsistencies in the bag - some are very thick (~0.75") and some are paper thin. With two large dogs who will literally eat anything (including inorganic items that were once, at some time in history, touching or in close contact with food) this isn't a concern, but for folks with smaller dogs, this could pose a problem.<br /><br />A couple of the negative reviews on here said this product made their dogs sick. I've gone through about 6 bags with no such problems. Granted, one of my dogs has eaten 10 ears of corn, cobs included, along with enough cat food (very occasionally the "litter box buffet") to create regional shortages.<br /><br />In conclusion: A great deal that will make your best friend(s) very happy.

review/text: I had ordered these rawhide chips in the past and they were terrific.  Over the past 2 months or so, they changed distributers.  Upon receiving the bag of rawhide, I opened the bag to give one to my dog and an overwhelming stench of Ammonia came out of the bag.  There was no way my dog would get one of these. I repackaged it up to send back but you CAN'T RETURN this item per Amazon policy.  So, I am out the $26.  I am so angry!!!  I wish I could give negative stars for the product and Amazon.

review/summary: Big change -- very disappointed
review/text: I have been buying this product regularly for over a year, and my dogs love them. They became unavailable for a while, and are now back, but it is absolutely not the same product as I was getting previously. The rawhides in the new bags do not seem to be of as high quality as before (they are not as white and have a different texture), and they smell VERY strongly of chemicals. If this was a solvent used in the treatment of the rawhide, I would expect it to evaporate off, but this smell persists, even leaving the bag sitting open for days.<br /><br />I complained of this after the receiving the first recent bag from amazon, and they considerately sent me a replacement, but it is just as bad. I tried rinsing the rawhides well in water, which seems to help with the smell, and gave one to each of my dogs, and they loved them as much as always and showed no adverse effects. However, I don't think I can continue to use them -- the smell is really alarming.

review/summary: Bernie loves this treat.
review/text: Bernie, my 60-65 pound labrador retriever, loves these strips. I give her about 1 per day. The rawhide strips are on the order of 2-3 inches by 5-7 inches. They vary in thickness, but I'd say the majority of the strips are of slightly thin to normal thickness.<br /><br />The five pound bag is resealable, though it's not the toughest of plastics. I've received some bags that have some small holes from being punctured by the rawhide strips.<br /><br />The strips come from Brazil, purportedly from grass fed cows, which is excellent. I've noticed that most of the options I have in local stores are made in China. I'm not comfortable getting food products from China, given their recent past history with tainted pet foods.<br /><br />The Amazon price at more than a quarter of a Benjamin feels steep, though when you consider you're getting five pounds and consider the price per pound, it's actually a good value compared to local options (at least for me).

review/summary: Good value but supervision needed
review/text: My dog has chewed a lot of rawhide in his almost 7 years of life.  This was a great find because it was very nicely priced.  For some strange reason though, these seem to get caught in his throat.  I don't recall other rawhide posing a choking hazard like these chips.  After my dog is done with a chip, I have to fish out whatever is caught.  He's never had a serious consequence but I can't imagine what it would be like to have this chunk of rawhide lurking in the back of his throat for very long.  So, just like any other chew exercise, supervise your dog.

review/text: My dogs, two Lab mixes, love these chews.  The only problem is that the size of them is inconsistent.  The last bag I received they were all about a foot long.  The latest bag they are all about 4" - 5" long.  I think the shorter size works better because I feel the larger size is just too much and the with the smaller ones the bag will last longer.

review/summary: Excellent value for quantity and high quality
review/text: First thing is first. The value for this bag is EXCELLENT. 5 lb's of rawhide from grass-fed cows that aren't bleached for around $25 is one of the best deals out there. It's the epitome of why Amazon is Amazon. I always come to Amazon to search for the best values on products that I use daily in my life to see if I can lower my overall expenses via buying in bulk.<br /><br />When I got this bag in the mail I was shocked at how large the back really is. 5 lbs of rawhide is a lot of rawhide!<br /><br />I have a small chihuahua that is about 8 lbs. So, needless to say, I expect a 5 lb bag to last at least a year, even with me giving some of the bones away to friends.<br /><br />My dog is a chew FREAK. He is always chewing on some form of rawhide or bully stick and after doing some research I saw that there were different types of rawhide. Some were bad for dogs due to bleaching and coming from unhealthy animals, so I found these, which *seem* to be from healthy cows and in their natural state.<br /><br />As mentioned in other reviews, the chips can be really thick, which is really nice. It gives a nice sturdy chew for your dog to enjoy and is a good size.<br /><br />*UPDATE*<br /><br />I am editing this because I previously marked these down because my dog was ignoring them. Since that time my dog has gone through quite a few of these and they've turned into an excellent treat for him.<br /><br />These chews have caused no issues with him health wise - not a single one. I've given some to my friends and their dogs have loved them too. They have no odor, they don't get too "slimy" like some chews can get and when he gets to the "end" and there's just a little bit left it becomes really soft and he's able to chew it until it's small enough for him to finish and I don't worry about him choking because he's really good at chewing something thoroughly before swallowing and they become really soft.<br /><br />So, I take back my lower rating and give these a 5 star because they've turned into a great treat for the price and I still have a whole bin full of them after all this time (small dogs have their perks).

review/summary: Put my dog in the hospital
review/text: I have a black lab/border terrier mix.  She hasn't had any problems with any other rawhide (even the cheap brands).  These made her violently sick with excessive vomiting and diarrhea (I was up all night taking her out every 20 minutes).  This went on for 24 hours with no signs of stopping. She became severely lethargic.  She wouldn't drink water or eat food and our vet decided that we should bring her in to put her on fluids because she became so dehydrated.  In the end it cost $175 in vet bills.  Today she is back to normal and the rawhides are at a garbage dump somewhere.<br /><br />Amazon refunded our money with no problems whatsoever and I would still highly recommend them to consumers.

review/summary: Great value, greyhound loves them!
review/text: I purchased these chips for my greyhound, who gets one rawhide chip per day as a treat when he is crated.  I paid twenty bucks for the bag, making the cost four dollars per pound.  Typically I buy my chips at Agway, and pay more.  These chips were great because they are not flavored - they do not leave a beef or chicken colored residue on his bed.  They are the typical size, ranging from 3 to 5 inches square.  Some are thick, some are thin.  These did not make my dog sick at all.  He is used to rawhide and only gets diarrhea from eating those large rawhide rolls or bones (which he gets only rarely).  I would highly recommend this product to anyone with a dog who loves rawhide!

review/text: We just got the package today, and five pounds of rawhide is a lot more than you might think. They are mostly thin, square or rectangular shaped pieces about 2 1/2 inches wide, of a good size for a medium-sized dog like ours. I'm not quite sure how many there are, but this bag is going to last a very long time for us. Very happy dog this evening, and I'm happy to have a more natural product and a very good price at about $5.20 per pound.

review/summary: Fantastic and healthy for all dogs
review/text: I am so thrilled to find a rawhide that is from free range cows (hopefully this means grass fed) for my dog. Being a dauschund, he really needs something to chew. Since he destoys every type of toy, even the supposed "tough" ones, this is a great thing for him. Dauschunds, even though they are small, have very strong jaws and were bread to seek out badgers (one of the most viscious animal out there).<br /><br />Also no preservatives, that means no formaldehyde which other rawhides have,which can not be good for them! Would you eat soemthing with formaldehyde?<br /><br />No coloring is great so it does not leave stains on the rugs or his bed.<br /><br />I have been giving him a rawhide in the morning for years, so am not sure why others have heard it is bad for their dogs. My vet even thinks it is a good idea since, as I said, dauschunds really need to chew.<br /><br />I very highly recommend this to anyone who gives hawhide to their dogs, or has a dog that "needs" to chew.<br /><br />Of course, like anything I have purchased from Amazon or through Amazon, it arrived quickly and is exactly what they described.

review/summary: great value & dogs love them!
review/text: we have 3 dogs of various size (15 lbs, 50lbs, 80lbs) and they all liked different kinds of rawhide-chews until we got this bag... all 3 dogs love these!! It seems that they satisfy the desire to chew on something substantial, but are still "soft" enough that they are enjoyable the entire time (pressed rawhides can be too hard, rope/fabric toys are WAY to soft.)  great product when balanced with this price! In fact, I'm here writing a review because I'm ordering another bag... :)

review/summary: BIG BAG BONUS
review/text: I love this product b/c you really get more than what you pay for.  The chewies are different sizes in the bag so my babies can pick what they want.  With 3 big dogs, I went through them alot.  It seems that this bag is so big that they last a little longer.  The best part is they are always available and super fast delivery!  Wal#@$t were always out and it would take up to 3 months before they may get 5 bags.  Dogs with chewie withdraws IS NOT fun.

review/summary: Not Healthy Product
review/text: This was a first purchase of this product and the description sounded great along with the price. The product I normally purchase was not available. Within a half day of having eaten just one or two of the chips my dog has developed diarreah each time (about four times now).  Definitely not normal and has not occurred with other rawhide products.  I'm sure it's this product that is triggering it.  No issues since I have discontinued using. Does have a bad odor in the bag.  I will be discarding and unfortunately can't even consider donating to rescue groups.  It's not an allergy, it's a bad quality product.

review/text: I was very happy to once again see these are available.  For 5 lbs of rawhide, this is a great value!<br />Every night, at bedtime, my two dogs each get what they know as a 'chewie'.  It's a part of their nightly routine that they really enjoy.<br />The rawhide sizes are perfect for the larger dog but too large for the small, 5 lb dog.  To remedy this, I have cut them with a saw to a more suitable size.  Works great!<br />Although some dogs may not be able to tolerate these type of 'treats', my dogs have not experienced any problems at all.  My dogs absolutely love them!!

review/summary: Good Value For Money..
review/text: The brand I usually give my dogs has become a hit 'n miss findable item at the stores so I ordered 'Green Cow'.  I find that  My dogs still prefer the 'beef' or 'chicken' flavored chew flips they are used to and they get them when I can provide them.  'Green Cow' is a large, thick rawhide chew toss (6-7" L x 2.5-3" W).  I cut one in half using a jig saw to give to my smaller dog.  It's a bit thick for her.  'Green Cow' is a very good quality and something I trust and provide for my three dogs.

review/text: I bought this product because it is a great deal, rawhides in any brick and mortar store are outrageous, so I was very excited about this deal. However; this product makes my dog throw-up, and I know its not just rawhides in general because I have given her other ones with no difficulty. I also noticed she is not as interested in these rawhides as she has been in past brands (although this is not an issue because they as getting thrown either way. I have not contacted the seller about this yet but will be in the next couple days. I contacted amazon and they had great customer service and said they would look into the issue.

review/summary: Can't Beat it!
review/text: We have 8 canines of various breeds, age and size. There is no 1 size fits all for us.<br />These rawhide chips are the absolute best in quality we have found. The teeth cleaning ability of them is a God-send, the taste is enjoyed by our '4-paw kids', and..they last which gives them a good chewing session. I hope they come out with a smaller chip for our 'little kids' so they can have some as well. This particular product size is for larger dogs (80lb to 100+lb)which is hard to find. 1/2 the size of the original would be perfect for the smaller dogs (up to 50lb).<br />We love these chews and will promote them to friends and relatives as well as anyone that will listen. Our dogs love them and their teeth sparkle!<br />A superior product!

review/text: Honestly, we got these because it was cheaper per pound than the regular chips we buy. Our dog doesn't like them as much, but she also doesn't hate them so much that she finds other, inappropriate things to chew. One time I gave her one of these  and she took it into her bed, but fifteen minutes later I saw the chip outside her bed while she stared at it wistfully. I didn't even know dogs were capable of being wistful about a rawhide chip.

review/summary: Rawhide Chips
review/text: After reading the other reviews about dogs getting sick on these I was hesitant to make a purchase. I usually purchase rawhide chips at walmart but could no longer find any at any stores in my area or online. I finally decided what the hell I'll give em a try. I was surprised to find how large these were when they arrived which was sooner than expected and at a decent price too. I have a black lab and a dachshund so I need small and large chips (good thing I have a band saw). I was able to cut three to five chips out of each which was perfect as these chips will last me many months. BTW my dogs never got sick on these chips so I don't know what that's all about.

review/summary: Tasty rawhide chews at a GREAT price!
review/text: I have been purchasing these dog chews for almost a year using subscribe and save. I have a 30 lb beagle and 75 lb Pyrenees-Brittany mix, and they both LOVE these chews. My big dog asks for one every morning. Sometimes the chews will not be cut in half (imagine a full foot long rawhide chew, instead of being cut in half down to a 6inch long chew), but that just means it keeps my dogs occupied for twice as long. I haven't seen any diarrhea or stomach issues as a result of these chews.<br /><br />You get what you see - a GIANT 5 lb bag of rawhide dog chews. I've shopped around at Petsmart, Petco, Pet Supplies Plus, and my local grocery stores, and if you have a dog that likes to chew, this is going to be the most cost-effective, get-your-money's-worth option. $22 gets me rawhide chews for TWO dogs for a MONTH. You just can't beat that.

review/summary: They look good...but
review/text: Unfortunately, my dog has apparently become very picky in her old age. I've bought her rawhide from various places online and in stores, but haven't, until recently, had any problems with her not wanting to eat them.  These rawhide look very good. They are clean, smooth, and a good size.  I've given her multiple chips because she'll eat one, and not the other. I kept trying because she would eat one, and seemed happy with it; then the next day, she would put it down and walk away.<br />Bottom line, I believe this to be a good product and a great value for the money. Just not sure if the issue is with the rawhide itself, or my dog's changing preferences. She didn't like the bag of rawhide I bought right before this one either.

review/text: The Green Cow Rawhide Chips are a great treat for your dog.  The chips vary in size and shape, but most are about 6" long by 2.5" wide.  Most of the chips are wafer-thin, but some are slightly thicker.<br /><br />My 25-pound Wheaton Terrier mix gets one a day (when she's been a good girl) and she enjoys eating and tossing the treat around the house.  I've been using them with her for months now and I've not had any bathroom issues with the treats.  No gas or other problems either.  The 5 pound bag is huge, the price is great, and the subscription service is very convenient.<br /><br />Make sure that you supervise the dog when they are eating the chips as they have the ability to get stuck on the back of your dog's tongue depending on how they are eaten.<br /><br />All in all...a great, simple, and tasty treat for your furry friend.

review/summary: Awesome, high quality food
review/text: After reading a lot of reviews on puppy food, I settled on Nature's Variety Prairie puppy food.  It has high quality ingredients, no by-products, and lots of vitamins and minerals for my little guy to develop into a healthy adult.  The food has made my dog's coat super lustrous; he's an almost 5 month old Pembroke Welsh Corgi.  Since switching to this brand (we were using Authority puppy food before), his coat has become super shiny and soft.  He loves the taste and it makes his poops relatively small and hard.  If switching to this brand, be sure to switch slowly by integrating larger and larger amounts of this food while decreasing amounts of the original food.  I highly recommend this product, and the price is cheaper on Amazon than at Petco!

review/summary: Takes the guesswork out of seasoning sausage
review/text: I have made some dishes with sausage meat that was so tough, I had to throw the finished product out. I normally buy hog casings and make my OWN sausage when I get this frustrated but I finally realized I can just make the sausage patties and it is much easier. Italian sausage is a favorite, especially when you add the finished sausage to pasta sauce.<br />  This seasoning takes the guesswork out of achieving that Italian taste. Saves a lot of testing different store-bought sausage and wasting time and food. There is nothing easier. Mix seasoning with pork. Let the flavors blend for awhile. Fry it up, add it to pasta or eat it by itself with peppers and onions. Put it on a roll and you'd think you were at a county fair.

review/summary: not as good as the almond crunch
review/text: For me, at least, the almond crunch by Mrs. Mays is perfection in a snack, so it is hard to beat.  The pumpkin crunch seemed to have a little bit of a smokey flavor when you first bite in, which was surprising to me (though I have not really had many pumpkin seeds as a snack before), and I was expecting a bit more sweetness to it, similar to the almond crunch.  Overall, this is a great snack, and very addictive once you start munching!  You can tell that Mrs. Mays uses high quality ingredients in their snack foods, making for a great, healthy, tasty snack!

review/text: This product is portrayed as healthy and natural, but I was shocked and dismayed to see that it's shipped from halfway across the world. I understand buying electronics, shoes, etc. from China, but my FOOD? I doubt the safety of this food product, and don't see how they can guarantee that  it's vegan, non-GMO, dairy free, wheat-free, gluten-free, etc. Plus I don't see the point in purchasing something that has obviously left such a hefty carbon footprint. But beyond that, how hard is it to make a delicious snack like this in the USA, from USA-grown ingredients? Seriously?

review/text: The tree arrived quickly and is in perfect health.  The one I received was pot bound and needed a haircut but a quick root and stem trim and this problem was solved.  The rosemary is a great little tree to have in a kitchen.  It smells nice, is easy to care for and you can pinch off a bit to use in cooking.<br /><br />Update August 2011  - This little guy is still going strong.  I have had a issue with aphids at least twice but I sprayed the plant with soapy water and they went away.  I don't want to use insecticide and especially not the systemic stuff since we use the rosemary in our food.

review/summary: With a little work, looks very nice
review/text: This product arrived very well packed. The branches are all compressed together when removed from the box so some artful shaping is required.  The stems seem to be made of malleable wire wrapped in brown florist tape.  The flowers are cut from some material (silk?) and mounted around each of the tiny "grain of wheat" lamps. The power supply is a relatively large and heavy wall-wart that will tend to slip out of the outlet.  My outlets are old and I had to use a short stub of an extension cord so the power supply could lie on the floor rather than hang from the wall.<br /><br />When illuminated, the tree is really lovely.  The light is fairly dim and it makes a perfect accent piece in a darkish room.  My sole concern at this point is how long the bulbs will last.  As the package insert notes, they are not replaceable.<br /><br />If you have a corner that needs an Asian accent, this could be it.

review/text: My dobermans love Yuppy Puppy. The enclosed pamphlet says it can take up to two weeks for your dog to learn how to work it, but that is probably an exaggeration as food is a great motivator. One of my dogs learned how to use it in under five minutes, using her paw, the other took about a day and prefers to use her snout to depress the lever. I tried to teach her with her paw but she learned her own way to do it. It is cute to watch them and is much anticipated when I say "Work the Machine!" Product is built sturdy for heavy use by mongrels and stays in place well. Doesn't tip over. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Interesting new taste
review/text: Has a nice unique nutty taste, I thought this was a new cheerios flavor, but it's something altogether different.<br /><br />Each piece of cereal has small little nuts on it, is very crunchy, and maintains freshness.<br /><br />I tend to eat healthy cereal, so I likely won't switch to this, but as a snack it is quite good.

review/summary: Quite addictive, even to a person who doesn't like sweet cereal!
review/text: I am usually not a fan of sweet cereals, but I saw this new cereal from Kellogg's and it looked so good I decided to try it.  It is reminiscent of Honey Nut Cheerios (HNCs), though I have only had that product once several years ago.  Nutritionally, they are very similar (I looked up the nutritional data on the HNCs at their website).  This product has 1 more gram of sugar than the HNCs and a little less fat than HNCs, but otherwise the nutritional data are very close.<br /><br />I tried Crunchy Nut both as a cereal with milk and alone as a snack and enjoyed it both ways.  As a snack, I found it a bit too sweet but still enjoyable due to its intense crunch.  With milk, the sweetness was much less pronounced and I enjoyed it more.  It holds up GREAT to milk.  The downside of it staying so crunchy in milk is that the roof of my mouth got abraded a bit by the roughness of the nut bits.  The milk gets colored a strange caramel color that was off-putting to me at first, but it wasn't a big deal.<br /><br />I went through this box like lightning!  I do eat cereal most every day for breakfast but I don't usually go through a box that quickly.  Of course, I was also eating it as a snack in the evening, so that was part of the reason.  Another is that this box is considerably smaller than the boxes of the cereal I usually eat (regular Cheerios, Complete Wheat Bran, Crispix).  The box I had was 10.8 oz.<br /><br />Note that I did not order this cereal through Amazon--I bought it at my local supermarket--as such, this is only a review of the cereal itself as I can't speak to the seller or the shipping.  I do note that this product is not sold by Amazon itself but by another seller and that there are shipping charges.  I always advise Amazon customers to be very aware of these shipping charges when buying from other sellers, as sometimes they are more than the cost of the product iself.

review/summary: Tasty, Nutty Cereal That Stays Crispy in Milk
review/text: I liked this cereal.  When I opened it, the smell reminded me of Cracker Jacks, I suppose due to the corn & peanuts.  The combination of corn & oats was delicious & the lightly sweetened peanut flavor was a plus.  I'm not a huge fan of overly-sweetened cereals, and I found this cereal to be sweetened just enough.  It stays crispy in milk long enough for you to finish the bowl without the final spoonfuls being a soggy mess.  I docked them one star, however, because I found that many of the small peanut pieces had come off of the "O's" in transit & settled to the bottom of the package.  I'm not sure how they could be adhered better to the "O's" without adding additional sugar, however, so I suppose this was to be expected some what.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: As other reviewers have noted already, this seems to be Kellogg's attempt to replicate Honey Nut Cheerios, at least in appearance.  Nutritionally the two are also very similar.  Crunchy Nut tastes sweeter and I found myself eating it as a snack.  I can't say the taste is too similar to HNC so just because you like one doesn't mean you'll necessarily like the other.  Overall it's definitely to my liking and I can see myself buying both Crunchy Nut and HNC.

review/summary: delicious cereal.
review/text: This sweet, crunchy cereal for grown-ups. It has a very nice crunch and just the right amount of sweet taste. It makes good snack out of the box or a good cereal for breakfast. It stays crunchy even in milk and one bowl is not enough. I liked it better than any cereal that I've tried lately.

review/summary: A Little Extra Crunch
review/text: Seriously, how do you review a cereal? Let me take a swing at it.<br /><br />Essentially, these are Honey Nut Cheerios with a little added crunch from nut like pieces (not sure if they are real nut pieces as they do not quite have the appropriate texture) adhered to the corn/oat meal donuts. They stay crunchy in milk longer than Cheerios but the flavor seems about the same. As far as nutrition, this is a sweetened cereal with all of the added RDA of vitamins and minerals associated with breakfast cereals. I find nothing disagreeable about this cereal, but the crunchiness brings to mind the 'non-nutritive coating' of Chevy Chase from Christmas Vacation.<br /><br />Ultimately, it is all about the flavor of the cereal and whether it appeals to you, as most cereals of this sort are comparable. Try it, if you like it buy more, if not go back to your other favorites. P-)
