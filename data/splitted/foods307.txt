review/summary: Greenies Joint Care
review/text: I am so glad to have found this product.  My dog had a problem on walks when he would have to pull up his rear leg and hop.  As a puppy he was operated on with little success. The Doctor said it was common in Yorkies and there was nothing more they could do.  Now he is 4 years old and with the addition of Greenies Joint Care I rarely see him limp. He LOVES the taste, he can't wait to get his daily "bone"

review/text: Muir Glen cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol A. Too bad because this was a great product and was a standard in my household. My initial conversations with them they contradicted this fact, which to me was misleading. General Mills owns Cascadian Farms as well and now I don't buy there either.<br />Now we use BioNature in jars or Pomi products in Tetra Pak cartons. All canned tomato products use BPA and so do many of the lids of jars used in food containment.<br />Now I also just make from scratch which is made simple by chef Andrew Carmellini in Everyday Italian. Lydia Bastianich is another favorite chef that deserves mention for simple yet big flavors.<br />Boil, peel, freeze and store. Can manufacturing companies that I corresponded with said they were working on a solution for later this year or next year.

I usually pay almost 2x more for these at the grocery store, over a can of standard crushed tomatoes, and even though I am a cheapy, I never hesitate.  It's worth the extra money, without a doubt.

If he won't eat it knowing how my cat loves tuna, I won't either. It's not even pure tuna in water. It contains vegetable broth with soy on top of the salt that's in there. This little can has 350 mg. of sodium. Truly disgusting.<br /><br />There's another good review of the same tuna which is the one I saw. Had I seen these I wouldn't have bought this. I'm going to post this on the other page too.

review/text: I bought a bunch of these from Walgreens just to find that none of the cans had chunks of tuna in them. They should probably re-label this product to "tuna soup" since this is really what this is. The pieces are so tiny that they literally ooze out of the can as you drain the water out of it. Plus who in their right mind would name a brand of canned tuna 'Chicken of the Sea'?

review/text: I don't like all the controversy surrounding rawhide bones and don't want take the risk of my Lab getting a blockage so I exclusively give him Booda bones which are safe. My lab is an aggressive chewer and considering this is edible it makes him that much more excited as he LOVES food. He enjoys these bones but devours them in less than 20 minutes. I usually give it to him for a few minutes until he eats half of it and then I take it away to save for next time. This obviously would get very expensive so he has his non-edible Nylabones most of the time and these are special treats.

review/summary: Goodbye Rawhides! Hello Peace of Mind - & Dogs Love 'em!
review/text: Love these! Well, because...we have 3 dogs (2 were unplanned children ;-) & our 60-LB German Shepherd AND our 40-LB we-have-no-clue-what-she-is dog have both choked on various shapes & sizes of rawhides. The Shepherd choked so badly that, this time, it wouldn't come up. She couldn't cough & started to literally choke to death. I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do - the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway? Well, I tried anyway and thank God it finally did dislodge & we got it out! Was it the Heimlich? I don't know. Probably not. I mean, she still won't tell me... After all, I guess it was very traumatic for her.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, what I do know, is that was the last time any of my dogs have had any kind of regular rawhide bones! Which, I really wanted to let everyone know of my personal experiences; I believe anybody who is at all concerned about giving their dogs rawhides and/or experiencing a similar problem is on the right track to avoid them.<br /><br />Our small part Chihuawa/part something else, first 2 times in-a-row, threw up repeatedly w/rawhide pieces and w/foam. He was VERY sick the 3rd time, so we definitely stopped that! The ONLY kind I did finally take a chance with were granulated rawhide munchy sticks, & they're all fine w/these; though I'm still nervous about them choking on a piece, but neither of them have had any problems with Boodas so far, & they don't swell up in their throats like regular rawhides.<br /><br />So, now... It's Booda Bones!<br /><br />Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially for my 2 larger aggressive chewers. I agree with some other reviewers that they are not very long-lasting. But it's all I'll give them now. But, for my half Chihuahua/half something else(20lbs), I give him the smallest ones and they are like mega-saurus bones for him(it is my hope that the manufacturer will start selling these in bulk packages, for less $). I get 3 different sizes for my 3 different whatever-they-are-dogs. They absolutely love them! This includes the assorted flavors, the bacon-flavored, and the yogurt-flavored. Whichever is cheaper at the time and shipped by Amazon.<br /><br />And I owe a big thank you to Brian Amazon, all of you for all of your reviews, Booda Bones, and Amazon!<br /><br />** Confession: This was originally a comment I posted to a reviewer by the name of "Brian Amazon" a long time ago. I have been buying Bones from Amazon, and, only Booda Bones, ever since. They are so great that I've been wanting to write a review, & now finally have the chance to (I have, however, resorted to copying and pasting much of my original [brief... LOL] comment, with some editing).

review/summary: More of a treat then something to keep your dog busy.
review/text: Let me start by saying our dogs love these. As soon as they see the bag they stop whatever they're doing and run to their crates (where we typically give these to them). However, for our dogs these are definitely more of a treat then an activity. I have one dog who is an aggressive chewer who finishes these in under five minutes. He doesn't chew them as much as bite of chunks of it. My other dog isn't quite as strong of a chewer but it usually takes her just around fifteen minutes to eat the whole thing (this review is specific to the Biggest Boodas). So for my dogs this is less of a chewing experience and more of a treat. And when the eat them this quickly, they do get expensive quick.

review/summary: THE BEST!
review/text: I have a dog who until we adopted her never had oral care,so her teeth were in bad shape. We brush her teeth every 3 weeks and give her 1 booda bone weekly . Not only are her teeth cleaner but some of the staining has gone away. Our vet told us that these are the best thing for her because they digest easily and do not contain plastics.

review/summary: NOT the regular size gumballs that you see in the store
review/text: Bought these thinking they were the 'regular-size' gumballs sold in the store, variety tubes, as pictured, but was delivered tiny 'penny' gumballs in tubes, and they are ALL pink.<br /><br />The regular size gumballs sell between 80 cents and a dollar a piece, so this seemed like a good deal, getting 36 tubes for $16.<br /><br />The tubes that I received are all marked "25 CENTS" right on top, but as you will notice in the picture on the listing, the tubes are all turned around so that you can't SEE this.<br /><br />(However, the photo DOES feature the variety of colors/flavors).<br /><br />Do the math, 25 cents a tube, 36 tubes, $9.00.  I just paid $15.90 for $9 (RETAIL) worth of gum.<br /><br />Deceptive listing.  Feeling ripped off.<br /><br />OH, and to top it all off....they're STALE.

review/summary: Highest quality organic soy milk + shelf stable + delicious!!
review/text: EdenSoy is a brand that I have come to trust. We try to only eat organic and natural healthy foods, and all of the EdenSoy products are pantry staples in our home. They adhere to the highest standards for both product and manufacturing processes, far exceeding the requirements for organic certification. This is the most delicious soy milk we have tried, and I like that it is enriched with vitamins. Our daughter loves the vanilla. I like all of the flavors. I use it to mix up my protein vitamin shakes - YUM! Another great idea: add frozen banana slices and ice to the soy milk, blend, and you have a terrific healthy breakfast smoothie that the kids (and you) will love! Great to have milk in a shelf-stable package -- just chill when you choose, or pour over ice when you want to enjoy a healthy delicious drink. I used to order cases directly from EdenSoy (at high shipping cost due to weight!) Now I am SO happy that Amazon is carrying this soymilk (and other EdenSoy products) with free super-saver shipping!!

review/summary: There are two types of Edensoy Vanilla Soy Milk.
review/text: Edensoy Vanilla soy milk comes in fortified with vitamins, and regular without additional vitamins.  I love the regular unfortified vanilla soy milk.  It is especially delicious with cereal.  There may be some confusion about this product because it comes in two different versions.  The fortified version, which has vitamins and minerals added to it, I found to be terrible tasting because I could actually taste the vitamins and minerals.  (I take a vitamin pill every day, but I do not want that vitamin taste in my soy milk.)

review/text: I have tried many different soymilks.  Some are OK and some are terrible.  The bad ones taste like latex paint, or worse yet, sweetened latex paint.  But this one, especially when cold, is, in my opinion, excellent.  I find it exceptionally refreshing.  I prefer the 8.45-ounce boxes, because the flavor is not as good after the box has been open for a while and the product has been exposed to oxygen.

review/summary: not a true soymilk drinker
review/text: i'm not one of those people that love stuff knowing it's good for you. it has to taste fairly ok at least, but when this soymilk is cold(it has to be cold for me to like it) it hits the spot-especially if you're hungry and you need a quick fix. i tried other brands of soymilk and hated them all, but this vanilla flavor has a nice hint of nuttyness. it tastes smooth and fresh(some other brands had this "old" flavor) and really soothes an empty belly. i've reordered this product a couple of times from amazon and i'll continue to do so-it's more expensive in the grocery.<br /><br />...it's been several months now of reordering and it's still wonderful, unfortunately, i only now realize that it does contain wheat and my family and i are allergic.<br />i wasn't careful to look at the ingredients and i've finally traced the bloating etc. to the wheat in the soy milk. sooooooo sad, because it is the only soy milk that i like :^(

review/text: I'm new to drinking soy milk.  I first tried Silk vanillaand really enjoyed it. I think I can easily swich from fat free milk to drinking soymilk. Next I decided to try another brand, EdenSoy, which I ended up spilling in the sink (on purpose.) This milk is too disqusting for me to drink.  The color is not even white, it's grayish which is not appetizing. The taste is not to my liking so I won't purchase this brand again.  But I'll keep drinking other brands of soymilk.

I use this coconut milk all the time and was excited to see the price that Amazon was offering it at, but like one other reviewer reported all six of the cans came with dents...and not just tiny ones. The box they came in was in perfect condition so I can only come to a similar conclusion that Amazon is trying to offload the undesirable cans without disclosing their compromised condition. Pretty lame and shady if you ask me. My first thought was to return them, but apparently grocery items are not eligible for return.

review/text: I ordered this product last week, got it right on time, BUT, it wasn't what I was expecting. I have ordered what I thought was the same product before, the label has changed but I didn't think too much of that. The issues I have with this product are - it has water as an added ingredient, I know the light coconut milk has water added but I have never purchased full fat coconut milk with water added, it has no "solids" in the can, the full fat milk I have purchased before (I thought this was the exact same thing) had a good chunk of solids at the top, this is straight liquid and to top it off the cans are a mess! I ordered 12 cans total and I think at least 9 are dented, one significantly. Just very unhappy, if I had wanted light coconut milk I would have ordered it.

review/summary: Slowly Smoked Pork is Delicious
review/text: I buy this same Karaj Hungarian Pork Loin regularly at our local Hungarian grocer, and have found it delicious. It serves well as a quick snack, or as a sandwich fixing (with a little mustard or light BBQ sauce).<br /><br />Imagine the aroma of a nearby campfire, after pork has lingered on the grill, but not burnt. Somehow, that flavor, through careful smoking and salting, is infused into the Karaj Hungarian Pork Loin.<br /><br />I prefer it in thin slices, eaten cool, but it is also an ingredient in various Hungarian soups. It goes well in a kind of pigs-in-a-blanket crescent roll wrap. Take an uncooked crescent roll, place a thin slice of the karaj, and bake as usual. Very fun for parties -- something different in the midst of something familiar. We serve it guests when we need a quick, tasty snack.<br /><br />It isn't spicy even though it is packed with taste. Fans of BBQ joints and smokehouse steakhouses with find the flavor familiar.<br /><br />It keeps around six months unopened. I fully recommend the Karaj Hungarian Pork Loin.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com

review/text: With so many different PEZ dispensers out there, how can I say that you ask?  There are a couple of reasons.<br /><br />First, most PEZ dispensers are simply that: PEZ dispensers.

This one is also a pullback car, which crosses the floor at a pretty good clip.<br /><br />Second, I'm old enough to remember when PEZ dispensers actually shot the candy into your mouth.  Trial lawyers ended that fun; modern PEZ dispensers are designed to merely push a piece of candy out far enough so that you can grab it with your fingers.  However, these PEZ dispensers use an entirely different mechanism, and at least in some of them, when you push down the button at the front, you can bounce candy off the ceiling!<br /><br />Note: Should you be so lucky as to acquire one of these accidental throwbacks, please be content to catch the candy in your mouth ON THE REBOUND off the ceiling, and for God's sake don't tell a trial lawyer!<br /><br />There are seven other models that I know of, differing only in plastic color, paint, and decals:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00176GRDU">PEZ Candy Dispenser NASCAR Race Car Blue #24 Jeff Gordon</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00176B76C">PEZ Candy Dispenser NASCAR Race Car Red #9 Kasey Kahne</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N531RG">PEZ Candy Dispenser NASCAR Race Car Blue #2 Rusty Wallace</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002F8PXAW">PEZ Candy Dispenser NASCAR Race Car Yellow #17 Matt Kenseth</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00176IE22">PEZ Candy Dispenser NASCAR Race Car Light Blue #43 Richard Petty</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZWF52E">PEZ Candy Dispenser NASCAR Race Car Green #18 Bobby Labonte</a><br />PEZ Candy Dispenser NASCAR Race Car Black Daytona 500 50th Anniv.<br /><br />Comes with three rolls of PEZ candy.<br /><br />Note: A randomly selected three out of these four: #2, #9, #20, and #24, is also available here: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KTA000">PEZ NASCAR Pull and Go Cars O.87-Ounce Assorted Cars & Candy Dispenser (Pack of 3)</a>.

review/text: Two of my dogs have sensitive stomachs and they not only gobbled this down, but kept it down.  I mix it with Hill's Science diet kibble to give them some variety.  The down side is it does have a strong smell, but so does natural fish.  I wish it weren't as expensive, but it does beat having to clean up from a sensitive doggy tummy.

review/summary: Listed for dogs loved by cats
review/text: I know this product is listed for dogs but my cats love it.  They are not beggars but when we have smoked salmon out they go nuts and this is the next best thing.  Even my shy boy who does not usually take treats goes for it.  I am not a pet food expert but this looks like it is  basically just dried salmon and has to be good for them. Great product, reasonable quantity for the price. One warning - it does smell like salmon and is a bit chewy.  My cats are large and like chewing on it.  Little cats might find it tough.  I will definitely re-order

There isn't a lot to the bag, but my dog is only 10 pounds and luckily they last longer.  But take my word she would eat the whole bag at once if given the chance.  You can't go wrong with these.

review/summary: 2 PAWS UP FOR SALMON PAWS
review/text: As a dog trainer, animal lover and dog mom, I'm very careful about what I feed my dogs. I have them on a homemade diet (if you've seen all the recalls on pet food, you'll understand why) and will only allow them to have commercial treats that are made of high quality products and unquestionable ingredients.<br /><br />I love Salmon Paws because their ingredients are simple and made with human grade food. It says so right on their website. So, it's a treat that I can give them with a sound, peaceful mind. My dogs love Salmon Paws too. If I'm ever having a hard time getting them to eat, I just tear up some salmon pieces and put it in their food. I rotate between the filets and the Salmon Meal Topper Dog Treat--. Within a few seconds, it's gone and they have full, happy bellies.<br /><br />I also use this product to train my dogs. They're easy to rip up and fast to chew. My dogs will do anything for Salmon Paws!

review/summary: What won't she do for these treats?
review/text: My puppy loves Salmon Paws! I was given a free sample by the local pet food store and my puppy loved it! Yes it's more expensive than other treats out there and you don't get a lot, but it's quality - 100% salmon with no fillers. It's recommended that you refrigerate these treats because it's natural and it is fish. My dog is finicky with her food and treats and has rejected so many different treats that the pet stores in the area (with a no-questions asked return policy) let me open bags to let her try in the store just so I can save a trip coming back to return them (she's that bad!). So when I saw her get excited from just having a little bit of Salmon Paws, I just had to get it for her because it's so difficult finding stuff she likes.

I'm not sure what they are saying "tastes-like-chocolate". The carob I'm sure does taste like chocolate. But, the bar itself does not. The bar tastes a little more like rice than anything else to me.

review/text: I love the Alo line of fruit juices, but this stuff is just nasty.  It tastes like the borscht my mom used to make me eat when I was a kid.  I thought I'd be getting something similar to a V8 Splash, but that's just not the case.  The cooked cabbage flavor just overwhelms the beverage, and I couldn't even finish half the bottle.<br /><br />I have to strain the Alo pulp with any of the Alo juices I drink because having floaties in my beverages triggers a gag reflex for me.  But in this case, the gag reflex was triggered even with the Alo pulp strained.<br /><br />I'll be ordering more Alo juices in the future, but definitely not this one.

review/summary: Best PEZ Dispenser EVER!
review/text: With so many different PEZ dispensers out there, how can I say that you ask?  There are a couple of reasons.<br /><br />First, most PEZ dispensers are simply that: PEZ dispensers.  They perform no other function (unless you count "catching dust").  This one is also a pullback car, which crosses the floor at a pretty good clip.<br /><br />Second, I'm old enough to remember when PEZ dispensers actually shot the candy into your mouth.  Trial lawyers ended that fun; modern PEZ dispensers are designed to merely push a piece of candy out far enough so that you can grab it with your fingers.  However, these PEZ dispensers use an entirely different mechanism, and at least in some of them, when you push down the button at the front, you can bounce candy off the ceiling!<br /><br />Note: Should you be so lucky as to acquire one of these accidental throwbacks, please be content to catch the candy in your mouth ON THE REBOUND off the ceiling, and for God's sake don't tell a trial lawyer!<br /><br />There are seven other models that I know of, differing only in plastic color, paint, and decals:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00176GRDU">PEZ Candy Dispenser NASCAR Race Car Blue #24 Jeff Gordon</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00176B76C">PEZ Candy Dispenser NASCAR Race Car Red #9 Kasey Kahne</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N531RG">PEZ Candy Dispenser NASCAR Race Car Blue #2 Rusty Wallace</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002F8PXAW">PEZ Candy Dispenser NASCAR Race Car Yellow #17 Matt Kenseth</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00176IE22">PEZ Candy Dispenser NASCAR Race Car Light Blue #43 Richard Petty</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZWF52E">PEZ Candy Dispenser NASCAR Race Car Green #18 Bobby Labonte</a><br />PEZ Candy Dispenser NASCAR Race Car Black Daytona 500 50th Anniv.<br /><br />Comes with three rolls of PEZ candy.<br /><br />Note: A randomly selected three out of these four: #2, #9, #20, and #24, is also available here: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KTA000">PEZ NASCAR Pull and Go Cars 0.87-Ounce Assorted Cars & Candy Dispenser (Pack of 3)</a>.

review/summary: excellent for cooking
review/text: This oil is fantastic for many great tasting recipes and for Asian cooking in general. Also this oil seems to withstand high heat without burning. In my house we use it all the time for many different dishes. Sesame oil contains vitamin E which is an anti-oxidant. This means it helps lower your cholesterol.<br /><br />I like to cut up broccoli, peppers (green and red), brussel sprouts and a chicken breast. Then I add soy sauce, hot sauce, ginger & garlic paste, water and of course sesame oil. You only need a little sesame oil. Less is better here because if you put too much the sesame oil will overpower the other flavors. A teaspoon or a little less is just right. This makes a quick tasty meal when mixed and stirred in a hot pan on high heat. It only takes about 10 minutes and serves at least 2 people. Very simple and quick meal that tastes great with sesame oil.<br /><br />I'm sure there are loads of tasty sesame oil recipes. All you have to do is search the internet and you'll be busy for hours if you like to cook. The main thing is to use it sparingly. This oil is dark, rich and very tasty.

review/text: This is the best tea I've ever tasted. It is mild--only slightly lemony, a little ginger taste. I drink it every day, all day long. After a year of drinking it, I'm still not tired of it, and I have tried to add other types, but they have all been rejected and given away. I guess I'm stuck on it. And since it's decaf, it's okay to drink a lot, so how can I go wrong? Especially when it contains all those wonderful antioxidants? I really like Numi's Gunpowder Green Tea, as well, but don't drink as much of it because of the caffeine.
