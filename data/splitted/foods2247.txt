review/summary: perfect for porc taco!
review/text: I love this spice mix for my pork tacos: line a crockpot with banana leaves, pop in a pork shoulder (skin removed), pour over 100g Yucateco anchiote mixed with 1/2 cup lime juice and a sliced onion. Cook on high for 6 hours, turn to low til ready to use. Pull meat off into corn tortillas with a bit of the sauce (which can be thickened with yucca) and pickled cabbage-- YUM! I reuse old jars (jam, pickle, mayonnaise)to store the unused spice.

review/summary: Best paste for that Mexican flavor
review/text: When I went to Cancun for vacation the flavor of the meats and poultry had this distinct flavor that I truly enjoyed. When I came home I researched to find the flavor so I could make it at home. This is it and it gives great flavor to Steak and chicken. You don't need the entire package to marinade your food. I add lemon juice, salt and olive oil - Mix and maybe half or a quarter of the spice...and your food will have an authentic Yucatan flavor. Mild and not overbearing !!

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: This paste is wonderful in so many different foods. I combine it with lemon and rub it on a roast chicken or baked cut up chicken or on a thanksgiving turkey. I combine it with chipotle peppers with some adobo sauce and spread it on thinly sliced pork for a few hours then grill it for tacos al pastor along with grilled thinly sliced red onions and sliced grilled pineapple. I use it as part of the seasonings for the chicken that goes in tamales. I use it for about a dozen other recipes. This stuff is amazing and brings life to so many dishes.<br /><br />This spice blend originates in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico (according to my Mom) and is widely used in Mexican cooking. It was originally a Mayan condiment but has spread in use. It consists of Annatto seed along with a number of other spices. It is commonly also called Recado Rojo.<br /><br />Once opened, I store the leftover paste in the refrigerator for best results. That keeps it tasting fresh and helps keep it from drying out.

review/summary: El Yucateco Achiote Red Paste
review/text: My knowledge of the Mexican kitchen is mostly limited to that of the D.F. and state of Mexico so we didn't use achiote all that much. The Yucatan and Quintana Roo produce some delicious dishes and I was curious to try to make some of them, myself. This achiote paste produced just the right color but I found it a bit difficult to get it to dissolve in oil, even with heat and constant stirring. Next time I think I'll try using the actual seeds instead (also available from a supplier to Amazon). I may be wrong but I think achiote is more of a colorante than a saborizante anyway.

review/summary: VERY Spicy and Sweet!
review/text: I tried this for the first time on a variation of pasta primavera consisting of cherry tomatoes, green and red bell peppers, Parmesan cheese, a cup of penne pasta and a quarter cup of the jerk sauce. The sauce is sweet and VERY spicy, but it accentuated the entire dish, providing a rich flavor. Because of the degree of spiciness, I might use less sauce the next time I prepare this dish. Compared to jerk sauces I've had in restaurants, Busha Browne's Original can hold its own, and I look forward to using this in the future not only with pasta, but cooking meat and fish as well.

review/text: I have now bought these "dried" cranberries as well as Traverse Bay's dried cranberries.  This is a 5 pound bag.  Traverse Bay sells a 4 pound box.  The Traverse Bay box is DRASTICALLY larger than this 5 pound bag.  Why?  Because the cranberries from Traverse Bay are DRIED.  These are partially dried and have a nice sticky puddle of cranberry juice in one corner of the bag.  FAIL!  Go buy Traverse Bay's dried cranberries.  They're about the same price and you get drastically more.  I won't be paying for liquid again.

review/summary: Flavorful, but difficult to store and use
review/text: I had been using this product to make homemade Nicaraguan chorizo. This product is indeed flavorable and authentic. However, I found that it dries out and hardens before I have the chance to use all of it, even if kept in the plastic bag it's packaged in and then sealed inside a Tupperware container. For this reason, I now order annatto (achiote) powder instead, and add additional flavorings to it, according to a recipe in one of my Nicaraguan cookbooks. I figure I can't get more authentic than to use a cookbook that was published in Nicaragua (not here in the States) and use the exact ingredients the recipe calls for. I can also control the ingredients to avoid unnecessary preservatives and such.

And if it can help him with his weight issues (he's almost 15 and a half pounds!), too, then that's an added bonus.<br /><br />I also like the fact that this product is readily available in stores.

review/text: I think this wine turned out very well.  It is somewhat sweet, but not too sweet.<br /><br />I am giving 4 out of 5 because you will need to make sure you have a carboy that can hold at least 7 1/2 to 8 gallons of liquid.  There is a cherry mix you add in, which is at least another gallon or gallon and a half (they don't specify in the instructions).  You will also still have to be able to add in the stabilizing agents and have enough room to be able to stir everything without the displaced wine overflowing out of the carboy.<br /><br />Other than that minor setback, this kit is very good.

review/summary: Oh so virital flavorings
review/text: We love flavored coffees but the price is just to high so I bought orange flavor, hazelnut flavor, cherry flavor, caramel flavor, and chocolate flavor powers, to make my own and they work very well. we can flavor by the cup or the pot and we are very happy with them.<br /><br />With some experimentation we fond all but the chocolate dissolve in cold. So we can and do use it in ice coffee, and we can now make our own flavored water with out having to pay the overly high price.

review/summary: Great Food
review/text: Pet guardians, please take the time to educate yourselves on what goes into your pet's food. That initiative will give them the gift of a longer, healthier life, eliminate many chronic health issues that pets face, save you money in vet bills in the long run... the list of benefits goes on and on.<br /><br />I have done extensive research on canine and feline nutrition and I highly recommend, if you are going to feed commercial food, Welless, California Naturals or Innova. For a great complete meal, I give my dogs all one of those dry foods mixed with a little bit of canned from the same brands, water for hydration, a touch of a good quality essential oil (such as olive, flax, etc.), a touch of powdered kelp and alfalfa, a splash of organic apple cider vinegar, Prozyme digestive enzymes to unlock the nutrients in all that good food and top with a dollop of plain yogurt. It sounds like a lot, but it takes me less than 5 minutes to assemble the meals for 6 dogs - and they are ridiculously healthy an full of energy, even our 3 seniors who are 11, 12 and 13. I have two seniors with heart murmurs and at our most recent vet check, my dog with the worst heart murmur, a 12 year old beagle that I love desperately, had a 2-grade improvement in condition severity - that is HUGE. Good nutrition makes all the difference and, as an added bonus, I have yet to meet a dog that doesn't like it!

review/summary: This used to be a wonderful tea
review/text: I ordered this tea and instead of receiving Pomegranate Rose Tea, which I have had before and which I love, I was sent Pom and Petals Tea.  I tried it thinking it might be the same tea with a new label and new container.  It is NOT the same tea.  Pomegranate Rose tea was a delicious, aromatic tea that came in a lovely container, but appears to have been discontinued by Zhena's.  Pom and Petals is a disappointing, bland tea in a dull container.  Pomegranate Rose tea is no longer advertised at Zhena's website.  I called Vitamin Shoppe directly to ask if they had Pomegranate Rose tea rather than Pom and Petals.  The sales person assured me that they did, so I placed a large order, thinking that even though the tea appears to have been discontinued, perhaps Vitamin Shoppe still had some left.  To my enormous disappointment, the tea sent was again Pom and Petals.  They are now allowing me to return it at their expense.  I can't fathom why Zhena's would change from making their wonderful Pomegranate Rose tea to making Pom and Petals, which is what you now get when you order Pomegranate Rose.

review/summary: Now Pom & Petals Tea
review/text: Unlike the other reviewers for this product, I never tried the "Pomegranate Rose" version of this tea, and so I cannot compare it to the product they are now sending, which is called Pom & Petals. On the actual company website for Zhena's Gypsy Tea they seem to make it sound like the two teas are identical and they have simply changed the name.<br /><br />Anyways, the other reviewers are right - if you are ordering this and expecting to receive a tea called Pomegranate Rose, you won't. You're going to receive something called Pom & Petals. But I actually ordered this hoping for Pom & Petals, because I absolutely love it. I first tried the Pom&Petals tea in a sample stacker tin, and had to order the full size because I loved it so much.<br /><br />It has a subtle, gentle, floral taste to it, with a tiny hint of berry. When I take a sip it makes me think of shades of pink and Victorian gardens. Anyways, I'm not a sophisticated tea drinker but I really like it.

review/summary: Blah and Bland
review/text: I should have read the other review before purchasing this tea. I was also sent Pom and Petals in place of this tea that's pictured. The Pom and Petals tea which appears to be the replacement for the discontinued tea pictured is pretty terrible. It's bland. It only tastes mildly like tea at all, and the only flavor I can discern is from the green tea. There is not hint of rose petal or pomegranate.<br />Even the design on the tin is boring. I had a tin of Zhena's from several years ago that I've used for my makeup brushes. This one is simply dull.<br /><br />Save your money. I had a better pomegranate tea from Trader Joe's.

I prefer to make my own pastes for thai/cambodian curries whenever I can, so I value flavor - but don't really want to bash at a mortar/pestle for 40 minutes each time.  For a premade paste, this is really excellent, particularly given how hard it is to find premade massaman paste in North America.  I will try other Nittaya pastes soon.

review/summary: Fruit flavored blue and yellow, pink is yummier!
review/text: Pretty good, but I actually prefer "Fluffy Stuff" as the best packaged cotton candy I've tried.  That tastes better, and has a better and finer texture.  The description containing the information that the various colors are fruit flavored is somewhat buried and I unfortunately missed it when I purchased this.  Pink is the nondescript, just-sweet flavor I like.  I don't detect any fruity flavor, just maybe slight vanilla.  The blue (berry) however tastes like cough syrup and the yellow (pina colada supposedly) is pretty gross to me.  I've had a few bags that were all pink and those are pretty good.  I honestly do not enjoy the mixed ones nearly as much and neither do the kids.  Also, there are large, sharp fragments of sugar that irritate the tongue/mouth as does the coarseness of the candy.  There are occasional hard chunks that look like moisture got in.

But when I saw these bags laying at everyone's seat, I was amazed. The cotton candy was fluffy and fresh! It was a huge hit. One problem we did run into was when we left a bag in the car the heat must have caused it to melt because it was extremely hard after that. Our fault and not the makers. Also, don't get this for the yellow. We bought 3 cases and not a single bag had yellow.

review/summary: He was right
review/text: I am nuts about Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee, but I simply cannot afford it. It my neck of the woods it sells for about $50 a pound. I asked a coffee vendor at a food fair what's a poor retired coffee lover to do, and he said a group of Jamaicans emigrated to Papua New Guinea carrying Jamaica Blue seedlings and the coffee produced from these plants is coming in a close second. I bought some. He was right. Now I get regular deliveries. I usually prefer a medium roast, but this City Roast (much darker) is okay, and the price is right. Lainie

review/summary: Helps With Migraines
review/text: I bought this in hopes of regulating my hyperthyroidism. I haven't had blood tests since I began taking it so I can't vouch for whether it has made a difference in that respect, but I have certainly felt a change in symptoms. It used to be impossible to adapt to a temperature change quickly, I would be shaky often, and felt fatigued all the time but had difficulty falling asleep. Since just a few days after I began taking this, I found that I can sleep fewer hours and actually feel rested in the morning. Gradually the shaking and temperature issues have improved too. The surprise benefit though was that my migraines have gotten so much less frequent. I have had daily migraines for years that have been treated by a neurologist, and the traditional medications have helped reduce the pain somewhat but never made them go away completely. I didn't notice right away but suddenly realized one day that I had been able to go two weeks without a triptan, and I couldn't remember the last time I had been able to have such a long break from them. With the side effects of chest pain and dizziness along with not even fully relieving the migraine, I am pretty happy not to have to take those too often anymore. I have had no side effects with maca and have recommended it to friends.

review/summary: One of the best I've found...
review/text: I've been taking Maca root daily for about 4 years now and it has literally changed my life.  All brands are not of the same quality and I can tell very quickly if a product is not going to work for me.  Overall, I've tried about 4 different brands.  I ordered and have been using the Navitas Naturals Gelatinized Maca Extract for about 2 weeks now and it is every bit as potent as my previous favourite brand at about half the price.  I will definitely buy it again.

review/summary: It works but the taste is not so good!
review/text: I have tried this brand and another brand that is not gelatinized. The gelatinized is harder to get down. I probably should have bought the pills. But I am still taking the powder. I have had my endocrine system go crazy after the birth of my daughter. This seems to be helping. I had gone for months without remembering any dreams. But I have noticed that now, I can actually remember some of my dreams. I definitely recommend this product but just remember that the taste and smell might turn you off. If you don't think you can handle that, then I strongly suggest getting this in pill form.

I mean, who can ever resist chocolate? Just thinking of it already makes me hungry. These mixes can also be used as frostings, fruit dips or a simple muffin spread. It truly offers a favorable variety! Definitely something you wouldn't want to miss!

review/summary: "they weren't what we thought they were"
review/text: they call it (primrose) BLACK taffy jack licorice...OK, but it's not black, and it doesn't taste much like licorice.  the pink, black and white wrapping is deceiving, as was the description of the item.  i was lead (maybe by my own wishful thinking) to think these would be similar to the licorice taffy of my childhood.  they were wrapped in black, white and soft pink paper, like the picture, but they were a thin square shape.  this taffy is light brown caramel colored, with a black spot in the middle (licorice?), and dark/hot pink (the color anti-freeze used to be) around one end.  obviously, not at all what i'd hoped for.  a little off, licorice taste...funny/weird after taste.  they were not cheap, so i'll eat the ones i don't give away.  pretty much a disappointment, that i won't reorder.  next time i'll definitely order the claey's licorice hard candy, again.  so much for experimentation...and expanding my horizons.

review/summary: Tasty Bag of Taffy
review/text: I love salt water taffy, but wanted only black licorice which I couldn't find easily.  So I tried this, and the taste isn't exactly the same, but I still love it.  Also, if you're curious about how much 3 lbs is, like I was, it's about enough to fill a small shoebox.  The day mine came it was 90 degrees outside, so there was a little melting.  Luckily taffy never has a perfect shape and I just stuck it in the fridge to harden.  All in all, I might get it again.  The price is a bit of an issue, taffy always seems expensive for candy... but if I had a gift card, I wouldn't hesitate to get it again.

review/summary: This is fabulous chocolate!
review/text: Dagoba New Moon is a must have for chocoholics like me. The flavor is rich with subtle overtones. Any higher cocoa content and the flavor loses its richness and is overwhelmed with bitterness. I recommend heating a half bar in the microwave until it slightly melts, then having fun scooping the melted chocolate into your mouth with a spoon to savor the magnificent flavor.

review/text: I buy this product on the subscription program and send it to my daughter out of state.  Typical teenager periodically runs out of money before payday and it makes me feel better as a parent that while I won't just send her money - she at least has food at hand when needed.  And these granola bars fit the bill.<br /><br />The chocolate chip are the best.  I've ordered three times now over the past 10 months and every bar right down to the 12th box has been soft and chewy.  That 12th box has come at the 3-4 month mark at times.  SO, if you are concerned about the shelf life - at three different times these have easily lasted past 3 months.

review/summary: Too much filler material, but chocolate chip the best flavor
review/text: I'm not a big fan of the new type of Quaker Oats granola bar; lot's of barley/rice filler material, not many oats.  However, the chocolate chip is the best tasting in my opinion- well, maybe it ties with the peanut butter chocolate chunk.  There are enough chocolate chips in the bar to give the moist fattiness that we all desire, yet the chocolate chips are small enough such that you don't feel too guilty eating them.  Maybe that's a bad thing, because it encourages you to reach for another.<br /><br />The granola bars seem a bit smaller than I remember, but there's plenty of flavor packed inside.  These aren't too healthy; still a lot of corn syrup (though no "high" fructose corn syrup as they stress), fructose, dextrose, hydrogenated oils, etc..  Not intended to be a meal replacement bar (unless you ate the whole box), but they're a tasty, traditional snack.
