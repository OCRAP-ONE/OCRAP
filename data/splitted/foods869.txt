review/summary: great instant coffee
review/text: I loike coffee but when camping I do not have the patience for perc'ing, nor do I want to carry the equipment. Sure there are some lightweight presses, but this coffee is good and there's no need to carry the extra bulk! I use it at home at times too. I use a small pair of scissors to open the pack rather than the tear open. I find that simpler; have the small scissors in the package of coffee.

review/summary: Expiration Date too close.
review/text: I bought a couple of packs of the decaf and the expiration date was further out to March 2013.  When Starbucks has them (all flavors) on sale for around $25 shipped, I bought a pack of the Italian Roast.  I was disappointed that this package received will expired November 27, 2012.  I was hope to have a further date because I don't drink them everyday.  Emailed Starbucks and they said products still good 75 days past expiration date and if I don't want it, return for full refund.  Amazon do not have a return policy on food items and Starbucks didn't offer to refund my shipping this item back to them.  I just have to take their words for it and keep the package.  Sending it back at my expense isn't worth the hassle.<br /><br />I think I shouldn't worry about expiration dates so close but if Starbucks drop the prices, you know they're getting rid of expire soon coffees.  I probably buy at local Costco next time.

review/text: I am a coffee snob.  I don't like Folgers, Maxwell House, etc.  I like strong (put hair in places it shouldn't be) coffee.  I want it to wake me up.  I want full flavor.  I always (and I means always) have Via Sticks in my office.  I keep them in my purse and travel with them.  Starbucks has changed my attitude about instant coffee--this isn't your grandparents Sanka :)  The price here is better than even sale prices at the Warehouse clubs so I definitely stock up when needed.

review/text: I truly love this product and always carry it with me when I travel.  My only complaint is the packaging used on the product which is sold at Costco, which contains 24 packets.  Short of a hacksaw, there's no easy way to get it open.  The product inside makes it worthwhile, but come on, guys.  You advertise it as being a 'green' product, but this package had to have used up at least one tree and some mighty tough plastic.

review/summary: Expiration dates - Seriously, ignore them.
review/text: A lot of people have been posting about the near-expired dates on the coffee. First, I'd like to mention that this product is intentionally labeled to have a really short shelf-life, and not to ensure freshness.<br /><br />The funny thing about expiration dates is that for something like this, it honestly doesn't matter. I've gotten batches that are expired (for cheaper) and the taste is the same great amazing taste as it was when it was well within the "Best Until" range. Yes, I have taken two packs, one expired and one not expired, and they both are the same delicious taste.<br /><br />The reality is that expiration dates are a wonderful tool that make people throw perfectly fine food and go out and buy more. Especially with dairy products: If it's a few days over, most people will toss out cartons of perfectly good milk or eggs that could keep for another five weeks, which keeps people buying it more frequently. The fact is, if you would drink it without knowing the expiration date is past (it doesn't smell or look bad) then it's not only safe to eat, but a waste to toss.<br /><br />This isn't true for drugs, however. If your medicine says it's expired, it's expired. Also, condoms. Those do lose integrity over time.<br /><br />So, this is a product that intentionally has a very short shelf-life because it makes ridiculous people go, "Oh, no, instead of getting it cheaper online and in bulk, I'll just buy a lot of more expensive smaller packs for more money." Starbucks enjoys charging their consumers for their instant coffee like it's magical pixie dust, and the only way they can stop people from buying it from other cheaper sources is to give it a tiny shelf-life. Look at some of the other reviews, here. It's working!

review/text: PIcked it up after tasting it in the store, and have been enjoying it all week.  Cannot be any easier -- no cleaning the coffee machine anymore, yeaaaah!  Hot water, dump it in, and mmmm.... and I normally HATE any instant coffee.  This is unlike any instant I've tried, and really does taste as good as Starbucks in the store.  The best part is that you don't need hot water... you can add cold water and ice for an awesome iced coffee.  Am going to try the decaf bc I'm obviously drinking a lot more coffee now that I've discovered this.

Just as if I bought it in the store, but A LOT cheaper.  To do the math for you, it's 70 cents a packet.  That's cheaper than a small cup of 7-11 coffee, but WAY better.  What more can you ask?

review/summary: Best brand of instant coffee
review/text: I love coffee and I'm a big fan of Starbucks regular brewed coffee which I buy a lot of in the stores. I don't drink much instant coffee but I've tried several other brands in the past and didn't think this Starbucks instant coffee could be much better. I was wrong. Starbucks Via instant coffee tastes as close as you can get to regular brewed coffee. I was shocked at how good it is. It's rich, bold, and flavorful. The only downside is the price - it's significantly more than other brands of instant coffees. I still drink mostly fresh brewed coffee but when I can't and need instant I drink Starbucks Via

But I swear it's the same as buying a fresh cup during your morning commute. Most of the oils are dissipated, so you won't have the same strong aroma as freshly brewed, but the flavor is fantastic.

Essentially you can probably mix this product with some sugar and get the same exact product as the iced vias. The only difference is, the iced vias serve 1 16oz drink per packet, while these serve 1 8oz drink.<br /><br />I can't tell the difference between this and columbia, both taste the same to me.

review/text: I ordered these for our small law firm since clients occasionally ask for decaf coffee but it happens so rarely that it is not cost effective to keep decaf coffee beans on hand. Also, it saves the time of having to brew an entirely new pot of coffee. No one can tell that the coffee is out of a packet. It dissolves quickly into a very strong brew.<br /><br />Highly recommended for people who occasionally need just a few cups of coffee.

review/summary: Better than an actual cup of Starbucks
review/text: In my opinion, this actually tastes better than an actual cup of Starbucks coffee.  A real cup of Starbucks will taste burnt but Via does not.  Also, and perhaps most important to me, I can get the temperature of the water to the exact temperature I like before mixing in the Via.  No need to wait for it to cool down.<br /><br />The Amazon price (60 cents/packet when I bought) really makes it worth buying for the convenience alone.  Some people have suggested that this bargain-priced Via is somehow inferior to the one you buy in a Starbucks, e.g. expiration date is sooner, but it looks, smells, and tastes the same as the store-bought.  The expiration date was 10 months ahead, if that's a concern.

In the summer, I also like making iced coffee with this, no need to buy the special iced coffee mix.  I just barely heat the water, mix and add a little cream and some ice cubes.  Works well since I don't use sugar, so can't use the special iced coffee mix.  Recommended.

review/summary: Yum, all i drink is Starbucks
review/text: Yum, if in a need of a quick fix then this is the answer, I sometimes just don't have the time to make a big pot or even use the Keurig, well I don't have a Keurig; I have the other one that Starbucks use to make pods for.... I digress, kidding... Really if you are on the run and only can find a micro wave or a water machine that gives hot water then you're in luck Starbucks!! Ok I have tried the other "freeze dried" coffees, and they suck! Starbucks did a good job on their's. There is only a very slight hint of the freeze dried taste. Make sure your water is hot so that the coffee crystals dissolve...

review/text: There are three of us in the house who enjoy coffee.  This is product is ideal for a quick cup, trip or camping.  It now has a permanent place on our counter top.  A 50 count pack makes the most sense for us.  The Italian blend is fine as well but a bit strong for summer coffee.  I still prefer freshly ground coffee for my morning cup.

review/summary: in-store 82 cents vs. 59 cents for 50-pack
review/text: In preparation for an international trip, where coffee quality would be uncertain, I bought a 12-pack at our local Starbucks store.  I like the quality and convenience so much that I use them at home.<br /><br />This is a very good price for the 50-pack, compared to packets bought in the store (12 for $9.95 = 83 cents each). Perhaps there is a similar discount on 50-packs purchased in the store but I've not seen 50-packs in any of the four Starbucks near us.

review/summary: tiny packet, huge flavor
review/text: WOW I've got to say I am a big fan of the Starbucks Via line now. I've seen it before and always fluffed it off as being a unnecessary waste of money. I mean, instant coffee isn't exactly known for bold taste, which I prefer. I'm  a "coffee snob" who needs a black or bold roast cup of cofeee every morning or I'll be intolerable. My favorite from Starbucks has always been french roast (smoky and strong). After hearing a friend rave about these, I decided to purchase them given how similar our tastes are. I tried both the Italian and French Roast Via in small packs (from target and starbuck stores). Unlike other instant coffee, it doe not include any creamer or sugar. It's just plain black coffee. Each serving pack is so small but it makes a very strong cup with the same quality taste as you would get from Starbucks itself (and so much cheaper too). Alot of people buy this because it's packaging is very convenient for daily use (throw it in your wallet/purse), as well as for travel (I hate hotel/airplane coffee). All you need is hot water, it doesn't even have to be boiling temperature. So fast, so easy. Great for making ice coffee, coffee desserts, frapuchinos, or just your plain cup of joe. Try it!

review/summary: Have You Tried It Iced?
review/text: My favorite is the Italian Roast.  I never liked 'instant' until I tried this.<br /><br />This might sound a bit odd, but I love this even more iced (or at least chilled).  I needed to go spend the day visiting an ailing relative at the hospital a couple of years ago.  I dreaded not being near some decent coffee.  I got the idea to pour a packet into a bottle (16oz) of water that I was taking along.  At least I would have some coffee with me, right.  How bad could it be?  It was great!!<br /><br />Let me say that it takes a while (5-6 minutes) to dissolve and mix properly.  I usually open the bottle, take a small sip of water (leaves a bit more room for 'shaking'), add the packet, shake, and then let it sit a couple of minutes before shaking again.  Instant cold coffee.  I later tried the Starbuck's Iced Coffee packets, but those are way too sweet for me.  I do not like it sweetened.  Those are made to dissolve quickly, but I would rather shake a little longer and wait a few minutes to have this Italian Roast.<br />Of course, you could just add the VIA to a small glass of water, stir, and add ice (which I do if I am home).<br /><br />I find I use the 'bottle method' whenever I will be away from the house for hours.  For me, I use a purse which fits a water bottle perfectly and it's nice to have.  It's also very convenient to throw a few packets of VIA in my purse while I am traveling or away from the house all day just to have with me.  You can get water anywhere, but not always a decent coffee.<br /><br />I realize the review should be ALL about the coffee, but I think anyone looking to purchase this product can be pretty confindent by the *star* rating that the taste is good.  It is!  I just wanted to add that Starbuck's made a customer of me BECAUSE of their VIA Ready Brew and not because I stand in line in one of their stores trying to figure out how to order a coffee.  lol!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00438ZXAM">Starbucks VIA� Ready Brew Italian Roast Coffee (50 count)</a>

review/text: We ordered these coffee packets to use during travel over the holidays.  They are easy to carry and taste much better than any instant coffee I've ever tried.  They come in very handy when you need a mid afternoon coffee break while visiting relatives.  My coffee arrived directly from Starbucks with an April 2012 expiration date-about 5 months away.  The only improvement they could make on this product is to design a package that is easier to open.  While the packs are small and easy to carry, I haven't been able to open one without scissors.<br />Great product-highly recommended.  I think I'll try to add one to some hot chocolate next.

review/text: I was getting sick of the office coffee. (Food catering company generic ground coffee).  I've tried instant coffee like Tasters Choice, and it's extremely weak.  I would have to put twice the suggested amount to make it drinkable, and the taste is still bleh.<br /><br />VIA tastes good, and the Italian roast is nice and strong.  The instructions suggest 8oz of water, I believe.  But I usually put 12oz or a little more of water.  Near the end of the cup, there are still some micro grounds that never dissolved.<br /><br />Overall, good stuff.  Once I finish this 50 pack, I might look into other options, but this one seems pretty good.

I sometimes do not feel like brewing a whole pot. I especially love the decaf version for later at night when I want a cup of coffee.<br /><br />Buying the 50 count does work out cheaper than the grocery store or Starbucks retail stores per packet. My package had a good expiration date although it took me less than a month to finish the whole box between home and office.<br /><br />I am ordering more of the regular Italian Roast and the decaf version.

I stayed away from the Via when it first came out because I'd never had an instant coffee that wasnt nasty. But when Starbucks ran a big promotion I decided to give it a try and I'm SO glad I did. This stuff tastes to me every bit as good as a regular cup of coffee but it's WAY less expensive and super convenient. Instead of messing with coffee pots, old coffee that's been sitting for who knows how long and the like, I keep packets of this on hand at home and work and always have a fresh cup of delicious coffee at a moment's notice. It eliminates the waste of partially used pots, too.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this product and I recommend it to everyone!

review/summary: Amazing Coffee, Good Expiration Date, In Retail Packaging
review/text: Hi.<br /><br />I have been using the VIA instant coffee at the office for a while now.  This is my fourth or fifth order from Amazon for it.  The last two orders have been in modern, retail packaging with expiration dates four to six months in the future (which is fine for me).  I find that the expiration dates *do* matter with this coffee, as it tastes fresher (to me) before it is expired than after (I have had both on hand at the same time and have done a side-by-side taste comparison).  Early shipments were in what appeared to be commercial packaging not for display or retail purchase, and the expiration dates were very close (less than one month in some cases).  I promised myself that if the expiration dates did not improve that I would stop purchasing this product.  My past two purchases have been perfect, so I can only assume that the feedback from these reviews, and fixing whatever bugs there were in the pipeline, if any, has fixed the problem of expiration dates.<br /><br />As far as the product goes, it is amazing to me to taste an instant coffee that truly rivals the quality of what i can make at home with focused effort (grinding, measuring, vacuum sealing, filtering, etc.).  At work the water is of variable quality, so I bring my own spring water, use a cuisinart hot pot (on the green tea setting :-), and in a minute I have a quality-controlled, excellent cup of coffee (or a great Yerba Mate in the afternoon).  Life is good :-).

review/summary: Not Real Coffee But Good Enough
review/text: I bring these on backpacking trips. The individual packages are very handy, and the Starbucks instant coffee tastes better than most. If you want a coffee for camping, backpacking, boating, or other outdoor activities, this is a great choice. It definitely does not taste quite like real coffee, but it is good enough. I keep some of these at the office if I want a quick cup. My only complaint is the taste is a little bitter, but if you mix in a little milk it helps calm the bitter flavor.

review/summary: Easy to mistake for fresh brewed, high quality coffee
review/text: I took the Via Taste Test at my local Starbucks. I was served a cup of Via and a cup of fresh brewed. I guessed correctly which was which, but I must say it was by no means obvious and I wasn't sure. This does not resemble any other instant coffee I have ever tasted in any way, shape or form whatsoever. This is the perfect substitute when you cannot brew your coffee, like when you are travelling and your hotel doesn't offer a coffee maker but has a microwave you can zap your water in. In fact, Starbucks Via instant tastes BETTER than the "cheap" fresh brewed brands, and if money isn't tight you may even want to use it when your room does have one of those coffee makers but with the cheap coffee. This is an excellent substitute when I don't have acess to my Keurig brewer and high quality coffee at home. And it takes only a minute to make.

review/summary: Best price I've been able to find
review/text: Starbuck's VIA is a known quantity (well, for me, anyway, and probably for you as well) -- without question the best instant coffee product you'll find.  But it's very difficult to find anyone who'll sell at a significant discount off the roughly $0.85 per cup Starbucks charges in their retail shops.  I like to keep a good supply around, and typically go through on average about a cup a day.  So far this has been the best volume deal I've been able to find, with 50 packet quantities at around $30 or so coming to about $0.60/cup.  Still not cheap compared to run-of-the-mill Nescafe, but if you go through this stuff like I do, it's a good savings over typical retail.<br /><br />I didn't check the expiration dates on the boxes I received, but I've now been through two orders and noticed no quality problems of any kind with the product.  My only beef is that I really wish Amazon would put this product on their subscription plan . . . .

review/summary: Starbucks VIA Ready Brew Coffee
review/text: I love these Starbuck's VIA packets. I'm one of those people who want a cup of coffee right after getting up and sometimes that's a problem when I travel. Even if there is a coffee maker in a motel room, the coffee provided is usually pretty marginal at best. The Starbucks instant packets make a very tasty cup of coffee with minimal fuss. It's the closest thing to well brewed coffee I've found and a far cry from the instant coffee available in stores.<br /><br />I use them for hiking and camping and always stash a few packets in my pack or suitcase just incase. They are an absolute necessity when traveling abroad, particularly in remote areas or in areas where coffee is not available or the alternative is Nescafe.<br /><br />The price is very good.

review/summary: This product changed my life!
review/text: Ok that might be an extreme title, but it is sort of true.  I tried giving up caffeine many times before but never stuck with it, because most decaf coffee tasted like dirty dish water.  Since I am pretty much the only one that drinks (or tries to drink) decaf, I decided instant was more convenient.  Since purchasing Via Decaf Italian Roast, I don't have a need for the regular coffee anymore.  This is deep, rich coffee that tastes like the "real thing".  I am totally over caffeine withdrawal and I never feel deprived of a good solid cup of joe in the AM.

The starbuck via line has such an excellent flavor that you can not tell it is decaf! I also have the regular columbian via I keep on hand when I'm in a rush or when I just want a quick cup of coffee. It is much less hassle than brewing a cup in my coffee pot. If you haven't tried this coffee yet you really should. Its by far the best instant coffee I have ever had!

review/summary: Great tasting instant coffee
review/text: After doing some research, I've decided to try the Starbucks VIA Columbia instant coffee because of it's high reviews. Buying a pack of 50 was too much since I have no idea how it tastes like so I bought a 3 pack sample from my local Starbucks. I've got to say this is definitely one the better tasting instant coffee's I have tried. I haven't tried that many to be sure but with many of the other brands, you can definitely tell that you were drinking cheap instant coffee. Those definitely got the job done but it just wasn't very fun drinking them. With the VIA, the coffee actually tastes fresh and lively. I'm not really a coffee snob and so there's not much bad to say in the taste department.<br /><br />Because I'm the only coffee drinker in the house, it can be a hassle sometimes to grind the beans and use my french press. For those times when I'm feeling especially lazy, I can now count on brewing a cup of this instant coffee. No mess to cleanup and it tastes great as well. What more can you ask for in a instant cup of coffee?!

review/summary: Not much good to say...
review/text: I bought the 12 pack of Italian roast decaf at the nearby Starbucks store, which I love and go to frequently, for those rare occasions when I want a cup of decaf at night but don't want to brew it.  But this product is not SB's best effort.  First, the packaging isn't well designed.  Tearing the top off at the "tear here" line always leaves part of the top intact, making getting the coffee out a chore, and trying to tear off the rest of the sticky top is not worth the effort.  Next, the flavor.  I know Italian is supposed to be bold and bitter, but this stuff takes bitter to a whole new level.  Not good.  Then there's the expiration.  I didn't plan to use this very often, but I'd better, because it expires in less than a month.  What?  Finally, the cost.  At nearly a dollar a cup, this wouldn't be worth it even if it didn't suffer from its other inadequacies.  A definite DO NOT RECOMMEND.
