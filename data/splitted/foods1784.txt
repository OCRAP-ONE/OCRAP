review/summary: Comparable to fresh coffee and easy to make
review/text: Great Folgers taste and aroma, comparable to fresh made. I like the flip top lid, and the more streamlined look.  I don't have a lot of space so the taller container saves some shelf space, plus the "coke" bottle shape makes it easier to carry and pass around.

review/summary: New look to an old product.
review/text: At first, I thought Amazon sent me the wrong product since it didn't look like the picture.  But on the front of each jar were the words "New package, same great taste!"  The new plastic containers are thinner and taller with an hourglass shape to them.  Ultimately, though, it's the same product.<br /><br />Folgers makes good instant coffee.  And, for the last few times I've purchased coffee, it's always been Folgers.  But, this was primarily because my "truly" favorite brand couldn't be found locally (or on Amazon).  That's why I took away one star - which is no reflection on Folgers quality or taste.  My favorite brand?<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007PM9TPS">Chase and Sanborn Instant Coffee, 7.0-Ounce Jar</a><br /><br />Like Folgers, they're one of the old brands that have been around since I was a kid (and I'm 62).  But for me, Chase and Sanborn instant coffee tastes better.  From now on, I'll order that brand even though it's slightly more expensive.  And I'll likely give it a full 5 stars (grin).

review/summary: My Personal Favorite Instant Coffee
review/text: This is my personal favorite instant coffee. To me, it has a fuller flavor than other instant coffee brands I've tried. But, since taste varies widely from person to person, it's subjective to the drinker. I prefer my coffee with creamer and sweetener. If I didn't use creamer, I think that it would be too bitter for my taste as opposed to regular ground/perked coffee. I began using instant coffee for a couple of reasons. First, I would either perk too much, or perk too little. It was just too difficult for me to predict how much or how little coffee I would want during the day. The second reason is, it's quick. We have a hot/cold water dispenser and it's super easy to fix myself a quick cup. The majority of my friends are non-coffee drinkers and prefer tea. So, when I visit them, it's easy to carry along a premeasured amount of instant coffee to enjoy while visiting. I still perk regular coffee every now and then (Folgers), as there is a distinct difference between intant and perked coffee. Strangely, since I have been drinking more instant than perked, I have found that I am slightly favoring the instant over perked. If you have never had instant coffee, or tried Folgers Instant coffee, I imagine you could request a free sample packet from the company first to see if you like it before making a big purchase.<br /><br />This is much better than dirt and water, by a long shot.

review/text: I have to say that I am new to the gluten free diet, so my experience with gluten free cookies is limited, however, I was surprised at the flavor of these cookies (which I added vegan chocolate chips to).

So, I was disappointed.<br /><br />I will try some of the other products that Namaste offers and see if I have better luck!

review/summary: Strange
review/text: I typically prefer to make my own Gluten Free Casein Free cookies from scratch, but sometimes it's nice to have an easy mix already made up. I have not had luck in the past with other brands cookie mixes (Bob's Red Mill, etc.). So I decided to try this one. Ummmm... The smell was the first thing I noticed. Very powerful smell... Which I was guessing was the Sorghum..? Either way, it's not a great smell by any means. Then the dough was unworkable! Too dry and gritty. And I have been baking/ cooking Gluten Free for a few years now so I'm used to the grittiness in products but in my cookies?!? No!! Once baked, they looked like biscuits! The consistency was way off, not to mention the smell. I've learned my lesson, just stop being lazy and make my own from scratch. :)

review/summary: YUCK
review/text: I have tried several delicious gluten-free cookie mixes and this was by far the worst. I knew something was funny about this mix when I was adding the ingredients. The dough smelled exactly like Play-doh. The dough was extremely sticky and wouldn't come off my hands when I tried to mix the dough manually. After baking, the cookies were grainy and had a chemical-y taste. They were stiff and not gooey, like I prefer. I would not recommend this brand - if you are looking for a delicious, soft, GF chocolate chip cookie mix, try King Arthur brand cookie mix and add your own chocolate chips. I will not be buying this brand ever again.

review/summary: Disgusting!
review/text: We have been gluten free for about 4 years now and this is the first I've tried this product (I usually make everything from scratch or use my go-to premade mix: Pamela's).  This is the worst cookie mix I have ever tasted.  When I first bit into the cookie I would have sworn there was a bean flour in the ingredients, but after looking at the list, I don't see bean flour.  I'm not sure what the "taste" was, as the ingredients in the mix are the same ingredients I use in my own recipes, but there was definately something off.  I notice another reviewer called it a "chemical" taste.  Whatever it was, no one will eat the cookies- even though I put a ton of dark chocolate and peppermint chips in them.  Definately not something I would recommend!!!

review/text: I'm not gluten intolerant but all I could find in the store - Whole Foods - were vegan this, gluten-free that and when I weighed up the cost of buying all of the ingredients to make cookies, with my daughter, I figured this would be an ok route to follow.<br /><br />Overall, they're not that bad - I've read some poor reviews on other sites. They are a million miles away from something you could make from scratch though.<br /><br />They do have a slightly odd chemical taste, but it's not dissimilar to cinnamon so it's not off-putting and they are grainy - as if sand was used rather than flour.<br /><br />The instructions say 'add oil', which oil though?<br /><br />Overall, my daughter is proud that she made them and likes them, but next time I'll do it from the raw ingredients as I have no dietary considerations.

review/summary: Very gritty and tastes funny
review/text: I was disappointed. My darling child has been diagnosed gluten intolerant, so I bought her cookie mix. This mix is made from sweet brown rice flour, which makes them VERY gritty -- like they have sand in them. Also, it gives the cookies a weird flavor -- kind of plasticky.<br /><br />My sweet child won't eat them because of the texture, so it's useless to me. I've tried putting cocoa and chocolate chips in them. I've tried putting chocolate chips, butter, and a little molasses (to simulate brown sugar). They always taste funny, and of course, they're sandy.<br /><br />I made her some brownies with Gluten-Free Mama's almond blend flour, and she scarfed them! We froze most, and she's scarfing them from the freezer!!<br /><br />I suppose that, if the texture wasn't as big of a deal to someone, this'd be a pretty good quick treat.

review/text: I like to make these cookies bite-sized -- on the small side.  They are great with dark chocolate chips as chocolate chip cookies.  Also great to roll in sugar/cinnamon to make snickerdoodles.  You can add grated ginger to make ginger cookies.  I often use coconut oil (from Tropical Traditions) instead of olive oil, when I make the cookies and they come out perfectly.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: Namaste mixes really are quite tasty.  The texture is smooth and in general they are as good to me as a gluten eater as those made with wheat.  Having such good quality mixes would help the transition to a G/F diet for those who suffer mildly from gluten sensitivity and also for their families.<br /><br />One thing that is inaccurate in their packaging is the meaning of the word namaste.  According to the Oxford English Dictionary, Draft Revision June 2003, taken literally, it means "I bow to you". The word is derived from Sanskrit (namas): to bow, obeisance, reverential salutation, and (te): "to you".<br /><br />Some Hindus believe that this greeting recognizes the divinity in eachother, while others feel it is only a sign of deep respect.<br /><br />Despite the inaccuracy ("no literal translation"), the name of the food is apropos to its contents.  They are showing respect to those who suffer gluten sensitivity, and are evoking respect for their product through its name.

When I make the cookies I tweak the mix recipe a little. I use 2 large eggs, 2/3 cup apple sauce and 2 Tablespoons of oil instead of what is listed on the bag.  I also add 1/2 cup each of mini chocolate chips, raisins and coconut.  This Christmas I deleted the chocolate chips and coconut and added 1 cup fruit cake mix.  The cookies turned out super!

review/text: This is quite tasty chocolate delivered in a gold foil box. Each piece is nicely decorated so the overall effect is very attractive.<br /><br />Just know that the chocolate is not particularly creamy or buttery.  In other words, you are getting hard liquor rather than a fine wine. To me, a heavy chocolate means a darker flavor with not so much sugar in it.  If you enjoy that, you will love these chocolates.<br /><br />The best way to eat them is to let them warm up.  Then you will get their full flavor.

review/summary: A surprise treat in the middle!
review/text: I tried this cereal first as a dry snack, and that was quite a treat.  Each little nugget of cereal is shaped roughly like a shredded wheat biscuit, only much, much smaller.  When you bit into the nuggest, you find a tiny center of chocolate---like a small, small piece of a chocolate bar!  It's enough so you can taste it separately from the cereal part, and it made this feel like a real snack treat.<br /><br />This morning, I tried them in milk, and that wasn't quite as much of a treat.  Somehow eating them with milk made the chocolate centers not stand out as much, and they just tasted like your standard chocolate cereal, which to me anyway always seems a little overwhelming in the morning.  I like how cereal like Cocoa Puffs makes the milk into chocolate milk, but this cereal didn't seem to have the powdery type chocolate that did that quite as much.  The milk was mildly chocolatey by the end of the blow, but not severely.  They stayed pretty crunchy in milk, and were a good average cereal.<br /><br />So, if you like a little chocolate pick-me-up snack, I think that's what you'd like these for.  I would guess they have a lot less calories dry than most chocolate treats, and they satisfy!  A pretty cool idea for a cereal.

They did a great job advertising it because I bought it, but I won't again unless I decide to try the original version. The cereal has an awful texture and loses a lot of flavor in milk. It seems to be instantly soft and soggy.<br /><br />I was prepared to give it one star and then I saw some reviews that suggested to try it dry. I did and it has a good taste and texture dry which earned it another star.<br /><br />Honestly I can't see why this made it to stores. There should have been improvements made before this was released, could have been great and ended up below average.

review/summary: This much sugar isn't for every day
review/text: Unless the purpose of this cereal is that it be a vehicle for milk, I'm confused as to why anyone would choose this over a healthier, less sugary breakfast food.  The first ingredient is chocolate filling, and the filling's first ingredient is sugar.  Then the next ingredient is sugar.  You get the idea.<br />By making the "serving size" 3/4 cup, a "serving" of this cereal is only 120 calories, but clearly most bowls would hold twice that, at least, and most of them are from the sugar--there is almost no protein in this cereal.  The impressive array of vitamins and minerals could be obtained from a less-sweet enriched cereal or a one-a-day vitamin pill.

Unfortunately I was wrong. We tried it first without milk and it wasn't too bad. But for some reason when you add the milk the flavor almost seems to change a bit and the sogginess doesn't do it any favors. While it's a decent little snack and would be, I'm sure, great for younger children, our family will not be purchasing it again.

review/summary: Good taste, not crispy enough
review/text: I liked the flavor of this cereal, but somehow the outside is just not crispy enough.<br />The chocolate had a decent taste, with minor off-notes.<br /><br />Unless there is a storage problem at Amazon's warehouse, the cereal should have been fresh, so the not crispy enough cereal is probably just how it was made, and not a shipping/storage flaw.<br /><br />Conclusion, if it is on sale and I have a coupon I would buy it again

review/summary: Doesn't Live up to Its Name
review/text: To put it bluntly, neither my children nor I craved Kellogg's new cereal "Krave." What can we say?<br /><br />It's crispy and it's chocolatey. If that's what you're looking for in a breakfast cereal, you won't be disappointed. Think of it as Cocoa Puffs on steroids. This cereal is for chocolate lovers.<br /><br />The photograph on the box makes it appear as if there's a chocolate fudge oozing out of the center of each bite of cereal. The reality is a bit different from the image. Each bite does have a fudge-like center, but it doesn't ooze out of the cereal, and there's not nearly as much as the image shows.<br /><br />The cereal was a bit rich for our family. Honestly, it's more like a dessert than it is a breakfast cereal. It's hard to imagine anyone eating this first thing in the morning.

review/summary: Chocolate OD?
review/text: I like chocolate, but this is really over the top.  I imagine there are people out there that would say "What a way to go!" if I suggested that they might over-dose by eating Krave, but I truly believe that most people would not find this product to be an enjoyable experience.  It claims to be a double chocolate cereal, but I would say it is more like quadruple.  After pouring milk on this "cereal" it turns into a pasty mush. The most irritating aspect of eating Krave is that it sticks to your teeth like glue.  And, finally and perhaps more importantly, isn't "cereal" supposed to be at least somewhat nutritious? Krave, in my opinion, is a disaster as a breakfast cereal product.  How about nuking it for 45 seconds and using it as an ice cream topping?  That would be my suggestion for an alternate use of this product. It is really better suited to a desert.

review/summary: Not very tasty
review/text: I love chocolate in all forms, including good chocolate cereal.  So I had high hopes for this cereal.  Unfortunately, it just was not that tasty to me.  It has a slight artificial taste, especially after the first few bites.  The artificial taste faded a bit as I continued to eat, but I still felt that for a chocolate cereal, it just didn't taste that chocolatey.  There are much better chocolate cereals out there.  This cereal seems to be trying to be a healthier chocolate cereal which is an admirable goal, but personally if I am going to eat a healthy cereal I would just rather have Cheerios.  No artificial taste there!<br /><br />Overall, I found this just to be an OK cereal, nothing special.

review/summary: Can't Believe My Kids Said This...
review/text: My kids, who survive on pretty much any food you would find at a circus or carnival(eg. Cotton Candy, soda, ice cream, etc.) say this cereal is way too sweet.  I have been mixing a little of this in with the new Pbutter Cheerios and telling them it is a reeses peanut butter cup cereal, and they seem to like that OK.<br /><br />This cereal is so chocolatey and so sweet that it is probably a better ice cream topping than cereal.  I still have more than half a box and will probably end up dumping it if my new idea that I just thought of doesn't work.  I'm going to try making rice krispy squares out of it.  Maybe a snack for their school lunches.

review/summary: Not impressed
review/text: I love chocolate, especially chocolate cereal, and was very excited to try this new product. I really like keeping chocolate cereal on hand to snack on when I want something sweet; it saves calories compared to eating a whole chocolate bar (as long as you don't overdo the serving size!).<br /><br />As a cereal, as the product was intended to be consumed, it wasn't very chocolatey. It reminded me more of the amount of sweetness you'd get from dark chocolate rather than something as sweet as Cocoa Puffs or other chocolate cereals. For some people, this might be appealing; however, for people with an intense sweet tooth, this might not satisfy you. I didn't really have the problem of it getting soggy like other reviewers mentioned, but I eat fast, so maybe I just never let it sit long enough to get to that point.<br /><br />As a snack, I was even less satisfied. I could taste the dry cocoa powder more than I could taste chocolate flavor. It definitely is best as a cereal (again, I realize that's what it was intended for, but so many cereals are great snacks too) because the milk takes away some of that powder-y texture and flavor.<br /><br />I give it 2 stars because it wasn't horrible, but it's not something I would buy again or recommend to others.

review/summary: Fans of chocolate cereals will enjoy
review/text: Though I've never been a fan of chocolaty cereals, I am a definite chocolate lover. Let's face it, chocolate cereal just never compares to a true gourmet chocolate. I get my chocolate cravings satiated with Carbury or Godiva, not Kellogg's. But if you are a fan of chocolaty cereals then you will probably enjoy Kellogg's Krave.<br /><br />The flavor is very much the same as those other chocolate flavored cereals out there, though the chocolate goo in the middle of this cereal does add a little more richness, that's about it. My kids have loved snacking on this cereal and I agree with other reviewers in that it might make a better snack than cereal since it can get pretty mushy after just a minute or two.<br /><br />All things considered, this probably isn't a cereal I'll buy regularly, but I'd probably pick it up when there is a good sale or something as it makes a fun treat for my kids.

review/summary: Yummy Cereal
review/text: I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this cereal. It has a nice chocolate taste as you bite into the small cereal biscuits. There is a creamy center which is where most of the taste comes from. Because of this, the milk in the cereal does not turn brown unlike other chocolate cereals. The cereal has reasonable fat content which surprised me since the taste is so rich and yummy. My kids loved this cereal very much!

review/summary: 5-Stars for Chocoholics...2-Stars for those who may not be
review/text: First off, when I ordered this through the amazon Vine program, I was convinced I'd be getting 4 separate 11 oz boxes--but Vine participants only received a single box, which is fine. One box is enough to know whether or not you like a cereal, but I have to admit that as I ordered it, I thought I'd be getting more. My bad for not paying enough attention, I guess.<br /><br />Onto the cereal: This box is for the serious chocolate lovers out there--of which I am not. Now don't get me wrong, I like chocolate as much as the next guy, but holy cow, this is almost chocolate overload. I CAN tell you that my children LOVED it and so did my wife--so take that for what its worth.<br /><br />For me, I found the texture of the cereal once mixed with milk was a bit on the odd side--and I can't explain why, wish I could. Nothing about the cereal was bad or unpleasant at all, I just didn't particularly enjoy how explosive the chocolate flavor was. Now, with that said, if you happen to be a BIG fan of chocolate flavoring, you may want to pursue a box or two because I don't believe I've ever had a cereal quite as loaded with that MUCH flavor before...so, if you happen to be one of those chocoholics out there, this could very much be the bowl of cereal for you.

review/summary: I Will be Sticking with my Chocolate Frosted Mini Wheats
review/text: The write up for Krave double Chocolate cereal sounded so good, I just had to give it a try.  Crispy multi grain outside, smooth chocolate inside, good source of fiber (3 grams) and low sodium--what's not to like?  A lot.  Let's start with the deceptive advertising on the front of the box.  There is nothing smooth and chocolatey inside the cereal.  My daughter and I ate these without milk, and there was absolutely NOTHING in the center of the cereal but air.  The photo on the front of the box is completely photo shopped.  If by chance we came across one or two pieces with anything in the center, it was gritty and crumbly, but definitely not smooth.  As for the taste, it has a very fake chocolate taste and the cereal itself dissolves in your mouth with one bite, leaving a gummy paste on your teeth.  The cereal literally stuck to my teeth--which is something I have never experienced with any other cereal.  While I commend Kellogg's for making a cereal (that should appeal to kids) with added fiber, whole grain wheat flour, and whole grain oat flour, there is not much to like about the taste of the cereal.  This will be my first and last box.  If you are craving chocolate in your cereal, and looking for a little nutritional value to boot, I would stick with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004X8T8DK">Kellogg's Frosted Mini-Wheats Little Bites Chocolate Cereal, 15.8-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>.  These do not turn to instant mush in milk and taste extremely good.

review/summary: Should have been named "Brownie Delight"!
review/text: I think the biggest mistakes Kellogs made with this cereal was marketing it as a cereal and the name.  I swear, dry, this cereal tastes just like brownies with chocolate chips in them.  There is that overall chocolate flavor and when you bite into it you get a rush of real chocolate.  It is absolutely delicious.  I loved it and then gave some to both of my kids.  My son isn't even a big sweets eater and he gobbled it up.  I also tried it in milk assuming the chocolate insides would create a thick, creamy, chocolate milk.  Nope.  The cereal more or less just floated in the milk and lost some of its bang when I ate it.  While it was far from bad in the milk, it was much better dry.  I think Kellogs would have done much better marketing this as a snack food and calling it something other than Krave which tells you nothing about the cereal.  In my opinion, "Brownie Delight" would have been a much better name because my first thought when I put it in my mouth was, "This tastes just like a delicious brownie!"  Then, it took all my self control not to eat the whole box!

review/summary: Okay if you don't mind the sugar
review/text: My entire family tried this cereal. The 12-year-old liked it very much, but the 9-year-old (who's a picky eater) wasn't as fond of it. The adults felt it was fairly good--for a sugary cereal.<br /><br />The sugar is, of course, the problem. The package claims that the cereal is high in fiber, but given the amount of sugar, that's not enough to make it a really healthy choice. I think it might be better as an after school snack or dessert than as a breakfast.<br /><br />It has the strongest chocolate taste of any cereal I've tried. The texture is good, too. Even in milk, the outside stays fairly crunchy and the inside is soft. It does have some of that chcolate cereal aftertaste, however.

review/text: Cereals haven't really been very exciting since somebody figured out that you can sell more to kids if you coat the grains with sugar. However, Krave is actually a fresh idea in a supermarket aisle dominated by the health-conscious and the sugary extremes. The cereal has a whole grain exterior with a chocolate inside. The exterior is soft to the bite while the chocolate taste is subtle - definitely noticeable, but toned down from those sugary excesses. It's neither too unhealthy nor tastelessly healthy - just the right combination. Definitely worth checking out if you're looking for something besides Cheerios or Cocoa Puffs.

review/text: This is really good cereal.  It is chocolate crunchy biscuit-pouches with smooth chocolate on the inside.  Chocolate on the outside and the inside makes it double chocolate.  The crunch is fantastic.  The smooth center is dececent.  It is just wonderful.  It goes well with milk.<br /><br />The outside is multi-grain, made with whole grain.  If you love chocolate and crunchy cereal, then this might be for you.  The kids love it.  And it is made by a very familiar and trusted brand, Kellogg's.  I know I can always trust Kelloggs for quality, taste, and value, as I have been buying Kelloggs cereal and cereal bars for many years.<br /><br />I am happy to find out about this new cereal.  I will be buying it again, and I will also buy the other variety.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you like chocolate, crunchy, good cereal by a highly trusted and respected brand.

review/text: I was intrigued by this product because I love cereal in general as well as chocolate, and the idea of a fairly healthy alternative to, say, a candy bar to get that chocolate fix seemed like a great idea.  The problem is this cereal tastes terrible.  It was almost like eating cardboard that had been lightly sprinkled with cocoa powder.  And it left a bad taste in my mouth after I was done with it.<br /><br />I see other reviewers here enjoyed the taste, so I guess it's all just a matter of personal preference, but for me I would never eat this again.  A word of warning if you do try this cereal: it is best eaten dry as it goes soggy very quickly in milk.

The flavor in the first bite is rather good, but the flavor doesn't last.  The texture is also a problem. Even in the first bite the cereal was turning mushy and it had only been in the milk for about 15 seconds.  The calorie content is higher than other better tasting cereals.  I asked my 14 year old son to try it. He is the reason I buy several boxes of cereal each month. He liked he flavor, but admitted that it was too mushy in milk.  If you are looking for a good chocolate cereal that isn't full of sugar there are better ones to chose.

review/summary: Palm Oil and Too Sweet - a Bad Combination
review/text: Being a chocolate addict, I salivated when I saw the words "Double chocolate" on the box. I added milk and eagerly took my first bite. It was so sweet that my teeth actually began to hurt! Now I have eaten all types of chocolate, from Oreos to Godiva to Lindt. And it wasn't even sweet in a good, rich, chocolate-y way, it was over-the-top sweet in a chemical-tester way, as if someone had invented a way to pack a cup of sugar into a bite-sized piece of cereal.<br /><br />For some reason, the milk amplifies the sweetness. The cereal tasted less strong when eaten dry, more like shredded wheat with a touch of chocolate flavoring. It's the milk that melts the creme center and makes it ridiculously sweet.<br /><br />Lastly, the box lists palm oil as an ingredient, which is one of the worst things for your body.<br /><br />Sorry Kelloggs, you struck out with this one.

review/summary: Tasty but waaaay overpriced
review/text: Reminder - 3 stars means "it's okay".  That being said, the most important question is how does it taste?  It definitely tastes like chocolate, that's for sure.  Each piece is a lightweight crunchy pillow much like Captain Crunch, filled with a tiny drop of chocolaty syrup. The pieces are very lighweight, mostly air, so a bowl of this cereal isn't very filling.<br /><br />Each box of cereal is only 11 ounces, one of the smallest boxes of cereal I've ever seen, and that combined with not being very filling means each box is only good for a few servings.<br /><br />But wait! All that would be okay except each box (when ordered from Amazon in a 4-pack) costs $5.00!!  There is no way this cereal is worth five bucks a box.  The front of the box is actually embossed, adding I'm sure to the price of the product.<br /><br />Cereal prices in supermarkets are too high, most people would agree, but for $5.00 one would generally get a box of cereal at least twice as big. I only buy cereal when it's on sale so I rarely pay more than $2 or $3 a box for brand names and often can get store brand for $1.50 a box.<br /><br />Krave tastes okay, better than Cocoa Puffs, isn't all that special, but not bad either. In this instance my 3-star review is based mostly on that, but the high price easily lost them a star.

review/summary: Kraven Khocolate
review/text: Kellogg's new "Double Chocolate Krave" is like eaten candybar cornflakes. The choco-flavor is almost overpowering, like soaking a bitter-chocolate bar in milk. I found that a small bowl of Krave is all you'll need because of the forcefulness of the taste. I'll have to admit that I find Chocolate Cheerios to be less overwhelming, and contains slightly less sugar (9 grams per serving vs DC Krave's 10 grams). The texture is nice, reminding me of my old Captain Crunch as a kid.<br /><br />The nutritional info is not as healthy as it could be. With 160 Calories per recommended-sized serving with milk, you can do better. DC Krave is fairly low in sodium and scores nicely for fiber amounts. Overall, Double Chocolate Krave is satisfying, but I wouldn't rush back for more.

review/summary: No kravings here...
review/text: When I first saw Krave cereal in the market, it seemed almost decadent (especially the double chocolate variety I chose). I realize many breakfast cereals are only a tiny step above candy, but Krave seemed to be going beyond the pale with their marketing campaign. Even the name makes it seem like some kind of wake-up dose of heroin.<br /><br />Sadly, the product is a different story. Lacking in consistency, a remarkable flavor, and in anything that would make me want another bowl, this cereal is over-hyped to say the least. The big draw, the core of chocolaty goodness, is barely noticeable. The exterior is far too flaky to last more than a few seconds in milk, and there is surprisingly little taste. I'm being totally honest here - I had to couple them with spoon sized shredded wheat to make a decent bowl of cereal.<br /><br />I'm a lifelong cereal junkie and now that I'm soundly middle aged, I have to fight my inner demons while shopping to avoid the gigantic bag of crunchberries or super sugar crack and buy something less sugary. Getting a free box of sweetened cereal seemed like some kind of reward! And yet, even if it's given away, Krave is not worth it.

A healthy chocolate snack...although sugar is kind of high.<br />I also love the 1 dollar coupon on the back of the box....with sales and the coupon, I can get two boxes for 3 dollars!<br /><br />Now, while i love this cereal, there is one cereal I love even more. That is Kellogg mini wheat little bites chocolate...best chocolate cereal hands down.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004X8T8DK">Kellogg's Frosted Mini-Wheats Little Bites Chocolate Cereal, 15.8-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>1

review/summary: Mm yummm
review/text: I don't eat cereal often so I have no problem when it's full of chocolate and tastes like dessert. I do however see why people would want to eat this one every day, it's sweet and chocolaty and makes for a great midnight snack with or without milk. I wish it stayed crispier once you add the milk but I guess it would take more processes and chemicals to change the texture and might change the taste as well. After trying the sweet candy like flavor of chocolate I'm tempted to get the fruit one.<br /><br />This is definitely something I would buy in the store if I saw it, once in a while it's fun to have a little sweet treat even for breakfast.

review/summary: REALLY tasty, and not too bad in the nutritional department
review/text: At three carb points per serving, this is a surprisingly decent cereal. It is a kids dream come true - chocolate cereal filled with chocolate. But best of all, it makes milk very chocolatey, very quickly. If there is a downside, it is that this cereal gets too soggy too soon, so eat up as soon as you pour your milk. If you want something REALLY good, mix them with Cheerios Peanut Butter or Dulce de Leche for the ultimate caramel/chocolate or peanut butter/chocolate morning breakfast.

review/summary: Not as sweet as I expected, but still really good!
review/text: The good thing about Krave cereal is that it does taste like chocolate. The chocolate doesn't taste forced or artificial. The texture of the cereal reminds me a little of Chex Mix and it seems like some -- not all -- pieces have an extra burst of chocolate.<br /><br />Now the bad thing about this cereal is that it isn't as sweet as I expected it to be. While it does taste like legit chocolate, it doesn't taste like chocolate overload. If you're like me and expect a cereal with fudge, this isn't it.<br /><br />While I did enjoy this cereal and it is pretty tasty, I don't find myself "krave"-ing it.

review/summary: Addicting!
review/text: When I recieved a free box of this cereal to try, I was excited. I had seen this inthe store but hadn't brought any yet. I tried the double chocolate and just ate some without any milk. Instantly, I was addicted to this cereal. My husband enjoyed it as well. I finished the box with out ever having any milk with it. That is because it didn't last long enough to go into a bowl with milk. This cereal is something to eat when you have a craving for something sweet. You can eat it any time of the day or night. I will be purchasing myself more of this cereal and trying the plain chocolate. Guaranteed, I am going to get the double chocolate.<br /><br />Now, I know why the cereal is called "Krave". It is the perfect word to describe this cereal.

review/summary: This is the Type of Cereal Willy Wonka Would Make in His Chocolate Factory!
review/text: All of America is kraving chocolate and Kellogg's, General Mills and other manufacturers of cereal are capitalizing on it.  Personally, I love chocolate; it is one of my four basic food groups: Fruits, Vegetables, Alcohol and Chocolate.  My favorite chocolate cereal WAS Kellogg's Cocoa Puffs [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5E6E">Cocoa Puffs, 11.8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>] [occasionally, I also eat Cocoa Krispies(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E6EEE2">Cocoa Krispies Cereal, 16.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a>)].  Now, it is definitely Kellogg's Krave Double Chocolate Cereal.  See the photographs that I have posted on Amazon's website.<br /><br />  Krave Double Chocolate has a rich, chocolate taste that is not too sweet.  It has a chocolate, wheat exterior that is crunchy and a creamy chocolate pudding-like filling.  I gobble it up before it has a chance to get soggy in whatever I pour on it, usually skim milk.  It tastes especially delicious in vanilla soy milk and vanilla almond milk.  I mixed some leftover Cocoa Puffs with my Krave Double Chocolate and it was great.  I love eating the cereal and drinking the chocolate milk that remains in the bowl.  I'm nearly fifty years old and chocolate cereal always makes me feel like a kid again.  I also enjoyed mixing the Krave Double Chocolate with the Krave Chocolate, which has a plain, wheat exterior with a creamy, chocolate pudding-like filling.<br /><br />  My elderly parents are coming to visit me in a few weeks and I plan to buy more boxes of the Krave Chocolate and Krave Double Chocolate cereals; not only do they taste great, but they are also healthier than other cereals.  Because I suffer from Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), I was glad to read that these cereals are high in fiber.  There are three grams of fiber per serving.  Every morning I eat one serving of cereal and two servings of Dannon Activia Yogurt.  Thanks to this delicious, high fiber breakfast, I am able to control my IBS without having to resort to medications that have undesirable side effects.<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos

review/summary: A new favorite
review/text: I wasn't sure I'd like any cereal that claimed to be "double chocolate", but I had a chocolate craving when I ordered it so I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />I can understand why it's called "Krave" because after I tried one of the little chocolate pillows, I was hooked.  I was kind enough to share with my family, to see if it was equally appealing to children and teens (including an exchange student from The Netherlands who bought a box to take home to his brother since he claims they have "no good cereal" there :)<br /><br />It is very chocolaty....the cereal comes in little pillow shapes with a light crunchy shell (kind of like Crispex) and a somewhat softer middle that is also chocolate (sort of reminds me of the filling in chocolate poptarts).  It's great to eat dry, as a snack or in a bowl of milk.<br /><br />As far as the nutritional part goes, it's not too bad.  A serving size is 3/4 of a cup and is 120 calories with 3.5 grams of fat.  It is 10grams of sugar, but that's almost 1/2 the amount of sugar you'd find in Smart Start or raisin bran crunch, so it's not too bad and tastes oh-so-good.  It does contain wheat, soy and milk so keep that in mind if you're the allergic type.<br /><br />This is one of those cereals that will be a "treat" in our house but also one that I'll keep a box hidden somewhere for myself in case of an emergent chocolate craving.

review/text: I'm on a diet and so I am pretty limited on sweets.  This is one "sweet" that fits in with my diet and is so great!  3/4 of a cup is 120 calories and it satisfies my chocolate cravings.<br /><br />I eat it like a snack food rather than a cereal.  I have already gone out and purchased another two boxes because I went through my first one so quickly.<br /><br />The outside is "dry" crunchy chocolate cereal and the center has a creamier texture.  The center isn't really crammed that full, but it's just enough to give you a hint of chocolate smoothness.  My kids also love this cereal but I try not to let them eat too much because I want to save it for myself since it is my one chocolate indulgence!  It is a little on the spendy side as far as cereal goes, generally in our house we buy the generic store brands - unless absolutely necessary.  In this case we are making an exception.<br /><br />If they made it any more indulgent I think the calorie count would be too much!  I would urge everyone to give this cereal a try if you're looking for something chocolaty!

review/text: I won't rate this on nutrition because we all know, whether we admit it or not, that chocolate breakfast cereal is not healthy.<br /><br />However, my 11YO gave this a 5 star review. Small, chocolate pillows have a creamy center, although I tried one and didn't notice any cream in the center. If you break them open - it's a very thin layer. 11YO swears it tastes like Cocoa PUffs.<br /><br />While it's not the healthiest breakfast you'll ever eat - it does have a lot of whole grains and it's fortified with vitamins. There's only 10 grams of sugar in a 3/4 cup serving and no trans fat.<br /><br />Not the worst way to start your day.

review/text: Kellogg's Krave cereal is not bad; it's just not great either.  The pieces are pretty big, so for people with small mouths, like myself, this is a downside.  I expected the texture to be hard, like Captain Crunch, but the cereal was surprisingly soft, even without soaking it a little in milk.  It was also not as chocolatey as I thought it would be and tasted more like bitter dark chocolate, rather than rich, milk chocolate.  The cereal is not bad, and I plan on finishing my box, but I would not get it again.  I would rather buy Cocoa Puffs because it has smaller pieces and tastes better.

review/text: I love chocolate cereal. What's better than having a nice bowl of chocolate milk left when you're done, right?<br /><br />This cereal sure sounded good, but it fails to deliver on many counts. Firstly, the flavor is totally one dimensional and way over the top. So rich and sweet that I couldn't make it through a small bowl without quitting halfway. The crunchy shell has an odd texture to it as well. Like wet grainy cardboard. Instantly turns into a mushy mess when it comes into contact with milk.<br /><br />Not the worst thing ever, but I won't be coming back for seconds.

review/text: Please don't purchase this cereal if you expect there to be chocolate filling inside. The picture on the box and on advertising are 100% misleading. I initially thought that my batch was defective because the insides were only filled with air. Finally I realized that there was indeed an incredibly small, barely noticeable dollop of chocolate inside. I guess the taste isn't that bad overall, but just don't expect any chocolate filling to be inside (or at least not a significant amount).

You might find a milk chocolate easter bunny, but you'll also find a "chocolate flavored" easter bunny. These will look the same, but not taste the same. This cereal is like the "chocolate flavored" easter bunny.<br /><br />My kids liked it, but for something called "krave" that pushes the chocolate angle on the marketing, I was left wanting.

review/summary: Decent cereal, but not a home run
review/text: I consider myself a bit of a cereal connoisseur - I have over a dozen boxes of cereal in my cupboard as I like eating different cereal every weekday morning (I have something different on weekends) so you can imagine that I'm a big fan of the stuff. There are four main dimensions that I think cereal should be judged on: nutritional value, taste, ability to satiate your appetite, and staying power.<br /><br />Nutritionally, this cereal is comparable to most other mainstream GM/Kellogg cereals. Similar balance of vitamins, not too high in fat, sugary but not moreso than any other cereal, low in protein. If you're looking for something high in nutrition, look to Puffins or Kashi or Bob's Red Mill or something.<br /><br />Taste-wise, it's pretty good but not as good as I was expecting. I was hoping for something like that Trader Joe's cereal that was whole grain squares enveloping hazelnut chocolate - while it used hazelnut chocolate instead it was a perfect balance of sweetness. This Krave cereal, as you can imagine, is a bit on the sweet side. I have a sweet tooth and even I felt it was rather sweet, but not as sweet as cereals with marshmellows in them. Close, but not quite that much - so to me, it's not too overpowering, but not something I can have every day because of how sweet it is. The chocolatey flavor is much more like chocolate than cereals like Cocoa Puffs or Cocoa Pebbles (or most other chocolate laden cereals), but it does leave a bit of a sandy taste in your mouth and can collect on your teeth if you don't gargle afterward.<br /><br />When it comes to satiation, this cereal scores pretty low. Usually I have two cereals in the morning: a bowl of something good for me and half a bowl of something tasty but not as nutritional. When I compared Krave to some other cereals (Wheaties Fuel, Puffins chocolate puffs, Honey Bunches of Oats, the Kashi cinnamon bunches cereal), I felt hungry pretty soon afterwards. I expect cereal to hold me over for at least 2 hours, but this cereal did not do that.<br /><br />Staying power wise, I have to admit that this cereal performs well. Staying power means that I've noticed that often times you can get tired of a cereal pretty quickly and not want to eat it again. At some point, this happens with all cereals you eat too much of, but I've been eating this stuff at a normal pace for over a month now and I still keep coming back to it. It's not good enough that I want it all the time, but once a week I do kind of crave it a bit so the cereal name appears apt.<br /><br />With my highly unscientific method, I'll give it 3 stars since, as a whole, I think it's fairly mediocre but still a respectable cereal to take home with you.

review/text: Krave Double Chocolate Cereal is all right.  I love chocolate, so I thought I'd give this cereal a try.  I found it tastes artificial, but still enough like chocolate for me to enjoy.  I like eating cereal dry, so I didn't get the effect of the milk turning into chocolate milk (although, I think this is a great idea for those that enjoy milk).  I liked the texture too, which was like other bran cereals.<br /><br />My biggest complaint, which is particular to me, is that this cereal contains corn bran.  Corn is one of my migraine triggers, so I was disappointed that I couldn't eat too much of this cereal.

review/text: Ok, the title may be a little over the top, but it came from my son who loves everything chocolate and decided that this was the best he ever had.<br /><br />I tried it as well and liked it as a treat. It is very chocolate-y, but not overpowering and surprisingly not too sweet. I especially liked it as a dry snack (sans milk). Probably a little better for me than most candy bars, I would guess.<br /><br />Would I buy it all the time for myself? No, but as a treat for a time it is quite delicious. We have already bought more and in a different flavor (regular ... turns out Double Chocolate is far better). Would I buy it for my kids? Absolutely. They like it and it is decently nutritious.

review/summary: Kids love them
review/text: My kids are crazy about this cereal.  Tastes great in milk!  One thing I noticed is that it's pretty delicate and breaks rather easily.  It must've been bounced around quite a bit in shipping.  If we bought it at the store, maybe it wouldn't be so crushed up at the bottom.  Otherwise a winner with the kids.  Will purchase again in the future.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: This cereal is delicious! It is full of chocolatey taste and pairs wonderfully with milk. It is very satisfying! The reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the texture. When you bite it you can feel the whole grain pieces (I hope you understand what I mean by that) but it doesn't take away from the wonderful taste. I love that this cereal has 11 vitamins and minerals in it. It is delicious and not terrible for you. I saw the photos that another reviewer posted of mixing the cereal with cocoa puff and I can't wait to try this myself!

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I kept seeing these in the grocery store and was intrigued ever since. the best description I can make is that Krave cereal is Cocoa Puffs and Captain Crunch's love child. You get that delicious cocoa flavor, along with that chew that melts in your mouth thanks to the captain crunch. As a bonus, a little bit of chocolate stuffed inside begins to melt in your mouth shortly after.<br /><br />Not friendly for your waist line, that's for sure. These treats are full of sugary, chocolates goodness and are quite difficult to stop eating once you begin. If you don't care about how much you may potentially binge on, or if youre searching for a new sugary cereal with no nutritious value, then this is the cereal for you.

review/text: Krave really lives up to it's name - this cereal is full of chocolate flavor and is fulfilling as a cereal or snack!  The small squares are crunchy on the outside and filled with a creamy dark chocolate on the inside so eating every bite gives you a satisfying chocolate flavor.  It is also not too sweet - it is just right for a chocolate craving snack.  and because it is a fortified cereal, you are also getting decent nutritional value in something that is tasty and sweet.  I love the flavor of this cereal and will definitely buy it again!

review/summary: We like mixed with Pretzels as a snack. YUM!
review/text: First off, this did not go over well with our family as a cereal but DID win them over as a Snack mix.  I don't know what the kids were expecting but they didn't like it in milk.  The cereal is no worse than their fave, Bite Sized Chocolate Mini-wheats, so I'm not going to get all self-righteous about the added sugar and all the chocoalte here.  I will say it was a little odd to feel the squish of soft chocolate in your mouth when mixed with the milk.  Rather than toss something that tasted good out, we switched modes and mixed this with rice chex, mini pretzels, unsalted almonds, sunflower seeds and then the KRAVE.  It became a family Snack Fave almost immeditaely.<br /><br />I wish we had a few boxes to try this with so we used coupons and sales to buy some locally and try it again as a SNack with different mixed in non-sugary items.  It seems that no matter what we mixed this with, the Krave was just the right amount of chocolate (loads!) to balance out unsweetened cereals in snack mixes along with some healthy nuts for protein and unsaturated fats.  The key, for us, is portioning. Our family would eat this handful after handful as a mixed snack if we let them so we have to pre-portion it out in reusable tubs with lids.  it goes in lunch boxes and comes out in place of Microwave pocorn when watching a movie.<br /><br />I'd like to see Krave branck out the way that Chex cereals has and offer this in healthy snack bags or better yet, post some snack recipes on their website.  We'll buy it!  The chocolate is creamy and not heard, kinda like Lindt choclate centers while the shell is crunchy like a cereal ought to be.  If you don't mind that in your bowl with milk; you'll love Krave.<br /><br />UPDATE 4/27/12:  When we have seen this on sale and with coupons, we have bought it several times to add to one of the types of Snack Mix we make up by the gallons and store in the old 5 gallon Popcorn tins we've gotten as gifts at Xmas from family.  We put the mix in indivdial, re-usable serving baggies where possible so the kids can just grab one and we know exactly how many calories they've gotten and from what.  The Krave may be a sugary cereal but that melty chocolate middle makes it a good addition to whole grain, unsweetened ingredients such as rolled oats, roasted nuts, Soy nuts and other unsalted crunchies.  it's really all about balance.

review/summary: Tests reveal three health tips
review/text: *****<br /><br />I like Cocoa Puffs.  I like Count Chocula.  But I love Krave!!!*<br /><br />I doubt Kellogg's Krave Double Chocolate Cereal, 11-Ounce (Pack of 4) is as healthful as the same mass of a mess o' greens with tofu and an apple, but when you realize you crave Krave you don't care about that.  You dump some into a bowl and add milk and a spoon and go at it.  Or if you want, you use chocolate milk instead of white and then you drizzle on some chocolate syrup and add a dollop of chocolate mousse right in the center, and then you dust the whole thing with cocoa powder.  Or at least I do.<br /><br />Which leads me to Health Tip #1.  Instead of a spoon, use a knife.  Your total intake will be the same, but it will take a LOT longer and your hand and arm will get a lot more exercise.  Not only that, you will eventually greatly improve your hand-eye coordination trying to balance a Krave biscuit on your knife, or you will starve.  Also, sometimes two are stuck together and that makes it easier to get them on a knife.<br /><br />Or you reach into the bag and remove a handful and eat them dry.<br /><br />And here's Health Tip #2.  Instead of a handful, remove and munch only one biscuit at a time.  Scientific research has shown that eating these biscuits individually reduces calorie intake by up to 95%.  It's important to understand that the phrase "up to 95%" includes such popular percentages as 50%, 2%, and even 0%; all I'm really guaranteeing here, according to scientific research, is that the reduction will be NO GREATER THAN 95%.<br /><br />Also, according to scientific research conducted by me yesterday, when you fire a .22 caliber rifle round at a box of Kellogg's Krave cereal from ten yards away, the cereal inside is pretty much, basically, for all intents and purposes, completely the same.<br /><br />The same is not true if you then go ahead and detonate a standard stick of dynamite nestled gently down into a box of this particular cereal, the result of which is utter annihilation to the point where after the dust has literally settled you simply cannot reliably identify even a single molecule of what you know for sure to be Krave.  I'm not saying competing breakfast cereal products would fare much better in this test, I'm just saying I know this to be true for sure about Krave.<br /><br />I also know that following this test and your explanation of the reasons therefor to your flabbergasted neighbors, they will agree that such a test probably needn't have been run in the first place, that the outcome was obvious, and that you have to pay for many, many broken windows.<br /><br />Also, here's Health Tip #3.  When you detonate a standard stick of dynamite, you should wear hearing protection, which reminds me, if you decide to leave a Comment on this review for me, please type loud.<br /><br />Krave is just what it says it is.  Cruntchy on the outside and a tiny bit gooey on the intside, and really chocolatey.  Five stars.<br /><br />*If you know me at all you know those three exclamation points in the first sentence were a joke.<br /><br />*****

review/summary: Krave: Healthier than you think
review/text: Kelloggs Krave kinda surprised me, as it reminds me of the sweet and sugary type cereals I grew up with in the 80's. I suppose that fond memory also sparked my interest in this product. Taste is still important, but now that I'm older, nutrition is important too.<br /><br />Taste: The taste of crave is mostly what I assumed it would be, with a chocolate shell and creamy chocolate center. The shell was  less crunchy than I expected and more crispy, but not a big deal. What surprises me most about the taste of Krave is that it's very different with and without milk. Without Milk, Krave almost taste like chocolate dog food. With Milk, it was much better and tasted like Oreo cookies. Overall I rate the taste 3.75 out of 5<br /><br />Nutrition:<br />Krave actually surprised me in the nutrition element as well. I compared it to my regular cereal: Sunbelt Berry Basic, which is a bran cereal with dehydrated berries. Krave actually has less than half the fat, half the carbs, and more vitamin A, B6, C, D, Iron, and Zinc per serving than my regular cereal. Unlike the sugar cereal that I had in the 80's, this one is allot better for you. I rate the nutrition a 4 out of 5.<br /><br />Overall, if you have children or you enjoy sweet cereal, I would give this one the thumbs up. It's not the best chocolate flavored cereal that I have ever had, but it may be the healthiest.

review/text: If you're a chocolate lover, this is the cereal for you. I liked it best as a treat right out of the box without milk, but it's pretty good with milk too. But the cereal does get rather soggy rather quickly once it is in milk. That's the only down side to this product that I could find. It's like eating a home made mini brownie with the edges crunchy and the center soft.  Fantastic chocolate flavor!

review/text: I had actually heard raving of this cereal before trying it so I was anxious to try it. I liked the fact that it was sweet but not overly so, however I think it could have been more chocolatey considering that it was advertised as double chocolate. Being a chocolate lover, I expected to be completely indulged in it, but overal it was good for a quick breakfast meal.

review/summary: Extra Yummy!
review/text: I have been staring at this on the shelf for a while but hesitant to purchase it. We have a record in this house of buying cereal that is a 'must have' only for it to sit on a shelf when the kids didn't care for it. (I'm looking at you Marshmallow Fruity Pebbles).<br /><br />When we were offered the chance to sample the Krave double chocolate cereal, I jumped at it. Everyone in my house liked it! My 5 and 8 year olds just loved every bite and requested it for breakfast until it was gone. Even my husband who isn't a fan of cereal liked it.<br /><br />The inside is smooth and chocolatey and the outside in crunchy. Not as crunchy as mini-wheats, but close. The size of each bite was about a mini-wheat little bites size. They did that magic that turned milk into chocolate milk when done with the cereal in the bowl. Kids thought that was super.<br /><br />I am looking forward to now trying the other flavors, especially the regular with chocolate filling.

Just enough crisp with a chocolaty center to satisfy a sweet tooth after a meal without having a full dessert.<br /><br />At this time it's being sold here for 4 boxes for $20.... I saw it in a grocery store for less than $3 a box.

review/summary: Like chocolate cake batter in your breakfast bowl
review/text: ...and how you feel about that is how you'll feel about this cereal.  Me, and my kids, well, we loved it.  So much so that we devoured the box in a matter of days.  And there's one of the only real problems with Krave - the box is ridiculously small.  But aside from that, when it comes to sugar-laden cereal, this is among the kings.  Once it's drowned in milk, the flavor comes alive and truly tastes very close to chocolate cake batter.  It can be a bit overwhelming if, say, like me, you fill up a bowl with a bit too much cereal.  My kids, who had previously been addicted to Chocolate Mini Wheats, now can't get enough of this stuff.  I feel like we've traded off a little healthiness here with this one, as it's lower in fiber, etc. than the Chocolate Mini Wheats, but like most kids, they more than make up for it with plenty of healthy snacks elsewhere.  Going back to those Mini Wheats is pretty difficult after this incredibly indulgent breakfast snack - for that's what it truly feels like, a snack.

review/summary: Do you love chocolate?
review/text: I'm a cereal lover with a wide range of tastes in cereal. I usually enjoy the healthier varieties like Raisin Bran or Frosted Mini Wheats but I also enjoy the sweeter kinds like Capn' Crunch and Lucky Charms. The Kellogg's Krave double chocolate is probably as chocolatey as you would expect it to be with that name. If you like chocolate and you like cereal, this is probably a good match for you. I found it to be have more chocolate flavor than Counth Chocula and with a better texture. The only negative for me was that they seemed to get soggy pretty quickly but for some people that's actually a plus.

review/summary: A mixed bag at our house!
review/text: I did not like this cereal as much as I expected. It had a rather strong flavor and was fairly sweet. My daughter loved this cereal and asked for more when we saw it in the store. It did stay fairly crispy in milk (a plus) and kids who like chocolate (maybe that is all kids LOL) will enjoy it. I relegate it to a weekend cereal. On school days there wasn't anything in this one that said "healthy" breakfast to me. As a weekend breakfast it's fine. We both think, as a snack, it's almost better than as a cereal and it is highly likely we'll eat it that way in the future.

review/summary: The nutrients of multi-grain, the sweetness of chocolate!
review/text: The Kellogg's Krave Double Chocolate Cereal is a great day starter for those of you who are regulars when it comes to cereal. It tastes great and my kids and niece liked it very much. It is packed with different vitamins and minerals and only packs a 120 cals per serving. Although nutritious it may seem, this would not be a regular cereal choice for me because of the dizzying sugar content. It may not matter to the kids but I have to start them off early eating the right kinds of food and acquiring the proper types of nutrition. They are however very fun to eat and the kid's reaction could attest to that fact. But I would strongly suggest to make this an "occasional" cereal treat, never make it a regular. This should have been better if the sugar contents were less of what it should have but let's be clear about one thing....chocolate and any kind for that matter wouldn't be chocolate if it did not have sugar, and lots of it. 4 stars is the best I can give.

review/summary: great with milk, but eat it fast!
review/text: When I was a kid, we had two kinds of cereal in the cupboard: breakfast cereal and snack cereal. THIS definitely tastes like snack cereal (think Chocolate Cookie Crisp) but it's not that bad for you.<br /><br />When we tried it dry, it was a little...fibery. Like cereal you don't like to eat but you know it's good for you--only with a chocolate center. Then we poured on the milk (I know this is the traditional way to eat cereal, but not if it's a snack). And the taste really comes alive! All the fiberiness goes away.<br /><br />Unfortunately it goes away fast. It becomes mush if you don't eat it quickly. 3/4 of a cup is a bit small for a serving size (tricky buggers!) so it has a few more calories than 120 if you eat a regular bowl.<br /><br />Despite that, this is a good cereal and I think we will buy it again in future. I hope it stays around. We'd like to try the other flavour. (It does make a great snack, try it!)

review/summary: Almost like eating chocolate for breakfast
review/text: Kellogg's Krave cereal has a definite chocolate taste. It's almost like eating a crispy covered truffle. It's no See's or Godiva, but the chocolate center has the flavor and texture of ganache. The outer layer is like a chocolate wafer. The aftertaste is very slightly bitter, not sugary as if you eating real chocolate candies.<br /><br />This cereal makes a tasty snack dry, but it also stays crispy in milk to the point you would expect cereal to do. My kids like chocolate and view this cereal as a special treat. I'm not sold on eating something so chocolaty for breakfast, but Krave is a cereal I'll eat later in the day.<br /><br />I assumed from the flavor that this was a fairly sugary and not too nutritious cereal, but I was largely wrong. While chocolate flavored filling and sugar are the first two ingredients, it does have 3 grams of fiber, 2 of protein, and the fat and sodium content aren't too high. I definitely feel better about serving this to my family than the sugary, colorful cereals marketed toward kids. It's not a bad choice for cereals, and may be just the thing to help chocoholics get off to a good start in the morning.

review/text: First of all, I am a huge fan of chocolates so when I saw this cereal, I had to try it. My husband describes this as if eating a slice of chocolate cake but to me, it had the chocolate taste to it but it was very artificial tasting and not as good as other chocolate cereals I've had. The milk makes it so it's all soggy and no crunch and it only takes a few seconds for it to turn soggy. The way around it was to eat it dry and then take a quick chug of milk. That helped it a little bit but it's still not one that I would be buying on a regular basis.<br /><br />Compared to some of the other chocolate cereals on the market, such as cocoa pebbles, cocoa puffs, etc., this is probably at the low end of the totem for me.

review/text: Definitely for those who like chocolate.  If you're not a huge fan of chocolate, you will probably want to give this product a pass.  It tastes good enough but is nothing special.  It actually tastes better after being in milk for a minute or so, better soggy than crunchy.  You'll most likely be eating more than the 3/4s cup that's listed on the side, so take that information with a grain of salt.  Double it and that's probably your breakfast, some 300+ calories but you'll be getting a good amount of nutrients with it.

review/summary: To crave or not to crave Krave
review/text: Let's see, I'm craving something, and does Kellogg's Krave rank high on that give-me-something-to-buffer-that-sweet-tooth list?  The REAL question is: Does the real product inside the slickly designed box, which probably pads the cereal's price, live up to the imaginatively decorated, hyped-up box that screams "buy me" on the grocery shelf?<br /><br />Yes and no.<br /><br />Yes ... the soft, sweet center is the centerpiece of the crunchy morsels. No ... overall, the product didn't taste as decadent as chocolate, but, after all, this is supposed to be a cereal, not a dessert.  However, the taste can definitely pass as a dessert - with or without milk.  For the health conscious, rest assured that the cereal is fortified with a good dose of vitamins and minerals and somewhat easy on the sugar and artificial ingredients. Billed as "healthy whole grain fiber" that is the greatest drawback about Krave when it comes to tantalizing the taste buds.  Fiber is fiber - dried straw to the tooth.  You can drown the fiber in chocolate flavor, but, yep, you got it, it's still dried straw to the tooth.  Also annoying are the grains that stick to the teeth.<br /><br />In the final analysis, however, Krave was the first cereal to disappear in our kitchen on our grocery-esque cupboard of variety.  That says it all.  When it came to our household eating cravings, Krave was all the rave.<br /><br />Stacy Lytwyn, Journalist/Teacher/Motivational Speaker<br />Author: CONSUMMATE CONNECTICUT: DAY TRIPS WITH PANACHE

review/text: Overview: A decent, low calorie, chocolate-y snack<br /><br />Survey Participants and Methodology: Krave Double Chocolate cereal was tested on six adults between the ages of 32 to 65. A seventh adult, aged 22, pledged allegiance to Cocoa Puffs and refused to participate. Only one participant (me) was willing to try Krave with skim milk at breakfast. The other five sampled the cereal dry, straight out of the box or took handfuls from a communal serving bowl. A canine participant ate whatever fell to the floor.<br /><br />Results: Opinions were split according to sex and to a lesser degree, age demographics. Females were more positive about the chocolate flavor and the airy but crunchy texture. Males were fairly united in their overall opinion of "meh" but could not otherwise precisely express themselves. One male continued to eat large handfuls of Krave even after stating a preference for Cocoa Puffs which was remembered as being sweeter and had more of a milk chocolate flavor than did Krave.<br /><br />All of the female participants studied the nutritional values on the cereal box and all allowed that at 120 calories for � cup this would be an acceptable chocolate-y snack. The males had no interest whatsoever in the cereal's nutritional value.<br /><br />The one participant who tried Krave with skim milk at breakfast felt that the cereal became soggy too quickly and was not enthusiastic about a sweet. chocolate flavored cereal first thing in the morning.<br /><br />Nutritional Value:<br />Krave Double Chocolate contains milk, soy, and wheat ingredients.<br />Per � cup (30g) serving:<br />-120 calories, of which 30 are from fat<br />-3.5g total fat of which 1g is saturated<br />-95mg sodium<br />-23g total carbohydrates of which 3g is dietary fiber and 10g is sugar<br />-2g protein<br /><br />In comparison, a slightly smaller serving (27g) of Cocoa Puffs contains:<br />-108 calories of which 12 are from fat<br />-1g total fat of which 0 is saturated<br />-144mg sodium<br />-23g carbohydrates of which 1g is dietary fiber and 13g is from sugar<br />- 1 g protein.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Krave Double Chocolate contains 3x the fat, but 2x the protein, 3x the fiber and about 40% less sodium than Cocoa Puffs.<br /><br />Krave Double Chocolate has a more robust deep chocolate taste that is also less sweet than Cocoa Puffs.

review/summary: Isn't crunchy enough, but pretty tasty
review/text: Krave sort of look like long Captain Crunch, but they're considerably softer and less dense than Captain Crunch.  If you don't eat them right away, they just turn into a bowl of chocolaty mush.  An unfortunate effect of this mushiness is that this cereal will stick to your teeth quite a bit.  The Double Chocolate definitely has chocolate flavor to it and it's not TOO sweet, but I don't think anyone will mistake this for a healthy cereal.  Kellog's Krave Double Chocolate cereal seems more like a snack or dessert than a breakfast cereal.  It probably won't make it into my regular cereal rotation.
