review/summary: Good flavor and nice bottle
review/text: I'm really happy with this Sparkling Ice water. The orange mango has a nice flavor, light carbonation, and it's not as sweet as Vitamin Water. Per bottle, you get 20% of your daily B-vitamins, Vitamin D, and Biotin. There's also green tea extract that adds a little antioxidant.<br /><br />I like the bottle, too. It's 17 oz, but it's a longer, thinner bottle than Gatorade or Vitamin Water. So, for my small hands, it's easier to hold. That might be a silly thing to share in my review. But I think ergonomics do matter!<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good product. And the shipping from Amazon was very fast. I'm looking forward to trying the other Ice flavors.

review/text: I found this product in OH when I was there visiting family. Zero cal, naturally flavored and sparkling! Loved it. Came home to MA and its no where near me. So I ordered it on Amazon! I got enough to get free shipping. It took quite a while to get to me, but I'm down to only having 2 left and I'm saving them :)

review/text: Since I joined Weight Watchers I have been trying to find better ways to get my "hydration" because I simply do NOT like plain water.  A coworker introduced me to Ice in many flavors. I am a Mango FREAK so I usually go fo the Mango. They carry it at Publix but it's regularly $1.30 plus tax so getting it on subscription via Amazon is a DEAL!!! I love this stuff.........

review/text: So far the Orange Mango is my favorite flavor but I haven't tried them all yet.  Pink Grapefruit is good, too.  With no calories and no carbs it has now replaced my diet coke as an everyday beverage.<br />I have no problems with the tall 17 oz bottle. Makes it easier to fit more in the fridge or ice chest.

There are several flavors of this product, with Orange Mango being one of my favorites.  I was disappointed to have it discontinued from my "Subscribe and Save" selections.

review/text: I like this one so much I have it on subscription.  It's the first flavor I tried and the one that I liked on the first swallow.  It tastes very natural. My second favorite is the Lemon Lime, but the Black Raspberry and Coconut Pineapple are not bad. I will try the other flavors because the Sparkling Ice drinks are a nice change from non-carbonated flavored water. Since I don't drink sodas this is a nice treat. No calories is a major plus.

review/summary: perfect soda addiction breaker
review/text: I found this at a deli one day and a friend and I immediately fell in love. This successfully helped me get off soda, which I only really like for the carbonation. I didn't want to drink club soda because, well, that just tastes bad, and I was not going to invest in a soda stream.<br /> The ICE drinks are perfect! They're carbonated but just enough so that if it happens to get warm before you can finish the bottle, it doesn't burn your throat, unlike soda. The added bonus is the green tea, a great little mid day kick.<br /><br />My only complaint is that they use sucrose. I wish I could get more stuff sweetened with stevia.

review/text: This stuff is 'finestkind'! The slightly tart flavors of tangerine and mango were positively inescapable, whilst the carbonation was quite crisp. The added Splenda provided just the right touch of sweetness, without crossing the line. I think a touch of key lime would put this drink over the top, but I recommend it highly, as is.

review/summary: Good Drink! Light and Refreshing!
review/text: I discovered the Sparkling Ice beverages about month or so ago. They're quite good and come with a variety of characteristics I like. They're zero calories which is good for my weight watching. They are ever so slightly carbonated but nowhere near the typical carbonated soda. They're only slightly sweet. I tend to like the much lower sweetness Even no sweetness might be better. The taste is mild but excellent and I like the Orange Mango better than the other two flavors I've tried (lemon-lime and raspberry). The bottle is 17 ounces so you can go it alone or easily split it for two. I bought it at a local store but things have a way of appearing and then disappearing, so it's good to know it's available on line. Good product! Light and refreshing!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: Sparkling ice drinks are so good and a guilt free treat!  I love all of the flavors i have tried. I have never been able to find the coconut pineapple so haven't tried it.  I particularly like anything with mango flavor.<br />There are only a few stores in my area that stock this and half the time, they are out of it. For a comparable price, I just order them from Amazon .  Be careful with the black raspberry and open it over the sink.  For some reason, this flavor in particular seems to be high pressure and I have had it squirt all over the place when opening even though it had not been shaken or moved prior.  I am assuming  it is because it is  a lovely shade of red on tan carpet.

Only complaint would be the Splenda (trying to avoid that as well), but until I can get straight down to water, this is the next best thing.

review/text: Introduced to Leonidas several years ago, on successive trips to Brussels I returned with the two other, more well-known brands (Godiva and Neuhaus), when I couldn't get to Leonidas before my plane left. My wife advised me that in the future it was Leonidas or nothing.<br /><br />They are machine-made so the price is not bad (as opposed to the hand-made varieties), but they are also made fresh without preservatives so they need to be eaten or refrigerated quickly. In this house, the refrigerator rarely sees the package.<br /><br />They are excellent and a treat you owe yourself.

review/text: We have lived in Belgium for 8 of the last 24 months.  There is no question that the cheapest Belgian chocolate is better than anything you can buy in America.  It is tough for us to gag down American chocolate anymore.  They grind the cocoa beans finer and use less fat and less sugar, so it is much better for you. I am diabetic and it does not send my sugars up.<br /><br />Belgians have very strong opinions when it comes to which chocolate is "best".  They don't always agree, but more Belgians said Leonida's was the best than any other single brand we heard.  This is not something you eat. You savor and treasure every piece.  The price is good and you will not be disappointed.

review/text: I had an excellent shopping experience with Leonidas. From my experience, I can assure you that if you ever have any problem, Leonidas will be courteous and considerate in dealing with you. As for the chocolate, my husband and I are very fond of dark chocolate and have tried many brands before. We found Leonidas ideally bittersweet in its taste and also generous in quantity. In fact, the best of all the European brands we've tried in our five years of dating. It's the kind of chocolate that you not only would buy for gifts but would also want to buy and keep for your snack.

review/summary: Dark and Delicious
review/text: If it is possible to fall madly in love with a box of chocolates, then the assortment is the perfect place to start such an adventure. These chocolate are named after Leonidas Kestekidis, who definitely knew how to create chocolates for the true chocolate connoisseur.<br /><br />When he moved back to Belgium he not only married his true love, he created chocolates the world now adores. When you taste these chocolates, your taste buds will also finally know true chocolate happiness. Whether you try one of these with a cup of coffee or tea or enjoy one as a daily indulgence, these will impress.<br /><br />If being "in love" gives you a zest for life, then the "I Love You" chocolate with dreamy lemon filling embodies this sentiment. Each chocolate has a unique design and the I Love You chocolate has two hearts, ribbons and a seal. After you sample the variety of chocolates, specific flavors will stand out as favorites.<br /><br />Here are my favorite creamy fillings (ganache and butter cream) which come in dark, white and milk chocolate depending on the selection (dark if you order this box):<br /><br />Antoinette - A smooth Brandy flavored ganache<br /><br />Lingoit Lait - Absolutely delicious vanilla flavored fresh butter cream filling. Time definitely stopped while tasting this chocolate.<br /><br />Irr&eacute;sistible - Dark chocolate and Strawberry sauce.<br /><br />For ever - If you love coffee this may be one of the most delicious milk or dark chocolate chocolates ever made as it is filled with a special coffee cream that has hints of caramel. I ordered an entire box of these and they come in a variety of flavors. The milk chocolate and cherry filling is like Claude Debussy's R�verie. It is difficult to describe besides saying it is like a delicate cherry icing wrapped in milk chocolate.<br /><br />Merveilleux - Milk or dark chocolate filled with coffee ganache.<br /><br />Europe - Dark or milk chocolate filled with rum filling.<br /><br />Ganache - Milk or dark chocolate with pure ganache.<br /><br />Tosca - Milk chocolate with a special ganache.<br /><br />Po&eacute;sie - Dark chocolate and a Cointreau filling.<br /><br />Antoinette - Delicate caramel hints in the milk chocolate coating mingle nicely with the vanilla filling.<br /><br />Eve - Milk or dark chocolate with a creamy dreamy banana filling.<br /><br />Alexandre le grand - A milk or dark chocolate with caramel cream.<br /><br />Also Recommended:<br /><br />If you wish to also try the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. You may also want to look for the new Palet d'Or. A deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache. The center is made with butter, cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations.<br /><br />Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior.<br /><br />My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature/seasonal wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

Her birthday was coming right up, and I found out from another friend that she loved dark chocolate.  Amazon.com shipped the item very quickly.  I had been contemplating sending the item with expedited service, but ended up assuming my friend wouldn't care one way or the other if the item arrived on time for her birthday.  In fact, the item showed up just two days later, ON TIME for her birthday, when I had just paid for standard delivery.  My friend immediately sent me a very excited e-mail thanking me for the present, and said that she loved it.  Thanks, amazon!

review/text: This year we ordered these dark chocolates and also bought a package of dark chocolates from Godiva. The Godiva dark chocolate box is $36 for 10.5 oz. (really, it's on their website). These are the same price for a full pound. And they come from Belgium, where people are very fussy about chocolates, and proud of their chocolates. It is not just the price. The taste difference is amazing. These are the real thing, a pleasure from first to last. We lived in France, where chocolate shops abound, and Leonidas was quite competitive against the artisan shops.

review/text: I give these chocolates to others for special occasions as gifts. They have never let me down. When you say Belgium, I say Leonidas. Dark chocolate can be an aquired taste, to know what is good. This dark chocolate is superb! In bars you can tell the crisp fresh break of quailty dark chocolate and the aroma and the taste. These creams just blend their ingredients with the dark chocolate to create an exquisite taste. Bottom line, They don't skimp on the ingredients and as long as they don't, I will continue to buy their products. The packaging is great because it comes gift wrapped already. I would like to see how its made and the people who make it.<br />Cheaper than a ticket to Belgium and always delivered fresh!

review/summary: Average chocolate, strong fillings
review/text: These are definitely "mid-range" chocolates, not quite as good as Godiva or See's. If you're used to low-end chocolates like Fannie May or Russell Stover, you'll probably find these to be very good. However, if you're used to very good chocolates like La Maison du Chocolat, you'll be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />I found the chocolate to have unexceptional flavor and a somewhat waxy texture. The fillings were mostly very sweet or alcoholic, which is a common practice to cover up mediocre chocolate.<br /><br />I guess they're a good value compared to Godiva, although I think See's Candies has an even better value. Don't expect Leonidas to compare to a high-end chocolatier.

review/summary: A very fine mustard with a cheesy twist
review/text: I am a big fan of Stonewall products and this one is one of my favorites. They start with a very mild herb flavored Dijon, which is great on it's on, but when small chunks of real blue cheese are added it takes it to a whole new level.<br /><br />On of the first things that I put in on was a Kobe beef hamburger along with crisp dill pickle slices and bit of freshly snipped tarragon. Wow! I would be willing to pay $15 for a burger this good at a restaurant. The next thing that I put in on was a natural casing Polish sausage and it was wonderful. I have now used in on lamb chops, roasted chicken, sliced tomatoes and more. I tried making my own but for some reason it just wasn't as good. Once the jar is opened it lasts for months in the fridge. This has become a staple in my kitchen.

I wondered if the 27-cup version might be the right choice, but decided I really didn't need the capacity, extra height and expense.  This is a very simple piece of work, and it seems a bit (quite a bit!) overpriced.  However, after a lot of shopping around, I couldn't beat Amazon's deal with Prime.  For sure, there is NO CHANCE that I will ever wear this thing out.  I'm very satisfied with the build quality, durable finish and functionality of this K-cup carousel.

review/text: I love K-cups but don't have a lot of space on my kitchen counters to display them. This item allows me to have several out for me to choose from for my next cup of coffee and the rest are stored in the cupboard. It is made of good quality material, the cups fit well and the carousel spins without difficulty. Love it!

review/text: For my kitchen set-up, this is just the right size to hold 18 K-cups.  It's nice low profile and compact width do not take up a lot of space, yet you can still spin the carousel and see the top of all the cups to easily make your K-cup choice.  It is nice and solid and looks good in black with the black K-cup unit!

Talk about a let down! (see submitted pic) There was no warning that they would be delivered and take an additional 3 days to bloom........ seriously!! Not a good impression at all.

They looked nothing like the picture, infact, they looked like they had been sitting a grocery store for two weeks with no water.  From now on - I order local delivery.  Proflower customer service is less than desirable.  Not only did the individual not speak English very well, he was rude and laughed in my face.  I am not ordering from them again.

review/text: I have never had good luck with Pro Flowers.  Flowers/plants came in boxes, knocked around, bashed, wilted.  Tried 2 or 3 times, for awhile(10-15 yrs ago) they were THE big online floral service.  Not anymore, and certainly not for me.<br /><br />Update:5/17/11<br /><br /> Mother's Day Special 2011:  All day long Neal Boortz was pushing the $19.95 Mothers Day Special: "A Dozen Roses, click on the microphone at website, type in Neal (Boortz)  get free vase!"  Well, I did all that, and clicked submit, but right before it submitted I noticed my total was over $63!  I immediately went back to the website and cancelled.  I saw the $10 shipping fee, bringing the total to $29, approx, but failed to see the fine print: $10 Extra charge for Saturday shipping, $16 extra charge for a pink vase instead of clear, and whatever extra shipping/handling fees they added bringing the total to  almost $64.  I apologize hugely for missing all that fine print, but will NEVER use Pro Flowers for anything, advise you look elsewhere for florist needs.  Words of wisdom: find a florist in you hometown that you like, use them for everything, even out of town stuff.  If they treat you right at home, chances are they will treat you right for out-of-town orders.

review/text: With all the various Mothers/Stepmothers/In-laws, etc that I had to buy for on Mother's Day, I decided to order flowers through amazon, for ease.  It was a convenient way to send flowers to multiple recipients - and I just hoped that the flowers would look okay.  In fact I was thrilled that EVERYONE who received these tulips raved about them.  All recipients stated that the flowers were expertly packed, very fresh, beautiful, and lasted a long time.  I will use pro-flowers (via amazon) for all future flower purchases.

review/summary: A solid, stately flower that needs a little attention . . . at a great price
review/text: Tulips are clever.  You can arrange them just so in a vase and find out next day that half of them are sprawling over the lip of the vase, possibly even getting entangled.  They're not fatigued -- they just have a tendency to follow the light.  Tulips are not only heliotropic (following the sun's arc when possible) but phototrophic (they keep growing under almost any kind of available light).<br /><br />When I received my most recent bouquet of 30 tulips from ProFlowers on May 17, 2012, I followed Amazon's instructions and clipped a small amount from each stem (diagonally under running water is a good idea) and let them soak up cold water for eight hours in the plastic collar designed to keep them bunched tightly.  Then I retrimmed them and put them in a vase with floral preserver.  Had I wanted to keep them standing straight up I would have kept the bottom string tied and used a smaller vase (see below).<br /><br />There are also plenty of vids and information sites on the web about these slightly tricky but very rewarding blooms.  Click on the ProFlowers homepage under "Flower Care" for verbal instructions.  This time, through LOTS of online shopping I was able to get the 30 tulips plus the pictured trumpetlike "amethyst" vase* (which really is purple, despite the photographic process showing blue) and a small box of chocolates (only eight pieces, but they were delicious) at just under forty dollars plus S&H direct from ProFlowers.  (*You will probably just get a clear glass vase.)<br /><br />I am basically satisfied but cannot give this bouquet five full stars because:<br /><br />.  In this particular case the tulips consisted of eight red-and-yellow tulips (which I later learned are called "Flair"), with most of the rest white or pale pink.  This is fine, but the Flairs were running about a day or two ahead of the rest, bloom-wise.  There should have been better synchronization (tulips are not as long-lived as, say, ProFlowers' own roses or Peruvian Lilies).  I have appended a photo of how they looked on the second day.<br /><br />.  Despite my every Internet order saying "Carrier: Please Ring Bell!"  FedEx left these at the door at 9:35 a.m. without ringing.  We were home.  How hard is it to press a button?  IMO this is the source of a lot of one-star ratings of ProFlowers deliveries -- the product being left for too long in extreme heat or cold -- and ProFlowers should really address this issue.<br /><br />If you want an economical bouquet that needs lots of water initially but opens up slowly and lasts a long time (I have a two-week-old bouquet on my bookcase as I write this and it it just now time to 'pull the plug'), try ProFlowers' Peruvian Lilies.

review/summary: Didn't turn out to be much of a surprise.
review/text: I come from a different country and wanted to send a surprise gift for my Mom for her 75th birthday.  She's been living with my sister in California for almost two years now and I thought I should send her something special and extravagant.  I got these multi-colored tulips in a vase because they earned fabulous, five-star recommendations in the website.  However, what happened was, the courier wasn't able to find my sister's house, waited 24 hours before they contacted my sister, and this time, TO ASK HER TO PICK UP THE FLOWERS from the courier's office.  Anyhow, when my sister drove to the courier's office to get the tulips, they weren't as fresh as their worth -- quite wilted, and didn't even have water picks (those small plastic water containers at the bottom of stems) which could've helped prolong the freshness of the flowers.  This gift cost me a day of my salary.  I hope that next time, not another mother gets this kind of gift that my 75-year-old Mom didn't deserve.
