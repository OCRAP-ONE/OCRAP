review/summary: Great Taste!
review/text: This is the first cold coffee drink (without crushed ice, like a Frappuccino at Starbucks) I have ever had.  I do enjoy coffee, but during the Summer I often turn to soft drinks instead (I usually do not want a hot drink when it is 100 degrees outside).  I was not sure what to expect from this, but was surprised that it was quite delicious and refreshing!  Being a Cappuccino, it has low fat milk (which is nice, since most places just use whole milk), and a hint of cocoa (not too much where you cannot taste the coffee, but there is a hint that makes it perfect)!  Because of the low fat milk and cocoa this beverage has 100 calories, 1.5g of Fat (1g Sat Fat), 19g of Carbs, and 18g of Sugar (from label).  That is not too bad considering what some coffee beverages have.  The coffee is very strong and has a great taste, it is not bitter and drinks very smoothly.<br /><br />When I got this item, I placed it in the fridge and it was in there fore a few days (so it was nice and cold), and it was very refreshing and smooth, the coffee was the primary taste in the drink, and the milk and cocoa were secondary, so you got a nice taste of what tasted like high quality coffee with a smooth finish from the milk and cocoa.  I am very pleased with this drink and found it quite refreshing and a nice change from a standard cup of coffee (especially during these hot days), and with only 100 calories it is a great start to the day!  Highly recommend!!!

review/summary: Loved It!
review/text: This is a very mild coffee drink, made with milk and sugar.  It definitely has the taste of espresso, but it is not overpowering.  I typically take my coffee with milk, so this flavor appealed to me.  However, if you like your coffee strong and black, you will probably think this tastes awful.<br /><br />I was a little concerned about the added sugar, as I don't put any in my coffee and I dislike sugary drinks.  This beverage was not overly-sweet.<br /><br />One thing I will suggest is you make sure the drink is icy-cold before you try it.  I tried it when it was barely chilled, and thought it was so-so, but after sampling it very cold, it was delicious.

review/summary: Very watery, if it wasn't watered down flavor would be ok.
review/text: I'm not a coffee drinker so I had my wife try one of these and she said immediately it tasted watered down and was VERY watery. So much so she wound up pouring it down the drain. She occasionally will drink the starbucks types of coffee drinks and this particular brand/variety was no good to her. If you like watered down, weak flavor this might be your thing, for her it was no winner.

review/summary: Chocolately
review/text: I gently shook my taste can before trying this (although the can says not to), knowing that coffee drinks can settle.  I had it chilled overnight to try after breakfast.  It's not bad, but where is the coffee flavor?  My first taste was definitely chocolate.  My second sip revealed some graininess.  I taste no annoying additives, or anything overly bitter or even too sweet.  The coffee was like a tasty afterthought.<br /><br />And I like this taste combination.  But for the price that is charged for this, I can think of another major coffee company that sells these in small glass bottles for quite a bit less.<br /><br />This drink's ingredients are:  coffee, lowfat milk, sugar, cocoa powder, potassium bicarbonate, citrate, cellolose gel, potassium citrate, cellulose gum, carrageenan.<br /><br />There are 81mg of caffeine in one can serving and 100 calories per can.Each can has 5mg cholesterol, 60mg sodium, 19g total carbs, and 4g protein.<br /><br />This product is made in Denmark and distributed by the Coca-Cola Company.<br /><br />My biggest gripe is the price!

review/text: I was expecting this to taste like a store-bought frappaccino,sweet and creamy but with that "factory produced", in-genuine edge to it. I was surprised that it tastes more like something you'd pick up from a coffee house though! The actual coffee bean flavor stands out in a more robust manner than a typical canned coffee/capp/frapp drink.

review/summary: Some like it hot, some like it -- well, sweet
review/text: This coffee drink was good. Not as sweet as the bottled Starbucks, which I enjoyed, but sweeter than the Caffe style of this brand. My sister only drinks coffee with lots of sweet, and she didn't find this one quite sweet enough for her... but then it was still a bit too sweet for me, so there you go. There's a happy medium somewhere.<br /><br />These cans are 8.45 fl oz, with 81 mg of caffeine (so a lot less than the Caffe). The can contains 100 calories, 5mg cholest, 60mg sodium, 19g total carb (sugars 19g), 4g protein. Contains coffee, lowfat milk, sugar, cocoa powder, potassium bicarbonate, cellulose gel, potassium citrate, cellulose gum, and carrageenan. (Ok, that was all Greek to me.)<br /><br />I received my sample can in April, the best-by date is August '12. I enjoyed the drink cold.<br /><br />I found the coffee flavor to be very nice, I've been to Denmark and had coffee, it's nice to have some back in the States with me :) (that's cheaper).<br /><br />A convenient coffee-on-the-go package.

review/summary: Decent coffee taste, but too much sugar.
review/text: This illy canned cappuccino is made with 100% Arabica beans, lowfat milk, sugar, cocoa, and a few chemicals. It contains 100 calories, 18 grams of sugar, and 81 mg of caffeine.  Despite being pretty low in calories for a sweet drink, the taste of the drink is much too sweet.  Clearly they are targeting the drinkers of the very sweet Starbucks bottled drinks (though the Starbucks bottles have much higher calories).  I liked the coffee flavoring, but it's certainly not as good as a freshly brewed cold cappuccino.<br /><br />I would try one can before committing to an entire case.

review/summary: Didn't care for the taste
review/text: As an Amazon Vine member, I received One 8.45 ounce can of illy issimo Cappuccino Coffee Drink. When it arrived it was afternoon, and I was ready to have a coffee. So I popped it open and took a drink. I was surprised .. the coffee tasted watery and thin. It had a slightly chalky feel to it - hard to describe, but it left a very slight coating on my tongue for a very brief time. It had a pleasantly sweet taste, but the coffee flavor just wasn't strong enough - too thin.<br /><br />It's decent nutritionally, each 8.45 ounce can is 100 calories, 1.8 g fat/15 cal, 1 gram of that is saturated fat. It has 18 grams of sugars - but is sweetened with beet sugars - so it's not high fructose corn syrup, 1 gram of fiber and 5 grams of protein. I have to look at sugar/fat/protein ratios when choosing foods, and 5 grams of protein in a coffee is pretty amazing! The fat is very low, esp when compared to coffee house Cappuccino's. It's Kosher, so no problems for kosher coffee drinkers.<br /><br />All in all, I was really disappointed in the Cappuccino. I like coffee, and wanted to like my sample, but I didn't. Unfortunately, this is something I wouldn't buy or recommend.

The dominant flavors I got were Sweet, Chocolate and milk. I did not really get much of a flavor of coffee.<br /><br />This product is not worth even trying. Save your money.

review/summary: Might be better in Italy, preferably by the Mediterranean...
review/text: Alright, so this is supposed to be exceedingly authentic. But for someone who's just a little bit of a coffee snob (you know, just endearingly, not enought to cross over into jerk territory), I was struck by how low-quality the ingredients taste. It's a very simple mix, with milk, coffee, sugar and whatever additives keep the stuff from going bad, but the coffee flavor immediately strikes me as being poor, even cheap. Perhaps this stuff flies in Europe, I don't know, but I was pretty disappointed. Just about everything else from Italy gets a much better score in my book.

review/summary: Interesting comparison to Asian canned coffees...
review/text: After moving from Asia and having lived in the USA for over 20 years now, I realized that it's not really a normal habit for people in the US to drink canned coffee. It is only recently I started to find some canned coffee-related goods (i.e. coffee "drinks") on the shelves in the mainstream supermarkets. Normally, real canned coffee come from Asian markets.<br /><br />When I saw this being offered on vine, it piqued my curiosity. How would it compare to Asian coffee? I had thought that perhaps an Asian company was trying to make its market in the states through the Internet, but I was wrong.<br /><br />Upon close inspection, I realized that it's made in Denmark but the Coca Cola company. Huh, Coke? Interesting.<br /><br />Amazon shipped the can in a bubbled mailing bag, those yellow kind. Pretty standard. However, the can did come with many dents. I don't know if it was already there before they sent it to me, or perhaps the mailing process caused those. I'm just the can was not broken when it got to me.<br /><br />It says "do not shake" on top of the can - very different from all the "shake well" notices in the Asian beverages. This leads me to wonder - perhaps it's not made with powdered coffee like most Asian beverages.<br /><br />I also see "sugar" in the ingredients instead of some artificial sweetener. To me, that is a plus.<br /><br />I'm used to drinking pretty sweet coffee in a can, and this was not so sweet. Yes, it's sweet, but it's not too bad, compared to the Asian coffee in a can I had grown used to. It is, however, not for anyone who is looking for black coffee. The can does say "cappuccino." It's somewhat bitter, a little bit acidic. I know some other reviewers said it's metallic in the taste, but I don't taste that much - perhaps I've been jaded by the Asian canned coffees?<br /><br />Overall, I give it a four stars for the taste. It's not bad at all. I would drink it every day if it weren't bad for me.

review/summary: Review of illy issimo Capucinno Coffee drink
review/text: I'm a very big consumer of caffiene beverages, drinking multiple beverages a day.  I'd always heard excellent things about illy issimo beverages.  Its interesting to note that as gourmet and Italian as the name may sound, the brand is owned by Coca Cola and is only distributed in the US and Japan.  Their website describes the brand as "illy issimo offers a range of ready-to-drink coffee made with illy's unique blend of 100% natural Arabica coffee. illy issimo is made with the finest natural ingredients that create the pure pleasure of coffee and awaken the senses while you're on-the-go. illy issimo is sweetened with beet sugar, is Kosher certified and contains 15-110 calories per can."<br /><br />Having said that, the basis for the company seems to have been an Italian company named illycafe, SpA. This beverage came about through a partnership between Coca Cola and illycafe.<br /><br />To get a more honest assessment, I shared a can with several of my co-workers.  All of us agreed that the drink was tasty, refreshing and evocative in smell and texture.  I drank it at room temperature and I believe that may have been a mistake.  I also shook it, having missed the directions which specifically said not to shake it.<br /><br />In either case, I liked the beverage very much.  It was, perhaps, a little sweet for my tasates, but all of us (three of us) agreed that we would buy the drink again and recommend it.  I believe I may order a case for my office.<br /><br />Be aware that the chocolate taste really pops in this beverage.  It tastes a little heavy, like a 70% cocoa taste.  If you are one of those unfortunates that do not like chocolate or are indifferent to the taste, you may wish to look elsewhere (Amazon lists 14 different drinks).  For me, this one was great!

review/summary: Tastes like other cold coffee drinks...
review/text: This tastes like Starbuck's frappucino cold drinks you can buy in the grocery store.  So my only concern would be price comparision - I would probably end up going with the cheaper of the two because they taste a lot alike.<br /><br />Pros - the whole can is only 100 calories... made with lowfat milk and cocoa.  The drink is not too sweet, but not bitter either.  Worked just like a cup of coffee for that nice "pick me up" the morning I drank it.<br /><br />Cons - can't really think of any right now...<br /><br />Overall, decent drink.  Like I said before, it is comparable to Starbuck's brand in taste, but not sure about price.  If it is cheaper, it's a nice alternative to it's more expensive counterparts without sacrificing taste.

review/summary: A bit weak for my tatse
review/text: "illy issimo" Cappuccino Coffee Drink looked like an interesting beverage when I was sent a sample can as part of Amazon Vine.  However when I tried it I found it was OK but a bit weaker than I would have wanted.<br /><br />Note that this is a sweetened beverage - and of course nothing bearing a semblance to an authentic cappuccino served at a restaurant of coffee house.  But I appreciate the fact that it was only moderately sweetened, much less so than sweetened coffee drinks you might find at a McDonalds or convenience store.  I also like that only a small amount of cocoa was added, preventing the drink from starting to resemble chocolate milk.  Unfortunately, there was also too little coffee flavor my taste.  I really wanted to taste at least some roasted flavor in the drink, but there was little to none of this.<br /><br />For those who want a mild lightly sweet coffee drink, illy issimo Cappuccino is certainly worth a try.  But your in search for a bolder taste then you may be a bit disappointed with this product as I was.

review/text: These are actually pretty good!  They say "Cappuccino" but really it's a "Mocha Cappuccino" -- lots of chocolate in there, and it's more of the sweetness of a mocha than the bitter of a pure cappuccino.<br /><br />It didn't specify "keep refrigerated" or "serve cold", though that's what I did -- basically iced coffee.  Plenty of caffeine kick to it as well.  All in all, I wasn't expecting much from a can of coffee and was pleasantly surprised.

review/summary: Tastes great
review/text: If you are already a fan of illy coffee in general (whole bean, ground, espresso), most likely you'll enjoy this can of Cappucino Coffee.<br /><br />The flavor of this drink is heavy on coffee with light milk (lowfat) added. The bitterness of the coffee is only lightly offset by the milk, so hopefully if you decide on this drink, it will be for a coffee flavor and not a more milky coffee flavor. There is also a hint of sweetness though I did notice that the sweetness seems to be closer to the bottom of the can. The can indicates that it shouldn't be shaken, so maybe this is expected?<br /><br />There are 100 calories per can and gave me a decent caffeine jolt.<br /><br />The can indicates this is a product of Denmark and is distributed by the Coca Cola company. The weird part here is that illy is an Italian brand... guess it costs too much to import from Italy? No idea there.<br /><br />I only received one can as part of the Vine program, but have purchased single serve cans of this on my own and will, without doubt, purchase further cans of it.

review/summary: Not much coffee flavor going on....
review/text: I was excited to try this after waking up after a late night.  Ahhhh, just the thing, an espresso beverage with milk and sweetener.  Here's what I expected, a pronounced coffee taste, with a splash of cream and nicely sweetened.  The beverage fell short for me, and here's why....I didn't really get a strong coffee taste at all.  It really felt like it had been completely watered down, so since the coffee taste was my biggest expectation it fell way short of my expectations.  If it had had more coffee flavor like a real cappuccino or a nicely done cream and sugar coffee I would have been happy, but that lacklaster taste didn't do it.  Too bad....the size was perfect, calories at 100 was doable, but I won't be purchasing this one.

review/summary: tasty pick-me-up
review/text: I got this Illy Cappuccino drink for my coffee-fanatic husband, but only had a taste myself since I can't have caffeine. We chilled it before trying it, because we're of the mindset that coffee should either be hot or cold, not anywhere in between.<br /><br />My immediate impression was that it reminded me of Starbuck's Mocha Frappuccino, without the dizzying amount of sugar. Nicely balanced coffee taste with a touch of cocoa and a nice creaminess that didn't take away from the coffee flavor. It's not too sweet either, just right. My husband didn't taste the cocoa immediately and had to look at the can for confirmation (I am the chocolate aficionado in the family!). He agreed that the sweetness was just right and the flavors nicely balanced.<br /><br />For 100 calories and only 18 grams of sugar, this is a nice pick-me-up for those who need a caffeine boost in the afternoon or who don't have time to brew coffee before heading out to work. For the price, though, my husband would rather buy an energy drink that's three times the size at the same price (he always has coffee in the morning so he doesn't need a replacement for that). As a sucker for iced coffee who doesn't always have the patience to wait for my coffee to cool before making an iced mocha, I will be on the lookout for a decaf version and yes, I'd stock up! Good stuff!!

review/summary: For extra fun, give this to a toddler and see what happens!
review/text: I'm not much of a coffee drinker. I've had a few cold coffee drinks here and there, but I love coffee ice cream and candies. I decided to give this cappuccino drink by illy issimo a chance since I've been trying a few new things lately (like how I had Doritos for the first time last week in my nearly 27 years of existence). My initial reaction was that it didn't taste very good, but again, that's probably because I don't drink coffee very much. But after a few sips, I got used to it. I'm not saying it tasted good by any means, but it's certainly not the worst thing I've drank this year. Coffee fans will either love or hate this, depending on their personal preferences.<br /><br />The nutrition info listed on the can is a bit reassuring, since this drink isn't that bad for you, and you get a little bit of protein too. It's fairly low in sugar for a drink like this too. And while it's not advertised as an energy drink, I actually felt upbeat for an hour or two after finishing the can...something I can't say for other drinks I've had like Mountain Dew or Jarritos.<br /><br />I'm giving it 3 stars because it's just plain ok in my book. 'nothing special, but not terrible. It's still weird drinking coffee from a can though. Would I recommend it to anyone? Probably not, unless they could only choose between this and Diet Pepsi.

I ordered this through the Amazon Vine program, and I was looking forward to testing it, but it unfortunately burst open during shipping, so I received nothing but a soggy package that smelled like sour milk. Not being one to complain about a gift, I chalked it up to bad luck.<br /><br />This happened a few days before I took a long road trip, and this turned out to be a blessing in disguise. On a particularly hot day, I stopped for gas and saw these in the cooler at the gas station, so I purchased one. How refreshing! It is the perfect drink to enjoy on a hot day while driving. It truly hit the spot, and unlike other brands of canned coffee beverages (including Starbuck's), this one has an authentic coffee flavor with the perfect balance of milk and sweetener. This is the second canned coffee I have tried by illy, and there seems to be a real emphasis on quality versus quantity.<br /><br />And when it comes to coffee, I'll take quality any day.

review/text: This is a delicious and refreshing drink.  It taste especially great over ice. It doesn't have any bitter taste, and has just the right amount of cream in it.  I enjoyed it very much.  It's not cheap per can, but if you can spare it for a quick cappuccino on the go, then get this.  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Good Taste, Bad Price
review/text: This drink is about on par with the Starbucks variety you usually see in bottles (sold in retail and Starbucks stores).<br /><br />Without being too snobbish sounding, it has a nice coffee bite with just the right amount of creamer to keep it from being bitter.  It does leave a have an aftertaste on the tongue, though, but it's not overwhelming.<br /><br />What is overwhelming is the price.  $2 per can?  Even Starbucks isn't that greedy.  Remember, this isn't an energy drink, it's coffee.  Guess Coca-Cola (the actual producers of this product) must need the dough.

review/summary: Coffeeless coffee drink
review/text: I thought it was odd that this is marketed as a coffee drink when it has no coffee listed in the ingredients at all.  It does not really have much coffee flavor either.  I would describe it as not very sweet chocolate milk with a gritty, cocoa taste.  It does have a "hint" of what I perceive as artificial coffee flavor.  As other reviewers mentioned, it does have an odd aftertaste.  I gave it 2 stars because it wasn't terrible but it was certainly below average.

review/summary: Good can o coffee
review/text: Or Cappucino I guess.<br /><br />I'm not a big coffee "aficianado" or basically someone who is snooty about coffee.  I can appreciate a good cup of joe.  I do know many gourmet coffees in the US are just average and many store varieties are basically sewage water.  I've experienced coffee that is served in a coffee shop where the beans are picked literally in the "back yard" (humid subtropical country).<br /><br />This isn't on that level of coffee, but it's surprisingly more nearer to it than anything I've bought so far.  Starbucks included.  Taste wise (coffee flavor) it tastes great.<br /><br />Made with cellulose gel and gum and carrageenan to give it some body, else it would just be flavored what, as it would be normally.  But you gotta make a product more appealing for the masses ;)

review/summary: Not a Bad Canned Coffee, but I've Had Better
review/text: I'm not a big coffee drinker, but when comparing Illy's Issimo Coffee Drink to other canned coffees, like those from Starbucks, the taste seems a bit less "natural."  Instead of tasting the lowfat milk and cocoa that the can mentions in upper-case, reassuring letters, I seem to taste the cellulose gum and artificial coloring, and no cocoa whatsoever.<br /><br />One thing I did like about Illy's canned coffee is that it wasn't as sweet as Starbucks.  I find the older I get the less sweet I like things to be.  I also liked the size of the can since I'm not a big fan of post-coffee jitters.<br /><br />Illy's coffee isn't bad, but it isn't really anything special either.  I'd buy it again if something else wasn't available, or if I was in the mood for something less sweet.

It was just right, not too bitter, not to sweet, and the coffee taste was some of the best i have had. It is also better than the frapuccino's that come in the glass bottles.

review/summary: Nice coffee flavored iced drink for 100 calories
review/text: If you have an iced coffee flavor drink craving at 100 calories, this is not a bad idea (considering the alternative mega-calorie drinks at coffee chains). It has a little bit of everything, thus the 100 calories. The milk is low fat, so it has a more light watery milk taste. The sugar is there (18g) but flavor-wise it loses to the coffee+cocoa taste, which dominates. Flavor wise, this is closer to the coffee/espresso/cocoa side than the sugar/cream side. I personally don't find it creamy enough to call it a mocha (maybe a very light mocha). My preferred serving is in a small but tall glass with oblong ice cubes so the water melts and ices more uniformly.<br /><br />It comes in a recycable coffee-color-coded can which opens up top like a soda can. The instructions say do not shake. One can is one serving, which is 8.45 fluid ounces, with 100 calories, 1.5g fat (1g saturated), 2% cholesterol, 3% sodium, 18g sugars, a little bit of fiber (under 1g), 4g protein, and 10% calcium.<br /><br />The caffeine is certainly there, 81mg in one can, it gives you a caffeine boost but it is not strong enough to turn you into Mad TV's Stan the Java man :)

review/text: If you like strong coffee, this is the product for you. To me, it was a little too potent, but if you have a more European taste for coffee, you might find it to your liking. It has a heck of a kick (well, to me it did) and does the job if you need caffeine for medicinal (cough cough) purposes.<br /><br />The cans are a little on the small side, but I guess that's the point: Small and potent.<br /><br />As for the flavor, it's pretty good for strong coffee. I can't complain.<br /><br />All in all, I'm not sure I'd grab this again, but only because it's not to my personal liking. It's a well-made product that will appeal to some people, but not others.

review/summary: move over Frappuccino (but could be even less sugared)
review/text: To me, the quality of the coffee flavor was good (what I would expect from Illy), with smoothness rather than bitterness. However, the amount of coffee flavor is a bit too weak, so that the flavor of the sugar and milk dominate more than they should. And I didn't even realize that there was any cocoa in it until I read the ingredients.<br /><br />It is much better than the bottled Starbucks Frappuccino, because the Frappuccino has way too much sugar compared to this one. So if you want a sweet milky coffee drink, this is the one to get.<br /><br />Small Print:  it was "produced for" and "distributed by" Coca-Cola, product of Denmark.

review/text: I am not a canned coffee drink person, but wanted to try this and I must say I was pleasantly surprised at the taste and consistency and the fact there was no aftertaste.  I did not drink it chilled. It was sitting on the kitchen counter - I was having a 'yawny' Sunday afternoon and decided to give it a try.  Maybe it was the power of suggestion or maybe it was the caffeine, or maybe a bit of both, but I actually did feel a bit refreshed after drinking it. No more yawns :)<br /><br />I have to be careful with the amount of sodium in a product and this contains 60 mg.  The sugar is 18 g. Carb 19g.  I would keep a few cans in the pantry for now and then, but for me, I would not drink one every day, but this would be my choice of canned coffee drink because I actually DID like it!

I'm a real baby about sweet, milky coffee, but this is just fine. It reminds me of the canned coffee I find in Europe or in Vietnamese groceries - so cosmopolitan! This isn't as fatty or over-sweet as some of the popular American cold coffee drinks, and I like the lighter taste. It's worth keeping around.

review/text: I am familiar with Starbuck's bottled frappuchino drinks and definitely prefer the illy product. When it is hot outside the last thing I want is to feel weighed down with a sugary creamy drink. The illy cappuccino drink is a delicious beverage perfect for summer. It is not too sweet or too creamy.<br /><br />The taste is overwhelmingly espresso based with a definite background flavor of chocolate. One serving, a can, has one hundred calories, 1.5 grams of fat and 4 grams of protein. As a soft drink substitute I'd select this every time.

review/text: My first reaction to this product was to recoil at the strong in-your-face coffee taste, and the aftertaste in my mouth was not pleasant either. I couldn't figure out whether it was bitter or sweet, it was a fight between the overbearing old-coffee taste, and the sweetness. Not something I could finish.<br /><br />I gave the rest of the can to my husband, who LOVED it! Go figure. He put it over ice, and that did not improve it enough for me to drink it but he was completely satisfied with it both in the can and in a glass. If I bought a case of these, he would happily drink them.<br /><br />He's a coffee lover, I'm timid about coffee and don't like very strong coffee flavors. I would not buy them for myself but would buy them for my husband.

review/text: How much can you say about an iced coffee? Naturally, everyone has their own preference for strength and sweetness.  This one is perfect for MY taste. The coffee flavor is pronounced, and the cream is "there" but not drowning out the coffee flavor.  Compared to a bottled frappaccino (you know which one I mean) this is far less sweet and tastes much more like a true iced coffee rather than a coffee flavored milk-shake. Also unlike some flavors/brands I've tried, this one doesn't have a tinny flavor that many canned drinks acquire.  Overall, I'm very pleased with it.

review/summary: A mellow mocha that's a cool treat:  but clearly not a cappuccino
review/text: As most coffee nerds know, a cappuccino is coffee with milk and foam while a mocha is a coffee with chocolate.  This is a mocha with a lightly sweet and mild chocolate flavor.<br /><br />I've had quite a few brands of canned mochas before and this so far is my favorite.  Typically the ones I have taste like chocolate milk with a bit of coffee flavor.  Coffee was definite the dominant flavor here with the sugar, chocolate, and milk an accent to the drink rather than the main focus.<br /><br />I tried this cold, but think it would be great affigato (poured over ice cream) as a nice dessert.  I'm sure it would be delicious hot as well.  At 100 calories for this small can it's a nice treat without blowing your calorie budget.<br /><br />When you need a pick me up and want something sweet and chocolaty, this is a great compromise.

'Better' ingredients and the convenience of Amazon shipping may make this the superior option over grocery/gas station options like the Starbucks cans.

review/summary: Rich coffee beverage reminds me of coffee ice cream
review/text: While I like coffee, I don't drink it every day. I mostly drink it when I'm cold, sometimes with dessert, or with company. When I drink it, I do enjoy it - it's just not a habit for me.<br /><br />Still, occasionally I crave something coffee flavored, whether it be coffee itself, coffee ice cream (yum!) or a coffee drink. I do very much enjoy cappuccino and espresso and am likely to order after dinner at an Italian restaurant.<br /><br />The illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cappuccino sounded like a nice refreshing beverage for warmer weather, so I wanted to give it a try. What I found was a rich, tasty beverage that reminds me of coffee ice cream. While I would say the flavor is delicious, it is way too rich for me to drink more than a quarter of the can in one sitting. I wrapped the top with foil and enjoyed the rest later.<br /><br />I daresay someone who drinks cold coffee beverages more often than I do will be able to down this can pretty quickly. For me, it isn't something I would buy frequently, but it is a consideration for when I want something a little different.

review/text: Remember when a great cup of coffee costed less than a buck? Now we're looking at up to 5x that for arguably no better a product. All I can say is, I'm glad I don't drink coffee much anymore.  It's gotten to be as expensive a habit as smoking, and neither one is good for you.  This illy cappuccino drink tastes really good, but apparently they're trying to compete with the Red Bull market -- both cans are strikingly similar in size, shape and cost.  It tastes good, but I seriously question the price.  Would I drink one if someone offered it to me? Maybe, depending on if I'm in the mood for coffee.  Would I spend upwards of $3 a can for it and buy it for myself?  Never.  But if you're into coffee and looking for something that tastes good and can be taken on the go, this is a pretty good one.  I just can't get over the cost and don't think it's really worth it.  It tastes good, but not that good.

review/summary: A delicious blend for on-the-go
review/text: As many reviewers have stated, it tastes like coffee in a can.  But, let's be honest, that's exactly what it is.  And, for what it is, I found it to be pretty delicious.  I typically like my coffee with a little sugar and whole milk or cream, depending on the type of coffee.  I was worried that this cappuccino would be too bitter, but was pleasantly surprised.  It had just the right amount of sweetness and milk.  The can makes it very portable with no worry of breakage, as with the Starbucks Frappiccino's, so if you need to toss it in your bag for a little caffeine boost later, you're good to go.

review/summary: very strong coffee
review/text: I love strong coffee and I love iced coffee so this little can is a whopping good time.  I grabbed this on my way out to work one morning and the only complaint I have is that it doesn't come in a bigger can.  However, the strong taste is probably best in moderation.  It tasted freshly brewed and hit the spot. It also gave me that much needed caffeine boost on my way.  Hope they develop some more flavors in the future.

review/text: I do not like nor do I drink coffee.  I do love cappuccino, my favorite being <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0056A1XNM">Community Coffee Instant Cappuccino Mocha, 15-Ounce (Pack of 3)</a>.  This drink, illy issimo, doesn't taste at all like cappuccino, just plain, cold, sweet, strong coffee.<br /><br />Shaking the can is not recommended so maybe if you could stir it before drinking.  I tried with the straw I was using, stirring was not an option at the time, but it didn't seem to help.<br /><br />If you like sweet coffee, you will likely enjoy this.  But if you are expecting Cocoa flavored Cappuccino, you just might be disappointed.

I was worried canned coffee wouldn't taste good, but it was better than I expected. This product is made in Denmark.

The taste of these is actually nice, which is frankly surprising since the idea of a bullet with the flavor of coffee sounded a lot like more than a flesh wound. Still, it turned out great. I do wonder about the fact that it is not piping hot, but that, I suppose, is a choice we make when buying in a can.

review/summary: Another caffeine zap
review/text: You might be asking who would buy coffee in a can instead of brewing their own.  Not me.  If judged purely by flavor and resemblance to home or coffee-shop blends, this comes up short.  To be fair, it's not bad-tasting.  But there's no appeal to the nose and the overall experience doesn't match up.  But that's not what this is.  This belongs on the shelf with so-called energy drinks.  A close reading shows that it is brought to us by a popular purveyor of caffeinated sugar-water.  It's about the buzz.  For that, it works.  I downed a can before a late-night trip down a hazardous mountain pass.  I could have done that drive half a dozen times before the buzz wore off.  I was glad I had it, and it's the sort of thing I might pick up at the mart before a long drive.  But as coffee?  No.

review/text: This is the sweet, creamy, slightly thick drink you'd expect out of a canned cold coffee product.  I get the idea they're trying to emulate a Vietnamese iced coffee, as the flavor profile is similar, especially with the addition of cocoa.  It's obviously not nearly as good as a fresh one made with Trung Nguyen, but not bad at all, especially when you consider how quickly this one is ready to drink and how quick the cleanup is.<br /><br />It's a little too sweet for my taste, but I expect the average consumer won't mind.  Definitely above average compared to similar products.

review/summary: Tastes like coffee; not Cappuccino but tastes smooth
review/text: What is surprising to me about this drink is that it says "Do Not Shake" on the can. The color is dark brown.  It taste like a good cup of coffee, smooth and not bitter or acidic. However,  to me it is not creamy like Cappuccino.  I would have rated this 4 stars for the taste but because I do not consider this a Cappuccino I lowered this to three stars.  Each 8.45 ounce serving is 100 calories with 15 calories from fat.  The first four ingredients are coffee, low fat milk, sugar, and cocoa powder.<br /><br />Now my boyfriend really liked this drink (he shared it with me) and said it tasted very creamy to him.  He likes caffeine so at 81 mg it's about half the mg in a cup of drip coffee (115 - 175 mg).  He felt this tastes better than Starbucks drinks.  However, at the current price of about $1.80 per can he thought it was too expensive and would rate this 4 stars only because of the price.  If the price were $1.25 per can,  he would buy this and have rated it 5 stars.

The only drawback was a slightly disagreeable aftertaste which seemed to linger.  Note the instruction on the can, "Do Not Shake". (I saw that caution right after I removed it from the fridge and shook it up . . . decided to return it for a few hours to allow it to settle).<br /><br />I don't see myself getting hooked on this product, but it's a good acceptable alternative when time/convenience factors call for it.

review/text: This product is okay, but I did not really care for it.  It is extremely mild and tastes like milk with just a teaspoon of cappuccino in it.  It is smooth and doesn't taste bad; it just doesn't taste like a cappuccino.  It certainly doesn't have the rich espresso taste advertised.  You can barely taste any coffee flavor to it at all!  If you like real cappuccinos and are looking for a faster, easier alternative, this isn't it.  You'll be very disappointed.  If you don't like coffee or espresso drinks but are looking for something much milder to drink, you might like it.

review/summary: Mild and smooth
review/text: Reviewing something like this is more than a matter of 'I like this' or 'I hate this'. Taste is subjective. On opening, a faint but pleasant coffee aroma.  Pour in one long stream and you'll get a crema-ish froth which is quite nice...but bad things happen if you shake the can. Exactly what those things are, I can't say, but the stern 'DO NOT SHAKE' across the top was enough to convince me, lol!<br />Anyway, this is mild, and seems to be less caffeine than it's competitor. Bit of a cooked milk taste, and not overly sugary, in my opinion. Nice for the afternoon.

review/summary: Coffee flavor, but terrible mouthfeel
review/text: The illy products have reasonable coffee flavor.  However, they use some odd thickeners, like carrageenan.  This apparently is an attempt to give the coffee a creamy consistency, as though it has milk in it.  To me, it results in the coffee having a really strange feel in the mouth.  I'm a big fan of coffee.  Consequently, I'm not a big fan of this drink.  Too sweet and too odd in its mouthfeel.

review/summary: Falling in Love With illy issimo
review/text: I received illy issimo Cappuccino Coffee Drink from the Amazon Vine program. It arrived the same day as the Caffe but I tried them on separate days. The Cappuccino flavor was nutty and sweet, the same great flavor as the Caffe but creamier. The espresso style coffee contained low fat milk and cocoa. This 8.5 oz can contains only 100 calories but tastes like dessert. I love these ready to drink energy beverages. They come in lightweight aluminum cans with a push pop open tab.<br /><br />I wasn't able to get much of a break at work and I had packed Cappuccino as a "just-in-case" measure. Turns out I really needed it that day.<br />Cappuccino contains sugar also, 18 grams as compared to the Caffe which is 10. I enjoyed it but the sugar wreaked havoc with my head.If you don't mind sugar you are in for a treat. Give it a try. I will be looking for their sugar free versions.

review/summary: Refreshing with just a hint of chocolate
review/text: Produced in Denmark and distributed stateside by Coca-Cola, illy issimo is a tasty little coffee drink that would likely appeal to the same folks that regularly buy Starbucks Frappuccino in glass bottles.  For the purposes of this review, I will try to compare the two products which are similar and yet also strikingly different.<br /><br />The illy drink is slightly smaller than a bottled Frapp, offering 8.45 ounces as opposed to Starbuck's 9.5 ounces.  Yet nutritionally, within that small difference, I found that illy has 90 fewer calories (100 as opposed to 190) and one gram less saturated fat (1 as opposed to 2) than Starbucks.  These are minimal differences unless, of course, you drink these sorts of beverages regularly.  Drinking illy once per day instead of a Starbucks Frapp would ultimately save you close to 33,000 calories in a full calendar year and, of course, 365 grams of saturated fat.<br /><br />As far as taste, I found that illy emphasized the coffee flavor with a refreshing hint of chocolate.  As far as the bottled Frappuccino goes, I've found that Starbucks is the exact opposite, emphasizing the chocolate taste with more of a hint of coffee.  Ultimately, it's up to personal tastes.  I'm not a regular bottled coffee drinker, but I would be willing to reach more often for illy for the simple fact that it's a little bit healthier and a little less sweet than Starbucks.

review/summary: Slightly lower caffiene than a cup of coffee, but tasty
review/text: The flavor of the cappuccino is very muted.  But it is a coffee drink, not a straight-up cappuccino.<br /><br />Coffee is the main ingredient, followed by lowfat milk, sugar, cocoa powder, etc... but I mostly taste the milk.<br /><br />I think this is a good competitor against the glass-bottle Starbucks, mostly because it is made of metal and would be safer to take camping (which I like to do).<br /><br />Most importantly, there is no metallic aftertaste.<br /><br />It has 81mg of caffiene, for those who want to know... double the amount of any Coke product.  But its less than any normal cup of coffee you can buy from McDonalds, Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks, etc.<br /><br />So if you are used to drinking a cup of coffee every morning, and you substitute this, you may feel like there isn't quite enough caffiene in it. You might have to drink two.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you can't get to your hot cuppa joe for whatever reason, this is a tasty replacement.  Although slightly low-octane.

review/summary: Pretty Good, but Not the Best Canned Coffee
review/text: I'm not a coffee connoisseur by any means,  but I have a general idea of what a good coffee should taste like and this is not it.  Getting a canned coffee is for those people who are going to places completely inaccessible to decent coffee, such as backpacking, at the beach, and on the bus at 6 in the morning when you're late and the line at Starbucks is too long.  But let's be reasonable...even at these places, there's probably a good chance that you can still get a decent coffee, albeit at a higher cost.  That said, illy issimo is not my first choice for a coffee, nor is it my first choice for a caffeinated drink.<br /><br />illy issimo coffee drink is good in a pinch.  I probably wouldn't buy a case of the stuff, but it's a quick, cold coffee drink that isn't too bad, so I'd probably buy it occasionally if I didn't feel like spending $4 on a Starbucks-esque cappuccino, but still wanted a cappuccino like drink.  It's not terribly sweet, and only slightly milky, and overall, the taste isn't bad.  It's not really for me, but it isn't so bad that I wouldn't drink it, so 2 stars for taste, and 1 star for portability/convenience.  I would definitely suggest trying it before buying a case - everyone's taste is different.

review/summary: Very Dissappointed
review/text: I just attempted to use this product for baking a couple of days ago and was so very dissappointed.  I have used a few different brands of Date Sugar and have never had a clumping problem.  I believe most of the companies who produce date sugar have to cut some oat flour into it so it doesn't just form one sticky lump.  This is how Bob's Red Mill Date Sugar is...one big 24-oz block of sticky lump.  I had to pound and pound on the mound of date sugar and attempt to whittle away at it with a knife.  I thought I had pulverized it enough to bake with it and boy was I wrong.  When I poured the batter into loaf pans, it had big red clumps of date sugar poking out of the batter.  I picked out what lumps were visible but when I cut into the finished product, it had patches throughout that were sticky and felt like the bread was not done.  I could tell these patches were from the clumps of date sugar.  I was so very sad I bought this product.

Olestra is a no-calorie fat substitute discovered by Proctor and Gamble back in the late 60s. It was finally approved as a food additive almost 30 years later. It has the warning of side effects of stomach cramps and diarrhea. However, these side effects are not supposed to occur unless you consume a large amount of it in a short space of time. I have not been eating these for long, but I have not experienced these side effects. Should they eventually occur, I will update this review.<br /><br />These chips are only 75 calories for approximately 20 chips. Most "regular calorie" chips you eat will post somewhere around 150 calories for 11 or 12 chips. So comparatively (even tho the packaging says 50% of the calories, effectively its 30% of the calories of most regular potato chips portions. I brought these home, mixed up some French Onion dip using 0% fat Greek yogurt (which to me tastes VERY similar to sour cream), and made a small plate each (one for me and one for my wife) of about 10 of these chips and a heaping soup spoonful of the dip. This resulted in a nice little afternoon snack for only about 60 calories! With regular potato chips and dip made with sour cream, you'd be in the 225 to 250 calorie range. To me, the dip tasted a little sharper than when made with sour cream. It is different, but it is still good. Of course, part of that may just be the brand of Onion Soup mix I used. I used a package of store brand mix, rather than say Lipton, and I'm sure there is a difference in the flavor I'm used to just from that.

review/summary: Great, great seller, love the chips!
review/text: I purchased 6 bags of these, and one of them came opened. Wrote to Sarah the seller, and she replied my email immediately. I asked her if I could do an exchange, but instead, she offered to send me a new bag, with no questions asked. I'm very pleased with the prompt delivery, freshness of product ( besides, these yummy snacks are really hard to find where I live... almost impossible to get) and excellent customer service. The purchase was worth every penny. Can't wait to place another order from her.

review/summary: Freight Damage
review/text: I received the shipment on time.  As soon as I saw the box left at my door my first response was that I was surprised that the carrier had even left it.  It was smashed to about 60%-70% of its origional size.  The whole top was caved in.  I opened all three bags and they were all nothing but "bits and crumbs", not "chips".  I tossed the case and won't be buying Lay's again.

review/summary: Noodles are not as described!
review/text: The description for these noodles is "Wide rice stick noodles are typically used to make Kee Mao (drunken noodles) or pad siew. They are 3/8" wide, and after soaking get about 1/2" wide. Aside from being wide, they are identical to the more common but thinner rice stick used to make the famous "Pad Thai"....The noodles should be soaked in warm (hot to the touch) water for about an hour or so depending on your preference."<br /><br />These are NOT the wide noodles for Pad Siew.  We tried soaking these noodles in warm water, but after about 45 minutes, they just dissolved and disintegrated into the water!!!  They DID NOT EXPAND!  I bought these noodles specifically because the description notes they are NOT the pad thai noodles - but they ARE!  They are the same thickness (i.e. NOT thick) as pad thai noodles and I could have bought this same package at my local asian store, and NOT waited for shipping!<br /><br />VERY disappointed, will not purchase from this seller again.

review/summary: A Product Review on Miracle Whip Only
review/text: We have used Miracle Whip for years on sandwiches and salads and are grateful to Kraft for manufacturing this product. It adds a refreshing taste that has never gotten tiresome even after decades of use!<br /><br />At our house we are never without a supply of Miracle Whip. One of my favorites is a sandwich composed of whole wheat bread topped first with Miracle Whip on both sides followed by Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter on one side and either bananas or sharp cheddar cheese slices on the other. To me that is sandwich heaven! I know, that combination might sound unlikely to some of you but in this case beauty is in the taste buds of the eater! If you like peanut butter and bananas I think you'll find the Miracle Whip is a tasty addition to the mix!<br /><br />One of the beauties of Miracle Whip is its adaptability; it works well and adds flavor and zest to almost any fanciful combination of ingredients one can imagine.<br /><br />If you enjoy a sandwich or a salad now and then, Miracle Whip can be a tangible asset to your list of favorite foods.

review/summary: very good product at an OUTRAGEOUS price
review/text: howdy y'all,<br /><br />outrageous price? this is thirty bucks for two from "Huggy's Haven". it's THREE dollars for one at the local grocery. PLUS hh wants an additional seven dollars shipping?<br /><br />my mom didn't raise a wastrel. [*grin*]<br /><br />the item itself is quite good. like many raised in the bottom end of the middle class in the states, i like miracle whip better than real mayo. i also like margarine better than butter. they were lots cheaper than the real stuff when i was a kid, so that's what i got. i was in my twenties when i finally realized why the nice restaurants seemed to serve such icky butter and mayo. [*grin*]<br /><br />still, this price is mind boggling.<br /><br />rated a ONE due to the price. would have been a THREE [nothing more or less than expected, so no plus or minus] otherwise.<br /><br />take care,<br />lee

review/summary: VERY Nice Vanilla! You Get What you pay for when it comes to vanilla...but this takes the sting out of it!
review/text: Vanilla is one of those items where you tend to get what you pay for...scrimping most often results in the delivery of some dried up, outdated bean good for little more than a hint of the real thing.<br /><br />While this is not the least expensive vanilla available - it's competitively priced especially considering the quality and freshness. This comes with a pack of three glass "vials" that each contain two nice specimens of vanilla means. Fresh, wonderfully aromatic and delicious.<br /><br />Additionally, this is certified organic and non-irradiated. Frontier seems to have a strong commitment to providing quality spices/other at affordable prices. I've recently ordered several items and have been so pleased that I continue to replace my spices/other with this brand as needed.

For a real treat, add a half cup of Nutella to the Junket chocolate mix for chocolate-hazelnut ice cream.  You won't be disappointed!  I just wish both Junket and Nutella made sugar-free!  THAT would be true heaven!

review/text: If you're going to sip this lusciously delicious tea you might as well grab your kitty or puppy, a good book, blanket and snuggle up in the favorite armchair because good times are ahead!<br /><br />Having the pleasure of all ready trying out some of the Ahmad teas I was pretty sure this was a good purchase but it ended up being tasty beyond my predictions. This tea tastes like a wonderful black smooth tea with the succulent mouth watering flavors of juicy apricots. I prefer a black tea with fruit blend to herbal fruit teas when I want something soothing because the black tea give the fruit unparallel depth and character.<br /><br />This really bursts with flavor when sugar is added and it can be drank day and night. I'm really looking forward to tasting other Ahmad flavors like Strawberry and passion fruit and maybe their Earl Gray. This is easily one of my favorite teas and I can't see anyone not loving it from the first sip!

review/summary: Lovely Black Tea Infused with Apricot Flavor
review/text: I have gone "tea crazy" over the past six months by buying many flavored teas from Amazon including Ahmad Tea Apricot Black Tea. I enjoy flavored teas and my husband likes African or English Breakfast-type tea as well as rooibos which I do not care for. We figured out that he used coconut milk and honey in his tea and he likes savory food for breakfast/lunch. I drink my tea without any sweetener or coconut milk and I like sweet food for breakfast. This tea satisfies both of us because the apricot flavoring is not strong which is good for my husband. And I enjoy the taste of apricot although I wish it lent a stronger flavoring. I also bought an apricot ginger black tea by Good Earth and found that was not strong enough either. Perhaps apricot is too delicate for my taste buds. I do like both of these teas but if there was a natural way to boost the flavoring I would be happier.
