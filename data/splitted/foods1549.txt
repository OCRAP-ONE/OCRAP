review/summary: Great product, but overpriced
review/text: While a little pricey, these Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate bars are probably my favorite KIND bar and I've virtually tried them all.  I've have consistency issues with the Yogurt bars so I avoid them now.  Would be nice to see these under a buck per bar.

review/text: This bar is super yummy, but I have to agree that falsely advertising it as an almond walnut macadamia bar, when most of the bar is peanuts, is a big turn off!

review/summary: I won't order this one again
review/text: I'm a HUGE fan of Kind bars in general and have tried several varieties. I chose the almond cashew with flax + Omega-3 this time because it was more price friendly than the others. I should have known that you get what you pay for. This was the most unsatisfying Kind bar I've ever had. It's dry and lacks taste. Now I'm stuck with a whole box.

review/summary: Too bland
review/text: I ordered this item, hoping that the combination of nuts would be good, but I was sadly disappointed with the taste.  Its like they tried to use as little sweetener as possible, leaving a dry, dull, bland taste and its like I could have just bought a bag of mixed nuts for cheaper than what I paid for this box of bars.<br /><br />Would not buy again.

review/text: We love these bars...they make a great snack for my preschool daughter who has multiple food allergies.  No soy, hooray!  I have been buying them for about a year and a half.<br />This box we got from NetRush, though, tastes "off" and "old"...perhaps they were not properly stored.

review/summary: it's a sugar bomb
review/text: I bought the Cranberry Almond and the Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio. I'm not sure how anyone can comment on the flavor - it's sooooo sweet. The non GMO glucose + the sugar + the honey masks any flavor this bar might have. It's my fault. I should have read more closely. Not sure I understand how this is a "Low glycemic" food. Definitely not a KIND option if you're trying to reduce your overall sugar consumption.

review/summary: A great snack
review/text: These taste really good!<br /><br />The primary nut is almond, although there is a background of peanuts, and occasionally cashew. The sweet element is  made up of dried cranberries and a generous amount of dried cherries, held together by an undertone of honey and lashings of delicious dark chocolate to bind everything together. Delicious.<br /><br />A haiku adds class and authority to any review,or, to put it differently, what can seventeen syllables tell us about this product?<br /><br />Berries and cherries<br />Almonds peanuts cashews too<br />Choco honey yum.

review/text: May 15th, 2012 9:04 am<br />  I bought this product[KIND PLUS, Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio + Antioxidants Gluten Free] for my grandchildren for a healthy snack at school!<br />  When it came I tried it, it was very tasty, but very very sweet and it had something in it that was so hard to bite, that I thought it would chip my tooth! I told my daughter my concerns, but she said she would try it and let her children try it as well!<br />  They found nothing wrong with it!<br />  It was very tasty as I said, but I can not of good conscience recommend this as a healthy snack!  It is extremely sweet and children should be where they can brush their teeth after eating it! Which they would not be able to do at school!  I would not want whatever that tiny hard thing I bit on[maybe a hard grain] to chip a child's tooth. The adult should try it first to see if they want their child have this either as a for snack for school or for outside playing!<br />  As I said it was very tasty, but it was hard and just to to sweet! I first gave it 5 stars, but I felt I was not being honest when I am trying to eat as healthy as I can! I will not buy this product for my grandchildren nor for me again! And I love nuts/grains/fruits and all the Antioxidants this product offers, but it is just too sweet and that out weighs any nutritional value you gain! If The maker would not have it so sweet as it is, then I would try it again and then could give it a better review!  Not everything that sounds healthy is healthy! We see all the healthy stuff and then think wow this is good for us, but we neglect to notice the larger amounts of fats or salts or sugars that has been added and then it is not as healthy as we thought! It is the fats/ salts/ and sugars that is destroying our bodies from the inside out!<br />Polar2[Eya-Andrea]

review/summary: Why would anyone buy these?
review/text: I bought these to try out based on good Amazon reviews which made them sound like some kind of wonder bars that were healthy and would make you happy for eternity (or something). I bought two flavors of these kind bars to try out. One was borderline gross the other decent. Here's the thing though: these are overpriced and not healthy. Let me explain:<br /><br />These are marketed for people are paranoid about what they eat. It's marketed to the same people who buy organic milk, produce and always look for things like "gluten free" etc. Most of this product is marketing and selling an image. I'm sure this is free of whatever they think at the moment might harm you. You might get the impression then from their advertisements that these are healthy. They're not. They may be gluten free but they're high in sugar and calories. Despite having so much sugar and carbs you can't even taste it. One of these bars is ~200 calories and is almost completely carbs (and some fat).<br /><br />In addition, if you calculate it out, it's more than a dollar per bar. You could buy the ingredients for these bars and put them together without the sugar and it would be much more tasty and healthy. Just save yourself the money and buy the ingredients.<br /><br />Bottom line: These are just overpriced, unhealthy (but not tasty) snack bars whose strongest selling point is the attractive packaging and feel good marketing. It's amazing how much they cost too. I'm guessing it's mostly in the packaging and marketing.

review/text: These bars are great and truly a 5 star product. Some of the nuttier varieties from Kind are a little hard on your teeth, no worries like that with these. Nice soft, chewy, tasty. Best fruit/nut or granola bar I've found. Downside, a little on the pricey side and a little high in saturated fat. But the perfect sweet "healthy" natural treat, and gluten free, a wonderful plus. You can really taste the mangoes and the macadamia nuts. A nice balance of both. These bars have calcium added but you cannot taste it, they just taste delicious.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: These bars are more like candy then energy or nutrition bars. They do have a hefty amount of nuts and fruit though that sits atop a dark chocolate bed which is then drizzles with more yummy dark chocolate. I get these via subscription through amazon. They are almost always eaten within the first week of arrival. Everyone in my house loves them. Perfect snack to throw in your purse or grab as your walking out the door.

review/summary: So delicious!
review/text: I love Kind bars - gluten free, filling, and incredibly tasty. I've sampled many flavors and this one is incredible. Every bite I taste the cherries, the chocolate, and the cashews. I sampled this flavor at the grocery store and then RAN to Amazon to buy a box (free shipping! Low price!). I live in Texas, so buying food in the summer doesn't work (they are not packaged like food - you get a box in a box). Now that the temps are cooler and they will survive shipping I will be ordering many more boxes of Kind bars!

review/summary: price v. value: five stars, even with the peanuts
review/text: UPDATE: The five stars are for the almond-walnut-macadamia bars, peanuts and all. I gave the cashew-almond-omega3 bars a try later and was somewhat disappointed with them. Not as much flavor. Back to almond-walnut-macadamia bars.<br /><br />I've gone through a few boxes of the KIND bars named for their alleged content of almonds, walnuts, and macadamias. I haven't encountered any of the funny tastes, apparent staleness, or wrappers horribly stuck to the bars, that some reviewers have mentioned. As other reviewers point out, there are a lot of peanuts relative to the content of walnuts, macadamias, and walnuts. But it tastes good nonetheless, and for the price ($1.06 per bar if you buy on subscription) it  strikes me as a good value. This is a relatively high-calorie snack bar (almost 200 cal), but it's also high protein (10g), has extremely little saturated fat, and a relatively low amount of sugar. It's substantial enough that you can easily resist eating a second bar. The bars also contain some worthy vitamins and minerals in amounts sufficient to matter. So far, knock wood, the deliveries on Amazon's subscription have been fast and the product has arrived in excellent condition. I don't expect to get a gourmet no-peanuts bar for this price--it's a good product and good value at this price.

review/summary: One of the best KIND varieties
review/text: Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't allow me to review the different KIND flavors individually, so I have to do them all in this review.<br /><br />I picked up a box of Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio and Cranberry Almond a few weeks back when Amazon was doing another one of their KIND promotions. Among the varieties of KIND bars I've tried over the last few months, the Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio ones are easily my favorite in the whole line. They aren't overly sweet, and the variety of flavors in this version is excellent. While the pomegranate doesn't stand out much, the pistachio is definitely there as a nice subtle aftertaste.<br /><br />The Cranberry Almond, while still enjoyable, is a bit lower on my list - with nothing else to balance the flavors out, the cranberry flavor comes across a but too strong and tangy (though some might actually appreciate this).<br /><br />While I don't think these are meant to be more than snack/dessert bars (as opposed to meal replacements like with Clif of Powerbars), they certainly tide me over for at least an hour or two until I can eat a proper meal.

Other than that, I definitely would buy this again and recommend it. I just ordered another flavor too.

review/text: Taste is a personal issue so I won't comment on that.  Just be advised that compared to the Fruit and Nut variety which, if you hold one sideways, will actually slowly fold over, these are thicker and MUCH more solid.  If you have sensitive or loose teeth or maybe dentures, be forewarned.  You should take your bites with your molars or break off a piece by hand just to make sure your chompers can handle it.

review/summary: Delicious & Healthy!
review/text: I have tried a number of the Kind bars at this point because I have basically fallen in love with their line of products. It started with a Cranberry Almond one from Starbucks and since then, I have started buying several boxes every month. I don't like dark chocolate very much but thought I would give the Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate bar a try this time around.  I'm glad I did! Delicious and not at all bitter like I expected. It will be the perfect late afternoon snack for those days that I am craving sugar and/or chocolate at work.  Overall though, I like the Cranberry Almond the best and repeatedly go back to it as a staple for those times I skipped breakfast, need a snack, I'm on the road, etc. The Madagascar Vanilla is very good as is the Pomegranate Blueberry. Not so thrilled with the Mango and Apricot versions.  I've shopped around locally and online and Amazon seems to be the best place to buy them in terms of price, especially if you put them on Subscription. Kind's line of Grains is also good... The Maple Walnut is perfect heated in the microwave like oatmeal.  Strong excellent flavor and loaded with healthy grains, nuts, etc. Overall, I have been very pleased with Kind and will continue to buy their products as long as they remain available.

review/summary: KIND PLUS Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew Bars
review/text: This review is for the DARK CHOCOLATE CHERRY CASHEW flavor only....these are so good that I had to quit buying them so often because I would eat the whole box in 2 days! These are as good as candy bars. They DO NOT taste like any sort of "healthy" snack bar or anything. Now, some of the other flavors do and I think some of them are gross but this flavor is like eating a dang Chunky candy bar or something. Seriously, they are so good. They are really crumbly though so don't eat them in your jammies watching TV late at night (guilty!) or you will wake up covered in chocolate. :) But if you like nutty chocolate bars you will love these and you won't feel as guilty as if you were eating chocolate candy...but you won't be able to tell that you aren't!

review/text: The flavor of these is definitely what stands out immediately to me. Most healthy snack bars have either an unappetizing or bland flavor. The flavor of these is bold and the textures are great. The chewiness of the cranberries mixed with the crunchiness of the whole nuts makes for a great combination. They also are healthy for you and pretty filling. Great snack to give you energy for exercising while also helping you keep your food intake down.

review/text: These bars are great if you are sensitive to sugar. I have a hard time eating things that are hight in carbs with very little fat or protein. These bars are very well balance for an energy bar and I've never had a problem eating them. They taste very fresh and not as processed as most bars. They seem to be made of whole ingredients that you can see in each bite. They aren't too sweet and won't make your blood sugar hit the roof only to crash shortly after. They provide steady hunger relief. The flavors are wonderful. I love the peanut butter chocolate and the dark chocolate cherry cashew.

review/text: I saw people here complaining that the formula changed, but it seemed the same to me. Then recently I bought one that tasted awful. I figured it was me - maybe I had a cold coming on or something changed my taste buds for the day.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the good news is I can now find them at airports and everywhere. The bad news is that I've thrown away most of them half eaten as they almost taste "off" like they've gone bad. Very disappointed - I used to travel with 5 or 6 of these in my suitcase at all times. Hopefully they do something to revive their previous quality. Sometimes growth is painful.<br /><br />Someone post a review if they get better - until then I'm not buying any overly expensive and inedible bars. :(

review/summary: Break out the Beano/Peanut Bar w/Protein Powder Aftertaste
review/text: On the plus side they do fill you up & are packed with protein, filling & gluten free. On the downside - unless your idea of tasty is protein powder, I'd choose a handful of nuts versus this bar. Also you may want to consider Beano before eating these bars!!!<br /><br />LOVE the Almond Coconut KIND bars. Love the dark chocolate peanut butter ones, though more peanut than actual peanut butter. Taste somewhat similar to a healthy Baby Ruth. These Macadamia, Almond, Walnut bars have an initial odd protein powder aftertaste (though I don't think there's any in them). Once you keep eating it the initial taste goes away. I question why they would incorporate an odd taste when full of nuts that are protein packed. What's been added to make my tastebuds cringe at the unsavory taste? Peanut flavor outweighs the any flavor of other nuts once past the Protein Powder flavor. Barely a hint of macadamia nut flavor exists, though a promise of macadamia is what swayed me to order. All in all - would have been fantastic if able to elmininate the offputting protein powder taste. Wanted a tasty replacement for unhealthier counterparts. Unfortunately these failed to do the trick for me.<br /><br />A fan of the Almond & Coconut ones cause those have a great taste. These are off my list of future items to order.

And yes - these are made in the US of A. So, you don't have to worry about contamination.<br /><br />I have a personal preference against peanuts and unfortunately that limits your selection but there are still quite a few options. The Almond Cashew + Omega 3 is my favorite since it not only is all healthy nuts (no peanuts!) but also includes a vegetarian source of Omega 3 - flax seeds.<br /><br />Our four year old loves these bars as well and that makes these truly special (as part of what I can assure you is a very small list of healthy foods!) Amazon's price on these is the best!

They aren't sticky like some of them, and they don't just seem like another combination of almonds and fruit, like many of them seem to be. The peanut butter taste makes these really different from the others, and the drizzled dark chocolate is such a great addition. These are prone to becoming melty, though, so I keep them in my desk instead of a backpack or pocket. These are also hard to find in stores around me, so being able to get a box at a time is nice.

review/text: While the bar does contain a lot of peanuts, the peanuts are not the dominant flavor and neither are the cherries. Each ingredient is noticeable, but in the same way that one instrument is noticeable in an orchestra--they all play well together. What I like most about this bar is the dark chocolate and the texture. The bar is satisfyingly chewy with crunch from the peanuts and macadamia nuts, etc.  I was leery of this bar because I don't like chocolate covered cherries and thought it might have that flavor, but the cherry isn't overpowering and the bar isn't sickeningly sweet. It comes across like a somewhat healthy but flavor-rich treat for adults, not a bland granola bar or a kid's candy bar. Just ordered more on subscription.

Last few months bars taste much more cardboardy than before -- they used to taste like fresh nuts & dried fruit.

review/text: I love this product.  Best taste, texture and nutrition in an all natural bar.  I just started regular monthly shipment of 2 cases from Amazon.  First shipment arrived with the chocolate melted and it is a real pain to eat.  Amazon's fault not Kind's.  Even after putting them in the fridge to harden up the coating.  I receive my next shipment in a week and will let you know if shipping is a problem

review/text: My family devoured this batch and I'm buying more.  They taste nutty and chocolatey,  and have protein in them and stop the afternoon hunger pangs.  My only quibble is that my local store is selling them for $17.99,  so we are buying them from there for now,  but if you can't get them locally,  it's well worth getting them from here and they are yummy!

review/summary: High Protein, Low Carb + Delicious
review/text: I was looking for a low carb bar that tasted good and had a higher protein content. This KIND bar was perfect with 10g protein/bar and only 15g of carbs and it tastes absolutely delicious! I like the fact that it has a lot of nuts (which their good fats) which helps it break down slower and more evenly so that you don't get hungry as quick and your body gets to absorb the nutrients more evenly. I bought the high protein KIND bard with the dark chocolate as well but this Almond Walnut Macadamia one tastes better. I highly recommend it!

review/summary: Very Good, But Not My Favorite.
review/text: My nearby Fresh and Easy Market has a display of Kind Plus bars and I find it difficult to pass without picking one up. I like the nutritional specs and the low sugar content of the bars. Plus they're quite good tasting. I often have one as desert with my evening meal, as is the case tonight. This one was Almond Cashew with Flax. It was good, but I didn't care for it as much as several others. The chocolate one is my favorite. In any case, this is a good bar with good nutrition.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Good for you, tasty, but gooey
review/text: I really like these KIND bars. They're tasty, they're light, and they're good for you.<br /><br />The bars I'm reviewing are Pomegranate, Blueberry, and Pistachio. They really don't taste like any of those, they taste like an almond bar with various bits of indistinguishable fruit bits. Here are the ingredients, with the titled ingredients in all caps: Almonds, blueberry pieces (BLUEBERRY, apple, and plum puree), raw sugar, glycerol, citrus fiber, cashews, honey, raisins, glucose, POMEGRANATE, crisp rice, chicory fiber, PISTACHIOS, soy lecithin, natural flavors. The ingredients are always listed in descending order of how much is included, and KIND pulled a fast one by calling their "blueberry pieces" a separate ingredient, since it's really just apple puree. By my math guesstimate, there is less than 5% of Pomegranate, Blueberry, and Pistachio in the whole bar.<br /><br />Basically, this tasted like an almond bar. My advice is to read the ingredients, and expect it to taste like what's in the ingredients, and not go by what the title is on these bars.<br /><br />They're also really gooey. These are probably the stickiest bars I've ever had. I never pick them up with my hands, but I eat them out of the plastic.<br /><br />Also, I've ordered about ten of these boxes off of Amazon, and one box was rock hard. Not this one, but another kind. So if your box is hard as a rock, then just order another one, and odds are it will be okay.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Good for you<br />+Lots of natural ingredients<br />+One bar is a good snack (not too sweet, not too small, just right)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The ingredients on the title of the bar misrepresent the actual ingredients<br />-Very gooey and sticky. You won't be able to touch them with your hands<br />-From my experience, 10% of the boxes have bars that are hard as rocks

review/summary: Good but maybe my package was old.
review/text: I thought that these bars were very tasty if a bit on the expensive side.  My main complaint is that the bars disintegrate as you open up the packaging. Since the bars are also very sticky remain stuck to the rapper as they break apart so you are stuck having to pick off pieces of the bar from the inside of the wrapper (which is difficult because the wrapper is plastic not foil). I don't know if I got an old box of these or if they're all like this. Regardless I probably won't risk getting another box like the first.

review/text: I must admit I like them, and they are a healthy alternative to a candy bar.  But at about $1.50 each for a very small light bar, they're too expensive for most.  Honey, nuts, and a few pieces of dried fruit shouldn't cost that much.  A competitor may come along hopefully with a better value.

Refrigerating before eating may help, but may also lead to tooth loss.  These are my thoughts!

review/summary: Reminds me of Christmas time when I was a girl. . .
review/text: I couldn't believe my luck. This little nut bar was included in my variety pack of these yummy Kind bars that I had ordered from Amazon last month. The taste and texture of this nut bar is the exact same taste as the beloved "no bake fruit cake" that my Nana made us when I was a little girl back in the 50s and 60s. It must be the dates and the particular kind of nuts because it tickles my taste buds in just such a way as to send me back years ago. I thank you Kind bar makers as being genius in your combinations of ingredients. I love these things... Love, love, love. I have just recently made an order with Amazon for a box of 12 of these things... and just when I remembered a book I wanted and decided to add that to my order... gosh, well, I goofed up and I hope that Amazon figures it out for me just in time because if I get all 24 of these nut bars I am in real trouble. I will eat them till they're gone. So, please, cross my fingers Amazon does their usual magic and gets my order just right! I have been invited to "Like" them on my Facebook page, but then I don't go there often and... well, if I tell everyone, then they may become hard to find in the future... sorta like telling everyone where your favorite fishing hole is and then not being able to go there because it's so crowded.<br /><br />Computers are so picky!  I offered to write a review of a different flavor of this Kind bar and it told me that only one review per product per customer... but I could edit my review! So, here I am. Back again to further praise and describe what has become my favorite snack food. They are so filling though, you have to watch it because it becomes a meal substitute and then your friends think you're no fun cause you won't eat with them! You're already full! The protein in these bars make them ideal for trail food, however, if you don't have the teeth for nuts, stay away. This last bar I decided I'd praise is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TNANSO">KIND PLUS, Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate + Protein, Gluten Free Bars (Pack of 12)</a>. I found them in my local grocery store but they often run out and that's what sent me to Amazon for a check on their availability. Yum! Lucky me! So, I'm out. I ate all I ordered last month and I'm daydreaming of them right now. Should've ordered them a week ago so I wouldn't be out now. These dark chocolate bars are so delicious I can conjure up the taste and sensation right now because. . . now here's the heaven part of this daydream. . .they taste like Baby Ruth candy bars from when I would a youth!  Yum, yum, yum.<br /><br />Gotta love it, guilt free candy! But, wait, everyone, it is NOT guilt free if you make it an extra snack, but instead make it part of your meal planning day. The nutrition and calorie info is printed on each bar and if you buy them in the carton, then the info is even easier to read.

review/summary: Bars recently changed and are much worse!!
review/text: Shame on Nature Valley for trying to pull the wool over our eyes!  If you were a fan of these bars when they first came out, then be warned.  The recipe has changed and the bars are much different and NOT for the better.  Not only are they much smaller, they also contain far fewer nuts/fruit and the bar itself now has an airier consistency like the Rice Krispie's treat.<br /><br />How do I know all this?  I bought these bars on a regular basis from Costco and still had some leftover bars from the first batch and I was able to compare them side by side.  These were always my favorite hiking snack and now they aren't much better than every other bar out there.  I think Nature Valley will quickly regret its decision once they realize that their are a lot of unhappy customers.  I'd gladly pay a little extra if it meant keeping the bars the way they were.<br /><br />If you don't believe me then by all means buy them and judge for yourself.

review/summary: Great tasting, but not so healthy
review/text: I love these trail mix bars.  They are chewy, sweet and flavorful.  They taste a bit like a very chewy, very sweet Rice Krispie / oat bar.  The amount of almonds (nice that they are whole) was a bit sparse and the cranberries are sort of ground up - not so much like actual trail mix.  The amount of goodies in the bar does not really match the picture on the box, which shows many more almonds, cranberries and raisins than I actually found to be in the product (based on my eating 3 bars out of the package so far).  The bars are convenient to take "on the go".<br /><br />However, in my opinion, this product is masquerading as a "healthy" trail mix bar and should be considered more like a cookie or candy bar.  It has 14 grams of sugars per bar, which is 40% by weight, as another reviewer pointed out, and it is SWEET.  It also only has 1 gram of fiber per bar, so it is not so healthy in that respect.  That said, I still rate the NV Chewy Trail Mix Bars as 5 stars for the good taste, but I personally would choose a healthier product (with less sugar and higher fiber) for everyday eating or if I were actually bringing this on a hiking trip.<br /><br />The product I received has a slightly different list of ingredients than listed on the Amazon site at this time and has likely been reformulated to avoid the use of high fructose corn syrup, which has been under scrutiny lately.  This product contains high maltose corn syrup instead.<br /><br />List of ingredients from the box I received:<br />Whole Grain Oats, High Maltose Corn Syrup, Crisp Rice (Rice Flour, Sugar, Malt Extract, Salt), Sugar, Raisins, Almonds, Honey, Roasted Peanuts, Fructose, Sunflower Seed, Canola Oil.  Contains 2% or less of: Cranberries, Rice, Maltodextrin, Soy Lecithin, Salt, Natural Flavor, Baking Soda.  Mixed Tocopherols added to retain freshness.

review/summary: It's trail mix in bar form really, and Nature Valley has that right
review/text: Nature Valley has a pretty wide variety of granola bars to offer, but I've never had a chewy bar of their's until I had this Trail Mix kind. Mixed (although mostly positive) results ensued...<br /><br />Fruit, good. Nuts, good. Chewy, not that great. The consistency is quite sticky, and frankly a bit tough on your teeth. You shouldn't have to channel the force of a shark's bite to enjoy a granola bar.<br /><br />Consistency aside, the flavor is great. It has raisin and cranberry fruitiness to pair with almond and peanut nuttiness. And of course there are oats and rice. The fruit flavors aren't overly sweet and it's not like you're eating a handful of nuts either. It's trail mix in bar form really, and Nature Valley has that right. And with 25 grams of carbohydrates and 14 grams of sugar per bar, these would be good for outdoor activities demanding energy.

Be careful of biting into pecans, especially if you have any bonding or cosmetic work done on your teeth.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my two front teeth are capped, when biting into a pecan proved to hard, I bit off the hard piece with my side teeth. The package does say "chewy", but I didn't find them of chewy consistency.<br /><br />They are very, very sweet, due to the high corn fructose and honey,a little too sweet to be a favorite for me. Though I'm sure many people will favor them for the sweetness.<br /><br />Compared to Quaker's Simple Harvest which is just delicately sweetened and less hard,I'd choose the latter for myself. This only my feeling though.

The first two ingredients in the nutritional information are Oats and High Maltose Corn Syrup. This is not a fruit and nut bar. It is a grain bar with some fruit and nuts sprinkled in. There are far better products, including ones with almonds and fruits as the main ingredients, and with honey sticking the ingredients together instead of a boat load of corn syrup. I am completely dissatisfied and amazon doesn't offer returns on this product so save yourself some money and buy a better bar.

review/summary: Nature Valley: Why Did You Ruin a Good Thing?
review/text: I agree with another poster here that things have changed for the worse in the making of my previously favorite snack.  They are now sticky, gooey, and almost impossible to get out of the wrapper at room temperature without them breaking (or should I say "stringing") apart.  In other words, they are FAR too moist.  They are also a lot smaller than they used to be.  Amazingly, the calorie content has stayed the same, but I can't comment on the other (sugar, carbs) percentages of ingredients as I never really paid much attention before.  Why is it that Nature Valley just "didn't get it" when it comes to them having a good thing and leaving it alone? It would have been interesting to be a "fly on the wall" when they are sitting around the big table making these horrible decisions.

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: I'm a sucker for all natural products and all natural ingredients.  In fact, many of the products that I buy now are organic.  While not organic, these all natural trail mix bars from Nature Valley are wonderful.  No artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives are in these bars!  We do not need artificial crap in order to make food taste good.  Nature provides that itself!  I think that it's great having these kind of all natural products to choose from when it comes to snacks and eating healthy.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Good.  Not too sweet.
review/text: I was worried these would be very sweet, but they a good mix of salty/sweet - I think mostly just from the nuts and fruits.  Too bad my kids' new schools both no longer allow nuts of any kind.

review/summary: Great product, great price, great taste
review/text: I don't know why other people were complaining about it being too hard. I mean, it has nuts, and the nuts aren't the softest is the world, but nothing to be upset about. My only problems is that it gets a bit sticky on my hands, but besides that, best granola bars ever.

review/summary: Absolutely loved it. promo was great too
review/text: Finally purchased in bulk. The Nature valley promo was a great incentive to buy.  Product was received in timely fashion and we sure enjoy having them around. Getting ready to purchase some more.  Great after school snacks and encourages the kids to eat more nuts.

review/summary: Pretty good when you are hungry
review/text: The first thing you taste when you first bite into these bars is peanut. Then almond followed by berries.  I devour them in a minute.<br />I give them only 3-stars because there is too much High Fructose Corn Syrup in them.<br />My search for the perfect energybar continues !
