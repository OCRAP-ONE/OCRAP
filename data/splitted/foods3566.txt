review/summary: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea
review/text: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile.  I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you like chamomile tea, this is a good choice.

review/summary: THE BEST PEPPERMINT TEA EVER...!
review/text: I had to quit coffee cold turkey due to PCOS, and this tea is getting me through it.  It is recommended for females who have PCOS to drink approximately 6 cups a day for full benefits.  I was able to do just that with the Stash-Amazon subscription program.  I love it with a little non dairy creamer and sweet-n-low.  It has a wonderful aroma.  when you open the individual tea package, you can swell the wonderful peppermint aroma.  The other great thing is that Stash actually recommends that you double steep their bags (3-5 minutes).  I did at first, but I no longer do, I want a fresh bag every time. This is some great tea, and everyone who is around me when I drink it; always asks me what is that, it smells so good. I have went to other stores and tried to buy variations of peppermint / mint teas, and none of them even come close in comparrison to this tea.  it is a must buy!

review/summary: Great fruit tea!
review/text: Love Stash teas and love the value found here on Amazon.  I had been purchasing from the Stash website before finding the same products here at a much better price minus the fussy packaging.  If you like Stash teas, I recommend signing up for the auto delivery option which can be set for up to 6 months apart and reduces the price of the item.<br /><br />I tend to like white tea and the peach flavor is mild so I don't get that fake peach taste you find in some tea.  It's a good balance with the white tea.  I have a small 4 cup drip coffee maker and put 2 bags in the filter basket and about 2 T sugar in the carafe and end up with a few great cups of tea.

review/summary: Excellent Mint Green Tea
review/text: Once you've tried high quality tea, it's hard to go back to the free tea at your office. Stash is worth the extra money in my opinion. The tea is very "fresh" and not powder-y, like cheaper teas. I drink some variation of mint tea every day and this is one of my favorites. (Steven Smith teamakers is my very favorite, but it's much more expensive.) The 100 count box is generally not much cheaper than the 6-box pack, but I appreciate the convenience of less packaging.

review/summary: This was my favorite tea!
review/text: This was my favorite tea.  If you like Moroccan mint, you'll LOVE this.  The flavors are strong and perfect without a hint of bitterness, and it's organic to boot.  I especially love the spearmint.  Yum!<br /><br />The bags came squashed together and wrinkled badly, which is something to consider if you plan on serving these professionally or making gifts, but not a single bag out of the hundred was ripped.<br /><br />I say it "was" my favorite tea because it has lemongrass in it, and I have a food allergy to all grasses.  If you're allergic to wheat or have an environmental grass allergy, you may want to check with your allergist before buying a hundred of these.  The flavor can't be beat, but I'll be going back to brewing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D4F1QS">Stash Premium Decaf Premium Green Tea, Tea Bags, 100-Count Box</a> side-by-side with herbal mint tea whenever my allergies are flaring up.

review/summary: Very Tasty for a Decaf!
review/text: You can still get more flavor in a fully caffeinated green tea, but this is green, clean, and refreshing.  It is not at all bitter as long as you pull the tea bag out in 1-2 min, and it has forgiven longer steeps as well.  The flavor is warm and mellow with some grassy tones, but the grassy tones are not overwhelming.  Light, all-day tea that's good cold as well.  I'll sometimes put a bag into cold or room-temperature tea to flavor the water deliciously without adding heat to a summer day.<br /><br />I often mix this with other flavors to cut the caffeine in half, or mix it with other decaf flavors (like herbal mint) for variation.<br /><br />Be advised this box came with the tea bags smashed in pretty densely.  The quality wasn't compromised, but they would make for poor gifts and their resell appeal would take a hit.<br /><br />As with any 100-count box, I recommend picking up a single box of this at a local grocery store if you can before committing to so many.  It's available at most of my local grocery stores, and might be available at yours as well.

review/summary: Flavorful Tea with Hibiscus Flowers and Some Flavorings
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me---but everyone should know this in case they are allergic. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and don't mind a few additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />This 100 count box is an economical way to enjoy this tea; however, I would try it first in a smaller quantity to be sure before you go for bulk!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

I love it black with just a touch of agave nectar, though really it's quite a sweet tea and doesn't need any at all--but I have a bit of a sweet tooth.<br /><br />A note on packaging:  While it did not affect my overall rating, don't expect to be sent one of the large rectangular tea boxes in the picture.  My order came loose in a small cardboard outer box.  I'll have to take them on their word that it's 100 tea bags, because I'm not going to bother sorting and counting them!  Some of them are, as a result of being packed into a very tiny box, flattened and dog-eared.  If presentation for guests is important to you, you may want to rethink purchasing this bulk amount, and buy the individual boxes instead.

review/text: This product seemed like an excellent value for decaf English Breakfast tea.  Unfortunately it bears no relationship to any English Breakfast tea I have had in the past 40 years.  I will be returning to paying much more for Twinings.  This Stash product is considerably more like standard black tea than like English Breakfast tea, and if you want decaf black tea that is stronger than Lipton decaf, this is a good choice.  But if you were looking for a smooth, premium-quality English Breakfast tea, this is not it.

I am mixing it with PG Tips black tea to add a bit of strength and boldness.<br /><br />Very pleased and am thinking my 100 ct box will not last long!<br /><br />*****UPDATE*****<br /><br />The mint taste really tends to overpower the chocolate.  However, as I said originally, I mix it with black tea and it turns out pretty well.<br /><br />One thing we found we like to use instead of sweetener & milk, is to use Vanilla Eggnog to sweeten & cream.

review/text: Smooth and tasty--Caffeine free herbal tea-- 100% natural ingredients (in the order listed) are: peppermint, chamomile, spearmint, organic tulsi, lemongrass, guava flavor, cinnamon, and grapefruit flavor.<br /><br />As usual, each tea bag is sealed in its own foil package to keep the flavor inside and ready for you.  I use 1 bag per 24 oz hot water.<br /><br />This sounds like an unusual mix of flavors but it is quite tasty--kind of like a minty fruit.  This would also likely make an excellent ice tea.<br /><br />If you want to add a sweetener, I prefer a natural sweetener, such as agave cactus nectar (natural food isle of food store), or unbleached brown sugar (sugar isle) or honey.

review/text: I checked my past orders of the Stash brand Earl Grey Double-Bergamot tea. It seems I order about once every 8 months. This is now my 3rd order but the first time I bought it in bulk like this. The savings were minimal but worth it. I made sure to count all the bags to ensure a complete order was received. It was.<br /><br />I was surprised to find a video by someone who spoke of Earl Grey as a vile and disgusting tea. I love this tea. However, I have met people that I have offered a cup of this tea, and a few have mentioned it smelled like pepper to them. Bergamot, the predominant spice in this tea, is a citrus not unlike an orange whose oils are extracted for this tea. When I smell the tea, I smell a sweet aroma. If, when you smell this tea, it smells like pepper to you, you might first give it at least one sip before dismissing it. I typically put cream & sugar in my this.

review/summary: Great if you like Wintergreen
review/text: Although I do not care for this tea much, I still give it four stars. That is because it is the only tea I can force down that has wintergreen in it. I often buy teas that are a mixture of green and/or white tea with spearmint and/or peppermint. It was my fault I did not read the description carefully, as I did not realize it had wintergreen in it until I tasted it. You can definitely taste the wintergreen!<br />My favorite Stash teas are the White Christmas, (white tea, peppermint, & ginger), and the Moroccan Mint, (green tea, spearmint, lemongrass, & peppermint). I do the White Christmas if I want something a bit spicier and more warming, and I do the Moroccan mint when I want something a little smoother. Due to the lemongrass it does taste a bit grassy, but it's still good.<br /><br />If you want a good mint tea without green, try the Cascade mint. It just has peppermint and spearmint, and is absolutely delicious! I mix that with decaf green in the evenings and it's wonderful! Unfortunately, I have not found the Cascade mint in boxes of 100, so I usually stick with one of the other varieties mentioned above.<br />Bottom line, I have come to love most of the Stash tea flavors that contain mint, with the exception of the Merry Mint. Like I said though, I can kindof get it down, which is more than I can say about other teas with wintergreen in them. And these boxes of 100 are such a great value, as I drink several cups per day!

Thanks to the automatic ordering process that Amazon has, I only pay $11.99 for a box of 100 bags!!<br /><br />I feel like a pusher at work, when I go down to get the hotwater.  I give out a teabag or 2 and send the link to the product here at Amazon<br /><br />This is great tea, and a great buy!

review/summary: Flavorful
review/text: I'm a big fan of Stash teas, and this one has a particularly strong bergamot flavor for Earl Grey aficionados. Of course, the big cardboard box it arrives in isn't all that aesthetically pleasing, but if you drink a lot of tea it works out to be much less expensive than buying the 20-bag packages at the grocery store.

review/summary: Knew I liked the product, got what I expected
review/text: I wouldn't have ordered 100 of these teabags without trying them first, so I grabbed the smaller size box at my local grocery store. I'd been trying to drink more green tea and realizing my generous cubicle neighbor probably wanted to encourage my new habit, but not necessarily fund it by continuing to "donate" bags to me. I really liked the STASH green tea, so before my small box was up, I ordered this one. It is a delicious green tea to me, but as with many green teas, FINISH IT WHILE IT'S HOT. Seriously - if it cools down, it gets bitter. I thought the value of this box was excellent since I'm up to 1-3 cups per day, so this worked well. I posted a few pics of how the packaging came so you can see - no "retail" boxes, but they are each individually wrapped. Note that it just came in a cardboard box and the little packs inside weren't lined in a plastic bag, so if you have this delivered, just make sure it stays dry. I think a rainy day on my doorstep could have been messy, though I do think the tea bags are foil lined enough to prevent moisture from entering? Still, I wouldn't want to risk it! I've already added this to my Wish List entitled "re-stock items" :)

review/summary: Now This Is Good Tea
review/text: My first box of Stash Decaf Green Tea arrived about 15 mins ago and I'm sitting here enjoying my very first cup.  This is a really good cup of decaf green tea!!!!  I used water that had not quite starting boiling so as not to burn the tender tea.  Steeped it for 2 mins and added some Ambrosia raw unfiltered honey.  I bought both products via Amazon's "Subscribe And Save" so I saved an additional few dollars off their already low price.  Any subscribe and save purchase comes with free shipping even if the total order is less than $25.  Amazing savings and fantastic taste.  Sorry if I seem like an advertisement but I'm really excited.  Tea is sooo expensive in the grocery store so I saved a bundle and I'm drinking some of the best decaf green tea I've had in a while. Extremely smooth with no bitter after taste.

review/text: The stash teas are handy, with great flavor at a good price. I usually get wild raspberry. I got mango/passion fruit this time.<br />I just drop it in a mug O' room temp water, and keep topping it off as I drink it. It is naturally sweet enough for me- un adulterated. No caffeine, no sugar, and so pleasant. Handy in the foil packs, and simple packaging. The foil packs make it nice to put a couple in your pocket or pack, or give a few to a friend.

review/summary: Bitter and Astringent
review/text: I love most of Stash's green teas.  LOVE them.  Most of them are grassy and flavorful but lack the bitterness of many other brands of green.<br /><br />This is the exception.  Blech!  It is incredibly astringent, something even more common in Jasmine greens than in a straight green.  I recommend trying it from a grocery store before committing to a large Amazon purchase unless you happen to like bitter tea.  That sounds absurd to me, but I do have friends who prefer their tea with a bitter bite.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002P9D3GC">Yamamotoyama Jasmine Tea Bag</a> (which stash also sells, but I couldn't find it here) is flavorful but retains the mild, non-bitter green flavor I've come to know and love.

review/summary: Subtle, Delicate, Delicious
review/text: I *loved* this tea.  I am mostly alone in my love:  many of my friends and guests prefer stronger teas, and the flavor of this is anything but.  Even if you stack multiple bags in a single brew, you're going to end up with a subtle flavor.  That's most good white teas for you.  "Strong" white teas exist even though the phrase is something of a contradiction in terms, but they exist by layering on a lot of flavor that doesn't come from the tea leaf itself.  Those remind me of herbal teas even though they've thrown in a white tea base.  In this tea, the lemon flavor is as subtle as the white so that you can taste both.  I think it's heaven.<br /><br />This tea is more forgiving of an overly long steep than most white teas, but it's still a white tea and will go bitter if steeped too long.<br /><br />I find I dislike it as an iced tea and even once it reaches room temperature.  The oils separate out and form a film on top with trapped tea dust.  It won't hurt you, but it's very off-putting.<br /><br />To enjoy a cooler beverage, I put a teabag or two directly into room temperature or cold water.  It lends a little flavor to the water without giving up a film of yuck to float on top.  I love doing this with any good green tea, and just a very few whites.  It adds a subtle yum, like a delicate natural flavored water.<br /><br />Alas, this has lemon grass in it.  This is good news for most people:  lemon grass is delicious!  It's also a grass, though.  If you have wheat or grass allergies, discuss lemongrass with your allergist and pay attention to how you feel on days you consume it.  I like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D4IVGU">Stash Premium Decaf White Raspberry Tea, Tea Bags, 100-Count Box</a> just as much as I like this, so I've switched over to avoid that little extra bit of stuffiness from consuming a grass product.

review/summary: Flavorful Product but Gianormous Packaging
review/text: I agree with the previous reviewer that the packaging of these grilled eggplants is a bit overwhelming, but there are other, smaller packages available (from the same manufacturer) that make removing the eggplant slices easier. And they are delicate, but that's what grilled eggplant is, and if you are careful, the pieces will remain intact. Having said that, this is a premium product -- sliced, grilled, and VERY flavorful -- perhaps too flavorful for a baba but perfect for veggie-based sandwiches or flatbread pizzas. The oil is there for preservation purposes, I imagine. And the price is right for the amount you get and the quality of the product, as long as you keep the above recommendations in mind. I used to be able to get this stuff in my grocery store and people would rave when I would use it, and now this is the only way I can obtain it so I am writing this review in hopes that it doesn't go away!

review/text: These don't taste awful although they aren't particularly flavorful.  The package is a thin flat tray covered with adhered plastic, containing thin slices of eggplant in a lot of oil.  It looks like you could remove the eggplant slices whole; however this is really impossible; it just all falls to bits upon removal.  So, these won't go to waste if you want to make something like baba ganoosh; but otherwise I don't see the point in buying these rather than just canned eggplant.

review/text: ....these are too chocolatey.  How could such a thing be?  I really have no idea.  I can't even figure out exactly what it is about these that I dislike for that reason.  First, I will say that they are very definitely chocolatey so you aren't going to get short-changed there.  I guess my issue is that, with this type of cookie, part of the concept is having a contrast between the outer cookie and the inner filling.  There is some difference here still, but overall it's just a major hit of chocolate.  These remind me of a chocolate truffle with cookie bits in it, only inside-out.  And as much as I love chocolate, I've never much cared for truffles for the same reason - just too much of a bomb all at once.  I dislike dark chocolate and prefer milk chocolate, so maybe that's my problem.<br /><br />So anyway - this commentary possibly having really sold you on these, I will affirm that they are a fine product  - always fresh, crispy, etc.  Just be warned!

review/summary: What Happened?  Prices and Subscribe and Save?
review/text: I've been enjoying Jet Fuel for 18 months now - and mostly enjoy the other flavors from the Coffee People - but in the last 2 weeks the prices have skyrocketd (up $5 a box), and most of these are no longer available for subscribe and save (another $3-4 increase).  Gives me a pause to whether this k-cup thing is even worth it.  The good cups went from 35 cents a cup or so, to now over 50 CENTS!

review/text: I am experiencing the exact same thing as "soccer9". About every 5th cup of "Jet Fuel" is full of grounds. I usually buy Timothy's "Dark Magic" because I like bold coffee, and I'm kicking myself for trying "Jet Fuel". No more Coffee People coffee for me! I'm sticking with Timothy's!

review/summary: Perfect cup in the morning
review/text: I do not like most of the light or medium blends (I get a cup of coffee that is too week from my Keurig); and some of the darker roasts just give the same week cup of coffee with really bitter aftertaste.<br />The "Jet Fuel" is completely different type of coffee. It gives me exactly what I want in the morning. Since it is "Extra Bold", it has more body than just a darker roast (it is really strong, but does not have too much bitter or burned aftertaste). It is also available in large packages (24 and 50).

review/text: I'm not someone who needs incredibly strong coffee, but after we received a Keurig as a wedding gift, basically every pack of K-cups we bought seemed really weak.  After a bit of reading, this seems to be a somewhat common complaint.  The Jet Fuel packs are the first ones we actually think taste like coffee.  I'll definitely be buying more.

review/text: We have enjoyed Jet Fuel Dark Roast many times.  We love the full flavor and the aroma is very coffee like, kind of along the lines of a strong expresso.  The flavor is earthy, strong and has a full flavor like you would expect from a dark roast.  It is not overbearing as far as the flavor and I find it is good with many different creamers.  The smell is what you notice first but the taste is something you can't forget.  If you like strong coffee that is rich and aromatic then try Jet Fuel, you will not be disappointed.
