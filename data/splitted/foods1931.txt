review/summary: Good Product Bad Packeting
review/text: I was happy to get my coffee. Me without coffee is like a baby without her sippy cup! I tore the box open and my heart sank. The individual K-Cups were just thrown around. The bottom of the box had a good amount of coffee grinds. I don't think the post office is responsible for the mishap because the box didn't appear damaged. The only logical explanation is the damage originated where the K-Cups were loaded into the box. Five out of the 50 K-Cups were unusable. If you don't think 10 percent is a big deal, then imagine going on a blind date and your blind date answers the door and you notice he/she is missing 10 percent of his/her teeth! See, 10 percent is a lot. Bottom line, I'm not ordering K-cups on-line anymore. I guess I'll just get of my butt and head down to the store. It will be worth the extra expense.<br /><br />Arthur M.

review/summary: Not what I ordered!
review/text: I ordered decaf hazelnut k-cups from Gloria Jean (that's what I clicked on) what came in the mail was non-decaf (regular) I cannot drink regular coffee. I was dismayed to see they were not returnable. If it were not for Amazon's wonderful policy (they refunded me anyway!) I would be stuck with coffee I could not use. This is why I order 90% of my online purchases from Amazon. I will go back to Paul Newman decaf k-cups. They arrive as ordered.

We've tried other flavors from Gloria Jean's Coffees, and we have been satisfied with all of them so far.  We keep our K-Cups on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JD3C9E">Keurig 5060 K-Cup Carousel, Chrome</a> so we're okay that the K-Cups ship in this box.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Where's the Bergamot?
review/text: I was hoping to like this tea as I love Earl Grey and some green teas and thought this would have more health benefits than the normal Earl Grey. I couldn't taste any bergamot to speak of in this tea. Also, even though I love Twinings Earl Grey and some green teas such as Celestial Seasonings Mandarin Orchard, Salada, and others, I did not like combining the two. It was like I could not taste what was good about either teas in this and will now keep my black teas and my green teas separated from each other so that I can taste what is good about each in it's own way. Also, I've found the Bigelow's that I've tried so far to be rather flat and lacking any of the delicacy or subtle complexities of many other brands.

review/text: I'm a big fan/drinker of Green Tea and a big fan/drinker of Earl Grey, but this tea is a little too Bergamot-y for my taste. It may be because plain green tea naturally has a weaker taste than black tea, and the Bergamot is therefore more evident.<br /><br />After a couple cups of this I decided these two tastes are best on their own.

review/summary: Great taste, fun to chew, strong scientific backing for health claims of Xylitol
review/text: After using an "all-natural" gum (that contained cane sugar) and getting my first cavity in 12 years after 6 months of use, I knew I needed a switch. I heard about Xylitol from a naturopathic student, that basically, the bad bacteria in your mouth feed on Xylitol but they can't digest it, and the good bacteria can eat it, so they proliferate. I thought I had tried other Xylitol gums in the past and didn't like them, but I decided to give this another chance because I want a gum to chew after meals that is actually good for my teeth. I was pleasantly surprised at the Spry gum! It has a great flavor (which goes away pretty soon after chewing, but it's a nice shot of good taste), but the best part is that the gum itself has a great texture to it and continues to be fun to chew for as long as you want. It doesn't even turn hard after drinking water like most gums do. I am a medical student so I did a search of the research literature and the claims of Xylitol are more than proven. However, all of the literature and research studies explain that you need 4-12 g of Xylitol a day (no need to get more than 15), but the average piece of gum has .75-1 g, so you'll need to chew at least 4-5 pieces a day to get the dental benefits (chewing it only sporadically, i.e. once a day, did NOT show any dental benefits). No problem for me, I chew one after every meal (I have 5-6 a day), and love having the fresh clean feeling as well as knowing that I'm doing something great for my teeth.

review/summary: Helps to Reduce Cavities
review/text: After chewing one piece of Spry peppermint gum you may notice your teeth and gums feeling more healthy. Since I'm always looking for natural alternatives to regular processed sugar as an ingredient, this item caught my attention.<br /><br />Not only does Xylitol not promote tooth decay, it has natural ingredients to decrease plaque formation and adhesion. Xylitol is a naturally occurring 5-carbon sugar alcohol found in many fruits including plums, strawberries and raspberries. Our bodies actual produce about 11g of Xylitol a day.<br /><br />It can be commercially manufactured from "xylan hemicellulose" sources such as Birch trees in Finland. Some Xylitol products are also made from corn.<br /><br />This product is made with a Xylitol, gum base, natural flavors, glycerin, gum Arabic, soy lecithin and beesewax.<br /><br />Xylitol actually has been proven to:<br /><br />Reduce Tooth Decay<br />Prevent Cavities by inhibiting the growth of bacteria<br />Inhibits the growth of a related species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a cause of ear infections<br />Reduce the secretion of Plaque Acids<br />Facilitate the Remineralization of Tooth Enamel<br /><br />What more could we ask for from a gum? This gum is a natural defense system and you will start to notice the results. Unlike other sugary gums, this will reduce cavities and it is just as flavorful, if not more so than most gums.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: This is a great product
review/text: I tried to find chewing gum at my local supermarket that did NOT contain aspartame, or some other man-made sugar substitute.  I never was able to.  I checked my local health food store and they sell Spry gum and Spry toothpaste.  The gum is just as good tasting as any major brand, and it doesn't hurt my stomach.  It doesn't become ultra sticky like major brand gum either, so I can give it to my 3-year-old and 1-year-old without worry.  The flavor doesn't last too long, but chewing it is good for your teeth, so I don't have a problem going through it quicker than major brand gum.  One of the best parts - it's cheaper than major brand gum.  I get a pack of 10 for $0.89 from my local food store.  The others cost $1.10 at the supermarket.<br />I also tried their toothpaste and I love it.  I use it everyday.  It's safe for my little ones too.  It says right on the label that there's nothing to worry about if the toothpaste is swallowed, because it is not harmful since the product is fluoride-free and all natural.  I highly recommend Spry products - especially for families.

review/text: Being a gum addict, I go through a pack a day. Sugar does a number on your teeth, so I prefer sugar-free... or I did, until I read how many cancer causing ingredients the leading gum brands have. You might as well smoke ;-). That's where SPRY comes in... made with Xylitol, a natural sugar derivative (and not `natural' like Splenda) it has a long lasting flavor and good texture. The only problem I ran into is that the consistency degrades after about 30 minutes of chewing.<br /><br />All in all, for a 30 min gum fix, Spry is #1.

review/summary: Not Gluten Free enough...
review/text: Even though there is a statement right on the front of these packages of gum that claims "Gluten Free", I don't believe this gum really is.  I bought a pack of Peppermint from the health food store that my daughter and I both chewed (we are GF/Celiac) and we BOTH reacted to this gum.  We both tried it again a few days later, thinking perhaps it was something else we had eaten, considering this gum says Gluten Free right on the front.  The reaction was WORSE the second time around!!!  This company sources their Xylitol from China, and almost all the companies I looked at online that you can purchase Xylitol from also make lots of Wheat Gluten----so I am assuming some sort of cross contamination at the source of production in China, for which this Spry company does not test for!  They are obviously just assuming that the product is 'naturally' gluten free and taking unreliable China's word for it----at the expense of customers with Celiac disease who get sick from this product.  Very disappointed.

review/summary: Loses flavor FAST; most likely not worth it
review/text: Ever since Trident White changed their "formula" to create a better flavor (which I do not care for at all), I've been on the search for a newer, better sugar-free gum. My dentist recommended Spry, so I thought I'd give it a chance. It's pricier than most of the sugarfree gums I frequent, but it came recommended by an oral expert, so I figured it would be worth a try.<br /><br />NOT WORTH IT.<br /><br />Literally, after less than 4 minutes, the flavor is completely gone, and the gum itself reverts to a stale, slightly metallic, tough-to-chew state of existence. I'm not sure how much teeth cleaning the Xylitol in the gum itself is doing because it seems to lose flavor so fast. Correct me if I'm wrong, but xylitol is a sweetener, so if the sweetness of the gum is lost after a good (or bad?) 3 minutes, then there really wasn't that much Xylitol to begin with?<br /><br />Also, further research showed that you actually need more xylitol than the amount in the gum itself before it proves to be beneficial.<br /><br />Given how much xylitol is in the Spry gum, it's neither good nor bad to be chewing Spry, and what tips that balance towards "No Thanks" is the fact that it is not worth its value.<br /><br />This is USEFUL information for those who want to chew gum to freshen their breath, or prolong the feeling of minty goodness in their mouth for more than just a couple of minutes!

It hasn't worked too well for me.<br /><br />I do like the spearmint flavor, but it only lasts for a few minutes. (After that it has kind of a chemical flavor that doesn't taste good.)  I do like chewing this gum after meals; it works great to freshen things up.<br /><br />This gum feels really small in my mouth.  Maybe two pieces would be better?<br /><br />BUY THIS: if you want to freshen your breath after meals, if you only want to chew gum for a couple minutes, and maybe if you want to share gum with kids (since the xylitol is better than sugary gums and artificial sugars are pretty scary).<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS: if you want to chew your gum for very long.

review/summary: Flavor doesn't last
review/text: I was looking for a gum with xylitol and found lots of good reviews on this one. It has more xylitol than some other gums, such as Trident.<br /><br />Overall, it's just OK. I'll finish off what I purchased, but I'll also be looking at other gums with xylitol.<br /><br />After chewing for a few seconds, I noticed the gum feels very small, which makes it less satisfying to chew. As a comparison, the tiny Trident gum I used to chew felt almost twice as large in my mouth as this Spry gum. Not a huge deal, but if you have a large mouth, you may need/want to chew two pieces at a time, which increases the cost.<br /><br />Good:<br />Contains more xylitol than some other gums, such as Trident.<br />Good flavor (while it lasts).<br /><br />Not so great:<br />Flavor lasts less than 30 seconds. Still tastes ok after flavor is gone.<br />Individual piece of gum seems very small after chewing.

review/summary: Just OK ... For Xylitol, I recommend Ice Breakers Ice Cube instead ...
review/text: If it wasn't for dentally beneficial ingredient Xylitol in this gum, this gum would be 2 stars.  The gum was small; had to chew two to get the same size feel as National brand sugarless gums. The flavor faded quickly and had slightly bitter after taste.<br /><br />If you want gum with Xylitol, Ice Breakers Ice Cube in any flavor is the gold standard in my book.

review/text: I am not going to review why Xylitol is great or beneficial. I am not going to comment on the effects of chewing gum to reduce cavities, lose weight, catch the eye of the person on the subway you are attracted to, or eliminate planters warts on the bottoms of your feet. I will not go into the wonders of this gum, and how I keep packs in my desk at work, in my car, and under my pillow for those late night cravings.<br /><br />However, I will state that this is a great price to pay for twenty packs of this gum. In the stores, this gum runs about $2 a pack. The price I paid through Amazon is less than 75 cents per pack. I no longer have to feel guilty when I take that second piece because sometimes one piece just isn't enough.<br /><br />This is a great, guilt free, chemical free, wonderful tasting and long lasting gum. If there were just some way to harness the power from gum chewers' jaws into a clean energy...

review/summary: fresh and good flavor
review/text: I got the gum because my dentist recommended it to keep cavities at bay. It arrived quickly and was in good condition. The gum was fresh and had a good cinnimon flavor. The intense flavor didn't last any longer than most gum. I'm chewing it after meals when I am not near a toothbrush and during the day when I would normally reach for a snack. So far I have no complaints but I have not been to a dentist to see if there is a difference in my teeth condition.

review/summary: Great Deal and Good for You!
review/text: This gum contains xylitol, a sugar that the "good" bacteria in your mouth like, so they can thrive and can help you avoid cavities. One piece chews down pretty small and loses its flavor fairly quickly but I only chew it to clean my mouth. It does its job and this pack is a good deal because you would find 1 pack for .99$ in stores.

review/summary: Eliminates bad breath, tastes great, handy packaging
review/text: I was researching dental health one day and found lots of evidence proving how great xylitol is for oral health and teeth (although it is deadly for dogs so beware of leaving it lying around and don't litter!  Unfortunately, over the counter gums have other ingredients that counteract or nullify xylitol's positive effects.<br /><br />Spry is a great example of a gum that is really pure in its delivery of xylitol.  If you get into the habit of chewing a piece or two after you eat (I prefer chewing two pieces at a time to extend the flavor) it's meant to eliminate the bad bacteria in your mouth and prevent acidic foods from doing damage, leading to staining and cavities on your teeth.  Plus, Spry is very inexpensive!<br /><br />An added benefit I noticed is that it increases salivation, which is very good for me since I am prone to having a somewhat dry mouth.<br /><br />I love the peppermint flavor- this gum doesn't give you an aftertaste and leaves my mouth and breath fresher than they've ever been in my life. I agree with other reviewers that the gum does lose the majority of flavor after a few minutes of chewing, but it's not unpleasant until about 30 minutes into chewing, which is better for your jaw anyway. I have not had any abdominal discomfort at all from chewing this gum.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product

Sugar sweetened gum will degrade your dental health if you are a constant gum chewer like me. I just hope they don't find out something seriously wrong with xylitol down the road. ;)

review/summary: Good, but could last longer.
review/text: I'm a gum fanatic, but usually I'm used to the sugary versions, or else the very minty alternatives.  I'm trying Spry for the first time, and I think it's a fantastic gum, but I feel the flavor runs out very quickly, and it also comes in very small portions.  The packaging is also frustrating, because I'm used to pushing into the tab for the gum to come out, but the packet that actually holds the gum is small compared to the sleeve, so you have to shake it out.

review/text: I like Spry because I know it's good for me, but the gum size is meager, and the flavor, while good, doesn't last long. So I pop in two pieces at a time and just enjoy it while I can. I kind of assume that the reason it doesn't last is because it doesn't have a lot of the nasty chemicals in it to preserve it, so I am willing to accept the tradeoff for better health!

review/text: This product has xylitol in it and its useful/good for your teeth, I get it. But, at the end of the day I chew gum to freshen my breath up. The flavor of Spry lasts only for 3-5 minutes. Then you are basically chewing on flavorless gum. You need to chew atleast 2 at a time to feel the flavor. This product might be good for your teeth if used extensively but honestly I think its overrated. You will do as well with any sugarless gum like Trident, which has xylitol too and lasts much longer. Not to mention that its expensive too as compared to Trident or any other sugarless alternatives.

review/summary: These Treats Are Winners At Our House!
review/text: We have tried all sorts of treats at our house...or at least my dog tries them. I just buy them. He loves all of the assorted flavors Three Dog Bakery makes. He has his favorites, but all of them meet with his approval. We will continue to buy these.<br /><br />There is one that looks like a "people" cookie. That's his favorite. They all smell good, even to me. My dog gets one of these 'cookies' every morning. We call them "Good Morning Biscuits" and he gets one right before bedtime, a "Good Night Biscuit." It's like the period on the end of the day for him. He doesn't feel ready to go to bed until he gets his "Good Night Biscuit." He gets restless and whiney until I remember that it's his bedtime. He goes outside for a minute, comes back in, gets that treat-- any one of the Three Dog Bakery treats will do -- and then he is calm and content as he climbs into his bed and goes to sleep.<br /><br />These treats make my life easier with my demanding (loved/spoiled rotten) dog who gets even more treats as he shows definite signs of aging.

review/text: 3 dog bakery offers products that I'm comfortable giving my dog, assured they're made with quality and safe ingredients.  I've even sampled these biscuits that look more like a small cookie-they're good and Angel loves them.  She gets 3 Itty Bitty Bones first but makes it clear "treat" time is not over until she's had her dessert, after which she curls up, totally content.  I'm doing much better at not giving her people food for treats and her constitution thanks me, too.

review/summary: My dog loves them!
review/text: I randomly bought these because they were well priced and sounded like something different for my dog. She's a toy poodle weighing about 9 pounds.<br /><br />Well, they are larger than I thought they would be. Being called "bitty bites", I thought they'd be pretty small. For my dog, I tear them into 4-5 pieces and only give her about half of one at a time. It's not a problem, because they tear apart very easily. But still, I would only call them "bite sized" for at least a 30 pound dog.<br /><br />She really loves them though! I call them her "special cookies", and she's quickly learned what those words mean. As soon as I reach for the box, she'll whine and spin around in circles until I give her one. They're cheap, they're natural, and apparently they're good. I'll definitely be buying them again.<br /><br />I noticed some reviews on these cookies complain about them containing hydrogenated oil. I thought I would mention that it's only the Carob Chips that contain this oil, not the cookies themselves. Being that there are very few of these chips in the cookies, I wouldn't let it scare you away from giving these to your dog!

review/text: I would say that these treats are average.  I like how they use the term "ultra premium quality."  Whatever that means!  These treats are very oily and have the consistency of shortbread cookies.  Very soft and crumbly.  Yes the dogs love them, but I think I'll get something else next time.

The strawberry ones were  really good and so are the chocolate.  It's a pretty chocolaty taste, similar to a lot of the chocolate cereals but better.  Everyone in house likes these a lot, from 5 year old to teens to grandma.

You can get about three-four small handfuls of mini crisps.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the price has increased dramatically since I last purchased them. I purchased them when they were about $14 for a four pack; now it's $25 + shipping. Not a good deal anymore.

review/summary: Results You Can See, and FAST!
review/text: This may be the best product I've come across in 25 years of owning and loving American Staffordshire Terriers! I haven't been using them all that long, so I reserve the right to change my mind :-)<br /><br />After just a couple or three weeks of giving two of these tabs a day to my male and female 7 month old puppies and 3 year old males and female adult AmStaffs, the results are impossible to ignore! There is definitely new muscle being added to their bodies, and let me tell you it looks good! I can't wait to see what a few months of this will do for them!<br /><br />We wanted to see if it was the BullyMax for sure or maybe something else, so we discontinued for a month, and guess what happened? The muscle growth slowed back down to what you'd expect for 7 month old pups and pretty much stopped for my adult dogs! They're all back on them now, and not only are they gaining muscle again, but their coats look great, their energy levels and stamina are even better than before, their appetites have improved, and they even seem to be sharper cognitively, with greater attention spans and increased patience! They were doing well in all those areas before I started using BullyMax, but as I said, there is an improvement over their already impressive baseline for all these attributes that can't be denied.<br /><br />They're a little pricey, but from what I've seen, they're worth it. I hope my review helps to inform you as you decide if these are right for your four-legged best friend(s). Peace :-)

review/text: It's OK. Like many decaf teas, has a somewhat fishy odor. It's certainly not as prominent as pu-erh; there's a faint floral hint but the brew is weak, not the bright vibrant tones that you would expect a Ceylon tea to have (the box says "imported" so the tea probably not indigenous to Sri Lanka). The best phrase I can use to describe it is "insipid". There are many better black teas out there.

review/summary: He Likes It.
review/text: Our 11-month-old boy is going through his teething stage (4 uppers and 2 lowers, so far). We're now feeding him a mixture of foods some of which we get in the store and some of which we make ourselves. Some of his foods just come off of our plates. One of the store products we use are the Gerber 2nd Foods meats. They come in chicken, beef and lamb. For some reason our boy doesn't particularly like like the chicken, so we've mostly used the beef and lamb. The lamb is harder to find.<br /><br />I'm amazed at how fast the kid will go through baby food. We seem to be running to the store all the time. Well, this time, in order to simplify my life somewhat, I just got a 12-jar pack. This helps. He likes it, so there will be no problem with ending up with a bunch of stuff he won't eat. Plus we supplement it with a variety of other foods. Personally, I'd rather feed him more of the stuff we prepare ourselves, but our lives are just too complicated.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Tastes good
review/text: Honeysuckle Pear is one of three flavors of Drink Chia. I personally like the Strawberry and Mango more, but this one still tastes good. Some of my friends like this one more than the others. They only have 40 calories and 4 grams of sugar, and contain lots of Omega 3 (880mg!!), Omega 6, iron, potassium, calcium, fiber, protein, magnesium...they are extremely healthy.  This is all from the chia seeds you can see inside, which gives it a texture that is new and fun to drink. The seeds themselves absorb more than ten times their weight in water, so when you drink them they hold onto it, keeping you hydrated longer. Great for workouts and sports. It's all in an 8oz bottle so it's easy to carry in a bag or in your hand wherever you go.

review/summary: Delicious and nutritious
review/text: This is the strawberry-citrus flavor of the Drink Chia line and it tastes great. Some chia drinks are thick and almost smoothie-like, but Drink Chia is as light as tea. Filled with chia seeds, vitamin B, and only having 40 calories and 4g of sugar, this beverage is extremely healthy for you and great for on-the-go nutrition.<br /><br />The seeds add a different texture than most drinks, but the seeds naturally gel and chug down very smoothly. Most of the time I don't even notice them. It's the seeds themselves that lock in their sugar and water until you ingest them, and then slowly release them for sustained endurance and hydration. They are loaded with fiber, calcium, protein, magnesium, and more. Just look up chia seeds and you'll see for yourself.<br /><br />If you have a choice between those insanely sugary drinks and juices, or over-caffeinated beverages, or Drink Chia...go with this one. Your body will thank you for it.

The seeds naturally gel in liquid so they also go down smooth, and once ingested the gel slowly releases the sugar and water so you get sustained energy and hydration whether you're running, biking, or working out. Best of all it manages to do all this without caffeine, sodium, or preservatives. All natural. Really remarkable, you gotta try it.

review/text: So I will confess, I really feel better and more energized on less sleep when I drink one of these, but this particular brand tastes unbelievably bad.  As if it had aspartame in it, though it does not list it in the ingredients.  I've tried another Chia drink (different brand) and it was lip-smackingly delicious, so I will surely not buy any more of these.  Also, the other brand (found at Whole Foods - I'll update the name when I remember) costs about the same or less for 10oz vs the 8oz of this one.

review/summary: Terrible, dog acted strange and poor ingredients
review/text: I had a terrible experience with this food.  I had fed my large Golden Retriever Science Diet adult food for most of his life, then when he was around 6 years old, gradually transitioned him to this light kind because he was getting overweight.  He was nuts while eating it!  I used to feed him 3-4 cups of his old food...I was feeding him 4-5, to eventually even 6 cups, of this kind and he was constantly seeming hungry, stealing our human food aggressively, acting just agitated throughout the day, and constantly at his food bowl asking for something.  He wolfed the food down, but not the way he does with fresh chicken or something he loves...in a really voracious, agitated way, like he was starved.<br /><br />I started learning how to read the ingredients label and I couldn't believe what I was feeding him.  I was a loyal Science Diet customer because of the vet recommendations, blah blah.  Now I walk past the whole Science Diet aisle and don't trust the vet recommendations.  My new, more independent vet said Science Diet funds the vet schools quite heavily and so they are constantly being "taught" how good it is by Science Diet reps.  The high price you pay is for their advertising and donations to the schools, not for quality dog food.<br /><br />I learned that dogs have short digestive tracts meant for digesting meat.  They are not made to eat tons of grain!  Read the ingredients again: Corn meal, soybean mill run, chicken by-product meal , peanut hulls, corn gluten meal, soybean meal, etc.  I didn't know this before researching more, but most of this is just absolute junk- leftover products from processing human foods, products with basically no nutrients and just take up space.  Freebies for Science Diet probably because they have little value anywhere else.  This list also includes just about ALL the problem foods dogs get allergies to- corn, gluten, soybeans.  Soybean mill run, peanut hulls, corn gluten meal, and soybean meal are basically junk dogs should not eat.  They cannot digest it!  So, my dog was constantly hungry and not getting the nutrients he needed.<br /><br />I cannot believe I trusted Science Diet for so many years paying a premium price for this stuff!  I am still mad about it!  Now I skip all the fluffy, absolutely unregulated stuff companies write on the front of the bag and go right to the ingredients list.<br /><br />Anyway, I feed my dog Merrick now.  I definitely WOULD NOT do this light stuff from Science Diet.  Check out the dog food adviser website for pretty useful rankings on dog food...science diet was 1/5 or 2/5 stars for quality, I don't remember.  They said something like "cheap stuff for a premium price."

review/summary: recommended by my vet and my dog!
review/text: My vet recommended this for my Bernese Mountain Dog and it helps keep his weight down and his joints healthy.  I tried switching once to a dogfood that claimed to be healthier, but he started vomiting, which he had never done before, so I switched him back and he has been fine ever since.  (I did switch him slowly over a two week timeframe; it is not recommended to suddenly switch dogfoods on your pet because it can upset their tummies.)

review/text: Yum, yum and yum. Please prepare yourself for the world of lemon and delight. I have always enjoyed the wonderful taste and flavor of these cookies. Pamper yourself today, and eat carrots and non fat yogurt tomorrow.
