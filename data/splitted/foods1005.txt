review/summary: Heed the Warnings
review/text: I saw that there were more than the expected number of reviews here from people saying their cat(s) wouldn't eat this.  But 1.) none of my four cats are very finnicky when it comes to food, and 2.) they are used to grain free dry food, since I have fed them either Innova EVO or Blue Wilderness for the past 8 years.<br />This was the only grain-free dry available through Prime, and the ingredient list looked excellent, so I gave it a try.  Four cats...all hate it.  I tried to gradually blend it in with their other food to switch them over.  They ate around it.  When i finally offered them nothing but this, they wouldn't eat.  I caught the 2 boys eating from the dog's dish.<br />So...We're back to Blue Wilderness. If you've never tried Wellness Core Grain-Free Dry Adult cat food, heed the warnings!  I sure wish I had.  I have a friend who feeds strays, I guess I'll donate this.<br />I gave it 2 stars instead of one because in theory, it's high quality nutritious food.  And I liked the packaging - the bag has a resealable ziplock, unlike the other foods I buy.  I wish the company could do something to improve the flavor.... I would definitely revisit this food then.

review/summary: Maybe for kittens
review/text: I did a lot of research and decided to buy this food for my 4-year-old cat. I had been feeding him Royal Canin but he got fat, so I was hoping this food--without fattening grains--would help with that. (Side note: I only feed him a little bit at a time, he doesn't eat that much. But he still got fat.) When I got this and mixed it in with his old food, he didn't eat it at all, or even consider it. I'm not sure if it's because it's new, or because the kibble size is very small. It falls out of his mouth. Also, compared to the other food, it doesn't not smell very attractive (to a cat, I assume). I can barely smell it at all. While I like that, my cat doesn't seem to think it's food. He did eat some last night, but he still meows at me for the other food when I try to give this to him. He picks out his old food if I mix the two. If only they could make it smell better somehow while keeping out bad ingredients, and make an adult version (bigger kibble size), then I think this would be the best food (based on ingredients).

review/summary: They won't eat it...
review/text: I'm sure this is, scientifically, a healthy diet for cats. Unfortunately, one of my cats will only eat it very reluctantly, and the other one I think would sooner starve to death rather than eat this food. The end result is I am stuck with a bag of food that my cats won't eat, even if I mix it with wet food or another brand of dry food. For me, this stuff was a huge waste of money.

review/summary: Our vet recommended, and we feel it's worth the $$$$
review/text: Though this may not be the diet you can afford to buy if you have a large number of cats, we feel it is a great food for our one cat.  Our vet recommended it when we were looking for a good diet for our new 10 week old kitten.  There were a number of natural foods and raw meat options and we chose this food and have been very happy with it.  No preservatives, meat byproducts, grain, etc.  Just a great source of protein and natural food for your cat.  I will definitely attest that the oils in this food definitely make for a beautiful coat as our cat has fur like an alpaca.  Very, very silky.  The food smells a bit more than I remember dry food smelling, but no big deal there.  Overall, we are very happy with this food.  It is pricier by far than supermarket brands, but we feel that good food is a must.  Our vet helped us care for our other cat through her last several years of her life up until she was 22 and often gave us homeopathic and natural remedies for her and we felt well counseled and will continue to try to take a more natural course with our new addition, so hopefully she will also live a long and healthy life.  Good food is worth the money for an animal that brings so much joy to your life!

review/summary: Peace of mind and happy cats, it doesn't get better
review/text: I did a lot of research when we were getting our kittens, and this is the best dry food I could find. The Ingredients list is nearly ideal, and the reviews I read were all extremely positive. When we got our two little Norwegian Forest Cats, the breeder had been feeding them a mix of Eukanuba and Royal Canin. We switched them over to Wellness Core and they barely needed a transition. They have been on Wellness Core, along with Purina Pro Plan canned food, from the time they were 5 months when we got them, until now (a year next month), and if anything they like the food too much! We took one to the vet because she looked like she was having slight joint problems, and the vet informed us she was just overweight. We've had to cut their intake and they're both doing great now.<br /><br />Both our girls love this food and climb over each other as soon as the bowl hits the ground, and I feel very confident feeding them this, knowing it is among the healthiest choices I can make on their behalf. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Celiac-friendly
review/text: I'm not normally one for writing reviews since normally other people cover my own concerns or praises in their own. However, one of the big reasons I switched my cats to this food was that it was grain-free. My fiance and I both have Celiac and the wheat that is present in a lot of other foods was making *us* sick. I have had no issues handling this food, and my cat LOVES to lick my fingers. The cats love the food (you should see how excited they get in the morning when we open the bin), their fur is incredibly soft, they are energetic, and it doesn't make us sick.

review/summary: Cats would rather starve!
review/text: This was the first high quality, grain free food that I went to after finding out about the junk that goes into Science Diet.  I did a slow transition to this food of ~2 weeks and as the Wellness brand was becoming the more dominant food, the less I found myself having to fill up the bowls.<br /><br />Finally, after 2 weeks and my cats not eating so much, I did a test.  I left out a full bowl of Science Diet and a full bowl of Wellness.  For 3 days, the Wellness bowl didn't get touched.  I thought, "hey, I'll just make Wellness their only choice."  Good idea, right?  Nah.  They just didn't eat, literally!<br /><br />I have since swapped to Innova Evo which is just as good a food as Wellness and my cats LOVE that stuff!  I'm not saying Wellness is a bad food, my cats just did not like anything about it.

review/summary: So far, so good...
review/text: I have 2 cats, and one of them has a lower bowel disorder, for which he is on daily medication.  I've been trying out different types of foods to aid him with his condition and, so far, this seems to be doing the trick (though I am using this along with Orijen).  Both cats like the food, which is nice since my other cat is the most finicky cat I've ever met, and it seems to be easily digestible.  Stool volume has decreased by about 25%, a nice bonus!  Cost is reasonable.  We'll see what happens in the coming months...<br /><br />My only con so far is the amount of "crumbs" in the bag.  I don't know if it was a result of shipping, or if it's just the consistency of the food, but the bottom ~1 inch of the bag was nothing but crumbs!  Other grain-free brands that I've tried don't seem to have this problem.

review/text: I wanted grain free for my cats and after reading about it online, decided on trying Wellness Core and Innova Evo.  My cats like both, but I did notice they were eating the Evo more.  Only problem with the Evo is that their poop became so smelly.  We decided on the Core since they liked it anyway and have been feeding them Core for about 2 years now.

review/summary: Low Fat and Few Calories (HEALTHY SNACK); Great Taste
review/text: Glenny's Low Fat Soy Crisps are a healthy snack and I absolutely love them.  Trying to be health conscious and trying to avoid fats, I was looking for snacks that would satisfy both requirements.  I stumbled on these snacks at two (2) places: Dean's Natural Foods stores and Whole Foods.<br /><br />Be careful that you only select the Glenny's that say Low Fat on the label. Why? This is important if you are trying to cut fat out of your diet as well as calories.  There are no saturated fats nor any trans fats nor any cholesterol in the low fat Glennys.  There is only one gram of fat per serving.  And the calorie count is extremely low (only 70 calories per serving) versus for the regular Glennys over 110 to 120 calories per serving.<br /><br />The taste is great and for those who need a crunchy snack sometime during the day; this is a healthy alternative to potato chips or pop corn.  Two small servings which would only be 140 calories and 0 saturated fat would provide you with 10 grams of soy protein, 25 mg of soy isoflavones, 3 grams of dietary fiber and more soy protein than tofu or soy milk.<br /><br />Cosmopolitan Magazine quotes: "Even better than potato chips. Delicious."<br /><br />Additionally, each serving gives you 4% of your daily calcium requirement and 8% of your iron percent daily value. Each serving would be about 10 chips approximately.  I open the 3 ounce bag and separate the contents into ziplock bags (10 chips apiece) so that I can regulate the calories and the amount of fat in my snacks.<br /><br />What is nice for those who are afraid to buy a 3 ounce bag of anything.  Even if you succumbed to eating the entire 3 ounce bag: all would not be lost.  You would be getting 20 grams of protein, 50 mg or soy isoflavones, 6 grams of dietary fiber and 300 calories total in the whole bag.  The taste is great whether you purchase the low fat apple cinnamon, the white cheddar or the lightly salted, the low fat barbeque...all have a great taste.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this snack..great taste.<br /><br />Sample a bag.  I think you will be a fan after that.<br /><br />There are 1.3 ounce bags (which are being offered on Amazon) which are even better than the 3 ounce (85 gram) bags (for those who are concerned about their will power) that I have been purchasing.  You have the bags already divided into individual snack portions with 24 bags in the pack.  Terrific alternative.  This particular selection is for a six pack of the 3.5 ounce bags which I have been purchasing at my local natural food stores.<br /><br />Note: The White Cheddar is my personal favorite of the lightly salted, barbeque and white cheddar LOW FAT selections.  Although all are crunchy and good tasting.  MAKE SURE TO SELECT THE WHITE CHEDDAR VARIETY THAT STATES LOW FAT ON THE BAG COVER (THIS SELECTION IS 70 CALORIES PER SERVING VERSUS 110!)..GLENNY'S HAS TWO DIFFERENT WHITE CHEDDAR PRODUCT OFFERINGS..ALWAYS CHECK THE CALORIES AND THE PER SERVING NUTRITIONAL VALUES.<br /><br />Bentley/October 2007

review/summary: High in protein and tastes great!
review/text: I was so shocked to see that there were 7 grams of protein in serving of these chips that were only 80 calories.  This is really impressive, since most protein bars that pack similar amounts of protein are way more calorie rich and packed with a lot more sugar and fat.  I compared these soy chips with the PowerBar ProteinPlus High Protein Bars and here are the stats if you were to eat 3 servings of these chips (to get comparable protein amounts):<br /><br />Glenny's vs Powerbar:<br />21 g protein vs 23 g protein<br />240 cals vs 290 cals<br />0 g sat fat vs 3.5 g sat fat<br />3 g fiber vs 2 g fiber<br />27 g carbs vs 37 g carbs<br /><br />So the powerbar has 2 more grams of protein, but is 50 more calories and tons more carbs.<br />On top of that the chips taste great and are perfect if you love crunchy, savory, carby stuff but still want to get that protein.  Highly recommended!<br /><br />--Don't worry, I don't work for them, I just did all these calculations because I literally could not believe the protein content in these considering they are also low fat, low carb and low cal as well.  Why doesn't this get any more cred?

They arrived at my door so quickly (in only two or three days, despite the prediction of more than a week) that I was completely astonished.  For people who are on Weight Watchers, they can eat twice as many of these crisps than they can other similar products for the same number of points.  The crisps are a delectable alternative to crackers and chips, and in lieu of croutons, I have crumbled them into salads as well.  I have even melted fat free cheese on them.  They are worth the money and the few days' wait.

review/text: I have tried many brands of soy chips and these are the best I have found. And they are one of the few brands that come in plain ol salted. I don't do the flavored chips. Their customer service on the home site needs major improvement, but Glenny's still makes the best chips.

I've been drinking diet soft drinks for a very very long time, and I prefer them to the HFCS versions.<br /><br />This stuff is expensive, and, after one try, I do not like it as much as I like the lime-flavored diet name brand cola.  It's not bad.  Just different.  And I think I could get to like it.  The cola has an almost tea-like quality to it, and the sweeteners (stevia and erythritol) are very sweet. The carbonation is on the light side for my taste.  It's drinkable, and it has caffeine, so it's got that going for it.

Most of the flavored coffees lose the "coffee" flavor and taste very weak.  This is a nice medium coffee with a great hazelnut touch.  At this point in time, I haven't found a better quality tasting hazelnut.  The price is also reasonable.  I'm on the Subscribe and Save with this product.

review/text: My husband and I are fans of flavored coffee and have tried many types of hazelnut coffee.  This one is plain delicious, especially the first thing in the morning.  It starts with the aroma while it's brewing, transfers to the cup, and then does not disappoint when you taste it.  The flavor strength of this coffee is just right, and there is no artificial cast or aftertaste.  To maximize our coffee experience, we keep the coffee in the freezer once it's been opened and double filter our water.  Price wise, when Amazon runs it for just $4.71 a pound (do the math, and this includes super saver shipping), this coffee is perfect.  I can finally quit searching for the perfect hazelnut coffee.

review/summary: No question this is not only a good deal, but ship to door is great!
review/text: My wife and I have tried many different coffee's over the last several years and thru trial and error have been forced to repeatedly chose an alternative brand of coffee every time our local supermarket no longer carried what we HAD gotten used to (and LIKED). It's seems like it's been about 1-2 times a year in the last 3 years and I was sick of it. After the last 'coffee cycle' I decided to look for a steady source. And now using Amazon subscription service (delivered to my door) no other source is competitive (or reliable). Amazon subscription service is superb, I highly recommend it. Also, about the Melitta coffee!<br />I thought it would be obvious but to be clear, it is superb. We have tried many and love the 'just right' amouint of SLIGHT Hazelnut Creme flavor and love how mild and NOT bitter (unlike so many coffee's) the underlying taste is. It's smooth, not bitter, and wonderful. We use 4 heaping scoops in our Braun 12 cup drip machine per batch. So after 'trying' (and tossing or giving away) many other coffee brands (and several flavors) this was the one we settled on. Many flavored coffee's would be a bitter base coffee with a "too strong" perfume taste. This one is just right and anyone who has come to our house like it (including people who do NOT like flavors generally).

review/summary: The Best Hazlenut...Very Fine Ground
review/text: I have been drinking Melitta coffee for years. I don't drink it all the time for I like the flavor of different blends.  But when I am in the mood for hazelnut flavored coffee this brew by Melitta is the very best I have ever tried.  And trust me, I have tried many. Not every one of the more expensive blends, but just about everything around Melitta's price range. I think the key to this coffee being so good is its fine grind.  Make that it's very fine grind.  It really looks and feels like a brown powder it is so fine.  But I just happen to believe that one gets the most flavor out of any blend by totally pulverizing the coffee bean and then making sure its stays sealed tight and fresh.  Nobody grinds coffee finer than Melitta in my opinion.  And thus they're flavored coffee is the best for that reason, as well as the fine beans they start with.  Mind you this is only my opinion about the fine grind.  It very well may be that some people don't like the taste of a such a powdery grind and if you are one of them, I would suggest you skip this blend.  On the other hand, if you want what is in my opinion the freshest most flavorful hazelnut that can be found easily, I believe Melitta is your blend.  Even though it is easily found in stores I suggest you pick it up right here on Amazon, and if you really like it, subscribe to their regular delivery.  You will save on sales tax,(in most cases) receive a discount, and, all subscription orders on Amazon ship for free.  An undeniable deal over buying locally.  Highly recommended for your morning, or anytime pleasure....

I tried to cheat on this flavor and went to French Vanilla and Morning Decadence... But came back to Hazelnut almost instantly. Great Coffee, one of the best!<br /><br />UPDATE: As per now, June 2011... Coffee itself is great, but the price jumped over last months. So now i suppose to pay for $8 more than initially established price. Shame on you, Amazon, you don't follow your our contract!

review/summary: Hazelnut Good Feeling
review/text: It just feels like everyday, a great cup of coffee is a simple way to start off your everyday morning just right. While I've had so many different coffee brands like Maxwell Houde & store brands, I don't really feel the simplicity of seeing great flavors in ground in the stores anymore. Melita though does know how to simply make a strong cup of coffee that can simply make your day strong, and that is the case with the taste of their Hazelnut Creme ground coffee. The coffee tastes purely delightful, and stronger than the ones that you'd get at Dunkin' Donuts, or any other store chain. I love the aroma from beginning to end. My only one big gripe with the coffee is that it is harder to open after you open the lid. You'd also have to use the aid of a can opener to get the coffee open afterwards, but it definitely is worth the wait. If you want a zesty and smooth hazelnut taste, than I really suggest you get Melita's Hazelnut Creme coffee.<br /><br />Quality: A-<br /><br />Price: B+<br /><br />Overall: B+

review/summary: Another Great Offering from Wellness
review/text: I saw this in my local pet store and wanted to try this out on my three cats, they currently eat <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003G0APGK">Wellness 24-Pack Healthy Indulgence Tuna Recipe Cat Food, 3-Ounce Pouches</a> and I have to smush it up in the pouch because two out of three cats prefer their soft food in smaller bits, all of them prefer the pouch food over Pate Style and all three want Tuna over everything else.<br /><br />In the store I compared the ingredients on the label just to make sure they were comparable. Here are the first 6 ingredients side-by-side:<br /><br />Wellness Tuna (Pouch) - Turkey Broth, Tuna, Turkey, Turkey Liver, Egg Whites, Potato Starch<br />Wellness Tuna (Can, Minced) - Tuna, Fish Broth, Water Sufficient for Processing, Salmon, Dried Egg Whites, Peas<br /><br />While this seller doesn't specify the size of the product, I'm assuming it's the smaller 3 oz cans, the same I purchased in store (there were no other available sizes). Both the Healthy Indulgence Pouch food and the new Minced Canned Food Tuna Dinners are 3 oz.<br /><br />Here is a side-by-side comparison of the Guaranteed Analysis for each:<br /><br />Pouch - Crude Protein: 9%<br />Can -  Crude Protein: 8%<br />Pouch - Crude Fat: 2.5%<br />Can - Crude Fat: 3%<br />Pouch - Crude Fiber: 1%<br />Can - Crude Fiber: 1%<br />Pouch - Moisture: 82%<br />Can - Moisture: 82%<br />Pouch - Ash: 2.5%<br />Can - Ash: 2.8%<br />Pouch - Magnesium: .025%<br />Can - Magnesium: .035%<br />Pouch - Taurine: .10%<br />Can - Taurine: .05%<br /><br />You can see that while they are the same flavor, not all ingredients are the same.<br /><br />All three of my cats ate this food but I suspect they prefer the pouch food over the canned food due to little bits being left over in their bowls while the pouch food was completely gone and their bowls were licked so clean they shined. I would purchase this again to give them some variety.

review/summary: Those w/food allergies--caution!
review/text: This is the first garlic-infused olive oil I've purchased, so I can't speak to the taste comparison differences, it reminds me of a mild truffle oil; I was under the impression, however, that this was 100% extra-virgin olive oil.  It is pure olive oil AND extra-virgin olive oil mixed. My fault for not reading more carefully.  The "pure" olive oil is listed first on the label denoting that most of the contents is not EVOO.  I do not see Italy as the place of origin as some garlic olive oils are...this one says "bottled by Boyajian, Inc., Canton MA," that's all.  The other thing that makes this a more serious problem for me is that it has a disclaimer on the label that it shares machinery w/peanut oil and wheat.  My toddler granddaughter is very allergic to dairy, eggs, and worst of all--peanuts. B/c of her dairy allergy, I use olive oils freely w/o worry as a suitable cooking substitute for dairy butter. Had I assumed that olive oils were safe for her and not read the label, I might have sent her to the hospital with this oil.  So if you have issues w/these 2 food allergies, beware. I will try another brand of garlic-infused 100% EXTRA-VIRGIN olive oil after this bottle is finished.

review/summary: The Missing Ingredient
review/text: This really is the missing ingredient to all of your attempts at making traditional japanese food!  It may seem odd that fish is used as a "spice", but it really almost is just that.  I tried making steamed japanese vegetable with mirin & soy sauce figuring that Mirin was the missing ingredient.  But it wasn't until I read on one of the packages that hon dashi is required, that I discovered the true missing ingredient!  I bought fresh miso to make miso soup, and it too didn't taste right.  Added a spoon of hon dashi and suddenly I had real Miso Soup!  (actually i found out later you can buy fresh miso for miso soup with the dashi already added)  Hon dashi is great for soup stock for udon or soba too.  Buy some and add a little to whatever doesn't taste quite japanese enough.

review/summary: Good but read carefully
review/text: After buying some fresh organic miso at a local supermarket the search for dashi stock for miso soup led me here. Having tried it (1/2 tsp stock + 2 tbsp miso + 2 cups water) it was pretty good but I am subtracting one star for the salt and MSG content which is considerable in this product. While this will be good for those in a pinch I think I might opt to try making my own stock with shaved bonito so I can axe out the salt and MSG.

review/text: It is the missing ingredient in miso soup recipes if yours doesn't call for bonito- this has lots of salt and MSG though.  It doesn't work for me unfortunately.  If you're sensitive to MSG, I like the Miso seasoned with bonito and without MSG, but it can be hard to find.  Alternatively use the bonito shavings and just plain miso without MSG.

review/summary: Easy Must Have for Miso Soup
review/text: Because I wanted homemade Miso soup TODAY, I ran out to my local Asian grocer to find any kind of dashi bonito soup stock sans the MSG.  Couldn't find it... this brand was the only one they even sell.  I purchased it reluctantly (at a slightly lower cost and no shipping fees, btw - $3.99 for one 2.29 oz bottle) and while I am not happy about the first two ingredients being Salt then MSG, it did make my Miso soup taste very good.  I will definitely keep searching for a dashi benito soup stock without MSG, but until then this is a good substitute.

review/summary: Healthy, but nothing more
review/text: This tree was absolutely nothing as pictured. It has horrible qualities for bonsai, even as a place to start. The best part of my money spent was the unglazed pot I received. The tree was honestly healthy, albeit with a poor root system(very obviously grown from a cutting/air layer). It is just a horribly ugly thing with attempts of wiring that would have been best left off. It is about a foot and a half tall with a trunk diameter less than an inch. I could lop off the top half to start over, but the curve in the trunk is so dramatic there is nothing to do with it afterwards. I am attempting to make something out of it by rooting the branches and making an air layer out of the top half, which might have potential many years from now.<br /><br />Bottom line, don't buy from here, unless you want to pay $40 for a small pot and fire wood. You're better off going to your local department store and buying a juniper with a blind fold on.<br /><br />This would have 1 star but, as I said, the tree was technically in decent shape, as well as the pot. Not reccomended what-so-ever though.

review/text: When the tree - a gift - arrived, I was thrilled. It is absolutely gorgeous. However, I soon realized that it is a tree that MUST be kept outdoors. The main description on Amazon did NOT say this - I had to read the detailed description. Because there are dozens of bonzais to look at on Amazon, I must have skipped over this. Now, I have a gift for someone who would LOVE to have a bonzai, but who lives in an apartment so cannot keep it outdoors. I'm incredibly disappointed. The problem is not with the quality of the tree, which is wonderful. The problem is with Amazon's description, which has left me in the lurch just a few days before I had to give it as a gift.

review/summary: Excellent tea, despite the misleading name!
review/text: Recently, I've been searching for a good ginger tea. Preferably, something that captures the awesome spiciness and flavor of ginger. After trying the Organic Ginger Aid tea by Traditional Medicinals and being disappointed (see my review on that) I decided to try out this tea instead.  So, how was it?<br /><br />Well, it was good and bad.  It has "Spicy Ginger" in its title, but it's not spicy at all and you can't really taste the ginger.  So in that sense its pretty bad.  However, its still delicious as a tea, and has a very pleasant lemony flavor (probably due to the lemon myrtle).  I don't normally like lemony-tasting teas, but I absolutely loved this one, so that really says something.  Unfortunately, this tea doesn't really satisfy my craving for ginger flavor.  I would recommend it, however, to those who want the health benefits of ginger but hate the taste.  This would be perfect for those sorts of people.<br /><br />I later discovered that you can make an excellent ginger tea by just boiling some fresh ginger root slices in water.  This resulted in excellent spicy ginger tea and was very cheap to make (since ginger roots are pretty inexpensive).  So, I really recommend this method over buying this tea if you just want ginger flavor.  However, I'll still probably buy this tea since I love it's taste so much otherwise.  In fact, if you are just looking for a tasty good tea (and don't care about having ginger flavor) then I recommend you pick this up.  I only wish they'd change the name to something like "Lemon Myrtle Organic Blend" or some such so that it would more accurately describe the taste that buyers are going to get.  Other than that, though, it gets 4/5 stars simply for still being delicious.

review/summary: Favorite afternoon (caffeine-free) pick me up
review/text: This tea is the best herbal blend I have ever tried from any brand. Most herbal teas rely too heavily on the big hitters: licorice, rosehips, chamomile, mint, orange, and other fruits.<br /><br />Somehow this Organic Spicy Ginger is gingery without being so hot and simple that I could have just boiled ginger in water for a few minutes. It has other notes that balance the ginger and leave me feeling nourished, revitalized, and ready to take on the afternoon.<br /><br />It's not always spicy. I've noticed some boxes are spicier than others. I've also noticed that it doesn't get bitter or tart or yucky in any way when left to steep. In fact, to try and milk the spiciness out of it I don't even bother taking bag out of the cup.<br /><br />I gave this tea to a coworker who was feeling a cold coming on and she requested a second bag a few hours later. Before going home for the day she reported feeling much better. She didn't end up with a cold.<br /><br />The only bummer is that I cannot find this tea anymore in stores! Which is why I looked here on Amazon. And it is not available here either. Why Tazo? Why?

review/summary: Don't bother with this fig jam!
review/text: I have become obsessed with trying every fig jam and preserves and chutneys I see available.  They are truly wonderful with goat and sheeps milk cheeses.  There are many brands which are simply wonderful - unfortunately this one is not!<br /><br />The flavor is NOT rich and figgy - it tastes diluted and flat.  The consistency has too much gelatin in it so it is NOT smooth and creamy as it should be.<br /><br />I keep my fig preserves in the refrigerator for AGES - and they never, ever go bad - I had one in there for over two years.  This brand however, actually went MOLDY after a couple of months!!  Good riddens to the most disgusting fig jam I've ever had!<br /><br />Now for some recommendations for delicious brands:  Bonne Maman Fig Preserves (France) is widely available and very nice - creamy with a nice fig taste.  The Adriatic Fig Spread (Croatia) is very widely available - it has a rather bright, fruity taste, a bit more tangy - but also nice. L'Epicurien (France) makes a bunch of fig products - some which I haven't tried yet - but the one I have tried is their Fig and Walnuts Confit.  It is pricey for the size (only 4.4 oz) but it DIVINE - really indescribable - very rich and intense - somewhat sweeter than regular fig preserves - worth trying at least once.<br /><br />And finally is the Vergers de Gascogne Fig Jam (France) imported in US exclusively by Williams Sonoma - and as far as I know - only available in their stores - not on their website.  This one is amazing wonderful - a classic - call them and find out how to order.<br /><br />I have another 6 brands in my pantry ready to taste - but too soon to recommend.  But don't waste your money on this one - that is for sure...

review/summary: It really depends.
review/text: If you've largely had only pan-fired (Chinese style) green teas, the kind of green tea they sell in American supermarkets, this tea will probably seem surprisingly flavorful.  It will likely strike you as bold, but still possessing of some nuance; it won't seem too sharp and there will be some slight awareness of a vegetable flavor.<br /><br />That was my experience at least, and the reason I think it depended on my drinking history was that I received a very large quantity of high-grade gyuokuro tea as a birthday present.  It took maybe two months for me to finish that stock, and returning to this tea, I found it bitter and unsubtle-tasting.<br /><br />I've readjusted and appreciate this tea again.  I prefer it because I drink liters of tea a day (I'm what the Japanese would deride as a "tea gulper" rather than a "tea drinker" or a "tea sipper") and it's more economical.  It can even taste good, depending on your history.  I'd recommend it to most Americans who want to give steamed (Japanese style) green tea a try, at least as their starting point.  It's somewhat reminiscent of the supermarket green teas actually, except perhaps bolder and slightly more nuanced, and if they think it's an improvement over those teas then they might want to try the more vegetable flavors of higher-grade senchas.

If you're looking for a really excellent green tea to enjoy, you'd probably want to skip this. If you're just looking for a cheap tea to drink daily, this may be ok.

review/summary: not a good tea
review/text: I am very disappointed in this green tea.  I bought it to use in protein shakes and it creates a grassy aftertaste that is not at all pleasant.  It makes me not want to drink my shakes at all that were previously delicious with other green teas. I don't steep my tea so I cannot comment on it in that sense, but as soon as I opened one of the bags I could smell the difference from every other green tea I have had. There was no sweet aroma like there typically is with sencha green teas, and it almost made me gag. This is not a high quality green tea and I would recommend buying elsewhere.

review/summary: Ugh.
review/text: I'm not vegan or vegetarian, but I don't have an issue eating vegan friendly foods. I picked up the Dr. McDougall's Miso Ramen because it's somewhat low in sodium. I don't know if it's the lack of sodium, or just the product in general, but this really isn't very tasty. Eatable, yes, but I'm not going to order/eat more.

review/summary: 5 stars from a part-time barista
review/text: When I worked in a local cafe, we used Torani chocolcate, caramel, and mayan chocolate sauces.  The store didn't last long, but it wasn't because of the sauces!  Our lattes were the most popular things on the menu, and many people ordered the mocha (that we called Dame Holda), which used this sauce.<br /><br />This sauce is sure to impress if you are whipping up espresso drinks for friends, because it is the cafe stuff--just remember to use good-quality espresso beans with it ;)

review/summary: Recommended!
review/text: For Christmas we got a Saeco espresso machine - this is the brand Starbucks sells, and we know Starbucks well, so we purchased the chocolate (and syrups) SBUX uses, Fontana... It wasn't until I tasted that chocolate separate from my drink that i realized i really really did NOT like it. I looked on Amazon and saw the recommendation of Torani and of Hershey's Special Dark. I bought small bottles of both of those at our local grocery store and tested them.<br /><br />Of the three, Torani won. By far. It is the only one that to me mimicked melted chocolate. With a flavor resembling solid chocolates you would want to eat. Fontana has a very strong corn syrup flavor, almost maple syrupy with the chocolate and Hersheys Special Dark, while a definite improvement over regular, didn't wow me either.<br /><br />Torani's ingredient list shows more dutch cocoa and it shows! I gave it 4 stars because its not perfect, but graded on a curve it is...<br /><br />Surprisingly I had avoided this brand because it is available everywhere and i thought too common to be able to match what i could buy at an actual coffee house, if that makes any sense... I am sure we won't buy fontana again.<br /><br />Next is to sample caramel sauces, something tells me fontana might not win there either.<br /><br />Note that this 64oz bottle (at least at current amazon prices) is a few dollars more than the 6-pack of smaller bottles, and less ounces, but we opted for this because of the ease of the pump to control measuring, etc. It uses the same pumps as Torani syrup bottles...

review/summary: It's about the taste
review/text: Pros:<br /><br />*  No High Fructose Corn Syrup.  It uses a sweetener you may not have heard of:  sugar<br />*  Taste amazing<br />*  Makes good mochas<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />*  Thick sauce<br />*  No pump works well unless it is kept at room temp, which means you have to use it within a few weeks<br /><br />In short: 5 stars.  It's about the taste.

review/summary: Happily Surprised
review/text: I had been using the Torani chocolate mocha sauce for a long time, but when it wasn't available in the smaller bottles for a while at Amazon, I started freaking out as my supply ran low.  I'm very fussy if I don't make my mocha in the morning.  However, I tried the large bottle of chocolate sauce with the pump after finding out that the stuff does not need to be refrigerated.  I'm a convert now.  The taste is great even though the label is different, but I think it is pretty much the same ingredients, although the proportions of the basic ingredients are a bit different.  I'm a convert now, and I'm just about ready to order a couple more bottles.

review/summary: could almost be considered a marital aid
review/text: As a woman, I must have my chocolate, and as an only child, I dont like to share. My husband kept taking my coffee chocolate and put it on his ice cream. this stuff is sooo good but so difficult to find in the brick and mortar stores I would hide the bottle for my home made iced mocha espresso so he would not use it all up. Just installed the separate sold pumper on this FAMILY size bottle and now peace has returned to our caffeinated home.<br />I have to refer to the other positive reviewers on the quality ingredients and confirm the superior taste over the corn syrup brands. it makes so many things taste great, try it!

review/summary: ifficult to Use
review/text: This big bottle was WAY too difficult to use.  Even though I bought an accompanying pump.  The pump did not work well and I ended up throwing it away.  This sauce did not taste as good as good old Hershey's Extra Dark.  For this one, don't waste your money.  Just buy the Hershey's.
