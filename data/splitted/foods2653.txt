review/summary: Amazon Switches to Reckless Shipper for This Purchase
review/text: The coffee is a standard supermarket item.  The shipper, some operation called Lasership, failed to deliver it to me even though I was home the day the shipment allegedly was dropped off or dumped, perhaps in front of the building in Manhattan.  Other Amazon shipments to tenants in the large apartment building I live in can now be found in the front of the building or its unattended lobby, totally abandoned.<br /><br />Terrible, awfully irresponsible actions by Amazon, considering others have already complained, online, about this problem.  I don't need the free "two-day" delivery; was happy with standard ground-UPS service, where the UPS driver finds the recipient, often merely by ringing the tenant's bell, or hands the packages over to the superintendent of the building, who signs for them, and is located in the basement.  But Amazon doesn't offer a choice.  Not worth the trouble to save a few dollars.  Amazon made good on the failure to deliver.

review/summary: Contains caffeine
review/text: This isn't what coffee tastes like.  It really really isn't, and it makes me wonder if the first reviewer here realized they were reviewing the instant version of Folgers classic roast.  I guess some things just can't be dried and reconstituted.  It even has a strange earthy funk about it, like it was dried in a cave.  But you can drown it in cream or milk and it does, in fact, contain caffeine.  The coffee maker where I work is broken today.<br /><br />In a way, I kind of like it, but it tastes as much like coffee as soy milk tastes like milk.

review/summary: Deceptive Ad
review/text: Shoplet ad was very deceptive. Don't let it fool you. Yes, these are original Melitta One:One pods but the listing says over 90% off and shipping weight states 6 pounds. You think when you are buying that you are getting more than one box of 18 coffee pods. When my package arrived the shipping box said 2 pounds on the outside. There is NO way this retails for over $100.

review/text: I bought these for my daughters 3rd birthday party, the theme was "Purple". I use to buy these locally but could no longer find them. They were horrible, if I could give zero stars, I would. First of all, they did not even taste like M&M's anymore. And over half of them were cracked and smashed. Very disappointed in this vendor.

review/summary: M&M's 'My Color'
review/text: These are just basic M&M's so if you go to the store and look at the bags by the register, you are getting the same product. This just happens to be about 4 times the size for about 8 times the price. but i guess that's the price you pay for solid colors. That being said it is the same product, same flavor, same freshness as store shelves. one thing to consider when buying is your vendor. I purchased from M&M directly and got a nice bog with padding and a reusable cold pack. Maybe lost one or two to cracking. I ordered from a 'Free Shipping' vendor on Amazon and received half of each bag shattered and it arrived in a poorly padded envelope. At least it wasn't melted I guess.<br />Great product, if you like M&M's, somewhat market priced, nice gift/theme idea, and color was pretty true to picture.

Smuckers uses all natural ingredients, too; and Smuckers apricot preserves go great with some butter on bread, too.<br /><br />There's no fat, no sodium and your carbs are low with these preserves. Moreover, they just plain taste great! They have a very smooth consistency and texture. I highly respect the other reviewer who writes that he prefers Smuckers; but I myself still prefer the slightly tarter flavor and the texture of Hero apricot preserves.<br /><br />Keep the jar refrigerated after you open it; and you'll be fine!<br /><br />Overall, Smuckers makes very good apricot preserves; I believe that these are some of the better apricot preserves you'll ever find on your grocer's shelf.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Excellent choice, but not as thin as true angel hair pasta.
review/text: To be fair, it being thin is probably because it is whole grain, but more on that in a moment. This is on the Whole Grains Council's list (wholegrainscouncil.org)  as being 100% whole grain (56g per serving), and is stamped as such, so it is to be trusted which is a very good thing.<br /><br />It's quite good, but it's thickness is probably closer to thin spaghetti. In fact, had it not been clearly labeled as angel hair, I would have assumed that this was indeed thin spaghetti. That's not entirely bad, just different.<br /><br />Personally, I prefer the whole grain texture over plain white pasta. Plain white pasta is easily accidentally overcooked. I can't stand mushy pasta! Mushy pasta is like paste on a plate. Yuck. I've never gotten that with the whole grain stuff.<br /><br />Would I buy it again? Yes. Would I recommend it to friends? Yes. Would I warn them not to expect traditional angel hair pasta? Yes, but I'd also add that it's still very good.

review/summary: Sunrise on the go!
review/text: I love orange juice. I could drink it almost 24/7 & it's what I usually prefer if I need to wake up. I'd held off from purchasing the CL `Sunrise' because I really didn't know if I'd like it or not. Orange drink isn't the same as orange juice, so it's usually a hit or miss type of thing & I'm really preferential to the actual juice.<br /><br />So in any case, I finally gave in & purchased a package. Since I work nights, it's not always convenient to go out & purchase bottles of OJ before I go out & I'm not always the greatest at remembering to grab one from the fridge before I leave the house. As with most of the on the go packets, it's easy to remember these.<br /><br />When I was mixing this stuff up, it didn't look appetizing at first. It contains calcium, which made the drink look a little milky at first when I was shaking my water bottle up, which looked strange at first. After a bit more shaking, it looked fine. The flavor is nice & is better than many orange drinks out on the market. CL really does try to capture the OJ flavor as best as they can & they use citric acid in it, which helps considerably.<br /><br />The bonus parts of this drink is that it contains calcium & vitamin C, two things that many people don't get enough of- especially the calcium! (I know I don't.) The only real drawback of this drink is that it didn't look all that great while I was mixing it. The flavor is good for a powdered orange drink. It's not going to replace my lust for the real thing, but it's a good replacement for those days when I can't get some OJ.

review/summary: Good, actually has a bit of real orange taste
review/text: This stuff actually has the taste of oranges.  It absolutely is NOT like an orange-flavored soda or sports drink.  If you drank it without knowing what it was, you might mistake it for a cheap store-brand OJ from concentrate, or perhaps one of those orangina drinks minus the carbonation.  There sure are some clever mofos working in the Crystal Light laboratory.<br /><br />And as usual, this Crystal Light is made with just the right mix of different fake sugars to not have a fake sugar taste.  These things are a perfect way to pass on a large soda with your meal without having to settle for plain water or icky diet sodas.

review/text: This is the best tasting Crystal Light flavor I've tried so far. It doesn't have the "diet" drink taste at all. I've gone through almost all 6 boxes that I ordered through amazon, and I haven't gotten tired of it yet. I plan to continue ordering it. It's definitely the easiest way to get my 8 cups of water in on a daily basis. Note: I use 1 packet for every 4 cups of water. Crystal Light recommends using 1 packet for every 2 cups of water, but I find that to be too strong. It's a great price on amazon, and even better when I can make it last twice as long. (I haven't had any issues with it going stale.)<br /><br />The little On-The-Go size is perfect for work, too. The box is small enough to fit in my desk drawer. I couldn't be more pleased.

Alas, things are never as good as they used to be, and maybe they never were!

Apparently pistachio paste is not as standardized as peanut butter.  I used the same amount as was called for in the recipe, but it was far too strong and had an unpleasant aftertaste.  I would never attempt to substitute this for Bronte paste, despite the higher price of the Bronte paste.  I gave this 5 stars because it isn't a fair comparison.  It smelled great when opened, and had I used it on bread or in another recipe, I'm sure it would have tasted wonderful.  I had to give this review though to warn others who  might want to save some money on their Pistachio Gelato.

I've been making home made chocolate truffles from scratch for over 20 years, normally (in recent years) using Love n Bake Praline (hazelnut) Paste and decided to try pistachio on a batch. It was/is delicious. Someone's review mentioned the oil on top when the can is first opened, but that's the nature of the product. Both praline and pistachio MUST be stirred which is no easy chore since both are so thick. Worth the effort, though...for the quality of the product and the great flavoring. Plus you get a little upper body workout to counter the calories of the goodies you're creating! >&lt;>

review/text: If you are expecting almond paste, you will be surprised.  This product contains canola oil and, when you open the can, you might be surprised to find it all pooled on top.  If you mix it in with the paste, you get a consistency that is more like liquid cement than the firm, moist consistency of almond paste.<br /><br />I can't compare the quality of the brand to others since is the only brand I could find for non-professionals.  However, in my opinion, Love-n-Bake's almond paste is not as moist and flavorful as Solo brand.

review/summary: An excellent replacement for chips and salsa
review/text: I am on a restricted diet and so cannot have things like corn, lime juice, and citric acid.  That has put quite a damper on my dining out a la Mexican, but it has also eliminated my favorite snack of chips and salsa.<br /><br />I just happened to walk by these little bags in the store.  They shouted out from the end cap "We're gluten free!"  I paid no attention.  When they also shouted they were corn free, I stopped my cart so quickly I may have left skid marks on the floor.  I read the ingredient list at least four times to make sure they were really safe for me to eat.<br /><br />The texture and feel in the mouth of these chips is a little strange; I expect that's from the beans.  Otherwise they are entirely delightful.  My only complaint about them is that I ate too many when I first opened the bag.  Well, that and they do leave the seasoning remnants on my fingers.<br /><br />If you have a restricted diet these come highly recommended.

review/summary: BUYER BEWARE!!
review/text: I'm terribly disappointed in this product and here's the reason why.<br /><br />The front of the containers I received (and the photo of the item being sold by Senyx) read CRYSTALLIZED LIME and LEMON.  I've purchased True Lemon from my local grocery store and the carrier sweetener was cane sugar...that's what I was expecting with these two products.  Unfortunately, I now have two products that are primarily MALTODEXTRIN (a starch generally made from corn and probably genetically modified corn at that); and the ingredient labels on both items also state the products contain SOY.<br /><br />MALTODEXTRIN is a food additive...a filler...an artificially created sweetener!  I HATE artifical sweeteners. I doubt these shakers contain very little crystallized lime or lemon compared to the amount of maltodextrin.  What I do believe is that this product is primarily maltodextrin flavored with lemon or lime oil with just enought bits of crystallized lime or lemon to be FDA legal.<br /><br />I accept that I should have researched further before purchasing this product.  That is why I won't be returning the items; but I'll NEVER buy them again.  My trust was misguided.  My purpose for writing this review is the hope of educating anyone else from making the same mistake.  I wasted $17.89 and in this day and time...wasting money is NOT advantageous.

review/summary: Wonderful when used as a Cat Treat - like fish flavored cotton-candy for kitties
review/text: While this product is more commonly used to make a traditional fish broth, I have been giving my kitties crushed up Bonito Flakes instead of store-bought treats  once or twice a week for some time now and they couldn't be happier with the switch!  This is all-natural, with no nasty dies for them to blorph up on your carpet and when given in moderation, a dirt cheap treat.  It takes a while for some cats to catch on to the whole idea of a lighter than air flaked treat but once they do, they'll do almost anything to get at the bag so make sure you keep them in a very secure cabinet with a baby-lock!  I gave some as a gift to my neighbors cats and they climbed the counter, pried open the cabinet door, tore into the bag and ate the whole thing in one sitting!  One thing to keep in mind, however, is that what is marketed as "Bonito" is in fact, Skipjack Tuna flakes and not the more expensive Bonito.  If these were actual Bonito flakes, the price would be unaffordable.  The reason you'll want to know the actual type of fish is to asses the mercury risk to your little friends.  Skipjack Tuna is considered a moderate risk to pregnant women and should not be eaten by them an large quantities.  Therefore, I limit doling these treats out to about two times a week for kitty and usually just a healthy pinch or two.  it's enough to make them the happiest kitties on the planet for the moment they are smelling and eating their flakes!  My friends call this stuff "Kitty Kat Krack" and it's best used as a special treat and not an every day treat.<br /><br />There are two ways to give this to kitty:<br /><br />1. When you get the bag open it up and set aside the biggest flakes to use as training or reward treats that you hand feed to kitty. ABout 2/3rds  to 3/4's of the bag are very large flakes that are good for hand feeding to kitty as a treat.<br /><br />2. Then, fold the open top of the bag over and crush up all the rest into a finer bunch of tiny flakes.  This form is easy to put into a special treat dish for kitty when she's been especially good or to maybe comfort an older kitty who's feeling jealous of a new kitten.  I use the fine powdery flakes in a bowl to lure my outdoor semi-feral kitty inside for health checks and to put his flea meds on.  it works like a charm!<br /><br />I'm very serious about this driving the kitties crazy.  Be sure to put a food bag clip on the open bag or store in a ziplock bag after opening. The smell will tempt a kitty to try and get at it wherever you store it!  I order the 4-bag shipment about 2 to 3 times a year, but I have 3 cats and I often give little snack bags away to friends.  Once or twice a year should suffice for a single cat household.  You may see these in small tenth of an ounce packets in pet stores going for $5.99 so you can see this price is much better.  You can also find this in your grocery store in the Asian foods Aisle but the price per unit can be almost double depending upon where you shop.<br /><br />Try some for kitty!

review/text: We just received our Bonito flakes today and it seems that it expired already (2003 production date). We got lots expired Eden products, including this one, from Amazon this month and they cannot be returned due to Amazon policy. The latest Eden promotions are to ship out the overstocks and to "clear" items that are remainder from past warehouse leftovers. We also found it to be true for the majority of Amazon grocery promotions EVERY MONTH, wherever there's a discount code to be entered. Beware of the sales practice before you order, especially if in large quantities and it they are not to be consumed immediately.

review/summary: Good value and fun introduction to the 'champagne of teas'
review/text: Twinings is known for delivering consistency and value. This tea is no exception.<br /><br />Most of the Twinings Darjeeling blend is black, but you can spot some green particles. The Twinings loose tea has no uncut leaves. The blend uses smaller, less-expensive particles which infuse more quickly than whole leaves. The Twinings tea has enough tannins to tolerate milk or a sweetener. It has some harshness when infusing is done at too high a temperature or for too long.<br /><br />I suggest steeping not more than 2 to 2.5 minutes to control bitterness. You may even want to check every 15 seconds starting at two minutes, since Darjeeling can quickly 'bolt' to a point of unpleasant sharpness. To avoid particulate matter in your drink, use a strainer or infuser with a fine mesh. (Amazon sells Tovolo, Teeli, and Frieling/Swissgold filters with very small openings in their screens.)<br /><br />To gain the best flavor, I recommend brewing at a temperature of 185F or cooler. (A clean candy or meat thermometer can quickly guide your efforts.) If you have been brewing with water that is near boiling, you will be shocked by the huge transformation from using water that cools a couple minutes after reaching the boiling point.<br /><br />I have enjoyed quality Darjeeling, the 'champagne of teas,' for over three decades while keeping notes to track favorites. And, how do I rate Twinings? A bargain. And, if your enjoy Twinings, I suggest trying some other Darjeeling teas, perhaps estate grown. The better Darjeeling teas come from the higher elevations where the cooler mountain environment slows leaf growth and develops a fine flavor. Where should you search? Check reviews at Amazon and other sellers. Among the packaged brands, I love Peets - normally known for their coffees.<br /><br />This Twinings tea is a bargain and a fine introduction to the wide range of Darjeeling teas.

review/text: If you are a person whose only experience with tea is grocery store blends that you don't exactly hate but really find too bitter then this is the antidote. Darjeeling is like those blends but it never gets bitter even if you walk off and leave it brewing too long by mistake. It is absolutely my favorite tea. Add a little orange blossom honey and it is perfect. There is nothing in this tea that takes getting used to. If you can tolerate a (famous brand) pekoe-black teabag then you find this tea to be a revelation.

review/text: Darjeeling tea is such a treat.  It has a wonderful taste and aroma.  I love many of the Twinings teas ... English Breakfast, Irish Breakfast, Major Grey and of course, this one.  Major Grey has a floral aroma that is sometimes just perfect.  This darjeeling is wonderful straight or with milk (sugar for some folks).  Makes a nice change from their other teas.<br />I prefer Darjeeling in the late afternoon or evening.<br /><br />Note:  Having lived in various parts of the country, I've found that a tea sometimes just isn't great depending on the water.  My favorite morning tea bounces between English and Irish breakfast, depending on where I'm living.  I recall that Twinings developed a blend especially for NYC back in the 70's sometime.  Water in London and NYC produce different beverages from the same tea.

review/text: Darjeeling is easily my favorite tea and I've had several others, though nowhere near enough to be considered a connoisseur. There really is a subtle grape flavor as well as a total lack of bitterness. The color of the tea, once prepared, is red-orange. The cheapest way that I can see in preparing the loose tea is putting a french press on double duty; Bodum sells presses for around $20. The one thing to watch out for is leaving excess tea in the press. The tea will continue to steep and subsequent cups will be extremely bitter and much darker. Steep for around a minute and a half, but no longer. Also, don't clean the press with any form of soap as the residue tends to add bitterness to the tea.

review/summary: My favorite tea, hands down
review/text: I am never without Darjeeling tea. It is a nice mild tea that tastes good both hot and iced. I am new to loose tea so was a little surprised when I opened the first can to find such fine particles, similar to what you find inside a tea bag. I assumed all loose tea was of the larger, full leaf type. Had I read the other reviews here, I would have known better so my bad.<br /><br />My only complaint about this purchase - hence the 4 star rating - is the expiration date on the tins. They shipped February 8, 2010, with an expiration date of May 28, 2010. Under 4 months? In airtight containers, I expect tea to last at least a year. I understand they have to rotate their stock and these tins had probably been sitting around for 6 months, but it was still surprising and disappointing. As an avid tea drinker, I just finished the last tin so I only went about one month past the expiration date but still, they need to plan their inventory better.<br /><br />If you have yet to try Darjeeling tea, I highly recommend it. Twinings is a good and reputable brand and the quality and flavor never disappoints.

review/summary: The King of Teas.
review/text: Unquestionably the most refined of teas, Darjeeling comes from a region in the Indian (West Bengalese) Himalayas close to the Nepalese border, 7000 ft above sea level. Originating with the small-time, private, mid-19th century plantations of a British civil surgeon named Dr. Campbell, tea has long since transformed the region into a major economic center, with over 80 running gardens producing over 10 million kgs (over 22 million lbs) of tea on a total area of almost 20,000 hectares (approximately 75 square miles), and employing over 50,000 people on a permanent basis, with a further 15,000 being hired during the plucking season (March - November). The area's natural climate with its mixture of rainfall, sunshine and rich soil makes for a very distinctive flavor, and to be called "Darjeeling," tea *must* have been grown *and* processed in that particular region.<br /><br />Darjeeling tea comes in several harvest varieties or "flushes": the lighter Easter harvest or first flush, and the stronger Spring harvest or second flush, which has an unmistakeably fruity, Muscatel-like note. (There is also a Summer harvest or third flush, which is even stronger than the tea from the second harvest, but it is somewhat less refined and therefore less popular than the first two varieties.) Twinings' variety is a second flush tea with a subtle, quintessentially Darjeeling perfume; a great introduction to this region's exquisite teas that will hopefully make you curious for more.

review/text: For over 30 years, I've tried, and continue to try, various brands of darjeeling tea.  I always end back up with Twinings Darjeeling over the long haul.  Love the sealed metal tins the loose leaf tea comes in and love the distinctive taste of the Twinings brand.

review/summary: Twinings Darjeeling Tea
review/text: We like to have a cup of darjeeling in the evening. It is light yet flavorful. It is sometimes called the champagne of teas, for good reason. We have been drinking Twinings loose tea for several years. Buying the 3.53 ounce tins is an economical way to purchase tea for regular tea drinkers, so I recommend buying the pack of six through Amazon. It qualifies for free shipping, so the price is right, and you can't beat the convenience.

review/summary: very good darjeeling for the money
review/text: Very happy with this tea. Light, pleasant, NOT bitter.<br /><br />To those compaining about the particle size; if you strain it after it is brewed, many more particles will be removed AFTER the tea swells from rehydration. If you are then somehow offended by the few particles remaining, filter it.<br /><br />To those compaining about bitterness; I wonder if they know how to properly brew a cup of fine tea. Do NOT use boiling water. Use water heated only to 180 degrees, or allow to cool first to 180. Water much hotter than that will bring bitterness from tannin release. That is true for most teas. Buy a thermometer.<br /><br />I steep mine for 3 to 4 minutes in 180 to 185 degree water, then strain, then reheat the strained tea to serving temperature. Very good without sweetener.

review/summary: Quality is This Brands Middle Name
review/text: When I shop for tea I've learned that brand name does matter and I always look for Twinings for they have loose tea available in hermetically sealed, metal cans that I like better than tea bags.  I avoid buying tea bags because I know that any tea with an essential oil added to it for flavor and not packaged in a lamination of saran coated paper and polyethylene will deteriorate if not sealed in packaging such as that used by Twinings. They have had a good reputation for many years and I'm sure they want to keep it that way.  There are many vendors trying to sell boutique or "artisanal" (that seems to be the latest buzz word)  teas but very few know the correct packaging to use. Buy the tried and proven, buy Twinings, drink it until you learn what a quality tea is supposed to taste like; then you can go and buy some of those "junk" teas and see how you like them.

review/summary: Good Tea
review/text: I started out with this tea because I wanted to try a good black tea. The flavor is indeed lighter like it said, which is nice for a soft pace rather than coffee or soda. The 3.53 ounce tins is a fair size and will last longer than you think. I wanted to purchase the 7 ounce tins, but luckily for me they did not have them in stock. One 3.53 ounce tin lasted a month if not more, for one person, and this is drinking on average two cups per day. So, the 7 ounce tins would be for the whole family. The tin itself looked better than what I thought it would be. The only issue I have with this is the size of the leaves. The leaves themselves are minced, which annoys me for two reasons. One(opinion), it does not make sense to cut them so small. Like what they don't trust people with bigger size pieces? Two(factual), since the leaves are minced, it contains many lesser particle of leaves. And these particle goes right threw the mesh I have and the openings are very small to start with. I recommended placing the amount of tea into whatever mesh tea tool you have and shake it first before steeping.

review/summary: Great Taste
review/text: This is probably the best tea I have had and this brand is always a winner.  So far I am still perfecting my taste with this particular tea but while I am experimenting looking for my perfect taste I have found it to be great weak or strong.  Depending on my mood I like strong tea sometimes but not bitter which can be a problem for tea whether to much or to little is used.  My advice would be perfect before you rate because you may just be making it wrong since I usually let my tea set longer than what is recommended to get my taste and my taste is different than anyone in my family.  They usually claim it is too strong with how much I use but for me it is perfect.  This is a pack of six so make sure you will like this kind before purchasing.

review/summary: Floor sweepings
review/text: This is the worst Darjeeling I've tried, and I've been drinking it on two continents for twenty years.  Twinings offers, not full rolled leaves, but ground-up floor sweepings.  If you use too much tea, or steep it a little too long, you'll get a very bitter cup.  I tried reducing the amount of tea and shortening the steep time, but finally I gave up.  Try another tea company--Amazon has Darjeeling first flush leaf tea for only a few dollars more.

review/summary: Excellant product - good price
review/text: Now makes an excellant product and amazon provides it at a very good price with prompt delivery.  The trick to avoiding aftertaste with stevia powder is not to try to make the food too sweet.  1/16 of a teaspoon is enough for a 12 ounce cup of tea - sweet but not too sweet and no aftertaste.  Use 1/8 of a teaspoon in 12 oz. of tean and the tea will taste as sweet as soda pop and the aftertaste will still be around an hour later.<br /><br />I have been using this product as a sugar substitute for about a month (replacing aspartame - Equal) and recommend it without reservation.

review/summary: Bad batch of Stevia
review/text: Stevia is kind of funny. Brands and batches vary. Sometimes you get a batch that isn't very sweet or has more of an aftertaste (bitterness). Usually, I only have to use 1/16 of a tsp of NOW Stevia to sweeten my morning coffee. The batch I received this time is weak, so I have to use twice as much. (Thank goodness it isn't bitter though.) So it goes with using a natural sweetener. The leaves from which this batch of stevia was extracted must not have had a very high concentration of rebaudiana. I strongly believe that the manufacturer should test out each batch made for quality before packaging it so customers aren't disappointed. Oh, well, better luck next time. I'll still use stevia as a sweetener (I use it in everything I need sweetened). I'm just going to wait a while before buying more NOW stevia until I'm fairly certain all of this batch has been sold.

review/summary: SUPER NATURAL SUGER SUBSTITUTE + TERRIFIC BRAND
review/text: EXCELLENT SUGAR SUBSTITUTE HAS HEALTH BENEFITS + NO WARNINGS,<br /><br />This "NOW Stevia powder" is good stuff and this among the most economical and user-friendly ways to buy Stevia.<br /><br />WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT:<br /><br />Sweeter than sugar, that's what Stevia is, but that's not all.<br /><br />Stevia has been shown to lower blood sugar levels in research involving healthy adults by increasing the secretion of insulin making Stevia useful for diabetics.<br /><br />It also improves digestion and gastrointestinal function, and is useful for upset stomachs and to reduce gas and stomach acidity. Several recent studies have shown that it may improve the heart's muscle tone and promote the body's water loss. These properties are thought to contribute to lower blood pressure.<br /><br />Stevia also has antiviral, antimicrobial and antibacterial characteristics. It's used for relieving bleeding gums, sore throats and cold sores in South America and Japan. Stevia has been shown to inhibit plaque formation and bacterial growth causing gum disease and tooth decay, and will not cause cavities. It may even reduce cravings for sweets which coupled with its lack of calories may be helpful in weight loss.<br /><br />ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS EVEN MORE:<br /><br />There is anecdotal evidence that Stevia is good for skin problems like acne, cold sores, dermatitis and eczema, and may speed up the healing of cuts and scratches. There have even been reports that Stevia may be useful as a contraceptive, but that has not yet been substantiated by research.<br /><br />FDA APPROVAL TO BE SOLD AS A FOOD SUPPLEMENT -- NOT A SWEETENER<br /><br />Most of all, Stevia, unlike the artificial sweeteners we put in everything from soda to psyllium does not come with any health warnings from the FDA, and it will probably do you no harm. However, Stevia has not been approved to be sold as a sweetener even though it is a NATURAL SWEETENER LIKE SUGAR. Nevertheless, Stevia has been approved [since 1994] to be sold as a dietary supplement in the United States.<br /><br />AFTER ALL THE SMOKE HAS CLEARED THIS IS FOOD - USE IT BY EATING IT!<br /><br />Stevia can be substituted for sugar. It is a bit different tasting if one is use to sugar. I use it on many things where I can eliminate large amounts of honey and/or sugar such as;<br /><br />1]- Herbal Tea, instead of sugar or honey.<br /><br />2]- In multi-grain hot cereal, when you need to sweeten it, Stevia saves me a tablespoon of honey and a tablespoon of sugar per large bowl. In this case I just add about a teaspoon of honey and 1/8 teaspoon of stevia for the same effect. Stevia is much sweeter than sugar so use about 1/10th as much in place of sugar.<br /><br />3]- Iced Tea.<br /><br />4]- Pancakes, waffles and French Toast as a replacement for some maple syrup.<br /><br />MEDICINALLY SPEAKING:<br /><br />A standardized extract of 57 mg. containing 85% "steviocides" in a beverage, is what Doctor James A. Duke, suggests in his famous, "The Green Pharmacy Herbal Handbook".<br /><br />ABOUT FORMS AND BRANDS:<br /><br />I prefer Stevia in powder over the packets, as I can better measure, and use what I need for each individual use. Purchase Stevia in whatever form you are most comfortable using.<br /><br />This "NOW" brand Stevia powder is an excellent product and a terrific value. "Planetary Formulas Stevia Powder 3.5 oz." is also excellent and it comes in a liquid as well. "Swanson" and "Nature's Way" are both excellent too, and have Stevia in powder, liquid and packets for convenient use. Any of the above choices are excellent, and I have used them all at one time or another, over the past 3-4 years on a daily basis.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]

review/summary: my preferred sweetener
review/text: I have been a diabetic for almost forty years.  I have tried many sweeteners over the years, some of which caused me some severe reactions.  Years ago, I decided I preferred stevia.  Lately I did another comparison between the different stevia brands.  Better Stevia Organic in the packets is the one I decided to go with.  I do not bake with sweeteners and eat very little baked goods since I am selective on how I expend my carb allowance.  Mostly I just use the stevia in beverages. The organic stevia packets are lined with an inner seal, I suppose to keep it fresh and to keep it from getting hard. However when you hold the packet over a cup of hot beverage the stevia draws moisture and clings to the liner making it difficult to pour out. I simply add the stevia to my cup before I pour in the liquid.  It also does not dissolve quickly in iced beverages.  It takes a minute or two for it to completely dissolve. I like this Stevia Organic enough to deal with these issues.  It does not have additional ingredients.  It is just organic stevia and I like it that way.

review/text: I love NOW's stevia extract, I put it in everything - tea, cereal, curries, stir fries, baking.  There are no sugar carbs at all and it is 200 time sweeter than sugar so 1 lb goes a long way.  The savings with a pound it amazing (compared to $10 for a very small container) and it seems to stay good for a long time, it takes me sometimes a year to finish it.  Some people find that stevia leaves an aftertaste that do not care for so you may want to try a smaller bottle first if you have never tried it.  Every brand supposedly is a little different so if you don't have good luck with one try another.

review/text: Purchasing stevia packets, 1000 at a time saves a little money, but the best part is getting them from Amazon which streamlines the ordering and delivering process. Thanks, Amazon!

review/text: I was so happy to find the Stevia Packets in bulk.  I know that buying bulk saves me money and in this economy, I need to save money. The package came in record time and I've been completely satisfied all the way around.  I will definitely be buying from this same party, again.

review/summary: Good value over store bought.
review/text: Originally, we bought pkts from the grocery store.They seemed to have more filler than these. They not only cost less, but are more oncentrated. Want to try White Stevia next time.

review/summary: All natural, but tastes bad
review/text: I guess if you like Stevia, it's the best way to go. I just hate the plastic, chemical taste -- certainly doesn't TASTE all natural! I ruined two or three cups of coffee using this stuff. But if you like it, it's a good deal.

review/summary: BEWARE OF THIS MISLEADING PRODUCT!!
review/text: The very 1st thing I noticed about this product was how nasty it tasted! I've tried stevia by numerous manufacturers (PLUS, I read the excellent reviews!)  and this is hands-down the worst!<br /><br />When I finally read the actual ingredients (I had assumed it was stevia) and discovered that the very 1st ingredient wasn't stevia..but RICE MALTODENTRIN, I was shocked AND angry!  I have a liver disorder and cannot pump crap like maltodextrin into my liver!  Hence, the use of stevia, an all natural product.  BEWARE IF YOU HAVE DIABETES and think this is a safe sugar substitute.  It's NOT!  Below is a quote from a website (the link follows)...and there are plenty of others with warnings for maltodextrin for those who are looking for an safe sugar substitute.<br /><br />PLUS... I don't care what anyone says.  If you think this is the best stevia product ever (and many actually do!) then you haven't tried the right stevia manufacturer.  NOW isn't one of them.<br />I ordered this shoe in the correct size but they were huge.  i am returning them & hoping that the smaller size will work.  they match the dress perfect & are adorable.<br />..."It's the combination that may cause spikes in insulin because maltodextrin is a carbohydrate with a high glycemic index, similar to table sugar and should be used in moderation if you have diabetes or hypoglycemia. You must consider the carbohydrate content of products sweetened with added maltodextrin to maintain healthy blood sugar levels."<br /><br />Read more:[...]

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: After not being able to find this product in large quantity, I found it at Amazon.com.  Truthfully, I much prefer these over what you find in the stores.  The taste is sweeter and I needed to use less of the packets.  Would I recommend this - you betcha!
