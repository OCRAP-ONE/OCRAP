review/summary: So Glad I Found It
review/text: I have been drinking White Mocha Beverage for YEARS, until the price increase that made it impossible to buy any longer.  I tried many, many substitutes, different brands, chocolate milk, etc., without luck.  I am so happy to find it on Amazon and for a decent price.  This product has a very unique flavor and it is excellent. Not only do you get good taste, but milk also.  I would recommend this to everyone, young and old.  It is creamy, smooth and yummy!  It's easy to prepare, good for all seasons!  Try it, you will like it.

review/summary: Overly sweet, no white chocolate flavor, stale tasting coffee extract
review/text: This is the cheapest stuff I've tasted in a long time. The coffee is rivaled by dollar store coffee instant crystals; it tastes cheap. Day old coffee tastes far better than this. Everything about this is just terrible. There is absolutely no white chocolate flavor.<br /><br />To be blunt; it tastes like oversweetened milk with very little, and very shoddy coffee. This is the shoddiest drink I've had in a long time. If you want the real deal, go with Caffe D'amore or Ghirardelli's white chocolate powder which requires both milk and coffee as opposed to just milk. Those are what real cafes use; trust me, I've worked in a few. Other reviewers (specifically one lacking the Amazon Verified Purchase tag) have mistaken this with Ghirardelli's sweet ground white chocolate powder. It may be loaded with stuff that's unhealthy for you, but white mochas are something you want to indulge upon, not sip and refrain from spitting back out.

review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: This is good. It's not oh-my-god-I've-died-and-gone-to-Starbucks good...but good nonetheless. It's not very strong, so I've tried adding a bit of coffee. But this drowns out the "white" taste. I've tried using it in coffee instead of sugar, but that uses too many calories and the coffee doesn't taste much different. There are 100 calories per 2 tablespoons. I used a little more than recommended for taste, which led to me feeling sick after drinking a tall cup of it. So, I recommend just making an 8 oz. serving.<br /><br />I may try buying some syrup to go along with it. That's probably calorie overkill, however. To sum it up, I'm pretty undecided about what to do with this product.

review/summary: Heaven in a cup
review/text: Let me start off by saying that I am addicted to Peppermint White Chocolate Mochas. It is by far my favourite coffee drink and I absolutely must have one when I go to Starbucks or any other coffee shop for that matter. Having said that this naughty habit of mine can be extremely expensive and I have to have decaf because caffeine irritates my stomach. I first purchased this mix at a grocery store thinking that it sounded interesting. When I tried it for the first time I was absolutely delighted. This is literally heaven in a cup as far as I am concerned and it is one of the best chocolate mixes`I have had the pleasure of tasting.Ghiradelli certainly knew what they were doing when they concocted this beverage mix.This is best made with 2% milk( do not mix with water or non-fat milk....bleh) and for extra delight add 1-2 shots of peppermint syrup.Delicious !

review/summary: Sugar Rush
review/text: Nice, light caramel flavored hard candy with a honey center. It was too sweet for my taste. I felt the energy boost as a sugar rush because the energy bolt is followed by craving a cup of coffee AND was very hungry for real food not a little snack munchie! Of course I had plenty of energy to find something to cook and eat pronto. I'm not sure if the fast absoprtion of the honey causes the effect. Glad I was at home or a fast food drive through was in order.<br /><br />There are 9 pieces in each package. It takes 3 of these to get 100% of the daily recommendation of vitamins B6, B12 and C. I have no desire to have more of these.

review/summary: Just another sugar based candy
review/text: I wasn't expecting to read the ingredients to find out the first one is sugar and the second being corn syrup.  Basically, this is just another candy full of sugar that puts you on an immediate high and then plummets you to a low.  The little bit of vitamin B6 and B12 plus C isn't enough to give the body adequate nutrients to make any difference.<br /><br />I'm disappointed.  I was expecting a product that actually gave energy/nutrients and sustained it; not just another candy.  The flavor was okay...sort of buttery but I ended up spitting it out before I got too far. I'm a huge honey fan and I didn't taste the honey but maybe that's because I didn't hit the center as other reviewers did.<br /><br />This product isn't for me at all. In fact, the remainder of the package went into the garbage.

review/summary: Unsurprisingly Good
review/text: I decided to request Ambrosoli-Honees Energy Plus Vitamins after visiting the manufacturer's Web site to ascertain whether or not they contain any meat products or gelatin; I didn't note any but the claim is that they contain Vitamin B12 which is often of animal origin. I decided to err on the side of my sweet tooth and bit the bullet.<br /><br />I was only marginally surprised that I didn't receive a 24-pack, a situation that usually leaves me fantasizing about asking the manufacturer whether or not they can spare the single item I was given. Regardless of quantity, Ambrosoli-Honees are quite pleasant. Their claim to fame is their soft centers enrobed by a hard shell. I chose the caramel flavor over the plain (which I understand is their most popular variety) because they contain milk and butter--I'm a sucker for dairy. They didn't disappoint; based on their ingredients, I'd have been surprised if they had.<br /><br />Ambrosoli-Honees are a very simple candy with only a few, no-frills ingredients. And yes, they contain corn syrup--a very common ingredient in candy making and, for that matter, home kitchens. Be aware that this is NOT the same as HFCS; don't tar it with the same brush. Amrosoli-Honees are made in Italy and I don't think they know from HFCS there. They (the Honees, not the Italians) do contain honey but its presence isn't really evident until you hit the center. Except for the fact that the surface is rather rough and wreaked havoc on my soft palate (not a great trait in sucking candy), I enjoyed them quite a lot.<br /><br />I'd still like to know the source for the Vitamin B12 but barring that, this is quality candy. It's not, however, an inexpensive nosh (weak dollar, high cost of importing) so I probably wouldn't recommend Ambrosoli-Honees for those looking for a cheap sugar fix. However, for those who don't mind spending for quality who'd like to think they're getting the benefit of several vitamins, Ambrosoli-Honees Energy Plus Vitamins (at least the caramel flavor), are well worth sampling.

review/text: Both my daughter and I gave these Ambrosoli-Honees Energy chews a try at the same time and our conclusion was that while the flavor is so yummy, we never really felt an increase in energy.  The carmel-honey flavor is right on target and the chewy center is delightful.  Can't truly say we felt any more energy from these chews then we do from sucking on a regular piece of candy.  As far as the vitamins in these chews, I wouldn't spend the money on them since we take a multivitamin already.

review/summary: They taste good...
review/text: I'm not certain what "honey energy" is beyond a sugar rush, and to be honest, unless you're on a low carb diet, the chances of getting a rush from this small amount of sugar is pretty slim.  These drops contain small amounts of vitamins B6, B12 and C for which a number of health claims can be made.<br /><br />The candy is a product of Italy so the honey in it may actually be real, unadulterated honey, not the honey-flavored sugar water we get here in the states with inexpensive and mass produced honey (Much of it from China, apparently, and pretty much devoid of any nutritional benefit.) That alone is a plus, assuming I'm correct.  And that's a big assumption in this particular instance.<br /><br />Bottom line, though, is that they taste pretty good, with a crunchy shell and a chewy interior.  I don't know that I consider them effective dietary supplements or energy producers, but as a sweet bite they're not bad.

review/summary: Good Tasting Vitamin Drops
review/text: I found the Ambrosoli-Honees Energy Plus Vitamin Caramel drops to be a nice, sweet alternative to candy.  The caramel flavor is very good and there is a liquid honey center.  While they seem like hard candy, they are chewy in your mouth.  They are 20 calories each and contain 33% of vitamins B6 and B12 as well as vitamin C.  I think the liquid honey centers would make them a substitute for cough drops for those who like honey as a cough suppressant<br /><br />While I like the taste, I personally didn't feel any burst of energy.  I do like the taste (I am guilty of having a sweet tooth) and will more than likely buy these in the future.

Even after several (yes, they are that good), I still had no more energy than regular. The taste was like a caramel chew -- super good. However, I cannot agree that the Ambrosoli provides ANY added energy. Consequently, it makes for a rather expensive candy. I would not purchase this again.

review/summary: Go ahead and schedule your annual dental checkup now
review/text: When I first popped one of these in my mouth, I was really pleased with the light caramel flavor of the hard candy outer shell. The flavor was a little more delicate than a typical <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018AXEFY">Werther's Original Hard Candies, 34-oz.</a>, but it still felt substantial. When the candy shell finally dissolved and broke, it let loose a blast of pure honey, so much so I felt like someone had pounded a beehive into my mouth. Wow! Sweet! I tried another and this time bit through the caramel shell right away. I ended up with a sticky sweet agglomeration of caramel and honey that threatened to glue my mouth shut if it didn't dissolve all my teeth first. Wow! Really sweet! If my dentist doesn't own stock in the maker of this product, he should. Doesn't matter, though, because after eating this candy, I'm probably going to be making his next three BMW payments anyway. So, I'll just say, hey, this candy is fine, but it's nothing but caramel and honey mixed together, and it can be over-powering-ly sweet. As for the pick-me-up, all I can say is, yep, that's what sugar does. And the vitamin boost? Yeah sure, but a piece of fruit or a glass a milk could probably do the same. I have to say, this is not a bad product, but it's nothing more than a semi-natural candy masquerading as something (energy boost with vitamins) that it really is not. If you love visiting your dentist, schedule an appointment before you try this candy. If you'd just as soon stay as far away from your dentist for as long as possible, I think you need to stay away from this cavity catalyst candy.

review/summary: Individually Wrapped Drops with a Sweet Taste
review/text: The packages as shown contain 9 individually wrapped drops that look somewhat like cough drops. The list of ingredients includes sugar, corn syrup, milk, honey, butter, natural flavors, trace amounts of vitamin A and vitamins B6-0.66mg, B12-2mg, and C-20mg each at 33% of the recommended daily dosage; three drops providing then the listed minimum requirement.<br /><br />The amounts of vitamins C and B6 are so minimal as to be hardly worth mentioning; the amount of B12 is phenomenal if their information is correct. The DV for vitamin B12 is 2.4 mcg daily and the label claims 2mg or 2,000 mcg per drop or 6mg or 6,000 mcg with three drops. I suspect there's a typo there and it should read 2mcg, not 2mg since B12 is usually measured in mcg.<br /><br />In summary the drops are small and convenient, but expensive. If the B12 value is correct it has huge quantities of that B vitamin; other than that the cost is hard to justify.

Just because it has some vitamins thrown in, doesn't make it 'good for you'. I prefer energy bars with protein, like Power Bar or Clif. Even so, they don't take up much space in your pack, so you could keep them around for emergencies.

review/summary: Great taste!
review/text: The Ambrosoli Honees Energy plus Vitamin Caramels were absolutely delicious! You definitely get a caramel taste without the stickiness. I can't speak to the vitamin aspect but it does give you a little energy shake up. I kept a pack in my purse and during long tiring speeches, I sneaked one and it kept me awake. The wrappers are noisy but worth it!

review/summary: Tastes great... but where's the energy?
review/text: For the various energy products out there, whether drinks or bars or drops, the trick is to hit the right balance between flavor and effectiveness.  Plenty of them can keep you wired all night, but frankly taste terrible.  The "Honees Energy Plus" caramel drops are on the total opposite end of the spectrum.<br /><br />The drops taste great, much like a caramel flavored candy bar, but unfortunately provide basically no energy. Besides a relatively small amount of sugar, the only ingredients in the drops that would actually help give you a needed boost are the B6 and B12 vitamins.  Oddly the amounts are rather small, with only 33% of your daily recommended value of each. To compare to other energy products, a 5 Hour Energy short has 8333% of your daily value of B12 and 2000% of your daily value worth of B6.<br /><br />Whether just popping one or taking four at a time, these drops didn't give me any noticeable energy boost at all, although they are amazingly tasty.

review/summary: Tasty On-the-Go Boost
review/text: Tired of caffeine?  Me, too.  I have been trying as many alternatives that I can to the instant jolt of coffee and tea.  I have tried many solutions, as far reaching as NuSkin's "Vitality" TM to, well, this one.<br /><br />Ambrosoli's Honees Energy is good, tasty, and affordable--especially if time is more precious than money and you don't want to fumble with supplements.<br /><br />The product comes with 24 packs with about ten per pack.  It's a good way to start the morning or get energized before a workout.  It starts out as hard candy, and like Tootsie Pops before it, it melts in your mouth into an ooze of pure honey. All the C and B vitamins are there to boost your energy and help your well-being.<br /><br />While not the tastiest, Ambrosoli-Honees does the trick.

review/text: I was excited to try these honey drops, who doesn't want more energy?!  I definitely could use it at this time of year (the holidays).  The taste is pleasant enough.  It reminded me of a Japanese candy I remember eating when I was a kid.  Anyway, I never got that burst of energy I was hoping for.  The ingredients say that there are B6, B12, and C vitamins in the candy, but personally, I didn't notice any difference between this and any other candy.  If you love honey candy, then go for it.  But don't count on it to give you that burst of energy to get your holiday shopping list done!

review/text: This is good candy but as far as energizing you......I don't think so.  I will admit that I only got a single package to base my opinion on but I could not detect any "jolt" of energy from it. Maybe I wasn't lacking enough in energy to notice a difference but all I can say about it is that it does have a pleasant taste, however so does a lot of other candy (and this is coming from a real candy fanatic) that costs a lot less and is a lot more readily available!

review/text: I will admit, these are some tasty little candies. The outer shell reminded me of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FDCGYA">Werther's Original Hard Candies</a>. Once I reached the center, I was very pleased with the liquid honey core to be found there. Each package contains 9 pieces.<br /><br />This candy boasts 100% of the daily requirements  for B6, B12 and C, but that's only if you eat 3 pieces.<br /><br />When the package says "Instant Honey Energy", that's simply a fancy way of saying "It Gives You A Sugar Rush". It's tasty, it's sweet, but it's only a temporary burst of energy. Personally, I didn't feel any increase in energy, but that's just me.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you like sweet candies, this is a good choice...but I wouldn't use it as a vitamin supplement.

review/summary: Tasty and Peppy
review/text: Beware, these little gems taste better than candy! The Ambrosoli-Honees Energy Plus Vitamin Caramels are not only delicious, they also give you a little boost as well. When I received them in the mail, I put them to the side. Later that night, when I was writing on my computer, I decided to give them a try. Phew, if they weren't so good, I'd only have eaten one. But I opted for two in a row because this hard energy candy tasted better than most caramels I've tried...Big mistake. I couldn't get to sleep for a few more hours, haha. Now, with that said, it isn't like the Energy Plus Vitamin Caramels are full of caffeine or other energy pepping herbs. Instead, they are full of B-vitamins. So, I cannot honestly say that my brain or body were wired wirth nervous energy, like if I downed some hard-core energy drink. It was more of a mental boost with no crashing side-effect, which is a plus. I really like them and I am going to order some more just to keep around when I need to satisfy my sweet craving. The hard candy has a soft center with a mixture of honey/caramel flavor that satisfies my craving while giving me a slight boost. Perfect combo!

review/summary: Short Boost of Energy
review/text: The boost of energy they advertise is from the B12 and, of course, sugar you get from these caramel drops.  Shortly after eating one of these I feel I have a little more energy but it is pretty short lived.  One or two of these may be able to help get you through one of those after lunch meetings that normally tend to induce commas.  Unfortunately, some of the sweetener is from corn syrup.  20 calories and 5g carbs per drop.  Overall not bad for a quick sweet energy boost.

review/text: Well, it's fine if you want something sweet, but in order to get any "benefit" you're supposed to have 3 of these.  That would equal 15 g. carbs and 15 g. sugar--what?!?!?!  I think I'll stick with portable fruit (grapes, dried apricots, etc.) for MUCH less money, less sugar, and some fiber.  If you are looking for a tasty candy these might fit the bill, but they're darn expensive compared to Werthers or some other quality hard candy.<br /><br />I do not recommend these.

I will say, I didnt get any sort of "energy" from this.<br /><br />To get the full dose of 100% recommended doses, you have to eat 3 of these.  I did try one at a time at first & when nothing happened, I did try the 3... still nothing.<br /><br />I will say, the taste was wonderful & enjoyable.  Not what you expect for a vitamin... but still not sure I'd classify this as a vitamin.<br />Maybe it gave me the recommended vitamin for the day - but it definately didnt delivery on the energy.

review/text: I tried these and loved them. They are a great tasting hard candy that claims to have vitamins for a boost of energy. I never felt a boost of energy, but I had to restrain myself from eating a whole pack at a time for fear that I might overdose on B vitamins. I have never gotten B12 shots, but I have friends who swear by them. These candies did not give me anything like the boost they claim to get from the shots. I think that I preferred the honey candies over the caramel slightly, but both are good.

review/summary: Misleading advertising
review/text: These taste really good, and a lot of people could use more of the "B" vitamins, but it's only 33% of your RDA of vitamin "B". "B" vitamins are not easily absorbed by the body,  and usually to make any difference at all you need mega doses if they're taken orally. 33% is pretty much non-existent in terms of absorption, from what I've read.<br />I didn't notice any energy boost from the pack I ate, but that's the way vitamins are, if you need them, it's very very bad if you don't get them, but if you don't need them, you're just making expensive urine.<br />When my Dad had dementia, one of the things they tested for was "B" vitamin deficiency, that wasn't what caused his, but it's scary to think that not getting enough of just one vitamin could have been the culprit in something as severe as his dementia.<br />If it doesn't make a difference, you probably aren't deficient or the amount of vitamin is too small and it wasn't absorbed and you won't really get an "energy boost." The product is kind of misleading in claiming that.<br />It tastes good, it's nice candy, the vitamin "C" probably gets absorbed and the sugar will give you a rush, but I wouldn't count on this for vitamin "B", you need shots or a mega dose supplement for that.<br />I'd read up on "B" vitamins before buying these, they're expensive and I really doubt their efficacy. If you need "B" don't mess around, get shots and don't count on a candy to help you.

review/text: If you've had the regular "Honees" candy before, you will definitely enjoy these. They taste the similar but this product is caramel flavored in addition to to being honey filled and is infused with vitamins C, B12 and B6. If you've never had these before, these candies have a honey flavored sugar shell on the outside and are liquid-honey filled on the inside. If you love the taste of pure honey, you'll probably really enjoy these candies. I've loved the taste of honey since I could remember, so I really love these candies. I even use honey as a sweetener in my coffee, so I may be a bit biased in this review, lol. Anyways, there are 9 pieces of candy in each bar, and there are 24 bars in the box.  By the way, this product is imported from Italy, so it is pretty hard to find in stores.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Tastes very delicious<br />-Each candy provides 33% of your daily needs for Vitamins C, B12, B6. Eat 3 for nearly 100% :)<br />-Made in Italy.... which automatically makes it cool in my book ;)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The caramel flavor is good but sort of masks/overpowers the honey flavor.

review/summary: More like sugary candy than energy.
review/text: The Ambrosoli-Honees would be more accurately described as "Sugar Plus Vitamin" rather than "Energy Plus Vitamin" as the description states. They taste distinctively like a knock-off version of Werther's Original candies, just not nearly as tasty. They don't taste too bad, but let's call them for what they are: sugary "feel good" candy. The gooey "honey" center was really thick and tended to stick to my teeth pretty bad. While the B vitamins are nice, I think any minimal "energy boost" you get from them would be canceled out by the sugar rush and resulting crash from how sweet these are. They're decent as a feel good candy, but I can't justify the price and I personally would not purchase them for my own use.

review/text: After popping one of these in my mouth I couldn't help but taste the familiar caramel flavor immediately.  It is more of a subtle flavor after you are sucking on it for a while but overall it has a decent taste.  It is a hard candy, which is a little weird to get used to at first simply because when you taste caramel it is usually a soft handy.  When you get to the end there is a soft center that has a hint of coconut.  It is packed with 3 different vitamins so not only do you get the sugary treat of a caramel candy you also get a full dose of vitamins B and C (if you have three of them).  These are a hit and a miss for me.  On the one hand you get the nice caramel flavor, on the other it doesn't strike me as something that I will want to reach for again.

The outer part looks similar to a Werthers Original hard candy, but tastes nothing like it.  I've had imitation Werthers that had much more flavor than these.  I'm not impressed by adding a few vitamins and trying to pass it off as a healthy treat.  There are 9 to a pack at 20 calories each.  No fat, protein, or cholesterol.  So, they aren't bad for you.

review/summary: Great Mid-Afternoon Pick-Me-Up
review/text: Much of what is written in the review below is the same as what I had written for the Honey Drops. I do like the honey drops better because I am more partial to honey than caramel; however, I do like caramel. The last paragraph particularly expresses an advantage the caramel drop has over the honey drop:<br /><br />Most health-conscious adults know the importance of the combination of B-Complex Vitamins with C; yet, we also realize that our B6, B12, and C are water soluble vitamins-- meaning that whatever is not metabolized in our systems is lost in our unused fluids, whether it be by urination or perspiration. Some compensate for this loss through time-release vitamins, but there is a concern from some that certain time-release vitamins are not as natural as other forms, not as effective, or not as easily assimilated.<br /><br />Ambrosoli-Honees caramel-filled Energy Plus drop provides a tasty and effective alternative to time-release, as well as a natural alternative to the acrid potency of recent caffeine energy drinks.<br /><br />The hard candy exterior is delicious and not so hard that you cannot easily chew one or two up and get to the even more delicious honey center. I weigh well over 225 lbs. so I didn't seem to have the kind of energy surge from only one drop; but two or three drops at my weight allowed me to notice a bit of alertness and energy when my energy levels would have otherwise dropped off. That put me up to about 60 calories at 20 calories per drop; yet, with the energy boost received from the three drops, I know that my activity more than compensated for the caloric intake.<br /><br />The caramel drops do not seem to have the same down side as the honey drops. The honey drops may not store too well for long periods of time because the honey might seep through the end of the hard candy leaving you with a sticky wrapper. This doesn't seem to be the problem for the caramel drop.

review/text: This product reminds me of See's butterscotch drops. Each 'bar' is actually 9 individually wrapped caramel drops. Three drops represent 100% of the vitamins it advertises, so three servings per sleeve. I was wary of tasty vitamins, but these really do deliver. They won't replace your multivitamin or god nutrition, B12 isn't always that easy to get, so these are a real winner in my household.

Now, I like my caramels and this is a very tasty one (but I still prefer Werthers brand or See's)-however, I eat them infrequently since I am diabetic and I am  also lactase and lactose intolerant (allergic milk sugar and milk protein).<br />The added vitamins are negligible in my view with the amounts at 33% of the USDA recommended allowance per square.<br />I could see this being carried at a drug store or convenience store but not too likely at a Health food store.

review/text: Glad I had one. It tasted very good - honey caramel like but not excessively sweet.<br /><br />The rest my 3-yr old took, non-stop. And the roll was gone in 5-minutes. Should I have stopped him? Mmm...<br /><br />I think I need to buy more. Don't mind getting vitamins this way.<br /><br />Wait, as for energy - My 3-yr old did not take a nap after that. We went and mowed the lawn, which should have been my 9-yr old or hubby's job. After that we went to the park for the afternoon. Could be the sugar effect, whatever...

review/summary: The Best Candy-Size Choice Ever!
review/text: I've been using these at work, at lunch, and as a quick energy booster.  Wise usage of all natural sugars is advised, since the honey, especially, packs a real energy punch for the human system.<br /><br />I do not normally eat candy at all in a given year, but these are the best product I have ever seen yet, and all natural ingredients.  Portable, convenient, and powerful.

review/summary: Don't get the energy, but I like the caramel
review/text: The only reason I'm giving this product a three-star rating instead of a four-star rating is simple: There isn't really any "energy" in it.  Sure, there are calories & those are converted to energy and all that, but wouldn't that mean that basically ANY food can be considered an "energy" food?<br /><br />Regardless, these candies are actually quite tasty.  They have a nice caramel flavour on the hard outside and a nice chewy honey on the inside.  It's a great blend that I've not come across too often, but it works very well.  They also apparently have some vitamins in them, so that's another benefit you can throw on the pile.<br /><br />Overall, if you're looking for an energy boost to wake you up, do not reach for these.  You're better off with energy drinks (or, if you want healthy, just grab an apple. . . they help keep you up).  However, if you just want a nice little sweet in your pocket, these are definitely worthwhile.  Bit pricey, I'd say, but tasty.<br /><br />-AP3-

review/summary: nice, small, sweet, satisfying
review/text: I received one little packet. Each "caramel" is individually wrapped - thank goodness or they'd all probably stick together.<br />It is small, but not overwhelmingly small. It tastes like caramel(ish) and has a small "shell" of hardness before the gooey/soft inside, which doesn't really taste like honey. If it does, it blends in well with the caramel/sweet taste making it an enjoyable "chew." I like them and have found myself wanting them more and more.<br /><br />*It was actually kind of hard to put them down and restrain myself form eating them all in one sitting. :)

Seocnd they have good healthy ingreedents including honey and vitimine B. And Third, they give you a nice feeling of renewed energy. The only negative is that it uses sugar and corn sweetener, If I were them I would stop using the later. I can highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Can't Take Them Seriously
review/text: Ambrosoli Honees are candy, folks. The vitamin content in the drops looks almost like it was an accident. No protien? Even real honey has a gram or two of protien unless it's been so denatured that it's nutritionally valueless.<br /><br />It takes three drops to get 100% of the USDA recommended value of vitamin C, less than you'd get from eating one fresh orange. Along with the arificial vitamin C you'll get 60 calories (half of a can of sugary soda), 15gm carbs, 15 gm sugar, and still only nominal amounts of two or three other vitamins.<br /><br />These drops do more harm than good in my opinion. They're too sugary and deviod of any real nutritional value for me to take seriously.

review/summary: Yummy Energy Candy That You Can Easily Carry With You
review/text: Ambrosoli-Honees Energy Plus Vitamin Caramel "drops" are really more like candy. They are hard and rectangular. The outside candy has a nice caramel taste. The inside is a gooey, liquid and delicious honey. They are really tasty and I found that they did give me a decent amount of energy and did not make me jittery. I tested these drops out on a day when I only had two hours of sleep. I had one drop in the morning and one a few hours later. The only caffeine I had was in the form of some diet tea. They definitely helped me to stay awake.<br /><br />One package contains 9 "drops". While the serving size is 1 piece, three drops equal 100% of your daily value of Vitamins B6, B12 and C. While this may be a great way to get your vitamins and energy, they do have a down side. Each piece contains 5gm of Carbs and 5gm of Sugar. I really hope that they make a sugar free version of these in the future because they are great other than this. The drops are also caffeine free.<br /><br />Ingredients: Sugar, Corn Syrup, Milk, Honey, Butter, Natural Flavors, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, Vitamin C. **PLEASE NOTE THESE DROPS CONTAIN MILK. IF YOU ARE LACTOSE INTOLERANT, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE THEM**<br /><br />I love that I can toss these into my purse and have something with me that will really give me energy. As long as the carbs and sugar are not an issue for you, I highly recommend them. One pack will last you 3-9 days depending on how often you take them, at the current Amazon price (10/25/11), they are a little over $1.15 for a pack of 9. So, they are also a cheap way to get energy.<br /><br />PROS:<br />*great price for an energy product<br />*great tasting<br />*they give you a decent amount of energy<br />*you get 100% of your daily value of Vitamins B6, B12 and Vitamin C with 3 drops<br />*highly portable/small<br />*No caffeine or harmful additives<br />*May take care of your sugar fix and give you motivation to get off your booty at the same time :<br /><br />CONS:<br />*5gm of sugar each drop<br />*5gm of carbs each drop<br />*Hard on your teeth since they are hard candy & sugary

review/summary: ZZZZZZzzzzz snort!
review/text: I received a 1.45 oz package of these drops to evaluate. Not exactly enough to cause a sugar high.  That's nine drops, three for your "daily requirement". All I can attest to is the taste which is alright if you like cheap candy. The first ingredient is sugar, the second is corn syrup. I don't know if it's true but I've read that B12 is most effective by injection or sub-lingual.(dissolving the little pills under your tongue).<br /><br />In my opinion you'd be better advised to buy a trusted brand of mufti-vitamins and a bag of caramels if that's what you crave. If you don't like taking pills you could try the "gummy " candy type vitamins.

review/summary: Energy Plus  Mostly Minus
review/text: These Energy Plus candies are billed as "honey filled caramel drops". Each foil wrapped package contains nine small (1" x 1/2") rectangular candies that resemble European-style cough drops. The caramel outside is hard and when bitten into the soft honey filling oozes out. The caramel honey flavor is not bad, not scrumptious, just OK.<br /><br />The reason they are named "Energy Plus" is that in addition to sugar, corn syrup, milk, honey, butter, and natural flavors, the ingredients also include a middling amount of vitamins B6, B12, and C. Each 20 calorie candy contains about 35% of the daily recommended values (based on a 2000 calorie daily diet) of B6, B12, and C. Now let's understand that is is not a food. Other than 5g of carbohydrates and 5g of sugar there is no protein, no fiber, no fat, no cholesterol and no salt. This is a candy that has been fortified with three vitamins.<br /><br />One probably derives more of a sense of energy from the carbs and the sugar content rather than the B vitamins. It seems a better choice to have a really satisfying, tasty caramel candy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H322YQ">Werther's Original Creamy Caramel Filled Hard Candies, 5.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> and take a daily multivitamin <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FTVIFY">Centrum Performance Multivitamin, 60-Count</a> than consume these.<br /><br />On a positive note, these candies are manufactured by Ambrosoli in Como, Italy. If you've never visited beautiful Lake Como I highly recommend doing so. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046LUZVI">Lake Como & Its Surroundings (Travel Adventures)</a>.

review/summary: Decent
review/text: Okay so these don't taste bad at all.  And given that they have B vitamins that's saying a lot.  They are caramel flavored hard candy with a soft honey center.  20 calories per piece, 33% of B6, B12, and C.  The C can be had easily anywhere so I don't consider that much of a plus.  But B vitamins (imo) taste *nasty* and are the vitamin that make me nauseated anytime I take a multi vitamin.<br /><br />Since B vitamins do help me feel better if I'm dragging (as well as vitamin D) I will take it every so often and have to choke down the horsepills.<br /><br />If you have trouble taking vitamins but you need more B vitamin supplementation these may be the best way to get there.  I'm a big fan of the sugary/chewy method of taking vitamins when I have to take vitamins so take my advice in that context.  I don't take them often but I prefer the non-pill forms when I have to take them and this is the best non-pill form of vitamin B I have tried to date.<br /><br />For what you pay for this you get about two and a half months of 100% dv of B6 and B12.  Since most vitamins cost around ten bucks for a month's worth of any of the non-pill-forms these are priced about the same as any of the other solutions.  If you have trouble swallowing pills these kinds of solutions are worth it.

review/summary: Like the Added Vitamins, but Where is the Energy?
review/text: Ambrosoli Honees Energy Plus Vitamin- Caramel are simple little candies with added vitamins. They are drops that need to be dissolved in the mouth, releasing sweet caramel flavor and vitamins as they slowly dissipate.<br /><br />Honees Energy Plus Vitamin- Caramel have a pleasant flavor that is very much like a piece of caramel flavored hard candy. In essence, that is exactly what they are: Candy, but with added vitamins. They are sweet and pleasant to eat, with a sugary sweetness that most will find pleasant enough to recommend. And they have added B6, B12, and C vitamins for good health and other benefits.<br /><br />I have nothing against placing additional vitamins in my body and Honees Energy Plus Vitamin- Caramel are certainly better than the average candy for that reason alone. Supposedly, they offer an energy benefit as well, but I cannot see how one of these small drops should be expected to add energy. Looking at the ingredients, sugar is about the only significant energy- enhancing ingredient, but even the sugar content isn't that much and it isn't nearly enough to boost one's overall energy level. I felt no different after taking one of these than I did before.<br /><br />Honees Energy Plus Vitamin- Caramel are relatively inexpensive and they do offer more than standard candy, so I suppose they have their usefulness. I wish there was some actual energy enhancement because it would come in very handy during the mid afternoon when I often find myself feeling a little sluggish at work. But the product does have added vitamins and a pleasant caramel taste, and this is enough to convince me to award these with an average rating overall.

review/text: It's difficult to remember, eating these, that they're supposed to be vitamin supplements.  As other reviews have already said, they're small hard candies.  Sweet, but not too sweet, tasting more like honey than caramel.<br /><br />I can't say I really notice any difference in energy, however.  I know there's a great push for energy supplements these days, but I think these would be better marketed as vitamins (or candy) than energy supplements.<br /><br />The taste was pretty good, but I won't be getting these again, mostly because I can't imagine that regular intake of hard candies would be too easy on teeth, although they're nice once in a while.

review/summary: Not a "health food"... not particularly good candy either.
review/text: I was curious when I saw these "Honey Filled Caramel Drops".  The largest printing on the wrapper reads "Energy Plus". The "plus", I guess, is that each lozenge comes with 1/3 the daily requirement of vitamins B6, B12 and C.<br /><br />Nine lozenges come in each wrapper, and this listing is for a box of 24 of these - so 216 lozenges total.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients, in the order listed on the label:<br /><br />Sugar<br />Corn Syrup<br />Milk<br />Honey<br />Butter<br />Natural Flavors (I always love that one...)<br />Vitamin B6<br />Vitamin B12<br />Vitamin C<br /><br />And I guess some lawyer made them write again (in case you missed it in the previous sentence): Contains: Milk<br /><br />So... are they good "vitamins"?  They taste better than my multi-vitamin... but they aren't exactly multi-vitamins, are they?  You have to eat 3 to get your minimum daily requirement of B6, B12 and C, then you're still short of vitamins A, D, etc.<br /><br />Are they good "caramels" - Not by any American expectation of "caramel", but they're imported from Italy and if you broaden your American definition of caramel to "sugar-filled treat", it fits the bill.  They're not particularly nutritional poison - despite 2 ingredients being "milk" and "butter" it lists the fat and cholesterol as 0, and they're only 20 calories per piece.<br /><br />To cut to the chase: I won't be getting these again.  They're not suitable as a vitamin substitute, and they're not tasty enough to find their way into my "treat" rotation.

I wasn't surprised by the list of ingredients. Primarily Sugar, Corn Syrup, milk, honey, flavorings and vitamins. I had something similar to these when I was growing up, so there is a nice association with these chewy little confections. Yes, they have a bit of vitamins in them, but really, are you eating them for any reason except the flavor? A nice occasional sweet treat.

review/text: I was disappointed that these are not caramels- the description should read " caramel-flavored hard candies" as that is what  these are.<br /><br />However, I was not disappointed in the taste- these are made of largely natural ingredients, and they taste like it.<br />The " liquid honey" center is more chewy than liquidy.

review/summary: sweet honey caramels + vitamins = thinking energy
review/text: These Energy Plus candies are really tasty.  They taste like a hard caramel which eventually gives way to a soft honey center.  They have a modest amount of vitamins in each drop: 33% of your daily recommended value of two of your B vitamins and also C.  I don't notice any vitamin flavor, which is nice.<br /><br />The sugar content is pretty moderate (5 gm), mostly because you are spending a long time sucking on a small portion.<br /><br />I enjoy having these around during my work day.  I find that small hard candies are a nice little treat and energy boost throughout the day (for long days doing computer work, in my case).<br /><br />Likes:<br />- Very tasty.<br />- Moderate sugar and calories (10 minutes of enjoyment for 5 gm sugar and 20 calories).<br />- B vitamins give me an energy boost.<br />- Natural ingredients:  Sugar, corn syrup, milk, honey, butter, natural flavors, B + C vitamins.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />- The gooey center is a personal preference.. Sometimes I wish these were solid so they would last longer and not be quite so sweet at the end.

While you'd have to 3 of them to get a full serving of your Vitamins B6, B12 and C, they are a clever way of getting kids of taking their vitamins.

Each piece is really about the size of a Starburst candy so my personal vibe was that eating a few tiny squares wouldn't be giving me any extra energy on top of all the other coffees, (diet) red bulls, and cliff bars I frequently consume.<br /><br />  They did taste pretty natural and I could taste the honey.  I might eat them again for a sweet tooth fix but at $1+ per pack and non-filling I'll probably stick to cliff bars and just secretly raid my office neighbor's starburst jar for a sweet tooth fix here and there.  Overall I give 3 stars out of 5 in consideration of price/value and other alternatives out there.

review/summary: Not a bad candy
review/text: This candy tasted good. A real honey flavor. The ingredients don't state much honey though, mainly sugar. I liked knowing I was getting 33% of a few vitamins while eating it. I cannot feel any extra energy, but then who feels something when they take a vitamin? I'll tell you who, someone who should be seeing a doctor not eating candy. I take this candy after a meal so I can absorb the vitamins better. Vitamin C and B6, B12 can be taken at higher doses without side effects, so If I take a multivitamin at diner time on top of this, It won't be overkill. While the product stated pack of 24. I only got 1 pack. This is not a reflection on the product, but it may be a reflection of the ordering process of this product.

review/text: I liked the taste of the caramel flavored energy chews, but I did not notice any significant energy improvement. I'm a candy eater and I found myself wanting to eat them all at one time (greedy, I know), but I didn't.  Maybe if I had, I would have gotten that jolt I was looking for.  Overall, the taste is good, but there was no noticeable change in energy.

review/summary: Hard Caramel Goodness
review/text: For the most part.  These candies are tasty, although one of the selling points (honey in the center) seems largely pointless to me.  It's what I enjoyed least, actually.  However, they are tasty, and since they're packed with B vitamins, you could certainly do a lot worse.  20 calories each and a third of your B's with each one.  No weird aftertaste, either.  Worth your money, definitely.  If they could just do something about the honey...

review/text: I don't know.<br /><br />All I know is that these energy drops taste really good, no weird aftertastes, and I feel a "pep in my step" after only having just one.<br /><br />I am going to start getting these as a much welcomed alternative to energy drinks and shots.  All my body needs is some B vitamins in the form of something tasty.<br /><br />This will be a main staple in my book bag.

review/text: These are hard caramel flavored candies with a soft honey interior.  Laced with vitamins, I cannot see much energy benefit.  More energy in a tablespoon of honey.  Not a bad taste, but not great either.  Still, a sweet treat with vitamins?  I guess that's better than some alternatives.

review/summary: Better for you than candy
review/text: I can't really say that these candies are giving me any more energy than I would get from having a Starburst, however, they do contain some vitamins and are caffeine free.  I have been taking one every afternoon as a pick-me-up instead of buying some garbage, and eating just one piece seems to do the trick. So if you're looking for something handy and better for you than just plain sugar, this is a very good option.  They're also very tasty which is definitely a bonus. I will be purchasing more of them in the future to keep in my purse whenever I need a little extra something.

review/summary: Good flavor with vitamin content - worthwhile
review/text: First impression upon unwrapping, each piece is a bit on the small side.  Upon eating, it is as a hard candy which gradually melts in mouth with a good flavor while melting.  Finally, once the outside melts, the inside is soft and chewy and also has a good flavor. In that this product has some vitamin content in addition to an enjoyable flavor, I think it's a worthwhile buy, providing the price is not too high.

review/summary: Pleasant Tasting High Calorie Candy
review/text: The product is a "granola bar" looking silver foil packet containing nine individually wrapped candy lozenges.  Each lozenge contains 20 calories of "sugar, corn syrup, milk, honey, and butter" (actually labelled that way, in that order, on the wrapper).  The product is actually manufactured in Italy by the G. B. Ambrosoli Ronago company, and imported by Andre Prost, Inc. of Old Saybrook, Connecticut.  The label goes on to say that "Honees" is a registered trademark of Andre Prost, Inc.<br /><br />At a time when people all across America are spending $ billions on little tiny bottles of caffeine marked "one hour energy," it appears that the Prost company is trying to cash in on the "energy" fad with a more honest approach that simply provides a blast of sugar. They have added vitamins B6, B12, and C to the product, so that three lozenges contains 100% of the daily requirement of these vitamins.<br /><br />Its very pleasant tasting.  Its got a nice caramel flavor, and the liquid honey center is a very nice reward at the end.  And I'm a person who enjoys the taste of honey and its benefits for a sore throat who is also aware of its high caloric density.  I was surprised that its only listed as the fourth most common ingredient; perhaps because honey is so much more expensive than sugar.<br /><br />For someone who normally enjoys hard candy (I'm not - my dentist advises against it.), "Honees Energy Plus" might be a nice addition to the product choices.  When I ordered the product, I was expecting a granola bar type experience, not a hard candy.  I suppose they are hoping people will overlook the calories to focus on the vitamins and energy.  Its a worthy idea.  Yet the candy, energy, and throat lozenge categories are all busting with product entries and are very competitive.

review/summary: Healthy??
review/text: When you read the ingredient listing on the package you quickly learn that sugar, corn syrup and honey are listed as part of the ingredients of this "healthy" hard candy with a chewy center. At 5 grams of carbohydrate per piece they are not bad as candies go. Healthy? well if three of them gives you your recommended daily requirement of Vitamins B6,B12,and C then they are healthy enough for that. Plus<br />they could be seen as a good replacement for cough drops and throat lozenges. The<br />taste is okay, something between honey and caramel not enough of either to make an impact though.

review/summary: Good tasting delight
review/text: I liked these. Unlike some of the reviewers, I immediately tasted the caramel. The addition of vitamins is a plus, but alas, they contain lots of sugar, so there is a trade off. The honey center is a nice touch. According to the product description, three of the drops provide 100% of vitamins B12, B6 and C. But many of the other needed vitamins are missing, so you'd still need an additional supplement if your goal is to get all of your daily vitamins. But if you're a caramel and/or honey fan, you may want to give these a try.

review/summary: It's Just Candy, Folks
review/text: This is nothing but candy "fortified" with a nearly insignificant amount of vitamins. A little honey. Some sugar. Some corn syrup. And a few grains of vitamins mixed in. Candy. You'd get the same energy from just about any caramel candy, and the vitamins are so scant that it's not going to impact you one way or the other.<br /><br />But put a couple of grains of vitamins in candy, call it "energy plus", and it apparently makes it easier for some folks to justify having a piece of hard candy. And since it doesn't taste as good as a good quality caramel candy, some folks can convince themselves that the poor taste is the trade-off for candy that's "good for you."<br /><br />If you want some candy, get some good candy. At least you'll enjoy your vice more. If you're looking for something healthy, this isn't it.

review/summary: Small Fireballs - Ugh
review/text: I was so disappointed when I received my package.  I ordered these for my husband for Christmas as he loves them but I was expecting the 'LARGE' fireballs.  I wish the distributors would specify in their description whether the fireballs are 'small' or 'large'.  I was under the assumption that since it was a 3lb bag, it would be the large fireballs.  I still have the container from the last time I ordered Atomic Fireballs and it had the weight listed as 3lbs so I thought I would be receiving 3 lbs of large fireballs.  I am still debating on whether to return them or not.  I am going to wrap them and let my husband open them for Christmas.  I will leave it up to him whether or not I will return them and search yet again for the 'LARGE' fireballs.  What a bummer because I love them too..the big ones!

review/summary: Crazy Jerky
review/text: Ok, to preface this, I AM A VEGETARIAN. With that being said, I haven't had REAL beef or turkey jerky in quite some time and I have been missing it dearly. Having tried many vegetarian jerkies I can honestly say that this is by far the best! Most soy based jerkies are strangely on the oily side and the flavors are usually off. Being a "dry style" jerky fan I am pleased with the chewiness of Stonewall's and the WILD flavor. I have tried most of the other varieties of Stonewall's but none seemed to please me as much as the WILD. I'm also on Weight Watchers and have found that they are fairly low on points (4pts per bag) and are a great source of protein for vegetarians (14g). Be warned, the WILD is quite WILD, spicy spicy but in a good way!

They are moist and chewy, but not so chewy that you're still chewing to make it swallowable after all the flavor's gone.  I think they struck a nice balance.<br /><br />A caveat: If you're used to Tofurky Jurky or Primal Spirit, these will strike you as a little bit airy.  Also, these are a bit higher in fat than the other brands: 8 or 9 grams per 160-calorie package.  These ones don't really feel too oily in your mouth, though.
