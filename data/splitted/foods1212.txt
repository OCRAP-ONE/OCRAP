review/text: Diamond walnuts - great- and if you heat them up for about 2 minutes it brings out the oils and enhances the flavor, add them to oatmeal and it adds a little crunch.

review/summary: Not much flavor.
review/text: I ordered and received these walnuts in January 2011.  The expiration date on the packages is December 2012.  There's not much flavor to these walnuts.  If you heat them up, the flavor is only somewhat there. If you're looking for flavorful walnuts, the kind that when you open the package there's a burst of rich walnut aroma, these are not for you.  I just wonder whether there is a correlation between loss of flavor and loss of nutrients. I'm giving these two stars because the price was very inexpensive.  I paid $28.39 for 6 lbs.  I would not use these to cook or bake anything special. Stick with buying fresh walnuts from an open bin in a store with a lot of turn over where you can smell them, maybe even sample them, before buying.  They will, of course, cost more, but they will taste more like walnuts.

review/summary: Fresh and Nutty!
review/text: I have ordered these walnuts twice and been very happy with them. Both times, they have been fresher than the nuts that I usually buy at the grocery store, and cheaper too.<br /><br />The only drawback to this product is that I end up with six pounds at a time.  In order to deal with the large quantity and keep them fresh, I store them in the refrigerator.  The upside of this is that I have been snacking on them instead of on junk food, and that I have been adding them to all sorts of food, from my breakfast cereal to the cookies that I bake.  Since nuts are supposedly really healthy to eat, I guess that getting six pounds of them at a time is OK.

review/summary: bait and switch
review/text: We subscribed to the diamond walnut offer December of 2010.  Price was very reasonable (About $4.00 per bag w/ free shipping)  Got our first shipment as promised.  Everything was just as they said.  AS it got closer to the time to get our next shipment, Amazon sent us an e-mail reminding us that if we wanted to change the frequency, we could do that. Since we still had (3) bags left, I decided to bump the order back a few weeks.  I noticed when I got the delivery confirmation, the price had jumped to over $6.00 per bag.  Now I understand food prices do rise and fall on occassion but to jump that much in less than a month, was very fishy. I felt like they had done a bait and switch on the pricing.  Good product if you're willing to spend the  money.

Otherwise besides the capacity issue this carousel works flawlessly, it's balanced so when you rotate it there isn't a tendency to tip and the matte black finish is easy to match with the rest of the kitchen and resists abrasion well.

review/summary: Great little T-Disc holder.
review/text: It would take some real trying to get something like this wrong. On the other hand, it would take a lot of thought to get something like this more "right" than others and Nifty obviously put a lot of thought into it. It's well balanced, even when loaded down in one slot and not the other 3. It's nice and compact so it fits pretty much anywhere. Plus, it matches my kitchen so, bonus points from the wife!

review/summary: The best truffle oil to buy
review/text: This product uses a neutral oil, and conveys truffle flavor in the cleanest way possible, without having actual truffles.  I find the olive oil-based versions inferior in truffle flavor.  Excellent on risotta or similar seafood-rice dishes, some salads, some cheeses.  Always keep some in the cupboard to add the "wow" to the right dish.

Now, I don't usually like maple flavor at all because it can be very overpowering, but these little gems have just the right amount of taste.<br /><br />240 calories with 4 g of protein and 4% of calcium (according to the label) and it's a great little treat now and then!

review/summary: Awesome canned fruit option
review/text: I was thrilled to find some of my favorite tropical fruits available from this company in convenient pull-top cans suitable for stashing in my desk at work.  The fact that they are organic and in fruit juice rather than syrup is another big plus.  The mango chunks in the cans I've had so far were certainly not mushy; they were nice, tender, non-stringy, well-sized chunks that held together, in a nice juice.  It may need to be noted to some that mango juice is not a clear juice.  The texture of the fruit resembles a ripe (but not mushy) fresh peach - as it is supposed to.  I think that some people may not realize that the rock-like "fresh" mangoes typically sold in the grocery store are usually neither ripe, nor will they ripen properly.  Mangoes are supposed to be consumed when ripe and soft, not hard.

review/text: I like to consider myself an expert on dirty martinis. Most people<br />think just buying a good vodka or gin is the answer. They are sorely<br />mistaken. The olive juice is what you need to perfect. Fortunately,<br />it has been done for all of us.  Dirty Sue is by far the best olive<br />juice on the market. I was introduced to it at a party and it is<br />fantastic. Most other brands (and I've tried them all) are basically<br />salt water with a hint of olive. Dirty Sue is the perfect blend. It<br />actually has a very nice olive flavor with a subtle bite of salt. I<br />don't know how they do it, but please, keep doing it!

review/summary: Suprised by the good reviews. Simply not the same.
review/text: I was very excited to find this product after experiencing the common problem of the olive juice running out long before the olives. The many positive reviews made buying this a no-brainer. However, once I mixed my first drink it became very apparent  this was not the same brine you will get out of a jar of olives. This olive juice has a very odd taste and has almost a sweet twinge to it. I saw some similar reviews to mine and I wonder if we've all received bad batches. I may contact Dirty Sue directly and see if they'd be willing to send me a replacement. I've made a few drinks hoping I would get used to it but I haven't. I now have 3-1/2 bottle of this stuff that I'll never use.<br /><br />If anyone else is as disappointed as I am, I tried a couple of homemade brine recipes that are FAR superior to this product. Mix 4 cups water, 1/2 cup kosher salt, 1 tbs white vinegar and just refill the jar with this mixture.

I bought a 4 pack at sight and the rest is history.<br /><br />This taste great with a perfect mix/balance of olive taste and saltiness to make the Martini taste perfectly dirty.  You can use olive brine, but its wasting a jar of olives every time...no point.<br /><br />Get some and try it...you will not be disappointed.

review/text: I like my martinis EXTRA Dirty, Extra Dry and Extra Quick....  This product saved my fridge from being packed full of olive jars sans the brine because I was constantly robbing those poor luscious olives of their delicious habitat because I NEEDED it for my cocktail.<br /><br />Dirty Sue is a great product. Smartly packaged, wicked cool looking on your kitchen shelf and even more impressive serving it if your name is SUE!  My eye caught a review on here "too dirty"...  um, then you use less of this concentrate in your dirty martini...  It does take a couple of tries to get the right amount of product needed to create the perfect martini "to one's own taste" and it may seem pricey, but for me, it saves me serious money because I have not, since, run out and paid for olives just so I could dump the juice in my vodka.<br /><br />Place this item in your shopping cart if you LOVE Dirty Martinis!

review/text: We have tried several brands of olive juice.  We love extra dirty vodka martinis.  Dirty Sue is the best, but the most expensive.  The "Saucy Momma" brand is in second place and is much cheaper.  Dirty Sue has a better flavor than Saucy Momma.  And, with Saucy Momma, there is some white oily substance that floats in the martinis and makes many people not want to drink it.

review/text: I followed what I thought were the mixing instructions on the bottle and found that the flavor of the Dirty Sue mix was much too strong.  Needless to say, I had an incorrect ratio of vodka to Dirty Sue.  The second time that I fixed a martini I followed the directions found on DirtySue.com which is as follows:<br /><br />THE DIRTY SUE<br />3 ounces of your favorite gin or vodka<br />1/2 ounce of Dirty Sue<br />Shake over ice and strain into a chilled martini glass. Garnish with two olives.<br /><br />This recipe allows for 25 martinis per bottle of Dirty Sue....Wot a bargain!<br /><br />DirtySue.com has quite a few of interesting martini recipes on their site.

review/summary: Top Grade Primo Olive Juice
review/text: When it comes to Dirty Martinis accept no second grade substitute.  Dirty Sue is hands down the finest Olive Juice developed for dirty Martinis on the planet.  Don't go another day trying to extract that second grade garbage from the jar of olives in your fridge.  If you try a single bottle of Dirty Sue, you won't be able to forgive yourself for all those Dirty Martinis you dared to drink that didn't have Dirty Sue in them!<br /><br />Per bottle ordering these off Amazon instead of from Dirty Sue's actual site appears to be more expensive.  Unless of course you use Amazon's Super Saver shipping.  In that case, ordering off of Amazon is far cheaper than ordering directly from Dirty Sue.

review/summary: Dirty sue...I love you!
review/text: Being one that loves a dirty Ketel One or Grey Goose martini, I have been<br /> searching for the best olive juice to use.  The juice from the jar is OK, but<br />but not consistent and I always run out of juice before I run out of olives.<br />This is by far the smoothest, most consistent tasting juice around!

review/summary: So Glad I found this!
review/text: Like others have mentioned, I frequently ran out of olive juice before running out of olives and was so grateful to find Dirty Sue. I have tried other brands of olive juice and many have had a fake, metallic taste to them. Dirty Sue tastes fabulous and makes a great dirty martini. We no longer worry about running out of the juice in the olive jar. I will be ordering more of this!!

review/summary: Dirty Sue or Nothing!
review/text: I obtained my first bottle of Dirty Sue as a "freebie" that came with a bottle of potato vodka. The vodka sucked, but the Dirty Sue ROCKS.<br /><br />I will never use olive brine again and end up with all of the leftover dried up olives in the jar.<br /><br />Dirty Sue makes a huge difference in the taste of the martini. DS martinis are so much better than those made with regular brine....just say "No" to olive brine from a jar.  Friends don't let friends make martinis with olive brine from a jar.<br /><br />Ask your local bar to carry Dirty Sue !!

review/summary: "Too" dirty
review/text: The Original Dirty Sue Dirty Martini Mix was o.k., but just a bit "too" dirty, for my taste. In order for the martini to be more to my liking, more vodka had to be added. After two martinis, I was blitzed or well on my way!<br />When following the directions,on the bottle, for mixing a martini it tasted as if it was totally olive brine.<br />The mix will suffice "in a pinch".

review/summary: Best Olive Juice I've tasted!
review/text: I bought a bottle of Master Martini Gold Dirty Martini mix from the local liquor store.  I tasted awful...like chemicals.  They should be ashamed to call it Dirty Martini mix.  When I received the Dirty Sue Dirty Martini Mix, I had my fingers crossed...and I was not disappointed.  It has a real olive taste! It is the best dirty martini mix that I have ever had! It only has 2 drawbacks---1)it isn't available in local stores and 2) the bottles aren't larger.  Can't wait until Amazon carries the larger bottles.

review/summary: Perfect compliment to my vodka
review/text: I am a dirty martini drinker. I love vodka with my "salad." I received a package with 2 bottles of Dirty Sue for my birthday and it is fantastic. First of all, its nice that I don't have to use olive juice that fingers have been in digging out olives. Secondly, it taste great. The flavor is clean and just right so neither the vodka nor the brine overpower the other. I now keep a bottle at my favorite bar so my bartender, Ryan, can make a perfect martini. Great job guys. You have a loyal customer.

review/summary: Change of Heart and Opinion!
review/text: January 21, 2010<br /><br />Okay, so I was wrong...<br /><br />This stuff, once I was corrected by Mr. Martini, has really come around for me. The mistake I made was adding vermouth to the mix, when only your chosen liquor and Dirty Sue are needed. What a difference it made. Went to Dirty Sue's website, checked the various recipes, and had at it. The Tequila recipes are pretty good too, but the Classic Martini is my favorite. I will buy this product again, and spread the word to other Martini lovers.<br /><br />Was baffled at the lower price for the same product at the website, so why are we paying more on Amazon?<br /><br />I have raised the rating to 4 Stars from 1, and not a 5 Star Rating, only because the makers of Dirty Sue should've had preparation instructions on the label. I couldn't read my ex-wife's mind, nor can I read Dirty Sue's.<br /><br />Previous Post with One Star Rating:<br /><br />Awful, Just Awful!<br /><br />I had such high hopes for this product, but was left disappointed by it's taste as it ruins perfectly good Vodka and Gin. I didn't mind the saltiness, but found that same saltiness overpowers the cocktail, subduing the taste of fine liquors. I could not find a balance that worked for me, and there is no guidance whatsoever on the packaging as to what a perfect combination would be using this product.<br /><br />The biggest problem was that Dirty Sue masked the true flavor of a Martini, and took away "the bite" of the liquor. Also, I did not care for the cloudy structure of the brine, and learned with this product that I lean towards a clear & cleaner tasting brine, which is what you get at most bars and in olive jars.<br /><br />Be aware: You cannot return this product, and you could be stuck with 4 bottles that you may not use, as I was.

review/text: Dirty Sue Dirty Martini Mix solves the age old problem of how to get enough olive juice flavor to create the perfect dirty martini.  Not only do you have a ready supply of the key ingredient, but it is also far more intense in flavor and superior in taste to what's in your jar of olives.  I can't recommend it highly enough.

review/summary: Best Dirty Martini Ever...
review/text: If you're a dirty martini drinker, and have several full bottles of olives in your frig, like me, with NO juice left, then your're really going to appreciate Dirty Sue Martini Mix. It's the real thing... makes an excellent martini and you save money in the long run over buying bottled olives primarily for the juice. I highly recommend the product. Even if you use less than "top shelf" vodka, for instance, Dirty Sue gives the drink a very good flavor. So, respect the olive and try Dirty Sue Martini Mix.

review/summary: Here is the secret....
review/text: Dirty Sue is a very good product but it is not as good as the juice directly from a jar of olives.<br /><br />The trick is to use the Dirty Sue to top off your olive jar.  I will take the Dirty Sue, refill the olive jar and then give it a very good shake and put it back in the fridge.  By doing this the DS becomes infused with the real olive essence and then becomes perfect for dirty martinis.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Astonished
review/text: I am completely astonished that this product garners such high reviews. I bought it as an avid consumer of "Dirty Martinis" in hopes of recreating the excellent ones at my local bars in Frederick MD and as such expected that the addition of this olive juice to Grey Goose, Belvedere or Ketel One, all premium brands, would result in a dirty vodka martini of high quality. Instead I was struck speechless, (briefly), by the insipid and decayed taste of Dirty Sue. Either my taste buds are decaying or the product is. I looked in the mirror and went to my local bar and ordered a dirty martini and discovered that it was not me.<br />The terms sherry, as in the decline of a wine to an undrinkable beverage, came to mind when I tasted it. I was initially concerned that I had added too much Dry Vermouth to the mix, so I halved the usual proportions from 6 parts vodka to 1 part of vermouth to an extremely dry 12:1 and still felt the problem was the Dirty Socks. For those of you who feel that a true vodka martini is essentially pure vodka plus ????? cold, I can't help you. Try shots. Olives optional.<br />Perhaps I just got a bad batch, (like the other negative reviewers), but for now I am planning on using the juice from high quality olives from the barrels of olives from my "local" olive emporium, (currently South Street Philly). Sorry Sue, I can't recommend you. I will try to get my local bartenders to reveal their secret sauce, but so far they all profess ignorance of DS.

review/text: I purchased this product because Amazon was out of the 1888 Dirty Martini Mix and hubby was getting close to needing an Olive Juice.  Last night he tried this Juice and said this is pretty good Juice.  Being a man of few words I did try to get him to elaborate just a bit so I asked him if he preferred this juice over the 1888.  He answer....This is pretty good.

review/text: I love the product.  However, so far one bottle was good, the second bottle (which I brought as a gift to a party) smelled like old gym socks.  So I still have two unopened bottles and will revise my review once I see if the last two bottles are good or bad.  Also Amazon does not give you an opportunity to communicate with them about the issue, so my only option is to return, or write a review.

review/text: Dirty Sue is THE BEST mix ever for dirty martini's. You wont even care if you have an olive or not. That being said I was dissappointed to see the size of the bottle when they arrived. The information is clearly labeled I just assumed it would be 750ml and not the 375ml that arrived. I should have done the math! That made me not feel so swell about the price. Not the product but the price. If a local store carries Dirty Sue you can buy a 750ml bottle for almost $3 less each, than these cost.
