review/summary: Great food at a fair price
review/text: Nature's Variety is a great food at a fair price!  This food has none of the typical cheap fillers that most store bought dog foods have, like corn, soy, and wheat.  It also has no artificial preservatives, like ethoxyquin, BHA, or BHT.  I also like that you can rotate between proteins with minimal/no digestive upset, since the main formula is the same, aside from the meat source.  Every time I buy a 30lb bag, I change proteins.  They have chicken, beef, lamb, salmon, and venison.<br /><br />I've fed Nature's Variety to two of my four dogs for the past three years- their coats look great, and they have been exceptionally healthy since being on the food.  I highly recommend this food!

review/text: I can't imagine making a sweet potato pie or pumpkin pie without this! Making a pie and only needing Grandma Maud's Pie Fixin', sweet potato or pumpkin, butter and water is amazing. With my career cooking can be time consuming, but to be able to give my family pies made in their own kitchen without the hassle makes me a hero in my house!

review/summary: Oil is comparable to others - seller is lacking
review/text: I have used Lavender Essential Oil for years and loved the idea that these were food grade.  I ordered 7 different oils about a month ago - at the time of this purchase - but have only received 5.<br /><br />First the oils: They are mostly comparable to other brands but seem a thinner and do not seem to last as long as others - I expect that is due to the food grade. The bottles do not come with droppers - this makes it difficult to use as everything with essential oils is based on drops.  Depending on how often I actually use in food - I may or may not purchase this brand of lavender again.  The price is good but if I have to buy my own dropper tops it outweighs the better price.<br /><br />The company - faerie's finest - I was okay with the delay I was informed of on two of the oils in this purchase; however, when I recently emailed them to find out when those two oils would arrive I was informed that they were supposedly mailed before the date I was told there would be a delay.  When the issue is resolved - I will update this review.  In the interim, I will not recommend the seller nor will I buy from them again.  Which is unfortunate as they have nice selection of essential oils.

review/summary: Faint smelling.
review/text: Hi,<br /> Online it says 100% pure lavender oil.  I use lavender oil religously and this does not smell like other pure lavender oils I've recieved in the past. The smell is faint and it is a little more 'perfume' smelling. I did notice on the bottle it says a 100% natural oil not a 100% pure lavender oil.  Online it states that it is a 100% pure lavender oil.  I wrote them and they wrote, "Thanks. We are sorry to hear that. Your can return for refund. But this is 100% Pure lavender oil, no mixed, no chemical.".. Too return it you would have to pay shipping back plus you are out the shipping you paid to recieve it too.  All in all if you are looking for a strong lavender smell this is not it. There responce was fast so I will give them the benifit of dout, so giving 3 stars for an okay rating. Thanks

review/summary: love it!
review/text: I ordered this oil from "Enchanted Wilderness...Catey13" and am not sorry that I did!  I absolutely love lavender and when I finally recieved this oil, it smelled just as I imagined or better!  The concentration is strong and just a few drops go a really long way.  I've already used it in bath salts, a body scrub, a face moisturizer, linen spray and glycerin water and the bottle is still almost completely full.  Seems like this amount could last me for years!  I use the linen spray on my bed and it really makes the whole room smell wonderful and the bed seems "fresher" for a longer time between weekly washings.  The price was very reasonable and I even received a surprise sample of some rose geranium oil and some recipes and suggested uses with my order.  Also, the bottle does not have a dropper top, but there was a pipette included which works just fine.  Looking forward to trying it in lavender shortbread cookies next.  Would definitely order this again!

review/summary: Don't listen to the naysayer - these are superb!
review/text: I don't know about the person who didn't care for these much and gave only one star - that person gave no reasons. So I can only imagine that they have an excessively sweet tooth and probably like a fatty taste - which is what you get with most of the other products out there that make their stuff just too downright sweet and frankly also use questionable ingredients as sweeteners<br /><br />I think Nana does a great job.  Now I think so does Pamela's kitchen, so it isn't the only game in town. But Pamela puts out a very different product.  One of the really good things about Nanas in addition to the fact I think it is really well done, is that they are individually wrapped, so nothing starts to go stale or dry out after the package is opened, and it is really easy to pack these things with lunch or to have as a snack during the day.  They can be a tad on the dry side - not too much but probably for some people.  So have tea or the like ready.

review/summary: Chocolate Chip = YUMMY!!!!
review/text: Initially, I thought these were pretty expensive cookies but I think they're totally worth the money! My daughters don't have food allergies but I do limit their sugar intake. I really like the face that these cookies are sweet only from juices and not refined sugar. We bought the chocolate chips and I think they taste just like any typical chocolate chip cookie. My very-picky four-year-old can't get enough. I only wish they were a bit cheaper but I understand that with quality ingredients, etc. comes a price tag so I'm willing to fork out the bucks for these yummy cookies.

review/summary: Pleasantly surprised...
review/text: Ok, I was pleasantly surprised by the grape. It was the first Walden Farms product that I tasted and am happy to say, I will enjoy this product. Now let me state right now, I dont normally like diet flavors and this one is not perfect but you put this on a pb&j sandwich and you will be happy. Is it exactly like regular grape jelly, no! The consistency is more gelled then regular jelly and the grape flavor is a diety grape flavor. It doesn't spread very well, but I never had much luck with regular grape jelly spreading all that great either. For a person that wants to remove the carbs and the calories, I think this is a fine product indeed. I am taking one star off for how hard it is to spread but overall I think its worth it for those that need to curb the sweet tooth without putting all those sugars into your system. I have also bought a few other walden farms no calorie stuff since trying this grape jelly and have been happy with them as well. For a diabetic, I think these Walden Farms products are well worth it.

review/summary: Excellent Tea, Good Price
review/text: I started loving Oolong tea after I discovered a bottled product called 'Tejava'. That product is over a dollar for a 12 ounce bottle. I needed something less expensive so I tried this 'Prince of Peace' brand Oolong.<br /><br />After a few brewing experiments, I now love this stuff.<br /><br />What I have learned; If brewing as 'sun tea' this type of tea seems to come out very weak. If you put this tea in boiling water, it may come out bitter.<br /><br />I now heat up my water in a microwave until it is, very hot to the touch, but no way near boiling. I then put in the tea bags and let it brew for about twenty minutes (I like strong tea). I have, to my taste, duplicated the 'Tejava' brew at a fraction of the original cost.<br /><br />Enjoy<br /><br />Ken

I did some research and found 6oz glass nursettes on Enfamil's site for $60 a case.  This was my best decision. With discounts, I wound up paying $50 a case with free delivery.  Yes, they are more expensive than powder but not by much.  Besides, I feel that you can't put a price on convenience and child safety.  You can also put a nipple right on the glass nursettes as well, an added bonus.<br />If you chose to use Ready to Feed as I did, buy the 6oz nursettes.  Although the glass nursettes will make your recycling heavier, they are definitely more cost effective than the 2oz bottles.

review/text: This is a great product for traveling with newborns who need Nutramigen (go to the Enfamil website for product info and customer reviews).  But don't bother buying it here.  Buy from RiteAid online and the same product is $10 with free shipping over $25 and ships in 3-5 business days... rather than weeks here.

review/text: I love these mints.  I first had them when I was a kid and my family would visit San Francisco.  They are not in every store, so they are a little hard to find.<br /><br />As you can see from the reviews these are a love them or hate them item.<br /><br />They have a very strong smell and taste.  The taste is a kind of perfume violet taste with a little mint bite.<br /><br />Try to find them at independent grocery stores or a curiosity store so that you can try them.  Try two before you decide because the first one is just breaking you in.

Whenever I eat them I usually get comments from others as to how good or fresh my breath smells. I would highly recommend Violet Mints. Once you try them you'll know why!  :o)

review/text: I grew up eating this candy when I was a kid in the 70's, and to this day I can't get enough of them. I was so happy to find that Amazon sold them here in bulk. I would sometimes get lucky and find them at a gas station, but it was few and far between.  When I discovered amazon sold them here I went on a buying spree...YUMM...<br /><br />My wife can't stand them (says they taste like soap) but I guess its an aquired taste. The flavor is really unique and it probably catches people off guard, but once you give it a chance you will be hooked :)

review/text: I love violet flavoured products. But these were like eating Perfumed Bottle Cap candies. The Flavigny pastilles are subtler and last longer, IMHO. Actually, the case of Chowards scented my entire office, from inside a desk drawer, until people stopped to ask what perfume I was wearing! I might use the mint packets as drawer scahets until I eat them. Overall, while these are okay, I'd like a less chewable texture and slightly subtler flavour. Come to think of it, dropping one of these in a cup of white tea might be heavenly.

review/text: The previous reviewer that said you will either hate them or love them was absolutely right. I have been enjoying Violets for 50 years and am absolutely ADDICTED to them. Once I start, I can't stop until the roll is gone. But, others that I have tried to indoctrinate have called them SOAP candy because to them it tasted like perfumed soap, but nothing clears the breath better. If you like flavored mints, you will probably like these. There is a strong lavender flavor that is very refreshing and unlike anything you have ever tasted. SO HAPPY to find these online!!!

I bought it to put in coffee, in case I ran out of fresh milk or soymilk.<br /><br />I cannot tell the difference! It is enriched with vitamins and minerals, and the children's version is even better enriched with significant amounts of 19 vitamins and minerals, with a little more sugar and less fat.<br /><br />One caveat- this product is NOT fat-free, as Amazon.com states here. That would be too good to be true!<br /><br />I keep my Nido in the cupboard right next to the K-cups(coffee)and honey in my cupboard. What could be simpler?

Put jar lid on and cover the Salton.  4 hours later I have a quart of delicious thick yogurt.  Just pop that jar in the frig.  I like not having to heat milk on the stove.

review/summary: An excellent example of a global product
review/text: From 1995 to 1998 I lived and worked in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. It was here where I first encountered Nido -- actually it was a cross-cultural exchange as a result of my getting lost in the desert.<br /><br />I had been camping in the desert with a group of westerners, in an organization known as the Megamob Hash House Harriers, essentially a group of walkers, runners and overnight campers...I could say more but the Ministry of the Interior would investigate.<br /><br />I attempted to drive back home in the morning but found I was going around in circles. I didn't want to do that all day, or I'd run out of fuel and eventually water...so I approached a Bedouin encampment. It was exactly as you'd expect, a few goats wandering around, perhaps three or four camels, and a Toyota Hilux pickup truck...also a veiled Bedouin woman, and a few kid of various ages.<br /><br />I approached cautiously -- noticed that there was fairly large family -- but eventually I was able to engage in a conversation with the father, probably the grandfather, of this tribe. He carried on in Arabic while I replied in English -- one or two word phrases and lots of gesturing; eventually after five minutes eureka, I said the magic word: 'asphalt'. This seemed to register, he pointed with a stick at the ground, indicating to follow the tire tracks to the city.<br /><br />While at the Bedouin camp I enjoyed some warm Nido. It was very good. I was surprised that they drank Nido when they also had fresh steaming camel milk available.<br /><br />Luckily I made it out of the desert and I lived to tell the tale.

I can even detect when that gallon of milk has been sitting in the gas mart fridge just a little too long.<br /><br />As far as this product goes, this tastes kind of like milk.  But what it does taste like, ain't bad.  I would describe it as somewhere between whole milk and fresh buttermilk.  In a pinch it works and is very tasty as well.

So in searching for a substitute, I found Nido.  It is the equivalent of whole milk and very drinkable.  Now I mix Nido with my breakfast cereals when preparing for my trip and add water at my campsite.  As a result I have all the flavors of whole milk while on the trail just like home.  It can be hard to find but is available at Mexican supermarkets and of course here at Amazon.com.

review/text: I'm never a big fan of any kind of cold cereal. I bought this cereal only because I need some quick/easy food that's also healthy. Wow I was so surprised. This is the most tasty cereal that I have ever had! It definitely doesn't taste as boring as the usual "healthy" products and it is indeed healthy! Eating cereal is fun now. I'm so glad that I gave it a try. Will definitely buy more.

review/text: I had been purchasing this cereal for my husband because it's gluten free plus overall a healthy cereal choice. He loves it and we use so much of it that I figured I'd try to find online which lead me to Amazon. Great savings especially when you use the auto shipment. It arrived quickly, the 6-pack of boxes were all in good order with expiration dates far into the future. It turns out to aorund $3 per box when you order with auto shipment; versus $4.69 in grocery store. Great product and great value!

review/text: I really enjoy the light, crunchy texture of this cereal. It has a whole-grain flavor without being overly hearty. The fruit-sweetened quality is very nice -- an adult sweetness -- just enough.<br /><br />My only caveat -- you have to eat it quickly otherwise it becomes soggy. Good on its own without dairy/non-dairy milk as a snack.

review/text: These baking bits are excellent for adding to cookies, pies and scones! They give your baking a burst of flavor unlike anything else I've ever tried. I purchased 10 packages of raspberry and 5 packages of blueberry. I live in Alaska where fruit is extremely expensive and hard to get during the winter months. These baking bits give us a robust fruit flavor at a fraction of the cost of fresh fruit or preserves. I highly recomend this product!

review/summary: Best Steak Sauce Ever Made
review/text: Life got better when I discovered A1 steak sauce as a kid.  It made bad beef palatable.  Sadly, Mom bought half a steer once or twice a year and over-cooked it all.  Seems a well intended but misinformed home economics teacher scared her into cooking everything well beyond well.  Subsequent to that I discovered good beef and that it was silly and unnecessary to to use any kind of a sauce on a lovingly prepared steak.  Sadly life is not one long serving of a grilled medium rare porterhouse with a side of fresh horseradish. You may have your own take on this but you get it.  There are so-so burgers, average steaks at average steak houses and cheap cuts of beef purchased for big BBQ's.  That's where Ring of fire Original Steak Sauce comes in.  I smuggle this stuff into Outback when my family insists on eating there.  It's makes a burger barbeque something special.  Slathered on smoked tri-tip it's the shchizznit.<br /><br />It is only with this sauce that I can eat a burger from a fast food restaurant.  In fact, I marvel at how the #7 Angus Swiss Mushroom Burger at McDonalds tastes better than average with this steak sauce slathered all over it.  Hold the mayo and add extra mushrooms (yes, they will do that for you).  There is subtle and real chemistry at play here.  Mushrooms make beef more savory and juicy.  The heat and complex spices of Ring of Fire Steak Sauce are the salvation of this bland industrial item.  It's good on every burger but especially good when mushrooms are involved.  I'm not sure why.  In fact, I use it on Portobellos I grill and it's enough to make me think I could be a vegan for a day.<br /><br />So here's the bottom-line: this is the best steak sauce ever made.  I've had fancy, gourmet small batch sauce, sauce homemade by grilling gods and just about every other commercial steak sauce in the western world (my sauce spicy sauce collection approaches 100 bottles) and this stuff simply rules.  There's still a place for A1 in my world.  Sometimes you need a sauce with papaya. Sometimes you need something infused with chipotle.  Other times you need something fancy with you've got a special cheese or some other mystery ingredient with your beef.  But this is my go to Steak Sauce and I only wish they sold it in quart sizes.<br /><br />The folks at Ring of Fire also have the best habanero hot sauce ([...] in the entire world so it's no surprise they'd figure out steak sauce so well.  I haven't researched this but everything they sell has some crazy flavors that work and work well.  Hats off to them.

review/summary: Not Bad, Yummy, But Hard & Dry
review/text: While the wasabi flavor of these peas was strong, and they were hot and sweet both at the same time, the peas were super hard, many were so dry they just disintegrated when they were bitten into. Also, the majority of the peas were not whole--they were broken pieces, half of a pea, chunks of dried peas, but not whole, round, pretty peas. I realize wasabi peas are dried--I love wasabi peas and I eat them all the time--but these were super hard and super dry, like dusty inside when bitten into.<br /><br />Also, no nutritional label or ingredients information was provided with the peas... and the packaging was ordinary, normal plastic bags, with no information, labels, printing, anything on them to say what they were. I would imagine the bags are filled from larger bulk bags, but some sort of ingredients or nutritional labeling should have come with the product.<br /><br />So while the flavor was good, the texture and the size and the consistency of the product was poor. They were okay, and I did eat them, but I honestly probably wouldn't order them again from this seller. I've ordered others from Amazon.com sellers that were much better, and I would likely go back to them before ordering from here again.

review/summary: Great cereal, but it has its flaws
review/text: this is a very delicious cereal. it was all the things they said it was, the two issues about it for me is that calorie/fat content. 260 cal./10 grams of fat per serving seems a bit high, even for a granola based cereal. and the next problem is the flaxseed, they didn't grind them. like many of you know, when you don't grind flaxseed, it will pass strait through your digestive system. now at first i thought, "well im eating the cereal, a good chewing should do the job just fine", but thats not the case. not to be gross, but i saw  flaxseed in my stool, the seeds in whole. you probably only effectively breaking down about 2/5 of the seeds. so you're obviously not getting nearly as much nutritional value from it compared to if they would just pre-grind it.<br /><br />but other than that its a great cereal, the taste is an unmistakable 10, nice fiber content and organic. i will still buy in the future, just not as often as i would've liked though

review/summary: It makes me dance
review/text: I got my first box of this cereal at Target. it was on sale, 3 dollars and 4 cents. I'm kind of a health food freak, I saw "flax plus" and the USDA organic symbol and tossed it in the cart along with my recycled toilet paper and organic zBars.<br />Did I know I was carrying around a slice of heaven? Had I known, I would have bought all the boxes in my local Target. But I didn't find this out until the next morning.<br /><br />Every morning I slid out of bed at 6 am and go get my breakfast. Warm oatmeal with bananas usually perks me up a bit, but that day I decided to try my new cereal. I added vanilla almond milk and sliced banana. I took one bite and I danced. It was so good. It is so good. I eat handfuls of it and then cry for the beauty of the moment and the taste of the cereal. it's just so good! How do they do it? It's just so good. Now in the mornings I jump out of bed and fly down the stairs so I can eat Organic Flax Plus Granola. It's just that good.<br /><br />Are you an on-the-fencer, unsure if you want to bound through the lush meadow that is this granola? Do it. You won't regret it.<br /><br />It makes me dance.

review/summary: The most awesome granola ever! EVER!
review/text: I admit it - I am a 60's flower child. I have been eating (and making my own) granola since the summer of love. While my home-made granola is superb, there are times when I just don't have the time now that I am a senior and also running my own business. After trying many, I discovered this product and fell in love - deeply in love. The flavor, the health, can only be beat by my own home made. There are a lot of granolas on the market and not all are good for you. I especially like the texture - it is lightly crunchy without destroying my dental work. The flavor is wonderful - not overly sweet. I love this particular variety blend with the pumpkin seeds and flax as both are so healthy for you on a regular basis. Enjoy!

review/summary: good source of omega-3s and tastes good too
review/text: Love this cereal! I'm taking a nutrition class and have been on the hunt for ways to get more omega-3s into my diet. (Most Americans are deficient...) This is a great solution...healthy and tastes good too! Not like other low-fat granola cereals that are chewy and tasteless. I sprinkle it on my cereal or on yogurt for breakfast or snacks...a couple tablespoonfuls on a container of light-n-fit/low-sugar yogurts goes a lot further for me than a 100-cal pack of some unfulfilling carb snack. Adding proteins to my snacks really fills me up. And what woman can't use more calcium? I highly recommend it!

review/summary: Really good, but a tad sweet
review/text: For something that is supposed to be healthy for you, this is a great tasting cereal.  The same as with most granola, it is a very dense food.  A serving size of this is going to be smaller than a serving size of a flake based cereal, so watch how much you pour into your bowl.  I'm a fairly big guy who likes a big breakfast and I find I can get about three to four servings from a box.<br /><br />The cereal has great texture, and you can really taste the flax and pumpkin seed.  These flavors are very nutty and earthy - which might not be for everyone, but if you are used to these kinds of foods, then the taste is pleasant.  The texture is mildly crunchy, but softer and a bit less dense than most traditional granola.<br /><br />My one sole complaint with this cereal is that it is a tad high on the sugar.  I feel like this was done intentionally to make the cereal sweeter and more palatable to a wider demographic.  However for those looking for low glycemic foods, it's less than ideal.  In my opinion, it could lose a little of the sweetness and be just about perfect.<br /><br />I can also pick these up at my local Kroger for $3.00-$3.30, which is less than the price here so shop around.

I was re-ordering my pack of six Natures Path when I decided to try other highly rated granolas.  I got some through Amazon and others locally.  None of them came remotely close.

The box states it is organic plus has no synthetic pesticides or herbicides, no artificial preservatives or additives. Has pumpkin and flax seeds; not a lot of them. Tastes really good. 11.5 oz. fitted into smaller box thus reducing waste stream. What's not to like?

review/summary: Love It!!
review/text: I've been eating this cereal for over a year now and it's by far my favorite.  I usually mix it with plain Greek yogurt and wild blueberries but sometimes I'll eat it with soy milk.  I even have a bag in my office desk drawer for snacking.  BUY IT.

review/summary: Recommended by my acupuncturist!
review/text: I picked this cereal up at Costco after my acupuncturist recommended it (she has me on a very strict diet).  The taste is great and one serving (3/4 cup) is very filling and satisfying.  I basically can't have any sweets, so this cereal, with almond milk, satisfies sweet cravings when they pop up.  Love it!  It's very much like a loose granola, so it'd be good without milk as well.
