review/summary: Delicious flavored coffee
review/text: This is one of our favorite flavored coffees. The caramel flavor is nice and smooth, and not syrupy tasting like when the coffee shop just adds a syrup to regular coffee to give it a certain flavor. Coffee drinkers have very individual tastes, but for me and my wife this coffee is delicious.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: Carefully check the price before you order this coffee from any seller. A box of 24 cups should cost less than fourteen dollars exclusive of shipping, and further discounts are available if you order multiple boxes, including free shipping.

review/text: When I got my Keurig, I went NUTS on the K Cups...I have tried at least 25 different varieties and this has been the best. I make the largest cup each time, which unfortunately means a more diluted coffee. Not with GM's Caramel Vanilla. It holds the flavor and I highly recommend.

review/text: I am not what I would consider to be a "coffee lover". By time I finish with prepping a cup of black 'joe' it is usually some sort of sugary milky drink. This is why I like this coffee so much! Not too intense and tasty enough that a splash of milk and one or two sugars and I'm set! No need for some kind of flavor shot or flavored creamer! Gotta love the price here on Amazon as well! It's technically $2 cheaper as a member on the Keurig site, but they charge almost $7 for shipping!

review/summary: Our favorite of all time, but much too expensive here. Look elsewhere for better prices
review/text: Two years of trying just about every coffee offered in k-cups, and this flavor is, by far, our favorite. We keep it stocked in the pantry at all times. Our second favorite is a seasonal flavor, Island Coconut, and we look forward to that being available usually in the Spring.<br /><br />K-cup prices vary, not only from different sellers, but at different times. However, it seems that Amazon's prices are always sky high compared to other places. Prime membership or not, the prices here aren't doing you any favors. If you like this coffee, hunt around. I get free shipping, next day delivery, and pay $12.50/box of 24 or less no matter what brand or flavor I'm ordering. Sorry, Amazon, while I do most of my shopping with you in all categories, this isn't one of them even though I keep checking back and hoping your prices on k-cups become more competitive.

review/summary: Coffee pretty good but VERY expensive; won't order again.
review/text: Well, it's my fault. I am so used to K-cups (from Amazon) coming in 2 24 cup orders, I assumed that the Green Mountain was the same. NOT! That makes this about twice the cost of every other brand. The coffee tastes pretty good, not great. There are too many other options like Van Houtte Spicy Mayan Chocolate or Cr&egrave;me Caramel, and when you subscribe they are less that 50 cents a cup. Anyway, I learned to be more careful. Buying this once was worth the lesson, but not the coffee. Just my two cents, of which I have fewer now :)

review/summary: On the light side
review/text: The caramel vanilla cream flavoring of K-cup by Green Mountain is a tasty option of the LIGHT roast category.  It's suitable for my tastes because I don't put but a dash of milk in my coffee.  If you drink with sugar and cream I suspect the flavor will be lost.  Smells great while brewing but then again they pretty much all do!  Green mountain is one of my favorite brands and this flavor is good but not great.  I might order it again.

review/text: If you're considering this coffay, you're probably a fan of the flavoured, sweeter smelling stuff to begin with. The kind who likes a caramel latte type afternoon fix once in a while?<br /><br />Well, when you stick this pod in your Keurig and hit the button, you will be rewarded with exactly what the product title claims. Notes of caramel, vanilla, and cream burst forth from the machine and make for a delicious drink.<br /><br />But I realized quickly that I probably couldn't drink this every single day. I like the sweet stuff, but beyond a point, all that goodness can be a little cloying. I recommend getting this, but you'll probably also want straight up regular coffee pods to mix it up.

review/text: I was skeptical when I read the other reviews saying that this Green Mountain Caramel Vanilla Cream coffee tasted like a Starbucks Caramel Macchiato but I was very pleasantly surprised! I tried it with just milk, milk & vanilla creamer, and just vanilla creamer.<br />The milk & creamer (big splashes of each) yielded the best faux caramel macchiato flavor. Obviously it's more of a cafe au lait than a latte, but for under $1, I am very satisfied with this cuppa joe.<br />I prefer this flavor over the green mountain Hazelnut flavored coffee.<br /><br />I tried 4 and 10 ounce sizes and was pleased with the strength and flavor of both sizes, with the smaller size being a bit darker.<br /><br />If you like flavored coffees, this is a definite YES.

review/summary: A little overbearing
review/text: The flavoring is pretty strong, which is fine, except that I think it overwhelms the coffee a bit.  I like caramel, and I like vanilla, but one or the other (or maybe both) are a little too much in this product.

review/summary: My favorite K-cup coffee
review/text: Let me start off that before I bought my husband a Keurig for Christmas, I only drank a coffee drink once in a blue moon...when I stopped by a Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts and it was normally a latte, etc. But I decided to try out some of the flavored coffee, and after adding some sugar and milk, I now drink at least a couple of cups a day. The Caramel Vanilla Cream is my favorite thus far. Make no mistake, this is a sweeter coffee and a light roast. It's perfect for a gal like me that prefers a hint of the coffee flavor. The caramel and vanilla flavors stand out, much more than some of the other coffees I've tried.

review/summary: Affordable substitute for this caramel macchiato lover
review/text: I love myself a sweet caramel macchiato from Starbuck's, but they're overpriced and high in calories/sugar.  While I still enjoy one as an occassional treat, these taste wonderful for a morning cup of coffee.  I still have to have sweetener, so I also add some flavored creamer in mine.  I've tried a lot of different flavored k-cups and these are my favorite.  Just wish Green Mountain made them in decaf.  I live in Colorado, so sometimes a hot cup of coffee would be nice at night, but I wouldn't be able to handle caffeine.

review/summary: Good, but not what I expected
review/text: The flavor itself is good, I like this coffee and will enjoy it. Nothing more convenient for a college student than the keurig, although its somewhat more costly... I am willing to pay the costs and find them acceptable. Others may not, but keurig is a matter of opinion I suppose. The coffee is well brewed by my mr. Coffee keurig, but the flavor isn't what I expected. Bare cup, taste only vanilla, which I found a bit dissapointing because I love caramel; the caramel flavor only comes out when I add sugar (three packets of sugar in the raw, in my experience). Sugar added it tastes great, but the caramel is minute as compared to the vanilla...<br /><br />All in all it's good. I will try Gloria jeans butter toffee next, and choose a favorite after that (big into sugary flavored coffee). Otherwise, get this if just to try it. You won't regret it.

The coffee is stronger, not just colored water and I like the caramel vanilla flavor.  I will order this coffee again.  I made a mistake and did not order enough from Amazon, over 50$ so the shipping was a little expensive, so just be sure to get the order up to 50.

review/summary: Unimpressed
review/text: We originally purchased this blend because my wife was a big fan of the Green Mountain French Vanilla blend, mixed with a caramel creamer.  We had hoped that this blend would have a similar flavor, but it didn't.<br /><br />We've tried numerous Green Mountain blends.  This one was definitely the least impressive of the bunch (so far).  The flavor isn't bad by any means -- it's certainly drinkable -- but it feels like it's missing something, especially when compared against other K-cups in the same price range.<br /><br />For comparison's sake: Our K-cup blends so far are the GMC Breakfast Blend, the French Vanilla blend, and Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee blend.  If you're looking for something a little darker, Emeril's Big Easy Bold blend is also very nice.

review/text: Like others have said the price on here is high, and I bought it for a lot less at Kohls but am not going to give it a bad review over the price.  The cofee is very good.<br /><br />It does taste just like Carmel Vanilla.  It is very strong, so if you don't like your coffee super strong I would recomend brewing a larger cup if you have an adjustable cup size setting on your brewer.  If I drink it hot I brew the large travel size cup and it is the perrfect strength for me.  It is very good brewed as an ice coffee, and seeing it is a stronger brew, it is great for iced coffee.<br /><br />I like to put in sugar free Vanilla syrup isntead of splenda to sweeten it and that really enhances the flavor.  I am sure it would be great with carmel syrup as well.

review/summary: decent, but not great
review/text: When I first started to use IAMS Savory Sauce, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get a little drizzle in their kibble every once in a while, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced, and low calorie. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me that this flavor, the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a "gravy" like texture and aroma that most dogs love. Not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues, but a great free solution for picky eaters.

review/summary: Amazing Savory Sauce
review/text: IAMS Savory Sauce is a must have for dogs that don't eat dry dog food well. Our dog started to not eat her food as well until we tried the Savory Sauce. We haven't looked back since and neither has our dog. We have ordered them by the case now and only requires 5-6 drops of the sauce. The only downfall is the dog's breath right after eating is not all that pleasant. That does go away soon but is tolerabe. Just don't recommend the dog licking you right after! Great Product!

review/summary: Really good marinade for the grill!
review/text: This marinade has an especially good flavor for the grill. We used it on steak and chicken breast. Both were great! The bottle is too big for one use, however, so we stuck the leftovers in the freezer and used it up a couple weeks later. Not salty or too highly seasoned, so would probably work good on fish, also.

review/summary: So good you could drink it!
review/text: Lawry's Mesquite Lime marinade is, in my opinion, the perfect addition to anything. Pork, beef, chicken, fish, and even veggies. It is bold and savory and just the right hint of tang from the lime. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to find these days on the grocery shelves. The price offered for a six pack here on Amazon is very reasonable though - so I recommend stocking up because it is highly addictive!

review/summary: One of my favorite things :)
review/text: I have not yet met a Patak's product I did not like.  My personal favorites are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JMAVPS">Pataks Vindaloo Curry Paste 10 Oz</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JSQDVS">Pataks Mixed Pickle 10oz</a>,  If you know these products you can tell I like hot food.  This one though, the Tandoori paste, is what got my son eating Indian food, which leaves me forever indebted to Patak's as I can now cook and enjoy it at home without having to prepare a separate meal for him :)  If you are new to Indian cuisine or do not like very hot food this is a good one to try to start.  Preparation is very easy.  i usually just toss the ingredients (paste and vegetables) in a glass pan and put it in the over; fast easy prep & clean up, and good!<br />The price of Patak's [products have tripled locally so I came here hoping to subscribe, but Amazon will not ship these to Hawaii.  I am jealous of those of you who can get them!<br /><br />(I will add as an end note that if you like it hotter, spicier just add a bit more paste. It is one of the things I like about this brand and this packaging.  You can adjust the heat/ spice to suit yourself.<br />Also, before I forget ;)  marinating it overnight will also intensify the flavor and make it penetrate better.  This seems obvious/ intuitive but is not in the directions (likely to keep things as simple as possible).  It is still good even if you forget or do not have the time to marinate!

review/summary: An Awesome Drink!
review/text: Honest Ade's Orange Mango with Mangosteen is currently my favorite bottled drink. It has 100 calories per bottle and is caffeine-free. This drink combines three organic flavors from three of my favorite fruits - orange, mango, and mangosteen. The taste is just right - not too bland and not too sweet. This is what the co-founders of Honest Tea and Honest Ade, wrote on the sleeve of this bottled drink - "Patience may be a virtue, but not when you're thirsty. We got tired of waiting for a great-tasting organic citrus drink with a lot less sugar than OJ but still a full day's vitamin C. So we made one ourselves and - for an extra boost - added some mangosteen, a delicious antioxidant-rich fruit from Thailand. Our Orange Mango thirst quencher is a taste worth waiting for, but now you don't have to." What the co-founders, Seth and Barry, wrote perfectly captures why this bottled drink is great. There are not that many bottled drinks with mangosteen in it, so that's why I love this drink. This drink is USDA organic, and I love how they have quotes from famous people printed behind the sleeves of their plastic bottled drinks. For example, the two bottled Honest Ades I drank today, have these following quotes: "I would rather regret the things I have done than the things I have not." - Lucille Ball; "He who plants a tree plants hope." - Lucy Larcom. (Yeah, it's ironic how the two bottles of Honest Ade I drank today had quotes from women starting with the first three letters, "Luc".) Anyways, I highly recommend this drink. I also highly recommend Whole Foods Market's 365 Everyday Value - Orange and Mangosteen + B Vitamins Nutrient Enhanced Water. I bought the 365 Orange and Mangosteen bottled drink when my sister and I stopped at Greenlife Grocery in Chattanooga, Tennessee (we always go to Greenlife Grocery when we stop in Chattanooga, TN). This drink has 540 mg of mangosteen extract per bottle and has no gluten ingredients and is a vegan product. Since I'm a big mangosteen fan, I was so excited to stumble upon this drink at Greenlife Grocery. When I went to the checkout line, the Greenlife checkout cashier, stared at the drink, and instantly commented that this drink looked awesome, and that she was going to try it. I was very surprised that some of the Greenlife employees didn't try this drink yet. Anyways, the 365 Orange and Mangosteen bottled drink has 130 calories per bottle, and has 130% Vitamin C - 30 percent more Vitamin C than the 100% listed on Honest Ade's Orange Mango drink. Honest Ade also has 5% Vitamin A while 365 bottled drink from Whole Foods has 25% Vitamin A - 20 percent more than Honest Ade. According to the 365 Orange and Mangosteen bottled drink from Whole Foods Market/Greenlife stores - they basically have more vitamin content than Honest Ade - Vitamins A, C, E, B6, B12, B5, Niacin, and Folic Acid. So, Honest Ade has less calories, and 365 has more vitamin content. So, you can weigh your options. But both bottled drinks are great, and offer more healthier and delightful-tasting drinking options. I give both of these bottled drink brands a big thumbs up. Like I said, mangosteen is a great fruit and is good for you, and if you can find any bottled drink that has some mangosteen in it, I strongly recommend buying that drink.

review/text: This is probably my favorite Honest Tea plastic bottled drink (although honey green tea is awesome too). It's like orange juice with mango, but without all the acidity and with just the right amount of sugar.<br /><br />However, don't buy at these prices. At my supermarket, these are about $1 each, sometimes a little more. $2 or $3 (including shipping) is ridiculous.

review/summary: Honest Ade Orange Mango
review/text: I think this has been my favorite from the Honest brand lineup.  It was definitely better than the Lemonade and the Pomegranate Blue I tried from them anyway. And its a good flavor, even if a bit weak.<br /><br />Orange Mango actually tasted like it was supposed to.  The citrus came through and the mango sweetened it up, and to me at least, I could taste both fruits in there just the same flavor as they are when you eat a real mango or orange.  The bottle advertises once again that its "just a tad sweet" but I actually found this one to be very sweet.  Not over-poweringly sweet, but more than a tad.  Overall, it tasted pretty nice.<br /><br />The ingredients are stellar.  Most of them are organic and its sweetened with real sugar, not some fake sugar substitute.  There's even fruit puree in it.  It's only a 100 calories per bottle, which is 16.9 oz.  And there's vitamin C and A in it to make you feel even healthier.  Its probably a good drink to have in winter because of the vitamin C.  At the very least, you can feel good about having this as a water replacement.<br /><br />I would definitely buy this drink again.  Its tasty, has good ingredients, and I can make it last all morning if I'm not greedy.  A good buy!<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/summary: Relaxing Alternative To Tea
review/text: I first enjoyed Honest Ade at a Bed and Breakfast in Seattle.  I have been unable to find it in any stores in my area, so I ordered it from Amazon.  I usually drink a half gallon of tea a day and this is a nice caffeine free alternative with wonderful taste.  Today I planned on sharing  a bottle with my grandson, but after one gulp  he  co-opted and drank the whole thing.  On returning home I ordered another case.  This also tastes great if you mix it with white tea.

review/text: NOT SO HONEST!!  This drink tasted great until I read the ingredients.  I purchased this in a local restaurant and realized after how terrible it is.  The ingredients are water, then sugar cane, and then GRAPE and LEMON juice.  This is not at all what is on the label.  I was very dissatisfied with my purchase once I realized it's not really juice, let alone the type of juice it says on the label.  It tastes ok and it's great that it's organic and low calories, but mix your own sugar water, it's way cheaper.  And what is "organic orange flavor"?  Why not use orange juice?  Ew, just ew.
