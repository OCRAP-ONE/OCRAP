review/summary: Very good but expensive
review/text: The main reason I tried the Petite Cuisine cat food is that it does not have by-products.  This food actually smells like good food; there are no bad odors (this is stated on the label blurb but I didn't actually believe it) and my cat loves it.<br /><br />The only criticism I have is the price.  Almost $1 per can for the small 3oz size is pretty steep.  There are other choices out there in canned cat food without by-products for much less.  And choosing the larger 5.5 oz cans in any brand, while not as convenient, will save a lot of money.

review/summary: Cats seem to enjoy it.
review/text: It's tough to review cat food, other than to say the cats will eat it. The ingredients seem to be quality, although the cans seem to contain more watery gravy than food. It's not as nasty as most canned cat food though. The cats seem to enjoy it, so I'll give it 4 stars for being "good".

review/summary: Good nutrition, cat likes it
review/text: I tried to change my review to 4 stars, but I don't seem able to do that.  These are 3 oz cans of 4 different flavors of fish based catfood.  Chicken and rabbit are often more recommended for cats.  The first ingredient is fish broth, making it somewhat high in moisture.  I've heard that cats often need more water than they drink, so I'd assume its a good thing to get more moisture down them, but this is an expensive way to do it (you could just add a little water to their food).  The good news is that there appears to be no grains in the ingredient list, looks like almost all meat based (except for the usual additives).  The grains in most catfoods are thought to not be good for the cats.  This catfood is not cheap, but it appears to be a better than usual cat food.

review/summary: Looks and smells like human food
review/text: What can you say about cat food?  Actually this looks and smells good enough to eat (but I'm not going to try it myself).  So I gave it to all four of our cats when they were not particularly hungry (not at a normal meal time) and they all seemed to enjoy it (even the one that often completely refuses to eat anything but "crunchies").<br /><br />Reviewing the label it sounds healthy.  The high taurine content is definitely very healthy for cats.  The only "fault" I could imagine is the relatively high price (tiny cans and the fact that it has a high moisture content - the moisture is healthy, but you're paying for water).<br /><br />If you can afford to spoil your cats, give this food a try (be careful your kids don't try to eat it by accident {laugh}).

review/summary: My Cat Has Enjoyed Petite Cuisine
review/text: Naturally this review is based upon my cat's intake of Petite Cuisine. She's not a particular picky eater, so I can't say much about that. However, she looks to really enjoy this brand of cat food. I have tried some brands of wet food in the past that have made her sick (I know cats seem to have digestive systems that are prone to upsetting!) Petite Cuisine did not have any effect there, and she really enjoyed all the flavors. I don't feed her wet food often, usually just some tuna fish now and then. So, although this food is expensive if you used it at every meal, it is priced about the same as tuna, so it fits my needs perfectly. I'm sure my cat will enjoy the rest of this case, and I can keep the canned tuna to myself for now :-)

review/text: I'm not too sure why they named this chicken based cat food with names like "Chinese Chicken", but my 2 cats seem to know.  Both of them eat this stuff up like it's the last supper.<br /><br />Based upon the ingredients, I feel like I'm feeding them something far more nutritious than Fancy Feast (which they love, except for the salmon, which makes them puke).

review/summary: Cat Tested, Owner Approved
review/text: We have made friends recently with an abandoned tabby cat we call Mr. Whiskers. I am sure he would be grateful for most anything on a plate at this stage, still he appears to be a gentleman of discernment. And at first whiff of Petite Cuisine, he settled down to some serious feeding and joyously licked his whiskers afterwards.<br /><br />This is an obviously high end cat food and looks and smells good enough for humans. (Let us hope in this economy it does not come to that.) As long as I can afford it I will continue feeding him this brand. I have seen pets fed cheap food develop terrible tumors on their poor little bodies, so I am committed to serving him the best I can find / afford.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you care about your pet and can afford it I highly reccommend this brand. I was quite impressed by the quality.

review/summary: A NEW BRAND FOR ME
review/text: I admit it, I had never heard of this brand of cat food before trying this. I was dubious to the hilt for I have a 16 year old cat that puts a new meaning to the term finicky feline!! I cannot tell you how many times I have put food in front of her only to have her walk away. She wants what she wants!! So trying this product I went in with a wary attitude. Alas, she went right for it! So far I have tried three of the flavors and she has liked each one. Being so old I have had trouble finding brands that worked well with her digestive system. I have had no problems with Petite Cuisine so far. Looks like this is a winner in my house. If you have a fussy eater try this one out. You may be pleasantly surprised!

review/summary: Very healthy cat food. Much better than almost any other
review/text: This is some of the healthiest cat food on the market. It is all natural and doesn't contain food byproducts. What comes out of the can looks like real food (just below human quality) not a mash-up of mysterious goop. The fish in these cans has texture, and smells better than other cat food.<br /><br />My two cats absolutely love it.<br /><br />If you want a healthy cat food that is natural and not made in China, give these a try. I can't guarantee your cat(s) will love it as much as mine, but if they don't like it, they need to grow taste buds!

review/summary: Our kitties LOVE this food!!!!
review/text: I wasn't sure how my cats would like Petite Cuisine, because they are Friskies cats.  Man, do they love their friskies: seafood, chicken, or maybe a little turkey (but they don't like beef)...as long as the friskies aren't in that big glop they call "classic pate."<br /><br />No 9Lives, no science diet, no canned tuna, no non-friskies brands, thank you very much!  They're cats.  They're picky about what they eat!<br /><br />So I tried this Petite Cuisine, assuming that - just like everything else - they would reject it.  BOY was I wrong!!!!  They literally lapped up the entire plate of the stuff within the first hour after I first put it out.  And it seems to be easy on their digestive system: they don't seem to be barfing it up like they sometimes do when new food comes into the picture.<br /><br />Since it looks like real fish that you or I would eat from a can, I am worried that - just like canned tuna - it's going to cause horribly smelly you-know-whats.<br /><br />I want to check with my vet to see if he thinks it's healthy.  But from the taste point of view, my cats have rated this five meows!

review/summary: the kitties say "more, please!"
review/text: We have six cats ranging in age from a year old to seventeen years old (with diabetes and hyperthyroid). The eldest guy gets mostly canned food (Wellness and Eagle Pack, plus prescription food mixed in) because he's missing teeth and tends to be a picky eater. Everyone loves this food.<br /><br />I love it too because it looks like real food and smells like real food. The fish isn't stinky at all (I got some wellness shrimp & sardine that about ran me out of the house once, LOL!). There's plenty of liquid to help the old guy eat it, and even my mom's cat who is finicky loves it too.<br /><br />I like the fact that I'm feeding high quality, human grade food to my cats. This is good stuff, and I'm going to look for it locally. Thanks!

review/summary: The kitty committee has reached a decision.
review/text: My three cats, two females and a male (well, they used to be anyway), all have extremely different personalities and tastes in cat food. I tried an experiment to see which of the flavors of Petite Cuisine would appeal to tough-guy, and which ms. whiner would like best, and whether or not clingy-dependent had a preference. I think I can state for the scientific record that the appeal of all four flavors of Petite Cuisine transcends even personality-based inclination.<br /><br />The cans may be small, but once you pop the top and tip one into your cat's bowl, you see how much was packed in there. The pieces of fish are large and fresh looking (although I was not tempted to go for the bread and mayo, they smelled good, too). My cats ate every morsel of the food, instead of sucking up the gravy and leaving half the solid to petrify onto the sides of their bowl as they do with other sliced cat foods in sauce.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine is pricey, but I think I might keep a carton on hand for occasional special treats. I wouldn't be able to afford it all the time, despite the fact that it's actually worth the price.

review/summary: Even for a picky cat
review/text: I tried these out with my cat in the hopes of finding something she would like!  She tends to not like canned food very much.  I was truly surprised when she showed immediate interest in the snapper variety and then actually ate the whole can.  She was not very fond of the yellowfin--she nibbled a bit and then wanted dry food.  I am thrilled to finally have found something she likes.  She will eat thr tuna, but not with the enthusiasm she has for the snapper. I also like the smaller portion size--no more covering cans and keeping them in the fridge--only to have to warm them up for the next meal.  Definitely try these out.

review/text: I have three cats that are picky eaters.  They like a very small number of cat foods, but this is one type they do enjoy.

review/text: My cat, an 11 year old tabby who is not at all finicky, nonetheless went a bit wild when I opened up one of the cans of this "people food for cats" entree. It also contains flavors I have never seen on offer before, such as Yellowfin and Snapper. I am always a bit hesitant, after last years awful pet food poisonings, in trying something new, but all seems well. One thing - open the cans with care. They are packed full and can be quite messy if not opened over a sink or trash can.

But they're cats with no gourmet values. And picky me can't detect an unpleasant odor.  The nutritional values seem comparable to the Wholesome Goodness I've been picking up at WalMart.  Is gluten free an issue for cats?  As far as safety of ingredients, additives, and processing, who knows?  And unless one can be assured of safety, why pay so much more?

review/summary: Kitties declare it a winner!
review/text: The kitties seemed to know the package from Amazon was for them and meowed loudly while I opened it up. Petite Cuisine Variety pack was here!<br /><br />This product comes in a 3 oz can which is just the right size to split between the two cats. (Of course, my food obsessed male cat could have eaten the whole can himself and then some). Upon opening the can, the food itself looked better than even "people tuna" with nice large chunks. The kitties' heads did not move from their bowls until every last morsel was gone. Nigel (foodie cat) kept looking around for more, checking out the kitchen, the table...<br /><br />The kitties certainly enjoyed it, but as their caretaker I also appreciated the ingredients. Fish and fish broth, and NO gluten or by products. Exactly what I am looking for.<br /><br />Unfortunately, because of the price, I would probably consider this more as a treat or a meal supplement than a primary food. The serving suggestion is one can for each 2 1/2 pounds of body weight per day. Let's just say that for my two kitties, and Nigel Cat in particular, this would add up to a LOT of cans of food.<br /><br />However...I definitely plan to keep treating them!

review/summary: Please check the controversial ingredients and decide for yourself
review/text: While several reviewers have alluded to the healthfulness of this product, I think that we owe it to our beloved pets to pay closer attention and educate ourselves about the actual ingredients.<br /><br />The overall appearance gives an allure of wholesomeness to this product, but an item listed in the ingredients is actually controversial with regards to our pets' health. (And if you're considering this food good enough for your own consumption, please note that the ingredient is also potentially toxic to human organs).<br /><br />Here's the list of ingredients, from the manufacturer's website:<br /><br />Fish broth<br />Tuna fillets<br />Yellow fin whole loin tuna/red snapper/shrimp/sole<br />Soy bean oil<br />Trialcium phosphate<br />Guar gum<br />Calcium sulfate<br />Carrageenan<br />Vitamins and Minerals<br />Vitamin E supplement<br />Vitamin A supplement<br />Vitamin D3 supplement<br />Zinc Sulfate<br />Thiamine Mononitrate<br />Manganese sulfate<br />Menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of vitamin K activity)<br />Riboflavin supplement<br />Folic acid<br />Pyridoxine hydrochloride<br />Copper amino acid complex<br />Iron amino acid complex<br /><br />First of all, it's great that the manufacturer has whole seafood as the major ingredients (as opposed to the by-products, meal, grains, etc). But there is one item which I would not have expected to find in something of this quality: Menadione sodium bisuifite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for the K vitamins and has been reported, at high doses, to have toxic effects. Moreover, I had actually never seen menadione listed as an ingredient in other cat foods (though there seem to be others out there).<br /><br />A little bit of Internet sleuthing yielded some disturbing information, which I feel obliged to list here.<br /><br />*Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />*There are safer alternatives to menadione for proper K vitamin-related functions (e.g. blood clotting). The use of menadione over the alternatives (leafy greens, kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food.<br /><br />*A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione "produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung." Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />*Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />There seems to be a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of menadione in pet food: [...]<br /><br />Does this information mean that this food is bad for our cats, when normal doses are given? I don't know for sure, but I wish that I'd been more aware about this ingredient before feeding it to my cats. Admittedly, more research needs to be done regarding this subject. In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I'm erring on the side of caution on this one.

review/summary: Looks like a winner
review/text: I'm a serious label-reader, even more so for my cat than for myself, so before I ordered Petite Cuisine, I went to their website to see what they had to say for themselves.  I was pleased to read that they use no wheat gluten in their food, nor meat by-products; neither belongs in pet food.  They also make a point of saying that they use no products from China.  It's a reassurance I appreciate in the light of the recent spate of pet deaths linked to product coming out of China.<br /><br />What they do use was also reassuring.  White meat chicken, veggies, olive or soybean oils, vitamins and minerals.  The sesame chicken does contain rice which isn't something that should necessarily  be fed often, but it's a minor consideration.  While it's never said that the ingredients are "human grade" they are listed as safe for humans to eat.  I don't know about anyone else but I wouldn't want to feed my pets anything that wasn't safe for me to eat.<br /><br />The carton arrived and was marked as "Product of Thailand" which was a bit of a surprise since no mention of Thailand appears on their site.  They are, however, quick to point out that no child labor is used in production of any of the food.  (It's also listed as "dolphin safe."  This is a pretty politically correct company.)<br /><br />Of course the proof of the pudding, or in this case, the cat food, is the eating.  My response as I opened the cans was the the sesame chicken looked and smelled very tempting.  The chicken pot pie, not so much.  It smells wonderful, but is very watery.  Again, this is a minor consideration.  If my cat likes it, that's the important thing.  He's a picky boy, in part because he can't eat beef or lamb, so he's limited to poultry and certain types of fish.  He doesn't tend to like the souped-up, holistic foods that add things like rosemary and acai and all those things which humans so cheerfully add to their own foods.  But this stuff is pretty basic, and, well let's just say, he doesn't hate it.  I can probably add it to the rotation without causing much consternation, and know that he's getting a quality meal.<br /><br />Your mileage -- or your cat's -- may vary, of course.  Cats are perverse little beasts, and you just never know what they're going to take violent dislike to.  I can't tell you if your cat will like this food or not, but I can tell you that it looks like quality product made by people who have high standards.  Yes, it's pricey, but if you feel, as I do, that your cat deserves the consideration you'd give to any member of the family, you probably won't balk at the cost.<br /><br />The rest is up to your cat.

review/summary: a review from Trixie the Wondercat as told to her person....
review/text: I had been told that finally the day would come when my own package from amazon would come and today it finally came. What was in the box was basically the winnings from some cat lottery.  A case of seafood dinners-Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, & Tuna & Shrimp.  I was sleeping when my person stood with my treat dish poised above my nose.  "Don't bug me" I thought as I sleepily eyed what she had in hand....A TREAT!<br /><br />I quickly followed into the kitchen to partake of a delicious entree of Red Snapper.  This totally looks like peoplefood!  I scarfed down a half a can immediately and if there was a pattern at the bottom of my bowl I would have licked that off as well.  That was one clean dish.  I've been told that tomorrow we'll try maybe Yellowfin, which sounds equally good.<br /><br />Likes:  looks like peoplefood, smells good, not overly fishy, and they add vitamins and no wheat gluten....hm, not sure about that one, but apparently wheat gluten isn't good.  Anyway....it is delicious and it is much like my other favorite, "Sheba".<br />Dislikes: My people wouldn't just leave me the whole can because they don't think I'll stop eating, but that's really more of a personal issue.<br /><br />Four paws up on this one!

review/summary: Caution - may cause kitty stampede
review/text: I called upon a panel of two expert feline food testers assist me with this review.  The first, Apollo, is quite enthusiastic about food related assignments and is usually most concerned about quantity.  The second, LJ, is more discerning about food, occasionally refusing to participate.<br /><br />When I opened the first selection, Chicken Pot Pie I noticed a quantity of liquid around the solid portion of the meal and was concerned that it was perhaps spoiled.  I detected no bad odor so I offered it to my panel, who were incidentally becoming quite impatient.  Apollo immediately began to consume his portion, pausing only when the dish was empty.  LJ took her usual cautious sniff of the food and then began to eagerly lap up the liquid, pausing to take a bite of the solids from time to time.  She too did not stop eating until the entire portion was consumed.<br /><br />At the next testing session I offered the Chinese Chicken selection.  This one looked much more like other canned cat food but had a more pronounced odor.  Both testers arrived at their stations without being summoned.  Again both testers were enthusiastic about their assignments and did not stop until the entire portion was consumed.  In fact when the testers were disturbed by two members of the canine food testing team they expressed great displeasure.<br /><br />As I was preparing the food samples a member of the human food testing panel remarked that the feline samples, particularly the Chinese Chicken, looked better than much of the food she had been eating at college.<br /><br />Obviously the feline panel was quite taken with the product.  Our chief accountant had some issues with it however since this product costs about four times as much per ounce as our usual offering. (Note:  usual offering has kept six cats quite healthy for more than thirty years).  With this price factor in mind I divided each single serving (3 oz) can between the two testers and supplemented with dry food.<br /><br />Due to the enthusiastic endorsements by the feline food testers and based on my prior experience with aging felines' diminished appetites, I will purchase this product in the future as a supplement to the usual feline menu offerings, much as the human menu is supplemented by holiday meals or upscale restaurant outings.

review/summary: Crab meat layer thin as veneer
review/text: The crab meat layer on top is about a 1/4" (I'm being generous in my measurement)w/ the rest being tuna and a substantial share of broth. Of course my cats loved it and each devoured a whole can. I felt it was quite overpriced for tuna and will not purchase again. I think it's much more cost-effective to buy a can of Phillip's crab meat from the grocery store so my cats and I can both enjoy it.

review/summary: The cat seems pleased.
review/text: The cat went right for this food, no hesitation.  I rate 4 out of 5 stars because the canned food is too low in protein and fats to use the main pet diet.  I recommend this product with the caveat that you supplement it with additional protein and fats (a dry food would be good).

review/summary: Quality ingredients; unfortunately, not a hit with my cat
review/text: The first test for a new canned cat food is the ingredient list.  The ingredients in Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (chicken flavors) passed this test with flying colors: Chicken, Chicken Broth, Carrots are listed first and there is no wheat gluten. Unfortntately, the 2nd test is whether my cat will eat the food and this ended up with a big thumbs down. Not sure if it was the significant amount of broth in a serving or the fact that it is chicken (he usually has fish-based canned food), but after a 1st bite, he just walked away.<br /><br />If a cat is accustomed to eating chicken canned food, I would still recommend giving this a try because of the quality ingredients.

review/summary: My cats love this stuff!
review/text: I wasn't quite sure my cats would eat this because I've never fed them anything other than dry kibble.  I needn't have worried; my cats love it!<br /><br />I like that it has human grade ingredients (no bad odors here) and that it contains absolutely no gluten (the ingredient that caused a massive pet food recall a few years back).  Something I didn't know before ordering Petite Cuisine is that it comes in recyclable aluminum cans, which means it won't contribute to the overflowing landfill problem.<br /><br />All in all, my only complaint is the cost, but I will probably buy more for my cats as a special treat.  They will love me for it.

review/summary: MMMEEEEEEOOOOWWWW!!
review/text: Let me start here by admitting that we have 5 cats that live with us now (I know, don't even ask it's a loooong story).  I've always been a big fan of the Fancy Feast and recently the fishier varieties of the Aristocats soft foods.  On occasion I will purchase Friskies but honestly I just can't stand the smell of the latter, even if the kitties just love it.<br /><br />Just for a fun little test I decided to put three cans out, to see which was favored by my cats (Fancy Feast, Aristocats and this Petite Cuisine).  Well, long story short, they gobbled this brand up, quick as quick before moving on to their usual favorites.<br /><br />This brand looks and for the most part smells similar to canned tuna, one of them even has tiny whole shrimp. Bonus!! They eat it all up, so no kitty food sitting in the bowl when they are done. It is made from quality ingredients, not full of ash (like some), has added vitamins and the texture & smell that the cats really enjoy.  I admit that quality cat food has gotten a bit on the expensive side but, this isn't bad at all considering the prices of the other comparable brands.  All in all my kitties really enjoyed this food & I will certainly be back for more.

review/summary: This is not Fancy Feast
review/text: Petite Cuisine is a proposed competitor to Fancy Feast.  Insofar as taste, well, my cat, Matt, will eat anything, and this is no exception.  He plowed right through all four flavors:  red snapper, tuna and sole, tuna and shrimp and yellow fin tuna.  Matt is a food addict, and I have to control his intake, giving him four measured meals a day.  Only one of those meals per day is a half of a 3 ounce can of Fancy Feast or a worthwhile substitute.  The caloric intake is such that giving him any more than that would double his already 17 pound size.<br /><br />In any case, I compared the Guarantee Analysis of Fancy Feast to Petite Cuisine, and here are the numbers:<br /><br />1.  Crude protein:  Fancy Feast...minimum 14.0%; Petite Cuisine...13%.<br />2.  Crude fat:  Fancy Feast...minimum 3.0%; Petite Cuisine...1.5%.<br />3.  Crude fiber:  Fancy Feast...maximum 1.5%; Petite Cuisine...1%.<br />4.  Moisture:  Fancy Feast...maximum 78.0%; Petite Cuisine...85%.<br />5.  Ash:  Fancy Feast...maximum 3.5%; Petite Cuisine...3%.<br />6.  Taurine:  Fancy Feast...minimum 0.05%; Petite Cuisine...0.1%.<br /><br />In particular, I noticed that Petite Cuisine is much runnier than Fancy Feast, which has a fairly thick consistency in ground varieties and much thicker gravy in those versions as well.  All together and based upon the comparison of content, I would prefer to purchase Fancy Feast; however, another factor you should consider is overall cost, especially if you are feeding more than one cat.

review/summary: #1 Ingredient is Mostly Water
review/text: I received two cases of Petite Cusine from Amazon.com earlier this week. I figured that this would be an easy product to review. After all, what could possibly go wrong with cat food? I have a cat. He eats food. Seems simple enough.<br /><br />Well, here's the problem... My cat, who is well-known for eating just about anything, refuses to touch this stuff. From the rest of the reviews here, you would think that this was some sort of feline version of steak and lobster. My cat refuses to play along though.<br /><br />I guess that I can understand why my cat keeps staring at me with this puzzled look on his face. This is not ordinary cat food. At least not the batch I received. Even before I opened the can, I was struck by the fact that there seemed to be more liquid inside than solid. Sure enough, upon opening the can I found the contents to consist of a LOT, and I mean a LOT, of water. It has more of the consistency of soup than of ordinary cat food. If it were human food, you wouldn't be able to eat it with a fork. You would need a spoon, or maybe even a straw. This seemed to be the case with all of the varieties that I tested on my cat.<br /><br />My cat refuses to eat any of the many flavors of this food I have put in front of him. No, he's not sick, and he seems to have a quite healthy appetite for his regular dry food. I wish that I could come up with even a single positive thing to say about Petite Cusine. Nice looking box? That's about it.<br /><br />UPDATE: Just to make sure that I was giving Petite Cusine a "fair shake", and to make sure that I didn't just wind-up with a "bad batch" of their product, I took a careful look at the ingredients list on their cans. Although the print is so small as to make me wish I kept a magnifying glass around the house, it was well worth the time to check out. It turns out that the #1 ingredient in almost every single flavor of this product that I examined is... fish broth. In other words... WATER!!! The only flavors that did not have fish broth as their #1 ingredient in the whole Petite Cusine line-up was Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken. The #1 ingredient in those flavors was chicken. The #2 ingredient in both was chicken broth! Some of the other ingredients included such cat "favorites" as carrots, sweet potatoes and soybean oil. Has anyone ever seen their cat eat carrots, sweet potatoes or soybeans???<br /><br />I can't blame my cat for not liking this stuff. I'm not sure I even want to know what goes into "fish broth", especially being as it comes from Thailand. Do yourself and your cat a favor and read the labels of what actually goes into their food. Spending a bunch of money on "fish water" doesn't sound like a good deal to me.

review/summary: My cat likes the broth
review/text: I read the reviews before I signed up for a subscription for this cat food but, as usual, I didn't believe the negative ones. I was sure my cat would like it because it came in those cute little cans. She does like the can and she'll meow and whine until it's opened. Once in her bowl, she'll lap up the broth and then grudgingly eat the chunks of meat but the smaller ones have to be dumped. I'm signed up for a shipment once every six months but I'll have to rethink that. It was supposed to be a treat for her but if she doesn't like it, it isn't much of a treat. You think?

review/summary: Seems to give our cat more energy.
review/text: I have a huge, overweight cat that I adopted from the pound.  He doesn't eat that much, but he doesn't move much either, which I think causes his weight problem. He normally eats an expensive dry cat food recommended by his vet. When I chose Petite Cuisine, I was a little concerned that it would add to his weight problem, but it seems the opposite has happened.  Within a week, he seemed  to have more energy and has been up playing and chasing invisible mice around the house.  We've never seen him move this much in the two years that we've had him.  I don't know if his diet was missing something that this cat food contains, or if it's just coincidence.  I haven't weighed him, but he seems a little lighter, and he sure acts like he feels better.  We're feeding him half a can a day in addition to his dry cat food.<br /><br />The only downside to the fish flavors is that I notice that the smell hangs in the house, even if I scrub up everything after he eats.

My cat is of course a big fan of seafood derived products and I will give you his response to the four flavors in this variety pack.<br /><br />Red Snapper Entree: Absolutely fantastic, he eats it all with vigor and then looks for more. Very happy with this flavor. This is his favorite.<br /><br />Yellow fin tuna entree: He eats it all but finishes it slowly, not as enthusiastic as with the snapper but he eats it all and seems to enjoy it.<br /><br />Steamed Tuna & Sole Entree: Same as the snapper, he ate it all immediately and wanted more.<br /><br />Steamed Tuna & Shrimp: He ate it all but slowly.<br /><br />All in all this selection of cat food was a wild success with my cat because he can be very finicky and he will snub his nose at many different brands and flavors.<br /><br />Eery cat is different but I usually consider anything seafood based to be a pretty good bet and this selection was a big hit with my cat.<br />5 Stars<br /><br />I couldn't tell you how many brands and flavors I have gone through with my cat just to find things he will eat. SO I am very happy with this selection because he enjoyed and ate all four flavors with no problem.<br /><br />Aout this style of cat food. This is the liquidy type, not the type that is firm. It is much like a thick soup with lots of broth and fish. You can spoon it into the cats dish.- almost pour it.

Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.<br /><br />In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats.

review/summary: Quality cat food
review/text: I gave this to the family cat for Christmas this year and he likes it. He's not a very picky eater for a cat, but he turns his nose up at some things occasionally--this food was not one of those things. The ingredients that are used in the food are surprisingly "sophisticated",and should draw-in some of Amazon's more bourgeois pet owners.

review/summary: Uh-oh
review/text: Okay, the bottom line for this food is that my cat, Buster, wouldn't eat it.  He LOVES canned cat food usually, but is 13 1/2 years old and rather finicky now.  He likes just about any kind of Fancy Feast, though once in a while, being a cat, he will turn up his nose even at that.<br />But I couldn't get him to do more than lick some of the gravy off the first serving I gave him of these chicken-flavored items. Subsequent offerings were met with the floor-scratching response (cat owners usually know this, but the cat is using the same gesture he uses in the litter box, effectively saying "This stuff is c***!").<br />My friends who have cats don't give them canned food - so I have most of this stuff left in my basement awaiting a hungry, interested feline consumer.<br />The product is made in Thailand, which is too close to China for my comfort, anyway.  We all know about recent deaths and problems with Chinese-made pet food (and baby formula!) ingredients.  I considered not using this product at ALL once I noticed it was from Thailand.<br />But Buster made the call, so I didn't have to.

review/summary: Mostly Just Sauce
review/text: The variety pack has two flavors and styles of cat food. Chicken Pot Pie:  be careful when you open the can because it is mostly filled with liquid that could easily spill out. it seems to be little square bite size (for cats) pieces of a chicken-like item, in a broth, mostly broth. Each of my cats, one of whom is a fairly picky eater, both seemed to enjoy this food and ate it straight way. Seemed to enjoy I say, since it turns out my picky eater was actually only lapping up the "soup" or the sauce, and leaving behind the 8 or so little bits of meat like substance (it could actually be chicken, sure looked like it). And frankly, even with the manufacturer's recommendation of what would amount to 6 or more cans a day for my larger 12 lb cat, just not enough food there to satisfy him, mostly liquid.<br /><br />Chinese Chicken: Once again, fairly saucy, but with a much higher meat:sauce ratio, with what looked like a fair amount of shredded chicken. Once again, my picky eater just lapped up the sauce, and my other big guy, who eats anything, really was not interested, no matter how hungry he was.<br /><br />And please tell me why there are little tiny chunks of carrots in each of these? Cats have no interest in carrots, do they have some need for Vit A that is not fulfilled in the supplementation of this food? I doubt it, that is in there for us humans... stupid.<br />I gave this two stars instead of one, because one of my cats quite liked the sauce.

review/summary: Good... If your cat will actually eat it.
review/text: I have to admit, it's nice that Petite Cuisine doesn't have the standard nasty canned cat food smell to it. It actually looks and smells decent, compared to the stuff I'm used to. It also has an overall healthier list of ingredients than most canned cat foods. Normally, that would add up to a five-star meal. The problem is, our cat won't eat the stuff! Granted, she's used to dry cat food but usually she'll scarf down a can of food as a treat. We've tried giving her both kinds of Petite Cuisine that were included (Chinese Chicken and Chicken Pot Pie) a few times each, and she'll lap up the liquid but won't touch the chunks of food. It's left to sit and dry out, until we dump it in the trash. She'll even sit next to her bowl and meow angrily at us, looking at the bowl then looking back up at us, until we dump it out and get her some dry stuff! Overall a disappointing experience on this end, but it's worth a try because every cat is different. You may find that it suites your cat's tastes just fine.

review/summary: Very pricey and not too big of a hit
review/text: I have three cats.  Now mind you, all three of theses cats LOVE to eat.  One cat is part Maine Coon and weighs about 28lbs, one is 17-years with a thyroid condition and constantly wants to eat, the third is the Coon's twin and she is a bit of a glutton.  ANyway, each of these cans has about the equivalent of two tablespoons of food and the rest is all liquid.  That was a reall turnoff for my guys.  The actual protein content LOOKS good, but they all three pretty much turned their noses up at it.  I have been using it as my "emergency supply" but have to say, I would never buy.

review/summary: tasty, not sure about how much tuna is good for cats
review/text: Our cat is enthusiastic about the taste of these fish-flavored Petite Cuisine meals. (I'll try to post a video review also.) However, this assortment has tuna in two-thirds of the flavors. From research online, it seems doubtful that it's good for cats to eat much tuna -- so these are better for occasional treats than for a steady diet. One site even warns that cats can get addicted to the taste of tuna (even though it's not healthy for them) and refuse other food.<br /><br />To cap it all off, tonight my roommate didn't realize it was cat food, and split a can of Petite Cuisine Snapper as part of tonight's dinner for the two of us. On the plate it looked like a little side dish, and I figured it was some kind of leftover. For what it's worth, it tasted fine. However, we plan to feed the rest of the samples to the cat.

review/summary: the 10 cat review.....
review/text: yes, that's right, our family has 10 cats (all rescues), so you can imagine I was pretty stoked when this product came up for review.<br /><br />Now, since I have so many cats, my cats normally only get can food as a treat, maybe once a month. About a third LOVE can food, a third can take it or leave it, and the last third do not like can food at all. When I tried this product on my cats, over two thirds gobbled it up, only one or two showed no interest, and one (who has a sensitive stomach anyway) got sick within five minutes of consumption.<br /><br />The product has a lot of "juice", which I find my cats tend to enjoy. The smell wasn't overpowering like many cat foods.<br />In conclusion, I'd buy Petite Cuisine for my cats but only as a treat.<br />3.5 stars.

review/summary: My, this is popular with the cats!
review/text: "Uh oh," I thought when I saw "Product of Thailand" on the box, with the recent contaminated Chinese wheat gluten scandal reverberating in my memory, however unfairly. (I'm wary of food imports from Third World countries in general now.) Then I saw "People food for cats" and "No gluten" on the outside and figured I'd at least open a can or two to see how the food played with the target audience. We have three cats, two of whom have health problems and are sometimes picky about what they'll eat. From the first can, they have all scarfed this up--even the one with digestive problems who would generally prefer dry food and sometimes needs coaxing to eat. I've never seen her gobble canned food with such gusto, finishing everything down to the last shred and then checking out the others' bowls for remaining scraps (in vain because they like it as much as she does). The food looks like canned fish for humans in sauce--no prefab "morsels." The flavor with shrimp actually has little whole shrimp along with the fish chunks. My only concern now is that they'll dig in their heels when I go back to feeding them the more conventional food that's still filling the cupboard.

review/summary: excellent quality
review/text: This is, at $1 a can, the most expensive cat food that I've purchased.  It seemed overly expensive to me - at first.  the cans are pretty and are only three ounces.  At first, again, that didn't seem like much to me.  But, my preconceived notions went out the window when I saw how my cats loved it.  The pair of kittens kindly took turns eating from one can, but, they scarfed it down and came and begged for more.  The adult cats each have been given one can a day.  These cats NEVER growl at one another, but, when they're eating Petite Cuisine, they growl when another approaches.  They finish each serving, inhaling it like the nectar of the gods.  I'm ashamed that I'd never given this to them before and, despite the somewhat pricey bottom line and small cans, I think that this is one of the most phenomenal gifts that my cats have ever been given.

review/summary: Looks almost like people food!
review/text: My family has two cats who are just over a year old.  We usually feed them dry food, but give them the canned stuff once in a while for a treat.  Our large sized male cat LOVES Petite Cuisine, and gobbles it up.  Our dainty little female though, refuses table scraps and won't touch any wet food, including Petite Cuisine.  My kids helped me to take notes on this food as we offered it to both cats.  The same thing happened with every flavor- little cat A sniffed it and walked away, while big fat cat B ate it up as fast as he could! I guess it's all a matter of preference.<br /><br /> I feel good about the fact that this stuff is natural and looks like food.  it is not full of fillers, and it has everything a cat requires for a healthy diet.  The cans are the right size for a single serving for an average to big cat, so there's no messing around with storing half empty cans of fragrant catfood in the fridge.

They go through food like Sherman through Atlanta and even though I have only had the food for a couple of days, they have eaten six cans!  Little piglets.  I love this food.

review/summary: My cats love it...
review/text: Our cats love soft cat food, so I was not surprised when they quickly devoured Petite Cuisine.<br /><br />One of our cats is allergic to corn products, so I was pleased to discover that Petite Cuisine doesn't contain corn or corn products.  It's also free of wheat gluten.  Vitamin supplements are added into the food - Vitamins E, A, and D3.  Our cats have digested it without any noticeable problems.<br /><br />The 24-can pack contains six cans each of "Red Snapper Entree," "Steamed Tuna & Sole Entree," "Steamed Tuna and Shrimp Entree," and "Yellow Fin Tuna Entree."  Our cats especially love the Yellow Fin Tuna, and they eat every last morsel.  Some pieces get left behind with the Red Snapper and the Tuna and Shrimp flavors, however, maybe because the fish pieces are larger (I suppose I could mash it up for them, though.)  The product's packaging promises "no bad odors," and they're really not that bad -- unless you can't stand the smell of fish.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine seems to be kind of spendy; it costs about twice what you'd pay for a can of Friskies, and the cans of Petite Cuisine are smaller.  After giving my cats Petite Cuisine, I went to the grocery store to look at similar cat food products, and discovered there are several very similar items (to P.C.) on the market, and for a lot cheaper.<br /><br />So yes, there are cheaper options.  But in terms of taste and kitty appreciation, this was a hit.

They followed their portion around like it was the last thing they were ever gonna get to eat!<br /><br />The response ... a resounding purrrrr and then paw-licking/face cleaning!  They loved it!  And that was just the  Steamed Tuna & Sole Entree!!<br /><br />Each day after they got a new flavor, Yellow Fin Tuna, Red Snapper, and Steamed Tuna and Shrimp ... responses were all the same! 2 paws straight up from my kitties!!<br /><br />Highly recommended for humans owned by cats everywhere!!<br />- 1smileycat :-)

review/summary: Reminds Me of Garden Medley
review/text: This cat food looks and smells a lot like the Fancy Feast premium brand, Garden Medley, that comes in the green cans. (Amazing that Fancy Feast, already an expensive, premium brand, would have an even more upscale variety that's even more expensive.) It almost looks like people food. I have eight cats and two ate it immediately and the other six walked away. In the morning, I would find the bowls empty (this is not always the case with other foods, even when they're hungry, they'll ignore some things). I don't know if others changed their minds, or the two who pretty much eat anything came back and cleaned it up. I can't compare prices with this brand because I have never seen it in any store (I live on the East Coast in Virginia, it must be a West Coast brand.)<br /><br />I was put off by the big Made in Thailand lettering on the box because I lived there for two years and it's not a clean country. I was a little worried about what actually was in this food.<br /><br />Since I don't buy Garden Medley because I can't afford it, and I suspect this is in the same price range, I can't honestly say I would buy it. But if your cat loves Garden Medley, and this is a better buy, then it's a good deal.

review/summary: 50/50 response from family cats
review/text: The quality of this cat food is excellent, with fish broth and the named fish (tuna, red snapper, sole, shrimp, or yellowfin) listed as the first (i.e., primary) ingredients.  It is 100% nutritionally complete, with no grain fillers.  When you pop the top on the single-serve can, it looks and smells like exactly what it is -- fish and shrimp.  Obviously, the fish smells like fish, but it's a natural, clean fish smell, not a nasty cat-food odor.  I swear, the steamed tuna and shrimp, with its whole shrimp, looked good enough to set out with crackers for a human appetizer!<br /><br />Although I would feed this food to my cats without hesitation, I felt I had to downgrade it one star because of the cats' opinions.  I fed this to three family cats, and being cats, each had its own opinion, but none endorsed it 100%.  One cat loved the steamed tuna and shrimp, one wouldn't go near it.  One gobbled up the yellowfin tuna, two picked at and left most of it.  My son's cat is notoriously fussy about canned food, and ate only one of these entrees with enthusiasm; my two cats are notoriously unfussy, but ate only two wholeheartedly (however, they usually prefer poultry flavors to fish).<br /><br />Petite Cuisine comes in handy single-serving cans and, as I mentioned, contains excellent ingredients with no foul odor or appearance.  If your cat generally likes fish flavors and you are looking for a high quality, healthy cat food, I would certainly recommend trying Petite Cuisine.

review/summary: 12 cats later.....
review/text: With 12 cats (1 outdoor, 2 part-time outdoor, 9 full-time indoor), it didn't take me long to test this product!<br /><br />What do you get in this package?<br /><br />SIX FOUR-PACKS of cat food. Each serving comes in a small tin, (3 ounces each), 24 tins all total. EACH four-pack includes:<br /><br />-- one Red Snapper Entr&eacute;e<br />-- one Steamed Tuna and Shrimp Entr&eacute;e<br />-- one Steamed Tuna and Sole Entr&eacute;e<br />-- one Yellow Fin Tuna Entr&eacute;e<br /><br />As I said, each tin is a breakfast or supper-sized serving for your cat. These are the smaller-type tins, not the larger Friskies-sized ones (from which I get two servings).<br /><br />I gave each of my cats a tin of this (I included an equal number of each flavor) and just let them go to whichever bowl that they wished, which is how I always feed them (They normally get Science Diet hard food twice daily and then canned catfood once every two days for a special treat). They went after the "gravy" first and, after licking that all up, they ate the chunks of seafood. All the cats ate all the food. These cats are all orphans (former strays) and some were really ferrel when we first took them in -- now they're all spoiled and calm. Most are pretty old (seven of them are over 10 years old). One cat is especially finicky about her food but she ate this product just fine.<br /><br />This catfood (like most catfood) is sort of nasty looking when you open a tin but that's because all the good chunks of meat have settled to the bottom. The fairly clear gravy has some thickness, not watery.<br /><br />I'll give you the ingredients list here from the Red Snapper Entr&eacute;e: fish broth, Tuna filets, Red Snapper Fillets, soy bean oil, tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, calcium sulfate, Carrageenan, vitamins and minerals (Vitamin E supplement, Vitamin A supplement, Vitamin D3 supplement), zinc sulfate, thiamine mononitrate, manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfate complex (source of Vitamin K activity), Riboflavin supplement, folic acid, Pryidoxine hydrochloride, copper amino acid complex, iron amino acid complex.<br /><br />Guarantee analysis: crude protein (min) 13%, crude fat (min) 1.5%, crude fiber (max) 1%, moisture (max) 85%, ash (max) 3%, taurine (min) 0.1%. This catfood contains no Wheat Gluten.<br /><br />The breakdown on all four flavors runs about the same. Two of my cats are diabetic (they each get two insulin injections per day) which means, in the real world, that they throw up quite often. This food did not make them throw up.<br /><br />I can definitely recommend this catfood with these two caveats:<br /><br />-- it's pricey.<br />-- they still like one type of Friskies brand slightly better (they fight over it): Salmon Dinner.<br /><br />Given those two items, this catfood is a winner. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Cat Goes On Hunger Strike
review/text: I received two cases of Petite Cusine from Amazon.com earlier this week. I figured that this would be an easy product to review. After all, what could possibly go wrong with cat food? I have a cat. He eats food. Seems simple enough.<br /><br />Well, here's the problem... My cat, who is well-known for eating just about anything, refuses to touch this stuff. From the rest of the reviews here, you would think that this was some sort of feline version of steak and lobster. My cat refuses to play along though.<br /><br />I guess that I can understand why my cat keeps staring at me with this puzzled look on his face. This is not ordinary cat food. At least not the batch I received. Even before I opened the can, I was struck by the fact that there seemed to be more liquid inside than solid. Sure enough, upon opening the can I found the contents to consist of a LOT, and I mean a LOT, of water. It has more of the consistency of soup than of ordinary cat food. If it were human food, you wouldn't be able to eat it with a fork. You would need a spoon, or maybe even a straw. This seemed to be the case with all of the varieties that I tested on my cat.<br /><br />My cat refuses to eat any of the many flavors of this food I have put in front of him. No, he's not sick, and he seems to have a quite healthy appetite for his regular dry food. I wish that I could come up with even a single positive thing to say about Petite Cusine. Nice looking box? That's about it.

Bear in mind though that this cat denuded a mouse and has gnawed on baby rabbits, so he will eat things that don't smell like seafood and are not on an attractive ceramic plate.<br /><br />I suppose the true taste test would be to partake of it myself, but Amazon Vine, I'm not willing to go there, even for you.<br /><br />The cans are on the smaller side, the smell was not overpowering. The product is made in Thailand, if that information would help you decide whether to purchase.<br /><br />Personally, I'm sticking to Red Lobster for my seafood. But I can't take my cat there.

review/summary: My Cat Loves It
review/text: Granted, my cat does not have the most discriminating taste (I've seen him happily munching on lizards and cockroaches), but I can tell he really likes this food. He usually breezes by whenever he feels like it to eat the dry food I leave in his bowl. Since I have been giving him Petite Cuisine, he is ready and waiting by his bowl at meal time. I have to push his head out of the way so that I can finish emptying the can into his dish.<br /><br />Most canned cat foods look like fishy hummus or strange, extruded rubbery strips, but this food looks just like what you get when you open a can of tuna, except with more sauce. The shrimp flavor has tiny recognizable shrimp in it.<br /><br />Full Crazy Cat Lady Disclosure: Before I would let my babies eat a new cat food, I did a little (ok, hours) of due diligence research on Petite Cuisine. After the Chinese pet food debacle, I wasn't about to let them eat food produced by an unknown foreign entity. According to what I could find on the internet, PetPlay Inc. is a relatively new American startup by CEO Eric Weber. He has years of experience with the premium cat food market; was part of the team that launched the Fancy Feast brand and ran the Friskies Japan division (both part of the Nestle SA family).<br /><br />(According to the SoCal Buzz podcast I listened to, he even worked for Hello Kitty. I particularly loved his remark about cat owners being "a little more illogical" than other pet owners, therefore they are more likely to spend money for premium products - I resemble that remark.)<br /><br />Yes, the cat food is produced in Thailand, but it is not associated with any of the companies involved in recalls for Thailand or China, and is not on any of the FDA's lists. They have nutritional facts and a nutrient analysis for each product readily available on their website [...]

review/summary: Two Paws Up!!
review/text: I cannot really comment my own opinions on this product since for obvious reasons I will not be sampling it but I will trust the vendor that it is every bit as good for my cat as they say.  How would I know differently anyway?  All I can tell you is my cat's reaction.  This consisted of the following:<br /><br />"Meowwwww! Errowwww!" (as I am dishing it out)  After placing it on the floor there was copious munching and slurping until the bowl was empty followed by licking of chops to devour anyy stray morsel that may have stuck to a whisker and then a forlorn look that indicated the preceding events should be repeated.  I'll take that as two paws up or whatever the feline equivalent is to the Siskel & Ebert sign of approval.<br /><br />None of this is any great surprise.  The noted finickiness of cats usually applies to dry food.  Place a bowl of any random dead animal parts in front of them and they are far more decisive.  Still, this was an especially energetic performance and hence the high rating.

review/summary: Actually smells pretty good!
review/text: Unlike other fish catfood, this product does not have that strong fishy smell.  Nice flaky chunks of fish in some nice gravy.<br /><br />However Ms Cassiopia lapped up the gravy and left the fish.  This has happened with other food so it is no reflection on the product.<br /><br />I would have given it 5 stars but since I won't be buying it, I gave it 4.  If your cat will eat food other than pate, you will want to give this a try.  Looks almost like something you would eat.<br /><br />I have given the remainder of the package to a less fortunate friend.<br />Her cat will probably eat it and expect it all the time.<br /><br />Thank you!<br />MEF

review/text: This is a great product for a finicky cat. It's really very rich as the ingredients are pure and there is no filler, which is great. Our cats love it more than Fancy Feast or any other higher end cat food!!! A can is eaten up in minutes!!!!<br /><br />Our dogs, of course, love cat food and want to partake in the feast!!!

review/summary: You can see this is quality food when you open the can
review/text: I have 3 cats.  2 are inside and 1 is outside.  They all loved this food, especially my outdoors cat.  Unfortunately, my dog liked it even more, and it became a bit of a problem keeping him away while they were eating, and it normally is not a problem.  He is a very picky dog who loves fish, so I could tell by his reaction that the seafood taste was definitely good.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the can, I could see that this food includes real flake tuna - it is not very much different in appearance than Starkist tuna in the can for people.  It does not have that terrible smell that some wet catfoods do, (Like the Meow Mix Wholesome Goodness).  That is nice, because with some catfoods if you open the can and some flys on you, you have to go shower or smell like a fishmarket.  This food is not stinky like that.  It has a good enough smell to excite the cats, but the human noses here did not smell it in our trash or from across the room.<br /><br />I watched my cats closely, and my dog as well, since he got 'into it' and it treated their digestive systems well. Sometimes new food will make them sick, but this food did not in the least.<br />I am only giving this a 4 star because my cats did not finish the red snapper flavor either time I put it down for them.  They ate maybe 1/2 of it.  I don't think they liked that particular flavor as well as the others.  They ALL liked the yellowfin tuna the best.

review/summary: Pricey but my cats love it
review/text: Petite cuisine is probably the best cat food I have ever bought for my cats.  Open the can and it looks and smells like people food.  The ingredients are basically fish, vitamins, and minerals.  There are no meat by-products or fish by-products and if you know what "by-products" are you will be happy about that. If you are concerned about your pet's health, this is a great food. And if your cat is finicky about what she eats, then this is a wonderful food.<br /><br />This size variety pack is quite a savings over the 4-packs so if you are sure your cats will like it then it is worth it to buy this size.  Some cats don't mind having the same food every day and some cats might not like each flavor so whether to get the variety pack of 24 or the single flavor pack of 24 is up to you and your cat.  My cats love all 4 flavors and I'll bet your fish loving cat will too!

review/summary: made my kitties into addicts
review/text: We have three cats. The two older ones are huge, 10-year-old DSH males, litter mates, who have been separated about 5 days their entire lives and have had just about the best of everything all along. The third is a 5-year-old Siamese male who adopted us as a tiny kitten; he was malnourished and his physical condition showed it when he came to my back porch 4.5 years ago.<br /><br />All are at healthy weights and are active. The big cats are not obese - they're just large cats. I always have dry IAMS available as kibble 24/7, and I give them each a portion of canned food a couple of times a day; they do not ask for food unless they are hungry. The older cats don't like poultry or beef (read: loudly whine for seafood when presented with chicken, in stunned disbelief that I'm not running a restaurant after the 5,391 times they've already complained). The Siamese isn't as picky because he was a stray until he found us. Mushy, gooey loaf? Won't eat it at all. Texture is important.<br /><br />I had not heard of this brand before I saw it here on Amazon.com and I have not seen it locally. Since my little monsters enjoy food, like this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010B6IFY">Fancy Feast Gourmet Cat Food Grilled 3-Flavor Variety Pack, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>,  I thought I'd try the 'Subscribe & Save' option for a couple of months to see if they like Petite Cuisine too.<br /><br />Verdict: they're absolutely nuts about it. We call it 'kitty crack' - if there was a rehab or 12-step program for addicted cats, I'd have to send all three of mine for treatment. They can't get enough of it.<br /><br />This is definitely not fish 'flavored' food. The cans are chock full of fish, with tiny shrimp, flaky red snapper, tuna, and whitefish. It smells like fish but it doesn't have a fishy or stale odor. The cans open easily and not much sticks to the bottom and sides of the can - I can just dump food into a bowl without using a utensil to get the last bits out. The aroma and appearance are so good that _I'd_ eat it if I had to do so.<br /><br />I have read and noted concerns about menadione. However, high doses mentioned in some studies aren't equivalent to the small amount contained per portion in this food. To me, the benefits outweigh the risks. Best of all, my Siamese has developed a shiny, thick, ultra-soft coat which he did not have before he started eating this food. He's almost as soft as a chinchilla.<br /><br />In short: looks great, smells great, and I have happy, happy cats. A winner. :-)

review/summary: Great Food, Bad CS
review/text: First of all, I am subscribed to receive two boxes of the variety pack every month. My cats LOVE the food and refuse to eat other canned food. I have tried to give them more expensive, better quality food but they only want Petite Cuisine.<br /><br />That said, I am quite disappointed at P.C.'s customer service. After researching on menadione, I emailed P.C. and asked if they plan to not use menadione in near future. I never heard back from them. Before this, I received an email from them with a coupon code. I tried to copy and paste the code on their web site and it didn't work. I emailed their CS and they told me that the coupon was working. Come to find out, they misspelled the coupon on the email. The code contained the word "cuisine" and they misspelled it. I emailed them back about it and they didn't responded nor sent out another email with the correction. Very disappointing indeed...<br /><br />In the future, if I find another brand that did not contain menadione and had better customer service, and I would instantly switch over to the new brand. Well, my cats have to like the new food too, which is why I haven't able to give them something else yet.

review/summary: Cuisine for kitties
review/text: We've gone through all of the flavors now three times.  Both cats chowed down quite happily on the food.  The boy got quite vocal and insistent the next few days about how much he wanted more of the wet food.  Far, far more vocal than he got after getting the 9 Lives canned food before.  Judging from that it seems to be tastier.<br /><br />It definitely looks more appealing to me.  Actual flakes of fish, small shrimp, no unpleasant smell beyond a slight seafood smell.  After putting the food into a bowl the can doesn't look nasty either.  White interior, no discoloration spots.  A quick rinse gets rid of any remaining juices before tossing the can in the recycle bin.<br /><br />Can is made of aluminum, not steel.  Cans are opened with a pull-tab, no can opener required.  The other cat food we had varied; some flavors had a tab on the can to open it and others required a can opener.  In our house it's much nicer when it has a tab to open.  Otherwise I had to go hunting for the can opener after pulling the bowls out of the cupboard.  And of course the cats heard the clang of the bowls coming out of the cupboard which meant they appeared within seconds and promptly started exclaiming how much they wanted the wet stuff while weaving in between the legs in an attempt to get me to give them the food as fast as possible.  We all know how difficult it can be to dodge cats weaving around underfoot  while digging through drawers and cupboards searching for the can opener.<br /><br />Amusingly, the label lists the product as being gluten free.  Not something I expected to see on the label.<br /><br />Overall we're pleased.  I'm not offended by the way the product looks or smells  and the cats love it.  My only complaint is that it is rather pricey compared to other options.<br /><br />Update Feb 17, 2009:<br />Well, after trying this I started sampling some other upscale cat foods.  I also started reading the ingredients.  I had no idea that wheat gluten was such a common ingredient.  Now that makes sense.<br /><br />As for price, it is close to the price range for other upscale / premium / gourmet (whatever you want to call the  small expensive cans) cat foods. Without subscribe & save the pricing is a bit higher here compared to what the other premium foods go for in the local stores.  With subscribe & save there isn't as much difference.<br /><br />I didn't think I would want to spend this much on cat food yet I just ordered some more.  To me there is significant value in that it doesn't have that 'canned cat food' smell.  You know what I'm talking about, and it really isn't a great way to wake up in the morning.  It also helps that Petite Cuisine is more visually appealing than the other stuff.<br /><br />The menadione thing?  From what I can find that may be valid.  Most of the stuff online references (and quotes) one article but the material safety sheet does have notes about toxicity of the substance to human organs at high doses.  It is in other pet foods as well, not just Petite Cuisine, so if you're concerned about it you need to read the label of any product.<br /><br />I did contact the company asking about it and stated that I was concerned about its use in their product.  If enough people contact them about it explaining their concern they may rethink using it as an ingredient.  For me, I'll probably use it in rotation with other foods.  Hopefully I can find something that doesn't stink and doesn't have any potentially objectionable ingredients.

review/summary: good food, but may not please picky cats
review/text: After trying all the flavors I found that 2 of my cats love this food.  The 3rd cat, notoriously picky, will only eat the yellowfin flavor.  He doesn't seem to like foods with whole chunks in them, but he is very fond of thinner foods with gravy.  There is less gravy in these cans than you find in "regular" store bought food, which means you get more actual food.  Good for us, but not so good for my picky cat who wants nothing but gravy!<br /><br />It's somewhat comforting to see recognizable bits of food in the cans.  The shrimp in the tuna & shrimp flavor especially is neat - they're whole salad shrimp.  Also, the food sits well with them.  The price isn't much more than what you'd pay for good food at a pet shop.  All in all I would recommend trying this.

review/summary: Healthy Feline Cuisine For Your Finicky Cat(s)
review/text: Most people know that cats can be finicky eaters.  They devour some food and simply walk away from others.  I guess that is one trait that I find most interesting about our three Bengal cats.  They can eat like horses and yet are rather picky about what foods they will eat.  They all like tuna, ham, and even beg for a potato chip from time to time, yet they don't seem to care for turkey and even some types of cheese.  My family and I love our cats very much, and we are concerned about their health and want to feed them nutritious food.  Since all of our Bengals love chicken, I was delighted to recently have the opportunity to try the new Petite Cuisine Chinese Chicken and Chicken Pot Pie Variety Pack.<br /><br />We received a 24 pack, which includes 6 individual boxes, each containing two 3 oz. cans of Sesame Chicken and two 3 oz. cans of Chicken Pot Pie cat food.  The ingredients for each flavor are as follows:<br /><br />Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;e:  Chicken, Chicken broth, Carrots, Sesame oil, Soy bean oil, Rice, Tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, Tapioca starch, Calcium sulfate, Salt, Vitamins & Minerals (Vitamin E, Vitamin A, Vitamin D3, Zinc sulfate, Thaimine mononitrate, Manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfite complex &lt;source of vitamin K>, Riboflavin, Folic acid, Pyridoxine hydrochloride, Copper amino acid complex, Iron amino acid complex), Carrageenan, Choline chloride, Taurine.<br /><br />Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e:  Chicken, Chicken broth, Sweet Potato, Carrots, Soy bean oil, Tapioca starch, Tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, Calcium sulfate, Olive oil, Vitamins & Minerals (Vitamin E, Vitamin A, Vitamin D3, Zinc sulfate, Thaimine mononitrate, Manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfite complex &lt;source of vitamin K>, Riboflavin, Folic acid, Pyridoxine hydrochloride, Copper amino acid complex, Iron amino acid complex), Carrageenan, Choline chloride, Taurine.<br /><br />As you can see, the ingredients in the two flavors are nearly identical.  One controversial ingredient contained in both flavors is Menadione Sodium Bisulfite, which is a synthetic version of vitamin K.  MSB has been called "potentially harmful" by many researchers, and is not allowed in human food.  However, the FDA does not restrict the use of MSB in pet foods, and these pet foods are even able to proudly claim "Natural" on the label, even if it contains this un-natural ingredient.  Studies indicate that Menadione Sodium Bisulfite can be toxic in high doses, and the tests indicate that this synthetic vitamin supplement can prove toxic to kidneys, lungs, liver, and mucous membranes.  Since I only use the Petite Cuisine food as a supplement to my cat's regular food, I don't consider the levels of MSB to be high enough to put my animals in any danger.  However, it is up to the owner to determine if they find this risk acceptable or not.  You can find more information about Menadione (Vitamin K3) here:<br /> http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?page=menadione<br /><br />The manufacturer website (http://www.petitecuisine.com) says that "Petite Cuisine is People Food for Cats."  There is no wheat gluten, no grain fillers, and no meat byproducts.  The label on the cans says "Product of Thailand", and the website boasts that nothing about this food is sourced from China.  All of the meat and vegetables are steam cooked, and each variety is hand packed into each and every can (according to the manufacturer).<br /><br />We have been feeding the Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken Petite Cuisine entr&eacute;es to our three Bengal cats for the past several days now.  We dispense one can onto a saucer for all three cats to share, once each day.  One thing my wife and I really like about this food is that it doesn't have an unpleasant odor, like most canned pet foods.  It smells like chicken and gravy, and although neither of us are daring enough to try a taste ourselves, our noses tend to support the claim that this is "people food for cats."  The chicken pot pie entr&eacute;e contains several chunks of white meat chicken, along with small bits of sweet potato and carrots, all swimming in an ocean of gravy (or broth, sauce, or whatever you wish to call it).  The food looks good, but I feel that there is just too much gravy, and it could prove to be messy when serving or during feeding.  The sesame chicken entr&eacute;e contains shredded chicken (not chunks), along with bits of carrots and rice in a far more reasonable amount of gravy.  Both entr&eacute;es look good and smell good, but how do the cats like it?  Well as we observed our cats when we served up the food, here is what we found:<br /><br />Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e:  Asia, our 3 year old female Bengal, greedily devours the hearty chunks of chicken and veggie bits, but leaves most of the gravy behind.  Neo, our 10 month old male Bengal, also enjoys the chicken and licks up quite a bit of the gravy, but doesn't seem at all interested in the bits of sweet potato and carrots.  Matrix, our 2 year old male Bengal always approaches the food, sniffs at it for several seconds, and ultimately walks away without eating any.  Matrix will take a little taste, every now and then, but isn't interested in eating any quantity of it.<br /><br />Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;e:  Asia again scarfs down the chicken and veggies, but leaves behind the rice and gravy.  Neo seems to eat a little bit of everything.  Matrix again sniffs at the food but will not eat any of it.<br /><br />So overall we have encountered very mixed results with our three cats.  Of course they are cats, so being somewhat finicky is only natural.  Two of the three seem to really enjoy the Petite Cuisine chicken entr&eacute;es, while the third doesn't care for it at all.  So would we buy this variety of Petite Cuisine in the future?  Well I think we will likely try some of the other varieties first, to see if we can get all three cats to enjoy the food.  Petite Cuisine also makes Yellow Fin Tuna, Red Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp, and New England Crab Cake varieties, which all sound like something our cats would like.  We are going to order the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDDTB2">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and see how our cats like these varieties. My wife and I both feel that Petite Cuisine produces great quality food, with high quality ingredients, and we will certainly buy more of their products in the future.  I do admit that I wish they didn't use the synthetic Vitamin K supplement (Menadione), simply because so many others have expressed real concern about the potential risks of this ingredient.  Many other manufacturers have removed this ingredient from their products, so maybe PetPlay, Inc. (makers of Petite Cuisine) will omit this synthetic ingredient in the future if enough consumer concern is expressed.  I do recommend the Petite Cuisine chicken varieties of cat food to other cat owners, but do so with a bit of caution due to the inclusion of the controversial Menadione Sodium Bisulfite ingredient.  If Petite Cuisine tastes as good as it looks and smells, then I am sure all but the most finicky cats will enjoy it a great deal.

review/summary: So Far the Kitties Aren't Buying It
review/text: UPDATE to the review below: First I'd like to downgrade this to a two star, but the system won't let me...well, would a 1 & 1/2 actually, but it really won't let me do that.<br /><br />NEITHER cat ever became fond of this, and we stopped using it completely when I found two 1" bones and several smaller bone chunks in one of the cans of the "Snapper" flavour.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: We have two cats: Bruegel, a 16 year old female who is very petite and very picky, and Banjo, a 7 year old male who is very large and quite indiscriminate in his choice of what to eat. Bruegie mostly only likes wet food especially tuna (Sheba Tuna entr&eacute;e is her favorite)...oh, and cheese; we call her the cheese-monger. Banjo mostly likes dry food; he has become carbo-kittie...he begs for bread and crackers.<br /><br />Now that the intended consumers have been introduced, here's their review: Eh, I'm bored.<br /><br />When I looked at the can, I was overjoyed. No wheat gluten and all natural ingredients plus a few vitamins. When I opened the first can, I was even happier; Bruegie likes the foods with more liquid in them and these are fish chunks and lots of liquid. However, when I set the plates down, they were ignored. When it was time for clean-up, most of the food was still there. We have now gone through every flavour in the box...with the same result.<br /><br />The first time we set down a can of Sheba (which wasn't too long ago) Bruegie was all over it and Banjo tried to muscle in. When we are feeding her something she can tell is her favorite (from the smell when we open the can, I suppose,) Bruegie will beg...none of that.<br /><br />All that said, as any cat owner will tell you, EVERY cat is different... and next week, we might be looking at clean plates, but for now the Capehart-Stephenson Kitties are having none of this. The three stars are for the ingredients, hopefully your cats will like it more than ours.

review/summary: Good enough to eat--literally!
review/text: I am careful about the food that I select for my cats because I want them to be healthy.  Unlike dogs, cats are strict carnivores, so any fillers in cat food are unnecessary and potentially harmful.  Also, cats have a very short digestive tract, so though fiber is good for humans, it is not important for cats.  Finding a cat food that meets these stipulations takes quite a bit of research.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine makes the mark.  The first three ingredients in each of the formulations in these variety packs are fish broth, and two different fish meats.  There is no trace of any grain fillers, and of course no wheat gluten, which was the source of the melanine tainting that has now killed and sickened humans as well as pets.<br /><br />The guaranteed analysis on the cat foods is crude protein - 13% min, crude fat - 1.5% min, crude fiber - 1% max, moisture - 85% max, ash - 3% max, and taurine 0.1% min.<br /><br />My cats of course love it.  They even seem to take a little time to savor the meal, and the food has caused zero digestive difficulties.<br /><br />The consistency is similar to a can of BumbleBee tuna, with fish chunks in a broth.  In fact, I could probably use this cat food to make a tuna fish salad, and no human would be the wiser (except for the accusatory and incriminating looks of the cats.)<br /><br />The recommended daily ration for this cat food for an adult cat is 1-2 cans per 2 1/2 pounds of body weight, which is a bit higher than my other canned cat food.<br /><br />Overall, this is the finest cat food that I've come across so far.  I'll probably use it as a supplement to brand that I feed as a mainstay.

review/summary: Best cat food ever
review/text: My cat is a picky eater and I'm a picky owner in that I don't want to feed him by-products, preservatives or other questionable ingredients.  When I found this cat food, he loved it and I loved the simple ingredients.  If I ate meat, I'd have a hard time telling the difference between this and actual human food if both were set before me for dining pleasures.  The food doesn't have that nasty characteristic cat food smell.  I don't know if I can attribute it to this food, but my cat's breath doesn't stink (I've had several cats in my life, and smelly breath was generally a constant).  My only complaint about this food is that all of my local grocers and pet stores don't stock it.  I wish it was more readily available in my town.  Also, I wish the ingredients were sourced in the good ole US of A.  Aside from these points, it's a fantastic cat food and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality food for their special buddy.

review/summary: Excellent product
review/text: I have a Bengal cat and was looking for a good quality food that had the taurine she needs. She was very thin when I got her (a rescue) and was a bit picky. I tried a large number of foods including some quite expensive ones, and this, by far, is the best I've found. The quality appears to be excellent. It has a high amount of taurine and the vitamins she needs to be healthy. The food looks and smells like our food!!!..with chunks of chicken and pieces of carrot in the "pot pie" and shredded chicken whichs smells just like the real thing in the "Sesame Chicken". This product (and the fish variety pack) is all I buy for her now. She eats every bit at each meal and looks absolutely wonderful!!!

review/summary: Slurp. It's gone.
review/text: I discovered Petite Cuisine when I tried to switch my 13-year-old cat from dry food to canned; I tried every variety of canned food, and while he wouldn't touch any other brand, he inhaled this stuff. I'm a vegetarian, but Petite Cuisine looks more like real chicken/fish than anything I've seen - actual, identifiable strips of meat!  What a concept.<br /><br />My new kittens love it as well, and Chicken Pot Pie is by far their favorite flavor.  It's got a little more fat than the fish flavors, but still well within the AAFCO guidelines. It's also a little more expensive; you can usually get 24-packs of fish flavors for $18 if you go to the manufacturer's web site. But the chicken pot pie makes a great treat for a healthy dinner.<br /><br />But: check out Joe's post about menadione.

review/summary: Cats love it -- but I am concerned
review/text: This variety pack came to us as an Amazon Vine program sample.  Our two cats have been living on various "high end" dry cat foods for some time now (e.g., the "Before Grain" foods in chicken, tuna and salmon versions, and some fancy pantsy "Duck a l'orange" stuff from our local pet shop).  They have not been partial to canned foods, nor have I often gone the canned food route because it is less than convenient and didn't seem worth the candle since they seem to favor dry food (and mice and birds and whatever else they can glean from our little acre in the woods).  They typically start out loving canned food, but after a few bites, the rest sits in the bowl and dries out before we toss it and go back to the dry food they've grown to love.<br /><br />However, both of our cats are smitten by this stuff.  It looks like real food out of the can, with large chunks of fish and seafood in a thickened broth.  It doesn't have the strong fishy smell of most canned foods and looks like something I could almost be tempted to eat my self in a pinch.  The 3 ounce size makes it perfect for a "treat" for the cats between feedings of dry food and they leave nothing behind when we dump a can in their dish (with some added hot water as they really love the broth).<br /><br />But I'm not sure I want my cats eating this stuff for the same reason I don't want my eight year old eating at fast food franchises, much as she might love the food and snarf it up in a flash -- I'm concerned this food may not be a healthy thing for the animal eating it or for the planet. Seeing "Made in Thailand" emblazoned on the box made me immediately wonder whether this stuff might include ingredients banned in the US or could otherwise be manufactured without adequate regulation of methods and materials.  The Chinese pet food fiasco certainly came to mind.<br /><br />The discussions of other reviewers about the menadione used in this product confirms my concern.  I'm also left to wonder about the source of the fish and seafood in these cans -- is it farm raised in Thailand and if so under what conditions; is it wild fish that may be subject to overfishing and at the very least ought to be feeding hungry humanity rather than going down my cats' gullets; what about mercury and other contaminants in the food?<br /><br />Bottom line: my cats seem to love the stuff, but I'm not sure that will be sufficient to convince me to buy it again.

The article identified protein rich, nutritionally balanced cat food.  My TWO cats did not like the chicken types, but LOVE the red snapper, tuna and shrimp, tuna and sole and yellow fin tuna.  I get the combo in the 4 pack.<br />I would recommend switching over from dry food to wet slowly so there's no upset stomachs.  I think your cats will like this food, even if they are picky, like mine.

We especially like the Chinese Chicken (mom said the package actually calls it "Sesame Chicken", but we can't read, so it doesn't matter).  The Pot Pie entr&eacute;e had an awful lot of broth and not a lot of meat.  But we licked the bowl clean anyway.  Mom says she likes this because it doesn't have a strong, icky smell like some canned cat food.  But she says that it would take a lot of these cans to feed it to us all the time (1-2 cans per 2.5 lbs of our weight - she said something about how Lilith could stand to lose a a pound or two or three), so we'll just get a couple of cans along with our dry food.  Maybe if we ignore the dry food she'll get the message, but she can be pretty stubborn!

review/summary: It's okay
review/text: I usually give my cats canned food as a treat, so I thought I would give this a try for them.<br /><br />Like the other reviews the ingredients list was nice, there were a few ingredients I wasn't sure about like carrageenan and menadione sodium bisulfite but they all turned out to be a mineral supplement or a thickening agent.<br /><br />I opened the chicken pot pie first. Very watery with pea sized chunks of chicken, tiny bits of carrots and what looks like onion in it. It smelled like cat food.<br /><br />The sesame chicken also smelled like cat food, mind you not like a horrible smell, but if you put that and the actual chicken pot pie or sesame chicken in front of me blindfolded I'd be able to tell which was which just from the smell, it's a cat food smell. Anyway, the sesame chicken had pea sized chicken bits in it along with carrots and rice and a hint of sesame oil aroma to it.<br /><br />Minion Number Two is my picky eater (no, that's a nickname). He liked the juice and ate a few bits of the meat then went to his regular cat food, even side by side he still didn't eat the treat.<br /><br />Minion Number One (also a nickname) will eat most natural foods from potatoes, hamburger to whole wheat bread. He too enjoyed the juice a lot, ate a few pieces of the chicken then wandered off. He never came back to finish it.<br /><br />It gets three stars. Two for the ingredients and one that my cats like the juice. It doesn't get five because one, the price, I can see why it's more (because of the ingredients) but my cats will finish off other cans of cat food that are only half the price which is point two, being two adult male cats with hearty appetites they didn't like it enough to finish it.

review/summary: I'm sorry to say that things did not go well with this food
review/text: The chicken pot pie variety was extremely runny, interestingly that seemed to be the only part my cats ate, the licked up the broth.  But they literally nosed the potatoes and carrots right off their plates.  It was like watching picky toddlers.  I divided one can between three cats and I still had about a half a can left after they ate.  I also watched as they finished all three cats ran to the litter box. (apparently it comes out watery too)<br /><br />One of my cats - the little vixen whose part siamese then went and did a protest in my laundry hamper.<br /><br />So when they tried the seasame chicken I only gave it to the two critters who don't voice their displeasure so eloquently.  They still did not finish their meals, again the carrots hit the floor, and perhaps the most suprising, normally when I open a can of cat food they come a running, not so on either opening, and even though the company claims the food smells more appealing, I disagree, as did the cats.<br /><br />So it's 3 stars because at least they ate some of it, but I'm very sorry to say they didn't appear to like it.  If you would like to try a sampler package of this product you can access that through their website.  All the packaging is recyclable, this product is made in Thailand, and claims to be all natural:<br /><br />The chicken pot pie lists the following information:<br />Chicken, Chicken broth,Sweet Potato,Carrots,Soy bean oil,Trialcium phosphate,Tapioca Starch,Calcium Sulfate,Olive Oil, Vitamins and Minerals,Vitamin E supplement,Vitamin A supplement,Vitamin D3 supplement,Zinc Sulfate,Thiamine Mononitrate,Manganese sulfate,Menadione sodium bisuifite complex (source of vitamin K activity),Riboflavin supplement,Folic acid,Pyridoxine hydrochloride,<br />Copper amino acid complex,Iron amino acid complex<br />Carrageenan,Cholinechloride,Taurine,Xanthan Gum<br /><br />Chicken Pot Pie: Protein: 12% Min.<br />Fat: 1% Min.<br />Ash: 3% Max.<br />Fiber: 1% Max.

review/summary: Quality Product, But Not What My Cat Would Prefer
review/text: I purchaed the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDDTB2">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCVY8I">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  My cat enjoyed this selection okay, but it seemed like he was much happier with the seafood sampler.  This picture on the box looks like something very similar to human food, but the actual contents weren't as close as I had hoped.  I try more and more to buy food that are more natural and less processed.  These claimed to be full of vitamins and 100 percent of the required nutrition.  That might be the case, but my cat sure didn't get all of his nutrition.  Where as he would drink all of the liquid from the seafood flavors, he didn't much care for the abundance of chicken flavored gravies.  The large amount of gravy and small veggies in the Chicken Pot Pie flavor were not to his liking.  He eventually ate pretty much all of it, but not right away - which for a large cat on a diet like my cat - is ultra rare at my house.  He actually begged for something to eat while he still had the rest of the Chicken Pot Pie in his bowl.<br /><br />This food makes some good claims about the quality and I agree the food does look better than anything you get from a local Superstore for 25 cents a can.  My cat is a 12 year old Tabby Manx with some minor health issues.  His well being is important enough that I will buy better made food instead of just cheap stuff... but when it starts going to waste... and at a higher cost to me?  I consider this to be a one time only purchase and do not plan to reorder even if it's on sale.  Nothing against this company, but I think they would do better with a variety pack of 6-8 flavors with only one chicken flavor for every 5 or so other flavors.  If my cat doesn't like it today, then imagine what it will be like in a week when he has had it 7 days in a row.  More than likely most of these cans will go to the dog just so they won't be completely wasted.<br /><br />If you also tried this pack and your cats turned up their noses to it, then I'd recommend the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack of seafood flavors instead if your cat is more of meat-eater than a vegetable / gravy eater.

review/summary: One out of three cats partially liked it
review/text: I have three cats, one is 12 years old (Fred), one is 9 years old (Jewel) and a kitten that is 4 months old (Angel).  The kitten is very finicky and was recently weaned off her milk; the other two will eat almost anything.<br /><br />I first served the 'Chicken Pot Pie' flavor to the cats.  Visually, the canned food looks very appealing to me.  The look and smell is very similar to chicken pot pie - real pieces of shredded white meat chicken in a savory sauce.  The food was not watery at all; more like the consistency of a store bought frozen chicken pot pie filling.<br /><br />The kitten refused to eat the Chicken Pot Pie.  Fred licked a tiny amount and ran away.  No amount of coaxing him could get him to return for another taste.  Jewel licked away at the juices but did not eat the meat, which is typical for her.  She later returned to nibble some more but did not seem overly satisfied.<br /><br />Overall, I would call the Chicken Pot Pie a failure as nearly 60% of it was left in the bowl.<br /><br />Next up was the Sesame Chicken.  Suspicious, I read the label and was surprised to find that there were no organ meats, no denatured meat byproducts and no wheat gluten.  It is not made in China.  It looked good and smelled pretty good too...<br /><br />Again, the kitten refused to touch it.  She is very particular about what she eats, so this is understandable.  This time, Fred ate about 1/3 of it and Jewel did not want anything to do with it.<br /><br />Although the ingredients, nutrition and place of origin are important, in the end, it all comes down to whether my cats will eat the food.  I was disappointed that my cats did not care for this food.<br /><br />I must say, however, that cats are very particular animals.  Even though my cats did not like it, your cats might devour it in an instant.  As for quality, I give this food high marks.  It looks edible and smells like real food.<br /><br />Bottom line - I would recommend purchasing a sample before you go out and get a whole box.

review/summary: Pleasing for the cat and for me - a good alternative for my Fancy Feast Elegant Medleys addict
review/text: My cat is addicted to Fancy Feast Elegant Medleys.  It doesn't matter if I buy him expensive or cheap alternatives; he won't touch it unless it has those garden greens!  When I saw the new offerings from Petite Cuisine, I decided to give it a try with him.  After all, they have some veggie content, which I figured might appease his tastes.<br /><br />There are a few things I look for in a wet cat food.  First, I want it to have real ingredients listed.  I don't like for it to have by-products.  (FF:EM does, but he's addicted, so I suppress my concern by giving him great-for-him dry food)  Second, I don't want it to stink.  If it turns my stomach when I open a can, I don't care how much he likes it, I'm not serving it.  Third, it needs to come out of the can easily.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine met or exceeded all of my basic criteria.  Next was the big question:  would my addict take to this new brand?<br /><br />With FF:EM, my cat usually begs for it, sniffs it, and then wanders off.  He returns at his leisure at some point and chows down the whole mass in one sitting.  Occasionally, he will wolf it down immediately. So, consider that the baseline behavior.  He has self-feeding access to dry food, and he gets a 3-oz can of wet food at most twice a day (sometimes he doesn't seem to want the second can).<br /><br />I fed him his first Petite Cuisine can from this box, in Chicken Pot Pie flavor, as his second feeding for the day.  I was surprised that this flavor really seemed like a soup and had real (I'm assuming) pieces of carrot and corn.  It really looks like people food.  He seemed to really enjoy the "soupy" broth.  This was his second daily feeding and yet he gulped it down for awhile before wandering off.  He came back later in the evening and finished off the rest.  Success!<br /><br />The next day, I started him with a can of the Sesame Chicken.  It smelled pleasantly like Asian food.  His reaction was to sniff and wander off.  After 12 hours, he hadn't touched it but had eaten a large helping of dry food.  So, he was clearly hungry, but didn't want to touch this flavor.  I washed the remains away and gave him a can of FF:EM.  It was gone within a minute.<br /><br />So, I wondered if he'd just been particularly hungry on the Pot Pie day.  A few mornings later, I did Pot Pie for the morning feeding, and I observed the same behavior.  He drank the broth right away and came back later to finish off the bits.  I also re-tested the Sesame Chicken on a day when I knew he was hungry, and he ignored it steadily.  Clearly, my kitty has preferences.  I have tried some other Petite Cuisine flavors (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDDTB2">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>) that are available on Amazon.  He will chow down on Tuna & Shrimp flavor but generally doesn't seem to like the other seafood PC flavors (though he will eat them if left with them, unlike the Sesame Chicken reaction).<br /><br />My point is that my cat is picky, and he will eat at least some flavors of this happily even though he's rejected MANY high-quality foods in the past.  It is nice to have an alternative to the one brand.  I'm also happier with him eating this food given the good ingredients and pleasant appearance and scent.<br /><br />I do want to add/note that there are many folks who are mentioning that the food is more liquid than substance.  That is definitely true for the Pot Pie flavor, but it is not true for Petite Cuisine in general.  The Pot Pie is definitely made to resemble soup.

EACH four-pack includes:<br /><br />-- two Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;es<br />-- two Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;es<br /><br />As I said, each tin is a breakfast or supper-sized serving for your cat. These are the smaller-type tins, not the larger Friskies-sized ones (from which I get two servings).<br /><br />I gave each of my cats a tin of this (I included half of one flavor, and half of the other) and just let them go to whichever bowl that they wished, which is how I always feed them (They normally get Science Diet hard food twice daily and then canned catfood once every two days for a special treat). They went after the "gravy" first and, after licking that all up, they ate the solid food. All the cats ate all the food. These cats are all orphans (former strays) and some were really ferrel when we first took them in -- now they're all spoiled and calm. Most are pretty old (seven of them are over 10 years old). One cat is especially finicky about her food but she ate this product just fine.<br /><br />This catfood (like most catfood) is sort of nasty looking when you open a tin but that's because all the good chunks of chicken meat have settled to the bottom. The fairly clear gravy has some thickness, not watery. I was pretty enthused when I saw the tiny carrot pieces in the Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e. I was initially afraid that they would eat around the carrots but they didn't -- they gulped it right down with the rest of the ingredients.<br /><br />I'll give you the ingredients list here from the Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e: Chicken, chicken broth, sweet potato, carrots, soy bean oil, Tapioca starch, tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, calcium sulfate, Olive oil, vitamins and minerals (Vitamin E supplement, Vitamin A supplement, Vitamin D3 supplement), zinc sulfate, thiamine mononitrate, manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfate complex (source of Vitamin K activity), Riboflavin supplement, folic acid, Pryidoxine hydrochloride, copper amino acid complex, iron amino acid complex, Carrageenan, Choline Chloride, Taurine.<br /><br />Guarantee analysis: crude protein (min) 12%, crude fat (min) 1%, crude fiber (max) 1%, moisture (max) 85%, ash (max) 3%. This catfood contains no Wheat Gluten.<br /><br />The breakdown on both flavors runs about the same. Two of my cats are diabetic (they each get two insulin injections per day) which means, in the real world, that they throw up quite often. This food did not make them throw up.<br /><br />I can definitely recommend this catfood with these two caveats:<br /><br />-- it's pricey.<br />-- they still like one type of Friskies brand slightly better (they fight over it): Salmon Dinner.<br /><br />Given those two items, this catfood is a winner. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Cats love it!
review/text: I have one finicky cat and one food-hog cat. Both of them like this food. First ingredient is chicken, good. Next few ingredients are also good, but this is not "natural" cat food and thus, includes preservatives and taste enhancers (that I generally avoid). Also, the packaging is cute, but excessive. You get a case of 24 cans, but within that case, are 6 smaller boxes that hold 4 cans each. None-the-less, the quality is superior to "fancy feast" or other bottom-rung cat foods. This food is a solid "medium quality". The food is what I call "gravy" style as opposed to "loaf" style, meaning you are paying for a decent amount of gravy in each can as opposed to meat and other real food. To their credit though, the chicken is REAL white meat chicken, not processed chicken parts made to look like "shredded chicken". The cats love it and the packaging (though excessive) makes it convenient for storing little cans in your cupboard.

review/summary: Good Quality Cat Food for "People Food" Cats
review/text: We have two cats, both of whom can be finicky eaters. One cat is a "people food" lover; he will eat almost anything that we eat (turkey is his favorite).  The first time we introduced this food to him, he lapped it up.  The other cat does not touch "people food" at all.  He took one sniff of this food and turned on his heels.  We tried all flavors and he wouldn't eat any of them.<br /><br />So, if you have a cat who loves "people food", Petite Cuisine will probably satisfy him.  This cat food is of high quality with no "by-products" and comes in single serving pop-top cans.  Highly recommended for cats that are open to new flavors but may not be for those that prefer to stick with what they know.

review/summary: They should call it "Cat Crack"
review/text: Yes, they should call it "Cat Crack". We have 5 extremely finicky cats, and it's very difficult to get them to eat the same thing. When we find something, we stick with it. Whenever we've tried to introduce something new, chances are 1 or 2 of them will turn up their noses and walk away.<br /><br />This has not been an issue with Petite Cuisine. The problem now is that they truly won't stop sceaming for it. We've now gone through each of the four flavors (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, and Tuna & Shrimp), and each is an unqualified hit with all five cats.<br /><br />You can tell as soon as you open the can that this is something different. It certainly smells fishy, but it doesn't smell like regular canned cat food. It looks and smells very high quality and fresh. Real tuna flakes, real tiny popcorn shrimp, a good amount of sauce. These are smaller 3 oz cans. We pretty much limit each cat to a healthy tablespoon of wet food a day, so 1 can will feed three like that. But the cats could certainly find the motivation to eat more.<br /><br />Each box (and each can) is clearly labelled with all of the ingredients, which for the most part are whole seafood. Not too thrilled with the presence of Menadione sodium bisuifite in each, but on the whole, it's probably no more risky than other foods we've been feeding them. 1/2 star off for that.<br /><br />Value? Well it's a little pricey (3x per oz more expensive than, say, a good deal on a can of Friskies. But we'll continue to get it for the occasional break and special night treat for our babies. It's certainly been better received than almost anything else we've paid a premium for from any grocery store or pet store.

review/summary: Good product for a good price and my cat likes it.
review/text: Once my cat, Starlight, ate Petite Cuisine she was hooked. I was pleased to get the subscription price as it is significantly less than anyplace else and I never run out. When one order got lost in the mail, they overnighted a new shipment at no additional cost.

review/summary: The cats' dessert
review/text: We used to get this at a local grocery for our cat, who adores it. We moved cross country and now have to mail order it because the cat went on a hunger strike when his supply from before the move ran out. We acquired 2 more cats, and all 3 adore this stuff. Two of them especially like the "soupy" texture of it, sometimes we spoon it over their kibble and cats just snarf it up.<br /><br />This isn't the primary food for cats, it is their "dessert" - served twice daily after morning and evening kibble. However, they think the stuff is the best thing ever, and prefer it to anything you can name in the way of people food.

review/summary: My cats lapped this up!
review/text: I read a lot of reviews before ordering this variety of cat food so I knew the pros and cons, but since it had no by-products or wheat gluten, which are still my top "no-nos" I decided to give it a try.  My cats LOVE the extra gravy!  They love the chicken chunks too, of course but the gravy really got them going.  I've now tried several other varieties with gravies and they couldn't be more enthusiastic.  I switched them from all dry food to mostly wet and a little dry because the oldest cat was constantly throwing up...likely from her unable to effectively chew dry food well and swallowing it whole.  I will continue to order this for them as well as some of the other Petite Cuisine varieties.
