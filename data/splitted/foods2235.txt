review/summary: Perfect base for making your own Puttanesca!
review/text: I bought these 2 sealed bags last year during a sale, and I will do that again once I will have used up the huge supply I got with them. Unbelievable how much you get with these 2 sealed bags.<br /><br />Of course there is no way to re-seal them once you opened one, so make sure you have enough glass bottles or containers ready (washed, sterile) that are sealable. You have to pack the tomatoes/jalapenos/capers into those new (sealable) containers after opening and then store those cold (fridge). The other bag (that you get but don't open as you only open one when you work with it) can stay at room temperature until opened months later.<br /><br />I am a cook, I am really cooking every single day, and I estimate I will go for another year or longer with this one delivery I got 6 months ago. You only need a tiny portion (few spoon fulls of content) to make a good recipe.<br /><br />To make a good Puttanesca you will need crushed/pureed tomatoes as base ( I recommend Marzano from Cento, I get them localy for 3,50$ per bottle), onions, garlic, and these dried tomatoes/jalapenos/capers. I actually add more capers from a separate jar into mine, and I sometimes add also (vegetarian) Bacos to give some meat flavour. Then of course you will need good olives with it. I add some from my huge Roland tubs I also ordered last year when they had this big sale for bulk items.<br /><br />Recommended for any cook who really craves pure ingredients to cook with, NOT CONVENIENCE foods. Because you still have to work with these, and I would not eat them in any raw way. These are not meant for snacking out of the bag!

review/text: OMG, this is NOT orange BLOSSOM water. This is a watered down "distillate" (see label) of orange oil from the orange PEEL. This company clearly has no idea what orange blossoms remotely smell like or what orange BLOSSOM (hello!) water is. Made in IL, figures. If I had known it was watered down orange oil, I certainly would not have paid for it. Buyer beware.

review/text: Hey all-<br />This is probably the best espresso to come out of a Tassimo. That being said- NO T-Disk is worth more than 60 cents a pop, so this is overpriced. When you review an item and give it 1 star, you are rating the product as bad and it gives the wrong impression when you are simply upset about being ripped off. I agree with you though, this is currently outrageously overpriced considering I was getting three packs for something like 50 cents per serving.

review/summary: Good tea, usually a bit weak for me though
review/text: I have used Triple Leaf brand tea in the past and tried several variations.  Each time I end up using two bags, it may just be that I prefer a stronger tea, but even the bags seem a bit smaller than normal, maybe it's intentional and I am overdoing it.  This product in particular is a good mix, ginseng, ginko, decaf green tea.  I tried to find a product with this blend for awhile with no luck.  The tea tastes great with some honey, it has a bit of an earthy taste, as to be expected, but it is not overpowering and the honey easily smooths it out.  Ginseng and ginko have a long history and many reported benefits, I do know buy into all of it, but some of it must be true.  Clinical studies have shown ginko to help people who have occasional claudication, but had no effect on individuals with noraml operating memories.  Of course green tea is antioxidant rich, and the longest living people drink it daily.  These things seem to change everyday though, I remember when butter was bad for us...  Basicaly, a good product, priced right.  Get's one star off for the weakness of the brew, but as I said, maybe it should get full stars and it was intentional.

review/text: I made a careless mistake when ordering this coffee.  I really prefer the whole bean coffee, but ordered the ground version by mistake.  The only reason that I didn't give this ground coffee 5 stars is because, in my opinion, the whole bean version makes a fresher better-tasting cup.  This ground version still makes a very smooth, flavorful cup of coffee.  I just think grinding the whole bean is a bit more flavorful.

I pour in just enough for it to be a very light pink and it's amazing.

review/text: I started using this coffee when I purchased a French Press, as I needed coarse grind coffee. For the value, it was worth it until I purchased my coffee grinder. I recommend buying it one bag at a time, so it's always fresh. The flavor does deteriorate quickly, once the bag has been opened. I probably won't buy this coffee again now that I grind my own, but for what it is, it's worth it.

For everyday, this is much better than a lot of other options for the money. With Amazon Prime, you might as well order it one bag at a time so it's always fresh.

review/summary: Great coffee
review/text: Needless to say this is great coffee, and I'm a coffee snob.<br />Right now I have coffee (both roasted, and not roasted) from several countries, including 100% Kona, and 100% Jamaican Blue Mountain, I like this Tim Horton's blend the best.<br />Also, this is a great grind for the best way to brew coffee ever, percolated in an aluminum pot, (my favorite pot is a Wear-Ever from the 40's/50's).<br /><br />I have every method available for brewing coffee and I do mean that literally, and perked coffee in an aluminum pot makes the best tasting coffee ever.<br /><br />A close second is slow dripping by hand, and third is my Bunn spray/drip maker, all the other methods I have make the worst tasting coffee.  I use them occasionally, and simply wind up throwing out the coffee as I just can't drink it...the worst of the worst tasting coffee is from a vacuum pot, or for that matter any glass pot (for brewing) period!<br /><br />I also have a glass, and a stainless steel percolator but they have become dust collectors, coffee tastes horrible when brewed in either glass, or stainless steel.<br />BTW/ Don't always listen to online opinions concerning either perked coffee, or using an aluminum coffee pot, as people tend to be like sheep following one another, or behave like parrots and simply reiterate the majority opinion. Most people I've talked to that bad mouth perked coffee have never even tasted perked coffee, that's a fact, they simply parrot the majority, christian's tend to follow the others like lost sheep the most.<br /><br />The water does not boil when you percolate coffee, as when using a glass percolator you can see the water percolating way before it starts to boil, also as the water travels up, the water very slightly cools.  What you have to do as soon as it starts to percolate is to monitor the heat. I shut the heat off of my electric stove, if you have gas, just lower the heat, and let it perk for about 2 min. or so. I will admit that you have to monitor the process, but it is so, so worth it.<br /><br />I will say that I don't cook with aluminum, and there's a very scientific reason for brewing coffee in an aluminum pot, but this is not the place to get into it.<br /><br />Grinding the beans to the best coarseness for percolating can sometimes be a pain, (well not that big of a pain), but still I thought I would try this coffee out.<br />Perfect, perfect coffee, at a perfect grind using the best method for brewing coffee and I have a winner.

review/text: Horrible product! More HFCS than Pineapple - it's absolutely flavorless! The first tub I ordered had to have been sitting in the warehouse for ages, it arrived a congealed inedible mess. Amazon was kind enough to ship a replacement, which, while in better condition, leaked in transit and made the the entire tub and shipping box sticky. There is no expiration date on the package (always a very bad sign) the fruit inside is SO over processed with chemicals and additives that you honestly can't even tell it's pineapple if you don't know. It is sickeningly sweet (much much more than the ingredient list would let on) and the MSRP is a total joke.

review/summary: Baby Gourmet's Juicy Pear and Garden Greens pureed baby food is an excellent way to introduce veggies into a baby's diet ...
review/text: I've never really met a baby who didn't make faces or spit back out one sort of food or another.  Everyone's palate is a bit different and the slight tartness, veggie taste may not be to everyone's liking (it isn't to mine).  This is however, an excellent opportunity for parents and caretakers to introduce garden greens into a baby's diet.  I'm sure many grandparents will remember introducing pureed peas into baby's diet and getting a lot of it pushed back onto the spoon or bib.  Same thing.  The decision is whether or not you wish to give Baby Gourmet a try.<br /><br />The food comes in a thickened liquid form in pouches.  These pouches can easily be tossed in a diaper bag, backpack, or stroller.  The Juicy Pear & Garden Greens can either be served warm or cold, but the pouches are not microwavable.  The only drawback is that each pouch has a cap that could prove to be a choking hazard for toddlers.  Simply remember to either replace it or discard it when not in use.  The food can be put in a bowl or the handy "Squeeze Feed" can be used when on the go.  This food can also be used for the elderly who need additional nutrition, but have medical problems that make eating solid foods difficult.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />+  100%  Organic<br />+  No filler or thickeners<br />+  No added salt<br />+  Gluten Free<br />+  Nut Free<br />+  BPA Free packaging<br />+  No dairy, egg or lactose<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />*  Organic Pear<br />*  Organic Broccoli<br />*  Organic Spinach<br />*  Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)<br />*  Organic Lemon Juice Concentrate<br /><br />I do like the packaging and the concept of "disguising" the greens in a pear base.  This may or not work for all babies, but is worth a try.  It can further be disguised in oatmeal or other recipes.  Concerns about a short shelf life are somewhat invalid as it is assumed that you'll be using the product fairly quickly and not stockpile.  There are no preservatives so a quick expiration date is a given.  Not all babies will "love" to eat this product, but it's worth a try.

review/text: My baby has had rice cereal for couple of weeks. then before starting her on this pear and garden greens, I let her have sweet potatoes so that her first memories of food are nice instead of ultra healthy greens. But she devoured this too. It is a good choice to be able to introduce greens so early. Just before feeding, I could smell ripe pear and sweet.

review/summary: Exceptional quality for your baby
review/text: Baby gourmet Organic Simple Stage 1 is a quality puree with no sugar and has BPA free packaging (very important for infants).  The all natural, organic product has no added salt or fillers and is gluten free.  The puree is decent tasting, and my 6 year old even willingly eats it!  The organic contents are pear, broccoli, spinach, ascorbic acid (great for digestion and your liver) and lemon juice concentrate.  These are high quality fruits and veggies anyone (never mind baby) should be eating.  I highly recommend this very healthy, organic product.

review/text: This has already been mentioned, but I did order mine for the woman in the apartment next to me who has severe eating problems.  Well, I did share some with her though I don't have those difficulties yet myself.  As mentioned in so many reviews, this is delicious food and being healthful is obvious.  However, it should be used immediately since there seems to be a short expiration date.  Another thing is the expense...this is priced a bit above what many seniors can afford.

review/summary: Caregivers Alert -- This Product is Good for Elders as Well as Babies
review/text: Wow!  I wish I'd known about this baby food when I was caring for my mom after her second stroke.  She had trouble swallowing, but was very tired of the food offered to elderly patients with swallowing difficulties.  This is not only a great change from pulverized string beans and mashed potatoes, but it's a delicious change of pace.  Here's my take on "Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees:"<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1.  Taste - as mentioned, this tastes good.<br /><br />2.  Packaging -- a soft plastic pack means no more breakable jars to complicate life for the new parent or the caregiver for an elderly relative.  This is a huge advantage when you're trying to manage care of an elderly with a palate that's tired of hospital purees.<br /><br />3.  Additional uses -- while I often avoid reading the reviews from others, I did read the review from the author who used this pureed pear in Korean barbeque sauce.  Great idea! And great taste for the barbeque sauce -- YUM!<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />None.  I'm going to purchase other fruits and vegetables to store for quick cooking ingredients.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br /><br />A healthy, tasty product with multiple uses.  Try it! You may like it, too.<br /><br />Five Stars!

review/summary: Organic Convenience
review/text: My six month old nephew happily ate this, each time it was offered, and although he can't tell us exactly how good it was, we could tell.<br /><br />We eat organic as much as possible so it's nice to offer babies organic food that's good for them.  This is a combination of pear, spinach and brocolli. I tasted it myself and would have no problem eating this.  It tastes like pureed pears and brocolli.  It isn't too sweet and is flavorful.<br /><br />Babies typically don't like any greens but this mixture containing the pear for a bit of natural sweetness is a good tasting mixture.<br /><br />There is nothing artifical in this.  You can know you are feeding healthy organic food to  your baby.<br /><br />It is also a "convenience" food, since you can feed it right out of the package, simply by squeezing it through the feeding tube and into a spoon, or into the baby's mouth if you are out somewhere.  The packages keep the food fresh, and they are spillproof in a bag along with your other baby items.<br /><br />I can highly recommend this.

review/summary: Convenient & Healthy
review/text: For an adult, this has a semi-sweet taste likely due to the pears.  The taste of the broccoli or spinach masked by the semi-sweet taste thankfully.  The product tastes and feels somewhat like a light version of apple sauce.  The taste is somewhere in the ballpark of Naked juice's Green Machine.  This product manages to put about every insensitivity/alergy buzz word on the package -- gluten free, nut free, BPA free, etc.  The product has very clear serving instructions and is easy to open.  The cap is a choking hazard which is unfortunate but I don't know of a better solution where you can still have a nice feeding tube present.  I'd rather give up the plastic cap and feeding tube for the environment and use maybe a tear-open package.<br /><br />Feeding this product to a 6+ month old child, the reaction was neutral compared to his other favorite meals.  This was based on his body language and facial reaction -- the best I can do.  :)<br /><br />Note that the item I received in July 2012 also had an expiration date of July 2012.  I'm not sure if these packets normally have such a short shelf life or not.  Perhaps since they don't have so many preservatives in them you have to use the product quickly?

review/summary: Our grandson loves it
review/text: Our grandson, 11 months old, has been consuming this product with great gusto. He will eat a full pouch at a sitting, without fuss or bother, and want more.<br /><br />The product has what I think is a really key advantage: it's not seasoned to adult tastes. This means it is neither salty nor sweet, and that has got to be better for baby.<br /><br />It's also very convenient. It's great "travel food" and the cap closes tightly, should it happen that baby doesn't eat it all (though that hasn't happened as yet). You might argue that there is a bit too much packaging, but the convenience factor is quite high, and I think the tradeoff is worth it.<br /><br />This is an excellent product all-around and baby definitely recommends it.

review/text: My daughter-in-law is making most of my grandson's foods from scratch but, as a working mom, sometimes convenience is a lifesaver.<br /><br />When looking for convenience food, we choose organic foods with no unnecessary fillers or sweeteners.  However, greens can be a bit stout for a six month old so we'll break him easy with a little added pear.<br /><br />He seemed to enjoy this flavor baby food. Kept opening his mouth for more. This was a great way to introduce the baby to greens in a puree form mixed in with a sweet fruit but I notice this brand is a little pricey.  Once he starts liking a little texture in his food I would rather make this combo myself.

review/summary: Twin Boys Seemed to Like It
review/text: 9 month old twin boys ate the baby food with no problem.  It had bits of greens in it, and comes in a straw pouch.  The directions said to pour it into a bowl, but I wanted to see how they'd handle the straw.  They promptly squeezed and decorated themselves, so I took the pouches away and put the food in a bowl.  I supplemented with some finger foods, because the twins are all about feeding themselves right now, but it's right in line with what they've been eating lately.<br /><br />I did think the straw aspect would be pretty handy - but the directions also remind parents that the top is a choking hazard for younger kids - so it might be more trouble than it's worth.

review/summary: a healthy hit with babies, but not toddlers
review/text: First off, the ingredient list of this baby food (Organic pear, organic broccoli, organic spinach, ascorbic acid, organic lemon juice concentrate) earns no complaints from me. Obviously, use your discretion about when to introduce these foods, and how they fit into your baby's complete diet. I personally wait until at least 8 months to introduce broccoli and spinach, since they can be a bit harder to digest than some others. But certainly a blend of organic fruit and veggies has a good place in a baby's menu.<br /><br />The packaging is also nice in my opinion: it's portable, convenient, resealable and BPA free. I make most of my own baby food, but this would be highly convenient if I'm on the go. A parent could even squeeze directly into a spoon for feeding if you didn't want to tote and clean a bowl. If leftover portions haven't been in contact with a dirty spoon, you can reseal and refrigerate for a day or so.<br /><br />My only other criteria for evaluation is taste preference. Obviously this is going to vary from child to child, but I offered this to several young guests in our home and the consensus seemed to be that babies liked it, but toddlers didn't. I realize this is baby food, so that makes sense, but I'd hoped my toddler would also enjoy it. Squeeze pouches of blended fruit are usually popular with that age, a convenient snack, and this particular blend would have been wonderful for relieving occasional "regularity issues." Alas, several toddlers turned this down, even though mine does like all these ingredients separately. It was a hit with a 12-month-old guest,  however.<br /><br />All in all, this seems to be a solid choice if you're looking for a fruit/veggie baby food in a convenient, packable container. It does make sense to buy a smaller amount first if you can to be certain that your child likes these flavors together.

review/text: I don't even want to admit how many of these types of pouches my 2yr old goes through in a week, she has some issues with food textures and I have a really hard time getting her to eat the veggies I cook for the rest of the family (she does happily eat most fruits though), so in an effort to make sure she was getting enough veggies I turned to this type of pouch and found out she LOVES them. They are especially great for traveling in the car or packing for snacks while at the park, instead of a junky granola bar or sticky fruit snacks she'll happily suck down an all natural pouch.<br /><br />That said she wasn't a huge fan of this flavor, I tried it and thought it was on par with the other brands she likes but she always skips over these when picking out her flavors from the big box I keep them all in.<br /><br />Definitely worth a try to see if your little one likes them, and don't give up just because they might not like one flavor. I usually try to buy in grocery stores so she can try one before committing to a case!

review/summary: Tastes Very Good
review/text: I used to make my baby food from scratch using freshly cooked veggies and fruits using as little salt as possible.  I was frequently disappointed in the flavor of the pre-made baby foods I bought from the grocery store and tried.  I made all sorts of different items for my kids from black-bean/eggplant combo to sweet potato and plums combo and everything in between.  I added real butter too just because it made the food taste so good and the babies loved it!<br /><br />This product is not as good as what I made, however, it comes pretty close.  I only have the green bean/pear flavor to review, but I am impressed with it's flavor and texture.  It's a little thinner than what I made, but it's not watery at all.  I have tasted this product myself and can taste the green beans and the pears.  The pear flavor is stronger but not overwhelming.  The color is light to medium brown with a hint of green.  And the slight, gritty texture of pear is apparent, but should be easily tolerated by a baby.<br /><br />As a mom, I would be willing to incorporate this into my baby's diet as needed, but I'd still go the homemade baby-food route for the long-haul.  I think that the packaging is good in that I feel less air gets into the package when stored in the refrigerator after opening.  I remember the baby food jars having discolored food from oxidation in the jars after opening.  This product must be kept cold after opening or it will spoil just like any other food.  It tastes good, I think the green-bean/pear combo is a healthy one and you don't have to worry about the jar breaking if you drop it since it's in a nice squeezable package.

review/summary: Apparently a yummy choice.
review/text: Feeding my great nephew while babysitting is a joy. I adore him.<br />But getting him to eat green vegies has been a challenge. When I<br />had the chance to try this, I jumped at it for my sake as much as for his!<br />First time out, Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Puree got his seal of approval.<br />I wish I could have posted the picture I have of his enthusiastic endorsement<br />of the product.<br /><br />Of course I had to taste it myself, and I have to say that I agree. This is a<br />tasty choice for your little one, and if Owen could talk ( or type )  I am pretty sure that<br />he would add his recommendation to mine.<br /><br />One last thing, the packaging is brilliant, space saving and simple. Very<br />easy to toss into a travel or diaper bag. Well done Baby Gourmet!<br /><br />ETA<br /><br />I put this food into a bowl and feed him with a spoon.

review/summary: A Healthy and Convenient choice!!
review/text: The Baby Gourmet Organic simple purees offers parents an easy way to travel with healthy organic baby food that your baby will love. This organic puree is a convenient and healthy way to feed your baby and the taste is extremely tasty. There are no chemicals or preservatives which is great but that also means that the baby food expires in about 6 months, so you can't store it for long periods of time. The nozzle is perfect if you make a thick bottle as I do for my little niece and add some of the baby puree into a bottle with some of the milk to create a hardy meal for your baby. My niece loves this so much she gobbled it up so quickly that I had to taste it myself to see what this was all about and I loved the taste and the texture.<br /><br />This package is amazing and allows you to take this with you anywhere without worrying about if the food will break inside of your baby bag. I love this product and I'm happy that this is extremely healthy as well as tasty.

review/summary: Great packaging, but two kids said "Blech!"
review/text: This is a great idea and the packaging could not be better.  These are actually quite large.  Stage 1 is 6 months plus, but the seven month old who tried this for me couldnt hold it on his own.  The top has a safety ring, and then unscrews.  It can be rescrewed back on.  I'd be careful with the top since it seems like it might be a choking hazard if left on a highchair tray.<br /><br />I tried it and I thought it tasted terrible, but I generally dont like these overly sweet baby foods.  However, two other kids - one seven months old and a four year old both also gave the taste a thumbs down.  Both would only take one mouthful before refusing to eat any more.

review/summary: Handy Way to Feed Baby On-The -Go
review/text: This is a really handy way to be able to feed a baby on the go.<br /><br />These 4.5 oz pouches do not need refrigeration until opened making it a great thing to toss in the diaper bag. This means the food is room temperature which usually suits a baby over cold from the fridge baby food.<br /><br />The screw top lid allows you to feed your baby and if not completely eaten, the lid screws back on and can then be refrigerated and then used for up to 24 hours.<br /><br />The squeezable pouch with a mouth sized tube opening means no spoons needed and no dirty spoon to clean up. Again very handy for travel. And babies have the sucking reflex so kind of drinking the fruit and vegetable food from a tube rather than using a spoon makes the transition from milk only to pureed food a lot easier.<br /><br />My six month old grandson ate half his pouch and then we put it in the fridge for his next feeding. The next feeding we squeezed the pear and garden greens baby food into a bowl since we were home and just used a spoon.<br /><br />This baby food is organic, so only the best ingredients are used.

review/text: I have been seaching for a vegatable that would not cause a struggle for my lil man to eat and have been failing misably for all involved. Problem is now solved!! He loves the flavor, and I love that he is eating broccoli, spinach and a ton of other healthy greens! I am not sure if it is beacause of the pear juice mixed in but this has now become a favorite in our house and we both are happy that he can get his snack whenever demanded. The only downfall I see is with the design of the nozzle. The cornered/angled spout was a little troublesome for negotating his hands and he needed help eating after the pouch was halfway emptied. None the less this is not a deal breaker in the least for this very appreciatative mom!

review/summary: Prices but convienent
review/text: This is a new type of baby food that is becoming very popular. Our youngest turned 6 months old when we tried this. She loved it. Although I am not sure I would trust her yet as a food critic. Although when my wife and I tasted it, we also thought it was pretty good.<br /><br />This is an organic baby food. Organic is one of those buzz words that is all the rage right now. And while that is good, they are not inexpensive to purchase. Currently they cost about $28 for 12. That is about $2 each. When considering if this is the ideal food for your baby, price should definitely be factored in. And I am not sure if this is worth the price. Typically we make our own baby food (mashed bananas, sweet potatoes, carrots, etc)<br /><br />I will say that the greatest use we found for these was to take them when we went out and mashing up food was not an option. The resealable lid is also handy. But even at the price, I still wonder if it is worth it.<br /><br />So why 4 stars then? Well, obviously if you purchase it, you are aware of the price. If you still purchase them, you won't be disappointed in them based on taste, use or connivence.

review/summary: Healthy food for a healthy baby!
review/text: I really was impressed with this product.  If you are an adult and you try it before giving it to your baby you have to remember that they have not been used to the salt (sodium) and sugar flavors we are used to so just because you may think this is bland, your baby will  probably still like it just fine.  I did think it was an odd combination of flavors and for an adult I would say the veggies and fruit should be seperated but  I appreciate the fact that it has two of the healthiest vegetables you can eat, spinach and broccoli and the great fruit flavor of pear and a bit of lemon.  That is it! It  is all organic.  I like the packaging and the resealable top as well as the fact that you can heat it or serve it cold.  I think it is a great product and it seems like a very good way to keep your baby growing strong!

review/summary: an asset for the family on the go.
review/text: My family has a lot of time spent traveling and I have found that the Baby Gourmet Organic Purees are a fantastic treat to toss into the diaper bag so the kids can have a healthy treat without the mess. My toddler (15 months) could eat this with ease only making a mess when he squeezed a full package, after he learned that was not the point we had no further issues. My 3 year old also enjoyed this even though he is over the suggested age, it was a convenient snack that is also healthy, checking out the nutrition facts I was satisfied with the ingredients and nutrition. The only thing that I did not care for is the flimsy box that the pouches come in, they just aren't meant to sit well on a shelf, they are thin and not as compact as I would have hoped.

review/summary: Organic baby food pouches with all the good stuff and nothing that isn't...
review/text: If you are a fan of the baby food pouches on the market today, you are going to love these.  The Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees contain organic fruits and veggies.  Like many pouches on the market, they have a great design and are the perfect solution for your active baby.  They are easy to transport...no need for a dish and spoon and your baby can find him or herself.  This pouch is bpa free so you gotta love that.  These pouches contain less sugar than many pouches on the market today so for moms watching the sugar intake of their little ones, this is a step up on other pouches.<br /><br />Each Juicy Pear and Garden Greens pouch contains:<br />80 calories for 4.5 ounces<br />0 fat or trans fat<br />0 sodium<br />18g of carbs<br />4g of dietary fiber<br />less than 2g of sugar<br />0g protein<br /><br />4% DV Protein<br />50% Vitamin A<br />140% Vitamin C<br />0% Calcium<br />4% Iron<br /><br />The absolute only complaint I can think of with this product is the price.  Even on amazon, they are a little over $2 a pouch, but the quality of the ingredients explains the cost over other brands.  Choosing organic for your little ones insure that they are getting the best products for their developing minds and bodies.

review/summary: I don't like it, but my daughter does
review/text: My daughter is seven years old, but because of her cerebral palsy has difficulty eating any food that hasn't been pur&eacute;ed.  However, her taste buds are more mature than a baby's, so when I saw this food advertised as sounding like something adults would want for dinner, it seemed right up our alley.  Well, I didn't really like it myself.  Despite liking both ingredients separately, the combination was just a bit weird for me.  However, my daughter likes it, and that's what's important.  I'd like to try some of the other flavors.<br /><br />The pouch it comes in is something I haven't seen before, so I'll comment on that as well.  It was much easier to open than a baby food jar, especially when your hands are a little wet.  It's easy to get all the food out, and it doesn't feel as wasteful when you throw it out as does a glass jar.  Well worth needing to provide your own bowl.

review/summary: Good healthy meal, pleasant taste, convenient no-mess packaging
review/text: I like that this Baby Gourmet Juicy Pear and Garden Greens Baby Food has no added salt or sugar, and is gluten free.  I consumed one of the 12 pouches I received to get a feel for what it might taste like.  I thought the overall taste was pleasant, with the pear and lemon juice making a more palpable contribution to the overall taste than the broccoli and spinach.  My baby boy likes it.<br /><br />Each pouch has a cap that is easy to unscrew.  Once you've unscrewed the cap, just squeeze the pouch a few times until you get the desired amount of contents into a bowl.  To reseal the packet, just screw the cap back on.  A simple and no-mess delivery system!<br /><br />The product is a bit pricey compared to what's available in the local supermarket, but it's a good product, in my opinion.

review/text: My boy is almost 3.5 years old so probably he's not the target audience for this product, but that doesn't stop him from loving these.  The ingredients are high quality and there is good solid nutrition here.<br /><br />It is fun for my boy to eat these himself, squeezing the pouch into his mouth, but I agree that the pouch design is not a huge selling point for me.  I think it's a little bit of a myth that these are so much more convenient than jars/tubs.  Back when my kid was still eating a lot of baby food, I never felt inconvenienced having to carry along jars/tubs if we were going to be eating on-the-go.  Plus this packaging has the flaw of being not recyclable whereas we always recycled the jars/tubs.<br /><br />All in all, I would have to say that I would probably not buy these again because the price is outrageous.  Other brands of similarly high quality are substantially less expensive, like a whole dollar per pouch less expensive.

review/text: When I got this Juicy Pear and Garden Greens baby food for my daughter I wasn't sure if she would go for a pear/spinach/broccoli.  The puree is mostly pears with flecks of spinach and broccoli in it.  I'm not a fan of the smell of this food, but my daughter can't get enough of it.  She really likes it and gets quite upset if I don't feed it to her quickly enough.  I was ver concerned that it wasn't going to be palatable, but her eagerness to eat this makes me think it must be pretty tasty.<br /><br />The pouch is convenient if you are only going to serve a portion of this to your baby.  Simply squeeze out what you're going to use and then cap it and pop it in the fridge.

review/summary: Very good taste!
review/text: For our child, we typically produce our own baby food.  I'm not a big fan of all the "extras" baby food companies stick in their foods, so I use a baby food processor to make whatever pure foods I want to give my baby.<br /><br />However, I saw the opportunity to give these organic purees a shot and decided to give it a shot because the flavours just sounded amazing: For the Juicy Pear and Garden Greens, it was quite good and the baby (and, admittedly, I) enjoyed it quite a bit.  Since it doesn't have all the flavour add-ins that other baby foods have (especially the sugars), it's not going to have the junk food flavouring.  Therefore, it will ACTUALLY taste like the foods the label says.  This one is a bit on the sour side, but that's because I'm not a huge fan of pear.  My baby liked it quite a bit and didn't fight in the slightest.<br /><br />I also like the pouch design (instead of the jars with those hard to reach corners).  You can just pour a bit into your baby's favourite bowl and let him or her enjoy!<br /><br />Overall, it's a good product that most babies should enjoy.  There are other flavours that you can also give a shot!

review/summary: Yummy snack and oatmeal topping! Kids like it too
review/text: These packets are easy to store and squeeze, and the caps make them easy to reseal.  The pear-spinach puree makes a great, low-calorie, no-added-sugar topping for plain oatmeal.  And my kids like it as a snack!  It's convenient and better for them than fruit roll-ups.

review/summary: Awesome but pricey.
review/text: These are really great to have on hand to just grab and take with you if you are on the go.  My 1 year old loves these.  He has also just learned how to drink from a straw and just hold this in his mouth and sucks most of it out(you have to help with the last little bit).  The taste isnt too bad(Had to try it out for myself).  You get a mix of fruit and vegetable in one serving which is really great.  My only problem is that they seem to be a little pricey for the size but they are convenient.

review/summary: Yummy Feel Good Food For Your Baby or Toddler
review/text: I absolutely love baby food pouches.  I try to keep one or two in my purse or car at all times for our toddler, who tends to get cranky VERY fast when he decides he's hungry.  The Baby Gourmet Juicy Pear and Garden Greens Pouch is great for all purposes, and as a parent, I can feel good giving it to my toddler (who scarfs these down and asks for more... which is all the proof I need that they are good).<br /><br />Now, I wasn't sure about my son's taste in food, so I decided to give a pouch a try myself while we were waiting for some friends.  It was actually quite good.  It has the perfect amount of pear to make the spinach and broccoli a little sweeter, and the only other ingredients are asorbic acid and organic lemon juice concentrate, so I know these pouches are nutritious.<br /><br />Pluses:<br />100% Organic<br />Unsweetened (well, that is what the package says, but it IS naturally sweetened by the pear)<br />Unsalted<br />Gluten Free<br />Nut Free<br />BPA Free Packaging<br />No dairy, egg or lactose<br />Tastes good<br /><br />This comes in two 6-pack boxes, and is suggested for children ages 6 months+.  My 2 year old loves these as a snack or supplement to his meal (especially if we eat out), and I will on occasion eat one for a snack myself.

review/text: I watch a 2 year old, and this is her favorite snack! I admit, I was skeptic.  It honestly doesn't SOUND appealing, but they taste surprisingly good!  I have had it as a snack a time or two, as has my 6 year old.  I cannot wait to try other varieties!

review/text: Got these for when my niece visits and really happy with it.  No additives, no BPA, no waste; great taste, good ingredients, portable.  I'd definitely buy this using subscribe & save since it brings the price down 15%.  Honestly, I think this makes a great addition to baby's food pantry for travel, days when you're too busy to prep a lot of food, or when the baby is sleeping over grandma's (or auntie's) house. A++++

review/summary: Next best thing to homemade
review/text: With my first child I made all of my baby food from scratch.  I was a stay at home Mom and had the luxury to do this, but I know that it's not always possible for parents. I think that if you can't make it yourself, then a product like this is the next best thing. I liked several things about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051COPH6">Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees</a>; the simplicity and minimal processing of the ingredients, the packaging and the flavor combinations. Of course the true test is what baby thinks and not wanting to feed a child some thing I wouldn't be willing to eat myself I sampled it first.  The texture was right for the age, not to thick or runny. The flavor was pretty good too, I liked the addition of pear to add a little sweetness. As for the kids, three visitors to my home have now tried this and 2 out of 3 liked it.  The baby was 7 months and gobbled it down, there was a 12 month old that after a few tastes turned his nose up at it and surprisingly the 3 year old took the pouch and sucked it down.  Her Mom said she gives her <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030VBQ5Y">HAPPYTOT Organic Superfoods for Tots</a>, so she was very familiar with the packaging. The only thing left to consider is the price.  While it is more expensive than some of the longstanding jarred brands out there, I think that it is worth the extra cost for your child.

review/summary: Perfect first foods that babies like
review/text: These purees are great first foods for babies. They are easy to swallow and easy to digest, and it's gluten free, contains no dairy, no eggs, no nuts, no fillers, sweeteners or salt.  It was even enjoyed by one fussy baby who is particular about what it likes to eat.<br /><br />The packaging is perfect for travel; it's easy to open and dispense. The food is both tasty and nutritious. No refrigeration required unless opened. We think it's the perfect food to take along for babies when traveling or visiting. TRY IT.

review/summary: Peary Good
review/text: Baby Gourmet's Juicy Pear & Garden Greens comes in a BPA free "spout pouch" package that is becoming more and more common on grocery store shelves. I like the convenient, easy-to-store nature of these pouches and their other benefits. The pouches themselves are not recyclable, but they supposedly have a far smaller environmental impact than glass jar alternatives. The cap and nozzle are recyclable plastic, so I recommend just ripping them off the empty pouch and dropping them into your recycling bin.<br /><br />Getting back the most important thing -- the food. I suggest you visit Baby Gourmet's website to see the philosophy behind their product. It is organic, has no fillers, and is unsweetened. Taste is as important and nutritional value. A pouch contains two servings and in the case of this one, that's 40 calories a serving along with the other healthy nutrients.<br /><br />My wife and I don't have a 6 months+ infant, but a neighbor's baby is a little less than a year old and she seemed to like it well enough. In fact, it was hard to pry the empty pouch from her pudgy little fingers. My two kids (7 & 11) tasted and and wrinkled up their noses. No pouches in their school lunches I guess. To be fair, they are far from the target market.<br /><br />My wife and I tasted it and found it to actually be pretty tasty. To us, chilled pouches taste better than room temperature or warmed ones. I would describe it as having an apple sauce like consistency with the predominant fresh flavor of pear pur&eacute;e and a dash of greens (broccoli and spinach) making a subtle appearance. I wouldn't serve this to company at a dinner party (unless they were all toddlers), but I don't mind throwing a pouch in my lunch bag and having it as a snack for work. I don't even mind the odd looks I get from my coworkers, hah!<br /><br />If you are looking for a healthy food for your little one(s), you could do a lot worse than Juicy Pear & Garden Greens. In a pinch, it'll even do as a snack for open minded adults. My thanks to Baby Gourmet for producing this healthy and environmentally friendly product.<br /><br />~ Kort

review/summary: Very convenient, and tasty, too
review/text: These purees are great, and the pouch thing is exceptionally convenient! This flavor, juicy pear and garden greens, tastes like a lovely pear puree to me - no hint of the greens. For a child who dislikes veggies, I believe this would be a nice way to sneak some in.<br /><br />The pouch is a thick foil and it features a plastic tube with a re-closeable, plastic top. My almost 2 year old granddaughter had no problem using the pouch and she LOVED the flavor. In fact, she finished it and asked for another one. When I pulled it out of the carton, her eyes got wide, her smile got wider, and she said "All for ME"?<br /><br />We were at the park that day and the pouch was such a great way to give her a yummy snack without needing utensils or having any clean-up. Also, the pouch is perfect for a toddler on the go, who is loathe to slow down for a minute to eat something. My daughter-in-law was very enthusiastic about keeping some on hand for car trips and other times when a snack is in order.<br /><br />I intend to purchase other varieties as well, but this flavor will be one I regularly keep on hand for my granddaughter's visits.

review/summary: Healthy and convenient
review/text: I am very impressed that there isn't any type of sweetener or salt in this Baby Gourmet Organic baby food.  It is surprisingly difficult to find baby food without salt and some type of sugar.  The ingredients in this formula are:  Organic pear, organic broccoli, organic spinach, ascorbic acid, organic lemon juice concentrate.<br /><br />The packaging lists it as 2 servings, but I think most babies can/will eat the entire package.  This is not always the case, though, so the twist on/off lid makes it very convenient for storing in the refrigerator.  The one thing I don't like is that it's difficult to see/feel if you've really gotten all of the food out of the pouch.  The food is quite expensive, and I don't like the thought of not being able to get every little drop out of the packaging.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great food -- tastes great, has wonderful ingredients, doesn't have unnecessary additives, and is very convenient.

review/text: My husband and I sometimes take care of my baby niece and so I ordered this to try. All I can say is that she loved them. She ate all her food and she is sometimes a very picky eater.<br /><br />The only gripe I have is that sometimes the containers I find to be a pain, it's easier just to open up a jar and take what you use out. Though the disposal of these containers is much easier than the jars.<br /><br />Overall, I'd highly recommend.

review/text: These are great...very healthy and kids love them. It is so much more convenient to feed them like this and not have to carry around little jars or tubs and spoons. They are natural and have only good things in them. Good for a baby or even a slightly older kid to get their vegetables.

There is a mix of Pear, Broccoli, and Spinach. And of course it is certified Organic. A bit pricey but high quality and convenient for your baby.

review/summary: Baby loves it and his tummy takes it well!
review/text: My infant loves it!  Juicy Pear and Garden Greens is at first an off putting combo but it actually tastes nice. (Yeah, I tasted it. I taste everything I give to my infant to be sure it isn't poisoned.  Haha, not really.  But it's good to have an idea of what, exactly you are giving to your child, I think)<br /><br />The packaging is very convenient. A pouch with a screw top for easy access and reseal to keep the contents fresh.<br />Great taste, great packaging- you've got a winner!<br /><br />*** UPDATE ***<br />Baby (almost 6 months old) has been eating this Juicy Pear and Garden Greens for over a week now.  No problem digesting it and still able to poo regularly (color will be kind of green instead of yellow though but no worries!)  If you're going to start your baby on solid, I highly recommend this product as a start (perhaps on top of iron fortified rice cereal).  I was told to start with veggies, then fruits but why not do both at the same time with this Juicy pear and greens purees! :)  He eats 2 - 2.5 oz of Baby Gourmet in the morning then rice with milk in the evening.<br /><br />I'm so very happy with this product and highly recommend it.  GROW baby GROW!

review/summary: My 1 Year Old Likes It!
review/text: To me, these taste like turnip greens and pears mixed together. I know the name of this flavor involves garden greens, but I thought the "greens" would be pretty tasteless, for some odd reason. You can very much taste them! I didn't care for this flavor at all. My 3 year old looked at me like I was the worst mother ever for daring to let him taste it. My 1 year old LOVES them, though! He's the closest to the target age, so I guess he would be the best judge in this case. Little ones don't exactly have the same taste "likes" as the older generation. (Have you ever tasted formula?!)<br /><br />I will say that the turnip green flavor wasn't as strong to me after these have been refrigerated, even if my husband disagrees.<br /><br />I know that there's the whole argument against these pouches because they aren't recyclable. I DO wish that they could be recycled, but otherwise, I LOVE these pouches! They are just so handy, especially with traveling.<br /><br />Overall, my youngest gives these a big thumbs up. If you're buying them for an older child, I'd probably try one before buying a whole case!

review/text: They really made this baby food easy to use, can be cold, room temp or warmed in a bowl of hot tap water, travels well and no glass to break or throw away, although that big green screw cap needs some work, its a lot of plastic. Little kids can squeeze straight into their mouths with a little practice, but very messy for one with no control. Tastes like well, pears.
