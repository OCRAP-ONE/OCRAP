review/summary: They taste like my mom made them!
review/text: I don't get to eat many cookies but when I do I want them to taste great.  You just cannot beat cookies fresh out of the oven for the great taste and the aroma. This mix is nice as you quickly add butter, an egg and bake.  In less than 20 minutes you have a nice sweet treat to share with family and friends.<br /><br />My grandson loves to come over and bake some cookies for dessert for dinner.  Unfortunately many times they don't last long enough to make it to dinner time.  Their life span is pretty short.  There is just something about eating them while they are still warm that is just irresistible.<br /><br />Betty Crocker is a good name brand and one you can trust for the highest quality.  You should buy some and treat the kids and yourself to something special!

review/text: I used to buy Kashi cereal, until I learned that many of their products are loaded with GMOs. Not good! And after investigating, I learn that Kashi and Bear Naked cereals, which I also used to purchase, are made by Kellogs!!! So I searched for better cereals and found Nature's Path, Country Choice and EnviroKidz. We love their cereals and other products and feel good knowing that they are certified with the green, not black (which is quite questionable) USDA label.

review/summary: Very Minimum Ingredients list. Tastes great.
review/text: My daughter really likes this cereal, especially with a banana sliced in it. While it's still sugary sweet, the ingredients list is way more forgiving and healthy than larger brands. Being that the first ingredient is corn, it's good to know this company can be trusted non-gmo organic, unlike many so called 'natural' brands.<br />This order was a complete disapointment, so I thought I would post my seller rating here as well. Aside from the over packaging, they had sent us bags with a best by date less than a month from the time recieved. I'm not sure if Amazon is consistant with allowing these short expiration/bestbuy dates by it's suppliers, but this is unfortunate.

review/text: This is a great cereal!  It is my 16 year old son's favorite gluten free cereal (and mine).  My husband likes it, too.  It has a good flavor (not heavy on the peanut butter flavor, but my daughter who doesn't like peanut butter doesn't like it).  It stays crispy in milk for a long time!  It's also tasty just to eat plain as a snack without milk.  I've made cookies with it in a recipe that I originally made with rice crispies, and it worked well for this purpose as well.  This cereal is so good I would eat this even if we weren't eating gluten free!  Amazon's price is the best I've found for this.

It is super crunchy and the peanut butter flavor is yummy. My 3 year old loves it and after all that is who I am trying to please! It is cheaper at my local grocery store for the 10.6 oz boxes, but Amazon has the 25 oz bags (3 packs) available, which gets me the most cereal for the least cost. Enjoy!!

review/summary: Great tasting cereal!
review/text: I purchased this cereal because I wanted to get something more natural for my children.  I'm tired of cereal box ingredients being unrecognizable garbage.  My children love the taste and have gotten tired of just plain cheerios being the only thing I will get for them from the grocery store.  I like that I can set this up to be delivered regularly and forget about it.  There also is minimal packaging that (not certain on this one) I believe is biodegradable.  I gave it only 4 stars because while it does taste very good there still is more sugar than I would like to see in it but I guess that is why the kids love it so much.  For taste only I suppose my kids would give it five stars.  My 15 year old daughter calls it "amazing" :o)

In recent years, I have been a huge fan of the Trident White (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KOUYGQ">Trident White Sugarless Gum, Peppermint, 12-Piece Packages (Pack of 12)</a>), exceptional for its flavor and long-term chewability.<br /><br />But recently I have made the switch to this Dentyne pure and I am in love!  Amazing flavor that lasts a long time, but above all else, incredible long-term chewability without getting tough or rubbery.  This is a superlative product and highly recommended!

review/summary: Refreshingly simple
review/text: In an age where gum comes in nearly every flavor imaginable, it's good to see a revival of the classic mint. Dentyne's new gum, Pure, is simple. It's a rectangular piece of gum with a hard outer shell and surprising burst of mint extract in the center (think "mint in mint"). It really freshens your breath! I was actually very surprised when I first bit into it, thinking it was just another piece of gum. Dentyne really did a good job in implementing the flavored center idea and using mint instead of some funky new flavor that lasts for only 5-10 minutes. In my opinion, the flavor actually lasts longer (up to half an hour to an hour) if you bite into it right away, allowing the center's mint extract to envelop your mouth. Give it a try! Purchase a single-pack at a drug store near you if you're apprehensive about shelling out $17 for something you're not sure about.

review/text: This is the best gum out there. It's flavor last for hours, it really does freshen your breth and unlike most other gums this doesn't give you cotton mouth after the flavor is gone. You can keep chewing it  and chewing it. Although if you keep chewing it for too long it will disintegrate and small pieces will get caught in you teeth. But who really chewes gum for 4 hours. It has a firm outer shell and a soft inner body. Very cool the bite into. You gotta try it. Green or blue, those are my favorites.

review/text: I hate to be so direct and sort of jerk-ish, but mint flavored gum is honestly the best way to take care of stinky breath.  While it's true that I'm personally not a particularly huge fan of mint-flavored anything (including ice cream especially) this Dentyne Pure Mint gum works WONDERS!<br /><br />Two years ago I had a bad tooth, and it got to the point that it became infected and in desperate need of removal and emergency surgery by an oral surgeon.  My breath was in terrible shape during this time.  This is the gum I had available with me at the time because it did such a wonderful job covering up the smell of the inside of my mouth.<br /><br />The mint was so amazingly strong, in fact, that it nearly knocked me off my feet!  I almost spit it out but... I'm glad I didn't, because I was told my breath was much better afterwards.  I highly recommend it to everyone.

review/text: I don't usually write gum reviews, but this gum is great. I have tried many different brands, trident, stride, orbit ect and this gum hands down is better quality. Lasts twice as long as trident in my experience, flavor lasts between 1 1/2 hours to 2+ depending on how vigorously you chew gum, and actually the mint taste lasts a lot longer than that but it's just not as "sweet". The best thing though is the taste, this has a very natural mint leaf taste, right when you bite through the shell coating you get this liquid layer burst that has a nice herbal quality that fills your whole mouth and feels kinda "cold", it's really nice. Makes my breath fresher than any other product I have used which is important to me. I am going to keep buying this as long as they sell it.

That being said, it does not have the flavor of alcohol, but the intense fragrance of pure, ripe pear.  It's not dark-colored as pear butter and many pear preserves are, but is golden and caramelized with purest pear flavor. If you love the wonderful flavor and fragrance of pears, you'll probably love this jam. Great with really good butter on hearty toast, or stirred into Greek yougurt!

It is not too spicy so if you like real heat, you might want to add some cayenne pepper.  It is just right for us and allows the beefy flavor of the skirt steak to come through. It also does chicken proud.  We serve them on fresh flour tortillas.

review/summary: This oatmeal is just amazing!!!
review/text: Just for starters, I have never liked oatmeal!<br /><br />I was forced to eat it as a child because it would stick to my ribs and keep me well nourished. However, it was pure torture to eat it.<br /><br />I was staying with my family at a Residence Inn last week and thought that I would give oatmeal a try from their continental breakfast bar.<br /><br />While the oatmeal did not have an objectionable taste (being nice), it was all sticky and gooey which was not too nice!<br /><br />Wanting the health benefits of oatmeal, I decided to give this product a try after reading the reviews.<br /><br />First of all, this is a more coarse cut of oatmeal, which I would not classify as "meal" at all. It is more like a boiled grain with a bit of  chewy consistency. There is nothing sticky or gooey about this at all.<br /><br />For me, the fact that I am eating oatmeal (should be called oat"grain"), is nothing short of a minor miracle. It is pleasant and tasty. What a pleasant surprise!!!!<br /><br />I hope that you will give it a try.<br /><br />Blessings ad good health to you and your family!

review/summary: Nothing better!
review/text: I highly recommend this product!  There is nothing better than steel-cut oatmeal.  For years I hated oatmeal, until a year ago I tried this oatmeal.  After reading about how nutritious and healthy this was, I decided to give it a try.  It is delicious!  I prefer it with soymilk and often add golden raisins and a few nuts chopped up.  But it is just as good with blueberries, bananas, or chopped apples.  Whatever fruit you want to add works!<br />Give yourself a treat and just try it for a couple of mornings, and you will be hooked!  Since I leave for work really early, I often make a big batch the night before, refrigerate it and microwave a bowl of it for breakfast every morning. (It can stay refrigerated for about 5 days and still taste great!)<br />All I can say now is Enjoy!

review/summary: Great product. Delicous
review/text: This is some of the best oatmeal I've ever had. Keep in mind that it takes over 30 minutes to cook (several hours in a slow-cooker) but it also holds very well for days in the refrigerator. Therefore, we always make at least triple batches and continue to heat them up in the microwave for the next few days. It is great reheated with frozen blueberries added to it. Mmmmmm<br /><br />If you've read that oatmeal can be healthy and a good way to reduce your cholesterol they aren't talking about instant oatmeal. Instant and quick (minute) oatmeal can be cooked quickly because it isn't the whole oats which are needed to get the health benefits. These steel cut oats have Dietary Fiber 4g made up of Soluble Fiber 2g and Insoluble Fiber 2g while <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1LI4">Quaker Instant Oatmeal Variety Pack, 14.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> has Dietary Fiber 3g made up of Soluble Fiber 1g and Insoluble Fiber 0g.

review/text: Best price ever for steel cut oats and they are vacuum-sealed in a can. Oats are uniformly cut and cook up in only 25 minutes. I cook a cup at a time which lasts me most of a week. They store well in a plastic storage container in the refrigerator. I measure 4 cups of water and a tsp of salt in a 6 cup pan, add a dash of nutmeg and a handful of dried cranberries (craisins?). When the water reaches a rolling boil, I tun the heat down to low (#2 0n my range), and stir in a cup of the oats, set the timer to 25 minutes, come back when it goes off and store the cooked oats. A bowl of these oats with Sweet n Low and milk heated in the microwave will keep me satisfied for 5 -6 hours. Great fiber!!!

review/summary: Better than rolled oats
review/text: Our purchase of McCann's began with my husband wanting to eat a healthier breakfast and wondering what steel cut oats were. We've always eaten the rolled oats and wondered how steel cut oats could be so much better.  Well, they do take a little longer to cook, but no worse than cooking brown rice, and just as easy.  Since our mornings require a quick breakfast I cook a batch (four cups of water, one cup of oats)in the evening and store it in a covered container in the fridge, the next morning we scoop out a serving, heat in the microwave for a minute stir in sugar and cinnamon then add milk.  This makes four hefty servings.  Now eating it requires some time.  You don't just swallow this stuff like the regular rolled oats you may already be accustomed to.  They have a great slightly chewy quality and a great nutty taste that rolled oats just don't seem to have.  McCann's steel cut oats are to be savored.  Don't microwave it long, just enough to warm it.  I'll reserve the old rolled oats for oatmeal cookies, but McCann's is for breakfast from now on at our house. Hubby likes it with one or more of these additions: chopped dates, chopped figs, pecans, raisins, dried cranberries, chopped apples, cinnamon.  It's seems more like a dessert.

review/summary: mighty fine
review/text: I eat oats with some regularity (pun intended).  The rolled oats are fine when I'm in a hurry.  When there is time, steel cut is the way to go.  These McCann's oats are pretty good.  When I have a lot of time, I use Alton Brown's overnight oatmeal recipe as a starting point.  My recipe is basically a cup of oats, 3 cups water, a 1 cup milk, and a cup or two of dried fruity stuff if any is handy.  It goes into a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R4FTZU">crock pot</a> and cooks overnight.  I cook mine on medium.<br /><br />Next time I order oats I'm going to try out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007NG56S">Steel Cut Oats Pinhead Oatmeal - Bulk 50 Pound Bag</a>.  The price is too good.

review/text: This is the best oatmeal I have ever eaten - and I've tried many brands.  McCann's is more like a meal than a bowl of cereal.  The tins are also great for long-term storage so I keep them coming on a subscription basis.  The Quick and Easy variety is also delicious and cooks up quickly.  Cooking several servings at once is simple.  Bring 8 cups of water to a boil and then add 2 cups of oatmeal, reduce heat and cover for 5 minutes stirring often. After cooling, refrigerate and enjoy as a cold snack throughout the day or nuke and enjoy hot. Add whatever treats you enjoy most.  Splenda and blueberries are my favorite additives.  I get about 90 miles per bowl.

While I find great savings on books, this is one example where the Amazon price isn't so great, and for me the front door delivery isn't offset by the large price difference.<br /><br />So the product gets 5-stars, the price gets 1-star.

review/summary: Cooking it in a programmable Rice Cooker makes for an easier breakfast!
review/text: I never had much patience for Steel Cut Oats, until I read about someone using a rice cooker to make it.<br /><br />How easy could that be?  I have an old 3 cup "fuzzy logic" type Rice Cooker, and using "Porridge" mode works best.  A word of warning, do not rinse the oats, just pour in the water, set for porridge, press start, and walk away!  I am used to rinsing rice and did that with the oats, and it was really dry, not at all oatmeal.<br />If your rice cooker has a timer, you can set it up the night before too.<br /><br />Using a rice cooker makes cooking steel cut oats more convenient than cooking instant oatmeal on the stove.  It is pretty slow though, but if you are used to rice cooking times, you'll be fine.  Just don't expect it to be done in 5 minutes or less.<br /><br />And McCann's Steel Cut Oats in general?  I haven't had a chance to compare it to other brands, but I really like the tin cans.  Very strong and thick.  But I don't really like the thick foil seal, cutting it leaves a rather sharp and ragged edge.<br />Of the many cans of McCanns Steel Cut Oats, they have excellent quality control, same great taste each time.<br /><br />-Ed

review/summary: Great Oatmeal
review/text: I have been eating oatmeal on and off for the last ten years and recently I have found myself enjoying a nice hot bowl for breakfast, especially because its winter. I was first introduced to John McCann's Oatmeal when I decided to quit eating rolled oats because of their texture and the inspiration of watching the episode of "GOOD EATS" featuring steel cut or pinhead or Irish oats. I originally found these oats at my local market and found them to be delicious, although, they do take awhile to properly cook they are by far the best option in terms of flavor, nutrition and texture. Their flavor is similar to brown rice while still having a bit of a "wheaty" taste. They are very nutritious, but as most nutritious foods are, they must be portioned because of their high calorie content, (I find that half a cup, 300 calories, is the perfect amount) although they are very good for fighting cholesterol and the fat they contain is "good" fat. Their texture is also similar to brown rice, but softer and creamier if prepared in such a fashion. I make my oats two ways, on the weekdays I make them in a rice cooker overnight which produces a piping hot bowl of deliciousness and on the weekends I take my time and prepare them on the stove top. They really are a delicious way to start my day and I look forward to enjoying a bowl every morning. Being that I eat pinhead oats everyday I found that buying these tins was beginning to get quite expensive, so one day I went to a bulk foods market and bought a pound of bulk steel cut oats thinking they would be a lower quality and good for the weekdays. Since then I have done numerous side-by-side comparisons of the two and they are exactly the same in taste and texture, making paying double for John McCann's Oats a delicious, but obsolete choice nonetheless.<br /><br />Pros: Delicious, nutritious, and the tin is re usable.<br />Cons: Somewhat expensive when compared to bulk options.<br />Overall: Buy these if you aren't going to be eating them everyday; they are delicious and well worth the money.<br /><br />I cook my steel cut oats on the stove top thusly:<br />1/2 cup steel cut oats<br />1 tbsp unsalted butter<br />2 cup water (boiling)<br />1/2 cup milk<br />1 pinch of kosher salt<br />2 tsp sweetener (brown sugar, honey, or maple syrup)<br /><br />Take a 12" sauce pan (or something comparable) with a lid and turn heat to medium, add butter, let melt and add oats. The idea here is to roast the oats. Be sure to shake the pan around every minute or so to keep the oats from burning. After about three to four minutes or until the oats smell toasty add the boiling water and drop the heat to low and cover. Let sit for thirty minutes and slowly stir the oats every five minutes until done. After thirty minutes has elapsed add milk, salt and sweetener stir until combined (If a more creamy mixture is desired add more milk or cream to oats). Serve hot and enjoy.

review/summary: The best oatmeal out there!
review/text: I like this stuff better than regular oatmeal because it is healthier, tastes better, and creamier. Now the directions say to make it with four cups water and one cup of the dry oatmeal. But I make it with two cups of water, two cups of milk, and one cup of oatmeal. That adds to the creaminess.<br /><br />Also, here is a wonderful tip I learned from my many times of cooking the oatmeal. This stuff takes about thirty minutes to cook normally (because it has to simmer for a while). What I do is cook it the night before. I boil the milk/water, add the oatmeal, stir it in, put the cover on, then put it in my fridge (without cooking for 30 minutes). In the morning you then take that pot and basically just slowly warm it up to a boil and presto! lovely, creamy steel cut oatmeal for breakfast. BTW, that is enough oatmeal for two people.

review/text: I was never a fan of oatmeal when I was a kid.  To me oatmeal meant bland and mushy instant oatmeal.  Then an episode of "Good Eats" convinced me to give this grain another try.  Now I eat a big bowl of McCann's oatmeal about every other morning.  I don't like milk so I cook it in fruit juice, sometimes with dried fruit added.  When I cook it in orange juice, I add dried cranberries.  When I cook it in apple juice, I sprinkle cinnamon and just a little nutmeg on it.  I generally cook it in a crock pot set on low for several hours.<br /><br />Regarding the packaging:  Sure the cans get dinged up during shipment.  So what?  The oats don't suffer.  Even with the dents, the cans are still sealed airtight and the oats are delicious.

review/text: This oatmeal is awesome!  I put it in the crockpot with just water at night and voila!!--breakfast is ready the next morning!  It tastes wonderful--I'll never go back to traditional or instant oatmeal--I'm now spoiled.  Plus having breakfast ready the next morning can't be beat--you can only do this with steel cut oats, by the way.  You'd only get mush with any other type.

review/summary: McCann's Oatmeal
review/text: Heres the trick to cooking McCann's Oatmeal, the night before boil your water then add oatmeal turn off the heat then cover. Next morning before you do anything, Stir, looking for a fairly stable consistancy and turn on a very low heat. Then return to getting ready for the day, returning to stir occasionally. It will be ready in 15-20 minutes. Great with Splenda/Brown surgar blend, banannas, strawberries, or whatever. Then a couple slices of Ezekeal toast with butter and flax seed oil. Be healthy.

review/summary: Heavenly oatmeal.
review/text: Oatmeal is a comfort food for me.  I hate the instant stuff as I was home-grown on my grandmother's long-cooking rolled oats that she cooked on a kerosene-burning stove.<br /><br />When in Ireland many years ago, I had steel-cut oats on several occasions -- another amazing experience. Any time I've tried Irish Oats at restaurants here in the U.S., they've had a funny taste.  I suspect most kitchens use shortcuts.<br /><br />I was thrilled when I purchased these oats, cooked them with care, and tasted the results. Heavenly! No shortcuts to great oatmeal.

review/summary: I really wanted to like this.
review/text: After reading all of the reviews, I ordered this.  I am trying to lower my cholesterol and I am not fond of rolled oats.  I was a bit disappointed in this product.  I guess that I expected a better textured oatmeal, but I was not pleased with the "brown rice" cooked product.  Yes, it was like eating brown rice for breakfast - not that I have anything against brown rice.  This oatmeal does have a little more flavor than regular rolled oats oatmeal.  I also don't have time to cook oatmeal every morning for at least 30 minutes, so I guess you could say that I don't have time for these oats.  If you have the time and like oatmeal to begin with, you may like these.  If you don't like oatmeal and don't have a bunch of time to spend cooking these, then I wouldn't suggest buying them.  Personally, I am going back to eating old fashioned rolled oats - 3 minutes in the microwave and they are done.

review/text: McCann's steel cut oatmeal is good stuff. I was always tired of many hot breakfasts because it felt like you were eating something that though it may have tasted good it lacked appeal because it had no chew or texture to it. Try this steel-cut oatmeal and see if it is not a whole lot more interesting. Dress it up with a little milk, cream, maple syrup. brown sugar, molasses and see if you don't buy more. Buy a pack of 4 tins and save on shipping too!

review/summary: Awesome.  Plain and Simple.
review/text: Have tried several of the popular Steel Cut Oats products from various manufacturers over the past couple years.<br /><br />This is hands down the best we have tasted (and less expensive here on Amazon than any of the other brands we've tried so far, even some in bulk packaging).  Our 8 and 9 year olds LOVE it, and ask for it every day for breakfast.  They moan when we serve something else, like any cereal from a box......even those 99% sugary cereals (actually have some going stale...they won't eat it anymore!).<br /><br />We cook this in a rice cooker on the porridge setting. Takes an hour...but if you plan ahead, or use the timer setting, it's so worth the wait.  Creamy, but still a bit al dente.  Put any fresh or dried fruit in it...along with some honey or pure maple syrup....just AWESOME.<br /><br />Even the cans are pretty and nice....kids want to save them for storing stuff.

review/summary: Ohh, ohh, oatmeal.
review/text: In an effort to eat more healthily, I bought McCANN's Steel Cut Oatmeal.  I'm sure most of you know, that steel cut oatmeal aren't rolled and boiled, so as a result, become slightly more nutritious than its rolled oat cousins.  Rolled oats are common in the instant oatmeals.  But enough of history.<br />Now, I didn't really know how much oatmeal this would yield, but one cup yields enough for 4 large servings.  As a 4-pack, I think this will probably last me a few months, easily.  Maybe the only pain is that it takes half an hour to make, but it's worth it.  The oats provide a nice bite and a slight crunch, but it's overall smooth.  Honey is always a good thing to add for quick flavor.  Fruits work just as well.  If you're feeling really adventurous, and have a brulee torch on hand, you can sprinkle the top with some sugar and proceed to brulee! And of course, you can add fruit before or after the brulee for a new dimension of flavor!<br />Bottom line, this will fill you up, and for quite a long time.

review/summary: The Best Oatmeal
review/text: I love this stuff.  I first had it at a four star hotel while on vacation.  I think this brand is far better than the Quaker Oats Steel Cut version and Bob's.<br /><br />A great way to make it, adapted from Cook's Illustrated:<br /><br />1.  Melt one tablespoon of butter in a pan and add one DRY cup of oatmeal.<br />2.  Then add it to two  cups of water and one cup of milk that have been simmering.<br />3.  Towards the end of cooking, around 30 minutes in, add 1/4 teaspoon of salt.<br />4.  Cook for about 45 minutes.  Add additional water or milk if needed and serve.<br />5.  I usually double the recipe when i'm cooking for the family.

review/summary: For the oatmeal conoisseur
review/text: If you are used to microwaving your Quaker oatmeal and pouring a packet of powder that is mildly like apples and cinnamon into the bowl, then this might not be the oatmeal for you. It has things like texture and a flavor of its own going for it. This is a man's breakfast, not a child's. It's thick, it's hearty and it tastes fine without a bunch of sugar, syrup or fruit, although I must admit, I am partial to adding fruit. Bananas are nice. This tin is an excellent value. If you go to Whole Foods or a similar shopping establishment to buy your Mc Cann's, you are not getting the most out of your breakfast dollar. Buy your Mc Cann's in bulk! You're going to want plenty of it around!

review/text: This is my favorite breakfast.  The oatmeal that is readily available in the store has been cooked, pressed and dried three times.  This is a true whole grain.  It takes a while to cook, which is why I make enough for the week on Sunday.  This breakfast is hearty, chewy and, unlike your morning corn flakes, it has substance when you eat it.  My favorite way to eat is is with milk, brown sugar and strawberries.  If you are a texture person and do not like rice, you will probably not like this cereal.

review/text: As someone who is 60+, I remembered enjoying steel-cut oats as a child and thought that it was a product that was long-gone from the food scene...in fact, I remember it was difficult for my mother to find it even back then.  I was surprised to see it offered at Amazon and decided to try it.  It has the same dense, crunchy texture I remembered and a great flavor. In addition to eating it with some sort of sweetning (brown sugar, maple syrup, etc.) and milk, we also make it as a 'hash' where we mix prepared steel-cut oats with pork sausage and then saute patties.  I also enjoy it simply with butter,salt, and pepper.  As you can tell, I love it and recommend it!

review/text: Both my husband and I love the taste of this oatmeal.  A nutty flavor with wonderful texture.  I never realized how bland some oatmeal was until I tried this brand.  This is a long cooking oatmeal but worth the wait.  I think that precooked oatmeal has too many nutritients removed in the process. If you want fiber in your diet, this is one of the best sources available and low calorie if don't add in butter or cream.  I always make a big pot of it so it lasts the week.  I add jam or preserves for sweetness and sometimes maple syrup or honey.  Fresh fruit when in season really is great or spices for a change. Since we use it daily, the 28 ounce tins are the most economical especially if on sale.

review/text: McCann's Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal makes a really great breakfast.  It's taste, texture are far superior to any brand I've ever had. It's hardy, nutritious, versatile every day.  For Sunday breakfast hard to beat, I recommend starting off with a steaming bowl with your choice of flavorings (if desired, it's good by itself)--you can add some brown sugar, maple flavoring, blueberries, chopped apple, apricots, cranberries, banana or whatever (it's good with everything).  Serve it with orange, apple, grape, cranberry or some juice and coffee or tea.  Follow with English muffins, bagels or toast, favorite type of eggs, sausage or bacon and fresh fruit, and I'll guarantee, you'll swear you'll have a gourmet meal. I order it by the case regularly.

review/summary: Fantastic oatmeal!
review/text: I hate the glue-like consistency of rolled oats, and even the pulverized flavored oats with tons of sugar are pretty nasty to me. I love the texture of steel cut oats, and McCann's is one of the better brands (not all steel cut oats are the same). They taste great and are easy to prepare, either by using a rice cooker, slow cooker/crockpot, or preparing the night before by boiling half the required liquid, adding the oats, then cover and remove from the stove and let it sit overnight. Add a little more liquid if needed the next day, nuke in the microwave and its good to go! Try adding peanut butter and cocoa powder with one packet of Splenda per serving, dried fruit, cinnamon and brown sugar, or even a spoon of canned pie filling such as apple or cherry.<br /><br />Others have mentioned problems with the packaging and receiving dented cans, but I think Amazon has fixed that problem. My 4 cans came shrink-wrapped together, along with a sturdy cardboard bottom. That was inside a larger box with a bunch of air pillows for padding, so the cans are completely unblemished.

review/summary: Healthy Oats-Great Taste
review/text: I initially bought a can of this steel cut oat from a local retailer and loved it. Subsequently I bought another can from a local party store and it tasted stale and bitter. Needless to say that I tossed it into the trash. Later I went online and found it on Amazon marketplace from DAB Nutrition and ordered a pack of four.<br /><br />I never liked rolled oats but once I discovered the steel cut oats I got hooked. I cook mine in my Zojirushi Induction Rice Cooker <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MAIW1C">Zojirushi NP-HBC18 10-Cup Rice Cooker and Warmer with Induction Heating System, Stainless Steel</a>. I use 4 parts water to I part Oat plus a drop of Extra virgin Olive Oil to avoid sticky residue on the cover. Alternatively I use 2 parts "Original Rice Dream" plus 2 parts water to 1 part Oat. Substitute the word "part" with the word "Cup". I put the mixture in the Rice Cooker and select the Porridge cycle and in 1 hr 7 Mins the cooker would play a beautiful melody to signify that breakfast is ready. You can use the timer setting on the cooker too but it may have a little 'leftover' or 'overcooked' grain taste to it in the morning. This is why I do not like the taste of the so-called "GABA Brown Rice". But if you have to leave for work early morning then timer cooking may be a way to go. If you like your oats thick then use 3 parts water to 1 part Oat. Once the Oat is done what you put into it depends on how health conscious you are as well as the limit of your imagination.  Toss in a few dried dates or cherries, how about a spoonful of wheat germ or flax seed? Be creative and your body would thank you for it. I do not cook my oats on stove or in the micro wave. Always buy fresh Oats.

You can cook it in a slow cooker with plenty of water and get a creamy soup-consistency (I like my oatmeal less thick and more like a porridge). If you make a big batch, you can add a little water and heat it up in the microwave. Although it's fantastic when it's fresh right off the stove.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: McCann's Oatmeal is perfect for my rice cooker
review/text: After reading reviews online, I bought this product. On my Zojirushi rice cooker, I set a morning timer for cooking Oatmeal porridge. It's just what I wanted for my breakfast. The only imperfection is there is a slight stale smell when opening each can. but wiil be gone few days later.

review/summary: GREAT BREAKFAST STARTS HERE
review/text: Texture is 100% better than rolled oats if not overcooked! Well worth the cooking time for sure, great extra nutty taste if you toast the cut oats in a dry skillet before using!<br /><br />I definately recommend this product to anyone who wants to eat healthy and enjoy your meal in the process.<br /><br />You could soak the oats before going to bed in the appropriate amount of water for a shorter cooking time in the morning but I don't care for the texture when prepared that way; to close to that of rolled oats if you get my drift.

review/text: I'll be honest, if you want a quick breakfast don't purchase this oatmeal. But, if you have time to spare or don't mind waiting for some "good eats", this is the oatmeal for you.<br /><br />Step 1. pour some milk into a sauce pan; Step 2. add a dash of salt [or salt to taste]; Step 3. add oatmeal, making sure it stays covered by milk; Step 4. turn on stove to low heat [not too low but definitely not too high, as you don't want the milk to evaporate/dry out leaving you with tough oats in pan] and cover pan; Step 5. do some little cleaning to built up appetite making sure to ck on progress periodically; Step 6. add more milk if oats are still too tough and let it simmer for a little while longer; Step 7. get your ladle/just pour directing into a bowl add a few raisins/cranberries/your favorite dried fruit and ENJOY!

review/summary: Add Drambuie and brown sugar and you've got oatmeal for adults
review/text: Our family began ordering McCann's steel cut oatmeal more than a year ago through Amazon's Subscribe & Save program.<br /><br />We have a family breakfast of this oatmeal every Sunday, adding frozen berries, or a tablespoon of brown sugar and an ounce of Drambuie to the cooking pot. We'll prepare this oatmeal for breakfast during the week as well but leave out the Drambuie.<br /><br />The texture and nutty flavor of this oatmeal sets it apart from anything else we've experienced. Until a friend recommended McCann's to our family, we'd only stocked various brands of instant oatmeal. Breakfast had been perfunctory with oatmeal as just another option among cereal bars and yogurt.<br /><br />We highly recommend McCann's Steel Cut Oatmeal. The convenience and price offered through Amazon's Subscribe & Save program are added bonus.

review/summary: best oatmeal!
review/text: We've eaten all  brands of oatmeal for years, McCanns Steel Cut Oatmeal is the best product I have found.  Cooked according to directions, it has a chewy texture, nutty flavor, and is satisfying.  I prefer it without extra sweetener.  My microwave simmer cycle brings liquid to a boil and then reduces power to simmer for time set.  Using the microwave, I don't worry about scorching or burning. Use a large bowl to allow for oatmeal and water to come to a boil but not spill over.  If it boils over, it is a mess.  I prepare it first thing in the morning and ready to eat in 20-30 minutes. Amazon price has been competitive.

review/summary: I love this oatmeal
review/text: i bought it at my local grocer on a whim. had never heard of it but I like oatmeal and it looked diffrent. I've been buying it ever sence. I like the flavor and the texture (not mush like rolled oats). But my daughter (who is 11) thinks it's the most disgusting thing there is and can't stand the texture she says it's "crunchy". But my boys (who are 2.5 and 4.5 always ask for 2nd's when I make it. So, as with any food item, it's all a matter of taste.<br /><br />I don't mind the extra time it takes to make this. But with a family of 5 no breakfast is fast and this actually is faster for me than eggs & sausage, pancakes or french toast.<br /><br />I like it jus with milk and brown sugar.

review/summary: Best oat meal on the market
review/text: I've eaten oat meal just about everyday for the last 5 years and this brand is the best I've tasted. I normally eat Quaker Oats because it's more economical, but I'll buy a can of McCann's once a year because it's so good.

review/summary: WOW! Irish Steel Cut Only!
review/text: I saw all of the rave reviews here and decided to give steel cut oats a try.  But, i tried a cheaper, non-irish brand.  It was ok, but nothing special.  About a month later, I saw the Mccann's for $4.99 and gave them a try.  Unlike the non-irish oats i tried, you can taste these.  These are simply amazing.  Buying a cheaper, non-irish variety is a waste of money.  Nothing beats these.  Amazing and the best tasting oats available.
