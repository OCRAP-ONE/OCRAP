The vet said that he has seen animals die from using it. She's now on prescriptions to knock out the infection caused by it irritating her ears. Don't take the risk!

review/summary: Love this tea
review/text: I normally get this tea at Teavana stores in the mall or their website, so was excited to see it on Amazon (as I have tons of gift cards here). It seemed to take a little longer then other products to arrive but came in great shape and came with a free sample just like my other orders from the Teavana site have (which makes sense since they're partnered with Amazon). I drink the White Ayurvedic Chai with the  Samurai Chai Mate and they taste fantastic together. They're supposed to be full of caffeine but for me they're my anytime tea. I have to steep a little longer then recommended time as I like my tea strong (with a bit of sugar or honey :) but it tastes great. Not to sickly sweet like some fruity teas.<br />It is sweeter then some of their other teas, so if you don't like sweet then you may want to try out some of their others. I recommend going into the stores and sampling their array of teas they usually have set out to find your favorite. The blend they normally have of this one is good but not always what comes out at home though so don't just go by that one. They use German rock sugar (which they sell) and that costs a little more. Most people will use normal table sugar, honey, or artificial sweetener which will affect the tastes. Anyway, go try the tea, find your tea and drink happy.

So while it's a pit pricey, it's well worth it, particularly if you reuse the leaves.

review/summary: Strong, dark and decaffeinated
review/text: I like tea (but not in the morning anymore, not sure why) and I like a cup when I get home from work. But caffeine of any kind now after 12:00 pm keeps me wide awake until the wee hours. So my favorite cup of Irish tea is right out ...until now. Barry's Tea is pretty good; I like it as well as Lyons, and both are strong, Kenyan-Indian blend teas guaranteed to drive away sleety weather from your bones and even cool you off on a hot day.<br /><br />This is about the best decaf tea I know of. It is not quite as aromatic and snappy as Barry's Green Label or Red Label, but it is decently strong (I put two bags in a full four cup pot.) It stands up to evaporated milk and it is good on its own--very smooth. It does oxidize in the cup rather quickly, going from a beautiful golden russet liquor to a dark brown but that doesn't affect the flavor. Now I can have my tea and a splash of milk when I get home and not be watching the ceiling for half the night. Bravo!

review/summary: Excellent Decaf tea!
review/text: I am always looking for new brands of decaf tea, to me they all taste hot water with a little color added to it!!  Recently I found Barry's Decaf and gave it a try.  Barry's decaf has an incredible taste for a decaf tea!  It is full body, very flavorful, and brews a good strong cup of tea.  It is hard to believe it is really decaf. A bit pricey but well worth the cost for anyone who enjoys a good cup of tea.

review/summary: Best among the decaf's
review/text: I have been favorably impressed with all of the Barry's Tea line. For a decaffeinated tea, this one is indeed very good. I have to qualify it ('for a decaf tea') because I have yet to find any decaf tea that begins to approach the robustness of a regular black tea or black tea blend. But if you need to avoid the caffeine, as I do, this a very good one to start with.<br /><br />Bear in mind that I like my black tea served in the English style--sweet, with milk--so for me, the tea has to be really rich, dark, and malty (primarily Assam, with hints of Ceylon and Darjeeling is my favorite). But if you drink your tea straight, then you might think this is perfect just as it is!<br /><br />By the way, if you like this one, you might also try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002M3QZKM">PG Tips Decaf 80 Ct Tea Bags - 2 Pack</a>. It's also quite good, as is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPUCSQ">Typhoo Tea Decaf 80ct Tea Bags</a>. But Barry's is my favorite.

review/text: while searching for healthy treats I came across these biscuits. The ingredients are better than most dog foods! They're also grain-free, and even though I don't feed grain-free exclusively it's good because it keeps him from having too much grain in his diet, and also the product has a high meat content. They're pretty big so I need to break them up in quarters for my 8lb dog, but they're so thick and solid that I have to use a good amount of strength to break them, lol, but I'm a bit of a wimp (the duck variety is easier to break up). The other day I ran out of dog food and didn't realize it until it was time to go to work, so because the ingredients were so high quality I was able to actually give him 2 of these and another brand of healthy treats for breakfast! We're about half way through our 2nd bag and he's not bored of them at all. Next time I'll get another flavour to make sure he doesn't get bored. I almost feel bad for not giving him something more junk foody. I get ice cream and the poor thing gets healthy biscuits! Lol.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Salmon,<br />Chicken Meal,<br />Potatoes,<br />Chicken Fat (preserved with Mixed Tocopherols),<br />Flaxseed (source of Omega 3 and 6 Fatty Acids),<br />Calcium Ascorbate (source of Vitamin C),<br />Vitamin E Supplement,<br />Salt,<br />Calcium Carbonate.<br /><br />(doesn't get any better than that. :D)

review/summary: My dogs' favorite bedtime snack
review/text: My two dogs absolutely love these biscuits.  While they may get an occasional treat during the day; they are firmly entrenched in their bedtime "cookie" routine.  Not a chance that I would be allowed to forget this special moment as far as they're concerned.  My big shepherd is a huge fan of most cookies...rarely have I known him to turn down any type...but he does get more excited about these than he does most of the others.  My little 12-year old terrier is particularly finicky about her choice of biscuits though.  I used to buy mostly dried "jerky" type treats for both dogs.  The jerky comes in a variety of meat types and is easy to keep in a pocket without crumbling.  I've noticed in the past year though that my little old girl has trouble with the dried jerky.  She gets so excited about getting the treat and gulps it down too quickly; and then spends the next 20 minutes hacking and gagging because pieces got stuck or scratched her throat.  This worried me so I switched to biscuit types that will crumble when she bites into them.  This is the only biscuit type that I can get her to eat...at least of the healthy ones that I would be willing to feed them.  When I have tried to give her a different type, she grabs the biscuit as usual and then just spits it out and continues to look at me expectantly...still waiting for the "right" cookie.  She will opt to have NO cookie if I've run out of BB Wilderness biscuits.  I've tried the duck version of this biscuit also.  She still spits it out, but at least goes ahead and eats it if she realizes that the salmon ones aren't going to materialize.<br /><br />I only buy high-quality, healthy snacks for our pooches.  When I removed wheat and corn from their diet several years ago, my little terrier got rid of her "itchiness" for the first time ever.  No more feet chewing.  It's great to find dog snacks like these that are grain-free and only full of healthy ingredients.  The price on Amazon is good.  I'm currently using up my stockpile of bags that I bought when a local store was closing and I was able to get them for $8/bag.  I'll be ordering them from Amazon once my stash is gone.  Can't have my little girl going "cookie-less."

It is a delicious tasting medium bold coffee that is great to drink in the morning, though I drink it other times as well. It has a very pleasant aroma that completes the taste experience. I vacation a lot in Vermont, and this tastes just as good as the coffee in the small country store where I get my morning coffee.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is one of my favorite "wake up" coffees.

Soon, everyone in the office was drinking it, and it's the only coffee we stock now. I always feel pleased when we have guests at the office, and they compliment the coffee - which is most of the time we have guests. It makes me feel like I found a real gem.

review/summary: Quickly Becoming My Favorite
review/text: This coffee has a wonderful taste and aroma.  I take my coffee with just a little sugar and no cream/flavorings because I feel that a good coffee should have enough flavor to stand on its own.  This one does.  I love it.  Just enough acidity but not a hint of bitterness.  Very smooth, and yet it still has some character - it's certainly not a weak coffee by any means.  I bought this along with GMC's Wild Mountain Blueberry, which also comes highly recommended.  Between you and me, I enjoy this blend more than the blueberry.

review/summary: Greenmountain Coffee for Keurig Brewer: Too Weak
review/text: I bought Greenmountain Vermont Country Blend for my home Keurig brewer because it was so good at work.  Got my box delivered to my home and was disappointed to find it way too weak.  Nothing like the brew at work.  I opened up a K-cup and added more coffee to it from another one and it was  normal (very good).  I'm getting an RMA number and sending it back along with the pumpkin spice coffee which was also too weak.

review/text: Green Mountain Vermont Country Blend coffee falls into the "OK" category for me - I'd drink it if that was the only choice, but I'd reach for something else if there were more choices.<br /><br />I use a 10oz cup & found this blend to be slightly acidic with a bland flavor.  It does fall into the medium blend arena.<br /><br />In my opinion, there are better choices available - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Coffee People, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0033GMSTY">Donut House Collection Light Roast Coffee, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039555VM">Van Houtte House Blend Melange Maison Coffee, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>, and Tully's Madison Blend K-cup (which doesn't seem to be offered in k-cups on Amazon at this time).

review/summary: A compromising blend for the masses (i.e. your office)
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:31 Mins<br /><br /></span>Listed as one of Green Mountain Coffee's "most popular blends," the Vermont Country Blend offers a safe choice if your Keurig serves a larger audience, such as an office environment.<br /><br />The coffee has a pleasing aroma, with hints of fruit and caramel, and a gentle finish. While Green Mountain's website describes this as "an engaging blend that reveals itself in layers" but that was not my experience. It is a pleasant, middle-of-the-road blend, but not the type of K-cup I'll reach for first in the morning.<br /><br />One reason the Vermont Country Blend didn't blow my socks off was that it arrived at the same time we ordered Green Mountain Coffee's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004743O08">Nantucket Blend</a>. Of the two blends, my wife enjoys Vermont Country lighter roast more. I prefer the more complex tones in the Nantucket Blend. We both tried the Vermont Country Blend black, using Keurig's small mug (7.25 oz) setting.<br /><br />Added bonuses:<br />Vermont Country Blend is certified kosher by the Orthodox Union.<br />Vermont Country Blend is Fair Trade Certified.<br />Vermont Country Blend is organic.<br /><br />Rating: Four stars.<br /><br />BTW: Here's other K-cup coffees I've recently reviewed for Amazon:<br /><br />5 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004743O08">Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend</a><br />5 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFUDC">Coffee People Donut Shop Medium Roast</a><br />5 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039556K2">Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle</a><br />4 stars: Green Mountain Coffee Wild Mountain Blueberry<br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL68Y">Tully's Coffee Kona Blend</a><br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XNW">Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic</a><br />3 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KKS">Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend</a><br />3 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00390VIQI">Green Mountain Coffee Fair Trade Gingerbread</a>

review/summary: The best vanilla flavored tea I have ever tasted, in a sealed bag nonetheless!
review/text: This tea is so flavorful.  The vanilla is natural tasting, unlike many other brands I have tried.  It is so smooth, you can drink it without sugar or milk, though a little sugar and milk brings out the vanilla even more.  I left the room for a minute to work in my home office and came back to a room that smelled like real vanilla bean.  I wonder if they use real vanilla bean in this.  Plus, unlike other SerendipiTea items I have ordered, these boxes came sealed in plastic bags, unlike the prior unsealed paper bags. Now I am thinking maybe the Black Velvet I bought from them would be even better if I would have gotten it in plastic sealed bags.<br /><br />Even if you are skeptical about vanilla teas or trying to find one that doesn't taste bad, too sweet or just downright fake, try this brand.  I drank four cups of this yesterday and was in love.

In the past few months I've made so many repeated purchases (even sending my husband in one time while I was sick) that the lady who owns the shop commented, "wow, you must really love this tea!"  It has a vanilla flavor but also hints of chocolate.  I sweeten it with splenda and it's a wonderful morning tea.  I would definitely recommend it!

review/text: I sent this cake to my daughter who goes to college in Florida. It was sent for her birthday which I indicated on the message site for this product. I was really happy that it actually arrived on her birthday. Unfortunately, "Happy Birthday" wasn't on the cake ( not a big deal), but the icing had begun sliding off,too. Ok, Miami is hot and even with good packaging things don't always go right. What was really annoying was that the cake was so bad it had to be thrown away. My daughter couldn't even finish the first slice she had taken. I understand that store bought cakes never taste as good as a homemade cake made from scratch, but this one wasn't even edible at all ?! That's just not acceptable, and I would not recommend this cake at all.

review/summary: Not your grandfathers shredded wheat!
review/text: This is a really fun cereal to eat.  You got the frosted side of the square which is delicious, and then you have to eat the non frosted part because it is attached to the frosted part.  The makers cleverly decided to use fruit filling as the glue to hold the two sides together.  This is the best tasting fruit cereal glue I have ever tasted.  My 10 month old son watches me eat them with jealousy in his eyes and drool on his lips.

review/summary: Not As Good As Before
review/text: Saw this in the grocery store recently and was very excited. As a fan of the previous fruit filled version, I was eager to try a bowlful as soon as I got home. The mixed berry flavor was very sweet & artificial, and by the time I'd eaten less than half the bowl I'd had enough.<br />  The flavors from before like strawberry and raisin tasted very fruity and complimented the frosted shredded cereal perfectly. When there is already frosting on the top side of the square, the filling doesn't need to be super sweet.  It tasted like a frosted mixed berry Pop Tart, so I'm sure kids and younger folk will be a fan on this cereal, and perhaps that is who it is marketed to now.

review/summary: Frosted Mini-Wheats Cereal, Touch of Fruit in the Middle (Mixed Berry)
review/text: Anybody else remember Raisin Squares? My mom would buy them for herself when I was a child, and I loved them so much, I would sneak them. They stopped producing them years ago, much to my dismay. When these mini-wheats with the touch of fruit in the middle came out, I was thrilled - they are even better than my beloved Raisin Squares! They are a great cereal - my mornings are pretty hectic, so I don't often have time to sit down and eat breakfast, but this cereal is perfect for popping in your mouth on the go. It's a great snack too. I teach middle school and sometimes I bring in snacks for my students - this is one of their favorites, which is great because they are a fairly healthy food.<br /><br /> It's awesome that this Frosted Mini-Wheats Cereal is available on Amazon, and eligible for subscription - the price is fantastic. I haven't subscribed yet, but I probably will - I like to place an initial order before I subscribe. I was concerned because when my order arrived, the boxes were very out of shape - so much so that they couldn't even stand upright - and I was worried that the cereal would be crushed, but I've gone through one box already, and there were no more crumbs than usual. Another great Amazon buy.

review/summary: Almost as good as the original
review/text: I have been looking for fruit filled mini-wheats for about 15 years.  They were harder and harder to find before being discontinued.  These are almost as good as the original; my only complaint being that the original was not frosted, and I would prefer them unfrosted because the fruit adds enough sweetness. I paid $4.96 at the grocery store for one box- so Amazon's price is great.

review/text: This cereal is always fresh and crispy. It is a great hit with my daughter, she eats this every morning for her breakfast.  Sometimes, as an afternoon snack.  even I eat as a snack or I just munch when watching TV.  It is better than eating salty chips and building lot of trans fat. Packaging is good and shipping is always quick. I use subscribe and save option, and so never run out of the stock.  Would continue to use the S&S and highly recommend it.

review/summary: Why High fructose corn syrup??
review/text: It is a great idea to put more fruit in the cereal, and it tastes good, but why does Kellogg have to add High fructose corn syrup into the fruit component of the cereal. HFCS is one of the worst things Americans eat, and Kellogg's is putting more of it into our body. HFCS is used because it is super cheap to manufacture, but Kellogg's could make the effort and use Splenda or some other sweetener rather than this terrible ingrdient. Why not try not using a sweetener too? Very disappointing.

review/summary: I really like Folgers Instant Coffee, and it's Good Cold for Ice Coffee
review/text: For instant coffee I think this is the best brand out there.<br /><br />I see one of the 3 star reviewers wondered if the 5 star reviewer realized they were reviewing instant.  Well, yeah.  It is *instant* coffee, which I imagine some folks just don't like.  But I like it.<br /><br />Several positive points:<br /><br />1: I like strong coffee.  Office coffee is never strong enough.  With this I can put in as much as I want.<br /><br />2: I've tried the new Starbuck's instant coffee.  I think this is as good, and WAY cheaper.  I wouldn't say it tastes the same, but I'm not convinced that one is better than the other.<br /><br />3: These 4oz jars are nice.  You can slip one in a jacket pocket to take to work or pack for a trip.<br /><br />4: It dissolves OK in cold liquids, if you like iced coffee, which I do.  It doesn't dissolve completely, at least not at first, but neither does other brands of instant coffee.  If you actually use a spoon (rather than the dump and swish that I use) it dissolves better.  And if you stir (or swoosh) again when it's half gone and again at 2/3 and 3/4 gone, it'll get all of it.  OR start with a bit of warm water, get it dissolved really well, then add cold water, milk and ice.  OR just get used to the small amount that doesn't instantly dissolve on the surface and tell yourself that they're "sprinkles", and basically get over it.  The Starbuck's stuff also doesn't dissolve 100% in cold liquids either.<br /><br />So, for instant coffee, this is darn good, hot or cold.  For cold, I suggest adding some milk.  Iced coffee without milk tastes a bit harsh to me, regardless of the brand.<br /><br />If you don't like instant coffee then you may not like this either.

review/summary: When I have to drink instant coffee - Folders is my choice
review/text: Instant coffee is not my first choice when I drink coffee. I prefer fresh brewed. However, there are situations when you cannot brew a coffee of your choice: at the office or when I travel and want to have coffee in my room.  In such situation I use Folgers coffee.  I have a jar in my office, and take a small zip lock bag with Folders coffee when I travel.<br /><br />I have tried other instant coffees and prefer Folders for the following reasons:<br /><br />1. I like strong flavored coffee with deep color, other coffees do not give me the same flavor with just one tea spoon<br /><br />2: Compared with Starbuck's Via instant coffee (which fits the bill for strong flavor) it is much more economical without large difference in taste.<br /><br />3: It dissolves in hot and cold water (with a bit of extra stirring), which is important if you are using it when you are travelling, since you may or may not have hot water in the room.<br /><br />4. Most frequently I drink my coffee black and Folders is not bitter black.<br /><br />So, even though I generally prefer brewed coffee I always have some Folders instant coffee on hand for those occasions when brewed coffee is not an option.

When I opened the seal the aroma was very good, but when I tried the coffee it tasted odd, like a chemical taste and didn't smell very good - it just doesn't taste or small like coffee. I have been told some makers use cheap Robusta beans from Viet Nam, so this may account for the taste. I'm sipping my third cup right now, and I don't think I can face another 177 cups from this jar! Thankfully, my grocer accepts returns.

review/summary: A Great Coffee
review/text: Folgers Classic Roast Instant Coffee, 4-Ounce Jar (Pack of 6) is "aroma-roasted, specially ground and made from Mountain Grown� beans, the world's richest and most aromatic."  It is the way we prefer coffee.  It is nothing but coffee -- really great coffee. My friend tried to sneak another brand in, but I could not tolerate it.  There are a few other kinds I like, but I always depend on Folgers to taste the way classic coffee is supposed to taste.<br /><br />The history of Folgers goes back to the 1600's when the Folger family moved from England to Massachusetts Bay Colony.  Shortly after arriving in America, Peter Folger married Mary Morrell.<br /><br />In 1849, three Folger brothers went to the West Coast to mine for gold.  One of the boys, James Folger, stayed in San Francisco because he did not have the money to finish the trip.  In 1850, he went to work as a carpenter building a placed called The Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice  MIlls.<br /><br />After working at the mill for a year, he had enough money to stake a claim and go to mine for gold.  He carried spice and coffee samples with him.<br />(Before then, people had bought green coffee beans to be roasted at home.  Factory roasted coffee was revolutionary.)<br /><br />Eventually he returned to San Francisco, became a partner in the business, and bought the company in 1872.  He called it J. A. Folger & Company.  The family business expanded to Texas and Kansas City.  (For more of the story go to  www.folgers.com)<br /><br />Now, for the history of our Folgers.  My friend travels extensively and sometimes takes me along.  He always has a jar of instant Folgers in his suitcase.  He likes the instant coffee crystals classic roast better than brewed coffee.<br /><br />I didn't know for a couple of years that he was toting his coffee around in his suitcase, but finally there was a time on a trip that he brought me a cup of coffee from his hotel room to mine.  Wow! It really is great coffee.<br /><br />I use this delicious coffee (along with pureed collard greens!) to make some of the best chocolate cake you ever put in your mouth.  I tell all about this special practice in The Collard Patch.

I was getting Taster's Choice instant at Costco before they stopped selling it, while not tasting like fresh brewed it managed to satisfy my coffee craving in places where I couldnt brew it fresh. By contrast I found Folger's instant undrinkable. It had a strange chemical taste going down and gave me a stomach ache after I was finished. So I have a bunch of this stuff sitting and staring at me and I loathe wasting things but this stuff I cant stomach. I drink coffee black maybe this stuff is better with milk?
