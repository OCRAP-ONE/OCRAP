review/summary: Great Coconut Milk
review/text: I love having this coconut milk on hand for curry and other creamy recipes. But mostly what I use it for is its creamy top layer. I put a can in the fridge so that when opened I can scoop off the thick, hardened coconut cream. This I put in a bowl and whip it up using the whisk attachment on my immersion blender. I often add back just a little of the coconut water left in the can. The beautiful whipped cream results are useful for topping anything that you might want whipped cream on. I also use it in my tea. The left over water can be drunk, poured over pet food, added to any recipe that needs liquid. Nothing is wasted.<br /><br />Note: I don't use coconut milk because I have to avoid dairy; no, not at all. I also use many dairy products. I just think this is a good way to experience a very tasty and healthy alternative.

review/summary: The real thing from Napels!
review/text: I have tried many espresso brands and grounds but none beat this one.  Kimbo Gold is genuine espresso from Napels, famed for its incomparable coffee, and uses only the best Brazillian coffee beans.  Its taste can be best described as potent with a real kick, but without any bitterness, and with a deep yet clear espresso flavour.  I prefer it to some of the better known premium brands, such as the otherwise excellent Illy caffe. Its flavour is much richer and isn't even lost in a capuccino or latte - the milk if anything seems to bring out the flavour even more.  I highly recommend this espresso to anyone who is looking for the real thing.

review/summary: A gift turned tradition
review/text: I received a 8.8 oz package of Kimbo Gold Medal roast as a present this February. A coffee snob, in which Starbucks is not the top rated brand in my book, I was reluctant to try Kimbo on a full Sunday morning brew.<br /><br />However, I was surprised to find the finely ground beans espresso-worthy, and the bold smell immediately inviting. After a sip of the coffee, I was overwhelmed by the rich, fine, almost 'homegrown' taste. I am sorry that I cannot find this coffee in local stores, but I will invest in the company and its imports directly to my front door.<br /><br />This coffee is commendable, and words do not do it justice. It is the perfect purchase for those who are looking to enjoy a weekend morning brew, those who are looking for a gift that will impress the coffee drinker who has 'tried everything,' or the many who cannot travel to Europe to drink a fine cup and experience chills from such wonderful, honest taste.

review/summary: CURRY IN A HURRY
review/text: I have been using this brand of curry paste for years.  There is green, yellow, and this red curry paste; I change up depending on the type of flavors I want for the meal.  There are differences in the ingredients; the red is real spicy.  The paste is in a sealed bag, that you can snip the corner off and squeeze out what you want to use.  Stir in with oil, then the veggies; this will let the flavors mingle before any tofu, or meat is placed in the meal.  Top off with coconut milk, and the pepper heat is reduced greatly.  These are easier to use than just powder curry.

review/text: Besides being a great tasting cup of coffee, I like the idea that's it's organic as well as a fair-trade product. It was also a great price and ends up costing only 39 1/2 cents per cup.  You certainly won't get anything at the big "S" for that price! My husband and I both like this one and have received our second shipment.  We've had our Keurig/Breville coffee maker (which we just love!) for about 6 weeks now and have been ordering all varieties of coffee.  Coffee People's Tree Hugger, Jet Fuel, Wake Up Call, along with Paul Newman's Extra Bold, are all at the top of our favorite's list so far. Try it, I'm sure you'll like it!

review/text: I drink bold k-cups brewed at 7oz with one cream pod.<br /><br />I just compared my first morning cup of this coffee with my favorite k-cup, Timothy's Rainforest Espresso, and find the Tree Hugger to lack depth.  It has neither the strong coffee scent or taste I desire but it is smooth, with no chickory-like bitterness and not nauseatingly weak like some of the flavored coffees.<br /><br />Unless my family requests it, I won't buy it again.<br /><br />Added note:  I thought I might be too harsh in my review so today I had Rainforest first and Tree Hugger second.  Tree Hugger is a decent cup of coffee and better than McDonald's but still not as good as Rainforest.

review/text: My favorite K-cup as been Timothys x-bold rainforest blend, and I think treehuggers every bit as good. For me, a 10oz.cup is strong yet mellow, but usually I make it a 14 oz. (take it plain) which is about the strenght of most restaurant coffees. Good restaurant quality pretty much describes this blend. I love that it's it fair trade and organic, but doesn't specify rainforest alliance certification. That is important to me, enough to spend more money, and drink less. Timothys rainforest is certified and that is enough to sway me to their side.

I used to think CP donut shop was good, CP kona was a little better IMO, but tree hugger puts them both on the back burner for me.<br /><br />This was so good I had to get it on auto delivery, which by the way makes this coffee only $17.25 per 48 k-cups or 36 cents a piece, you can't find a cup this good for a better price.

That said it makes a pretty good cup of coffee. I use the larger of the two settings on my machine so I like a coffee that has a little extra kick to it.  The "Fair Trade" is a plus as I'm in favor of those arrangements when reasonable as it appears here.  Not as concerned about the organic aspect as it's coffee.  If I was that concerned about organic, I probably wouldn't be drinking coffee anyway.  I'll probably reload on this if the price stays reasonable.  I do tend to bounce around on my k-cups though, that's one of the perks. (pun intended)

review/summary: Passable for tree huggers
review/text: I will preface my comments by saying that, while not a coffee snob, I am a coffee enthusiast (I enjoy reading about coffee, roasting it, grinding it, trying different methods of brewing it, etc.).  Although I've had Keurig-brewed coffee before, I just bought my own machine and am in the process of sampling the many different varieties of k-cups out there.  I typically prefer robust, "city" roast coffee with a lot of depth, but with higher notes to add some complexity.  I drink my coffee black, and have been using the medium (I believe it's 7 oz) cup setting on the machine.  I have only tried a few k-cup varieties so far; so, as far as k-cup coffee is concerned, I have little for comparison.  My favorite so far is Newman's extra bold.  That being said -- I found Tree Hugger to be a bit pale by comparison.  Calling it is extra bold is somewhat of a stretch.  I realize that in k-cup terminology, "extra bold" simply means more coffee per k-cup, but the coffee itself lacks depth for my taste.  It does have brighter (berry) notes as noted in the description, but does not have substantial body, nor does it linger on the tongue.  Rather, it imparts a slight "dry" mouthfeel that, while not offensive, leaves me less than satisfied.<br /><br />As for me, I am not a tree hugger, so that aspect does not sway me; nor do I really care if it's organic, to be quite honest.  (We all die sooner or later, and no matter how long the good Lord has decided to keep me here on this earth, I intend to enjoy my coffee -- organic or not).  However, if these things are important to you, then perhaps you will find Tree Hugger to be an acceptable cup of coffee, especially if you prefer a more "dounut shop" style coffee.  For me it was "okay," hence the 3 stars.  Thanks for reading my 2-cents worth.

I just received my first box of the Tree Hugger and found it to be a very smooth, clean finish.  A lighter cup of coffee for after getting home from work.  The only thing that I find rather, shall we say, humorous or odd is the fact that I get my Donut Shop and my French Roast Dark and Wake up call in the Frustration Free packaging which is claimed to be more environmentally friendly but this "Organic" coffee is not available in such packaging.

review/text: I researched the internet for hours trying to find the most affordable way to get all of the Coffe People brand Kcups that I wanted in one shipment.  I was so happy to discover that the price listed on Amazon is for 2 boxes!  The price per cup is about 10 cents cheaper than I was going to pay on other sites!

review/text: Coffee People make some great coffee.  My daughter-in-law alerted me about this coffee when it came out and I'm just finishing up my 4th box.  The Coffee People are introducing Travel Mug size Keurig K-Cups in the Donut Shop brew and I'm hoping that they do the same for Tree Hugger.  Try it, you'll like it.

review/text: This isn't a bad cup of coffee from the Keurig maker.  I have to admit that I love the convenience and speed of the Keurig, but don't think it makes the best cup of coffee and detest the use of plastic.  However, it was a gift and I felt it was something I couldn't exchange.  I've tried various makes and types of coffee.  This is one of the better ones I believe and I was able to purchase it at a reasonable price through Amazon.

review/summary: A mild hug
review/text: This is the one that you want to keep your Keurig on the small size setting for. Too much water to coffee ratio will result in a bland cup, and you'll miss some of the subtle sparkle of the top notes. Low acid means easy on the stomach, but it takes some care to coax the brightness out. I like it as a 'mixer'...most flavored K-cups are TOO flavored so I add a short cup of Tree Hugger, and it's just like the baby bear says...'this one is juuuuuuust right!'

This is very close to that but better - this time you can have it anytime. I have tried many bold and weak K-cups, and this one is one of my favorites. A little half-&-half and it is off to coffee loving nirvana! Get it, you won't be disappointed unless you don't like deep flavored coffee.<br />Now, if there was a way they could create a K-cup that did not use plastic...

review/summary: My new favorite
review/text: Since getting my Keurig, I have tried a variety of K-cups.  This is a fairly easy process for one who regularly "shops" at Amazon.  Amazon features a good selection from various suppliers and seems to be getting additional varieties frequently.  The Amazon prices are the most reasonable I've found.  Usually, you can get 50 K-cups for $20 or less.  There's FREE SHIPPING if you spend a total of $25 which isn't at all difficult for someone like me.<br /><br />My personal coffee preference is medium.  I dislike the French Roasted varieties which taste somewhat burnt to me.  I like a full-bodied coffee that's not too acidic.  I find Tree Hugger to be more satisfying than the Donut Shop variety that was my previous favorite.  Try it.  I'd be interested in seeing what the other Keurig coffee drinkers have to say.

I am a huge fan of the "Organic" Fair Trade from Coffee People, but of course saw that it was out of stock, which led to my order of the Tree Hugger blend with some hesitation. I was right!!! It tastes like, perhaps, one would expect Tree bark would taste. It is no "fair trade" at all for the Organic. Will never order again, nor do I have the heart to even give it away. It's going back to the earth in which it came, via: Garbage pick-up.

review/summary: Packaging of K-cups
review/text: I received my order on time; however, there were coffee grounds all over the K-cups inside the (2)Tree Hugger boxes and I had to wipe the coffee grounds off of each cup.  While doing that I found several foil tops off center on the cup.  One was so much so that it had emptied half of the coffee out of the cup!  I am hesitant to use the other damaged ones for fear that the gounds might empty into my coffee cup.  I am very upset because these cups are not cheap even when they are discounted.  I use the convenience of the K-cups because I have Lupus and it is easier for me when I am in a flare and my hands, arms, etc. are compromised.

review/summary: Disappointing flavor. not what I expected at all.
review/text: I love Coffee People's annual K-cup of their "Santa Buzz" which isn't a flavored coffee, just a nice bold flavor tasty blend and a matter of fact to me their best flavored coffee. The problem Is, it's only available from them around the holidays. So in desperate need to stock up on "Santa Buzz" after the holidays for a good price I contacted Coffee People directly to ask if I can still buy this fabulous flavored coffee from them. Sadly they advised to me that it was no longer available, which to me is a big mistake, this is my favorite K-Cup blend ever! So I asked them what would be the closest in flavor to the excellent "Santa Buzz" and was told that this "Tree Hugger" would be it. I thought by chance that maybe the rep was pretty much possibly telling me that it was, maybe "Santa Buzz" just with a year round friendly name. Well I ordered `Tree Hugger" from here cause it was a little bit cheaper and boy was I so disappointed by it's flavor. It is NOT at all bold and rather weak in flavor. This K-Cup is lacking in almost everyway in the flavor I was expecting. "Santa Buzz" is rich, nicely balanced bold without being overly bold and goes down smooth and well just yummy. "Tree Hugger" taste like the bottom of a pot of weak coffee in comparison. "Santa Buzz" needs to become a year round blend, it is their best blend.

review/text: I prefer a dark roast with robust flavor, which this has. But, it also has this odd tartness to it that I really do not enjoy.  This can be offset by using a little extra half-and half, but of course that also dilutes the overall flavor as well.  It is not flavorless by any means, which is, to me, the worst kind of coffee, but I could do without that sour aftertaste.  I'm not throwing out the rest, but I will try another kind next time.<br />Also, I definitely noticed the lack of oiliness in the beans that other reviewers noted.  Maybe ordering directly from CBD would insure fresher beans.

That said, they're NOT in my hand very long!  He just thinks these things are the "bees knees" and cannot get enough of them! He about ate the entire package the first time too.  They are very small, shapes like stars and moons, light too as the name suggests.  Think just a bit more dense than Rice Krispies cereal and about the size of two of them put together.  I paid about fifty cents for mine with a coupon, so keep that in mind when reviewing price.  They're usually about two for three dollars here in Ohio at the local grocery, but we're also taxed on things like this as well.<br /><br />Great item, sincerely adored in this house.

review/text: I have a zojirushi rice cooker that has a GABA (sprouted rice) setting. It was not easy to find sprouted rice, but recently found it at Whole Foods in Portland Oregon. I would recommend that you try a single pack before buying the 6-pack on Amazon, since it tastes alot different than regular brown rice. I love it and it is a lot easier to digest than regular rice. TruRoots has a very good, fresh product. I get their huge bag of quionoa at Costco and wish they would sell a big bag of their GABA rice as well. You can't go wrong with any of their products and absolutely love this one too!!!

review/summary: Best Brown Rice Ever
review/text: I wrote this review for the 15lb bag of this product but wanted to share this here for those who would prefer to purchase less or in the convenient packages.<br /><br />I love brown rice and for years have purchased a variety of rice products from organic growers. I have also become a fan of tru-Roots and the healthful organic products and their green approach to sustainable agriculture and clean production of their array of products. This rice is the best! I cooked it according to the basic directions on the tru-Roots website. The result was a rice that is nutty and especially flavorful with a fresh, light taste. It was not sticky or gummy and was a bit crunchy with just 25 minutes of cooking and 10 minutes of finishing rest time in the closed pot. It can be cooked longer for a softer rice but I thought it was perfect as it was. I made it to put in a one-pot meal but after one taste, I served it separately for the max impact of the flavor and texture. My husband immediately said "Best rice ever!" I was concerned about buying so much at one time but the savings were worth it and I know now that we will be making this a staple of our rice-accompanied meals. A visit to the tru-Roots website provides meaningful info on their business, production orientation and the healthful benefits of their products. Enjoy!

review/text: Two Leaves and a Bud Organic Earl Grey tea is simply delicious.  Each box comes with one hundred mesh bags of whole tea, not the dust and debris you'll find in cheaper brands.  The tea itself is flavorful and delicious, with none of the aftertaste of commercial brands.  As a single person, I hesitated to purchase so many tea bags at once.  However, it is definitely worth the investment, as the tea comes in sealed individual plastic bags and tastes superior to tea from Starbucks or Lipton.  The tea has a delicate but full flavor, and NO sugar is necessary to make the tea delicious.  In addition to making hot tea, you can also use the bags to make incredible iced tea.  Simply make the tea at double strength and poor over ice.  Again, no sugar is needed - making this tea a good beverage for those of us watching their sugar intake.

review/summary: They changed the recipe!
review/text: I bought a box of this tea a few months ago, and it was amazing, best Earl Grey I have ever had.<br /><br />I decided to order a package of 6 boxes, and the tea I got was completely different. Different packaging, different baggies, shorter string, and most importantly of all TERRIBLE TEA. I cannot even drink it, it is so BAD. It doesn't even taste like earl grey, but cheap Lipton tea. There are no words to explain my utter disappointment. I would give it zero stars, if I could.<br /><br />UPDATE...<br />I called Two Leaves and a Bud to ask why this tea was so different, and they admitted that they have changed not only their tea source, but also their production/packaging facility. So the new tea is indeed a completely different product (these changes span all packaging types: single boxes, bags, 100 count, and 6-box count).<br /><br />Their customer service however, is SUPERB. They offered to replace the 6 boxes with any of their other products. I chose loose-leaf Decaf Earl Grey (which is almost as delicious as the pre-change Earl Grey). I didn't even need to ship the 6 boxes back - they told me to keep it, give it away, whatever. What an outstanding company!

review/summary: Not the same tea
review/text: I had purchased the small boxes of this tea at my local market and thought it is the best Earl Grey tea ever.  So, I ordered the 100 count from Amazon.  While the packaging on the individual bags looks very similar, this is not the same tea; it  the worst tea I have ever had, with a strong unpleasant taste and does not taste like Earl Grey.  I am very disappointed and feel very ripped off.

review/text: The above says it all--after much searching we finally found an Earl Grey that lives up to its name.  Prior to Two Leaves and a Bud we were beginning to think you could only find an EG this good in loose form, but the mesh bags combine superior taste with convenience.  And, by buying in bulk, this little bit of luxury is highly affordable, too!

It's fragrant, smooth, full of body and stands up to both  milk and lemon (although not at the same time).<br />It brews up quickly and strongly, and I usually get two cups out of one teabag.<br />Two Leaves and a Bud is fantastic!

review/text: The recent 100 count box of Earl Grey arrived in different packaging.  The lighter, less sturdy cardboard roused curiosity about the contents.  A longer string on the bags rates as an improvement.  However, the brew tasted weaker on citrus flavor than I remember from previous batches.  Overall, I still enjoyed the full bodied flavor with a smooth finish.

review/text: I used to never chew gum.  However, now i chew it all the time because it helps control my acid reflux.  I can't chew gum with various mints in them because it makes reflux worse.<br /><br />Trident Watermelon Twist is the best tasting gum I've found given my limitations.  It's sugar free and contains xylitol which supposedly helps prevent cavities.  It does have aspartame (nutrasweet) though.  Unfortunately, i haven't found a long lasting gum that does not contain aspartame.<br /><br />Anyway, buying the 12 pack online has saved me a little money and is also convenient.  I was paying around 1.79/pack at CVS so this is a deal.

The flavor is a tantalizing mixture of sweet and savory that wows the palate with every bite. The sauce, not too thick or too thin, has just the right consistency for basting as you grill. Also an excellent marinade for grilling swordfish and salmon. This is as close as you're going to get to a homemade marinade with an asian flair.

These taste absolutely horrible. They taste like sucking on a bottle of cleaning supplies, or maybe like cheap side-of-the-road reststop hand soap. Further, the texture is like soft plastic filled with elmer's glue. Nevermind the bad taste, the texture is so gross you won't want to eat these. These are also very, very unhealthy with a whopping 70 calories PER TWIST. Avoid this candy at all cost--it is repulsive.

Fortunately, I had other casings and some collagen casings that I was able to use.  The sweet and spicy were good but I like even "more heat" in snack sticks.  The hickory were very good but if I used this kit again, would add more pepper and garlic powder.  Like about a tsp of each.  Depending on the type of meat you use, you need to add some binder like about 2/3 cup of soy protein powder for a 7.5 lb batch (available at Trader Joes).  Definitely would recommend this kit.

review/text: I like these casing a lot.  I used to use larger ones that held 3 lbs of meat, but prefer these smaller ones because they fit slightly less than a pound each and you can experiment with smaller amounts of sausage at a time.  Made 20 sausages at this point, with only one casing ever breaking on me (though I admit I may have stuffed it too tightly). I'll definitely buy again.
