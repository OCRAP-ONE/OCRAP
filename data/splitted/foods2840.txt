review/summary: Red Raspberry Leaf Tea
review/text: I've a difficult time drinking red raspberry leaf tea in the past. I wanted to try it again during my second pregnancy for uterine health. This time I steeped it in boiling water, added lots of honey, and poured it over ice. It's still not the best tasting tea variety, but this particular brand seems a bit more palletable than some others. As far as it's potency/effectiveness, I suppose I won't know until the baby comes (although realistically I'm not sure I'll even know then).<br /><br />This price is amazing, too. I kicked myself for paying twice as much at a local health food store. I will definitely be buying my next box here instead.

review/summary: I use this tea for menstral cramps
review/text: I use this tea for menstral cramps.  I drink a lot of it and it works fantasticly on cramps and mood.  Here is the catch - you can't expect to drink one cup and feel better.  I make big containers of ice tea - and I start drinking it all the time about two days before my period even starts.  Also, once my period starts, I try to make sure I have a cup every two hours- sometimes I have even more.  So again, it works but drink alot.

review/summary: Birthing Miracle Tea
review/text: I also had heard from my lamaze class that red rasberry tea was suppose to ease and assist in the birthing process(It is a uterine toner). Well, in my case it couldn't have been more true. I literally pushed 3 times and the baby was out, and that was my first baby. I drank the tea every day for the last two months of pregnancy, up to delivery day. I must say...this time in my 2nd pregnancy i'm going to do it the exact same way. I recommend this product to any woman who wants to have an easier, shorter delivery.

review/text: I usually dont like black herbal tea, but this one i was able to sip on the whole cup without making a face. It is full of aroma and tastes much better than the usual herbal teas that i have tasted in the past. The Rose flavour is the best. How much it really calms u, god only knows, but the pleasure is unbeatable.

review/text: This tea really works. Drink a big cup before bed and in the morning you will have to use the bathroom. Sometimes I have to eat just a little something before it kicks in, but it always works within 1-2 hours after waking up. It does not really taste that great, but it is okay. Definitely helps me keep my weight even.<br /><br />Personally I like Kleritea better (more gentle, tastes better) but that costs almost 4 times as much. So I stick to Alvita Senna Leaf Tea now.

I have continued to drink this every night and I still sleep well but I find myself waking up in the middle of the night once in a while.  I do find myself urinating more often so maybe it is cleaning me out.  No bad side effects, tastes good alone, no sugar or honey needed.  I recommended this to my family and co workers and they all love it.  I discovered this from Dr. Oz.  Hoping to continue to sleep well.

review/summary: Good at first, but quickly became overbearing for me
review/text: I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first.

review/text: I study plants and I am into alternative healing.  I learned about Mullein a number of years ago and found that it's very useful for sinus, cold and flu issues.  Often times I have treated many of my friends with it to help them get back to feeling well.  This particular brand is high quality and good medicine.  I highly recommend buying this tea as we all need to get away from Western medicine as much as we can when other opportunities are out there.  The idea is to stay in balance and not get extremely sick by using products like this early on when symptoms first start developing.  I think you will find this product very useful and effective.<br /><br />*  Please note: Do not mix to many herbs and or prescriptions medicines as they can counteract and amplify the strength or effect of the meds or herbs.

review/text: I have very bad insomnia and panic attacks, and this tea calms me down and helps me to sleep. Research suggests that Valerian works on the brains in similar ways to benzodiazepines, and was used in the past as a muscle relaxant and for DTs. This tea has an obvious effect, though it takes about half an hour to kick in. I smells like crap, but if you mix it with mint tea, it isn't as noticeable. I don't see any problem with the flavor, it does not taste like it smells.

review/text: I bought this product because I read on a couple other sites that it can help with head and chest congestion. I also read it is safe to use while breastfeeding. So I tried it. If I drink it on an empty stomache it does seem to help with my cronic nasal congestion due to allergies. I saw no difference with chest congestion. I only drank the recommended 2 to 3 cups a day. Maybe I would see longer or more results at higher doses. I have noticed that I do smell alot like maple syrup even 4 days after not drinking the tea. I do mix it with Honey, if not it tastes awful to me. I never noticed a maple syrup smell on my 3 year old breastfeeding son like another site mentioned might happen. He does only nurse a few times a day now tho. Overall I like the product and will continue to use it when I am feeling congested. I even recommended it to somebody I know.

review/summary: Best tasting/effective
review/text: After reading reviews from baby sites, I was ready to get my red raspberry leaf tea on and strengthen my uterus and I was so excited that I got the first one I saw, which was the Alvita brand. I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM. I have to say, the Alvita has a stronger tea taste and I actually got contractions when I drank it. I'm only 37.7 weeks along, but I have to say that I think this tea will help move my labor along quite well. I'll update this review later with how it went.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/28/2012:<br />I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around.

review/text: I bought this because I heard about the benefits of Sage tea. I got used to the taste pretty quickly and love to pour it in a glass of ice to enjoy during the summer days.<br /><br />I took a star off because I've been drinking it for several weeks and I'm not seeing the work of benefits that is claimed of Sage tea (but then, I've always believed that you lose some benefits when the teas are in bags as opposed to still being in leaf form?).

review/summary: Not as rose-flavored as you might think, but still good
review/text: I bought this tea thinking it would taste like a rose. I was only half right. While the rose flavor is still there, you have to really search for it. I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea. After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor, you'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit. Which is basically what rose hips are. After drinking this entire box, I found that I really liked it. I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon.<br /><br />Just as an added note, I feel this needs to be mentioned. If you're like me and like to suck on the teabag, I do not recommend doing it with this tea! The bags themselves are not very thick and will break and you will have an explosion of mushy rose hips in your mouth!

I steeped some inside my cup and noticed that all sorts of the tea leaves had come out (I even took a picture and posted it under customer pics) and when I sipped my drink, tea leave crumbs got inside my mouth! I havent noticed any effect from the tea though but I have only used it for a few days so maybe it takes awhile. However, if they'd be able to keep the sacks closed that would help alot!

review/text: When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit, so I bought another box.  The second box, not so much.  I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me.  The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose.  Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes, vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer.  Give it try, it might work for you.

review/text: I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.<br /><br />The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!

If you're concerned about the taste, you can use some sage from your spice cabinet and make a cup. It tastes pretty much the same, but it didn't seem cost effective to use the sage you buy in the spice aisle.

review/summary: Yes it does have an odor that some will find disagreeable, but it works for me and I will continue to purchase it
review/text: I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase.  But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell.

review/summary: Great for potty training!!
review/text: I adopted a 1 year old Yorkie rescue pup who is only semi potty trained. I was having some troubles getting him to potty outside today (like most days). Then these awesome treats arrived! I ordered the Zukes mini naturals roasted chicken treats last night and they were already here this morning with Prime. I gave him one to taste test and he gobbled it up and instantly wanted another. I then grabbed two of them, went outside with him knowing I had the treats in hand and I asked him to go potty. He went instantly! I think tasty treats really do make a big difference. These are also nice and small so giving them a few isn't going to pile on the pounds. We are feeding our pups a grain free dog food so it only makes sense to get grain free treats too. I will be back for more of these for sure both of my pups LOVE these!!!

review/text: Our dog loves these.  We started her on it when she was 7 weeks old (and had about 4 teeth), and she loved it.  She was still too young to eat milk bones or even beggin' strips, but she could eat these.  I also don't feel bad about giving these to her because they are only 3.5 calories each. There is a rapid change in behavior when she hears me open up the treat bag... she sits, stops chewing, and starts randomly performing tricks, hoping to get one... it's pretty funny. We have repurchased these and will continue to do so.

In fact, he grazes.  But when I unseal the package of Zuke's, he bounds at me bouncing in the air.  I taught him "sit" in two minutes using Zuke's (Chicken).  My 19 month old Catahoula Leopard Dog-girl loves them, too.<br /><br />I like the small size of these treats (it's easy to carry them in a snack size ziploc) -- perfect for training/rewards.  I pretty exclusively purchase natural, high quality food/treats for my animals companions.  Zuke's is our household's favorite canine treat!

review/summary: Good size for training
review/text: My dog loves these and they're my training treats of choice.  I've only tried the chicken flavor.<br /><br />They're semi-moist, not messy, and pretty small.  They're not scored, but can still be halved or quartered with a sharp knife or a long fingernail.  Each piece has 3 calories.  For med-small dogs, you can cut them down into really tiny bits and still make a dog happy.  If you quarter them, you could give 20 rewards during training and only be adding 15 calories.<br /><br />The bag has a reclosable seal, and you'll need it because they dry out and get hard and crumbly if left exposed.  If I take some with me away from the house, I put precut treats in a snack-sized zip bag to keep them fresh.<br /><br />They also come in a larger sized bag which is more economical.

review/summary: Great for training
review/text: We have tried a lot of different treats (Milo's kitchen meatballs, Train-Me treats, etc), all of which were great, but I have settled on Zuke's because they are already the right size for a small dog and seem to be made with not too many fillers.  I have a 2 1/2 year old rescue who had a lot of 'tude for 11 lbs.  We adopted her a year ago supposedly already house- and crate trained, but she was absolutely neither. Apart from great advice on aspca.org, it takes a TON of treats to start training an adult dog from scratch.  Of course we used plenty of things around the house (cut up string cheese, hard boiled eggs, stuffed frozen peanut butter in Kongs), but sometimes you don't have anything prepared and you have to crate the dog and get to work. She loves these treats and has proved a quick study.  Happy treating!

review/summary: A Quality Dog Snack
review/text: Using Zuke's mini snack for my 6 1/2 month Siberian Husky has been fantastic. Before starting her on Obedience classes I was required to find something she really went for. I guess it was the trainer's way of making her training easier for her. This natural product has been amazing! It's chewy and savory and just right for my picky dog/pup. Except my pup prefers the beef flavor but thankfully she is now becoming a well-behaved dog.

review/summary: Great Training Treats
review/text: My dogs love these treats - especially the Chicken flavor. They are small, but I find them to be perfect for training.  They are small, low in calories and of high quality so I don't feel bad about giving quite a few out when the dogs are working on learning new things or reinforcing good behavior.  The price on Amazon is much better than my local vendor and delivery is always fast.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Perfect Training Treat
review/text: A trainer suggested these treats over a year ago and once I bought them I never when back to hotdogs.  They are really easy to use and my dogs love them.  When I trained our smaller dog, they were easy to break apart.  Ever since I used them the first time I became a loyal Zuke's convert!

review/summary: Perfect for training
review/text: My husband and I are vegetarians and we were looking for a treat we could use for our puppy's training sessions that wouldn't gross us out. We typically make our own peanut butter dog treats for our dogs, but they're too big and too crunchy to work for training. These moist mini peanut butter flavor treats are perfect! They don't gross us out and both our dogs (the puppy and our 2 year old dog) LOVE them and are highly motivated during training sessions.

review/summary: I think they're bland, but my puppy loves them
review/text: The aroma of these treats is fantastic--there's a tantalizing meaty, smokey smell that wafts from the bag. And the texture of the treats are pleasingly soft and moist. Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed when I tried them. I think they are rather bland, and because they are coarsely ground there are hard bits of stuff in them, one of which got caught between my teeth. I think they could have used a little bit more salt. Also, they're a little small so it takes a lot to fill me up.<br /><br />On the other hand, my puppy loves these things and they have been great motivators for teaching her tricks, so I guess they have that going for them.

review/summary: dog loves 'em
review/text: These are definitely "MINI".  I guess I wasn't really paying attention when I ordered them, bc it looks like hamster food.  My dog still loves it.  I usually grab a small handful and throw them in her bowl.  She never complains.  that being said, here is my review from another order from this dog treat line.  It still applies to this product!<br />I try to stick to all natural products in my household.  That goes double for my dog.  she is a super mutt with a strong stomach, but that doesn't mean I want to take any chances.  these seem like quality treats and she really enjoys them. I have purchased several flavors and she loves them all.  will definitely buy them again.

review/summary: perfect treats
review/text: These are sooo great for training. I just stick a few in my back pocket, usually even break them into halves or thirds and use as treats. My dog loves them, and while she isn't the pickiest, she certainly doesn't like some treats. The real reason they are great though is because she likes them enough so that she will do her tricks for only a third of the treat! (This is an extremely tiny portion, which shows how flavorful they are.) And if they estimate correctly that's only one calorie of her diet! Can't go wrong, I've had chicken and salmon and both are great.

review/text: These treats are a great choice. There all natural. My pom mix has a very sensitive tummy and this treat does not bother him. As soon as I grab the bag my dogs try to do there tricks as fast as they can to get one of these. There soft in texture and the size is great for my 3 month old chi mix who is only 4 lbs. The only reason I gave this treat 4 stars is because they smell horrible other than that if you can deal with the smell. I recommend these! especially to anyone how has a small dog or a dog with a sensitive tummy!

review/summary: Perfect size, but goes quickly
review/text: Like everyone else, I bought these because they are all natural with no byproducts and they're the perfect size for training. I have a Pomeranian puppy and since he was 7 weeks old, I've had him on Blue Buffalo Wilderness Puppy formula which has worked wonders for him and he cannot get enough of. He's now 7 months old and he's as perfect as can be. Prior to trying Zuke's, I used to feed him Pup-Peroni since he loved them, considering that he has a sensitive stomach, it worked for him. After my last batch was almost done, I figured I would buy a couple packs of Zuke's.<br /><br />Of course, his stomach has to get used to the product but his bowels has been watery and not as dense and hard as when he was on Pup-Peroni. He's been on Zuke's for a week and a half and he's still getting used to it. Also, the product goes really quickly as I only have a couple ounces left. So I'd say that 16oz lasts two weeks whereas 16oz of the Pup-Peroni lasted a lot longer.<br /><br />I'm thinking about switching over to the Pup-Peroni if his stools remains watery and soft as it's been 1.5 weeks since he's been getting Zuke's. I still have another pound of the Peanut Butter, so we'll see. All-in-all, my little man loves this stuff even if his stomach isn't digesting it normally.

review/summary: Great Training Treats
review/text: These treats are perfect for training.  They do not crumble and a dog can eat them quickly and easily.  A dog will not lose focus since he won't have to stop and eat.  I actually cut them in quarters for agility class.<br /><br />As far as flavors, my dogs will eat anything.  From the owner's perspective, the salmon smell so much better than the chicken.  The chicken has a typical dog food meat smell, but the salmon does not smell like dog food at all.

review/summary: My pup loves Zuke's!
review/text: I have been buying these treats both on amazon and at my local pet stores for almost 2 years now.  They are the perfect size for a training treat, they fit nicely into some treat dispensing toys (like the artichoke one that Planet Dog makes), and my dog loves the taste! They are moist, but they have a tendency to get dried out if you don't reseal the bag after opening. They are made in the U.S. and don't have any wheat or corn products in them.  They're also only 3 calories each, and perfect for training since they don't completely fill my dog up!

review/text: These treats are awesome. My dog is 12 pounds and these are perfect for him. He loves soft treats and the stinkier the better so this is right up his alley. I have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ARUKTG">Ourpets DT-10504 Smarter Toys IQ Treat Ball , 5 Inches , Colors may vary</a>and these treats are the perfect size for it. They roll out easily but not TOO easily so it keeps him busy for at least an hour. I got the chicken flavor and my dog thinks they're great. I love them because they are healthier for him than the other treats we'd been giving him and they are great to train with. I'm glad it comes in the 16 ounce bag because we go through them pretty quick!

review/summary: Good til the last treat
review/text: Usually I don't write reviews, but who really does unless the product is either outstanding or absolutely horrible. Thankfully this review is not the latter. When I initially got my puppy she was not house-trained, didn't know any tricks and was not food motivated. However, with these treats she was potty-trained and knows quite a few tricks. It was effort on my part, but those treats were definitely a good motivator. Also, looking around at other treats and their prices these are a really great value. If you want something that your dog will enjoy and a great value for the amount and type of treat this is what you want to look for. You and your dog won't be disappointed. I know mine isn't.

review/summary: Great For Service Dogs!
review/text: My greyhound service dog loves these treats! I use them for training or reinforcing good behavior while out. They aren't too stinky, aren't too big, and are really healthy. An additional plus for service dogs is that these treats are soft, so there's no loud crunching sound when you use them in the library or in that quiet waiting room at the doctor's office. The small, round design means you'll fit a lot of these into a typical training pouch, so you won't run out. One note I would add is that, if you don't use them all on a particular outing, be sure to dump the unused treats back in the resealable bag or they may get hard. Other than that, these really are the perfect training/reinforcement treat for service dogs! Great stuff!

review/summary: Did they change the recipe for these??? Rosemary and cherries?
review/text: I have ordered these just a few times for our new puppy and recieved exactly the picture shown (the chicken flavor) but I just re-ordered a new bag and thought I was getting exactly what I had ordered previously but this one is slightly differt.  They have added 'anti-oxidents' to the recipe so it has cherry, rosmary and some other things added.  They are still the small round training treats and are still great (a little more calories at 3.5 per treat instead of 2) but I found it interesting that it wasn't as advertised by amazon.  Do they still sell the old ones or has Zuke's just changed their items?  FYI, I chose the '1 pound' option in the drop-down when I ordered.<br />I still give this 5 stars because I think they are the best treats out there for training, they are small, moist, stinky (that's good for dogs) and made with healthy quality ingredients.  Just not sure if Zuke's changed them or if I was sent something slightly different by accient.  I guess I will find out next time I try to order them!

review/summary: Nuts for these!!!
review/text: We adopted a 10 month mix breed and needed to tap into his hunting breed's tendencies and these treats are the only reason our guy gets excited about training and hunting for treats.<br /><br />We ordered a Kong Wobbler too and these treats are the perfect size and shape to put inside and keep him entertained for awhile.  They're great for having on hand just as treats or as rewards while working on training.  You can carry alot and it not be awkward.<br /><br />He loves the chicken flavor and can't seem to get enough.  I love the price for the size of the bag you get and they last a good while as long as you ration.  Even though they are definitely "mini", each one has such a strong (not overwhelming) aroma and taste that just that little morsel is enough for our big guy.  His nose knows.<br /><br />I'm ordering more today and will continue to order as long as they're available.  Just wish they were on auto delivery.  We'd never want to run out.  Any other treat just won't do.  I highly recommend you at least try them.  You and your pooch will be glad you did.

I found these mini treats, and the bag had awesome reviews from a good amount of people. The treats weren't pricey at all, and I went ahead and bought them. My dog absolutely loves these. They're moist, small, and perfect for training. She listens so well when I bring these out, and she hasn't gotten tired of them at all. She's perfected two new tricks on top of repeating her old ones in just a matter of one day! The only negative I would say is that they do have a particular smell since they are very moist and natural. Overall, these treats are a huge success!

review/summary: Zuke's Salmon, Chicken, and Rabbit work well for my picky dog!
review/text: I've been using Zuke's Mini's for training since I first brought my girl home and she (surprisingly, for she's quite picky) still tolerates them and *sometimes* even seems to want to work for them. (Not having a food motivated dog SUCKS for training - I could literally be walking around with big macs in my pockets and it just wouldn't matter) They are low calorie and reasonably cheap (I can actually find them at some local stores cheaper than I can on Amazon, sometimes) as the bags tend to last a while. (I actually use kibble mixed with the treats when working with her, becuase I'm sneaky like that and she doesn't notice the difference once we get going)<br /><br />Of course not all dogs work with all treats - and it SHOULD be noted that although these treats do not have a lot of the "bad" ingredients in them they still do have grains. (NO grain treats have a much different texture, either from being pure meat or using various ingredients as the "binder" necessary for treats like this)<br /><br />This is the only type of treat we feed that has grains in it; almost everything else she eats is pure meat in various fashions. (lamb lung, water buffalo, venison, rabbit, etc)<br /><br />If you have a dog with allergies you may want to try some of the grain-free options for training treats, like the mini lamb lungs or mini beef jerkies, etc. For our needs, though, these are perfect. \<br /><br />I was SO psyched when I saw that they came out with the "rabbit" variety! I try to keep the variety going in her diet and she doesn't like the peanut butter kind so it was always down to alternating between chicken or salmon, both of which are very common proteins. I can't tell if she likes this kind more or not, but she's definitely eating them which is a good sign! They tend to be more expensive than the other variety so I don't buy them as often, but love including it in the mix!<br /><br />One last thing I wanted to mention, my Mom has small dogs (tiny chihuahuas) and they can eat this size training treat with ease. However, I recently purchased the SMALL training treats for her (they are usually about 1/2 cal per treat) and she said that they are PERFECT for her sized dogs that she is constantly trying to diet. I don't believe they are made in that size by Zuke's but there are several brands out there that also use similar ingredients (no bad preservatives, no corn, by products, etc) that may work better for very small dogs.

review/text: My dog LOVES these treats. They tend to have a very strong fish oil smell. So if you are afraid of the fishy smell, don't get it. But I think my dog likes it because of the smell. These treats are really small in size. They are great for training. You can give your dog several of these without worrying about him over eating. Amazon's price was much more reasonable than any other retailer. You can buy a 1 pound bag on Amazon for almost the same price as a 6 ounce bag at other retailers. It's definitely worth it to buy a big bag if your dog eats them a lot.

review/text: I have a 10 month old weimaraner who is allergic to beef which makes finding treats a bit of a challenge.  Luckily we found Zuke's right away!  There is no beef, wheat, or corn in them.

We've tried the chicken, peanut butter, and salmon flavors, and the salmon are definitely her favorite.  Next up - I think I'll get the rabbit flavor for her to try!

review/summary: Smells Aweful, but Jimmy Loves It
review/text: I can't stand the smell of this treat.  They are very bite-sized (tiny little beads).  I wouldn't mind them so much if they smelled a little better.  As it stands I can't be near the opened bag without getting naseous.  My daughter feeds him treats now.

review/summary: Yummy doggy dots
review/text: I didn't realize when i bought these that they were going to be so small, so as a treat for anything larger than a yorkie you might have to use a small handful of these. Great for my dog outside of the size because they are grain free and have no fillers which my dog is allergic to. They must taste good because the dog cant wait to get a treat after he walk outside.

review/summary: Great yummy treat for my little ones
review/text: I got a border collie puppy recently and have been working on training her. She's so smart so it's nice but she's tiny so most treats are kind of big for her. I didn't want her training treats to take her a bit to chew on. So these are great and trust me she goes BONKERS over them. I wash my hands after the training sessions because she goes crazy over the lingering smell too. I also have 2 cats and they both show up when the bag opens. They have PLENTY of their own treats but they love these yummy morsels. I'll be buying them the Zukes cat treats so they can enjoy them just as much
