review/summary: excellent sweet basil
review/text: Sweet basil is a basic in my cooking.  I ordered this product and was amazed at the huge quantity I received (being used to smaller containers).  It is as fresh as drying your own home-grown basil.  Perhaps this is a life-time supply, haha.  It adds so much to fish, soups, just about anything if you are a sweet basil lover.  I give this product more than 5 stars; it is well packaged and promptly delivered.

review/summary: Sweet Basil
review/text: A must for Italian cuisine, and one of my favorite herbs. The supplier doesn't say where it was imported from but I could care less. It's fresh and very good quality. Basil is one herb that should be applied liberally unlike oregano. It's a good idea to get it out of the bags and into containers right away. I could not possibly use such a quantity, so I gave about half of it away to friends and STILL realized a great savings. Most stores charge 5 bucks or more for a small bottle of basil that is not even this quality. Even my wholesale outlet that sells a very large container could not come close to this value. I also loved the frontier black pepper!

review/summary: Long lasting, and safer in my experience.
review/text: My dogs, and many of my client's dogs, inhale regular rawhides.  I was always worried about them swallowing big chunks.<br /><br />And I really hate flavored plastic bones, as well as veggie bones, since I've seen chunks of those being swallowed whole right in front of me a number of times.<br /><br />These have been by far the best solution for me.  It takes the dogs much longer to chew them, and they really have to work at it.  For all my medium to heavy chewers, these are my first choice.<br /><br />Having said that, nothing is 100% safe.  After chewing up most of the bone, a very food motivated chewer could the remaining hard chunk - which could be a serious problem.  That's why I tend to choose the bigger sizes (8" or 10") over the little ones (4"), and take the bone away when it gets to a swallow-able size.  I buy these in bulk.  The value compared to other types of rawhides is huge, even without a bulk discount.<br /><br />These come in flavors also.  This plain style, as well as the the chicken flavored ones, have not been messy at all.  The beef ones are not quite as tidy.

review/summary: Good Cup of Coffee!!!
review/text: This Tassimo Maxwell House Large Cup T-Disc makes a decent cup of coffee. I think it tastes as strong as a regular cup of Maxwell House brewed coffee, and it is 100 times more convenient. I enjoy making an instant cup of this coffee and taking it to work in my travel mug. I enjoy Starbucks as well; however, it is unfair to compare this coffee to Starbucks, as they are two very different blends. One doesn't criticize an apple because it doesn't taste like an orange. If you like an everyday good cup of coffee, I think you will like this.

review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised
review/text: I just received a Tassimo machine from a friend who is a self confessed coffee snob. Well after Starbucks stopped selling t-discs my friend picked up a Keurig for the wider variety of coffee available with it and gave me their old Tassimo. I as they know am not a coffee snob, lol.<br /><br />Anyway long story short they gave me all of the extra discs that they had left over with their machine and I have been trying them all. Most of them are for small or medium sized servings (which I didn't know) and I have been using 2 discs to fill my travel mug that I take to work. Well this morning I decided to try the Maxwell House Morning Blend coffee and I was pleasantly surprised when I came back and my coffee cup was full. Then I actually tasted the coffee and about 30 seconds later I was looking for the best place to stock up on it!<br /><br />I was excited to find out that I only had to use one disc to fill my mug but it was the flavor that sealed the deal. To me this is a fantastic coffee, I have been drinking Maxwell House breakfast blend coffee from a drip machine forever and this absolutely blows it away! It is a mild flavor but it is very tasty. I always drink my coffee black or with just a small amount of sweetener and many coffees are just too harsh without a bunch of creamer and stuff added to it but this one is just about perfect by its self.<br /><br />Maxwell house, you've definitely (still) got my business.

I generally drink the standard coffee mugs which is good enough for me to get my caffeine high, but drinking the maxwell is like drinking watered down iced coffee because it is just too large.  It's half the size of the Starbucks packets and if they programed it to 6 oz then it would right.

review/text: I have ordered "Alpen" cereal twice from Amazon.com.  The first order arrived in red, white and blue package, herein being reviewed.  It cost $22.34, and was ordered just under a year ago.  The second order was only eight months after the first, (I DO love to eat Alpen cereal!), and cost about $1 LESS!  However, the package for the second order was different.  It is now the brown, white, and gold packaging given to "Original Alpen (Original)".  I know I ordered the Original variety....but the cereal I first recei ved is now called "Alpen with Raisins"....and has shot up in price over $40 for six boxes!<br /><br />Despite the word, "Original", on BOTH packages, and the words, "New Look, Same Great Taste", on my most recent purchase, these cereals are NOT alike.  The most glaring difference is that the product in the red, white and blue package, herein being reviewed, (and which now seems to be called "Alpen With Raisins", although this title is nowhere to be seen on the box, but instead, the appelation "Alpen Original" is still used), is that the product herein being reviewed is CERTIFIED ORGANIC, (I still have one box of my first order!), and the newer, brown box, does NOT have the "Certified Organic" seal<br />anywhere on the box.  Instead of "Organic Rolled Oats", and "Organic<br />Whole Wheat", the newer, brown box lists "Rolled Whole Oat Flakes, Whole Wheat", and etc.  Both boxes, however, still carry the "OU" symbol, signifying acceptance by the Jewish Orthodox Union for kosher quality.<br /><br />I am very, very glad to see that the "old version" is still available.<br />(The brown box says: 'New Look, Same Great Taste', which is a bit confusing....for a while there, I belived the Red, White and Blue box no longer existed.)  However, one pays almost THREE TIMES as much, at present, for the "old" version.  Natural vs. Organic.  Hmmm...both are good, but....  Well, no one ever said Organic food was cheap!<br /><br />I hope that BOTH versions continue be available.  But please, if THIS version, (the one being herein reviewed), is now called "Alpen With Raisins", please put these words on the box.  Having BOTH versions labelled "Original" is highly confusing.  Especially when one version has ORGANIC ingredients, and the other "only" natural ones!

review/summary: Not Fresh - High hopes but doesn't measure up
review/text: Saffron is unusually difficult to find in my local market so I've been trying out several different varieties available here on Amazon...nothing beats the flavor of Saffron!<br /><br />I had high hopes for this one since it is packaged in an acrylic box (unlike Frontier brands which is a competitively priced slightly more expensive version that uses pouches that smell like a pool liner - argh!). The price was suspiciously low so I thought I'd give it a try with the hope of finding an affordable alternative.<br /><br />Unfortunately this simply doesn't measure up even to that of the Frontier brand. While the packaging is STRONGLY preferred...this simply wasn't fresh enough. The flavor was a bit more mild and it required more than double the quantity I've been using for a simple rice dish with the other brand.<br /><br />Notice the expiration date...2017. As of this writing in early 2010 it is good to know the use by date is not near. On the other hand, a seven year window leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />Bottom Line - Preferred packaging but less fresh than "other" brand sold here on Amazon. However, other brand uses less desirable liner that lingers. I'm still searching for a good alternative and will report when I find one.

review/text: Given the rather exceptional rating to this product, I had expected them to be all pure red saffron stigmas. However, on closer examination of the product, the style/stigma of the saffron plant (yellow in color) seems to have been included. Basically, the yellow stigma has NO CULINARY VALUE, that means NO AROMA, FLAVOR or COLOR. The yellow stigma left attached to the red saffron adds upto 50% DEAD weight to the saffron, and you pay for it.<br /><br />Conclusion: Look elsewhere!

review/text: From the looks of the package this saffron is exposed to light. The reason some views say that this saffron is weak is because some of the important chemicals involved in the aroma and flavor of saffron break down relatively fast in the presence of light. As such you'll notice high quality brands use opaque packaging, i would avoid this one if you're looking for quality.

I had a few issues getting the box open without spilling the saffron everywhere, but I have a feeling that someone with a nice strong fingernail would be able to open it fairly easily.

review/text: I have used it for over two years.I work for the airline industry.It was very hard for me to grab the bags but since I started using  SAFFRON I am able to grab the bags and the pain has gonne away. My wife put a pinch of SAFFRON , STAR ANIS and CINNAMON STICKS ( break them in half ) boil them in water on a tea pot when ready you can drink it warm or cold sweet tea before you drink it.First week drink two cups a day , second week one cup a day , on the third week you stop for 3 days and them continue with one cup per day and so on, always stop drinking teafor 3 days after the 3rd week, so you body can clean. Try this and you will start feeling much better, Saffron help in many ways, read about it and you be suprise!!!

review/summary: Didn't stand behind their product !
review/text: I bought this based on the good product reviews. Quality and freshness was good but the Couscous has no flavor at all. It's bland but I can eat it since it's like mush or dry barley. I add it to soup or to lettuce with soy sauce and Parmesan cheese, good as a soup too. Also is better when cold.<br /><br />I bought Couscous at a local health nut store that has great taste by itself so I know Couscous should be flavorful at least outside of India or Iceland.<br /><br />I bought 30 boxes of the stuff so it will be not fun to eat.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I Found mold clumps (mold + Couscous) at the bottom of the inside of all my boxes.  I emailed Hodgson Mill and they tried to blame Amazon.<br /><br />They didn't stand behind their product nor seemed to care at all.  They sent me 5 .35 cent coupons for my next purchase (!).  I also had problems with Weevils (A weevil is a beetle.  Weevils are often found in dry foods including nuts and seeds, cereal and grain products, such as pancake mix) in their  Macaroni & Cheese Dinner Boxes.<br /><br />I won't be buying from Hodgson Mill EVER AGAIN.

review/text: Hodgson Mill has different types of couscous and they are all fairly delicious. This one has the added advantage of being whole wheat and has flaxseed mixed in, hopefully lowering its glycemic index and making it richer in essential fatty acids. I haven't actually compared the nutritional profile with regular couscous.<br /><br />The best thing about couscous is the easy cooking- simply boil water in the microwave, add couscous and salt, cover and wait for 5 minutes. Done! Then you can dress it up. My favorite recipe is sauteeing some whole spices (cumin, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon) along with sliced almonds and raisins and mixing in the couscous, along with a chopped preserved lemon. Serve with grilled vegetables (any kind of squash- winter/summer works well).<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: Terrific flavor and texture, a versatile pantry staple!
review/text: This has a kind of nutty flavor and a satisfying texture. It can easily work with a bit of salt and olive oil as a side dish or with a sauce as a base instead of rice or pasta. I can also see this becoming a nice breakfast food with the addition of a sweetener of choice and perhaps some banana. Glad I tried it based on the great reviews! If you've never tried Couscous, it is SO easy to make! In fact, I just heat some water in a Pyrex measuring cup in the microwave. It gets to a boil between 2-3 minutes. Pour the dry couscous in a bowl (I've even used a coated paper bowl at work, so I can toss it afterward!) and just pour the hot water over it. Then just cover the bowl with a plate (paper or regular) and just let it sit for a few minutes. The water absorbs, just fluff with a fork, easy, done!<br /><br />**A comment about the 1-star review posted above mine: Please notice that customer is in Prague. These concerns reported may be only happening with international orders. Not that it should happen anywhere, but there are more potential problems when food is shipped out of the country. Amazon has warehouses all over, and also deals with vendors who sell through Amazon. I've never had any issues with mold or Weevils from Hodgson Mills or other food brands sold by Amazon. I have had issues with damaged shipments, but Amazon immediately replaced the order. I don't know the policy outside of the USA, but if you order an Amazon stocked item (not a vendor selling on Amazon), in my experience here in the USA, Amazon will always stand behind the product and replace at no charge or refund in full.

Mix in some fresh herbs and Parmesan cheese before serving. Its FAST and tasty!

The "cookie" is super moist, just like a giant sized truffle in taste & texture.  And the wonderful thing with this line I've noticed is that you don't have to think about the ingredients, because they use only the best (organic) and keep the list short.  This recipe also incorporates olives & olive oil which I found worrisome when I picked up a couple for the first time.  But it WORKS!<br /><br />Whole Foods stopped carrying this a week after I discovered them.  Hope I can still get these on Amazon!!!!!

review/summary: STOP, Read this review before consuming this product
review/text: Ask a Chinese friend about "forbidden rice" (&#31105;&#31859;), unless they are history buff like myself, they will give you a puzzled look.  The term refers to an obscure trade policy during Manchurian dynasty, not an exotic rice.  I will not going to bore you  with history here.<br /><br />The story about emperor depriving commoners of red rice is a hoax made in America, like the legion of fortune cookies. Most fortune cookies are made in a wholesome factory near Atlanta.  We trust that fortune cookies are safe to eat.  "Forbidden rice?"<br /><br />There is a red rice in China, dark red, close to red bean.  The color varies from gran to gran. Its thick bran provides a pleasant nutty flavor and al dente texture.  The color does not come off easily.  You can get them from Chinese grocery store.<br /><br />What is sold as "forbidden rice" at Amazon and Costco has a uniformed black to deep purple color.  It appears to be rice over-milled, dyed, and polished.  Drop a few grains in water, you can see color coming off.  And the color tent to sink to the bottom. That is a easy tell tail.  When cooked, the favor and texture of bran are absent.  If they use red rice, they have milled away its bran to make the rice easy to dye.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with using food coloring.  But is the ink FDA approved?  We do not know.  The label does not say.<br /><br />I am returning mine to Costco.  I will ask Costco to pull it off the shelf.

review/text: It looks like the critics agree, this is really good rice!  I made mine in my new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004O87GQU">Aroma ARC-996 12-Cup (Cooked) Digital Rice Cooker and Food Steamer</a> and it came out great (using the "Brown Rice" setting).  I love the nutty taste and texture of this rice.  It does sort of shock people when they first see it, my friend thought I must have either burned the rice or added some sort of flavoring to it, but once you can settle people down to the idea that it is supposed to be black, everyone so far has loved it.  I also like to blend different types of rice together, the only trouble with this rice is it all comes out black.  One of the many reasons I like to blend rice beside the most important is the visual impact, so if this one is in a blend from now on I will cook it separately then blend it after everything is cooked.  That isn't a big deal at all though.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great tasting rice and I can easily understand why the emperors kept it to themselves.

review/summary: The cat, the dog, nor the grackles would touch it
review/text: I bought a can of this for the novelty of seeing how my cat would react to a can of cat food that cost almost a buck fifty.  He's normally not a picky eater and routinely eats canned Friskies or 9-Lives.  I opened the can and placed the contents into a clean feeding bowl and presented it to him in his normal feeding place on the counter (up away from the dog).  He took a sniff and recoiled from it.  I then offered him a can of his regular food that he happily ate.  Well, that didn't go well.  So I then offered it to our Lab/Golden mix, a dog that loves nothing more than snapping up the cat's food if it is left within her reach.  One sniff and she jerked her head back from it and walked away.  Next step was to fling it out into the back yard where the grackles (an omnivorous bird common to South Texas) scavenge for moldy bread, pizza bones, stale chips and pretty much anything else we toss out.  Nope, the grackles wouldn't touch it either.  But the fire ants love it.  They are all over it and within a few days it will be gone.

review/summary: Nasty Stuff
review/text: This stuff is pretty nasty. I live in a household with two cats. I supplement their diets with wet food and thought I'd make the change to a organic brand.<br /><br />First of all, this stuff turned my stomach upon opening it. It smells disgusting, like something died in the can. The consistency was gross too. This stuff was sloppy and fibrous. It looked like spoiled tuna salad and smelt even worse. I thought it had possibly gone bad but the date on the can indicates that it's still quite good and nowhere near the expiration date.<br /><br />I really shouldn't have given this to my cat but I gave him a portion of it (not the whole can) to see how he took to it. He actually did eat it very happily, gluttonously in fact... But he was ill after and the remnants of this come up all over the kitchen floor. That's the first time I've ever had this happen when sampling a new food.<br /><br />I think I'm going to stick to my usual brand. This stuff was not worth it! I am very disappointed and quite disgusted.

review/summary: None of the five cats will eat it
review/text: I looked closley to see what the stars meant with one meaning "I hate it." I. personally, do not eat it, but none of my 6 kitties,including 2 ferals (last time I wrote, I had only one feral, but now have two and neither feral will eat this. They may be wild and not let a human close to them, but they know their cat food tastes. Two stars means "I don't like it, and since I am the one doing the buying, I figure it is OK if I state that that "I don'tlike it" because I do not like buying something that the 6 cats that I feed will not eat it. I feed the ferals outside the back door and I can watch them "eat or not eat" by watching through the window. My kitties always announce the arrival of the ferals by jumping up and down at the window when my regular "orange and white kitty" and my "sometimes I deign to eat here 'black and white Kitty'" arrive for dinner! My, My, What an exciting life I have!!!...The high point of my evening being watching the ferals eat and then writing a review of their eating habits up on Amazon!<br />Anyway, I have made it clear as to how I keep tabs of the ferals and their eating habits. The inside kitties are pretty easy to manage. When trying a new variety of food (new to us) I just put that bowl in the kitchen where "the special eating" bowls go. Dry food and water are in the kitchen and whatever "speciality of the evening" is also located there. No, they do not get a new flavor every night! But one bowl goes there so they always go "aLookin" in the kitchen area for their night's extra bowl of wet food! Spoiled???  Yes!!!! Then I know if it is eaten or not. The specialty bowl gets 3 nights of trial...not in a row...to avoid "nose sticker uppers." But kitties know a wet bowl is always placed alongside the water and the dry in the kitchen. Water and dry are also located elsewhere, but the kitchen ONLY gets the wet nightly special got trial/accuracy purposes. Nothing is TOO much for the trial and accuracy information for Amazon!<br />It has been 3 weeks now with the Newman Chicken and Brown Rice. There is no question. None of my cats eat it. Not even the birds seem to care for it...or any other animal...as the birds generally eat the dried out left overs and if the bowl is chewed to death, it means a coyote has been by, but I haven't had any coyotes all winter.(Somebody is putting out vittles more to their liking somewhere else, or they have gone further south this winter.<br />So, there, my friends, is how I ended up at this choice of stars for Chicken and Brown Rice Rice Formula Newman's Own. Oddly enough, everyone likes the beef and brown rice:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BXT278">Newman's Own Organics Adult Variety Pack Canned Cat Food</a>, but that is a whole "nother" story for a different time.<br />Sorry that we have a disappointing story to tell: Gabby, Trinity, Wisdom, Mercy, Orange and White Kitty and Black and White Kitty...as told to and documented by "Cindy O". Bye for now on the cat food trail tale until we "come upon" something else good ole mom thinks should be tried.

review/summary: Multi Cat Family - All Of Them Love Newman's Own Pet Food
review/text: We switched to Newman's Own dry and wet food several years ago. We have noticed a huge difference in our pets. Yes, we have cats and dogs all who are rescues. Because of their early history, many have health issues. Since switching them to Newman's Own most have leveled out and we spend less time at the Vet. The food cost less in the long run, because of better health for your animals. We also noticed that all of our animals love this product. Some of them like the dry better than the wet and vis-versa. Some of ours where picky eaters and needed to gain weight. Not anymore, they all show up for dinner eager and ready to eat.<br />My brother-in-law has a 14 year old Siamese who was on Science Diet Food for diabetes. He looked like he was on his last leg, the cat not my brother-in-law. Anyway, we started supplementing his food with Newman's Own and I swear the cat looks 2 years younger. He is more active, his eyes have cleared up, and he has lost weight. The vet is amazed as well, as his sugar levels are better. I am not suggesting anyone use this food as a replacement for what a Vet has suggested. But if you have an animal who is not responding well, it is worth a try to add this product to their diet.

review/summary: Cat loves the flavor
review/text: Kitty loves it! Happily eats 1/2 can in one setting (13.5 lbs cat), 2-3 times a day. His fur does look fluffier after 2 months on this food and he seems more content and alert. Wet food does make him urinate more (he used to get a dry/wet mix of Urinary SO prescription diet), but I am glad, because this should help to keep his urinary tract healthy.<br /><br />I researched various options before settling on this one. Among other brands (wet food only), he wouldn't even touch "Organix;" he likes "Evo" fine, but not as much as Newman's own and leaves one-third of food uneatten in the bowl. As far as other flavors of Newman's own, he didn't like the Brown rice flavor (too much rice--the cat kept picking out individual grains out of his food one by one), and strangely, after eating a few cans of store-bought Chicken&Salmon flavor, he refused to eat the same flavor from Amazon.

review/summary: Excellent product... until Amazon ships it!
review/text: I want to start  by saying that if I was reviewing the food alone, it would get 5 stars easily.  It's a quality product and my picky eater cat (as in, he would literally rather go hungry for days on end than be coaxed into eating something he doesn't like) loves it.<br /><br />Having said that, I won't buy this (or any other canned product for that matter) from Amazon.com anymore, unless they were to significantly change their packaging method. Normally I only review a product all on its own because other factors are incidental, but this time it seemed fitting to comment on shipping too because it drastically affected the overall quality of the product and is an unavoidable part of getting it to any customer.<br /><br />The product arrives in a small cardboard flat with 2 layers of 12 cans each, then the whole thing is shrink-wrapped in plastic.  Then they put it in a shipping box and put 3 air pillows on top.  Exactly 1/2 of the cans arrived dented (the entire bottom tier of the flat), many of them so badly that it looked like they had been run over by a car.<br /><br />Amazon.com customer service is great and responsive - they shipped the replacement out with complimentary next-day shipping... and it arrived in exactly the same condition.  In the end, I got everything I paid for, but 1. do I want to go through this every time I order it? No.  And 2. it's hugely wasteful because of course the dented cans are unusable because the seal could be compromised, offering the perfect breeding ground for botulism.<br /><br />I can fairly say that this is typcial for canned products in general from Amazon, too.  I've gotten black beans, kidney beans, chick peas, tomato sauce, and tomato paste from them, and there wasn't one order among them that didn't have the same problem.  Again, customer service was great and sent quick replacements (again with a high damage rate), but it's not worth the hassle and waste.  If it ever occurs to them to pad the entire order and not just the top of it, I'll return to using them because the free shipping and convenience of subscription auto-order (and subsequent additional savings) really are nice.

review/text: *Note to Amazon.com,<br /><br />Pretty please put this Liver on Subscribe and Save! You have the beef & liver and the beef available for S&S but not the Liver yet. THANK YOU SO MUCH!<br /><br />Now on to my review...<br /><br />My cat has been slowly switching to Newman's own beef products over from Wellness brand cat food (which is a great brand and will still be reserved for treats occasionally). I was ecstatic that there was a totally NO grain-and-NO fillers ORGANIC cat food I could feed my 9 year old cat who is prone to crystal formation in his bladder and also plaque build up on his teeth (even though I brush his outer teeth every evening).<br /><br />So far I've tried the beef & Liver and the Liver and he LOVES it. I just ordered the beef today for him which I'm sure he'll love too.<br /><br />This product *IS* very thick and concentrated (the beef liver alone has the consistency of a concentrated pate' and the beef & liver has the consistency of a gelatinous, thick beefy oatmeal), so I scoop it into his bowl and blend a bit of hot water to the product to warm the fats and make more of a 'gravy' for him (he also prefers to eat his food a bit warm anyhow). He barely wants to nibble at his Wellness brand cat food now (which I've had him on for over four years, so I guess that means he's one 'sold' cat. It might be unusual for a cat to love beef so much but my cat goes crazy for beef (especially if I make him steak when I can afford to). So, for me to find him a organic, no grain, beef based line of cat food made his day (and one of his nine lives no doubt)!<br /><br />Anyway, if you know your cat already loves beef and beef liver then he/she will probably be just peachy keen with this product.<br /><br />Here is the ingredients list for Newman's own canned beef cat products:<br /><br />Beef:<br /><br />Organic Beef, Organic Beef Broth, Minerals (Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Carbonate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Iodate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin A, E, E, D3, B12 and K Supplements, Choline, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Biotin).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein..................12.0% (min)<br />Crude Fat.........................4.5% (min)<br />Crude Fiber......................1.0% (max)<br />Moisture.........................82.0% (max)<br />Ash.................................1.0% (max)<br />Magnesium.....................0.02% (max)<br />Taurine..........................0.07% (min)<br /><br />CALORIC VALUE:<br /><br />As fed (Kcal/3oz can)...........156<br /><br />Liver:<br /><br />Organic Beef Liver, Organic Liver Broth, Minerals (Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Carbonate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Iodate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin A, E, E, D3, B12 and K Supplements, Choline, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Biotin).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein..................11.0% (min)<br />Crude Fat.........................2.5% (min)<br />Crude Fiber......................1.0% (max)<br />Moisture.........................83.0% (max)<br />Ash.................................1.5% (max)<br />Magnesium.....................0.02% (max)<br />Taurine..........................0.07% (min)<br /><br />CALORIC VALUE:<br /><br />As fed (Kcal/12oz can)...........129<br /><br />Beef & Liver:<br /><br />Organic Beef, Organic Beef Liver, Organic Beef Broth, Minerals (Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Carbonate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Iodate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin A, E, E, D3, B12 and K Supplements, Choline, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Biotin).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein..................10.0% (min)<br />Crude Fat.........................3.0% (min)<br />Crude Fiber......................1.0% (max)<br />Moisture.........................82.0% (max)<br />Ash.................................1.0% (max)<br />Magnesium.....................0.02% (max)<br />Taurine..........................0.07% (min)<br /><br />CALORIC VALUE:<br /><br />As fed (Kcal/12oz can)...........140<br /><br />Here's to Kitty's health!

review/summary: Fine Food for Diverse Cats
review/text: I have two special needs cats.  One is very small and could stand to gain weight.  The other is too large and needs to loose weight.<br /><br />The smaller cat likes this food. The overweight cat does not over eat on the food, which is a plus for us.<br /><br />We tried Wellness, C&P Organix, Innova Evo (they loved the dry food), Pet Promise, the Whole Foods brand and a few others.  Our cats did not like those brands of food.  Some they wouldn't even eat.<br /><br />They prefer the chicken and salmon brand to the other Newman's Own canned cat food flavors.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Organic<br />* Peace of mind for the cat owner<br />* Liked by cats with 'special needs'<br />* Preferred over other brands by two very different cats<br />* When I open some canned cat foods, the smell nauseates me. The smell of this brand doesn't have the same effect.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* None that I can think of<br /><br />Bottom line:  This is a good organic canned cat food.  Cats differ in their food preferences.  It's a good idea to give this one a try.  By the way, for a while, one or more of the flavors were only available in the smaller cans.  If that is still the case, you may want to try those flavors as well.

When their cat doesn't eat, they give one star. When their cat loves to eat, regardless of the nutrition of the food, they give 5 stars. It is unfair to the manufacturer. Unfortunately, this seems like the trend of pet food rating.<br /><br />Newman always make good healthy and nutritious pet food. They contains no corn gluten, animal by-products, etc that will be harmful to cats. Yes, they are pricey because they are organic. Once a while Amazon runs a promotion on Newman's Organic cat food, and it will be the good timing to stock them up.

review/summary: My cat's favorite
review/text: My cat is prone to Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease, and needed a good quality canned cat food to prevent blockages. Newman's was the first I tried, and he loves all of the flavors except the Beef and Beef and Liver.<br /><br />I recently tried to switch him to Wellness, which is grain-free, and smells much better. But instead of cleaning his plate like he does with Newman's, half the can of food was left untouched. So I'm now subscribing to Newman's because I think it's a great deal for organic cat food (which Wellness is not) even if it has grains. I guess my cat just likes grains!<br /><br />I recommend this food, but keep in mind that cats are finicky (well, most cats anyway). Buy one or two trial cans before committing to a 24-pack!

review/summary: 3 for chicken& brown rice- 0 for beef flavor
review/text: Both of my cats like the chicken & brown rice and Newman's dry food flavors which I buy when they are heavily discounted. Neither of them would touch the beef flavor I bought on a gold box special. It has a faded milky slightly greenish pale brown hue, not medium brown as one would expect and oddly not much of an odor (I know why complain about that, but my point is is should have some type of aroma or odor to it.) Because of the color I did not donate it or feed it to the strays as I think it may be a bad batch. The reason for the 3 stars is for chicken & rice is at the price point there are better organic cat food values that do not contain so much brown rice. I like Organix and By Nature ingredients and my cats do too. Sometimes I'll buy Natural Value or Natural Balance canned foods since they offer more variety of flavors.

Thus, I just bought two cases of food that will not meet my cat's needs at all!<br /><br />Other than that, it seems to be a high quality food.  It is a pate-style food with a meaty, but not unpleasant odor.  Cats ate it right away when offered.  Will be donating ours to the local animal shelter, where I am sure it will be loved!

Plus it's organic so you know you are feeding them the best and you know it's good for the earth.<br /><br />Has the brown rice grains around the outside of the can which is great because it allows the food to easily slip out of the can onto your kitty's plate.  No wated food left sticking to the sides to scrape out.

review/summary: Super high quality for the ones you love
review/text: Besides the fact that it's the only food my fussy bunch of four agree they like...there are other reasons why I love Newman's Own. Check the label.  The first, and most abundant ingredient is organic turkey.  In fact, ALL of the ingredients are organic.  When others pets were sadly dying from contaminated food connected to China, I could rest assured my cats were OK.  Again, check the label...Newman's Own meets the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO...a factor my vet cautioned me on when I went looking for a high quality food. Finally, I buy it because Paul & Nell Newman produce a great line of products.  If you want to treat yourself, pick up a package of Newman's Own Organic Cookies.  It doesn't matter if you go for the Newman O's or the Orange Chocolate Chip Cookies...they're all terrific.

review/summary: My cat wouldn't eat the beef
review/text: This is the first catfood I've had in a can that didn't smell strong of aromas when I opened it, and perhaps that is why the cat wouldn't eat it.  Catfood is notorious for having artificial aromas added to attract finicky cats.  This stuff is all organic and even when hungry, the cat just walked away from it.<br /><br />So the case I bought for the cat literally went to the dogs, who all gave this stuff two paws up.  The dogs saw the small cans as special treats and would woolf it down fast.

review/summary: Fresh & natural
review/text: Great product.  Even my very picky kitty (has digestive problems)liked this flavor.  She always loves salmon-flavored wet food but not usually chicken-flavored wet food, so I was apprehensive about her reaction.  It took her a few days, but she got to like it (not love it).  It looks different from the wet food we're used to, but that's apparently due to the lack of artificial preservatives.  Also, I feel good about buying it since proceeds go to charity.

review/summary: Cat would not eat it.
review/text: I really cannot give this product a bad review.  My cat would not eat it, so I gave it to someone else and their cat loved it.<br />My cat is an adopted stray that was eating the birds in my yard. I started feeding him Purina Cat Chow in a dish on my breeze-way. Ordered the Newman's so he would get more protein. He just didn't go for it.

review/summary: Chicken and Salmon
review/text: My six month old kitty (Tinker) loves the Newman's Chicken and Salmon moist food. I was buying another commercial brand and even though he would eat some most would be left to dry up and most of the can was being wasted. So paying a little more for a quality organic diet and not a bunch of by-products is well worth it.  Plus the Newman's organic brand certifies that ingredients have been grown on farms that have not used artificial fertilizers or pesticides. I have bought two other flavors of the food but this one is his favorite.

Also no worries about him eating the chemicals and junk in other foods-obviously things that were causing his problems. Expensive? Yes, but no more vet bills for tummy medicine!

review/summary: great high quality food
review/text: Pros: organic, grain free and a reputable company that gives back to the community<br />cons: my cats needed a few days to get used to this. yes the meat looks grey. but that is because it is all natural.<br />What I do is mix a 3 ounce can with half a can of Wellnes Beef and Chicken. (so its 3/4 meat and only 1/4 chicken) This seems to work. They love this combo. If I just give them the newman's, they eat but don't finish it. Out of all of the grain free beef canned cat foods, I've had the most success with this. My cats didn't like Nature's Variety Instinct or by nature organic. (Both great brands) But its really important to rotate protein sources so that my cats don't develop allergies (my six year old cat recently developed a seafood allergy after only eating seafood for 5 years...) so I push the beef on them.<br />Give it a shot. It might take some work or creativity but eventually you should win. Both my cats are v finicky and I found a way to make it work. Organic beef! I don't even eat organic beef all the time! LOL! ITs a bit pricey but its worth it. Healthy food = healthy cats=longer life=less disease/health problems.

review/text: Pros:<br />-Good first 5 ingredients: Organic Chicken, Water, Chicken Liver, Salmon, Ocean Whitefish<br />-My cat likes it better than Newman's Turkey and Vegetables formula<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Expensive (but organic)<br />-A top pick for my cat, but noticeably not as much as her favorite: Natural Balance (similar top 5 ingredients: Chicken, [Water], Chicken Liver, Duck, Salmon)<br /><br />So in the organic category, this is a 5-star pick. But if you're willing to go non-organic consider Natural Balance.<br /><br />Here's another food review as well:<br />http://www.consumersearch.com/cat-food

review/text: I have four cats with differing tastebuds/likes.  They all enjoyed this product, and there was no waste.  The supplier sent the wrong size, the smaller 3-ounce cans, but Amazon immediately rectified this in a highly satisfactory manner.  I use the recurring order option for an additional discount, and there is no tax levied on this product (like in stores) on Amazon's site.  I would recommend this product for anyone considering it for their cat(s)

review/summary: Cat won't eat it
review/text: I feel really bad writing this review since I am a big fan of the Newman's Own brand for human food. Their salad dressings are amazing. However, my cat would not eat this product. I purchased the beef flavor because she loves her beef flavored cat treats. I give her organic dry food most of the time, but after talking to some other cat owners, they informed me that I should be mixing some wet food into her diet because wild cats get most of their moisture from their food in nature and don't drink a lot of water. I thought it couldn't hurt to give this to the cat as a treat a couple times a week, but she won't even touch it. I tried mixing her regular dry food into it to give it some texture, and she just ate the dry food around it. I am not sure if this is just a textual preference for my cat or if it is this particular cat food.

review/summary: The best
review/text: I have tried every "good" cat food on the market.  My babies only would eat the dorito's of the cat food market, F**** F****.  Usually chicken sometimes turkey sometimes beef, sometimes I would have to go thru all three flavors until they honored me with eating.... I know, I am a mess.  The two adult babies (6lbs and 17lbs) would eat 4-5 cans a day with dry also available.  The poo was horrible smelling.<br /><br />Wally world was clearing this out one day so I bought a couple cans.  OMG they both scarfed it down.  I went back to get the rest but it was gone.  No longer were my babies interested in the bad food.  This is shocking since I had tried everything after the pet food debacle a few years ago (even tried the frozen meat) and they wouldn't eat anything else.  I only use one of the larger cans a day and their poo smell has drastically lessened.<br /><br />I cant get this local so am thrilled to find it here with free shipping.  I LOVE Amazon, anything I need I come here first and what is better than having your purchases delivered to your door???<br /><br />I cant say your cats will eat this but if they are not hyper picky they should.  (I tried turkey/chicken and no go, has to be chicken rice) And you really DO feed a lot less with this food! I am saving money and getting better food.  YYYEEEEAAAHHHH!

After trying about 8 brands of cat food I finally landed on Newman's Own.  My cat, Souxsie has never looked better and even her vet has remarked how well Souxsie looks and how perky her behavior is.  Souxsie is 18 years old!

review/text: This organic beef is by far my cat's favorite can food.  He gobbles it down instantly, which is not true with any other can cat food I give him.  I don't use this everyday (about every 3 or 4 days) because I like to feed a variety of foods to Butch.  I also feed him dehydrated raw food, but at a separate time from the can.

review/summary: Great food, Great price, and no more food allergies!!!
review/text: My cat had the worst food allergies. The way she dealt with it was by vomiting on an almost daily basis. Getting special foods (i.e. Science Diet or Purina from the veterinarian) didn't help at all. Finally I tried Newman's Own dry food figuring it couldn't be any worse. It worked like a miracle! No more allergies and no more carpet cleaning except the occasional hairball. When my cat got older I started supplementing her dry food with the Newman's Own wet food and she loves it. She's been eating this for several years, same flavor and everything, and she still comes running when she hears the food being prepped. If you want a healthy pet don't look any further than this! It's organic and there isn't a single ingredient that I can't pronounce. That's definitely something I want when I'm feeding my cat.<br /><br />The price through Amazon.com is cheaper than buying in the stores and the cans come well packaged and undamaged. I won't be going to the store for this again. Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: the proof in truly in the pudding (Newman's Own- Chriken formula)
review/text: "Only my hair dresser knows for sure,"  Well I don't know about that, but the folks at Amazon know how much cat food I order (on account), both dry & wet foods.  Before I even offered Newman's Own Organic Chicken & Brown Rice formula to my five cats, I could see the difference.  Upon openind the first can, I was so pleased to see real chicken broth (organic of course). It was clear broth just like boiling chicken on stove top. It was really fresh looking too., So then the real test when offering to the three indoor cats.  All three approved.  I given only small portions at one time, yet my kitties cleaned the bowl, eating right up!  Never, ever do I recall when my kitties have been so accepting of their wet food. I've owned and cared for cats for over 25 years, and this food really impresses me! I now order it via "Subscribe & Save" (Amazon program) and it will be delivered at regular intervals.  The first case was damaged in shipment (3 or 4 cans were damaged so bad that the contents were running and dripping from the carton. I contacted Amazon and they were gracious as usual and are sending a new case for my accomodation. The only concern I have at this time is that this particular formula is "out of stock" and currently not available from Amazon, though it can be purchased from WAG.com.  I also make purchases from WAG.com and though their prices are slightly higher (most of the time), they are also a great company and have a good variety of foods for both Cats & Dogs, as well as other pet items.<br /><br />If you've never read Newman's Own QA report and product description, be sure to do so. I think you'll be impressed. I was.
