review/summary: Amazingly Good!
review/text: Quick breakdown of the Pros and Cons:<br /><br />Pros<br />- Vegan and Gluten Free (both things I was looking for)<br />- Tastes great<br />- No upset stomach, keeping everything "moving," if you know what I mean...<br /><br />Cons<br />- Not enough to constitute a "meal replacement" (only 110 calories per packet)<br />- Expensive<br /><br />I've been drinking Amazon Meal every morning for breakfast for the last two weeks. I mix it up with unsweetened vanilla almond milk (my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0064QW0YI">Original 28oz Blender Bottle Black</a> blends it up wonderfully, but this may not be necessary) and it tastes out-of-this-world. Seriously, I'm usually craving a second one. It has hard gritty/grainy stuff in the powder that gets stuck in your teeth, but otherwise I don't mind the grittiness. My biggest complaint is that this is more of a complement or supplement to a meal, rather than a meal replacement in itself. Lastly, this stuff is *really* expensive; I've looked around on Amazon and found the packets to be the best deal of them all (you would expect the large containers to be... but no). I would definitely recommend this product.

review/summary: Healthy drink, quick, and easy!
review/text: I got this product because I love healthy chocolate drink, and it quick and easy breakfast for me.  I love the taste.  As long as you completely stir or shake it up you won't taste any grassy taste.  I put vanilla almond milk in my drink, and I shake it with the amazing meal cup that I brought at a health store.  I don't put anything extra, I found that adding more milk to it makes it taste even better.  I go by the texture of it when it looks light chocolate milk.  I found it better to use milk than water; it's better to shake than stir, you can stir after you shake it up; put milk in first than packet, that way you probably don't have to stir the leftovers at the bottom.  It's also better to use a cup that has a lid with it.  If you don't like the taste you can always add sugar or just put in blender to add more ingredients.  It is way cheaper to get this on Amazon than places like whole foods.  I feel better in the morning, I been drinking this for two weeks.  My nails grow quicker too.  I like this packet because I can take it anywhere with me, if I need a healthy drink.  Sometimes I get to lazy to make my own chocolate shake so this save me so time.

review/text: This is good quality black tea.  It's organic and biodynamic, meaning it has been grown using natural and environmentally-conscious methods.  This assam is malty and brews to a lovely liquor, making great breakfast tea with cream and sugar.  All in all, a fine representation of the variety.  Store it in a tin or mason jar after opening to preserve freshness.

review/summary: Don't buy this unless you love Splenda
review/text: My wife bought two cans of this "no sugar added" pie filling thinking it would contain, you know, cherries without added sweetener.  I baked the filling into a pie without noticing the teeny "Splenda" symbol down along the bottom edge of the label (see product photo).  To our disappointment we discovered the artificial sweetener on our first bite of pie.  To our tastes, the pie was inedible and we threw it out. Personally, I'd have preferred an actual "no sugar added" filling but even sugar would be better for you than an artificial sweetener.<br /><br />Since Comstock obviously needs to do a better job of labeling it's products, I went to leave them feedback on their website.  Unfortunately, they wanted every bit of my personal contact information (Email, phone and address) in order to do them a favor and provide feedback on their product. Hopefully they get this message.

review/summary: The new recipe Lindt 70% cocoa recipe is bland.
review/text: I have been buying Lindt 70% Cocoa bars for over a decade.  It was the best dark chocolate for the price.  However, the new recipe, as of Fall 2010, lacks the full rich flavor of the original recipe.  It is now bland and too sweet and definitely not work the price any longer.  I bought one bar of the new recipe and won't be buying any more.  I will probably start buying Green & Black's 70% Cocoa bar instead, unless I can find another better 70% cocoa chocolate that costs less than $3 or $4 per bar.

review/summary: The "new recipe" is terrible!
review/text: As another reviewer has noted, Lindt has changed their previously great recipe as of Autumn 2010, and this chocolate now has the texture and taste of bottom-shelf waxy, cheap American dark chocolate.  Not even mediocre American dark chocolate, but BAD American dark chocolate.  It reminded me of the candy you got behind the windows of an Advent Calendar when you were a kid.<br /><br />This is unfortunate, and apparently, this new recipe has been incorporated into all of their dark chocolate with the possible exception of the 85% version.<br /><br />Avoid this, as this is now one of the worst chocolate bars on the market at any cost.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />As of 11/10/2010, I've started to see the regular recipe bars re-appear on shelves.  Hopefully this isn't just old stock, but instead a sign that Lindt got the hint and has reverted to the excellent old recipe.

I would like to add, that after reading the labels carefully, one can clearly see that the new Lindt is manufactured by an American company in New Hampshire, while the old one was manufactured in France and then distributed by that American company. What's pity! -- another great product has been ruined. The change of the recipe and of the production place must be related to the dollar weakness relative to the euro.

review/summary: NOT recommended-new recipe is awful
review/text: I have been a regular consumer of Lindt Excellence 70% cocoa Dark Chocolate bar for years and have recommended it to many people, not only for the wonderful taste and texture, but b/c of the purity of this product (only four ingredients, including natural bourbon vanilla beans that gave it a most delicious flavor). My most recent purchase ... their "new recipe," as stated on the label, was quite a shock to my taste buds. By adding soy lecithin to the recipe, they are now producing a bar that is not only tasteless but has a waxy texture that I find disgusting. I can only conclude that the soy has replaced some of the more costly ingredients, thereby becoming cheaper for Lindt to produce. Apparently, this has happened only since Lindt started producing the bar in the U.S. and the original formula is still in use in France and Canada but they will not ship it to the U.S. I am extremely disappointed in Lindt for this change and will never buy this product again, unless they go back to the original recipe. What a shame that lovers of dark chocolate have lost the opportunity to enjoy this formerly great product. And let me add that you didn't have to be a connoisseur of dark chocolate to know just how great this product was...all it took was one bite!

review/summary: The new formula is a disaster
review/text: I have been addicted to Lindt 70% chocolate bars for a long time.  It was fine European style chocolate with all natural ingredients and the best value for the money around.  However, the last time I purchased one it was labeled "NEW FORMULA" and it was absolutely terrible.  It was mealy and oily like cheap chocolate and much too sweet.  I think they have adapted their recipe to appeal more to the American market, but if I want cheap chocolate I can pay 50 cents at any grocery store around.  I get Lindt so I can experience fine chocolate.  Skip this one.  If you are a die hard dark chocolate fan, get the 85% bar (which as of December 2010 they haven't screwed up yet), but eat it with a cup of your favorite hot beverage to help it melt since the 85% does not melt well without the extra heat.  I am currently on the search for a replacement for my old recipe Lindt bars and wondering why they couldn't learn from history not to mess with a winning product.  (I mean did anyone like New Coke?)  Lindt, if you are reading this GO BACK TO THE OLD FORMULA AT ONCE!!!!!

review/summary: The new recipe is bland plastic-y junk chocolate
review/text: I enjoyed Lindt Excellence 70% as a lunch treat for over ten years. It was a real favorite of mine, and I trusted a company like Lindt to not mess with a 165-year tradition. I was wrong. Lindt seems to be pursuing Hershey (or worse) now, instead of keeping a proud tradition alive. (The recipe has, by the way, only changed for the US market.)<br /><br />Lindt is still calling this Excellence 70% Cocoa (although the tag at the bottom does say "Smooth Dark" instead of "Intense Dark"). But it is a (literally) pale reflection of the original recipe, and an insult to the Lindt tradition. At least when Coca Cola screwed up, it had changed the name to New Coke so it could easily bring back Classic Coke. Lindt is now stuck, by drastically changing the recipe but not changing the name. Those who liked the old recipe have abandoned them with this change, and are not likely to trust them again, and those who like the new recipe will react the same if they change it back. I think this one will be studied in biz schools as a "how not to do it" case.

review/text: As many of the other reviewers have pointed out the new recipe is terrible! I love chocolate, but have always been picky on what actually deserves to be called chocolate. This new 70% bar should not be considered chocolate and Lindt should be embarrassed for selling it with their name attached. I bought three bars of the original before the stock was replaced with the dreaded new recipe. Too bad chocolate doesn't keep well, I would have bought a box! If you like dark, coco tasting chocolate and are not fond of greasy tasteless bars that call themselves chocolate...don't waste your money on the new recipe. I hope Lindt gets the message and brings back the ORIGINAL recipe!

In fact, once I tried it, I returned the 8 I bought on sale locally and exchanged them for the 85% bar.  The 85% is still made in France with the "old recipe" and has no soy lecithin.  Comments about the 70% bar being "greasy" and "plastic" are correct.  But let's be frank... no serious chocolate connoisseur would consider any Lindt bar worthy.  If you're serious about chocolate, look towards Michel Cluizel, Valrhona, Bonnat and others.

It mirrored pretty much what the web site says about the overwhelming positive response.<br /><br />Here's the funny part:  I was in a Lindt store last week and complained about the recipe change.  The sales person said that they've been receiving numerous complaints from previously-happy 70% customers.  And yes, the reason for the change in taste is that the bar is being manufactured in the US now, with a soya emulsifier and less cocoa butter.<br /><br />As I mentioned in my email to Lindt...  I hope they don't have the same PR disaster Coca-Cola had when they "improved" their recipe.

review/summary: Say "no" to the new recipe
review/text: I've read all the reviews of this product and I feel I must add my name to the chorus of negative reviews on the new recipe.  I can't express how disappointed I was with the new recipe.  I started eating dark chocolate about 12 years ago.  I started with sharffen berger which is quite good chocolate.  I tried various brands.  I wanted the healthy dark but wasn't interested in eating 85% because I wanted to balance flavor with health.  That is where the old recipe of this 70% bar was perfect at.  It tasted better than the Sharffen berger to me and every other bar I had tried.  Now they take this wonderful bar and ruin it for poorly thought out reasons.  I still had a bar of the old when the new came out and I did a blind taste test in my family of four.  All thought the old was better than the new.  So Lindt's marketing machine is doing itself a great disservice by continuing to perpetuate the lie that most people actually like the new recipe.  Note that in my grocery store I can still find the 1.2 oz bars as of August 2011 that are labeled Intense dark.  These bars are still made in france and have no soy products in them (although they say it may contain "traces" of soy beans but all chocolate products say that due to the factory environment in which they are made).<br /><br />For me at least money is no object for this purchase and I'm not rich.  Just trying to prioritize good food over other things in my life.  I would gladly pay the higher price if the exchange rate was the issue or if the ingredients were the issue.  The bottom line is the new recipe is horrible.  Don't purchase if you like chocolate.  If you like wax just buy a candle and eat that.

review/text: This used to be about the greatest thing you could buy for less than $50. Really. What other product could you purchase and credibly say, "this is the best in the world"? Lindt 70 actually became difficult to find at the grocery stores I go to because the secret was clearly out. Now there's plenty, so Lindt screwed up the bottom line as well as on purist grounds. And for those of us with soy allergies, the change is of course a disaster, as it's practically impossible to locate chocolate or any other dessert without some form of soy. I'll spare the reader a review of the new recipe. Why bother? It tastes like every other mediocre or worse dark bar out there: waxy, non-descript, and let's face it, a little too "American," like American cheese is "American."<br />What should we do? A great gourmet store in Ellsworth, Maine (Rooster Brother)has the right idea. I hear the owner took one bite of the new recipe and sent the entire shipment back to Lindt. Perhaps other suppliers will take up the cause. Meanwhile, here's hoping that somebody at Lindt actually cares enough about quality and distinction to put the good old stuff back into production.<br />P.S. Amazon should change the image associated w/this to reflect the New Recipe packaging, lest people think we're dissing the old stuff.

review/summary: Another Blunder in the Name of Marketing
review/text: I could not believe the first time I bit into the new recipe (and did not notice the "new recipe" on the packaging) - what a shock! Lindt, by far, had the best dark chocolate on the market in their 70% bar - I try all dark chocolate I can find and have been buying Lindt for several years now (Green and Black's 70% now is my preference). Someone in Marketing should be removed - they even lied when I asked about responses, the first person answering the phone said it had been overwhelmingly negative, Marketing was my next stop where they said it was positive. I only hope someone wakes up at Lindt....

review/summary: Just what were they thinking?!
review/text: For years this was my go-to bar providing quality, character, value, availability.  Don't misunderstand, I'm not suggesting that it was ever something more than it was but the bottom line is that whether you are a chocolate snob or a casual chocolate lover, you knew that this was simply excellent chocolate for the price.  Nearly boutique chocolate level flavor that you could pick up for half the price.<br /><br />But to my shock the new recipe is simply garbage. Mundane, flat, lacking any punch. What the !@#% was Lindt thinking?  I, along with many others, will have to seek a new replacement for a serviceable bar that the Lindt 70% so faithfully provided for years.  Lindt, shame on you.  You lost a good percentage of your loyal base...and all for what? Sadly nothing, because its not as if this new formula will appeal to a 'broader audience'--it will not.

review/summary: Imitation of a BAD dark chocolate
review/text: "New Recipe" turns out to be an imitation of a bad dark chocolate. When I opened the package, I was not struck with the aroma of good bittersweet chocolate. When a piece hit my tongue, it conjured up memories of awful aftertastes of many bad milk and some dark chocolate. The nasty aftertaste never actually materialized. Still, Lindt should be worried.<br /><br />So I looked at the ingredients. First on the list is chocolate, some unknown, pre-made chocolate. Shouldn't the first ingredient be cocoa powder or cocoa something? Lindt started making chocolate in China some time ago. Are they churning out this "New Recipe" with "Made-In-China" chocolate, sugar, cocoa butter and so on? By the way, the 85% cocoa bar's ingredient list also starts with chocolate, followed by cocoa powder, sugar... At least it contains enough cocoa powder to fool me for a while. I suppose it could be worse: Lindt could have substituted partially hydrogenated junk for cocoa butter.<br /><br />I just bought Trader Joe's Swiss 72% cocoa Dark Chocolate for $1.99. It smells and tastes right for me. Its color is just a shade lighter than Lindt 70%. Ingredients: cocoa mass, sugar, cocoa butter, soy lecithin, Madagascar vanilla. I can see myself sticking with this one until something better shows up or returns.

review/text: It's really too bad there isn't an option to give 0 stars, or even better in a case like this, negative stars.  I almost never do reviews on products, but I, like so many loyal and long term addicts of the 70% bar am shocked at what Lindt has done.  The new recipe is basically the same thing as those terrible Ghirardelli squares of waxy tasteless "chocolate".  The original 70% was amazing.  It had a great texture, just enough sweet to balance things out, and there was no mistaking the cocoa.  It was also always a bit of a surprise every time I would eat it.  Sometimes it had hints of citrus, sometimes it was a bit nutty.  Maybe that was the vanilla, but whatever it was, there is nothing about the new recipe that even comes close to anything I used to enjoy about the 70% bar.  Now I have to try and find a replacement for what used to be the perfect chocolate experience.  Thanks for nothing Lindt.

Only to have it swept off the shelves and replaced with a disgusting 'new recipe' that reminded me of chocolate I bought on sale at a dollar store once. One of the other reviewers said 'waxy and tasteless' and that about sums it up. Plus, I find it insulting that they would trumpet NEW RECIPE!! on the box, and expect the consumer to assume that it was improved, as opposed to ruined.<br /><br />Lindt-- Charge more, I don't care, but don't sacrifice the quality of your products.

review/summary: 2010 "new recipe" is bland and disappointing
review/text: Here's the email I wrote to the Lindt company after my first taste of the "new" version:<br /><br />Hello,<br />I have loved your 70% Excellence bar since I first discovered it 3 years ago. The slight tang of fruity notes was very unique and simply delightful. Also - knowing that only the highest quality chocolate is made with enough cocoa butter to preclude the need for soy lecithin, I was impressed that your 70% Excellence bar was soy-free. Like many other Americans, I typically avoid soy for health reasons.<br /><br />However, your new version of the 70% Excellence bar is entirely a disappointment. Its bland flavor is not disagreeable but it certainly lacks the character of your previous recipe. And I see that the quality of ingredients has also been sacrificed - the 70% bar now contains soy lecithin. This chocolate no longer stands out from any other chocolate available on store shelves.<br /><br />I will now be buying my chocolate from a different company. But if at some future time you decide to resume your previous version of the 70% Excellence bar, I will be pleased to buy from Lindt again.

I wouldn't have wanted to eat any more of that stuff.  It is, indeed, awful.  Completely bland and very waxy: the taste and texture are BOTH horrible.  I find it impossible to believe that a whole company that produces chocolate for a living could imagine that this is a good product, so all I can assume is that they, too, must know that it really sucks.  How can they sleep at night knowing that they are producing such horribly pathetic chocolate?  Thank goodness I didn't pay anything for this woefully sub-par sample!!

review/text: I have to agree with most of the other reviews, except I don't find it bad enough to give it only one star ...I've tasted many chocolates that are worse. The new recipe (made in U.S.A.) Lindt 70% has lost all the qualities that makes the original great. The new version is overly sweet and creamy, with noticeably less cocoa flavor ...hard to differentiate it from most cheap chocolates.<br /><br />But the original made in France version (still available in Canada as of early 2012) is one of the best easy-to-find 70% chocolates. It has a stronger and more complex cocoa flavor, with nice hints of bitterness, smokyness, and vanilla. And a nice dry texture - not the yucky, slippery sweetness and creamyness of the new 'improved' recipe.

review/text: You get what you pay for with chocolate.  I buy Lindt chocolate to serve to guests occasionally, but it's a really poor cheap chocolate.  On a scale of 1-10 (10 being the best) Lindt would rate in the 2-3 range. If you really want a GREAT chocolate that has the full flavor and fine chocolate nuances, you'd have to spend three or four times as much.  I would recommend Amano Artisan Chocolate, for example.  Truly excellent.  Just a warning, however: once you taste a high-end chocolate like Amano, you will never like Lindt again.  In fact, you might just spit it out.

I have a bunch of hot sauces way hotter and a bottle of 1,000,000 scoville unit capcacin extract that made everyone that tried it totally light up in pain. Now that's what a ghost chili is supposed to do.

review/text: From reading some other reviews about these sorts of dried peppers I was prepared for them to be something special, but they are not.<br /><br />They are fine, but they are not specially hot nor do they have any special flavor.<br /><br />Luckily for me, most of the time I can get fresh habaneros. I got these as a back up.<br /><br />I normally have 3-5 fresh habaneros in a meal and in comparison I figure that one of these is maybe in hotness about the same as 2 small to medium sized fresh habaneros.<br /><br />I noticed no special flavor at all with these peppers.<br /><br />I ground them up to flakes before I used them, and some of the bigger flakes made them stand out a bit, but I want my hotness spread throughout the meal so I always chop fresh habaneros or grind or chop up dried hot peppers.<br /><br />I am sure if you chewed up a fistful of them you would get a fierce blast, but you could get that from a fistful of fresh habaneros as well. It seems they are maybe 2x as hot as a decent habanero.<br /><br />As a good back up dried pepper to have when you don't have access to fresh hot peppers, these are fine.<br /><br />Don't be fooled into thinking they are some kind of miracle pepper, however.

But, to my surprise, it arrived two business days later, (faster than the unrelated item I purchased off Amazon the same day, that I paid two day shipping for).  It arrived in a heat sealed bag, and is also resealable to keep it dry.  The quality of the citric acid is as good as any other I've received.  I use it to make frozen sour pops for my kids, and they came out as good as always. I am very pleased with my purchase and would definitely use this seller in the future.

review/summary: Purchased for Cosmetic Use
review/text: I use citric acid for my hair. I've started shampooing my hair with Borax disolved in water. A citric acid rinse is necessary to remove all the traces of Borax. In addition, it has been an excellent addition to my henna. I add it to distilled water prior to mixing it with my preffered brand of henna. It makes a smoother yet sticky paste which adheres to my hair much better than just plain water and henna powder. So far, I'm loving the additiion of citric acid to my hair care regimen.

review/summary: Delicious and easy
review/text: This is a very tasty soup indeed, and it makes a LOT- at least 6-8 hearty meals, made according to the directions, and more if one added corn or another vegetable to it (corn or lightly cooked onions would be good; it could also handle something like roasted poblano peppers).<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the expense. This is not at all a complete kit for this soup! You will need to add a pound of hot sausage, a whole chicken breast (boned and skinned), a large can of diced tomatoes, and 6 cups of chicken stock, in addition to whatever extra veg you might like.<br /><br />Still, once you've done this- it's delicious.<br /><br />Note that it's also not fast, at least in elapsed time. After soaking the chickpeas overnight, they simmer for 2 hours; then you saute the meats, add the rest of the stuff, and cook an additional 1.5-2 hours. This cooking time is hands-off, but it does require planning ahead.<br /><br />The result, though is really good. Definitely homemade-tasting; the seasonings are excellent; and the ease of making is wonderful.<br /><br />I used hot italian sausage since that's what I had, but I think the recommended chorizo would be even better. One could probably also skip the chicken and add some rice for a complete protein with the chickpeas.<br /><br />This- and many of their other kits- are gluten free- something that makes them attractive to me. While I'm not GF myself, many of my friends and family are, and these would make a nice casual dinner for them!<br /><br />And hey- even with what it costs- it's cheaper than fast food or a restaurant! and much more tasty.<br /><br />I do like these soup kits. I';ve tried several now, and they've all been yummy- though this is the best one so far.

review/text: Great taste and crunch, but I feel these have too much sugar (even if Kashi calls it dehydrated cane juice...that is sugar).  I guess I am just used to eating less sweat cereal, but my first bite of the cereal made me pick up the box again and see what was in it.  Organic and all that too, for what it is worth.  Kellogg's Unfrosted Mini Wheats have no added sugar (1g of sugar in a 59g serving) whereas the Kashi has 7g of sugar in a 54g serving.

review/text: I absolutely detest shredded wheat type cereals. My husband however, enjoys those types of cereals. He decided to try out the Kashi Autumn Wheat, and I have to admit, after years of calling shredded wheat or granola type foods, horse food, I had to take it back for this one. I find I eat this mostly as my night snack. It is very very crunchy and contains a slightly sweet taste that's very pleasing to the palette.<br /><br />If you've been avoiding the fiber craze because of the taste of most of those products, give this one a try - you'll be pleasantly surprised.

review/summary: Healthy Organic Shredded Wheat Cereal at great price $
review/text: Tried Kashi Autumn Wheat as an alternitive to the brand name cereal because this is labeled as Non-GMO/Organic.  I was pleasantly surprised that I prefer the Kashi brand so much better!  Not only is it healthier for me it also tastes better.  You get 50 grams of fiber where the recommended daily amount of fiber is 48 grams!  Also, no sodium.  I don't mind the little bit of sugar as I used to add Agave sweetener to the other brand, and don't have to now.<br /><br />The Amazon price is better than my local Safeway where the price is $4.29 per box.  With the current Amazon advertised price for 4 boxes works out to $3.28 per box.  With PRIME I get free shipping to boot!  Good thing too as my husband just discovered that he likes it so we're going through it twice as fast. :)

review/summary: Delicious Frosted Mini Wheats alternative
review/text: I love this cereal. Since I pretty much exclusively eat cereal for breakfast, I wanted to have a modestly healthier alternative to the sugar party that is Frosted Mini Wheats, and other similar cereals. This is not too sweet, nor too bland. And it's great with soy milk.<br /><br />One thing I've noticed, is that the last few "Wheats" in the box are usually pulverized, so you'll probably end up with a loss of about the equivalent of 10 or so units because they were crushed to bits. This is probably a side effect of shipping them.<br /><br />As always, check the expiration date!! I haven't had a spoiled box yet, but you can never be too careful!

review/text: I am just dumbfounded by all the people saying this cereal is too sweet. The only way you can think this is too sweet is if ANY amount of sweetness is too much for you. I'm not sure if the amount of sugar was lessened at some point, but as it is now, it's really not that sweet. It has 7g of sugar, and while I wouldn't call that unsweetened, it is a pretty modest amount. It's nowhere near as sweet as Mini Wheats, for example.<br /><br />All in all, good cereal! I would buy it again.

review/text: This Autumn Wheat variant of Kashi cereal is as addictive as Kashi Golean Crunch.<br /><br />Ideally, you would have a cup of this with organic milk for breakfast. But when I get the munchies any time of the day, instead of reaching for nachos or candy, I grab this and just consume it dry -- one wheat square at a time.<br /><br />Since it's ORGANIC and WHOLE GRAIN and NATURALLY SWEETENED with cane juice, I feel so guiltless that it's not uncommon for me to go through half the bag before I admit to being a bad, bad girl. But really, it's that good.<br /><br />The reason for four instead of five stars is that deep down I know that plain old oatmeal without addictive properties is still more healthful.

Not Amazon's doing, but they should update the product description to reflect the new size.

review/text: I first bought this delicious cereal at Trader Joes because it had a Recycle Bank code on it, though even if it wasn't for that, I'd still be eating this cereal. Amazing nutrition, including more fiber than a lot of TV Dinners have, a taste quite similar to Frosted Mini Wheats, and one of the most natural cereals on the market. Even better, is that while the majority of cereals have GMOs(Genetically Modified Organisms) this one doesn't.

review/text: I didn't expect this cereal to be sweet.  It has the same chew as shredded wheat but is pleasantly sweet - almost too sweet but not quite.  I counted the number of "biscuits" I put in my bowl and there were 35, so I ended up with probably 8 grams of protein, not counting the milk, and lots of fiber.  I was really happy to find another cereal for about 200 calories for a reasonably-sized bowl that I could enjoy in the mornings.

review/text: So as cereals go, this is one of my favorite.  I'm usually a weetabix person or just plain oatmeal but i'm been eating this stuff recently.  I mean it does have 7g of sugar, but 5g of protein and 6g of fiber sounds pretty balanced to me.  At 190 calories it's perfect for my morning breakfast before running or going to the gym.  I mean if you need it sweeter, just add honey or maple syrup.<br /><br />But if you want a little more flavor than weetabix and are too lazy to put the toppings on weetabix, get this stuff.  You won't get diabetes eating this and it's good.  It's a big box too.  And if it really means anything to you it's organic...<br /><br />To those that say it's too sweet.... do you eat cardboard for breakfast?  Come on, you guys must not eat anything sweet at all.<br /><br />But most of all it's cheaper on amazon

review/summary: Organic Goodness
review/text: Kashi cereals have become a pantry staple in the past couple of years, and Autumn Wheat is one of my newest additions. It tastes great, and has a good texture - not so dense that it won't soften in milk, but not so fluffy that it dissolves. The pieces are bite-sized, so they'd make a good crunchy, dry snack too.<br /><br />The fact that it's all organic and sweetened with natural cane sugar is a great bonus. It provides 6 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein - all with only 7 grams of sugar - a little less than 2 teaspoons. That's about as sweet as I like my cereal, so I think it's perfect. (I prefer my cereals plain and not very sugary.) If you like more sweetness, I'd recommend the Cinnamon Harvest flavor of this cereal.

I tend to avoid any sweetened cereals but I like the light amount of sweetness in this cereal.  I prefer this version over the Kashi Cinnamon Harvest, which was still excellent but a little too "cinnamony" for me.<br /><br />This Kashi cereal is organic and is a great option compared to the standard brands for shredded wheat and frosted mini wheat cereals.  It tastes better than plain shredded wheat.  It is a healthier option with 7 g sugars compared to 12 g sugars in frosted mini wheats and those contain ingredients I am trying to avoid like high fructose corn syrup and gelatin.

review/text: I have always been a big fan of MiniWheats, but one of my medical providers pointed out that foods that contain tyramine often trigger migraines. They suggested switching to an organic diet, and Autumn Wheat was the cereal I chose. It was so much better than MiniWheats that I have never even missed my old stand-by. I am not sure it has helped reduce the migraines at all, but it has certainly left me with a happy palate.<br />That said, the Amazon price for the product is, like most of their other grocery prices, grossly exorbitant. You can find it at nearly any grocery store for much less.

review/summary: Best Chai to date
review/text: This is probably the best loose leaf masala chai  I have tasted in the US (outside of an authentic Asian restaurant). I dont often write reviews, but if you've ever had real masala chai (and not the syrup stuff they sell in Starbucks et. al. coffe shops) you'll love this stuff ... inexpensive, high quality ... beats Teaism hands down ... I just ordered more, and I'll keep ordering more ... if you're British/European, and you're looking for a nice black tea ... this is the one xxx!

review/summary: Mouth Kicker!
review/text: Say what you will about Mint Mentos but they are a mouth kicker. The moment I log one in, the flavor is a force of nature. I like them a lot and probably they deserve a little higher score but for now I am giving it 4 solid and well deserved stars, which by the way, makes them above average as a product. I was thinking how nice it would be to have the same mints on a sugar free concept, like splenda perhaps, and imagine, if only for a second if they would add something that is good for the teeth, like some chewing gum company does, something that kills bacteria. I thing I would go nutty for that to happen for I like the whole thing about these mints excepting the fact that I wonder how much are they taxing my soon to be examined by a dentist, faithful teeth.  I done them both ways. One where I just chew happily until they disappear completely and after the initial burst of mint on the outer layer there is still pockets of the flavor all the way till they are gone, if not as strong as when you begin. The other, and the more persistent of my methods, is pop them in the chambers and bite as soon as possible and wipe them out that way. That is why I was thinking how much safer it would be to do that, even if it was not completely true, with the vague knowledge that they might be good for your teeth in the long run. I do not think I would be able to stop myself then, from eating them in larger quantities.<br />I open a package and at the most it will last for two days but chances are that in one day the deed will be done. They are so easy to eat and they do bring that extra minty flavor. I read somewhere that Mentos is developing a sugar free version and I was tempted to call the company, hopefully talk to a higher up under the excuse that I have a million dollar idea I would like to give them for free and that idea would be: How about adding Xylitol to the sugar free mint mentos and advertise it like a healthy alternative to damaging candy, besides a fine bad breath deterrent, which by the way it is already. Come On! I would sell, break out of the pack and make the mints the ultimate healthy sweet!<br />Do forgive my outburst, I am probably a little too demanding sometimes, but like the song goes: wouldnt it be nice (Beach Boys?) I can not stop liking these Mentos. I have tried their whole line up and these keep reigning supreme. So much in fact that I purchased the Mentos Mint Candy, 6-Roll Packages (Pack of 12) right after I had purchased the lesser priced one that delivers 30 rolls. Well this one delivers 72? Yes, that is exactly what I am talking about. Put your money where your mouth is specially if it is a minty sensation mouth kicker. 4 Happy Stars going on 4.5, right about now!

review/text: I just love these mints. Being able to buy them cheaper than I can get them locally was just great. They are quite fresh and I don't have to worry about running out when I have a craving for them.

review/summary: Same prize,  but10% less
review/text: 5 star for the product, but 1 star for the sneaky price increase means 2.5 stars. I subscribe and get it regularly, but noticed how thin the packages appeared the last shipment, but the price was the same as previous deliveries so I assumed I got the same as before. It turned out that the size of the package was reduced from 305g to 264 gram, 10% less for the same price. I don't mind paying more for a good  product, but not in this way.
