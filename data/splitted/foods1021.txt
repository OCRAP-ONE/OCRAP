review/summary: Husband thinks this tea is GREAT!
review/text: Each holiday season, Costco gives out samples of this tea and it is available for purchase.  This was so disappointing for my husband when we ran out of the tea and it was off season for Costco.  So, I went online to search for it.  FANTASTIC, I found it on AMAZON.  We now have this tea in our home year round and I have a very happy husband.  It is not that he drinks it daily, but frequently.  This is a spicy, sweet tea with a Holiday aroma.  And it is caffeine and sugar free making it a pleasurable evening drink for a diabetic, well, for anyone really.  I hope you enjoy it as  much as we do.

review/summary: Great Iced as well as hot
review/text: This is my very favorite tea. Not only is is great hot in the winter, but it's great as an iced tea in the summer as well. As it's been said it's definitely "sweet and spicy". You can taste the cinnamon in it and the rose hips make it naturally sweet. Really a wonderful flavor. And, with the caffeine free variety, you don't have to worry that making it very strong is going to be a problem. I love to make gallon jars of sun tea with it and make it strong so that the ice doesn't water it down.

review/text: I bought this brand to try out and while it's a bit cheaper than the rooster brand it can't hold a candle to it. This product has a decent amount of heat but it's definitely missing that "something-something" and it has more vinegar and garlic without enough sweet to compliment it.<br /><br />One thing I did to fix this is I made a simple sugar syrup (sugar/water) and added it which helped but it still can't hold a candle to my favorite sriracha brand. Oh well.

review/summary: The Last Word in Over the Counter Red Table Salsa
review/text: In a world filled with a crazy assortment of chipotle, corn, mango, ghost habanero, and raspberry tainted hot sauces, it is reassuring to find Hell on the Red Party Dip on the shelf at your local grocer.  This stuff is so good, it gives you a sense of superiority when you push past the indecisive masses and head directly for its simply designed jar.  And, like the jar, there is no fancy stuff here.  The ingredients on the label are: tomato, onion, jalapeno (includes carrot, onion, vinegar, salt, spices), red pepper, water, garlic, salt, citric acid, and sugar.  This is the only hot sauce I have ever tried that even comes close to restaurant grade salsa.  It even surpasses the red sauce at the vast majority of tex-mex establishments I have been to (and I live in Houston, Texas which is arguably the tex-mex capital of the world).  It's not too chunky and not too runny and it tastes real and fresh, not like it was made to have a post-apocalyptic shelf life.  There is no great disparity between their "mild" and their "hot" and, if the store is out of mild, I will grab the hot.  I prefer to eat mine chilled on corn chips and I can eat a whole jar in one sitting, no problem.  The stuff is addictive.  In the twenty years I've been eating Hell on the Red, I've gone through literally thousands of jars of this consistently high quality and unfalteringly replicated salsa.  WARNING: If you judge your hot sauce only on the heat, look elsewhere.  Hell on the Red is not some childish novelty product designed to be eaten only on a dare.  This is salsa that is made to taste elegantly sublime.  And it does.

Sort of reminiscent of Xochitl but not as expensive.<br /><br />I know somebody said this stuff is hot, its not. Some people think everthing is hot fer<br />crying out loud, but it is much better than Pace or all the other stuff you'll find at<br />the grocery that people think passes for Salsa.

review/summary: Freshly picked apples?!?
review/text: I haven't been a huge fan of apple sauce since I was a kid, having grown tired of just "so-so" taste that just didn't taste a whole lot like real apples (all I've ever had is the usual grocery store varieties of apple sauce - not bad, but I could take it or leave it).  I decided to try these for snacks.  WOW!  They literally taste like fresh-picked, ripe apples that were quickly turned into apple sauce and served.  We now keep some of these in the refrigerator so there will always be some cold applesauce (though I suspect room temperature would be fine with this product also - just haven't tried it at room temperature).<br /><br />I was unprepared for just how good this apple sauce is - it really does taste like fresh apples.  What more can you ask for?  I reserve 5-star ratings for those products I consider to be way beyond "average" or even "very good."  This product is top notch.

review/text: I already knew what to expect when it came to taste... My family loves the thick, creamy, just sweet enough Silk Almond Vanilla.  But, when it comes to ordering, I feel like I was tricked a little -- hence the 4 stars rather than 5.  The picture implies that you would receive a half-gallon size, whereas when you read, you see that it says 6-32oz. cartons (Quart size).  I didn't read when I ordered, I was in a rush, and after receiving my package, quite timely I might add, I was a little confused.  I had to go back and look at it, and read!! So, the picture does NOT match the product you will receive, just be aware!! Otherwise, it's just as perfect a product as you could ask for.

It is very low in calories and almond milk itself has a host of benefits. Unlike the unhealthy soy products, almond milk does not contain any natural plant estrogen so it will not give men breasts and it will not mess with a woman's time of the month.<br /><br />One note as has been said by another reviewer - the picture of the product is wrong. You actually get the 32 ounce aseptic rectangle containers, not the pictured ones.

review/summary: not as picture shows
review/text: I feel like I was tricked a little -- hence the 4 stars rather than 5. The picture implies that you would receive a half-gallon size, whereas when you read, you see that it says 6-32oz. cartons (Quart size). I didn't read when I ordered, I was in a rush, and after receiving my package, quite timely I might add, I was a little confused. I had to go back and look at it, and read!! So, the picture does NOT match the product you will receive, just be aware!! Otherwise, it's just as perfect a product as you could ask for.

review/text: My husband loved this for Christmas. He loves to grill and loves his seasonings. We just recently started by sea salt versus regular salt and really like the way it seasons food more thoroughly. This smoked sea salt I think would be more for fish after tasting it but this company has many other flavors for a variety of meats and vegetables.

Every summer I would return to Pittsburgh and my Pappap would have a box of Torrone candy waiting for me. He would even send it to us in the mail.  My Pappap died over 25 years ago and I miss him very much.  I have not been able to find this candy here in Atlanta.  I am ordering several boxes.  I am not a big fan of chocolate.  This candy is perfect if your in need of something sweet.

review/summary: Low Glycemic Index snack w/lots of protein - good for Hypoglycemics AND Diabetics
review/text: My wife has been buying the 28 ounce bags if this very simple but brilliant conceived product.  The only ingredients seem to be Roasted Almonds a very light amount of sea salt and barely enough to taste it Evaporated Cane Juice crystals.  The Roasted almonds seem to be dusted with the small amounts of salt and sugar and then put into a press and dried until they are one big sheet of uniform thickeness which is then cut to uniform size with really sharp industrial size blades.  If you count each square and only eat the # of sqaures that = 1 serving, you won't get fat and the leftover bits in the bottom make a nice addition to whole grain hot cereals or to homemade chex mix.  My wife eats this stuff as a filling, protein & fiber rich snack or even as part of her lunch with fruit and  a salad of dark greens & veggies.  It doesn't spike her blood sugar ( she has to watch hers since it swings very low and very high).  Also, when she's feeling a low blood sugar headache coming on, she reaches into her purse and eats either half or a whole a serving of this  very vasic snack with some water for fast relief.<br /><br />The genius is in the uniformity of the squares for portion control.  If you count them  and only eat 6 generously sized pieces, you will only get  156 calories, 3 grams of sugar and  5 et carbs when you subtract the fiber (fiber has to be listed as a carb by law).  Once you get used to the amount,  you can figure out how much of the fallen odd bits in the bottom equal 1 serving or do what we do and toss it in with some non-sugar ceareal and a little bit of Cinnamon toast crunch so the kids will have a "sweet Snack" that ain't actually as sweet as they imagine it is!  (we're sneaky parents! oh noes!)  To get this "semi-sweet sback mix," we mix 2/3'rds  wheat chex & generic rice krisps with 1/3 Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal, shake that up with the leftover broken off bits of toasted almonds from 2 large bags of Mr's Mays Almond crunch, right inside the Mr.s May's Re-sealable bags,  and we get a nice snack we can dole out in 1 cup servings.  You can stretch this mix even further by adding air-popped popcorn and handing it out in kid decorated "popcorn bags" made from grocery store bags and have a nice family movie night complete with a less sinful snack.  Just be sure and scoop up from the bottom to get some of those heart-healthy almonds in your "portion" since the almonds have a way of hading at the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />I realize I sound a lot like "Mr. Snack Hacker" here on Amazon but in these times of rising food prices it would be shameful to let any part of a healthy snack go to waste and often times just by mixing up something new from something they've had before can re-interest kids in a healthy snack.  If being creative is what it takes to prevent food waste, I'm proud to be a Snack Hacker!

review/text: My son cannot eat gluten and was heartbroken at the thought of giving up his mac and cheese. I absolutely love the tinkyada line of pastas. I've tried many different gluten free pastas and this one comes the closes to the feel of the real thing. The fact that it is made with brown rice also makes it more rich in fiber than the white rice pastas.<br /><br />It does take a long time to cook - between 15 to 16 minutes -but it is well worth the wait.<br /><br />I have also served this with red sauce and they do fine there too. The pasta does not get mushy or have any strange flavors when it cools (we had a real issue with that when we tried Quinoa pasta). Definitely worth a try if you cannot eat gluten.

review/text: I bought this at the local Asian market, sat down on a rainy weekday to watch Garden of the Finzi Continis and was instantly mesmerized by its freshness, seaweedy taste, and the whole harmony of that moment.  I couldn't get enough of it- I drank 6-8 cups a day for a month.  It's just a great complement to anything that you've eaten.  I bought the Sencha Special Grade from Upton Tea, thinking it must be better than this since it's twice as expensive, but the Yamamotoyama is a shade better for my taste.  I can never go back to tea bags, especially tasteless brands like  Bigelows or Tazo.  I don't mind some black tea bags, but not the fannings they use in green tea bags.  Green tea has got to be one of the best things in life.

review/summary: My favorite green tea!
review/text: The pouch is vacuum sealed and holds about 100gms of delicate, deep-emerald, leaves. I use about a tsp for a 12-16oz cup. It is very important to avoid using boiling water if you want to get the full benefits and flavor of this tea. Water at a rolling boil will overcook the tea and you will notice that the tea quickly turns brown in the cup. If you adhere to directions and use water at 80 deg. C., you will be left with a wonderful cup of GREEN tea that stays green. I absolutely love the fresh, grassy flavor of this tea and it is a wonderful pick-me-up. The first sip of this tea leaves a distinctly sweet note on the tongue even though there is no actual sugar in the tea! I have spent hundreds on different teas, but I keep returning to this one as my staple.

review/summary: excellent quality green tea
review/text: I have consumed two bags of this green tea.  It is an excellent quality tea, balanced in flavor and balanced in terms of the sense of well-being it imparts to the imbiber.  It helps me to concentrate better and helps to even out my moods.  It feels like a good detoxifier to take after eating a meal with a lot of saturated fats or meat, partly because of its anti-inflammatory effects.  It has less caffeine than regular tea or coffee.  Just enough caffeine to give a slight elevation of mood, but not enough to cause one to hyper-concentrate and feel mood swings.  Of course, this tea consists of loose leaves and twigs, and not tea bags.  This is an important concept.  In a typical supermarket, the tea comes in bags and has too much caffeine and is overly processed, which reduces its nutritional value dramatically.  In general, green tea bought from a popular brand in a supermarket does not contribute to the reputation for health that green tea has.  This kind of green tea that is in the natural form is the only kind that does.  I brew it by microwaving water to boiling, then letting the water cool for a couple minutes while stirring it with a spoon to agitate out any oxygen dissolved in the water.  Then put a heaping teaspoon of the tea in it and let it sit for 3-4 minutes.  Very hot but not boiling water is the key.  You will likely find that consuming natural forms of green tea like this one, raw and unroasted, is far superior to drinking most popular brands of tea from the supermarket, or to drinking coffee.

review/text: I don't normally write reviews, but my enjoyment of tea compels me. As someone who has been shifting more and more from bagged tea to loose leaf and delving deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole of tea appreciation, I stumbled upon this item.<br /><br />Having browsed numerous tea shops and gotten a feel for the price of quality tea vs. standard vs. tea dust/fanning, the price on this seemed a bit low for what it claimed. Even so, I wanted a green tea I could have every day, and this had the quantity necessary.<br /><br />So I brewed a cup, and come to find out, this stuff is pretty decent! It did everything I could have asked it to do, and graciously allowed me to infuse it a couple more times. Definitely a tea I could appreciate daily, especially for the price I paid.<br /><br />If you're looking for a quality cup for a low price, give this tea a try, you could do far far worse.

Once we got the cookie packages out of the huge outer box, pushing aside all the bags of air, and then grabbing the inner box (what would be shipped to a supermarket), we found that we had some darned tasty cookies.  Real chocolate chips and a generous amount per cookie, enough to say that it would be tough to take a bite of cokie without getting a chip.  The batter holding things together was good, without nuts or any strong flavoring that would keep it from overpowering the taste of the chocolate.  Nicely crunchy,  as is normal for box cookies.  No one will ever mistake these for homemade, but they are pretty good for packaged cookies.

review/summary: Great Tasting
review/text: Since this seems to be a main concern, I thought I would start with saying that all packages of cookies arrived intact along with a lot of other items I had ordered. Now on to the cookies themselves, they are very good tasting cookies. These taste like real chocolate chip cookies that crumble in your mouth and chocolate in every bite. The flavoring is great for packaged cookie. Yes, I would rather have a cookie home baked and out of the oven. But I will buy these again. I would recommend them for when you just don't feel like baking. For its price, it is the best chocolate chip cookie so far I have had shipped to the house.

review/summary: Chocolate Chip Coconut Cookies not so yummy - but Amazon was great!
review/text: I finally found my most favorite cookies through a dealer on Amazon.  After waiting nearly 4 weeks for them to arrive I finally contacted Amazon to let them know that I still had not received the cookies I ordered.  Two days later the cookies arrived - where they went before reaching me is still a mystery.  But I was happy to finally have them as I can't get them in Southern California.  The minimum order was 4 packages and that was okay, I would freeze some for later.  Much to my dismay the supplier just put the four bags of cookies and a box with NO packing to protect them.  So you guessed it....almost all of the cookies were broken into crumbs:  And to top it off the cookies "best if eaten by date" was only 2 days after I received them!  Needless to say these must have been sitting in a warehouse for quite some time.  After contacting Amazon I was able to get a refund for my crushed cookies.  Oh well, maybe I will try again by ordering with Amazon through a different vendor. Thank you Amazon - you were great.

review/summary: Superior to Chips Ahoy!
review/text: I used to buy Chips Ahoy! brand cookies at the store once in a while because they were my favorite cookie from childhood. It had been years since I even tried a Keebler brand cookie and one day I found them on sale. I found that Keebler Chips Deluxe originals are thicker, fresher, more crumbly (although very few if any were broken in the package), and overall much more melt-in-your-mouth delicious than Chips Ahoy! originals which were thinner, a little harder, and almost a bit stale-tasting. If I remember correctly, the Chips Deluxe cookies package has 2 ounces more in it. I've never been a fan of the soft batch.

review/text: The "Soft 'n Chewy" Chips Deluxe cookies are highly underrated. Often overshadowed by Chips Ahoy's Chewy Cookies in marketing and sales, "Soft 'n Chewy" cookies from Chips Deluxe are worth trying if you enjoy cookies that are, well, soft and chewy. I would say these are just as delicious as Chewy Chips Ahoy cookies, but they are also thicker and usually cheaper. Pick one up today and the people in the house with sweet tooths will gobble them up quickly.

I understand this is probably due to poor packaging.  The consistency was a bit grainy and dry though.  And milk did not help.  Next time I'll purchase a chewy brand or Mrs. Fields.

review/summary: 1 gram of trans-fat per 16 grams of cookie!
review/text: As of Nov 2007, the Keebler website says that each 16 gram serving contains 1 gram of trans fat!<br /><br />Don't take my word for it that this is terrible, because here are some quotations from the survey article<br /><br />Mozaffarian et al "Trans Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease,"<br />The New England Journal of Medicine, volume 354,<br />pages 1601-1613 (2006).<br /><br />Here are a few quotations from this article:<br /><br />"given the 1.2 million annual myocardial infarctions and deaths from CHD ["coronary heart disease"] in the United States, near-elimination of industrially produced trans fats might avert between 72,000 (6 percent) and 228,000 (19 percent) CHD events [i.e. "heart attacks"] each year. These estimates are based on the replacement of trans fats with carbohydrates. In practice, however, trans fats in partially hydrogenated oils would most commonly be replaced with unhydrogenated (cis) unsaturated fats,6 which may have additional potential benefits as compared with carbohydrates. If such additional potential benefit is considered, greater proportions of CHD events (12 to 22 percent) might be averted."<br /><br />Note that the disproportionate percentage of heart disease attributable to trans-fat is astonishing, since the authors point on on the first page that trans-fat makes up only a tiny proportion of the american diet:<br /><br />"The average consumption of industrially produced trans fatty acids in the United States is 2 to 3 percent of total calories consumed."<br /><br />They conclude<br /><br />"On the basis of evidence from in vitro experimental studies, dietary trials, and prospective observational studies, the consumption of trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated oils provides no apparent nutritional benefit and has considerable potential for harm."<br /><br />Professor Willett (one of the co-authors of the above article) is the chairman of Harvard's nutrition department, the author of the medical school textbook "nutritional epidemiology", and the most-cited author in his field. He has also written about trans-fat for a general audience in his book "Eat, Drink, and be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide for Healthy Eating."

review/summary: This is one of the best hot sauces you can get
review/text: I was first introduced to this sauce about 3 years ago, and it has ever since been a staple in my house.<br /><br />This is a rather mild Habanero sauce showcasing flavor over heat, but the heat is definitely there if you are more sensitive to spicy foods.<br /><br />The flavor of this sauce is a blend of Habaneros, carrots, onions, lime juice and garlic making a balanced "sauce" flavor that does not necessarily showcase the pepper quite as much as other hot sauces.  This is actually what I really like about this sauce because this makes it very useful as a condiment.<br /><br />I have recommended this sauce to everyone I know, and even given (and received) it as gifts.  I can not recommend a sauce any higher, this is a top notch product.

review/summary: Best hot sauce I have ever tasted
review/text: I was introduced to this sauce by my friend's father who brought it back from Belize. We sprinkled it on some bland, grilled chicken breast and I was blown away by the difference it made. When another friend told me he was going on vacation in Belize, I insisted that he bring me back an entire crate of this stuff. It is perfectly balanced in heat, flavor, and saltiness. I've put it on eggs, pho, ramen, pasta, pizza, chicken, rice, burritos, you name it. You can never go back to Frank's Red Hot after tasting this. The only downside is it is quite expensive for a simple hot sauce. The average person might not be able to justify paying so much for hot sauce, but to a connoisseur it is well worth it.

review/summary: Never thought these cute birds were so delicious...
review/text: Being allergic to corn REALLY sucks because there are not that many cereals that don't contain corn in them (heck even plain ol Rice Krispies do... didn't know that did you?). So I am very glad to see Barbara's Bakery able to fulfill this need.<br /><br />The Honey Rice Puffins maintain that perfect balance of being sweet, but not too sweet. Far too many sweetened cereals just go overboard in making them so saccharine it's inedible.<br /><br />They stay very crunchy in milk. My preferred method is to have them with some plain greek yogurt, great breakfast or mid morning snack for me.<br /><br />With a solid 3 grams of fiber, 1 gram of fat and only 120 calories per serving, they fit perfectly well in my diet.<br /><br />Tons of crunch, sweet enough to satisfy my sweet tooth, and healthy, can't get much better then this!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Corn free and gluten free (less then 20ppm)!<br />Actually has some fiber in it.<br />Stays crunchy.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Kinda pricy, but that's expected.

They are a puffed rice and they will satisfy your sugar craving as they taste deliciously sweet while not giving a sickening sweet aftertaste or feeling after you eat it like other sugar type cereals. you can eat a lot of this or just a small bowl and you will not feel sickly stuffed but satisfyingly full either way :). After this, i'll be branching out and trying new flavors of Barbara's puffins cereals. Yumm!<br />oh, tastes even better with homemade almond milk!
