review/summary: Very Disappointed
review/text: The amazon description read "coconut oil" but when I received the package it lists that "popcorn may contain one of the following oils: coconut, canola, vegetable (lightly hydrogenated)."  Also, I chose this popcorn over others who listed food dye on their descriptions, but again, when package was received it reads "FD&C Yellow #5 & 6."  If the amazon description would have disclosed either of these things, I would not have purchased.

review/summary: Great Popcorn for the Home Theater
review/text: Purchased a 6oz popcorn machine for the family's home theater and the first step was to pick out some popcorn.  Our first trial was the Country Harvest brand<br /><br />Pro's<br /><br />1) Great packaging and easy to use measurements.  Simply clip off top to begin!!<br />2) Popcorn tastes great and much better than the microwaved popcorn we were using.<br />3) As close to popcorn you buy as the movie theater as you'll get.<br /><br />Con's<br />1) Only use half of the pre-packaged salt.  Using the entire amount results in popcorn that IMO is too salty.

review/summary: popcorn
review/text: I tasted this popcorn while getting my oil changed at the dealership.  It was just like movie popcorn!  They popped it in the type of machine used at theaters, only smaller.  I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />I don't have one of the machines, but I do have a whirly pop, which is like a large pot with a special lid that has a wire that stirs the popcorn on the bottom.  The 6oz size was way too much popcorn for the whirly pop.<br /><br />Overall the flavor was good, though don't use all the salt in case it's too salty for your taste.<br /><br />I'd avoid buying this unless you do have a popcorn machine.

review/text: I purchased the six 10oz bottles of this mustard to share with family members.<br />We already knew that we liked the taste, but our local stores only carry it in 4oz jars--- which are pretty silly for pretzel dipping (which is what we use it for). At least with the 10oz bottles this size lasts for more than one snack. The taste is great - just a tiny bit "hot".

review/summary: Impressed by delicious spice blends.
review/text: My husband bought me 4 different spice blends from Teeny Tiny Spice Co of Vermont for my birthday and I feel compelled to write a review, since I don't see any other reviews at the moment. We have an extensive spice collection in our house (we LOVE to cook) and I must say that this Ras el Hanout blend (and the other unusual blends they make) are absolutely amazing. The number of different spices (and especially more unusual spices/flavors) that they have careful ground into this and their other blends is incredible. There are several spices in this blend that I know I would be unable to find anywhere, and yet here they are, perfectly blended for me. With this particular blend we recently made a chicken dish where we made a modified version of the suggested recipe (on the lid of the spice tin) and it was DELICIOUS.<br /><br />I look forward to continuing to cook with these. Unlike some other spice blends I have had in the past that sat on my counter mostly unused until they were stale (mostly because they weren't that tasty, or the spices used were typical ones where I just add them myself), I know for a fact we will use all of these spice blends and then buy more. They are so well done, so unusual, so authentic, and most importantly, so easy to create a delicious meal with. Their web site has a ton of great recipe ideas as well that we are looking forward to trying!<br /><br />One important note though - pay attention to the "hot" level ratings of the blends by this company. If you don't like spicy food then don't get anything rated in any way spicy. This particular Ras el Hanout blend is definitely mild by my standards (as the company has also rated it in their description), but I suspect that my mother (who doesn't like spicy food at all) would still consider this blend a bit too spicy by her standards.

review/summary: One of the best chocolates for the price
review/text: I have bought this same product at Costco during the Christmas holidays for about $13.00, but last year it sold out quickly. I found this on Amazon for $20 and free shipping. I have paid a lot more for Godiva or Sees chocolates but Ferrero Rocher's quality is as good for a lot less money. Sure, these are all the same, unlike buying assorted chocolates, but they are all good. I never bite into one and wish I had picked another.<br /><br />The only thing to watch out for is when you order. If it is warm weather, these could start melting, as they did in my mailbox. They were put away in a cool place and are still delicious but the foil wrapping is a little messy looking now.<br /><br />I treat myself to one of these each night after dinner. Yum!

I know its just candy but I am having a pink and red themed Hello Kitty party so having the colors off was important. I have no idea how these taste, but they are basically pure sugar so I am sure the kids will like them.

The aroma was so amazing when I opened the package I wondered if the taste would be as wonderful; I was more than pleased. I'm not a fan of flavored teas or coffees. This tea should not be compared to those, it does not have "flavorings" to diminish or mask the taste. You can't go wrong with this tea, everyone loves it that I've let try. The company shipped the product very quickly with a sampler of another tea, I will try later.  The price? Best I've found for quality tea! Order it.

review/summary: Iranian Style?
review/text: I purchased several different saffron's from Amazon and a local store to taste and sample.  This was of interest because it stated it was Iranian.  Having read that Iranian saffron was of the best in the world I was intrigued.  However, when received the label stated "Iranian Style". This was disconcerting. This is quoted from the product description:  "You will get about 500 saffron threads with this one gram purchase. We are known throughout Florida and the USA to have some of the finest quality Iranian saffron around! Since it is illegal to import saffron from Iran to America we have worked hard to source some of the finest Iranian style saffron from the nutrient dense lands of New Zealand, France & Greece."  Unfortunately I had not read this prior to ordering.  If it is not Iranian, why say it is?  Or at a minimum be consistent in the representations.<br /><br />To be fair I would say that it is good saffron, at least based on my limited saffron expertise, and compares favorably to the others I had ordered.  I am cooking with it and also taking it as a supplement having read of the clinical study proving saffron's efficacy in treating depression compares favorably to a leading pharmaceutical.<br /><br />Nevertheless there is a feeling of unease about the transaction which I thought to share.

review/text: I love Trappy's peppers, but the one market here which carried them stopped quite a while ago and I have been rationing what was left in my last jar.  I was thrilled to find them at Amazon, and at about half the local cost! (when they were available, that is).  These are very very hot little marinated pepper (much like pepprocini, but taken up a few notches); the hottest marinated pepper I have found yet.  We use them in sandwiches and salads, and I save the vinegar for salad dressing (we like hot stuff here).  It's a small jar, but packs a lot of punch.<br />I came to write this up in part because of the recommendation which I got when I ordered these (people who bought this also bought) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00002N9ER">MAGLITE ASXD026 D-Cell Flashlight Mounting Bracket</a> which I thought was absolutely hilarious.  I have to wonder if one of these jars would fit ? (I am not beyond decorating my kitchen in hot peppers) but have to admit that the idea was not my own. Simply brilliant!

The vinegar can also be recycled to pickle eggs with a slight kick. I'll be ordering cases of these often.

review/summary: Has a bite to it
review/text: Trappey's Hot Peppers adds a pleasant bite to black eyed peas and lentil soup.<br />The hot peppers in the jar flavor the vinegar. Sprinkle the vinegar on soups, beans, clam chowder, salsa, or anything that needs a kick. When all the vinegar has been consumed, fill the jar with more white vinegar to cover the peppers and let sit in the refrigerator a few days and you're ready to go again.<br />The peppers can also be eaten, but they are TOO hot for me. Been using Trappey's since 1977.

review/summary: The best little peppers around
review/text: I "LUV" "LUV" "LUV" these little peppers. I first found them a Ross's dept store about 12 years ago. They only had 2 jars left, so I bought them both. One for me and one for my dad. After that day I was hooked (as was my dad) but alas; I could not find them again. I saved the jar and bought a case of 12 from a company not to far from me (N. Calif) at a cost of $30.00 with the shipping. I am so happy to have found them at this wonderful price. I just ordered 2 cases from here. I use them in gift baskets for special friends. Trappeys also makes one with small red peppers (amazon red peppers)that have a great kick but are mushy so I only use those for cooking.<br /><br />Gary

review/summary: Best tartar sauce ever tasted
review/text: I prefer tartar sauce instead of lemon on fish.  If you do too then this best of market tartar sauce is the one to buy.  Beaver Brand, while a 'curious' company name, makes the best.  This tartar sauce has excellent taste due in part to dill weed ingredient, yet it does not have that sweet, pickled flavor common in other brands.  I was concerned about trying this in a six-pack purchase, but it has worked out deliciously.  Packaging is recycleable plastic squeeze bottle with inner seal.  It can be stored without refrigeration until opened.

review/summary: Good Tartar Sauce
review/text: Received a pack of 6. Way more than what I needed but must admit it taste pretty good and also, it has motivated the entire household to consume more fish so we can finish them someday. For some reason I also like the name of the maker and that is a plus. Been using this sauce in specially made fish taco sessions and also with mahi mahi and the occasional salmon. Must admit Tartar sauce is not a daily must in our kitchen but there are times when nothing else will do. Very nice taste, long expiration dates (we needed that) and better than what is available for us locally. If buying this product makes a nice amazon reader consume more quality seafood (not the contaminated kind, mind you) then it is well worth the purchase. 4 solid Stars (above average) for Beaver Brand Tartar Sauce, 11.5-Ounce Squeezable Bottles (Pack of 6).

review/text: I bought this inexpensively and on an impulse while very hungry and shopping at my local "warehouse club" (I'm a pushover for all things gravy). I'm really glad I did, because this is actually really tasty and NOT black peppery. I don't digest black pepper well and am so glad this wasn't really peppered like a lot of sausage gravies. This has a mild, creamy flavor and slightly thick consistency with generous amounts of sausage bits/chunks throughout it. I had this with biscuits, but this would be good also with toast. Between the 5 of us in my family, this will get eaten up within the next couple of days (for breakfasts, snacks, maybe a breakfast dinner).<br /><br />Our children liked this so well, they even suggested I get another can to add to our Christmas morning breakfast/lunch spread! I am also considering taking this and some biscuits to the next potluck meal, breakfast or not.<br /><br />Quick, convenient, mild, and tasty--we love it!

review/text: I don't like all the controversy surrounding rawhide bones and don't want take the risk of my Lab getting a blockage so I exclusively give him Booda bones which are safe. My lab is an aggressive chewer and considering this is edible it makes him that much more excited as he LOVES food. He enjoys these bones but devours them in less than 20 minutes. I usually give it to him for a few minutes until he eats half of it and then I take it away to save for next time. This obviously would get very expensive so he has his non-edible Nylabones most of the time and these are special treats.

review/summary: Goodbye Rawhides! Hello Peace of Mind - & Dogs Love 'em!
review/text: Love these! Well, because...we have 3 dogs (2 were unplanned children ;-) & our 60-LB German Shepherd AND our 40-LB we-have-no-clue-what-she-is dog have both choked on various shapes & sizes of rawhides. The Shepherd choked so badly that, this time, it wouldn't come up. She couldn't cough & started to literally choke to death. I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do - the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway? Well, I tried anyway and thank God it finally did dislodge & we got it out! Was it the Heimlich? I don't know. Probably not. I mean, she still won't tell me... After all, I guess it was very traumatic for her.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, what I do know, is that was the last time any of my dogs have had any kind of regular rawhide bones! Which, I really wanted to let everyone know of my personal experiences; I believe anybody who is at all concerned about giving their dogs rawhides and/or experiencing a similar problem is on the right track to avoid them.<br /><br />Our small part Chihuawa/part something else, first 2 times in-a-row, threw up repeatedly w/rawhide pieces and w/foam. He was VERY sick the 3rd time, so we definitely stopped that! The ONLY kind I did finally take a chance with were granulated rawhide munchy sticks, & they're all fine w/these; though I'm still nervous about them choking on a piece, but neither of them have had any problems with Boodas so far, & they don't swell up in their throats like regular rawhides.<br /><br />So, now... It's Booda Bones!<br /><br />Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially for my 2 larger aggressive chewers. I agree with some other reviewers that they are not very long-lasting. But it's all I'll give them now. But, for my half Chihuahua/half something else(20lbs), I give him the smallest ones and they are like mega-saurus bones for him(it is my hope that the manufacturer will start selling these in bulk packages, for less $). I get 3 different sizes for my 3 different whatever-they-are-dogs. They absolutely love them! This includes the assorted flavors, the bacon-flavored, and the yogurt-flavored. Whichever is cheaper at the time and shipped by Amazon.<br /><br />And I owe a big thank you to Brian Amazon, all of you for all of your reviews, Booda Bones, and Amazon!<br /><br />** Confession: This was originally a comment I posted to a reviewer by the name of "Brian Amazon" a long time ago. I have been buying Bones from Amazon, and, only Booda Bones, ever since. They are so great that I've been wanting to write a review, & now finally have the chance to (I have, however, resorted to copying and pasting much of my original [brief... LOL] comment, with some editing).

review/summary: More of a treat then something to keep your dog busy.
review/text: Let me start by saying our dogs love these. As soon as they see the bag they stop whatever they're doing and run to their crates (where we typically give these to them). However, for our dogs these are definitely more of a treat then an activity. I have one dog who is an aggressive chewer who finishes these in under five minutes. He doesn't chew them as much as bite of chunks of it. My other dog isn't quite as strong of a chewer but it usually takes her just around fifteen minutes to eat the whole thing (this review is specific to the Biggest Boodas). So for my dogs this is less of a chewing experience and more of a treat. And when the eat them this quickly, they do get expensive quick.

I like that they are safer than rawhide bones and easy to digest and she really seems to enjoy them more than other bones I've bought for her. I tried a few other brands when I stopped being able to find the booda bones at pet stores and she would not even eat some of them. You can't go wrong with these, they are reasonibly priced, safe, help reduce tartar, and dogs seem to love them.

review/text: I have a dog who until we adopted her never had oral care,so her teeth were in bad shape. We brush her teeth every 3 weeks and give her 1 booda bone weekly . Not only are her teeth cleaner but some of the staining has gone away. Our vet told us that these are the best thing for her because they digest easily and do not contain plastics.

review/text: I had previously tasted the pumpkin seed version of this snack, and it was very good.  I went ahead and ordered them in the walnut version because walnuts are supposed to be so healthy.  These turned out to be very bitter.  My children had to spit them out.  Some of them were bitter from the first bite, and others just had a bitter aftertaste.  I was informed by Amazon that you cannot return food items, so I went back and tried them again.  There seem to be some good ones among the bad, but for the most part, they have a bitter taste.

I like them so much better than just plain walnuts because of the touch of sweetness. I love the texture, everything. Best snack or dessert ever. Ok, I'm done. Enjoy.

review/text: I love Mrs. May's nut snacks.  I had only had the Almond crunch before this, which is amazing.  I liked the Walnut a little less than the almond, but it was still very good and I enjoyed it.  You know when walnuts are cut they have powdery crumbs, and for this reason the bite size pieces of Walnut crunch are not as clean to eat as the Almond crunch pieces.  They taste just like walnuts, with a little honey added, so if you love walnuts, you'll love this snack.

review/summary: Great texture and taste.
review/text: I collect recipes and came across so many for recipes using Wheat Berry.  Our local grocery stores don't stock this item and I am so happy I was able to get in at such a reasonable price on Amazon.  I have used the wheat berries in 2 different salads and we love the texture.  Alone they are very bland, but mixed with the right ingredients, they provide an interesting taste and texture to a salad.  They can be chewy, I guess the best description would be barley, but with more texture. I have seen recipes specifying either soft wheat berries or hard wheat berries.  Haven't researched enough but believe the hard berries require more cooking, probably overnight soaking.  I purchased the soft and have used them in recipes that call for both hard and soft.  I know they are healthy and a little does go a long way.  A good supplement for people who enjoy eating healthy.

review/summary: All stale; some opened; none w/ Exp. Date
review/text: I buy all my cereal from Amazon. I am usually very pleased with products received from Amazon. This box of cereal bowls contained several bowls that were open! All of the varieties I tried were stale and didn't taste right; and the Raisin Bran actually seemed rotten. The first thing I did after encountering these problems was to check for an expiration or use by date. There was no indication on any of the packaging ANYWHERE as to when these bowls of cereal would no longer be appropriate for human consumption. By comparison, the General Mills cereals I've purchased from Amazon have expiration dates on each and every individual bowl (usually printed on the bottom). Kellogg's makes great cereals - I have no problem with Kellogg's - I think I got a bad box that had been stored away in the back of some warehouse somewhere that should have been discarded because it was way past its shelf-life. Amazon, of course, refunded my money. But, just beware that it could happen to you and if it does be sure to get Amazon to refund your money. Amazon's warehouses need to be more vigilant. We can't just complain on here and hope the warehouses change their practices - we need to make our money talk to Amazon so they will get warehouse management/personnel to comply with Amazon standards and federal consumer laws.

review/text: Since I spend most of my week alone, opening a big box of cereal is such a waste.  The cereal would always go bad before I could eat it all.  This doesn't happen with these containers.<br /><br />I love these individual serving sizes because they also aid in calorie counting and at 80-110 calories, they are low in calories.  I carry around one of the fruit loops packages in my backpack, just as a great snack.<br /><br />I do want to warn though, that Amazon shipped them to me in a single box and about 20 of the containers arrived opened inside the box because the outer box was a little damaged, but being the great company they are, Amazon promptly shipped another box "free of charge" and allowed me to keep the ones from the original shipment that made it here okay.  I love Amazon!

review/summary: Give it a try... you might like it :)
review/text: Konjac (often also called shirataki) noodles are fairly new to the American market, so don't be turned off by negative reviews, learn about this product, try several different varieties, maybe several different brands, try to cook it with different meats and veggies, and I believe most of you will like this product.<br />DO NOT expect it to taste like regular (made out of flour) pasta because it won't. These noodles are made from yam root plus fiber. Konjac noodles have no taste and will absorb any flavor you introduce into the dish. They tend to be kind of "rubbery", so if you're offended by that, try tofu shirataki noodles (these are original konjac noodles with added tofu). They are softer than original konjac noodles. They also look white which makes them look more like regular pasta. Try both kinds and then make up your mind.<br />Both kinds come water packed and both have to be rinsed THOROUGHLY before use. I, personally, prefer original konjac noodles because (to me) tofu shirataki noodles have a fishy kind of odor, it takes longer to rinse it out of them and the smell still lingers sometimes (or maybe my nose is too sensitive). Konjac noodles can be stored at room temperature and shirataki tofu noodles need to be refrigerated.<br /><br />In any case, check out the many sites dedicated to this great product and I am sure you'll find a recipe or two to your liking. This product is as close as you'll get to zero calorie food. That said, let me give you one more friendly advice:<br />this type of food is NOT nutritious, so make sure you are taking your vitamins and/or get the necessary nutrients from other foods. This product would definitely be beneficial to people looking for a low glycemic impact food.<br />[...]

I was a little hesitant to try them at first because I didn't expect them to be cooked and thought they might taste soggy. We heated them up and served them with a seafood dish.  I was amazed at how good they tasted. Almost identical to flour based pasta (and only 20 cals/serving!)<br /><br />After researching these noodles on the internet, I was delighted to find out how many health benefits they had.

These noodles have No calories and zero carbs after you minus the fiber, how wonderful is that !!!!!  If you're looking for this noodle to taste just like regular pasta, it won't. BUT if you like trying new things and learning to use new foods, these noodles are the way to go.  Besides, knowing these have no calories and zero net carbs makes me a happy "dieting" camper.

review/summary: Super noodles
review/text: I love these noodles and ordered by bulk directly from Konjac. This will be an ongoing order for me. They come packed in a water tight bag. You just rinse, add your other ingredients and heat up. There is a strong fish smell upon opening. However, once they are rinsed and mixed with other foods, they automatically take on the taste of the food. Just as good as spaghetti.  The bags are 9 oz. each and it feeds two people, even though it does not look that big. Excellent for low carb diets. I'll never use regular pasta again.
