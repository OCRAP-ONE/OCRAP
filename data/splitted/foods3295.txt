review/summary: Did not send the brand advertised
review/text: After ordering these for 3 years for my dog, they sent a different brand distributed by Radio Systems Corp, Made in China.  Granted, when I look at what's remaining of my last package of Premier Busy Buddy Gnawhide Refil Ring (as advertised), it also was made in China.  It just annoys me that they have changed their distributor/manufacturer.......and haven't changed what they advertise they are selling. I will return these and find another company to order from.  Perhaps Premier Busy Buddy Gnawhide rings no longer exist and I'll have to find another favorite treat for my beloved dog.  Buyer Beware

review/summary: My Dog Loves These
review/text: My dog is blind and there are very few toys that interest him--okay, the ONLY toys that interest him involve food.  He is about 25 pounds and I got him the medium size Bouncy Bone and the Bristle Bone.  He packs them around the house.  The only reason I gave the gnawhide refills 4 stars instead of five is because they're kind of expensive.

review/text: My dandie dinmont terriers absolutely love these. Give each of them one, they are kept busy for a good amount of time and I can get chores done!  These should be sold in multipacs.<br /><br />I would be nice if they could be chicken flavored and without any cornstarch. I try to only feed select foods and snacks, so this has become their one allowed "Junk Food" item and they absolutely love it.<br /><br />You should see, we bring 4 of these out-one for each dog- they sit and wait patiently while we get them ready and then they go off to their own special spots with them. No messy clean up after and everyone is happy.

review/text: These are great but don't last very long at all :-(<br />The gnawhide rings that came with the original toy seemed harder and lasted longer, but these refills were very soft an pliable making them go away fast! So, very expensive 5 minute experience. Hopefully next time they will last longer if come from a different lot or something because my doxie loves them on his busy bone!

review/text: My dogs love the Busy Buddy bones.  They get the rawhide rings off first, pretty quick.  I am happy to be able to get all cornstarch now, lasts longer.  For dogs that aren't so food motivated, the easier rawhide rings are better as the dogs get frustrated with the cornstarch and give up.

review/summary: GNAWHIDE FOR BRISTLE BONE
review/text: My only complaint is that the refills are too expensive.  My puppy loves this rawhide and putting it in the bristle bone prevents her from snarfing it down too fast.  The two small discs don't seem to upset her stomach and I am not worried about big chunks of rawhide being ingested, as can happen with rawhide bones.  Once a day I can depend on having about 10-15 minuets of free time when I give my puppy this rawhide toy.  I would love to be able to give it to her more often but the cost, and the fact that I don't want her to ingest too much rawhide, prohibits me from doing so.  Tragically, she is learning to extract the rawhide much more quickly, but it still keeps her satisfied longer than most toys.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F0RRTQ">Premier Busy Buddy Gnawhide Refill Ring Dog Treats for Bristle and/or Bouncy Bones, Rawhide, Medium</a>

review/summary: Doesn't Last Long At All
review/text: I have a 50-lb Lab who loves to chew things.  I bought this a few times to use with a busy bone, hoping to keep the dog busy!  Well, he chews through it in a couple of minutes, and pretty much once he gets a tear in it, the entire thing comes off and he chews and swallows nearly the whole thing at once.  Needless to say, after a cost of 75cents or so per treat, it really wasn't worth 2 minutes of distraction, plus I wasn't happy with how he could swallow it nearly whole.  This would probably be better for smaller dogs or ones that aren't so food motivated!

review/summary: Gone in a heartbeat
review/text: I purchased these to put on my dog's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KVF49Q">Premier Busy Buddy Bouncy Bone, Medium</a> My dog is a lab mix and as soon as I put these on her bone...they're gone!  She loves the taste of them and they're pretty soft for a hard treat, so they just break right off, she chews a couple times and..."Gulp."  they're gone.  So, in general,  if you are purchasing these for a large breed, the bouncy bone itself is a great idea and very very durable (as are ALL of the Premier pet toys,) however I do not recommend the gnawhide rawhide rings for anything larger than a medium terrier breed.  Otherwise you'll be spending wayyyy too much on these refill packs.<br /><br />Note:  If you have a large breed (as I do) these rings work great on the bouncy bone as a big treat/reward for good behavior!

review/text: These are refills for the Busy Bone and Bristle Bone.  It is the best possible option for dogs who like to chew:  They love the challenge of the busy bone and bristle bone, yet the rawhide intake is very limited--both on the positive side.  When paired with the cornstarch/rawhide refill rings, it is a special treat.

review/text: I keep getting these because my puppy likes them and they are safe for her to chew.  They don't break off into pieces that can hurt her.  I have a "Premier Busy Buddy Bristle Bone" that unscrews on both ends.  You just slip these on and give it to them and it will keep them busy for a long time.  I have the small size, but they have larger ones for bigger dogs.  They also have one that has a sort of ball in the middle that these little round chews slip onto also.  It's a pretty good product and I'll keep getting them until she gets tired of them.

review/text: The gnaw-hide rings purchased to refill the med/lg sized bouncy bones do not fit. You can slide one on one end but it will not slide across to the other side of the toy.  Only one end of the bone screws off, so, unless the hole is big enough on the refill ring you can only use one ring at a time.

review/summary: Premier Busy Buddy Treats really do keep puppies busy!
review/text: Dog trainer recommended the bouncy bones with gnawhide rings to keep my three cavalier king charles puppies occupied enough so that they wouldn't chew items that they shouldn't.  It worked.  I give each puppy the treat every other day and they like the rawhide better than the cornstarch rings.  Pleased with the choice.

review/summary: The perfect gift for a ketchup lover.
review/text: I had a weirdo friend who puts ketchup on everything. So this seemed to be the perfect gift. She carried it around in her purse all the time. It's so much easier to use than the normal packets. I wish the other fast food places would join chick-fila so I could get these for free but for now it might be an okay alternative to pay a little extra for it. You might want to wait until these things are eligible for free shipping/amazon prime.

When people got back to me with information regarding the product white discoloration, sticking to the inside foil and hardness of the candies, OZBO refused to replace the product because I couldn't collect all from whom I had given the candy. I guess OZBO would have me open each separate Riesen candy and inspect, then rewrap them and package back up in the bag. GET REAL OZBO. I hope this review is helpful.

review/text: It is a slim packet with mostly tuna meat and not much water.  Make sure you bring a small spoon to get every bits out.  It was a little hard to use my fingers to eat.<br /><br />I bought it primarily for backpacking and hiking.  It is light weight, healthy, and fulfilling as a part of my lunch.  The calorie count is good (80 per packet) and the taste is not bad when the body screams for fuel.  I can also see it being added into rehydrated TVP, rehydrated instant refried beans, and canned soup, etc..<br /><br />I also put a few packets in my cubicle in case i get hungry.  it's a super healthy snack (if u prefer savory snack).<br /><br />Overall I am very happy to have it in my pantry so that I can grab it whenever i need one or two.

review/summary: Not good
review/text: My son loves all the Ella's Kitchen fruit & veggie pouches (along with Plum Organics as well). But this chicken meal... yuck. Not only does it not smell appealing, but it tastes awful. My son is 11 months and eats everything I put in front of him, but this Ella's Kitchen chicken meal (along with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0081ZAVLE">ELLA'S KITCHEN Oh So Creamy Chicken and Corn Mash, 4.5-Ounce (Pack of 7)</a>) is something he refuses to eat. I literally spoon it in his mouth and he sticks out his tongue and pushes it out as quick as he can.<br /><br />The only way I got him to eat this is by mixing it with fruit baby food (with a ratio of 2:1 fruit to chicken). I recommend sticking with homemade chicken. I have not tried other meat-based baby foods but given how Ella's Kitchen tends to be incredibly tasty, I can only imagine how bad other brands' food must be.

For starters, a lot of us keep it in the fridge and freezer to absorb odors.  And that's just the beginning.  It occurred to me that it was foolish to keep buying it in the small boxes.  So now I have a large quantity handy for whenever I need it.  The packaging is VERY smart -- you just scissor the top, and it's ready to pour. The handle is a thoughtful addition.

I can say this without fear because the packages I have sitting on the kitchen table in front of me clearly say that this is a "Product of China."<br /><br />You know, the China where they feel free to add melamine to products for human babies (2008), and dogs and cats (2007 and 2010) -- all so that the protein levels register higher than they normally would :(<br /><br />I am so disappointed.  Honestly, my little Jack-a-Bee puppy loves their products, but I won't be purchasing the Chicken Chips or Chicken Breast Strips again.

review/summary: Terrible product
review/text: I bought these chicken treats after receiving several articles about dogs getting sick from other chicken breast treats that we're made in China.  I bought these specifically because they were made in the USA and I assumed they would be safe.  They were so hard I could barely break them and my dog wasn't chewing them well.  He started choking on a piece while eating it and that was the end of that.  These are terrible and dangerous.  The pieces are so sharp I became concerned about him cutting an intestine or something.  Now I make my own chicken treats.  It's pretty easy and I know exactly what is in them.

What I don't like about them is that there is a thick string, or maybe just a thick vain of some kind, going through each piece. A much smaller issues is that these are very hard, even hard to break by hand.  We have been using a pliers to break the pieces up before serving and then a scissors to cut the string part!  A dog could choke to death with these.<br /><br />My biggest problem is that I am looking for an alternative USA raised chicken solution for treats.

review/summary: Made in USA or not?
review/text: Have been buying this product for some time now - saw complaints about made in USA or not so I called the company. I spent about 30 minutes on the phone with a woman there who was weary of this complaint but very nice. I told her we love our pets, have learned to trust almost no one anymore and they were hurting themselves by selling products from China.<br /><br />As she explained,the confusion comes from the following: the "Made in USA" labeled chicken breast strips - what I have been using for my golden retriever puppy (who ABSOLUTELY loves them - really a healthy nutritious chew toy that lasts about 3 minutes - maybe 10 minutes for a little dog - when he sees it, he goes nuts - has never choked on them or had any negative effects I can see) is, as it says on the bag, Made in USA - they are processed in the USA and come from chicken raised in the USA.<br /><br />Smokehouse DOES sell another chicken product that does NOT say made in the USA on the package and this product DOES come from China.<br /><br />Buy whichever one you want.<br /><br />As to the complaints about not being able to cut them up easily - this IS absolutely true - so, if you want tiny bits of treat to use for reward based training, this is definitely NOT the product you want. I use other natural treats for this purpose (Merricks lamb lung is terrific for this use and my dog loves this product just as well - a one pound bag goes a long way - very easy to break up in whatever sizes you want in seconds)<br /><br />Finally, this product (chicken breast strips) has ONE ingredient: chicken. It is made in the USA from chicken grown in the USA. Because it is dried, it lasts forever, does not need refrigeration, makes no mess when fed to your dog, dogs love it - what else do you want for a treat?

review/summary: USA Chicken Strips
review/text: We have three dogs and I try to find healthy treats from the USA. Smokehouse also has chicken strips from China that are much cheaper but I'd rather give them less treats from the US than spend less and give them more treats from China. These are pricey but the dogs all love them.

review/summary: Exciting and wholesome.
review/text: If your dog is the kind with a cast iron gut who chows down on road kill with nary a problem and you have an extremely limited budget, this may not be the treat for your dog. For my own case, I have a Border Collie with a sensitive stomach and my budget for dog treats is modest. These are a great treat made here in the USA as the previous reviewer noted, avoiding the potential problems of Chinese made goods making the news recently. Feeding one of these 2-3 times per week gets that excited, eyes bugging out, reaction one would expect from a treat while providing an all natural, high protein component to your dogs diet, while remaining very affordable. As with any treat, overindulgence can upset the proper balance of your dogs diet, but even 2-3 in one day have not upset my dogs gut. In my opinion, this is almost as good as cooking for your dog yourself.

review/text: Just to clarify, Smokehouse makes these in the US and also in China.  The ones made in China will cost less than the ones made in the US. The ones made in the US clearly states it on the front of the bag.  For those of you that got bags from China, you should check to make sure you ordered the right bag and if so, return it for a refund if they mistakenly sent you the wrong bag. These treats are great. All natural, so they're healthy.

review/summary: Smokehouse delivers great product - not all from USA
review/text: We're very happy with the Smokehouse products we've ordered. The quality is top-notch. The Natural Chicken Breast Strips are our dog's favorite. He devours them. He gets a little gassy, sometimes, from them but overall he responds well to the treats.<br /><br />Warning: Not all Smokehouse products are made in the USA. We've found that they are clearly labeled. Generally, if they do not say USA in their main product description you can assume they come from China. We have made the mistake of ordering products made in China, and found that to be our mistake and not the manufacturer's.<br /><br />We have no affiliation with the company.

review/summary: Dogs loved 'em
review/text: They look just like chicken tenderloins.  I say that because in my heart of hearts I sometimes wonder if our dog treats really come from the animals they say they do?  They call it chicken so that we, the consumers are happy to buy them because we eat chicken too, but what if they said they came from some other kind of avian source?  Anyways, I digress.  My dogs love these, they have no digestion issues from them whatsoever.  I would only feed them, at most, 1 per day.  It is a good value to buy them in the big bag, the smaller bags cost more at my local pet store.

review/text: I ordered these chicken strips because they were Made in the US. After having  a friend lose two dogs to the contaminated dog food from China I made the decision to not purchase anything for my Shih Tzu that is made in China. She is too precious to give her anything that is made there. The item is a little pricey but well worth it for the health and well being of my pet.

review/summary: Treat caused ulcers in my dog's GI tract
review/text: I should have known when I touched these strips.<br />They are rock solid hard.<br />Anyways I gave it to my dog for the first time, and it caused minor tearing and ulcers in her GI tract. I first noticed little blood in her stool, and dog was visibly unwell.<br />I brought her to the vet immediately before they closed for the day, and did xrays, stool test, and all that.<br />Ended up with a $1600 vet bill, but at least a recovering dog that shouldn't have any long term health problems.<br />The treat basically was so hard the sharp edges was causing minor tearing the GI tract. My dog is a chewer too and she never swallows anything whole, and I was watching her as she ate.<br />I had given her bully sticks, raw hide before (about once or twice a week), and she had no problems.<br />It couldn't have been anything else either because she hasn't eaten anything else other than her dog food (Ziwipeak) in the past 3 days. Ziwipeak isn't a kibble diet either. It is jerky like meat which is very soft. No signs of anything else (like plastic or metal toys, etc) on her x-ray either. So yes, it is these Chickenstrips.<br /><br />Anyhow, I took a new one out of the packaging, and attempted to cut it with a pair of scissors.<br />The strip was so hard my scissors wouldn't cut through, especially where the vein/tendon/muscle fiber (or whatever that is) is.<br />I probably will need a penknife or a small saw to do the job.<br /><br />So yea I learned my lesson, and should have listened to what another reviewer said earlier.<br />I took my chances because this product had so many 5 star feedback, and I made my dog go through unnecessary and avoidable pains and hardship. And also landed myself with a $1600 vet bill (sigh...)<br /><br />Definitely wouldn't advice this to anyone. If you have a really big dog like a Mastiff or a Pit Bull, I can see how this is probably OK because the dog itself is big, so this treat is really small compared in size. I have a 10 pound dog, so yea. I still wouldn't recommend anyone risking any chances, well unless you think a few thousand dollars in vet bills is nothing and don't mind your dog going through all that pain.<br />From now on if I am giving any chicken treats, its gonna be freezed dried or I will just boil or steam some boneless chicken myself.<br />Lesson learned. An expensive, painful, and totally avoidable one.<br /><br />I am so regretful for what I have done to my dog -_-

review/summary: smokehouse chicken breast strips
review/text: I bought the smokehouse chicken breast strips because they were made in the U.S.A. They are so hard, my dog cannot chew them, and if I break them (which is hard to do), I am afraid she will choke on them. There are not very many "strips", mostly pieces.  It is a wasted $22.99, as I will not give them to her. How can you sell something so dangerous.

review/summary: My Dog's Favorite
review/text: Apparently my yorkie is addicted to these dog treats. She's a very picky little dog. If one of these treats was near she would literally turn her head when offered anything else. If offered again, she would back away and wait until this treat was offered instead. We've worked through that, but she is still controlled by these treats. She will do anything and perform any command as if her life depended on it if she can only have these treats!<br /><br />The positives: She really loves them, above all other treats. They're made in the USA.<br /><br />The negative: I think they're too pricey for dog treats.<br /><br />I'm thinking of using the food dehydrator to whip up some chicken jerky instead. Perhaps she will like that as much. Until then, this is the treat of choice.

review/text: I love ordering from Amazon...my orders arrive fast and well packed.<br /><br />However, the Smokehouse 100% Natural Chicken Breast strips were supposed to be made in the USA.  I paid more for them because I was afraid to buy any more that were made in China.  My dog has been so sick on them.  I even gave him a small piece and everyday he would throw it up.  He never did that with the Milo's Kitchen or Wagon Train which ARE made in China. Also, they are supposed to be lean, but have fat pieces on them that I scrape off.  I don't know what's wrong!!!!

review/summary: Very decent product
review/text: Dark Chocolate with Mint flavor is one of my favorite combinations. This product has a few things on top of that in its favor: organic, and 70% dark.<br /><br />The organic specification is important to me. It's one way we can "vote" with our pocketbook to help reverse the trend towards highly-mechanized, profit-driven food production.<br /><br />70% dark means that this is food, not candy. The sugar is kept to a minimum, so that this can qualify as something that will not harm your health.<br /><br />How is the taste? It's quite good. The dark flavor and mint are balanced well. I'm not sure it's the best mint chocolate I've ever had...I would have preferred a bit stronger mint, but I tend to like strong flavors. All in all I'm very pleased with it and the case-lot price was decent for this class of product. I would buy it again.

review/summary: Heavenly!
review/text: Since I found out I am diabetic or at least pre-diabetic I have gone very low carb.  I have become much more conscientious about not eating things that might be bad for my health.  I like it that this chocolate does not contain soy, since I'm trying to stay off of it knowing it negatively  affects my mood in larger amounts.  It's hard to avoid soy, since it's in so many foods.  I haven't found another chocolate bar that doesn't contain soy.<br />  Since this is dark chocolate it has little enough sugar that I can savor it in small amounts.  It is heavenly!  I didn't used to care for dark chocolate that much, but I think part of the reason I like this chocolate so much is that the hint of mint offsets any bitterness.  It seems to make it taste a little sweeter than it actually is.<br />  I like to support fair trade and agricultural practices that work with, instead of against the environment.
