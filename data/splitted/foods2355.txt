review/summary: Great idea...but I got tired of eating them
review/text: Loved these both in taste and concept when I bought a few from EMS. Bought three cases (variety packs including, cashew, apple pie, this flavor, others) to leave at work and around to snack on, given lack of concentrated sugar, etc. Even though I never ate more than one a day, got a little sick of them and now can't eat them anymore. Kudos :-)= to the folks that make these, but hard to 'live on.' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YUI576">Larabar Bars Variety Pack Of Cherry Pie, Apple Pie, And Pecan Pie, 1.6-Ounce Bars (Pack of 18)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YUGQEA">Larabar Bars Variety Pack Of Cherry Pie, Apple Pie, And Chocolate Coconut Chew, 1.6-Ounce Bars (Pack of 18)</a>

review/summary: If you like the smell of feet and the taste of chalk, this bar's for you
review/text: I like to try all different health food bars and when I saw one that combined my two favorite things together (chocolate and hazelnuts) I said, "oooh I have to try".  I was sorely disappointed.  I bought two of these and I was excited to try one.  I opened it and was hit by the awful smell of... well a foot-like scent.  So that was a turnoff, but I said hey I have never been one to let looks or smell hinder me from trying something new.  So I went ahead and ate it.  I had to force myself to finish it.  It was like torture eating this.  It tasted awful.  I actually opened up the second and dared a coworker to try it because it was so bad.  He tried it and he felt the same way.  It has almost no flavor, but what flavor it does have lingers in your mouth and grosses you out.<br /><br />Who I'd recommend it to:  1.) People that like to give friends that lose bets something awful to eat. 2.) My enemies.

review/text: It tastes neither like a chocolate nor coffee. I'm not sure about the health benefit but it's a torture to chew this thing. I enjoy many other healthy food but this one's a totally no no.<br />It's as if they just mixed cacao and coffee bean then put tons of sugar to cover the bitterness of the two. Too sweet, but not tasty sweet.<br />I won't buy this even if it's free.

review/summary: Ugh *Awful Face* Spitting out over the sink rinsing my mouth
review/text: I love other Larabar products (and have them in my cabinet currently).  This one however shouldn't have ever made it through their testers.  It's so horrible that even 1 1/2 years after trying it, the thought of it causes my face to automatically squinsh up in digust.  I cannot express fully in words the utter awfulness of this product.  However, the telling of the story of both my mother and I leaning over separate sinks spitting it out and rinsing our mouths is sure to set both of us off in hysterics to the bemusement of anyone around us.  I wholeheartedly DO NOT recommend trying this product.  (Ugh.  I need to go rinse my mouth with mouthwash just from thinking about this product long enough to write this review.)

review/summary: Crunchy Cookie with a Hint of Chocolate and Orange
review/text: Pepperidge Farm is one of the few national companies that mass markets distinctive cookies.  One of those cookies is the marvelous Orange Milano cookie.  When you bite into this crunchy cookie you get a hint of chocolate as you reach the center, and as you chew the orange flavor spreads throughout your mouth.  Yet, none of the flavors is overwhelming.  The problem with Orange Milano cookies is that it is hard to stop after eating only one.<br /><br />These cookies are relatively expensive compared to other brands.  However, one of the hallmarks of Pepperidge Farm from the beginning of the company in the 1930s is quality.  For an alternative to the sweeter cookies typically available in the cookie isle, try Pepperidge Farm's cookies.  If you are looking for a good cookie to try first, this one is a winner.

review/summary: If you like sugar you'll love this drink....
review/text: I have been looking for a drink that has good taste and health benefits forever and I thought I had found it. While watching THE DOCTORS on TV I saw them recommend Guanabana for its nutritional benefits and searched my local supermarkets to see if they carried it. After finding it at a local chain I looked at the nutritional facts on the back of the can and was shocked at just how much sugar it had. Coming in at 38grams of sugar this drink and any other drink that has that much sugar should taste good and it does. Described as juice from concentrated nectar the can hides the fact that it is only 20% juice. Compared to drinks like Mountain Dew the Jumex juice is pretty good but given the benefits are drowned out by the negative additives this is a drink I will pass on in the future, instead I'll pick up the extract and add it to water or buy the tea.<br /><br />4 stars for taste, 2 stars for health benefits.<br /><br />All Feedback Is Appreciated. Thanks and Good Shopping.

review/text: Smucker's Low Sugar Strawberry Perserves. This stuff is delicious. It has 50% LESS sugar than conventional varieties, but here's the best part- the 50% less means 50% MORE FRUIT! (I learned this when I called Smucker's to compliment them on the product.) It's sweet, but in a really natural way that's not overbearing. It actually tastes like real fruit. It also has half the calories of conventional jam, jelly and preserves. I recommend that you try it if you haven't already. It's great with peanut butter or mixed into ice cream, or even by the spoonful when you're having a sweet tooth! Mmm.

review/text: These appeared in my mailbox, before I knew it.<br />Nice little ziploc bags filled with seeds, so I don't have to worry about a pre sealed cheap bag, and finding a container to put them in, it's already done. Very cool, I thought.<br /> Just planted them, and can tell they're fresh, by their plump, healthy apperance.<br />What I do is get some small pots, small enough for space, but big enough so, she doesn't knock it over when she eats and pulls at the  the grass,<br />Then, plant them about an inch, or two under moist/damp soil. Keep it moist, and give it plenty of light. Wait about a week or two, and it's long enough to tear off and chew, 7 inches, or so.<br /> I rotate a few pots so she never runs out. Really helps keep her healthy, and the cats love the grass!

review/summary: Low fat and good price, and delivered fast. A bit watery though.....
review/text: Although not the absolute cheapest I've ever seen this on sale, compared to most prices in NYC supermarkets (progresso soup is normally $2.99 a can), with shipping from this seller, this came out to about $1.83/can, and it was delivered in a few days straight to my door).  When on sale in NYC, it's usually 3 cans for $6 (in NJ, it's usually 3 cans for $5), so this deal is decent.<br /><br />I usually mix this soup with other items (frozen spinach, dried tortellini or pasta, maybe some leftover homemade chili or chicken etc.) to make something a bit more hearty, and this is a very good base.  It's sort of like their minestrone or vegetable, a bit more watery and with the addition of a few teeny meatballs.

This went on for several days, and the pain kept me from sleep. Every time i would lay down to try to sleep, it would stir my bowels and id be in pain, in the bathroom again. Not only was the diarrhea an issue, but i had the constant feeling like i was about to vomit. though i never actually vomited, i had no appetite and could not eat. So without sleep, or the ability to eat, combined with the continuous diarrhea, i was drained. Im only 110 pounds as it is (im 5'1") and drank the tea to help lose a little pudge. I would NOT use this product unless you are obese and can handle the abdominal pain...and have constant access to a bathroom.

Although I thought they were okay with alot of water, most people wouldn't touch them after 1 taste.  Very grainy and also very small.  Postive is that they are high in fiber, and also low in sugar (plus all-natural with no artificial sweeteners- hard to find).  If you are really into healthy eating, and keep an open mind to remember it's not a traditional cookie- they are pallatable.

Delivery was on time - and I was so excited to open the package and enjoy real milk chocolate-covered espresso beans.  But, No!  These were not even close to what I had expected.  I would have ordered chocolate-covered espresso beans from Candy Warehouse where I've ordered from before, but could not due to their website glitches at the time.<br /><br />The problem:  The chocolate does not taste like real milk chocolate.  The coffee bean did not taste fresh, and actually tasted a bit like cigarette smoke.  Again, I've been eating chocolate-covered espresso beans for years and years - and these were the absolute worst I've ever eaten.  I will never buy or recommend Koppers chocolates to anyone.  If you want a great chocolate covered espresso bean you might want to check out the Candy Warehouse website for great choices.<br /><br />Koppers - Your beans did not stand up to the reputation of your name.  I really expected the best!

Again, when we changed to Taste of the Wild- everything disappeared...not more vomit, not more diarrhea.<br /><br />Granted, it's like wine, some will like it, some will not.

review/text: My Miniature Schnauzer was having lots of health issues and had "Schnauzer Bumps", but we didn't know what was wrong with her. After doing research online, we decided to try her on a grain-free diet and she is doing great now. Before her skin was hot, dry, itchy and covered with bumps. Now she feels good, looks good and her skin is clear and smooth. Thank you Taste of the Wild. My only wish is that you would offer some treats. But to solve that problem, we buy two flavors of the food and fill her  bowl with one flavor and give the other one to her for a treat. And since they taste different, she is happy and so are we. We buy the Salmon and the Fowl flavors and alternate them as her food and treats periodically. Just a note, the other thing that we did for our dog was to also change her shampoo to the Nootie brand of Aloe and Oatmeal Shampoo in Cucumber and Melon fragrance (sold by Amazon also). It's natural, works and smells great and even our groomer buys it to use and says that our dog's skin has improved 100%.

review/summary: Great for the finicky dog with a sensitive stomach....
review/text: We LOVE this kibble.  It's the only one that my 3 year-old very finicky cockapoo will eat, time after time, without fail.  Because he has a sensitive stomach and is allergic to chicken, beef and lamb, we primarily feed him raw rabbit and venison.  To add variety to his diet, however, I give him this, and he absolutely LOVES it.  I'm amazed every time he finishes his bowl as he rarely eats like anything dry.  Best things about this food -- my dog LOVES the taste, it's grain-free, and is full of high-quality ingredients.  Lastly, there's never any loose stool or diarrhea, his coat is shiny, and he's full of energy.  You can't go wrong with this food.  Definitely give it a try!

review/summary: Approved by my picky dog!
review/text: I have a 9yo Doberman with a very slight build. She's neurotic, and doesn't ever get very enthusiastic about eating (she rarely finishes her food). I've had her on TOTW for the last six months or so -- initially the bison, which she ate much more consistently than previous brands. Last week I went in for a new bag, and the employee at my neighborhood pet supply store suggested that I try her on the salmon. She said that because it is more pungent than the others, they recommend it to many customers with picky dogs. Long story short, my dog now eats her food immediately each time I put it out. It's great to see her get excited about food!<br /><br />To echo other reviewers, I too find the price at my pet supply store better, but I'm glad to see this available on Amazon.

review/summary: Fantastic food for dogs with sensitive tummies
review/text: I have a 7-month old miniature dachshund who has a very sensitive tummy.  He came to us eating another high-end food, but he never produced anything except pudding-like poops that would run you out of the room :-)  He was very gassy as well.  Long story short, after ruling out any medical conditions we began to experiment with changing his diet.  After trying several even more expensive foods, we finally landed on Taste of the Wild Pacific Stream and he is now doing beautifully.  His coat is shiny, he has plenty of energy but, best of all, his little digestive system is finally happy.  No gas at all, and very small, very firm poops.  This food is actually less expensive that some of the others I'd tried that were targeted for digestive issues, but has been far more effective.<br />It is apparently quite tasty too, since my other dogs sneak into the room to eat this food instead of their own.

review/summary: Very good dog food for the price!
review/text: I know nobody wants to read a wall of text on how good or bad this dog food is, so here is a very brief summary:<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Price per pound is very economical. Price is actually much cheaper than lower quality foods such as Eukanuba, Purina, etc. It isn't cheaper than Pedigree, but at the same time it isn't filled with garbage like Pedigree is.<br />2. Dog likes the taste. A lot of my friends feed this to their dogs. I fed it to one of my dogs before. He likes it. My other dog doesn't but he doesn't like any kibble anyways, so it isn't this food's fault.<br />3. Food quality is good. No by-products or corn or any other garbage (like unknown sources of bone and meat meals, etc).<br />4. No more ethoxyquin in any taste of the wild products!<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Dogs seem to poop more on this food than other brands such as Orijen or Wellness. Not a lot more though so this isn't really a biggie.<br />2. Made by diamond Pet foods. Not really a biggie either, but diamond pet foods had been plagued with pet recalls problems in the past. Taste of the Wild hasn't had any recalls that I know of, but you're still running a risk, just a really small one.<br /><br />Compared to other brands, this is probably 4 out of 5, but it would be unfair because this brand is much cheaper. Orijen costs almost 2x of what taste of the wild cost.

review/summary: Great food for all ages-
review/text: Our 4 dogs, ages 9 months to 13 years, are doing extremely well of Taste of the Wild Pacific Stream Canine Formula with Smoked Salmon.  We began using this food in the summer of 2009 when we adopted a 3.5 month old puppy.  He had very loose stools and after multiple wormings and tests for parasites that were negative, I decided to try a grain-free food.  Within 48 hours the loose stools disappeared and we have had no issues since.  All of the dogs from the new puppy to our 13 year old are in great health, great weight, and have beautiful coats.  This is an excellent food that has really served my dogs well.  The bonus is that they all love it.

Not sure of the order but salmon, ocean fish meal, potatoes, canola oil, sweet potatoes, smoked salmon I think are the first 7 ingredients.  i think it has chicory root too.<br /><br />a very rich food although my dogs don't have diarrhea problems like with Blue Buffalo. zero grain, zero egg.<br /><br />a little hard to find, but I tell everybody to use this food.

review/summary: Does the job but smells like butt
review/text: I had given the dogs the fowl TOTW formula before and it was okay but also had a strong meaty after-smell.  This version stinks up the whole kitchen like rotting meat and lingers for at least ten minutes after the dogs eat.  It's not even a rotting salmon ish smell.. it's like rotting meat.  I guess I should be thankful they take a drink afterwards because their breath smells just fine and it's just the whole room that smells.<br /><br />Thank goodness the dogs don't fart with it but I'm going to switch to something else high protein and grain free.<br />Pros- does firm up stool.<br />Cons- I've noticed with higher protein and grain free dog food that the dry food is more aromatic but this one is by far the worst.

review/text: Our German Shepherd Dog has the worlds most sensitive stomach and skin.  We swithched him to this product after he started to lick his fur off his arms.  The vet thought it was a food allergy to beef, chicken, and corn meal by product and she was right.  Although we never determined which ingredient was bothering him from his old food, we didn't care after we switched to this.  He stopped licking off his fur and he eats this up quickly.  Yes it has a fishy scent but we barely notice it.  Get this food if your dog is sensitive

review/summary: Our Dogs are Picky.
review/text: I got samples of this stuff from our vet, and they were happy to eat it all up then.  When I purchased a whole 15 pound bag, that was another story.  They won't eat it unless they know they're not getting anything else or unless I put warm beef or chicken broth on it, or they get their nightly canned dog food dumped on top of it.  They get sick of less healthy dog food like Beneful and Kibbles and Bits as well, but I guess they're just spoiled.  Their lack of enthusiasm is no reason to give this product a low rating, though.  They like salmon, but I think they prefer OURS!  I've ended up rotating their dried food, and sometimes it works.  If anyone has a good idea about what to feed our heeler and beagle so they're not so fussy, I'd like to know.

review/summary: Must Try!
review/text: I found this brand by complete accident. During a vacation visit with a relative, we forgot the dog food. Our pet is a Lhasa that has sever allergies to chicken and corn. We found a national brand that reduced her itching, but she still had difficulties. In this small town the only pet supply store in the community did not have the brand; however they suggested a farm feed store that might have the brand. They indicated that don't have the brand; however, they have a good selection of foods so I figured I would get a cheap bag of something that she could eat for only a few days. So I pick up a bag of the Taste of the Wild with Salmon simply because it did not have any chicken by-products or corn. When I opened bag, I was shocked! The food had a rich aroma that did not smell like typical dog food. By the time we left vacation, I began to notice she was not scratching near as much prior to the food change and she loved the taste. Just to see if was the dogfood, I went back to the brand she was eating and she starting scratching again. I am now sold on the brand because it is better and cheaper than national premium brands. The only problem with the food, she began to smell like salmon after a couple weeks "maybe that is  not a completely bad thing because I know it is real salmon" and it not found at many stores.

review/text: I bought taste of the wild bison off of Amazon first. The price which included free shipping in Jan.2012 was better than the price locally...as locally they have to charge tax. However...prices on Amazon rose to make local Tractor Supply a better price. Both dogs liked it and ate it with no problems. Then I thought I would give them variety and tried Salmon. One dog tolerates it ...the other gets Costco dog kibble. Costco is a good dog food deal...nutritionally as well as economically. This salmon I won't buy again. I don't like opening the bag and having to smell it. It just doesn't smell good at all. Kind of turns my stomach. That's hard to deal with twice a day,especially when there is other food that doesn't smell so bad. I'll go back to Bison when this bag is gone.

review/summary: An English Classic
review/text: "Rich Tea" are the quintessential English tea-time biscuit, to be served mid-afternoon with a fine cup of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F3WS7K">English Tea</a> (taken with milk, not lemon). And McVitie make the finest "Rich Tea", having exactly the correct texture and firmness and delicate flavour which these biscuits should have. "Rich Tea" are also the ultimate dunking biscuits, for which purposes they must, of course, be entirely whole and not cracked even in the slightest, otherwise they will instantly fall in half and disappear to the bottom of the cup. Even whole, these biscuits present the maximum challenge to the dunker -- leave the biscuit in the tea just a fraction of a second too long and, again, you'll wonder where your biscuit went (and why you have blotting paper at the bottom of your cup).  [American readers please note that dunking is, of course, entirely frowned upon in English high society, as an activity undertaken only by the peasant classes. It is thus to be indulged in only when entirely alone and in the privacy of one's own home, when there is no danger of being observed by the servants.]<br /><br />Should your biscuits arrive broken, as may, unfortunately, be all too likely (as these are a fragile biscuit and McVitie's packaging consists of no more than a paper wrapper) do not despair; all is not lost. Simply tip a quantity of the broken biscuits into a bowl and pour hot milk over them. The result may look like soggy blotting paper, but the eating experience is exquisite!

review/summary: Calm cookies
review/text: My mother was born and raised in England so I had been exposed to these cookies (biscuits to the Brintish) before they became famous as part of Prince William's groom's cake.  These are plain cookie wafers without frosting, nuts, chocolate, raisins or anything else to mess them up.  They have a nice buttery vanilla flavor without being too sweet or too dry or too vanilla flavored.  They are somewhat fragile even when in the plastic tube, so don't drop the package.  I enjoy these with tea or coffee and they are a delicious treat that is not too high in calories.  They remind me of the arrowroot biscuits that we gave babies 50 years ago but they are softer and more delicate.  I like them very much.  They also worked well in Prince William's cake!  I got the recipe from Oprah's website and made a copy of William's cake.  It is basically broken "biscuits" (these cookies) and lots of butter and sugar and 12 ounces of dark chocolate.  VERY good but I am not sure it is good for you!

review/summary: My Shiloh loves it!
review/text: My canine companion is a 132 pound, five year old, Shiloh Shepherd.  The Shiloh Shepherd is considered a 'giant breed.'  With his enormous size, athleticism, and the general nutrient demands, we all must consider, his diet has always been a primary consideration.  Not to mention, he has the sensitive tummy often seen among the German Shepherd breed.  His breeder has always been partial to 'Premium Edge Lamb.'  This is the formula he was weaned on.  I had no desire to change what appeared to be a successful regimen.<br /><br />Then to my dismay, I learned 'Premium Edge' was placed on a recent recall list.  I knew that a change in diet was likely to be detrimental to my fur friend, but I had to take immediate action.  And, at the time of recall, I didn't have time to gradually transition to a new diet, which is always the way to go, to avoid negative symptoms.<br /><br />After carefully analyzing formulas of numerous dry kibble, I opted to give Pinnacle (Trout & Sweet Potato) a try, ordering a 15 pound 'starter' bag from Amazon.  In addition, I ordered some digestive enzymes to assist in the transition phase.<br /><br />The bag arrived.  I opened it with my dog assisting to see what his response would be.  The first whiff out of the bag was strong, smelling of fish.  I noted the kibble size, itself, was quite small for a large breed dog, but felt this was only a minor reservation.  The ultimate test was not what I thought about it, but what my Shiloh would.  He immediately had a positive response.  In fact --- he loves it!  He appears more enthusiastic about it than the 'Premium Edge.'<br /><br />I had to start the Pinnacle before the enzymes arrived, so I was expecting some terrible gas and possibly some diarrhea.  Well, that was not the case.  He has gone through the 15 pound bag, and half of the next order --- a 30 pound bag, with no diarrhea, or gas, at all.  In fact, his stools appear firmer and more consistent than on his previous diet.  Supplementing with the enzymes was actually not necessary.<br /><br />I'm delighted with this new regimen.  I also love that I can order a 30 pound bag through Amazon and have it delivered to my front door.  I'm now avoiding a considerable drive,  and,  the back-breaking-discomfort, of lugging around heavy bags of kibble.<br /><br />My dog is happy, and I'm happy.  That said, after an adequate therapeutic trial, I feel confident in recommending Pinnacle.

review/summary: Only thing that will settle in my Bichon's stomach
review/text: I have a Bichon Frise with a horrible stomach for keeping any food down. This was the only dog food we could find that she wouldn't throw up. It was recommended by our vet who said our Bichon just had a lot of allergies and this food was known to work well with dogs having her problems.<br /><br />It's a bunch cheaper on amazon than any local pet store we could find, and we don't have to have the trouble of lugging the 30 lb bag home.<br /><br />However, the reason for the loss of 1 star -- our dog really dislikes the taste of it. She's on a pretty tight diet to lose weight currently and still refuses to eat the food immediately when poured into her bowl. She'll sniff it on and off for about an hour before eating it. It also gives her pretty bad breath, but these are both things I can live with to eliminate the stained carpets.<br /><br />We have been using the food for over 2 years with no problems; I definitely recommend it if your dog has a sensitive stomach.

review/text: My dog, a Great Pyrenees, has a few food allergies (rice, chicken, eggs, soy, nuts) and is picky about the food he eats. I was feeding him Orijen 6-Fish and, after a few months, he decided to stop eating it.  After trying a few different foods I heard about Pinnacle Trout and Sweet Potato.  He loves it and it agrees with his digestive system.  I order it from Amazon because the price is lower than the local pet stores in my area. With Amazon Prime, it arrives in 2 days.<br /><br />Four stars because I do need to mix the last quarter of the food with the next bag (treating it like a new dog food - I didn't need to do that with Orijen 6 Fish).  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Good food for my allergy prone elderly Papillon
review/text: My elderly Papillon, Beau, has had skin allergy/itch problems for the past few years.  Maybe it's age or maybe it's the Pinnacle Trout & Sweet Potato, but he's no longer scratching himself raw.  Thank goodness!  The ingredients in this food seem really good and it's the only food I give him.

review/summary: Alternate meat source = less itchy dog
review/text: My dog started developing signs of an allergy last year - nothing overt - just noticable skin twitches when I touched her in certain areas on her back.  Unsure if her reactions were due to environment or food, but they didn't seem to be seasonal grass allergies, so I chose to test the easiest source first.  I chose a food with a completely different meat source, switching from chicken to fish.  It's only been a week and I'm already seeing improvement.  She's still showing signs of itchiness, but her reaction is much less when I pet her back.  And on top of that, her fur is softer too!  It's early yet, and there can still be some progress made, but I have no doubt that the change in food is helping.  I sat and read review after review on dog foods with in-depth ingredient analysis before settling on Pinnacle Trout & Sweet Potato.  If after 6 weeks, she still shows some signs of being itchy, I'll happily try the Salmon and Potato Grain Free variety to see if grains are a factor in her allergies as well.<br /><br />Have seen some reviews mentioning breath after eating the fish based foods.  I have to say, I haven't experienced this with my dogs.  There might be a slightly different odor to their breath, but it isn't by any means too "fishy" smelling.  Just different.  And neither dog has experienced any gasiness or changes in stool since the switch was done gradually.

review/summary: Picky Eaters Food
review/text: I have a Bichon Frise and for the longest time feeding was nothing but an endless hassle for me.  Both my dog and me would be completely stressed out because he couldn't find a food he enjoyed and I was buying tons of food that he would just stare at for hours and refuse to eat.  One day I went into a local pet food shop and they had sample packages of all the different types of foods they had and they gave me several to try out. I took them home and set them all out for my dog... he went around and sniffed at all of them but this was the one he finally went for.  A couple years of using this food later and he never seems to protest.  Thanks for making my life easier.

review/summary: Excellent food
review/text: This food is an exceptional product.  I take care of a number of dogs and am very selective about the formulation of their food.  In particular, I have one with pancreatic insufficiency, requiring a low fat content, and a little fellow who has had a bout with gastroenteritis, so needed a food with a different protein source than chicken.  Both are healthy and happy with the Pinnacle Trout and Sweet Potato.<br />The only drawback, and it does not concern the food itself, is that Amazon uses FedEx for their delivery.  Apparently, when there is a holiday on a weekend, FedEx home delivery takes extra weekdays off.  Consequently my order arrived after my kids ran out of the food they needed.  It took 4 1/2 days for FedEx to get the parcel from the Columbus, Oh area to central West Virginia.  UPS was delivering while FedEx was still holding up my shipment, as my UPS driver passed here the day before my dog food arrived.  I have spoken to Amazon corporate headquarters about the fact that it appears UPS can get the job done more efficiently.  Perhaps a UPS option is in order for those customers who would rather not use FedUP...oops..I mean FedEx.  Hey, weren't these the guys that were hurling Christmas packages out of their trucks?

Its good for all life stages, from puppy to geriatric, and I feed "ad libitum" so that their bowl is never empty.  They self-regulate their intake and this is the only food I've been able to do that with.  And they love it.

review/text: Tried this food for my adult mix that has been on a fish based diet since puppydom. I thought trout and sweet potato would be an interesting change from salmon, but nope, not really. It gets eaten, though not with any particular excitement. I think it is safe to say while my dog is indifferent to it, the ingredients and price are a plus. Spruce it up a drizzle of olive or canola oil and it gets eaten.

review/summary: Flat, dull, lacking aroma. Some options to consider
review/text: I have been drinking tea for some decades, and keeping notes to remind myself of favorites.<br /><br />Green teas usually benefit from steeping at cooler temperatures, and this Boston Tea Dragon Well is no exception. I suggest using water of 185 degrees or cooler.<br /><br />My experience with this Dragonwell was disappointing. The tea was flat and anemic. Not only was there no complexity or freshness to the aroma, the leaves simple had little fragrance at all.<br /><br />The bag I received had no packing or expiration dates. But, the lack of aroma was the first clue that the tea was long past its peak. Older tea does not become rancid, but taste and aroma diminish as packaged tea ages. For best results, search for teas with a packing date of less than six or eight months previous.<br /><br />Trying to obtain more flavor from the tea, I tried longer brewing times and even higher temperatures. More tannins were released, giving some bitterness, but flavor did not improve.<br /><br />Bottom line: I personally will be cautious of buying any Boston Tea product without learning packaging/expiration dates. Trying this Dragonwell is an inexpensive gamble, and perhaps you will receive fresher inventory than I did. However, the package I received truly deserves a rating of two stars.<br /><br />Options: I enjoy Peet's Lung Ching Dragonwell, which comes in a steel canister. And, sometimes Asian markets can yield unusual pleasures. I recently picked up Tian Hu Shan Dragon Well for just a few dollars. It was reasonably good, and certainly more flavorful than this Boston Tea product when I did a taste comparison. Good luck in your tea tastings.

review/summary: Okay-- Wait, not okay (Update)
review/text: Pros:<br />Large leaves/pieces of leaves.<br />The tea is green.<br />Low price.<br />Low levels of dust.<br />Tea is sealed in a foil-lined, heavy, paper bag, good for keeping oxidizing UV rays out.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The tea is too dark, even for a pan-fried, Chinese, green tea.  Almost oolong colored.<br />It's bitter.<br />There are stems as well as leaves.<br /><br />I bought this tea for its leaf size, price, and catechin content.  I'm pleased with this tea on at least the first two accounts.  My glass infuser kept on getting clogged with the cheap Sencha I was using; no inconvenience now.  As for the taste--this tea does not taste like Dragonwell, which I'd describe as slightly nutty flavored.  I got a superb, whole-leaf Dragonwell at Whole Foods; the only problem was that for 2 oz. the cost was about the same as for these 8 oz.<br /><br />I drink green tea for the catechin content, so I was somewhat concerned to see the tea coming out darker than expected after steeping.  If this is from fermentation and oxidation, then more of the catechins would have degraded than would have otherwise happened.  It was also bitter, which might be good if the bitterness was from a higher catechin content, but it could also be from more caffeine.  I don't want more caffeine.  And I know how to prepare this tea, and have successfully done so many times before with other brands.<br /><br />I would definitely consider buying this, but just be aware that "Finest Grade" may be hyperbole.<br /><br />-------------<br />Update:<br /><br />After drinking this tea daily (~ 2 rounded tsp., 5 infusions--it still has flavor), I started getting chronic headaches.  A dull pain in the left side of my head at multiple times during the day.  My armpits started to feel tender as well (which made me worry about my lymph nodes).  But what finally made me suspect the tea was my blueberry plant.  For around a year I have been using my leftover tea leaves to fertilize/mulch my plant.  Using the old sencha, as well as the Whole Foods dragonwell, I used to drink, the plant was healthy and made a large number of respectably-sized berries.  After adding my leftover Boston Tea, my 2+ year old plant has died.  Almost immediately (roughly two days) after adding the leaves to the soil, the blueberry plant leaves started to wilt and turn brown, then they shed.  Then the green part of the stems began to brown and dry.  My plant survived one month without watering, left in the dark in my bathtub, when I had to leave on a month-long trip and did not have anyone to plant-sit.<br /><br />I don't know if the tea was contaminated with pesticides or heavy metals or some other toxins, but I suspect so.  I AM NOT BUYING FROM BOSTON TEA EVER AGAIN!  If my hardy blueberry plant died after I had infused the leaves in water five times, how much toxin(s) did I ingest?

Still, all-in-all, I got my money's worth and would recommend it to someone who wants a classic Chinese green tea without floral or grassy notes.

review/summary: Similar to Dim Sum Tea
review/text: One of the main things that worried me before i bought my first batch of loose leaf tea was that i didn't know the taste of the tea before i bought it. This dragonwell tea is the same tea i get served when i eat dim sum back in Hawaii. It's a really light and slightly sweet tea with a mild smell. It's perfect for me because i end up drink multiple cups of tea a day and the mild taste and smell makes it possible to drink often without getting sick of it. Everyone complains and debates about the quality of the tea. Okay for a few bucks for half a pound which will last forever you know you're not getting the finest quality tea. Get that in your head before you buy this. I did and was pleasantly surprised after the first few cups.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you want a light green tea that you can drink multiple times a day at a low cost this will be perfect for you.

review/summary: Not Very Good Taste - Tea Leaves Mix of Chopped and Full Leaf
review/text: I have been living in Shanghai for over four years now, so I have a pretty good idea of what good tea tastes like. And this is not even close to good tasting tea. I drink only the best quality Long Jing Green Tea and I drink about 1.5 liters per day. But I admit that my Chinese green tea is much more expensive than this tea..<br /><br />I like my tea cold and with a little sugar. I brew my own tea in China at 180 degrees F, not hotter and not cooler. I put the tea in the microwave oven in a glass container with plastic wrap over the top of the pitcher. The plastic wrap helps maintain the heat for longer after the peak temperature has been reached. I let it brew for probably an hour until it cools down to a slightly warm temperature. I pour in one-third a cup of sugar and mix it while the tea is warm. I brew the tea leaves two times with half of the 1.5 liter bottle of water each time. Then I mix the tea together and refrigerate it for at least 24 hours, preferably 48 hours. I have found the refrigeration cycle makes the tea mellower and not bitter. Even my 56 year old Chinese fianc&eacute;e says my tea brewing method tastes better than she has ever tasted in her life. I know that refrigeration is contrary to what a lot of people think is best. But I learned this technique when I was a teenager working in a Baptist Encampment in Texas during the summer. A cook taught me that putting the huge vat of tea into a cooler for a day makes tea more mellow tasting and less bitter. And I always got great compliments way back then from the hundreds of people who drank my tea. Of course, this was just ordinary tea, not green tea. But it works the same way with green tea.<br /><br />The tea leaves in this tea do not look the same as what I buy in China, and the taste is quite different -- definitely bitterer. The Numi Tea sold here on Amazon is whole leaf and looks a lot better than these tea leaves. These tea leaves are a mix of whole leaf and confetti chopped up leaves. The taste is about the same as Numi Tea, but I will purchase the Numi brand going forward because it is 100% whole leaf and not dusty.<br /><br />I have read that the best leaves are the newly formed leaves picked from of the top of the tea tree. I have visited tea tree farms in China. Tea trees will grow into a real tree unless they are pruned to remain like a waist high tree shrub. I suspect this particular brand of tea leaves may have come from the older more mature lower branches of the tea tree. But I have no way of knowing if that is true or not. I just know it doesn't taste nearly as good as the tea leaves I purchase in China. And to be fair, the price I pay in China is considerably more than this price on Amazon.

review/text: i actually found these at a local asian grocery store, & only bought one bag. they're only 1.41 oz. - is this what people are buying here? ($1.99 locally, & i thought that was expensive)<br /><br />it would cost way too much to order them here, especially with shipping, but i saw a video with a well known chef explaining how to make them (just google crispy seaweed). i'm gonna try that - just not exactly what sure to use for the fantastic "hot & spicy" portion, or which oil to use, but i will try to duplicate.<br /><br />p.s. i doubt these would last more than 1-2 sittings.

review/summary: The beans are good--the packaging isn't
review/text: The beans are good.  But it's very hard to get the packet open and when you're running if you DO tear it on the little notch (which is hard to see) the whole side of the packet tears away and you can lose all your beans.<br /><br />Come on!  How hard is it to improve the packaging?  It's probably easier to empty them in a ziplock and carry with you.<br /><br />Do you think the manufacturers ever read the product reviews????

review/summary: Great for keeping your energy up
review/text: I'm training for my first marathon, and order a package of these after hearing good things about them on a message board about marathons.  I have to say, I've been very happy with how they work for me.  I was really having problems maintaining pace after the two hour mark, and had tried various gels, etc. but always seemed to lose about 2 minutes/mile off my pace after two hours.  It may have been training breakthrough, it may have been strictly pyschological, but after I started snacking on the beans at the 1:45 mark, I started sustaining pace, and have actually been able to knock out my last mile on the same pace as my opening mile.<br /><br />Of course, not garunteed to work for everyone, everyone's system processes these things differently, but for right now, I'm believing in the magic beans.

review/summary: Great taste less fillings
review/text: These jelly beans are great...the taste is better than most stuff on the market and they have electrolytes in them as well as carbs.  Same carb as a GU but i like the fact that you eat them as you go along. Highly recommended..haven't tried any other flavors but i bet they are all GREAT.  PS. check out Cliff Shot Blocks for a good steady carb delevery too.

review/summary: Not realy sport beans-juice jelly beans
review/text: Ok, these are not really that healthy. They are made with fruit juice which is better than corn syrup BUT they still have canuba wax and the electrolytes are added not natural and no complex carbs( you need brown rice syrup to be a complex carb and has the natural electrolytes- like in Sharkies). These leave a coating in my mouth(from the wax). These are really glorified jelly beans. I feel no energyboost and they mess up my blood sugar. If you want the real deal get sharkies.

review/summary: yummy and easy to eat
review/text: The sport beans are awesome.  I trained for a 15k running race this summer and taking the beans with me on my longer runs really helped sustain my energy.  They are easy to take along and very easy to eat.  They break down nicely in your mouth and are easily digested.  The flavors are tasty so you don't cringe when eating them during a hard run.  Also- it is a jelly bean- what better texture?!  I just moved to a tropical climate (Hawaii) and can't find them in stores here.  I need them to help with my training since it is so hot- the electrolytes and vitamins will really make a difference.  Planning on buying them on Amazon.

review/summary: Good for bad bellies
review/text: I have a very sensitive stomach and cannot use GUs. I am a long distance runner and have enjoyed these sports beans. I would recommend trying them out in the store to make sure you like the flavor (they leave a bit of an aftertaste) but if you have a sensitive belly when running, I recommend these!

review/summary: little beans-big help
review/text: I love these little sport beans.<br />First of all they taste great. Also, they are so easy to consume...not too large that they fill your mouth and make it hard to breath and swallow. Also, the benefits of these little guys truly show in your timed results; they help get you across the finish line.<br /><br />I have a tiny pouch in the sportsbottle I carry during my runs and races. I just open the package of beans when lining up at the start and tuck them in the bottle pouch. Then I pop one bean at a time in my mouth during the course of the race.<br />The flavor burst keeps my senses entertained too. And my energy level is enhanced as well (very important)!<br /><br />great product!

review/summary: Tasty Little Jelly Beans
review/text: I used these Jelly Beans to help me train for my first marathon.  They taste good and seem to work although I did not seem to get as much of a boost as some of my friends say they have. I would only eat 2-4 at a time so maybe I need to eat a few more to get the full energy boost.<br /><br />I agree with some of the other reviewers in that, although the little bag is resealable, it is still sometimes hard to open while you are jogging/running/walking.<br /><br />Nice product.

review/summary: SPORT BEANS
review/text: These beans are very tasty, and are very effective at giving me an extra boost of energy on my bike rides, and they are a good source of carbs. They are easy to eat, but if you do choose to eat them while exercising, be sure to have some water near by, as they tend to produce a lot of flem, which can be very uncomfortable while exercising.  I really enjoy these beans, and they are a convenient source of carbs and energy.

review/summary: ON THE GO GOODIES
review/text: This product has been available to runners for quite a while. The flavors are just like the Jelly Belly beans, but with a little extra kick and loaded with carbs. Very useful during those long runs when you need those carbs and potassium. Low in calories. Very convenient small packaging for your fanny pack or Fuel belt. Highly recommended and great price to boot!

review/summary: Perfect size and work well
review/text: Ever since I started marathon running I've been searching for a calorie supplement. Ive tried the gels, goos and cubes but was never satisfied. The cubes are too big and its hard to breath while chewing them. The goos and gels are just too dessicating, its like putting peanut butter in my mouth and I need to get something to drink to wash it down.<br /><br />The jelly beans are the best yet. They are smaller making it easier to breath while running. they do not dry your mouth and they also taste good, aways a plus. They provide 100 cals per pouch and contain no caffeine.<br /><br />That said it is not the perfect product. The package can be difficult to open while running and occasionally a few beans drop out as you are trying to negotiate them out of the bag and into your mouth. Also they should make a variety pack. 24 packs is enough to last me a month and I prefer to buy only one at a time. The same flavor, while good, can get a little boring. They have other flavors, a variety pack should not be too hard to make.<br /><br />Enjoy your exercise!

review/summary: Tart taste
review/text: I have been riding for about 1.5 years  (average 30 - 40 miles - 17-18 mph).  Once I got over 25 miles decided to enhance my liquid replentishment with a solid - purchased these, "GU" gel and "GU" chomps all at the same time so I could try side by side.  All appeared to have helped me from hitting the wall equally, but the gel and chops go down easier.  These beans are smaller - thus need to ingest more/more often to make same impact and are "tarter" and not as easy to swallow.  I bought I case of these so will choke them down, but of the three, I like the chomps better.  Ride safe

review/summary: Easy to Chew and Carry
review/text: Of Chomps, Shot Bloks, and Honey Stingers, these beans are best because they a) don't melt or get messy, and, b) are easiest to chew (no major jaw-action required to get through them).<br /><br />All the flavors I've tried so far are totally fine.<br /><br />I just empty the pack into my pocket or bra or whatever and scoop out the beans as needed while racing. I've tried this with the more gelatinous other varieties of sports candy but those make anywhere from a small mess to a big one, and they tend to clump together. Plus, its too effortful to get your teeth through gummy candy like that. Sports Beans are pretty perfect.

review/summary: Anti-bonking!
review/text: These are great.  They taste good.  Buying the quantity of course comes with the discount.  I think the expiration on them is like a year out.  They are great for energy when out there for an extended period of time.  Of course, I only use them like I use Gatorade, only if I am exercising (biking, running, etc) for 2+ hours.  I like them because it gives me the energy to keep going, but instead of eating something that sits in my stomach and weighs me down, these don't do this, niceeeee.  They are well worth it to me.  With these and Cliff Bars, I can just keep goin.

review/summary: Distance Runner in Love!
review/text: As a marathon runner and lover of long distance, I've found my match. Lemon-lime Jelly Belly Sport Beans are really one of the best electrolyte products. I just stick them in my pocket and without a lot of fuss (or pace change), I can grab them on the go. Many sport nutrition "candies" are nasty tasting - when you're exercising you can somehow gulp it down. But the Jelly Belly Sport Beans are actually good whether exercising or not! Conveniently, they come in a resealable pouch that keeps extra beans fresh and secure when bouncing around.

review/summary: doesn't melt in the sun!
review/text: I've been living and riding in Florida for 6 years and came across Sport Beans as a great alternative to PowerBars, Gels, Blocks and Gu's a few years or so ago.  They are great.  Not a ton of energy - only 70 - 100 calories per pack, but they restore some electrolytes and they don't make a mess of your pockets or fuel packs.  Sport Beans hold up in the heat of summer and that is a great thing!!
