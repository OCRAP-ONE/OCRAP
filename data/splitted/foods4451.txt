review/summary: The way oatmeal was meant to be: sensual, not pasty
review/text: You will look at instant oatmeal with scorn and disgust once you have enjoyed slow-cooked steel cut oats. There is nothing especially magical about the McCann version of this---you can get steel cut oats in bulk in practically any store that sells organic cereals and grains---but this brand remains my nostalgic favorite since I was introduced to these in childhood. Cooks beautifully in about 20 minutes without stirring or intervention of any kind if you use a double boiler.  Or better yet, load it into a programmable rice cooker the night before. The nutty, chewy texture is essential to the experience, and in that regard, the double boiler approach delivers a somewhat crunchier end result than my rice cooker, which creates a softer, more porridge-like oatmeal, due to the longer presoak and cooking time involved with the night-before approach.<br /><br />The cans keep quite a long time unopened---at least a year or two if the freshness dates are to be believed--- but I find the grains start to taste a littel stale or musty if you keep an open can more than a month or two.

review/summary: Strange petroleum odor in the can
review/text: Let me start off by saying that I adore McCann's Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal. I've been eating it for breakfast for years and have not had any trouble and have been ordering it through Amazon until I got this shipment of cans through the efooddepot. When I opened the first can, I smelled a strong petroleum odor and thought that maybe it was something new they were doing with the lining of the can.<br /><br />I cooked up a batch and found I could taste petroleum and decided to throw it all out.<br /><br />Buyer beware - I recommend that you order smaller quantities than I did (6 cans) and save your money in case the odor is in more than my 6 cans.<br /><br />This is an update:<br />I bought some cans in a local grocery store and they smelled fine. I noted the difference in the gold color of the paint on the cans when I put them side by side with the smelly ones. See the images here: [...]

review/summary: Hard to Find!
review/text: It's hard to find the real, long cook variety of McCanns in my area, glad its available on Amazon [though yes, expensive and the shipping is high].<br /><br />This traditional type yeilds an oatmeal with less of the 'sludge' than the quick cook McCanns or any of the rolled oat products. Simply superior taste and texture.<br /><br />I like starting it the night before, adding whatever sounds good at the moment-- chopped apples or pears, cinnamon, maple syrup or molasses, toasted almonds or pecans, etc.<br /><br />But even if you don't do it in advance, it takes no longer to cook than a lot of other breakfast foods.<br /><br />Mine arrived with only one can slightly dented, sorry to hear others have had such issues.

It takes a little time to cook, but anything worthwhile takes a little time. You won't find it cheaper anywhere else. If you want good oatmeal, with the health benefits that go with it, try McCann's. Add some brown sugar, golden raisens, butter and cream to it and you'll lose half the health benefits but be happier for it. Bon appetit!

review/summary: It doesn't get better then this. Make a huge pot, eat for a week!!
review/text: I use my pressure cooker to make a huge pot of this in about 20 minutes. I use a half milk/half water mixture to cook, add some vanilla extract, bring it to a simmer, add the oats to the mix, and cover the pressure cooker. Let it go about 15 minutes, take it off the fire and let the pressure die down. I then take out the amount we are ready to eat that day and add raisins and a bit of equal, splenda or brown sugar-depending upon who is eating....YUMMM. I then put the rest in a giant container in the fridge, and each day of the week, I just have to microwave whatever we want to eat, add raisins and a bit of milk, something to sweeten it a bit and enjoy. Sometimes, I add fruit, cinnamon whatever I happen to have in the house ...A great way to start the day with very minimal cleanup and work on the busy weekdays.

review/summary: Outstanding!
review/text: I love the taste and the texture of these steel cut oats, but they can be somewhat of a labor of love to prepare.  It can take about 35 minutes to cook them from start to finish, with lots of stirring of the pot and keeping track of exactly how the heat is regulated on your stove.  I have made them the "long" way many times.  The taste is absolutely wonderful and the texture is quite pleasing.  I have also soaked the oats in water overnight and then cooked them the next morning which reduces the cooking time to about 10 minutes for me.  Still the same wonderful taste, but this method loses quite a lot of the whole grain sensation in the mouth.<br /><br />I was in the market for a rice cooker and while investigating them I noticed that some have a setting for porridge.  When I made my choice of the Panasonic SR-DE103 rice cooker it was partially because I wanted to use it to cook these oats.  The only drawback is that the rice cooker will only cook two servings at a time because the oats foam and bubble up so much during cooking.  Any more than two servings and they will be bubbling out of the steam vent of the cooker!  It also takes one hour to cook those two servings, but I can be off doing other things while the cooker takes care of the oats.  The oats cooked in the rice cooker have the same taste and texture as those cooked for the 35 minute method on the stove.<br /><br />This product is delightful.  I do add a tiny pinch of salt during the cooking time.  They are wonderful with either white sugar, brown sugar, honey, maple syrup, butter, or just completely unadorned.  And, which is very important, a serving of these steel cut oats stick with me and I don't find myself wanting to eat a second breakfast two hours later.  One serving lasts until lunch time and beyond (if I'm really busy).  Any leftovers also keep well in a bowl in the refrigerator and warm up nicely in the microwave.  Just an all around great product.

review/summary: Cooking time
review/text: So, I've been a heavy user of this oatmeal.  I don't know how many would agree with me, but I find a 30 min cooking time unnecessary.  I cook it on the stovetop for 17-18 min after coming to a boil.  It is done.  But you have to use a bit less water too - use about 3x water instead of 4x.<br /><br />I really like the extra texture that this short cooking provides.  If you find it a bit hard at first, leave it stading for a couple of minutes and it will soften more.  Ever since I've found I don't have to spend 30 minutes to obtain great taste, it saved so much time!  Try it!<br /><br />Unrelatedely, the price on Amazon has not become competitive enough to order 4 cans, even with the 15% discount.  WF have lowered their prices and I now buy it there.

review/text: We have loved Quaker Oats for years and years, and will not cast any negative words bout it.  Always ready to try something new, we ordered the McCann's Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal and are not disappointed. The oatmeal has wonderful flavor, is mouth-satisfyingly chewy, and like the old friend Quaker Oats, sticks to the ribs.  You can't rush it ... it takes a good 30 minutes to cook, but it is worth the wait.  Read the contatiner for a short cut.  We've since cut the recipe in half giving just enough for the both of us.  (the full recipe is four servings)  A hearty recommendation for this project.

review/summary: Delicious, healthy, easy to prepare, versatile
review/text: After many years of eating Quaker Oats, I purchased McCann's and haven't looked back. I didn't know such a modest dish could taste so incredibly good. On Sunday nights I use the short cut method (on the side of the can)which requires one minute of cooking and then storage in the fridge until the following morning. I cook a medium pot which lasts us all week. Just heat them up for about 10 minutes on low (or microwave on medium high) and you have the best oatmeal on the planet. I frequently charge it up with dried cranberries, fresh frozen blueberries, strawberries, chunks of apple and cinnamon and even chopped nuts, sunflower seeds and ground flax seeds. This oatmeal is not mushy but neither is it hard. The texture is chewy and the flavor is awesome. My husband and I are hooked and keep our cupboard well stocked with this healthy breakfast food. We even eat it as a light snack at night with a bit of maple syrup when we crave something sweet. For anyone who loves oatmeal, this is the one to try.

review/text: After having gastric bypass surgery, one needs to be able to get in a lot of protein, and the best way, at the beginning is through protein shakes. Nearly ALL varieties of protein shakes are not palatable for me, and I'm sure I'm not the only one. HOWEVER, Click Mocha makes it so good for me. I'm able to make a 16 oz shake every morning with one scoop click, and then one scoop of another brand chocolate protein shake mixed in. This gets me to almost 50 grams of protein, in one shake! And it's wonderful! It does not have the typical protein shake taste, and it doesn't seem too caffeinated. As a person with gastric bypass, I do have to be careful with the caffeine intake because of the potential for an ulcer, but I've been fine. Again, I can't say enough wonderful things about this protein shake, it's absolutely wonderful! And the weight has been DROPPING off now that I've been able to get the appropriate amount of protein in every day.

review/text: Out of all of the protein drinks I have ever had, this one is by far the best.  I have only prepared the drink two ways so far but when it is mixed with water and ice in a blender, it is really good.  When I make it again, I will add my Weight Watchers 2 Points Plus chocolate drink packet.  I will be getting a serving of milk then, too.  For 3 Points Plus a serving, this is a great snack/recovery drink/indulgence.  I have not tried the drink hot and I don't plan on it.  The only drawback I found was when I made the drink with just water (following the directions) I did get a ton of clumps.  I shook the container for about 25 seconds, too.  But, all in all, it is a great drink after a hard workout for some good protein.

review/summary: OMG! YUM!
review/text: This is the only protein shake I have ever had that tastes like the flavor it's named after. The Syntrex Nectars come close (most of them, anyway), but OMG! I could drink this stuff all day! I mix the powder in 4oz milk, then add 8oz boiling water. No lumps, clumps, or yucky floaters. The stats aren't as good as other protein shakes I drink (12g carbs, 15g protein), but to me, it's worth it, because I would be drinking a Starbucks vanilla latte otherwise.

review/text: I wanted to try a protein drink for the first time and this is what I chose. It sounded good since I love my coffee drinks. Unfortunately I can not mix it well enough. It is gritty and has a film on top. I tried it hot and cold with no success. The taste is good just not the consistency. It might be good as a frozen drink in the blender but I cant try it because I don't own a blender.

review/text: I bought this item in 'Mocha' flavor and it is YUMMYYY! It replaces my daily morning coffee and it especially good after a workout. I find it quite strong (for me), so sometimes I mix it with another protein powder for less caffeine and more protein (a scoop of this one has 15g protein). I'll be buying it over and over, it tastes delicious and doesn't have that weird protein taste some powders have. It's amazing, even if it clumps a little when I don't use the blender and mix it with milk. Expensive for me since I am in Canada, but totally worth it!

review/summary: Best Protein Shake!
review/text: I have tried other protein shakes and have given up on them because they were disgusting and messy. This is the first protein shake that I drink every morning before I go to the gym and I enjoy it. It keeps me from feeling hunger & it gives me the necessary energy to keep going. I especially love to mix milk with a tablespoon of Sugar Free "International delight" & a bit of cooled brewed coffee. Its also makes a great hot coffee drink. The trick so it doesn't get lumpy when heated is to mix the powder as best as you can before putting it in the microwave. Its simply Delicious! I love it! Plus I have signed up to have "Click Espresso Protein Drink" delivered monthly to my door. That way I never run out.

review/text: I've tried a LOT of different protein powders and this is by far my favorite. I'm a coffee addict, I admit it, coffee AND chocolate without a lot of guilt? Sign me up. This does have a bit more carbs than some protein but I only have one a day, and it fits in with my carb count for the day. I also prefer mine made with milk (I use Hood Calorie Countdown for the lower carb count) than with water, but it is also good with water. It's also good hot or cold. During the winter, it felt almost like a nice, warm treat when I heated it up according to directions.<br /><br />I get this item by subscribe and save now, two canisters once a month. It's one of my absolute 'must have' items.

When i saw this product, i was so delighted to see a coffee protein drink. I mix it with my 8oz. skim milk, 1 scoop of chocolate protein, 1 scoop of the Click product shake in my shaker cup, then put 2 pumps of my DaVinci caramel syrup. Shake again, and i am in heven. It totals approx 40 some grams of protein for 1 meal. that is great.

I feel full when I drink this in the morning ;) I plan to continue drinking this for the next couple of months or longer...

review/text: This is worth the try - it is so much healthier than a regular mocha and the chocolate flavor is excellent!  I do recommend using a blender (I use my Magic Bullet) for about 30-60 seconds to blend it all together.  That makes it so creamy you can't tell it was from a powder.  I make this for breakfast every day and I don't get hungry for about three hours, which is AWESOME from something with only 120 Calories!  I've also got my sister hooked on this stuff.  It is really worth the money (especially compared to purchasing a mocha). This tastes sweet and nothing at all like a protein drink.

review/text: I purchased it like two weeks ago and received the product in less than a week. It tastes really good without the chalky taste that most protein shakes leave. I tried the samples first and they were good. I bought this I can mix it with my GNC lean shake and add to the taste, b/c the gnc shake leave an after taste in my mouth so i had to get something to add to it to drown the taste and this does the trick. I don't like the fact that it lacks fiber, but u can add that in if u want with disolvable fiber powder. It's tasty, low in calories, and I will buy again before I run out!!!

review/summary: Click Vanilla
review/text: I'm a bariatric patient so it's important that I supplement my protein for the rest of my life. Imagine my dismay when I discovered that I couldn't tolerate most protein drinks!<br />I then discovered Click Vanilla (the mocha was too coffee tasting for me).<br />Since a lot of sugars bother me I only use one scoop of Click mixed with one scoop of Any Whey unflavored protein powder. This ups the protein while lowering the sugar grams. To this mixture I add about 1/4 envelope of Diet Swiss Miss with 8-9 ounces of water in a blender cup. After mixing I pour into a coffee mug, microwave for about 1 minute add 1 splenda and a tiny bit of SF creamer, mini moo or SF syrup. This is soooo good! Love the taste, love the little bit of caffeine it gives me but most of all love the fact that it is very healthy for me and a great way to start off my day.<br />Thanks Click for keeping me clickin' along. :)

review/text: I'm hooked on CLICK Espresso Protein drink, Mocha.  I actually drink it every morning on my way to work. Experiment with it by adding more protein, extracts, flavored syrups amd it's great in the blender with ice.

review/summary: Excellent Protein Mix
review/text: I'm a gastric bypass surgery patient as of 9/1/2010.  I have tried a few protein powders, but I could not stand the taste, the grit, or the overwhelming smell.  This is an answer to my prayers.  I'm mixing it with soy milk (which adds 6 more grams of protein) and either water or coffee and then heating it.  I'm even cutting it with more water or coffee than directed because it is, as almost all of the proteins have been, very strong in flavor.  But, this is a flavor I can stand.  And no icky smell.  I loved my flavored drinks from the coffee houses as well as flavored creamers that I used at home in my coffee.  This pretty much does it for me.  I'm getting closer to making my daily goal of protein intake for the first time since surgery and it does not seem like a hopeless task for me anymore.  Have only had the mocha, but this time I'm ordering more of that as well as the vanilla flavor and I'm looking forward to trying that.

review/summary: VERY good! Does NOT taste like a protein shake!
review/text: First of all, as with ALL protein shakes, you really should test out different amounts of water vs. powder to see what tastes best to you.  I have discovered that I typically like a more watery shake (less powder) than what the manufacturers recommend.  Some people can look at this as a negative, since you would need to drink 2x the liquid to get the same nutritional value for "one serving," but if you're trying to loose weight, sipping throughout the day isn't a bad thing.  As far as this shake goes, using two full scoops taste like a strong version of International Foods Sugar Free Vanilla Latte Instant Coffee.  Anyway, here is what works for me:<br /><br />1.  16oz cold water & a few ice cubes<br />2.  one scoop of Click powder<br />3.  Combine in my 20oz Venti Starbucks reusable cold-cup.  Put lid on without straw, place finger over hole for straw, shake vigorously. Remove lid, replace straw, ENJOY!<br /><br />In my opinion, drinking this shake this way is REALLY delicious and taste just like iced coffee. It does NOT have the typical protein shake flavor and aftertaste at all.  I just wish they made a decaffeinated version so I could drink it all day long!<br /><br />Unfortunately, I didn't really enjoy this shake hot, but I'm going to continue experimenting with that and update my review accordingly!

review/summary: Awesome coffee flavor!
review/text: I am another gastric bypass patient, always on a search for the best tasting protein supplements. CLICK Vanilla Latte Flavor Protein Drink is the BEST tasting protein I have ever had! Normally, I make my own espresso and mix it with my vanilla protein drink of the day. I always have to add several espresso shots and sugar-free vanilla syrup to get that great coffee-house flavor; not so with CLICK! This tastes as good as any $4.00 latte I've ever had, but with all the additional protein I need to maintain my healthy lifestyle. And the texture is wonderful, no grit or clumps! I have found my morning coffee fix! Thanks, CLICK!!

review/text: I had Gastric bypass a little over a year ago and ever since have been having a really hard time finding a protein drink that agreed with me. Either they tasted completely awful or they made me sick to my stomach. After reading the reviews on Amazon for Click, I ordered the Click Vanilla Latte flavor and crossed by fingers that it would live up to the good reviews. I am here today to say this drink is awesome! There is no heavy protein flavor and it doesn't make me feel sick after drinking it. I would recommend this product to everyone who loves the flavor of a good latte!

I drink mine w/ 2 scoops & 12 oz of water mixed in a blender bottle with a few ice cubes or I will give 8 oz water/calorie countdown milk a whir in my bullet-esque blender with a few ice cubes for an icy treat.<br /><br />If you're looking for a protein boost, add 1 scoop of click & 1 scoop of higher protein powder.  The wonderful taste of the Click will make most any other nasty powder bearable!

review/summary: Doesnt taste like a protein shake
review/text: I'm a gastric bypass patient and tried many different protein powders until I found Click. Theres no taste of protein. It tastes like an expensive coffee drink and gives me just enough caffiene to get me going in the morning. The only thing that could be better is if it contained more protein. I mix mine with 14 oz milk which adds 14 grams of protein and add 1/3 cup dry nonfat powdered mild which adds another 8 grams of protein. I like this so much that I use Amazons auto shipping option and get two tubs a month with free shipping and a discount.

review/summary: Best Coffee Protein Powder
review/text: I really like this prtoein powder a lot! Although the grams of protein are considerably less than Syntrax Nectar's capuccinno flavor (24g in Nectar vs 15g in Click) Click's taste is far superior!<br /><br />Pros: Taste, taste and taste! Mixes well with other ingedients (I have added fat-free half&half, non-fat milk, peppermint syrup, sugar free vanilla syrup, caramel syrup and all have mixed well with this powder)<br /><br />Cons: Light on protein content, Carbs a little high for those watching carbs, Mixability (many posters agree that it still has lumps even after vigorous shaking/mixing), Volume in the can versus the price (especially if youre someone who consumes one or more of these per day like me...it goes VERY quickly)<br /><br />I have decided to have this on auto-ship (knocks price down to 17.00). Overall a very good option for those of us who love our coffee and need to get some extra protein in!

Click (in either flavor!) is a flavorful, healthy protein source that keeps me going through long shifts at work or when I just need an energy burst.  I can honestly say that I have found no other product that does this much for me and doesn't break the bank!  I am thrilled that the peeps at Click added the Vanilla Latte flavor.  As much as I liked the original Mocha flavor, I LOVE the Vanilla Latte flavor that much more.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!  :)

review/summary: great taste but high carbs
review/text: Most protein drinks make me gag but the Click drinks taste great, and I think the Vanilla Latte flavor is not as cloyingly sweet as the Mocha. I still have to doctor it for flavor, as I find I have to do for all protein drinks, but that's me.<br /><br />I usually blend them with a small amount of NF milk, a big spoonful of NF yogurt, water, and a chunk - about 1/4-1/3 - of banana...fantastic taste, better than a Starbucks Frappuccino. But, darn, the high carbs :-( Carbs derail my weight loss and I can't "spend" that many carbs to get the amount of protein Click contains. If you don't care about the carb content, drink away. If you do, there is another great protein drink (no caffeine kick, which can be good or bad, though you can always make it with coffee): Great Protein at [...] low carbs, low sugars, high protein, and I can actually drink it.

review/summary: Honestly, If you like coffee and need more protein, this is it
review/text: I don't write too many reviews, but after trying Click I thought I would share a review in the hopes that it sways some people to try it. I first must admit I'm a 20-something guy who has tried a number of protein products in my day, some good, most bad to terrible. My personal favorite is muscle milk light due to its flavor and ease of mixing. After trying Click, I can't imagine a better protein drink early in the morning. The flavor is excellent (I prefer Vanilla Latte over Mocha personally) and it mixes with ease. Great in water or milk. Recently I've been blending it in the morning with Almond Milk and a few ice cubes and it's awesome. I usually don't like Vanilla Latte drinks at Starbucks because the vanilla is overpowering but not with this mix.  It's really not even accurate to call it "Vanilla Latte". I think its just an improved Mocha flavor, which is what I'd prefer. 15 grams of protein in the morning helps curb your appetite and its also low in sugar in fat which is usually a problem with protein drinks.  Biggest problem I can find is that Click is clearly being marketed towards women given the bright pink/purple canister and female stick figure on the label.  Honestly, this is a product that both health conscience men and women should be happy to use in the morning. Right now I don't know another company that is offering a product like this (Muscle Milk has a coffee flavor but it's not as good) and given how important breakfast is to a healthy diet and a weight loss plan, Click is a great addition to your pantry. The price is fair, especially since you'll get a discount through Amazon.  If your interested in losing weight, give Click a try. It's less than you'll pay for a week of bagels and coffee at Starbucks and a whole lot healthier for you.

review/summary: Awesome breakfast for coffee lovers
review/text: I drink this most mornings to help me with my protein intake. It is delicious and so easy to prepare. I shake it up in a bottle then pour it in my coffeecup and stick in the microwave for a minute and walla! Instant breakfast...perfect for anyone on the go.
