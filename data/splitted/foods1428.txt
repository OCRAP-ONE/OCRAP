review/summary: Yummie coffee fix
review/text: I was thrilled to see that Amazon carried Martinson coffee, a fixture in my household growing up. Now that I live in Florida, I was taking an empty suitcase with me when I went to New Jersey to visit my daughter and filling it with Martinson coffee to import to Florida.  I'm sure TSA is worried.  I know my daughter is. Thank you Amazon and Martinson for helping me with my coffee hoarding.  Now would you mind offering the cans?  Thank you so much.

review/text: I think all of us Keurig owner's are looking for a better, make that cheaper:), alternative to the original k-cup. So far I have tried San Francisco Bay (ech), Broklyn's (not crazy about it) and now this one - Martinson Variety Pack (the best one yet). Tried all the different blends except the Hazelnut (not looking for a flavored coffee), and I would buy any of them on their own. Much better to me than the others:)<br />Really looking forward to trying the Brown Gold variety pack by this same company - if Amazon ever does get any in stock that is!

review/text: Tried the new coffee by Martinsons because I needed something new. Every cup I tried seems to have a lot of coffee dust and sludge on the bottom the cup. I know that some of these k-cups do that but it seemed much more than usual. I think the filter is not filtering the coffee properly and allowing the finer grounds to get through.

Can get two large glasses out of one k-cup use the middle setting and both glasses are GREAT far better than any you can buy at the store and way easier than brewing sun tea or stove top tea. Get a small box and try it, The stuff is the BEST,think that the name "PERFECT TEA" is perfect can not get any better.

review/summary: It's a Matter of Taste
review/text: OK, so some people like it, some people don't. I'm one of those who was excited about the prospect of getting iced tea from my Keurig, but was sorely disappointed by the taste from this tea.  It had a very artificial flavor, much like instant tea, and was no comparison to actual brewed iced tea.  I can only recommend getting the smallest box you can to see if it suits you.  Like the other reviewer, I can't bring myself to use what's left, and will probably end up throwing it out at some point.  My husband agreed, and he's a big iced tea drinker...and not all that picky about the taste.  He won't drink it, I won't drink it, and the cat won't drink it, so out it goes.  I do want to add that I use the hot teas and have liked them very much (especially the green tea).  There's just something about the iced flavors that don't work.

review/summary: Tastes like Nestea instant powder
review/text: I really wanted to like this tea. I drink a lot of ice tea in the summer, but hate taking up a lot of shelf space in the refrigerator. I always drink unsweetened tea, fairly strong. I was pleased that this tea came out strong enough that I could add more ice and even some water, but I was disappointed in the flavor. To me it tastes exactly like Nestea instant tea powder. Yuck!<br />I am thinking about trying some of the "sweet tea" options, but if they are just sweet flavors over the same yucky base, I don't think it would be an improvement.<br />Stick to putting a tea bag in a glass and boiling some water through your Keurig.

I was looking for a K-cup tea for iced tea and thought I'd give this one a shot since it claims Perfect Iced Tea. I am sorry I did. It is bitter and has a strong floral taste. I've tried different settings on my brewer and even extra ice and water in it and I still can't make it taste right. I like my iced tea stronger than my family but this one is even too strong for me. It's also "cloudy" and looks like "swamp water".  I think I'll go back to making iced tea with Celestial English Breakfast Blend. It won't make as big a glass but it's not as over powering.

They brew a stron enough tea that as it melts the ice you brew it over, it still tastes like tea when it's done - not watered down.  They'd be "perfect" if they were less expensive, and if Keurig came up with a way to make them compostable (like making them from corn products, maybe?).  I hate that I'm throwing away this little piece of plastic every day.

review/summary: Fast and easy iced tea
review/text: Now that Spring is here I find I'm craving iced tea again.  Since I make tea for one this is an easy way to do it and still produce great tasting tea.  I brew mine on the largest Keurig water setting (it makes about 1/� cups of brewed tea) and sweeten it with a half teaspoon of simple syrup which I keep in container in the fridge.  With ice, this mixture makes about 1 and a half tall glasses of tea - adding a healthy squeeze of lemon, of course.<br />I'd actually stored my Keurig away a couple years ago because I prefer brewing my own coffee, I find it far superior to the coffee produced by the K-cups (maybe I just haven't found the right blend yet).  Now I have a renewed use for my Keurig!<br />Edited to add:  It's fascinating to read the reviews for this product in the two-pack version; amazingly, it gets super high reviews while this SAME PRODUCT in the single box gets ratings that are poor.  Huh?

review/summary: Good For Iced Tea
review/text: I use this to make iced tea for each meal, even breakfast!  The tea quality is above average and has no "Nestea" taste--I hate instant tea and can tell it in a heartbeat.  This single person quantity of iced tea works great and I don't have a half pitcher of normally brewed tea go "off" before I can finish it.  The iced tea is fresh for each meal.  I just brew it on the largest setting for the Keurig without ice using a 4 cup measuring cup.  After brewing, I add about a cup of ice to the measuring cup and use it as my table pitcher.  It is fairly strong right out of the machine so a little water in the glass before pouring in the tea makes it just the right consistency.

review/summary: Very disappointing!
review/text: I was very excited to try these to save money, rather than stopping for an iced tea on my way into the office. I've tried various ways of brewing: 8 oz setting into ice, combining two 6 oz settings over ice...nothing helps. These are bitter, and don't really even taste like tea. I can't force myself to use them, and I'm generally not picky about tea as long as I can sweeten the heck out of it. Nothing helps these!

review/summary: Amy's Light in Sodium Lentil Soup vs. Amy's Low Salt Lentil Soup - 2 Different Soups
review/text: I loved<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G176CI">Amy's Organic Lentil Vegetable Low Salt Soup, 14.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>so much that I ordered a second case. When I recieved it, I found that I'd ordered something different. It was not exactly the same as the soup I'd been enjoying so much. Turned out what I ordered was this one- Amy's LIGHT IN SODIUM Organic Lentil Soup, The LIGHT was very good, but the LOW SALT was even better and the one I prefered in taste,texture and ingredients. And it wasn't just the small difference in the sodium levels per serving - LOW SALT at 340mg, the LIGHT at 290mg - you could always add a tiny bit more or doctor it up if you want with pepper, or Mrs. Dash no salt seasonings - this one just did not seem as thick and hearty(LOW SALT seemed more like a stew and had ingredients the LIGHT did not have). LOW  has tomatoes and spinach which really adds something extra.And really I found that it needed no doctoring up at all.<br /><br />I liked the Light in Sodium and would recommend it as well to anyone looking to reduce their sodium intake. All Amy's soups are great and made with all organic ingredients. The Lentil soups are also a good source of protien and dietary fiber. They are also a good source of Vit A,and Iron. O Cholesterol, low fat and low sugar as well.<br /><br />You can check the nutritional info(click on link on detail page) and also see all the ingredients and decide for yourself which you want to try, but I wanted to let everyone considering know that there are 2 different lower sodium lentil soups. I prefered the LOW SALT.It just had that little something extra - I rated that one with 5 stars.<br /><br />Also - I found that buying them here by the case saves quite a bit as compared to the individual cans at my local market. You may though, want to try one can of each from your market before deciding on an entire case.<br /><br />Remember to breathe, eat healthy and enjoy.....Laurie

review/summary: Fantastic Vegetarian Soup Option
review/text: Oh goodness.  I love lentils, I eat them all the time.  I love red lentils, green lentils, those fancy french lentils with the shiny exterior.  I eat them in soups, in curries, as dips.<br /><br />This -soup- is my favorite application of the lentil to date.  I just love the way it tastes.  It's not spicy, but it's so flavorful.  The lentils are just the right texture, not mushy, just perfect.  I like to eat this poured straight into the bowl, and I like to eat it over rice.  I love it as a protein packed lunch item, and I love it as a side dish for my dinners.<br /><br />It's not too salty like most canned soups are- and it's not terribly thick like most canned lentil soups are (yes, I'm looking at you progresso!).  Plus, it's Amy's which means you can thank them for being organic, for never including Genetically Modified Anything in them.  This is not my favorite price point for Amy's soups.  I can usually find them locally for about 2$ a can, without a sale.<br /><br />Personally, and I may be lentil biased- I think this is the best Amy's soup. :)

review/text: I've purchased several Amy's soups. This is by far my favorite. Only complaint would be that they should take out maybe half of the sodium (from sea salt, or salt by any other name).<br />I might try experimenting with adding some bulk lentils to reduce the sodium. Still gets 5 stars in my book because the taste is excellent.

review/text: This is delicious and nutritious soup which we ordered after ordering and being pleased with the Tomato soup.  BUT 9 of the 12 cans arrived badly dented!  I submitted a review on packaging with a photo of the 9 cans, thinking I would hear back promptly from someone at Amazon or at Amy's company, but so far nothing.  I was not able to find another way to communicate, so perhaps this will get a reply.  The outer carton was perfect and the shipment included a book which was also undamaged.  The 12 cans had been shrink-wrapped on a tray and were o.k. to look at until you unwrapped them.  I don't know how 9 of the 12 could be so badly dented without anyone being aware.  I will be happy to e-mail a photo if someone will give me instructions.  Thanks!

So many other bully stick sellers on Amazon advertise 6" and send you 4" instead, others advertise "thick" and just take hollowed out ones that make them look thick and send to you when there's actually less to it than a regular bully stick.

I also use it on crackers and fused in with my homemade biscuits. Everyone that has tried food that I make with this cheese has asked me what brand of cheese i was using because it is so good. I get it from my grocery store, so i don't have anything to say about the online dealer. But at my grocery store this cheese is always very fresh. It holds up very good in my fridge for sometimes weeks at a time. I would recommend this blue cheese to everyone who likes or doesn't like blue cheese because it is so good.

review/summary: Horrible
review/text: This is the worst split pea soup I have ever tasted. There are way too many onions... I usually like a lot of onions in soup, but this was ridiculous. There were more onions than peas! It tasted more like I was eating onion soup with "split pea" flavor. On top of that, the onions did not even taste fresh, they were bitter. Amy's usually makes great products, but they desperately need to change this soup. I give it 2 stars only because it is healthy, and there might be a small chance of someone liking this if they like tons of onions.<br /><br />Walnut Acres' Split Pea soup used to be perfect, but they changed their recipe recently after I reviewed it. It is still ok and still tastes better than Amy's Split Pea.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKZLJY">Walnut Acres Organic Soups, Split Pea, Fat Free, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Okay but not the best of the MTR soups
review/text: The MTR line of soups in the handy and easy-to-store shelf-stable retort pouches is generally of good quality.  The Mixed Vegetable Italian Style soup is a mild tomato and vegetable broth with a few pieces of overcooked pasta and some small chunks of potato and pieces of cabbage, beans, and peas.  Overall, nothing to get excited about.<br /><br />It's very easy to make-- just boil 500ml (0.5 liter or about 2 cups) of water in a pot, add the contents of the pouch, and stir a little with a wooden spoon.  I used it as a base and added leftover peas, carrots, and corn and pasta but I do think the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UURF5W">MTR Hot & Sour Clear Soup</a> is better for this purpose.<br /><br />Ingredients:  tomato, edible starch, potato, carrot, cabbage, khol khol, beans, peas, sugar, salt, onion, macaroni, refined sunflower oil, garlic, and pepper.<br /><br />Khol khol is more universally referred to as kholrabi, a vegetable in the cabbage family that looks much like a turnip.<br /><br />This soup is vegetarian and appears to be vegan but is not labelled as such.  The nutrition information is per serving at five to a packet but two or three servings would be much more realistic as it makes less than three cups of soup and a little over half a cup per serving is not realistic unless you serve it in a teacup.<br /><br />Calories 35<br />Calories from fat 5<br />Total fat 0.5g<br />Saturated fat 0g<br />Trans fat 0g<br />Cholesterol 0mg<br />Sodium 600mg<br />Total carbohydrate 6g<br />Dietary Fiber 0g<br />Sugars 1g<br />Protein less than 0g<br />Vitamin A 4%<br />Vitamin C 6%<br />Calcium 0%<br />Iron 0%<br /><br />The primary nutritional criticism is the high sodium content--each package contains about 3.0g of sodium.  It even tastes a bit salty.

review/text: I was in an Italian restaurant in Atlantic City and this was the olive oil they had on the tables.  Of course, I couldn't find it in my local grocery store so I found it online here and bought it.  It's such a great tasting olive oil...so rich and flavorful...I absolutely love it.  When I compared it to the normal store bought brand, there was no comparison...the taste was so much better.  I save it for special recipes when I'm cooking and always use it when dipping bread.

review/summary: Justin Time
review/text: After a balanced growing season and unchallenging harvest, Justin's `09 cabernet was matured for 16 months in French and American oak, 33% of it new.<br /> In the glass, this wine is a not-quite opaque ruby red. It features aromas of black fruits, with a vanilla note from the oak. Surprisingly, there were almost no legs.<br /> It's taste offers up red and black cherries and red currents, although the fruit is somewhat recessive, and is reflective of Justin's preference for an old-world style, rather than what one might usually expect from the Central Coast. The wine is nicely tannic, with a medium finish.<br /> This food-friendly wine would work well with Yankee Pot Roast, Creole Pork Chops, or Chicken Cacciatore.

review/summary: Hands down, the best cajun seasoning.  Ever.
review/text: I was a Tony Chachere's fan for a long time, so I wasn't about to be swayed by someone's claim that Konriko was better. The nerve! But one day, the grocery store was out of TC's. I had to have something, so I bought Konriko's. And I've never gone back.  I now have to order it online at unheard of prices because the grocery store no longer carries it, but I do so because it really is the best. It's the perfect blend of salt, spiciness, and FLAVOR. I've tried other cajun and creole seasonings that were saltier or hotter (or both--I'm talking to you, Tony Chachere's More Spice!), but none were tastier. Makes the best blackened chicken.

review/text: The description is misleading. Mushrooms are from China, not from Italy. That is why they are much cheaper that all others available.<br />I wouldn't order them if I knew they are from China.<br />Mushrooms has 10 times or more pollutants than in their environment.<br />And China is well known for its pollution and loose purity control.<br />Regarding quality, some pieces are damaged by worms and some<br />are from specimens that are two old and overgrown.<br />The taste, though, is good and proper.

review/text: I give this coffee 5 stars based on the price/quality ratio.  This is not to say that this is the best coffee you're ever going to have, but it's very good, and I'd dare say it's excellent for the price.<br /><br />With any coffee, but especially with cheaper coffee, I find it always pays to grind your own - it just has much better flavor than pre-ground. So I only buy whole bean with 8 O'Clock.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a good medium roast, not too bitter, with good flavor.  When I'm low on coffee and funds, 8 O'Clock is my go-to brand (either original or the equally-awesome Bokar Blend).  I've tried plenty of other brands but I'm always pleased with 8 O'Clock's consistency and quality and I keep coming back.

review/summary: Bad Quality
review/text: I bought the product and several flavor extracts from their actual website.  I don't want anyone else to have to go through the same frustrations for lack of information.  The extracts I received are so far off from the intended flavors that I doubt the solution's even edible.  The site claims natural flavors.  These were destroying all my senses.  Let's start with the vanilla, probably the most common extract people use.  Their excuse was every company has different flavors.  I've shopped for vanilla extracts from so many<br />different companies, natural, imitation, etc.  The faerie finest one I got was WORSE than the WORST POSSIBLE IMITATION vanilla.  I<br />called them to explain and ask for a refund.  I can understand where shipping cannot be reimbursed for those who mis-<br />ordered.  Unfortunately the INFLATED shipping costs cannot be reimbursed even if you're extremely unsatisfied with the<br />products, even though I was willing to ship it back to them out of my own pocket.  So the products I got will be going<br />into the garbage.  This has destroyed my confidence in shopping with them.  BE VERY WARY!! I don't want someone else to<br />have to go through the same frustrations I did.  I know it's cheap and very tempting, but for me, it was still a WASTE OF MONEY because the products I received are COMPLETELY UNUSABLE.

review/text: These baked beans are OK. The sauce they're in is NOT memorable. Normally at our house, baked beans are licked clean from the plate and the pan is scraped for remnants. But these are just so-so. We got them because they're organic and vegan. But Bush's non-organic vegetarian baked beans (which are vegan) are far superior. We're going to go back to them until we can find an organic, vegan baked bean that tastes at least as good.
