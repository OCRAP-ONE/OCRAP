review/summary: Yummy and creamy and HARD but not crunchy
review/text: This is my favorite candy. DON"T CHEW IT! It is hard, but not chewable or crunchy. It lasts a very long time and is so creamy, and you have to suck on them or lose your dental work, I guess that is why they call them Nips! They last a long time and, wow, are so satisfying.

review/text: I had these back in Sweden since i was a kid and they have always been in my candy bag as standard.<br /><br />It has that perfect gummy texture that no other candy have. I wish US could import more swedish/german candy, because the american taste of candy is kind of horrible.

review/summary: Tootsie Pops...yum, yum
review/text: This box weighs in at 60 oz & contains the normal size Tootsie Pop..not those small ones.<br />I decided to count the quantity of each flavor:<br /> 32 Grape<br /> 17 Raspberry<br /> 16 Chocolate<br /> 16 Cherry<br /> 14 Green Apple<br />  8 Orange<br /><br />103 Total Tootsie Pops<br /><br />I'm not a fan of apple flavored candy, but the Green Apple flavor isn't too bad.  These Tootsie Pops are for my hubby anyway; he takes them along for long car trips. I couldn't count them without having at least one.  yum...I love Tootsie Pops<br /><br />Tootsie Pops have a Tootsie Roll center (a chewy, chocolate candy that doesn't melt) surrounded by a hard candy sucker/lollipop.<br /><br />One Tootsie Pop has 60 calories, 10 grams of sugar, 15g total carbohydrate & 2% of the daily iron requirement; no fat, cholesterol, fiber or sodium.<br /><br />~~UPDATE: We just received our 2nd order of Tootsie Pops. For anyone who's interested, I did another count.<br /> 34 Cherry<br /> 19 Grape<br /> 18 Chocolate<br /> 16 Raspberry<br /> 10 Orange<br />  7 Green Apple<br /><br />104 Total Tootsie Pops<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I told myself I wasn't going to count these again.  Well, our third shipment arrived today & instead of rec'g the Variety Pack (which doesn't really mention 'variety pack' on the box, but instead says Assorted) we rec'd the Fun Flavor Assortment. So I did a count:<br /><br />52 Cherry; 13 Chocolate; 12 Strawberry; 10 Lemon Lime; 9 Blue Raspberry; 8 Watermelon =  104 Tootsie Pops<br /><br />These 3 shipments each came from different suppliers.  Two were fulfilled by Amazon.

review/summary: Not Enough Cherry Pops
review/text: Gotta love Tootsie Pops!!!! But the ones I love the most are the cherry pops and I can never get enough even in a 100 pop pack.<br /><br />What I would really like to see is a 100 pack of ONLY cherry Tootsie Pops, that I would give 5 stars, but they still wouldn't be quite as good as the Tootsie Pops of my childhood...that chocolate center seemed much bigger then, but that could just be old age skewing my memory.

review/summary: Misrepresentation
review/text: I ordered these tootsie roll pops thinking they were the original flavors (orange,cherry,chocolate,grape,&?). What I got was green apple (which is gross by the way!),strawberry (barely ok),cherry & chocolate (the only 2 good flavors in the bunch), blue raspberry, & watermelon (another gross flavor!). The advertisement blurb on the amazon site indicated that the flavors were the original flavors (orange etc.). I didn't want to ship the whole order back so I just used the ones in the order (from the "Toy Burg" supplier) and am ordering again from another supplier that I had previously used that represented the correct box (this one being "The Candy Co."). So be cautious who you order from because the amazon site does not indicate the exact flavors. I had to call to find out why I got the (wrong) misrepresented flavors & it wasn't easy even then to find out why I got the wrong type. The main lesson here is check your supplier and if all else fails you may have to use trial & error to get the correct item.

review/summary: Cost seems high
review/text: It does seem a high price for 100. You really cannot say anything bad about the product but the cost, the cost drops the rating.  $17.00+/- is excessive, you can go to the dollar store and get 10 bags for $10.70 + Gas cost. You end up with 110-120 pops. $13.00 maybe $14.00 seems right.  A month ago I paid $10.61 online at Amazon, What happened?

review/summary: Pops are Tops
review/text: Tootsie roll pops, the first lollipop with a chewy center, were born in 1931 at the Sweets Company of America. The company changed its name to Tootsie Roll Industries in 1966. Tootsie Roll Pops are the number one selling lollipop. Bought singly or by the bag, one might pay from 16 to 20 cents for a single pop. The cost conscious consumer buying them by the box of 100 will pay 8 cents or less per pop.<br /><br />A .6 ounce tootsie roll pop has 60 calories, no fat, no cholesterol, no protein,15g of carbs, 10g of sugar, and no vitamins. It's a low calorie way to get that sugar fix if the consumer limits himself/herself to one or two pops. Pops last much longer than a chocolate bar without the high fat and calorie count.<br /><br />Mrs. Spudman is almost addicted to these confections. I buy them by the box of 100 at BJ's. She takes out the flavors she likes and gives the rest to me to enjoy for myself or take to work for the students. (I just bit into the center. Just couldn't help myself.)<br /><br />They are a popular commodity and disappear quickly although I've noticed that the ones in the green wrappers are always the last to go.<br />I like that they last so long and satisfy my sugar cravings. Also I can pop one in my mouth and continue to type or do whatever with my hands free, only occasionally taking the pop out of my mouth to check on its progress or diminishing shell.<br /><br />The price for a box of pops here is a bit high, but consider that it is being delivered to your door.

review/text: I received my first box of these a year ago, and have ordered two since then. The first box was excellent and I'd give five stars for that experience. The second box seemed "stale," and I was a little surprised about that, because I didn't even know they could get stale... but the sucker bits get a bit more brittle, and the tootsie roll inside gets hard as rock. I received my third box a week ago, figuring that the second box was a fluke, and these seem even worse. They're still alright, but not great. I'm undecided on whether or not I'll get another box, as I seem to be detecting a downward trend in quality.

Isn't that enough chocolate? it's like having an eclair with cream flavored frosting. I save them and try to give them away to my kids friends. They don't want the chocolate either. Maybe they should consider retiring the chocolate pops.<br /><br />I like blow pops better except for the wrapper which is next to impossible to get off blow pops.

review/summary: Can't beat the Classics

I did count every pop and this is the distribution of flavors I received:<br /><br />Total-  106/  104/  104/  105/  104/ 523/<br />BOX-  1/  2/  3/  4/  5/ Total/ %<br />Cherry-  33/ 38/ 43/ 47/ 38/ 199/ 38.05%<br />Grape-  16/ 11/ 11/  9/ 10/ 57/ 10.90%<br />Orange-  10/ 17/ 12/ 15/ 11/ 65/ 12.43%<br />Raspberry- 15/ 16/  6/  8/ 13/ 58/ 11.09%<br />Chocolate- 16/  8/  9/  6/  9/ 48/ 9.18%<br />Pomegranate- 16/ 14/ 23/ 20/ 23/ 96/ 18.36%<br /><br />As you can see I received 523 out of an expected 500 pops.  Cherry was b far the most abundent flavor and chocolate the least abundent.  I did not receive any banana or Green Apple pops, (Fine with me). I was pleasently surprized witht he pomegranate flavor.  It was really good.  Would like to see more chocolate but I love all the flavors!  Afterall you can't beat the classics!

review/summary: The Official Lollipop ThrowBack !!!!
review/text: I received my product today along with other items all in great condition as usual. Thanks Amazon. These ole school favorites are advertised by this seller (DAB Unlimited) as described of which is very important to me as an online consumer. The picture displayed is what I exactly received. I took a count and the Flavor Breakdown is as follows:<br /><br />CHERRY - 32<br />POMEGRANATE - 19<br />CHOCOLATE - 17<br />ORANGE - 17<br />GRAPE 9<br />RASPBERRY - 9<br />Total - 103 Lollipops.<br /><br />I recommend these fresh and tasty Lollipop Throwbacks with the New Flavor Lottery. As you have probably read before purchasing, some customers received other flavors including Pomegranate, Green Apple, & Banana. This can't be controlled as these are new added sixth flavors but, you are highly likely to receive substantial amounts of at least 4 of the original 5 flavors out of 6 total flavors in your box. My box was sealed and unopened so I know that the vendor doesn't have any control over that and I'm sure that Hershey will have a nice song and dance for you too if you called. At least with calling Hershey you might get a coupon sent to your home. Enjoy.

review/summary: My grandsons love them... So does Grams!
review/text: Tootsie Pops are time-proven suckers that have been around through my generation on into my children's, my grand-children's and now my great-grands'... Just as with books, you can't beat a popular classic!<br /><br />Since each generation of my family loves them, I decided to get this big box for my great-grandsons Devon and Johnny. Their mother promised she would dole them out slowly. I wouldn't want to be responsible for them ingesting too much sugar on a daily basis, so I hope this box lasts a long time.<br /><br />One reviewer did a count of the flavors she got, so I'll just say I'm pleased that Michelle reported there were more of the chocolate and cherry in the box she received. I think most kids prefer chocolate, so that pleased me. I hinted for her to save a few of the cherry ones for me when I come visiting, so perhaps I should go soon. :-)<br /><br />FYI, Devon even liked the apple-flavored Tootsie Pops, but Johnny didn't care for those at all.<br /><br />I don't think anyone could go wrong purchasing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OYMGMC">Tootsie Pops-Variety Pack, 100 Pops</a>...whether for a gift, an office snack or for the home. And the price is right...<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Reviewed by Betty Dravis<br />Author of "1106 Grand Boulevard" and other books

In fact, it reinforces the fact that not all catnip is created the same......

I gave some to my roommates cats, everyone of them came out of hiding and wanted catnips, they had both hands over the plate claiming to them selves, they just didn't want to share it. Now I just shake the container that has the catnip in it, they all come running over.

review/text: This is a huge bag so I placed it in a freezer zip-lock bag and keep it in the refrigerator bin. It helps keep it fresh for months. This is by far the freshest nip I've ever purchased. My cats love catnip, I put some in old socks and tie the top, and fill their small toys. Both my cats are now laid-back and probably won't be moving much for hours! Great product and price. Highly recommended for cat lovers. You won't be disappointed...I don't like catnip tea so I can't comment on using this as tea but if your cat(s) like catnip they'll love this purchase.

review/text: My cats approval makes the review....however, it is so fresh and fragrant, I have no doubt it would be a super cup o' tea too. This is a huge amount...I have contained it in a very large tub and had a quart-size ziplock left to gift to my mother for her cat. Lots of fine leaves and nary a tiny stem.

review/text: I bought this mostly for my cat, though it has health benefits for humans too, and I will probably make some tea from it since it is just a variety of mint. However, the cat really loves it. I sprinkle it on her scratching pads and some of the areas she likes to hang out, and she just goes nuts for it.

review/summary: Hay
review/text: I grew up making catnip tea, but I always went out in the yard and picked it fresh. I was looking forward to enjoying it again. I was very disappointed. This tea has a strong smell, but it smells and tastes to me, like hay. In all fairness as I said, my expectations were based on fresh (not dried) catnip from our yard. I will not make another cup of tea from it, but my kitties are loving it. If your buying for cats or you have had dried catnip tea and liked it, this may be the tea for you, but if your used to fresh catnip this one will not make you purrrrr.

review/text: Great value compared to similar products sold in smaller quantities. Leaves smell very fresh/fragrant and only small amount of stems/coarse pieces mixed in. Arrived in a well sealed foil-type bag to protect from light - I would have preferred a bag with a zip closure to keep the product fresh. Did not have the strong effect on my cat that some reviewers have mentioned but he does enjoy it on his corrugated scratch pad. Also great for stuffing or infusing his catnip toys. Would buy this again.

review/summary: Find something better..
review/text: This stuff sucks.  It seemed to have an interesting, stinky smell when I opened the bag (which was some kind of mylar, sealed, so good packaging), and my two cats both got excited by it, but after a few days it seems to lose all aroma, and the cats are not interested.  They sense a hint of it, but they don't get excited.  I grew some catnip outside that worked much better than this.  I tried pinching and rolling this stuff around in my fingers to release some oils, but it's so dry that it seems that there really isn't anything to release.  Rubbing it does not make a difference to the cats, and it hurts my fingers anyway (too dry, no sticky icky to be found on this schwag).  There has to be good bulk catnip out there, but I may just start growing it myself again, as it is really easy.  Big disappointment, Frontier.. my guess is that this is either many years old or is just not grown well, or just isn't the right variant for good chemical output!

review/summary: OMG!  This is fantastic!
review/text: Based on some reviews on Amazon, I decided to try the Everyday Rub.  It is spectacular.  I've never used a rub with such an intense aroma and flavor.  I'm throwing out all my other pre-packaged rubs and sticking with the Fire and Flavor rubs.  I've occasionally done my own rub mixtures, and I still think this is better.  Paprika/chili flavors seem to dominate.<br /><br />This is a very finely ground rub (unlike the Asian rub), so it sticks well as a coating for grilled meat.  I tried it with grilled pork tenderloin - brush tenderloin with olive oil, then sprinkle and pat on this rub.  Let the meat sit for 10 minutes or so while the grill is heating.

review/summary: Much better than oatmeal
review/text: Oatmeal doesn't taste good to me without fruit and/or other sweetener, while this blend of oats and other grains tastes great as a savory porridge, to which grated cheese can be added. I've found that a single portion can be cooked in the microwave just so long as the container is big enough -- use twice as much water as dry cereal (for example, 1/2 cup cereal, 1 cup of water), and it cooks fine in the microwave in six minutes. I don't think it saves any time, but it avoids the need for stirring, and if the container is something one can eat out of, that's one less thing to wash (I use a Pyrex 4 cup measure, which seems like a nice big breakfast bowl with a handle). Sometimes I mix the Old Wessex Five Grain Cereal with Bob's Red Mill Seven Grain Cereal -- the Old Wessex is a flaked cereal, while Bob's Red Mill is steel cut, and usually takes a little longer to cook. When cooked up together (1/4 cup of each, combined with 1-1/4 cups of water -- and I add a pinch of salt), the texture seems more interesting than the result with either individually.

review/text: I've been eating this cereal almost every morning for years.  I have been buying it by the case from my local health-food store but I see Amazon sells it for less AND will deliver it for free.  I love the convenience of this cereal.  It cooks in 6 minutes and is highly portable for breakfast on the go.  I have been cooking it with a small handful of 'craisins' to add a little sweetness.  I like that it isn't mushy like oatmeal.  The nutty taste and texture appeal to me even if there's an occasional husk mixed in.  I wonder if more people, who are otherwise turned-off by oatmeal mush, would eat this if they knew about it.

review/summary: Without a doubt, this is the greatest thing ever.
review/text: This is for serious HP sauce addicts. I admit, I'm one of them, and this is overpowering for a bachelor. I can plow through half a bottle of the regular HP sauce with fish and chips or a burger or any meat/fish/potato product. However, this is a different animal altogether.<br /><br />When I fill up smaller HP sauce bottles to make it more manageable with this big boy, the big bottle haunts me and stalks me as if to say "Nick, you need to consume me." Have you ever had what you thought was the greatest thing ever and then get a ginormous amount of it? It's *that* intimdating. No single man should ever think about condiments in terms of pounds, let alone double digit pounds. But this is an amazing value, and you can never have too much of a good thing. HP Sauce is like dating a super model: no matter what size you get, it's still a super model.<br /><br />It'll take forever, but I'll consume all of this HP sauce. I will be the Morgan Spurlock of HP sauce.<br /><br />The only downside is that you really need to get one of those pumps for the HP sauce due to the viscosity of the sauce. Viscosity = good.

The only thing I hate about it, is getting the sauce out of it, it also looks pretty weird sitting on the table next to the poor ketchup bottle. The bottle REALLY needs a pump, but I haven't been able to find one that fits the it yet.<br /><br />FWIW: this HP sauce is now made by Heinz in the Netherlands, when Heinz purchased HP from Dannon, they shut down the UK factory and moved it abroad. Thankfully this hasn't impacted the flavor one bit.<br /><br />If you like HP sauce, you have absolutely no excuse for not buying this.

When I contacted the seller about this, he said that this was a price that he did not follow and that he had no control over the display of the list price, an issue that Amazon was "...working on" for him (i.e., seeking to conceal).

review/summary: Best mixer for water ever!
review/text: Snapples Raspberry ICe Tea mix for water in single packets is the best.  I found it in the stores last year and fell in love with it..... then it disappeared. Found it on Amazon... costs way more than I paid for it in the store but I had to have my fix that I take with me to the gym almost everyday.  Great stuff!

review/summary: Full Disclosure: I'm a Raspberry Tea Addict
review/text: I love these packets. They are delicious, economical, and perfect to store at my desk at work. I drink these starting in the morning all the way until I get home in the evening. They have helped me kick my soda habit and drink more non-carbonated beverages. It is surprising how quickly you can go through these packets, so don't be afraid of buying the four boxes worth. They were delivered very quickly and well-packaged so I could easily store them for future use. I was also thrilled to receive a product that will not expire for 2 years! These have a great shelf life and are a delicious way to drink more water.

review/summary: GOOD SPICE, HOWEVER NAME IS GARLIC & PEPPER BUT HAS MORE SPICE'S IN IT!
review/text: Hi, I love this spice, however it is called and sold as garlic pepper! The true mix of ingredients of this mix also includes 1)Sea Salt 2)red bell pepper 3)Green bell pepper 4) Garlic 5) Black pepper .... So it is not true to what they are selling it as!! However I love it!! I am very happy with it and will buy again! I just want you to know that there are some extra ingredients in it that some people would not want or would be happy with. My only negative is that the salt is pretty overpowering for the way I intended to use it! I like to put lots of garlic and pepper on my food but with the salt you can only put so much on before your dish is like swollowing mouthfuls of sea water!! (I am trying to post?) I have posted some pictures so you can see exactly what I am telling you. I think this was a very good deal for all that I got (12 pack ), but the mix is not just Garlic & Pepper and is cut with salt,green & red bell peppers!! I try and eat healthy and I love french fries!! I have come up with the next best thing... I microwave a potato then slice it like home fries then cover with very much katchup & my Garlic Pepper spice and I got A healthy snack without the deep fried fat and sat. fat!! See my pictures and I hope this helps somebody!!<br />  I forgot to add that the grinder on each bottle works very well and is awesome to have it ground as you need it! I think it helps save much of the flavor sealed inside the garlic and pepper. I find the garlic has a better taste than that powdered garlic they sell everywhere. Also I think I only paid the $12.50ish and the shipping was either lower or free?? I do remembe thinking it came out to a little over a buck each when I bought this 12-pack. My total order was close to $60.00 so I might have gotten free shipping with that?? Either way it still is a fair deal for a good product. One last thing is a 12-pack seems like alot, however it goes fairly quick... not like pepper corns that seem to last forever... This spice mix comes out in nice sized chunks. I am on my 5th bottle and I am one person, who loves Garlic & Pepper!!

review/summary: Failure for sprouts
review/text: I bought these seeds to use them to sprout, but the seeds are either old or not raw. I tried at least 5 batches and could honestly count the number of seeds that sprouted on one hand- out of thousands. I am worried this may not be as effective for health if they are not raw/new, but I am not sure about that. I contacted the company and they were not understanding or accommodating. They gave me the line of "well, we don't know how you are trying to grow them, and we don't guarantee that the seeds will grow."

review/summary: Decent Coconut Milk at a More-Than-Decent Price
review/text: Considering this is available at a subscription at a bit over $1 per can, it's a great bargain.  I've frequently used Thai Kitchen's Coconut Milk and this is comparable in quality, though this product requires a bit more shaking-of-the-can to mix the milk before use.  I don't mind that at all.<br /><br />Note that the picture displays "light" milk.  But the Product description simply says "Ty Ling Coconut Milk."  I received regular milk as opposed to light milk.

review/text: I buy a lot of coconut milk.  I use it like regular milk in coffee, baking, etc, so I am always looking for a good deal.  This is a very good price.  However, the coconut milk is a little grainy in texture and doesn't have the creamy mouth-feel that full fat coconut milk usually has.  It would be probably ok if used only in cooking.  It is very separated (part solid, part liquid) and it was difficult to blend it to a smooth consistency.  Overall - 3 stars - decent product for the price

review/summary: Not "Light" as pictured and very watery to be "milk"
review/text: I thought I found a deal here for about $1.25/can.  But turned out, not all coconut milk are created equal. I should have read the reviews because the pictured said "Light" and the product sent is regular.  Tried one can anyway and didn't like it at all.  Not much of coconut milk taste and it is so runny for regular.  I like my chicken curry sauce to be thick without adding any water to it.  This product probably got like 10% coconut milk and 90% water so it doesn't make good saucy curry.  I think that's why the cheap price.

review/summary: Good product, was on sale
review/text: I have tried several coconut milk/cream products from Amazon (I follow the sales) and am very satisfied with this product.  The label says "Light", the box says "Regular", the fat content is approximately half way between the Roland "regular" and the Roland "light" (FYI, 13g per half cup).  And yes, it separates, all canned coconut milk does, but homogenizes at around 70F.<br /><br />I'm using it to make lovely dairy-free ice cream (see recipe in my Donvier Ice Cream Maker review).  Next project is to perfect my "whipped cream" recipe.

review/summary: Triscuit's Are Dangerous
review/text: I approach Triscuits with great caution because I find them irresistible; I can't eat just one, they are absolutely the best cracker on the market; we have to ration ourselves because of my healthy appetite for them.<br /><br />At holiday times or when company is coming over they are always on the menu and are a great favorite with almost any dip. They are delicious by themselves right out of the box or with almost anything you can imagine to add to them.<br /><br />I get a little amused when I read the nutrition label, a serving is 28 grams, I would like to think that's at least a dozen crackers; well I have to admit I've never, ever weighed  any crackers before eating them and I have no idea how many crackers goes into 28 grams.<br /><br />Putting that aside for the moment if one consumes 28 grams one gets 120 calories, 4.5 grams of fat, 180 mg of sodium, 3g of dietary fiber, and 3g of protein and unlimited great taste.<br /><br />I'll further acknowledge that the nutritional value is pretty incidental to the wonderful taste of Triscuits; I eat Triscuits because they taste really, really good!

review/summary: One of my favorite treats
review/text: I love Triscuits!  One can eat them plain.  But, better, use them as the base of nice (and even fairly healthy) snacks.  One example: a little bit of sliced chicken on top of a Triscuit; then some Colby Jack cheese on top of the chicken.  Do 4-5 of these critters, stick them in the microwave on a microwaveable dish, and melt the cheese. Yummy.<br /><br />There are any number of variations on this.  Sometimes I'll add a little thinly sliced onion to the mix.<br /><br />Anyhow, Triscuits can be awfully versatile for snacking. And still reasonably healthy as these things go. . . .

I love chocolate so the milk chocolate flavor is my pick. It is a much smoother chocolate than the slim fast milk chocolate. I just wish it came in 6 or bonus 8 pack like the slim fast. So far I've only seen it in 4 pack. Because of this it is a bit more costly than slim fast. But again the taste is much better. I highly recommend it!!

review/summary: High in Sugar and Carbs / low in Protien
review/text: While this protien shake is one of the better tasting I've had, it's not a real protien shake. This only has 10grams of protien compared to most shakes that have about 30g and up.<br />The real "keep away" factor for me is that this shake has 29 g of carbs/ 18 g of this is SUGAR. If you're serious about weight loss, there are much better protien shakes on the market.<br /><br />Try EAS Whey Protien - It comes in a bag and each serving contains 170 calories/only 3 grams of carbs and 30g of protein. I haven't tried chocolate but vanilla is very tasty, especially with (skim)or almond milk.<br /><br />In response to a user comment, yes this product is marketed as an "appetite suppressor" rather than protein shake - however, if you're trying to lose weight - you will need to avoid sugary products, such as this. Spring for a protein shake with MORE protein and LESS sugar. The EAS Whey Protein will NOT taste as good - Special K drinks do taste much better - that is for sure (18 grams of sugar!). Sometimes as a 'treat' I will take 1 scoop EAS Whey Protein (chocolate) , 1 banana, 1 cup almond milk and 1 cup ice - blend well in a blender - and you have a DELICIOUS and HEALTHY protein shake.

review/text: I had tried drinking Slim Fast in the past as a replacement for breakfast, but the "tinny" taste made me gag. The Special K drinks taste just like having chocolate milk! As some of the other reviewers noted, they do taste much better ice cold than at room temp. I have also added some of the shake to my morning coffee as a replacement for creamer/sugar, and that was great too!<br /><br />My only complaint is that I don't feel very full after drinking them like I do with some of the other shakes I've tried. If I workout in the morning and then drink this for breakfast, I'm hungry again about an hour later. I think maybe they would be better as a mid-afternoon snack to fight off those 4:00 munchies instead of a meal replacement.

review/summary: It's working!
review/text: While other people have ponited out the heavy SUGAR content and average protein, i have been using the shakes for 2 weeks and lost 7 1/2 pounds. What i have done is had 3 shakes daily, 50 oz of water, 1 to 2 coffee's and dinner. Dinner is primarly a great protein (chicken, turkey, veal, sometimes steak or a burger while only having a small amount of carbs. i do not feel lacking (although the weekends are harder......)or hungry. All of this being said I have not made a true comparisant to other shakes. This one is working though. When i called the Special K hot line and asked them if they have a suggested diet to follow with the shakes they said no just to eat a sensable dinner. I figured that out myself and was hoping that there would be a better response.<br /><br />For someone that needs to loose 10 - 30 pounds this is a great option to get started.

review/summary: Better alternative to SlimFast
review/text: Since Slim-Fast went to plastic bottles and increased their price so much, I thought I would try Special K Protein Shakes.<br />They are much better tasting and you can recycle the bottles unlike Slim-Fast.<br />Unfortunatly the regular price for Special K is even a little more than SF. I look for deals and Amazon often has a case of six 4 packs under $30.

review/summary: Special K Chocolate Protein Shake
review/text: My boyfriend and I have tried countless protein shakes for after our workouts, and this is the only one we've stuck with. All of those whey protein ones seem to either smell terrible or chunk up in the water or just taste awful. The Special K shakes are amazing! The taste is just like chocolate milk, though a bit thicker in consistency.<br /><br />The sugar content is a bit high, but you can't beat the amount of protein and nutrients you get per bottle.

review/summary: Excellent taste, but not filling.
review/text: The taste of these shakes is awesome, especially compared to other brands.  They absolutely do not fill me up or keep me full for more than an hour, but as my 3:00 p.m. snack, they can't be beat.

review/summary: Satisfying
review/text: It's no chocolate milk, but for what it is, it has a decent taste & it's very satisfying. I have one of these whenever I'm hungry and want to eat something light and healthy or when I come in from running & need to refuel fast. Definitely gona order some more of these!

review/summary: Excellent Flavor!!
review/text: I love this drink, it has an excellent chocolate flavor.  My only complaint is that I have a hard time finding them, they are always sold out at the store.  I am so happy that Amazon has added them and I hope they add them to the subscribe and save so I do not have to hunt for them any more.

review/summary: Breakfast drinks good all day
review/text: When I am in a rush at lunch time, I drink one of these.  They are filling, fast and portable.  They also taste good.  When I buy the multiple pack, the cost is bearable.  And when Amazon offers free  shipping, it's even better.  Would def buy again.
