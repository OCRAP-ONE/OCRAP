review/summary: Great for Smoothies
review/text: I was looking for an alternative source of protein because I try to avoid soy as much as possible.  I read about hemp and wanted to give it a try.  I bought a couple different kinds but didn't like that some of them -- mostly the ones with flavor -- have a bunch of stuff added to them.  Plus they didn't taste good.  I started adding two scoops of Living Harvest Hemp Protein Powder to my smoothies, along with almond milk or kefir and berries.  The hemp powder made the smoothie an awful color but I thought the berries covered the "dirty" taste of the powder.  I can't imagine adding it to water or food -- I don't think I could get it down.  But if you're looking for something to add to smoothies, give this a try.

review/summary: Better than I thought it would be
review/text: I mixed the organic hemp protein, original flavor, with Odwalla juice, put it in a magic bullet, added some frozen blueberrys.  The texture is a little grainy but the flavor is great!  Much better than some of the other protein drink brands I've tried, Garden of Life protein drink included.

review/text: Strongly horrible tasting.  I've been enjoying smoothies that are more than half greens (kale, chard, etc.) with chia and ground flaxseed thrown in - so it's not as if I demand 100% sweet - but this stuff, even at a quarter of the recommended dosage, takes "must be good for you" to a new level.  Or should I say "to a new low."

review/text: I can see why people havent been able to tolerate this powder...they are trying to mix it with water or juice.  I've never known a protein powder that could be choked down that way!  I think the perfect complement is to mix it with Living Harvest's own Chocolate Hemp Milk!  Just turns it a darker brown, and tastes great as the Chocolate Hemp milk has sugar mixed in already.

review/summary: Great vegan protein
review/text: I really like this protein.  It's been my go-to smoothie protein for a few years.  The taste/texture might not be for everyone (it's grainy and has a decidedly "healthy" taste), but it's really great in the nutition department.  High in iron, which is good for vegans.  Hemp also has a very nice amino acid profile and has lots of fiber (not that vegans typically need help getting *more fiber*).

review/text: I just use 2 tablespoons a day (even though the product suggests 4 tablespoons), I'm not looking to bulk up, just to supplement my protein intake. I blend it into a fruit smoothie for breakfast every day and I can't taste the hemp powder at all. I noticed the first couple of days that it made the smoothie a little drier, but i love my smoothies and this doesn't overwhelm at all. Its a great vegan option for easily increasing protein intake.

review/text: This was a great product. I'm a Pescatarian, only meat i eat is fish, and no dairy. It was a great way to get some nutrients and protein before a workout. It does not taste great so i mixed it in chocolate almond milk. It must be mixed in some kind of flavored drink. Its a little chunky, but i don't mind it. Recommend this product, dont spend the extra money on the flavored kinds when you can just get flavored drinks to mix it with.

review/summary: It tastes pretty bad
review/text: If you're looking for a protein supplement thats easy to use, keep looking.  Hemp protein has a decent amount of protein in it and is very good for you, but its not something you want to just mix into a glass of water like you can with whey or soy protein.  This stuff tastes terrible and needs to be mixed into a smoothie where the flavor can be masked a little.  I usually mix it in a smoothie with soy milk, bananas, yogurt, and plenty of blueberries.

review/summary: Not the Best source for Protein
review/text: I was looking for a healthy alternative to those whey protein powders and recovery drinks after a workout.  I am currently doing the P90X program and they highly emphasize a high intake of protein and low intake of carbs during the beginning phase.  In addition, they also highly recommend using their recovery drink after a workout.  I wasn't  pleased when I read the ingredients in the P90x recovery drink which included artificial ingredients, and creatine (which has been shown to be detrimental to endurance athletes). For a recovery drink they suggest a 4:1 Carb to protein ratio within the first hour after an intense workout.  This protein powder mixed with some fresh squeezed juice seems to be the right combination.  However, this product suggest a huge heaping 4 Tbs per serving to get their meager 13g of Protein.  That is a whole lot of Hemp powder to add to my glass of juice.  I am pleased with this as an organic, natural foods alternative for the recovery drink because they recommend the high carb to protein ratio. But this absolutely wouldn't help for someone trying to increase their total protein intake due to that it takes 4 Tbs for 13g of protein, while those whey isolate powders only require 1Tbs for 25g of protein.  As far as taste is concern: if you already are into whole foods, then this won't phase you; and if you are new to whole foods, then be assured that the taste isn't very strong.  Price per protein is extremely expensive, but what do you expect from an organic natural food source versus a man made dairy by-product?

review/summary: Excellent source of Protein!
review/text: I started eating protein breakfasts and do not like soy so whey protein was out for me. Plus I'm not using it to bulk up and I didn't want a bunch of additives. I loved this protein powder for a morning smoothie. It is a little gritty and turns your smoothie an unattractive green color, but I liked how it was all natural and has a lot of good nutrients that I need. It does have a slightly nutty taste, so if you are particular, you might want to try a vanilla or chocolate hemp protein powder. I'll be trying those next!

review/summary: Nutritious and easy addition to smoothies
review/text: I've been trying to incorporate more omega 3's and 6's into my diet in good proportions, and for awhile I was adding ground flax seed to my smoothies (I've heard that you want to try to get more omega 3's than 6's because 3's can promote anti-inflammatory compounds, while too many 6's can promote inflammation and depression), but I had to stop because it was unbearably gritty. In want of a plant-based protein, I bought this product because if it's price and purity.<br /><br />To minimize any icky flavor, I used strongly flavored fruits like banana, blueberry, and strawberry with an orange juice base, added a tbs of flax seed oil, a tbs almond butter, and 4 tbs of this hemp seed powder. I can just barely taste it, the flavor comes through as nutty with the almond butter as other reviewers said, and it is slightly gritty, but it's tolerable. Nowhere close to milled flax seed. So far, this protein gets a 2 thumbs up!

review/summary: excellent protein, tops for omegas, gritty yes, but the best
review/text: For the Omegas, protein, and fiber this product is the best.  One thing I read ages ago was that omegas in the proper proportion helped ear wax to stay in balance.  What I mean is, when I miss this stuff, I get ear wax build up and have some trouble hearing because the omegas seem to really keep that part of the body in balance.  When I don't have my omegas such as this product, I have to start using earwax remover and warm water in my ears to keep my ears open.  As soon as I start using this, the problem goes away and I don't even have to think about such.  Cod liver oil does not help this earwax issue.  I read about this solution ages ago and thought at that time it was a crazy idea, but then I tried it an obviously converted myself to the blessings of the omegas.  I had read also that ground flaxseed was high in omegas and thought that would help, but no, this stuff is the product that really has the magic.<br /><br />So yes it is gritty by itself.  I add it to a whey protein drink that I use and I add a tablespoon of fermented soy protein powder that I also buy thru Amazon, so I am adding enough things into it for digestion.  My whey protein powder is Hydrobuilder which I get thru Amazon also.  So I never drink this hemp protein by itself, but I really love the benefits.  The fiber is great and that keeps the colon running smooth.<br /><br />It is also gluten free which is an issue for those of us concerned about wheat contamination issues which make it unfun.  Highly recommend this hemp protein to anyone, just combine it with something else when you drink it.

review/text: I was very disappointed after purchasing and using this product( it only lasted 3 1/2 weeks for me.) Also, there's no mention in the description that it takes 4 spoonfuls of of this powder to equal 1 serving. The texture tastes like sandy water and it doesn't mix very well. It mostly just floats to the bottom( like sand would) and i wont be purchasing this again. I suggest you don't either unless you love the taste of sand in your protein shake. I gave it 2 stars because it's hemp protein, and that's good. But try a different brand.

I was told to expect my order within 5-8 business days and it took 2 weeks to simply ship it, and another 2 or 3 weeks for the product to arrive.<br />When I finally relieved the package, I did not like the product whatsoever, the only reason I haven't shipped it back is because of the terrible experience I had receiving the powder.<br />I've mixed this product into various drinks, all of which are overpowered by the hemp seed powder.

review/summary: great protein source for smoothies!!
review/text: I really like this protein powder. As previous reviewers mentioned it doesn't leave you feeling bloated like whey protein. It does give a gritty texture to smoothies sometimes, but I notice that more when I make fruit smoothies, if you make a peanut butter/almond butter smoothie you don't really notice it. For the health benefits and low calories, I'm happy. I feel great after using it in my smoothie. My favorite recipe: 3/4 cup soymilk (chocolate or regular), 2-4 tablespoons of protein powder (your preference), 2 teaspoons raw cocoa powder, 2 tablespoons peanut butter, and 4 ice cubes. So good! Enjoy!

That's about 5 grams of protein for a tablespoon.  The recommended daily intake is 56 grams for most men and 46 for most women (more if you're active or body building).<br /><br />I find I can mix about 1 Tablespoon with a banana.

review/summary: Makes great bread!
review/text: We started making our own bread as the type of bread we like cost almost 5 dollars a loaf. These wheat berries make great bread and I can't imagine going back to store bought bread. We couldn't be happier with the purchase. I would suggest you get a bucket opener as it took me about 1/2 hour to open the bucket.

review/summary: Great For Preppers - Highly Recommended
review/text: This Hard White Wheat is a good choice for "preppers" since it comes conveniently packaged in a 5 gallon resealable bucket (however opening the bucket will significantly reduce shelf-life) and has a great many uses. We added this to our emergency food supply (also in 5 gallon buckets) we keep stored in our basement. It is possible to eat this directly, grind it for flour, or even plant it to grow our own.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: NIce!
review/text: Product came well packaged. The container is resealable, and has a gasket around the lid, so it makes a good seal.<br /><br />The wheat was very clean, without any trash or pebbles. I was able to put the wheat right in the grinder.<br /><br />If you are interested in grinding your own wheat, and making 100% whole wheat bread, this wheat is an excellent option. I was able to get big fluffy loafs without the need for added gluten. It is less bitter than hard red wheat.<br /><br />Overall, I could not be more pleased. Clean, makes great flour, and delicious bread.

review/summary: High-quality snacking
review/text: I enjoyed this Mareblu Naturals CranBlueberry trail mix. It has the higher quality ingredients. Expect to pay more per ounce than other brands. It was my first Mareblu product as I do not buy snack frequently. It was plenty big with a zip lock at the top of the bag so you can snack on it every other day. I find that there is always a balance between taste and healthfulness, and I have to admit that the sugar level for this snack is moderate to high, but if you can resist eating the whole bag then it's not unhealthy for you. I would buy this product again and recommend trying it.

One downside though, they've recently changed the recipe (but if you contact them they will insist that they didn't, but the ingredients are completely different), so if you look at the box and is says "made from real idaho potatoes"  It's great, but if it says "Made from real potatoes"  steer away from it.

review/text: Sometimes when cooking Moroccan style foods you need to use a tangy tasting ghee to mimic something closer to "smen" to saute your foods. Pure Organic and Swad brand ghee are more subtle and just like sweet cream butter in scent. Ziad brand is tangy as a stick of cultured butter that has had time to 'age' into a delicious mildly tangy scent and taste. Like comparing a mild cheddar to cream cheese.

review/text: Maggie loves this chicken and liver dinner. I do have to cut up the shreds a bit while it's in the can, using kitchen shears, otherwise she leaves the longest shreds, but that's no problem, just a minute of clipping insures that she eats the whole thing. In addition to the Weruva she gets a bit of a non-grain Fromm dry product in a cup, but there's always leftover in the cup in the morning, whereas if I clip the chicken into tiny pieces she eats it all.<br /><br />Since being on the Weruva she begs for her supper, and waits imperiously while I prepare it, then runs to her "table" to eat. When I open the can the food looks and smells good, which is because the chicken is human grade. I do add a bit of a special kitty nutrient to each portion, because Maggie isn't the kitten she used to be but is now a gorgeous, mature lady with a fabulous fur coat, for which I credit Weruva 'cause she wasn't eating anything so eagerly before.<br />She's now Marilyn, when before she was Twiggy.

I used half and half, but next time I'm going try a low fat milk. I would recommend adding the suggested potatoes for a heartier soup.

There is something in the mix that has the taste of dirt. It might be the too many dried green vegetables? and/or herbs? that bring this bad taste that also smothers the taste of the potato and leeks. This is too terrible to even give away so I will have to throw the other 3 packages away. I wish there was a way to order samples of food items here so I don't have to keep throwing money in the garbage!

A little bit of moisture would have gone a long way, and I'm experimenting with rehydrating them by putting a piece of lettuce in the bag overnight (in the fridge).  The results have been inconclusive as to whether this helps, with two of us having a split decision.  The teriyaki flavor is perfect...not too salty as I expected, and the taste, if rated separately gets 5 stars.

review/summary: Too Dry
review/text: I love SnackMasters' turkey jerky, so I naturally decided to try natural turkey jerky.  This turkey jerky is the same (or better) quality as the regular variety, but too dry.  I would recomend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EZMRRA">SnackMasters Turkey Jerky, Teriyaki</a>, instead

review/summary: My Lab Mix Loves These As Long As I Break Them In Half!
review/text: My lab mix has trouble eating large bones and/or treats. He was excited to get these, but I noticed that he left them on the floor and thought maybe he didn't like them. He has been having issues recently since he saw me WHACK! the coffee table with a fly swatter. He thought I was after him and has had emotional problems being in the living room ever since. That has been a couple of weeks now.<br /><br />So when I found the Meaty Bone Dog Treats in the floor, I wasn't sure what to think. He didn't like them? He was still having emotional trouble? or what?<br /><br />I broke one in half and he scarfed it down as if he had been starving. Then he came back for the other half.<br /><br />Apparently the Meaty Bone Dog Treats were just what he wanted. They were just too big for his mouth! They are SCORED so they are easy to break in half for smaller dog mouths. Great idea!<br /><br />I plan to buy these again in the future.

review/summary: Top Cereal
review/text: I have been eating Wheatena for over 60 years.  It's the most hearty, tasty,  filling, cereal I have ever found.  Now, because of cholesterol concerns, I mix the dry cereal with oat bran for its soluble fiber, and quinoa for its complete protein (helps cut down on animal protein).  I eat the cooked combination with soy milk.  I can't find Wheatena in stores all the time so I'm thankful that I can get it via Amazon.com.

review/summary: Wheatena - Comfort food is back
review/text: Its impossible to find Wheatena on store shelves on the west coast. So its wonderful to have a place to purchase it. Growing up, this is one of the hot cereals mom served and I sure missed it. Tastes great, good for you, and warms the body and soul on the cold, wet northwestern mornings.<br />Tastes just like I remember it and the fun thing is that by adding all sorts of different fruits the taste changes and never gets old.<br />YUM.

review/text: Wheatena Cereal is hard to find in the Maryland - Virginia area. It has been one of my personal favorites for a long time, and I am glad that Amazon handles it.  The Wheatena arrived in about 4 days and Super Saver Shipping was really fast on it.  If you like Wheatena I would recommend you buy it from Amazon.

review/summary: A breakfast for the past
review/text: My wife had mentioned that with winter coming on she wishes she had some Wheatena . Every time I was in a grocery store I went to the cereal isle looking for her Wheatena ,,,but no luck. On a hunch one day I searched Wheatena on Amazon. I was so happy to get it for her...She was so happy the day it was delivered and has already enjoyed a few bowls full. She says it tastes better if you make it with milk...My one complaint is that it was VERY expensive breakfast cereal when you purchase it  with the shipping costs  plus the cereal . It might be cheaper for us to fly back East where it came from and pick some up in person.

review/summary: Wheatena hot cereal
review/text: I used to eat Wheatena growing up, and now after a lapse of many decades I've found it again to my great satisfaction. It has a consistency and a flavor which is uniquely pleasant for a cooked cereal,and it is easy to prepare. Nutritionally, one finds greater claims for oatmeal, but I believe these are marginal. Buying a a four-pack seems overkill, but nonetheless I was happy to buy it on Amazon.

review/summary: Bought a box on speculation....
review/text: I ordered a box of Wheatena along with a couple of other hot cereals that one just does not find in the major (or minor) supermarkets here in San Antonio.<br /><br />Wheatena was the first of the few that my girlfriend and I tried this morning.  We were both hoping that it would be along the lines of "Ralston", another wheat based hot cereal that I ordered, and my prime focus for making my first on-line food order...but, Wheatena has got to be an acquired taste because neither of us could finish our first bowl.<br /><br />I like the texture but do not like the taste.<br /><br />Imagine a very, very darkly toasted piece of plain wheat bread and you have an idea of how this cereal tasted to us...now, if you like your wheat bread toasted to almost blackness, then this may be the cereal for you...<br /><br />But for us, it was a no go.<br /><br />Sorry, but this is one hot cereal we will never buy again.  Good thing I was able to find an online retailer out of Houston that allowed single box purchases so I didn't have to waste more money than necessary by buying more than one box...in fact, I entered my online order on Tuesday evening and had it at my house on Thursday afternoon...

review/summary: Wheatina - Found at last !
review/text: I have liked Wheatina cereal ever since I was a small child. It was, I guess, one of the original "comfort foods." Over the years, the packaging has changed, (still bright orange though!) but the great flavor remained the same - except that it was now available at fewer store every year.<br /><br />And now, in a city the size of Chicago, it appears to be unavailable at any major food store.<br /><br />Except Amazon! I was please to find it here, and at a favorable price as well.<br /><br />A great product. Welcome back.

review/text: My husband asked for Wheatana cereal, which had been enjoyed by both of us in earlier days.  I confidently went to the grocery store to buy some and was unsucessful in all stores so went to the internet.  I found it was no longer available in the US, as the company had been sold to one in the UK, but through Amazon was able to find this product, order it and now it once again is cooked and eaten in our home.  Delivery was timely and packing of the boxes was excellent. Now we have an international breakfast!!

review/summary: Old fashion breakfast
review/text: Growing up on a ranch in Oregon I enjoyed<br />wheatena for breakfast on cold winter mournings. A few months back I started looking for it in local stores in So. Cal, but could not find it so I started searching on line. The closest place I could find it in a store was in Utah but I did find I could get it through AMAZON.COM. I enjoy Wheatena mixed 50-50 with other whole grain hot cereals (that makes a box last longer). Wheatena has a great nutty taste and texture with nothing added just whole grain crushed wheat.

review/text: Wheatena is a comfort food for me.  My father used to make it for us kids when I was little on cold wintry mornings before school.  He did the same for my children when he became a granddad.  Now that he is deceased, a warm bowl of Wheatena takes us all back to those happy mornings.  My local store carried it for a long time.  But suddenly it was discontinued.  Life was a little sadder.  Thank goodness for Amazon!  I went online, ordered a four pack and we went through two boxes almost immediately eating a warm filling bowl every morning.  Now that we are satiated, we will do through the last two boxes at a more reasonable pace.  Thank you Amazon and the makers of Wheatena for being around for me and my family for over 50 years.
