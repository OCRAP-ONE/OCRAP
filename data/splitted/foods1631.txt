review/summary: Love the Tea
review/text: A friend suggested this tea and I tasted some she had made into iced tea. It was fantastic and I loved it. I like it unsweetened but my husband is drinking it as well...with sugar and he is enjoying it. Service was quick and we are enjoying our new summer tea.

review/summary: Good quality, decent price
review/text: Normally, I buy loose leaf tea and use an infuser because tea bag tea just doesn't cut it after you've had the real thing.  This tea, however, is a very decent quality with a good flavor and a nice body without being harsh.  I compared this Stash tea with a store brand that was marginally cheaper for the same type of tea, but this is much better.  If you don't want to mess with brewing your own tea this is an acceptable substitute.  Makes a very good ice tea as well.

I had received a sample of another brand that was delicious but expensive, and I bought this hoping for a cheaper alternative but I guess it's true.  You get what you pay for.

review/summary: Great for Earl Grey lovers!
review/text: I first ran across the Double Bergamot by accident.  I love Earl Grey, and I have enjoyed many other Stash teas in the past (if you haven't tried the Chocolate Hazelnut yet, go order some now.  I'll wait...).  I tried this one, and it was like a ramped-up version of Earl Grey.  The bergamot oil is what makes Earl Grey, well, Earl Grey.  Doubling that oil just intensifies the flavor.  Great for a late weekend afternoon reading my Kindle.  I even keep a bunch in my office to get me through the last couple of hours!

review/text: Stash Premium Mellow Moments Herbal Tea, Tea Bags, 100-Count Box is my new favorite relaxing tea find.  The ingredients have been listed in another review and at first glance, I was leery but Stash has created the perfect balance of flavors to create an exceptionally tasty tea; no enhancements - sweeteners, etc. are needed or desired.<br />This is one of the best teas that I have ever tasted.<br /><br />I had been drinking Choice Organic Chamomile Spearmint Tea with Bergamot, 20-Count Box (Pack of 6) until it became ridiculously overpriced but I am now happy that I was forced to try another calming tea at a much more reasonable price with a superior flavor.

review/text: It's hard to find a decaf English breakfast that has decent flavor.  Some of the supposedly "naturally decaffeinated" ones I've bought have either no flavor or have an unwelcome aftertaste.  This one has been really good flavor that is as close as I've found to the fully caffeinated version.

review/summary: Yum-o! 5+ cups of this tea a day!
review/text: I first fell in love with Stash's Wild Raspberry Herbal Tea on a recent trip to San Francisco. The little, european style hotel I stayed in offered this yummy tea 24-7 and I found myself stopping to grab a cup at least 3x a day. The tea has a strong, raspberry fruit flavor that is crisp enough to please your tongue and keep you hydrated, but without the keep-you-up-all-night caffeine. I instantly began craving the flavor.<br /><br />When I flew back to the east coast I was sad to realize that I couldn't find it in my local grocery store. I quickly hopped on Amazon and was happy to find that I can have the tea shipped to me. (YEA! Amazon!). Buying in the 100-count boxes is the cheapest option I've found, however, be warned that the 100-count box delivers the tea bags loose (they're in their separate, pink tea pouches, but loose in the box), which can be a cabinet disaster if you do not have a tea box or other place to keep the 100 tea bags under rule.<br /><br />The tea is great hot or cold over ice... you absolutely can't go wrong with this fruity tea!

review/summary: Really great tea!
review/text: I recently quit caffiene, and for over a year have quit sugar and all grains from my diet. This tea is my go to tea when I want something dessertish. A hot cup of this tea at night while watching TV is all I need to make me feel like I am having something to soothe me. I would give it 5 stars if it were organic. I try not to eat things with pesticides and fake flavors, but this tea is truly the most comforting delicious tea. I guess we can't be perfect 100% of the time. The fact that its decaf is awesome. Quitting caffiene has really helped with my ovarian cysts. They are much milder now than they have been in years. I even send in a zip lock bag to one of my son's teachers when I get it on auto delivery. This tea really takes me to my happy place at a great price.

If you want the decaf version, get the other one, which also says it's the decaffeinated version.  If you look at the photo of the bags, you'll see the other version's photo shows the word "Decaf" or "Decaffeinated" ...

review/summary: What a Bargain
review/text: My local large chain grocery store wants $4.99 for a box of 20 of these great tasting Wild Raspberry, caffeine free, Herbal Tea Bags.  100 for $13.77 is a great bargain and with Amazon Prime shipping, what could be better?  Stash makes great products and I haven't found a one of their teas that I didn't like, but with this sort of savings, my local grocery store comes out the losers.  Getting the product delivered to my front door is yet another huge benefit, especially since I'm physically challenged.  Thank You Amazon and Stash!!<br /><br />I may be going out on a limb here, but Amazon Prime has two HUGE advantages for me.  Being physically challenged, I really do appreciate the reasonable 2nd Day Air shipping that you offer on many of the products purchased on this site...but the really BIG BONUS is that the $79 you charge for that 2nd Day Air shipping (delivered to my front door) also gives me unlimited streaming of thousands of movies that I can watch for NO ADDITIONAL COST.  Now in my book--that IS a BARGAIN!

review/text: I have always loved Stash brand teas, and this is no exception. I tried Panera Bread's new Acai Berry Tea and LOVED it, so I did some shopping of my own in the hopes that I could find something with a comparable flavor. Well, this is IT! It has just the right amount of berry flavor-- very clean and just a bit tart. It was exactly what I was looking for. You cannot beat this value either. I purchased 18 of these exact tea bags for about $3 at Target, and was more than happy with the value. So to get more than four times that amount for less than four times the cost is awesome! I also love that these teabags are made in the USA. You will love this product!

It is so flavorful and just plain good.  I had been drinking Celestial raspberry tea, not thrilled with it, but this Stash raspberry knocks the other stuff out.<br /><br />I drink it iced.  The instructions seem to indicate that I should double the teabags, but I only use 2 herb tea bags and one green tea bag for 16 oz of tea and it is very flavorful.  Very flavorful.<br /><br />Good stuff.  I just received my first order today and it is so good that I had to reorder another box.

review/text: This is the BEST peppermint tea I have had;  it's even better than the natural dried herbs you can get at health food store when making your own peppermint tea.  Since I cannot locate Stash brand in the 100 count at my local grocer I have bought it here at least 3 times recently.  Everyone in the family loves this flavor/brand.  I highly recommend this and it makes excellent peppermint iced tea as well.

review/summary: One of my favorites
review/text: I was first introduced to this delicious tea in Stash's Green Tea Sampler (also highly recommended). I was immediately addicted. I really wasn't expecting to be impressed, because I usually HATE fruity teas (they always taste medicinal to me), but this is nothing like I've tasted before.<br /><br />It has an incredibly strong peach flavor and aroma, and a spicy ginger aftertaste. I can't really taste the green tea, but that's not a bad thing.<br /><br />This is one of the only teas that I put honey in, and I find that copious amounts of it make this tea the best.

review/summary: Hands down the BEST tea I've ever had!
review/text: Pros:<br />1- Tastes great hot or cold<br />2- Universally enjoyed (kids, adults, non-green tea drinkers)<br />3- Mild and smooth<br />4- Good sweet with cream (like Chai)or plain<br /><br />Cons:<br />1- can get bitter if you leave the teabag in too long<br />2- It didn't magically melt 50 lbs of fat off my body<br /><br />We use this at home for "water" - we make batches using five tea bags in 2 quarts of water - in our microwave for 7 minutes and let it steep for another 15-20 minutes.  Then we pour it into a gallon jug, and add water to make one gallon of "iced" tea that we keep in the refrigerator.  On a weekend we can easily go through 3 or 4 gallons a day (we keep to jugs going.) I sweeten mine with what ever is handy, my husband drinks his straight.  We've used maple syrup and honey for sweeteners both are great!  I can also nuke a mug for hot tea.<br /><br />At work I keep this tea for my morning hot cup of tea.  I love that it if goes cold it's still delicious - no more wasted work coffee.  I've given tea bags to many at work, and converted most!<br /><br />We get this on auto refill and love love love it.  I've been drinking it for several years now.

It can be too strong if you let it go too long.  The peach flavoring is just right - not too strong or too weak.  It also tastes natural.

review/text: Each tea bag is wrapped in packaging. The bottom of each says "Best by 20102014". Huh? I think this tea is stale. The expiration date is confusing or just meaningless.<br />The tea bags are sent in a shipping box. So, you get 100 tea bags all wadded into a cardboard box with a shipping label stuck on the outside. You will need to put the bags into something else when you receive them. A ziplock bag should be fine.

review/summary: Delicious, and the packaging is fine.
review/text: The tea is delicious, and is truly double-spice. I usually steep my teas for an unreasonably long time to get a strong flavor, and with this one I don't have to. It's not quite as amazing as a fresh home-made chai, but it's the best I've had from a bag.<br /><br />A note on the packaging - as the Amazon picture would indicate, the tea is shipped in the Stash cardboard box, and the individual packets are packed within that box. They're not "crammed", they're packed tightly and don't suffer any damage that I've seen. Personally, I prefer this shipping method, as it cuts down on waste. I'll add an image to the product page to show how mine arrived.

review/summary: Coconut is more pronounced than mango.
review/text: One of the biggest challenge to mix more than one fruit flavor in tea is to be able to balance the taste and aroma of the two fruits, so the tea doesn't taste and smell like one or the other. I love real mango and coconut, so when I saw this tea displayed in the grocery store, I couldn't wait to try it. I must say I was a little disappointed because after brewing a cup, I immediately noticed only the aroma of the coconut, and the taste of the tea proved it that way as well. Though there are other brands that utilize Mango and do a better job in their flavored tea, I am still happy that I got to know this Stash tea as there aren't that many brands that use the coconut flavor in their tea.

review/summary: My second-favorite mint tea
review/text: I love most of stash's greens:  they tend to be green (think grassy-flavored, but in a good way), smooth, mild, flavorful, and so devoid of bitterness that they're almost sweet.  I haven't found a better go-to green than stash yet, though there are some other truly good ones out there.  Most of them steep very forgivingly if you steep your tea too short or too long, and this one is no exception.<br /><br />This was my favorite mint green in the world until I found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D4MV3E">Stash Premium Merrymint Organic Green Tea, Tea Bags, 100-Count Box</a>, an organic mint and green blend that's also by Stash.  I've introduced coworkers to both and they loved this tea initially, but turn their noses up now that they've tasted Merry Mint.  If Merry Mint didn't have lemongrass in it, I'd be drinking it still!  If you don't have a grass allergy, please do try the other tea.  If you DO have a grass allergy, consider this one.  It really truly will be the best you've tasted as long as you keep yourself away from the other one.<br /><br />I sometimes brew peppermint and green tea together, but only when I'm out of these.  I order them by the hundred and STILL run out--they're good!<br /><br />A word on the 100-count boxes:  I've purchased about five of these in different flavors, and they pack these TIGHTLY.  I appreciate the green use of minimal materials, and no bag has ever been torn open, but they're often too wrinkled to redistribute as gifts or for resale.  Not always, but often.<br /><br />Edit:I neglected to mention that this also ices well. Many stash teas don't: they develop a film of flavor oil on the top. This one doesn't suffer from that as badly, but you can minimize that effect by putting your tea bags into cold or room-temperature water and allowing for a longer steep and a milder flavor. It actually makes excellent flavored water if you want something even more refreshing than tea.<br /><br />An update:  this has lemongrass in it, too!  Drat!  Both of my favorite mints will have to be a sometimes-tea, probably in winter when I'm not feeling stuffy!  When my allergies are acting up I'll have to revert to finding a lovely herbal mint tea to brew side-by-side with my favorite <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D4F1QS">Stash Premium Decaf Premium Green Tea, Tea Bags, 100-Count Box</a>.

review/text: My boyfriend likes Earl Grey tea, and had mentioned that he loves the Bergamot smell. One day he commented that he could barely smell the bergamot in most teas. I purchased this 100-count box of Double Bergamot Earl Grey Tea as part of his birthday gift in October, 2011 after reading the reviews. At first, he thought the tea was the norm and that he would be drinking this tea for years. But, after that, he has commented repeatedly that "his tea" is better than any other because of the extra bergamot flavor/content. He is one happy boyfriend. Thanks.

review/summary: Nice Blend of Chocolate and Hazelnut
review/text: While a hundred bags of tea seemed overwhelming at first, given my two-cup-a-day consumption, it won't take me long to get through. I drink a cup after breakfast and another after dinner. It is a nice, rich blend of chocolate and hazelnut that is very satisfying. It certainly curbs my appetite. Without it I want to keep eating, with it I feel like my meal has been complete.

review/summary: The only 'herbal' tea I will drink
review/text: Most 'herbal' teas I've tried always taste like warm Koolaid to me but this one is just perfect.  Given the price, I've tried to find other, less expensive options but haven't come across anything that comes close.  Having it shipped this way through Amazon *is* less expensive than going through Stash even though the packaging itself is listed as Stash.<br /><br />At any rate, give this a try if you like lemon because it really hits the spot.

review/summary: Stash makes good tea
review/text: I really enjoy tea and drink two or three 16 ounce cups a day, especially when it's cold outside. I used to drink mostly Twinings and Bigelow because hey, that's what they had at the supermarket. But I tried Stash a few years ago and have slowly switched to drinking it almost exclusively. They make wonderful flavours and have very reasonable prices. I particularly appreciate being able to buy 100 sealed bags at a time from Amazon, because that really lowers the price. And as long as you can set aside the minimal storage space, it isn't as though sealed tea bags go bad!<br /><br />Chai Spice Black is my preferred morning tea blend. It has more caffeine and more flavour than the other teas I drink later in the day. It's tasty and smells good, and the tea is consistent from bag to bag (to bag to bag to bag! I've been drinking this stuff for a few years now. :)

review/text: I had a peach iced tea at a restaurant I frequent and have been looking for some to brew at our office.  But every one I had bought in the past also had cinnamon and other spices added, which is not what I wanted.  This is just a nice, smooth black tea with a hint of peach flavor and nothing else.  Just what I was looking for.  I make up a pitcher to keep on hand for iced tea and our guests really like it, as well.

review/summary: Not just for special occasions
review/text: I like mild tea.  Currently, I have a box of Good Earth White Tea and a box of Stash White Christmas Tea sitting next to each other on the shelf.  I thought I would drink the Good Earth Tea daily and the Christmas Tea as an occasional change of pace.  Instead I find myself reaching for the Christmas Tea every day.  It has now become my favorite tea (I just ordered a second box).<br /><br />With most teas you want to remove the teabag after several minutes of soaking or the tea will get bitter.  This tea is very mild.  By simply leaving the teabag in the pot I get two or three cups of tea from each bag, with no bitter taste.<br /><br />At a cost of only 14 cents per bag, every day can be Christmas!

review/text: I love Chai. But, I know that green tea is healthy, right? Well, green tea, let's face it, often tastes a lot like grass. Stash's Green Chai is green tea at its best. It's a nice blend of spices that really does taste very much like my favorite Chai. So, go ahead, enjoy Chai and feel good about drinking healthy green tea too. Just let it steep a bit longer than you normally would for black tea, add some honey and some milk (or creamer if you're lactose intolerant like I am). MMMM.

review/summary: Great Tea....
review/text: I drink lots of both hot and iced tea. I have been buying the unit of 6 small boxes of tea, which means I have a cardboard outer box and 6 smaller tea boxes for the recycle bin.  But when I ordered this large box of Stash tea, inside were the 100 individual tea bags, which means I have just one box to recycle.  This is a great way to purchase large quantities of tea bags, and from now on I'm going to purchase my tea in these large boxes as long as Amazon offers them. It's much easier than opening and recycling individual boxes. As to Stash teas, well, they're the best.  I love this white lemon, and have not been unhappy with any of their teas.

review/summary: Wonderful flavor!
review/text: This is my favorite flavor of tea.  I enjoy white tea more than the darker teas, and the mix of peppermint and ginger is perfect.  If you enjoy any kind of peppermint tea or coffee (such as those served around Christmas) you will enjoy this tea.<br /><br />The outer package is the pictured cardboard box, but the tea bags are individually wrapped in air tight packets (the little white packet shown in the picture) which are pretty enough for display or gift baskets.  If you aren't sure about buying 100 at a time, look for a sample package on Amazon or elsewhere (though the Amazon prices are impressive compared to other ones I've seen).<br /><br />The only negative I've seen is that a few of the tea bags have "failed."  By "failed," I mean that when I combine them with hot water they sometimes expand quickly and purge a small amount of tea leaves through the stapled end of the bag.  It's a minor distraction (only once or twice have I had to through it out), but it's probably a 4% failure rate based on my usage so far.  No doubt part of the problem stems from poor technique on my part, but I haven't had this problem with other teas.

review/text: I bought this for my mom as a gift because she LOVES this flavor and has trouble finding it except during the holidays.  It is packaged in just a plain, cardboard box but I guess that's because this quantity is usually bought by restaurants.  Still, it is the same Christmas Eve tea that you can purchase from the Stash website and I bought the 100-ct for only a couple of dollars more.
