review/summary: Awesome product but dented cans!
review/text: These beans are heavenly and we love them, so we thought we would start a subscription for them to be delivered to us.  Unfortunately, when I opened the box and the plastic packaging inside, there were three seriously dented cans in the middle of the set of cans.  I find it hard to believe that they have gotten that dented where they were placed in the center of the set of cans without messing up all the cans around them unless they were set in there that way, so we paid for 12 cans and end up with only 9 usable cans.  Unless I find a way to get the other three cans to replace these I will be canceling the subscription and not buying this brand any more.<br /><br />It is too expensive in our local health food store, and we thought this would be a great idea. Since we got three unusable cans it ends up being too expensive again.  Too bad since it's a wonderful product my whole family loves.

review/summary: Now I understand my sister!
review/text: When we were growing up, my sister used to eat refried beans.  Straight, from a CAN!  I always thought she was crazy.  That is, until I tried this product.  These beans are amazing!  Never before have I had canned beans that taste so good.  If you are worried about your sodium intake, opt for the reduced sodium version; they are just as terrific.  This is the first brand of canned refried beans that are worthy of eating straight from the can.

review/summary: Cool Beans!
review/text: Wonderful refried pinto beans. The refried black beans are also wonderful. These are delicious right out of the can. There is no need to add seasonings or do any time consuming preparation. I add a little water and microwave/stir/microwave/stir and they are ready to eat in two minutes. They are great by themselves or as a side dish or dip. I like them with a good veggie burger and some steamed veggies. I consider them mildly spiced, as I prefer. Those with bolder tastes could add a little chili powder or some fresh peppers to spice things up. A spicy salsa would also go great with these beans.

review/summary: They're the BEST because they ARE seasoned!
review/text: These are absolutely the best refried beans I have ever tasted. I don't understand the reviews from the people on here who say they don't like the seasoning. These are seasoned the way TexMex food is SUPPOSED to be seasoned. If you don't like these seasoned beans, then you must not like TexMex food either, so then why on earth are you buying refried beans? With most refried beans, they have about as much flavor as flour and water paste. Also, I like the fact that these beans are not made with lard. In many parts of the country, it is hard to find refried beans that are not made with lard--unless you want completely no-fat beans, and I don't want that. I want the shortening; I just don't want the lard. This is also a good price for mailorder.

review/summary: Best out of the can refried beans I've ever had
review/text: These refried beans are delicious. They have a wonderful flavor that all other canned refried beans lack. Refried beans were a staple in the house when I was growing up, both fresh made then from the can. Of course I prefer fresh made but the whole two step process of making refried beans is a lot of work. I have tried all types of refried beans from the can and these are by far the best I have ever had the pleasure of eating.

review/text: I've used a lot of different brands over the years, some better than others...Amy's has raised the bar, and now I tolerate other brands only when I'm desperate. In addition to having superior flavor, they aren't disgustingly salty like the Taco Bell brand, for instance. Lest you get the wrong idea, they're plenty salty. The only drawback is, of course, they're pricier...I consider them worth it.

review/text: Buyers should be aware that these are not plain refried beans--they're already seasoned. Unfortunately, I don't care for the seasoning. It's not terrifically strong, but I don't like it and didn't expect it: I thought I was buying just refried beans. I'd much rather season the beans the way I like them. I generally like Amy's products, and I'm a big supporter of organic foods, but I won't be buying these again.

review/summary: A good buy for the money
review/text: If you want to use a lot of tumeric then this is the way to go. The list of health benefits associated with turmeric is very, very long, but at top of that list must be its cancer-fighting properties. Paired up with veggies like cauliflower, broccoli and cabbage, there is solid evidence to suggest it is very useful in preventing prostate cancer (there are approximately half a million new cases of this type of cancer each year in the U.S. alone). Most of us enjoy a drink (or several) and turmeric also strengthens the liver's potential to purify toxins in the body, along with carcinogens found in the diet (bring on the steak). Turmeric is also great at lowering cholesterol as it prevents the oxidization of cholesterol, which is what makes it harmful; this is all good for protecting your heart as it is the oxidized cholesterol that damages blood vessels. The yellow spice is also an anti-inflammatory.

That's right, I cannot get a refund even if I am not satisfied with the product or something wrong with it. I'll have to contact the customer service directly and test Amazon's service.<br /><br />Buyers must be careful about buying products from 3rd party merchants. They do not have the great return policy that amazon does. I think that this really degrades my experience with amazon. I will be much more weary of buy anything more from Amazon in the future, especially since it is difficult to distinguish those items sold by amazon and those sold by third party merchants. Even more important, it is difficult to know the return policy on an item until you try to return it!<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br />Update<br /><br />I emailed amazon and they notified me that this product is indeed sold by amazon and that groceries with expiration dates are not returnable. However, they refunded my money because the product did not meet my expectations and told me to disposed of it as I wished. Thanks for the free rice dream amazon! Hope you change the description on this item as you have done with the other listings of rice dream.

review/summary: Excellent gluten free pancake and bake mix!
review/text: I bought one box of this pancake and waffle mix and couldn't remember where I had gotten it!  I really liked it...better than some other GF mixes I'd tried.  I was pleased to find it available on Amazon!  I have just ordered a case (four boxes) and signed up for the subscribe and save program which makes the price of this item better than I've seen anywhere!  I usually bake from scratch, and, as you might see in other reviews I've written, I've been disappointed in gluten free mixes. However, this mix makes pancakes and waffles a snap...and it really tastes good!  I also made the pineapple cake recipe on the back of the box and got rave reviews!  It was really delicious and really easy.  I make a lot of pancakes because my hubby loves to take PBJ's in his lunch and I don't always have the time to bake bread for his sandwiches.  One time, when I had some pancakes left over from our breakfast, I made PBJ's using the pancakes instead of bread.  He dubbed them "panwiches" and loves them.  I cook up a bunch of pancakes, let them cool, make the sandwiches, and then freeze them in baggies for an easy grab and go lunch box item!  Unlike breads, cooking them up takes little time, so, whenever I run out I know I can fix up some "panwiches" quickly!  Oh, and I often put a glob of peanut butter in the batter (beat till smooth) to add even more to the flavor!  My only wish would be that the mix came in quantities larger than 16 ounces!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HXLSUU">Maple Grove Farms Gluten Free Pancake & Waffle Mix, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a>

review/summary: Best GF pancake mix Ive found, and Ive tried most
review/text: My son has celiac but loves pancakes. Ive tried every GF mix I could find in stores. Every pancake is flat, almost doughy in the middle, to the point it doesnt even look cooked. But my son always eat it and never complains. Just a week ago I found Maple Grove mix. When I first mixed it I noticed it smelled like cake batter. The first pancake I cooked I burnt it and set it aside on a plate to throw away. While I was making the 2nd my son walked over, tore a piece off and started to eat it. I said "dont eat that its no good, its burnt."  As kids are, he didnt listen and popped it into his mouth. To my surprise he said "its fine, it tastes good."<br /><br />I did notice while I was making him new pancakes they looked fluffy, like real pancakes, and they smelled sweet, like I was baking a cake. After I made him a few more pancakes I tore a piece off the burnt one, and with no syrup, tasted. I couldnt believe how good it was. It tasted like a cupcake almost. I drizzled a little syrup on it and ended up eating almost the whole pancake that I was going to toss.<br /><br />Hands down, this is the best GF mix Ive found. Im certainly open to trying something else in search of the perfect mix, but I cant see anything else much better than this. I dont have a waffle maker any more, had to throw that out after he was diagnosed with celiac, but I bet it makes great waffles too.<br /><br />I know we all have our tastes and preferences, but I cant understand the 1 star ratings on this, especially the ones that say this mix is grainy. Mixed properly this is the consistency of cake batter. And who doesnt like cake?

review/summary: Nice texture but too sweet
review/text: The good: If you want to make a gluten free cake, then this pancake mix would be a good base. Also, my gluten intollerant girlfriend said it has a nicer texture than other gluten free pancake mixes she has used.<br /><br />The bad: surpringly sweet, tastes very much like yellow cake from the dextrose used to sweeten it. Personally, I can handle gluten. But I have a problem with eating too much sugar. So we had it with just a little pumpkin butter and marjarine.<br /><br />She liked it enough to eat 3 small (4 inch) pancakes. I had 2, then had to stop eating it as I could tell I was getting way too much sweetener in my breakfast and my stomach would've been upset if I kept eating it. I'd say if you really like sweets, you'll like it. And if you really want cake for breakfast, this is the one for you. If like me, too much sugar hurts your stomach, maybe look at another product.

review/summary: Great fluffy pancakes
review/text: Our whole house is gluten free due to 3 kids with Celiac & gluten allergies.  This is a great pancake mix.  We took several boxes with us on vacation and the cooked pancakes held up well for on-the-go snacks.  I also hosted Christmas brunch for my husband's family and served these pancakes as part of the spread.  Everyone loved them and came back for seconds - they did not even mind that they were gluten free.  They kind of taste like Jiffy blueberry muffins without the blueberries.  I make the entire box at one time and save any leftovers in the fridge or freezer.  These pancakes are fluffy - Pamela's mix pancakes are very thin.  My kids like them both, but these have the consistancy and look of traditional gluten pancakes.  They also smell sweet - like vanilla when cooking.

review/summary: Totally Gross
review/text: I was recently diagnosed with Celiac disease, and have been wildly craving pancakes. Like some other reviewers, I had always used Maple Grove pancake mix prior to being diagnosed. I absolutely LOVED their product...in my opinion, the batter turned out flawless every time. When I saw this GF version at my grocery store, I was thrilled! Well I cooked up a batch this morning, and they were wretched. I have totally accepted the fact that GF foods are just going to taste/feel different than<br />'regular" foods, but these were just so terrible. Not only was the texture very grainy and un-fluffy there was a very strange under-flavor. I always add just a drop of vanilla to my pancake mixes, so naturally I did with this too. When I tasted them, I thought I must have accidentally put half the bottle of vanilla in, before I realized that it wasn't quite the vanilla that made them taste so bad. I smelled the pancake mix, and discovered that the mix itself has a very floral-y or perfume-y scent to it. I have never used a pancake mix where the mix itself was scented. This was very strange to me, and I was just disgusted by the outcome, so I will keep searching for the perfect mix.

review/text: Definitely the best box pancake mix I've ever had...and it's nice that it's GF, too.  I used to make pancakes/waffles by scratch, but this mix is great and saves me time when I just want to use a mix. We can eat gluten but feel better when we don't. Made from scratch GF pancakes aren't typically very good, and this even beats it's competition WITH gluten. I highly recommend trying this. Prices here are much better than stores.

review/text: I had already found a product that I really liked as far as gluten free pancakes go (Bob's Red Mill), but figured I would give Maple Grove Farms a try because they are fairly local to us.<br /><br />Unfortunately I was put off as soon as I poured the mix. The texture of the mixture was apparently different (very powdery) and smelled of cupcake mix! They cooked kind of strange, and my non-Gluten Free husband and I felt like we were eating them just because they were there. They needed to be covered with other flavors to make them 'good'. I really might try making these into cupcakes though, because the smell is dead on.

review/text: for gluten free pancakes and waffles, you can't beat this.  Fabulous in taste, texture, time and ease in making.  We use them on our waffle griddle a few times per week. Love that we add our own fresh egg(s) and milk (vs. plain water) to get nutrient rich breakfast for my kids.  Instead of syrup, we sprinkle powdered sugar and sliced strawberries. You can even make larger amounts and store in container for next morning.  Just add a little more milk to reduce its thickness the next day.  Perfect!

review/summary: Tastes wonderful
review/text: Here's a wheat free gluten free pancake mix that makes light, fluffy pancakes, even after you use the leftover batter from the fridge the next morning. (No flat, rubbery pancakes.)<br /><br />This has a sweet smell and taste, perhaps owing to the unnamed "natural flavoring" from the ingredients list. (To me it tastes like blueberries.) It's pleasing but I didn't find it overbearing, which increases the versatility of the mix. And by the way, I really enjoyed the flavor.<br /><br />I also experimented by putting in a small amount of unsweetened cocoa powder with positive results.<br /><br />I fed this to my family, and my choosy husband who will eat nothing but Jemima's really enjoyed these pancakes and even asked for more. Saves me from having to cook up separate batches for each of us, although this option is a bit pricier.<br /><br />It's nice to eat pancakes again.<br /><br />If you're allergic to rice, this will not work for you. It contains rice flour.

review/summary: The BEST gluten free pancake mix!
review/text: I love this pancake mix.  It makes pancakes that don't taste or feel gluten free!  So many mixes have a grainy texture or get rubbery when cooked, but not this one.  Maple Grove Farms has made a gluten free pancake mix that can't be distinguished from the "regular" kind.  I've done a pancake breakfast for 50 people using this mix without telling them the pancakes were gluten free, and they gobbled them up!

review/summary: AWESOME!
review/text: This is my FAVORITE pancake mix.  I have tried several and none of them tasted "right".  I even tried making some from scratch, and they came out way too thin and runny, even following the recipe exactly.  Some gluten free things have a funny taste, but NOT these.  My entire family of 5 LOVES these and thinks they taste just like regular pancakes.  I make the recipe using WATER, which is the recipe for waffles, not pancakes, but I make pancakes and they turn out perfect.  The pancake recipe calls for MILK.  I'm sure they would be good that way too but I haven't tried it.  The box is not very large and I usually use at least 1/2 the box for a batch to feed my family.  But I think the price is okay since they are really yummy.  They puff up just like a regular pancake, they brown just like a regular pancake, and there is NO odd taste.  I am already on my 3rd order of these from Amazon!  Thank you Amazon!!!

review/text: We haven't used this mix for making pancakes (Bob's Red Mill is a favorite there), but it is definitely the best option we've found so far for making gluten- and casein-free waffles. Even if it's non-stick, you may need to grease your waffle iron; however, the waffles come out light & fluffy with a pleasantly crispy outside. Even our family members who aren't on a GFCF diet enjoy eating them!

Try slicing bananas into the batter or adding a little cinnamon or nutmeg to give it a twist! Yummy!!!

review/summary: Have a cup of South Louisiana!
review/text: What could be more reflective of South Louisiana than a cup of Community Coffee? No smooth, suave Starbucks. No flavored creams. Just the pure, bold taste of Community Coffee.<br /><br />You know how the reptilian brain "remembers" aromas you "forgot"? Bring on a taste or odor from years ago and the reptilian brain will recognize it. That's what happened yesterday when I had coffee at my mother and brother's house. My brother had switched coffee brands and made a pot of Community. At first whiff, my brain raced back to my grandmother's house and the Community in her drip pot. Pure bliss!<br /><br />And, yes, my brain flashed back to Lake Charles, where I taught for the first five years of my teaching career. The -ex's grandparents and aunt lived in Lake Charles. They, too, drank Community Coffee. There really is no accurate way to describe the taste and aroma of Community, other than: It tastes and smells like South Louisiana!<br /><br />The package itself says Community is made from 100% imported Arabica beans, roasted, packed, and distributed out of Baton Rouge. "Then through generations of roasting experience, we achieve a full-bodied, yet smooth flavor that reflects the extraordinary culinary traditions of Louisiana" (taken from the back of the package). I chose Medium Roast (rich and smooth) from selections of Dark, Between, and Medium.<br /><br />Just brew, pour, and enjoy! You have a cup of South Louisiana to savor.

review/text: I bought both this version and the breakfast blend because it has great reviews for taste.  The coffee isn't bad but it defiantly is not anything special. For the price it could be more ethical (fair trade, organic, shade grown etc.). The taste was OK but I'll stick with Dean's Beans.

review/summary: ABSOLUTELY NOT WHAT IT SEEMS TO BE, VERY DISAPPOINTING :-(
review/text: I love this time of the year (Autumn/Fall) and love the immense variety of pumpkin food products that are available.  To name a few: Pumpkin Ice Cream, Pumpkin Bread and Muffins, Pumpkin Pie, Pumpkin Spice Latte (coffee), Pumpkin Cheesecake, etc. etc.  I recently started adding canned pumpkin to our Sunday morning pancakes, and was delighted with the results; however, I wanted a stronger pumpkin taste/flavor.  I found this product and excitedly ordered two bottles.  It arrived very quickly (within 3 days), and I just tried it this morning in our pancakes.  The flavor DOES NOT taste like pumpkin whatsoever.  It tastes like a chemical and leaves a bad taste in my mouth, literally.  I dumped both bottles down the sink and had to throw away the pancakes.  I was not able to eat them, they were terrible.  I was actually nauseated after trying to eat them.  I'm not a picky eater and have no allergies whatsoever.  I'm the type of person that will eat nearly everything, and cannot think of any food that I don't like.  I'm going to continue my search for a "NATURAL" TRUE pumpkin extract; however, this is definitely not it.  I hope this helps you, especially if you're as passionate about pumpkin flavor as I am. Happy Holidays to You and Yours.  Sincerely, Tim

review/text: This tea is great! The vanilla undertones are subtle but definitely adds to the richness of the flavor. The (natural) sweetness of this tea is also perfect, no additional sweeteners necessary.  I normally stay away from white teas but this is an extremely well-balanced (not too light) variety. As if that wasn't enough, white tea contains more antioxidants than black or green teas and has numerous health benefits!<br /><br />FYI: This tea is also gluten free and comes in unbleached tea bags.

I can't find it at any of my major grocery chains which is unfortunate.

It sort of makes me shudder as I swallow it.  I have tried brewing it for shorter times and I still don't like it.  I have also tried the Decaf White Tea, with the same opinion.<br /><br />It was surprising to me that I dislike this white tea.  I love other Good Earth tea products, with the decaf green tea and organic decaf green tea with mango being my favorites that I drink daily.<br /><br />I know the other reviewers have rated this white tea highly, but I would suggest trying a box from your local grocery before ordering in bulk.

Doesn't have the strong taste like honey, so the java flavor is not influenced! Since it is a slightly thick liquid, it immediately blends w/ a quick stir. This company served me very well. The product arrived in zip-lock baggies, so if a seal had broken (which it didn't) it would have been contained. Thank you for a great product at a great price and great service.

review/text: Agave nectar was a weekly purchase for me ... but I saw this was about half<br />the price of my main grocery store so I gave it a shot. It was much more golden than the almost clear "light" syrup I had gotten accustom too. And along with that was a mild flavor variation ... but clear or gold are both delicious ... it's not enough of a difference to change any of my recipes or anything so I am a happy camper.

The price on the product has gone up since I ordered it on Jan. 7th 2011 -- so, I ordered the CS Indian Spice Chai tea bags instead. I put 2 teabags in MY K-Cup and it tastes exactly the same. You get 6 boxes of 20, so that is 60 servings for me (2 bags at a time) for the 13.95 (subscribe and save) these cups used to be. If I want the tea a bit stronger, I will remove the tea bags after brewing from the my k-cup and throw them in my mug. Let is steep a bit longer and it is wonderful!
