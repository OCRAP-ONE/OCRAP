review/summary: Good, Mild Flavor, High Caffeine Coffee
review/text: I consider myself a reasonable coffee enthusiast having done tours of places like Intelligentsia and know a decent bit about how to make the right brew.<br /><br />That said, Lavazza Crema e Gusto is an interesting 30% Arabica, 70% Robusto blend.  It's well known that Robusto beans have less flavor than Arabica and are cheaper, but tend to higher in caffeine content.  That said, that is pretty much what you get with this blend.  It's in all technical aspects a lower quality product, Robusto is considered a low end bean that you will almost never find it in American consumer coffee.  Even instant coffee tends to tout 100% Arabica as well-informed consumers prefer the full flavor.<br /><br />What's interesting is that Lavazza has decided to mix it, and so there's that coffee flavor coming from the Arabica, but it's mild due to how it's diluted.  The "creaminess" I would say comes in part from the very fine grind they use, hence it comes packaged in these vacuum-packed bricks that are more like a mold when you open the bag than the usual medium grind you'll see.  As a result, whether you drip or french press it, you get some of that bean filtrate coming through and it gives it a more creamy texture which is in all actuality the bean particulate coming through.<br /><br />Finally the caffeine kick is awesome, as it's probably 2x stronger than your average coffee thanks to the Robusto beans and the super fine grind, making it a solid wake up coffee.  I personally don't like the taste of it straight as compared to other 100% Arabica coffees like Sumatra or Columbian (which are my preferences) as it's just it's just too bland for my tastes but a touch of milk and sugar brings out more mellow flavors and again that subtle texture.  Good for mornings, but I wouldn't necessarily ever have it as my go to coffee my evening cup.

review/summary: Really, really low quality
review/text: I was misled by the high reviews of this coffe (somehow I forgot that we are in Folgers land here) so I bought a 4-pack. This coffee tastes awfully like robusta, and probably is made moustly out of robusta (interested parties can inquire about robusta vs arabica in the coffee blends, but let's just say that any decent coffee blend is made out of 100% arabica. Robusta is mixed in cheap blends because it is cheap. Tastes awful too... ). Also, the price of this coffe does not reflect the low quality - it should be way cheaper.<br />I normally buy Lavazza Oro, but somehow the quality of that coffee deteriorated in the last year or so).

review/summary: Best coffee EVER!
review/text: I've tried several brands and flavors of ground coffee from Amazon, and this is by far the.best.coffee.I've.had. I decided to write a review because last weekend my husband made me a latte, and it was yummy. I asked for a second one, and what he gave me was not what I had the first time. I asked him what was different, and he told me he used a different brand and flavor. He was really surprised that I could tell. The one that I LOVED was the Lavazza Crema e Gusto. Wow. What a difference. It's smooth and full bodied - okay, I'm full of crap. I have no idea what "full bodied" is other than a fat chick. But I can tell you this -- this coffee is tasty and you will not regret buying it.<br /><br />I bought it in January because there was a deal going on - $12 for 4 bricks. But here I am willing to pay $15 for 4 bricks (S&S price) less than 2 months later. I wish I had stocked up when it was cheaper, but who knew the coffee was going to be THAT GOOD! It's so worth even $18 for 4 bricks!

review/summary: The Best
review/text: I discovered this coffee while I was in Munich, Germany.  It is the smoothest, non-bitter coffee I had ever had.  I was able to get a few bricks back to the US but needed to find a way to get more.  Then I found it on Amazon.<br /><br />Most people on here use it for their espresso machines, but I just use my "Black-n-Decker" coffee maker.  My guests always ask where they can get their hands on it.  A few friends and family have transitioned from their Maxwell House to Lavazza!

I am dissatisfied with it and the item is not what I expected.<br />Since I was not able to return it, I opened one package.<br />Just for people to be aware.

review/text: as early as i can remember when going to italy, everyone i would visit would be cooking on the stove a pot of Lavazza Creme e Gusto.<br /><br />I was tickled to see that i could start getting this through amazon's subscribe & save.  Best deal on the internet!<br /><br />knock on wood, i've been doing this for over a year and not 1 shipment has ever been messed up.  The only way i would recommend something different is if you have a pressure brewer.  Lavazza has a brew just for that.<br /><br />I know that the Lavazza Qualita Rossa is their higher "quality" roast but i just can't taste it.  I dont think its bad but not better than Creme & Creme is cheaper.<br /><br />I keep the open pack in the fridge & the sealed packs in the freezer.  No arguments from my local spanish family or friends who makes a mean cup of espresso.  using ice cold spring water helps too ;)<br /><br />i use Bialetti Moka Express stove top & electric pots to brew my espresso

review/summary: Strong cup of coffee. I deal for making iced coffee.
review/text: What type of coffee drinker am I?<br />In our Cuisinart coffee maker my wife and I use 1.5 tablespoons of Dunkin Donuts coffee per 6 oz of water so we like our coffee pretty strong. However, neither one of us goes out of our way to get Starbucks because we don't like the taste for some reason. If Starbucks is considered bitter, that is probably why.<br /><br />Review.<br />I would consider this coffee bold yet not bitter. It's definitely full flavored yet not over powering. Maybe that is what "Crema e Gusto" is specifying. The ratio of coffee to water for a Dunkin Donuts drinker is about 3/4 of a table spoon to 6oz of water. I accredit the smaller ratio to how finely ground the coffee is rather than overall strength.<br /><br />I drink iced coffee in the summer so even though it is January I had to try it. This coffee is IDEAL for making iced coffee because you can make it at 1.5 table spoons to 6oz of water and the taste is not effected by a little bit of ice melting. I can not stress enough how good this coffee is iced!<br /><br />I am defiantly enjoying the LavAzza and may try other varieties to make hot coffee but this is my go to for iced coffee from now on!

THIS IS IT!!! i fill my cup halfway and brew it on the 8oz setting. not only is it a perfect cup of rich flavorful coffee, the bag has lasted soooo long! i bought when it was 12 bucks for 4 bags (subscribe and save) and i think this will last at least 2 months drinking 2-3 cups a day. absolutely no waste! i love my keurig and lavazza!!!<br /><br />i also have a wonderful espresso machine that i use this in, however the keurig is my new coffee toy to play with. either way the lavazza tastes great.<br /><br />note: it brews a lot slower due to the fine ground BUT this is the way to extract all the flavor. it is brews way too slow use less in the k-cup filter.

review/summary: illy fan is loving this blend in our home machine
review/text: As my wife and I found we had become "those people" who stop at the local coffee shop many times a week, we needed to hit the lotto, quit or buy a machine and learn to make our own go-juice.<br /><br />This coffee brews wonderfully in our new DeLonghi Bar32 (EC155 clone) - the fine grind makes the cheezy built-in tamper more than good enough, reducing counter-clutter. And the crema produced is a dream - though the fancy, much older, espresso machine at work can't hope to achieve this with me driving it --- the DeLonghi is just newbie-proof and brews this blend really really nicely.<br /><br />Though she was initially disappointed I didn't splurge on the illy to christen the new machine, she likes the lattes we're making at home more than her $3 coffee shop favorite. This blend is fine for my mocha, too, though if she didn't LOVE this coffee I'd give the Rossa a whirl looking for just a little stronger flavor to stand up with the cocca powder. Frankly - this is making as good a mocha as what I buy at any of my 3 shops, so I'm happy too!<br /><br />Glad I trusted the reviews. I just signed up for a "subscription" - can't beat the price!

review/text: I decided to try the Lavazza blue pack (Crema e Gusto) instead of the one that I had found to be perfect in Europe, the Red pack or Lavazza Rossa. I like it but not as much as the Rossa. For my taste it is a little too mocha flavored and I prefer the more robust cafe espresso flavor of the red pack. The price for either coffee is very competetive, particularly if you take advantage of the subscription ordering option. I will be switching back to the Lavazza Rossa.

I have tried other brands, Illy, Fresh and Easy, but this is my favorite and the price is right.

review/summary: This is the coffee I have been looking for
review/text: First had Lavazza at a local coffee shop and was floored. To me, this is what coffee should taste like. It is bold and strong, but no bitterness whatsoever. I recently bought a Curtis commercial coffee maker and was hoping for the same experience from my office and home. After a few different coffees (mostly local whole bean), I was disappointed that my coffee wasn't turning out as good as the cafe I went to. To my surprise, the next time I visited the local grocery store, I saw this Lavazza brand in the Italian isle. I immediately bought it and brewed it that night. After the first sip, I knew I had hit the jackpot. This is what I have been waiting for. All along it had been the coffee making the difference. The Curtis helps significantly with ensuring the proper temperature of the brew, but it is really the coffee that makes all the difference. I am impressed in the packaging and was surprised how packed they are able to get the ground coffee.<br /><br />BTW - I have only used this for my drip coffee maker - have not used it for espresso yet. For my taste, one coffee scoop (1/8 cup / or 2 tablespoons) for every 16 oz of water.<br /><br />As long as Amazon or my local grocer carries this coffee, I will be buying it. Wish I could give it more than 5 stars. .

review/text: First of, there is nothing better than a cup of coffee made with fresh beans, being ground right before making the cup of coffee.  That being said, the Lavazza Crema e Gusto coffee is actually kind of great.  I bought it based on the number of great reviews on Amazon.  Opening the package I immediately noticed the back of the bag of coffee - it says 70% robusta beans and 30% arabica beans.  I was immediately nervous that this coffee would be horribly bitter, but after making a double "shot" Americano from my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047BIWSK">Aerobie AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker</a> my fears disappeared. It is a very smooth, almost chocolatey coffee.  This coffee will be perfect to keep at my office where it's near impossible to get a good cup of coffee.

review/summary: Great in the Bialetti Moka Pot
review/text: This is nice, full-bodied espresso, which I brew in my moka pot.  It doesn't do much to get crema in a moka pot, but then not much will with this method... but with the Robusta in this blend, you should experience crema a bit more easily in a machine. With my stove-top milk frother, a little steamed milk brings out the chocolaty notes described by Lavazza, and it's a nice morning treat.<br /><br />This amount (4 bricks, 8.8oz each) has lasted me a good 3 months of summertime use in a 6c moka pot.  I'll probably go to every 2 months on my subscription for autumn through spring.

review/summary: New Espresso Drinker
review/text: I purchased this brand of coffee when I purchased Bialetti Moka Express L'Original 12 Cup Espresso Maker. Up until now, I've had no experience with either. Normally, I'm the type of person to find one brand of coffee and stick with it. When the price of my current brand of coffee shot up, I started looking around for something else.<br /><br />What caught my eye was the Arabica/Indian/Robusta blend. It sounded so exotic. Plus, the chocolaty flavor in the description. I've never been one for dark coffee, but if it had a chocolaty undertone, I was in. Besides, the onetime cost of $20.13 for a pack of four (as of 07/23/2011) was reasonable.<br /><br />My cup of coffee is mixed with equal parts of cream, but my husband only uses a little. Both of us agree this is a smooth cup of coffee with no bitter taste. We love it so much that I've signed up for the subscribe and save plan. Now it's only $17.11 for a pack of four. Again, this is as of 07/23/2011.

review/summary: Mmmm, Lavazza
review/text: I first tasted and loved Lavazza espresso during time in Italy, where it's popularly consumed. The rich aroma and full flavor are a delight, and I don't find it overly acidic (it's certainly MUCH easier on my stomach than American-style drip coffee, and this from someone with strong stomach and a love of all kinds of drip coffees). I haven't tasted the various Lavazza roasts extensively, but I typically buy and adore Crema e Gusto--in fact, I brew it *every* single morning I'm at home and drink it latte-style, at about a 2:1 warmed-milk to hot-espresso ratio.<br /><br />I heartily recommend buying an authentic Italian stovetop coffeemaker to brew this espresso. I have and love the Bialetti six-cup caffettiere (Bialetti 6800 Moka Express 6-Cup Stovetop Espresso Maker, found here on Amazon). It's what the typical Italian family uses every morning and throughout the day.<br /><br />The Lavazza vacuum packs are sturdy and small little bricks that store easily, and every time I snip open a new container the distinctive, warm aroma rush fills my kitchen. Mmmm, Lavazza.

review/text: I was buying Lavazza Caffe Espresso at local vons for 5.99. Now it's 7.99 so I checked amazon. still more than 5.99 so I bought this, cheapest Lavazza for 18.98 with subscription.<br /><br />according to their website, Caffe Espresso is medium, this is dark roast and this has some sweetness.<br /><br />when i opened the package, soon i noticed this has a stronger aroma, a bitter kind. unlike starbucks italian dark roast, it's still brown.<br /><br />i used bialetti moka machine. usually make it latte. i think this is bitterer than Caffe Espresso and I feel some bitterness remains on my tongue. maybe this is more like natural Espresso taste but I prefer Caffe Espresso. and i have one opened pack and three unopened packs left...

review/summary: deeply satisfying
review/text: I needed to find a grind and roast that would fit my need for the taste I was used to with my home espresso machine, a high end Illy that broke and left me after 10 years of service! I went low tech and bought a Bialetti stainless steel 4 cup model with a valve system that creates foam and great crema. The Lavazza crema e gusto ground coffee works perfectly in this pot, only takes a few minutes to brew and the taste is wonderful, full bodied, rich and with no bitterness. For me, it lingers with a bit of smokiness and overtone of dark chocolate. Sometimes I place a very thin 99% cocoa square on the back of my tongue if I'm drinking this coffee later in the day and have a craving for something. It can distract me from many other more caloric choices!

review/summary: Been searching for good drip coffee
review/text: Yes i did say drip. I have now tried 2 different lavazza brands. This is the better of the two but do not discount the other as i love it equally. I will continue to buy both as i love the occasional change up. If you use this in a drip coffee pot i would suggest staring out with using just over half of the normal amount you usually use then move on from there. With other brands including starbucks i would use 1 - 1.5 scoops per cup. So in my 5 cup maker depending on what taste i was going after i would use up to 8 scoops. With both lavazza coffees i have found 3-3.5 scoops is ideal in my 5 cup maker. It takes a few times to get it in your head that so much less coffee works but it does.

Instead of buying the bialetti for the stovetop, I used my bodum french press despite of it being too fine ground. 2 Cups of hot microwaved water (getto style haha) with 1.5 scoop of coffee is perfect for me. Despite of it being very bold with the crema on top, I'm surprised that it doesn't taste bitter and sour at all! I added a bit of french vanilla, VERY TASTY! Get the individual brick if you're still not sure (sold by LaPrima Shops for $7.49)<br /><br />Try it, you'll love it!

(I should add that the shipping box was was in perfect condition.)<br /><br />Understandably, this type of thing can happen with packaging / stocking.  Still, I'm a little disappointed that on my first order, only 3 out of 4 packages are any good.

review/text: I tried to learn to like the taste, but it did not happen, no matter how hard I tried.  The coffee has a strange aroma and after taste (like some sort of a strong chemical), and I have been drinking Italian espressos all my life.  After I ran out of the 4 bricks, I also stopped getting the runs and stomach pains every morning.  No more rushing to the toilet after breakfast!  I initially believed I was beginning to have unknown health problems, but after quitting this coffee, I realized that my health was fine.  For some reason it worked out terribly for me.  Espresso drinking has always been a ritual of delight for me.  Aroma, color, taste, and the feel-good-effect after drinking the coffee should all combine to bring forth a unique moment of goodness.

review/summary: Best Espresso & Coffee so far..
review/text: I am a new espresso machine owner and am experimenting to find the best (least bitter) yet strong espresso.. I tried Cafe Bustelo which is decent and an Italian brand from grocery store. This brand is so far the smoothest yet still strong which is important to me. I also use in French Press when I am in the mood for good ole regular coffee.

review/summary: Strong and creamy
review/text: I had been using Illy's Dark Roast for my daily latte, but I was getting sick of the incredibly high price for one 8.8 ounce can. This Lavazza has the same strength, but with a hint of chocolate (best way to describe it, honestly) and I find it has a much smoother feel to it. Plus, I can get four 8.8 ounce bricks for the price of 2 Illy 8.8 ounce cans... Glad I switched!

review/text: We use this in our espresso maker and it makes a good latte, but I thought I'd be blown away by the "crema" part of the taste. Just tastes like a normal homemade espresso - nothing different than when we make it with Starbucks or whatnot. That said, great price if you do the Subscribe and Save....

review/summary: Not as robust as Cafe Bustelo
review/text: From the other reviews I thought this would be at least as full flavored as Cafe Bustelo but it's not. It's more mild and I prefer a deeper stronger coffee flavor. I do like the creamy texture of this coffee but not enough to switch to it. I may try other varieties by Lavazza since it gets such good reviews all the time.

review/summary: Better than Cafe Bustelo
review/text: I make espresso on a Krups machine with Cafe Lavazza. In comparison to Cafe Bustelo, which has a boring, but tolerable strong dark roast espresso flavor, Lavazza espresso has a more unique, rich syrupy flavor.<br /><br />However, if I compare Lavazza to the beans that I bought at Four Barrel in San Francisco last week, Lavazza's flavor seems pretty boring. I give it 4 stars because it is a great deal for the price and has good flavor.

review/summary: Go with Pro Plan
review/text: My puppy loves this stuff.  The vet recommends Purina Pro Plan over the cheap stuff like "puppy chow" because it has better ingredients and less fillers.<br /><br />My vet recommends the lamb formula as she says this is better for the puppies coat.  The puppy formula is formulated with DHA and vitamins, which are very important for a growing puppy.  You might want to ask your own vet which one is best for your pet, but I highly recommend Pro-Plan.<br /><br />Make sure if you are switching brands, you mix a little of the new one in with the one one and slowly introduce your puppy to the new food.  If you suddenly switch brands, your puppy/dog will most likely have diarrhea.<br /><br />Get a bigger bag if you have a growing pup as this stuff will go by quick. The cost per serving will be alot cheaper with a 30+ pound bag.

I even threw in 2 chopped boiled potato with a pinch of salt. My guest throughly enjoyed this sour curry as did I, which was not blazing spicy hot like many curry out there. It was just right. Would definitely buy again. (However, I ate this more as a soup with the required 4 parts water & 1 part curry (whole can)).

review/summary: Odd taste
review/text: I am a fan of other brands of hibiscus soda and hibiscus vodka so I thought this Torani syrup would be perfect. It's not undrinkable but the taste is artificial. The floral taste is too strong, giving it a weird (almost fishy) scent and aftertaste. I don't think I would get a second shipment after finishing these. This hibiscus syrup is better as a faint note than a dominant flavor.

review/summary: Marshalls Creek Thyme
review/text: If you read my other reviews of Marshalls Creek herbs you will see that I had some bad experiences with most of their herbs including this one.  These herbs come with a closed red cap (screw kind) and a sealed plastic banding, though this seams impressive the container is actually not sealed at all and as a result I had spider webs and mold "somehow" inside some of my herbs.  This was not the case with the Thyme, however the stem to thyme leaf ratio was not very good.  If you don't mind a lot of stem with your seasoning then this could be a good fit for you.  I don't recommend this by any means but you could do worse and as my wife told me I did in fact get what I paid for.

This "fresh thyme" give a horrible taste to the meal. Even if the product smell is acceptable, the fibers seems to contain mold (at least this is the taste it produces). The texture is mostly solid so is stem based not leaf.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product!

review/summary: Strong "perfume" odor and taste.  Yuck!
review/text: Having tried several of Krusteaz's products in the past and not being impressed, we decided to give them another try, this time their Gingerbread Cake and Cookie Mix.  Christmas was upon us, and gingerbread sounded good.  We purchased it at ALDI (a special buy) in December.  The expiration date was April 2013, so there's no question it was fresh.  I tried the gingerbread cake recipe on the side of the box.  Following the directions exactly, I mixed the ingredients and baked the cake at the recommended temperature until a toothpick inserted in the center came out clean.<br /><br />The first thing we noticed was the smell.  Gingerbread typically has a strong odor, but this was beyond strong.  It had an overbearing "perfumy" chemical odor that burned your nostrils.  After it cooled we served it with a little whipped cream.  We each tentatively took a bite and pushed it aside.  My throat burned for several minutes, and I could still taste it the next morning.  Needless to say we threw the rest of it out.<br /><br />This is not the first Krusteaz product we've wasted eggs, other ingredients, time, and money on.  We've tried their blueberry bread/muffin mix (extremely heavy), raspberry bars (heavy, perfumy), lemon bars (a soggy mess), some kind of orange bars (tough and dry), and chocolate chunk cookies (fell flat).  Without exception every Krusteaz product we've tried has been inedible.  The thing is our current oven is the best we've ever owned.  It bakes evenly and turns out beautiful cakes -- that is, when the cake mix or recipe is good.  Even our incredible oven can't help Krusteaz mixes.<br /><br />I contacted the company and was told that the remaining box of lemon bars I have is out of date.  There's no date on it, but I don't doubt that it's out of date since it's been in the pantry for a couple of years.  We had bought two boxes at the same time and tried one immediately only to have to throw out the whole pan.  I was just cleaning out the pantry and decided to call the company after the latest failure to deliver by one of their over-priced products (the gingerbread).  All they could offer was a coupon for a replacement Krusteaz product.  Thanks but no thanks.  The lady said, "It sounds like you just don't like our products."  Having tried several of your products I have to concur.  Because all of your products that we've tried are awful!  Judging by their prices their products should be the "Cadillac" of baking mixes, but they're anything but.  The stores here carry only a limited variety of Krusteaz products, and I think we've tried just about everything locally available and couldn't eat any of it.  We'll be sticking with Betty, Duncan, and Pillsbury from now on.

I also like that they have a cause associated with their drinks. So glad to see it is for sale here!

review/text: If you've tried the Green Thunder and you like it, order from here.  Product was delivered very quickly (next day? without me specifying that), in tact, and with no complaints whatsoever.<br /><br />If you have not tried the Green Thunder yet - Mio is like a liquid Crystal Light.  I was in love with the Peach Mango flavor (still am), but I ran out one day and went to the gas station to pick up another.  Turns out all my local station carries is Mio Energy.  Forced to pick between Black Cherry and Green Thunder, I picked the latter ... who wouldn't? :)<br /><br />So, Green Thunder only gets four stars because it's a little devoid of taste.  It has a taste, just not a robust wonderful taste like the peach mango version.  It is not unpleasant, though - just not very strong.  The taste is kind of citrusy, despite the fact that the finished product looks like a neon green Mountain Dew.<br /><br />However, I have been drinking this a couple times a day, and it gets me through the day with very little crash.  It is also a great conversation starter with its bright green color through a clear bottle - if you like having a conversation piece in your water, like I do!<br /><br />If it had a little more robust taste, it would get one more star.  But still, I recommend the Green Thunder.<br /><br />Jon

review/summary: Qaulity Dog Food
review/text: This IS a quality dog food.  It's high in protein and has a variety of ingredients, none of which caused me to say "what in the world is that?".  Unfortunately for me, though, it turns out that my puppy has sensitivity to gluten, and Barley is the 3rd ingredient listed for this food.  I'd recommend this food for someone who wants a high-quality food for their puppy, but doesn't need grain-free.  If your dog gets incredibly gassy and has strong smelling, soft poop or loose stools when eating this, I'd suggest switching to completely gluten-free dog food.

review/summary: Great for the price - look around
review/text: Switched my two dogs to this from blue buffalo (blue is a good food, just not right for my dogs). Natural balance seems to be easy on their stomachs, and they enjoy it.I can get it for about &42 in my area for a 35lb bag. That is much cheaper than some of the other upper end dog foods. I also find the recommended feeding amount keeps them slim and fit. My dad uses the adult food on his Shepard mix who has a sensitive stomach, and had great results.

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: Rarely can I say that a GF product tastes better than the gluten version.  Thse cookies do, though.  Melt in your mouth delicious, and just the right amount of lemon.  I am confident tht if you gave these to gluten eaters, they would not be able to tell the difference.

review/summary: Yummy lemony goodness
review/text: Although at first I wasn't sure about the texture of the wafers, I found these lemony wafers to be really addicting. The lemon filling flavoring is delicious and much better than the chocolate version of the same wafer. i would definitely buy this again!

review/summary: Love that lemon bite
review/text: When I first ate one I thought Wow... that is lemony and not sure if I liked it but by the end of "just trying one more" I was addicted. I have to hide them from my non-gluten free husband. He likes them better than the vanilla or lemon ones I used to buy for him in the grocery store that are not gluten free. I am trying to get a local store to carry them.
