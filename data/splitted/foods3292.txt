review/text: I originally bought this for Halloween but liked them so much I bought another. I put one bag in my niece's care box because she's away at school and I kept one for around the house. My biggest problem is that the pumpkins were smashed and some of the bars were broken. The first order I got was much, much nicer.

review/text: This was one of the most fantastic deals I have ever gotten from amazon.  Don't know if you had a lot of trick or treaters but if not you are lucky and have plenty to enjoy yourself.  Hershey's is a great product and the price of two small bags would cost more then these two packages of 50 pieces.  Great and happy I have some of my favorites left over and the Hershey bars are adorable with a Halloween design.

review/text: A previous reviewer on here was absolutely correct this is<br />a great buy. The candy is fresh. I have already dived into<br />the peanut butter ones. You get loads of candy for a very<br />reasonable price. Now I am already for Halloween altho<br />I also keep some on hand for postmen, ups, etc.(oh, also<br />including the plumber) and assorted little darlings<br />in my apt. bldg.Recently I purchased another bag but<br />this time, be warned most of the selection is peanut<br />butter ones and some chocolate ones but very few of the<br />white chocolate with minced nuts in it. Next time will<br />probably try a different site.

Oftentimes I brought it home with me whenever I visited or my daughter would send it because it is not available in my area. Found it on Amazon - what a wonderful surprise!  Now I can order whenever I like.  This is a medium roast coffee - very flavorful - a definite favorite.  I have also ordered the Cinnamon Hazelnut - equally as good.

review/text: I tell you what, it took me long enough to find this coffee in quantity.  I got it in a sampler and loved it.  The taste hits the mouth just right first thing in the morning and last thing in the evening.  Just most anytime.  I found it in quantity on Amazon and bought enough to last me a year, I hope!!  It is a great coffee, now it is a bit strong just in case you like a milder coffee. I think it comes in a milder one, I get the bold.  Parisian Nights by Timothy's is one of the best I have found in over 40 yrs. Buy it at Amazon.

I've always liked the flavor of Bromley so I placed an order.  However, as with Lipton, I find I have to use 2 bags to get a rich dark cup of tea using the Bromley.  I have continued to use the Bromley for iced tea, but have switched back to the British Blend for my hot tea. Much stronger and only 1 bag!

I opened and tried one because I wanted to know exactly what it was I was gifting and I like them a lot.  The ice cream feels chalking because of course it's freeze dried but I think that is what makes them so awesome.  Every other aspect of the ice cream tastes like the frozen stuff you get at your local supermarket.  Overall I think these are going to be perfect!

Another way of looking at it is eating a block of cotton candy that tastes like mint chocolate chip ice cream but with out the strong sugary taste of cotton candy. This is a great tasting way to enjoy mint chocolate chip ice cream with out it melting on you.

The tree continued to look worse and worse. I'm positive that I didn't do anything wrong. I watered it every day, made sure it was getting plenty of sunlight, and even misted the leaves.

The other has slight undertones of mango but they both taste so watered down it wasn't worth the $1.19 I paid per bottle. I wouldn't drink them again if they were free. Now I have to try to doctor them up to make them drinkable and not a complete waste. HORRIBLE that it has 20+ grams of sugar (it's the second ingredient on the panel as well) and they don't even taste like sugar water. I could put a teaspoon of sugar into a 8oz glass of water and get more flavor then this crap. Ahhh. That feels so "refreshing" to get it off my chest!

Great to drink alone or in your coffee and makes a tasty hot chocolate mix, better than any of those on the market today.

review/summary: Very nice to have on hand.
review/text: This is nice just to have in your pantry for those times you are out of milk and need some for baking, cooking, etc. It's a fine powdered whole milk not powdered skim milk, so has a good whole milk flavor.  Also good to keep around if you are just one person or even two, who don't drink much milk. If you need it for baking or whatever then you have it.

review/summary: Excellent quality powdered milk
review/text: Since the demise of "Mr. Milkman" powdered milk, I have looked for a comparable product.  Nido instant milk was suggested to me by other grieving former Milkman customers and I am so glad I tried it.  It has good whole milk quality.  Excellent taste and texture, especially compared to the low or no fat powdered milks that you find in the grocery store, which taste like chalk.  (Try finding powdered WHOLE milk at your local store - good luck!)<br /><br />It's perfect to add to a hot beverage.  It blends easily.  (This specific product does NOT have added sugar.  Beware, a children's version of Nido does.)  Although it is not Mr. Milkman, it's a close second.  And I am very grateful that I have found it.

review/text: Nido has become the powdered milk of choice for backpacking trips.  It's got a very creamy taste that goes great with oatmeal or cereal.  We pre-mix it would instant coffee (add a bit of cocoa too) for a tasty breakfast or after dinner caffeine fix.  Once you try this, you'll never go back to non-fat dry milk!

review/summary: Good taste, good mixability, good value in general, just be careful with humidity
review/text: I bought these four small cans because usually powdered milk can be very sensible to humidity. There are other choices, like a huge 4 pounds can, and in the end that can be cheaper. However, I prefer to pay a little bit higher and can 4 small cans, its convenient ... unless you have 5 children.<br /><br />Well going to the product: this is is powdered milk made un Mexico. The taste is really good, for sure much better than any 2% fat milk that you can buy in the supermarket. How does it compare to the taste of 4% fat fresh milk (say for instance Horizon, Or Archer farms)? Well I say that the flavor is the same, parhaps the powdered milk has even better taste since it feels a little bit creamier. However, you have to understand that how creamier it feels dependend on respecting the suggested proportion (4 tablespoons per 236 cubic centimeters).<br /><br />For me the taste is GREAT. Also the preparation is really good, my recomendation is to buy some Shaking glass or use and Hydratation bottle to shake the mix and you will get perfectly homogeneous milk. I use and hydratation bottle at work to prepare my milk, eventually mix it with powdered smoothies like Vega Whole Food Shake.<br /><br />Summarizing: its a really convenient product, tastes like fresh milk (or better), it mixes very well with cold water, the price/liter is very competitive compared to good brands of milk (e.g. Horizon) and you don't need a fridge. The only precaution you should know is that powdered milk is very sensible to humidity and fungus, so I recommend good storage, ALWAYS USE AN ABSOLUTELY DRY SCOOP so that you don't introduce humidity into the can.

review/summary: GREAT in morning coffee!!!
review/text: This powdered whole milk is fantastic in coffee.  We usually drink 2% milk, and I found that when I would use my K cup coffee machine and add 2% cold milk to the freshly made coffee, I would always have to microwave the coffee to get it back to being hot enough to drink.  This slowed down the instant dire need for a great cup of morning Joe, and made the K cup process too slow!  I was looking for a milk product to store for emergency food, when I came across this product.  I bought it, and had to try it out.  I never got around to making "milk" with it as it is just so good in coffee!  3 heaping teaspoons in a 12 oz "black magic" K cup coffee and stir.  It is so smooth, and rich, and it does not take away any heat, so no need to re-heat in the microwave!  I went through the entire #10 can using it that way, and sharing it with others to let them try it, they too love it, and have ordered it.  It does come in smaller containers.<br /><br />About that "emergency food" use, I called Nestle and it only has about a year shelf "use by" date stamped on it, and all they would say is "it is best to use it before the use by date stamp" and they would not say how long it actually would last, unopened. They did say that when it is made into milk, it should be used within 24 hours which was a surprise to me.  It is made in Mexico, but by Nestle's stated very high standards and they said their quality control is as high as in the states there.<br /><br />I am storing a smaller container on our camping trailer for those times we run out of milk, with no stores nearby, and since I am going through it quickly enough, I will have a couple cans on hand for "emergency food" but will have to rotate them within a year.  If anyone has used powdered milk  way past the "use by date" please tell us here in the reviews...

review/text: I bought this, thinking it would be good to have on the shelf. Finally opened the can, put some with water in a container, shook it up and refrigerated it. I had it on my cereal and can't tell the difference between this and whole bottled milk from the store! But the real taste test was when I asked my husband to eat some of the cereal and give me his opinion. He thought I wanted to know how the cereal tasted and he detected no difference in the quality of the milk in the bowl! When I told him, he said, 'Let me start using this stuff for my coffee (he's the only one in the household who uses milk in his coffee...) Now, THAT was a taste test passed with flying colors.

review/summary: This seriously tastes like real milk!
review/text: This is the same consistency as real milk and looks and tastes just like it! I am shocked at how good this is. I was just hoping I could make do in a pinch but this is good enough to drink or use in cereal or anything. It always seems like I am out of milk when I am craving cereal but I will never be out of milk again now that I have discovered this stuff. It mixes up quickly and easily. No lumps or anything. I put it in a glass pitcher and it makes it seem even better.  Note: As you can see in the photo, some of the label is in Spanish. But it isn't hard at all to figure out how much you need. The instructions are in English though if you look for it. You can add more or less water depending on what consistency you like. I am very pleased with this product and will definitely buy it again!

I start at 6 and don't always eat before I head out. I bought small 3" X 4" jewelry Ziplock bags and made up 1 cup servings.  I keep a couple at work and the others at home. My milk is always "fresh" and since I have a small fridge, I just make it as needed. Since I make it pre-measured in single serving size, it's easy for kids to use as well. I drink it ice cold and it's great.

review/summary: tastes like baby formula
review/text: I have been trying to build up a reasonable supply of shelf stable supplies in case of emergency (or just to avoid going to the store for a few days longer). I knew milk would be challenge, so I ordered Nido and Saco to compare. Nido tastes like baby formula and I find that to be so repulsive that I breastfed all my kids partly to avoid smelling it myself! Buy the Saco!!! It's really quite good even though it's fat free. If you want it to taste more like whole milk, you can add more powder. Nido has full fat, so it may be a useful product for very young children who should not be drinking skim milk. I will be using mine up in soup and mashed potatoes (great for that actually), as I could not even stand it in coffee. Again I urge you to try the Saco for a more natural taste. It also mixes very nicely and is available in one quart envelopes as well as the large box. P.S., the days of buying powdered milk because it's cheaper are long gone. Fresh milk is a far better deal in most large grocery stores.

review/summary: Dark Roast Surprise!
review/text: My organization recently installed a keurig machine in our break-room.  We couldn't decide which flavors to order so we decided on several variety packs.  We couldn't be happier! We have continued to order the variety packs and have ordered the dark roast 35 k-cup variety pack many times over.  It's always a nice mix of different products.  This pack included brooklyn brand which was new to us, and it was well received.

review/summary: Good sampler
review/text: I just bought my first Keurig and wasnt really sure what k-cups to buy since my usual coffee brand doesn't make them.  This has a great variety, but be warned- this contains decaf!  I am no good at reading labels (or anything) before I've had my coffee which made for some interesting mornings.  It really does have a nice variety though.

review/text: Who Buys a Kuerig and drinks Decaf? This was a good mix but almost half of them were decafs, One of the K cups was opened too so the box was filled with grounds. This just seems like someone through their left overs in a box and charged people for them. Probably won't by again, but you live and learn.

review/summary: I don't know why this syrup has so many good reviews - It's nothing special.
review/text: This "dark chocolate" sauce tastes just like any cheap chocolate syrup you could buy at the grocery store to make chocolate milk. It's marginally tastier that your standard name-brand chocolate syrup, but it still tastes cheap and fake. If you're looking for something that truly tastes rich and dark-chocolatey, this is not it. Wish I hadn't spent the money.

review/summary: Great For Mocha Iced Coffee!
review/text: I use this along with some starbucks via to make a Mocha iced coffee! if you keep it in the fridge it's almost like fudge, it's thick but not too thick. great over iced cream, dissolves in milk too if you like dark chocolate milk, it tastes sweet but not too sweet and truly has a dark chocolate taste to it. It comes in a case of 6 bottles and each bottle lasts you quite a bit. my case expires in 11/2012 so I have pleanty of time to use it all considering there's 4 iced coffee drinkers in my household and everyone likes this stuff. It would be good dipped in fruit also. I like cold strawberries and bananas with it.

review/text: I first tried this sauce in a mocha at the Bourbon Cafe in NYC and was hooked. I was delighted to find out that Amazon sold it! The only disadvantage is that it's very difficult to get the sauce(like hot fudge) out of the container. Microwaving it for 10 seconds helps it flow better.

review/summary: Great sauce.  Great package.
review/text: The best widely-available chocolate sauce I've tried, including Torani and even Ghiradelli.<br />I have previously bought this in 64oz bottles, four at a time, for home use.  Yeah, I have a bit of a mocha problem.<br />The big bottles last forever, but these squeeze bottles are very convenient and take up less space on the counter.<br /><br />Another huge plus is when the bottle is empty you can wash them in the dishwasher and reuse them.  They work great with thinner stuff like oils and syrups.  They're designed to sit upside down and the plastic is translucent so you can see how much is in the bottle.

review/summary: Not as good as the reviews are to me
review/text: I tried this brand because of its packaging. I bought the 6 bottle pack because my preferred brand came in industrial size. The syrup is nothing special and I would not consider it dark chocolate. Hershey's tastes more chocolatey than this does. I like that it is made with real sugar vs. HFCS. I won't be buying it again, but I will use the bottles to repackage my industrial size choice.

review/text: I'm a big fan of Starbucks mochas, and this sauce is so close to what I'm used to, I am saving so much money just making my mochas and mocha frapaccinos at home. I use a Bialetti 3 cup espresso maker/perculator which makes some espresso-like coffee in 4 minutes, dump it into a cup and add this sauce, then put some milk in my small french press and put in the microwave for a minute or so. After a few pumps up and down with the french press, it is foamy and creamy and I dump it into the cup and stir everything together, so tasty!

review/summary: Good for oatmeal at work
review/text: This is the first dried fruit item (other than raisins, prunes, etc, of course) that I've tried and it fits the bill just fine to add to oatmeal at work.  No worry about having to refrigerate either, and you always have something to eat.  (I use a little four cup Pyrex bowl w/lid in the microwave).  Amazon has about the cheapest price/oz that I've been able to find.<br /><br />This company recently added a bunch of organic dried products, including apples, but they are at least twice the price per oz, and I can't quite justify that for myself.  I hope they adjust the price of their organic apples down a little in the future.

review/text: I have been eating these things for years, and was thrilled to see that I could order them from amazon.<br /><br />I eat them as a snack, just grab a handful and go.  My kids (5 and 4) love these as well.  We make a snack mix out of the Just Apples, Just Strawberries, and Craisins.  I've added them to oatmeal and they are good that way too.<br /><br />They are addictive, so be careful not to eat too many.  A small handfull is about equal to a whole apple.

review/summary: Tastes great, don't like the shape
review/text: I love the taste of these, but I don't like the shape.  The apples have been cut into thin strips, which are actually uncomfortable to bite into.  They don't hurt or anything, but they are a little awkward.  I think the reason they are the shape they're in is because they still have the skin on them.  I do like that because the skin has so many of the nutrients.<br /><br />These taste very good.  And there is no sulfur or any other additives, so all you get is the apple.

review/text: In a word? Runa Guayuas is cool.  The peppermint is my favorite flavor.  The taste is simple and delicious without the sometime bitter taste other teas tend to develop if they are steeped too long.  What I really like about this product is that even though it has quite a bit of caffeine there  is no jittery or jolted feeling after I drink it but just the feeling of being totally awake.  I have been substituting this in for coffee especially in the afternoon and I really like it.<br /><br />I highly recommend giving this product a try! Not convinced?  Runa is a socially responsible company who works close with the farmers in Ecuador who grow their Guayusa.  Their story is inspiring and this is a business worth supporting!<br /><br />Cheers!

review/text: The guayusa, as always, gives that nice balanced boost that I've come to love. However, the ginger balance of this really does it. To be honest I think ginger is usually an overwhelming flavor in a lot of teas, and this one does it right. The orange adds a hint of tart sweetness (no, that's not an oxymoron) that really rounds it out.<br /><br />One note for the prior review, while it may be cheaper on other sites, for this product the shipping options actually make it cheaper than where I've seen it pretty much anywhere else.

review/text: This is by far my favorite guayusa. There's an incredibly solid blend of just enough of the hint of the smooth, clean guayusa taste with a refreshing crispness of peppermint. I have struggled with stomach problems for years and significantly cut down on coffee as a result. The peppermint guayusa is great as peppermint is actually a known stomach calmative. As always the balanced energy effect is exactly what I need for that 3PM pick-me-up.

I actually can feel the difference when I drink this tea, energized but not jittery, focused and the taste of this tea is like no other. Besides supporting these local farmers buying this tea also supports the rainforest as this tea is grown under shade. I can not say enough good things about this tea and highly recommend this product....

review/summary: Crap-e Diem
review/text: I apologize to the makers of this drink for saying this, but it is just not good. At all. To be honest I think it tastes curiously like mouthwash. I can't really get past that and enjoy it. It's almost like mint tea that has waaaaay too much sugar in it or something. I am a HUGE fan of Synergy/GT's Kombucha, but I thought I'd try this because it's slightly cheaper. I have to say that the Synergy is well worth the extra $12 per 12 bottle case (I purchase the cases at Whole Foods for $35).<br /><br />Even if I could get past the minty mouthwash taste, I still have to question the health benefits of this brand of Kombucha given the ingredients list. It reads: Lightly carbonated water, sucrose, herbal tea blend, Kombucha cultures, lactobacilli, acerola juice concentrate. You don't even get to kombucha until the fourth ingredient - and that comes after water and sugar?? One can drink seltzer water with sugar and "herbal tea" for much cheaper than $23/12 bottles. Seriously. Spend the extra few bucks and buy the Synergy, whose ingredients are as follows (this is for the "Trilogy" flavor): 95% GT's organic raw kombucha, raspberry juice, lemon juice, fresh pressed ginger juice, and 100% pure love.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you want mint soda, then by all means, seize the day. If you want real, raw kombucha with health benefits AND a delicious taste, go for Synergy/GT's Kombucha.
