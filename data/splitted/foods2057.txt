review/summary: Great ears, great service
review/text: Each cow's ear came shrink wrapped for freshness and in a large display box.  The display box was inside an additional box which took a lot of wear but kept the inner box safe.  The entire package came several days before I was expecting it.  I was really pleased with the service.

review/summary: Very Tasty and Healthy Low Fat Treat for Dogs
review/text: I am always looking for healthy treats for my dogs. I stumbled on cow ears in my local pet store and my dogs fell in love with them! I usually like to give them some variety in their treats but they get soooo exited when I pull out the cow ears that I stock up on the ears. If you decide to try cow ears, I strongly suggest that you stay with the Merricks brand. This is a company that has a reputation for very high quality items. Their cow ears are all natural, no preservatives and very low in fat. Other ears, like pig ears, are greasy and fatty - these cow ears are not. There is no greasy residue and no icky smell with the cow ears and they won't stain your carpet. An added plus is that they do a nice job in helping to keep teeth clean. My vet always comments about how good my dogs teeth and gums look. That is an added bonus as dental cleaning for dogs can be pricy and any help with keeping teeth and gums healthy is wonderful! My dogs get an ear about once or twice a week. Warning - they will be scarfed down pretty quickly so don't be surprised. I prefer to purchase these on Amazon as they are cheaper, even with shipping, than purchasing them anywhere else I have looked.

review/summary: Fantastic
review/text: This is a great price for what seems like a high-quality, natural dog chew. These last longer for my GSD than more expensive bully sticks, so I appreciate the good alternative. The individual plastic wrapping has air holes in it, so I'm not sure it contributes to freshness, and so seems a little wasteful, but I suppose it's packaged that way for stores to resell individually. I'm still glad to have access to the good rate and appreciate the good product.

review/summary: Good... but horrible smell
review/text: This is my 4th bulk order of cow's ears -- one of the previous orders was from Merrick and a couple others from competing companies. But this is the first time the ears have had a room-filling, horrible smell while the dog is chewing them, very similar to the odor of some bully sticks. Never once has this been an issue with cow's ears for us, so I don't know if this is a fluke, or maybe these are especially fresh (though the other Merrick order also came with plastic wrapped ears), or maybe these are somehow past their prime (not sure if that's possible with dried, wrapped ears...) but this box is a different experience. The dog seems to love them just the same, however this is also the first time he's had stomach upset after a cow's ear, though that too may be a total fluke, and he might have just swallowed too big a piece, so I can't link it to the quality of the ears at all. Just noting that this particular order has been different for us, and I'm wondering if anyone else has had similar issues.

review/text: If you want a new way of preparing this pudding, try this if you have a strong blender. Put the fat free milk in the freezer and after it freezes put it in the blender. Blend it a little and then add the pudding mix and you can add some sweetener like Splenda if you like it super sweet. After it has been completely mixed put it in the freezer again for two hours and enjoy:)

review/text: I have been using the Jello pudding for a number of years as a treat in my weight management program.  We have noticed that many of our supermarkets here in the desert do not carry all the flavors of this pudding and we began looking for them in every market where we shopped.  Finally I went to Amazon, a place where I can find anything I want to buy at a good price, and ordered 3 flavors.  We now have an assortment of the flavors we love, pistashio, butterscotch and chocolate whenever we want to make it for ourselves and we are happy campers.

review/summary: Best chicken broth
review/text: In my experience, this is the best tasting chicken broth you can buy, hands down.  No other broth is close.  We do a lot of cooking and I love to make my own homemade soups, stews, etc, but sometimes you don't have time to make your own stock.  That's when we turn to the Swanson (full salt) chicken broth.<br /><br />Before you ask, yes, we've tried all the other options at the various markets around us (Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, SuperFresh, Safeway) and nothing else compares.<br /><br />Also, the funny thing is that the Swanson Low-Sodium broth doesn't compare either (even after you add in additional salt.  The low-sodium version has a much gamier smell and flavor.  Definitely go with the full salt version (even if you have to water it down to decrease the sodium density).  The umami flavor you get in this broth is incomparable relative to its peers.

My girl has not had any issues of vomiting since we've switched over a few months ago.<br /><br />My dog also gobbles it right up! She loves it! She used to pick at her food all day, but with this food once I fill up her dish she eats it right up! My girl seems to have lots of energy and I'm so happy we found this food at such a great price on amazon.

Well, sometimes, even if it's not what our organic guru and holistic selves think is "good", it is. This food is specifically formulated from the size of the chunks - to the nutritional value for our boxers.<br /><br />It's called preventative medicine - kind of like changing the oil on your car...when you give them the food that is designed specifically for them - THEY DON'T GET SICK.<br /><br />Splurge...you'll save in the long run on vet bills.

review/text: I have been feeding boxer 26 for three months now with great results. My boxer is less gassy and eats her food much more slowly due to the specialized shape of the kibble. She has also increased in muscle mass although this may be attributed to her 18 month age. She loves this food and eats all of it every time. The feeding recommendations on the bag seem to be right on as well. Buying through amazon prime saves us a little over twenty dollars a month from our local petco's price.

Yes, it is hard to find, but this price is reasonable to the prices I've found it for in the Korean markets. Yuzu is SO flavorful (truly something you have to taste for yourself to believe!), a very nice, pure and clean citrus flavor withouit any of the bitterness! Great with seafoods, crab cakes, desserts, etc! Substitute it for lemon juice in any recipe and the flavor is a tremendous difference! Please give this a try!! Just a note, if you store in the top/back of fridge, it does seem to freeze easily, so beware!

review/text: The product itself is amazing.. I love it and have been using it for years. My problem is the company that sold it to me, this case Taylor's Market.<br />I ordered it and arrived on time but it arrived opened. The cap was loose, the protective plastic was still on and complete. The cap being loose let air in and got in contact with the citrus liquid which of course over the time of the shipment it got an awful bitter taste. So my long wait was rewarded with a bitter oxidized product.<br /><br />I called the next day and complained about this and fully explained the problem and nature of my complain, they immediately shipped another one to replace it.<br />A couple of days later he same problem arrived; Cap loose, product ruined.<br /><br />Very frustrated and disappointed, I decided to switch to another seller.

Originally got the yuzu juice to be able to make a cocktail we were so impressed with but have ended up using it in marinades and other recipes.  So glad I found it on Amazon!  Could not find it locally at the Asian markets, even though we have a large Asian population - they had never even heard of it.<br /><br />Yuzu juice is hard to pinpoint in flavor: it's like lemon, tangerine, lime, and maybe grapefruit all together. It is truly unique and tart - so use as you would any citrus juice.  Great in so many applications!<br /><br />Will definitely be ordering this again!

I made lemon bars and substituted yuzu and everyone at work loved them.  It made super lemon curd (I'll probably not use lemon for this for quite a while).  My next experiment is using it for a lemon cake to take to a picnic with friends or a calamondin pie.  Not too tart, not too sweet, not sure I can pinpoint the exact flavor to say what it tastes like except to say it tastes like a lot of different citrus in one smooth flavor.  Am ordering another bottle so I don't run out.

Well rinds are not so easy to get but the freshly harvested juice is so tasty, you can use for salad dressing, marinades, especially fish and chicken.  The producer seems to be a family owned? business in Kyushu, where this fruit is abundant. Right now, I added a few frops in my tea and they taste heavenly and relaxing.

review/summary: Save Your Money...Not Tasty at All
review/text: I just bought these Cinnabon Candy Canes today because they looked unique and tasty.<br /><br />I am sorry to say that these are the worst candy canes I've ever tasted.<br /><br />They SMELL absolutely fabulous....like they should be foodie fan's candle or air freshener. I would even stretch as far to say that they SMELL like a good attempt to be a cinnamon roll.<br /><br />The "taste" is pitiful. I say "taste" because there is barely any flavor....all of the "flavor" is from the scent, and not actually in your mouth. It's hard to describe...it smells like it would be delicious, but completely lacks flavor.<br /><br />Save your money, or buy regular butterscotch candies if you want a creamy, baked-good type candy, which would be 100 times better than these candy canes.

review/summary: Good but organic has it's drawbacks
review/text: If you are looking for a healthy version of minute maid's berry punch this may be your best bet. It is  sugar and preservative free; it reads that it can ferment on you and to check the pouches regularly for lumps of growth. That is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Also, this isn't super sweet and doesn't have a strange after taste. Something about it gives it a mild tart taste and I can taste the raspberry and apple juice more than the strawberries and pears added. I bought this b/c I read on the company website (B2N) that 1 pouch was equal to 1/2 cup of fruit. The juice comes in the colorful pouch that is aluminum colored in the back and is clear. So, you don't have to worry about little kids spilling it all over your carpet or their clothes. I am in college and love these for breaks. They freeze well and haven't found them to leak any faster than capri sun pouches. If you're into sugary sweet products, this may take some getting use to. My sister whose in hs loves capri suns and is a candy and junk food fanatic and she wasn't too crazy about trying these. When she did she thought it taste strange, but she finished it. And went for more later on. So for a kid who couldn't care less about organic food and health to go back for more; these things must be good. My mom is heavy on junk food and said they were alright. She prefers minute maid and her pepsi, but said she would consider incorporating these juice packs or something similar into her grocery list. I got the 4 pack via amazon since they only sell the crackers and cookies near me. I am happy w/my purchase and will purchase again.

review/summary: Healthy & Helpful
review/text: The Back To Nature Juice is very healthy for children. The taste is great and the pouches are great for traveling. My children thought they were the same as Caprisun so they didn't notice a difference in taste which was great. I selected these as a healthier alternative for my children with Autism. They only complaint I have is the packaging however it could very well be the delivery Amazon choose. These were brought by UPS and upon opening after ordering a few times a few had burst inside of the box. Amazon was very courteous about replacing it. The packaging is the only reason why I'm giving 4 stars.

review/summary: As Good As I Remembered
review/text: Having chosen this orange cake mix as a favorite when I was younger, especially during the summer, it was upsetting when it was pulled from the stores. When I found sellers in Amazon selling it I bought a box of six mixes. Baked in sheet cake form, with whipped cream for frosting and mandarin orange segments placed on top, it was as good as I remember with a noticeable flavor of orange, and the anticipated moistness Duncan Hines delivers. It is a rare treat to enjoy once again, and the price seemed reasonable enough. With only me to enjoy them, the six boxes had better last a year or two.

review/text: The dressing is one of the best I have tasted. However one (1) out of the six (6) bottles in the order was leaking around the seal to such an extent that the entire outside of the bottle was coated with oil. Because I was unsure of how long the seal had been defective and therefore the "safety" of the contents I discarded the bottle. A 1-in-6 failure rate has put this product in the category of "not worth reordering."

I JUST LIKE THESE THINGS.  and they go so fast that, apparently, I have to order 12 at a time to keep up with the demand in my house.  i don't know anything for certain, but my hypothesis is that these seeds come from those huuuuugemongous pumpkins that you see on TV.  You know, the ones that win world records and stuff.  The ones that people carve out and make hollow, then use as small watercraft and race against each other.  Those pumpkins.  Why do I think that?  Cuz these seeds are *Paul Bunyan* big.  Also, and this is no lie, my dogs love them too.  I'm just throwing that out there.<br /><br />how many did you add to your cart?  -- ADD MOAAR.

review/text: I have been using Spectrums brand for a year now. I use it for hair, cooking, oil pulling, as a body moisturizer, and as a air fresher in my oil burner. Recently I made the mistake of trying other brands. I will never do that again. I'm from the islands so I know the true quality of unrefined coconut oil. I promise Spectrums Unrefined coconut oil is honestly the best quality, texture, and organic scent. I will never venture out again.

review/summary: this sucks
review/text: I bought three boxes of this. The first package I made, the cupcakes fell in the center and I followed the directions exactly. I chalked it up to a fluke and a few months later made another box. They didn't fall this time, but the consistency was just not right...crunchy. I threw the third box away and won't buy again. Keep in mind, I usually make things from scratch and am an experienced baker so I don't think the error was on my end, maybe the packages were old.

review/summary: changed formula
review/text: For those of you who have purchased this product previously, be warned. When they changed the packaging they also changed the formula. "jasmine flowers" are no longer listed as an ingredient, and you really can't taste them in the product anymore. Since that was one of the things I liked best about the product, I won't be purchasing it again. It's too bad because they had a great product that made it worth the high price tag.

review/summary: Ito En Tea's Tea Jasmine Green Tea, Unsweetened
review/text: Bought this item 4/11 which was made in Japan. Simply Extraordinary. My wife and I liked it so much I bought 6 more cases (8/11) but this batch is made in Thaland. The bottle is slightly diferrent, without the green leaf emblem on the front as pictured. This new version is absolutely inferior to the original ones I had. Don't get me wrong, it is still good but I would not buy it even at the discounted price currently offered on Amazon. I have read other reviewers who suggested they changed the formula. Whatever it is, it tastes  strong like the regular cheap tea I usually get at the Chinese restaurants and the after taste is completely different. I almost wanted to return the shipment but didn't want to go through the hassles. Buyers beware<br /><br />Update 7/14/12:<br />I saw a comment from other buyer that he/she received a Japan made batch. I went ahead and ordered 2 cases. Sure enough, they are now Made in Japan. The interesting thing is this batch tasted "watered down", exactly like another reviewer said!!! I now understand what he/she meant. Bottom line: there is definitely some quality consistency issue here (at least post Tsunami time). It is batch dependent, facility dependent ( have seen Thailand made, Japan Made, and have seen comments about Hawaii Made!). Good luck to all who seek good tea. I have switched to brewing my own tea and bought the tea from Eto En directly.

review/summary: Made in Japan 4-26-12
review/text: I have been drinking these way too much. I get two cases every month or more.  I have always enjoyed this tea and the flavor has been very pleasing, oddly I never looked at the origin, I assumed it was Japan but to be honest, I have nothing against Thailand and their ability to make tea.  I know they are not as sophisticated as the Japanese(who is?) but I have faith they can combine leaves and hot water to make tea if instructed in this fine art by their Japanese overlords.  So after seeing comments that some the Teas'Tea were coming from Thailand I thought I would check it out.  I just got a new shipment and sure enough it said Japan.  So, maybe things have changed or maybe they ship from both places but as of 4-26-12 mine was still coming from the land of the rising sun.

review/text: I gave this product the highest rating when I first reviewed it.  Now I have found out that jasmine flowers are no longer one of the ingredients. Why the best ingredient would be removed is beyond my comprehension - oh, I just realized it probably has something to do with money (duh).<br /><br />I can't recommend this tea. Now I make my own jasmine tea (with flowers). I hope the company returns to their original recipe.

If you miss the Jasmine Flower ingredient, scent and taste, switch to this and you'll have your "old" beloved tea back! Do note that the white label switch will cost you another $2.97 via Amazon's Subscribe and Save...I think it's worth it though, and if you love this tea as much as I do, you will too!<br /><br />Here's the link to the Japanese White Label Jasmine Flower Green Tea:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RTNBSA">Ito En Jasmine Green Tea Unsweetened, 16.9 Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />Now, if I could only limit myself to drinking just one bottle a day...:)

review/summary: LOVE this tea!
review/text: This tea is the best! it is kind of pricey but really is the tastiest unsweetened tea you can find and i feel great after drinking it.  I used to go to Chinatown to find it, they sell it in larger bottles and they are about $3 for the big bottle. But nowadays i'm so busy, it's too much of a headache to take the trip & transport it back.  I'm glad amazon sells ITO EN teas so i have the option of just have them delivered to my door if i'm too busy or feeling lazy.  Although i just found out through wegman's online site that they stock this size & the larger size ITO EN teas at some of their stores. I think i will head over there today as the 16.9 oz. size teas are all listed at $1.50 to $1.75 which is cheaper than amazon. Plus i would like to buy one each of other flavors i have not tried yet.  :)

We need more unsweetened, tasty teas out there, but despite what innovation is to come, I expect this one will remain the pinnacle of its category.  Yum.

review/summary: From a real tea snob
review/text: I have the yixing clay teapot, I buy tea that can go up to the triple digits, I'm a total tea snob.  I LOVE good tea, LOVE it.<br /><br />So, having "fresh green tea" in a bottle sounded uhm, suspect at best.<br /><br />No, this is delicious!  Obviously, this wont stand up to standards of extremely expensive teas, but ito-en makes excellent teas to begin with, and these are brewed to perfection.  Quick, convenient, very healthy, and SO delicious, and I'm a harsh critic.<br /><br />I go through them like water now.  I have a subscription ordering 2-3 crates of tea per month now :3 I may increase the amount of crates per delivery now though.  It's so good!  Not only that the bottle is attractive, the mouth piece is comfortable (a thicker, white, higher quality plastic) and the ergonomic square shape lets there be more tea in the tea in the bottle for a smaller size.<br /><br />I love this stuff, its a great value for the price (currently $23 for a case of 12) is very reasonable considering how much I pay per bottle in the store!<br /><br />However, it is imperative, as I should hope one would know, that you do drink the tea within 2-3 days at most.  Leaving it open longer will alter the taste for the worse :x

review/text: I am always on the lookout for something refreshing and unsweetened. Most green tea beverages have an unappealing (to me) bitterness. Not this Jasmine Green.

Great on a hot and humid day.

Now I can buy Teas' Tea Jasmine Green Tea quickly and easily. It's rather expensive, but soooo good! It's only ingredients are purified water, jasmine green tea and ascorbic acid (vitamin C). The taste is light and utterly refreshing. I'd take this unsweetened tea over any kind of sweetened tea any time. After you get used to it, regular iced tea just will never suffice. I wonder how long it will be before this stuff starts appearing in restaurants. I haven't noticed any as yet. Believe me, it's only a matter of time.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: My favorite tea of all time even beating my old standby Constant Comment.  All of these Ito En Teas are great.  I also love the rose tea in this line but this is redolent of the finest jasmin both in scent and flavor. I have this on the monthly delivery plan but I also buy it in between deliveries as this is my daily fix which I look forward to.  How do they get that amazing tea flavor, aside from the heavenly jasmin?<br />I really was not a daily tea drinker until I discovered this at Whole Foods but this is so much more convenient.  No additives, no sugar, no sucrose, no harsh acidic taste. I am thinking of Snapple here which is soo addictive but not in a good way since it has some additives which aren't too great for my body. It has Sorbitol in particular which absolutely sends my intestines into convulsions.<br />This tastes pure and fresh.  I'm so happy Amazon has it.

review/summary: Original formula was a truly fantastic tea
review/text: In checking to see if the 2 liter size of the Teas' Tea Green Jasmine tea happened to be available via Amazon, I was curious to see what others were saying about my very favorite green tea product.<br /><br />In reading that a self-proclaimed 'tea snob' was raving about the product, I found myself not surprised (& delighted, frankly).<br /><br />It's nice to know that others find the Teas' Tea Green Jasmine tea to be exceptional - I can recall my surprise when first tasting this tea, as it reminded me of the best tea I'd ever had, years ago, in a favorite Korean restaurant.<br /><br />This product is, by far, the best already-brewed tea product - & of any kind - that I've ever tasted.  Various brewed teas are quite strong, or otherwise have aspects of bitterness, funky acidity, &/or, as seems to so often be the case, many are littered with sweeteners (whether sugar or any among the range of artificial sweeteners dumped in so many products).  This tea, however, is so light, smooth, & refreshing (& free of any sweetener), that I can essentially drink it as though it were water.<br /><br />I can only hope that the manufacturer didn't & doesn't mess with whatever process(es) & ingredients are involved with this product - & that they keep it the way it is.<br /><br />Edited to add: the original review was specific to the original formula (the one with Jasmine Flowers listed in the ingredients) - in learning that they have changed the formula, I'll refrain from purchasing the product.  ITO EN, Please bring back the original formula!

review/text: We serve this sauce at the high-end cafe in which I work.  I stumbled across it in the dry storage area after being curious as to whether it was a bottled product.<br /><br />It is sweet, in fact I would say it is the least spicy thing you could have.  There are things that have no spiciness in them at all, this is the lowest step above that.  In fact, we serve it with coconut shrimp.  When I first had it, I thought it tasted like the thick raspberry vinegrette dressing we served at another place I worked.  We also mix it with hoisin sauce for some dishes.<br /><br />Overall - I cannot recommend this enough!  It is good on coconut shrimp, fried chicken tenders, chicken breasts, and with a little beef brisket (these are all ways I've tried it!).<br /><br />As a bonus - it is actually HEALTHIER than the Heinz ketchup bottle it was sitting next to, go figure!  (I read the nutritional info).
