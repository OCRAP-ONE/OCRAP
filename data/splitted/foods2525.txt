review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: With all the high reviews maybe we just got a bad batch because I wasn't impressed at all. I have had tuna packed in water in the past and you could just crack the top open slightly and drain the water out leaving nice flake tuna. When I tried this with the first can nothing came out. I went ahead and opened the can all the way. The contents looked like mush loaded with white fatty grease. I tried scooping some of the fat off the top but it went well beyond the top. I gave it 2 stars rather than one since after making it into tuna salad with mayo and relish and such, it didn't taste bad. The initial look of it alone though made it difficult to enjoy. The cat doesn't seem to mind it. I won't buy it again.

review/summary: WORST TUNA I HAVE EVER PURCHASED
review/text: I am not exaggerating when I say this is the worst tuna I've ever had.  EVER.  I cannot even call it tuna, it is more like fish pulp.  It is a soggy mess of tiny flakes of very old-tasting tuna all mixed with water, and it is so mushy you cannot even drain it.  It is close to inedible and only good in the case of the Apocalypse or some other dire emergency.  I can't believe Chicken of the Sea sells inedible crap like this.  I would not pay 20 cents a can for it.  It is really not even good to feed to a dog because of the salt content.  However, I rinsed it as well as I could and fed it to the dog.  He seemed to think it was ok.

review/summary: there' something fishy about this tuna
review/text: my wife tried making tuna sammies for me with this meat. she would prepare it the night before, and by the time i wanted to eat it the next day for lunch, it would have very strong fishy smell. strong enough to where i did not want to eat it (and i am NOT a fussy eater). we did not have this problem with other tuna (i don't recall what brands, it could have been the same). so we only use it for same time consumption or for cooking.

You can't rinse it because it all goes down the drain as a liquid mess, and if you are lucky enough to squeeze the water out, you wind up with less than half a can of mush.  Even my cats won't eat it.  You're better off paying a little more for solid white cause you not only get a full can, but cost-wise it's a better deal.

review/summary: Mid-Grade Quality In Current Market But Very Good Price
review/text: World market prices for all grades and most varieties of tuna have shot up through 2011 into 2012. Obviously operating costs for producers have risen like they have for everybody else compounded by increased demand for higher grades with an overall decreasing global supply. So that's why this product isn't like it used to be. And that's why it's labeled "Product Of Vietnam" where operating costs are low. China and Japan are investing heavily in the Mekong Delta region to support the food supply. And that's why this manufacturer is Chicken Of The Sea International.<br />The Reviewers who are sarcastic won't feel so smart when they can't even afford this and those using it for cat food may have to eat their cats to survive.<br />Every few weeks I can buy whole Yellowfin Ahi for $2.00/lb off a guy in town who runs out of Hilo and a 15lb fish gets us several meals when we prepare it for sashimi or sushi.<br />Otherwise, like for lunch, this Chicken of the Sea is good enough when used for ordinary tuna salad. Yeah, it's mushy and dark, but if you want Albacore it's going to cost you. If it's available and you can afford it.<br />I'm glad I can get this through Amazon Subscribe & Save for about $0.76/can.

It's difficult to drain the water because the top of the can is so flimsy!  It just pushes in, but doesn't push the water out while keeping the tuna in!<br /><br />I don't like that it's such a pain to drain, but overall a good product and a good buy at about twenty-one bucks.

review/text: I hardly ever find cans of tuna below $.50 each anymore so this was a GREAT deal.  I received it today and immediately opened a can.  One thing I noticed was that although it is exactly the same can (and has the same wording on the front) as another can I have at home that was purchased a couple months ago (within the last 5 months or sooner), it has less sodium in it.  It has 180mg and the other had 250mg per serving (same size serving).  It made it a little more bland and watery tasting but better for your health obviously so I was very happy with this.  I would definitely recommend this to anybody that likes to eat tuna on a regular basis :)

review/summary: Let's compare this product against Costco's Chicken of the Sea Chunk Light Tuna in water
review/text: The largest skipjack tuna are given to the sushi bars and poke sellers to be eaten raw as sushi, sashimi, or poke.  That's especially true if the skipjack tuna is caught in U.S., Japanese, or Australian waters.  Costco's Chicken of the Sea Chunk Light Tuna contains some of the largest skipjack tuna that were caught near Thailand.  One can of Costco's Chicken of the Sea Chunk Light Tuna contains 7 ounces of tuna meat compared to only 5 ounces of tuna meat per can in this product, which contains 48 cans per pack.  Costco's product contains 12 cans per pack and usually sells for about $15.99.  The tuna meat in this product is somewhat more flakier (lower in quality) than the tuna meat in Costco's product, which uses the highest quality, solid, shoulder meat area of the skipjack tuna fish.  However, the quality of the tuna meat in this product isn't too bad.  I've seen even flakier (less solid) tuna meat in the cheapest tuna cans sold at some supermarkets.  Both Costco's tuna product and this tuna product come from Thailand but I've noticed that "Product of Thailand" is suddenly no longer printed on this tuna product from Amazon.com.  Interestingly, by weight, only 10% of all tuna fish are caught in the entire Atlantic Ocean plus Mediterranean Sea.  By weight, 22% of all tuna fish are caught in the Indian Ocean and 68% of all tuna fish are caught in the Pacific Ocean.  Shark fishing is illegal in the Atlantic Ocean but legal in the Pacific Ocean.  I wonder if that has anything to do with why tuna fish prefer to inhabit the Pacific Ocean.  By weight, about 60% of all tuna fish caught are skipjack tuna, about 24% are yellowfin tuna, about 10% are bigeye tuna, about 5% are albacore tuna, and the remaining 1% is bluefin tuna according to Wikipedia.

review/text: I'm a big fan of chicken and tuna (and mermaids) so when I saw 48 cans on sale, I had to click Add to Cart. WHAT a MISTAKE. While tuna is nutritious and can easily be turned into various meals (tuna salad, tuna sandwich, tuna in a bowl, tuna as cat food...) you have to be able to REACH the tuna! This tuna is surrounded by a tough, cylindrical barrier. It is smooth, round, and looks and sounds like metal when you throw it against the wall so i'm pretty sure it's some type of new plastic made in China. I would stay away from this unless your cart also contains a can opener made in China.

review/summary: Good source of minerals (and not bad-tasting either)
review/text: I put these in my cart and thought on 'em for quite a long while.  $17 seemed like a lot of money to spend on something I'd never tried before.  Sure, I've had some of the hulled (or white) sesame seeds on buns and such, but I was less certain of this "heartier" unhulled variety.  I mean, what was I going to DO with all those seeds?  Well, my concerns were quickly put aside when my quartet of bagged seeds arrived.  Describing the taste is tricky; the bag says they "have a nutty, slightly sweet flavor and aroma that is enhanced by toasting."  Me thinks Bob's Red Mill didn't know how to describe them either! I detect nothing sweet and notice an almost slightly smoky flavor. And I can say this: they've grown on me.  I eat them straight, in cereal with milk, in homemade granola and added to baked goods.  They're really quite versatile.  I haven't made Tahini yet, but there's a recipe right on the package and one for Hummus and a third for cookies.  Unhulled, i.e., brown sesame seeds have a higher Calcium content (16% RDA in 2 tbsp) than hulled, which is the primary reason I wanted these, but they also are a good source of Iron (13%) and Magnesium.  They keep best refrigerated or frozen - and happily since I'm dealing with 4 pounds of product, the expiration date is two years off. I'm glad I bought these.

I consumed one bag of this then immediately changed to organic years ago.

review/summary: Hardly what I would call species appropriate, but better than kibble
review/text: The maker of this diet claims the following about NRG Maxim Grainless Dog Food Diet on the website:<br />"It is goodness you can actually see, not just when you read the label, but from the moment you open the box and recognize shredded fruits and vegetables like in your own trail mix.Enzyme active fresh fruits and vegetables provide enriched immune system support. Vegetable based carbohydrates combine with dietary fats to supply energy in a balance that does not stress the pancreas. Not only is meat the first ingredient, it is more than 1/2 the formulaFor everyday convenience NRG is the refreshing way to provide enzyme rich whole food nourishment...NO SHORT CUTS...Quality without compromise...<br />The Best Raw Food Value...1 KG of dry measure Maxim is caloricly equal to 10 lbs of frozen food."<br /><br />My notes:<br />Shredded fruits and veggies are simply filler and are not digested by dogs. On the other hand the powdered, raw veggies and fruit that the manufacturer knocks will offer some enzymes, vitamins, minerals, electrolytes, etc. Sadly the shredded produce in this product is simply a great way to waste your money ($15/lb for something that costs the manufacturer $1/lb). I am not against people making money, but I am against deceptive marketing. This product is better than a lot of pet foods, just don't fool yourself into thinking it's better than a home-prepared or commercial, frozen raw diet.<br /><br />As for meat being "more than 1/2 the formula..." I should hope so. Exactly when did it become acceptable to make meat and animal products less than 95% of the diet of a carnivore?<br /><br />As for this product being the best raw food value, I have to laugh. Even if the wet ("frozen") weight equaled 4.5 times the dry weight of the finished product you're still only getting about 50% meat. When I air-dry chicken the weight after drying is approximately 30% of what it was. Based on that, I'm doubtful there is truth to the statement "1 KG of dry measure Maxim is caloricly equal to 10 lbs of frozen food". I could see this was the case if the 10lbs of frozen food was different food.

I have to be ever vigilant about my product choices.<br /><br />All food reactions should be carefully examined, but they should not be immediately or unduly blamed on gluten contamination.  I don't work for nor do I currently receive any form of consideration from this company. This endorsement is strictly so others can make an informed decision!<br /><br />Their number is (888)-810-3212.  I recommend you call since manufacturing practices are subject to change, even though it seemed that this company is committed to providing a safe product for celiacs and others on a GF diet.<br /><br />I asked if I could quote them and got their permission to write:<br /><br />" Nut flours are processed in a separate facility which ONLY processes nut flours.  Therefore, there's NO possibility of cross-contamination during manufacturing from gluten."<br /><br />I am very comfortable using and recommending this product from a Gluten free point of view.  I shall update the review here and on my blog as I use their flours in recipe formulation.<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: great deal, good flavor
review/text: I purchased this flour a few weeks ago and just baked with it the first time yesterday. I was very satisfied with the taste and texture of it. However, I called the company and they could not tell me anything in regards to their mills nor if there could be any cross-contamination. The lady on the phone seemed to think that the mills are shared equipment and that no precautions are taken to avoid cross-contamination. If you're buying it for low-carb prep only, it should be a good flour at a great deal. Please beware if you are using it to avoid gluten or other allergenic grains!<br /><br />Note: PLEASE READ COMMENT BELOW FROM HONEYWELL! They have since modified their manufacturing to eliminate cross-contamination.

review/summary: Absolutely different texture with this than Bob's & other almond flours
review/text: When we initially went gluten free I'd bought an SCD cookbook to help me with recipes. However, everything I made had an odd, gritty type texture and I quickly decided I wasn't a fan of things baked with almond flour. Fast forward 5 years later & I end up with a cookbook that uses almond flour extensively, but the author specifically insists that you must use blanched almond meal flour, and especially recommends this Honeyville brand.<br /><br />I was skeptical, but decided to give it a try, since the author insisted the type of almond flour made a difference. We bought the honeyville, made a few things and were amazed! This flour is really great! We've made a lot of different treats with this flour and everyone - even our gluten eating friends and family - have liked what we've made. It is so great to be able to cook with a more nutritious flour (vs. rice, potato starch, and other nutritionally deficient gluten free options) that also tastes great w/o a gritty texture.<br /><br />One of the cookbooks we like & use a lot is: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/158761345X">The Gluten-Free Almond Flour Cookbook</a><br /><br />If you've not been a fan of almond flour cooking in the past, give it a try with this flour - it really does make a difference!

review/summary: Wonderful Product - Delicious and High Quality
review/text: I love Honeyville Blanched Almond Meal Flour!  Love it! If you haven't tried almond meal, then consider purshasing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/158761345X">The Gluten-Free Almond Flour Cookbook</a>.  That should be sufficient inspiration.  Elana has the best recipes and it was via this book that I discovered almond meal.  Though not a true celiac, I do limit my gluten intake for various reasons.  However, I'm not inclined to purchase or injest many of the flour varieties that are advertised for gluten free cooking.  I like simple and easy and delicious.  Honeyville is a high quality product and the company is excellent with customer service.  Consdering price:  Unless you have a very large family, this flour goes a very long way.  I'm a single person who creates food "presents" for friends.  I keep some of the flour in the fridge, and the rest in the freezer, removing it just prior to use.  I find the cost to be extremely reasonable since it seems to go further than white flour would.  Also, this flour is all protein.  So healthy.  White flour is not all protein.  Not so healthy for many reasons. Try the recipes in Elana's book. Definitely try the Honeyville Blanched Almond Meal Flour.

review/summary: Buy the 5 lb bag, not 25 lb box!
review/text: I LOVE this flour.  It has a great texture and is perfect for my gluten-free and low-carb needs.  I would highly recommend that you buy this flour - but only in the 5 lb size.<br /><br />I love it and use it so much that I thought I'd try to be more economical and buy the 25 lb box direct from Honeyville's site.  I was so excited to start baking that I opened it up the second I got in the door.  I found it was packed in an UNSEALED blue garbage bag inside of a cardboard box, and was completely infested with ants.  YUCK!!!<br /><br />I'm extremely cheap, but having bugs in my baking supplies completely grossed me out.  I don't see how they would keep this from happening again in the future, given the way that they pack the bulk boxes.  On Honeyville's site you can get a smaller discount for buying at least six 5 lb bags, but to me it's worth it to know that I'm getting a safe food product.

review/text: My wife and I are paleo. we use a lot of almond flour. Other brands is not not dry enough, maybe they are not blanched completely/correctly. Baking paleo leaves me with few options, but if you substitute most recipes with almond flour instead of wheat flour, you will get a much more moist and far healthier outcome. high in protein and good fat!

Works great in all types of recipes, so my family easily goes through a 5 lb. bag. However, despite my devotion to Amazon, I have started ordering the Honeyville blanched almond flour directly from Honeyville since the price is better, even with shipping charges. The product is even cheaper with promotions they regularly offer.

Honeyville flour seems to be more finely ground. Buying a 5-pound bag from Amazon.com is also cheaper than buying 1-pound bags in a local store.

I believe either another user or product review suggest you allow time for thawing prior to use, which is great advice. I like the consistency and flavor of this and use it when constructing 'heavier' breads such as banana breads, or even pie dough.

review/text: Its near impossible to find almond flour locally. Trader Joes has Almond Meal, which I supposed you could put in a food processor. But this is still much cheaper.<br /><br />There are little dark specs in the flour. At least in my bag, they are NOT ants. Others have said they saw ants in their bags. The dark spots are little pieces of the almond skin. They are ant sized, and dark, and you're not used to seeing anything dark in "flour".<br /><br />So happy to find this on Amazon, and on PRIME too!!! : )<br /><br />Edit: "The "ziplock" part of this bag sucks! I have the whole bag in a OXO pop-top "air-tight" container."

review/summary: EXCELLENT product
review/text: Having recently (within the last year) enacted a grain free diet (paleo, specificially, upon the leading of my doctor), I have begun the process of finding new foods for our household. This item was suggested by elanaspantry.com, which has been my #1 source for incredible recipes; her books are absolutely fabulous. Prior to finding this almond flour (I've tried others but have found none other that compares), I was not cooking much! The texture and taste of this product are truly incredible! I am having a ball trying new recipes, which is entirely new for me. I would use this DAILY if it was not so expensive--but it can last a long time. Cannot even begin to say how much healthier I feel off grains. I'd thought most of the "gluten free" rave was fad dieting, but I am grateful to be experiencing a healthier and more energetic lifestyle these days. If you're looking for a wonderful almond flour, this is THE ONE. Also try Elana Amsterdam's cookbooks. You will not be disappointed!!!

review/text: In the past, when Almond Flour was called for in a recipe, I would purchase almonds, place them in a pot with water and let them come to a slow boil...then I would have to drain them and remove each peel/shell. Then the next step would be to dry them overnight. The following day, I would place them in a food processor and grind them, as fine as possible. With the Almond Flour all those steps are unnecessary. I highly recommend Almond Flour for any recipe(s) calling for it.

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: This review won't do Honeyville's almond flour justice. You really must try it, it's amazing. I've made cupcakes, cookies, breads, savory muffins, sweet muffins, biscuits... the list goes on. Everything turned out delicious and all of that is attributed to this flour. The price feels a little steep per pound (especially when I first buy it); however, considering that whole almonds are usually around $4/lb around here, it's not all that terrible. I could try making almond flour myself, but it wouldn't be half as good as this. Thanks Honeyville!

review/summary: Great for GF and Low Carb Baking
review/text: I was surprised to find that this really is ground finer and produces better results for me when making Paleo Bread and a number of other baked goods where almond flour is one of the main ingredients, when compared to Bob's, which is a little coarser, more of a meal consistency (not that that's necessarily a bad thing, and can produce better results for some uses, such as for some crusts or coating chicken or fish). Honeyville has more of a flour consistency than any brand I've tried.  Wish it was available in smaller quantities for the amount of baking I do, but I just separate it into smaller amounts, put them in the kind of zip-top bags that I can pump the air out of with my trusty manual pump, and freeze to prevent rancidity.

review/text: I use a variety of gluten free flours. I had read about how great this flour is for baking, especially for it's light texture and no carbs. However, it seems a bit dense and clumpy to me. I've never used any other almond flours so I've nothing to compare it to except almond meal and it does remind me of a less dense almond meal. Just not quite what I expected. I'll use it in some more baking recipes before a final decision.

review/summary: Poor Quality Control! Ants in Ripped Flour Bag
review/text: I was excited when I ordered this yesterday and it was to be delivered today. I had almost everything I needed for the next phase in my diet, but the almond meal flour. After reading reviews and the ingredients I went ahead and ordered. I came home for the delivery only to find that ants were all in the box it was shipped in. Needless to say I was even more disgusted when I discovered the seam on the side of the bag was open and had not been sealed correctly and that the ants were all in the bag crawling around! The box was not left outside so no, it was not sitting waiting on me to get it. I immediately got online and had to initiate a return. If you do decide to order from this company, open the box outside and check the bag for bugs. I will not be ordering from them again. I will try to post an image later to show what I meant about the ants. I had to take the bag and put it in large ziplock gallon bags (two facing each other) and put it into the freezer until I can put it back in the box, seal it, and return to sender. I order a lot off amazon and this is the first thing I have ever had come to me with this problem. The ants may have come from an Amazon warehouse, or FedEx, but the poor quality control on the bag was from the manufacturer.<br /><br />Update: I contacted amazon through the chat and informed them about my concern about sending a bag with insects back to them. I also shared I had posted images on this product page. They said I could discard it and they would process my refund. I do say that I am and have always been happy with the fact Amazon backs up the products they ship and aim for good customer service. I am not going to increase the rating because the ants wouldn't have gotten in the bag or probably been there if it wasn't torn and sealed properly at the manufacturer level.

review/summary: Not as happy as I wanted to be
review/text: For our inaugural attempt at baking with almond meal, we used our old standby scone recipe, which results in 8 delicious but massively carby scones, light and fluffy.<br /><br />Substituting almond meal 1:1 (which was a total guess because there were no instructions on the bag about how to substitute) for the flour, we ended up with a very runny-ish dough.  I know it won't get as dough-like as wheat flour, but this was almost like cooked oatmeal, it was so runny.  So we ended up doubling the amount of flour, therefore, 2:1 ratio to regular flour, and the scones came out (a) crumbly and (b) salty.  I did add the regular amount of sugar to my recipe but it was apparently not enough to counteract the saltiness of the almonds.  Each of us choked down one scone with a lot of milk, and five more were tossed in the back yard for the birds.<br /><br />We will next attempt to make oatmeal-raisin cookies with it, and if that's as bad a fail, then we will not even bother with this product again.

review/summary: Black Cat? Try Stale Reddish Brown Cat! Never again!
review/text: I am so disappointed with this coffee that I'll be requesting a refund after I type this review. I bought into the hype of Intelligentsia coffee and had to try it. Hip packaging with an even hipper name - Black Cat. Loved the fact that it was organic too. Even bought a great burr mill grinder. I was ready for some deliciously dark, rich espresso! As soon as I opened the bag and smelled the beans, my heart sunk. No espresso aroma here - not even dark or french roast. I would compare it to the same smell as Dunkin Donuts coffee - fine if that's what you're expecting and you've paid half of what I spent on this Black Cat. The beans were dried out without any of that lovely oiliness and they certainly weren't black or dark color but reddish brown - the color of a hazlenut to be exact. I hoped the ground beans would magically transform into expresso while brewing. Hah! Not a chance. Instead of espresso, I settled for an over-rated, expensive cup of common tasting coffee and never bothered to grind any more of those beans. If you expect oily, black beans and love rich, dark coffee - try Kicking Horse - available from Amazon. It's the best coffee I've ever tasted. It won't disappoint!

review/text: Our son likes this meal, but it is definitely something that needs to be warmed.  When it is cool or at room temperature the consistency is a little unappealing.

review/summary: Even better when iced
review/text: This is a nice, soothing tea when it's hot, but it's even better when brewed over a large plastic cup filled with ice.  Add some sugar, and you've got a minty refreshing drink that really hits the spot on hot days.  I'm definitely getting the 50 count next time around.

review/summary: One of my favorite teas in K-cups...
review/text: For some reason, this tea can be hard to come by.  It was out of stock on the usual site I order from so I began to search other options.  I was completely out of it at home, so I wanted to get an order placed as soon as possible and not pay too much.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the large boxes availabole and at a great price!  Would definitely buy again.

review/summary: Perfect after-dinner treat!
review/text: This has quickly become one of my favorite teas. Pure peppermint fragrance and taste, without any hint of bitterness or other jarring note. I sometimes like a bit of a sweet something-or-other after dinner, and this tea, sweetened a little, hits the spot perfectly. Haven't tried it iced yet, but I'm sure it's tasty that way, too.
