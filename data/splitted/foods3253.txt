review/summary: Comfort Food
review/text: Unlike a lot of 'alfredo box mixes' the sauce is not watery or grainy. And tasting the spices included was a little difficult. So you might want to just add your own preference to have it avoid being bland. But it is delicious. The package says you use chicken, but you could also dice up seafood.<br /><br />You're not going to eat this product every day. It is loaded with calories. And it's hard to call it 'quick'. But for an actual once in a while treat, it is good.

review/summary: GOOD
review/text: Good product. Good for emergency rations. Good for last minute snacks or lunches. All white meat. No skin and no fat and no bones. Comes with a package of mayonaisse and sweet relish and wooden spoon and crackers and plastic mixing cup. The chicken is in a little can with a pull tab. Had several months shelf life left when I received them.<br />At $2.00 to $2.50 max per kit it's a good deal. 12 kits come in box. I don't think it would have been a good deal if it was more than $30 with free s/h. It all depends on what convenience is worth to you though. Like I said- it had a several month shelf life and it's really convenient- all you need is a napkin. I would buy again if the 12 kits were $25 or less.

review/summary: Just ate it, and was better than I thought it was going to be
review/text: Missleading ad: Can of chicken is 3.25 oz and the whole kit is 4.57 oz. The only problem is the water-chicken juice you must drain off, but they give a two part plastic container for that. One part for mixing the ingredients, and the other for draining the water. Great for camping and back packing foods ideas (except for all of the packaging you have left over). Also, just go down to Wal-Mart and buy these.<br /><br />Kit includes:<br />3.25 oz of premium white chicken chunks<br />1 packet of wafer crackers (maybe 6-8 each)<br />1 packet of Hidden Valley Mayo<br />1 packet of Heinz sweet relish<br />1 little wooden mixing and eating paddle stick.<br />1 2-part plastic cup and lid<br /><br />Taste: 8 out of 10; damn good

review/text: better than i thot it would be -- just like some others.  i've only had canned chicken just a few times in my life and never liked it.  just be sure and drain as much water off as u can. at only 240 calories this is another plus.  i even had the taste of actual chicken.  i also liked the warehouse price of about 1.50 each. since the expiration date is a little less at warehouse prices, this item still gives me 2 1/2 months; reasonable. so i am pleased i have an economical light meal. it is a lil salty, but after the first bite, i didn't notice it any more. good to have in the pantry if ur diabetic and need something quick.  better than eating ice cream - lol. i even liked the wooden spoon since i think a plastic one would break anyway.

review/summary: A little runny and needs more flavor
review/text: I thought the Tyson brand would taste better than it does. I tried to drain as much of the liquid as I could but the mix was still soggy. I added the mayonnaise and relish plus some spicy mustard. It's okay when there are no other options. Sometime I travel on cargo aircraft and there is no galley to even get hot water for packaged soup. I can carry a kit whereever I go and I don't have to worry about refrigeration. The crackers are whole grain and taste good. Next time I'll try adding some chicken spices or Louisiana style hot sauce, not tabasco sauce, to see if it perks up. The little plastic container is nice and reusable. Find a set of small spoons or knives to mix instead of the spatula enclosed in the kit, useless.

review/summary: little dated shelf life remaining
review/text: The product is very tasty and convenient when I tried one.  It arrived promptly.  The problem is that what I received (and even got a replacement order hoping to fix the problem) had a "best by" date of only about 2 1/2 more months.  If you buy this at the grocery (yes it costs more there) typically you have a "best by" date of 12-18 months.  If you are going to use the product promptly, then the short shelf life date is no problem.  But if you are buying it for emergency purposes (meaning you plan on storing it for awhile), it is not appropriate.  I really like shopping at Amazon, but for the "suggestion box" if a product has a fairly short remaining shelf life, that should be part of the product description.

review/summary: Four Out Of Six Of My Cats Love It!
review/text: I have six cats and am very picky about what I feed my cats. It doesn't help that I have to give one cat herbal supplements and another extra food since he gets run off from the food dish. It can be very challenging to say the least when the other three are just trying to snarf down everything they can get.<br /><br />I am adamant about a grain free diet but also have to find something that everyone will eat. This is hard because not everyone wants to eat the same thing. My oldest cat doesn't even like canned food. If he gets special treats, its sardines only so he was out when I tried this food. The other boy doesn't like the ground up texture of many canned foods. He only eats stuff that has really pieces of food and gravy. He turned his nose up and walked away. The other four all ran to the plate and cleaned it off every time I put it down. Four out of six cats ate it.<br /><br />The sad thing I find with this food is it talks about all the healthy veggies and fruits in it but from looking at it, the only vegetable I see are carrots. What does encourage me is a cat blog I follow, The Conscious Cat, recommends this as one of her top grain free foods to feed your cat. She is also very picky about what she feeds her cats, and I trust her word.<br /><br />Now, having said all of that, I feel that this is one of the better canned cat foods on the market. Personally, I wouldn't really buy much of it since I don't feed the four cats this that often, just often enough to distract them while I am trying to feed the one that got run off from the food dish. If you buy this, expect to pay a little less than forty dollars for 24 3-ounce cans (as of 10/4/12). That's a little steep for me, but I do feel that the food is worth it for your cats if you plan on feeding them a wet diet.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />100% Cat Lover<br />Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.

review/summary: Nutritious and Wholesome Cat Food for a Picky Older Cat
review/text: I have been at my wit's end trying to find a good cat food for my 15 year old cat, Lily. She is finicky and even worse, has a delicate stomach condition. Not only do we get the usual hairballs, but I've had to clean up after her about three times a day.<br /><br />As a result, we're very careful in how we feed her. In terms of dry food, we've given her IAMS and Science Diet. After a brief honeymoon period, she wouldn't touch the stuff (Science was very expensive, so I learned my lesson there, pricey doesn't mean Lily will like it). In terms of wet foods, she likes Fancy Feast Classic but never manages to finish a can. There's always leftover meat in her bowl.<br /><br />Then I gave her Nature's Variety. The first time I served it, she lapped it up. In fact, she licked her bowl clean, not a speck of food left! I was also surprised to see tiny bits of an orange-colored vegetable in her food (carrot?). Since I'm a bit of a vegetarian myself, I highly approve of the 5% veggies that come in this type of canned food. I'm also glad that this grain-free food is a pate, which makes it perfect for older cats like Lily.<br /><br />She's been eating this non-stop for about two weeks now (still licking the bowl clean!) and so far so good(fingers crossed). Fancy Feast seemed to be the only type of food she liked, so I'm happy to be able to add this to the list.

review/summary: Healthier for my kitty, she's not terribly fond of it, but is adjusting (I think?)
review/text: The ingredients are much healthier, IMHO, than most cat foods with filler grains, etc. It does have flaxseed oil, which is great for her coat (has linoleic acid in it) & the chicken should be a good source of arachidonic acid *both are reportedly necessary for cats, as they can't manufacture these themselves.) It's nice to see cat foods that are meat a cat would normally eat in the wild along with oils that help their coats shine & are good for their kidneys. I'm not sure what the ratios are, and these can be very important if you have an older cat with renal issues, hypertension, arthritis, and so on, so I'd dig deeper &/or talk you your vet if your kitty has any health issues.<br /><br />I think for cats, health-wise, it *seems* the duck is the healthiest in this brand to balance the EFAs for kitties (I'm NOT a vet & every car is different, so if in doubt, check with your vet. My cat will snag ice cream & even cotton candy if you let her, so taste prolly isn't the vest indicator... Also, if you cat is used to eating a food that isn't as healthy for them, once they get the junk out of their taste buds for a few weeks to a month, they tend to eat the healthier foods & will stop craving the junk... people are much the same way, so once the kitties or kiddy's are off the junk, then they'll tend to eat what is healthier for them!)<br /><br />The food has no coloring or artificial preservatives, so it might just be better for you than canned food for humans (Interesting that there is a Bill on the ballot in CA, perhaps nationally under different state laws? I dunno, I haven't received my booklet yet re: bills/initiatives & different states are likely to have different proposals, so READ CAREFULLY!<br />It appears as though the food companies more likely to have "Genetically Engineered foods", & more "junk foods" are against it) that reportedly would require dog & cat foods to be labeled for coloring, genetic alteration, preservatives, etc., but a commercial sponsored by some food companies SAYS not on human foods??? Well... maybe we should vote yes on the bill to at least get some labeling laws started [IF it doesn't prohibit making human foods labeled in a later initiative, then just buy pet foods that are healthy enough for humans?) It sounds like some pet foods are already healthier for humans as it is now, so truth in labeling should be the #1 priority for ANY foods ANY of us AND our pets eat, especially with a lot of "syndromes", etc. popping up in the last 20-30 years & the probability that some genetically altered foods *MAY* make our pets, and thus us more susceptible to infections with parasites, viral infections, fungal infections and bacterial infections such as: protozoa, worms, malaria, West Nile virus & other diseases that are more difficult to detect in our pets AND in us!<br /><br />Some pet & human foods already label these things, so for those opposed to labeling truthfully, you have to wonder WHY they would NOT want us to know what we are feeding our animals OR us, as our pet's health can directly affect OUR health!<br /><br />I'm all for a boycott of ANY food company (pet or otherwise) that wants to keep what's in our pets, wildlife foods or our foods from us! That one susceptibility factor to a single one of millions of different infections could mean encephalitis, worms or maggots eating your liver, eye, intestines and most likely our skin, yet it only take one susceptibility to be passed from our pets to us to kill or harm our pets & jump the species barrier, survive cooking, used in cotton plants to make them (& any other plants that happen to get in the mix, cross-bread, etc. non-susceptible to even Round-up, so once the cat's out of the bag, if these cross species, or if these plants support, or take out ANY section of natural resistance to pathogens ("prion-free" may look great on one level, yet may support pathogens in other ways), then we'll have a massive crisis on our hands that could make pandemics of the past look like a single funeral... The fact is we don't know for sure & it's incredibly clear that not enough research has been done

review/summary: Kitties Are Finicky
review/text: Anyone owned by cats knows that they can be very finicky and might turn up their little noses at the best food while happily scarfing down food filled with nasty-sounding things like poultry digest.<br /><br />My two cats eat a popular, grocery-store-variety, canned cat food in the morning and have dry available to them the rest of the time. One of them will pretty much eat anything that doesn't move and probably would eat the stuff that does move if he were an outside kitty.  The other is old and scrawny and hard to feed.<br /><br />On the first morning, the kitties looked at this food a bit suspiciously and then started nibbling which turned into chowing down.  After that first try, they both ate it enthusiastically.  Fat kitty even makes "nom, nom, nom" noises while he is eating.<br /><br />I really like the ingredients in this food.  However, I was concerned about the inclusion of montmorillonite clay.  Do I really want to be feeding my kitties clay?  So I researched this edible clay a bit.  It is full of minerals that are good for kitties but is also used for very non-food purposes.  I'm no scientist, but after reading the information I could find, I've decided that I won't be alarmed by that ingredient in the food.  Because very high quality ingredients are higher on the list, I believe that the manufacturer includes it as a true benefit, not as a filler.  You'll have to make your own decision about that.<br /><br />And your kitties will make the decision about whether they will eat it or not.<br /><br />This stuff is definitely pricier per ounce than the bigger, mega-brand cans of food, but I think that the excellent ingredients justifies the difference.<br /><br />`

review/text: I like that this is a better product for my pets but really for the price of it I couldn't afford to buy this all the time. My cat isn't very picky usually and she ate this, we usually buy her the friskies prime filets, the vet said it is better to not change their diet and buy different types of food and flavors all the time so we normally stick with the chicken. I am glad this is a chicken formula since that is what she is used to. If it weren't so expensive I would buy it all the time but I do have to budget. I take good care of my animals but I have to watch the cost so that the humans can eat and pay bills. I am trying to get a baby kitten to start on solid foods and I am trying with this since it is quality and it is easier for him to try and eat than the filets.<br />It is a good quality cat food but it loses one star for being more than I can afford to buy on a constant basis and the cans are very small so it would take more cans to feed a cat.

review/summary: Good Food, Not Junk Food
review/text: Our six cats vary in age from nine months to 17 years and finding food that suits all of them can be difficult.  Like most cats, they all like junk food -- grocery store canned food made of by-products and grains -- but not all of them can handle it, and frankly, we prefer they only eat junk food occasionally; just like us, they're healthier with a better diet. Over the last couple of years, we've switched our brood to 75% freshly cooked chicken/25% canned (grocery store) food. Along with that, they eat a premium kibble that provides nutrients  (Kirkland Premium, Costco's cat chow, which is priced similarly to grocery store brands even though it's the equivalent of brands like Felidae.)<br /><br />Nature's Variety Instinct Grain-Free chicken formula is excellent food, complete and balanced, and I wouldn't hesitate to replace the chicken breasts we prepare with this product.  The cats even react similarly to it: if they've recently had cheap canned food -- junk food -- two aren't as interested in it because it's not pumped full of lord-knows-what to enhance the flavor. Still, they eat it, but the other four, who prefer fresh chicken to junk food, practically inhale it.<br /><br />There are no digestive upsets with Instinct, and nothing in the litter pan that indicates intestinal trouble. That's never the case with the grocery store brands, even the priciest ones.  If I had only one cat, I would happily stop cooking up chicken breasts and rely on this food and the kibble, but the cost is a little steep.  (I'd love to see this food packed in the larger-sized short can at a better price per ounce.) As it is, I'm keeping a few cans around for treats, and when the budget is a little roomier, I plan on buying it by the case and cooking a lot less chicken.<br /><br />I'm really glad this food exists; I actually feel good about feeding it to our little pride of house lions.

review/summary: Miss Flufferpants loves it
review/text: October 23, 2012<br /><br />****<br /><br />This is quite possibly the single most perfectly delicious cat food Miss Flufferpants has ever tried.  She eats almost exclusively the dry kind of food, with the occasional ort "accidentally" dropped on the floor thrown in.  I've never seen her go so totally nuts over a cat food.  She almost literally inhales the entire three ounces in a frenzy of happitude that I swear make her virtually purr.  Miss Flufferpants has never been exactly what you would call a picky eater -- rotting squirrel and rabbit are not unknown to her palate -- so I'm not impressed that she ate Nature's Variety Instinct Grain-Free Canned Cat Food, Chicken Formula, 3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24) at all, I'm impressed with the degree of vigor and seeming delight with which she ate it.<br /><br />The stuff is expensive, which is why I subtract a star, especially if you regard it as your pet's daily meals.  I use it only as a treat.<br /><br />That there are no grains according to the labels is surely precisely why it is so expensive per ounce.  Grains are cheap ingredients that bulk up volume and weight.  Turning grains into meat is expensive, which is why more experts nowadays are recommending eating more grains in the form of grains and less in the less healthful form of chickens and cows and pigs.<br /><br />Did I forget to mention that Miss Flufferpants is my 70-pound dog?  She is.  However, my cat, Bently Geene, likes the stuff too, just not as enthusiastically.<br /><br />****

review/summary: Nature's Variety Chicken Canned Cat Food
review/text: My cats are primarily on dry food.  But I like to give them a treat once in awhile; just something different from the same old same old that they get everyday.  So once a week they get what I affectionately call their "kitty crack".  That is, a can of cat food split between the two of them.<br /><br />And it never fails, doesn't matter what brand or what flavor, they go wild for it.  This canned cat food was no different.  They both got excited as soon as they heard the lid open and the chorus of meows started.  The can was small, but I still split it between the two of them as they have dry food always accessible if they are still hungry.  They gobbled it down at a fairly rapid pace, even on the third week in a row of it.<br /><br />It didn't smell very good, I will say that.  Not that most wet foods do, but still, this one isn't pleasant and definitely doesn't smell like chicken to me.  But as long as they like it that's alright.  The ingredients are quite good.  It is grain free like advertised and made with real meat and veggies.  They have some vitamins thrown in too, but not enough that you can't tell what the heck is in the food.  And the list isn't overly long, which I appreciate as well.  It also seems very digestible.  My cats have sensitive stomachs and its taken a long time to find things they won't react with.  This food seems to be one of those things they can eat without leaving a present on the floor for me later or hearing that dreaded retching sound in the middle of the night.<br /><br />A good canned cat food.  I would buy it for the girls in the future.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/summary: Picky cat liked the first time but then will not want to eat it now
review/text: Everyone's cat has its own finickiness. Our female cat, Sammy, is the pickiest eater. She has to have a rotation of different wet foods or else she just stands there and demands more... Anyway, she loved this item the first time that she ate it. However, on the second time, she was not really interested and remains uninterested. Not sure why. I am sure that the ingredients and nutrients are better, but she won't touch this food. It is a good quality product and my dogs like the similar type of food from Nature's Variety.

review/text: This was not a product I was going to review by personal experience. I mean, it may be nutritional and all, but cat food is designed to entice feline, not human, desires.<br /><br />That being said, I started giving this as a treat to my cats in the evening. It is an understatement to say they love it! They devoured it. It is a good ten minute period of time when they are engaged in eating this food.<br /><br />The flavor my cats tried was chicken. They were not chicken about enjoying the cat food and it did not put them in a fowl mood.<br /><br />I would definitely buy this again. My cats enjoyed every morsel!

review/text: One cat likes it, one cat doesn't.  In fairness, the one that doesn't like it is not a big fan of canned food in general and, well, we all know about cats and finickiness.<br /><br />The ingredients here are excellent, and if you couldn't read the label, your nose would tell you:  Instead of a cat-food stench, it smells like you popped the top on a can of chicken.<br /><br />While it is significantly more expensive than many brands, compare ingredients.  Cats are obligate carnivores who must have meat, and meat is more expensive than soy, grain, starches, and nebulous by-products.  Additionally, I checked the label of a well-known brand-name canned cat food and found titanium dioxide, which is essentially a white pigment (and currently classified as "possibly carcinogenic," i.e., cancer-causing) and caramel color.  Who's that for?  Pretty sure my cat doesn't care what color the food is.<br /><br />I would consider this a very high-quality food and a good choice.  The missing star represents the vote of the picky cat who won't eat it.

review/summary: High Quality, Cats Love It
review/text: My two cats loved this food and ate it readily (mixed with their "Before Grains" dry food). For two cats, I gave about 1/3 - 1/2 can daily, and they eat the Nature's Variety Instinct canned food first - and with gusto!<br /><br /> It also doesn't stink to high-heaven, which is reassuring.<br /><br />There aren't any fillers or grains and - since cats are obligate carnivores - is exactly how it should be. There's some vitamin fortification, but that isn't superfluous or unnecessary. Very high quality ingredients, without too much fat or vegetables. It's expensive food, for sure, but it's an investment in my cats' health: high quality diet means less propensity towards digestive problems or later-life health issues resultant from long-term grain/filler diets.

review/summary: Great nutritious product
review/text: I recently received this for my friend, who has two cats. I thought that they would be able to enjoy something a little different; however, I didn't realize that my friend was so strict and regimented with her pets' food and didn't want them to eat something new. So with 24 cans of cat food, and no cats to feed it to, I donated it to the local animal rescue rather than let it go to waste. I know someone who works there, and it just happened that the day I brought the food in two stray cats had been brought into the shelter. Both cats were fed Nature's Variety, and both loved it. So far I haven't heard of any complaints regarding other cats rejecting the food, and from what I understand it's quite a healthy product for them as well.

review/summary: 2 Kitties Approved
review/text: Now that the old cat isn't around anymore the younger two only get wet food on special occasions like holidays or birthdays. I put a can of this out and even the reclusive one made an appearance from under the bed. There is generally a pecking order to who gets to eat first but this time both of them stuck their gobs deep into the food and had at. They did seem to fill up fast and left about a quarter of the bowl still there which I thought was odd because they usually lick the bowl clean. Maybe all the good for them ingrediants filled their tummys up faster than some of the other brands? I should note that my cats are on the smaller size at seven pounds and just shy of six pounds.

review/summary: Fantastic cat food - my picky cat loves it!
review/text: I know there are arguments for and against but I feel dry food is a "space age" relic that was good for pet food companies, but not necessarily for pets.  Cats in particular require foods with a high moisture content that dry food lacks.  That doesn't leave canned pet food marketers in the clear either as your definition of acceptable ingredients probably does not include many of the ingredients the FDA and AAFCO considers safe.  (Google the list, it'll be worth it.)<br /><br />My cat normally gets a variety of Wellness and Blue Buffalo Wilderness canned foods.  These are generally considered premium foods but I'm always on the lookout for other ways to add variety to her diet.  What I like most about this food is they clearly state the food contains 95% meat.  That is a huge plus that no other pet food I am aware of matches.  I realize other pet foods will list a meat as the first ingredient, but if the second, third, and fourth ingredients are starches, grains, or vegetables you could end up with food that is less than 50% meat even if it's the first ingredient on the list.  Humans are omnivores, dogs are to some extent, but cats must have meat and bones to survive.<br /><br />So many advertised cat food brands contain mostly unhealthy high-carbohydrate ingredients like corn, wheat and so on as primary ingredients that it makes me mad.  You don't see your housecat in the garden pouncing on a wild ear of corn or a potato, do you?  These items should have never made their way into cat foods in the first place.  That is why I am very happy to see a pet food that actually lists a high percentage of meat content on the label.  As you can expect, it tends to be more expensive, almost twice as much as cheap brands.  Consider this, however.  When I opened my eyes to what I was really feeding my pet and switched, my cat ate half as much as the brand-name junk.  It seems once you start feeding your pet real digestible food, they don't need to eat as much of it.<br /><br />Of course the real critic of this food is my cat.  I am happy to report that not only does she like this food but my normally quiet and reserved cat will meow her desire if she catches a whiff of what's inside the can.  Since she rarely meows for anything, that's quite a compliment.  I will be purchasing more of this in the future.

review/text: All three of my cats enjoy this healthy cat food.  Obviously the flavor is good.<br /><br />It's great to see companies producing grain free cat food (what moron thought it was a good idea to poison cats with grains in the first place?).<br /><br />"Nature Variety Instinct Chicken Formula" claims to be 95% chicken, turkey and liver. There is no mention of "meat by-products".  The ingredients also include small amounts of eggs, peas, carrots, artichokes, cranberries, pumpkin, tomato, blueberries, broccoli, cabbage, kale and parsley.  I think my cats eat healthier than my son does!

review/text: As cat food goes, this is an excellent product. It is good for your cat and your cat will love it.<br /><br />The one problem is value. You get 24 3oz cans for over twice what you can get 24 5.5oz cans of other brands. If you have just one cat, it might be worth it, especially for the quality ingredients, but if you are feeding the entire neighborhood as it seems for me sometimes (they know I can't say no to a hungry kitty), you would be better off with 9Lives or Fancy Feast.

review/summary: All natural high quality ingredients...
review/text: My two cats really enjoy this food and are doing well on it. They're as healthy as can be and changing to this food didn't bother their stomachs. The ingredients are all excellent, it's made in the USA and I feel good about feeding it to them. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because they seem hungrier between meals than with the other premium grain-free wet food they were eating. I'm not sure why because the ingredients are so good, but that's the only negative comment I have. It might just be them adjusting to a new food. The 3 oz. cans are convenient because I find the 6 oz. cans tend to dry out a little before the cats go through them.<br /><br />A quick tip: If your cat doesn't like this food and is used to eating grocery store foods, wait until the cat is really hungry and then try feeding. It takes some time and patience. My cats snubbed their noses at any high-quality foods until they were almost 2 years old. They preferred the taste of the grocery store foods they were eating. Once they got used to the foods with high quality, natural, ingredients, they started to enjoy them.

review/text: I have to say my cat just loved this food.  She practically finished it all in one bite.  Not like she is starving or anything.  She even ignored her treats just to eat this stuff.  I thought maybe it was because it was new but she continues to gobble up each can the same way as the first one. I am very happy as she is finicky.

review/summary: All 5 of my cats seem to really love it!
review/text: These cans are each the same size can as a can of Fancy Feast. So one I split up several times a day for my 5 indoor house cats. Two of my male cats usually only eat canned cat food once in awhile, they usually stick close to dry food. Though, both of them have been eating this food everytime that I've fed it. The other 3 cats are females who are not too picky, though, there are a few foods they won't touch.<br /><br />The food itself has several impressive ingredients and it has a nice broth in every can. What I have also noticed is that this food doesn't have that "fishy" smell or that "sandy/gritty like" texture like so many of the other canned cat foods that are on the market. All the cats have cleaned up all of it each time I've fed it, and it doesn't often happen with all 5 of my cats.<br /><br />Usually, I feed my cats Friskies pates, Whiskas, Fancy Feast pates and 9 Lives pates. My cat's won't usually eat any shredded canned foods, they like the ground/pate styles.<br /><br />Recently, one of my female cats, Sissy developed an allergy to one of her previously enjoyed foods and her front bottom lip swelled up (sometimes called a rodent ulcer) and I think this might be a good alternative for her as she hasn't had a reaction to this food. This food is more expensive than some, but, it's not as expensive as the Science Diet Prescription or the Royal Canin prescription diets for hypo-allergenic (though this food doesn't claim to be hypo-allergenic).<br /><br />Also, my 20lb., very picky Phatboy Cuddlecuss cat will only eat certain wet foods and he absolutely loves this, usually he will only eat Whiskas chicken, but he loves this one.<br /><br />Overall, I'd definitely purchase this canned food for my cats. They really seem to love it so far.

review/summary: Almost "whisker lickin good"
review/text: Of four of my cats only two eat canned food regularly and one nibbles canned food when the mood strikes him.  My fourth cat never touches any canned food.  Therfore, the two that eat the canned food regularly liked this.  They immediately ate some and although they did not finish all the food, I can tell they liked it enough to eat it regularly. (PS It is not too unusual for me to find canned food left behind no matter what the variety.) Right now they've had it a couple of nights in a row. The one that periodically nibbles canned food did not touch it.<br /><br />What I like about this food is that it does not stink. Many canned foods smell up a house the minute they are opened, such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043P12S2">Meow Mix, Surf 'N Turf Variety Pack, 2.75-Ounce Cups (Pack of 48)</a>. This one's smell is barely detectable to me.<br /><br />The label also indicates this food meets the cats nutritional needs.<br /><br />The first five ingredients are Chicken, Turkey, Chicken Broth, Chicken Liver, Ground Flaxseeds, etc. The peas, which are the 8th ingredient in the list, are noticeable but the last 8 ingredients in the mixture (artichokes, cranberries, pumpkin, tomato, blueberries, broccoli, cabbage, kale, parsley) were not visible. Perhaps they were blended in. There are also various vitamins and supplements in the mixture as well as the necessary taurine.<br /><br />Overall, my regular canned-food-eating cats liked this and I believe the ingredients are healthy enough for them.  I would consider purchasing this or another flavor for them if I wanted to introduce some diversity in their diet besides their usual <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OCXRRW">Friskies Savory Shreds Cat Food Variety Pack, 8.25-Pound</a> or other Friskies canned food they are use to.

review/summary: Pricey but Worth It!!
review/text: When I open a can of Fr****ies or F**cy F**st cat food the smell is overwhelming -- I KNOW what kinds of ingredients go into that kind of canned cat food (best left unsaid), and I also know that my co-worker's cat ate nothing but Fancy Feast canned for 21 years. Even so, I am happier feeding my cats something that comes closer to what they would eat in the wild -- almost all protein, no fillers like Soy or Wheat or Corn.<br /><br />The major ingredients in Instinct Grain Free Chicken Formula are: Chicken, Turkey, Chicken Broth, Chicken Liver, Ground Flaxseed, Montmorillonite Clay, Eggs, Peas, Carrots, Lecithin, Vitamins (and fruits) -- REAL meat is first, then broth, then liver  -- good solid nutrition for Obligate carnivores -- which is what cats are.<br /><br />I also like what is stated on the Instinct Cat Food website - "Instinct foods are grain-free and gluten-free - perfect for satisfying your cat's carnivorous cravings and nutritional needs. Instinct is also highly digestible and nutritionally dense"<br /><br />One of my cats (17 yrs old, but still thinks she is a kitten) has a very sensitive stomach -- but there is nothing in this formula, not even the flaxseed and the montomorillonite clay --to upset her stomach -- the other cat (14) has thyroid and heart issues -- after eating this food, her fur is shining and she moves like a frisky kitten. I would prefer not to feed my cats something that I know has dead bodies of downers or chicken feet or beaks/feathers. I feel more comfortable spending a little more and feeding them something that is purer, cleaner and healthier for them -- Instinct is one such food. Instinct also markets raw and freeze-dried foods as well. I feel that Instinct has a committment to making the best possible nutrition available to cat owners.<br /><br />Tha being said. both of my cats have no problem enjoying their Instinct cat food meals. At first I mixed the Instinct half and half with what they had been formerly eating (it was good food, the best I could afford, but still with rice as a filler) -- in order to make the transition easier on their stomachs. Now they dig into their Instinct and lick their plates clean (and ask for more).<br /><br />I plan to continue giving them Instinct Cat Food. Budget permitting, I may even try the freeze dried nuggets as a treat for them. I deserve the best nutrition-- certainly my cats should not be short-changed in that regard either.

review/summary: Cat did not care for this.
review/text: For over $28 (plus shipping) for 24 cans, you would think this cat food would be something special. Alas, upon opening the can and peering inside, it looked just like any other cat food. Smelled like it too. I plopped it into my cat's bowl and she ate it, a little. I had a feeling she wouldn't care for this. She loves Fancy Feast, and only then the grilled variety kind. She doesn't care for the standard mushy-looking food at all. Same case here. Now, perhaps this food is healthier than some(I guess), but none of that matters if your cat refuses to eat it. Cats are picky and eat only what they like. From what I could tell, my cat didn''t care for this, and I wasn't too impressed either. Like I said, for the price I expected something better-looking. Thankfully, I was able to test this product out free-of-charge or else I would never have paid for it. If your cat likes regular, mushy cat food, they may like this, but if your cat (like mine) usually prefers something more flaky or grilled in texture, I would say skip this.

review/text: Our kitty seems to be partial to the Friskies pink can: salmon and beef.  This brand, though more expensive, did not seem to generate the enthusiasm that she has for the Friskies. She actually walked away and left this sitting. Maybe this would have generated more active gulping in the cold winter months (she's an outdoor cat) or maybe her tastes are just more pedestrian?<br /><br />The catfood has a pleasant color, looks fresh and smells OK. It does generate a little of its own juice.<br /><br />Surprising that she wasn't more interested in this well touted chicken catfood.

That's my fault for not reading the description more carefully.  The antler I got was just under 6 inches.  For a "large" I thought it would be at least 8?  So for $17 I'm feeling a little jipped.  The only redeeming part is that my dog does love to chew on this.

review/summary: my mother's favorite cookie
review/text: I have yet to try this product personally, because it is not currently available at our supermarket. But my mother,  soon will be 94, mildly diabetic and a long-time customer for sugar-free products, says they are the best! For some reason our store carries the other Murray varieties, but not this one any more, maybe because there are so many kinds. Mother picks out her own groceries, and was in the habit of buying these about every other week. She bought two other Murray's packages this week, but really wanted the peanut butter. That's why I went searching the internet for them. After I receive them, (12 boxes!) I probably will keep at least one box to try for myself. (It would be nice to be able to buy an assortment from Amazon rather than so many of one variety--that would be a lot for a 94-year-old woman to eat, even if they are that good!)

review/summary: No Health Benefits and Grossly Overpriced....Read the Nutrition Facts
review/text: My wife just brought home a $3 package containing 5.5 oz of Murray Sugar Free Pecan Shortbread cookies, thinking the high price was justified on a health basis. It isn't. Read the Nutrition Facts (per 3 cookies): 160 Calories, 11 Grams of Fat, 3 Grams of Saturated Fat, 18 Grams of Carbohydrate....the same, or worse, than most cookies containing sugar. These cookies may be "sugar free", but the implied health benefit is completely imaginary. Furthermore, at over 50 cents per ounce they are the most expensive packaged grocery cookies you can buy, which is completely unjustified by ingredient cost, and flavor, which is adequate but not exceptional.<br /><br />It's an unfortunate fact that some companies prey upon consumers who seek or need "special" products by forcing them to pay huge premiums for the product. Using Murray's formula, a can of Diet Coke should cost at least $3....but it doesn't, simply because production costs do not justify the premium and the market will not tolerate such an unconscionable mark-up. Neither should you. Don't let your health or dietary concerns override your common sense and lead you to pay preposterously inflated prices for "special" products that, upon close inspection, provide no legitimate benefit.

review/text: I was looking for something sweet that I as a diabetic and my husband and son could all share. Usually if it says sugar free then it means it has a chemical taste. But not these cookies they taste just like the regular cookies. I highly recommend them. You do not have to be a diabetic to eat them. They are made with splenda and I use splenda in a lot of things, I also use the brown sugar splenda in my cooking. These cookies are great.

review/summary: Yummy~My treat instead of High Sugar Cookies.
review/text: First I will make note this page says sweetened with sorbitol, they are not. They are sweetened with Splenda.<br />I think they taste as good as any other basic vanilla creme cookie. I like a bite of sweet at night but sugar keeps me awake so these fit the bill. The special that was going on when I got them made it a great deal. They cost up to $3.99 a pack where I live.....so this is a SWEET deal.<br /><br />They still have calories so you cannot eat the whole bag but they don't spike your sugar. Three cookies are 130 calories and 6 gms of fat. They are very sweet anymore and you may feel sick.

review/text: Love these cookies! When I learned a couple of years ago that I was heading toward diabetes and needed to cut out as much sugar as I could I knew I needed a "sweet" substitute.  I tried various products and found Murray Sugar Free cookies. I like oatmeal cookies anyway so gravitated toward their cookie. I promise I couldn't tell they didn't have sugar in them. I'm so addicted to them that I even carry them when I travel (wonder what the suitcase inspectors think?!) My grandkids even recognize MY cookies and now ask for them over the sugar-loaded kind. Trouble is, I can never find them. I don't know if they're just very popular or the wholesaler doesn't bring enough. It could be that I buyt 4 to 6 packages every time I DO find them. Murray says I can find them at Wal-Mart but never have although they do have the other flavors. Now I look to Amazon and they don't have them either! I have a hint of how drunks feel when they can't get their liquor! Please, Amazon, hurry and get a supply before I run out!

review/summary: Diabetics With A Sweet-Tooth --- REJOICE!
review/text: When I was diagnosed with type-II diabetes about two years ago, it felt like a death blow. I mean, I love sweets. And my favorite were peanut butter cookies (my wife also made a mean peanut butter cheesecake that I still crave to this day but am able to hold off thanks to these Murray Sugar Free Cookies). I'd tried other sugar free items but they all had a seriously bad after-taste to them. The artificial sweetners were pretty bad.<br /><br />But the Murray brand are pretty darned good. And I can eat about 6 of them that equal 32 carbs (I'm a tall guy --- 6 feet, three inches --- with a big frame). There's no horrible after-taste and the peanut butter flavor is just enough to satisfy my slavering pallete.<br /><br />If you're looking for a quality cookie that won't shoot your blood sugar up into the statosphere, these are a great option.

review/summary: Fab, as long as you understand what's in them!
review/text: My fiance & I are following a reduced carbohydrate eating plan.  Given that these are sugar free, they are great for when you need something sweet, but with a slighter glycemic impact than regular cookies.<br />They taste almost like Girl Scout Thin Mint patty cookies!  They are NOT, however, low in calories, or free from ingredients that some may feel are "unhealthy".<br />Since people's ideas vary greatly as to what is bad for them & what is okay, there is some understandable controversy.  In my opinion, most of America is over weight because they don't know HOW to eat, but that's just my take on things.  Everything is conflicting.  Low carbohydrate foods are higher in calories & vice verse.  I have an extreme digestive sensitivity to Malitol (Maltitol), which is a sweetener used in most sugar free chocolate items.  While these cookies don't contain Malitol (Maltitol),there are very few items available that are without it.<br />Bottom Line: They taste great!  My suggestion would be to check the ingredient list & nutritional information each & every time you purchase, I recommend purchasing in a grocery store, rather than online.

review/summary: Good enough!
review/text: For people avoiding sugar, Murray Sugar Free Cookies Oatmeal, are good enough! This whole thing about sugar free products got me intrigued and confused at the same time. Some products that advertised as being sugar free have a lot of other sources of sugar, like alcohol, that are high. The feeling I get with Murray's is that they are reliable in their claims. I see them in all sorts of reputable publications and that gives me encouragement regarding their advertisement. As to the taste I can say they are pretty good tasting. Have tried their other ones and this one and the chocolate are the ones I favor. Who am I? Hungry hungry all the time for sweets but I realize not all sugar free items are created equal. For now a decent 4 stars rating!

review/text: I ordered these cookies for my husband as he's diabetic and loves peanut butter treats, so it was no surprise that he really liked them.  What was surprising, however, was that I liked them, too!  As a rule, I do not like peanut butter anything, and can barely stand the smell of it.  But these cookies aren't your typical peanut butter cookie.  They are pleasantly fragrant, delicately buttery and crisp (no mealiness like most others), with good-sized pieces of peanuts mixed in. Just delicious!

review/text: My favorite uncle is diabetic, and I always feel awful when I invite him for my birthday and he can't join in on eating cake with the rest of us. I picked up a package of these and used them for a cookie crust on a cream pie with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HVD4">Jell-O Sugar-Free Instant Pudding & Pie Filling, Chocolate, 1.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)</a> and whipped cream lightly sweetened with non-sugar sweetener. The result was gorgeous and tasted pretty good even to those of us who can have sugar. For him? He told me "You know I can't have sugar." and when I told him it was sugar free he dug in with gusto. He said "It's not even my birthday and I feel like I got the best present."<br />It was so easy to make, and the crust was his favorite part. I gave him an extra package of cookies I bought and he enjoyed those a lot too.<br />Love these for making it so much easier to make special treats for my uncle.

review/summary: Big Chocolate Taste
review/text: I could EASILY gain 15-20lbs from Halloween until New Years Day so this year my husband and I decided to try not to go overboard on all the cookies/candy that is so available.<br /><br />I bought these cookies thinking they would be a poor substitute but SURPRISE, they really do have a huge chocolately taste and while they won't take the place of home-made fudge or gourmet chocolates, they are still satisfying.<br /><br />They are tiny, not much bigger than a life saver really and come in 80 calorie packages so I don't have to worry about portion control. Also, it can be hard to get enough fiber in your diet every day so I like the fact that these have 3 grams of fiber per package. My husband is a type II diabetic and these do have 16 grams of carbs but because of the fiber, they don't spike his blood sugar.<br /><br />The only downside to these is they do have 3g sugar alcohol which can cause some people stomach upset.<br /><br />I'm still probably going to have goodies this holiday season but with these cookies in my pantry, I know I won't indulge as often.

review/text: Worth the price and trouble of buying them. Even if your not diabetic they will help you take sugar out of your diet.  These are by far NO regular diet cookies. There simply to good to pass up.  Get some.  I recommend it.

review/summary: Best Sugar Free Cookie~You get 8 as a serving :)
review/text: It is hard to believe these are sugar free. They are so good. They are buttery and rich tasting and a serving is 8 cookies of 130 calories. That is so filling and yet still keeps you on whatever plan you are following.<br /><br />I have tried many of the flavors of these cookies and not found one to be bad or have an aftertaste. This one is my all time favorite. You will not be disappointed. In my town they are usually $3.99 a pack so this is a fantastic deal.<br /><br />They come with a long expiration date also.

review/text: I've really enjoyed these cookies, and came to Amazon as this one is hard to find. Much to my SHOCK the price is 60+ dollars.. and it shows they used to be 30.00 and some change? Huh?? Other cookies by Murray are more reasonable. No way will I buy them at this incredible markup :-P

review/summary: Disappointed with Amazon
review/text: Not sure how I feel about the product, Murray Sugar Free Cookies. My disappointment is with Amazon for sending EXPIRED COOKIES. After notifying Amazon I received an apology email and a new delivery was sent to recipent. I was shocked to receive a second call from the recepient that the 2nd delivery was also EXPIRED having the same expiration date as the first delivery. Next thing I know I receive an email from Amazon my money is being refunded. Have no idea what happened. I was embarrassed and disappointed the first time. Imagine my embarrassment the second time. The recepient is a diabetic and loves Murray Sugar Free Cookies but she is only able to find Shortbread in our stores and Peanut Butter is her favorite.

review/text: Have a family member that is diabetic, so I always keep some of these on hand for when we get together and standard sweets are not an option.  Very tasty.  They used Splenda, so that will be a pro or con to you, depending on if you like it.<br /><br />I am very thankful for these cookies for helping to provide a bit or normalcy for this family member.  Just like normal cookies, but sugar-free.  Several great varieties.  Worth a try if you are looking for a sugar-free cookie.

They are very good tasting, don't have any "Sugary muck" taste, just plain, but really filling and don't give me gas.<br /><br />I like them with iced tea or pelican juice.<br /><br />Since there's no Sugar in them you can leave them out in the sun without getting a diabetic seizure.  Ants don't like them for some reason.

review/text: St. Dalfour is the best-kept secret on the gourmet diet market! Take it to work; pop open the can (no refrigeration required) and eat without heating in the microwave. You can heat if you wish, but the taste is to die for sans heat.<br />Yes, this is imported from France where they really know about food. Contains vegetables and sea-caught salmon with no preservatives or additives--totally healthy! They do have a website with more variety, but as you probably know by now, the prices at Amazon can't be beat!

review/text: I bought these little meals (or snacks, if you have a bigger appetite) on Amazon and just had to buy more. They are really seasoned just perfectly. I don't add the honey, which comes in a packet - that honey must be a 'French' thing.<br /><br />If you normally get the tuna salad with crackers that is sold in the supermarket and handy for lunch or snacks, you'll love this. It is flavorful, a good alternative when you just get tired of tuna.<br /><br />I wish I could buy larger quantities of this stuff on Amazon.

review/summary: Love these Frijoles!
review/text: We've grown to absolutely love La Preferida Mexican Homestyle Beans.  We have them every time we make fajitas at home.  I've even added them to chili.  There's just something about the combination of ingredients that creates a very flavorful dish.  And these are whole beans in a tasty sauce, not the smashed paste that all other brands seem to offer.  Alas, these La Preferida beans are no longer available in my neighborhood - and I'm not gonna eat that bean paste everyone else sells.  I was very pleased to find these available on Amazon.  Bought two cases, received in two different shipments.  First shipment was fine.  The second shipment not so fine - every can was dented.  So far so good, though.

review/summary: Best No Bean Chili for Hot Dogs!
review/text: I discovered this product one day at the market and decided to try it.  It was so good that I stopped buying Hormel's no bean chili for my hot dogs.  It has a touch of sweetness and a little heat.  Since I'm from New Orleans, I had additional cayenne pepper and chili powder.  It has a good texture and taste!  I would definitely recommend this product.  Out of all of the canned hot dog chili's, I rate this one as the best.

review/summary: More uses than you would think.
review/text: These Anchos are fantastic. Ancho is actually ripe smoked and dried poblano peppers.<br />Similar to how a chipolte is smoked and dried red jalapeno.<br /><br />These chiles have a mild to medium heat with a sweet fruity flavor with hints of cherry,<br />fig, and mild tabasco peppers. It's a favorite in Mexican cooking, and especially in mole,<br />but it has a wide range of uses from sauces to salsas and even steak and barbecue sauce.<br />This stuff is also a critical ingredient in the best enchilada sauces.<br /><br />These Badia peppers are properly sun-dried and not the variety of oven dried peppers more<br />commonly found that makes the peppers somewhat bitter. You can use these right out of the<br />bag by crushing or grinding, or you could toast them in oil to really bring out their flavor.<br />Most people just reconstitute them in water and puree them for sauces. At any rate, this is<br />one of the most useful and flavorful ingredients for a variety of dishes than you are likely<br />to find anywhere. 5 Pods

review/summary: Firm Bean - Pleasing Color
review/text: Cooked up nice... firm texture with beans retaining their shape (no splitting, no mushing); used a bit of bacon fat, fresh pot herbs, and canned chicken broth for the pot liquor.  The color was pleasing to the eye; a pinkish-kidney bean hue.  I used them in a chili with roasted sirloin tip and fresh peppers.  I rinsed them and soaked them overnight; they were remarkably clean and without blemish or "floaters."  More than what I typically spend for a humble legume but I'd buy them again.  Am well pleased with my selection.

review/summary: 17 Hours and Still Not Done
review/text: A package of Gourmet Valley Heirloom Beans Red Calypso Beans were purchased at the very tony Ferry Plaza in San Francisco in January.  For something like ten dollars.  We attempted to cook them over the weekend, but after 17 hours with the beans, which had been pre-soaked overnight, still quite hard, we pitched them, knowing they would be a joke forever.  We realize now that they are called Heirloom Beans because they are from some long ago harvest.  Perhaps during the Great Depression, when beans were carefully stored.  Caution:  Stay far away from even thinking about purchasing these beans!
