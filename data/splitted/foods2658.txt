review/text: I am surprised nobody has reviewed this item yet. It's SO GOOD. I love pistachios and when I saw these at my local store I had to get them. I love how they are shelled for you, so you can pop them into your mouth already. They are ROASTED, and you can tell! Some of them remind me of roasted and salted pumpkin seeds. I recommend them for sure.

review/text: Don't waste your money on this brand of nuts. To begin with, they taste soft as though stale, and that includes the skin, which should be crispy. The worst thing about them them though, is that at least two thirds of them are dark brown inside instead of green, which makes them inedible. My advise is try another brand, I don't see how it could possibley be any worse.

review/text: I love eating pistachios.  I like the pistachio taste and their crunch. I do not like having to open the shells though. I opted to try these as an alternative to the Keenan Farms in the shells that I normally order.  The pricing was very reasonable and none of the nuts were stale. While these where ok as far as pistachios go, they lacked the firm crunch and strong flavor I enjoy. Yes these were easy to eat, but missing out on the flavor and crunch make these a one-time order for me.

review/text: This product is good for kittens and adult cats. I did not purchase the food from Amazon. I received samples from my vet. I have a four month old kitten, who did not eat it well on his first introduction;however, on a repeat serving he ate it very well. It is now what he prefers to his previous food. If you are uncomfortabe ordering the four pound bag without knowing your cat's reception to it, I suggest that you call Sojos 888-867-6567,and request a sample bag. You can get several servings(kitten size) from a sample bag. The price at Amazon is less than the website and my vet. I will use Amazon for my next purchase.

I think cats are just more picky. Good idea, but I won't bother buying it.

review/summary: Bad Business Practice.
review/text: I ordered four boxes of truffles recently and they came damaged and melted! I had already given one bag away as a gift not knowing the goods are damaged. I also contacted seller and the seller claimed no responsibility. The Seller blamed me for using regular shipment, then sent me their "Summer Shipping Policy". If the seller knew that this type of incident happened frequently, then the seller should ONLY offer express shipping, NOT regular shipping.  The seller then argued that I purchased these truffles at a discount, implying that I should not be complaining. Purchasing the items at this so called "discount" (still more expensive than the price you can get at Costco) is not an issue. If the seller wanted to get rid of these damaged goods at a discount, the seller should have noted "damaged  goods" when they made an offer on Amazon. After all, isn't purchasing goods at a discount the reason why we all shop online at Amazon? The seller also brought up that I should have noticed that earlier (I just received these 4 boxes couple weeks ago, and just opened one box for myself today). Are we supposed to open all the boxes we order when we receive the shipment? Then, how can I give them away as a gift?<br />The seller also suggested that I should file a claim on Amazon and may be Amazon would take the responsibility and give me a refund. Overall, this is very unfortunate and bad business practice.

review/text: These are good - but I must say I was somewhat disappointed in the flavor. I had these a few years ago and remember a richer, more "real" taste. These are still good, but I can't help but think that perhaps some of the ingrediants were changed. I noticed one of the first ingrediants was Palm Kernal Oil, and wonder if it didn't used to be Cocoa Butter.<br /><br />I really don't know? ... but these do taste different than I remember them tasting a couple years ago... still good enough to eat and serve and give away... but not quite that same, "wow" taste I remember.

Unfortunately the second batch only had 23 bully sticks in the package. the package looked less full then our first which is why I counted it to make sure there were 30 pieces.

review/summary: My dogs areVery satisfied
review/text: These were an experiment that worked well.  My 2 large dogs spent more time with these than with any other product to date. Sometimes as much as 10 min. which is a record for them.  My small dog spends about a day on it.  They have that "crunch" that dogs seem to like and they grab them and go when they are offered.  I like that they are a USA product.  They are odor-free.  Not all companies' are odor-free.  They are a good size at 6 in. and the thicknesses vary which is good since the small dog is better off with the thinner ones.  I will be buying these again.  The company was great to deal with.  Product came swiftly by USPS Priority.

review/summary: skinny and stinky
review/text: My 2 labs absolutely love bully sticks and I've ordered bully sticks from Amazon prior to this order.  I decided to go with these as the price was right, well now I know why the price is right-these things are very thin or skinny and they have a stink that's stronger then the normal bully sticks.  My 2 labs gobble these things down within a few minutes that's how thin/skinny they are.  And the smell of urine is strong!  Will go back to the sticks that are a thicker and less stinky when this batch is done, which should be just about now...

review/summary: My Dogs are in Chew Heaven
review/text: After having a beloved pet choke to death on a Greenie, the breeder recommended Bully bones for my dog's teeth. Unlike the greenies, this product will not break off and lodge in your dog's throat. I initially bought this product at Petsmart and while very expensive there, my dogs loved them and were actually chewing more. About two months ago I found these at Amazon. What a price difference. These are the same product I had been buying at the petstore but MUCH cheaper. I give these bones to my dogs after dinner and give them about a half hour to chew. After that I put them away until the next day. From the way the dogs react when I bring them out, they stay fresh.

review/summary: NOT DIGESTABLE AND CAUSE DEATH OR SERIOUS ILLNESS
review/text: SADLY, I FOUND OUT THE HARD WAY THAT THESE MOO BULLY STICKS ARE NOT 100% DIGESTIBLE! MY DOG ALMOST DIED AFTER A PIECE DID NOT DISSOLVE IN HER STOMACH.My 3 dogs loved these Moo Bully sticks. I was buying them and giving them because I felt it might causes a chocking danger. I always had plenty of water close by. One day I noticed my dog,Lily, was having very loose stools and that were jelly like in consistency.This same day she stopped eating and began vomiting.I immediately rushed her to my veterinarian.Upon his physical exam he noted that her abdomen was hard and distended.He wanted me to leave her with him so he could do a x-ray. He did and found that she had a bloackege in her stomach!He then started a series of Barium x-rays to watch the blockage to see if it was going to pass. Over a 4 hour period of watching and repeating these barium x-rays it not only showed that the blockage was not passing, but the "item" causing the blockage was swelling in size, absorbing the stomach fluids.I was told he had to do emergency surgery to get this blockage out of her ASAP. What he found in her stomach was most definitely a piece of the Moo Bully stick! It had not digested as claimed  by the manufacture if swallowed.My veterinarian told me if he had not brought Lily in as promptly as I did,to remove this blockage, she most definitely would have died!He told me that this was not 100% digestible as the manufacture had claimed it to be . If it had been, it would have dissolved in her stomach! lily had major abdominal exploratory surgery  that lasted over 3hours, to remove this piece the piece of Moo Bully stick !She was hospitalized afterwards for 4 nights and 5 days. She almost did not make. Lily refused eat for 5 days. She therefore lost a lot of weight,became very frail and lethargic. Thank god, my veterinarian was fabulous.He was so concerned for Lily, that he actually stayed by her side at night,every night making sure he did everything he could to pull her through this.Once home she was weak and could barely walk. I tried to get her to eat and she refused. I was offering her cooked chicken liver and even this did not even entice her to eat. Finally, the next day, she did begin to nibble on some food. It was a very slow healing process and took Lily over a month until she was herself again.The thought of losing Lily tore me apart. Watching the pain and suffering she went though cannot be put into words.I felt so helpless. It was nothing but a pure hell that she and I went though for weeks on end.I was also feeling so guilty because I gave her the MOO Bully stick.You see, I only feed my dogs the very best, high quality organic dog foods. I never ever ever would give my dogs anything that was not the best and the safest. I never gave my dogs raw hide chewies or greenies( Any dog owner that cares about the welfare of their a dog knows how dangerous and deadly these products are) I started giving my dogs the Moo bully sticks because everything I had read and researched lead me to believe not only were they safe,  100%  DIGESTIBLE, but that they came from Brazil cattle that only grazed on non chemically treated grass, were not feed any hormones and drank from fresh natural spring water.There was nothing harmful in this product. So I stared giving my dogs these MOO bully sticks.I am a very dedicated,caring, responsible animal lover and owner. I wrote letters to the companies I purchased the Moo Bully sticks form as well as the manufacturer. Only one retailer responded to my letter by referring me to the manufacturer.The manufacturer of these Moo Bully Sticks, " Free Range Dog Products " totally ignored both of my certified letters. So many owners have no clue that their dogs may have become sick or died due to a piece of a Bully stick that did not digest. What if their vet missed the symptoms? What if they never took their dog to a vet after becoming ill and the dog died? What if they never discovered what killed their dog? Not everyone can afford to pay for surgery on their dogs, x-rays,lab work,medicines,and a hospital stay. My vet bill was almost $5,000.00 My vet even discounted most of what he did, as well not charge me for everything.In fact, he  he felt so bad, that he did not charge me for staying by her side for all through the night, on those  4 nights. What if a dog died or got very ill when ingesting a piece of these Bully sticks and never came forth to inform the public ? Maybe mine is the very first case? But all it should take is one, to satisfy anyone not to ever buy this product and give it their beloved dogs. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, DO NOT EVER GIVE YOUR DOGS ANY TYPE OF A BULLY STICK PRODUCT!PASS THIS INFO ALONG TO ANYONE THAT YOU KNOW HAS A DOG. YOU MIGHT JUST SAVE A DOGS LIFE.I HAD TO HIGHLIGHT ONE STAR TO GET THIS POST! :-(

review/text: I have a one year old, four pound Pomeranian and she goes through these bully sticks at record speed. Other brands last on average four to five days. One particular stick didn't last much longer than an hour.<br /><br />Also, the smell is overwhelming. I am used to the "bully stink" however these were especially pungent. Simply removing the stick from the bag would transfer the smell to the skin.<br /><br />Although shipping was very fast, I will not be ordering this product again. I think it is worth paying a little bit more for a less smelly and longer lasting bully.

review/summary: Very quick shipping, but
review/text: Shipping was quick and pricing significantly below what I was paying at the local pet supply stores.  Items were packaged well and there was no overwhelming smell when opening the package.  I have 2 dogs and both like these items very much. My issue is the smell while the dogs are chewing on the bully sticks.  I have read on the Internet that some bully sticks do not stink when being consumed.  The claim is that the bully sticks are prepared by draining them of fluids at some point in the processing.  I've purchased these sticks at pet supply stores for between $2 and $4 each.  These are no different.  My personal expectations was there would be less smell, thus the 3 star rating. However, I need to emphasize that the product was delivered quickly which is important.  I'm sure if my dogs could rate these they would give a 5 star rating.  One of my dogs will finish off a stick in about 20 minutes while the other smaller dog may only be less than a fifth through the stick in 20 minutes. From this perspective they do keep the dog busy, and I'm supposing that it is accurate that these treats are much better for your dog than than the rawhide chews. My dogs love those too but get gassy eating them.  I've read that dogs don't digest them very well.<br /><br />I would definitely buy from this source again if I find out that it is a myth that some bully sticks don't stink while the dogs are chewing on them. I've not seen any statement to that effect on any packaging thus far so it very well may be a myth. I'm going to look around a little more for the elusive bully sticks that don't stink.

review/summary: Quality has gone down significantly
review/text: I've purchased this item a number of times and had been satisfied until my most recent order.  Aside from only including 28 bully sticks (rather than 30), they were all tiny.  On average, the sticks in my most recent shipment were only about 1/3 as thick as previous shipments and are absolutely nothing like the photo of the product.  Some were no thicker than a pencil.  I'm pretty sure my Goldendoodle will be able to eat one of these in less than a minute, which defeats the purpose.<br /><br />I was previously a satisfied customer, so I'm really disappointed in the sudden and completely unacceptable downturn in quality.

And when the dogs start chewing them - forget it!!! The smell gets even worse.  To make matters even worse, when I contacted the vendor, they tried to feed me some line about how the bully sticks may have a "slight" odor.  First, there is nothing slight about the odor and second, I did not pay for bully sticks that had a "slight" odor - they advertized and I paid for odor free bully sticks!!!<br /><br />I am totally unsatisfied with the product and the service.

review/text: The first time we ordered these bullies the quality was good and our dog was very satisfied. We were happy too because they were low-odor. However, the order we got this time is very much NOT low-odor, nor are the sticks as thick as the first batch. They look as though they've been split lengthwise. These are also very greasy, and I'm afraid to give them to the dog for fear they'll leave a mark on the furniture.

review/summary: Update: Not A Good Buy Any Longer
review/text: NOTE:<br />Below is my original review.  Since this review I have bought another bag and they were TERRIBLE QUALITY.  The sticks, many of them, were skinny as twigs.  Many of the other sticks stank and were weird shapes.  This was a "seconds" batch.  It's tough because I know bestbullysticks.com sells perfect sticks from their own website---but when they sell to Amazon customers---I dunno---I think the ship Amazon the ones that cannot sell from their own site due to poor quality.  I will NOT be ordering from them again.  I will spend more--there are some that are about $10 more---but at least I won't feel annoyed that I got "seconds."  Read my original review too--it is still helpful in making your decision.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />I've ordered three packs of this exact item from Best Bully Sticks/Amazon.  When I ordered from their own branded Website, the sticks were immaculate and had a branded label.  They were all the same size and color and seemed uniform.  I got them on sale from the brand Website and so paid what I do currently from Amazon.  When I went to order more, the sale was no longer on and they were significantly more expensive.  Amazon had the same Best Bully Sticks (odor free) and the same product count for the sale price I paid.  Excellent.  However, when I received the bag it wasn't labeled, the sticks were splintered and the sizes were not uniform and seemed dryer than my original purchase.  They seemed like seconds.  But, because of the price, and the fact that my dog didn't seem to mind--I bought them again from Amazon.  This time, though the bag was again unlabeled, the sticks were uniform and of the same quality as my first batch.  These sticks do get gooey---a good thing---when your dog starts to chew them.  So, if they do appear dry or brittle, this does soften almost immediately.  I have an 8 month old sheepdog puppy and this size seems to last him about 20mins!  If your dog is a heavy chewer and a Bully Stick addict, don't expect these or really any 6" sticks to last more than an hour--MAX!  Again, great deal as one bully stick from Petco can be 4-5 bucks!

review/text: I just received these bully stick treats for my dog and eagerly opened them to give her one.  They are supposed to be odor free - they are most definitely NOT!!  I have bought many bully sticks in the past from other suppliers and they all have a slight odor to them so I was excited to find some that said "odor free".  These smell so much worse than the kind I usually buy.  I had to send her outside with her treat and now I'm stuck with 29 more of them!  I usually give them to her when she is left alone in the house as she is a very small dog and can't be outside alone.  These are not going to work for that purpose.  I'm so disappointed.  I would definitely not say they are odor free nor are they the best price out there for normal bully sticks.

My dog loves these stick regardless of how they smell but when a premium is charged for "Select Odor Free", they should be just that. For comparison, I still have a few sticks left over from a batch purchased late last year and those have very little odor at all. This latest batch is flat out ripe. There was a lot of size variation in this package too. Some sticks were very thin, others were clearly of better grade. This selection was just inconsistent. It's unfortunate to see prices going up while quality goes in the opposite direction. I will probably continue to purchase with the hope that quality improves.

review/summary: Odorless? NOPE!
review/text: Although the order came earlier than expected (a plus), I am very disappointed that these bully sticks are definitely NOT odorless. Yes, I know what bully sticks are made of, so even the concept of odor free is asking a lot--but I also know that I have purchased sticks locally that are truly odor-free. Unfortunately, the local ones are very expensive--so I took a chance on this product based on other reviews. The bag of sticks I received stinks to high heaven. And, since the product has been opened (how else would I know they stink!?), it appears I can't return the unused sticks. Bummer. Of course, the dog loves them, but I can't have this smell in my house, so they'll be going in the trash can.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: NOT ODOR FREE!!! In fact, they smell worse than some others that we've ordered that were not dubbed "Odor Free Sealed".<br />The sticks themselves are a great size, but I had purchased them because they were "Odor Free Sealed", so I was greatly disappointed.

review/summary: Best Bullies Yet - VERY Satisfied So Far!
review/text: First of all, I don't often write reviews, and I NEVER write them right away, but having been through more brands and types of bully sticks than I can count (just in the 6-1/2 months that I've had my puppy), and reviews being essential in helping me finally find decent bullies, I felt it's my duty to "pay it forward" in a matter of speaking, and hopefully help you guys like me, lost in the vast world that ranges from horrible, disgusting, gone-in-a-day bullies, to fantastic & tolerable smelling-good value- bullies -- as these are! I just received these bullies today- about a half hour ago (to be exact), so I can't say for sure about how *long* each will last, but my 7-1/2 month Westie puppy has been happily chomping away in his bed ever since,  and these bullies are so thick that he's totally immersed in them, and I can hear him from across the room, "digging" into it, a sign that they are going to last quite a while (at least for my moderate (but constant)-chewer, and 10-ish pound puppy, but with all his "big boy teeth".<br /><br />Also, I counted, and there were indeed the full 30 count included, as promised, in a neatly packaged and sealed in a zip-lock type bag, labeled w/company's info and a blank spot which is I found convenient for writing down the orig date, size (6"), and qty (30) incl so that I could track how long it takes him to go through them once he runs out. Then to keep them fresh, I took five out, put them in a separate zip-lock, and then double bagged the rest in another gallon sized zip-lock and put it in the freezer, and will take them out as I need to (I think my pup actually prefers them frozen- but he also loves ice cubes and such too).<br /><br />I was also impressed with the overall weight of the package. It's so hard to decide what to buy when it comes to bullies b/c of the different sizing and pricing options... For example the last time I ordered, I ordered a 1-pound bag for less than what this bag cost, but this bag felt at least as heavy- I'm sure b/c they are much thicker- and the bullies from the "1-pound" bag were chewed up in no time- again, my dog is only about 10 lbs, and a constant, but I wouldn't say "aggressive" or "heavy" chewer.<br /><br />A couple other notes- these bullies aren't "odor-free", however, being what they are, I don't believe it's possible to be natural bullies and be completely odor-free. But they are MUCH better than any bullies I've bought in the past. There have been some that have made me literally sick to my stomach, to the point where I'd have to eat meals in my bedroom, to avoid the bully smell. These I can't smell unless I'm right near it. They also don't look the nicest- not sure why that is... they look like they may be "stringy" but I've read other reviews saying that these particular bullies aren't, so I'm hoping that turns out to be accurate- only time will tell.<br /><br />My only complaint (which isn't really a big deal) is that I wasn't able to track the shipping past when it was submitted for shipment. And it only bugged me b/c my pup was getting separation anxiety that was getting in the way of a lot of things, and is only appeased by a distracting treat- bullies being the best. But they got here within 3-4 days, with free shipping, so I'm not complaining!<br /><br />So if you're in the market for bullies, I definitely recommend trying these for your pup- every dog is different, but these are certainly worth a try!!!

review/summary: Excellent buy
review/text: If you buy these in a pet store they are 12 bucks apiece, way too expensive and I highly recommend the odorless ones b/c the non-odorless ones smell to high heaven.  Our dog loves these and will sit there until it's almost done, then carry it around and consume the rest later.  They're wonderful for his teeth, it helps to make them so bright and shiny and don't worry if it gets small, your dog won't choke on it, it kind of melts by the time he's that far down.  Definitely messy, but it keeps him busy and he loves them.

review/summary: Back for our third order
review/text: I'm ordering for the third time. These bully sticks are perfect for my chewers, my whippet puppy in particular (35 lbs.) We use these as a general treat and as a way to enforce quiet time.<br /><br />I've counted the package that arrives both times and found exactly 30 pieces present, as the description states. In my first count I couldn't believe that it was going to be correct because it looked like there were fewer than 30 but the # was correct. Some pieces are thinner than others but I've found the average to be acceptable. The difference is slight.<br /><br />I've bought branded bully sticks (I've forgotten the brand) at the local pet store for $3.95 each, these are on-par with those branded ones and much cheaper.<br /><br />They come in a large, tough ziploc-type plastic bag that works for storage. Bully sticks stink a little bit, but these are the same level of low-stink as the fancy ones from the fancy pet store, I have no complaints. I've bought Target brand bully sticks before and threw them away in disgust, they were greasy, really really smelly, super small, highly variable in thickness, and left marks on everything.

review/summary: Disappointed...quality is usually better
review/text: I'm bummed to say these bully sticks aren't the quality I was expecting, although they were shipped VERY quickly, so if you're in a time crunch they'll work.<br /><br />As a previous reviewer said, make sure to count your package.  There were only 28 in mine, and several of them were so hollow and flimsy (more like just a dried sheet or skin or something) I wouldn't even count them as full bully sticks.  They were also really greasy.  Considering I've had much better luck ordering directly through the BBS website, I won't be ordering these again.  Too bad, because the price and shipping were great!

review/text: I have a very hyper but adorable chihuahua papillon mix. He is my favorite little thing in the world but every now and then I need him to settle down and let me do other things then pay attention to him. These bully sticks are a god send. He loves them. They are a great price. I've ordered from ebay and from other pet websites and can't find anything better then these. It takes him from 4-5 hours to get through one of them depending on how thick they are. It does vary a little. And then have the typically bully stick ichiness, and they aren't completely odor free, but it's tolerable. They are worth every penny to me for a little down time.

review/text: They are kind of dried out, but that means that it doesn't stink like pee when the dogs chew on them.  The dogs don't like them quite as much as regular bully sticks, but they like them better than rawhide (and my roommates prefer these to regular bully sticks due to the smell).  Plus they are also safer for young dogs than rawhide.<br /><br />They are far cheaper than you can get them elsewhere, so it is also worth getting 1 or 2 that are really scrawny looking (the rest look like the smaller ones that you'd get at the pet store).

Though sometimes they can last a long while (let her chew for 30mins - 1hr and then take it away with 1/3 - 1/4 left). Other times they last no time at all. One stick she went through in a full 15 minutes. Either she was starving, or it wasn't as strong as the others she'd had.
