review/summary: It's only cardboard.
review/text: Our cat Naboo enjoys this scratcher. There really isn't much to it. It just a bunch of cardboard with a small bag of cat nip. I took one star off because the scratcher is so light that the cat ends up pulling it all over. We had to put a couple weights inside which then make the hanging toy inside unusable.<br /><br />Speaking of the hanging toy... it is definitely not a furry green mouse. It is basically a ball of paper. Not that my cat doesn't like that ball of paper. It's just that the product photo completely misleads the buyer into thinking they are getting a quality mouse toy.<br /><br />Overall I am satisfied and so is my cat. Do it up.

review/summary: Good scratcher
review/text: My cat loves to scratch and climb on this.  The hidden toy lasted about a week before it was torn out, but the structure of the box has lasted the 5 months I've had it and I expect it to last 3-9 months more.  It was a great, cheap solution to put next to the couch.

review/summary: Cat loved it, but it only lasted two weeks
review/text: I got this product specifically because Kong has a great reputation for durable dog toys. I thought their cat toys would be durable. I wasn't expecting it to last forever (it is made entirely of cardboard after all) but I was hoping our cat would get at least a month's worth of enjoyment out of it.<br /><br />Our cat absolutely loved this toy. She didn't care about the catnip, but she loved scratching the cardboard. This style of scratcher is great for cats who like to scratch carpet or rugs rather than scratching vertical surfaces.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the scratch toy didn't even last for two weeks before our cat had destroyed it utterly, including the cardboard base. I also feel like it's worth noting that the toy is not a plush mouse, as pictured on the site, but is a ball of tissue paper (which our cat totally ignored). I wish I had realized that I could get one with a plastic base for only five more dollars (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GLR8IU">Omega Paw SBE Scratch Box Everest</a>) but I thought the Kong scratcher would be a bit more durable than it was!

review/summary: Gets 5 claws up from my cats!
review/text: This scratcher seems to bring out more interactive behavior in cats than most types -- they love to climb on it, lie beside it and reach in the hole for the dangle toy.  They also reach and stretch more when they are scratching it.  I like knowing it is "earth friendly".

review/summary: Couldn't get cat to care about it
review/text: My cat scratched it maybe once or twice and then never again. Maybe if I had placed a weight in the base, like some mentioned, to stop it from sliding around she would have used it more. Ended up making a DIY post out of sisal rope, wood, and a tube of cardboard that carpet gets sold on.<br /><br />Other cats may like it, it was built exactly like I would have expected - cardboard.

review/summary: Great, except for one flaw....or two
review/text: I think this is a great product. My cat loves this and uses it, and I barely need to use catnip for her to go to it. The toy inside is a great idea and keeps her interested. The only problem is that the outside holder for the scratcher is also made of cardboard, so this is not durable at all. Once it gets wet or bitten, it falls apart. That being said, I also think it's ridiculous to sell pieces of cardboard for $10. But I did buy this product, which means me and many other people are too lazy to construct one of our own. Darn you companies for exploiting our laziness.

review/summary: It's OK.
review/text: My cats enjoy inclined ramps to scratch, and it helps save the chair arms and the bed box-spring!  I like the fact that it is made from recycled materials, comes put together, and is not expensive.  It also arrived quickly.  They ARE scratching it, but it's a little too narrow and inclined, so it's not overly stable. When they run up and down it, it wobbles.  Also, I do not like the fact that a small green mouse toy is advertised, and that is NOT what it comes with - it is just a crinkled paper ball!!!!  It's an OK product, but I've gotten the "Fat Cat Big Mama's Scratch 'n Play Ramp for Cats with Catnip by Bamboo" before, and that's what I will be purchasing in the future.  Check that one out for a better product (the design is a bit feminine, but there is another scratcher in their line that is more "neutral" but it is a flat scratcher).

review/summary: It's saving my couches
review/text: I have had this scratcher for about three months.  I have been buying several scratchers over the past year because my cats like to scratch the couches.  My cats do not like the smaller cardboard scratchers because they are not at an incline and they move when my cats scratch them.  They also are not that interested in the turbo scratcher with the ball.  At first my cats didn't warm up to this scratcher as much, although they really liked the toy.  However, now they enjoy the scratcher 200%.  I also give them a treat when they scratch where they are supposed to scratch.<br /><br />I have been using a lot of double-sided carpet tape (you can get it at most hardware stores in the carpet section.)  I attach it to where the cats scratch so that they get sticky paws and don't want to scratch there again.  I also use it to attach this scratcher to the floor so it doesn't move when my cats scratch.<br /><br />Try this scratcher before you try the expensive scratchers that cost $50 or more.  Also, anchor it to the floor with carpet tape.

review/text: I have gone through several different types of formula and this one by far has been the best choice for my daughter's sensative tummy. My first daughter also used the ProSobee Soy formula as well and it worked wonders. I find that although you can save money buying the generic brands I just trust the Enfamil name so why mess with a good thing. I would recommend it to anyone who has an infant with a sensative tummy.

review/text: I love this stuff.  I've tried several gluten-free mixes, and OrgraN is definitely my favorite.  I also can't have eggs or dairy, so I loved that the mix is also free of these.<br /><br />I will note that I did NOT have success with their vegan option for the cake  -- turns out more like pancakes -- but I tweaked it with my own vegan recipe with no problems.  I used crisco instead of butter (vegan butter did not work so well, nor did oil) and tofu instead of eggs.  (1/4 cup of silken tofu, firm, + 1 tsp baking powder = 1 egg.)  You reallllly have to beat away to get the tofu as creamy as possible if you're going to use it, though.  Mix all wet ingredients first before adding the dry.<br /><br />If you're a bundle of allergies like me and are tired of funny textured, blah-tasting cakes, give this a try.<br /><br />P.S. Betty Crocker's icings are all gluten-free.  I use the white icing with this one.  Mmm.

review/summary: Gritty? Why so much sugar?
review/text: I don't know if it was a problem with bad storage, but this peanut butter was filled with grit from one of the ingredients: "evaporated cane juice" which is actually raw sugar. It precipitated out in the peanut butter and made a gritty consistency. And of course, it was too sweet. The raisins didn't show until half the jar was used, and the cinnamon flavor was weak.<br /><br />This is nice on celery for "ants on a log" (celery, peanut butter, raisins) which is a great kiddy snack--oh, who'm I foolin? I love it, too. But the use of the sugar made this too sweet and the texture even on crunchy celery isn't great.<br /><br />Why don't they use molasses or honey as a sweetener? And less of it; raisins are plenty sweet as they are.<br /><br />Not really recommended.

review/text: Beware: This is just man-made doggy junkfood. I always try to give my dog natural minimally-processed chews and treats, she goes through a lot of bully sticks, pig ears, & himalayan chews. When I bought this in a store, the label didn't say what it was made of & I thought it was a bully stick or other bit of dried anatomy like a large tendon. Nice that it's odor-free but the texture seemed unusual, it's sort chewy like a heavy dried dough, not tough & durable like a normal bully stick. My 20lb bicha-poo ate a WHOLE 12" Chew-A-Bull in about half an hour. After looking it up online I discovered that this is not a natural meat product at all but a man-made fake bully stick. Ingredients: Potato starch, meat by product, corn starch, sorbitol, liver, cellulose, water, egg, lecithin, calcium stearate, titanium dioxide, caramel color, sorbic acid. I won't be buying a Chew-A-Bull again: Full of weird ingredients, not natural, and it does not last.

review/summary: Light on Ginger, Heavy on Pear
review/text: NB: My review is of the tea itself and not the merchant. Also, although 24 tea bags is listed, only 20 come in the box.<br /><br />Straight out of the package the aroma was a halting sweet and spicy with fruity undertones made even more potent when brewed. It's too bad that the taste couldn't live up to that exciting fragrance. From the name (Green Ginger) I expected to taste a bit more ginger and a lot less pear. To be clear, the tea was all right, but rather underwhelming for this ginger lover.

review/text: okay -- first, the tea is terrific.  since we ALL have different taste buds {flash back to 8th grade science class with the litmus paper test, where half the class tasted bitterness and the rest tasted nothing :o) }, so people will have different reactions, obviously.  this is one of the best tasting teas--period; the ginger/pear hints are phenomenal and even the smell is incredible before the tasting experience.  having said that, you need to know if you are doing price shopping, amazon is WRONG w/the tea bag count...there are ONLY 20 bags, NOT 24; hence, it would have been cheaper @ other websites, so very disappointed...

review/summary: Really Nice Blend.  Smooth, Tasty & Satisfying.  Recommended.
review/text: Our local supermarket is phasing out their Tazo tea selection, so I'm working my way through what they have left.  On the shelf, and recommended by a fellow shopper, was Tazo's Green Ginger tea (pkg of 24 individual bags).<br /><br />Tazo describes its Green Ginger tea as "a dazzling blend with sweet, spicy ginger & a touch of pear essence", and further describes it as "its yin is smooth green tea, its yang is spicy ginger root. And to make it more interesting, there's a touch of pear essence we add for a fragrant finish.  We call that part "yow"."<br /><br />Whatever Tazo is doing with this blend, they are doing it right.  It is a really nice tea that is smooth, tasty & satisfying.  It is not harsh like a green tea can be nor is it too "fruity" or too "gingery".  I taste a mild ginger flavor but not a strong pear flavor at all (certainly not like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QXYQFK">Bigelow Organic Rooibos with Asian Pear Tea, 1.28-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RTCOZ6">Bigelow Tea Organic Rooibos Pear K-Cup For Keurig Brewers, 25-Count,  Boxes (Pack of 2)</a> which was not my favorite blend).<br /><br />Try the Tazo Green Ginger.  I hope you like it as much as I do (& as much as the stranger who recommended it to me).  I'm going back to the store before they sell out.<br /><br />Note: I normally drink my tea with milk & a spot of sugar.  I tried this blend "my way" & plain - both ways are excellent.

review/summary: My Kitties are So SO about This
review/text: About 6 months ago, my local grocer put up a Display Rack with Cheddar Delights on it. He carried three varieties: Turkey, Chicken and Whitefish Cheddar. My cats really went for the Chicken and the Whitefish, but were So So about the Turkey. They would take a taste or two of the turkey and then walk off; wheras, they would gobble down the Whitefish Cheddar and the Chicken Cheddar. So, I am reporting on how my cats' behavior indicated they felt about the Turkey Cheddar. They would prefer one of the other varieties.<br />I gave it a whirl but my kitty cats did not care for it. Sorry. Thanks for your time.

review/summary: Nice and strong, but not my favorite blend of Irish Breakfast
review/text: I love Irish Breakfast blend teas. For me, the stronger the better. I don't take my tea with with anything, no sugar or milk for me. Black teas are my coffee, and an Irish Breakfast is my morning cup of Folgers. With that said, this blend is alright. I bought quite a few boxes of it and have been drinking them every day for about a month now. I drink a LOT of tea, probably around 10-14 mugs/glasses a day. This tea I can only take about one glass of before I'm ready for something else. It's just not as good as a few others I have had. My favorite being <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NIL602">Harney & Sons Fine Teas Irish Breakfast</a>. Not too sure what the major difference is in this blend over all the others I've enjoyed, but there definitively is one. Not planning on buying any more of this kind after I've gone through the rest of the boxes.

I have been averaging 4 to 6 cups a day since I got it. If it were  the only tea I could ever get again, I would be more than happy to drink it. But I think I will order the gold blend next time, as I think the stronger flavor, would be even better.

review/text: Barry's Gold Blend was always served in our family's old farmhouse in Carracastle, County Mayo; my grandmother and great-aunts (RIP)continued the tradition when they came to NYC a hundred years ago. I started buying Gold Blend through Amazon when I could no longer find it in groceries or specialty stores; thus, I found Barry's Breakfast Tea. It is so delicious that I can close my eyes and just about smell the fragrance of peat smoke I recall so well from my many visits to the homeplace.<br />I just tried to order it via Amazon and found, much to my distress, that it is not available currently and may not be in future. I will keep searching for Barry's Breakfast, as we call it in my house, and pray that Barry's continues to manufacture it.<br />If you love tea, try Barry's Breakfast before it goes out of existence.

review/summary: Barry's Irish Breakfast Tea
review/text: Barry's Irish Breakfast Tea is one of my go-to products when I'm looking for a strong fix or attempting to introduce my friends to tea culture.<br /><br />In Appalachia, I've never encountered Barry's in any of our larger chain stores.  After trying locally available brands of breakfast tea (Twining's, PG, and Tetley) and reading up on what other drinkers prefer, the reviews for Barry's stuck out as a solid Irish favorite--bold and earthy.  At the time of this review, the price is fair when compared to widespread names like Lipton after you account for the quantity given.  It's not unusual to pay around four dollars for a twenty-bag pack of an established product, so I don't have much guilt about coughing up the twelvish dollars to cover everything including shipping when I crave this stuff.  The bite of Barry's tea is noticeably stronger than the stalwart brands present in the States, in my opinion.<br /><br />Are you new to tea?  Maybe an enthusiastic coffee person looking to branch out?  In that case, breakfast teas, and Irish blends in particular, are soon to become your friends.  Their higher caffeine content and rich taste make the transition shamelessly easy.  To prepare a nice serving, simply fill up your favorite mug with cold water according to how much tea you'd like to enjoy, throw that water in a pot, and leave it on high heat until the water just goes beyond a simmer, or begins to bubble gently (around 200 degrees F).  In the meantime, dress your mug with one tea bag per eightish ounces of liquid, then add your choices of sweetener (sugar, honey)  and/or flavoring (mint, vanilla, Chai spice).  Pour the water over the bag(s) as soon as it reaches the boiling point and allow the tea to steep for four to five minutes for a strong cup.  Again, Barry's has a pleasantly robust bitter/deep flavor that coffee drinkers will welcome.  Moreso, it's common in all tea-drinking parts of the world to cut your coffee with milk or cream; a delicious addition that also makes the brew more comforting to the stomach.<br /><br />Just right in winter or with a hearty breakfast, Barry's won't disappoint if you like a traditional yet potent tea.

review/summary: Best gluten-free cereal option
review/text: As a Canadian, once going gluten-free, my domestic options were bad. I tried out every good-looking gluten-free cereal at my grocery store (and there were a lot), and out of those, only Nature Path's Crispy Rice was good enough to eat every day. Tired of poor-tasting organic brands, my only other option was to order from the U.S.<br /><br />To my knowledge, the only low-sugar gluten-free major-brand cereals are Rice Chex and Corn Chex. I was apprehensive ordering a 14-box pack of Rice Chex without having tried the cereal, but I couldn't be happier with the taste. It's actually superior to its competitor Crispix (available in Canada but not gluten-free), since Crispix tends to stick in teeth and Chex doesn't have that problem. Crispix was already one of my favourite cereals before going gluten-free, so I rank Rice Chex among my favourite cereals even disregarding gluten-free-ness.<br /><br />Later, I was visiting the U.S. and had a chance to try Corn Chex, and it was also great, maybe even better.<br /><br />My choice to order a 14-box pack was based on shipping cost--at this volume, the shipping (while still significant) is a reasonable percentage of the price, something that isn't true of smaller packs. I wish Chex were available in Canada, given how bad the gluten-free options are here and how good the cereal is.

review/summary: Great Cereal, Great Price
review/text: It is almost ridiculous how much of this cereal we go through. Right this minute, I have 21 boxes in the house. We go through at least two boxes per week.<br /><br />We used to eat:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTIDN4">Health Valley Rice Crunch-Ems Cereal -- 14.25 oz Each / Pack of 14</a><br /><br />But when Rice Chex went Gluten Free, we switched. It's less expensive. And, while the other product is probably healthier (in terms of ingredients), the Rice Chex has the added benefit of being vitamin fortified.<br /><br />The subscribe and save price is excellent. You might be able to do better when you combine a sales price with a coupon, but then you're still buying and saving on only 2 or 3 boxes at a time.

review/summary: Not worth it. Stale.
review/text: I'd tried the aged white cheddar and loved them, so I got a twelve pack of the sour cream and onion from Amazon thinking they'd be just as good... maybe even better. (I hadn't seen the sour cream and onion in stores before.) Unfortunately all of the bags I received from Amazon were stale. (I tried three or four different bags just to be sure.) I couldn't find an expiration date on the packaging, but I also ordered another twelve pack of the aged white cheddar at the same time. It was fresh and wonderfully crisp (and cost five dollars less).

review/summary: Favorite Snack Item
review/text: This is one of my favorite snack items, and I crave them all the time but unfortunately most grocery stores around me seem to only carry the veggie and white cheddar flavor so order the sour cream & onion flavor quite often. The snack is very airy and I don't feel horrible when my boyfriend and I demolish the bag (although I tend to hog the bag) because each serving has only 130 delicious calories. The flavor is slightly different than your average sour cream & onion chip but I find myself preferring this taste over all of the others.  I am hooked and have quickly converted my friends and family to Pirate's Booty too.

review/summary: Better than I expected, nearly as pretty as the picture
review/text: The one complaint that I have with traditional Shake 'N Bake is that no matter how hard I try, or how hard my now-departed wife had tried, when either of us used Shake 'N Bake we never quite got the results shown in the picture on the box.  There'd always be spotty coverage and the bottom of the chicken or pork we had cooked would be somewhat soggy and less crispy than promised.<br /><br />Surprisingly enough, the Parmesan Shake 'N Bake seems to come much, much closer (in it's final results) to what you see on the picture on the box.<br /><br />My children love Parmesan coated pork and chicken that we've gotten at a nice restaurant we occassionally go to and I've long since grown bored with traditional Shake 'N Bake flavor.  (Barbeque doesn't work as an alternative for me as I don't much care for Barbeque flavor myself.)  I thought about finding a nice parmesan crusted recipe and actually found one online that several people seemed to think was pretty good, though my own laziness kicked in as I thought about the hassles of following that recipe and wished that there was a Shake 'N Bake variety that would offer what I was looking for.  A few seconds of internet searching later and I was rewarded with the knowledge that what I was looking for is out there.  From there, it was just a trip to a local grocer's store to find a box to take home and use.<br /><br />Now that I know that I can get this flavor from Amazon, in a fairly big package (enough to last through several meals), I'm a very happy at home chef, and my children will also be happy to consume the cooked results.<br /><br />As to the flavor and taste, it's pretty good.  Not over whelmingly cheesy, but a nice start towards a tasty flavor.  Home chefs may wish to add a little extra garlic or other Italian herbs or spices to the mix before they coat the chicken or pork (though the box shows chicken in the picture, it can be used for either chicken or pork) just to flavor to their own personal tastes, but again, what is here is a very good start.

review/text: When I first started to buy VitaGravy, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get it in their kibble every day, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it because of its beneficial nutritional value and decent price compared to a pill vitamin supplement. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of VitaGravy, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining.

I tried several and none had the wide range of flavors that is characteristic of Ship Brand without absolutely eliminating all others. Curries can take over food so that the taste of vegetables and other ingredients are completely lost. Other curries are too mild and have an uniform taste. Not so with Ship Brand. The taste is mild enough to allow other flavors to shine without being tasteless or bland.<br />I highly recommend this curry.

review/summary: Baby loves this...washing machine doesn't.
review/text: Our baby loves fruit, as a lot of babies do.  It's the vegetables that we have a hard time getting her to eat.  So we figured a mixture of tomato & carrot might be a good starting point.  It's a bit watery, but we tend to thicken our daughter's food with organic baby oatmeal or brown rice anyways.  This food just requires a bit more thickening.  The first time eating this, she did not get the bitter face look (we all know that face--when a baby eats a new taste for the first time & just doesn't know how to deal!)  She ate the entire jar at one sitting for the first try!  Not too bad if you ask me, especially since we could not get her to eat any other veggies in the past.<br /><br />We always use bibs during feeding times, but food just somehow ends up getting on the baby's clothes no matter how careful you are.  This blend is diffuclt to remove from laundry if you don't spot treat it and wash it right away.  So, just keep this in mind when feeding the baby.<br /><br />Everything else about this food is great.  Will definitely buy again!

What I like most about them is they taste very fresh and high-quality. A lot of them even smell fresh too.

While a little bit pricier than other brands, but I think it's worth it for your little precious one.  I was skeptical about this tomato and carrot blend being too tart, but so far my 7-month old loves it.

It was slow going at first, but at 6 months, she eats 8-12 ounces of baby food per day + her regular milk intake.  Carrot Tomato is her favorite.  If she isn't in the mood for something else, I always grab this as a backup and she snarfs it down.  But, my baby loves things like Apricots and Squash, so she may be a bit weird too.

review/text: Does organic baby food make a difference? I don't think anyone knows for sure. But we buy organic because it makes sense that for a smaller brain that is still developing amonuts of pesticides and other toxics that would have a neligble effect on an adult brain would have potentially a larger and more significant impact on an infant brain.<br /><br />So that is why we buy organic. This is one of the better tasting Earth's Best. Yes I do taste them. I would actually eat this one. Our 9 month old daughter likes it. It has organic carrots as the first ingrident (I will post the ingrident list directly from Earth's Best website below), good source of Vitamin A (150% RDA), and it is also one of the least expensive 12 packs of Earth's Best. Recommended.<br /><br />Organic Carrots, Water, Organic Tomato Paste, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Citric Acid.

review/summary: Great tomato blend
review/text: I am impressed with the line of antioxidant blends. Like others mentioned it is not usual to find tomato in baby foods. I was curious to see if my son would like and he loves it. I do try to avoid giving it two days in a row though becauae it makes it a little constipated. I am happy with Amazon's "grocery" business. It is great to have the convenience to order these on-line and have home delivery. I think it is a great price and I have not had any shipping issues.

review/summary: carrot tomato glop
review/text: Again, I understand why my babies wouldn't eat babyfood. But as babyfood goes, the carrot tomato blend is almost edible provided salt is added. I should mention I have no babies. I am 65 and I have just had stomach surgery. Babyfood is one of the things that is not supposed to upset my stomach. Well, I'll admit I haven't had a barfing attack after eating babyfood, but on the other hand, I find it difficult to get down a whole jar. I'm used to food that tastes like food.
