review/summary: Super crispy, light on the waistline
review/text: These chips are truly unique. Naturally colored with beet juice, they are festive and great for entertaining. They are super crisp and thin - and not greasy at all. When you first bite into them, it's almost chocking - they're totally chewable, but stronger than typical chips - so when you first bite into one, it's like you're biting into thin glass - it's almost shocking - but good nonetheless. Tasty and light.

review/summary: Good potato chip alternative
review/text: I had some of these Terra chips for the first time a few weeks ago and was honestly surprised by how good they were! I have since tried the Original, Mediterranean, and Sweets and Beets flavors. I liked them all, so I'm looking forward to trying even more of the flavors in the future. There are a variety of root vegetable chips in each bag (varies based on what flavor you buy). I like all the veggie chips I've had, though some are harder than others. Terra chips have a great texture--crunchy like regular potato chips rather than soft and chewy like most dried fruits/veggies. This makes them a great alternative to chips with more nutritional value. I really like them and enjoy having them for a snack now and then. I like the Mediterranean flavor best out of the ones I've tried so far, but they are all really good.

review/summary: Love these Chips - Beware of Sodium
review/text: I love these chips a whole lot! This is also a great deal for them on subscribe and save when I compared it to the normal price I pay per bag in the store. The chips are yummy and taste natural. Some are very crunchy and a little hard to bite so I would not recommend these for elderly individuals or people who need or prefer softer food. My only issue with these chips is that they seem a little salty. Most people I let try them kept commenting on the sodium level as well. I kinda love salt, and don't plan on giving it up too much right now, so they are great to me! The sodium is just a warning for those who are watching their intake to do their research.

review/text: We buy a ton of the Terra brand veggie chips.  We absolutely love the Zesty Tomato flavor.  It is great.  It is super nice to have a whole pack of 12 lying around to munch on.  They came fresh and as described.  I think the pricing is similar to what you can get in the grocery stores, if you can find the flavor you like.

review/text: These chips are wonderful, and come in cute little servings. I'm on a diet and find it a lot easier to moderate my consumption with smaller bags of chips. On top of that, they stay fresher, longer. The flavor is fantastic, especially if you are looking for something like potato chips but with a little more flair and flavor. Highly recommend.

review/summary: Buy in smaller batches
review/text: These chips are very, very good. They are flavorful and crispy and some have a great texture. Some, not all. Unfortunately, about half of the chips are extremely hard to the point where no one in my house will eat them. They are so hard, it's almost impossible to crunch through them! It may have been a looming expiration date (I bought 12 of the large bags about three months ago) but as I noticed each new bag having more and more hard chips, I quickly gave them all away thinking that at least someone should enjoy them before they completely go bad because there was no way I would get around to eating that many by myself. So I can't check to see if that was the problem or not but after seeing how many reviews talk about this issue, I'm thinking it's pretty prevalent.<br /><br />My suggestion would be to find a single bag to purchase because while buying in bulk tends to be cheaper, you're just wasting money if you end up throwing a bunch away because it's gone stale.<br /><br />But other than the staleness, I LOVE these chips!

review/summary: Love the Original and Mediterranean Flavor
review/text: I've been a fan of these chips for years. They have a unique combination of sweet potatoes, beets, yucca , taro, parsnips and batata which provide a different combination of crunch compared to plain old potato chips.  I notice the bags are now advertising that there is a full serving of vegetables in every ounce (I never noticed this claim before) but I wouldn't consider them that much healthier than other types of potato chips.<br /><br />What the unique combination of root vegetables do  provide is a variation of color, crunch and flavor. I'm not a fan of the hard red beets, after biting into one I've actually chipped a tooth but I do enjoy the rest.<br /><br />Mediterranean is my favorite, the flavor is outstanding as it's tangy, salty and slightly sweet.<br /><br />The Terra chips maybe junk food but they are up scale junk food with the variation of colors and "exotic" root vegetables and would fit in as perfectly as an appetizer at a social event as they do just straight out of the bag.

Their wonderful. I could do without the really soft stuff. I guess it's totally up to you to get them and try. I definitely would recommend these. I'd also buy these yucca chips in a bag all there own. That's how much I like them:)

This is my fault, and it is still a good deal, but I would be happier if they were the big bags. The snack size bags are convenient and neat though. It would also help if they did not expire so soon.

review/text: These are great chips.  I buy the 24 pack and they are wonderful for lunches.  Every bag is a bit different and there is one chip I'm not crazy about (the white chip, parsnip maybe?), but there are never that many in any bag so it doesn't bother me.  My favorite is the sweet potato and the ruby taro.  All are crispy without being hard and only slightly salty.  You get the flavor of the vegetables and not just salt and grease like some chips.  Delicious.

review/summary: 1 serving of fat, 1 serving of carbs, and 3 grams fiber :)
review/text: I absolutely love Terra chips.  I have ever since I tried them on a Jet Blue flight.  They have great vegetables that are low in carbohydrates and high in fiber.  The only downside to these is that the fat is on the high end of the scale.  Only 1 gram is saturated, but there are 9 grams total.<br /><br />They are delicious and great in moderation, but for an everyday snack I don't think so.  Something that has more than 50% of all calories derived from fat is not an everyday thing.  Maybe 1 or 2 times a week.  But if you are trying to watch your calories and want to indulge every once in a while. Great product!!!

review/text: These chips are excellent.  I bought them to supplement my weight loss diet with vegetables, however.  I agree it is hard to put them down so if you are allowed only a 150 calorie snack or veggie serving on your diet you will need to have the restraint to measure out a quarter of a 4oz bag or about an 1/8th of these bigger bags and put the rest away.  They are soooo good though it's worth the try.

These are perfect presentation wise for a get-together because of the color variety and texture; they look and taste good! I give them 5 thumbs up! Once you try them you'll be hooked too. A word to those with dentures or sensitive teeth; this may not be the chip for you because some of the chips are REALLY REALLY crunchy.

review/text: I thought this one would be better than the blue potato that I tried 3 months ago as it has better review/rating, but it turned out to be a bad one. I am not sure if it became that hard to chew just because it is expiring in 1 month, but it hurt my teeth and jaw after finishing half of the first bag. My jaw became clicking sound and I had to see my doctor after eating this. I think three forth of the chips in each bag are those hard ones. Now, the remaining became the feeding food for the squirrels. Conclusion: 2 problems: (1) those 24 bags are expiring in one month; and (2) most of the chips are too hard to bite.

review/summary: Comfort Food for those of us that grew up eating this
review/text: My family ate this tangy spaghetti when I was growing up and it's a comfort food as far as I'm concerned now, 45-50 years later.  The other review said that it was 2 - 4 servings, but I admit, when I manage to find this product I don't want to share it with anyone.  I don't know why more grocery stores don't carry this product.  My favorite part is that tangy spicy taste.  Most store bought spaghetti sauces have sugar or some other sweet flavor and I don't like them at all.  I wish that Kraft would at least sell the seasoning packets for what my family calls "hot spaghetti".

review/summary: Kraft Tangy Italian spaghetti
review/text: This is an excellent product that I have been using for years.  It has been removed from most grocery store shelves.<br />If I can't find Kraft Tangy Italian Spaghetti, I will not eat spaghetti at all.  It's the sauce mix in the box that makes the spaghetti so special.  If Kraft is going to remove the box dinners from the shelves, they should at least offer the sauce mix<br />in the spices section of the grocery store.<br />Thanks,<br />Nanna T<br />Las Vegas, NV

review/summary: Just like Mom use to make!
review/text: I will fully admit that this product is not for the discerning palet or the overly health conscious upfront but, if you are eating it you probably don't care about either because this is more of a nostalgic meal then anything else and in the right setting, it definitely has it's place. I will also be quick to say that this is one delicious "meal in a box". When I was a kid, we had this every Wednesday night served alongside Shake and Bake chicken. It was always one of my favorite meals growing up. In my adult years, I looked high and low for this product and at times found it at random only to go back to the store a few weeks later and they wouldn't carry it anymore. It is getting harder and harder to find this product in stores. My last big find was in Walmart and I bought five boxes. There was another woman there picking up three of her own - we cleaned the shelf out.<br /><br />In short, the taste is a zesty flavor that is bold and yet not sweet. Kraft really perfected something here as I have never tasted anything like it ever. I like making mine a bit on "the dry side"  by using only one can of 15oz tomato sauce ( I don't use the paste or add water) because I find that it really pulls the special flavor out even more. I do not make the sauce separate. I cook and drain the noodles then I add them, the zesty seasoning packet, the grated cheese packet and the tomato sauce all together in the pot. I mix it good while heating it on low or "1" for about six minutes, stirring the whole time. If I have italian sausage on hand, I brown that ahead of time and then add it to the mix when combining all the ingredients.<br /><br />I have never been disappointed in this meal.

review/summary: Mushy Pasta
review/text: Well, the sauce is indeed nice -not too sweet -not to spicy or acidic with a good overall flavor.<br />However, the spaghetti is a different matter. It cooks up to a mush (even with I adjusted the cooking time to fewer minutes) and has an odd flavor. I can't really describe it except for it tasted 'off', like it was spoiled or really old. I made sure it was not just that one box so I tried three of the pastas. Same.<br />I will keep the sauce, trash the spaghetti, and use my own spaghetti.<br />I will not buy it again as I have to throw away the spaghetti. Besides the sauce is not spectacular -just a pleasant flavor.

review/summary: Great stuff!
review/text: Going by the positive reviews I bought a case of this from Amazon and this is great stuff! All you need is the box and a can of tomato paste (or a can of tomato sauce) to make good spaghetti. (I also like to add 1/2 pound of browned and drained ground chuck.) It's not like "home made cooked all day" stuff but that should be understood when you buy this.<br /><br />Anyway, when I ran out of the Kraft Spaghetti, I tried other packaged sauce mixes (the last was Durkee's) and there is no comparison. I just ordered another 8 pack from Amazon. It's especially good to have on hand when you need something to cook on the spur of the moment. Give this a try. If you don't like it, mail the rest to me. I'll take care of it.:)

review/summary: Breakfast Tea that is more contemplative than explosive
review/text: Some folks believe that true "breakfast teas" have to grab you by the collar and throw you out of the front door rarin' to go.  This is not the tea for those holding this opinion.  Rather, this is a more sedate tea to brew up and then engage in contemplation as you slowly enjoy it at any time of the day--including breakfast. Its rich flavor, while not overpowering or particularly robust, just strikes the right tone at any time of the day. A couple of incidental points.  I am not sure the individual tea bag packaging is as effective as say that of Bigelow with its internal second layer of protection. Also, if you order the large shipments available on Amazon, you must give thought to where you will store such a extensive supply of tea bags.  I keep the long-term bunch in the fridge; the more immediately to-be-used in a handy cupboard in a plastic freezer bag.  This seems to work ok and keep them fresh.

It has a gentle, smooth taste and is just as wonderful alone as it is a companion to your meal.<br /><br />This particular tea, for me personally, is something of a let-down only because it is the same as Irish breakfast only weaker. It seems to me that I have to strain a bit to taste this tea. On the bright side, it is also available in decaf and aside from Irish breakfast it is the only other of the black or blend teas available in decaf.<br /><br />However, do not mistake my personal animosity for actual rejection. Twinings cannot make a bad cup, only a weak one. However, for those just finding their bearings in the world of teas, Twinings English breakfast tea is one good way to begin.<br /><br />In the event it interests you, Twinings tea bags are designed like Lipton's clever invention, the 'double' tea bag (what they originally named "FLOW-THROUGH") that you can puff apart a bit if you like before steeping it. Twinings does not have any staples anywhere on their teabags, unlike other companies with a staple here and a staple there. You might as well buy staple-flavored tea.<br /><br />For the experienced old tea-hound (here I stand) it is a matter of taste. Just know that Twinings will not steer you wrong.

My only complaint is that I can't seem to find these things locally in our grocery store. The cost of shipping was about as much as the price of the product itself.

review/text: The description of this item said "2-Count" so I expected it to have two bones.  Though the dogs enjoyed it (including some skirmishes over ownership) I think it's a bit expensive for a single bone.  Won't buy again, for sure.

review/text: My dogs love this treat and will stand at the cupboard door where they are stored begging for more.  Any of the Sergeant's Chick'n Dippin' rawhides are what they want first when it comes to rawhide treats.  Recommend this to anyone but beware, your dog will want a steady supply so make sure you buy enough to last for awhile.

review/summary: Scrumpdidlicious!
review/text: I've not tried these from Amazon, but my local store occasionally carries the M&Ms almond. They are Terrific! I don't care for peanuts, but these almond candies are absolutely wonderful. And hey, they are protein too, so they are healthy for me!<br /><br />Just like the peanut M&Ms, these almond M&Ms have a whole nut covered in a layer of chocolate with a hard candy shell. I find them most often at holidays (Wikipedia mentions Easter and Christmas) and they then come in appropriate colors. Pastels in the spring, and greens and reds at the Christmas season. Since an almond is a bigger nut than a peanut, these are slightly bigger candies than the peanut ones. They're not huge, just a bit bigger.<br /><br />And they are equally as addicting as is any other flavor of M&M! (I recently tried dark chocolate M&Ms and loved them too.)

review/summary: They Are Nuts!!!
review/text: My best friend loves Almond M & Ms.  When she lived with me for a few years, she ate them every night and day too.  For almost any reason, I would buy several bags for her and hide them all over the house for her to find.  We had such fun.  A few months ago she moved out of town.  Several weeks ago she fell while riding her bike and broke her collar bone and clavicle and cannot do much for a few months but stay home and nurse herself back to health.  So when I first heard about her accident, I went on Amazon and sent her the 4 pac of Almond M & Ms.  She was ecstatic!  I saw her this past Saturday night at a party and all she could talk about was the joy she's experiencing eating her Almond M & Ms every day while she lays on the couch recuperating.<br /><br />I cannot eat candy now because I am diabetic but I can still remember the taste of biting into an Almond M & M and smiling.  Years ago, the Peanut M & Ms captured me and I (over) ate them every day.<br /><br />Oh well.  Thanks for allowing me to write in and tell everyone else who has never tasted an Almond M & M to try them.  The bags you sell on Amazon are larger than the ones that are sold in supermarkets and a better value but you better hide them somewhere where you cannot readily reach them or...well you know the rest...LOL.

review/summary: Never knew a tea could taste this good
review/text: Its pricey, true. but after trying over a dozen other lower priced teas, and others that were only lower because of a pre purchased certificate, I decided it was less expensive just to buy what I wanted than try to save.  If I didnt think it was a good value in the long run, I would have had to go with 4 not 5 stars, no matter how much I love it.  But it earns that last star when you get down to it.  I first tasted this at a mall walking by a teavana shop.<br /><br />I was so dazed that this was a tea I was tasting...it just didnt seem real.  I didnt buy any that day, and kept hurrying to my destinatation.  Later I couldnt get it out of my head, and finally went back to be sure, and to buy it.<br /><br />then i went shopping around.  I can usually find things for waaaay below retail, without sacrificing quality.  But not with this.  I wasted a couple of hundred dollars on less expensive blends with no luck.  Eventually I found one that was a close second.  But the same was true in price... other than a prepaid half off certificate I had for that store.<br /><br />I was almost "enchanted" by the runner up.  But once I tried the Teavana again, the other just wasnt in the same district.  It was just too floral.  The teavana tea is more delicate and balanced. If I ever find a deal like that again, I'll try the other tea for use in blending with the distant third place winners.  If even the youthberry is a bit floral for you, tevana sells a lighter blended version with orange.<br /><br />But for me , by itself in the youthberry, you taste each flavor as a separate note, fruity, warm, then aromatically fragrant. I know they say taste is mostly smell.  I actually smell the roses more than taste them... Then at either the beginning or the end of the sip (or so I found, varying by whether hot or cold, may not be there at all for you) there is a brief moment when the notes make a chord or perhaps symphony.  All too short, leaving you wanting more, but at the same time, perfectly filled.<br /><br />If I sound like I'm reviewing a wine..  I have had that pleasure, and I think out of the hundreds of wines I tried, including most of the wines considered among the finest, I never enjoyed a wine more than this tea for flavor.  And at almost no calories!<br /><br />Then again, once I had to pay for the wines myself..for some reason my love for them waned. This tea is one of the few things I think is worth paying retail for.<br /><br />If you hate all things floral, including the scent of flowers, perfume etc...this isnt for you.  I dont know many who do, other than allergically.<br /><br />This is like drinking a cup of sweet fruit tea while visiting a fine florist.  sitting in a garden, or holding a rose.  But somehow it isnt girly, unless you want it to be.  I just found something totally new and different for me when I tasted it, and it was an unexpected pleasure that brought me into the tea afficiando world like never before.  I only like herbals I make myself usually.<br /><br />Oh the other two of my 4, had nothing in common with this, were just herbals I picked up to qualify for free shipping in hopes of finding something I could tolerate that had the benefit of some of the herbs within.  I actually found two I like for two things I knew I should either drink or eat, but hated the taste.<br /><br />The youthberry may have beneficial things in it.  (In fact it does, or so my herbal books say of the ingredients) but its a drink for pure pleasure.  I recently had to give up all forms of soda. diet or not, and was using tea for a flavor substitute.  It didnt really do the job, until I found this.  I like it better than the soda and dont miss it at all now.  I really only switch out from the youthberry for plain water, or something I need the benefit of, and to cleanse my taste buds to go back to this.  Leaves easily yeild two batches of water. I find that adding only about 25% as much I can stretch that to 4 or 5.  In the long run, I'm actually saving money vs soda.

review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: So, some friends said this was the best tea ever.  As a tea lover, I thought I would give it a shot.  First, the tea leaves and bits of fruit and what not, are large.  It's probably best to brew this tea loose in a small pot and strain it into a cup to let the flavors really develop.  However, for the size of the tea product the flavor was not very strong.  I have never been to a Teavana shop, but apparently they really sweeten the teas they serve.  I used a little agave for mine and I found it to be just OK.  In summary, not the best tea ever, but not bad, it certainly beats Lipton by a mile.  It's also costs a lot more than Lipton...so, there's that.  As for shipping, my products arrived quickly and safely packaged.

review/summary: A great switch to sugar-free, and tastes the same
review/text: Been trying to cut down on the sugar intake, especially in drinks, because I drink a lot of liquids for medical reasons. This is a great diversion from sugar filled drinks. It has just a hint of lemon. I actually add one cup of lemon juice (per gallon) to replace one of the cups of water and it gives it a more "tangy" flavor. It even is good to mix with some carbonated water or 7-UP over ice to give it a flavor much like Tahitian Treat (which is also hard to find). I'll continue to purchase thru Amazon.

It is concentrated so you don't need much, but add it to a slow cooker roast or stew or to a roast in the oven and you will have the family bragging about your cooking.  You can mix a tiny bit with butter or with a rub to put on turkey or chicken before roasting or after to add to the gravy--very rich flavor without being too overpowering.

review/summary: Excellent for making dashi
review/text: I bought this kombu with the idea that I would make dashi (Japanese broth) but I found it is also good for making pickled vegetables. I put cukes, daikon, raw green peppers, and anything else that I would like in a crunchy salad, in a glass jar with some sea salt, leaving it in the refrigerator. The vegetables give up their juices and soak in a brine of salt and juice.<br />  The vegetables stay crunchy and flavorful. I put them on hamburgers and in salads. Even on a cracker with some cream cheese!<br /> Shredded kombu (cut it with scissors after it has soaked a good long while in the salad) is a flavorful addition.

review/summary: Hard to review
review/text: It's just a real pain to try to review ingredients, but here goes:  I wanted to make miso soup from scratch.  This involves Kombu and Bonito flakes.  The biggest and best asian supermarket in my city is a former big neighborhood grocery store, but packed with about twice the number of goods.  I actually LOVE shopping there... unless I have to find something new and in a hurry.  By some miracle, I found the Bonito flakes.  Later, I found out that Amazon has those (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FCDB7C">Nishimoto - Dried Shaved Bonito Flakes (15 Packs in 3 Bags) - 1.56 Oz</a>) though in more quantity than I really wanted currently.  If the recipe I have is any good, I'll be back to that Amazon page.  But to make a rambling review longer, I set out to ask someone where to find Kombu.  Somewhat bizarrely, this store straddles the border between a large asian community and a large hispanic community.  Most of the staff in the asian market speaks Spanish and little English.  One stocker I knew years back gave me funny looks when I talked to him.  His English is fluent now, but he wasn't there the day I was shopping.  One other person on staff is the son of the owners and speaks fluent English and Chinese.  I finally got him to help me find the Kombu... only to find out that some other company rep stocked their japanese section for them and he had no clue if they had Kombu or where it would be if they did!  Oy vey!  Hijole! Gaisi de!<br /><br />Well, now I have my Kombu.  Thanks Amazon.<br /><br />Hasta la vista, Yinger!<br /><br />[Note to Amazon:  Chinese unicode entered in the review space broke when reaching the preview.]

review/summary: In Season?
review/text: While it seems strange to consider candy "in season," that is how holiday candy generally is.  I purchased this Autumn Mix well after Halloween, and the result was stale.  That worked, because I was melting them down for a recipe.  However, they were not very good on their own.  As is, I would rate them 3 stars.<br /><br />However, when I buy this mix locally in Fall, it is creamy and has a nice taste of honey.  It is a great product and I would rate it 4 stars, because as great as it is, it is not quite what it used to be and tastes more artificial.<br /><br />Given that I can fairly only rate what I was sent, I will rate these 3 stars, but if purchased in season, they make both a nice Fall treat and a nostalgic decoration.  If they are sold where you live, which is likely in the Fall, I suggest shopping around.  They tend to be much more expensive online.

review/summary: Poor Quality, Foreign-Made Brach's Candy
review/text: Candy was for the most part in melted and broken little bits and pieces.  I was having a hard time finding this product locally, so decided to go with this over-priced on-line merchandise. What a mistake!<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is not the first time I have purchased Brach's candy that was of poor quality (but not from this merchant).  Part of the problem may stem from where it was made: stamped on the bag was " MADE IN MEXICO."<br /><br />Thanks, Brach's for shipping American Jobs to foreign soil, so that you can make a little more profit by manufacturing a cheaper, lower quality product.  And, I'm not letting the  Merchant (Yagoozon) off the hook, for they could easily have seen the poor quality of the candy right through the clear plastic part of the bag.  Shame on the Merchant AND especially Brach's for such "Corporopathic"  behavior!

review/summary: Excellent Juice
review/text: The price of this juice varies on Amazon so I guess what the price is at the time of purchase. When it sells quite low its an excellent buy. Comes in the Ocean Spray shipping box. Its as if its being delivered to the store. Notice this product contains 5 blended juices as it isn't just cranberry as its main ingredient. Has apple with other 100% juices there also. Excellent buy when on sale.

review/summary: 100% Juice Blend - What's Not To Love?
review/text: Love it, Love it, LOVE IT!  This is a very tasty<br />100% juice blend of five different juices, including<br />grape juice, apple juice, cranberry juice, plum juice,<br />and pomegranate juice - blended just right for a taste<br />you won't be able to stay away from!  Why waste money<br />buying something that's only 30% juice (or less) and<br />packed with high fructose corn syrup when you can buy<br />this 100% juice product?  Your body will love you for<br />it, and your health will naturally improve greatly<br />because you are giving your body REAL NUTRIENTS instead<br />of just a bunch of sugars.  Throw away the unhealthy<br />sugary soft drinks that do nothing for your body,<br />and get you some 100% juice Ocean Spray! Another<br />reason to buy this is you don't have to worry about<br />letting your kids drink it.  This is good stuff -<br />the REAL DEAL, 100% juice with no added junk.

review/summary: Used For Nasal Rinse
review/text: Due to ongoing allergy issues, I use a saline solution to rinse my sinuses.  Previously, I used specially-prepared packages containing a mixture that produces a saline solution when water is added.  Those packets are relatively expensive, especially since it's primarily salt (sometimes with a little baking soda).<br /><br />Once I realized that I could simply use plain salt with water, I purchased this item.  If you plan on using it as a saline rinse, be sure to purchase the version withOUT iodine or other preservatives.  I highly recommend for this use.
