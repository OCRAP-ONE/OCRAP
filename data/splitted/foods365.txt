Today, I used PB2 instead of regular peanut butter and my smoothie tasted exactly the same!<br /><br />This is a great way to add peanut butter flavor without all the fat and calories.

review/text: I was a bit skeptical about this powdered peanut butter. When I tried it I was pleasantly surprised by it! You mix 2T of powder with 1T of water to make a paste. The texture is about the same as the texture of a natural peanut butter, and the flavor is less fatty but with a stronger peanut flavor.

review/summary: tastes great mixed into cereal or oatmeal, but a little pricey
review/text: I've always loved peanut butter and have been inclined to mix a spoonful or two into whatever I happen to be eating.  This is a great way to get that wonderful peanut butter taste without the fat, calories, and gloppiness of peanut butter.  The powder form makes it great for stirring into soups or oatmeal or sprinkling on yogurt.  I've tried it reconstituted as well, but I don't think it has quite the same consistency of peanut butter as the real stuff, so I woudn't be inclined to use this like peanut butter in a sandwich or just eat it by the spoonful.  It does impart a nice flavor though, and I don't detect any weird or chemically aroma or flavors -- it's just nice and peanutty.<br /><br />I ordered this and a version of PB2 with chocolate.  PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter and Powdered Cocoa Peanut Butter - 85% Less Fat and Calories - 6.5 Oz Each - 2 Pack.  Frankly, I couldn't tell much difference between the two.  They both have a strong peanutty flavor.  I think I will stick with just this plain version if I order it again.

review/summary: Healthy substitute for peanut butter
review/text: I just got my PB2 in the mail today, and I was very curious as to how it would taste. I was pleasantly surprised! No, it does not taste as good as peanut butter, but considering it has 85% less fat, it is pretty darn good! I'm on Weight Watchers and I'm always trying to find substitutions to stick to my points. 2 tbsp of PB2 is equal to 1 Weight Watcher's Points Plus point. 2 tbsp of full fat peanut butter is 5 points. However, 2 tbsp of PB2 does not equal 2 tbsp of peanut paste, so you have to keep that in mind. It would probably take about 3 tbsp of PB2 to get 2 full tbsp of paste. Anyways, I added 2 tbsp of PB2 to a Jell-O pudding cup (the sugar free), and it was delicious! It tasted like a Reese's Cup. I was able to add some protein and flavor to my dessert, and the entire thing was 3 points. PB2 does have a bit of a gritty consistency like protein powder, but it didn't bother me. I'm not sure I would eat this off of the spoon, but I will definitely use it in PB&J sandwiches, shakes and other recipes for peanut butter flavor.  I read somewhere that mixing it with Greek yogurt is very good as a protein-packed fruit dip.

review/summary: Great as a mix-in, not by itself
review/text: Just as so many other reviewers have stated, PB2 is absolutely wonderful in shakes! Everyone has their own kind of shakes they make and for me, it's Slim-Fast + fat-free milk + 1 tbsp of PB2 + some ice in a blender. It is a great tasting chocolate peanut butter shake! I have not used the PB2 in other similar ways. I enjoy my shake so much though, that I will continue to buy the PB2 for it.<br /><br />That being said.. I mixed it to make it just like a peanut butter- 2 tbsp of powder + 1 tbsp of water. I spread it on an English muffin (I love an English muffin with peanut butter). Unlike other reviews, I have to say, that was not pleasant at all. The consistency was fine but I'd give up peanut butter altogether before doing that again. In my opinion, it was awful tasting and even made me sick to my stomach while I was eating it and for a while after I had finished.<br /><br />Even though I disliked the PB2 prepared with water, I still give it 4 stars because it is such a great mix-in and I will continue to make my chocolate peanut butter shakes with it. I will have to keep my natural Jif peanut butter though for sandwiches until there's a truly adequate/great tasting substitute. I've seen several dieticians and they have all said it's a good idea to fit in natural peanut butter into the diet for the healthy fats, but just don't overdo it. I've lost 20 lbs and still incorporated natural peanut butter into my diet, so it can be done (again, moderation).<br /><br />Nutrition: The nutrition is also why this product is so popular! With 1.5 grams of fat, 5 grams of carbs, 2 grams of Fiber and 5 grams of Protein, this is a great choice and it is diabetic friendly. :)

review/summary: Awesome idea, but too expensive
review/text: PB is a major source of calories, so this is a pretty great idea. However, it's honestly just too expensive to purchase as a regular replacement for peanut butter. The taste is just OK: when mixed with water, it tastes vaguely like peanut butter, but it's tough to get a very similar texture. Mixed in protein shakes, though, it's absolutely great. I would buy it exclusively for that purpose if the price were a bit more reasonable.

We are used to the "natural" PB anyway, which prob has less sodium than say, regular JIF. It's really good!

Great for veggie dips. AWESOME added in at the end of a stir fry, to give a great peanut flavor and to thicken your sauce. It is outstanding some fresh udon noodles, a little black bean soy sauce, some stir fried meat and veggies (stir fried in broth, not oil), then add it at the end to thicken the broth/soy for an excellently flavoured and low fat dinner.

review/summary: Peanut Butter is back on the menu!
review/text: Peanut butter was one of the things I reluctantly gave up while I lost weight. Through diet and lots of exercise, I lost 50 pounds, and have kept it off for several years now. I thought I'd never have peanut butter again - until I saw this in the organic aisle of the grocery store. Well hello, peanut butter, welcome back! :) I love this stuff. It's like whipped peanut butter. I mix 2 tablespoons with 3/4 tablespoons of water, as I like it thick.<br /><br />Try this for breakfast:<br /><br />In a blender:<br />8 ounces of milk (I use 60 calorie original flavor almond milk)<br />1 serving size of powdered chocolate flavored carnation instant breakfast<br />1 tablespoon powdered PB2 right out of the jar<br /><br />- mix until smooth. OMG, it's like drinking a liquid Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.<br /><br />I can have peanut butter again and still fit into my skinny jeans! :)<br /><br />(PS: the amazon price has GOT to be wrong. I only paid $4.99 for a 6.5 oz jar at the grocery store the other day. Check your local grocery stores, or better yet, the Bell Plantation website where you can buy it cheaper in bulk!)

review/summary: Great Product...awful price on Amazon
review/text: Agree with other reviewers that PB2 is twice as expensive on Amazon so definitely shop around for better deals.  The texture of PB2, when mixed according to directions, is similar to natural peanut butter.  I add an extra 1-2 tsps of water to get a fluffier creamier texture and it doesn't water down the flavor.  It's not bad as a PB substitute and I really wasn't expecting it to be identical to the real thing.  The texture and mouthfeel isn't as satisfying as the real PB, but the flavor is fantastic.  It works best when used as a flavoring agent or substitute rather than eaten as simply a spoon full of PB. I will definitely buy more but from another seller that offers it at a fair price and with very reasonable shipping fees.

I am dinging them one star because their serving size is 21g or 2 tbps. I found that 21g came out a bit over 1 tbps, but it is definitely not 2! Since most people are likely buying this to watch their calories, that's a big error. You still end up with enough to comfortably cover a piece of bread.

review/summary: Misleading calorie count--lots more than 45 calories per serving!!!
review/text: I Loooove peanut better and this ersatz butter tastes pretty good to me and has 0 cholesterol. Nevertheless, because of its high calorie count and high price, I can stretch the rating to only 3 stars. Yes, the taste is good but, in order to get a 2 tablespoon serving, you need at least 6 tablespoons of the powder mixed with 3 tablespoons of water. Otherwise, 2 tablespoons of the powder mixed with 1 of water will yield only about 1.5 teaspoons of spreadable "peanut butter"-- Barely enough to coat half a slice of bread. And so...one serving (2 tablespoonsful) of the mixture ends up being 135 calories--not 45 calories which is the count for 2 tablespoons of the powder. If you're counting calories and pennies, you might as well get the regular peanut butter for less than half the price of the dry stuff.

My 15 year old son doesn't notice the difference at all when it's in a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and he doesn't seem to miss the fat.  He eats a peanut butter and jelly sandwich every day for lunch and switched to PB2 at the suggestion of a nutritionist.  He lost half a pound a week since he switched, obviously combined with an overall healthy diet.  I recommend it for kids, not sure if adults will be fooled.

review/text: I had heard quite a bit about the PB2, and being a lover of peanut butter, I thought I would try it. But, it just didn't do the trick. Taste was not what I like, though the consistency was OK. I prefer Better'n Peanut Butter.

review/summary: Not for peanut butter
review/text: Unfortunately, most of the flavor in peanut butter is in the oil (fat).  Here they remove that and then tell you to put in water to replace it.<br /><br />You won't end up with peanut butter; you end up with thin, slightly peanut-flavored 'stuff'.  Buy it but don't expect anything else.

review/summary: Good but not the real thing
review/text: I like this product because it is low in calories and it  produces a smooth PB of good quality, if you follow the instructions.<br /><br />However, it is not as tasty as any other peanut butter, especially the commercial ones such as Jiff, Skippy, etc. And it does not satiate you in the same way, since it doesn't have the fat.<br /><br />I happen to like natural PB and this one tends to resemble their taste. I will conyinue to buy it for what it is and despite the price.

review/summary: Just know what you're getting
review/text: The label says that this product is made by removing the water AND FAT from peanuts. Have you ever tried those natural peanut butters where you have to mix in the oil which floats on top? Have you ever poured off that oil and tasted what remains? Nasty like sawdust, isn't it? That's because nearly all the good peanut flavor is contained in that oil. This product doesn't have that oil, so it is hugely lacking in flavor. For those who must consume what they perceive as peanut butter, even if it has less than ten percent of real peanut butter flavor, this is the product for you, hence its rating with two stars. I very strongly suspect rating fraud for this item; I can't for a moment believe that such an overwhelming proportion of real consumers rated it so highly.<br /><br />I got to thinking about how this product must be made: Peanut oil is made by pressing peanuts under a crushing weight, then either centrifuging or injecting with water so the oil will float on top for removal. Once the oil is removed, what remains is an industrial waste product which apparently gets put into jars and labeled as "PB2" for the suckers among us (which USED to be me, but never again).

review/summary: You removed what???
review/text: You want to remove the sugar from peanut butter not the fat. And honestly this tastes bad in comparison.<br /><br />Roughly 50 percent of the fat in peanuts is monounsaturated. Unsaturated fats can help lower LDL cholesterol (the "bad" cholesterol) levels in the blood without affecting the HDL cholesterol ("good" cholesterol). Research shows that people who eat a greater percentage of monounsaturated fats lower their risk of heart disease, asthma, Alzheimer's disease, breast cancer, and even depression.<br /><br />Just buy the natural kind and avoid the additives.

review/text: I was really hoping this would be good.  Unfortunately it is not. Overall, the nutritional composition of peanuts is extremely good, with most of the peanut's fat being monounsaturated. They also provide an excellent source of protein, vitamin E, and fiber. So make your own peanut butter, or just buy the natural with no additives.

Thought this would be the way to go-not only save money on lunches, but to keep it a long time without spoilage. I couldn't wait to get my peanut butter-had the jelly and bread just a-waitin', but low and behold, when I tried to spread it on the bread-yuck-wouldn't even adhere to the knife out of the jar! Next, I tried shaking it from the jar onto the bread, but when I picked the bread up, it fell clean off. Someone suggested I put the jelly on first, but when I did that then stuck the knife into the jar, all I ended up with was a messy knife-still wouldn't spread.<br /><br />I finally gave up and just opened my mouth, put my head back and dumped the stuff directly onto my awaiting tastebuds. On the second attempt, I somehow bypassed the tastebuds and it went directly into my throat where it strangled me.<br /><br />I'd tell this story verbally, but I am now unable to speak because it ate out my vocal cords.<br /><br />So much for convenience.

Even if you come across a fleck that has not dissolved in the mix instead of a burst of yuck on your tongue you get a burst of peanut butter!  Unless it was a burst of chocolate, I cannot think of how that could be better.  I've only tried the "plain" PB2, but have the cocoa PB2 on order.  I've gone from having nothing palatable in the way of protein powders to 2 wonderful products that I found on Amazon--PB2 and Click.  Check them out!!

review/summary: A fantastic product for a Peanut Butter lover that needs to cut Calories
review/text: I had seen this on Amazon and wanted to order it but was appalled at the shipping +cost of product, but put it in my wish list cart. Later I was at the store and found a different no calorie peanut butter and took it home and tried it and found that it was chemically tasteing and i threw it out. My husband bought me PB2 as a stocking stuffer (seeing that it was on my wish list) and I tried it that day and was AMAZED at how good it was at such a low calorie count. I mixed mine with water as per the directions and ate it with a spoon it was so good. I am fully intending to give up full-fat peanut butter for this as I need to watch my calorie intake. I am going to the Bell Plantations website to order a full case. It's THAT good. I plan on adding some to my morning protein smoothies and experimenting with stir-fry....but just off the spoon and on a PB & Jelly sandwich has been so good. My husband even says it's good...and he hates ALL diet food type stuff. Just try it once....you may love it.

review/summary: Great full-fat pb substitute
review/text: If you're like me, then you LOVE peanut butter so much that you can't really keep it in the house.  The 'real' stuff is so full of fat and salt and hydrogenated oils that its yumminess comes at a pretty high cost.  PB2 is a great alternative.  It's not exactly the same taste as a commercial product, but it's close enough that when you put with the other things you would normally eat you will not notice much of a difference, and if you do, just imagine how much fat you're not eating!<br /><br />One of the great advantages of this product is that you can make it whatever consistency you want, just by altering the amount of water you add in the mixing process.  I find that makes it a very versatile product for cooking when I want to make a peanut sauce, or when I put it on apples and want it a bit thicker than the standard ratio delivers.<br /><br />Also, the fact that is has to be mixed up short circuits the spoon-to-mouth pattern that made it impossible for me to keep the 'real' stuff in the house.<br /><br />The only real down side is that because it's a powder there is no 'crunchy' version, but I suppose you could chop up peanuts and mix them in if you wanted to.

I LOVE PB, but try not to eat too much because it is so calorie dense. I like to get my healthy fats through nut butters, but some days you want to spend your calories on other foods.

review/summary: The Real Deal
review/text: I saw this in a segment on a television show about foods to try if you want to cut fat and calories. I decided to try it by first ordering a small jar. It is very easy to mix (two TB powder with one TB water) and this  makes two TB of  creamy peanut butter and is only 45 calories. (I think REAL peanut butter is about 190). I was amazed  and very pleasantly surprised with the authentic peanut butter taste and consistency. Two TB is plenty to make a sandwich or a topping for another food. I even had my husband try it, as he loves the extra chunky, fat-filled kind. His words...."not bad!" He won't be eating it, but he doesn't need to watch his waistline anyway. For someone who does, it's a great substitute.  I just ordered a large bag!

review/text: After watching a lady who lost a great deal of weight demonstrate it on Dr. Oz, I decided to try it.  I have now ordered it a couple of times, because it replaces the peanut butter I love without the fat and calories.  I use it in shakes with greek yogurt and fruit all the time.  Love it.

review/summary: Not a substitute in taste
review/text: I really wanted to like this product. I really, really did. Having to cut back on fats and sugars, this seemed an ideal product for me. However, I just can't cope with the flavor. Mixing the powder with sugar free jelly produced a water mess that seeped out the sides of my sandwich. Plus, the flavor was completely overwhelmed by the little bit of jelly I threw in, despite using two heaping tablespoons of powder. Using it on its own, mixed with water, produced a consistency that was more what I'm use to encountering with peanut butter, but again the taste was lacking. It tasted like an echo of a slightly burned roasted peanut. I'm sure the product is a great one for what it is, but I just can't see using it as a substitute for non-powdered peanut butter.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because the texture,when mixed with water, has a nice consistency, and it was very finely ground which made it easy to mix. I also think that it would be great for baking...maybe for rolling truffles in to give it a powdery hint-of-peanut coating.

review/summary: So Good why isn't it Bad???
review/text: After a couple of days to try out these 2 Peanut butter substitutes (the regular and chocolate versions) I can say I'm a convert. I LOVE peanut butter, for me it's a trigger food. If I eat it, I tend to want to eat half the jar at once and it can lead to wanting to eat other things I know I shouldn't. I've worked damn hard to shed 170lb this past year and half and indulging in PB is something I very rarely do anymore. I'd all but given it up. So actually finding something like this, which will allow me to enjoy the occasional PB&J sandwich without the feelings of guilt and remorse is a godsend!<br />The reg. version of PB2 does have a roasted peanut taste to it, so it's not quite like regular PB, you don't get the salty sweeter taste of Jiff or Skippy. JUST the roasted peanut taste. But it's quickly adapted to. And the Chocolate version (which I was more skeptical of) was even better! You can eat either one right after you mix them with water, but I think they're best when added to something else.<br />First of all I like to mix a base of reg PB2 with the chocolate version since I prefer a bit more of the nutty flavor to the chocolate. When just eating the chocolate my first thought was this would be great on whole wheat with a smear of marshmallow creme. And I don't even like marshmallow creme. But I will probably try it out one day to see if I'm right.<br />Either spread works great on fruit. I've tried apples and bananas so far. I also tried a PB&J with reduced calorie jelly and it worked very well. Good enough to replace the high calorie reg. PB&J sandwiches.<br /><br />It might sound strange but one combo I REALLY like is to scoop a bit of the powdered PB onto a fat free potato chip (I use Pringles fat free sour cream) and no there wasn't a taste clash or anything. I'm sure you could use the reg Pringles fat free, I just happen to think the sour cream ones taste better. Anyway turn the chip upside down and scoop a bit of powder into the "bowl" of the underside and eat. The salt of the chip is the first thing that hits your tongue and then the PB powered crumbs. And the combo is just....yumm!!!! Like that, it really does taste like any PB you could buy. I tried it with the chocolate version too, and there it's really like eating a peanut butter cup. And surprisingly the salty chip and powered PB isn't dry in the mouth. Quite the opposite actually. Now on the other hand, I tried adding the powdered PB2 as a topping to my skinny cow ice cream as I do on occasion like some melted PB on my ice cream, but there it DID dry out my mouth completely. Very strange. So I decided to try and mix the PB2 with water then heat it up in the microwave to see if it would melt like reg PB. It didn't. It got hot, but ended up dry like the cookie dough for peanut butter cookies where you can basically ball it up in your hands. I guess without all the fat the PB2 can't melt like standard peanut butter. So as for ice cream topping, at least so far, it hasn't worked.<br />I am looking forward to seeing what else these 2 powdered products would work with and am already planning on ordering the larger sizes as I'd like to try some baking with them too.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend them!<br /><br />Edit; Okay so it DOES work as a melted peanut butter substitute on ice cream. The key is to start with a base of water and gradually add powder to it until you get a very creamy consistency that will run off a spoon, just like melted pb *then* heat it up in the microwave. My first attempt with this method I used far too much water so be careful there. I kept adding bits of powder including the chocolate version for fear I'd use all my pb2 up. But it was so much water I couldn't thicken it up enough and decided to start over. However, rather than just throw it all out, I decided to try it out as a drink. And you know, heated up, it was like a super rich cup of cocoa....delish! Even with no added sweetener it was sweet enough. And as a plus, since it's just water you can save those calories there. Not to mention, if you're lactose intolerant like me, regular hot chocolate is out anyway.<br /><br />Now even though this stuff is 85% less than regular peanut butter it does have some calories and fat, so I wouldn't over do it. But as an occasional indulgence, I'm so happy I found this!<br /><br />PS: I just want to add since purchasing PB2 from Amazon I've found a site called "netrition.com" and I highly recommend buying food stuffs from them. Amazon is great for pretty much everything else, but they are way over priced on their food.<br />I bought the large 16oz pack of PB2 from netrition for only 7.99 per bag. the same price Amazon charges for the small 6.5oz size! They don't have free shipping like Amazon, but they only charge $4.95 flat shipping fee no matter how much you buy. So it's not bad. Maybe because I bought so much, or it was my first time ordering but they also sent me a free low cal. quick cook cake mix. They were also way WAY cheaper on PB2 peanut butter crackers and everything else I ordered from them.<br /><br />So like I said, Amazon is great for most things, but when it comes to food. Netrition is a whole lot better!

review/summary: PB2: the great (diet) equalizer
review/text: I was, at first, very skeptical about this product, wondering what peanut butter sans the fat would possibly taste like. But a friend of mine suggested it and said it was really good, so I decided to give it a try. Since I love peanut butter, PB2 is really helping me stay on my lower-fat diet, since I can use it just like "regular" peanut butter. It's great for those times, late at night, when you want a snack--just mix it up and smear it on an apple or a banana--very satisfying, and for very few calories, too!

review/text: PB2 is a GREAT product.  I love peanut butter but I don't love the fat so I never buy it.  PB2 is a powdered peanut butter to which you just add water.  You can add a little less or little more water depending on the consistency you want.  It tastes just like peanut butter but has only 45 calories for a 2 tablespoon serving.  What's not to like?

review/text: When I first tried this I was skeptical, I mean powdered anything doesn't sound too appealing. But I have to say I was pleasantly surprized by how much I really like this peanut butter. It doesn't have any "weird stuff" in it and it actually tastes like peanuts. I cant say it tastes exactly like jarred peanut butter but it is very good. At a difference of 45 calories vs 190 calories for same serving size...it's well worth it!

review/text: No, it's not peanut butter. Yes, it's an all-natural 45 calorie snack and it tastes AWESOME!<br />For everyone who's watching their calories, this is the answer. If, like me, you've been denying yourself peanut butter all this time or adhered strictly to the 2 tbs rule. Now you can eat, and then eat some more.<br />I brought this to work and had my colleagues try it. One person said he didn't like that the consistency was different from PB, which it is. All others loved it.<br />Would I rather dip my spoon into a jar of Teddy's? Of course. But since I can't I will be buying PB2 by the boat load from now on!

review/summary: PB2 terrific for Weight Watchers
review/text: I have been on Weight Watchers since June 24th of this year and have successfully lost 35 lbs. The one thing I missed was peanut butter!! It is very costly on the weight loss system that Weight Watchers established, Points Plus. When I saw it on Dr Phil's show, I was curious, ordered it and was I HAPPY. Mixing it with water, the recommended serving is 1 point, regular peanut butter can be as much as 5 points. When using sugar free jam or syrup to mix the powder in, the taste is wonderful and has the consistency of peanut butter, thanks to whom ever developed this product,for someone like myself, trying to get healthier,well this is just a blessing. I encourage anyone who is a peanut butter lover like me, and would like to have the taste without all of the fat and calories, GO FOR IT.

review/summary: Awesome product, just wish it were cheaper
review/text: It's really hard to believe how good this tastes for just 45 calories. To put that into perspective, 3 Tbsp of normal peanut butter is ~ 280 calories. The 5 grams of protein in it is just a bonus. I put it in protein shakes with a lot of other ingredients [...], and the taste still shines through and really improves the overall taste of the shake.<br /><br />The only downside to it, if there is one, is that it is pretty expensive. Even if you buy the 12 pack at $70 with prime, that still works out to almost $0.40 per serving, which is pretty steep for peanut butter. However, if you are on a diet, this is a very calorically efficient way to get some solid flavor and a few grams of decent quality protein.

review/summary: Not as tasty as regular PB, but a good low-fat substitute
review/text: I love peanut butter, and I bought this product in an effort to save some fat, while keeping the protein.  Truthfully, I don't think it's that great on its own... I mixed a little with water to make a peanut-butter-like paste, like it said, and ate it on whole-grain toast.  The flavor just isn't the same as regular peanut butter, and the texture was a little gritty.  For this, I'd rather just use a tablespoon of regular peanut butter - with such a small amount, it isn't much fat anyways.<br /><br />However, the PB2 powder is MUCH better in a protein shake or smoothie because it mixes with the other ingredients and provides that hint of peanut butter flavor.  I think it also might be alright if you made it in to a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  Either way, it is a great substitute for peanut butter, if you can get past the fact that it doesn't taste exactly the same.  I'm going to try and get used to it!

review/text: I had very high expectations once I opened the box.  There was one problem that may have affected the taste, the seal was open when I unscrewed the lid but I was hungry at the time and didn't really care.  So I mixed up some peanut butter and gave it a try.  It is truly very peanutty and the texture is somewhat strange, not quite creamy or chunky.  I find that it is best mixed with the real stuff, or when it is mixed using milk instead of water.  Overall it is a good healthy product, just not addictive like the real stuff is.

I chose to try it first as the package suggests, 2 tbs of PB2 (45 cal) with 1 tbs of water.  I found it to be thick, creamy, and very good.  It has everything I enjoy about peanut butter except for the oil.  I just love it.  The possibilities for this stuff are endless.  You can put it in shakes, yogurt, mix it with jelly or honey, anything you like.  I have tried the Walden Farms Zero Calorie version and Better N' Butter in the past, but this really makes the cut.

review/summary: Excellent low-fat peanut-butter powder.
review/text: I mixed 1T of PB2 into 2T of sugar-free preserves and made an open-face PBJ sandwich, which was lovely.  (Yes, the "contrast" of peanut butter and jelly is not the same, but the taste is really quite good.)  I have also added 1T to a CLICK protein drink (Vanilla Latte), and it was also very good.  I plant to add plain PB2 and the chocolate PB2 (which is also delish) to a banana smoothie over the next couple days.  The Thai noodle recipes on the manufacturer's web site are also very good, but, as with any other recipe, you need to play around with it a bit to find the heat/salt level that works for you.<br /><br />Unlike other reviewers, I don't find PB2 to be too salty, nor do I think it has an aftertaste of any kind.  The texture of it when mixed with water is not exactly like that of regular peanut butter, but then it wouldn't be, given that it doesn't contain any oil.<br /><br />Bottom line: I love PB2 (and chocolate PB2), and will be ordering this product again--either from the manufacturer, or Amazon.

With PB2 I was able to use the 2tbs serving for 45 calories and then add only about 1 tsp. of regular pb(as some fat is a good thing-keeps you fuller longer)and it tasted great! Would be a great addition to the diet of someone watching their weight. Though it is obviously not as delicious as regular pb-it is a smart,quality product.

It works very nicely for that: Mix with water and you've got yourself a spreadable peanut-butter that's much lower in fat and pretty satisfying.  But we've also used it a couple other ways that have been fantastic.<br /><br />Making chocolate covered peanut butter balls (Buckeyes): Use some of this instead of powdered sugar to increase the peanut flavor and reduce the oversweetness of some recipes.<br /><br />Take a teaspoon of it and add to chocolate ice cream.  It's excellent.<br /><br />This is a great product not only as a low fat peanut butter option, but also for many different desert recipes (and maybe some non-desert recipes).

review/text: Bought this under the influence of many positive reviews.  I'm sorry to say that I found this produce upalatable, unacceptable.  It manages to be both insipid and bitter, leaves a nasty aftertaste, and has none of the mouthfeel of peanut butter. I'm returning it right away.

review/summary: Powder vs. mixed
review/text: I was disappointed to discover that once mixed, the tablespoon value of end product required 3 times the quantity to make a sandwich, meaning those label values are multiplied times 3.  I might as well just eat regular peanut butter when I figured up the caloric difference and carbs and sugar.  The taste was good on toast, so I've gone back and given product an extra star for that.

review/summary: Great taste, less fat!
review/text: I was leery about buying this product, but I decided to give it a try anyway. It's great, and a lot less fat for those who would like eat to peanut butter more frequently than its natural fat content allows. It tastes like a natural peanut butter brand, not like a Skippy or Jif. I like to add 1 teaspoon of honey to it sometimes. Be aware that 1 serving of prepared PB2 is not the same amount as a TBSP of peanut butter, it is a little less.

review/summary: Really Surprised
review/text: So I ordered this upon a colleague's recommendation. I figured I would at least try it out. I was extremely surprised at how good PB2 tasted. I am a Reese's and Jif (creamy) fanatic and this is definitely yummy. I strongly recommend this if you are looking to lose weight or watch your caloric intake, while still treating yourself to foods that you enjoy!

review/summary: WAY healthier than regular peanut butter & tastes great!
review/text: This stuff is amazing.  Simply comparing the nutrition facts with any regular peanut butter immediately shows you the extreme difference in fat.  I know, I know, fat from nuts is supposedly "good fat," but you still don't want too much of any type of fat in your diet.  PB2 essentially gets rid of the fat you don't need.  As I understand it, the peanuts are crushed down and the oil is soaked out of them.  Then, the remaining powdered peanuts are packaged up with a "seasoning" of salt and sugar (the ONLY other 2 ingredients in it) and you have PB2!<br /><br />To reconstitute it, all you do is add 1 tablespoon of water to 2 tablespoons of the powdered PB2 and mix until you have peanut-butter-consistency.  It really does taste just like peanut butter.  Even my husband liked it, and he's not afraid to say something tastes nasty when it's trying to be healthy.  He loved the taste and was even happier afterwards when I showed him the back of the bottle compared to our regular peanut butter bottle.  This is especially great for any baking recipes that call for peanut butter b/c we all know how difficult it can be to make those cookies and other sweet things "healthy."

review/summary: It's good!
review/text: I never thought anything could pull me away from my Jif, but this stuff actually tastes good. Okay, it's maybe not quite as good as the big J, but for 85% less fat and calories it is well worth the slight difference.

review/summary: Totally awesome tasting super low calorie peanut butter.
review/text: Being that I am on a diet, ( As of Aug 19,2010 I have lost 94 pounds) I am always looking for good protein and low calories, fat, salt and sugar.  I learned about PB2 on a web page where I can log my calories, and exercise. I ordered my first pack direct from the factory, but then found it here on Amazon and get it faster than from the factory. PB2 is only 45 calories for the same 200 calories found in most peanut butter, and it is the same 2 tbsp serving. This is great just as a snack if you love peanut butter like I do. It comes in a powder, and you simply mix 2 Table spoons of powder with one Table spoon of water, stir until thick and enjoy how ever you want. Worth the money!

review/summary: Good quality Tulsi and nice blends
review/text: These are a nice combination of Tulsi teas.  I like the Chai the best, but the others are also fine.  The boxes make a nice little gift since they are an assortment pack.  Tulsi gently detoxifies - great for getting off of caffeine, even the level in regular black tea.

review/summary: Cardiac Tune-Up and more
review/text: Takes a little time to adjust to the taste (its not bad and becomes good in a short matter of time) but the health benefits are well worth the adjustment.  I drink the original and the flavored variety in place of artifical sweetened drinks.  I believe it lowers stress and provides benefits which are essential for this triple by-pass user.  Excellent Product.

review/summary: Four Roses Single Barrel is an extraordinary voyage.  Among the very finest bourbons.
review/text: Four Roses distillery is currently producing some of the best and most exciting bourbons in America, which may be news to you because that's a relatively recent development.  Four Roses was a venerable 19th century brand and a top seller in the US until mid-century when then current owner Seagrams decided to export the good stuff to Europe and Asia and debase the brand by only selling low end blends in the US.  That's how it was for almost 50 years.  It wasn't until 1995 when master distiller Jim Rutledge came (and ownership changed a couple of times) that the brand became something good again.  And not just good; extraordinary.<br /><br />Four Roses makes a range of special limited releases as well as their standing specialties.  Like a lot of high end bourbon distillers, they also make a single barrel version that varies from cask to cask.  But Four Roses takes it a monumental level further by actually varying the recipe used to produce the bourbon - with startling different results.  The ten different recipes Four Roses uses are described as followed on their web site:<br />From the Four Roses web site:  "Four Roses is the only Bourbon distillery that combines five proprietary yeast strains with two separate mashbills to produce 10 distinct and handcrafted Bourbon recipes, each with its own unique character, spiciness and rich fruity flavors."<br />...<br />"What the letter designations mean for the 10 recipes:<br /><br />  O = Designates produced at the Four Roses Distillery in Lawrenceburg, KY.<br />  E = The mashbill that is 75% corn, 20% rye, 5% malted barley.<br />  B = The mashbill that is 60% corn, 35% rye, 5% malted barley.<br />  S = Designates straight whiskey distillation.<br />  V/K/O/Q/F = Yeast strain used to create flavor characteristics.<br /><br />And here are the 10 recipes - along with the descriptions of flavor (and some have listings of the releases that featured that recipe:<br /><br />OBSV - Delicate Fruit, Spicy, Creamy - Four Roses Single Barrel - 100, The Mariage Collection 2008 Release, Limited Edition 2010 Barrel Strength Bourbon<br />OBSK - Rich in Spiciness, Full Body - Small Batch, 120th Anniversary<br />OBSO - Slightly Fruity, Spicy, Medium Body - Four Roses Small Batch<br />OBSQ - Floral (Rose Petal), Spicy, Medium Body - Limited Edition 2011 Barrel Strength<br />OBSF - Mint, Fruity, Spicy, Full Body<br />OESV - Delicate Fruit, Fresh, Creamy<br />OESK - Spicy, Full Body - Four Roses Small Batch, The Mariage Collection 2008 Release<br />OESO - Fruity (Red Berries), Medium Body - 40th Anniversary Barrel Strength Bourbon, Four Roses Small Batch<br />OESQ - Floral, Banana, Fresh, Medium Body - 2009 Limited Edition Barrel Strength Bourbon<br />OESF - Mint, Fruity, Full Body<br />....<br /><br />In this review I'm tasting a single barrel bottle from barrel 22-1B, warehouse BN, bottled at 53.6% using recipe OBSQ.<br /><br />In the glass it's orangy copper new penny amber colored.  The nose is sweet with honey, clover flower and the tang of grape noble rot (rancio in the cognac world).  With more time more classicly bourbon notes of toffee and leather creep in<br /><br />First entry is sugar beets with a rush of vinous rancio, white raisins, sherry notes.  Mouth feel is silky with good but not thick syrup factor.  Spicy around edge of tongue - 107.2 proof showing up.  Herbal notes proliferate in the transition to the finish: cilantro and parsley... Maybe some ivy.  As the glow fades the oak tannins join the medicinal herbal edge of bitterness and the honey and the  sherry-cognac rancio ends up feeling almost dry.  This is a sophisticated and elegant flavor profile that feels almost more like a wood aged European eau de vie than a Kentucky bourbon but inhaling as the long finish fades brings up echoes of burnt sugar, leather and tobacco conjured out the fading viney and herbal flavors so I know this is Kentucky Straight bourbon whiskey.  Just bourbon of a higher and more refined sort.<br /><br />This bourbon is so good, so different, so unique, I can't wait to try other single barrel expressions.  I'll be looking out for them.
