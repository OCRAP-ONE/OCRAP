review/summary: Garlicy with a decent kick!
review/text: I greatly enjoyed this hot sauce and can't wait to buy more. It has got a lot of strong garlic flavor in it and a pretty decent kick (nothing compared to the dave's insanity's but comparable to regular tabsco, maybe slightly less). This sauce is delicious, and I cannot believe that the earlier person threw it out. I have and would continue to choose this sauce for nachos, tacos, fajitas and chicken. Truly good to the last drop. Good addition to the hot sauce collection because it has a unique, distinct flavor!

review/text: Just tried this sauce and simply put it's terrible. How can anyone even call this a Hot Sauce? The garlic flavor is bland and watered down, there is virtually no spice, and the consistency is cream-like. I just put my full bottle in the garbage. Save your $$$.

review/summary: I Can't Believe I Almost Passed On This One!
review/text: This wasn't going to be one of the many flavored Matcha that I was going to order from Red Leaf Tea.  I mean, I love Matcha, sure, but I do not drink a lot of alcohol, and while I have enjoyed many of the various alcohol-infused flavored teas that I've tried, it just isn't a flavor that I usually go for.  So, I guess, you can consider this a "stepping outside of my comfort zone" moment.<br /><br />And I'm so glad that I did!<br /><br />This is amazingly awesome!  It is really good.  The overall flavor is remarkably smooth - and while most Matcha tends to be smooth and creamy - this tastes even smoother than most.  The flavor is more "fruity" than what I'd call "alcohol-like" but it is a very smooth fruity tone, with a very smooth brandy finish.  It is sweet and delicious.  The matcha flavor here is more reserved, with the vegetative tones that usually coat the palate being a bit more in the background rather than front notes.<br /><br />A very enjoyable Matcha - if you're on the fence about this one, I highly recommend taking the plunge and getting it.  It's really very surprisingly good.  I like it a lot.

review/summary: Like Juicy Fruit Gum! Yum yum!
review/text: Okay so for those of you hesitating thinking this is going to taste too much like something a staunch old man sitting in a ritzy Victorian library would drink, its not. Its also not like the stuff the teens would swill behind the bleachers in high school during winter football games. Wait, maybe that was just at my school. Anyway this stuff is GOOOOOD!<br /><br />Someone else said in their review it reminded them of Juicy Fruit gum and they totally hit the nail on the head with that assessment! Had this not been named "Brandy" I would have thought it was a fruit blend - not a punch like Hawaiian Punch, not even a tropical mixture, but just a really yummy sweet fruit blend of some kind. I really wish I could pick out specific fruit flavor elements to relate to you but I can't. Fruit Medley is all I can think of but there is a whipped cream like aspect to it, something that really makes you feel like you bit into some ripe juicy fruit (no pun intended) and it really does taste like that gum! This is one your kids would LOVE! Seriously if you want to get your kids or anyone in the family into matcha I would suggest this or the butterscotch matcha! Just make a latte with some milk, and some vanilla or sweet cream non dairy creamer! Add ice, stir LOVE!<br /><br />Now as for the Brandy aspect here. Its really not all that present to me. Yes I do get a SLIGHT and I mean SLIGHT alcohol effect - sort of a little twang or ting, but not really so much warming as brandy is known for.<br /><br />When I was younger, in my teens, I rode both western and equestrian, and trained horses. That was another life time ago. We would always have some brandy on us to keep warm in the winter wether out on the ranch repairing fences or preparing for a fox hunt (we did not really hunt the foxes I would have no part in that so don't worry) it was more of a Mock Hunt. LOL This matcha does bring back some fond memories of that but its not the same, and I doubt that you really could get the same result from anything but brandy itself but for all intents and purposes this is a very good flavor, a really nice experience, and one I will absolutely be ordering again! I know I say that about a lot of the matcha I have tried, and I have tried a lot of them but this along with about 5 others are THE matcha I can't be without! The "alcohol" effect is just enough for those who have had brandy to recognize but not so much that those who do not like brandy, have never had it, or should not have it, won't even notice. Its like being able to recognize any flavor, you kind of have to have experienced it before to know what it is. Without knowing what it is all you will notice is this AMAZING fruit festival in your mouth!

review/summary: The Matcha is Mine...
review/text: And the sailor said 'Brandy, you're a fine girl, what a good wife you would be..." Okay, so, that song is the only real reference to brandy I have, and that's not even the right brandy. Well, that song and the singer from the 90s...anyway. In college, one of my roommates liked to mix (cheap, horrible) brandy with her cola when she drank, and so I've had a few of those, but that's really it. I'm a whisky girl, through and through. That's what happens when you go to high school in Tennessee and college in Kentucky. But it looked interesting and I liked the brandy I've had, so I thought "why not?" If nothing else, it will be good for mixing with the apple matcha. Or the cola matcha, for when I'm having a bad day at work and need a drink but can't have one just yet. At least I can pretend. But I don't really have a flavor profile in mind when I try this matcha, so it will be an interesting experience. For instance, when I try a pineapple tea, I have in mind what I think a pineapple should taste like and I can match the tea up to that flavor profile and see how it compares. With this, I'm just shooting in the dark, though I'm sure I'll be comparing it to whisky before this review is done.<br /><br />Oh wow, this is good. This is goooood. Yes, the unnecessary "o"s were necessary. It's fruity and smooth and...yum. I don't quite know how to describe it. It's not what I was expecting out of brandy, but I don't really have any experience with brandy, so what do I know? I can almost taste a touch of alcohol, but that might just be my imagination. It does seem warming, which is odd since I'm drinking it cold. I love cold matcha and how easy it is to mix. Add water to matcha powder, whisk/froth, and go! Done! Yum. Saves me a ton of time in the mornings when I'm barely awake and trying to get ready for work.<br /><br />Anyway, yes. If this is what brandy tastes like, I need to try some as soon as possible. I think my father in law has some...it might be time to hang out with the in laws. It tastes kind of like bubble gum but...juicy fruit gum, not double bubble. Definitely one I plan to keep around.

Such a great flavor, use this for dipping and drizzle on pasta or  bruschetta.  Unless you can affort the $10 per liter, I certainly wouldn't cook with it.

review/text: I used this gluten substitute to make the best sugar cookies my kids have had since they were diagnosed.  You only use 1 part of the gluten substitute to 5 parts of gluten free flour.  My first batch I used the same amount as for xantham gum and they did not come out right, then I did the math - 20 grams substitute: 100 grams flour and realized - DUH!!! 1 part to 5 parts and tried again.  OUTSTANDING RESULTS.<br /><br />Naysayers - read the directions, do the math - and try again - you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Great problem solver
review/text: I've been using the Orgran Gluten Replacement (Gluten Free Gluten) for a couple of months and am a big fan. I'd give it 5 stars except the directions are sparse and tiny (half a dozen lines in 10 languages on a package about 6"x8"). Amazon's price is a good value and the box was used in 3 months of bi-weekly baking.<br /><br />GFG includes some commonly used substances but a couple - methylcellulose and carboxymethylcellulose- are new to home bakers (commercial bakers Ener-G and Kinnikinnick use it- among others). These improve texture and add strength with elasticity.<br /><br />So far I've done whole grain and banana breads, both with amendments. Compared to previous efforts with guar and/or xanthem alone they rose higher, had a much better crumb, and a better texture plain and toasted. The loaves had **no deflation during cooling** (the best control of this problem I've ever had here in the humid South). Slices were flexible and held together really well. Panini made with the loaves compressed properly and held together beautifully. Keeping quality was improved in both the fruited and whole grain loaves.<br /><br />The only drawback is for bakers not used to weighing ingredients, as the ratio is listed in grams not cups. Weighing isn't hard, and is much more accurate. Try it and enjoy!

review/summary: At last, something that makes non-gluten bread edible...
review/text: It is so difficult to find a decent slice of bread when you have Celiac disease. Well, that all changes now, you can have your bread and eat it too! Just use ORGRAN GLUTEN SUBSTITUTE.<br /><br />Pros:  If you have a good non-gluten bread recipe, this product will enhance the bread, giving you a more pliable slice of bread that will not break apart as you eat your sandwich. Now you can eat pizza, biscuits, scones, muffins and pasta. Yeah!<br /><br />Cons: The directions on how to use the product are not specific.  It says: "Simply add 1 part GfG (product) to 5 parts of gluten free flour..."  It gives examples that put you in the ball park of what you need.  I finally figured out that I needed to add between 1/3 to 1/2 Cup of product to my recipe.  It also doesn't mention that you should add a little more water to the batter. I added about 1/8 Cup more water. The dough was very thick and sticky, but it came out great.<br /><br />All in all, I can recommend this product whole heartedly, without reservation. It does a nice job and the added cost is only about [...] more to the bread, which is still way cheaper than commercial non-gluten bread.<br /><br />For the bread recipe that I used, go to: [...] website and use the "Really Good Sandwich Bread" recipe. Read the comments, they give really good tips to get the best loaf of non-gluten bread ever! I also used Jodi's flour mixture. It is an inexpensive blend of non-gluten flours that are easy to find. Her comments are worth their weight in gold.

review/text: The OrGran Gluten Substitute makes an incredible difference in my home baking.  I use a little bit less than the package instructions and everything holds together SO MUCH better.  My 13 year-old loves the bread I make.  I use the Pamela's Products Bread Mix and substitute one-third of a cup of the OrGran Gluten-Substitute for one-third of a cup of the bread mix and use my bread-maker.  Even though the Pamela's Product Bread mix instructions say not to use the gluten-free setting I do and it works great!  It also makes a huge difference in cookie and cake recipes.  You have to try it!

review/summary: Really good
review/text: This product works really well.<br /><br />You don't need other gums with it, it works by it's self. I like it becuase it's hard to get the right amount of guar gum into things, and then they add some other things used by commercial bakers.<br /><br />I agree that you need to do math. I put 6 ounces of rice flour, 4 ounces of potato starch and 4 ounces of tappioca into a bowl, add 2.4 ounces of this product and my baked goods come out great. I don't use it for quick breads, cookies or cakes.<br /><br />It takes the place of gluten, which is what you look for in yeast breads. So it's for yeast breads. I think it works better than xantham gum alone, and you don't have to add geletin to your breads, which lowers the cost, and the ingredient list!

review/text: When I went on the South Beach diet, it was recommended that I look for breakfast cereals which had at least 6 grams of fiber and no more than 6 grams of sugar in a serving. This is by far the best thing I have found so far. A 1/2 cup serving has 14 grams of fiber with no sugar at all and only 60 calories. It's very low fat with no cholesterol and has lots of vitamins.<br /><br />When I chop some fresh fruit into it and add some 2% milk, it provides a healthy and agreeable breakfast with less than 300 calories. Be warned, however, that it is sweetened with aspartame, so if that is a concern to you, you'll have to look elsewhere.

review/text: I received some sample teas from Bana tea company when I bought my gongfu teacup and thought this was the exact product I sampled. It was good, but not as good as I remembered the sample being. It is a good price, just not as stunning a tea as I had hoped. And yes I have followed the brewing instructions. I have purchased other teas from Bana tea company that I have enjoyed.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/24/2012<br />Not sure why but the tea does taste better than it did when it first arrived, so I am adding another star. It is good!

review/summary: Pleasant Surprise
review/text: Buying niche products on line can be challenging, but Amazon rose to the occasion. My brother in law left me with a large chunk of unknown ripe Pu-erh tea. I scoured the web when I ran out, totally convinced that I wouldn't be able to get good tea at a reasonable price. After much shopping I decided to go with this cake, as it seemed to be in the target zone of what I was looking for.<br /> Bana tea company did not disappoint! Nice packaging, the cake was fun to break apart, (After watching the youtube video)and the tea is quite tasty. I'm sipping some right now, enjoying the 5th infusion of this tasty brew. My pallet isn't sophisticated enough to describe it, but I do know what I like, and I like this tea! I'm especially enjoying the subtle differences between infusions. Some flavors leave off while others emerge. This could easily become a "Daily drinker"!<br /> Thank you Bana for your great tea selection, and the samples of other teas you include in the order. That allows me to expand my pu-erh horizons without breaking the bank!

review/text: I love this gum. It's what started my gum addiction. I use to love chewing Dubble Bubble but it contains sugar which, of course, is bad for your teeth. This gum is like the adult version of Dubble Bubble. It has a refreshing mint flavor that does not hide in the background. The bubblegum flavor is sweet but not over-powering. Unlike other sweet or fruity gums this gum actually makes your breath smell good too. It lasts for around 30 minutes and has a good texture the entire time. I have NEVER had a piece fall apart in my mouth.

review/text: I love the bubblemint flavor, however, not sure if it is just this kind or the Orbit brand, but the gum only seems to hold flavor for 5-10 minutes. Not a huge down fall as for the price it more than makes up for that. Just something that should be known if you want a stick of gum to chew for longer than that.<br /><br />I tend to chew it longer, but it does start to get a bit annoying. Great product either way, especially for the price. 4 Stars for the lack of longevity.

review/text: Cream brand cornstarch has been around forever - or near abouts.  It works as well as any cornstarch as a thickening agent.  What makes this product somewhat better than others on the market is that it is processed to a finer texture.  This enables it to dissolve better in cold liquids - very useful in cooking.  If used correctly, you will have superior results every time.  Personally, I have been cooking with Cream for nearly 40 years and never had a disappointing result - and neither will you.

I have used this concoction to jazz up green tea and the flavour blens well together; it would probably work well with white tea as well though I'm not so sure with the stronger black tea. It is good even without honey.

review/text: I have not bought A Taste of Thai Coconut Milk from Amazon but I do regularly buy it at my local grocer (when I run out though ... going to order it here!). I have tried a few brands and this one has the best smell, texture, consistency and taste hands down. I have used it to make a sort of chocolate pudding, chicken veggie curries, as an ingredient in soup, and soon to try making a sort of "whipped cream" with it. I am not a huge fan of coconut "flavor" in things but this is very smooth and tasty even nibbling out of the can!<br /><br />For me, this is a pantry staple item, it is that good and that versatile.

review/summary: Thick and creamy, YUM!
review/text: I recently moved to the country where I can no longer get fresh coconuts to open and make my own coconut milk.  Most canned coconut milks you find out there have sugar added (among other things).  Yuck!  This is just coconuts, water and guar gum (stabilizer).  That's it.  I was surprised to find this product in my local Holiday Market and decided to give it a try.  WONDERFUL!  It is thick and creamy, with a very mild (almost non-existent) coconut flavor. When first opened the top layer has a consistency exactly like whipped cream, and tastes just as yummy.  Once stirred, it has the consistency of heavy cream.  As one reviewer noted, it does not have a solid fat layer on top when you open it, but if that is what you need, you really should just get some coconut oil.  I love this product and will make it a staple in my house.

review/text: One of the recipes I like to prepare with coconut milk is chocolate mousse/pudding. To do this the coconut milk needs to have a thick solid layer on top. This brand is entirely liquid, almost  like a low fat version. Placing it in the refrigerator didn't make it more solid either. I was highly disappointed and will have to seek out a new brand to purchase.

review/text: I gave one of these to my dog several hours ago and she hasn't stopped to do anything but drink and go to the bathroom. There is probably about 2 hours worth of chewing left. She really seems to like this more than the knotted, unflavored rawhide bones I've given her, plus this one is relatively flat so she doesn't whimper trying to get her mouth around it.<br /><br />The only somewhat downside to these is that they have a bright red covering that makes some pink fragments that may or may not stain carpet... and they get very slimy and gross.<br /><br />This is a nice big bag of them that will last a very long time but since I also got some plain rawhides I think I'll save these for treats or when I really want to keep her occupied for a long time.

review/text: With a busy lifestyle and long work days, the Brothers-All-Natural fruit pouches are wonderful.  Since I started buying them by the box at Amazon, my families fruit consumption has gone way up.<br />All that's in the pouches is the fruit or the fruit with cinnamon added.<br />We like the variety pack and the cinnamon apples.

review/summary: Definitely not sour enough, but still a good value.
review/text: I must admit, I wasn't a huge fan. I mean, when something has the word "sour" in the title, it's supposed to be, well, sour. These candies are simply jelly gummies that are basically rolled in sugar. Yes, there is a very little hint of citric acid (the ingredient that is supposed to make the sugar sour tasting), but there was not enough of it added to that batch. These flavor of the jelly gummies, on the other hand, are quite fresh tasting, resembling the flavors from a variety of different fruits and berries.<br /><br />For comparison purposes, if Sour Patch Kids would be considered a "6" on a 10-point sour scale, these Sour Poppers would only be considered a "3" on the same 10-point sour scale. However, regardless of the UN-sourness of the candy, the value (price) is truly unbeatable. You will not find a lightly sour candy any cheaper (per pound) anywhere else!

review/text: I'll be honest. I thought this was like Gushers, the inside being stuffed with some delicious gooey-ness. To my surprise, the inside was just more gummy.<br /><br />That in no way makes it taste bad. This candy is still pleasantly delicious and the sourness is hitting the spot (a little more would be even better!). 2x4.5 pounds may look small in the bag, but trust me, it is a lot.

review/summary: Not the same Que Bueno it used to be.............
review/text: Crazy excited Amazon started selling this, it has become hard to find. I have been using Que Bueno Sauce since '82', But they have either changed the recipe drasticaly in the last year or 2, or Chef-Mate has it made cheaper for their label, it's orange, not creamy yellow, Not even a little spicy. I've seen it under 3 label brands, Ortega - the original (the one I used), Nestle, and Chef-Mate. This is no better than Gordon Food Service sauce at $8.00 a can. Truly disappointed, ya think with "Jalapeno" in the name, it might have had a little heat. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008CFOE5M">Chef-mate Que Bueno Sauce, Jalapeno Cheese, 106-Ounce</a>

review/summary: perfect for lunch
review/text: I can expect the same quality of sardines each time I order.  I need to add more hot sauce for my taste.  The size is perfect for putting on bread or crackers, not too big or small.  My only problem is the packaging.  Bumble Bee adds a label that makes it difficult to open the package and often leads to spills.  Since I always eat lunch in my car, it gets tricky. Due to this I took a star away from the rating.

review/summary: Not bad for a buck!
review/text: I expected three herring derrieres and I got five neatly packed medium size fishes.  It looked like one of the more pricey brands!  Also, mine were from Canada, not Poland.<br /><br />The hot sauce was hot enough to be noticeable and offset the fishiness of the sardines rather well, and yet the taste seemed balanced enough so that I know I was eating fish.  They weren't the freshest feeling or tasting the sardines I've had out of a can, but at leat they had the texture and taste of fish.  I could have eaten the can cold but I warmed up the fish in the microwave for about 12 seconds to make them even better.<br /><br />A quality product at a low price.  Nice job Bumble Bee!

review/text: My sister introduced me to these drinks when I was visiting in Colorado.  I bought every flavor and was plesently surprised that I liked them all, except for the grapefruit.  The lite bubbles are refreshing, the flavor is a nice natural flavor and does not have the fake sweetness taste. The best part is zero calories! I really liked the product and planned on stocking up when I got home.  I shopped everywhere and this product is not sold in Texas.  Thank God for Amazon.  I can order my favorite drinks and have them shipped to my home.  Otherwise I would have to wait to my next trip to Colorado where I would have loaded up my trunk so I could bring them back home with me.

Before I found Sparkling Ice, I was drinking Vitamin Water Zero, and tolerating it because it is sweetened with Stevia. I so wish that they would used Stevia in Sparkling Ice. I hate drinking the artificial sweeteners. Don't hesitate to try Sparkling Ice, you will love it!

I was afraid it was only available on the islands.<br /><br />Then, when I returned home, I found that it was available here.  I love the fact that you can order just the flavor you like and not have to deal with other ones in an assortment pack. Black Raspberry is by far the very best.  Also, these bottles are so large that it lasts me all day at work.<br /><br />A final positive thing is that Amazon delivers them to me for free!  (I am a Prime member.)

Instead of carbonated soda I now drink a concoction I make of Arizona sugar-free green tea (Arizona's green tea mix -- also available at Amazon at an excellent price) mixed with a little OJ and another fruit juice.  The "other" juice I've been adding is any flavor of Spring Water ICE I have on hand.  Recently, I bought the 15 pack of the Black Rasberry 33.8 ounce bottles and it was a terrific buy at Amazon.  I would purchase this flavor and any other flavors of ICE again at Amazon without hesitation.
