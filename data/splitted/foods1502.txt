review/summary: Good with shrimp or chicken ...
review/text: This is a very easy, tasty meal for two.  It has a significant amount of "heat," so if you don't like "spicy," you probably want to skip this.  For me, it was just about perfect.<br /><br />It comes with rice noodles and stir-fry sauce.  You add your own veggies and meat.  My favorite combination is shrimp, carrots, red bell pepper, and either snow peas or just some frozen green peas (OK, I KNOW that's not "authentically" Asian, but it tastes good ... ).  You soak the noodles for 3 minutes in hot water, stir fry the protein (shrimp, chicken, whatever) in the sauce for a minute or two, add the veggies and stir for another minute or two, then mix in the softened noodles.  Divide onto two plates, and you're ready to eat.<br /><br />This isn't too salty -- some Asian sauces taste like soy sauce with a hint of other flavorings, but not this one.  It's full of citrus flavor (mostly orange), slightly sweet, with that punch of heat.<br /><br />Will buy again!

review/text: These noodles are tasty, my family and I like them. I add sauteed vegetables and tofu for a full meal. The taste is spicy but we like it that way. The citrus flavor is better than the peanut which is too bland I think. I'll reorder it when we are out...

review/summary: in my opinion Thai Pavilion is best boxed Thai  product
review/text: I really appreciate Thai Pavilion's quality. especially when it comes to their sauces. their sauces are just not a watery paste they have real vegetables in them. open up any other thai product and just look at the sauces, I think you'll see literally that Thai Pavilion is much higher quality. taste them smell them. I think you agree with me Thai Pavilion is head and shoulders above the competition. I found this to be true with all their flavors.

review/text: For us who are Gluten free, finding good dishes without having to go totally from scratch is a bit of a challenge.  I found these on sale and bought it to try. Wow was I impressed!! Not sure what smell the other reviewer was talking about, it smells great and is perfect in it's spicyness.  I will definately be making this again.<br /><br />By the way, I added water chestnuts for crunch and it was a nice add in. I did'nt at shallots or mushrooms. I used a rotisserie chicken and carrots.

review/summary: Good, but try the Extra Fresh flavor
review/text: My two maltese really like these treats. I like the Extra Fresh flavor much better. Both of my dogs have really bad dental issues- I brush them every day but I also give them a dental bone every day. The Nutri Dents have gone in their regular rotation. My dogs are pretty small- Romeo is about 11 pounds and Juliet is roughly 9 pounds. They used to be given these mini ones, but because they are pretty aggressive chewers- I now give them the medium version after some trial and error, as these mini ones were devoured too quickly. These treats aren't super soft- but they are relatively soft when compared to other, harder dental treats we have tried. These have a really similar texture to the Greenies brand, but we like these ones much better than the Greenies. These treats smell pretty gross to me, but my pups love them. I like the smell of the Extra Fresh ones- they really smell like parsley and eucalyptus oil, which both can be found on the ingredient list of that flavor. I like that these are gluten free. I like that they have added vitamins and omegas. These ones are okay nutritionally for a treat, and the chewing action is always a good thing, but I like that the other flavor has actual ingredients that are good for dental health. Most importantly, my dogs love the taste of both of the treats. I buy these ones rarely, as I much prefer the other flavor, but these are still good treats. The only negatives I have are that these are really pricey, and they are devoured quite quickly, even by my dogs who are 12 years old and missing nearly half of their teeth. They are still much better than many other treat brands out there and I do recommend them.

review/summary: Ithing and chewing on paws
review/text: I first purchased a pack of Nutri Dent puppy chews for my Welsh Terrier when he was just a few months old. He LOVED them and they kept him busy for a while. Around the same time, he started itching and chewing on his paws incessantly and would not stop, even for a treat. Initially we thought it was the flee protection, then the shampoo, then the treats, then the peanut butter and lastly these. We continually phased each of the previous items out of his diet/lifestyle until finally we determined that the itching and scratching was related to these. We've obviously stopped giving these to him and now he rarely scratches or chews on himself. Your dog may have a different reaction to them but if he's experienceing any of the above symptoms, it may be related to these.

review/text: I'm revising my 5 Star review. My original review said "Unlike anything else you can find."<br />Sorry, I was basing my opinion on the last bottle of Dat'l Do I had lurking around. This stuff<br />is absolutely nothing like the original.<br /><br />The following is my original review.....<br /><br />"I guess I'm lucky to live near St. Augustine where this stuff is made, its very plentiful<br />down here. Got a great smoky BBQ type flavor, and this sauce is thick, almost like a paste.<br />In fact, you can use it for barbecue sauce, but the best thing I've found this to work with<br />is a can of plain Vienna Sausages and a stack of crackers. Unbelievable! Also does wonders<br />for a Bloody Mary. You will usually find a bottle of this at Firehouse Subs, goes very well<br />with roast beef.<br /><br />Datils will rate out at anywhere from 100,000 to 300,000 Scoville units, they are a relative<br />of the habanero but have a much sweeter fruitier flavor. And if you're really curious about<br />this magic stuff, every October St. Augustine celebrates this amazing culinary gift at the<br />Datil Pepper Festival at the St. Johns County Fair Grounds in St. Augustine. Great fun and<br />even better food. "Smart shoppers" should be able to find this locally. 5 Pods!"<br /><br />This is my TODAY review......THIS STUFF SUCKS!<br /><br />This great sauce has been transformed into a sickly sweet runny sauce that you might find in<br />Tabasco's Sweet n' Spicy sauce, or Tryme's Tiger Sauce. I actually don't have a clue what<br />these people in St. Augustine were thinking, cause this stuff SUCKS! Its not hot sauce, its some<br />sort of hybrid that might be good on a Chinese dish, but it wont help a can of Vienna's....trust<br />me, I know. This stuff isn't even hot enough to unplug your drains, which their previous sauce<br />WAS!<br /><br />1 Lonely Pod, pitiful!

review/text: Very little flavor.  Definitely not the salt cured jerky flavor that makes me a big fan of jerky, even turkey jerky.  This stuff even leaves an aftertaste.  No thanks, sending the rest back tonight for a refund.

review/text: I was happy to try a jerky without preservatives for my son, but this is extra extra chewy and my 13 year old won't eat it - he prefers the turkey jerky I make. I was surprised he complained about the flavoring too. Make sure this is what you want before you invest.

review/summary: actually...
review/text: I think this stuff is pretty good. I've had a few bags and have noticed that the "toughness" varies wildly from bag to bag. The thing is, just about all of the other turkey jerky I've ever had tastes amazingly fake and rubbery. This, while potentially tough, just tastes good. I used to get it at trader joe's, but they've since replaced it with their own store-label line...it's horrible. Just horrible. So now I turn to amazong...

review/text: Unlike the other reviewer, I am pleased with the texture of this product but the taste of the Original or "Natural" flavor is not pleasant. I can't quite describe the taste. It's almost a medicinal flavor. Just at the start. Once you begin chewing the taste mellows.

review/text: This is hands-down our family's favorite jerky.  It is very flavorful and peppery but not hot (original flavor).  If you like gooey jerky, you probably won't like this.  If you like jerky that doesn't leave your fingers greasy but is a touch on the dry side - try it.<br /><br />I also have to say that I love these small, convenient 1oz single size servings - they are easy to slip into a bag and make a great afternoon snack.

review/text: I really like the idea of this all natural jerky,but it's pretty difficult to get past the texture and hardness.  The flavor is OK but if you get my meaning, it's hard to get to the flavor when you feel like you're chewing on a piece of *hard* dry leather.  I got the box of 1-oz packs and it's pretty consistent among the packs.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: This may be my newest addiction, it is delicious tasting jerky and I'm glad I found it on here.  It wasn't too dry, wasn't too moist...I thought it was perfect. I want jerky to be closer to tough than soft because it takes longer to chew it. There are 80 calories in a 1 oz serving, 10 of those from fat.  550mg of sodium, 3g carbohydrate/3g of sugar and 30 mg cholesterol, 14g of protein. Ingredients exactly as listed on the package are solid turkey breast meat, worcestershire sauce (water, corn syrup, vinegar, molasses, soy sauce (water, wheat, soybean, salt), salt, caramel, spices, dehydrated garlic, dehydrated onion, tumeric, flavors), soy sauce (water, wheat, soybean, salt) liquid smoke, honey, sugar, vinegar, pepper (black), garlic powder, spices.<br />No preservatives, all natural ingredients.  I will definitely buy this again.

review/summary: What Happened???
review/text: This review is actually written in Sept of 2011. The original was a glowing review but apparently I'm not allowed to review the same product twice. Really Amazon? This jerky used to be so good and now it's the weirdest ever. The packaging that used to be so easy to open is now impossible without scissors. The jerky itself is like squares of hard rubber that are nearly impossible to chew.I bought my usual boxes of original and teriaki and the flavors were almost identical. After years of being a fan (especially my husband who doesn't eat beef)I'm so disappointed in whoever is responsible for destroying a great product. To whoever designed the new packaging....you need to go back to the drawing board. How about the original? It was perfect on all counts as it was. From 5 stars to 1. Barely.

The only downside is I can't stop eating it!

review/summary: Astronaut Jerky?
review/text: I don't know if this is naturally how turkey jerky comes or if it's just this product, but I've never had jerky this dry in my life. It's like they freeze-dried it or something! Instead of ripping a piece off with your teeth, you shatter it. I realize turkey breast meat has lower fat and a stringier, low-connective-tissue makeup, but this stuff is just not enjoyable to eat. It's too bad, too, because the actual taste is really good--spicy, savory, a hint of sweetness. But jerky should be chewy, not crumbly-hard, and my rating reflects this. Very disappointing.

review/summary: Pretty good but mixed feelings on this jerky....
review/text: The first bag my hubby and I had was very good. It was big pieces that weren't too tough and I LOVE that this jerky is nitrate free!! The second bag we ate as a snack while driving at night so we didn't see all the peppercorns in the bottom of the bag! What we thought was little pieces of jerky was actually very hot black peppercorns and we didn't have any water to wash it down! Yikes, that was painful :o( There wasn't any in the first bag we ate so I guess we will just have to be more careful in the future since the jerky isn't really uniformly packaged.

review/text: Before buying these tomatoes, I bought a bulk order of some other sun-dried tomatoes that had been treated with sulfite.  They stunk up my entire kitchen for weeks, until I finally threw them out without finishing them.  In contrast, these sulfite-free tomatoes smell and taste like nothing but tomato.  I am giving them four stars instead of five because they are so expensive-- I suppose all sun-dried tomatoes are expensive, but I hold out hope they will come down in price.

It is light and flavorful, and so good for you!  The size of each container is perfect for small families.  We never have leftovers...if there is any left after the meal, someone in the family will eat what is left straight from the bowl.<br />The packaging does have some issues with the seals breaking, but Amazon always makes it right and replaces the product if it arrives with a broken seal.  We live at altitude, and we have issues with seals breaking simply from the grocery stores (which are 1500 feet below our house) to home, so we are used to that.<br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Items as described
review/text: I ordered these for my son's birthday party. My son didn't like eating them because of the shape. The lollipops arrived in tact, none broken, and looked like the photos. I used them to decorate his cake by just sticking them in the top. It looked really nice. They tasted good, but the shape made them hard to eat as compared to a round lollipop. I used the rest of them as table decorations mixed in with the cake pops and sent them home with the other children. I was very happy with these lollipops.

review/summary: Finally!
review/text: Someone has produced bottled lime and lemon juice that taste like fresh juice! These juices are truly delicious, with none of that skunky quality of the junk you see everywhere, and can be used in baking, sauces, on fish, etc. Throw out those plastic squeeze fruits and get yourself one of these in each flavor. Keeps about a year after opening. Would make a great stocking stuffer--hopefully I'll remember that next year!

review/summary: Next best thing to fresh juice
review/text: This review is for the lemon and lime juices only; I haven't tried the others.<br /><br />I decided to give these juices a try because <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LO1A0S">Lakewood Organic Super Veggie Juice, 32-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a> was so good. I'm not disappointed.<br /><br />Bottled juice will never taste _exactly_ like fresh-squeezed, but this is as close as it's possible to come. And it's pretty danged close.<br /><br />The juice is 100% organic and not from concentrate, and each one is pure juice with nothing whatsoever added. (Again, I'm talking only about the lemon and lime juices; the carrot juice, for example, is _not_ 100% pure carrot juice but has a smidgen of lemon juice added to help preserve it.)<br /><br />I use the lemon juice in lots of things, but I got the lime juice primarily for use in Margaritas. And hoo boy, is it good. Try it with your favorite 100% agave tequila (most recipes will tell you to use blanco, but I prefer reposado), Damiana (which I prefer, but if you don't, use Cointreau or some other good triple sec), and this lime juice in proportions of approximately 3:2:1. (If that's too tart for you, either use a little less lime juice or add a schmee bit of sugar. You can also go lighter on the tequila if you like; I sometimes use proportions of 2:1.5:1 or even 2:2:1.) Forget that crushed-ice-in-a-blender mierda and serve it straight up: shake the whole mess in a cocktail shaker with ice, then strain it into a glass with a salted rim (a cocktail glass, or, less formally, an old-fashioned glass; save the so-called "margarita glasses" for prawn cocktails). Ahhhh.<br /><br />(For an even tastier Margarita, use 1.25-1.5 oz. of tequila, 1 oz. of Damiana, 0.5 oz. of this lime juice, and up to an ounce of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAX8WS">Volcano, Juice Blood Orange Org, 25.3 FO (Pack of 6)</a>.)<br /><br />The price on these things is pretty good too. After all, you get a dozen 12.5-oz. bottles of 100% pure, 100% organic juice, and each one will keep for a year or more after you open it; the rest can just be set aside somewhere cool and dark and they'll keep indefinitely. One order could last you ten weeks or ten years, depending how quickly you use it up.

review/summary: LOVE THIS STUFF!
review/text: Happened upon this in a natural store to use in place of fresh lime (that they were out of) to be used in a fresh, low-calorie margarita. As it turns out, this stuff is incredibly, deliciously perfect as a margarita base! I now make one of the best lower-calorie, mostly-organic margaritas on this earth! True, it is tart (unsweetened and virtually no calories) so if you like a sweet taste, add some sweetener (sucralose or stevia.) To let you know, this is NOT for drinking like a bottle of juice- use it sparingly as a little goes a long way.<br />my (not so now) secret lower-calorie, mostly-organic margarita recipe:<br />2 oz. of silver tequila<br />1 oz. triple sec<br />2-3 oz. Lakewood Organic Pure lime juice<br />large wedge of an orange or tangerine<br />sweetener to taste<br />fill mixing tin with ice, pour in tequila, triple sec and lime juice, squeeze wedge of orange into tin then drop wedge in tin, add sweetener- then shake very, very well. Strain contents either into glass filled with fresh ice or serve up (no ice) in a chilled martini glass. Add a thin slice of orange to garnish. Enjoy! (also may be made in frozen form via blender, use same ingredients minus the ice and orange, add frozen berries and more lime juice and a bit of water as needed to get proper consistency.)

review/text: I didn't know this product was to be used in baking, etc. I found the product in the organic tea and special water aisle. I thought the product was to be drank like the other items amongst it on the shelf. I did drink the bottle and must say, it's unique. I'm going to finish drinking what's in the bottle. I bought another one, but believe I'll pass on drinking it. I bought 2 bottles of the Pure Lemon. I'll try drinking one of Pure Lemon's but will probably also pass on the second. Simply, try them for yourself and see what you think. To sum up my comments, TART !, TART !!, TART !!!!!!!!

review/text: This blend package from this vendor I thought would be full of big chunky pieces of the thick meaty mushrooms, but it isn't that. The other blend package from the same vendor is a bit better. This had a lot of powder and ground up bits instead of big pieces. I recommend the oyster mushrooms and black trumpets from this company and the other blend over this blend. Still pretty good, and a decent price, but not a 5 star. Re-hydrate really fast, though.

review/summary: Not exceptional but not bad
review/text: My cat is about 8 years old, and up until the summer of last year, she ate Kit 'n Kaboodle exclusively. She has never had any serious health problems. I switched her to Science Diet after moving out of my parents' house because I figured it would be healthier, but honestly, I have noticed no difference in her overall appearance, behavior, and health, other than the fact that she has hairballs less frequently. That is an improvement, though, so the extra $12 per bag of food is worth something.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: The freshness seal doesn't "lock", it's flawed
review/text: I've been feeding my cats science diet for probably 3-4 years and the one thing they've had in common over time is that the reseal freshness "lock" seems to always be flawed in some way. I've used this sealing technology on lots of food and non-food containers for probably 20 years so I think the common denominator here is Science Diet. Someone at Science Diet probably needs to look at the QA results for their bags and figure out how to create a working "lock" that seals.<br /><br />I've resorted to just pouring the contents out into a large jug and feeding Sassy and Hoshi from there.

review/text: This is a great cat food and my two cats have been on Science Diet since they were kittens.  Though this is a great product, beware of the prices from the seller "Monster Pets"!!! They are charging $25 for a 7-pound bag of cat food, when you can purchase a 15-pound bag from Petco for about $30 (you get about twice as much for $5 more).  I feel this company is being dishonest to their customers... Do not waste your money buying from this particular dealer.

As of March 2012 the one they're selling (at least in the stores) has changed.  This one is not nearly as good - it's still a mild (not candy-store) cinnamon but nothing special - definitely not worth the inflated price being charged here.  They may still have a few old ones left but if you're reading this much beyond the date of this review and are looking for the old formula you want to be sure to confirm.
