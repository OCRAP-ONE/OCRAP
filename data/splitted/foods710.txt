review/summary: VERY VERY FRESH
review/text: I wish all food sellers were as honest as this seller, here "fresh" means FRESH, and the leaves will mold if you don't use or vacuum seal it, it's not vacuum sealed. Bright green leaves and give sauces a much different flavour than dried curry powder.  If you see grey leaves, don't use those, they're moldy.  It is citrusy, not limey or lemony, you have to try it to see what I mean, very subtle.

review/summary: Lovely color, great to work with
review/text: The most important thing (to me at least) is that the color of this gold is great.  It may look greenish in the bottle, but on icing or fondant it has a nice warm color, not too yellow, not brassy, just really nice.<br /><br />I also like the different effects you can get through layering.  One coat produces a pearly gold shimmer, sort of like an Art Noveau enameled brooch. 2 + coats will get you a bolder solid gold look.  It's not going to come out like polished metal, but the effect is still VERY pretty and impressive.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this paint for writing or drawing on icing or fondant (you have to stroke over it repeatedly to produce crisp lines), but it's GREAT for "highlighting" raised areas and adding a beautiful something extra.

review/summary: Is this a joke? If I could give it a 0, I would.
review/text: First of all, I am aware that this is made for the gun, however after reading the reviews I purchased it and let me say I have never been more dissapointed. In the picture the gold is brilliant, bold, and intense. When I got this product it was oily in appearance and looked like vinegar in color. I used a paintbrush as I read in a previous review. The color is a yellow, maybe a copper tone---nothing like gold. I used part of this for an anniversary cake--I had to drive to the arts and crafts store to purchase Wiltons Gold shimmer to attempt to cover this disaster. I thought $15 was pretty expensive in the first place, but after using the product I am sure it is not worth a single cent. I cannot believe how grotesque this color is. If I wanted a copper/yellow tone I would have just used edible dye---I sure would have saved the money for something else. I bake hundreds of cakes each year, and I am confident to say that this is the worst item I have ever used. Garbage. I have another bottle that should be arriving in the mail in a couple days for the silver color, I will be sending it right back and getting my money back for sure!

I'm not sure how they do it, but thanks!  And I weaned my pound-adopted cat off of hard food and she just wouldn't eat any of the grain-free, high-protein varieties until I found Wellness.  Wellness canned cat food, any of the grain-free flavors, really saved the day for me.<br /><br />My cat's favorite flavors:  Chicken, Tuna, Salmon and some of the other grain-free flavors thrown in for variety from time to time.  Those Tuna (packets, not cans) are her ultimate favorite, with Chicken a close second.  :)

review/text: I also grew up eating these in Germany (while living on a military base). And now, Haribo is the only gummy candy brand I like (they are a bit harder than other gummies, I think because of the wax coating). Anyways, the cherries are among the best and the flavor is not a typical cherry-candy flavor. However, some people do not like them because of their hardness in comparison to other gummy brands.

review/text: Each gummy candy looks like the cherries you see from the casino slots. They are bigger than the classic bear shaped (probably 3 to 4 times). Just like their gummy bear counterpart, it is tough and rubbery but not too sticky that glues your teeth. Not too sweet neither, but Just the right combination of flavors to taste.<br /><br />Haribo claims to be the biggest gummy bear manufacturer in the world (based in Germany).

review/text: This was just as disappointing as my experience with the Irish Creme.  This also tastes like a diluted version of the coffee I experienced before (and NO it has nothing to do w/the coffee/water ratio).  This one has a strange after taste.  It doesn't smell the same either.  Before when you squeezed the air from the vent, you could smell the Choc Mac.  When I did that with this one it was very faint.  I don't know if that has to do with the flavor, but there it is. That's what happened.<br /><br />For now, I'm enjoying the Cafe Altura Peruvian Dark much more than this one.

review/summary: Better quality and price than grocery store vanilla
review/text: Since the ingredients weren't printed on the Amazon listing, I contacted the manufacturer and asked before purchasing. I received a prompt, courteous, accurate reply. The ingredients are vanilla extracts and alcohol. For comparison, the ingredients in the vanilla extract we purchased at the grocery store (McCormick) were vanilla extract, water, alcohol, and corn syrup. The taste and quality of the LorAnn extract is great. It arrived very well packaged, with each individual glass bottle wrapped in bubble wrap. The product was perfectly fresh - the expiration date was about two and a half years away still. We will be using this product from now on.<br /><br />Note: At the time of this review, the product photo was incorrect on the Amazon website, but the actual product we received was correct.

It's the best tasting vanilla extract I've ever had and it's much, much cheaper per ounce than buying it at the grocery store. Since there're six in a package, share it with others works well too. I'll definitely be buying this (and other LorAnn products) again.

While they are more expensive than other bones, they are well worth it for the quality and "staying" power.

review/summary: UNHAPPY AND DISSATISFIED!!!
review/text: Where should I start?? The one truly good thing I can say is that I've been a customer of Amazon for several years, and as always their shipping was prompt and accurate, I do not in any way hold Amazon accountable for my dissatisfaction with this product. That being said, I ordered this for my parents to give as a gift to someone else. When it arrived, I was appalled!! First of all, this being the HOLIDAY season, I was shocked that this was wrapped with a light green and gold bow with BLACK ribbon, looking more like a Halloween or fall gift! Even worse was the fact that the keepsake box looked NOTHING like what was advertised. You can see that it is supposed to be a cream colored leather box, but that is not what arrived....what arrived was a black and gray fabric box with a black leather lid, and very cheaply made. There is no covering (material or otherwise on the inside) just green cardboard, and the same for the bottom. After taking inventory of the items listed to be in the box, yes, they were all there.<br /><br />Perhaps worse than the quality of the box, the wrapping, and the fact that the keepsake box is not as advertised is what occurred when I called customer service at Art of Appreciation. I politely explained that I was unhappy with the box, and that it was nothing like the picture. The customer service lady stated that sometimes they had to substitute if they ran out. (Note that nowhere does it say in the description: subject to change). Upon giving her my order number, she said she could not help me because that was Amazon's number, so I would have to deal with them.....(really??? it's still their product???) I pointed out that they had the same picture on their own site, and asked if I ordered another of the same item but through THEM, what kind of box would I receive?  She said she would check with her manager, and came back with a description of the same piece of junk I had received. I said I strongly suggest they change their picture, because I am sure they will have a lot of displeased customers. Her response was to tell me they "hadn't had time".....really?? I know of it being advertised at least 3 weeks this way, and there hasn't been time to change the pic?? Needless to say, the response about the ribbon was useless, with the response being: I understand, I wouldn't be happy with those colors either. (Gee, thanks!) There was no attempt to please me as a customer whatsoever, not even a cursory apology, I was simply told several times that she couldn't help me because Amazon bought the product from them.....not satisfactory to me, since it is their product with their name on it, and obviously came shrink-wrapped by them! Finally, I found it completely laughable (and actually had to bite my tongue) when her reasoning for not being able to help me was that due to the order number belonging to Amazon and not Art of Appreciation, she couldn't help me BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T HAVE MY NAME OR ADDRESS!!! I had to bite my tongue to not respond: get a pen and paper if it's not too much trouble, because I'm fairly certain that "I" CAN GIVE YOU MY NAME AND ADDRESS....the only reason I did not, was because it was very apparent that she was not willing to help. At this time it has been over two days since that phone call, as you can see for yourself.....they are STILL advertising an INCORRECT PICTURE.<br /><br />The ONLY reason I did not contact Amazon to return this was because my parents did not have the desire to fool around with shipping it back and shopping for another gift. However I am quite certain that if I had, Amazon would have been much more helpful to deal with.

review/summary: A healthy cereal that tastes good? I didn't know that was possible!
review/text: Rarely am I an advocate for eating healthy foods. You'll often find me devouring a whole pizza by myself or inhaling several pounds of meat at the local Famous Daves. And when it comes cereal, the whole "healthy" section just seems like wasted space to me. I'd sooner eat 2 or 3 boxes of Lucky Charms in a week over a box of Total. All this was true until I was introduced to a fine creation known as Honey Bunches of Oats w/ Strawberries.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong. Honey Bunches of Oats w/ Strawberries hasn't changed my opinons on healthy cereals. In fact, original Honey Bunches of Oats is nothing more than some corn flakes and oat clusters that taste completely unoriginal. And unoriginallity really doesn't taste so great. Enter strawberries. Those old corn flakes and oat clusters remain here but added in are strawberries. Now, you're probably thinking the same as I did when I first saw the box. "Uhh, probably just some crappy strawberry flavoring smeared on the flakes..." This is not the case. Included in this cereal are REAL dried strawberry slices. Whoever thought of putting them inside the cereal should be given medal. They take the cereal from space-wasting-unoriginal-tasting trash to something that actually tastes GOOD... and it's healthy! The only downside to this cereal is that it's not as resilient when soaked in milk as other cereals. It will get soggy if you don't eat fast enough, but that's never really a problem for me.<br /><br />If you are a diehard fan of tooth rotting, chest pain inducing cereals, such as myself, you could definitely try this out. I did and I'm not ashamed to say that Honey Bunches of Oats w/ Strawberries has become part of my regular cereal lineup.

review/summary: Taste Over Ingredients
review/text: Both of my cats could care less about ingredients because "junk" food seems to rule the day - taste over ingredients matters. I do not like to alter their diet, but if I'm lucky enough to find a good pet food offering both taste AND ingredients I'll stick with it, regardless of cost. Changing formulas is routine, but I seldom radically alter their diet. This is a big advantage as I've found that not all premium formulas work; there's no real correlation between cost and taste; I have tossed a lot of "premium" formulas.<br /><br />I have 2 healthy, adult cats, and they are both "finicky" eaters. Not only do they like Merrick, but I am thankful that my guys like something with healthy ingredients.

review/summary: Won't makes cats sick, gives them shiny coats.
review/text: Cats are like children; they will pick the tasty junk that makes them throw up over the tasteless good stuff that makes their coats shiny. They refuse to eat any wet canned flavor of this brand, much like a child will refuse to eat brussels sprouts. Unfortunately unlike children you can't force-feed or bribe a cat.<br /><br />Cats, fortunately, are not as picky about cereal as they are wet food. This is on par with Wellness dry food, but had the benefit of not crumbling into powder. We feed ours this cereal with wet food from Wellness & Natural Balance.<br /><br />Remember; cats are carnivores; they cannot digest corn, wheat, tapioca, fruit, or vegetables (except seaweed & grass); all of that stuff is filler that just makes them poop more & has negative effects on their digestive tracts.

review/text: I used to order these directly from Think Products and they were consistently chewy and fresh.  Sometimes at health food stores they can be dry and tough and somewhat flavorless.  The first Amazon order I got was dry, gross, and a total waste of money.  I told Think Products and they never responded.  The second order was excellent, tender, chocolatey, and chewy.  The third order was not as fresh tasting.  I love these bars and the fact that I can eat something that tastes like candy but is full of protein and has no sugar or questionable sugar substitutes, but the inconsistency of the batches is disconcerting.  For the price, they should always be moist and fresh, not chalky.

When I saw that Amazon was selling them at a much better price, I jumped at the opportunity.<br /><br />However when we received the delivery, they had been left on our doorstep in the heat of the day, and something 'spoiled' or affected the external chocolate coating on each bar.  Instead of being dark brown, they were a light tan color and had an off/stale taste.<br /><br />I'm not really sure if the problem was due to being left out on our front porch for several hours or if something happened in the warehouse or during the delivery -- in any case, we won't be mail-ordering these bars again.

So I understand that just because these are sugar free doesn't mean I can binge on them. That said, I really like these bars, and appreciate the simple  sugar alternative. I have tried other favors of think thin but these are by far my favorite (the chocolate dipped nuts bar comes a close second). The other think thin bars have a fake sweet taste to them...these are not cloyingly sweet. I have a sweet tooth but I do not like foods that are too sweet, it you know what I mean. Don't expect the taste of real brownies ( the ones that have loads of sugar and fat), expect a protein bar and you might be happy.. I'm  hooked on to these.

review/summary: Not as good as the chocolate fudge
review/text: I really enjoy the thinkThin chocolate fudge bars, so I thought I would give the brownie crunch a try.  I will just double up on my orders of the chocolate fudge from now on, because these brownie crunch bars are not good.  Instead of brownie taste, they have the horrible taste that you would expect from a protein or diet bar.  I also need a big glass of water just to get the bars down.  So far I recommend the chocolate fudge bars and think you should skip the brownie crunch and white chocolate thinkThin bars.

review/summary: OK
review/text: These taste ok, however there is an artificial taste to them.  I like that they have 20 grams of protein, which is made up of calcium caseinate (which digests more slowly), whey protien isolate (a pure form of protien) and soy protien isolate.  The bar has no sugars, but does have 12 grams of sugar alcohols which can cause GI distress in some.  It also has a lot of glycerin (second in the ingredient list).  Because of the high protien content, the bars are filling.  I'll keep looking for a better tasting bar - I like the Quest Bars.

review/summary: Skip These Bars
review/text: I love the convenience of having nutritional bars around the house for quick meals. A good bar is filling, has a reasonable calorie count, is nutrient dense, and tasty. Unfortunately, ThinkThin didn't fulfill any of these requirements. These bars are very heavy, both in their texture, weight and taste. These bars 'chocolate' flavoring tastes artificial and unrealistic and leaves a waxy aftertaste. Although they do give a whopping dose of protein, they left me feeling hungry not long after eating. The generous portion size and high protein content alone just don't justify an repeat purchase.

review/summary: favorite protein bar
review/text: I love the thinkThin bars because they are high in protein (20g) and very low in sugar (0g) which almost every other protein bar cannot say. They do use an artificial sweetener which some people are averse to, but I don't mind them. These taste great and are an awesome snack! Highly recommend, especially the brownie crunch.

review/summary: I loved them so much but then got sSOOO sick of them
review/text: hmmmmm soo it started out with OMG I cant live without these-- there was a month I was extremely busy with school so I went through 4 of these  a day... all of a sudden though I just didnt want to eat them, I am really not sure what happened. I gave it a last try today, but it makes me so nauseous to even put it in my mouth.. I actually bought so many from whole foods that I still have two boxes of them left and I m gonna return them today...I think too much of anything can make you sick of it. I still gave it 4 stars coz I went through 2 boxes raving about it, but didnt bother reviewing it at the time..<br />I tried all flavors-- strawberry was my favorite.. then at the time I also liked chocolate fudge and the white one.. brownie is ok. I think the taste is soooo sweet its starting to gross me out, and I it has maliltol in it, so as soon as I eat it, I have to go to the restroom, not good for when I have exams- The fact that it has an extremely sweet taste is weird... and I looked up maliltol it has a really high glycemic index. Anyway the bar is fULL of nutrients, you can't go wrong with them if you are into fitness and you just want to satisfy your sweet tooth once in a while, as long as you dont get GI discomfort.  Just dont go overboard, or you might have a reaction like me. But for me personally thats with just everything, too much of anything, I just get really bored.. even too much of certain people...talk about being a gemini..

review/text: The brownie one tastes good. The problem is the severe GI "discomfort" (to be polite) that follows a few hours later.  I know it wasn't coincidence because I tried it 3 different times on random days when I felt fine otherwise.  Ex-lax doesn't work as well or as fast as these!  Have a thinkThin bar, grab a full magazine rack, and head to the head for some good quality time on the toilet.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Don't Order These in Summer
review/text: I just ordered these, and like a number of other reviewers have said, these bars may arrive fresh, or they may not.  I also got a box that had that whitish coating on it.  I assume it's being delivered in the heat and the coating melting and then cooling.  As far as the taste goes, the bars are above average when it comes to protein bars.  I eat a protein bar daily, and look for ones that are high protein, low carb, with moderate calories and fat.  These bars fit that bill, and are quite tasty, but not looking fresh is off-putting.  I'll try ordering these again when the weather cools, otherwise, I'll just look for a local sale.

review/summary: Love the product, but not too great shipped from Amazon
review/text: I Like the ThinkThin products and had good luck with a shipment of the peanut butter ones, but these brownie crunch ones arrived in poor condition. From my best guess it looks like they were stored someplace that was hot enough for their chocolate coating to melt. Each one is splotched with white, the chocolate is brittle and flakes off immediately and bears imprints of the outer wrapper, exactly as if they had melted and then re-solidified. They need to be stored someplace much cooler. They tasted fine, but were a huge mess and very unappealing to look at.

review/summary: Quite Delicious
review/text: These didn't taste like I was eating a brownie but I never expected it to. The chocolate does have a bit of that 'healthy' flavor that's familiar in meal replacement/drink mix products. There is a bit of real chocolate taste to it and the texture is satisfying. The bar has a chewy and slightly crunchy consistency. I love that it requires a bit of chewing and has a good enough flavor to enjoy it.<br />I wouldn't consider this a 'snack' though. At 230 calories a bar, it's probably a meal for any one watching their weight, or like me, trying to lose weight. These go great with a hot cup of coffee in the morning or a cold glass of water for lunch.<br />I do feel full for 2-3 hours after eating one of these, sometimes longer.<br />I was a bit disappointed that this 'No Sugar' product had 25 carbs. There is 20 grams of protein to help even it out but only 2 grams of fiber. It'd be nice if these had some extra fiber to them or simply less 'sugar substitute'. I would say as a rough average there's about 17 net carbs per bar. Not bad but I was expecting less, I suppose many people subtract all the sugar alcohols from the total carbs however, maltitol is awfully close to sugar, so I don't feel that would be accurate.<br /><br />I enjoy the flavor of these and will probably keep them in rotation since they do have a nice price compared to other meal bars.<br />I hope ThinkThin expands their flavors, I would love to see what they could do with tropical flavors. Like coconut. (Their lemon one is on my must try list.)<br />Definitely a product I can recommend, for those who like chocolate.<br /><br />--Mine came with an expiration date 11 months away and seemed fresh. I didn't experience any discoloration on them or have any stale bars. I don't know if Amazon/ThinkThin has solved the issue or it's a luck of the draw type thing, though.--

review/text: These bars are tasty. They don't really taste like a brownie to me but are certainly chocolatey and yummy. They have a good amount of protein in them and are a good afternoon snack. If you are trying to gain muscle mass they aren't the best thing to have after a workout as they contain almost no carbs and for those of you who know about proper nutrition you will know how important it is to have carbs after a workout. All in all though a good bar and will buy again.

Other times, I use it as a nice pick-me-up  (1/2 a bar (between meals.) I never feel deprived - it's just good stuff. I have never gained an ounce because of My Bars.  How can you beat that!<br /><br />Also, if I have a problem with my shipment, the folks at Amazon are very responsive.

review/text: I get these bars from a local store when I can, but I ordered a box recently from Amazon and found the same thing many reviewers have... the entire batch was "bloomed," meaning the chocolate had turned white.

review/text: This is my "go to" quick meal with lots of protein, no sugar, no gluten that keeps me full and satisfied for hours.  When I need a meal and don't have time to prepare, I can grab one of these bars and know that I am not putting junk or lots of sugar into my body.  I've checked other bars and most are loaded with sugar and whether it's organic or not, it's still sugar.  My husband is diabetic and has to have protein with every meal, so these are great for him, too.  We like many of the flavors, so it's just a matter of finding the one that appeals to you.  A small piece is great as a chocolately snack, without the guilt.
