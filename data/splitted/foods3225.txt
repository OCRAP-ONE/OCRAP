review/summary: Iranian Style?
review/text: I purchased several different saffron's from Amazon and a local store to taste and sample.  This was of interest because it stated it was Iranian.  Having read that Iranian saffron was of the best in the world I was intrigued.  However, when received the label stated "Iranian Style". This was disconcerting. This is quoted from the product description:  "You will get about 500 saffron threads with this one gram purchase. We are known throughout Florida and the USA to have some of the finest quality Iranian saffron around! Since it is illegal to import saffron from Iran to America we have worked hard to source some of the finest Iranian style saffron from the nutrient dense lands of New Zealand, France & Greece."  Unfortunately I had not read this prior to ordering.  If it is not Iranian, why say it is?  Or at a minimum be consistent in the representations.<br /><br />To be fair I would say that it is good saffron, at least based on my limited saffron expertise, and compares favorably to the others I had ordered.  I am cooking with it and also taking it as a supplement having read of the clinical study proving saffron's efficacy in treating depression compares favorably to a leading pharmaceutical.<br /><br />Nevertheless there is a feeling of unease about the transaction which I thought to share.

review/summary: The Good Stuff
review/text: If you like habanero. No, if you crave the aroma and flavor of habanero...this is the good stuff.  I have a collection of habanero sauces and seasonings, but this is always the first on I reach for.  If you want to prove that you can endure the heat of habanero, this will do that too.  But it's really about the flavor and aroma, and this one is superior.

review/summary: Amazing!!!
review/text: I can't believe there are only two reviews for this product.<br /><br />This pizza crust is simply amazing.  I made one pizza according to package directions (it makes 2 large crusts) and with the left over dough I made some pizza rolls for the kids and a calzone for my husband.  You can roll this out with ease, fill it, seal it etc.  The kids loved the pizza rolls, my husband raved over the crispiness of the crust on his calzone and my pizza was perfect.<br /><br />Includes the yeast packet and xanthan gum.  Requires egg, oil, water, cider vinegar, and sugar (which is optional).  Easy to make, easy to roll, very tasty.

review/summary: Best GF pizza crust mix yet!
review/text: This is the best gluten free pizza crust mix I've tried yet, and I've tried a few others.  My husband eats gluten free because I must, so he is always very vocal on letting me know if a gluten free product is thumbs up or thumbs down--and he really likes this one.  Not at all gritty, no funny tastes (which is his complaint on some of the gluten free breads).  We make one cookie sheet size pizza from one package of this mix.  I've never been a big fan of commercial pizza, but homemade with this mix and my favorite toppings is such a treat!

review/summary: Best Gluten Free Pizza Crust!
review/text: This crust is so good that none of my friends were able to tell the difference between this and crust made with wheat flour.  I have literally tried everything out there, and this is hands down the best, easiest way to have delicious gluten free pizza.  I usually mix mine in the food processor, instead of the stand mixer, and you get a very soft dough. I have been gently rolling it out on a greased cookie sheet and then flipping it onto a pre-heated pizza stone.  That way the crust browns nicely and totally looks like regular pizza. Each bag makes 2 thin crust pizzas, which perfectly feeds myself and my 4 kids (8 & under) with a bit left over for lunch the next day.<br /><br />I am so grateful to be able to eat pizza again--it is one of the things I missed terribly after going gluten free.  Try this crust, you will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Good Pizza Crust
review/text: This pizza crust is easy to make and has a good taste.  If you prefer a softer type crust, you do not need to bake the crust before adding sauce and toppings.  Instead, after letting it rest for 15-30 minutes, add your sauce and toppings and bake at 350 for 25-30 minutes.  Turns out great and both my husband and I think it tastes better this way, a little less chewy.

review/text: Gluten Free Pizza has been a real disaster for me.  I have tried many mixes as well as making my own.  None was very good.  However, I found this mix and Mama Mia!  This mix is excellent.  I actually reordered so I wouldn't run out and then purchased a couple other things of "Mama's" to try.  I would highly recommend this product. I made some garlic bread sticks and they were wonderful as well.  I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone and will purchase more for myself.

review/summary: Seriously..
review/text: I had previously bought King Arthur Pizza Crust mix, and that one was sticky, time consuming--but it was delicious! I decided to try GFM'a since I am a fan of the flour mixes. I am soo disappointed in this pizza crust mix. I am currently waiting for this pizza to finish---its been in there 35 minutes longer, at this point. Made a thick crust one, as that is what my son prefers. Followed directions to a "T"--I do think the dough is a lot easier to work with, as it is not as sticky as King Arthurs'..but I did do a small taste test, and it tastes blahhh. The flavor is off and I am so far unimpressed. I thought that by all the glowing reviews, it would be great---but sadly..no. I cancelled the subscribe and save for this one, KA may be more expensive, but at least it tastes awesome! I will do an updated review once I can finally finish cooking this pizza.

review/summary: DarnGoodCrust
review/text: Mama's Gluten free Pizza crust mix is the best I have tried. I have been using if for years now. Why? you ask.  Well let me tell you.  This product has a good flavor and a nice bite to it.  There isn't a funny after taste that some other products have, and it isn't grainy.  You can make it crisp thin or have a fat, chewy crust. I like to omit the egg, but have followed the recipe as directed with great results. I have split the recipe by using my own scale to half the mix and yeast pack, (also halving the other ingredients) , so as to make it stretch two pizza nights vs making it all up at once. The crust, once made, also freezes well (not longer than two weeks), but I have very limited freezer space for now. Now remember, gentle reader, that this doesn't contain gluten ingredients so it won't taste just like wheat flour crusts.  However if you are in need of something that works as a good substitute, I think this product can help you through.

review/summary: Best gluten free pizza crust!
review/text: I have been gluten free for a year now, and the only things I've found hard to replace are bread, crackers, and pizza crust--until now!  I'm still searching for the perfect bread and crackers, but Mama's Pizza Crust is a great substitution for gluten pizza.  I've tried many others from homemade to frozen to restaurants, and none have come close.  The real test is my family, and they love it too, which has made pizza night so much easier now that I don't have to make two kinds of pizza.  I have found that I can get three crusts out of a package (they are thin, but not too thin), and I freeze what I don't need after the initial baking, which makes the next pizza that much easier to make--just thaw and add toppings.  FYI--I also love the Boboli sauce on this crust.  Not to sound over-zealous, but try it, and you won't be disappointed!

The dough is light, not grainy, not tough, easy to cut, very smooth dough, and it tastes wonderful - now we don't have to give up good taste just because it's gluten-free! No one would ever guess it's gluten-free. It was easy to make. I baked both crusts and froze one for later. This is the only pizza crust mix we will be purchasing in the future.

review/summary: Healthy but Unappetizing
review/text: I suppose I should preface this by saying that I normally dislike stevia (the sweetener used in this drink).<br /><br />I am giving this 5 stars for being healthy and detoxing, but 1 star for taste (averages out to be 3 stars). It is basically diluted apple cider vinegar sweetened with stevia. There isn't enough ginger. I think if there were more ginger and/or lemon juice (it doesn't have lemon now) it would be much better. And I really wish they had sweetened it with something aside from stevia - honey maybe, or agave. I think I would prefer to just take a shot of ACV rather than drag out the experience into a 16 ounce bottle.<br /><br />On the plus side, it made my stomach feel much better within about 30 minutes (I'd been having a bloaty day).<br /><br />I would actually consider buying this again, even though the taste is quite poor, because I know that it's detoxing and it helps my stomach.<br /><br />Bragg's: PLEASE make another version of this with a different sweetener! Thanks :)

review/text: My husband and I thought we'd try going "green" with our litter and after trying natural, flushable, non-clumping litters, we finally got fed up!  They got stuck in our cat's fur, didn't fight the odor, and didn't absorb urine as we'd hoped.  Fresh Step is still the best at clumping, trapping odor, and minimizing the amount of litter tracked all over our house.  In the end, we went back to Fresh Step and decided to be more environmentally conscious by paying more attention to how much we use in the litter box.  Even over other brands of clay litters I prefer this one.

review/text: I really tried putting off getting any cats right now b/c I loathe litter box duty.  But my six-year-old put on the charm and convinced me to get a kitten last week...  Before we even looked for the kitty, I was shopping for the right litter box and litter!<br /><br />I have to say that so far, this has really impressed me.  We have an enclosed litter box, so that helps...but honestly, I have not noticed one single odor problem since we finally convinced Miss Sookie to actually USE the box!!  Hahaha...  Seriously, the litter itself smells great, and then it seems to totally neutralize the odors right away.  We might smell it as soon as she does it, but the smell is gone in no time.  We changed the litter out yesterday because I had only put a small amount in the box and I wanted to start fresh before I put the right amount in.  It didn't "need" to be changed yet...<br /><br />We'll see how it goes, but I think this is a winner... :-)

review/text: We have been using Fresh Step "Multiple Cat" for several months now, my cats use it, it clumps well, and I like how well it controls odors. I also really like that it is "Prime" eligible for shipping and that means the UPS guy has to carry it up to our porch, which is great since we accidentally ordered ten boxes of this (yep, 250lbs) because the "Two-Day 1-Click" button kept returning an error and I didn't think to check if each click resulted in an order. By the way, kitty litter is considered a "grocery" item and is not generally eligible for return to Amazon but they did find a way to make it right to my satisfaction.<br /><br />So, this is good kitty litter that we will be using for the foreseeable future.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/text: I tried a couple of real cheap litters that of course didn't work well. Then I tried Arm & Hammer which didn't cover up the scent at all.  Fresh step multiple has been by far the best at hiding the odor.  I recommend cleaning the box every couple days and adding just a tad of fresh litter.  In a small apartment this hides the smell pretty well.<br />I have to take off some stars due to how dusty this litter now is.  There's been some sort of change in the production that makes this litter now really dusty.  After petting my cat I can smell the litter dust.  I'll be switching to another brand.

review/summary: Fresh Step VS Tidy Cat...Fresh Step wins hands down!
review/text: I was so disappointed with Tidy Cat scoopable litter that I was about to go back to the regular litter, but decided to give it one more go with a different brand. The trouble with Tidy Cat is that the soiled litter would turn to a thick, sticky mud that was very difficult to scoop and would leave a lot of mud-like residue behind. I would end up emptying the entire litter box, clean it out, and start from scratch which defeated the purpose of scoopable litter.<br /><br />Fresh Step proved to be a major improvement. It is so much easier to scoop and doesn't turn into the sticky mud that Tidy Cat would form. I can actually scoop now and not have to empty the entire litter box.<br /><br />Both Fresh Step and Tidy Cat controlled odor. Tidy Cat's plastic container was a bit easier to transport. Fresh Step prevents litter mess and waste; thus, saves money as pound for pound it scooped better and last longer. Fresh Step wins hands down as it is by far the most scoopable litter.  I just disposed of two new containers of Tidy Cat as it wasn't worth the trouble and mess.

Dusty, when I pour it into the litter box, I cannot breathe nor see anything, just as if I am in desert and there is wind. Turn your head away when pouring it.<br />2. Yucky fragrance. Smell cheap and not healthy for my cat.<br /><br />Price is not pro nor a con for this product, it is pretty much in the middle of the price range.<br />But I won't buy it again except if my cat runs out of litter before my online order arrives, as I said, you can easily find it locally.

review/summary: Scent is too strong for many cats!
review/text: In my experience (working with around 300 cats at our local animal shelter), Fresh Step tends to be too strongly scented for most cats.  They would prefer to use an unscented litter and sometimes will go outside of their litter box so they don't have to use this litter (not often, but sometimes).  As far as its consistency, most cats are OK with it.<br /><br />Because it is so smelly, it does a good job of camouflaging odor, but if you have a picky cat, I'd choose an unscented or less strongly scented litter.

review/summary: Dusty!
review/text: Yes, Fresh Step does have good odor control... But it's really, really dusty! Every time I pour it into the litterbox and whenever the cats are digging in it, there's a visible cloud of dust.  Plus the cats track it all over my wood floors.  What a mess!  I notice now that other brands of litter advertise being '99.5%' or '99.7% dustfree' on their boxes. Fresh Step has no mention of this on its box. For good reason!

review/summary: The 'Holy Grail' of cat litters
review/text: This is the only litter I will use. (Actually, I prefer the unscented version but I bought the scented this time.) When I think of the definition of a clumping litter, I think of this stuff. The clumps are so solid; it doesn't make a difference whether the clump was made from piddle or poo. It also clumps using a minimal amount of litter, which makes the litter last so much longer than any other brand. The clumps don't crack, crumble, or fall apart in any way when I'm scooping. My cat is obsessed with digging and kicking the litter around, and keeps her box pristine. She will continue to bury until she can't smell her waste; with stinky, weak litter this means she pretty much never stops burying. With this litter, she is satisfied after two or so kicks! She also likes to 'organize' her box... seriously, she will go back and make sure all the piddle cakes are on one side, all the poo cakes on another, and all the clean litter in the back corners. With weak crumbly litter, she will break up all the urine clumps into tiny pieces during this process causing the whole thing to smell worse since the tiny pieces are harder to scoop. With this litter, she can push around the clumps to her hearts content and they never break!! It also sticks to her paws much less than other litters I've tried. Its tiny weightless grains of clay also stay in the box when she kicks and digs, unlike other brands that have huge chunks of clay that hit the wall and floor with every kick. (There's still a lot of litter around the box, but that really has nothing to do with the litter. My cats a digger/ kicker/ flinger.) When I pour the litter in, there is a bit of dust. Its not a lingering menacing cloud like someone else said, that's so exaggerated. Its just a little dust. There is no dust cloud when my kitty paws around in it, and no dust cloud when I scoop. The scent is not nearly as potent (aka nauseating!) as other litters I've tried, but I still don't like it. Like I said, I usually get the unscented. Speaking of smells... the first time I used fresh step (after using a really gross store brand that was on sale) my cat seemed to be really confused. She always piddles right after I scoop the box, or after I clean it and change the litter. The first time she used this, she piddled, then buried it completely with only two kicks. When shes burying, she kicks a couple times and then goes back and checks if she can smell it, and repeats until its buried. She was absolutely confused by the fact that the pee had 'disappeared' in sight and in smell. She started to try to dig it back up! She looked like she was thinking, "I know I just peed here... didn't I?? Where the heck did it go?!" It took her several potty visits to realize that the waste was not just disappearing. Since using fresh step, I've only used a different brand one time... it was a disaster. She was clearly disgusted by the feel of the litter and the fact that it smelled horrible (and I scoop every day). After two days with that bad litter, she refused to use her box. She had an accident for the very first time. Since then, I've only bought this stuff. My cat is content and I am quite pleased.

review/summary: Hernia Inducing Cat Litter
review/text: I used Fresh Step cat litter for many years and was quick to tell any of my cat owner friends that it was the best "bang for the buck" litter. It clumped hard, making the chore of cleaning the cat box a relatively easy one. Sometime around 6 months ago, that all changed. Now, it forms a sludge in the cat box that is nearly impossible to scrape out. The amount of effort necessary to clean the box could easily induce a muscle strain or hernia for those unfortunate enough to purchase this litter. Interestingly, after having this experience (twice, because I thought maybe I just got a bad batch the first time) I turned to Scoop Away which I always considered to be a similarly good product, only to find the exact same thing. What the heck? Turns out both products are made by the Clorox Pet products Co. Consider yourself warned!

review/summary: Fresh Step Scoop-able Cat Litter, Multi-cat, 25 Pound Box
review/text: Fresh Step Scoopable Cat Litter, Multi-cat, 25 Pound Box<br /><br />My cats prefer this brand of litter.  I've tried others, but this is their preferred.  I tried a side by side comparison and the cats didn't use the other brand when they could choose.  So, to keep my cats happy, this is the form and type of litter they want.<br /><br />Those of us who own cats know they can be picky and that goes without saying, their choice in litter is important to their overall health.  It's scoopable so it makes clean up easier and the carbon eliminates odors from urine and feces.  Fresh Step has gone through several updates to its product and this new improved odor control is the best formulation yet and it has a pleasant scent.<br /><br />I fill the litter box with 3 to 4 inches of Fresh Step Scoopable, as the cat uses it, the scoopable formula works well to clump around the liquid waste and makes disposal easier of both liquid and solid.  Disposal in the trash is quick and easy and I refill the litter box back to it's original depth and the cats are very happy.  The odor eliminating carbon works 24/7, multi-cat formula fights bacterial odors, and the high-quality clumping clay clumps tight to help prevent leaving behind stinky crumbles.<br /><br />But remember this, I completely change all the litter in the box once a month and wash and dry their litter pans for best results.<br /><br />This is my cat's choice, so who's to argue, a good 5 scratches... oops 5 stars is their opinion.  For my cats this is the best litter and it is important to use a pooper scooper on getting the clumps out.  The more clomps that are remove the happier the cat will be and they will continue to use the litter, by having a box or to as back ups for those days the store is sold out or the weather is so bad you just can't get out to bring it home.  It's better to have more on hand, then have a carpet dumpling to clean up.

review/text: I always try to buy scoopable cat litter in the largest packages to save some money and having more on hand.  Since I fell and tore my rotator cuffs, it has been hard to carry anything that weighed even a few pounds.  I was so thrilled to find I could get my cat's favorite litter from Amazon and delivered right to my door with no risk of re-injuring my shoulders lifting cat litter packages.  I told my neighbor and they were happy to learn about this too.<br /><br />PS:  I have tried various litter brands and overall had the best results with Fresh Step and Scoop Away.  Fresh Step is not as highly fragranced, but both do the job well and do not scatter much.  I did not have any problem with dust from either.

review/text: We love this cat litter.  It is the only cat litter we use and we have 3 cats!  Compared to other cat litters we found that Fresh Step does the best job of staying clumped/clumping and minimizing odors (though not eliminating them).  However, I do want to make a note that having purchased from Amazon.com - the first order was returned to Amazon before it even reached our door.  We weren't sure why but the cat litter was delivered again using a different courier and explained the first package's disappearance - the stress of the shipping caused the box to rupture and cat litter was everywhere!  I would suggest just buying this at your local grocery store or wholesale club.

The second time, I open the amazon box and found out the Fresh Step box inside has been broken, there was litter everywhere. Horrible experience to clean them up. The good thing about it is clumps well, and keep odor down if your kitten covers their poop well. Plus, it's really cheap. However, it was very dusty and causing me allergy.

review/summary: Tastes a little strange, but at least it's organic.  Beats Jell-o brand!
review/text: I bought this at Whole Foods (which is why my purchase isn't verified).  I got on Amazon to check the reviews to see if I was the only one that thought this tastes a little strange.  Not necessarily bad, just different.  (Let me add that I eat mostly organic and I am used to the difference between organic food and artificially flavored crud).  I get a hint of lavender or rosemary at the beginning, and then the pudding ends off on a sweet note.  I put a little vanilla and cinnamon in mine and that helped improve the flavor.  I think fresh bananas would also be nice.  I'll gladly put up with the strange taste knowing this isn't full of genetically modified soy and garbage preservatives. It does contain soy lecithin, but the box indicates that there are no GMO's so I am okay with the soy lecithin.  I have the coconut up in my cupboard, can't wait to try it next!  Also, if I could give this 3.5 stars instead of 3, I would.

review/text: *****<br />Numi Tea's Chinese Breakfast Yunnan Black Tea is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The only ingredient is fair trade certified organic high mountain Yunnan Black Tea FOP (Flowery Orange Pekoe). There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "This noble tea is grown in the mist covered mountains of Yunnan province. What distinguishes this fine, organic black tea is its perfect sense of balance, exquisite tiger's eye color, and a lean vibrancy which makes it suitable at any time of day. Like a complex wine, it is the perfect tea for food, marrying well with a wide variety of dishes. It has a distant and hard to place floral quality, yet it leaves the mouth tasting as clean as spring water. And it energizes the body and mind more harmoniously than the best of coffees. We are proud to bring you this high grade leaf."<br /><br />Although this tea says "orange pekoe", it does not taste citrus-y, but has a strong morning black tea taste with flowery overtones. It is like a regular orange pekoe upgraded many, many times, with something delicate, lovely, and flowery added. It's the perfect morning tea, or for anytime you want a high-quality pick-me-up.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love regular black, this will probably be the best you've ever had, and you'll wonder why you ever drank the "old stuff"!<br />*****

To beat it, you have to go loose-leaf.<br /><br />The only real knock on Numi is that it's expensive... I've seen grocery stores that charged $7.99 a box. Buying it through Amazon gets around this.<br /><br />Of their black teas, Chinese Breakfast is arguably the best- crisp, clean, a bit like spring water. You never really get tired of it.<br /><br />If you prefer green tea, I recommend their Gunpowder Green, Jasmine, and Macha (Brown Rice) teas. You won't be disappointed.

The only ingredient is fair trade certified organic high mountain Yunnan Black Tea FOP (Flowery Orange Pekoe). There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "This noble tea is grown in the mist covered mountains of Yunnan province. What distinguishes this fine, organic black tea is its perfect sense of balance, exquisite tiger's eye color, and a lean vibrancy which makes it suitable at any time of day. Like a complex wine, it is the perfect tea for food, marrying well with a wide variety of dishes. It has a distant and hard to place floral quality, yet it leaves the mouth tasting as clean as spring water. And it energizes the body and mind more harmoniously than the best of coffees. We are proud to bring you this high grade leaf."<br /><br />Although this tea says "orange pekoe", it does not taste citrus-y, but has a strong morning black tea taste with flowery overtones. It is like a regular orange pekoe upgraded many, many times, with something delicate, lovely, and flowery added. It's the perfect morning tea, or for anytime you want a high-quality pick-me-up.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love regular black, this will probably be the best you've ever had, and you'll wonder why you ever drank the "old stuff"!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Maximum lemon!
review/text: This Sicilian Lemon Nectar is about as concentrated and intense as a lemon drink can be.  In fact, I use it as a concentrate, adding about one part lemon nectar to four or five parts sparkling water - which yields the most fantastic lemon beverage imaginable.  The flavor is beyond lemon, with floral and mixed citrus peel notes that are well beyond the unidimensional flavors of the lemons and lemonades typically sold in the US - more like the best, ripest meyer lemons, plus some kind of secret sauce.  Really, really good, and used as the base for a sparkling drink, one bottle goes a long way and is not all that expensive, even at the amazon seller's price.<br /><br />By the way, if you look for this from your local specialty food store, they may well tell you it is no longer being imported to the US.  That seems to be wrong... so this may be the last, best source for a drink to which you may well find yourself hopelessly addicted.  Stock up.

review/summary: The Most Garlic Filled Chip
review/text: This is a great product.  If you like garlic, this is the chip for you.  I'm not sure how they cram so much garlic flavor into these chips-- but they're great.  I shared a bag with co-workers, and couldn't find anyone that didn't like these chips. (but of course, all garlic lovers)<br /><br />The chips are a perfect size-- not gigiantic and not too small.  The flavor of potato really comes through well with the garlic.  I eat them plain, for maximum flavor-- I want nothing to ruin the taste.  You'll want to give a friend a kiss after eating, or scare away some vampires!<br /><br />My bags arrived undamaged, and very fresh.  The packaging is very study, and these can handle even the roughest shipping treatment.

review/summary: The best in a bottle!
review/text: I'd recently asked some online friends in a food forum what they thought the best bottled barbecue sauce is.  Four out of five of them mentioned<br />"Bone Suckin".  I was NOT disappointed!  It is not a thick gloppy sauce clogged up with corn syrup as most of the supermarket brands (Hunts, Kraft, etc) are.  The flavor is complex.  It is not too sweet, not vinegary, and with just a modicum of spice heat to keep it interesting, and so it tastes like barbecue. I've even used it in kitchen cooking (as opposed to grilling) and people commented on the great taste.<br />I bought it from Amazon, but Whole Foods also carries it.

review/summary: BBQ Sauce Reviews Rated a 5
review/text: (i cut and pasted this from my website)<br /><br />---<br /><br />Phil Ford, a real estate appraiser and father of four in Raleigh, North Carolina, developed his sauce around 1987 while trying to copy his mother's recipe for a western North Carolina-style barbecue sauce.<br /><br />The resulting all natural, fat-free, fragrant blend of ingredients include: tomato paste, apple cider vinegar, honey, molasses, mustard, horseradish, lemon juice, onions, garlic, peppers, natural hickory smoke, natural spices and salt.<br /><br />This one gets [...] props for a magical combination of quality ingredients, simple packaging, clever name, and well balanced flavor. The only thing I found slightly lacking (a stretch) was that the consistency was a bit on the thin side.<br /><br />The smell is wonderful - a sweet yet complex aroma with hints of apple, mustard, lemon, onions, and the "smokiness" that all barbecue sauces attempt. I could see putting this on almost anything - I think I want to try this on swordfish next, then a Bone Suckin Burger after that.<br /><br />The first time I tried this stuff was a long time ago, during my college days, before I knew much about BBQ and grilling... and I had slathered the stuff on before the meat was ready for a barbecue bath. The result was a less-than-tasty, blackened mess. Bad experience for a bad griller - I blame it on the beer I was drinking at the time.<br /><br />But my most recent, and sober, experience was a meal of half rack of ribs and a few chicken wings all done the right way, when the meat is at about the 75th percentile of BBQ cookage. This way, the sweets didn't completely die and I was able to take in one of the best natural- ingredient sauces on the market...<br /><br />You know I love my Bullseye and traditional Kansas City style BBQ sauces (even though some may contain the dreaded HFCS), yet this one went all natural and retained a quality flavor - a deed well worth 5 out of 5. Sometimes that's hard to do - I compare it to household cleaners... sometimes you don't trust those all natural, "green" cleaning products because you assume they aren't going to be as strong. And sometimes you don't trust a BBQ sauce when they decide to limit ingredients to things that are not manufactured and/or processed. Not the case here.<br /><br />After my 100% objective tasting and review, I found other high ratings across the board:<br /><br />Rated #1 in Health Magazine<br /><br />Rated #1 by Newsweek Magazine<br /><br />All Natural, Fat Free, Gluten Free & Certified Kosher / Pareve.

review/summary: Best BBQ Sauce I ever had!
review/text: I am a very picky health concious guy who is an athlete, I try to pick organic foods, also I drink my daily green tea and matcha tea, all organic ofcourse, so when it comes to BBQ its easy to become unhealthy with the high fat and high sodium usually accompanied with preservatives, but there are healthy ways to BBQ and this sauce is a great supplement! It is the most healthy sauce and the flavor is phenomenal, one of my favorites bbq sauce of all time is "Stubbs" texas bbq sauce which is another all time great, but I would say BSS is slightly better, I give it A+++, and Stubbs original bbq sauce I rate A+.

review/summary: Best Packaged BBQ Sauce Out There
review/text: This is by far the best store bought BBQ sauce I've ever had.  I am fortunate that they sell this in the stores near me. Whenever it's on sale, I always stock up on several jars. I've used this on both baby back ribs and on chicken on the grill and it's unbelievably good.  I've also used it in the slow cooker with country style ribs.  Just throw it in the slow cooker with  the ribs and a chopped up onion and cook on low for about 6 to 8 hours.  When they're done, grill them on each side for a few minutes and you get fabulous fall of the bone ribs.<br /><br />I've had dozens of jarred and bottled sauces and none have come even close to Bone Suckin' Sauce.  Simply the best.

review/text: When I first tasted it out the bottle, it tasted average. But then it sat in the fridge and I guess all the seasonings came out. I couldn't stop tasting it out of the bottle! It has a sweet taste and is addictive. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 is because it's a bit thin. The consistency is more like a marinade. I think BBQ sauce should be thick. But I think they have a thick version so I'd recommend buying that. Other than that I'd give it 5/5.

review/summary: Suckin' is the operative word
review/text: I know - the caption is too easy.  I was very excited when I read all it's glowing reviews, as I really like BBQ sauce, but they let me down.  I liked the idea that there was no HFCS in it, so I tried it.<br /><br />It is very thin, and it tastes like watered down, flavored ketchup.  It is wimpy, and has no umph.  (I notice they now make a thicker version.)  I mix the Original with some Bullseye BBQ sauce to make it palatable, otherwise I would throw it away.  I bought 2 bottles at once based on the reviews, so I'll be giving my other bottle to a frenemy.<br /><br />The Bullseye also has no HFCS, and the only ingredient I'm not thrilled with is the modified food starch, but I do love the taste!<br /><br />Update: 7/14/12 I have to amend my review. I recently went to the grocery, as I was running low on Bulls-Eye, and I found out the main ingredient is now High Fructose Corn Syrup!  I checked on the old bottle I had at home and there was no HFCS in it....  Is the Corn Syrup Lobby that powerful?  If anyone knows of a great tasting BBQ sauce I can switch to (with no HFCS) please post it!  Thanks

review/summary: This salt will change your life
review/text: Those searching high and low for salt that will change their life can end their journey with Murray River Sea Salt.<br /><br />I first stumbled on this salt at a local outlet of a cultlike nationwide chain store that pretends to sell only the highest quality foods but also happily lends its imprimatur to made-in-China foods that sometimes turn out to be tainted.  But, ignoring other controversies associated with that store, one day a package of this salt sold by that store stirred my interest which led to the salt completing the last step of its long and probably ecologically-unsound trip from Australia to my kitchen.<br /><br />Here's the thing about Murray River salt:  Its pinkish flakes are fragile and crumble easily in your fingers.  It also seems to dissolve almost immediately on contact with food.  This is in sharp contrast to every other salt I've tried.  We currently have 6 or 8 other kinds of coarse-crystal salt in the house.  None of them can be crushed in your fingers.  They remain large, hard chunks of salt.  Yes, they represent other flavors than the Murray River salt, but there is something gentle and friendly about this salt.  I have a totally-unsubstantiated theory that this salt is better for your body than the hardened crystals of other salts.<br /><br />Our household keeps Murray River salt in a salt cellar (in our case a small lidded wooden bowl) from which it is pinched with the fingers (instead of using the traditional tiny spoon) and crumbled directly onto food on the plate.  For sanitary reasons, only a small amount of the salt at a time is put in the bowl.  That way the bowl gets cleaned frequently.  Frequent cleaning seems like a necessity when fingers, even washed ones, are the tools of choice for dispensing the salt.  Words to the wise: If you invite nose-pickers to your table, provide a salt shaker and hide the Murray River stuff till they've left.  If you have small children in your home, wait until they are grown and are draining your bank account at the safe distance of some far-off college before purchasing and placing this salt on your table.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned that they use this as a finishing salt.  Our household concurs.  We rarely if ever add this salt to anything in the cooking process.  We keep Kosher salt and a couple of sea salts for most larger-salt-use cooking needs, like baking (which frankly seems like the only time one should add much salt to the cooking process).  But this is the good stuff for your table and the food you serve on it.<br /><br />The chain store mentioned above no longer carries this salt so Amazon is the logical alternative.<br /><br />Note that I purchased a 1lb bag, which keeps well because I live in a desert.  But next time I'll probably purchase a multi-pack of the smallest bags for a small amount more per unit weight in exchange for the convenience of having smaller packages.

review/summary: Fantastic BBQ sauce!
review/text: My husband and I LOVE this BBQ sauce.  So far verified to be delicious on grilled chicken and pork ... Next up, kabobs!  With all-organic ingredients, I even fed some ground up BBQ chicken to my 10 month old.  Can't wait to try the spicy version!

review/summary: Fantastic Sauce!
review/text: This is hands down my family's favorite BBQ sauce. Even my picky 8-year-old loves it!<br /><br />My husband received two bottles of it for Christmas, and we've been looking for a local source of it since. We're thrilled to find it on Amazon.<br /><br />Give it a try!

review/summary: Bill's Best is the Best!!!
review/text: This is the BBQ sauce for health-conscious individuals! Not only does it taste delicious--almost like a Memphis style BBQ sauce--but it is made using the healthiest ingredients possible (without sacrificing taste). Every other organic or all-natural BBQ sauce on the market includes one or more of these less than healthy ingredients: corn syrup, gluten (wheat), and/or soy. Bill's Best is the only one I've seen that does not have any of these ingredients, yet it still manages to taste better than the others that do. Believe me, living in Tennessee for the past twelve years, and being surrounded by various types of BBQ restaurants, I have tried virtually every type of BBQ and BBQ sauce in an area of the country known for great BBQ. Bill's Best ranks right up there with the best of them! This is a must buy!

review/summary: Great chocolate....mmm
review/text: If you have never had these chocolates...BUY THEM! They are delicious and come from Germany. They are like truffles but have a slight hint of pistachio in them. Try them you will thank me. The only reason I docked a star is because of the shipping. Mine came to me melted. Maybe it was the Texas heat maybe it wasn't but I was there when they arrived so they didn't even sit in the sun.

review/summary: Awesome
review/text: I do not like hard candy or candy in general really, but these actually taste like the real lemon they are made from and are tart in a natural lemony way and not too sweet. It's hard to find the Claey's brand in stores, so I order in bulk. I just wish the shipping was cheaper.

review/summary: yummy...i love this stuff!
review/text: these licorice hard candies are exactly as you see in the picture, and taste even better.  i've eaten panda black chewy "natural" licorice, but it's not sweet enough when i want to eat some (real) CANDY.  this claey's licorice tastes just as my taste buds imagined/hoped they would.  i'm sold, and about to place my second order of them.  each piece is approximately 1/2" by 1/2", the perfect size, the perfect taste, the perfect candy for my sweet craving.  some might think they are a little pricey, but we need to indulgence ourselves on occasion...we deserve it, right?  my new favorite candy!

review/text: There's a very nice watermelon flavor to these candies.  If I had any complaint...and I really don't...it would be that I'd prefer the candies individually wrapped.  Otherwise, I'm pleased with my selection.

review/summary: not really what I expected
review/text: This falls pretty short of what I had hoped for.  It has the slightest taste of watermelon I guess.  It really tastes like bubble gum.  Not recommended.  Jolly ranchers taste more watermelony.

review/summary: Yum! Old fashioned hard drops!
review/text: Delicious, loads of flavor without being overwhelming and burning. Very addictive. I ordered several other flavors as well and liked them all. Old fashioned quality is my main impression. The dusting of confection sugar adds to the presentation and taste.
