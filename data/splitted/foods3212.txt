review/summary: Horrible
review/text: I ordered the No Sugar Added version. I usually like no sugar added or low sugar products - ice cream, yogurt, hot chocolate etc. But this one was terrible. Like the other reviewer, this tasted like ovaltine. I had to use like 5 spoons of the powder to get the taste. I don't know what to do with 5 other cans.. I will probably donate..

review/summary: It's the Best
review/text: I have tasted several Stephen's Gourmet products, but the Chocolate Raspberry is my favorite. It's creamy, smoothe and delicious.  I consider it my one splurge for myself.  I have a cup every morning and have now shared my favorite beverage with my son, who just cannot get enough of it.  He has created different recipes with it, one using ice cream.  I will stick to the original method.  It's the best hot cocoa mix I have ever tasted.  The aroma alone will draw you in.  I am often asked what is that wonderful smelling beverage.  Occasionally I will share in hopes they will purchase their own.  Stephen's Gourmet makes the best cocoa ever.  I will drink it as long as they continue to make it.

review/text: I love this stuff!  This is my favorite of the flavors I have tried.  I do feel like I have to add quite a bit of chocolate powder to get it to the flavor that I like, but that is okay.  I'd take this over any of the other stuff any day.  Swiss Miss is for the kids and this stuff is for me.  My husband loved the milk chocolate...until he tried the amaretto.  I just stick with this because I haven't found that I like the others as much.  Even though I don't like the others as much, all of the Stephen's cocoa that I have tried is the richest out there.  It doesn't taste like I mixed it with water at all.

review/summary: Real Candy Cane Shavings In This!
review/text: This is the best candy cane cocoa, and it has real bits of candy cane. Don't worry, it's not totally sharp... Most of it dissolves in the liquid.<br /><br />I mix my cocoa with a battery operated frother, which uses every single bit of cocoa, so there is not a single bit of cocoa on the bottom.<br /><br />After, it's really a pepperminty cup of chocolate that is very lovely. Refreshing, I'd say.<br /><br />This is a must with milk, though I think you can do it with water... but milk is best to get the full flavor effect.

review/summary: Stephens Gourmet NSA Hot Chocolate
review/text: If you've read the other reviews about Stephens hot chocolate, well, the same for this one. It tastes rich and good. I'm diabetic type II and there is nothing else in hot chocolate that comes close without being loaded with sugar. Diabetes really narrows the field when it comes to things you can eat or drink so am glad that Stephens makes this product. In every shiny white cloud there is a bit of soot hiding somewhere. The lump of coal is that they don't sell it in Canada and won't ship across the border. That is so sad. Canadians having to deal with yet another item they can't get. Not sure why this is whether US government, Canadian border guards with a grudge, or Stephens just don't want extra paper work. Thank goodness for friends who go on trips down south and bring it back for me. Good stuff.

review/summary: Yummy and warm in my tummy!!!
review/text: Make per directions and use half & half to top off for richer taste, maybe a little whipped cream topper and you have have a melt in the chair, soft spot, where visions of sugar plums and the like may begin to dance in your heads.  Yummy and so delicious.  I've purchased twice, first at near $13-each for two, then near $5-each for six of them - chalk it up to when you're buying!  I should make clear that I do not regret my initial purchase, I was merely showing an example when timing can play a part in the value of this kind of transaction.  Please allow me to elaborate that I initially selected Chadwell Retail sellers as I was trying the product, and it seemed reasonable given the value for two to select them to complete my purchase.  I have no qualms with the seller and would openly consider their services on this open market again as the purchase made sense.  Thank you for reading this far and for your consideration in advance.

What I really like is that they aren't overly sweet, and that it mixed together very well, unlike most brands that just clump up and stick to the spoon.  Definitely my favorite hot chocolate!  The cider flavors are great too!

review/summary: Not exactly sure how to rate this
review/text: I bought this mostly based on the reviews. I really wanted hot chocolate from Stephen's, but amazon didn't have it. I stumbled across this and thought I would try it. It is white, even though "cocoa" is in the title...in case you didn't figure that out! I did realize it wasn't chocolate, but didn't really know what to expect.<br /><br />The best way I can describe it is that it tastes like a vanilla milkshake, but hot! I happen to love vanilla milkshakes way more than chocolate ones (but hate drinking milk, go figure), but somehow, I haven gotten used to this product after about a week. I have 6 cans now, so I have many more opportunities to try! It may just be that I sort of mentally "expect" hot chocolate and I have to retrain my slow brain! It is interesting and different, and I still drink it, and almost like it, but still would pick pick the hot chocolate over this. Definitely worth a try if you like vanilla.

review/summary: The richest tasting hot cocoa I've ever tasted.
review/text: I bought a can of Stephen's hot cocoa over 5 years ago not realizing how good it was going to be. After I drank the first few cups I was hooked and could not find it anywhere again. I ordered it directly from the company for several years and even took several cans to the UK with me when we moved over taking care to make them last. I'm very glad to find this brand on amazon as it's rich flavor surpasses all others I've tried. If you love dark chocolate this is it. I haven't tasted the other flavors but would be willing to bet they are just as good. I may order some for stocking stuffers for Christmas.<br /><br />I also like that this comes in a can with a scoop so you can make it more or less chocolatey as you like or adjust the amount of powder for the size of your mug/cup. The pre-measured packs that most hot cocoa comes in are supposed to be for an 8oz cup and most mugs are 12oz so 2 packets is too strong and one only fills your mug half way. If you'd like very rich hot chocolate you can use 1/2 milk and 1/2 water. You really don't need marshmallows.

Now everyone I know buys it and I'm even happier to be spreading it around. My only issue is that I wish they would have a mixed pack; a 6 pack of mint, hazelnut, regular, dark, vanilla and irish cream would really be perfect!

review/text: I love all of the cocoa in the Stephen's Gourmet line, but I think this one is my favorite. The other people in my family have different favorites (we all love Stephen's), but we all agree the Belgian Dark ranks at the top for the best all-purpose drinking cocoa.<br /><br />I like my cocoa with a little added milk in it, and starting out with a good DARK cocoa allows me to achieve that milky texture without sacrificing that rich chocolate flavor.<br /><br />As an added bonus, Stephen's cocoa is labeled "Gluten Free" -- taking the guesswork out of choosing a cocoa for those of us who must avoid gluten-containing additives such as barley malt (a common ingredient in chocolate).

review/summary: Taste is individual
review/text: I LOVE dark chocolate so when I saw the reviews of this kind I figured I'd give it a try.  Now taste is a matter of individuality so I'll give you the difference in this Belgian Dark Chocolate by Stephen's and my usual Nestle Rich Chocolate:<br /><br />Belgian:150 calories per serving,  serving is 3Tlb mix and only 3/4 cup water or milk.<br />vs<br />Nestle: 80 calories w/water per serving, serving is 2Tlb mix and a WHOLE cup of water.<br /><br />Belgian: Total Fat 3.5g,  Sodium 240mg, Total Carbs 27g, Sugars 22g, Protein 2g<br /><br />Nestle: Total Fat 3g, Sodium 170mg, Total Carbs 15g, Sugars 12g, Protein 1g<br /><br />I first mixed the Belgian mix as directed but couldn't finish it due to the fact that it was just too sweet for me.  It IS creamy, but just too sweet.  When I use the Nestle I only use 1/2Tlb and a squirt of dark choc. syrup and I'm happy with that.  So I then mixed the Belgian as I do with the Nestle and it's ok.  I can't rave about it due to the fact that it's higher in sugars and sodium than the Nestle and if you are trying to watch those things you might want to take that into consideration.<br />To me dark chocolate shouldn't be as sweet(or sweeter) as milk chocolate, I'm sure that's why I prefer dark chocolate.  I'll even add some unsweetened chocolate powder to my mix at times.<br /><br />But as I've said it's all in your individual taste, I just wish they would have listed the Nutrient Facts along with their ingredients.<br />Not bad, just not all that great if you don't like REALLY sweet hot chocolate.

It is definitely not up to the level of Archer (Target brand), Twinings (some grocery stores), or Cadbury (overseas or very few grocery stores).<br /><br />Cocoa is the 4th ingredient. No chocolate as an ingredient. Bunch of fats and fillers. Archer has cocoa as the second ingredient and chocolate as the 4th and 5th ingredient. That's more like it.<br /><br />Stephen's chocolate has bad/very light color, little aroma, thin, doesn't dissolve. A very disappointing purchase.

Just as with good coffee, its not necessary to make it overly sweet or flavored since there aren't that many sweet-freak-fatties drinking it. The ancient Incas didn't use any sugar at all with their chocolate!<br /><br />I did give it an extra star just for having a dark chocolate drink product since their aren't many companies that even make one, so kudos to them for that.

You might end up doing what I will have to do when you don't like it.<br />sigh<br />give it away~

review/summary: Warning: Make sure you're buying the right flavor.
review/text: I bought some of this chocolate for my mother who can't have much caffeine. She used to drink Nestle hot cocolate, fat free-caffeine free, but they stopped making it in canisters so you have to buy it only the expensive way in the puches. Anyway, I saw the milk chocolate flavor of Stephen's on here, looked up info and found out it was low in caffeine so I ordered a BUNCH of it for mom. 110 bucks worth. We got it today and I opened it up and all of the cans were minct chocolate flaovor. I thought they sent the wrong kind... I checked my order and found out I indeed ordered the wrong flavor. See, the canisters look EXACTLY the same except the milk chocolate flavor has a small brown strip in the middle and the mint chocolate has a small green strip in the middle. That's the ONLY difference between the canisters. And since the initial thumbnail images on Amazon are so small, it's easy to not see such a little difference. yes, its' technically my fault, but they need more difference in artwork on the canisters. Not only that, Amazon would not take it back, even though it all was unopened, because its "food". and the company who makes it basically said "Sorry, but it sucks to be you". So here I sit, 110 dollars worth of hot chocolate which no one can use.

review/text: I bought this over the summer and made it with my friend. The instructions are in Japanese,but there are pictures to help you,but me and my friend used a video on Youtube to make sure we knew what we were doing. It was really fun to make,but when we took a bite out of everything,we spit them out. The noodles tasted sweet,but in a really artificial weird type of way. The black seeds were the best part in my opinion though. The rice was okay,but more fun to squish than eat. I wouldn't mind purchasing this item again,though.

review/summary: Popin' Cookin'
review/text: Like the other reviewers, we bought this after we saw the youtube video.  My three year old daughter would watch this video over and over again.  When we got it, it was much smaller than I thought it would be but our opinions were based off of watching a video so...  The directions are in Japanese but you can view the video on youtube and they are pretty much step by step.  The box also has pictures on the back which help to some degree to follow but if you are not familiar with the video, it might be difficult.<br /><br />The video shows something like a cupcake liner that is silver and the person squeezing the peach stuff into it.  The kit does not come with a cupcake liner, so if you are purchasing this for a child who has watched the video make sure to get the silver candy/cupcake liner.  There is not a spoon included in the kit like the video and the container holes are kind of small, we just flipped the fork around to stir.<br /><br />Regarding taste, I did not think it tasted good at all but it was worth it to get for the experience.  My daughter LOVED it.

review/summary: Rye bread enhancements
review/text: The Hodgson Mill Caraway Rye Bread Mix was an excellent starting point for making delicious home made bread.  I use a bread machine for the first and second kneads, but then always manually remove the dough and put into a silicone bread pan for the final rise and baking.<br /><br />The basic 1 1/2 lb recipe is fine and but to get a really deep deli rye taste I find that adding a Deli Rye flavor enhancer from King Arthur flour as well as some extra caraway seeds makes for a near operfect rye loaf.  I could make the loaf from first principles, but the Hodgson Mill kit is much easier and cost effective for all the ingredients vs individual purchase, it also makes for much less kitchen mess to clean up.<br /><br />I scored this 4 stars as it really needs a few extras to make the perfect loaf.

review/text: I bought this mix with new bread machine Zojirushi BBCCX20 (first bread machine I ever used). Mix is great way to start and learn process of bread making. It provides perfect transition to your own recipes once you feel more comfortable with machine and how the bread is done. This mix is meant for 1.5 lbs machine and mine is 2 lbs. Bread still comes out great (little smaller then meant in that machine). We still use it when there is no time to cook your own recipe that takes longer to put together.

review/summary: Bread Machine Resurrected!
review/text: I purchased a nice Breadman bread machine several years ago.  I tried some bread recipes that came with the machine and from cookbooks, with marginal success.  After the first feeble attempts the bread machine was moved off the counter top and rarely ever used.<br /><br />One of the things on my "to do" list was to try a bread mix to see if it came out better, so I would know if the problem was the bread machine or the bread recipes I'd been using.  A few weeks ago I happened to see the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FDDETG">Hodgson Mill Caraway Rye Bread Mix</a> on Amazon and since I needed to increase my order for the Super Saver shipping I tossed the bread mix in the cart.  Man, I'm glad I did.  This bread is great and now my bread machine is ready for action.  The Caraway Rye bread is very similar to my favorite store bought bread and half the price!<br /><br />As a matter of fact, I liked the Caraway Rye so much that I ordered the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FDDESM">Hodgson Mill 9 Grain</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FDMLVI">Hodgson Mill Wholesome White</a>.  Now I will have a nice selection of fresh breads and finally get some good use out of the bread machine.

review/text: I made this in my bread machine, and it was fantastic!  The taste and texture were exactly what a rye bread should have.<br /><br />Next time around, I'll add 1 tsp of salt and 1 Tbsp molasses to fancy it up, but it's not necessary.<br /><br />All around, this bread mix is awesome!

review/text: I made this with my bread machine and it came out perfect! Very impressed. The taste is mild, which is OK I might try adding molasses to the next loaf :) and the texture is great for making sandwiches. It is also one on the ONLY brands verified in the Non-GMO project as having NO GENETICALLY MODIFIED ingredients.... Works for me...

review/text: This bread baked fine in my bread machine and rose well, but it was a letdown when it came to flavor. I wouldn't say it was bad; in fact it was good, but not any better than store-bought bread. I ended up giving the birds half the loaf and won't be purchasing this again. My quest to find a good rye bread mix that's as good as the deli rye I used to buy continues...

review/summary: Hodgson Mill Bread Mix Products
review/text: I am extremely satisfied with both Hodgson Mill Bread Mixes that I purchased online. The potato bread mix actually rose and stuck to the top of my bread making machine and became entangled in the mixing blade, so it was difficult to remove. Otherwise, the bread tasted great!! The Rye bread was also delicious. It didn't rise as much, and I had no trouble removing it from the bread machine. The rye loaf was much denser than the potato bread loaf.<br /><br />The only drawback to purchasing these products online was the shipping costs. I have since found out that I can purchase the same brand products at HEB and Kroger grocery stores, and will not order online, again.

review/text: I use a bread machine and sometimes put the bread dough in a pan and bake. Glorious to have a 1 1/2 pound mix. The Rye is baking right now. I put 3 TBs of molassas in the batter to make it darker and I think will add flavor. Yum. Delighted to fill up the bread machine pan. My grocery only carries Fleishmanns (I don't like there mix) and another one that only makes 1 pound loaves. The selection isn't good either so I am in bread heaven to have Hodgson Mill available on my love, Amazon. Sorry, I have to go. My rye bread is done!

review/summary: Proper warehouse storage?
review/text: Have made two boxes so far. Both times the yeast gave poor results. The first batch the yeast didn't react at all. For the second box I followed the proofing instructions. The yeast seemed to activate but the dough only expanded about 50%. The boxes don't expire until 2012. I'm guessing that maybe the boxes experienced too great a temperature extreme either in storage or in shipping. Could setting in a cold truck in the bad weather we have been having kill the yeast? Or is the yeast just too old?<br /><br />The flour mix seems to be great. The dough mixes up perfectly. Next batch I'll going to use my own yeast; hopefully then I will produce a good load of rye bread. Can't wait....

review/summary: WARNING!
review/text: WARNING! You will love this bread!!! Be advised though, the yeast provided is not adequate. I live in the mountains at 8,000 feet and less yeast usually works up here, but I had to add another TABLESPOON of yeast to get the dough to rise properly. Like wild rice? We add one cup of cooked Lundberg wild rice blend. YUM YUM. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G82L62">Lundberg Wild Blend, Gourmet Blend of Wild and Whole Grain Brown Rice, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>.

review/text: We love our Sunbeam bread machine but had trouble finding good mixes for it in the store. Hodgson Mills products are great.  We've tried many of their bread machines varieties and like them all but this rye smells wonderful baking and is the tastiest yet.  I've found that using the light, white setting for all these mixes works best.  Whole wheat settings tend to overcook quite a bit.  Looking forward to trying the dark rye folks have spoken of. Thanks for the tips!

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FDDETG">Hodgson Mill Caraway Rye Bread Mix, 16-Ounce Units (Pack of 6)</a> Being a Civil War Re-enactor who cooks for approx 70 people each time out(17)per year. I am responsibile for baking bread and pies. I use this bread mix because it is easy, I can count on a wonderful loaf everytime. The mix mixes up easily, I can let it rise naturally outdoors and then bake it next to the fire in the dutch oven. I have tried frozen dough, does not work as well. Anyway love these mixes and only one local grocery chain carries them, now that I have found the 6 pk on Amazon, will buy from here. Needless to say I do make it at home also, but have tried it in my old bread machine, it does OK but comes out all ugly, would rather do it by hand and bake it in my bread pans. Beautiful, love the taste although I will try some of the other suggestions. Also, add a pan of water to your oven as you bake your bread, keeps your crust from getting to hard. THANKS Hodgson Mill!!!

review/summary: Unpleasantly Dense
review/text: I love rye bread, and grew up smelling and tasting fresh loaves of it in the New York City area.  I've been trying all the Hodgson Mill's breads and looked forward to this one.  So far I have baked three loaves of the rye mix, and it comes out looking very little like the photo on the box.<br /><br />Although the smell is somewhat pleasant (a fairly mild rye smell actually), the loaf does not seem to form the many tiny air pockets depicted or expected.  Thus it is incredibly dense, which makes for easy slicing, but a not-terribly-nice mouth-feel on those deli-meat sandwiches I remember from my youth.  The Publix supermarket-baked rye and rye-pumpernickel is actually much closer, from a texture point of view.<br /><br />Perhaps it is my bread machine, a slightly older Panasonic BT55P.  I am using the recommended whole-wheat cycle, which takes five hours, and have followed the bread mix instructions exactly.  I've tried using all butter, all oil (canola) and a combination of the two: same result.  I don't think I would buy this flavor again.  Stick to the white and honey wheat: both are fabulous.

review/summary: This cookie was a hit!
review/text: A dear friend who wanted me to feel included at her annual Christmas Eve buffet chose this mix to bake so I'd have a safe GF dessert.  Boy, were they a treat!<br /><br />She used real butter, and butter flavor Crisco, then added cashews for interest.  Yes, they were a bit fragile if handled roughly--but the flavor was wonderful...a lot like a pecan sandie. Since she wrapped up a plateful for me to take home, I ate another three with coffee when I got back to my house. It was terrific to have something that tasted like a real cookie, versus the nasty storebought GF stuff out there!<br /><br />The secret to baking GF cookies is to mound the dough up at the center for reinforcement, and never short the baking time.  [I learned this making Tollhouse cookies using King Arthur mix and the results were also great.] Thank you, Hodgson's.

review/summary: Much better than pills
review/text: One of our dogs whom we adopted as an adult had torn cranial cruciate ligaments in both back legs and a really difficult time getting around.  We opted for surgery on one leg to see if it would help, but the repair did not improve her mobility.  After two years of glucosamine supplements, she is tearing around the yard after our two younger dogs again.  It used to be a struggle to feed her the giant pills, and to remember them every day.  Now we just give the two younger dogs their Greenies and she gets her special one all at once as a daily treat--she views it as a reward, and it's easy for us to be consistent.  They are also labeled by week-day so that my partner and I no longer become confused about whether one of us has already medicated the dog on any given day.<br /><br />She has been on these for half a year now, and if anything, she has improved from her time on the pill supplements.  About a month ago she jumped onto our bed, which is about 3 feet off the ground.  We were delighted; for a long time she could barely stand up.  If your older dog has limited mobility due to joint problems, definitely give these a chance!

review/text: I have a 10 1/2 year old chow-shepard mix... a big girl about 95 pounds.  She started showing some signs of something hurting her as she laid or sat down and then when getting back up.  She didn't have a lot of energy to play or to go for a walk.  The Vet said she's getting arthritis we should try to give her some supplements.<br />We came across these at a mega-pet store and bought a package.  I've followed up with two more and about to buy another to be the fourth month of this experiment.<br />Does this work?  Well, for our dog, she no longer moans as she's lying down or getting up.  She's running around the house again, running in the yard after the squirrels and if we get anywhere near her leash, she's trying to get it off the hook for us to go, go, go.<br />Miracle?  Maybe.  Right product at the right time for my `pup'?  Yes indeed.<br />Do I recommend?  To every dog owner I know; and tell them Amazon has the best price too.

review/summary: No false claims here!
review/text: My dog has just turned 10 and we noticed on long walks, especially in the winter, she would get a little sore and limpy. While she's in pretty good shape and in excellent health, we were concerned about her joint health.<br /><br />My husband found these products at a pet food store and picked up a small package. For one week's worth of these treats, the total cost was $9.99.  I was skeptical as we'd tried a few other joint suppliments and not really seen any results.<br /><br />When I opened the package, I did appreciate that each day is labeled. When you have more than one owner in a house, knowing if the dog has had her daily dose can be an issue. This eliminates that problem entirely.<br /><br />We tried out the week's worth of treats and there was a small but noticible difference. Our bed is low to the ground and she had a much easier time getting up without straining and she wasn't limping after her walks.<br /><br />I decided to purchase a larger amount and saw that Amazon had the 28-pack for over $5 less than the store was selling it for. This made the decision for me and the treats arrived quickly thanks to Amazon Prime.<br /><br />Now, I have a dog who not only looks forward to her walks even more than normal but always is happy to hear the words "joint cookie" when she gets home from them.

review/summary: Pet Loves Them!
review/text: I got a one week supply-pack at the farm and feed store 4 days ago for my 8-year old, 65-pound black lab. She has had trouble with her hips a lot this last year. I assumed it would be like other treats and she would turn her nose up at them, but she LOVES them! I haven't given them to her long enough to claim that the glucosamine & chondroitin helps any, but if it helps pets as it does humans, then I assume they will do her good. Because she loves them and they have the glucosamine in them to help her joints, I will buy them for her again! This bigger box on Amazon.com this time!

review/summary: SMOKE Flavor - Note the tag!
review/text: Nowhere did it say "SMOKE" flavor in this ad - except in the little image - now I see it on the bag - just to the right of the logo, that faint beige spot. Urk.

review/summary: Great for bad knees!
review/text: My little toy poodle takes a 1/2 of one every day.  They really help with her bad knees.  Hopefully they will work for a long time.  Otherwise she will have to take prescription medication or have surgery.

review/summary: Joint care is very important
review/text: Joint care is very important for your dog, and you should start it early!  Once the symptoms appear - it helps, but you can ward off the symptoms longer if you start joint care early in your dog's life.  Ask your vet!
