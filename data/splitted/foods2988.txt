review/summary: Novel idea, but needs work
review/text: I'm always willing to try something new for my dogs, and this sounded like a great idea, a portable no-mess treat delivery system.<br />The flavor I'm reviewing is "Smoky Bacon"<br />I experienced some of the same issues noted by other reviewers. The ball in mine did not roll freely, so once my dog licked it clean, I had to manually advance it with my finger. So much for the "no mess" aspect.<br /> Squeezing the bottle as suggested by a few only results in a glop of foul-smelling liquid oozing out and dripping on the floor.<br />Yes, I said foul-smelling. I know dogs have a somewhat different take from their people on what smells good and what doesn't, but 3 of our 4 dogs recoiled at the smell of the product. Our only "outside" dog would take a lick, then take a sniff of her own rear end...presumably she found the scent similar. If you've ever seen a dog do that, then you know what I mean.<br /><br />I'm also concerned about how sanitary this delivery system is. Between uses you have a ball laden with dog-mouth bacteria multiplying. I doubt rinsing the ball before storage would help much, undoubtably some slobber is going to contaminate the bottle contents during usage. Refrigeration is not suggested on the label but it might help retard bacteria growth between uses.<br /><br />I think this product is another one of those things that sound like a good idea but the execution is flawed. I cannot recommend this product in good faith, and the $7.99 suggested retail price is a little steep for 1.7 fluid ounces of product.

review/summary: Three dogs -- not much interest
review/text: I tried this on three dogs, a border collie, a weiner dog, and a little taco dog. Each one showed an interest in only one of the three flavors, bacon being the top contender (two out of the three), as opposed to the chicken and liver flavors. However, the weiner dog (who has no other known allergies) was clearly allergic to this product -- she sneezed every time she licked it so I gave her no more. She has never sneezed like this before.<br /><br />In summary, with all the treats that are available for dogs these days, even though this one is a low-calorie type, I would pass it by. It seems like a good idea but in actuality, I'm pretty sure that you'll be seeing this product on the sale table at Big Lots before too long.

review/summary: My dog liked it, I didn't.
review/text: I usually try to see the good side of things so I'll start with  - my dog liked the taste.  She is an older dog and it takes a lot to get her excited, this did.  As for me, it's messy, and kind of icky when you think about the dog's saliva being put into the bottle every time you roll the ball top.  The top is a roller ball that is very difficult to turn.  You get your fingers sticky with this strong smelling liquid, and it has to be done repeatedly. You can run it along the counter to turn it, also a bad idea. The dog just gets a taste from the ball, then wants to EAT the bottle which, according to the warning label, is a no no.  No eating the roller ball or the bottle!  If they were to get hold of the ball it could choke the dog.  Bad design if you ask me.  OF COURSE the dog is going to want to bite the bottle if it tastes like bacon juice.<br />  I gave her a couple licks and decided to throw the rest away.  Sorry puppy.

review/summary: Two Out of Three Agree!
review/text: I have three dogs. Two of them loved it, one so much that she tried to swallow the whole bottle, or run away with it and rip into it as she might a bone. They were definitely confused by it, they weren't sure what to do with it, but once they caught the smell of bacon they couldn't get enough. The third wasn't so keen on it, but I feel like that was more because he was abused before we took him in and he doesn't like something being held in front of his face like you have to do with this treat. I did eventually get him to try some, but after one lick he refused anymore, I will attribute this to his fear rather than any misgivings he might've had about taste as he eats everything.<br /><br />I think this would work better if you have just one dog. When you pass out treats or food, sometimes squabbles can happen, and that definitely happens here when you're focus is on just one dog and the others get jealous. Also, dogs generally do prefer to grab their treat then be able to go, take it somewhere and spend some time with it, maybe hide it for later, can't really do that with this.<br /><br />This is also drippy, so be careful or you could end up with a bit of a mess.<br /><br />I'm not sure how well this would work for training though. I would probably stick with regular treats for that, but if anyone can test that, please comment and let us know if it worked!<br /><br />Edit: I noticed that my dogs try to go after pill bottles now because the bottles kind of looks like the tube (have a similar shape) so if you get this, might want to watch out for that.

review/summary: New fun treat
review/text: My dog loves this treat. She loves the taste of it and I like that it lasts a while. Other treats just do not last long with her including rawhides but with the Lickety Stik she gets approx 500 licks. She goes nuts every time I go to twist the top off of it and doesn't stop licking until I finally say that she's had enough. With any dog treat some dogs may not like it but I think it's worth a try to purchase Lickety Stik for your dog at least one time. I have found one problem with this treat which is the roller ball doesn't roll so well sometimes. It gets to one point where my dog licks it and it stops turning which annoys her and annoys me as well because I have to get my hands all messy trying to fix the roller. This is the only gripe I have with this treat but it is also why I deducted one star from the overall review.

review/summary: I question its value
review/text: My two dogs do love this product.  The dumb one found it confusing for only a few seconds, and then began licking it happily.<br /><br />The product is physically similar to roll-on deodorant.  The plastic ball works well, and will last the duration of the product.<br /><br />The product doesn't last very long in my experience.  Because the dog is not getting anything to chew, and you are not reaching into a bag of treats, I think most will see a tendency to let the dog get several good licks in.<br /><br />If you're very interested in weight loss without loosing rewards, I suppose this is a clever solution.  Otherwise, this simply is not the best value compared to many other options.

review/summary: My dog loves the taste.
review/text: I'm not sure exactly what this product is meant to be used for.  I would think it would be great to take on walks for a quick reward.  Just whip it out of your pocket and give your dog a lick.  No where on the product did I see the shelf life or how to store it.  I'm assuming it does not need to be refrigerated.  It looks just like a roll-on deodorant bottle.  It's just liver flavored gravy in a deodorant bottle. It's dispensed when the dog licks the ball.  I got the liver flavor. I don't see this lasting very long.  It's a small bottle.  There is a little "window" at the bottom of the bottle so you can see when it's almost empty.<br /><br />I could see these being used for treats in training.  "Chester" says it's great!

review/summary: great idea, but the roller ball is hard to roll
review/text: I only have i bottle (bacon flavor), so I don't know if it is typical, but the ball does not roll easily.  My dogs can get the liquid treat, but only if I squeeze the tube a bit.  And they aren't small dogs with weak tongues.  They are a Border Collie and a Labrador Retriever.  They do enjoy the treat, thought the Border Collie is not overly enthusiastic.  The Lab is enthusiastic about anything edible, even remotely, edible.  A bit messy as it drips a little when I squeeze it, but then it's not meant to have to be squeezed.  I will check other reviews and if my hard-to-move roller ball is the exception, I will be ordering more of this handy, portable treat which is easy to keep mess-free in a pocket.

review/summary: The dog likes it, but not over other treats
review/text: Who would have thought that putting stinky smelling liquid dog snack in a deodorant roller ball container would be a good idea - although I have to admit, it's a pretty good idea!  It took my dog about 2 seconds to figure out how to use this thing...just point it at your dog and let them do the licking.  Our dog liked it enough, but when giving the opportunity to either lick this, or eat a liver Bil*Jac, he went for the item that required chewing (albeit only a little chewing).  It works well enough for a quick treat, although I think that in training, it's better and (and faster) to toss my dog a small training treat instead of having to uncap and let him lick the Lickety Stik.<br /><br />On a side note, this stuff smells *really* bad (aka, your dog will like it).  I can't imagine the stench come out anytime soon, should a dog decide to rip it open on a carpet or if it leaked in a car...

review/summary: My Dogs Love It!
review/text: Lickety Stik is an all-natural dog treat that comes in a deodorant-like container with a roller ball on top.  The idea is when your dog wants a treat, you give him a few licks of this lo-cal product instead of something more fattening.  Ten licks = 1 calorie.  I wasn't sure what to think about this product at first--great idea or somewhat odd?  My dogs made the decision for me:  they love it!  In fact, when I picked up the bottle to write this review, they both came running.<br /><br />I think Lickety Stik would be especially useful if your dog is on a diet, or when you're training and don't want to give too many high-calorie treats.  This is a winner at our house.

review/text: I got this thinking my chubby lil dog might benifit from a treat that was tasty but didn't add extra lbs. She's very picky  and I wasn't sure she would take to the new style treat. She loved the Bacon flavor and the hands on attention she got while I held the bottle. Our other dogs loved the  treat as well, the only downside of the treat is that u have to hold the bottle and squeeze it gently for the dog. And one can't be.shared one dog always wants to be first.

review/summary: Dogs are undecided!
review/text: I didn't know quite what to think about this dog treat & neither did our Bichon, Biscuit, or our golden Retriever, DJ.  It is exactly like a roller ball on a deodorant bottle.  The dogs have to lick and roll the ball to get the flavor or treat.  DJ finally caught on though it took several licks to get the flavor flowing.  Biscuit still hasn't gotten the hang of licking to roll the ball.  Instead of licking the ball he tries to chew it.  He would get very frustrated when he would get a taste of the gravy, but couldn't lick hard enough to turn the ball.  He finally gave up on it & asked for another kind of treat.  DJ loves it but thought only 20 or so licks wasn't enough & also asked for something more substantial.  I guess it would be good as a treat when training a dog to do tricks or potty train.  It would be a nice reinforcement.  I also like giving the dogs a treat to keep them busy for a while, but this treat takes up my time, as I have to hold it.  I will stick to buying biscuits or other type treats.

review/summary: Gus Says: Two Paws Down
review/text: Maybe my doggie is just not smart enough for this product?? I'm not sure. It comes packaged like "Tussy" Deodorant from the old days. You roll it around and the flavor is on the ball and as your dog licks it, the flavor keeps returning. Ok, what did MY dog do? Try to take the whole bottle. No way was he going to just "lick" it... he wanted the container. I obviously couldn't give him the whole thing because he would chew it and the liquid would squirt all over. Very strange "treat". If your dog is used to taking treats from you and chewing them up, getting them to just lick might be a trick. Not for Gus.

review/summary: Lickety Stick; the lickable dog treat (just a bit odd)
review/text: My sister tried these out with one of her  dogs.  She says:<br /><br />I gave the stick a try with our small rat terrier mix, Nellie.  At first I couldn't figure out how to open it the bottle.  It looked like you pealed the wrapper off the lid area, but it wasn't coming.  Then I could see the faint perforated line around the base of the cap and you twist to break that, like a salad dressing bottle.  The stick itself is like a deodorant roll-on. Seriously.  The instructions say to shake it up before offering.  This stick was a "chicken flavor".  I offered it to Nellie, who could tell it smelled good and she tried to nibble around the roll-on top not knowing what to do.  I kind of squeezed the bottle and it made the roll-on get flavored.  She then had fun licking it and she seemed to like the stuff.  She's not very picky, so I figured she would.  The smell is not that great.  You can kind of smell it when offering it to the dog.  If you put it up close to you, it is strong, so I just kept it down at dog level.<br /><br />This is a very odd way to give a treat to a dog. But, I don't think Nellie noticed, she was too busy enjoying it.

review/summary: The dogs love them; I'm not quite as thrilled...
review/text: The dogs like the Lickety Stiks, no question about it.  After one brief attempt to just bite it, the 3-year-old settled in to licking, and the the 11-year-old understood the idea from the start (to be fair, they are both experienced with the concept of licking ice cream and the 'lick it!' reminder may have helped).  I am sure if the Stiks were left in reach, they would quickly chew into them and make a mess, so that's something of which to be careful. They did not drip when held upside down, which was pleasing.<br /><br />I am fortunate that neither of our dogs are overweight or have weight concerns; owners with chubby dogs expressed extensive enthusiasm when I asked them about the Stiks.  The younger dog is not a huge treat hound -- he can often 'take it or leave it,' and these proved no different.  I keep hoping to find the motivator that he just can't walk away from.  The Stiks didn't prove to be his Achilles heel but they are in excellent company in that regard -- both dogs clearly found them palatable and enjoyable.<br /><br />My primary use of treats is in training, and my main quibble with the Stiks is that it is hard to use them to lure... you know how you have a treat in your hand and you allow the dog to nose it but not take it while you lure them?  You can't really do that with these.  They also wouldn't be good when set on a target, as a chunk of bait is. Also, the licks of the rollerball take time, while a small, soft chunk of cheese or liver can be gulped down without any noticeable delay in the action.<br /><br />I found all three 'flavors' to be rather unpleasantly smelly -- I think the manufacturer could maybe dial back the scent and still have plenty of appeal to the dogs.  They were also kind of sticky and did leave a smear if one accidentally brushed the roller-ball dispenser across any surfaces while wielding it.  Our newest vehicle has terribly inappropriate light-colored upholstery (what were we thinking?) and the commercials for the Stiks that talk about keeping one in the car made me cringe -- I would not want these anywhere near light-colored textiles!<br /><br />I'm glad to have tried these but I don't know that I will make a point to purchase them in the future, especially at the current price point.

review/summary: Excellent training treat!
review/text: The main thing I love about this product is that its so good for use during training.  It's so much easier to carry on walks than a bag full of chopped hot dogs or dog treats.  Plus licking has been shown to have a calming effect on dogs which could make this product helpful for reactive dogs.  I like that the ingredients are all natural and there are no "iffy" ingredients.  To top it off my picky raw fed dogs love this stuff.  I'm keeping it as a training treat only to keep it special for them.  I would definitely recommend this product and plan on buying lots more!<br /><br />ETA:  I would caution against using this with totally unruly dogs.  If you think your dog would rip it out of your hand and chew it up enough to dislodge the ball I would not use this product as the ball *could* be a choking hazard.  I have pit bulls and they could tear this container apart in 2 seconds flat but they are well trained so I know they wouldn't. I would also caution against leaving it laying around where an unsupervised dog could get at it for the same reason.  But I think the benefits to this product far outweigh the potential dangers as long as your careful about it.

review/text: I recently got PetSafe Lickety Stik for my dog, and she loves it!  The product consists of a bottle filled with a flavored liquid, and whenever Tiny wants some all I have to do do is shake the bottle, remove the cap, and let her lick at the roller until she's satisfied.  There are times when she tries to bite the bottle, but I usually solve that by completely upending it so that she can't get her mouth around it.<br /><br />All in all, if you want a treat for your dog that's low on messiness as well as being something that they'll enjoy, then PetSafe Lickety Stik is a good one.

review/summary: May be best as a leash training aid
review/text: These treats are certainly a new and different idea, but ease of use needs to be improved before they can become something we'd purchase on a regular basis.<br /><br />Certainly, the concept is clever and has potential. The treats are liquid, contained in a tube with a roller ball at the top. The pet licks the ball and gets a measured dose, so to speak. But the problems begin right there.<br /><br />First, the two dogs (one medium, one large) both want to eat the tube rather than lick it, and getting the "lick but don't bite" idea across has proved a challenge. Second, you can give them one treat and then it seems the roller ball has to rotate to dispense the next treat. How do you do this? You can rotate the ball by hand, which is inconvenient and often messy. Or you can squeeze the tube and hope to get the pressure right and not spray the liquid on the ground.<br /><br />We plan on trying this as a leash training aid, a quick reward for proper behavior. The product seems ideal at least in theory for that purpose. Maybe we'll learn to use it better, but right now, it's a little more trouble than it's worth.<br /><br />By the way: We had three flavors. The dogs didn't distinguish among them so unless you have a finicky pet, choice of flavor may not matter.

review/summary: Rocky and Mr. Peabody love it! They said "Woof!"
review/text: The Bacon Flavor Lickety Stik is like crack cocaine for my dog Rocky. If I handed him the product, it would be gone--plastic and all--within 30 seconds. However, you aren't supposed to "give" your dog the Lickety Stick, which works like a roll-on deodorant, the human holds it while the dog licks it. If your dog reacts like Rocky, you'll get a big kick out of it. While the novelty won't wear off for Rocky, I have the distinct impression that I'll get bored with it after a while.<br /><br />On the other paw, Mr. Peabody seemed to enjoy it, but he wasn't as enthusiastic as Rocky. Could it be their difference in age? Mr. P. is six years old and Rocky is one. Rocky also eats everything, including light bulbs, styptic powder, and prescription eyewear, but not with as much vigor as he attacked his Lickety Stik.<br /><br />Our third dog, Charity, sniffed it, looked at me like I had serious issues, and turned away. She's seven. Based on Rocky's & Mr. P.'s enjoyment of the product, I give it five stars; but if Charity was an "only dog," it would get none.

review/summary: Hilariously awesome product!
review/text: I didn't really know what I was getting when I chose to receive this product, but I love getting my dog new things. I thought it was really funny when I opened it- it looked like a roller-style deodorant! But I tilted the product to get the juice by the roller-ball and let my dog lick it. She loved it and caught on very fast!<br /><br />If you're looking for a treat you can give to your dog and then walk away, this isn't the one. You have to hold it so that he/she can lick it; they cannot eat the plastic part. I think it's a great treat for training. It's easy to carry around and "operate" (uncap, tilt, hold in front of dog). I'm using it to teach my dog simple things...she's learning to stay right now, and so I tell her to sit, I walk away, and when I let her come to me, she gets a few licks. It works like a charm!<br /><br />Of course there's the chance that your dog may not like the flavor or might try to chew the bottle instead of licking it. If you're lucky enough to have a dog that likes it/licks it instead of chewing it, it's a great treat to add to the mix! It's something different and new!

review/summary: dogs love it
review/text: The lickety stick is not a lollipop.  It is a roller that looks similar to roll on deodorant or shoe polish.  Inside is the flavored juice.  When the dog's tongue licks the roller, the juice coats it and the dog gets a taste.  I was sent the liver flavor.  One of my dogs loved it.  He was slow at first, but once the roller got coated with the flavored juice, he just went at it.  He even tried biting it. I had a hard time getting it away from him.  My other dog was afraid of it.  I think he thought it was medicine.<br />So this is an interesting way to give a dog a treat. Kind of fun to sit there and watch him lick it like a lollipop.  My only complaint is the smell was gross.  The bacon flavor would probably smell better.

review/summary: Pros and cons...
review/text: Pros: Very low-calorie; dogs love the stuff; good for them--nutritious, all-natural.<br /><br />Cons: Stinky; can be hard to get out; you have to stand there squeezing it the whole time (so giving a normal treat is far more convenient); messy. They inevitably drip all over, so you'd better use them over an easy-to-wipe floor, or outside.<br /><br />The way it usually works for me is:<br />*squeeze...squeeze...squeeze*<br />"Where is it?"<br />*liquid starts pouring out; lands on floor because it always comes out on the opposite side of the roller-ball from the dog*<br />With luck, the dogs don't step in it too much, and I can easily go over the area with a damp cloth after pointing out the spots for them to lick up.<br /><br />It's not as "convenient" as they'd have you believe. You don't just squeeze, let the dog lick the coated ball, and recap it. This is liquid, and it's going to make a mess and require cleanup. (To be fair, regular treats can leave behind crumbs, slimy goo, etc., as well.) You can travel with it, sure, but I would sure as heck NEVER use it inside my car. Your hands can obviously still contact the sticky end and require washing, and I never feel right screwing the cap back on without first rinsing and wiping off the sticky end. If you don't make a habit of doing this, I'm certain that eventually you'll wind up in a dripping, oozing, gooey predicament. This may be cleaner for your hands than pieces of something else that may be sticky, slimy, and/or odiferous, but it's hardly the neatest thing in the world.<br /><br />Also..."no delay in presenting?" Hmm. There's typically more of a delay in waiting for the liquid to start dripping out, with the dog sniffing at it and waiting, than there is in fumbling with a treat bag in your pocket. Either way, they know what's coming to them, but speed is not really an advantage of this product.<br /><br />The very concept should make it excellent for training, especially, because that can run you through your allotted treats very quickly. Dogs really can lick as much of this stuff as they want at any given time...one lick is hardly ever enough, but always appreciated. I normally wind up squeezing every few seconds for about 30-45 seconds, maybe a minute or so. It makes a good diet snack because they get something very flavorful, less filling, and more healthful. However, it's so messy that you'd have to keep it somewhere nearby and out of reach during training, rather than inside your pocket.<br /><br />Of course, they put a positive spin on the necessity of standing there holding and squeezing the tube, saying that the administration of this treat provides a bonding time and reinforces to the dog the source of his/her treats. Well, okay. I can't call that untrue, although it is rather unnecessary for anyone whom has as strong a relationship with his/her dog(s) as I do with mine. And they are all definitely well aware of me as a provider (or slave, in the opinion of the dog with the catlike mindset.) You should see them make firm eye contact, then look back and forth from your face to the treat cabinet or room, pointing you in the desired direction! Don't get me wrong, though; it is usually pleasant to stay close to your pet, giving him/her continuous drops of scrumptious meat-flavored liquid as he/she focuses intently on that ball--instead of simply watching them snatch a traditional treat and devour it wherever they feel like at the moment.<br /><br />A marginal amount of bonding may occur while you hold onto this thing for a couple of minutes and the dog laps at the putrid-smelling goo, obviously mocking you for your deficient senses of smell and taste.<br /><br />I tried out the three-pack of liver, chicken, and bacon for my three dogs as stocking stuffers this past Christmas, and we've still got a little bit of bacon and liver left. They obviously last a decent amount of time. I wouldn't be averse to buying them again if I saw them at a fair price in a store, and was looking for a small-portion, different type of dog treat.<br /><br />I haven't used them yet as a "distraction" or "soothing" technique; I suppose this might work, although you'd clearly need someone else to administer the stick while you did the grooming or whatever you were trying to do. And I wouldn't necessarily expect a dog to keep still just because s/he was licking...not my nutters, anyway. But, it's an idea, at any rate. It might well be a good anxiety-reducing distraction. They do get pretty excited over it, so depending upon the situation, it just might have that power.<br /><br />Edit: I'm sorry, but I had to lower the rating to two stars. You're far better off dripping the tasty, low-calorie liquid onto a hard surface and letting the dog lick it up. It should be sold as a kibble gravy or something to pour into a tiny bowl, rather than as a "Lickety Stick."<br />These things really do just splatter all over the floor/ground whilst taller dogs lick SOME liquid from the ball, and shorter ones risk being hit with falling droplets. It's a good idea, but perhaps the substance needs to be thicker, or it needs to pour out neatly into a little tray, or something. Some dogs are better at catching it all before it falls, but height differences make it tricky to try and let two of them share one, if they're both willing. You can do one in each hand, sure, but of course that doubles the mess. The secret, really, is to squeeze slowly and gently, watch for where it starts to emerge, and rotate the ball so that the dog can lick it before it slides around the ball and falls.<br /><br />I somewhat doubt my likelihood to recommend or re-purchase Lickety Stiks, unless they come out with a particularly interesting new flavor, or improve the stuff itself. Furthermore, my dogs have actually begun shrinking away and ignoring them, obviously mistaking the sticks for their tubes of tooth-cleaning gel and spray--not the product's fault, naturally, but still a newly noted disadvantage worth mentioning.

review/summary: Strange Dog Treat
review/text: This is the strangest thing I've ever seen.  Imagine your roll on deodorant container  being filled with some bacon flavored  gravy and then allowing your dog to lick from it for his daily treat!  Are you kidding me?  This idea is gross and unsanitary and how do you get a dog to understand the concept that they are only supposed to take a few licks and that's their treat.  My dog kept trying to grab the container, she thought I was trying to tease her with it.  Finally I started rolling it on the dry milk bone type treats that she's not crazy about to get her to eat them.  If they called it "Dog Bone Icing" it might sell better  and make more sense.

review/summary: Mostly a product without a purpose
review/text: This might be handy for someone who wants a convenient, pocket-able, quick treat in a training situation, but otherwise I fail to see the point of this product.  Although it's low in calories, it's easier and cheaper just to use a few of the dog's kibbles for treats, subtracting them from the dinner allotment if calorie count is an issue.  If your pet doesn't eat kibble but you still want to give treats, I don't think this offers anything that any other tiny treat doesn't offer.  It's actually less convenient to hold the Lickety Stik for your dog to lick than it is to just toss a treat.<br /><br />Also, the first ingredient listed (this is the Savory Chicken flavor) is "natural chicken flavor."  Do a little reading and you'll quickly realize this doesn't necessarily mean an actual chicken was involved anywhere in this product.  Aside from that there is cultured lecithin (I have no idea what the "cultured" modifier means in this context), vitamins E and C, rosemary extract, and green tea extract.  None of this sounds harmful, but none of it sounds particularly nutritionally helpful, either.<br /><br />As far as dogs' opinions, we had an even split at my house.  Both dogs thought it smelled good and eagerly licked it initially.  One dog has not only refused it since that first taste, but actually pulls back from it when it's offered (and this is a dog that eats anything -- animal, vegetable, mineral, paper towel, cardboard...).  The other is happy to lick from it until I take it away.  I'll probably let her continue to use it until it's gone, but I don't see myself adding more of it to my pet-treat cupboard.

review/summary: Phew! We called it "Icky Stik" or "Stinky Stik"
review/text: As much as our dogs enjoyed Lickety Stik, the cloying stench of "savory chicken" repulsed the rest of the family. The odor wafted off the stick and filled the room like a musky air freshener. We called it "Icky Stik" or "Stinky Stik" as the experience was so nauseating that no one volunteered to reopen the stick, despite pleas from our dogs.<br /><br />We tested the PetSafe Lickety Stik as part of the Amazon Vine program, which is to say the product arrived free. The company sent us the Savory Chicken flavor and we tested it with our Cockapoo and Miniature Schnauzer, both adult females. Neither dog had trouble figuring out how to advance the roller ball so they could taste the liquid. One warning: if you get this stuff on your hands you'll play heck trying to wash it off.<br /><br />A collective shudder ran through the family as we wondered: if Savory Chicken smells this bad, can you imagine inhaling a deep whiff of "Braised Liver" or "Smoky Bacon"? Worse yet, the company touts the product's portability and recommends carrying it in your purse. That's a bit risk since this stuff in the bottle is hardly perfume.<br /><br />The company says Lickety Stick consists of all-natural ingredients. Here's the list from the bottle: Natural Chicken Flavors, Cultured Milk Lecithin, Mixed Tocopherois (Natural Preservative - A Source of Vitamin E), Ascorbyl Palmtate (Source of Vitamin C), Rosemary Extract, Green Tea Extract.<br /><br />In summary, with so many better options available for dog treats, we cannot recommend Lickety Stick because of its foul smell, sticky ingredients and the serious risk to your purse should the bottle leak.<br /><br />Rating: One star.

review/summary: That's what she said
review/text: This product is really dumb and pointless. My dog was simply not interested, and I was not interested in holding it in my hand while she licked it. When I ordered it, I thought I was getting something you could just give the dog, and she would entertain herself for a long time, by licking. It sounded like a good idea because my dog really likes to lick things. I give her something lick-able when I want her to go lay down and be quiet. This product is useless for that purpose. This is an interactive treat. You and your dog both have to interact with it. It gets old, pretty much immediately.<br /><br />The product itself is gross. It's sticky and unappealing. The smell is nauseating. My dog would take a sniff, and sometimes a trial lick, and then just walk away. I'd be left standing there holding a phallic shaped bottle of mysterious smelly goo.<br /><br />Here are some things my dog likes better than Lickety Stiks: dirty diapers, dead pigeons, week-old garbage, and other dog's butts.<br /><br />The only people who really enjoyed the product are the teenagers in my house, who think "Lickety Stik" is possibly the most hilarious product name they ever heard. The jokes lasted most of the afternoon. The packaging offers plenty of crude suggestions ("give a lick" tm  they trademarked that??), as if my kids needed any encouragement. Even the shape of the bottle - a rigid cylinder with a ball on top - was fodder for hilarity. They thought it was just so funny.<br /><br />So this is a stupid product with a funny name and a suggestive shape, which solves no problems, has no appeal beyond comedy, and is completely worthless.

review/summary: Pointless dog treat
review/text: Are we seriously supposed to stand there for hours and hold this bottle up in the air while the dog licks it? This is the new wave of dog "treats"??<br /><br />To be honest, when I ordered this, I kind of missed the whole "Likety Stik" wording on the bottle. I mean I definitely saw the "Likety" wording, but didn't pay any attention to the "Stik" part. I saw that it was bacon flavored, so I assumed it was a bacon flavored substance almost like a gravy to pour over your dog's food, especially by the shape of the bottle.<br /><br />When it arrived, I was like what the heck is this?? At first glance you would almost assume it is roll-on deodorant, but then you see the picture of the dog in the middle of the bottle, so you know it can't be.<br /><br />But I did try giving this to all 3 of my dogs. None of them knew what to do with it and seemed aggrevated when they licked the ball and nothing would come out. I then figured out I had to squeeze the bottle to make the contents drip out. When I did that, they stopped licking, looked at the ball, took one whiff and turned their noses up in the air as if to say "ewwww get this thing outta my face right now"!!<br /><br />I find that dogs (mine anyway) like to chew, so they kinda don't know what to do with this odd invention. They aren't rabbits who drink water from a water bottle. This reminded me of something like that. This is for an animal who is used to licking from a rolling ball. You can't exactly give it to a dog, then let them go off on their own with it like a normal treat or a bone, because rather than licking the ball, they would want to investigate what it's made of and would chew it to bits until the contents fell out. In my opinion, not a very good idea and could potentially be very dangerous. I really don't see the point in this item at all, unless of course you are a rabbit.

review/summary: It's soooo weird!  Doesn't dispense well.
review/text: Okay, first of all, be sure you note the design.  This liquid treat comes in a liquid-deodorant-type container. The idea seems to be that you just have the dog lick it directly off the roller ball.  This plan happens to be a poor plan.  The roller ball doesn't roll freely.  So, I wind up sticking my fingers on the ball to help it roll--thereby getting nasty liver smells on my hands. I do have the liver flavor only; I *thought* Vine was sending one of each flavor, but we just got liver, so my dog has only "taste tested" this one flavor.  She approved heartily of the taste.  Scored big wags.  These are low cal, but unless your dog is on a particularly restricted diet, she/he should be able to spare a few calories a day for treats (there are several 2-10 calorie per treat options out there, like Zukes and Mother Hubbard Minis.  Good old fashioned green beans make good, all natural, dog treats, too).  If it dispensed more easily, I would have given this  four stars instead of only two.  But the combination of it's oddity and having to finagle the roller ball with each use lost it at least one star.  Personally, I rate it two stars; my dog however gave it five (she basically likes food in general, though, and she's never met a treat she didn't like).

review/summary: Too confusing for my dog
review/text: I decided to try this "treat" with my new dog. I am trying to teach her different responses and thought that a treat that did not add calories to her diet would be a good idea.<br /><br />I introduced the treat to her and she ignored it at the beginning. The shape of the container is of one of the old fashioned roll-on deodorants. I moved the ball around to get some of the liquid on it and re-introduced it to my dog. She liked the flavor but was frustrated with it as the ball gets stuck. She tried a few times and ended up yanking the container from my hand and running away with it.<br /><br />She is a very fast dog and when I caught up with her she had managed to rip the ball of the container. Lucky for me she did not swallow the ball as I think it could have killed her. I picked up the ball and threw it away. I could not get container from her as she was busy using it as a chew toy.<br /><br />I will not be buying this product for her as it is hard to use and I do not think that she should be chewing on plastic. The contents were delicious to her as they were a chicken based.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product.

review/summary: what a strange idea
review/text: Well when I ordered this product for my dogs I had high hopes that this would be something that they might like.  The concept is that the product looks like a deodorant roll on...if you remember those.  You take the top off, and then there is a roll over which the gravy-like product is dispensed.  The gravy is thick and difficult to get to start dispensing.  Once it does start coming out of the sides of the roller ball, the process of it coming out is inconsistent.  Sometimes it comes out slowly,  then sometimes you have to shake the bottle a  good bit to encourage the gravy to come out around the roll.  This usually means that you are having to futz around with this dog treat much more than you would like to have to.  The dogs also got a little discouraged with the process as well.  They would actually walk off and give up on me with a frustrated look on their face as if to say that this was hardly worth it.

review/summary: Interesting product, but I'm not quite sure what to do with it
review/text: I am only reviewing the bacon flavor (was supposed to get 3 different flavors, but only got one).<br /><br />The good news is that my dog went crazy over this.  He absolutely loved it!  I have literally never seen him get this excited about a treat.  Unfortunately, that is also the bad news.  Because he loved it so much, and because he got so excited, it was a pointless exercise trying to get him to just lick the top.  He would take a lick or two, then he would start hopping and jumping, and trying to grab the entire bottle out of my hand.<br /><br />I have 11 and 10 year old daughters, and they normally love giving the dog a treat.  They won't give him this anymore, because it gets the dog hyper excited, and he starts jumping on them trying to get the treat out of their hands.<br /><br />So......whatever the ingredient inside the bottle is, my dog loves it, and I suppose yours will too.  The only question is the delivery system.  Maybe its not the best idea to have a treat that is meant to be held like this one is.  It assumes that your dog will sit quietly while you hold the bottle and he licks the top. No way that will ever happen with my dog.  He looks at it as he does any treat....he thinks it is meant to be taken and eaten.<br /><br />I debated on giving the product a 3 (because I don't think I will ever buy it for the reasons noted above) or a 4 (because my dog loves the flavor).  Ultimately I gave it a 4.  If my dog loves it, how could I give it a 3.<br /><br />**Update 10-5-11**Despite the fact that my dog loves the taste of this thing, I took it down to a 3 star rating.  Nothing really has changed, except for the fact that I am finding this to be more of a pain than I originally thought.  It was a novelty at first, but now I am weary of fighting the dog over this thing and trying to keep him from biting and chewing it (and creating a choking hazard or a mess).  Can't recommend it.<br /><br />**Update 10-9-11**I feel foolish writing another update on this product, but this is my last one.  My dog has gotten the hang of using this product, and now does a pretty good job of licking versusing chewing.  Also, this is one of his favorite treats. I am surprised, because my dog loves to chew, so I would have thought that a licking treat wouldn't hold much interest for him.  I am now thinking I would buy this product again ***but*** not at an $8 price point.  Way too expensive, relative to what you get.  The package says you get 500 licks.  In about 30 seconds, my dog get in 10-15 licks.  He does this twice a day, so this thing is not going to last 3 weeks at my house.  For me to buy this, it would have to be in the $2-3  price range.  I have to imagine that if they can sell deoderant in this price range (and this thing is identical to roller ball deoderant), then they can sell liquid dog treats in this price range.

What I received is one lick stick, not three. My Dobie loves Bacon and Liver so I was really looking forward to receiving both and figured he may be interested in the chicken as well. When I opened the envelope and saw just one lick thing I looked at the shipping invoice and it said that the one stik was bacon flavor. So, although puzzled at the lack  of the other two stiks I figured that at least he was getting to lick one of his favorite flavors. Not to be. The tiny bottle, about the size and apprearance of a small roll-on deodorant stick, was labeled "Savory Chicken Flavor". I figured I would give it a try and held it for my Dobie to lick. He gave me a scornful look indicating that he failed to find it "Savory" and walked away. I tried several more times but he began to give me a look that meant his patience was running thin. He is a large Dobie and very strong so I heeded his message and apologized by giving him a treat that ensured his forgiveness. The lack of receiving three sticks, the shipping invoice labeled as bacon flavored and the actual tiny bottle of disgusting chicken something are all a mystery to me.

Only instead of fresh-scented anti-persperant, it was drippy, smelly, bacon-flavored dog juice.<br /><br />So I guess you're supposed to stoop down and hold the roll-on bottle in front of the dog while it licks the roller ball to get the dog juice on its tongue. You're supposed to do this without yacking from the smell. Meanwhile, there's a million dog treats out there that you can throw to the dog and he runs off and eats it and you're not doing deep knee bends to apply dog juice roll-on to your dog's already funky tongue.<br /><br />To say nothing of the fact that the dog just wants to take it and bite it. Like a dog would do.<br /><br />Try again. Fail.

We had 3 flavors of Stiks, Bacon, Chicken and Liver.  We tried all three on both Sundae and Casey.  Sundae licked all three and seemed to like them all. Casey, however, wouldn't try any of the three, just turning his head in apparent disgust (lol).  Having had dogs my whole life, you never can tell what a dog will like or dislike.  I didn't give this 5 stars, because of some functional reasons, not because Casey didn't even try it.  First, the lick ball is exactly like a deodorant ball. As a matter of fact, the container reminds me of an Arrid Rollerball Deodorant bottle exactly.  It doesn't move freely by just licking, you have to gently squeeze the bottle for the liquid to be available to the dog.  If you squeeze too hard, it drips onto the floor. Other than that, it seems to be enjoyable.  It is supposed to be healthy, but I had to use a magnifying glass to read the rather small label.<br /><br />The video is one of our taste tests. Hope you enjoy it.

review/summary: Best tool for puppy training!
review/text: We have a new puppy, and are attempting to train her using a rewards-based system. This works well, except that we don't feel comfortable giving her treat after treat after treat. Then, along came the Lickety Stik, and it solved our problem! Our puppy LOVES this, and it's become an invaluable training tool. We have bought several in different flavors and keep them in different rooms around the house. When our puppy is doing something she shouldn't be doing, we give her the appropriate command ("Off," "Wrong," "Leave It" etc.). If she does what she's asked, we say "Good Girl!" grab the Lickety Stik, and she gets a couple of licks. This has worked amazingly well, and we're not stuffing the puppy with treats. There are some times when we feel she'll continue the bad behavior just to get a Lickety Stik, but that's the same with any treat. To solve this, once we know she understands the command, if she continues to do the behavior, she doesn't get the treat. She soon realizes that to get the Lickety Stik, she has to not do the behavior at all.<br /><br />Of course, your dog may be different, but this has been our experience.<br /><br />Also, my daughter is working at a local pet store as a grooming assistant, and she tells me that they have started using the Lickety Stik there to help calm their dogs and curb bad behavior while they're being groomed. I felt that was a pretty good endorsement right there.

review/summary: I love it
review/text: I am a veterinarian with 7 years experience, and I have 3 Great Danes.  I am always looking for safe, effective, fun, and innovative new pet products.  I saw the video for this product, and definitely agree that carrying a pocketful of crumbling treats isn't much fun for training/rewards, so decided to give it a try.  All 3 of my girls tried to bite the bottle at first (and I think most dogs will), but within a few seconds, all of them figured it out, and were licking away very happily, each taking their turn sitting down for me.  I also recently used it to help keep them standing still while my 8 year old daughter gave them baths outside with the hose on a nice warm day....much less mess than doing it in the tub inside!  It was also handy when we went for a short hike at a local park a while back, as I am training the 2 younger Danes to wear backpacks (that's a whole other story!).  Even if the dogs jump in the river wearing their backpacks and get them soaked, their treats won't get soggy.  The only thing I would like to see is using a liquid treat that's maybe a bit healthier for them...the ingredient list on the Lickety Stik looks like a lot of processed stuff.  It does have a bit of an odor, too, but I didn't find it that strong or offensive like some of the other people here did.  And I think it's the odor that really draws the dogs to come check it out...otherwise, why would they want to just lick a plastic roller ball?<br />Also, I think it would be nice to have a bottle that is just a little bit larger for the large/giant breeds like mine...but this does work well regardless.  Finally, I think it would be great to have a refillable bottle, so there would be less waste...500 licks goes fast when you're training 3 big dogs!<br />Oh, and yes, I will re-order this, and do recommend it.

review/summary: Lickety good fun
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:29 Mins<br /><br /></span>*disclaimer* I was sent this item to review.<br />Izzy, our mini schnauzer, is very food motivated. Schnauzers have a tendency to get chunky though, so rewarding her with food every time she does a trick is a balancing act between giving her something she likes but not having her snack with treats all day.<br /><br />At 1 calorie per 10 licks, along with a fun interactive way to give her the treat, the lickety safe is fun and healthy. She had no trouble at all figuring out how to lick the deodorant like ball. This would also be a nice travel treat in the car because it closes up and you don't need to get treat on your fingers to give it to the dog.

review/summary: Awesome treat!
review/text: What I really like about this treat is that it is something you hold while your dog licks it--rather than him taking his chewy someplace and getting busy with it, he ends up looking at me, holding my gaze for as long as I'll let him keep lickin' that rollerball. Awesome for my friend's dog who's old and can't chew. (This is the liver flavor--which smells awesome. The bacon did not ship, but my pup doesn't mind.)

review/summary: Puppy Loves it!
review/text: I thought this looked interesting a liquid dog treat what? So I purchased it, I have two small dogs a seven year old Yorkie and a seven month old puppy Bichon Frise/ Toy Poodle mix. Well I showed it to the puppy I got the liver flavor it does smell bad and let him sniff it he went wild and starting jumping towards my hand trying to get it and barking like crazy I told him sit and paw and he did  and I give him a lick he loved it. Now my Yorkie sniffed it and walked away but she is extremely picky about her treats so it did not surprise me at all. I love how this is small can fit in a jacket and is about the length of your hand opened, this is low in calories 1 calorie in 10 licks and the bottle has 500 licks! this is great I clicker train my puppy and he knows a bunch of tricks but I always felt Like I was filling him up with a ton of treats and then would have to feed him less dinner and I felt bad. But with this I no longer have to worry now it can be messy if your not careful don't squeeze too hard, I will definitely be getting more of this and trying it in different flavors for my Pup Mozart. This is also great for teaching small dogs to heel to stay by your left side and it is great to use outside when the puppy gets distracted by people or other dogs kids etc I can refocus his attention on me and get him to calm down.

review/summary: VERY stinky but my dogs LOVED it
review/text: This is a really fun idea! It is a fun treat to give them, and my dogs REALLY like it. The reason why I am giving it a low rating, is because it stinks, really bad! The smell is so offensive that my boyfriend won't let me feed this treat to my dogs while he's around. If my dogs didn't love the taste, and if it wasn't so much fun to feed to them, it would be in the garbage. I won't be buying it again, and don't recommend it. However, if you ever find it on sale or find a free sample or something, it is kind of a fun thing to try ONCE. Another issue is the fact that it comes in bacon and beef flavors, which can (and did) stain their mouths and cause dark tear stains.

review/summary: Didn't work so well for me
review/text: I think this product might work well in some situations.  For me, my dog was very small when I got it, and right after receiving it, he needed to be trained without treats.  Then, when he was 9 months old, about 4 months after receiving the product, I decided to try it again, as he was at that age where he knows he should come when called, but is a bit defiant about it.  By then, the stuff in the bottle had gotten a bit thick, and the roller didn't work too well.  I used it a little anyway, just forcing the ball to roll with my finger, but I then left it in my coat pocket, and when I wasn't paying attention, Archie bit into the pocket and crushed the bottle and it oozed out inside my pocket - arghh!  Not the product's fault, obviously.  It could definitely work, but I think I will just stick with the old standard kibbles in a plastic bag for now anyway.

review/summary: Might Be Good For Smaller Dogs - Not My 3 Large Ones.
review/text: I have 3 larger dogs - labs and golden retrievers, and I wanted to try this out with them, but it turned out to be basically useless.  None of them can understand that they're not supposed to eat the bottle, and only 1 of my dogs will continue to lick it after he realizes he can't have it.  Another of my dogs got so frustrated with it that she refuses to even lick it if I bring the bottle out.<br /><br />It was an interesting idea, and exactly what it said it was, but, unfortunately, it was a failure at my house.  I can see where it might be useful for smaller dogs or puppies, but definitely not for my dogs.

review/summary: Dogs like it more than I like giving it to them.
review/text: My dogs love this.  But it's undeniably odd.  Basically, it's packaged like those old roller bottles of deodorant.  You hold the it in front of your dog's face and they lick the rollerball.<br /><br />One of my dogs wanted nothing to do with it, but my puppy (who'll lick anything) dove right in.  That lured the wary dog into trying it.  Now they both love it.<br /><br />Frankly, though, I suspect they'd prefer food.  And I certainly like tossing treats to my dogs for them to catch instead of standing there like a servant holding what looks like a bottle of deodorant as they lick it.<br /><br />Might be good for dogs on a diet, though. You can treat them with a bit of flavor without so many calories.

It works great and now my girl looks forward to receiving a few tasty licks (her spoonful of sugar!) after taking her medicine. Great, innovative product, at a good price.

review/summary: Dispenser doesn't work well...
review/text: This is a clever idea. Give your dog a treat by offering a lick or two of a bacon flavored liquid he or she will like. Take the cap off the bottle and there is a large ball similar to a roll-on deodorant ball - offer it to your dog and he'll lap it up. This appears to be an actual roll-on deodorant container that has been repurposed for this product. The problem is that the ball doesn't rotate freely. Our dog can't make the ball turn with his tongue. When I roll it with my thumb so he can get more, I have to go wash my hands as the liquid is brown and sticky. So - a mediocre rating because the product IDEA is good, but the container doesn't work well.

review/summary: Beagle loves it but it stinks!
review/text: Got this for my 9 year old beagle.  She "expects" treats anytime she comes back in from outside and has pretty much figured out how to work that system with my 4 year old so she gets treats every 5 minutes (really need to figure out a better lock for the back door!).  I saw this Lickety Stik and the concept seems good.  I had read some reviews about certain dogs not liking this product at all but that is not the case with my beagle.  In fact, she LOVES this stuff and will sit near the counter staring up at it.  My only issue with this product is that it really stinks....and I mean really stinks!!  I try to quickly open it, let my beagle take a few licks and then close it as quickly as possible.<br /><br />It works very similar to how a roll on deoderant would work so if you haven;t used it for a few days, it may take some manual intervention to get the top of the ball wet enough to turn on its own.  I don't have any issues as my dog can easily get it started using her tounge.<br /><br />I will most likely try the other flavors of this since my dog likes it so much.  Plus, assuming this product is accurate in its description, cutting back on the fatty treats she normally gets will be a benefit to her health.

review/summary: She just doesn't want it
review/text: I was given a bottle of the savory bacon flavor for the purpose of trying it out and reviewing it. I've tried on several occasions both with the bottle and with putting some on my fingers in case it was how it is dispensed that was bugging her and my dog just wants nothing to do with it.<br /><br />I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 because the concept is interesting and also because my dog is very picky. It's not the first time she's refused a treat, so I didn't think it merited a star rating quite so bad as "I hate it."<br /><br />I won't be buying any, though, unless she has a radical change of heart very soon.

review/text: Our dog is a hugh White English Bulldog about 3 ft tall and 6 feet long. She loves bacon and loves the flavor of this, but she tries to bite and take the bottle away.<br />The bottle is a roller ball like roll on deodorant, and being a big dog she could choke on this if she did get it in her mouth, which is why we give 4 stars. she loves water out of squeeze bottle and would think this would do better in that type of bottle.<br /><br />I would reccommend this for small to medium dogs, but not for the Mastif breeds.

review/summary: I think they're out of ideas for dog treats...
review/text: I received my Lickety Stik bacon flavored dog treat from the Amazon Vine Program, free in exchange for writing a review.<br /><br />I thought this product was a kind of stick, based on the name of it. Instead it's a flavored liquid in a bottle with a roller ball something like a deodorant applicator.<br /><br />We have a beagle who loves treats and loves to chew.  I thought he would like this treat simply because I was giving it to him.  He did understand that he had to lick the ball to get the flavor, but he wasn't impressed.  Two sniffs, three licks and he was done.<br /><br />I don't think this treat is safe for dogs unless you stand there and hold it for them.  Any chewing on their part will either separate the roller ball from the end and choke them, or their teeth will puncture the container and the liquid will go everywhere.  It's certainly not a treat you can give them and turn your back.<br /><br />I much prefer treats that they can totally eat, and I can't see this "rollerball" treat being very popular with pet owners.

review/summary: I'm not sure what to think . . . and neither does my dog
review/text: I was surprised when opening the package this product came in and found this "Lickety Stik" device.  It looks like a bottle of roll-on deodorant and that's how it works.  My first dog liked it and figured out she is supposed to lick it, but my other dog wasn't sure what to do with it and wanted to chew it.  This is worrisome because if he got hold of it, he may turn it into a bunch of plastic slivers and I wouldn't want him swallowing those.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik treat is a new concept and I understand the idea, but I don't think it's quite there yet.  It's also a little unusual to stand there holding the pets' treat.  Usually, when giving a pet a treat, I expect to get a few minutes of peace and quiet while he/she is enjoying the treat. There are no directions on the bottle, so I wasn't sure how to use it at first, but it didn't take long to figure out.  You just hold it in front of the dog and they have to do the figuring.<br /><br />I probably won't be buying this again.

I taught her to recycle using this, and she goes out of her way to find stuff to recycle so she can get some.  It's like feeding a baby lamb out of a bottle.  If you have trouble getting the stuff to come out, squeeze it a little because that gets a little more on the roller ball, maybe that will encourage them to just lick and not chew.  My dog even has fun selecting which flavor we're going to open next.

review/summary: great for grooming
review/text: I was resorting to the old trainer's trick of smearing peanut butter on the fridge or a plastic stool, so my new rescue dog could happily lick it off while I brushed him. It worked but it was very messy. Lickety Stik works much better, although I do generally need a helper to hold it while I groom. The big test will come when I next take him to the vet and bring LS along--will it work the same while he's getting his temperature taken? Or will the experience of the thermometer ruin the treat for him? If the former, I'm sure all the vets and techs at our clinic will be ordering this stuff! I was a little concerned with the stuff upsetting my dogs' digestive systems: the new guy has an  iron gut it seems but my other dog has a sensitive tummy. She, however, had some (inserted herself while I was grooming the newbie) and was o.k. We were using liver flavor. Overall, I'm very impressed so far and ordering some more.

review/summary: BUYER BEWARE
review/text: This product should have more explicit warnings on the packaging. My husband and I bought this as a treat for our 55 lb Doberman/Boxer mix. He loved the flavor and it served as a great distraction if we wanted to clean his ears or trim his dew claws. Unfortunately, with one swift bite he popped the roller ball into his mouth and down his throat. We needed to rush him to the emergency room where they induced vomiting and then monitored closely for 2 days at home until he threw it up on his own .... After surfing the internet we found numerous other claims with people having the same issue- some even needing to spend a few thousand on procedures to remove the ball.  Additionally, customer service for this company was a HUGE disappointment.  They were unshmpathetic and kept on about how it was not meant for chewing.

review/summary: A Nice Alternative to Dog Treats
review/text: My dogs can pack on the pounds quickly especially during the winter month so I am always on the look for low calorie alternatives to dog treats that they can enjoy without gaining unwanted weight.  These Lickety Stiks are interesting to say the least.  Much like an ink pen, the dogs roll the ball with their tongues to get the flavored water out.  The package claims only one calorie per ten licks (and over 500 licks per bottle) so that is really nice.  The first couple times I tried on both my dogs, they would give I a sniff, then a couple licks because trying to grab it out of my hand with their mouths.  But after a couple uses they no like try to take it and lick.<br /><br />One major problem with the Lickety Stik, or at the very least the liver flavor is that the smell is extremely strong, which is a big problem because liver does not smell very well,  and gets stronger with every lick to the point it starts to make my eyes water and stinks up the entire room.  Also, after prolonged inactivity, the liquid solidifies on the ball making it harder if not impossible for the dogs to use, but that is easy to remedy with a little warm water.  Once, or if, you get past the smell, this is a good alternative to fatty dog treats.

review/summary: Simple and effective.
review/text: I have a three month old pug puppy who is incredibly food motivated.  Carrying around treats on a walk while I'm leash training him can be a hassle to fish out without spilling the rest or getting crumbs in my pockets.  We received a free sample of Lickety Stik at our puppy training class because of a pug's tendency to pack on the pounds and I was really surprised at how quickly the puppy took to it.  He will do tricks and readily follow on the leash to get a lick of this treat and becomes excited when he sees the bottle.<br /><br />The main drawback to this thing is that it stinks to high heaven and if I get a strong whiff of it the thing makes me gag.  The dog loves it, however so I am really considering buying more of this product in the future.

review/summary: Great Product, great training aid
review/text: I got the Lickety Stik through the Vine Program.  I was a little skeptical upon ordering.  I have two dogs that both need daily medications and they also get vitamins.  It was always a battle to get them to take either and had to revert to the shove down the throat and blow on the nose tactic.  That is until now.  Put a little of this stuff on whatever they need to take and wham gone down the throat.  It took about a week and then I stopped using it and the dogs now take their pills without any treatment.  Highly recommend and made my life a little easier.

review/summary: Still not sure....
review/text: I have been giving my dog this for several weeks as a treat and am not sure if she is really getting any juice or she just loves the smell. It is hard to tell if the ball is turning when she licks it or if it remains stationary. She always comes running when she sees me pull it out the pantry so I assume that she is still getting her 'treat'. I do like the size of the container, but wish that I could tell how much is remaining.

review/summary: Okay, but did not satisfy my dog
review/text: I tried several times to get my jack russell terrier to use this treat, but he prefers chewing on something rather than licking his treats.  The only treat he has patience with licking is a little cup of  doggie ice cream.  Even ice cubes he will crunch instead of lick.  I was also a little bit bothered by the smell of the product; there was an oily odor to it.  This treat may work for little dogs or dogs who have more patience but sadly not my dog.  It is a good effor though.

review/summary: STINKY!
review/text: This is a really fun idea! It is a fun treat to give them, and my dogs REALLY like it. The reason why I am giving it a low rating, is because it stinks, really bad! The smell is so offensive that my boyfriend won't let me feed this treat to my dogs while he's around. If my dogs didn't love the taste, and if it wasn't so much fun to feed to them, it would be in the garbage. I won't be buying it again, and don't recommend it. However, if you ever find it on sale or find a free sample or something, it is kind of a fun thing to try ONCE. Another issue is the fact that it comes in dark flavors, which can (and did) stain their mouths and cause dark tear stains.

review/text: Many of these reviews seemed to be confused. This Stik if really created and used for training dogs/puppies. It is much easy to give them a quick lick when they walk next to you instead of giving them lots of treats or clicks. This product is a god-send. My puppy loves it and walks much better on the leash as a result. Also, just because you dog doesn't like the taste doesn't mean this deserves a poor review. Dogs have different tastes! For what this does, it deserves a better rating.

review/summary: Good but Not Good Enough for My Picky Dog
review/text: Likety Stik is a great product for some dogs obviously, but Foxy, my ten-year-old standard poodle, is not interested. She first thought she was to take the entire container into her mouth. When I didn't give her the opportunity to try to swallow the whole thing, she tasted the juice on the ball. Deciding it was pretty good, she looked around to see if any other dogs might just have happened to come by for a visit. She is a picky eater. When she reacts by looking to see if any other dogs are around, it is evident that something is extra tasty. If she really, really likes something super tasty, she doesn't take the time to look around for other dogs. She has licked it a few times, but she seems somewhat reluctant. The low-calorie idea is neat, but my picky eater needs all the calories she can get.<br /><br />From a people's perspective it seems a good product, but no matter how much I shake it, I find it necessary to turn the ball manually to make the juice available. It would be fun to try this stick on a dog with more enthusiasm about food.<br /><br />Four stars.

review/summary: He likes it (and licks it) but sticky ball
review/text: Our dog really likes this thing.  It smells like it is full of flavor, and he seems to really enjoy licking the thing for as long as I'll hold it for him.  If you are unfamiliar, the flavored juice in the container is released each time the dog licks a small ball at the tops of the container; as the ball spins, it gets covered in the juice, which the dog licks off, etc.  So, well done!  My one beef with the product, though, is that the ball is a little tough to get spinning until it is fully lubricated, which means that I often have to use my fingers to get it started, which isn't ideal because I don't want to get any of the flavored juice on me.  That said, my dog is a big fan of this product.  So, while I think this is a good product, I'm giving it four stars because I think the delivery mechanism (ie the ball) isn't the best, and could be improved upon.

review/summary: My dog didn't like it
review/text: My dog is a bit shy about eating in front of people, so I should have known that he would not like these.  He didn't.  He looked at me like I was crazy.  I tried to make him try it, but he resisted and then I felt bad about doing it.<br /><br />One time during a bad storm he was hiding under my desk and he licked it and seemed to like it, but I haven't got him to do it since.<br /><br />I think the product is probably good - and there's a lot in it and it looks safe enough - it's like a deodorant roller ball - but my dog is just too shy.<br /><br />My cat liked it.  I wasn't sure how good it was for cats though so I didn't let her try it again.  They should make these for cats though - I had a cat that would lick her fur off, this would have been great to help divert her.<br /><br />It's a lot neater to keep in your pocket than regular treats.  It would be great for training a dog if you had a dog that would lick it.

review/summary: Lickin it all night long
review/text: My dogs seem to find Likety Stik extremely tasty as demonstrated by their desire to keep licking it. On my part, however, there are some reservations.  I have the liver flavor and for one, it is one of the worst smelling doggie treats that I have.  Not too sure if people want to carry this around in their purse. The stick works like a rollerball, like some of the anitperspirants you see out on market.  When you first open, it does not roll very easily, but eventually it will get going after your dog licks it a few times.  The second major reservation that I have is that if it is being licked, then the part my dog just licked cleaned, saliva and all, goes back into the fluid reservoir which doesn't seem too clean to me. Some may argue that this shouldn't make any difference to my dog who loves licking his hooha and whose favorite appetizer is cat poop, but I cannot help to think that this may be a festering ground for bacteria.  This may be prevented by having certain chemicals present that inhibit this possibility, but then it loops back to my concern of feeding these to my dog.  Although novel, I don't really see a benefit of having this as a treat other than the caloric count.

review/text: I tried this product on a new dog I had in training, because I liked the idea of a liquid for increased reward value.  It has turned out to be a great reward for many dogs I work with as well as a great reward in numerous situations.  In many performance sports you need to be very careful when rewarding your dog on a practice field that there are no crumbs left behind.  This product is PERFECT!!  I also don't need to worry about my pockets getting eaten out of my pants after training.<br /><br />My advice is to watch the price you pay here!!!!  I buy mine locally at less than 1/2 the price you see advertised here.  Even Petsafe will sell it to you for $8.99 not $13!!!<br /><br />Otherwise certainly a 5 star product!!!!!

review/summary: Dogs Give it 5 Stars Each
review/text: We have two little dogs and they have shared the licks.  I can't speak to the taste, but I feel like I'm giving them puppy crack because they became very upset when I put the stick up.<br /><br />As a human, I'm a little less enthused about the whole thing.  First, it's more like a bottle of shoe shine than a bottle of deodorant.  So, as you turn it upside down, you have to squeeze the bottle a smidge to bring the liquid to the ball.  Squeeze too hard, and your dog will get a face full of Lickety Stik juice.  The dog doesn't mind, though.<br /><br />Both dogs started to try to chew the bottle.  They sort of got the hang of it, but I'm not sure that I'm giving them a life lesson here or anything.  It's certainly not worth the patience, for instance, used in showing a toddler how to drink from a straw.<br /><br />Still, as a novelty, I'm cool with this.  I really do think the dogs will get militant when the bottle runs out, though.  For all I know, it's just sugar water, but whatever it is, they really like it.

review/summary: Great idea, flawed execution
review/text: I love the idea of the Lickety Stik:  a dog treat without all the extra calories.  Unfortunately, the design of this product makes it difficult to use.  The roller ball is very firmly fitted into the top so that it doesn't really roll.  It's mostly stuck in one position unless I manipulate it with my fingers (which are then covered in a strongly-smelling liquid that is difficult to wash off).  My two dogs quickly figured out what to do with this "treat", and they will lick and lick, but nothing comes out unless I either (1) squeeze the bottle to force the liquid out (which then usually drips onto the floor) or (2) move the roller ball with my fingers.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great concept that needs a little tweaking in the execution.

The westie loved it, however my Min-Pin would have nothing to do with it. Maybe that's because another dog licked it, however that's doubtful as most dog I've met aren't that fussy. Its kind of a cool idea but I think a dog biscuit works just as well. One other caveat, it looks like the same bottle that roll-on deodorant comes in so make sure you know for sure what you're smearing on your arm-pits or you could attract some unwanted attention

I figure it's a lot cheaper than conventional treats and not as messy as wet ones.  You do have to squeeze the fluid out sometimes so if they aren't ready for it, it drips.  If you aren't over a rug or other cloth surface it's not a problem, because they'll lick it off the floor.  I do have to keep it out of reach when I'm not using it because I'm afraid they'd jump up when I'm not looking and run off with it for me to discover it all chewed up with a stained carpet under it!

review/summary: Unique treat for dogs
review/text: This is the most unique dog treat I've seen. The liquid treat is dispensed from a container that reminds me of a large lip gloss tube with a roller. I've given this unique dog treat "4 stars" instead of five as an average based on the varied reactions from my two small dogs. The smaller Malti-poo loved the treat and from his reaction would give it "5 stars". He immediately licked the roller, received the treat, and wanted more. Our Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a pickier eater in general and wouldn't even try it at first. He finally did, but didn't seem to like it. We have the chicken flavor and it may be he just didn't like the flavor.<br /><br />Since our Malti-poo likes it so much, I have just ordered the three-pack that has chicken, liver, and bacon flavors. The three-pack is a better value than the individual packs and I'm hoping our Cavalier will like one of the other flavors better than the chicken. This is a unique idea to reward dogs with a treat without filling them up like traditional dog treats.<br /><br />** Update:  I ordered the three-pack and my Cavalier definitely likes the bacon flavor much better than chicken!

review/summary: Fantastic Product
review/text: I came across this PetSafe Lickety Stik and decided to give it a try.  We just got an 8 week old Bassett Hound puppy and decided to try out this Lickety Stik as a training reward due to its low calorie content.  Bassets are know to get fat quick so a low calorie reward is needed as Bassetts basically only respond to food.<br /><br />Basically, this thing has the same construction as a stick of roll-on deodorant.  You turn it upside down, the liquid inside saturates the ball in a second or so and your dog takes a lick or two of the ball.  It works fantastically for training a puppy or dog.  We got the bacon flavor and she absolutely loves it.<br /><br />The puppy loves it and will do anything to get a lick of this thing.  It smells terrible to us(a really disguisting rancid bacon odor)but she absolutely adores it.  The price of $8 may seem a little high, but we've have been using the same Stik for over a month now, numerous times each day and we still have a third of it left.  We will definitely be buying more of these.<br /><br />Lickety Stik is a fantastic product that is great for training or just a treat.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Good idea for certain dogs/needs, but...
review/text: As other reviewers have mentioned, this looks like a bottle of roll-on deodorant. It's not quite what I was expecting. You have to squeeze it a little to get the liquid to flow, and then the dog can lick at the roller ball, similarly to how a hamster would drink from its water bottle. It works well enough, and my dog likes the taste okay. It seems to bother her that she can't chew on it, and it bothers me that I can't just hand it to her and let her go to town on it. Yes, it's convenient and non-messy to carry around. For my dog, the low-calorie aspect isn't necessarily a good thing. For example, when I take her on a hike, she runs around like crazy, so I actually want her to get some calories from her treats. The other times I give her treats, I'm usually giving her something chewy that will help remove dental plaque. So overall, this isn't a great option for my particular dog. If your dog has a weight problem and you like to give it treats, this is probably a good alternative for you. This isn't something that I'll purchase again myself.

I shudder to think what would happen if you let the roller dry out, dog ends up with a tounge rash trying to push the roller past the dried out spot... or worse, squeeze to hard and drip doggie treat juice all over!! I'm just saying...  :)<br /><br />All in all, worth a try for the dog that has everything or just needs a change of taste...<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay

review/text: Like other reviewers have said, this may take a short time for your dog to get used to. The dog learns to lick the roller ball and get to the juices. This may not be as satisfying a treat as doggy biscuits, but I can see this product being useful for training. For instance, if your dog pulls on the leash when you go for walks, stop and call the dog to you. If he listens, let him have a few licks before continuing. I can also see it being useful for dogs who are overweight and whose owners want to cut back on calories yet can still give the dog a little treat for good behavior.

review/summary: Dogs like it!
review/text: I am only reviewing the Bacon flavor, but my dogs picked up on how this works pretty quickly and love the taste of it.  At first they wanted to bite the bottle and chew it like a treat but I worked with them for about a minute or so and they got down that you only lick it.  I have 3 dogs and all three of them liked the taste of it.  I like it because it seems like a more personal treat than just a dog biscuit.  I recommend this!

review/summary: My Yorkies think it is yummy, but I think it is inconvenient
review/text: Both of my finicky yorkies love this treat, but I don't!  It smells awful and I have to hold it for them to enjoy it, unlike other treats that I toss to them and let them enjoy while I enjoy a little peace and quiet.  Also, the liquid gets in their "beard" so the odor of the treat lingers even after I tuck the bottle back in the treat cupboard.  It is rare for both of my dogs to agree on a treat and it is fun to watch them enjoy it, but it is inconvenient.  I will not likely repurchase this.

review/summary: Interesting idea... so-so execution
review/text: I am of the curious sort when it comes to dog treats and new ways to reward dogs so I jumped at getting this product.<br /><br />Lickety Stick arrived and three dogs were eagerly sitting in front of me; a cocker spaniel, a norwegian elkhound, and an australian shepherd.<br /><br />I unwrapped the stick and squeezed a little juice out of the tube onto the roller. I presented it to all three dogs. The cocker spaniel and the aussie eagerly licked away. The aussie licked away so much the cocker needed a wet cloth over the top of her head due to dropping juice on her head. The elkhound however, wanted no part in it.<br /><br />After a couple days of using it and trying it out I am left with the premise that it's an interesting take on a a dog reward - but in the end, the execution and possibility of making a mess leave this treat stuck in the treat drawer. I don't see myself buying these in the future.

review/summary: A Little Weird, but my Yorkie LOVED it.
review/text: I guess I didn't really read the description of this product very well, but this was not what I expected! It is like a little roller ball of deodorant only it is filled with liquid log treats. (this one is bacon) It was easy to open, but I did have to squeeze the bottle a little and then roll the ball around to get the initial liquid to come out. Once my dog realized what she was supposed to do, she was ALL OVER IT. In fact, she got so excited that she made her self sick. I'm saving this one for an "every now and then" treat.

review/summary: Not sure it's worth the trouble
review/text: My little dog (a Shih Tzu) seemed to have trouble licking the rollerball consistently enough to fully enjoy the treat.  Her inclination was to try to bite the top - and I'm wondering if that's what most dogs would try to do.  Of course, a dog can't tell you in words if they like something - you have to go by behavior.  And when we took this away from our dog, she really didn't protest like she does when it is a favorite treat.<br /><br />The premise behind this product is interesting - and I can understand why the idea of a rollerball made sense.  I'm just not sure it all works together well enough.  I can't envision seeking this out and purchasing it for my pet.

review/summary: OK, maybe not so great for large dogs
review/text: I tried this on my mom's dog while he went through his resume of tricks, but since his mouth is bigger than the Lickety Stik he kept trying to bite it.  He got annoyed after a few tricks when he realized I wasn't going to give it to him and wandered off to find my mom who was holding actual treats.

review/summary: Doggy Approved
review/text: What a great idea for a treat.  Lickety Stik is constructed like a roll-on deodorant with a flavored dog treat inside.  Hold the Stik upside down and my dog licked away at it.  It is low calorie (great for my dog who is on a diet). It is also very easy to carry.  I keep it in my pocket.Since it has a cap and has plastic construction, it doesnt get crushed in my pocket. It makes a great little reward during training sessions.<br /><br />I find it especially helpful to reward my dog when Im teaching him a new trick. With the lickey stik he was very eager to see the stik come out.<br /><br />A few notes on the Lickety Stik's use.  The first time you use the Lickety stik, you may have to move the roller-ball with your fingers to get the treat to flow a little.  Once the dog understands that licking the ball makes the treat flow, it is not an issue. Also when he is done licking, there is no dripping.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik also has a clear window at the base of of the bottle so you know when it is time to reorder.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik is not large which makes it easy to trasport. However it does mean that if it is your primary treat for you dog, you may run out quickly.<br /><br />Overall, I can say that the dog was enthusiastic about the stick. It was easy to use. It was fun to give. I am happy with this product.

review/summary: Dogs KNOW it's bacon
review/text: When I picked up the padded envelope from our mail basket, my cocker spaniel snapped to attention.  By the time I had the bottle out of the envelope, the Rottweiler had joined us.  Their anxiety grew as I struggled to break the plastic wrap around the top.  Finally I had the bottle ready for action, after a very long 30 seconds.<br />I had to rub the roller ball to get the liquid inside to lubricate the ball.  Squeezing the bottle forces the liquid to ooze around the ball.  Both dogs wanted to eat the bottle rather than lick the ball.  They give it a five-star review and suggest that the Vine program send more to our house.<br /><br />The rottie still wants to eat the bottle. The cocker has learned the licking technique.  The cocker is quite responsive to the sound of the bottle being shaken. (Cockers are the original foodies.)<br /><br />The major problem I have is that the ball does not move freely.  I get some liquid on the ball and hold it out for the cocker.  She licks it very clean.  Then I have to squeeze more liquid out and roll the ball around with my thumb.<br /><br />The ingredients seem to be healthy, or as healthy as something with bacon fat in it can be.<br /><br />This product can be a great training reward, but you will have a sticky thumb. The first time I offered my thumb to be licked clean, the cocker started to eat it. If you are training your dog, you probably will want a rag to keep your thumb clean.<br /><br />My vine review philosophy is to first test the product without regard to price.  Now that I have checked the price, currently around $8, it seems a good value for a training tool.  $8 does not buy a decent size bag of training treats.  And the dogs are much more responsive to the bacon than to freeze-dried lumps.  However as just a treat for being a good dog in general, it is not as satisfying as a regular-sized biscuit.  Pity my poor dogs who are only getting this one bottle of bacon treat.

review/summary: Finally a treat both you and your dog can enjoy!
review/text: First off, i would have to say that I did not find the Bacon flavor to be appealing at all.<br /><br />OK I'm kidding.  I didn't actually lick it.<br /><br />But my dog did, and she loves it.<br /><br />The basics:<br />The container is like a roll-on antiperspirant.  If you use roll-on deodorant, and buy this product, you may accidentally sport a new aroma if you are particularly groggy in the morning.<br />Its a no-calorie treat if your dog is ... uh... "easy to see" as they say.  My dog is a bit thick (like a barrel on stilts), so I had some high hopes for this product.<br /><br />The pros:<br />My dog loves it.<br />Its low calorie.<br />No crumbs!<br /><br />The cons:<br />You can't throw it in the laundry room as an easy way to get them to be put up.<br />I had to hold it upside down, and it would drip.<br />When my dog is aggressive she threatens to take it away from me.<br /><br />Overall, I would say that this is one of the few products that delivers exactly what it promises.  I recommend it.

review/summary: Doggies Loved It
review/text: For those that follow my reviews you know I have many dogs so I just had to try out this product.  It was so funny the day I received it. I was surrounded with furry friends. Incase you don't know dogs can smell just about anything and they knew something was in my hands that they were going to like.  The container reminds me of roll-on deodorant.  I know that sounds gross but nevertheless it did. It is made where the dogs lick the top of it to receive their treat.  Okay, now all I had to do was let the dogs lick it and believe me they were ready.  They piled around me and all took their turns, it was so cute.  Now, did they come back for more?  You bet they did, each seeing who could get their tongue on it first.  I could tell to them it was a tasty treat and for me it was a time to interact with my animals and show them love. You can't just let them play piggly wiggly and lick it all in one day, because they would, believe me. You have to allow only so many licks.  I liked this product and so did my dogs and plan to purchase it for them. Dog biscuits are of course a lot easier, you just throw them and they catch, but this is a special treat that allows you time with your animal. Nice product.

review/summary: Perfect for use while training your dog
review/text: The Lickety Stik is fabulous!  My dog immediately took to it and gets so excited when he sees the bottle.  I have been trying to train him to fetch a ball and then give it back to me, but I have had to wrestle the ball away from him.  I was worried about giving him too many treats because of calories, not to mention the expense.  I started letting him lick the Stik once or twice each time I got the ball away from him.  It didn't take long before he would drop the ball when he saw the Stik, and now he puts it directly into my hand, just so he can lick the Stik. I plan on using it to train him to do other things, as well.<br /><br />Considering how many times I have used it, it is a good value for the money.  It's kind of awkward to give him as a regular dog treat, so I save it for training and give him dog biscuits or other treat.

review/summary: Weirdest thing ever
review/text: First of all, let me say that my dog likes the taste of this treat - a lot. However, I have a large dog...and evidently an impatient dog. Rather than lick this "roll-on" treat, she would rather just bite it and chew it. That's really the only down side. Found out my daughters kitten liked it too. It's weird, like a 1980's deodorant company trying to do something profitable with their out of date product line. I wouldn't buy it, but my pets liked it.

review/summary: For Little Dogs ONLY!
review/text: It's a good idea, but my dog did not get it at all.  It's design is like a roll on deoderant - the ball inside moves while licked putting more of the liquid flavor onto the ball and into the dogs mouth.  You can ration how much the dog licks and put the lid back on.<br /><br />The smell wasn't strong unless you put your nose on it for a big whiff.  It must have smelled good to my dog because she went nuts over it.  The problem was it was too small and she kept bitting it and trying to yank it from my hand.  Then later when I was gone - she got it off the counter and chewed through it.  Yes, I know - she wasn't well behaved with it.  BUT she couldn't resist the temptation and after I had let her lick it I guess she figured it was fair game.<br /><br />Overall - I believe it's made for a little dogs but I didn't know that when I got it.

review/summary: The Dog loved it, I didn't
review/text: Well, when I ordered this I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but it sure wasn't a roll on deodorant container filled with stinky liver flavored liquid.  For me personally, I've always stood by the belief that while the dogs are the one enjoying the dog toys and treats, the are more made for the humans than anything else and there is something totally repugnant about a dog eating from a deodorant container.<br /><br />Jilly, my puppy, loved it.  She kept on trying to take it out of my hand and bite at the container until she realized she had to lick but she did love the flavor.  The only real negative is that Jilly got "liver breath."  Also the ball in the container didn't spin and I had to squeeze and I got a drip or two on the floor.  I have wood floors so no harm no foul, but if you have carpeting you might get a stain, but Jilly helped with the clean up.<br /><br />But I couldn't quite get over the container and even though Jilly loved it the doggy breath and the fact I didn't like her licking a deodorant container was a big turn off.  Plus, if I used roll on deodorant I won't want my dog to associate it with treats, in case she got in the bathroom and ate the real deodorant which I'm sure could make her very sick.<br /><br />3 Stars.<br /><br />UPDATE:  The cat found this on the table and started pawing at it, so I opened it for her so she could have a lick and she loves it more than the dog!

review/summary: YUCK and Messy
review/text: I was excited to get the Lickety Stik for my dogs. It sounds like a good idea BUT the roller part DOES NOT roll and in order for the dog to get something to taste you must squeeze the container which can be a mess. I have four dogs, as I dog train in obedience and in tracking. In the beginning all four were interested, but then they all became frustrated with it. I ended up with $25.00 of this garbage. SAVE YOR MONEY.it's not worth it!

review/summary: Crack for dogs!
review/text: I have three beagles and a lab.  To be honest, when I read about this product, I was dubious as to its ability to make them happy.  A lick?  That's it?<br />Well--I was right, and wrong.<br />When I first broke it out, the lab tried to eat it--he wasn't happy with the one lick.  The beagles saw him try to eat it, and then they were all about eating it, too.  But once they realized what it was all about, they LOVED it.  They were like crack addicts.  I put it on the dining room table, out of reach, and we kept catching them walking on their hind legs, noses over the table ledge, trying to get it.  They got so sneaky!  Climbing onto the chair?  Really?  When it was time for bed, when they usually get a cookie, they all ran to the table and gave me the distinct message--"WE want THAT!"<br />Last night I put the Lickety Stik on a tall shelf in the hallway of the house--and this morning, they "knew" exactly where it was, and wouldn't leave the hallway until I grabbed the thing and walked them outside.<br />So, we're calling it either crack for dogs or catnip for dogs haha..<br /><br />It's sort of like a roll-on deodorant style container.  The beef-gravy-like substance covers the ball and they simply lick it off.  Of course, as I said above, they will try to eat it at first, until they get the idea.  Although I'm convinced that should it get left within reach, they will eat the entire container.)<br /><br />It's a small container--about 5 inches long.  The picture made me think it would be much larger.

review/summary: Engineering flaw
review/text: My two dogs apparently loved the scent and taste based on the way they were all over the Stik as soon as I uncapped it. The problem was the roller ball. It didn't roll very well. This became the pattern -- place thumb on ball, roll, let dogs lick off residue, place thumb on ball, roll again ... It became tedious very quickly. My main dog grew impatient and latched onto the bottle with his back teeth, easily piercing the neck allowing the flavored goo to ooze out. I tossed the Lickety Stik lickety split.

review/summary: These things stink!!
review/text: I bought this product because we originally thought our new puppy had a condition called megaesophagus which requires them to eat and stay in a vertical position for 30-45 minutes after eating and other people had recommended this product to keep the dog occupied during that time.<br />We later found that our dog doesn't have this condition (thank goodness) so I was going to return it but I decided to try it out when my puppy got a tick on her head, thinking it would keep her focused while I got the tick off (which it very much did)<br /><br />The only one I have used is the chicken flavor and when I took off the lid, I gagged and threw up in my mouth. It stinks that bad. But my puppy did seem to like the taste of it.

review/summary: Somewhat undecided
review/text: This product is a bit odd, to say the least. It is designed in a roll-on deodorant type of bottle and your dog must lick the rolling ball to enjoy his treat.<br /><br />When first trying to get my dog to try it, he really looked at me, looked at the bottle, looked at me, looked at the bottle etc. You could literally see in his eyes that he was wondering what the heck he was supposed to do, or what I wanted him to do. Finally he took a swipe at it with his tongue. I assume he was unimpressed because he made no effort to go for another lick, despite my encouragement.<br /><br />The whole idea is just weird. I give my dog treats as well..treats, or to reward good behavior, or just to be nice, or to get him to lay/settle down for a little - in other words to keep him busy for a few minutes or so. This type of treat obviously goes against the idea of keeping him occupied for awhile while keeping my time free since you have to sit/stand there and hold the bottle for him. Now, don't get me wrong, we always have a variety of snacks on hand and I would not mind standing there holding this bottle for him if he actually liked the treat. It's just one of those little extra things we do to show our love. However, he just seemed to not like the taste once he did figure out to lick it, otherwise I assume he would have continued to lick.<br /><br />The texture of the liquid inside just looks gross to me. It is a clearish, somewhat dark brown color. Kind of like pancake syrup although not as sticky/tacky.<br /><br />If your dog will lick the roller ball and likes the taste, then I guess it is a good buy, but if not it is obviously a waste.<br /><br />I also cannot help but wonder who sat around and thought "Hmmmm, let's create a liquid dog treat and put it in a roll-on deodorant dispenser!!"
