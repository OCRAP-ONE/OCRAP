review/summary: Great Snacking
review/text: This "Bread in a Can" has a heavy texture of more like a pound cake. It's sweetened heavily on the molasses taste. It's great with baked beans or toasted with a good jam. The different sweet taste of this bread just adds to the taste of luncheon meats and cheeses. Stores well and the can protects the contents when loaded in saddle bags...(try that with a loaf bread!). Kids eat the stuff up in quantity, so have several cans on hand. One can dress this stuff up with a lot of imagination. Sometimes the price is a bit lower in local stores. Recommend it highly.

review/summary: yummy brown bread
review/text: I grew up with this bread!! We use to make our own but it takes so long to do. I wanted my grandchildren to have some to see if they liked it.  They just don't carry this product in the stores out here in so Cal.  When we have hot dogs and beans we serve boston brown bread warm with cream cheese on it. What a wonderful taste and the kids really love it now. My daughter has asked me for some for her house also. undo the can at both ends and push out with one lid. wrap bread in foil and put in a 350 degree oven for about 15 minutes. serve it with marscapone or regular cream cheese along with the hot dogs and beans.  ( I still make my own Baked Beans). I am so glad I found this brand in particular as that is the brand we use back home.

I still can't say which explains why I bought it online at this high price.  Goes good with beans which explains why it is made by a bean maker.  Although the beans can be made from scratch of course.

Worth the money and buying here on line saves a small fortune over the prices in store when the Brown Bread is available. Good value.

review/text: Just an awesome bread! A very fair price for a quality product. It's hard to find here in rural NY state so I ordered 2 cases of each kind (raisin and plain)through Amazon. Shipping was quick, it was well packed, free shipping, and no problems whatsoever :)<br />To get the bread out of the can easily, cut off both ends of the can. Run a table knife down, and around, the sides of the can. Use one of the lids to push the bread out of the can.<br />Thank-you B&M for producing this scrumptious product and thank-you Amazon for making it possible for me to buy it.

review/text: I was a huge fan of GFIC's Italian Cappuccino and was really unhappy when they quit making it, so when I saw this, same maker, same name, I thought I was getting the same product. Completely wrong. This item has a similar texture to their Swiss Mocha (liquid is somewhat thickened), and the flavor is totally different (again, more like Swiss Mocha). Would have been nice to know that it's a vending machine pack. Doesn't mix as well by hand.

review/text: About the best gluten-free pasta you will find for this price.  It holds sauces beautifully.  I would add that the best way to cook this pasta is to put it into a pot of boiling water, bring it back up to a full boil, stirring it for ONLY 1 to 2 minutes.  Then remove from flame, cover with a lid and let sit for an additional 10 minutes.  Drain and rinse.  Comes out a perfect texture.

review/summary: Not 'The Chef's" Best Effort ...
review/text: I'm a senior and have been a Chef Boyardee fan since childhood. Never thought I'd ever say anything bad about 'The Chef'. Strange as it seems to me, I guess I've never had the spaghetti and meatballs before. The two little meatballs in each of these almost childsize portions are fine. But the too little spaghetti and way too much sauce are really bland.<br /><br />It takes two bowls of this to make a meal, and I'm not a big eater. And even amendments (e.g. fresh pepper) don't do much.<br /><br />And ... don't get me started on those silly microwave bowls. I don't like a mess at home and can't imagine trying to microwave and then eat this in an office setting. Maybe, just maybe, it would work if the same amount of food was in a bigger bowl ... but you've still got the splashy lid(s) to deal with.<br /><br />All in all I'll stick with canned Chef Boyardee Beef Ravioli or even lasagna unless those old fashioned cans suddenly disappear!

review/text: I was really quite disappointed. The " meatballs" taste like what I would imagine " fake meat" to taste like as they are very artificial in texture and do not taste like really anything resembling meat. The pasta is overdone, the sauce is watery and, without exaggeration, you can actually drink the whole thing, except for the tiny " meatballs," which are few indeed. This is really a bad example of processed food.

review/text: Is it just me or does there seem to be a LOT of sauce in their spaghetti these days?! In fact, the whole can is practically tomato flavored water and at around $1.40 per can, not a very good deal at all! If you want to give your kids a GOOD spaghetti lunch, buy some tupperware and send them to school with that! In a similar sized container you could pack in about 5 times as much actual spaghetti!  In fact, I dare everyone out there to do this little test at home:  Open up a can of Chef Boyardee Spaghetti with meatballs, dump it in a collander to drain off the sauce into a bowl. Then look at what is left over. Put this on a plate and then ask yourself if THAT looks like $1.40 worth of pasta!! Nuff said! I won't even go into the taste of this garbage. Give me a break!

review/text: These are fabulous for kids' and husband lunches!  They're fast for the kids to heat and have a hot meal, but if you're packing them for your husband, you might toss in two of these or include a sandwich.  They're not huge, about 3/4 cup in size, so that's not that much for a manly appetite.  They're really good too, surprisingly enough, and the value for the money is nice.  Not too salty either, like soup has been lately.  And honestly, with the cost of soup these days, this stuff fills you up more and costs the same. Recommend!

review/text: I bought these thinking that they would be as good as the ravioli. Wrong.  There is something different and unpleasant about the sauce.  The tiny meatballs weren't bad but something was "off" with the sauce, plus there was way too much sauce to spaghetti. Not sure if this was just a bad shipment or if they always taste like this.  I'll stick with the ravioli in the future.

I fixed one for my starving 17 year old the other day and he ate it because he was very hungry and cranky and walking out the door, but he said it tasted like spaghetti in Campbell's tomato soup, and the meatballs are not very good.<br /><br />3rd:  I suspect these taste like Chef Boyardee (think Spaghetti-O's) so if you like that, you will probably be very happy with these.  They heat quickly and efficiently, and I think they would be an excellent lunch if you like the taste; I'm a teacher and I can see how valuable they would be on a 30 minute lunch break with a shared microwave.  I just don't like the sweet Chef Boyardee taste anymore...

review/text: *****<br /><br />Ok, I love lavender, so I'm biased. Still, this Traditional Medicinals Organic Chamomile with Lavender Tea is just spectacular. I've never tasted an herbal tea so good. I'm not sure if I just love the tea or if it truly has "digestive and nervous system sedating properties" but I feel relaxed when I drink it.<br /><br />The ingredients in Traditional Medicinals' Organic Chamomile with Lavender Tea are: organic chamomile flower 1,200 mg., proprietary blend: organic English lavender flower, organic lemon balm leaf . The tea tastes like chamomile with a strong, delicious lavender taste. It is a very fresh taste because there are no flavorings and everything is organic. The smell is yummy, too, even before brewing, as the lavender smell stands out; you could put the tea bags in your drawers to use as sachet fresheners!<br /><br />Traditional Medicinals seems to be a very responsible company. They adhere to sustainable and fair trade practices, use organic ingredients when feasible, and base their tea formulations on sound research and knowledge.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes on the box: "The combination of chamomile and lavender with lemon balm has digestive and nervous system sedating properties useful for nervous stomach and restlessness associated with upset stomach. The use of these herbs alone and in combinations for nervous stomach has been approved by European health authorities and is supported by clinical data. Organic Chamomile with Lavender has a pleasantly aromatic and balanced taste.".<br /><br />Also note the following caution from the box: "Contraindications: Do not use if your have known allergies to plants of the Asteraceae family (daisy) such as blessed thistle, calendula, chamomile, echinacea, safflower or yarrow."<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****

Just brewing this tea will ease your stress as it's lavender scent will fill the room.  This is aromatherapy in a beverage that tastes delicious.

review/text: I am not sure if they have changed their product since the other reviews were written (Back in 2009) or if I enjoy different things. At any rate I enjoy these pears I have ordered them at least half a dozen times and have always been pleased with my purchase. Wanted to let others know that it is worth your time to give them a try and for the price of fresh fruit this is a real bargain.

review/summary: Natural Chewy Food, Delicious Treat
review/text: *****<br />These dried D'Anjou pears are very sweet, very chewy and very yummy! They are 100% certified organic, baked with no added sugar, no preservatives or chemicals, no pesticides or herbicides, and they are gluten free. These are a truly healthy and delicious snack.<br /><br />Many reviewers have reported not liking them, but my experience is different. These are a natural food and they may contain occasional seeds, stems, or core fragments. This doesn't sound good, but I didn't really notice much of anything at all that I couldn't eat or that was hard. These dried pears are very fibrous (like jerky), so you need to have healthy teeth to be able to chew them. I totally loved them--I think they are my favorite of all of the Bare Fruit snacks!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: poor quality for the price
review/text: I've tried many different brands of dried fruit and this one was one of the poorest quality.  More than 1/2 of the slices in the package have seeds and they don't come off easily. I either had to cut or bite off the pieces with seeds.  Definitely not worth the money. Some of the other brands on here with individually packaged fruit might be more costly per pound but are much better quality.

review/text: I have made many BareFruit purchases and always been happy with them.  The items are crisp yet fresh and tasty.  These pears came in WET, BLACK and smell like rancid raisins.  There is no crisp to them.  They don't even resemble pears nor the photo of the product.  They are inedible.<br /><br />The two other BareFruit purchases that I made that shipped in the same package are perfect and delivered as expected.<br /><br />Save yourself the money and do not purchase the pears.  Absolutely GROSS and a waste of money.

It needs to be refrigerated so it may or may not have a lot of preservatives which is nice if it doesn't. All in all, its not a great buy; I guess I'm a better fan of Tapatio.

review/summary: Great in baked beans!
review/text: When thinking about growing up in NW Ohio, food seemed to be the most remembered. Home made food, not that "Happy Meal" junk.<br />Most of our family gatherings were centered on a big feast.  The best cooks ever in my life were my great grand mother, and my father.  My grand mother a Polish/German woman that I'm sure could take shoe leather and make it taste like gourmet food. She used Coleman's Mustard in so much stuff I couldn't list it all.<br />The next in line for great cooks was my dad.  He used Coleman's dry mustard in making his rub for baked ham and in the summer for his famous baked beans.<br />I was taught by both in the kitchen and elsewhere, we won't talk about.  When ever I make baked beans I always use COLEMAN'S DRY MUSTARD, the flavor blends very well and is certainly noticed when missing or substutited.  A touch of Colemen's also make a great enhancer to potato salad and salad dressings.  Dry rub for ribs, "Forget about it" (said with a thick NJ accent). You won't know what your ribs did without it. It is good stuff and a little goes a long way.<br />OK, I relinquish the soap box and the memory trail to the next person.<br /><br />The reviewer:<br />I am a former "Flying Tigers" 23rd Tactical Fighter Wing, Information/Public Relations Specialist. I review things honestly, fairly and don't hold back if there is a problem and praise the good.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: It is much cheaper to buy it in bulk at Amazon, than one can at a time at my local grocery store, so that is why I purchase it here.  Colman's is a great dry mustard that I use in a lot of my cooking, from making the topping for a meat loaf, to vinaigrettes and souffles. It lasts a long time sitting in your cupboard, but I store the extras in the freezer to extend the shelf life.  Note:  this mustard is hot, but much milder than the fiery Chinese mustards you may come across, so Colman's is not a substitute for those.

review/summary: Colman's Mustard
review/text: I have been using this product for more than 40 years. What more needs to be said? I use it in many recipes, as well as on sandwiches. I like that I can control the consistency by varying the amount of water and powder I use. There are times when a thicker mustard is called for, so I am able to adjust the proportions accordingly. The quality of this product has remained consistently high in my opinion. If kept in the fridge, Colman's Mustard powder seems to last indefinitely without losing its punch. I usually purchase the 16 oz. container, but purchased the 4-pack to give as gifts.

review/text: This mustard did arrive with a bit of loose powder in the box (only a very tiny amount though) but I think it's almost inevitable being that it is such finely ground mustard powder.<br /><br />The taste is superb and has that nostril burn comparable to hot Chinese Wasabi which I love too.<br /><br />Mustard is great for everything from sauces and dressings to meat and veggie rubs.<br /><br />I'm not sure about the expiration date issue. I couldn't really read the date on all of the ones I received but I imagine that as long as you keep this in cool, dark storage it can last a very long time. Never keep spices out on your counter. I always store my spices in my cabinets and in my pantry to preserve their shelf-life.<br /><br />If you need your sinuses cleared, this is the real deal!

review/summary: Great Mustard from England at a Good Price!
review/text: If you enjoy mustard with good flavour and a bite to it - Colman's is quite hot but different from Chinese hot mustards - then you'll like this product.  And it is at a good price if you can order in this quantity.  The secret to getting the best taste is to mix it with COLD water, and then wait about 10 minutes to let the flavour develop.  Due to the heat you will only use it in small quantities, you don't spread it on sandwiches or burgers or hot dogs the way you spread American yellow mild mustard.  Spread thinly is my advice.  Just a touch!

review/text: Half Japanese, I grew up fairly isolated from any substantial Asian community in the Appalachian Mountains. My Aunt would ship us Japanese food and tea once every couple months and one of the most memorable, though I didn't care for it when I was a kid, was the green tea she sent in small tea tins.  Years later, I would conclude my taste for good quality Japanese Green Tea was formed at an early age, when my Mom would "make" us drink a cup of the green, unsweetened stuff.<br /><br />Finding good (good by my taste-memory) Japanese green tea has, until recently been difficult.  I've gone to Teavana, and other Asian food markets and it's always been a gamble trying to find the taste I remember from childhood.  Well, no more.  This is it!  And even in nice quality tea tins as well!  I am pleased.  You will be, too.<br /><br />Domo arigato!<br /><br />Eric-san

review/text: It's true this tea is subtle with complex grassy/nutty aromas and not for everyone.  This is not a tea to have with meals or that can stand up to strongly flavored foods but it does make a great tea for an afternoon break.  It is very important to brew it at the proper temperature as too high a temperature not only makes it taste bitter but doesn't release the more complex smells and flavors.  At the proper temperature you can let it steep for several minutes to develop a deeper flavor without bitterness.  We use a temperature controlled electric tea kettle, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HC54O2">PINO Digital Kettle Pro</a>, at home and it works great.  Of all the green teas Sencha teas have an extraordinarily high concentrations of catechins and other polyphenols that make them a powerhouse for your health.

review/summary: This seasoning has soul!!!
review/text: I live in a small city in Illinois and have not found a product close to the taste of this product. I use it on everything. It does not have overwhelming salt in it so you really can taste the spices in this product. It is amazing on hamburgers..I even use it on my fries...I have gotten many compliments on my food and being kind of selfish...I have not told anyone about my soul secret, but I'm telling you that this product is the bomb without all that salt that gives you that blouted feeling later...plus this family needs to watch the salt intake...so I have to give this product 5 stars.

review/summary: Why pay for organic soup that has BPA in it?
review/text: My daughter loved this soup, but I was disappointed to discover that Earth's Best uses a resin liner on their canned foods that contains BPA - a toxic chemical for children.  While the company says the levels are low and within acceptale government standards, BPA is known to leech even more into acidic products like diced tomatoes, or tomato soup.  So, until Earth's Best moves to glass jars, we'll have to refrain from eating this yummy soup.

I had a few bites myself, and<br />I found that even I had difficulty chewing the beans--they were SO HARD! For a toddler<br />to eat this was next to impossible.

I like the soup it is  shame the cans are not a good quality. I wonder how safe the soup is to eat if the can is so easily dented and smashed. I reported this same concern to the company. I will never buy soup via mail again. I found that the cans do the same thing if bought from the local store so I will not be purchasing this product in the future.

review/summary: Good Tea with Hibiscus Flowers
review/text: ****<br />Tazo's Passion Herbal Infusion is a somewhat tart, deep, flavorful (hibiscus-y tasting) tea. It is not berry-like in taste, although it is red in color. It's difficult to describe what hibiscus tastes like, but I find it a most pleasant taste. My husband says it tastes like pomegranate to him. Although Passion contains licorice root it is not sweet.<br /><br />The ingredients in Passion are: hibiscus flowers, natural tropical flavors, citric acid, orange peel, licorice root, cinnamon bark, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy. It is caffeine-free!<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "A tantalizing deep red tea made from hibiscus flowers, exotic herbs and natural tropical flavors." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Passion as "berry, juicy, wine-like, merlot, sweet, earthy, dense". Tazo describes the aroma as "sweet, juicy, red fruits".<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as other teas such as Numi, which is why Tazo Passion gets only four stars.<br />****

review/summary: Herbal Infusion
review/text: The deep purple/red color and hibiscus fragrance is enough to make anyone passionate about tea. Yet, is this really tea? It looks like tea, but it is really an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers, orange peel, licorice, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water.<br /><br />The flavor is slightly reminiscent of hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice. This tea leaves a tingle on your tongue and I think it goes very well with a spoonful of honey.<br /><br />I love Tazo Teas and have been immersing myself in the mysterious experience with a sense of abandon. So far I've tried most of the flavors and have always been impressed.<br /><br />I do think you need two tea bags for each cup of tea to fully intoxicate the senses and experience the magic of the ingredients. Caffeine Free.<br /><br />You can drink this tea as you type into the night...<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Chicken With A Twist
review/text: There is no question that Progresso has made some excellent and tasty soups for all to enjoy. That has been the case with their chicken soups over the years. But this one isn't bad, but could have been better. The Progresso Chicken & Orzo with Lemon tastes good, with a lot of orzo pasta in it, and tasty pieces of chicken. Yet, my only gripe with the soup is that I honestly wish that there could have been a bit more lemon zest right into each and every bite I could taste from the soup. Still, it is a nice twist for a longtime favorite lover of soups. I do hope though that Progresso can improve the taste of this one though for anyone who loves a bit of a twist into the classic Chicken Soup.<br /><br />Price: B-<br /><br />Taste: B<br /><br />Overall: B-

review/summary: Lives up to its name
review/text: I'm in the latter months of pregnancy and it is becoming harder and harder to get a good nights sleep. In lieu of not being able to find my go-to Chamomile at the grocery, I reached for Bedtime Story since in the tag line it expressed being Caffeine Free and made with Real Spearmint and Chamomile Flowers. I was curious what the Spearmint would be like with the Chamomile so I scooped Lipton Bedtime Story with plans to make a cup that night.<br /><br />Upon opening the box, I was hit with the tingly scent of Spearmint. I brewed a cup, curiously wondering if the tea would be more minty than I wanted. After letting it steep for a few minutes, I added my favorite accompaniments and sipped. Delicious. It's a soft, relaxing blend of Chamomile. The Spearmint is not overpowering like I had worried it might be. The ingredients listed are Spearmint Leaves, Chamomile Flowers, Peppermint Leaves, Orange Peel, Lemon Grass, Spice, Chicory Root. I would say that along with the Chamomile and Mint flavors, the Chicory Root, stands out a bit, giving the tea a hint of earthiness.<br /><br />Bedtime Story definitely relaxed my body and I've been sleeping like a baby (pun intended) ever since.
