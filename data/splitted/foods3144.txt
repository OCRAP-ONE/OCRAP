review/summary: Good but not tasty
review/text: Garlic is great for health, but this one is coarse and does not seem to "immerse" itself into the cooking. If you don't have fresh garlic, this is better than nothing. I prefer fresh US grown farmer's market garlic. Gilroy, California produced garlic is the best !

review/text: This pasta is very delicious and a breeze to cook. Unfortunately pappardelle pasta is to be eaten in the long strips as to which it is made for this purpose. Two out of 3 boxes arrived broken into pieces, therefore defeating the purpose of the pappardelle pasta type.  Maybe the next time it is ordered on Amazon, they should use bubble wrap to properly package it.

She said she no longer makes curry from scratch because the Prima Taste curry tastes just as good. She shipped the kits to me for many years while they were not available in the U.S. I am delighted they are now available at Amazon and have ordered them to be sent to me on a regular basis.

review/summary: Delicious -- and no cans to store
review/text: I've used this Savory Choice product for over a year and can recommend it highly. It is delicious and easy. Inside each individual packet is a thick liquid: just add it to a cup of water to make the broth. This is not like the low-salt, low-fat powders or the canned products but more like broth you've cooked from scratch. Comes in beef, chicken, and turkey flavors. I keep it handy on my RV as well as in my kitchen.<br />Update 2010: I'm still ordering and using the chicken broth and the beef broth as staples in my pantry and on the RV. I've given packets away to friends so they can enjoy these excellent products. While cooking, you can squeeze the packet into your food and add the cup of water, then stir. Easy and a big saving in shelf space over cans.

review/summary: Very salty and a little strange
review/text: Maybe I had my expectations set too high after reading the other reviewers. This is nothing like homemade beef broth. Yes, it's better than bullion, and it avoids the "tinny" taste that canned broths tend to have. However, it still has a hard-to-describe strange flavor, not the rich beefy taste others described. Plus, it's very very salty. It's hard to make a good sauce or soup from it because of the amount of salt.<br /><br />Each pouch, which reconstitutes to one cup, has 770 mg of sodium. That's higher than most canned broths. I assume that high salt content is to make up for the lack of beef. I don't know how much they use, but the USDA requires less than an ounce of beef for every gallon of water - I don't think they're much higher than that. If you try to concentrate it into a sauce or gravy, it becomes as salty as cheap buffet food.<br /><br />It's not terrible, but it's nothing like the quality of a good boxed chicken broth. I'm certainly not going to reorder it once I run out; I'd rather just avoid recipes that require beef broth.

review/summary: Fantastic product
review/text: Savory Choice is the best stock I've found and I love everything about it.  First off, it's flavor is incomparable to any other pre-made stock product and it really tastes like what chicken stock is supposed to taste like. I shared it with my grandmother and it won even *her* stamp of approval.  Secondly, I love that it is concentrated so that you make up just the amount you need, which is especially handy when you are deglazing a pan to make a sauce, for example; you don't end up with a whole quart container going bad in your fridge.  Finally, if there's anything I learned from NY apt. living, I love how small the footprint is of the box, itself.  It's also great to pack for backpacking trips, to keep in your desk at work, etc.<br /><br />They make chicken, beef, and turkey and around the Bay Area, it's available at Whole Foods, Berkeley Bowl, Andronico's, etc.

review/summary: Soooooo tasty, and easy to store!
review/text: My previous experiences with beef broth are the granular stuff and the canned liquid in the grocery stores.  I didn't like the flavor of the granular, and I hated opening a can of broth when I only needed a little.  So, I rarely used beef broth, I just avoided it.<br /><br />I took a chance on ordering Savory Choice Beef Broth Concentrate because my beef stew needed "something", and I haven't regretted it.  For the first time ever, I'm adding beef broth to everything... I just know it's going to come out good.  I add it to my beef stew, my husband added it to his sirloin 'n' portobello mushroom soup.  We both love the savory flavor it adds.  I particularly like that I can add more flavor per amount of liquid if I choose by adding extra packets.  And, super easy to store compared to cans.  I love this stuff.

review/summary: Incredibly Useful Stuff
review/text: I very often will make broth concentrate by boiling down the low-sodium canned broth until I have something like a roumelade. All the bullions I've tried, including the Penzey's weird soup base paste stuff, taste mostly like MSG and salt, not beef. The Savory Choice product is superb--for something that comes out of a plastic envelope I have no complaints.<br /><br />Use this to crank up the beef flavor in, say, stroganoff, shredded round steak for burrito filling, chili, pot roast, etc.<br /><br />Personally I wish they would leave the salt completely out of it--the high salt content _to me_ is just another variable I'd rather not have to keep track of. You aren't going to be buying this if you aren't pretty adept in the kitchen, and if you are adept you know how to salt your dishes. I don't want to cook with pre-salted hamburger or pre-salted carrots, and I don't want the bullion trying to guess my preferences either.<br /><br />But that is a quibble really, I love this product!

review/summary: Very Tasty, Very Pricey?
review/text: By far the best of the bunch. I agree wholeheartedly with fellow reviewers who gave it high praises. I gave it 4 instead of 5 because it seems the amount you get out of each individual package (quite a nice touch to have it in single well protected packages) is really not enough and I end up using a few of these packages for each creation, so one can only sigh as each individual box containing, I think (therefore I am), ten individual packages are gone faster than you can say "Where is the Beef?!". Besides that reflection of how much of a "tight-wad" I can be I must say this product is a lot tastier than most out there waiting in the aisles. The fact that the Broth is a thick gooey concentrate of beef only adds to my pleasure. Smells like what it claims and that is one more plus. I have been able to use them quite successfully in several ways: Stews, Soups, Sauces, on top of quality beef while cooking at high heat (stir fry renderings, per say). I have tried the cubes, the glass containers (above the cubes in quality, that is for sure), the powder form (or was that chicken, I am getting dizzy...) and I like this product. To test it I boiled a cup of water or so, added one of the packages (a little later another one), some herbs that go well with this kind of broth, a touch of fresh salsa and drank it like a cup of soup. No complaints. One package is rarely enough but the flavor and the final results all point out to an above average offering. Wish it was more quantity (then again if wishes were horses beggars would be riding) and now that I know about Savory Choice Beef Broth Concentrate, 5.1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4) I am going to buy more and I should say I have purchased a similar product in the past but not as gooey, a little more solid and comes in a plastic container and makes about a gallon of liquid, from a place where I buy the best Seafood Bases I have found in this great country.  I know how important bases are to really be able to put out a superior tasting dish so is added on the food budget and this product does not disappoint. 4 Stars!

review/text: I love this liquid beef broth concentrate!  It is handy to have if you are sick and need nourishment; or,,,,what I use it most for is to add flavor to other foods.  Left over meat? use 1 or 2 packet(s) with 1(2) cup(s) water and heat the meat up and make gravy with the juice.  I will often use the beef broth with chicken for a unique flavor.  I add it to quinoa for beef flavoring.  We don't often use rice; but, it surely could be used for rice dishes as well.  I have a decent stock of this....easy for hubby to use too; and he did when he was making meals for me after a recent surgery...

review/summary: Alright, this is not a Jewish company OK!
review/text: LMAO<br /><br />The Goya Company has a very interesting history, and is probably the first manufacturer and<br />distributor of Spanish food products in the country. I think they suffer somewhat from having<br />their shelfspace pigeonholed in the Ethnic Foods section of most supermarkets next to strange<br />things like Matzo Balls and Gefilte Fish and other semi-inedibles. But they are nonetheless a<br />Spanish specialty company that has branched out into Mexican and Caribbean products, and have<br />manufacturing facilities in many strategic locations around the world.<br /><br />Anyway, this is one of the better commercially available salsas that you can find locally just<br />about anywhere. And it is properly made with the only ingredients tomatoes, onions, jalapeno<br />peppers, and lemon. A very mild flavor that will appeal to just about everybody. For a 17.6 oz.<br />jar, this stuff is a bargoon at around $2.79 in your local grocery.<br /><br />Check out their website for the expansive product line and recipes.

review/text: Having been brought up in England, I cannot eat toast without Marmite. And talk about marriage made in heaven - eggs on fried bread that's been smeared with Marmite. If you decide to try a small jar, just remember it's not like jelly. You smear it on very thinly as it's quite strong and salty. Some of my American friends have tried it and loved it...others think it disgusting! Some funny commercials can be found on YouTube - just search for Marmite.

It's lacking flavor, insipid, not having or showing good taste like some of the others that I tried before such as instant wild american ginseng tea..For a cup of water, you have to use at least 2 bags of tea to encrease a bit of taste.<br />This product is cheap so no wonder why it is not tasting good as I expect.

review/summary: My favorite instant Ginseng
review/text: This is my favorite ginseng tea. It's very clear and just slightly sweet and needs nothing else. Sometimes I only use a 1/2 packet, to make it last and so I can drink more cups of it each day. Each packet makes one (or two) 6-8 ounce cups, despite the instructions on the box that say otherwise.<br /><br />This tea is packaged very nicely, in a single box with four dividers. I could be displayed as is, but I usually remove mine and put the packets in a glass jar.<br />This is the best tea to travel with. I put several packets in my briefcase and when I fly, just order a cup or two of hot water.

review/text: Honestly I don't get some people and their reviews. This is the BEST ranch I have ever tasted. It IS distinctly different from any other ranch dressing, maybe that's what got the other reviewers. It is like when you go to a restaurant and they convince you to try some mystery sauce, and it's amazing, and you beg for the recipe and they won't give it to you. Maybe it's because it's made from real milk, garlic and onion, and not soybean oil and high fructose corn syrup and all that other shite the big brands use. Five stars.

It's really spicy, so spicy that it's difficult to eat. The spices listed on the ingredients are common enough (garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, etc.) but it tastes as though it's only those spices mixed together with a bit of sugar (also on the label). It's not a smooth taste like regular ranch, it's sharp and spicy.

review/summary: International taste sensation!
review/text: I discovered Patak's Brinjal Egg Plant Relish in the 1990s, before the label was sold to a UK food conglomerate. At the time, it was called Patak's Brinjal Aubergine (or Bringal Pickle Aubergine in some markets).<br /><br />When the company transferred across the Atlantic, the new owners chose to abandon this little gem in favor of Patak's other chutney's and mint pastes -- all of them terrific. But for me, it was like losing a best friend. Talk about COMFORT food... I called the new owners at least once a year begging for a return of ambrosia.<br /><br />For me, it was like trying to break a drug addiction, but in this case, there was no methadone in site. It's difficult to describe a flavor in a text review, but let me try...<br /><br />Some of us like our pastes, sauces and relishes *HOT*. (This one is modestly rated as "medium"). But when recipes add chili or other heat, it is far too easy to drop the ball on the other flavors. Would you like some sweet, spicy & natural flavors dancing amongst the tangy heat? Do want a flavor that makes you close your eyes and praise the designer for giving you a tongue? If this describes you, then this is as close to paradise as it gets. Next, let's talk about VERSATILE. I spread this baby on everything (the word "spread" requires artistic license. Some firm eggplant chunks are as big as your little finger!)<br /><br />Do you have to be Indian to eat this relish? Heck no! I'm a mid-west raised, New England Yankee. But this little jar of heaven has become one of my raison's d'etre (Translation: "reasons for existence"). To be fair, you have to love Indian or Mediterranean spice. It's loaded with chili, fenugreek, coriander, mustard and turmeric -- and especially fresh garlic (definitely not roasted or denatured!). And of course, it has just the right amount of heat. The basic flavor component is a bit like fermented raisins or rum w/raisin, though I doubt that there is any alcohol.<br /><br />Verdict: 6 out of 5 stars. (That's not a mistake. It's THAT good!)<br /><br />Want a sanity check? Sure, why not! Write to me:<br />ellery (at) starbus (dot) com &lt;-- Please look for email challenge

review/summary: If the Dog Won't Eat It...
review/text: I have a 4.5 year-old beagle who is extremely sensitive to corn and somewhat sensitive to both wheat and rice.  I fed her Pinnacle brand dog food for a long time, but when FetchDog.com stopped carrying it, I had to find something new.  I ordered the Nature's Variety brand dry foods in every flavor over the past year trying to find one my beagle would enjoy.  While eating the Nature's Variety, she was healthy and had no food-related problems.  The ingredient lists on all of the different flavors available are very good.  It is a high-quality, high-scoring dog food.<br /><br />My beagle hated it...and for my beagle to turn her nose up at ANYTHING edible is really saying something.  With great reluctance, I have stopped ordering this brand because I don't just want it to be good quality food.  I want my dog to enjoy it, too.  Her meals are her greatest pleasure in life, and so I will be trying to find another retailer with the Pinnacle brand (which she thrived on, as well, and actually enjoyed eating).<br /><br />Summary:  Kioko the Wonder Beagle thrived on this food, and we tried each of the varieties/flavors without digestion upset (it's designed to be interchanged like that), but she simply did not like eating it.

review/text: If you are looking for a gift of a bonsai for someone who knows how to care for bonasi this is a nice packet with the video and all.  The pot is very nice as well.  But remember that a juniper is an outside plant that needs to winter outside so unless you are giving this to someone who knows what they are doing, it will probably be dead in a year or so.  Of course you will still have the pot....<br /><br />Seriously though this plant should only be owned by someone who knows how to care for outside bonsai.  If you are looking for a gift for someone without bonsai experience it is better to stick to a ficus or schefflera.

review/summary: Quality Juniper bonsai at a reasonable price
review/text: Now that I understand something of bonsai basics (i.e. treat outdoor plants to a life outdoors so as not to kill them!), I've decided to begin this hobby / art form with a Juniper bonsai. After browsing the great variety of Juniper bonsai trees available on Amazon, I settled on this plant because I thought it had a pleasing shape, was described as having "full" growth, and comes in a distinctive stoneware pot. For the price, $38, it appeared to be the most mature and well-styled tree that I could find, and I didn't want to spend significantly more for my first tree.<br /><br />I ordered the bonsai on Monday (which, granted, was a holiday). The bonsai shipped on Thursday via USPS Priority Mail. This struck me as somewhat slow processing, and I would recommend to the seller that they ship by USPS only Monday through Wednesday to avoid live plants sitting in mail processing facilities over the weekend. This is a tip that I always follow when I ship live plants, and it ensures that plants shipped anywhere in the contiguous 48 states arrive in the same week they were shipped. Fortunately, my bonsai arrived on Saturday, so it didn't have to spend a dark day in a box. This, however, is my only even slightly negative comment.<br /><br />The bonsai itself was larger and more full than I had expected. It stands close to 11" in an approximately three inch deep pot. The pot is a lovely silvery green which perfectly complements the juniper foliage. The bonsai does not appear to have been freshly potted in response to my order: the trunk feels stable within the pot, implying good root growth, and the bonsai is potted with a rock and established moss. The pot was labeled with a sticker to identify which view was the front, and the bonsai was shipped with a small package of organic fertilizer. Bonsai from this seller also come with with a "Thriving Bonsai" DVD. I have not yet watched the video, but I appreciate the care that the seller extends to the bonsai novice. This seller clearly wants the bonsai to be properly fed, appreciated, and cared for in its new home.<br /><br />I am very pleased with my purchase, and would highly recommend purchases from this seller.

Everything you eat has a nasty bitter aftertaste. My spouse and I both suffered symptoms after eating from a bag of Kirkland Pine nuts.

I will be buying the larger size since it did come in a resealable bag.  Also nuts can be frozen without loosing their freshness.  Why pay more for a product which is no better than these?

review/summary: A Caveat
review/text: The popcorn itself is yummy, just be warned that we had trouble popping it using our air popper.  The kernels were too light and would blow out of the popper before they were popped.  It's great in the microwave or a pan, but maybe the larger white or yellow would be a better match for an air popper.

review/summary: Amish Baby White Popcorn
review/text: I first had this popcorn at my 84 year old cousin's home. I thought it was so tender and delicious, and I wanted to buy some for myself. I found it on Amazon.com believe it or not!!!  Anyway, I ordered 6 pounds of it. All 6 pounds are now gone. This popcorn is REALLY good. It is different than other popcorns I have eaten because the kernels are small and very delicate. I consider myself a pro when it comes to popcorn because I have eaten it every night since I was a little girl. I usually eat my popcorn 1 kernel at a time, but since the kernels are so small, I ate it by the handful. My only complaint is that it does cost a lot to have it shipped. I wish I could find it locally so I would not have to pay for the shipping costs. If you like popcorn, I highly recommend it.

review/text: My doctor told me I must eat "hulless" popcorn if I have popcorn at all.  Because I can't give up my favorite snack, I bought this Wabash Famnily Farms Amish Country popcorn.  The kernels are tiny, but they pop well, although not as big and fluffy as the popcorn I get from the grocery store.  It tastes great, however, and has fewer and smaller hulls.  I don't think there is such a thing as completely hulless,but Ido notice thst I don't get the hulls stuck in my teeth anymore.

The PC is very tasty and light with no residual kernel shells that get stuck in your teeth...4 stars.<br /><br />Problem with using it in hot air poppers is that the kernels are too light and fly out of the machine before they pop.  Tilting the machine helps keep them inside, but it would be simpler just to find another larger kernel corn.

I think we enjoy it a bit more because we know there is no "palm" oil or coconut oil in it - we can control what oils we add or leave out.  It works well with the popper - in fact just last night we had a popper full of this corn and followed it with the other because we had purchased so much of the other - we enjoyed this more.

review/summary: Great little mini popcorn!
review/text: I bought the Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper several months ago, which (of course) the Wabash Valley popcorn came recommended (same company). I thought...what the heck; I've always wondered how "gourmet" popcorn differed from Orville or other everyday popcorn brands.<br /><br />Let me tell you...IT IS WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY! I can really taste the difference in quality. AND, "normal" popcorn just doesn't taste right when you make it in the Whirley-Pop.<br /><br />This popcorn is so tender and tasty. It was a little weird to see and eat at first because it's about half the size of regular popcorn. But, I believe this characteristic is essential in helping the seasonings completely coat the corn.<br /><br />My favorite prep methods include using the Whirley-Pop and Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil (see my review for that for more details!) I add a little peanut oil, sea salt, black pepper, and a good amount of Vegaline Garlic Mist Cooking & Seasoning Spray. YUMMY!!!!<br /><br />I've tried the other Amish Country popcorn, and they're all good. This is my favorite, though!

We found that the microwave often works better than pan popping.

Next time we'll drive the long distance to our nearest Amish store.
