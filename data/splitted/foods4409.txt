review/summary: My favorite tea
review/text: Although roasting mate removes some of it's nutritional value and lessens the amount of antioxidants in it, it is still better for you than coffee.  This blend is delicious!  I mix it with whole milk and a little sugar.  Yum!!  The energy/matteine boost is nice too.

review/summary: Very disappointing
review/text: I won't order these again.  I was pleased to be ordering something that said "sustainable agriculture", but these are not good.  Half the cans are dented.  I'm afraid to eat these unless they are cooked, so cannot use them in salads.  They are not quartered, as near as I can tell, but are in tiny bits, lots of tough outer leaves and all the cans I've used so far are full of extremely mushy, teeny artichoke pieces.  I wish I had even one good thing to say, but I don't.  I've throw out over half of every can I've tried to use so far.

review/summary: Native Forest Artichoke Hearts
review/text: The first time I ordered these they were poorly packed (with other items). The shrink-wrapped cans broke apart in transit and were very badly dented. I went through the "returns" process, and after some determined searching, was ultimately able to get them reshipped. Packed alone they were fine.<br /><br />Contents were just as expected, a bit on the small side but perfect for an antipasto platter. They do need to be drained VERY well if you want to prevent the citric-acid-preservative flavor from making it to the final dish.

review/text: Was excited to find a product that worked to prevent bladder blockages.  My cat was excited when I opened the package, the smell alone had him jumping all over me.  But when I gave him one,  it was impossible for him to bite, let alone chew. The treat was bigger than a normal sized cat treat, and the texture of hard jerky, not a chew at all.  Wish the manufacturer would come out with a SOFT version of this treat.  2 out of 4 reviewers = your taking your chances with these..

review/text: I have been using Vetri-Science UT Strength Feline chews for over a year with no problems. This was the first time I got them through Amazon from Absolutely Pets. Sadly, the chews were either old product or a mistake. They were almost rock hard and had to be microwaved for 5 seconds and cut up with a knife before my cat could eat them. I think this is a great product and will continue to use it but hope that the supplier will either refund or replace the bad batch.

review/text: My vet suggested these because my cat has had multiple UT infections.  My cat loves them and sits in front of my chair to remind me that it is time for his treat.  So far, so good...no UTI's since he has been taking them, which is great since it is a minimum of a $400 vet bill when that happens.  I think this might be an answer to my problems with my cat and his touchy urinary tract.

review/text: These crackers make a great evening snack, and a great dipping medium for parties.  However, don't buy this as I did expecting a whopping flavor of garlic and herb!  These guys have very little taste whatsoever.  Compared to Ritz's version of these, well, there really is none.  Ritz has a very obvious garlic flavor, making them quite wonderful as a compliment to an Italian dinner.  These, however, have no garlic taste at all.  Just not what I expected after having Ritz's version.  They're good, just not flavored strongly enough for our tastes.  Recommend, but if you're looking for garlic, try Ritz.

review/summary: Contains: Corn Syrup, Sugar & Sucralose!?? Decent Meal Replacer but TOO Sweet
review/text: I really like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FDG4K4">Orgain Creamy Chocolate Fudge, 11-Ounce Container (Pack of 12)</a>, the vanilla flavor. But its very pricey. I thought I'd try something else and I didn't want Slimfast. I got a 6 pack of these from Walmart for six bucks. Not bad at all on my pocket but just extremely too sweet for my taste buds. I had a few sips and then poured in some organic silk soy milk (unsweetened). It was still quite sweet. I probably will need to pour the whole drink into a different container and cut it in half with soy milk to truly dilute it to my liking. I honestly can't understand why there is so much sweetener. Looks like four different kinds of sweeteners. Why would a "protein" shake have around twice as many calories coming from sugar rather than "protein"? However that aside, this is better than a soda. Although, Id never bother with a soda, Id happily have water instead. The percentage of vitamins is well balanced. Nothing is 100%, meaning it takes into account you'll be eating other things that will provide you with supplements. So, no overdosing on any vitamins.<br /><br />The Special K Protein shake has NO fruit or veggie extracts. The Orgain has a veggie & fruit blend in it (Kale, Beet, Spinach, Carrot, Tomatoes, Blueberry, Acai, Banana, Apple, and Raspberry).<br /><br />The whole ingredient list for this shake is just a let down, minus maybe 3 or 4 things. Diet wise though this is better than skipping a meal. There is nothing special about Special K. I personally want to take in less calories for my meals and that is all this does. You aren't losing weight because of this drink. I could get the same amount of calories with a small breakfast but with way more nutrition and none of the junk ingredients. I REALLY need do shakes (not solid) to help me not want to eat more. For some reason drinking my meals helps me maintain will power. And for others they don't have time to make a meal, so this turns into an alternative.<br /><br />I found a coupon. I am a coupon maniac, and that has me considering to purchase it again to put on my shelf for emergency. I will not regularly buy this. Even with the price, I feel this is a bad choice for me. Im prepared to shell out the money for the Orgain instead. Its WORTH it!<br /><br />I'll update when/if I finish the case.

review/summary: Tastes Sooo Good . . . It's Scary
review/text: There's gotta be something wrong with something that tastes this good. Better than most milkshakes, yet only 180 calories. I bought a case of these thinking I could replace meals - instead I find myself drinking one as a desert for a regular meal. Guess my willpower needs some work.<br /><br />I'm preparing for a short one day fast and lets see if replacing one of these for each meal the day before does any good.<br /><br />There is a bit of an aftertaste - hardly noticeable, but still there with a almost chalky sticky presence. So many ingredients listed on the label it's a wonder that's all I've noticed.<br /><br />Better - to much better tasting than ANY of the protein powders I've used no matter what flavor. I like this french vanilla taste so much I'm not even going to try any other flavors for now. Actually, I've gotten on the auto delivery plan and have a case coming every month.<br /><br />This could be dangerous.

Have tried their Meal Replacement Bars and Snack Bars and the Protein Water.  I like them all.  Yes, they have artificial ingredients and sugar in them.  But they are helping me to lose weight, and that is what I am looking for.

A Milky Way bar has 81 calories, 3.1 grams of fat, 10.7 grams of sugar and .7 grams of protein. In essence this "protein" shake is nothing more than a high calorie candy bar in a bottle with added protein. Chew on that for a while!

review/text: I tried these because I love Kellogg's Fiber Plus bars, which taste much better than the General Mills Fiber One. What a mistake. These do NOT taste good. In fact, they're quite disgusting. The after taste lasts a long time. You'll be tasting these for hours after drinking one.<br /><br />They're filled with fiber, protein and vitamins but it's also filled with sugar and pretty high in calories. I ran out of Visalus so that's why I picked these up at a local store. I will not make that mistake again. Visalus is about 2x the benefit, about the same price (per day), lower in calories, lower in sugar, and tastes a million times better.<br /><br />I don't drink these to lose weight. I use them for nutrition. Regardless of why you want to drink a protein shake, I suggest staying far away from these. Visalus literally tastes like vanilla cake mix. This tastes like a garbage bag.

review/text: This shake tastes great. It is sweet and tastes like creamy vanilla pudding.  It fills you up for a long time, just like its supposed to.  I drink it for breakfast some days when its hectic, and sometimes I have it as a snack.  It tastes better cold.  It is very thick, sometimes I put it in the blender with some ice to break up the thickness.  But then again, if I have time to do that, I usually just eat breakfast.  The aftertaste stays with you a while, so you might want some water to wash it down.  Right now (January 24) you can get these for $4.99 for a 4 pack at Target, which is a better price.  So check around for pricing.

review/text: My human opinion - these are gross, greasy and nasty dog treats that are a part of a once living animal and disgust me out to no end  .....<br /><br />Translated into "dog" .... ONE OF THE BEST EVER TREATS I'VE EVER BEEN GIVEN .....<br /><br />The crazed look of excitement in his eyes when I pull one out is unbelievable.  My dog REALLY LOVES THESE!<br /><br />As for being smaller than regular pigs ears - I actually think that's almost a good thing.  Pigs ears are so fatty, greasy and not good for dogs in large quantities and certainly contribute to any weight problems dogs usually have.<br /><br />Also, due to a heart condition I suffer from, it is physically impossible for me not to respond to my baby dog's face when he wants a treat (my baby - a massive APBT who is the sweetest full grown baby of a dog).<br /><br />Because of my own heart condition, I don't want to over feed/treat my dog, and make him suffer from being overweight because of my own physical needs .... so the smaller size is better.

They do need a little more preparation than a simple cook-in sauce though and this is perhaps their strength & weakness. This particular dish requires you to marinade the diced meat (overnight in the fridge is best) in the sauce - half a jar for 4 chicken breasts. You then brown the meat in a wok with the marinade, add a tin of chopped tomatoes and finish with some plain yoghurt.<br /><br />As you can see, it's not something you can throw together at 5 minutes notice, but neither is it a complicated dish. However, the end result is a very convincing curry. My family are sissies when it comes to currys, but this is a perennial favourite. Not too hot for them and not too mild for me.

review/text: and make chiken tikka without the "gravy" in a Tandoor or (like most of us) on skewers in a very hot oven it is excellent. The Masala bit actually is an invention to please the English back in the days of the Raj.<br /><br />4 parts Tikka Masala Paste<br />1 part hot curry paste<br />1 part yoghurt (I actually prefer Greek yoghurt)<br /><br />Two large chicken breasts cut into "mouth size" bits (actually, a bit larger).<br />Marinate for 7 hours.<br />Place on skewers into a hot oven and cook for 22-25 minutes whilst you have your puppodums and achar (or whatever). Divided into 4 it is an excellent appetiser. In 2, a very flavourful dinner. Serve with or without rice though, no gravy; no need for rice!<br /><br />Patak's have taken an Indian dish and, given the irregularity of the spices, standardized it as much as possible. Given that you can actually get Tikka that isn't as dry as the Sahara (read: most US Indian Restaurants), it's certainly worth a try.

review/summary: Better than most
review/text: While I can taste the sourness that turned off the previous reviewer, it didn't come close to ruining the meal. Far from it in fact. I believe they may have used bad yogurt.<br /><br />This was a good grocery solution to tikka masala at home. It's not going to be as good as your favorite Indian restaurant but, if you follow the directions and go with the recommended overnight marinade, the chicken will be tender. I did not go with the optional 1/4 cup yogurt added in at the end of the cooking process. It was still very flavorful and unmistakably tikka masala.

review/summary: Its alright
review/text: Let me begin by saying that this is my first review of ANYTHING on amazon even though I have been shopping here for more than 4 years. I usually like negative reviews of products because too often people will give glowing reviews to mediocre products that don't deserve them. I myself am not the type of person to whole-heartedly endorse anything without reservations - everything has room for improvement in my opinion.<br /><br />With that said, I liked Patak's Tikka Masala Paste when I used it; however, I did not follow the directions on the package. I was following a Chicken Tikka Masala recipe from America's Test Kitchen when I used it. I had alread spent 3 hours cooking other things in the kitchen and I was dead on my feet. When I realized that I did not have any tomato paste in the cuboard, it came down to using this or a can of Tomato soup. I chose this. I used less than the recommended amount on the jar because I had alread included my own spices in the curry. Also, I used about 2-3 times the amount of other ingredients (such as cream/yogurt/chilies/stewed tomatoes) than the Patak jar calls for.<br /><br />My Tikka Masala came out wonderful(there is the endorsement), but - as I mentioned - I used it as an additive to my spice blend not as the whole thing (there is the disclaimer.)

review/text: I don't really understand why this coffee is so popular.  I like dark, extra bold roasts such as Black Tiger, Emeril's, and GM Double Black Diamond.  However, this coffee tastes to me much more like a medium roast, has a bitter aftertaste and is not very flavorful. If you like dark roasts, I don't think this will be one of your favorites.  However, it has a lot of positive reviews all over the place.  I ordered it twice from two different sites (Keurig and Amazon) to be really sure that I did not just receive a bad batch, but I will not be ordering it again.

review/text: Totally do not like the flavor of this coffee on it's own. It smells great when you first puncture the k-cup, but then it's all down hill from there.  It's fruity, no nuttiness at all, with a strange aftertaste, and kind of weak on a 6oz brew.  It works fine with a cocoa for a mocha, but not good at all by itself.  This is coming from someone who likes the "Dark Magic" and "Double Black Diamond" k-cups.

review/text: My wife is the coffee drinker in the house and we have tried many BOLD blends over the last couple of years. She found the Tullys Italian Roast to be far too weak even on the lowest Kureg setting. The only one we have found that meets her standards is Timothy's Parisian Nights. If you like a nice bold cup of Joe then she would recomend the Timothy's hands down. Amazon no longer sells the Timothy's by auto shipment so we had to go to the Green Mountain website and get the auto shipment there. Good luck

review/summary: Italian roast - just how i like it
review/text: After years of drink the same old Folgers drip coffee a group of us decided to purchase a Keurig unit for our office.  When any one of us purchase a pack of K-Cups we often share with other so that we can find our favorite, and not spend on those that just are not up to par.  I enjoyed the flavor of the Italian roast, and the people that I shared it with said they did too.  So far, out of the ten or so K-Cup "flavors" that I have tried this is my favorite.  Being that it is a "bold" coffee - I can change the cup volume setting of my Keurig unit to alter the boldness...a larger setting yields a slightly less bold cup, and the smaller cup setting will increase the boldness of the taste.  Of course you can do this with any coffee, this coffee seems to fit the boldness range that i desire.

review/summary: This is "the one"
review/text: I have been taste-testing so many brands and roasts of k-cups to determine our favorites that I feel like a 'lab rat.'  The Tully's Italian Roast immediately stood out from the rest--love at first sip! The other reviews are accurate by describing it as aromatic, smooth and flavorful, not bitter nor weak. I make my first cup of the morning by using one k-cup on the large cup setting, then I make my add'l cups of coffee using one k-cup and a combination of both the middle and smallest cup; that way I get more coffee using one K-cup. It still holds a robust flavor but just not as heavily as the first, which is what I like to do after drinking sev'l cups.  I use cream & sugar, so this routine works for me.  You may or may not tend to tweak your ritual the same way, but it just goes to show you that you can "think out of the k-cup."

review/text: You should stop selling these DEFECTIVE Tully's products!<br /><br />I bought 2 packages of Tully's Italian Roast K-cups (48 cups) on July 20, 2011. I quickly discovered that all were defective. The airtight seal on each and every K-cup was broken and, when put into the Keurig coffeemaker, it spilled coffee grounds into both the coffee and the machine.<br /><br />I contacted Tully's customer service line, explained what'd happened and they couldn't have been more rude, condescending and unhelpful. They refused to send a refund or coupon through Amazon (to eventually credit my account) unless I sent these two boxes back and they inspected them. By the time these were opened a month later, the Amazon packing was long gone and these crappy K-cups were despoiling our pantry. My wife tossed them in disgust.<br /><br />Our first and last purchase from Tully's. Shame on them for such lousy customer service and for failing to stand by their products!.

review/summary: Excellent! This is one of my favorites.
review/text: I love Tully's coffees. I usually drink French, sometimes Kona, and recently I tried Italian. I thought at the time I had not tasted anything so good! It was my new favorite. It turns out that I need to switch things around. When I do that, they all seem to taste better. The Italian may not be as bold as the French or Kona, but it sure tastes good. I'll be keeping it on hand along with my other favorites.<br /><br />UPDATE: I just had several cups of Tully's Italian Roast K-Cups after being out of it for several months. I remember now why I never wanted to be without it. It's really good.

review/text: I love Tully's Italian Roast. It is my favorite of all the robust coffees available. I bought this 50 pack and when it arrived there was a note that it was "outdated." I was given the opportunity to return it for a refund, but I don't have time to fool around with returns unless absolutely necessary.  This coffee was good enough to keep, but no where as good as it usually is. The coffee is excellent, but the company from whom I purchased this should have not sent me outdated coffee. Obviously, I will never by from this company. I will, however, continue to buy good Tully's Italian Roast.

review/summary: A little weak....
review/text: I'm an avid drinker of bold coffees...Coffee People's Jet Fuel and Timothy's Midnight Magic are my two favorites.  I love to sample new flavors.  I tried Tully's Sampler which included Italian Roast, French Roast, Kona and House.  In the sampler package I found the Italian to be the strongest and most flavorful with French Roast a close second. I could get a nice bold flavor with the largest cup setting on my Kuerig.  Recently due to a back order situation on Jet Fuel I ordered Tully's Italian Roast to hold me over until Jet Fuel arrived.  Much to my chagrin I found the 24 count package of Italian Roast produces a much weaker flavor than the one I received in the Sampler Package.  I could still get a bold cup but only using the medium setting on my Keurig.  If you like a bold coffee and have family members who prefer medium roast I'd suggest the sampler rather than 2x24 count Italian Roast.  You'll get House and Kona which are both very medium along with two good strong/bold flavorful brews in the French and Italian.

I have had my problems mechanically with the machines but I put up with them because of the good coffee I can get and Keurig does a great job with customer service in my experience. I've been buying Tully's Itailian Roast for quite a while now and love it's full flaver and aroma. In fact I pretty much only buy Tully brand coffee now. I love the Kona blend and that is my favorite right now although I still haven't tried all the ones I'd like to try. It is of course especially good when Amazon puts the Italian Roast on sale because then I really stock up. Try it, you'll like it!!

review/text: The coffee tastes great.  It's bold enough flavor wise without any bitterness.  However, we have an explosion with about every other k-cup.  The foil seal on the top breaks and coffee and grounds spew out the top.  Wouldn't be surprised if shipping in the summer heat weakened the adhesive that seals the foil.  I'd buy it again because I like the coffee so much, but be prepared to clean up messes if you get a batch of k-cups like we did.

review/text: Love my Keurig Coffee Maker for convenience, but hard pressed to find a K-Cup that is strong enough for my first morning cup without a bitter taste.  Tully's Italian does the job.  I drink my coffee black and like a rich coffee taste, Tully's Italian does the job. Shipment arrived promptly in good condition, although the packing box was damaged, torn and crushed.  A book was packed on the bottom without padding and was badly bruised and rumpled, but the coffee came through okay.  I complained to Amazon but never heard back from them with a sorry or offer to replace the book even though I explained it had been purchased for a gift and was now unfit to use as such.  I explained it was a poor job of packaging a soft cover book, since there was no padding or buffer under or around the book and it was jammed into the bottom of the box -- Amazon never responds to complaints about damaged goods.

review/summary: WOW! I can taste the difference
review/text: First of all- I am not a sophisticated coffee connoisseur.<br /><br />I actually think that McDonald's coffee is far more drinkable than Starbuck's burnt rubbish.<br /><br />Anyway, as far as K-Cups, I used to buy "Timothys" and it met my needs.<br /><br />But when I tried Tully's Italian blend for first time today, wow!!- this is very appealing and is so easy to drink. Just the right strength and kick.<br /><br />I noticed that the lids on the k-cups I received today (May 7th) from Tully bulged out quite a bit - clearly they have packed a lot of N2 in these cups. Expiry date is Dec 2010.<br /><br />I recall Timothy's cups do not bulge out as much - but I did not check how far those were from expiry dates.<br /><br />I do not know if the "bulge" out factor impacts coffee taste or freshness but perhaps it helps if you plan to store the K-cups for a long time.

It still has a robust flavor when you use it to brew the largest size.  This is a good cup of coffee.

review/text: I have been drinking tully's for a while now and I have finally taken the time to type a review. If you are looking for a strong, yet smooth and refined coffee this is it! It is not bitter nor does it leave an after-taste. I have turned so many of my friends and family on to it, that they only drink this brand themselves; many of them switching over to a Keurig just for it. I am an extreme coffee drinker and have experienced the bitter and waterty varieties of coffee, so I know bad coffee when I taste it. Tully's is my favorite coffee and is absolutely the best I have tried and the only kind I will buy.

I've tried a huge variety of them, and many of them taste harsh, acidic, and straight out of 7-11 (I'm looking at you, Green Mountain). This coffee has a rich flavor with a hint of sweetness and none of the bitterness going down. I could not recommend it more. This morning I felt compelled to write a review on these simply because I woke up actually looking forward to drinking Tully's Italian Roast vs sleeping in. Italian Roast got me out of bed, folks, and that's hard to do on a Thursday at 6AM.

review/text: This is one of our favorite blends. The k-cups themselves seem to be well-made (no exploders--least so far). Italian is between medium and strong. It's a fairly stout blend without being too smoky (some french roasts go too far into the smoke spectrum for my tastes). This is one of our go-to cups.
