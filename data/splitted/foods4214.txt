review/summary: Vanilla is the Best
review/text: I've tried all of the Dry Soda flavors except the Cucumber and the Juniper Berry. Vanilla Bean is my favorite out of all the flavors I've tried. Yesterday I told my fiance to try the Vanilla Bean since I had just bought a case of them. He loves sweet soda and other sweet drinks, he drinks 3 - 6 cans of coke a day. Yet he told me he loves the Vanilla soda. He said he can't believes that he likes it so much since it doesn't have much sugar in it. The Lavender, the Rhubarb and the Blood Orange are my next favorite flavors. Be warned though the Rhubarb is pretty sour. I personally love sour foods. The Lemon Grass is okay. It slightly has a perfume taste to it. The Lavender just barely has a slight perfume taste. It's so slight that I still really like the Lavender soda. The Vanilla Bean soda is great since it tastes like drinking a marshmellow, only less sweet. If you like gourmet soda I'd definitely try out Dry Soda.

review/summary: Incredibly delicious!
review/text: If you require Gluten-Free food, and you love Italian food, you have GOT to get these!!  OMG, they are fantastic!  You must provide your own sauce - a good thing in my opinion as I make great sauce :o)<br /><br />If you recollect, prior to your Celiac diagnosis, the taste of fantastic Italian food as I do having grown up in New York City, which has some of the greatest Italian food this side of the pond, then you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference. Full of cheesy goodness, perfect pasta, I can find absolutely no fault with this product - and I am picky.<br /><br />Yes, they're a bit pricey, but one pack is enough two adults.  Served with some nice GF breadsticks, and a salad, and if you occasionally imbibe, a glass of good red wine, this is heaven.  And let's face it, life is tough enough for a Celiac - aren't you worth it?  (The response ought to be a resounding YES!)<br /><br />NOTE: Be sure to place your order on Sunday night through Tuesday night to ensure that the package, which is shipped frozen, doesn't thaw too quickly while it languishes in some depot over a week-end.  Mine arrived cold, but thawed.  Froze the other 2 packs and ate the third that same night.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/text: These shells are delicious!  And so easy to prepare.<br /><br />One of the big problems in my GF life is how long it takes to get/make foods that taste like the 'real' thing.  These shells, unlike the Conte's ravioli (which are delicious, too), don't need to be boiled.  Just coat the bottom of a pan in sauce, put in the shells, cover with more sauce so they don't dry out, and bake. Prep time, about 60 seconds.  Then you can do other things for half an hour while they cook.<br /><br />Quick and easy Italian dinner for this gluten-free girl!

review/summary: Incredibly Good!
review/text: I bought these on a whim at my local health food store and wow, I was very impressed with the taste! You wouldn't know the shells were gluten-free for one, and the filling was better than any I'd ever had! Full of flavor and just perfect, really.<br /><br />The only thing is, I saw that the bag said it had 3 servings in it, so when pouring it out into my pan I was a little disappointed that there were only 6 shells. So, they consider 2 shells a serving. Yeah, right. Well, anyway, I did end up eating the whole thing, which was too much. 3 would be fine if you had a salad or meatballs or something else to go with them, but 2. Not! 4 is where I should've stopped, but I just couldn't stand putting 2 shells in the fridge, so I forced myself to eat them. Shame on me, but they sure were good!<br /><br />I paid $7 for them at the store, I believe. So, Amazon's price seems way too pricey! See if your local health food store has them before spending this extra money here and for shipping! They really are probably the best "health" food I've ever bought. Besides ricemellow creme! That stuff is AWESOME!!!

review/summary: Can't believe it's Gluten Free!
review/text: I was thrilled to see that Amazon had started selling frozen Gluten Free pasta.  I ordered both the Conte's shells and raviolis.  They were delivered the very next day at no extra cost, and were still frozen in their shipping container.  The ravioli cooks up quickly and is some of the best ravioli I've ever had.  The shells take a little longer in the oven, but they're worth it!  The only reason this isn't a 5 star review is because it's a little on the expensive side, but if you're weighing it against the cost of going out for a meal, it's about the same price you'd pay for regular pasta at those popular Italian chain restaurants.

Bear in mind though that an 8 oz pack will not go very far.

A bit lighter coffee then I'm used to but it was smooth and well rounded with just the right amount of nutty after taste. I'll be watching for the whole bean since I'm sure it will heighten the flavor. Actually bought some interest in the company (JAMN) since i think Mr. Marley has a winning product. Sure would be fun to sit down with him and listen to stories about his father over a cup of this Joe!

I would buy these again even if I ever find the Chinese restaurant-style ones. Great chips!!!!

I eat them with soups and salads, as well as on their own for afternoon snacks.<br /><br />My favorite way to eat them is with avocado slices on top, dusted with North of the Border's "Montezuma Chipotle Seasoning." (They don't carry this product yet at Amazon, but if your local natural foods store doesn't have it, you can Google it and it's worth the effort.

I usually eat Dr. Kracker's or Ak Mak's, but now I have a new favorite.  The Ryvita is the perfect size for an open-faced snack or a crisp crackers encasing stuff sandwich.  I have had no problem with them falling apart but then I don't pile them with huge amounts of food; I simply use a thin spread like goat cheese, baba ganoush or hummus w/ veggies, cheese, salmon, or faux poultry products.  They are made of rye, salt and H20, nothing more, and they are not as rigid as Dr. Kracker's, but much stronger than Ak Mak's.  They are just right and Amazon offers them for a terrific price!  I'm hooked.

review/text: Ryvita Crackers are a staple item in our house.  We got into them when my wife and I went on a diet and the doctor required us to substitute these for bread.  We have come to appreciate the taste.  They are very crispy and very tasty too.  Our other favorite flavors are Light Rye and Sesame.  Our kids especially love them.<br /><br />These crackers are very common in Europe, especially in England, where they come from.  My aunt lives in London and always brings us some as souvenir when she comes for a visit.

review/summary: A Good Chew
review/text: Our shih tzu Piper had dental surgery to remove four broken teeth. Her dental surgeon vet blamed hard chew treats for the broken teeth. In hindsight some of the chews were so hard that I had to use a saw to cut them in half for sharing between the two dogs. The vet advised us to use the bend test. If the chew isn't flexible, don't give it to your dog.<br /><br />The Nylabone Healthy Edible passes the bend test. Looking at the bone-shaped treat, one would think it is a hard object and a long lasting chew. Piper and Gabby both like these chews. Depending on the dog, these treats can be long lasting without jeapardizing the teeth of the dog.<br /><br />Being a spudophile, I'm pleased that ingredient number four is potato starch. Despite the Nylabone name, these chews contain no plastic. Also lacking are sugar, salt, preservatives, and gluten. The ingredients are natural and it is edible and highly digestible as advertised. Our pooches give the American made Healthy Edibles their barks of approval.

review/text: These are great as a treat, but not as a chew. They are so well liked they don't last. What I can't understand is why a seller that offers Amazon Prime charges albout 3 to 4 times the cost that other prime sellers are charging for the same items and think they will make a profit. I guess it's buyer beware and be a bargain shopper if you don't want to seriously overpay.

review/summary: Made my dog throw up bad
review/text: Our 14 lb Mini Schnauzer easily started splintering this bone in a matter of minutes and being an 'ever hungry' dog he just swallowed these pieces. Seeing this I took the bone away after he ate about a third of it. Less than 24 hrs later when it was time for his breakfast at 7:30 AM (his standard time) he refused to eat! This was the first time he ever refused to break his overnight fast!! But after a few minutes the hunger must have gotten the better of him; he gave in and ate almost all of it (usually he cleans up his little bowl) and about an hour later he threw up all of it in FOUR rounds of puking!<br /><br />I could see small, softened yet still relatively firm pieces of this Healthy Edible "bone" in his vomit. What a shame I went for this thinking it would be a great alternative to feeding my dog indigestible nylon.

review/summary: Amazing customer service
review/text: When I ordered this product, I was too lazy to convert "3-4 mm" to inches and consequently discovered the "Coarse Grinder Salt" was almost 1/4" (1/6" to be exact), way too coarse for my salt grinder.  Shortly after receiving my order from Amazon, I received a courtesy email from the Spice Lab to make sure I was happy with my order.  I replied that actually I was not happy, but the fault was mine because I didn't convert the metric dimensions to English units and consequently didn't realize how coarse the salt would be, which was too coarse for my salt mill.  Two days later I received a package of smaller crystals, no charge.  That's amazing customer service!

review/text: This pink salt has a very nice subtle flavor. I didn't know salt could vary in flavor until I tried this one. We bought the salt initially because (a) it's organic and (b) my daughter wanted pink salt! But the flavor is what really made the difference. I don't know much about salt, but I want to say that this has a "rounded" flavor meaning it isn't harsh or distinctive on food, rather it seems to become part of the food, going in and bringing back the flavor of the food in an enhanced way. Sounds silly, but I am learning good quality ingredients really make a difference.

review/summary: For more than salting foods.
review/text: Yes, I do use this product for salting some of my foods, but it also has another handy use. Because the grains of salt are much larger than normal, I use this salt to clean my cast iron grill and skillet. I pour one or two tablespoons of salt on the slightly warm grill or skillet, and rub the salt into the bottom and sides of the pans with a wadded up paper towel. The salt even quickly makes short work of cleaning the RIDGED bottom of my cast iron grill pan. Works perfectly. I usually keep two or three packages of this product on my spices shelf because I use it frequently both for salting food and cleaning the cast iron.

review/summary: super fast shipping, free samples
review/text: placed the order on tuesday, received it on saturday with the cheapest shipping; super faster. the himalayan salt comes in a sealed ziploc bag that has a bottom that allows it to sit up vertically which is convenient for storage especially if you have way too many spices and sacks of beans and sugars and what not like me. in addition, it came with 3 samples (himalayan salt, lemon citron flake salt, and cyprus white flake salt) weighing quite a few grams each (sorry, doesn't say the weight and i don't have a scale with me at the moment).<br /><br />as far as product quality goes, i typically buy my himalayan salt from whole foods and aesthetically this salt look exactly like the salt i get from whole foods. i haven't tasted it yet, but i bet it tastes like salt. of course price wise this salt (the spice lab) is WAY cheaper than buying himalayan salt at whole foods (even including shipping).

Why would you buy the one pound bag on something that never goes bad when you can get more than double for just a few dollars more.<br /><br />Dr. Mercola's comments regarding Himalaya salt benefits are what started me using this initially a few years ago. Many micronutrients, great purity. One person questioned the iodine: no salt naturally contains iodine unless it is iodized or contains some sort of seaweed. You can easily see his comments at mercola.com.<br /><br />Himalaya salt has a very 'clean' taste--add at the end of cooking.

review/text: I discovered this salt about 2 years ago and have not looked back. I love it. The Spice Lab gives you a high quality product for a great price. It is hard to describe Himalayan salt - you get more salty goodness without using so much. It is delicious!

review/summary: Great taste!
review/text: This salt is so tasty!  It tastes nothing like the iodized table salt.  This has a light, mild taste that greatly enhances meats, vegetables, etc.  It's pink/peach color also looks very pretty in my clear Cole/Mason grinder.  It grinds very finely with no issue.  In fact, this salt grinds so finely that it leaves a fine coating, almost like a powder, around the inside of the clear grinder.  If you're a neat freak, this might bug you a little and you might find yourself wiping out the top of the grinder.  Great salt and the bag lasts a long time.

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: Just like in the store for a fraction of the price. I purchased this to refill my expensive pink salt grinder. A million times better than table salt. I don't know if it tastes any different from regular table salt but I think there is something about the shape of the crystals that changes the way the salt hits your tongue. If you have a good grinder I highly recommend checking this stuff out.

review/summary: Great Salt - difficult to grind

review/summary: Good salt
review/text: The bag was smaller than I expected, but that's probably just me being bad at estimating things.  The salt seems good, however, I was a little disappointed that the photo showed the salt to be much more vibrantly colored than they actually are.  I mean, they are pink, just not so bright pink as it shows.  The salt has a good flavor though.  I'd say it was worth the price.

review/summary: Difficult packaging
review/text: Salt tastes fine, cant say about the health claims. 3 stars is because of the packaging. The grinder top is too large for a comfortable grind. I have fairly large/strong hands and have a hard time turning the grinder. For me, when the grinder is mostly vertical to 45deg, it is difficult/impossible to grind directly onto food. Works fine if cap is left on & held in a horizontal position & them remove cap & use. The grind gives a nice fine grind (better than my OXO I also got at Amazon).

The salt is very high quality and a beautiful pink color.<br />Due to my miscalculation, I ordered crystals that were too big for my grinder.<br />I sent a note and asked if I could exchange it for smaller crystals.<br />Customer service answered quickly and said "They were sending me a bag of smaller crystals" completely free.<br />How wonderful of them!!!<br />You don't see that very often these days. I commend Spice Lab for having such wonderful "customer service!" I am now a dedicated customer!!! Thank you Spice Lab for my quality salt!! I am going to make "Sole" and cook with it every day!!!

review/summary: SALT OF THE EARTH - Himalayan Style
review/text: Silly me, I didn't even know there was such a thing as pink Himalayan salt.  A friend actually mentioned it to me as we were discussing moving into a vegetarian life style.  So now, it's like buying a red, Ford Mustang.  It's all you see on the road or, in this case, on the shelves of the stores.<br /><br />I'm actually glad I purchased this and have stopped using regular old white salt almost totally.  The salt does seem to have a milder taste but I don't find myself using any more of it than I did with the good old "when it rains it pours" variety.<br /><br />Since ordering this from Amazon, I've managed to find some here in my little town but it is way expensive.  When you purchase this you will also need a salt grinder unless you like throwing big chunks of salt at your food.  Worth getting the two together, however, especially if you purchase a grinder with a glass container as the salt really looks attractive in a pretty, transparent grinder.  And, of course, it tastes good, too.  About it's nutritional value I admit to knowing zip.  Does salt HAVE nutritional value?  In the meantime, I give this four stars.  If I find out more about the actual food value I'll update this review.

review/summary: Versatile and Delicious
review/text: I have been preparing and freezing food for my two-year-old son since he began eating solids.  This has been one of his all-time favorites and has become a staple in our household. I prepare it with broth and freeze it in ice trays-it freezes well.<br /><br />Because it's specifically "whole" wheat, I feel I'm giving my son a better food than most other couscous made with just "wheat flour" (which means it's not whole wheat).  And because this version contains soy as well, it's an easy and delicious whole protein in a box.  The flax seed adds some good omegas, too.<br /><br />The texture is not unlike cream-of-wheat, depending on how much hot water or broth you add.  It's also good with frozen peas added after cooking.
