review/summary: Lovely, but also light.
review/text: These are nice... the almonds are fresh, and the light cocoa coating is tasty and not bitter.  The marriage here of chocolate and almond is just right; the only negative thing any person could ever say is this:  compared to an almond dipped entirely in dark chocolate, these pale.<br /><br />If you can eat one single chocolate dipped almond, that would be fine and healthy.  These have fewer calories, and they just feel better for you, especially when you have a handful.<br /><br />Good enough so that I long to try the other flavors.

review/summary: Not Very Good. At All...
review/text: These were hugely disappointing for me. They just taste bad. They're not very "chocolatey" tasting, but they have a very strong artificial sweetener kind of aftertaste. I can't recommend these on any level.<br /><br />I gave these two stars instead of one simply  because they were on sale cheap when I got them. If they had been at regular price, one star would have been generous.

review/summary: Good Treat For A Party, But Pricey for Everyday Munching
review/text: The Emerald Cocoa dusted almonds were tasty.  The cocoa did not overwhelm the nuts and make them sweet, but rather added just a bit of background interest and flavor.  The almond taste still came through and continued to have the appropriate amount of saltiness.<br /><br />Although the taste was wonderful, you did have to get by the fact that they looked liked "dirty nuts".  Knowing what they were before you ate them helped.  I would not buy these on a day to day basis as they are fairly pricey. I do, however think they would be a hit if placed out on a party tray.  They were excellent with the red wine that we tried them with!

review/summary: Chocolate + almonds = A match made in heaven!
review/text: Let me just out myself from the get-go here--I am a HUGE chocoholic.  I am also an almond lover and eat a small handful of dry roasted, unsalted almonds nearly every day.  So, when I saw dark chocolate cocoa-roasted almonds offered on amazon, it seemed a match made in heaven. :)<br /><br />What surprised me most, I think, about these delicious cocoa-roasted almonds is that they are not over sweet (only 1 gram of sugar per 1/4 cup serving).  I worried that they would taste like candy and that is not something I need more of (I am already slave enough to the Sweet Monster!).<br /><br />Another pleasant surprise was that the almonds are not salty.  I have hypertension and need to limit my salt so, when the almonds arrived and I reviewed the nutrition label, I was pleased to see that they only have 25 mg of sodium per 1/4 cup serving and that they are made with dry-roasted vs. oil-roasted almonds.<br /><br />In my chocoholic fervor while ordering, I hadn't paid attention to what size cannister the almonds would come in, so I was again pleasantly surprised to find that they came in a generous 11 oz. cannister.<br /><br />I had some friends over last weekend and put out a dish of the almonds on the table.  I lost count of how many times I heard "Mmm! These are GOOD!" but I know that the dish was nearly empty when they left.

review/summary: Nuts about 'em!
review/text: I am not an almond lover, unless they are deep down inside an Almond Joy bar.  I like cashews, pecans, peanuts--but only the salted varieties. So when these little cocoa dusted beauties arrived yesterday, I was not expecting seduction. I tasted one, and it was good but elusive. So I had a couple. The chocolate taste is so light and tantalizing, it has a sort of cumulative effect, and after the fifth or sixth almond, I could have happily eaten the entire container. They are not very sweet and would make a perfect nibble to serve with dry sherry, if anyone still does that.  (I do, and you should, it's good).  Anyway, I was making a chicken salad for dinner (chunked up chicken, diced apple, green onion and curry dressing which is mayonnaise duded up with a little curry powder, some honey and lime juice).  I looked at the container of cocoa almonds and thought "what the heck" and flung in a big handful. It was the best chicken salad I've ever made. The barely sweet almonds and the barest "what is that???" hint of cocoa, along with the added crunch were knockouts.  Tonight I'm thinking about crushing them and tossing them on top of a microwave baked sweetpotato.  Unless I eat them all first.  Good stuff.

review/summary: A little too much
review/text: Let me start off by saying that I love seeds and nuts. I've never been overly picky about which kinds. Peanuts and almonds being the two front runners. I try to get lots of proteins and aminos daily and you can't find a better healthier source.<br /><br />The idea of not increasing the calories or fat yet giving a hint of chocolate sounded cool. I like the taste of natural almonds and found Emerald Cocoa Roasted Almonds to be a bit too much for me. I can always tell a good nut by the "can I stop eating" factor. I found it very easy to get away from these almonds and didn't find myself craving them at all like I do most seeds/nuts.<br /><br />I'd be willing to try another flavor, but for the time being its natural (no salt) for me.

review/summary: The Subtle and Sophisticated Chocolate Almond
review/text: This most unusual dry roasted almond from Emerald is lightly coated with dark cocoa powder, slightly salty and slightly sweet, and utterly delectable. This is a scrumptious crunchy snack that can also be reasoned as being healthy, since it has dietary essentials like protein and fiber, and therefore good for the body, as well as the emotions, that desperately need some chocolate now and then!<br /><br />The container information estimates that a serving is 1 oz. (about ï¿½ cup), which is actually quite a lot, and it's listed as 150 calories. Chances are though, that you won't stop at 1 oz. with these delicious little morsels in front of you. As a party snack, Cocoa Roast Almonds are a super hit. Although it seems that the cocoa is like a dusting over each nut, they don't leave your hands a terrible mess. Cocoa Roast Almonds make a terrific combo with your favorite beverage as a dessert, and they are also a nifty "on the go" breakfast.  The chocolate nutty aroma is wonderful, and the lightweight container is shaped to fit the palm of your hand. Good job Emerald on this excellent product!

review/text: These nuts taste alright. My main problem with it is that label makes no mention that is uses sucralose (aka Splenda) and modified food starch (aka MSG). These junk ingredients do not make the nuts taste awesome, so it's not worth it putting this garbage into your body. I guess Emerald doesn't realize that the whole point of buying nuts instead of junk food is so that people have a healthier diet.<br /><br />This is the only brand of nuts that has this garbage, all the other brands I've seen have more natural ingredients. Stay away from Emerald brand.

review/summary: Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds disappear from kitchen !!
review/text: I'm not a person who eats nuts by the handful, but these were good for a quick snack.  Nuts are a good source of protein and Vitamin E, but these were a little too calorie laden for me to eat a lot of.  They tasted good and the cocoa made a nice addition to the taste of the almonds.  I felt they would have been good crushed on top of ice cream or into a brownie mix.  Unfortunately, they are ALL GONE. My husband and son are extremely busy and need energy on the run; good snack items are eaten up very quickly.  We received our Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds on Thursday and the container was empty last night.  Sigh.

review/summary: Almonds are good
review/text: I have to admit that at first taste I wasn't impressed with these nuts.  I'm pretty sure you can get the same taste if you just lick an almond and dip it in chocolate coco mix.  Plus I'm not a big fan of dark chocolate so that didn't help.  But after having a few, I couldn't stop.  Finally, my wife had to take them away, insisting that she would be using them in some future culinary masterpiece.<br /><br />Conclusion: Almonds are good.<br /><br />I think even if you washed off the chocolate these things would be addictive. And that's probably not a bad thing since as far as I know nuts are good for ya.

Emerald's Cocoa Roasted Almonds (Dark Chocolate) are an excellent solution to this one drawback.  The chocoalte does not make your hands a mess and you stil get the great taste.<br /><br />One warning perhaps is that this resembles cocoa powder than the form of chocolate one normally gets in a candy bar or in chocolate coated nuts.  It has less of the sweetness than that and more of a bite.  Perhaps an acquired taste, it is none the less excellent and a real treat.

(Plus, they're not the healthiest thing in the world).<br /><br />These Cocoa Roast Almonds were surprisingly different.  The almonds are great (and no one does them better than Emerald), but instead of being "covered" in milk chocolate......these are "dusted" in a dark chocolate. The result is that they're just right:  not too sweet and the chocolate doesn't overpower the almond.<br /><br />The only reason I gave these 4 stars instead of 5 is the addition of sucralose in the product.  I'm not sure what the best solution would have been for a sweetener but I don't generally choose to use sucralose.  Other than that, it's a perfect snack!

review/summary: Imagine snacking on almond-flavored Cocoa Puffs and you're just about there
review/text: I had such a curiosity about these Cocoa Roast Almonds that when they showed up, I took them into the office and asked coworkers to sample them and tell me what their impressions were. One coworker -- I'm call her H -- described the snack as tasting like "almond-flavored Cocoa Puffs." Another coworker -- let's call him J -- said they took him back to his childhood by reminding him of Ovaltine without the milk. Most of my taste-testers concurred with H's description when they heard it.<br /><br />I have been finding these nuts to be a good afternoon snack. They're vaguely chocolately, but not in an overly rich way and not so much so as to make me feel like I'm indulging.<br /><br />If you avoid artificial sweeteners, take note: Sucralose is an ingredient.  Otherwise the ingredients are pretty natural: Dutch-processed cocoa, almonds, salt.<br /><br />So in short: if you like the flavor of Cocoa Puffs, and you think almond flavoring would improve them, and you like quasi-healthy snacking, and you don't mind artificial sweetener, these will probably be a favorite for you. Otherwise, plain roasted almonds may be a better alternative.

review/text: If you are looking for normal chocolate-covered nuts, this is not the snack to choose. However, if you love almonds and the health benefits they have, but are on a low-carb diet, you might want to give these a try. I love chocolate, but try to stick with high-protein, low-carb snacks and I really enjoyed these cocoa roast almonds. They have just a hint of chocolate, so it's not going to satisfy a serious chocolate craving, but I really enjoyed it over typical roasted almonds, and was happy to have some chocolate flavor without having to feel guilty about the carbs that usually come with it. The powdery covering does not come off much on your fingers and while it does use Splenda, I could not detect it at all while eating them.

review/summary: Pure cocoa taste with crunchy almonds inside
review/text: It was almost a 'love at first bite' - the perfectly roasted almond with a nice thin layer of pure flavorful cocoa on the top.<br /><br />You can smell the cocoa as soon as you open the canister - making you want to take a bite.<br /><br />You may or may not like the taste of this cocoa roasted almonds depending on your likingness for cocoa.  We are so much used to the taste of chocolate (which is actually cocoa + many other ingredients like milk ...) - that you might have never really tasted really cocoa.<br /><br />Tasting this item it like tasting and enjoying flavorful pure raw cocoa with crunchy almonds in the center.  Get yourself a box and see for yourself what real cocoa + almonds is !<br /><br />Where this product loses a star is in its packaging - the external sleeve is kind of comes in one piece, so if you try to remove the lid, the external sleeve kind of tends to come off fully - so careful when you are removing the external sleeve for the canister.

review/text: These cocoa covered almonds are great tasting and make for a healthy snack choice. They have a great chocolate flavor to help with those chocolate cravings we all seem to have. My 12 year old daughter also thinks that they taste great.<br /><br />In a time when it seems that almost most everyone is trying to eat healthier these almonds are a great choice without losing any flavor or adding any additional calories.

review/summary: I like my nuts I can not lie
review/text: I have always liked chocolate covered almonds. It's just something aout the combination that is really enjoyable. So, when I got a chance to try these I jumped all over it right away.<br /><br />First off, the container is much bigger than I thought. There are a lot of nuts in one package. Secondly, unlike most chocolate covered nuts, these nuts are baked with the chocolate (not dipped). This dramatically cuts down on the mess.<br /><br />Flavor is very good. Normally I am not a very big fan of dark chocolate it always leaves an odd aftertaste in my mouth. Here, that wasn't the case. It was a perfect mix between tastingt he chocolate and tasting the nut and didn't  leave much (if any) of an after taste.<br /><br />Emerald nuts has always had high quality standards and this product is not any different. I enjoyed my can and will certainly be buying more in the future.

review/text: This product points to the trouble with modern food-processing: overkill. Do we need fake sugar? Or do we just need to consume (a lot) less of the real thing? I won't wax poetic on that point, except to say that these almonds are gross. They are artificially sweetened, the "cocoa" (it's hard to believe, after tasting these, that it's real) is repulsive and they have an aftertaste---like death. Really, hyperbole aside, these are disgusting.

review/summary: an unforgettable eating experience -- maybe someday I'll be able
review/text: My spouse bought these and put them in the pantry.  In cocoa-inspired weakness, I opened the canister, seeking roasted almonds, cocoa, and happiness.  Over the dominant almond and cocoa, it became apparent to me that there was "Something Else" in the can.  No "artificially sweetened" warning.  No "Contains splenda!" flag.  Irresponsible, in my opinion.  I detest the aftertaste of splenda, not mentioned alongside "Emerald Roast Almonds Dark Chocolate flavor" until you read the itty-bitty ingredients text.  Strong black coffee and a slowly nursed-along glass of porter ale over the next few hours finally washed my mouth clean enough to take my mind off of the experience.  When I see an Emerald nut package, it still reminds me of that nasty surprise.<br /><br />The canister went into the trash and I complained to Emerald.  They haven't acknowledged my complaint, and they continue to market artificially sweetened nuts without clearly labeling them as such.  Splenda producers appear to be intent on avoiding the "artificial" label, but that is clearly a misrepresentation on their part.  I now check ingredient lists very carefully.  I don't want to repeat that experience.

review/summary: Weird
review/text: I popped several of these into my mouth without reading the ingredients (which I thought were pretty well covered in the product description). They tasted good for a brief instant and got progressively worse as I chewed. For one thing, they're quite dry (if this review for some reason piques your desire to whip out your credit card, make sure you have mass quantities of liquid on hand--you'll need it). These are, in fact, the driest almonds I've ever eaten.<br />The Dutch-processed cocoa used tasted anemic (I grew up on Hershey's). Insult compounded injury in the form of a bizarre aftertaste. This prompted me to actually read the label...imagine my surprise at discovering that the nuts are sweetened by none other than Sucralose.<br />I don't like Sucralose. The feeling is apparently mutual: it gives me a headache.<br />2 oz. of Cocoa Roast Almonds (Emerald having eschewed the two-word modifier) provides 150 calories, 120 of which, despite their dryness, are from fat. It seems to me that those watching their weight and/or sugar intake could probably find a more enjoyable source of 150 calories.

review/summary: A Great, Healthy Snack!
review/text: Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds, Dark Chocolate, hit the nose quite pleasantly when the canister is opened. Each almond is coated in a dark chocolate cocoa powder, and it really is a nice little treat, even though I normally don't go for almonds when sifting through a can of mixed nuts. I also tend to prefer a more traditional chocolate coating on nuts, but I'm still giving these 5 stars. While I probably wouldn't choose them over a bag of chocolate covered peanuts, these are a high-quality and highly enjoyable alternative that I kept popping into my mouth despite my usual aversion to almonds outside of an Almond Joy bar or bag of M&M's. You'll need a drink handy though. Almonds are dry little nuts, and since these employ a powder for their not very sweet cocoa flavoring, they're no exception. The container is very attractive, by the way, and my only complaint about it is that it does not close very securely. I mean, it's one of those lids you can turn easily past the tightening point. Still, a great product I highly recommend trying to anyone who loves the taste of cocoa and almonds. Might not be your cup of tea, but they're well worth a try.<br /><br />From the container:<br /><br />Ingredients: Dry Roasted Almonds, Modified Food Starch (potato), Natural and Artificial Flavors, Cocoa Powder (processed with alkali), Salt, Acesulfame Potassium, Sucralose.<br /><br />Allergy Information: Processed on equipment that also processes other tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, soy, milk, and sesame seeds. May contain other tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, soy, milk, and sesame seeds.<br /><br />Nutritional Information per serving (l ounce): Calories 150, 120 from fat, Total Fat 13g, Saturated Fat 1g, Trans Fat 0, Polyunsaturated Fat 3g, Monounsaturated Fat 8g, Cholesterol 0, Sodium 25mg, Potassium 210mg, Total Carbohydrate 6g, Dietary Fiber 3g, Sugars 1g, Protein 6g, Calcium 6%, Iron 8%, Vitamin E 35%.

review/text: I was excited to try this product.  I am reasonable fan of almonds.  (especially fond of smoked almonds) and I like chocolate.<br />However the combination of the dry cocoa powder, which is slightly bitter, and the dry unsalted taste of the almond doesn't really seem to work.<br />Frankly first impression is one of blandness.<br />Maybe because my palette leans toward the sweet side, these just seem bland.  The combination almost offsets the benefits of either taste.  It's just not a sweet taste, and that was what I expected.

They have a nice chocolate flavor, not too sweet, and very crunchy, toasted almonds. For the same calories as regular almonds, that's quite a feat. My only complaint would be they're a little dry. Have a beverage nearby to fully enjoy your snack. I passed them around at work and the consensus was "pretty good!" It's not as good as the real thing, but quite a good substitute!

review/summary: Somewhat dry, but a pleasant enough alternative to chocolate coated nuts...
review/text: Emerald's Cocoa Roast Almonds is a fine, alternative way to indulge ones chocolate/nut cravings without all of the chocolate calories.<br /><br />Rather than dipping almonds into chocolate syrup or batter, the nuts are roasted with a lightly coated layer of chocolate powder. One ounce is only 150 calories, with only one gram of saturated fats, making this a healthy alternative to standard chocolate treats.<br /><br />The taste? Pleasant enough, but lacking the inherent richness one commonly associates with the tasty combo of chocolate and nuts, replaced in its stead by the fairly dry, pasty sensation of dipping whole nuts into instant hot chocolate mix. This means that Emerald's Cocoa Roast Almonds is a fairly satisfying nut snack, even if it is rather lacking as a chocolate one.<br /><br />All in all, not bad, but best washed down with a cold, or hot, glass of milk.

review/summary: Beware - Artificial Sweeteners!
review/text: The nuts were very tasty and if you don't mind the artificial sweeteners, they may be for you.  If you are expecting chocolate covered almonds, you'll be disappointed.  They are what they say however; "cocoa roasted".  They have a modest cocoa flavor with a bit of sweetness.<br /><br />The reason I gave them only 2 stars is because they fail to disclose on the front label that they contain not only one but two artificial sweeteners.  This annoys me because 1) artificial sweeteners bother my stomach and 2) many people don't want to eat artificial sweeteners or give them to their kids.  It irks me when manufacturers try to pawn their wares as a "healthy" snack yet omit the fact that they contain artificial sweeteners or ingredients.<br /><br />One used to be able to spot artificial sweeteners easily by "sugar free" or "NutraSweet" clearly printed on the label but for some reason, the FSA allows products to contain sucralose (a.k.a. Splenda) without any clear labeling at all.  You must read the ingredients to learn these nuts contain both sucralose and acesulfame potassium, two artificial sweeteners.  Shame on you Emerald!

review/summary: These Almonds Have Me Sitting On The Fence
review/text: When I got my hands on these Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds, I thought that the concept was actually pretty good.  I had my doubts, though.  When I opened the container, there was a very, very light chocolate smell that was overwhelmed by the natural smell of the almonds.<br /><br />After trying a few of the almonds, I tasted only a slight hint of chocolate (especially in the aftertaste).  I tasted no salt whatsoever.  The almonds themselves had a rather bland taste to them.  Perhaps it was the mixing of the two flavors that negated both of them.  Mind you, there was nothing terrible about the taste.  It was just bland.<br /><br />The crunch factor was about the only redeeming quality of these almonds.  Dry roasting provided a very nice loud crunch.  The dark chocolate "dust" wasn't messy, but a tiny tad of it did get on my fingers.  It was easily washed off, however, and this really isn't a major concern for me.<br /><br />What has me fence-sitting, though, is the fact that when my wife came home later in the evening, she tried the almonds and fell in love with them.  I was fully prepared to give a two-star rating to these almonds until she gave them such glowing approval.  In the end, I guess that it all boils down to personal taste.  If you like very light and (at least to me) very bland chocolate and nutty tastes mixed together, get yourself some of these Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds.  However, if you're taste buds lean heavier towards the chocolate end of the spectrum, stick with Goobers.

review/text: Low-carbers who've experienced the make-or-break chocolate-craving moment can thank their lucky stars that these exist. Just when your will is weakest, a few of these extremely chocolatey treats can make a respectable substitute for peanut M&Ms. In a way, they're even better, because they don't make your blood sugar seesaw wildly.<br /><br />I do agree with some of the critical reviews of these almonds: They are not for people who hate Splenda. However, I don't find the amount of Splenda excessive. I find it just right. Most importantly, the almonds are huge and fresh and perfectly roasted. The cap also makes a handy serving size. I keep one canister in the car and one by my desk to ward off hunger pangs and candy cravings. And my 5-year-old son loves these and eats 'em like candy. He doesn't know they're good for him... that'll be my little secret.

review/text: To me nuts are ho-hum.  I can take them or leave them.  They are a good snack and make you full; these on the other hand are awesome!!!<br />I have to move the canister so I wouldn't eat them all.<br />To me at first bite it tastes like a chocolate covered donut.  The flavor mixture of almond and semi-sweet dark chocolate makes my taste buds do a happy dance.<br /><br />I have found my new pick me up, need something sweet that won't ruin my calories for the day, snack!!

review/text: I have been trying to cut way down on my sugar content.  I have a huge sweet tooth and trying to eat healthier is a challenge.  I really liked this product a lot.  It very much helps me with my chocolate craving.  Yes they are dry, they are ALMONDS! There is a tiny aftertaste from the Sucralose but I HATE any kind of artificial sweetners and really for me this wasn't bad in the least.  This is a health food product not candy and I think should be rated as such.

review/text: Yes, almonds are one of the good foods and so is dark chocolate. Put them together and you've got a can't beat combination. These almonds are toasted to perfection and the antioxidants in there are good for you. The only danger with this terrific snack is the possibility of overeating. Try these one time and no other almonds will compare.

review/summary: Love these nuts!
review/text: I wasn't even aware of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ55RW">Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds</a> until earlier this week. I saw that Amazon was having a sale on most all of that brand, the reviews looked great and so I ordered them.<br /><br />Not really sure what to expect when I got these, I opened them up and tried one. Immediately I was hooked!! The best way I can describe the flavor is nutty with a rich cocoa flavor that's not too sweet. My daughter compared the flavor (not the sweetness) to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5E6E">Cocoa Puffs</a>. I'm not sure about that, but figured I'd add it into my review anyway.<br /><br />I like that these have a good amount of protein, not a much sugar (sweetened w/ sucralose) and relatively low in carbs. All in all a good snack alternative to satisfy my sweet cravings.<br /><br />At the time of this review these Emerald nuts and many others are being offered at a nice checkout discount and if you choose Subscribe & Save it is an even better deal!

review/summary: Perfect for a nip of chocolate flavor without gooey sweetness
review/text: I love these almonds.  They are absolutely perfect for that mid-afternoon snack time when your tongue is desiring chocolate but your body needs something a bit more healthful to get through the day.<br /><br />These have a very light cocoa flavoring.  I appreciate that because I find them refreshing rather than cloying in their sweetness.  It's just enough of an accent to the natural almond flavor to be interesting without overwhelming the nut.  I appreciate, too, that this doesn't have the sugar content of candy, but it satisfies the craving.

review/summary: Bittersweet chocolate snack...
review/text: This was a tasty product, if you like the bittersweet taste of dark chocolate.  I liked that it was "healthy" with the almonds. The chocolate coating was like a dusting of that you might use for cocoa, rather than the creamy chocolate of a candy bar.  It would be good for a light snack that also has some health benefits in case you're looking for that in a snack.

review/summary: Sooooo Yummy but plan on going to the gym afterwards!
review/text: These arrived in the mail and although I am usually the one to open all packages my husband got to these first. How did I know that? Well, half the container was mysteriously empty and the UPS guy JUST delivered them. After one bite of these delicious nuts, I solved the mystery. My husband was in his office just finishing off his last handful when I walked in and he yells "THESE ARE ADDICTIVE, THEY ARE INCREDIBLE". Right then and there I knew, I could only eat a few more or someone would have to call the show Intervention on me. I like almonds but these are exceptional with their slight, not overwhelming cocoa/chocolately taste. They taste  so good I just can't bring myself to buy anymore because one is just not enough. I HIGHLY recommend these in moderation otherwise, eat a whole container but then spend at least an entire week at the gym burning them off. Enjoy!!

review/summary: Chocolate Covered Almonds w/o the Chocolate?
review/text: Cocoa Roast Almonds?  Dark chocolate flavor?<br /><br />Well, I love nuts, and I also love chocolate.  And these almonds DO have a chocolate flavor to them - no doubt about it.  Of course the do NOT have that nice, soft, creamy chocolate covering that melts in your mouth...  But then, the only reason you are even CONSIDERING these is because ... you are on a diet.  (sigh).<br /><br />Considering the diet restrictions, this product will give you the taste satisfaction of chocolate and nuts, but not all the satisfaction of sucking off the chocolate and then eating the nut.  Sorry about that, but that's the way it is.  But, you do get a very healthy snack, and if you are wanting something different, the strong hint of dark chocolate, you gotta try these!

review/text: I'd heard about these from a few people, but the price in the supermarket, generally about $6/jar, kept me from trying them.  These aren't too sweet and the chocolate flavor isn't overwhelming--think of a dark chocolate bar.  I don't have much of a sweet tooth so I found these pretty satisfying, but I'd keep these as an occasional treat only.

review/summary: Training is everything. The peach was once a bitter almond; cauliflower is nothing but cabbage with a college education.-M.Twain
review/text: I don't usually like plain almonds; when I eat almonds they are usually highly sugared, covered in cinnamon or gooey'd up in honey like the ones you can get warm at the mall.  When I saw this product, I thought it sounded yummy, so I thought I'd give them a try, turns out I was right.  They have just enough cocoa to satisfy my sweet tooth, but not too much that it covers up the flavor of the nut.  It's not as sweet or as sugared as those mall almonds, these have a more subtle taste.<br /><br />I have been trying to snack in between meals and found grabbing a small handful of these was both delicious and satisfying.  Even my husband and son enjoyed them.  I was pleasantly surprised with this product and can see me keeping these in my pantry for my little midnight snack attacks.<br /><br />Cherise Everhard, June 2008

review/summary: Definitely different and a nice change from salted nuts
review/text: I really like Emerald nuts, and have been buying their smoked almonds and cashews a while. These cocoa roast almonds preserve much of what I like about Emerald nuts - freshness, not too much oil, high quality - but are more of a semi-sweet snack instead of a salty one.<br /><br />Their sweetness doesn't come from sugar, though. They are sweetened lightly with sucralose (the sweetener sold under the brand name Splenda).<br /><br />Note that the product doesn't contain chocolate, though it's described as "dark chocolate flavor". The cocoa is roasted into the surface of the nut, but the almonds are not coated in chocolate. The good part about that is that they don't make a mess, and they're a better choice for someone who is trying to avoid sweets. But I'm sure some have bought these expecting to get chocolate and were disappointed.<br /><br />I liked them enough that I'll get them again, especially when I need something to cut the craving for chocolate candy. They have just enough chocolate flavor to do that, while having only one gram of sugars per serving.

review/summary: Cocoa Almonds
review/text: I tried them and they are quite good - a novelty over regular almonds. The quality was quite high. The nuts in a newly opened package were fresh and crisp in texture with a very good taste.  I had 3 people try them, and all three said they liked them, and two said they would buy them at the grocery.  I would also buy them. Now more people have tried them with very positve response.  The only negative was too much green in the packaging, which did not affect the flavor if served in the dark.

review/summary: As a snack, ok.  As an ingredient, wonderful.
review/text: As a snack directly out out of the can I found these dry.  I guess when I think of chocolate almonds I like the mouth feel of actual chocolate melting and thus these almonds left me wanting more.  However, I found them to be an excellent ingredient in recipes that call for almonds.  Since they have  a LOT less salt than the typical almond they do not conflict with the sweetness of a dessert and the coating seems to keep them more crunchy in the batter.  I used them both whole in  brownies (fantastic) and chopped in choc chip cookies (great).  I chopped up too many for the cookies and used them to dust over vanilla ice cream served with the brownies.  Everyone raved about them.

review/summary: not what I expected...
review/text: "Chocolate without guilt" is a good idea, and coating nuts with sweetened cocoa powder (the sweetener is a mixture of a sugar alcohol -- sucralose -- and acesulfame) not a bad one at all. But the result is disappointing.<br /><br />The chocolate and almond tastes tend to hide each other rather than to complement each other. I was expecting an intense chocolate+almond taste, but didn't get it. There wasn't much of either.<br /><br />I tried sucking off the cocoa, but the naked almond was not particularly satisfying. A "good" almond, but not a great one.<br /><br />Almonds have a relatively delicate taste that (for me) is best appreciated without any enhancement. (I never cared for Jordan almonds.) A cocoa coating would probably work better with a stronger-flavored nut.

review/text: Almonds in this product are quite good.  The coating is well-bonded, and they are neat to eat.  Having the lid measure out a 1.5 ounce serving is a nice touch, but not a big deal.  The flavor definitely reminds me more of cocoa than of chocolate, and isn't terribly strong.  Definitely do not buy these thinking you are getting chocolate-covered nuts of some sort!  But they are a decently healthy snack, and much healthier than eating said chocolate-covered nuts.  I'd rate them higher if the price was more economical, but as it is they are too pricey for a casual snack, but not "snazzy" enough for something ornate and formal.  For this price, I'd rather get cashews!

review/summary: mmmmm....  chocolate....  almonds...
review/text: Usually when I think of nuts and chocolate together, I imagine the typical chocolate-dipped candy that happens to have a nut inside.  These Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds were a surprise departure from the "candy" path.  The nuts are dusted with a fine layer of dark chocolate power, meaning that the almond flavor is primary with a subtle chocolate background.  As a person who loves both those flavors, I felt like I was getting the best of both worlds...  a healthy snack that had a bit more "zing" than the typical offering.<br /><br />If I were in the mood for something to munch on without resorting to candy, this would be something I'd now consider as a possibility.  Another nice feature is the packaging...  the lid measures out a serving when you use it as the "bowl" for the nuts.  That goes a long ways towards avoiding the typical over-estimation of portion size.<br /><br />Good flavor, helpful packaging...  This probably won't be my last purchase of these almonds.

review/summary: Nuts and chocolate, how can you go wrong?
review/text: Chocolate and nuts, two things that are great by themselves, but even better together!<br /><br />I love almonds, raw, roasted, spicy, sweet, you name it. So when I had the opportunity to try these I jumped on them.<br /><br />The first thing I did was read the label and I was disappointed to see that they added artificial flavoring and sweetener to them, not exactly my favorite thing to read on a label. Nonetheless I cracked the package open and tasted.<br /><br />After eating a small handful I was glad to see that they weren't overly sweet and you still tasted the almond.<br />The chocolate coating is a dry coating, so it doesn't melt off or leave a sticky residue. Sadly though I found the chocolate to be a bit weak and more of a semi-sweet, not dark.<br /><br />The nuts themselves were high quality, not a single one was over roasted or left a bitter nasty taste in my mouth, Diamond definitely provides a high quality nut!<br /><br />Overall these are a great snack, barely sweet and with a hint of cocoa. That and they are a good source of protein and vitamin E.

review/summary: Tasty and Nutritious
review/text: 'Men's Health' magazine has been heralding nutritious foods for men of different ages for some time now.  Almonds have conspicuously been high on their lists (along with Merlot wine and dark chocolate) as a flavorful food high on the chart for heart health.<br /><br />While I've implemented almonds in my diet for quite some time now, I couldn't help but notice Emerald's "Cocoa Roast" Almonds are fresher and tastier than the "bulk" almonds I get at the grocery store.  With a hint of dark chocolate, yet retaining a nutty "roasted" base, these savory little nuggets make a good, light snack.<br /><br />High in vitamin E, iron, and calcium, and having mostly good lipids (fats), almonds are a delicious way to keep a balanced diet.  Don't expect "Cocoa Roast" Almonds to be a total confection--like chocolate covered raisins.  With only 150 calories per ounce, a little bit goes a long way.  Having only the best ingredients, these almonds are a great reward for all hard-working people on the go.<br /><br />(With four canisters per order and 11 oz each, you can reward yourself nutritiously for an entire month!)<br /><br />(Nutrition: 5 *'s, Taste 3.5 *'s, Value 4.5 *'s  Overall: 4 stars)

review/summary: Unique product
review/text: Being an almond farmer myself, I am always interested to see what new flavors come out. Emerald is a subsidiary of Diamond Walnuts. The description indicates that this flavor is a substitute for the  chocolate covered nuts you may have already had.<br /><br />These merely have cocoa baked onto them. It does give the nut a nice earthy flavor. They have been roasted to the proper crunchiness. But these are not very sweet. If you are looking for them to be a dessert type snack you will be disappointed. The flavor is slightly more savory. The cocoa does not come off in your hand as much as you might expect... a good thing. These would be a nice classy addition to a party/gathering.

review/summary: great for the dark chocolate and almonds lover
review/text: When I had ordered this product, I was expecting lightly dark chocolate covered almonds. These almonds were a bit different from what I had expected. They're actually almonds that have been dusted with dark cocoa powder.  I only point this out for others who may have expected smooth dark chocolate covered almonds. At any rate, these almonds were still very delicious and the dark chocolate cocoa powder complimented the taste of roasted almonds very nicely. Here are some pros and cons in my humble opinon:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Great taste with a bouquet of complex aromas and textures... yummy.<br />-Large 11 oz canister container, perhaps not good if you're on a diet :)<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-I would've liked it a bit sweeter... perhaps a touch of honey would have been splendid... in fact, I'm sure it would've been.<br /><br />conclusion: If you enjoy roasted almonds and love dark chocolate, these almonds will hit the spot. Just remember... these are dusted, not chocolate dipped!

Being an idiot, I've tested this with several different Splenda containing products & found that the sweetner is the problem. SO if you are like me, avoid this product.<br /><br />That said, I did pop a few in my mouth before reading the label & they are yummy. I am only a sometimes fan of almonds, but I love dark chocolate.<br /><br />My partner (who doesn't have a Splenda hating noggin & who loves dark chocolate even more than me) was quite fond of these little nuggets. 6g protein (and 13g fat) in a 1/4 cup...not bad.

review/summary: Subtle and Sweet Almond Boost
review/text: I would hope it would go without saying, but if you don't like plain almonds, you probably won't like them sprinkled with cocoa powder. I like almonds, particularly for their health benefits that are fairly well known. I usually avoid them covered in salt and flavoring powder, but I'm glad I gave these a try.<br /><br /> The packaging suggests Dark Chocolate, and it would be easy to get the wrong idea that these will taste chocolate in the sense of Milk Chocolate perhaps. I just expected them to taste like almonds and cocoa, which they do, so they are semi sweet and like other reviewers have noted, they will appeal most to dark chocolate fans.

review/text: What I expected were almonds covered with a chocolate glaze, like the ones you'd get at the movies, except dark instead of milk chocolate. These aren't that. The almonds are instead covered with a very light, only subtly sweet powdering of chocolate - only one gram of sugar per quarter-cup serving, which is hardly any. It's not really a sweet and you don't feel like you're eating candy. If you have these around, the kids won't eat them. They'll leave them for you.

The taste is wonderfully delicious but not decadently so.<br /><br />My first taste gave me a blast from the past if just for a brief millisecond. COCOA PEBBLES! Ah! But it was only for the briefest moment, then the yummy nutty roasted almond flavor kicks in. I have no complaints with that...snacking on sugary childhood cereals, though divine on the lips, will wreck havoc on the hips. I'll gladly upgrade to Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds and enjoy nearly the same divine pleasure without the guilt.<br /><br />The cocoa flavor is rather fleeting but it still makes these snacks worthwhile. I enjoy roasted almonds, but I tend to get bored with them quickly. Too many jars of roasted almonds have gotten stale on my shelf from neglect. With Emerald Cocoa Roast almonds, the cocoa roast flavor keeps me coming for more without wanting to overindulge either. A few nuts is all it takes for me to enjoy a tasty cocoa treat, still enjoy the healthy benefits of almonds, and be satisfied. It's a great balance of wanting to spoil yourself yet still enjoy a healthy treat.<br /><br />Now, the naughty girl in me will want to spill these lovely cocoa-covered nuts on top of a chocolate frosted chocolate chip cake, call it healthy, and have a divine chocolate experience...but that's cheating big time. I'll be happy with these cocoa roasted nuts and avoid the cake for now.<br /><br />My only negative with Emerald is their price, but you get what you pay for. With Emerald, I always know I'm getting quality nuts that are going to taste GREAT, regardless of the flavor.<br /><br />If you like roasted almonds and enjoy the flavor of cocoa, I don't doubt you'll enjoy these nuts. Emerald make good nuts and these are no exception. Cocoa roasted almonds are the healthy alternative choice to chocolate almond candies. No guilt on the conscience.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've shared these with my family and the one thing we agree on is that the cocoa flavor goes too quickly. Longer lasting cocoa flavor would be super. Other than that, we all like and enjoy these nuts. As for me, I'm getting quickly addicted to them. I'm finding myself floating back to these yummy nuts to get more. Great snack! I'll GLADLY buy these again.<br /><br />UPDATE #2: I WANT TO UPGRADE TO FIVE STARS! I've tried some other of Emerald's nuts and the Cocoa Almonds come out tops! These have become number one in my book. I crave these!

review/summary: Too tempting to keep around?
review/text: Admittedly, food preferences are very personal.  That said, wow!  To me these taste like homemade almond brownies.  I like the flavor. The cocoa flavor is rich and the baking process increases its depth. And they'd be great for guests.  But there is no way I'll keep something like this in the house.<br /><br />And I find the idea that the container is shaped for the cup holder of a car to be very strange.  The idea of driving along and popping these little caloric bombs makes me shudder.  I doubt this is what nutritionists mean when they suggest eating nuts as part of a balanced diet.

review/summary: What's Not to Love??????
review/text: With almonds and chocolate, what's not to love? Well... these aren't dipped in chocolate almonds, these are baked in chocolate flavor. The baked in chocolate flavor provides no mess but the baked in flavor kind of gives it a burnt flavor to me. These almonds were just alright, I was a little disappointed in them. They also get their lightly sweet flavor from Sucralose which I think provides a fake kind of sweetness flavor. Overall, if you really love almonds and are looking for a healthy snack then you might like these but if you are looking for a chocolate snack then you'll be disappointed with these.

review/summary: Good except for artificial sweetener
review/text: When I ate my first handful of these I thought "wow, these bad boys are amazing and I have a feeling I'll be pounding through a canister really quickly". However, shortly thereafter I had that awful aftertaste in my mouth of artificial sweetener. In shock, I looked at the ingredients and sure enough, there was the dreaded ingredient.<br /><br />All-in-all, not bad if you don't mind artificial sweetener. I hate the stuff so these were not for me.

review/summary: Not That great.
review/text: While the Almond taste is on point, the chocolate taste is not. They were pretty much just plain dry roasted almonds with Cocoa powder mixed with Splenda sprinkled on them. I could only really taste the chocolate with my first bite. After a few bites, All I could taste is almond. The light chocolate taste was just a little too light for me. And for someone who eats chocolate like it's becoming extinct, this is a bad thing. Plus, the chocolate powder was very difficult to remove from my hands.<br /><br />PROS<br />1. Great Almond Flavor<br /><br />CONS<br />1. Just a hint of chocolate - for others this may be a pro but for me, EH, not such a good thing<br />2. Coated in a messy chocolate powder. - It's Best if you have mouth to canister contact when eating these.<br /><br />To sum it all up, I've had better.

review/summary: Missing something
review/text: I have had a number of other emerald products and all have been good. These just didn't taste right to me. So I offered them to a number of coworkers and they all agreed.<br />Most say they needed salt. A few said they needed some sugar. About three people liked them they way they were. About two thirds said they would not purchase them. I myself wouldn't buy them if offered a choice.<br />The two flavors just don't seem to mix well.

review/summary: Satisfying, Tasty, Vitamin E Rich Snack
review/text: Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds are a fabulous new product. They somehow provide the nutrition and satisfying crunch of almonds with the flavor of delicious rich dark chocolate.  The chocolate really is baked in and does not come off in a powdery mess on hands, face or clothes like so many snack products do.  Because there is virtually no mess or clean up these chocolate almonds are a great snack for the office or on the go.  The lid can even be used as a measured container for one serving to help with portion control and the canister can easily be tucked in a desk drawer or stowed in a car. There are eleven, 150 calorie, one ounce servings in each canister and each ounce only has six grams of carbohydrates making this a great treat for carb counters as well as calorie watchers.

review/summary: Nut Lover Who Loves Them!
review/text: I like a wide variety of nuts and find myself choosing to snack on nuts (if not fruit) when I get the urge to munch.  So as not to get too monotonous, I do like to switch things up among some of the more high protein nuts.  Consequently, upon seeing these cocoa roasted almonds, I was thrilled to try them.<br /><br />I actually love the taste of these nuts.  My comments:<br /><br />(1)  They have just enough cocoa to give them a nice sweetness without being overwhelming (and making you feel like you just consumed a week's worth of calories in a single snack).  I am not a big sweet lover which makes this characteristic appealing; To one with a big sweet-tooth or looking for an after-dinner dessert, you might find yourself disappointed with these.<br /><br />(2)  For the people that tested these in my household, the appeal was widespread.  My husband and two children (ages 2 and 5) loved them, probably even more than I.  They came to the consensus that the cocoa coating tasted a bit like an Oreo cookie.  With the lower calories and healthy protein, I am happy to have my children snack on these versus some of the other cookie/cracker options out there.<br /><br />(3)  The container is nice -- a good size and shape for holding.  It was easily managed by myself as well as my 2-year old.  The top is a screw-top which, in my opinion, is much nicer than the common flip tops.  I am uncertain as to whether the snacks stay fresher this way (the nuts did not last long enough to test it) but the top minimizes spills that can be frustrating with the flip tops.<br /><br />All in all, I would buy these again.  Further, I would recommend them to someone who likes almonds and can appreciate the mild sweetness of the cocoa coating.  If you are looking for a sweet, chocolate covered nut (like a mini milk-chocolate snickers), you will be disappointed.  This is not a candy bar but it is a great alternative snack.

review/summary: Sorry, I didn't agree with y'all
review/text: These fell short on flavor, sweetness, and satisfaction. As other reviewers have mentioned, they do have a bit of an after taste too.  Trader Joe's are way better and at a much better price.<br /><br />For those that absolutely want less calories and low sugar they would get you by, but for me, I'd rather have a little less of something really good.

review/summary: Tastes good, but not for chocolate lovers (3+ stars)
review/text: Anything that claims to be "dark chocolate" flavored immediately has my attention, as I'm a true chocoholic with a preference for the intense bittersweet flavor of a good dark chocolate.  Unfortunately, these cocoa-dipped almonds don't deliver on the promise of their name, although they are indeed a good, nutritious (but high fat) snack with a hint of sweetness and chocolate flavor.  Not surprisingly, the predominant flavor is almond; the nutty, skin-on taste overwhelms the chocolate dusting.  Nut lovers will likely appreciate the twist on an old favorite since the cocoa does indeed bring out the almond flavor.  The almonds are crunchy and roasted to perfection, with few or no overdone brown interiors.<br /><br />Diabetics and others who watch their sugar intake will be pleased to learn that this snack contains only 1 gram of sugar per 1/4 cup serving because of the addition of sucralose, an artificial sweeteners better known commercially as Splenda.  Dieters, however, will want to be careful with the 13 grams of fat in that same size serving.<br /><br />In general, I like Emerald nut products, but this one disappointed me, mostly because I found the chocolate flavor lacking and because I try to avoid artificial sweeteners.  When I crave nuts, I go right for this canister, but when I crave chocolate, I look for something else.<br /><br />Also from the same company and recommended by me:  Emerald Nuts Glazed Pecans, Pecan Pie, 5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ELWG3E">Emerald Nuts Dry Roasted Peanut, Honey Roasted Peanut & Cocktail Peanut, 4.5-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 18)</a>, Emerald Nuts Glazed Walnuts, Original, 7-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)

review/summary: Cocoa dust delight
review/text: These cocoa dusted almonds are really nice; since they are not covered in melted chocolate they are drier and nuttier with that dark cocoa topping, overall way better than candy. I find myself reaching for them a few times a day, after a while I really develop a taste for them.<br /><br />I like that these are slightly drier, it makes for a crispy snack versus the Marcona almonds which are chewier. I liked both though.

review/summary: Passes the kid Test
review/text: I'm shocked at the number of elementary students who seem to subsist on hot cheetos, so I took my containter of cocoa roast almonds to school to see if kids could be induced to try something semi healthy.  For my part, I found the almonds a little dry, so I was not sure how the kids would like it.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  They loved the almonds and begged for more.  So if you want to give your kids something more healthy for lunches and snack (and anything is better than hot cheetos) then this is a great product.  Now, if only we could get these cocoa almonds for the same price as cheap chessy snacks utterly devoid of nutritional value.

review/summary: Emerald Cocoa Roasted Almonds, dark chocolate
review/text: This is the best dark chocolate roasted almonds out there. I tried Blue Diamond & other brands, this one's the best. Note: it does NOT have sugar, no gooey chocolate coating, just a dusting of dark chocolate powder. About 21 almonds have 150 calories. It's great for diabetics and low carb eaters. Even a few almonds helps with hunger. It's so delicious that if you have a sweet tooth, and would have a craving for a chocolate bar, this will do the trick. But since they are so delicious, the trick is to eat just a few at a time. You can order this via Amazon as I do, for convenience, but it is widely available at major stores as well.

review/text: These are exactly what they say they are- cocoa roasted almonds.  People expecting an overly sweet, chocolate covered almond are going to be disappointed.  They do contain artificial sweeteners which seem to be one of the biggest complaints, but I'd also counter that with the argument that normal chocolate covered almonds have it too.  Overall, they're sweet, but not overtly so.  A good snack for people looking for a slightly less sugar loaded version of a sweet almond.
