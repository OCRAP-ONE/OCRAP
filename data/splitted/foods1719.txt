review/summary: The perfect format for a student like me, but be careful
review/text: Three important details about me:<br />1. I have a ridiculously fast metabolism so I always want snacks.<br />2. I'm a student often stuck in long, boring lectures or labs.<br />3. I'm cheap.<br /><br />That's why I was so elated when I found this deal.  I already love Oreos and I'm always searching for small snacks I can shove in my backpack when I'm running out the door.  I tend to buy boxes of snacks and just cycle through them: peanut butter crackers, Nutty bars, bags of M&Ms, Moon Pies, etc.  The 48 pack of Oreos was my most recent one and definitely one of my favorites.<br /><br />They're packaged pretty lightly in little bags of 6 Oreos and I find it to be the perfect amount so that I'm satiated but not wasting any due to losing taste.  One pack of 48 will last me at least a month (sometimes I eat two or three packs in a sitting, okay?) so Subscribe & Save seemed to be my perfect snack solution.<br /><br />Of course I didn't realize how much Subscribe & Save sucks.  The price on these literally doubled after my first month and I had to cancel my subscription.  That said, the product is great but don't trust subscribing through Amazon.

review/summary: Still The Best.....
review/text: I have had an Oreo addiction since just about the time I knew what a cookie was.  Its funny how Oreos have managed to hang on and become such a family favorite despite all the competition of much fancier cookies that are available.  No nugets going on here, chocolate bits, caramel, icing, or peanuts either.  Just a tasty chocolate cookie shell with a delicious vanilla filling.  Keeping it simple has been the best policy for Oreo lovers for decades now. These little packages contain Oreos that are a smidgen' smaller than the regular box or bag sized variety.  What the cookie and candy industry refers to as the fun size.  That might explain some of the negative comments as to these Oreos being rather cheap with the filling.  In my opinion the ratio is the same, they are just smaller.<br /><br />This 12 pack is an excellent buy on Amazon.  Buy two of them and you get free shipping and for the majority of us, no sales tax.  A fine buy if you have a lots of Oreo fiends in your home that prefer a measured amount of these great cookies.  Like a lot of other reviewers here I tend to eat less of them when they come in the little packages as such.  Great classic Oreo cookies at a good price.  Highly recommended...

review/text: I love these 6 packs. I have three kids and I can easily make a snack bag for school with 2 each. And the benefit is there is not a bag left behind for mom and dad to graze on from the cookie jar. Great packagign for hiding in spots around house so the snack hungry teens do not eat them all in a day.

review/summary: Excellent sandwich cookie
review/text: Ok, for some of you (NAMELY Mr. A. H. of Detroit, Michigan), anything but a chocolate sandwich cookie, embossed with Nabisco symbols and filled with white creme is a travesty, but Golden Oreos are a worthy addition to the cookie line of Nabisco. These are vanilla cookies, slightly flavored with burnt sugar, filled with the familiar white creme.<br /><br />Unlike classic Oreos, the Golden version have not suffered much from having trans-fats removed. The cookie is still crisp enough and the flavor is the same. By contrast, original Oreos seem a bit softer due to the change in recipe.<br /><br />Another good feature is the fact that Golden Oreos don't leave a dark mess on your teeth. So you can eat one and not check yourself in a hand mirror afterwards if you are being in public. This is a very nice cookie with a cup of tea or coffee and a standard in our house for teatime or dessert.

review/summary: Hard to overdo it, with these prepacked snack packs
review/text: Each pack contains 6 Oreos.  That's a tidy size for someone who wants a little snack but tends to overdo it with a big bag of Oreos!  However, having 48 of these in the house has led all of us to a bit of Oreo gluttony.  You know how easy it is..."Oh, there's only 6, I'll have another pack."  As a result our box of 48 has barely lasted a month for three people.  So, I will probably not get this anymore because it's too tempting!

review/summary: Chocolate Cream Oreo Cookies 101
review/text: This is less of a review of the actual cookies; though I rated them 5 stars.  The real merit of this "review" is to provide  information that may help others avoid the confusion that I experienced when I received my order.<br /><br />I stumbled upon the product page on Amazon for "Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream."  The Amazon product image clearly said "Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream" and I had never seen that product description or package previously.  I had seen regular Chocolate Cream Oreos before and even original Double Stuf Oreos (with the white filling) in local grocery stores but never the Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream.  I put my concern about the potential need to buy new pants aside and I ordered a case of 12 boxes, which is the minimum order.<br /><br />I received the case promptly from Amazon.  When I opened it, I found 12 boxes that simply said, "Chocolate Cream Oreo".  I uploaded a picture of what I received.  I called Amazon and told some nice representative in India that I received the familiar regular stuf Chocolate Cream Oreos that I have seen in stores and not the Double Stuf Chocolate Cream I had been expecting.  He apologized and shipped another case.<br /><br />I received another case today and it was the exact same product that I received a few days previously: "Chocolate Cream Oreo".  Instead of calling Amazon, I decided to call Nabisco (Kraft Foods, Inc.) for clarification.  The number is listed on the package 1800-622-4726.<br /><br />The following is probably the real virtue of this review.  I was told that the package now for the Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream does not say "Double Stuf" anywhere.  As I mentioned, I uploaded an image of the Double Stuf product package that I received.  According to Kraft, the only way to tell is the UPC and package weight.  The package weight for Double Stuf Oreos is 1 pound 1 ounce.  The package weight for regular or normal stuf Oreos is apparently 15.6 oz.  The UPC for Double Stuf Oreos is 04472700.  The UPC for (regular stuf) Chocolate Cream Oreos is 044000025298.  Since the package does not say Double Stuf anymore, I am not even sure what my local grocery carries.  I need to check the package weight and UPC at the grocery store.<br /><br />Therefore before you jump, head-long, into buying 12 boxes of this magical Double Stuf Chocolate Cream, you may want to check what your local grocery store carries.  I really do not see the logic in having 2 different products with the same package, but there you go:  that is apparently the case with Double Stuf Chocolate Cream and regular stuf Chocolate Cream Oreos.  I will also mention that it would be interesting to see a side-by-side comparison of Double Stuf and regular Oreo cookies.  My guess is that the difference is not as significant as you might expect since I initially thought my cookies were regular stuf.

review/summary: not good
review/text: I'm the biggest Oreo cookie eater you'll ever find, so when I discovered they make sandwich cookies I was interested however the taste is significantly different from a regular cookie.  The icing is the same, but the cookie part is soft and mushy like a moonpie.  You can't really dip these in milk because they fall apart.  Not recommended for those who grew up with the dippable kind of Oreo cookies (that being most of us).

review/summary: keeps cookies tasting fresh and crunchy
review/text: These are always going to be more expensive than buying the single big pack - remember when oreos were packed into three plastic tubes in a plastic box.<br /><br />These oreos always come out crunchy with a very pliable filling that can be easily nudged-rolled off if you don't like the filling.  If Nabisco sold individually wrapped cookies, I'd pay the extra money as I usually only want one cookie.<br /><br />I will always choose to buy oreos packaged in as small a serving as possible despite the expense unless I get some kind of vacuum sealer.

review/text: Great item at $16 (on sale).  My problem with supermarket packaging is the problem that the cookies taste great but once you open the package for about a week the cookies gets moist and taste not nearly as delicious as when the bag was open.  So these small packages, I think 6 cookies each is the perfect size.  They will all taste great and crisp.

review/text: My review is for the product cookie itself, not what might happen if you buy food from Amazon. Oreo is a classic cookie, and while I can't say that I am a big fan of all their flavors, I really enjoy three flavors - original, Uh-Oh Oreos, and the top of the list, Mint Oreos. The flavor is strongly reminiscent of the Thin Mint cookies sold by the Girls Scouts. Unfortunately, they only sell their cookies once in a while, but I can head to my store any time I have a craving for the flavor of chocolate and mint in a cookie. I even like this better than original Oreo, and that's saying a lot. Nom nom.

review/summary: Chocolate covered Oreo recipe
review/text: Everyone loves Oreos. They're even better dipped in chocolate. I made a plate of them for my son's Cub Scout cookie auction and a plate of my cookies sold for $20. So yummy.<br /><br />RECIPE<br /><br />2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips<br />2 tablespoons shortening<br />1 package Oreos<br />*optional: 1 cup white chocolate chips and 1 tablespoon shortening<br /><br />**Before you begin, make sure everything is absolutely dry. Even a drop of water will ruin your creation.**<br /><br />Melt the chocolate chips with the shortening in the microwave for 1 minute. Stir until melted. If needed, heat another 10 seconds at a time until melted. Be careful not to burn the chocolate.<br /><br />Place one cookie in the chocolate and coat. Use a fork to scoop it out, tapping against the bowl and scraping the bottom of the fork on the bowl to remove excess chocolate. Place on wax paper and let it set. Store refrigerated.<br /><br />Optional: To make it pretty, melt a cup of white chocolate with a tablespoon of shortening at 70% in the microwave for 1 minute. Dip a fork in the white chocolate and let it drizzle from the fork onto the semi-sweet chocolate covered cookies. If done neatly, your cookies will look beautiful.<br /><br />Hint: I do one batch in semi-sweet chocolate and one batch in white chocolate. Then, I drizzle the cookies with the alternate chocolate. Plate them together for an eye catching presentation.

Oh, how many times have I enjoyed an Oreo milkshake on a hot day, only to smile widely at everyone with a mess of chocolate cookie in my teeth?  *shudders*<br /><br />So, only downside to the Golden Oreos is that I don't think they'd be as good in a milkshake as regular Oreos.  But the pluses are many with the Golden Oreos... a crisp vanilla cookie that is very good all on its own, but sweet biscuits and gravy, the vanilla cookies are paired with a sweet filling.  They are addictive.<br /><br />If you like vanilla sandwich cookies, try the Golden Oreos!

The best way to eat those was to soak them until they were soft in ice cold milk (only could get whole milk back then).  Now there are how many things with the oreo name? TOO many.<br /><br />But this! The Golden Oreo.  Truly wonderful.  Totally different than the original oreo.  But wonderful. It is also BETTER than the current chocolate Oreo.  I wish I could taste-test the original oreo for comparison, but cannot be done...

review/summary: good tea
review/text: This is a nice floral tea.  Sometimes the added vanilla note comes through strongly, other times it seems to be more like an aftertaste.  I enjoy this tea, but probably won't re-order unless it goes on sale at Warehouse Deals again as I don't think it's quite "special" enough to justify the regular price.<br /><br />These tea bags come with a lot of bulky packaging, BTW -- each bag is individually wrapped in a rather large foil pouch and the pyramid-shaped bags look like they are made out of nylon instead of paper (the box claims they are biodegradable, though).  Also the pictured product box is much larger than a normal-sized box of tea bags.

review/text: We first tried these crackers while wine tasting in upstate New York.  The wineries give these to cleanse the palate between tastes and they are terrific!  We brought some home and continue to enjoy them with wine, beer and just for snacking too!  They are healthier than alot of crackers and have a great distinctive flavor.

review/text: We have 4 small dogs and our challenge has always been to find a natural, healthy dog food, made especially for small dogs, that our dogs actually enjoy eating!  They are very particular! Simply said, they love this dog food.  With other brands, we could usually just leave food in the bowl and the dogs seemed to eat only when they absolutely had to for survival.  Now we have to put portions in their bowls because they will eat as much Blue Buffalo as they can... every kernel!  I think they would eat until they explode if we didn't "police" the food bowl!  We've tried every dog food on the grocery store shelves and this is the best.  I know if our dogs had thumbs and type this review, they'd give Blue Buffalo five stars.

review/summary: My pug loves it
review/text: At first I was a little hesitant to buy it because I've heard other dogs won't eat the life source bits, but I was at a local pet store and decided to give it a try. I had looked over the ingredients before so I was familiar with what was in it. I knew that it was a pretty good food and certainly better than most. I decided to give it a try because it wasn't too expensive and it didn't have too much protein. I've tried other really good brands and the ones with too much protein didn't work out. I was surprised the my dog liked it so we stuck with it. To this day he is still eating the same food. He does great on it. No gas. No loose stools. Everything has been great. The size of the kibble works out great for my pug. It's not too big and it's not too small. I also like that it doesn't have corn in it.

review/summary: Good Quality, Reasonable Price
review/text: I didn't rate this food at the maximum only because it is a little more expensive and it is not the highest rated quality.  However, the quality rating is FAR SUPERIOR to the ProPlan he was on and also MUCH higher than the "vet recommended" dog food (and less expensive than the latter).<br /><br />After doing a lot of research on the quality of dog foods, it becomes obvious that what most of us probably buy for our dogs really may not be good for them.  Meat by-products always raise questions, but the real concern for me is the grains frequently used that are indigestible by dogs or that the dogs may be allergic to or may develop such an allergy because of eating them.  A particular concern is wheat gluten (allergy), soy (filler) and corn meal (filler).  Most inexpensive dog foods are primarily made of these.  Aside from being almost worthless from a food value view for a dog, their only "merit" is the artificial nutrients that are mixed in.<br /><br />Once you start looking into dog foods that provide good quality foods (rather than fillers and chemical nutrients), the price usually climbs very quickly.  (That's not to say that many poor quality dog foods aren't also really expensive.)  I picked the Blue Buffalo Small Breed food because my energetic little dog needs a really good food to sustain him.  It is a little more expensive than typical "name" brands, but MUCH LESS expensive than other high quality foods.  If you do the research, you'll find this food highly rated for food content (though not at the very top), but far more reasonable in cost than something like EVO.<br /><br />Does my dog like the food?  Definitely.  He is a picky, slow eater who is often not interested in eating at all.  Since changing to the Blue Buffalo, he has not become a gluton, but now eats readily until he is full (not necessarily everything in the bowl).  It has been easy to mix in this food with the original ProPlan we used and gradually increase the proportion of Blue Buffalo.  But from the first day with only a little Blue Buffalo mixed in, he has shown more interest in eating and has not had any negative reactions.

review/summary: Best Dog Food
review/text: I have a Pug. He really loves this dog food. He is a very picky eater.  I have tried other brands before Blue Buffalo Small Breed. This is the only dog food he seems to like.  Yes, it does cost more, but I do understand the higher costs since the company is using better meat products and does not have all the fillers like other brands. My dog was able to digest this food very well. I started by adding only 25% of the new food to his old food. I did this for 2 weeks. If you have a Pug, I think your little best friend would love it too.  Amazon had the best price I could find.  The online pet stores wanted too much for shipping.  I have Amazon Prime Shipping so it was shipped FREE to me in 2 days! I think I got a great deal. Thank you Amazon!

review/text: I have the pickiest dog when it comes to food. She's a small breed, and from the very beginning we noticed that she wouldn't eat or would just nibble at a lot of the stuff that dogs I've owned in the past have loved (such as beggin' strips, pigs ears, purina one dog food, and milk bones). She absolutely loves this dog food! As a future holistic doctor, I realize the importance of good nutrition, not only for the quality and longevity of life, but also for cancer prevention. This food makes me feel good about the food I'm feeding my dog (and my cat too, I feed her the indoor formula dry cat food) because I can't ignore what I've learned about proper nutrition, but it also doesn't break my bank like EVO does (It may not be as good as EVO but its close).

Now that she's realized it's an everyday staple she'll pick at it throughout the day, which is normal for chihuahua's apparently. This food seems to be good for her. She has an abundence of energy and has put on a healthy amount of weight since I adopted her. She still gets excited when I open the cabnet I keep her food in, she does this cute little dance that reassures me I made the right choice when I switched her to this food. I just wish more flavors were available in small bites.. regardless, I highly recommend Blue!!

review/summary: So good the cats love it too!
review/text: We got our dog from a friend of a friend last year, and when we picked him up he came with a crate, toys, etc.  He also came with a partially eaten bag of food.  I can't quite remember the brand but I want to say it was Lil' Bites or something like that.  I had seen an article about the quality of dog food and I started reading it.  I immediately realized that we were feeding our dog crap.  The main ingredients were biproducts and other nasty stuff.  So I did some research and landed on Blue Buffalo.  The ingredients were what I was looking for an there were no added colors or things like that.<br /><br />I know its funny to rate a dog food on the way your cats react to it, but I think its important.  The cats never bothered with the dog's old food.  They could have cared less.  Now we have to monitor the dog while he eats or the cats will try and team up on him and eat his food!!  The dog seems more happy with this food and seems to be eating a more appropriate portion.  The dogs waste seems better as well which I know is a good sign of the quality of food an animal is eating.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this food for anyone with a small breed, adult dog.  Like the article that I read said... "colors and whatnot are for you, not the dog".  So who cares what color the food is.  Blue Buffalo proves this point. I'm happy that my dog is happy.  Now if I can devise a better system to keep the cats away!

review/text: I have a rather picky chihuahua when it comes to dog food.  She eats the generic brands reluctantly but at least finishes every bite.  With this Blue Buffalo Chicken and Rice meal, she leaves the dark morsels alone.  I once had to leave nothing but the dark morsels for a day for her to eat any and she only did it because she was so hungry.  I like that the ingredients are healthy.  However, it still means half of the bag is wasted with her avoiding the dark morsels whenever she can.  One star deducted for me having wasted about half the bag because my dog is so picky.

She started eating it with no problem, she got used to it immediatley.  She is more regular which helps with house breaking.  A shih tzu is a high maintenance dog and this product is one less thing I have to worry about. I love it because she loves it.  It is a little Pricey but she only eats 1/2 to 3/4 cup per day so a 15 lb bag will last a long time.  I bought a container to keep it in so it won't get stale after it is opened.

review/summary: Wow, my little Pup loves this stuff!
review/text: Our 10 y.o., 10 lb. Poodle mix (rescued from The Humane Society...she got a home and we left another cage open to rescue another dog or cat) has been eating the major manufacturer premium brand "E" food for small dogs.  Then, when she turned 10, I started thinking of her health and how long she would be with us - she's a little girl with a "really  huge" personality and presence...  We want her around as long as possible...<br /><br />So I started reading up on dog food's and nutrition - after awhile I settled on giving Blue a try.  We carefully mixed a little with her old food for a month until she was eating only Blue.  My friend mentioned she was perkier - she's always way over-active but she said "really looking good, bright eyes, etc."<br /><br />Another benefit is she evacuates easier, we realize her food is moving through her while it still has fluids making it easier for her to take care of her business, instead of her having to push so hard, and she goes a little more often also.<br /><br />We find her general health to be AOK, and the nutrients and ingredients are better...  Just 'read the ingredient list' on your dog's food bag!  So now she gets a "super" premium dog food.  Luckily, she's small and isn't a food hog or we'd have to get a part-time job to keep her in deluxe food.  But, don't mistake the comment, we would do whatever needed to keep our pup in good health and here with us for many more years.  She's a part of our family, in fact, she's got a "second Mom & Dad" down the block and we can say she's the only dog on the block who "owns" two homes!  Lucky little dog...  Lucky humans...

review/summary: Pug loves it!
review/text: We have an almost 2 year old female pug. We had tried several dog foods before such as Purina Fit and Trim, Kibbles 'N Bits, and even tried the Royal Canin food specifically for pugs. They all had corn as well as other fillers near the top of the list. She would eat the food of course, cause shes a pug, but most days it would just sit in there and then randomly she would eat it little by little. You could just tell she didn't really enjoy it. We decided to try out some of the Blue Buffalo dog food and wow, she LOVES it. She gets excited when its food time and eats the food immediately. And it also gives us peace of mind that she is getting excellent ingredients that will help her be healthier. Its more expensive than most of the store bought brands, but knowing you are giving your little dog the best food is worth it.  Highly Recommended.

So I added different puppy/dog foods to it.  However, Maltese are noted for their picky taste.<br />One of his favorite combos is "Cheese soup" and BB.<br />Melt some Am or cheddar cheese in microwave with a little water. Mix well while hot, pour over BB, let sit for a while(2 min??).<br />Then pour out "soup"... cheese will coat BB. Or you can let puppy drink "soup", then eat BB.<br />MAKE SURE "SOUP" IS COOLED SUFFICIENTLY.

review/summary: Great dog food
review/text: We have been feeding our beagle/terrier dog this food for several months. She has had no issues digesting it. Her coat is shiny, her health is wonderful. This product has rated well across the board with veterinarians and other dog food sites. The price is a little high, but it is worth it for a healthier dog food.

review/summary: My dogs love this food
review/text: Being a first time Dog Owner, I wanted to make sure that my dog would eat the right food. I had her first on Purina, thinking that it is a good brand/food for her. However, after talking to other dog owners, I started to research the different brands and found the blue buffalo to be one of the better ones out there. My dog didn't eat the purina very well, I always had to mix some can food with the dry stuff. I don't have that problem with the blue buffalo. From day one (mixing it according to the directions 25% new food with 75% 'old' food) she ate all the blue buffalo. Never had to mix any can food with the dry. Her "poop" is never too soft or runny. The only thing I noticed is that she actually eats more then the old brand. She has 1 cup in the morning and 1 cup in the evening. (she is only 23 lb's) But her activity level is very high. She goes for an 1 hr walk with me every morning and does a lot of running around in the yard. As long as the vets thinks she is in great shape, I'm not too concerened yet. I buy it online (15 lb bag for $30) and get free shipping with Amazon. That is $2 per lb ver. a 6 lb bag = $19 a bag ($3 a lb) in a store.<br /><br />UPDATED: March 2012<br />Why is the 15 lb bag not available anymore with AMAZONE? I have been checking it for the past 2 weeks and I can't order it.

review/summary: BEWARE!!  Made my dog Sick!!!
review/text: I am writing this review to warn other dog owners of Blue Buffalo for dogs and what it has done to my 5 yr. old Miniature Dachshund named "Calla". Back in late October 2011 I switched to Blue Buffalo after it was recommended by a family member. By mid-November Calla started to cry out at night. We thought it might be a back issue and our "Three" yes three Vets agreed that it could be Intervertebral Disc Disease. We had blood work done in November and everything looked fine with the exceptions that she was a "little" dehydrated. After months of treatments, with little to no improvement we thought it might be a stomach issue and I started to think about the timing of the change to Blue Buffalo, then I went and goggled "Consumer complaints about Blue Buffalo Pet Foods" and started to really connect the dots. Yesterday she was diagnosed with "Pancreatitis" and needs to be in the hospital for days for treatment. I have spent over 3K to this point and do not know if Calla will ever recover fully from this. She was a completely healthy dog before we changed to Blue Buffalo and since have been living in Hell with nighty episodes. Please read up on this issues people are having with this product before you buy. I wish I could give a product -minus 5 stars!!!!

review/summary: Call it Stinky Dog
review/text: My puppy has eaten three different main dog foods and at least half dozen different treats and this breath NEVER smelled.<br /><br />I transitioned him to Small Breed Puppy Chicken & Oatmeal and after about a week his breath was foul!  My wife won't pick him up any more because of it.  I smell him around his head area and it almost oozes from his pores.  Had his teeth checked and they are fine.<br /><br />I'm dropping the food and looking for something else for small breed puppies.  He also doesn't eat the black bits so that's a waste of money right there.

review/summary: Splinters anyone?
review/text: I have a couple of dogs, one of which, loves to chew on bones. I gave it to my dog as a Christmas treat and it went to town. But later I found little splinters on the floor. It did not register to me at first since it had lost the meat flavoring color and it was pure white. Still being oblivious at the time, I tried to give the same dog another one, seeing how he loved the first one, and he just walked the other way. Then after my dog threw up, the bone splinter riddle was solved.<br />Later, my daughter, who works at a dog adoption organization, told me that I should have never given my dog pork bones... at least not the dried out variety. Perhaps this won't be a problem for your dog but my dog can really chew thru bone... so maybe that was it. In any case, lesson learned for me with my dogs. And perhaps a heads up for you and your dog if you have any concerns.

review/summary: DONT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT
review/text: My dog almost died from this product. The bone splinters and the company knows it. They have a liability statement on their product because I am sure I am not the first dog owner to have gone through the hell that I went through. I bought a smoked bone from the grocery store because I thought it was big looking, met the size required for my dog and I thought since it was American made it was a quality product. It is far less than quality. Would anyone give arsenic to their dog, absolutely not. So don't spend your money on this killer product. After 3,500 dollars in gastronomy surgery, emergency care,I spent a sad and scared Christmas tending to a poor puppy whining and whelping in pain from their defective junk. Please take this review to heart, I want to spare you what I went through.

My 75 lb Dalmatian ate one last night @10pm and today @ 5pm he vomited shards of the bone (which was a lot) and everything else he ate that couldn't pass as a result of these bone fragments blocking the passageway of his intestines.

review/text: A co-worker recommended that we get a knuckle bone after my complaints of our lab puppy wanting to chew on EVERYTHING.  We bought the first one at Petco, Petco brand, and she loved it and eventually broke it in two (prob a month or so after having it), and she was needing a new one.  I decided to go with this one on Amazon and she LOVED it!! She spent an entire hour chewing on this just during the first sitting.  She carries it around the house with her and it is FANTASTIC because she doesn't try to chew the wall anymore (or carpet! augh!!).  Highly recommend. :)  Thanks, Amazon.

review/text: Gave my Dachshund this Hartz "Premium" bone for "aggressive chewers" on Sunday afternoon.  By dinner Monday she was not eating or drinking.  By Tuesday morning (this day) she was throwing up bright red pools of blood!  I had her to the Vet within an hour and $354.32 later learned that this Hartz "Premium" bone for "aggressive chewers" tore up her intestines.  She is now on 3 medications and a special diet for the next week.  The vet advised me to contact Hartz to let them know what happened.  I plan on doing that AND sending a copy of the bill.  I don't expect them to pay it (they'll likely file it in the circular file) but they need see it and hear about it. I purchased these Hartz "Premium" bones for "aggressive chewers" from Walmart so did not have the advantage of the WARNING reviews on Amazon. You do.  Don't do this to your dog.

review/summary: Sharp Splintering
review/text: I purchased this bone at a local supermarket and gave it to my boxer. I walked in the house to literally make a cup of coffee and my dog devoured the bone. What a surprise, when the packaging clearly says: "...this long last chew satisfies your dog's instintive urge to chew." I didn't think anything about it until 2 hours later when after a walk, my dog regurgitated twice! I checked the vomit and sure enough, there was shards of the bone inside. This stuff was so sharp it actually cut my latex glove! BE CAREFUL. If it could cut my glove, it can damage a dog's stomach, colon, intestines and/or esophogus. THIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET AND NOT SOLD! There is a disclaimer on the product packaging, "This is a natural product and may be prone to splintering." Are you kidding me!? I have been monitoring my dog, whom regurgitated two more times since. Still not sure if I need to go to the vet yet. Gave her 1/3 can of pumpkin to coat her stomach and 3-slices of white bread, which I read will gum up and help her pass any shards in her stomach. Why any company would sell such a product is beyond me. This american made item, lacks the quality to sell in america. I am appalled it is even being sold on the shelves. STAY AWAY. Read the other negative reviews. $3500 for stomach surgery and chances of fatalities. Is it worth it to risk the life of a loved family member over a $3.00 bone! Absolutely not. DO NOT PURCHASE, IT IS UNSAFE.

review/summary: My Lab just ate the whole thing!
review/text: OMG, I gave this to my 1 year old, 110 lab and he ran outside with it. I got distracted and when I went to check he had already eaten the entire thing. The only thing I could find were two horrible splinter pieces!! Now I'm at this moment terrified!!! I read the other reviews where some dogs have had to have surgery because of these...I'm hoping and praying my dog will be okay. It's only been a hour since it happened and now all we can do is wait and watch. I've given him some bread and he gets pumkin every night anyway. Plus he had already eaten his dinner so I'm hoping his "full" tummy will help the bone to pass. Needless to say my husband is mad at me for not showing it to him before I handed it out. But we've been going through some major life issues the last couple of weeks and I'm not thinking clearly as it is. I soooo wish I could turn back time and have never given it to him!! Please stay away from this bone and please, if you are reading this and have any good thoughts to help while I wait, I'm open to them as I am worried sick!!! I've already lost my 14 year old lab in Sept and this one we got in Oct and he his my Angel!!! I would die if anything happened to him!!!

review/summary: poor quality compared to other brands
review/text: So I grew up in a townhouse complex with my two best friends being Thai and Indian 1st gen immigrants... I grew up with about a fourth of my food being from their homes--we went to whoever was making the best food. Thai tea was a bit of a guilty obsession for us, especially in the summer. As I got older, the addiction grew, and I've brewed hundreds of gallons of it. That said, I bought this along with the Por Kwan when I couldn't get to my Asian market. The Por Kwan was much better, but neither was especially great; this one is GREEN tea, which Thai tea is NEVER supposed to be. The leaf quality is pretty awful--really dusty, the stems are ground in with the leaves (big no no, clearly cheaply made), and it's DEFINITELY been treated beyond the red dye--which our tea FROM Thailand and Sri Lanka actually didn't need, though admittedly, they weren't garfield orange, more like a pinkish peach, when the milk was added (when it's brewed correctly, GOOD "black" teas will be a lovely red shade; this would likely be a gross putrid yellow-brown without the dye)...<br /><br />Some people probably add enough sugar to compensate for the chemicals in this, but I can't get over it. I could steep it for 1 minute, 3, or 5 or 10 and it would still have a scent and flavor I (admittedly my sense of taste and smell are keen) am repulsed by--just opening the bag, the smell of a cheap plasticware factory's toxic chemicals gently waved in my face like fresh paint. The bag has gone unused as a result... I'm about to toss it, since frankly, I can't trust something I know has had things added to it that make that distinct "not from nature" smell and taste so apparent to me, someone who admittedly mostly buys things like Silk Road prize teas (Drunken Concubine for example) from Angelina's--the only guy I've personally met who knows quite a lot more about tea than me is there, and he used to evaluate them all over China/Asia and gets the very best... Those chemicals, if you care, are probably a mix of intended additives and byproduct. They intentionally tend to add things likely mold/mildew inhibitors since transporting in Asia equals humidity (most of this is from China, shipped to Thailand sometimes or tagged product of Thailand if the company is in Bangkok, regardless of where the tea came from or how many factories were involved in its creation), along with the obvious pesticides in these cheaper teas. Then you have the reason this stuff is so cheap when good tea will typically be--even loose--$1-4 an OUNCE: the manufacturing process. I'm pretty sure this wasn't made in an especially clean plant, and that smell in opening the bag reminded me of places that just don't exist in America, places that remind me of why I DO buy USA goods 99% of the time. The water used to clean, the grinders... none are going to be especially clean by our standards, and much gets recycled, as water is costly in other parts of the world. The short reason I won't finish this or give it to anyone else is that all of that non-tea gets brewed right into the tea and goes into your body. I like my body AND tea too much to settle for less than great. The por kwan brand is much better, but... it's still not the bee's knees. Still, if I had to pick one, it is NOT this one. The other I can say at least most people should be okay with... I'd give IT a 3.5. I give this a 2 for MOST people to be fair since face it, most don't care about the nitpicking I am hyperaware of. Most don't teach medical sciences and work directly with ill patients, either, for a living, so most aren't constantly immersed in healthcare.<br /><br />Whatever you get, I'll at least give this recommendation: we grew up using sweetened condensed milk--it's how they typically do it in Thailand, where fresh cow milk is expensive, very expensive--or sometimes evaporated in a pinch; the condensed really makes the texture best for adding ice; otherwise, it becomes extremely thin, which is a sad reality of many restaurants, which I'm presuming a lot of people base their reviews on; high quality Thai restaurants--and they DO exist(expensive doesn't mean high quality)--the ones Thai folks eat at--won't skimp on this detail, let alone use regular milk. Half and half *can* be a feasible option, but it's just not the same.

review/summary: So happy right now
review/text: Isn't it odd the weight and power that one bad review can have?<br /><br />I LOVE Thai Iced Tea but the nearest place was a thai restaurant I would have to order a meal from in order to get the tea. Even then, the allure of the tea would draw me to order somewhat mediocre food. Suffice it to say, I was looking for a way to make it on my own.<br /><br />I came across this tea (and various other brands) and it was looking promising except that one bad review relating to Green Tea. I second-guessed a potential purchase so much because of that one review.<br /><br />Finally I took the plunge and I couldn't be happier. It tastes exactly like it does from the various sources i've tried it from. Maybe Thai Iced Tea isn't supposed to have green tea, I'm not sure. I don't position myself on internet forums as an expert in tea. I DO know however that if it looks like thai iced tea, it smells like thai iced tea, and it tastes like thai iced tea, then for all intents and purposes it IS thai iced tea. Besides, green tea leaves are probably better for you anyways.<br /><br />Don't let this one negative review turn you off like it almost did to me.<br /><br />Now on to other matters:<br /><br />The quantity the package calls for is really too much. I make the tea in 64 oz. quantities and it only takes 4 tbsp. or so. I boil the water with the tea inside until it reaches a rolling boil, then I allow it to steep for 4-5 minutes. I was using the stainless steel muslin filter another reviewer mentioned, but unfortunately it was getting really groady looking and it was hard to dry as a college student. I've now invested in T-Sac tea filters, size #3.<br /><br />There is some "dustiness" to the tea. When I first started drinking it, I never noticed it until I got to the last 4-5 oz. or so in the pitcher since the dust sinks to the bottom. Now when i transfer the tea to the pitcher I just dont pour the last few oz. into the pitcher which effectively gets rid of any issues with tea dust.<br /><br />I mix the tea with milk and/or coffee creamer (original non-fat works splendidly) though i always use coffee creamer if I have it on hand.<br /><br />There is ONE problem. If you really liked thai iced tea before, there's a chance you're going to get addicted to it. I have a reusable 24 oz. iced drink tumbler and it's easy to fill that up a couple of times a day or more if drank with meals. with 2.5 of these cups you're looking at 64 oz. of thai iced tea a day if you're not careful. With that being said i'd much rather drink 40-50 oz. of thai iced tea than the 30-60 oz. of iced coffee with (regular i.e. with fat) cream, sugar, and caramel flavoring.<br /><br />It's a great alternative to coffee and I couldn't be happier.

review/summary: Just amazing
review/text: I just received this thai tea and it was just amazing!  I had recently gone to a thai restaurant and had the iced thai tea and I wanted to make it at home. I tried this tea and it tasted exactly like the restaurant tea.  They shipped it to me within two days.  The price was very reasonable.  I have no complaints.  I will continue to order this item in the future.

review/text: This is really good tasting tea, but the directions for making are wrong.  It calls for "4 Tablespoons per 1 Cup water."  That should be 1 Tablespoon per 4 Cups of water.

review/summary: PanTai vs. Por Kwan
review/text: I have tasted both the PanTai brand and the Por Kwan brands.  This brand, the PanTai brand in the foil pouch, is milder with less body and richness.  The color brews more orangey while the Por Kwan is darker and can be orangish to the color of fresh brewed coffee. The Por Kwan brand defintely is more full bodied and richer.  It has black thai leaves, panden leaves and lemon grass.  I wrote a great review on it.  The PanTai brand has a slight cinnamony taste to it and is lighter in flavor.  I've grown to really enjoy Thai Tea in general and some restaurants seem to have the darker, more robust flavor kind and others have the lighter milder cinnamony tasting kind. I guess it all depends on what you want for your taste buds.<br /><br />I was in one of my favorite Thai restaurants the other day and I asked the owner to show me the kind of tea that she serves her customers.  She showed me this brand, the exact package that is shown and selling at Amazon.  The tea she serves is this PanTai brand and tasted milder than Por Kwan and less variable in its flavor but it was still good.  So I realize it isn't the way I was making the tea, it is the way the tea just is.  If you just want a cup of thai tea, this seems to do the trick.  But I really like the flavor of the Por Kwan much more because it has a deeper, richer, flavorful taste and even a better aroma than the PanTai.  But I think it is still a good tea and has its place, especially when eating hot spicy thai food, it is a good balance as it complements the food well.  The Por Kwan brand reminds me of those tea specialty drinks at the coffee houses that have some zing to them.

review/summary: Great tea. Exactly like in restaurants.
review/text: This tea tastes like the kind in restaraunts, unless it is made incorrectly. Usually, you are recommended to add cardamon and cloves to it for enchanced flavor. I use 1 cup milk to 2 cups water ratio for making the tea and sweeten it with regular sugar or splenda. Sometimes I'll make it unsweetened and add 2 tblspn sweetened condensed milk to each cup. If you do not know how to make it properly, I suggest looking up the recipe online. There are many great sites out there which will tell you how to do it, do not count on the instructions on the back of the package for a perfect tea.

review/summary: Read ingredients on the bag first
review/text: Online it lists the ingredients as tea and "Yellow FD&C #6", which is a food grade dye.  On the bag I got it was listed as "Yellow FD&C #7" which can be poisonous.  I made a small glass of iced tea and within a short time was nauseous and had pain in my stomach - I felt like I was poisoned and came close to going to the hospital.  Fortunately, after taking a few charcoal supplements  and drinking lots of water it started to feel a bit better.  I looked up #7 and it is for topical testing not ingestion and ingestion can cause a number of severe reactions, fortunately mine wasn't worse.  I don't think other countries have the same regulations on dyes that we do - so be careful when you get the tea to read the bag and see which dye was used.

review/summary: Just like at Thai restaraunts
review/text: No idea why some people are saying this is bad... I guess it doesnt compare to the teas when you're actually in Thailand or something. As for me, this tastes just like the tea from every thai restaraunt i've been to... which is a good thing! No complaints from me , I found what I was looking for. Only giving 4 stars cause I reserve 5 for products which truly blow my mind

review/summary: Best tasting thai ice tea mix
review/text: This is the actual brand/mix that one of my favorite thai restaurants use.  There is a bit of a floral aroma to this tea in comparison with another, less flavorful, brand that I purchased when I couldn't find this one in the asian market.  For those in California, Ranch 99 markets usually stock this brand.  I don't use nearly as much of the tea as is called for, but I've always had good results.  I've made it in the coffee pot with great success (you do need to run it through the tea leaves twice), but it's just as easy to put the tea in a tea ball and steep that way.  I'm sure it's even easier with a proper tea sock, but I don't own one.  And yes, it stains, so you do have to be careful.

review/summary: Off taste and skeptical of what "else" is in it
review/text: After spending significant money on Thai Iced Tea in restaurants, I went on a quest to make it at home.  In this review, I hope to not only review this product but share what I learned in my process to duplicate what I was getting from Thai restaurants.<br /><br />Instead of buying the Pantai Thai Tea Mix (the item this review is tagged to) I bought it at my local chain Asian market for $3.99.  The only ingredients listed were green tea and yellow dye No.6.  I have 2 problems with this: 1. Everything I have read to date uses black tea, not green.  2. That can't be all that's in it as visual inspection shows at least 2 other unidentifiable bits that do NOT look like tea.  I would have thought they were spices commonly found in Thai tea (like all spice or clove, or star anise) however the "bits" do not look, taste or smell like any of those.<br /><br />The actual amount of teas leaves in the mix is pretty low.  There are lots of "woody" bits, as if they ground up a tea plant rather than using just the tea leaves.  That would explain why when I brewed it, it gave off a wood resin like smell and has a woody, astringent after taste.  Which makes me wonder, what kind of tea plant did they use? Was it laden with pesticides?  Sure tasted like it might.  Even after I steeped a cardamom pod in it, added vanilla and orange flower water, the overriding flavor was still woody.<br /><br />[Note: I had the same results from another brand I bought at the Asian market called "Taste Nirvana Tisanes Thai Tea."  It comes in tea bags, needs augmenting with additional spices and also has an "off taste]<br /><br />The only thing this tea mix has going for it, is that the color comes out the same as the restaurants - thanks to the food coloring.  Which leads me to what I want to share from my quest for make it at home Thai tea.<br /><br />- If you want the orange color, its going to have to come from food coloring.  I've tried finding some special "red" tea that hails from Thailand and there is no such thing.  There's other "red" teas in the world, but they don't hail from Thailand.  I'm not doubting there may be something special about black tea leaves grown in Thailand but it certainly doesn't impart the bright orange on its own.<br />- You can choose between presentation or flavor and maybe possibly both.  If you want to "float" the milk on top like the restaurants do, DON'T use condensed milk.  Instead, sweeten the tea so it will be denser that the evaporated milk and the milk will float on top.  (Note: I didn't try half in half).  If you don't care about presentation, you can save a step by using sweetened condensed milk and the unsweetened tea.<br />- Some parts of Thailand use coconut milk.  I tried - it was very tasty. (but not in the gross mix I'm reviewing)<br />- The black tea alone will not give you the flavor you want.  You have to steep with spices too.  The most accurate recipe I have found thus far is this:<br />1 gallon water<br />8 Chinese star anise, ground<br />1 tablespoon orange flowers (I used orange flower water)<br />1 tablespoon powdered vanilla (or steep a piece of vanilla bean cut lengthwise)<br />1 pinch of clove powder<br />1 pinch chopped cinnamon<br />3/4 quart long cut China black tea leaves<br />1 to 2 cups sugar<br />1 quart half & half (I used evaporated milk)<br />red food coloring<br />[go online and Wiki Thai tea and there's a link to the directions]<br /><br />If you want something faster than this recipe.  Here's best alternative I have found that yields great flavor but not the bright orange color.  Bought Yogi brand++ Sweet Thai Delight (tea bags) and steep one bag in 6 oz hot water for 5 minutes.  Add a heaping tablespoon of sugar and stir to dissolve.  Then let cool completely or stick in fridge until cold.  Pour over ice, then top with evaporated milk.  OR, skip the sugar and evaporated milk and add sweetened condensed milk when hot, then cool and pour over milk.  *I add a dash of orange flower water, dash of ground cardamom and real vanilla extract and it really makes this good.<br /><br />I'm going to try making my own pre-mix by grinding in a coffee burr grinder all the spices and bulk tea leaves from the above recipe and storing.  Then I'll just brew it up in the coffee maker and chill overnight.  Wish me luck!<br /><br />++I like the fact the Yogi brand is certified organic, so I know I'm not getting nasty pesticides there.  So all that's left is the other stuff that I control what's in it - I like that option.

review/text: Did you know that FD & C Yellow No. 6 are banned from human consumption in Europe?  In fact, there are at least 6 food colorings are that have been banned in Europe.  Google it!<br /><br />I'm surprised that cheap products like this add harmful ingredients to it.  It would cost the companies less money and be more healthy to Americans if they simply omitted all food coloring from their products.

I brew a gallon at a time and keep it in the fridge until I am ready to add fake sugar, ice, and half and half or condensed milk.  I have read ALL of the reviews and have gotten some helpful hints from many of them.  In my opinion, whether or not you like this depends on what you are used to drinking.  I find it delicious!

review/summary: Thai Iced Tea Traditional Restaurant Style
review/text: Thai Iced Tea Traditional Restaurant Style is wonderful! It tastes just like the Thai Ice Tea I purchase from Thai restaurants and it is very simple to make. Although I prefer the Por Kwan brand of tea, this is a great alternative if Por Kwan is not available. (The difference is that this one is slightly milder, otherwise, you should not be disappointed with this product. I enjoy it very much.)<br /><br />I use a coffee maker with a coffee filter to make enough tea for several servings and then pour it into a glass juice bottle and store in the fridge. (For 10 cups, I'll add 8-10 tablespoons of tea.)<br /><br />To serve, I'll pour into a tall glass with ice, add a little sugar and top with evaporated milk (approximately a jigger or more to suit taste).<br /><br />I highly recommend this brand of Thai Tea if you want authentic restaurant style Thai Ice Tea that you're used to getting at Thai restaurants.

review/text: I was buying this at one of two resturants I have been going to for several years. I do have one favorite place to get it, not all make it well. It was some 130 miles one way. I would get it when I would visit my daughter near Fayetteville NC.  There I would stock up. Since it was so far away I had to freeze it to take home. The take-out price was about $4.00 for about 12oz. Now I make it at home. Yippeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. I do want more.
