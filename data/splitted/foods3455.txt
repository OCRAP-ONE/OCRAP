review/summary: Like Marshmallow Cereal?
review/text: If you like Lucky Charms cereal, this'll float your boat. The freeze-dried ice cream has the same consistency, particularly in terms of crunchiness. The dessert will get stuck throughout your teeth, allowing you to horrify your friends and save some flavor for later.<br /><br />You only get a single ice cream sandwich in a bag, which makes the whole thing seem overpriced and over-packaged.

review/summary: Tasty, unique
review/text: Dehydrated ice cream is a very unique experience, and I love it. I used to get these for Christmas when I was growing up, and now that I can buy it here (and for relatively cheap compared to what they used to cost in local museums and gift shops) I am able to enjoy it more often.<br /><br />The packaging has always been well sealed on the outside, but they are quite fragile so usually the ice cream itself is shattered into quite a few pieces (though not too tiny). The inside wrapper is always torn as other reviews have mentioned, but if you read the back they actually *say* it will have slits in it because of the way it is processed. I'm not exactly sure how that works, but it's not a mistake or something to be worried about.<br /><br />I will continue buying these on Amazon!

review/summary: Pretty cool.
review/text: I saw this on a cooking show so i was pretty curious. I ended up ordering it, the shipping took about 4 days. It tasted pretty good, not amazing, I expected it to be a little better. I probably wont order this again just because it satisfied my curiosity, But if you have never tried this I highly suggest trying it out.

review/summary: A lot of fun
review/text: I bought this after seeing it on this site and was so curious about what it would taste like. So curiosity got the better of me and I bought it. I wasn't disappointed at all. I do believe it's supposed to be in a brick but mine was in pieces by the time I got it, no matter I would have cut it into pieces anyway. I got each of my family members to try a small piece and we all agreed that it really did taste like the ice cream...if ice cream were warm and in a freeze dried form.<br /><br />If you are looking to try something different, and I do mean different..then this is definitely for you. It was great fun to try this and share it with my family, but I think it was a one time buy for me.

review/summary: Product description is not true.
review/text: My son loves these but.... the product description for this says "great price" and that these cost double at the local science centers.  This is very misleading since if it were true then the package would not contain only 1 single .7 oz package which is only two dollars and change at our local science center and the highest you will ever see is three plus dollars.  The price here is DOUBLE the science center price so they have it upside down.  My dad ordered this for my son thinking it was 3-packs probably having misread the "3 year expiration date" plus seeing that they said it was half the price that you pay at the science centers (UNTRUE).<br /><br />This is ONE pack only.  At least the one we received and nothing here says any different.  Buy it at your local center.  And forget making a comment that the review should be about the product and not the price as they put pricing claims in the product description making it part of the product and specifically misleading.

review/summary: Love Wilton, Just Not This Color
review/text: I made a basketball cake for my son and the instructions called for terra cotta icing color.  I was a little confused when I picked this item up, because the label on the dye shows a red color, nothing near "true" terra cotta, but the swatch (as seen left of the dye) shows terra cotta.  I went ahead and purchased this and wasted my time and money.  My icing came out pink and and grew closer to red as I added more dye.  I ended up using orange and various other colors to get my desired terra cotta coloring.

I love the chewiness, I love the seeds and nuts.  The touch of honey is great.  And Lord knows active 11 year olds need all the wholesome energy they can get.  The sugar content is low and the fiber content is high.  It is just hard for me to save them for the boys!!!<br /><br />On a truly aestetic note.  The packaging is nostalgic.  I love that!

review/text: Bumble bars are gluten free, and made with all organic ingredients.  They are mainly formed of sesame and flax seeds,  with a few peanuts as well as brown rice syrup,evaporated cane juice, and a few other items.  The 1.6 ounce bar makes a good sized snack for an adult, and is big enough for two young children to share.  The flavor is of sesame and sweetness that is similar to honey.  The bars are solid and do not crumble, but they do bend and can be snapped in two easily.

review/summary: Rudy Greens Doggy Cuisine ROCKS!!
review/text: We have three "kids," Sturgis-the-Wonder-Peke, Bobette (aka Alien-Love-Child), and Ellie Mae Dobby Diana (our little rescue mix), who seemed pretty much on the fence as to how good their regular dry food was.  Yes, they'd eat it, but no one seemed to be doing the happy dance prior to meal-time.  Well, except for EMDD, who spent her first year being horribly neglected.  She does the happy dance for just about anything now that her life has turned around.  Anyway, the first time I put just a small spoonful of RGDC's Pork, Pasta & Potato over their dry food, our trio made it perfectly clear that this was absolutely the BEST food they've ever had!  Noses buried in their bowls, tails wagging while they ate, and not a drop or morsel left behind!!  Now, I am notified early every morning by Sturgis that it's time to get up and make breakfast.  And in the afternoon, he does the same thing.  EMDD makes us dizzy with her spinning happy dance.  And Bobette simply hops around (which, for her very low-key self is almost as strenuous as kick-boxing).  Meals vanish in record time!  Bravo to RGDC for bringing "delicious" back to dog bowls!!

review/summary: Excellent AND HEALTHY! Better choice than Campbell's
review/text: I was looking for a healthier alternative to my favorite Campbell's soups (Cream of Mushroom and Cream of Chicken). I was THRILLED when I saw Pacific came out with these condensed soups! Yay! I bought them on sale and the price was only .50 more than Campbells. So I gave it a try.<br /><br />They are excellent! And a lot more healthy for you than the competition.<br /><br />Here is my rebuttal to the person who gave this soup only 1 star:<br /><br />I have the box in front of me right now. It DOES list the sodium content. It's 850mg per serving, and there are 3 servings per box. I also have the Campbell's Cream of Chicken nutritional values in front of me. The sodium for Campbell's is 870 mg, which is more than Pacific's. Campbells has about 2.5 servings per can. (See for yourself: http://www.campbellsoup.com/condensed_soups_product_details.aspx?prd_product_id=2326&family=classic )<br /><br />Here's the deal. Not only are you helping the environment by choosing Pacific's soups, but the list of ingredients are way more healthy for you. Take a look:<br /><br />Pacific Organic Cream of Chicken, Condensed Soup<br />organic chicken broth<br />organic creme fraiche<br />organic rice starch<br />organic cooked chicken<br />organic rice flour<br />sea salts<br />organic chicken fat<br />organic garlic powder<br />organic onion powder<br /><br />Campbell's Condensed Soup: Cream of Chicken Soup<br />chicken stock<br />water<br />modified food starch<br />wheat flour<br />cream<br />dehydrated chicken<br />soy protein concentrate<br />MSG<br />chicken fat<br />yeast extract<br />flavoring<br />beta carotene (for color)<br />chicken flavor<br />partially hydrogenated soybean and cottonseed oil<br />butter<br /><br />I would tend to disagree.

review/summary: Tastes wonderful
review/text: I recently found this product in my local grocery store and was delighted to find an organic cream of chicken product in the store.  Normally, I don't find cream of chicken and the one brand I have found it in, I wasn't pleased with the flavor.  I have enjoyed several of Pacific Natural Foods products before, so I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />This tastes wonderful!  It's not over the top, but it's not so bland that it was a waste of your money.  I have enjoyed this in many dishes and will continue to purchase it until I someday perfect my own.  Even if you want a little extra seasoning, it's a great base for cream of chicken.<br /><br />What I love, however, about this product is its packaging.  It's not a can, which eliminates some of the various health issues there that have been circulating about the safety of most canned items.  The packaging it comes in is said to be a safe alternative to canned.  Forgive me, but I don't remember the details and am only writing a quick review, since I see there are none and I want this great product to have a great review!  :)<br /><br />Another great thing about the packaging is the ease of opening it.  It is a rip opening, which I stress that if you plan on using all of it at one time (and even if you don't), to open it entirely!  My husband wanted to only open it a little ways to pour it into a dish, but I stressed to him that he would be there awhile trying to get it all out if he didn't.  When you do open it, it just pops right out if you turn it upside down and squeeze.  With cans, I always had to scrap it out, but not with this packaging.  It has always fallen out for me and is a time saver for me!  (On occasion, however, I have had trouble with ripping it open without scissors, but a quick snip with scissors will fix that.)<br /><br />Not much more I can say about it that isn't in the description.  Glad to see its here on Amazon and I think you should try it!  Pacific Natural Foods, so far, has not let me down on taste and neither has this product.  Hope you enjoy it as much as we have in our dishes!  :)

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: The taste and quality of this soup is far superior to the stuff in the famous red can and white can but without all the unpronouncable ingredients. We originally bought this because it was the only cream of chicken soup without soy. Not only am I allergic to soy but it is so unhealthy it should be avoided by everyone if at all possible. One thing to be aware of is that this is a 12 ounce box whereas the name brand cans are only 8 ounces so when comparing prices remember that these are 50% larger than the other guys and you'll need to adjust your receipes accordingly.

review/summary: Food with actual food in it = huzzah!
review/text: Being that my family are picky eaters and can taste a molecule of preservatives a mile away, this is an amazing find. The first time I used a cream soup of Campbell variety in a recipe, the resulting muck went straight from taste-test to the trash. Not wanting to use that again, I did a web search and found PNF's Organic Cream of Chicken Soup. I picked some up at a grocery store and used it in a chicken pot pie recipe. My family has been raving about it ever since and keeps asking when I'll be making it again.<br /><br />I agree with some of the other reviews that it might be a tad bland, but for recipes that is great. It adds a lovely, delicate creaminess without overpowering any added seasonings. What flavor it adds is pure chicken, no chemicals, and no resulting stomach ache and bloating from being poisoned with soy protein (I could rant about soy, but I'll just suggest this book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0967089751">The Whole Soy Story: The Dark Side of America's Favorite Health Food</a>). My sister in particular is very sensitive to anything other than the most basic foods, so finding interesting recipes that she can actually enjoy is sometimes difficult; having this product makes it so much easier!<br /><br />It seems to me that the negative reviews stem from people using this strictly as a soup. I personally dislike creamed soups (I like a good broth) so I haven't tried it that way, but as a recipe ingredient it is superb. As to those who say it is too salty, I would point out that it is labeled as Condensed soup.

review/summary: Great Gluten Free Soup as a Cooking Base
review/text: When I found that I could no longer eat gluten, a number of crock-pot meals were off the menu because (to my knowledge), every Campbells soup has gluten (yes, even the tomato soup has wheat).<br /><br />A number of months later we found and tried these.  They are a great drop-in replacement for Campbells, and in fact they taste significantly better (a quick review of the ingredient list shows why).<br /><br />I would never eat these plain, but then again I would have never eaten then Campbells cream-of soups plain either; they are just too plain.  But these are a perfect replacement and a great sauce-base.

review/summary: This is disgusting! It's baby food, quite likely the boiled scraps left from making broth.
review/text: I bought this because of the soups I've had by Pacific, most are great... the broths are bleh, too weak and watery, but the tomato ones and *the new veggie lentil and roasted red pepper mmm* are souper-duper.<br /><br />First, the texture... a mix of rice flour thickened broth and creme fraiche and milk, it had separated so one section was clear goopy broth and the other was the creamy-ish part (more starchy than creamy, like potatoes--in this case rice flour--blended with some broth and skim milk, nothing like Campbell's, not condensed enough to work for recipes that need a thick base). I got it when it was a brand new product line by them (new enough to get $1 off coupons, the REAL reason I tried them since they were barely over a dollar after the discount).<br /><br />The smell I agree with the 1-star review is really off putting... and it matches the taste PERFECTLY.<br /><br />What the taste IS? BABY FOOD. JUST LIKE BABY FOOD.<br /><br />When I got the lentil one with the coupon, I only got one... then went back and got the rest, along with a few of these (I haven't braved the mushroom yet). I wish I'd only gotten one. A dollar and change or not, NO WAY am I keeping them. I wouldn't even donate them. I added ground pepper... nope, baby food plus pepper. Sea salt made a bite of it almost edible--yknow, thick salty broth--and adding a touch of herbs just ruined the herbs.<br /><br />The reason it can't be salvaged? Their chicken is repulsive. I'm almost sure they boiled the bird, and that is only acceptable for broth where the bird gets removed. In fact, I have a hunch--especially given the whole thing possessed ONE tiny flaky pea sized square of meat--they got "responsible" and took the bird etc used for the broth--the broth strained out and packaged--and just blended that boiled limp weird-odor meat and such and tossed in some rice flour and dairy to try passing it for soup.<br /><br />Ever made your own broth, the kind where you boil it til the bird is almost Michael Jackson white because you aren't going to use it as part of the dish and want to yank all its flavor out? You know how funky boiled, denatured bird smells and tastes? This is that bird. Now I have finally figured out why baby food is so repulsive, a mystery I was content to never even ponder. I hate that I am dumping the remaining 90% of this out, but I'll be tasting it coming back up if I don't (4 tiny spoonfuls and it already has me belchy and nauseous!). Healthy shouldn't have to taste like wartime rations, not in this day and age.

review/summary: Love it!  Great for cooking!
review/text: I absolutely love this product.  I developed a dairy allergy in my early adulthood and am an avid cook.  I use this cream all the time!  One reason I really like this is that it isn't pre-sweetened, so it works well in cooking where other dairy free creams don't.  I've made pasta sauces, cream soups, french toast and lots of other things. (I'm sure the flavored varieties would be great with french toast!)  I haven't tried the other varieties yet, but I'm excited to try the whipped cream.  If you're trying to cook for someone with a dairy allergy - this product is a must-have in the pantry.

review/summary: Disgusting
review/text: This vegan "cream" is akin to spoiled cow's milk. There should be a negative star option.<br /><br />Failing to read the directions, I opened it right away and a watery substance and pretty big white chunks poured out. Ok, user error. My husband shook it for literally 10 minutes and I had high hopes that this was the cure. Negative. The same watery mess poured out but now the chunks were teeny-tiny, like chunky spoiled milk put through a blender.<br /><br />In no way can this be considered an acceptable alternative to dairy cream. Maybe I received a box from a bad batch (the expiration date was no where near the end), but I will not be trying this so-called substitute for dairy cream again. I'd rather shove needles in my eyes.

review/summary: An unfortunate pairing
review/text: Is it possible that culinary great Wolfgang Puck would lend his name to such a mediocre food product? If you buy this sauce, you'll find your answer and that answer is yes. I highly doubt that Wolfgang Puck actually tasted this sauce before he signed the contract to attach his name and likeness to this insipid product but with the other Wolfgang Puck food products I've tried lately I'm starting to see a trend. If you're going to buy this sauce anyway, just go to the local market and buy one jar to try it out.

review/text: I buy this vodka sauce when my store is out of the much more flavorful Bertolli Vodka Sauce. Wolfgang Puck's version of creamy vodka sauce is a more bland-tasting sauce that doesn't add much kick to pasta dishes. I find myself having to add my own touch (seasoning) to it. In a bind, this vodka sauce will do; I'm just a little curious as to why this sauce doesn't have any punch. It more or less tastes like spaghetti sauce. Is it really a creamy spaghetti sauce? Not to mention the price is higher than a lot of sauces out there. Avoid this sauce if you can.

review/text: I had one of these this morning and was pleasantly surprised. Specs were something like 30g protein, 32g carbs, 6g fat. The consistency is a little finer/mushier than typical instant oatmeal would be, but that's to be expected with the addition of the protein. The overall taste was good though with a mild sweetness and no bitterness or aftertaste.<br /><br />I wouldn't want to eat it every morning, but for those lazy mornings, it's a quick way to get some warm protein before heading out the door. I'll try the vanilla tomorrow. Can't see myself eating cocoa flavored oatmeal though, so I'll pass on that one.

I find that they also cure my chocolate craving and are good enough for me to consider them my mid afternoon treat. With three children I often do not have time to eat. I would highly recommend them to any person who needs to eat on the run. I have them on auto ship as with a 9 month old, I cannot always get to a store that carries them.  The price is very competitive if ordering from Amazon. Believe me, I have checked.

review/summary: Lavazza Espresso Pods
review/text: These Pods are great.  They provide excellent tasting espresso without the grinding process which saves a lot of time.  The only downside is each pod only provides 1oz of espresso.  So if you're going to make two double shots of espresso that's 4 pods you would have to change in and out which makes a lot work.  Overall great for just yourself but if making more than a shot or two for yourself, you'd be better off going with beans or grounds.

review/summary: Good flavor but loose pack does not work in my machine
review/text: I'm not a gourmet, just someone who looks forward to her morning latte. I typically make a 12-oz latte with a single shot.  I like saving money by making my own lattes, but don't want to take the time or deal with the mess of grinding beans, so I prefer pods. I recently bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F49XXG">De'Longhi EC155 15 BAR Pump Espresso and Cappuccino Maker</a>, and was inspired to expand my horizons beyond Starbucks espresso pods, so I tried a few different brands. I liked the flavor of this coffee, finding it to be smoother and less bitter than Starbucks. At the price they were a good value. However, I found it difficult to get a good pull from my machine with these pods; the pack seemed too loose. Dipping them in water and tamping did help. These are E.S.E espresso pods, made for espresso machines with E.S.E pod adapters. They are not for Senseo or K-cups machines.

review/text: I have been shopping on Amazon for a long time but never thought to search for "espresso pods" but I am so glad that I did.  This pod is awesome!  It is smooth and creamy and tastes sooooo good.  In fact, I just ran out of them and went to Starbucks for my morning latte and it just tastes like cr@p.  I was buying Starbucks pods for about 10 years and using them in my old Barista machine but their espresso is super bitter and often tastes like the bottom of an ashtray but finding another pod until now was and seemed almost impossible.  This purchase has just confirmed what I already suspected... Starbucks is just more American cr@p that they are trying to pass off as I don't know what.<br /><br />This pod is like that love you have been searching for all your life and suddenly you meet and realize that the last 10 years could have been so much better.  Then you get angry for dating all those other idiots.  Oh wait.... this is a product review.  Anyway great espresso pods!

review/summary: Not a great flavor but cleaner than ground coffee
review/text: I would rather spend the time and effort for a better flavor. The Pods are individually sealed, and easy to use. The flavor is not great at all.

review/text: Much cleaner to use little pots instead of messy ground coffee. Loved the taste of the coffee. It gives decent crema. Will buy again!

review/summary: Convenient, could be a little smoother
review/text: I'm not a huge coffee aficionado so this is my layman's perspective.  This was my first experience with ESE pods and I found them to be very convenient, with a slight improvement to the ground canister espresso.  Although I prefer the smoothness of the Illy ESE pods that I subsequently purchased, these Lavazza pods are individually wrapped which although maybe not the most ecological solution do preserve the freshness of the coffee.  I felt the price was fair for the quality and the conveneince.

review/summary: Good idea, poor execution
review/text: Just got my coffee, I will use it as an emergency supply, when my every day coffee (from local roaster) runs out.<br />I tasted it this morning, very disappointed. I taste like cardboard/old/vented coffee... I expected much better from Lavazza.<br />Maybe the lot I got is a old one... Who know, won't buy it again.

review/summary: Don't Buy These
review/text: This product is terrible.  I tried these pods repeatedly in my new espresso machine and ended up with something that looked like weak tea.  Amazon was kind enough to refund my money when I complained.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SDO5YQ">Lavazza Gran Crema Espresso,  Single Dose Pods  (Pack of 150)</a>

review/summary: Good espresso, good price but wrong packaging
review/text: I'm sure sure about buying from others or Amazon direct but I bought from Terry's Market seller.  The 20 pack came loose in a bag, not in a box as stated.  Not really a big deal, but it is nice to have a box on the counter instead of 20 loose packs.  Basically they buy bulk and repackage.  It has no impact on the espresso but thought this might help others.

review/summary: The product is good, but don't count upon Amazon "Prime" making a two day delivery.
review/text: I find this expresso to be as good as any of the other top ESE pods but at a lower price.  It has a good, not overly strong taste, but enough to leave a slight tingle on the tongus.  Nice creama as well.  Amazon offered "prime" two day delivery on this item but did not come through.

review/summary: Doesn't Work With All Machines
review/text: I was excited when I saw these as I don't like the mess associated with making an espresso.  However they do not work with my De'Longhi machine.  As another reviewer stated, I ended up with "tan water".  If I open the pods and pour the grounds into my machine they make a decent cup of espresso, but the idea was to avoid the mess.
