review/summary: One of my favorite teas of all time
review/text: In the last few years I've developed a love for pumpkin.  This tea is absolutely delicious.  Not bitter like some teas but full of flavor.  My favorite is to make my own rendition of a pumpkin tea latte.  Heat the tea and water in the microwave and let the tea steep for several minutes for full flavor.  It's optional, but when I brew, I like to add just a touch of chai tea flavoring (I use the Torani syrup).  Once ready, I add a sweetener packet and top it off with a little milk.  It's a skinny version of what would be an expensive and fattening tea latte from a coffee shop.  A morning treat.  I offered my sister some of my pumpkin tea, and now she drinks it every morning, too.

review/summary: My Favorite Tea!
review/text: I don't drink caffine, and I don't generally favor Bigalow. I was introduced to this tea at a Christmas Tree Stand. It is my alltime favorite tea. Something about the smokey background flavor. Not too spicy or strong ( I like strong, but not too strong). Just really good! It is now usually my first cup in the morning. I can't find it anywhere but Amazon.

review/text: I LOVE this tea.  I actually drink it without sugar!  It is not super sweet, but the flavor is such that if you want to be healthier, or don't need the added calories, that it is great without anything added!!  A great contemplative tea and winter companion that you don't want to be without!! :)  PS I did a taste test with all of the other pumpkin teas on the market as a comparison and REALLY did not care for them. I ended up throwing them out because I could not bring myself to drink them! :p

It was a better price (for multiple boxes) on Amazon, than it was from Bigelow. Not available in any stores around me, for some reason. I do wish they had a decaffeinated version, though.

review/text: I've been drinking this tea, seasonally, for awhile now and it is my absolute favorite, either sweetened or non-sweetened, with milk or without. What makes this tea stand out from others is that it is actually pumpkin flavored. I tried the Stash Pumpkin Spice tea when my local store ran out of the Bigelow and it was basically cinnamon tea, not at all what I was looking for. If you want cinnamon tea there are lots of teas out there that will give you that flavor. For those like me, who<br />detest cinnamon, this one is perfect. Delicious!

review/text: I bought this tea (as well as the apple cider variety) as favor gifts for an autumn tea party bridal shower. I wasn't sure if I would like it myself as I can never seem to get home brewed chai tea to taste like coffee/tea house chai. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this tea can stand alone without the milk, and although it is similar to chai, it has it's own unique flavor. I have tried it both with and without milk and enjoyed it thoroughly each time. Although this won't replace my favorite black teas, I found it a very welcome addition to my cabinet as a flavorful treat.

review/summary: pumpkin or gingerbread?
review/text: This tea reminds me more of gingerbread than pumpkin pie -- as others have noted, this is pretty much just a chai variant with the spices you'd put in in pumpkin pie.  Nonetheless, it's quite tasty and I'll buy it again.  I've also tried the Stash pumpkin flavor, which is quite similar to this.  However, I think the Bigelow wins -- the Stash always seems a bit weak to me no matter how long I brew it, perhaps because it's a decaf.

Bought two boxes of this tea and have tried it both hot and over ice... I think the flavors and smell are too overwhelmingly strong.  Perhaps sugar and/or milk would make it more pleasing to your palette, but I just plan to offload the rest my boxes!

review/text: I was introduced to this tea at a local restaurant and went absolutely crazy about it. Its unique flavor and healthifying blend of green and black teas and yerba mate, along with a light touch of ginger, is a wonderful thirst quencher.  As a tonic for health and energy, I now find myself drinking it daily instead of my usual afternoon coffee. It perks up the body and brain without the jittery effects of caffeine. I find I get a delightful pick-me-up later in the day--when I need it--without the negative affects of keeping me up at night.  While a tad expensive, I will continue to buy SPORtea and enjoy its delicious brew.  It is now a part of my every day routine.

review/text: This is a great vegetable stock. Sometimes I enjoy a spoonful right out of the tub!  It has a rich yet balanced flavor without the artificial sweetness found in may canned and boxed stocks.  It is a 20 times reduction of a classic vegetable stock made from carrot, onion and celery stocks, wine, tomato paste, lemon juice, garlic and onion powders and seasonings.<br /><br />Although I am a devout carnivore I have often cooked for vegetarians.  In doing so I have found that this stock reduction will replace a meat based glace or demi-glace in a sauce, (however, they also make a Roasted Vegetable demi-glace which contains a food starch which will thicken a sauce better than this one and has a stronger flavor) and it can be used as a base for soups and stews.  I often add a little of More Than Gourmet's Mushroom Stock for a more complex taste.  I use this so often that I buy it in the 16 oz. tubs.  They keep well in the fridge once opened.  A great product to have on hand.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO61AE">More Than Gourmet Veggie-glace Gold� Roasted Vegetable Demi-glace, 16-Ounce Units (Pack of 2)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO61C2">More Than Gourmet Essence De Champignon Gold� Mushroom Essence, 1.5-Ounce Units (Pack of 6)</a>

review/text: These chips pack a lot of flavor. It's just not a flavor I'm entirely crazy about. They have a bit of a sour taste for me--not rancid sour, more like sour creamish. I like sour cream but this is a little more concentrated than that. I have to say though they definetly satisfied a craving. I feel better about eating these than Doritos which I stopped eating years ago and dearly miss. The bag is pretty small though. It's like two man servings or like 5 girly servings (if you actually restrain yourself to the serving size).<br /><br />I also tried the Green Chile kind and liked those better. Those were almost a little addicting. I didn't notice anything harmful in the ingredient list (such as MSG) but if you do please let me know.

review/text: Far better than the aggressively mundane flavor of the Peanut Butter and Banana `monkey bar', these Strawberry Vanilla bars at least have a pleasant and refreshing flavor.  The lightness of the flavor is delicate but I will admit that it isn't anything special.  I am still left a little iffy on these bars.  The frosted coating on the underbelly is nice and sweet, and the nuttiness of the bar itself has more depth than a standard health bar, that can come off tasting like cardboard, but I still want something more.  I don't know, maybe my expectations are unrealistically high, but when you call yourself a Monkey Bar and have that playful critter on the cover of your box you'd think that maybe you could have a little bit more fun with your flavors.

Since every grocery store doesn't stock this wonderful tea you will have to order it and stock your kitchen/office/cabin/whatever with it and enjoy.

review/summary: Tea that Soothes the Soul
review/text: This tea has the most fragrant, soothing flavor...when it is fresh.  But BEWARE, as the label warns, it has a short shelf life and must be stored in a glass jar in the freezer or refrigerator.<br />Make the mistake of not heeding this warning and your tea will spoil very quickly.

review/summary: Great-tasting Cinnamom flavored tea!
review/text: My husband and I were vacationing in Alaska, and on one of our tours, our tour guide took us to a nursery where different types of Alaskan plants and flowers were growing.  The couple who owned the nursery had snacks and hot tea for all of us.  We tried the hot tea (MarketSpice Tea), and it was absolutely wonderful!  This tea is from Seattle, Washington, and is very popular there.  We are from Syracuse, NY, and have not found any tea like this here. This tea doesn't have any preservatives, and has an absolutely amazing cinnamon flavor!  You can get this tea either regular or decaf.  We are hooked!  We are so happy that we can get it through Amazon.com.

review/text: The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it. The last few boxes I bought, however, were awful. I would boil the water and steep it and the tea would make this oily film over the top. It would just float and wasn't tasty to drink. I know sometimes plants have oils in them but this was excessive and killed the flavor. Not buying this brand again.

review/text: This rosehip tea is surprisingly good, reminds me slightly of rhubarb with a subtle regular black tea undertone. The package did take 9 days to arrive & it was all crushed up inside the jiffy-bag so it's a good job it wasn't ordered as a gift. I also think the price is a bit steep for teabags. I just couldn't find this flavor in supermarkets, so I had to get it online.

review/text: I have been having problems with my bladder. Interstital Cystitis is a chronic condition and also effects the colon. I suffer from severe constipation (IBS) also.  I take fiber during the day and make sure I get enough in my diet. In the morning I drink a cup of Alvita Senna tea and within 1 to 1/2 hrs. I have elimination. This is the only thing that has worked for me. I have tried many other laxatives which do not work and bother my bladder. This product does not. I have also drank it at night with good results in the morning. Doctors have said not to use this continually because you could develop dependence. However, my condition is unbearable without it. At last my doctor agreeded that if I was going to take something daily then he suggested this tea.  I highly recommend it for people with my condition or for individuals who take a lot of medications that tend to slow down the system. I have placed an order for more and will continue to use this great product. By the way, I had purchased another brand before I bought this brand and it was of terrible quality. What a difference. This product has great quality and also I like the tea bags being natural and not bleached with chemicals.

review/summary: useless - I feel no effects whatsoever
review/text: I'm not a tea drinker, so I'll start with that right off the bat.  However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.  One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.  Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything.  Sorry.

review/text: I drank this tea at least 4 days a week during the last 6 weeks of my pregnancy.  I wish I did it the entire last trimester and everyday!  I had a 6 hour natural labor and delivery and I only pushed for 15 minutes.  My contractions, even at their most intense, only felt like strong menstrual cramps.  I brewed my tea double strength and then drank it with lemonade.  Delicious and refreshing!  Even on it's own as a hot tea, it's pretty palatable.  My last trimester was in the summer though, so I always drank it iced.  I also used Evening Primrose Oil suppositories for the last 5 weeks. I really believe that these two factors are the main reason why my labor and delivery was so fast and EASY!

review/text: Thought this tea would have been more bitter, but it is surprisingly pleasant to drink without sweeteners!  Less bitter than a black or earl grey tea.  The pack of 3 is a wonderful deal as well.  Had to get creative with storing so much tea in my cupboard, but for the amount you get, the price cannot be beat. Highly recomended!

review/summary: Suggested by Dr. Oz
review/text: This tea was suggested by Dr. Oz on his show about how to sleep better. I suffer from insomnia<br />so I bought the wheat germ, Chia seeds and Valerian tea he said would help. Haven't used the wheat germ yet, the Chia seeds we are absolutely loving, especially on top of a crisp salad, but the Valerian tea tastes so horrible I can't even force myself to sip it while holding my nose! It has a real earthy, almost "manure" like taste. The woman he had try it on the show sipped it and said "Oh, that's not bad!" So I took a chance. I swear, they must have paid her to give it a tasty review. It's vile and I already threw all three boxes of it in the trash!

review/text: I did a little bit more research online before taking this tea...One time I bought Senna tea out of the blue, just for the heck of it...and decided to drink it one night and the next day I was exploding downstairs.<br /><br />So I decided not to do the same with this one. This tea should be taken carefully. It is used as an immune system booster. I think drinking it four times a week is good enough.<br /><br />I really enjoy the warming up effect it has. Although it is suggested to drink with a meal.

I thought I could drink anything but this is the worst thing ever i ever tasted! Like few others say, it also stinks up your place. I dont know what to do with the whole 4 box, i wasnt even able to drink up the one single cup!
