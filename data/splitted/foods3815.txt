review/summary: Delicious
review/text: These sesame snacks are delicious.  I buy them at a local grocery store for [...] per package and saw them as low as [...] for the 24 packs on [...] - but you have to spend at least [...] there or pay [...] for S&H, so Amazon is still king for best price overall.<br /><br />I was surprised to find that people say they are a candy, because they seem so healthy with all the sesame seeds in them.  Great for gluten-intolerant people who want something sweet that is not full artificial ingredients.<br /><br />Great to have around.  Unlike a previous reviewer, I do not find that they stick together in the package - it could be the region you live in with humidity and such.  Highly recommend!

review/summary: Yummy Stuff ~~~~~~~~~
review/text: My wife and I were at a local winter sports outlet and I saw a box of these little treats on the counter. I bought one and liked it but their price was like $1.25 per pack. I figured if I ever found them at a decent price, I'd pick up some more.<br /><br />So a couple of days later I found them on Anazon and bought a whole box for a quarter of the price I had paid at the snowboard shop.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about these little things is that they do NOT last long enough. My fault, I know - but next time I'm buying two boxes - maybe three.<br /><br />They came fresh and crispy/crunchy and stayed that way for a couple of weeks. Ya gotta try some.

review/summary: Great-tasting and very good for you
review/text: I was one of those weird kids that actually always liked the taste of these and wouldn't mind seeing them in my halloween bucket.  Recently I was buying these on occasion in convenience stores as a "for something different" type of snack; the one time I finally looked at the nutrition label, I was surprised to see that these were actually high in fiber and protein as well.  Also, while definitely not low in calories or fat, the fat is from the sesame seeds, so it's good-for-you fat :  And, most importantly, they are still very tasty!  These are great almost any time of the day, and for the price Amazon sells them, about as much as a granola bar per unit but more enjoyable.

review/summary: Awesome "Always on Hand" Healthy Snack
review/text: Sesame seeds are very healthy and nutritious; and of course they taste great.  These little packets each contain four cracker-like pieces of thin, crispy nut brittle made with sesame seeds.  They are sweet and satisfying and take away hunger pangs.  I think they are a great thing to keep on hand at the office for those times when you can't take a lunch break, skipped breakfast, or will be working late.  They seem to hold up forever too.  They are a bit susceptible to humidity (just makes the four thin pieces stick together a bit) but really no problems.<br /><br />These are also easy to carry in your purse etc. and while I won't say they will hold up in a car's glove box indefinitely (at least in a very hot climate), they will hold up for quite a while (like, months).  They are good additions to an emergency food kit too (your earthquake or hurricane pack etc.).<br /><br />I really can't imagine anyone not liking these; they are a very basic but appealing snack.

I also like halvah, another sesame treat so I figured I would like these too, and I was right. I got my shipment earlier this month, and I don't think they'll last until next month. I might have to get some more soon :) I only had a couple of snaps that were cracked in half, but they taste the same cracked or whole. The rest of them were in perfect condition. If you are looking for an unusual treat, give these a try. I have these set for every 6 months on subscribe and save, but I think I may have to get another shipment sooner than that.

review/text: I originally purchased these thinking they would make good healthy snacks for my kids. Not one of the three likes them. However, I am a fan. It helps cut my craving for something sweet as well as something cruncy. Down side: They are pretty calorie-loaded. If you are trying to cut calories or maintain weight, you cannot eat these freely. If self-control is and issue for you, I wouldn't keep them around. One last note -- you have to like the taste of sesame seeds to like these tasty snacks. Sesame seeds are solid throughout, thus the flavor can't be missed. A plus for me, but definitely turned off my kids.

review/summary: Delicious!!
review/text: I purchased a box of these after reading the great reviews. It arrived in less than a week, and I am blown away by how yummy these are. I have to refrain from eating more than one package. It's pretty high in calories and fat (230 calories, 14g fat), considering its small size. But then again, it's mostly healthy unsaturated fats and it does have a lot of healthy fiber (28% daily value fiber in each package!). I read another review that said these used to be made from just 2 ingredients (sesame seeds and honey); now they are made from 3 ingredients (sesame seeds, sugar, and glucose). I wish I could try it with honey, but these are still great. It's a pretty healthy snack when you consider the alternatives at the grocery store, loaded with ingredients that are barely pronounceable. Plus it's nice if you have a sweet craving and don't want fruit or candy. You may need to supplement it with something else as I ate a package and was still quite hungry afterward. Overall, I recommended you give these a try. I am usually a little bit skeptical of purchasing food based off of reviews but these tasted a lot better than I expected. Thumbs up.

review/summary: SO good! And beats out Joyva's Sesame Crunch candies, hands down!
review/text: Ever since I was a child, I've loved this type of sesame candy. I'd been a die-hard Joyva Sesame Crunch candy fan, up until about a month ago, when I found these Louck's Sesame Snaps candies in my local World Market store (for a much higher price than they are here on Amazon). Man, these sesame snaps ROCKED my Sesame Crunch lovin' world! They're thin, and have no problems (from what I've seen so far, anyway) with staying crisp, I'm sure at least partly because of the change in dimensions. Joyva's Sesame Crunch candies are just as delicious, as long as humidity doesn't get to them and make them a super sticky, pieces-stuck-EVERYWHERE-in-your-teeth mess. With these thinner, wider snaps, I don't expect the gumminess issue to be a problem.<br /><br />Yes, these obviously have sugar in them, but being so chock-full of fiber and protein-rich sesame seeds, I really think these are one of the healthiest guilty pleasures to be found in the candy aisle! Go for 'em - they're delicious, and at a GREAT price here, too!

First purchase was good and this was my 2nd purchase, which I ended up throwing it away the 2 boxes I ordered because<br /><br />a) It didn't had any expiration date<br />b) The snap inside the individual packs were breaking up while packet is not even open and there was a white powder coming out and while eating you can feel it is not fresh at all, though I ate only one piece and immediately noticed this.<br /><br />So I called Amazon and as usual Amazon folks are great in customer service and they were happy to refund my money for this product but I am still waiting to get an answer as what caused this expired item to be shipped to customers.<br /><br />I love this product so much that I am waiting to order it again as soon as I get a response from Amazon for this order.<br /><br />Thanks

review/summary: Tart and Fruity
review/text: I read Syndy's review with great interest as she has only tried this tea cold and I have only tried it hot. I'll admit up front that there are few herbal teas that satisfy my palate; I much prefer black and green tea. But I thought this might make a nice morning treat as it's caffeine free and includes Vitamins A, C and E. Unfortunately, I found it too tart and fruity. The primary ingredients are hibiscus and rose hips, both of which are known to impart a cranberry-like flavor. I was hoping the wild blueberry and cinnamon would add balance, but it wasn't enough. In fact I wasn't able to detect the cinnamon at all.<br /><br />I hope I'm not discouraging anyone from sampling this tea for themselves. If you know that tart and fruity pleases you, give this a shot.

review/summary: Excellent Herbal Tea with Antioxident benefits!
review/text: I purchased this Bigelow tea in the grocery store originally and loved the taste.  I bought it because it is caffeine free and has antioxident benefits but the astounding thing is how delicious it is.  I used up one box quickly and went to purchase more but could not find it again in any of my local markets!  Then I thought of trying Amazon and was delighted to find it here and at a lower cost than I had paid in the store!  I bought a 6-pack carton and have been enjoying it daily.  The smell of this tea when opening the box is almost intoxicating!  Such a wonderful aroma and flavor. I have always liked Bigelow's products and this one certainly is one I would recommend to anyone who likes herbal teas.

review/text: This is the second time I have bought this product, and I just love it.. Dark Chocolate, as you know, is a lot better for you then Milk Chocolate, and so around Xmas time I bought my first one. It was a Hit at my house and when you put a candy cane or some mini marshmellows in it, your kids will love it. My grandson usually doesnt like Dark Chocolate, but he sure drink enough of it when it was cold outside. Since most of that box was drank during the winter months, I had to buy another one, JUST in case it got cold during the spring and its nice to have around if people dont like coffee or tea.<br /><br />So I would recommend this to all!!

review/summary: An easy way to stuff a Kong
review/text: My 4 month old goldendoodle really likes this cookie.  You just squeeze the kong to lengthen the opening in order to stuff the fat end in. He eats the smaller end poking out of the outside pretty quickly. He used to give up on the remains inside, but now he tosses it on the ground over and over to break the cookie into pieces.  It's kind of expensive, but it's easier than stuffing smaller pieces of food that just fall out, and gentler on his tummy than straight peanut butter.

review/text: I read all the rave reviews on line and purchased two different types of KONG toys along with the treats.  My dog loves the treats but hates the toys.  She does not like rubber toys.  Crocs sandles, burkenstocks, sticks, rocks, just not rubber intended for dogs.  Even with the treats inside she is still not motivated enough to chew on the toy to receive the reward.  Before you purchase the expensive KONGS find out if your dog will like them.

review/text: I bought these snacks to put in the many Kongs I have for my numerous dogs and none of them liked the snacks as much as they like peanut butter in the Kong.  I don't know if it's because my dogs couldn't actually get the treats out because they tried initially but gave up relatively quickly.  So I wouldn't buy these again and think I'll stick to peanut butter.

review/summary: Bichon Frise Catnip!
review/text: I ordered these on the advice of a friend. Per my friend, her dogs love them. She fills them with peanut butter and then freezes overnight. It takes her dogs several hours to get out the peanut butter. That cannot be said of Bichons. They can work it out in less than an hour. I find that it works better for me to stuff with dog biscuits. It takes longer for them to empty their Kongs.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Size chart accurate - I ordered small for one of my boys. He weighs 12 lbs. It works fine. His small mouth can handle the medium as well. The medium works well for my 16 lb Bichon. The small is not too small. I do not worry about choking.<br />2) Kongs hold up well to hours of chewing<br /><br />Cons: None

review/summary: Bad KONG...bad KONG...
review/text: If KONG were a dog I would rub their nose in this product. I bought this product (locally) to use in the KONG ball (which I bought on Amazon). As soon as I got home I put one in the ball. He went to town. I did love the treat. He did go nuts for the taste. The problem is it made him sick and his vomit stained our new off-white carpet. In the time since we have had the carpet installed he has been sick on the carpet before the KONG incident, and the carpet was never stained. This time it put a spot on the carpet the even the professionals could not get out (the professional carpet cleaner was already scheduled to come to the house and they were there the morning after the dog got sick).<br /><br />The product did not work for our dog, but I know it has worked for my parent's dog. Personally, I did go through two treats before I managed to get one whole treat into the ball. I think if KONG is going to make treat to put into their products (which are designed to be tough and rugged) then the treats should be able to actually go into the product without falling apart.<br /><br />In all don't waste your money. I think there are better treats out there that won't fall apart and won't cost so much.

review/text: I am not a breakfast cereal person.  I remember the days growing up fixated on the box while eating my cereal.  Now my tastes have changed and the sugar filled grains are not alluring to me.  Once in a while, I try a cereal someone says is good for me.  Some are so crunchy (hard) they never fully digest.  Others are so soggy and blah, I get the frying pan out and do the eggs and bacon.  This Special K with blueberries has just enough crunch and just enough taste to keep my attention.  No, it is not from Italy.  Then again I add milk instead of yogurt as many do in Austria (who cares).  Since my morning meal sets my metabolic thermostat, I enjoy a little cereal with an agg and a protein.  I like this cereal and recommend it to friends.

The first bite is gross and then the aftertaste kicks in. There are no blueberries in here like the strawberries in "Red Berries". They seemingly replaced them with some sort of synthesized blueberry chemical that is embedded in the flakes. This cereal is barely edible. I don't know what they were thinking or what humans actually tested this. GROSS.<br /><br />Would give it no stars but I don't think they let you do that.

Korintje Cinnamon is a strong and aromatic cinnamon that comes very close to the Cinnabon's Makara brand.  There are many types of "cinnamon" and they all come from the bark of trees in the same basic family.  The strongest cinnamon you can buy is Vietnamese extra strength but that's more in the red hots flavor range.  if you are looking for a good strong cinnamon to m akes sweet pastires with - this is your best bet.  Pampered Chef uses this type and so do a number of other gorumet sources.  Try it!  At least you won't have 49.99 pounds of Makara cinnamon sitting on your shelf when you are done!

If approved, this product can be given a "silver label" = 12 years old, a "red label" = 25 years old and then there is this current product, a "gold label" 50 to 75 to 100 years old. The consortium places the product in their unique bottle and then, and only then, can the product carry the name "Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale."<br /><br />There is not a simple way to describe the taste other that to say "if you have ever tasted vinegar, it is NOTHING like that." This is a product that used in drops on fine cheese or over perfectly ripe strawberries or just drizzled over a perfectly cooked porterhouse steak.<br />You do not make salad dressing from this product!<br />The Italians categorize this product as a "digestivo" (after dinner drink to aid digestion) or a "condimento", used as I described above.<br /><br />All you have to do is have a nice person put 2 drops on your tongue, then you will understand everything I've written above.

review/summary: Package wasn't received, and both UPS and Amazon said it was the other's problem
review/text: I have given my dogs these dental treats before and they are very popular with them. The package I found on Amazon was a good price for the large quantity ordered. Since now I have paid the money and never received the item, and basically have found no direct route of getting refunded, I am not happy. I will be reluctant to purchase from Amazon again because there was no way for me to get hold of them for a reimbursement. I contacted UPS and they said Amazon likes to handle these things directly. And from looking all through Amazon's website, it says to contact UPS directly. And when I try to put in for a refund, the product not arriving is never an option---and there is no phone number or way to email otherwise. I guess I am out $30 for this purchase. I am disappointed in both Amazon and UPS for their service. I think if the product arrived, I would have likely been happy with it.

When I serve it with cake/pie after dinner, everyone always asks me what kind of coffee it is and where they can get it.  It's smooth, rich and full of flavor.  Grind 1/2 cup of beans and measure your water to reach the 8 on your coffeepot.  It's amazing what a good cup of coffee can do to start your morning off just right.

review/text: I LOVE this tea... I stumbled upon it by accident but the more I buy it the more I like it! Its very yummy tea, not too sweet but just right with the bit of honey in it. It also total has only about 80 calories for the whole bottle (try to find other sweetened teas that do!) and has about 1/2 coffee cup worth of caffeine in it so its not too much.<br /><br />The packaging is funny, and there is always a thoughtful quote hiding on the inside of the label so that when you drink it down you get this interesting thought to ponder.<br /><br />I recommend this to all my friends all the time. Yes the price on here is a bit high but it is organic so what are you going to do? :)  ... PS(I think i bought it cheaper on amazons "fresh" site for those that are local to the Seattle area)

While this isn't the sweetest one out there if you like the taste of tea you will like it.

review/summary: Healthy and Yummy
review/text: I ordered the Lesser Evil Sour Cream Krinkle Sticks after trying a bag of the regular flavor Krinkle Sticks as recommended by the hungry girl website.  The original flavor was great, low-fat and a good potato chip substitute.  Strangely, my three year old adores these and calls them "crunchy french fries."  Amazon has these at a great price versus what my local grocery store charges, so I went ahead and ordered a box of the Sour Cream and Onion flavor.  They're good, but I must admit I think the original flavor is better.  I'm surprised as I'm a flavored chip junkie!  However, the sour cream and onion flavor seems to lack salt and I noticed most of the powder flavoring ends up in the bottom of the bag.  Don't get me wrong, they're good--I just prefer the original flavor.

review/text: EDIT: April 2011<br /><br />Despite my previous statement, these are no longer the best baked low fat snack ever. Not anymore. Sadly, they changed the ingredients. They added rice, took away certain seasonings, and added a DISGUSTING tasting ACID. It tastes like im eating a LEMON. This tastes like a completely different snack - I dont buy it anymore. WHY OH WHY DID THEY CHANGE THE RECIPE. GOD HELP US.<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />These krinkle sticks are the best baked low fat snack EVER. NO QUESTION. They have a great crunch and a HUGE SERVING SIZE!!!! You would have no idea they are so low in fat! They are seasoned to perfection. Sometimes the seasoning can settle to the bottom a bit and the sticks near the bottom are seasoned more (MORE FLAVOR NOM NOM NOM NOM). They are baked, not oily, but still taste awesome.<br /><br />You HAVE to try these. I prefer the regular sea salt flavor.

review/summary: A true carb-craving life saver!
review/text: In my never ending quest for lo-cal yet tasty snacks, I happened on these potato sticks at Fresh Market. The fact that a serving is a whopping 40 sticks for 110 calories and (wait for this) a mere 20 calories of fat intrigued me. I figured the sticks would be mini-sticks....but NO! They're a generous size and, better yet, are crispy and delicious! They're lightly salted with sea salt so you don't feel like you're sacrificing anything! I was quickly addicted. Unfortunately, Fresh Market isn't exactly around the corner, and I could find no other stores in the area that carry them. Amazon to the rescue! The price was better and the speed of delivery is...WOW! They also sell them in individual bags. I highly recommend these snacks for fellow carbaholics!
