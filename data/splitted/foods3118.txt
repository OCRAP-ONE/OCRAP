review/summary: adequacy in the extreme
review/text: I didn't hate the turkey stew, it's not bad - it's the Mitt Romney of stews, not the Dick Nixon but unfortunately, not the Abe Lincoln either.<br /><br />I think the problem is that it doesn't stand comparison with Dinty Moore Beef Stew which I like a lot more - I think the difference is the ingrediments, in Beef Stew, the list includes Beef and they are big chunks of actual beef.  Turkey Stew lists: white turkey (white turkey, modified food starch, salt, water, sugar, MSG, spices),  in other words, turkey spam, which again is adequate to no end.  But I was expecting actual Turkey and also (paraphrasing Woody Allen) the portions are small, the "white turkey" chunks are small and there aren't that many of them.<br /><br />I was going to try the Chicken Stew but after going on the Hormel site, I see that it too has something called "white chicken" on the list - well, I don't get excited by chicken even if it's really actual chicken - they don't even sell chicken spam, do they ?<br /><br />So, I'm disappointed, I won't be buying turkey stew again - unless . . .  maybe if I buy a can of actual turkey and blend it together with the Turkey Stew ??<br /><br />Also, I'd really like to see a Dinty Moore Pork Stew made with real pork, now that would be exciting !  :)

review/summary: A little expensive, but "okay" hot sauce.
review/text: I bought this as a Christmas gift for my hubby, who is a hot sauce fanatic! The item description said that there would be a gift of some sort with the purchase, but it never came. Seller informed me that it was an outdated description and apologized. My husband likes most of the sauces he is sent (one per month), but it's definitely not worth the price, in both of our opinions (one sauce tasted like spicy ketchup).

review/summary: Dogs on the Lamb
review/text: Read the labels of the cheap canned dog foods, and what you see might turn your stomach. Long ago we decided to feed our girls the best of available dog foods to prolong their lives, and keep them healthy and happy. For the most part I don't begrudge them the extra expense entailed. They don't have to eat those scrap heap items like necks, feet, undeveloped eggs, bones, heads, and intestines (and a small amount of feathers in the case of chicken) euphemistically called "animal byproducts." I read ingredient lists carefully so nobody can pull the wool over my eyes.<br /><br />The label on the can of Artemis lamb looks like something found on people food, a pastel yellow background with a graphic of fresh foods like: tomato, lamb chops, carrots, greens, peas, fish and POTATOES. Below the attractive picture is the caption " home cook meal with natural broth." Below that ungrammatical caption and the all caps LAMB are the words "Made in U.S.A.", reassuring words indeed.<br /><br />The can opens easily with its pop off lid. Though the Artemis is made with broth it's not runny or mushy, but firm in the can. Bits of veggies peak out from a food that looks almost good enough to eat and has a pleasant, mild smell. Our three dogs took to the canned lamb immediately and ate it with gusto. Since the canned food is so prohibitively expensive we give each of the girls a tablespoonful of it to add some interest to their plate of dry Artemis. This works out well for everyone because I like them to have mostly dry kibble for dental health and the added ingredients in the dry formula. Using this procedure a 13 oz can lasts us about three days.<br /><br />Artemis products have a 100% guarantee from the company. If the customer or pet is not satisfied, return the product with proof of purchase to the place of purchase for a replacement or refund.<br /><br />We feel confident and not the least bit sheepish about feeding our girls a quality food made by Artemis, a food with wholesome natural ingredients formulated for their needs.<br />A mutt on Artemis is a happy canine.

review/summary: For the Love of Israeli couscous!
review/text: This is the most versatile product that I've ever used. You can eat it by itself, mix it with vegetables, meat, herbs and/or, put it in soups or sauces. Israeli couscous tastes delicious, is not expensive, a little of it goes a long way and, it's easy to prepare. Israeli couscous is much different than the fine & grainy couscous that most people think of, and are used to, in reference to couscous. The pieces are much larger & heartier so they hold up under various cooking preparations. Israeli couscous has a mild flavor which makes it capable of adopting any flavor profile that you may desire---just like pasta (because it IS pasta) or rice. It is an awesome addition to any meal. Try Israeli Couscous---you'll be glad you did!

review/summary: I'm no fan of concentrated juice drinks, but in Ribena's case, I make an exception!
review/text: Ribena is one of those childhood staples that I MUST have. I miss the little juice packs that you can get in the UK as well as the carbonated variety that comes in cans, but you really can't beat the old-skool bottled concentrate. If you've never tried Ribena, well.... you should. It's made from real blackcurrant juice, you won't find any revolting artificial sweeteners or high fructose corn syrup in it, and although it's definitely a calorie-laden sugary treat, it is SO much better-tasting than any 'diet' drink you can get. It's really refreshing and thirst-quenching full of blackcurranty delicousness. A little goes a long way because it's so concentrated, so a bottle can last a long time if you're a little sparing with the stuff. It's not just for kids, either - you can make all manner of respectable grown-up beverages with Ribena. Just try splashing a little bit into a glass of cider (or into a glass of part-cider, part-lager for a "Snakebite and Black"... mandatory drink of every discerning goth type), add a generous slosh to a vodka & tonic... even a little dash in some sparkling mineral water makes for a wonderfully different and refreshing drink. It will add a bright, fruity flavor to all kinds of things, AND it's full of vitamin C so you can even feel all virtuous while you drink it.<br /><br />To sum up in one word: YUM.

review/summary: Plastic Bottles and Less Concentrated
review/text: This 33.8 once bottle is the larger of the two sizes offered by Ribena.  The bottles are made of plastic, so they won't break in transport and four of them are packed into a bag.  However, unlike the traditional glass ones I had, the black currant in these plastic bottles don't seem as concentrated as past Ribena black currant.  Maybe Ribena has changed the concentration level because these bottles require a lot more currant-to-water ratio to be sweet, so I've had to pour more currant for the same amount of water to get the complete taste of a Ribena drink.  I have to say that I love Ribena's black currant and I miss it.  The price has gone up in Chinese supermarkets for Ribena (used to be $4-$6 per bottle, now $9-$14 per bottle), and I found Amazon offers better pricing if you subscribe to the frequent purchase deal.

review/summary: Sprouted well, but container too light
review/text: It did as it was advertised; in under a week I had a nice little container full of grass. Two of my cats loved it, the third was not interested, but that is normal for her.  The only complaint I have is that the container is too light.  When one of the cats would try to chew off a stem, the container would lift off the ground, making it really hard for them to break the stem off.  I ended up having to hold it for them, which means I can't just leave it out for them to nibble as they please.<br /><br />A note for kitten owners:  My 5 month old kitten had trouble eating this, I think his teeth aren't spaced quite right yet to be able chew the stems off.  I ended up tearing little pieces off and popping them in his mouth, which he was perfectly ok with, the lazy bugger.  So if you're buying for kittens, you may want to hold off until they're grown.

They are perfectly acceptable for the rest of us too, the taste is just like regular chocolate, no difference.  I am sorry a previous reviewer has such a severe milk allergy that he cannot use these b/c milk is used in the facility, on other dedicated-free equipment, but molecules can cause real trouble.  My granddaughter has dairy, egg, and peanut allergies, and she is fine with these.  I would not use it if they processed peanuts or eggs in that facility though, dedicated or not.  She is supposedly on a scale of 3 (dairy and eggs) and 4 (peanuts) on the richter scale of allergies (4 being the worst), so we are not cavalier about this at all.  Only you know best as the previous reviewer the best course of action. For us, these cause no issues at all.

I ended up having to give all the bags to my parents while I endured the 1-3 month healing process. VERY upset that companies are still allowed to flaunt allergen-free advertising when they KNOW they have small amounts inside. Some day, I'll take my revenge on these stupid companies that make allergen-free products in facilities that use those allergens. This product NEEDS to have more accurate warnings in the description, since it says it right on the bag.

So, his options for chocolate are limited.<br /><br />For chocolate chip cookies, we used to chop up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NY6Q0G">85% Lindt</a> bars (70% Lindt bars contain soy lecithin), to make our own "chocolate chips."  It wasn't very good, though, because chocolate chips don't taste as good when they're so dark.<br /><br />Then, one of my grocery stores started to carry the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GZ7SP8">Enjoy Life Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips</a>.  They were good...but we were so excited to discover these chunks!  They are absolutely PERFECT for chocolate chip cookies.  (The mini ones are ok too, but they tend to blend in with the cookies too much, so you don't taste them as much when you eat the cookies.)<br /><br />I was kind of skeptical--would these still taste as good as other chocolate chips?? My husband and I agree that they do!  To us, they taste just the same as regular chocolate chips.  My husband loves to snack on the chocolate chunks straight from the bag, so we go through a lot of these--about a bag of these about every week.<br /><br />I recommend these to anyone who can't have (or doesn't want to have) soy lecithin.  My husband definitely doesn't react to these chocolate chunks--and he's had enough of them that we would know.  These chocolate chunks taste so normal that you could totally share treats with people who don't have allergies, and nobody would notice a difference.<br /><br />This is one of our favorite products.

review/summary: Outstanding Chocolate Taste
review/text: I bought these with the intention of avoiding superfluous ingredients that did not add to the base chocolate taste. Best case I was looking for a somewhat sweet pure dark chocolate taste. That I got. Each time I eat some I continue to get the pure chocolate taste thrown in my face (OK, in my mouth). These continue to amaze each time I eat some - a very satisfying result without the add-on unhealthy ingredients.

review/summary: Essential household chemical
review/text: I started adding citric acid to my dishwasher before every cycle last year after phosphorous-free dishwasher detergents became ubiquitous.  I then discovered that it has a lot of other uses around the house:<br /><br />- Preserves fruit and vegetable color:  Apples, pears, banana, potato, avocado, or any other fruit can be kept fresh looking with a light sprinkle of citric acid to prevent oxidation and browning.  Sprinkle like salt and then toss lightly.  Use sparingly.  Correct flavor with some sugar if you overuse.<br /><br />- Dishwasher additive:  Put half detergent and half citric acid in the sealed compartment of the dispenser.  This will make your silverware and glassware shine, even in hard water.  You won't need a rinse aid, either.  Do not clean teflon cookware or fine crystal like this.<br /><br />- Glassware cleaner: Mineral spots and tea stains dissolve rapidly.  Make a mild solution in a dishpan (1 Tbsp per 2 gallons) and soak for 2 or 3 minutes, wipe inside and out with a sponge dampened in the solution, and then rinse.<br /><br />- Window and shower door cleaner:  A stronger solution - 2 Tbsp per gallon of water - will remove hard water stains from windows and glass doors.  Rinse well and keep out of eyes.  Sensitive skin should be protected.  This solution should also remove hard water spots from chrome and nickel fixturing, but I haven't tried it.  Yet.  (Test on an inconspicuous surface first.)<br /><br />- Fruit and vegetable rinse: The same strength solution in cold water makes an excellent rinse for vegetables and fruit that may have been exposed to bacteria or mold.  It won't "unrot" produce, but it will make produce that has been exposed to rotted stock safer to eat.  I use this as a bath for potatoes and root vegetables before scrubbing so that I can keep the skins on...<br /><br />- Coffeemaker cleaning: removes mineral residue without leaving a vinegary taste in the coffee.  Run a medium solution thru a brew cycle: 1 Tbsp per pot of tepid water.  Follow with a pot of fresh water to rinse.<br /><br />- Rust remover: A strong solution (1/4 cup per gallon of water) and a stiff brush will remove rust from cast iron, etc.  Rinse the iron item with a mild baking soda solution and then with fresh water.  Towel dry and then heat the item gently to evaporate any remaining water, then coat with soy oil (cookware) or light machine oil (tools, etc).  If the item is cast iron cookware, proceed with seasoning.  Wear gloves, rinse tools well, and dilute the unused mixture before discarding.<br /><br />- Aquarium pH balance:  I haven't tried this, but I suspect this is the same chemical in the "pH Down" solution that I pay a small fortune for in the pet store.  Tap water in my neighborhood is very alkaline, almost 7.8 pH, and most fish prefer water closer to 7.0.  If you try this, titrate and measure carefully and let me know how your mollies and corie cats tolerate it.  :)<br /><br />This chemical is more useful around the house as Baking Soda.  More people should know about it, and maybe then it wouldn't be so hard to find.

review/summary: Extremely Satisfied!!  Beautiful Product, Delivered Fast.
review/text: I ordered this rose/asiatic lily bouquet early on a Tues morning, and it arrived at her doorstep by 3PM the next day!  I had no hard-and-fast date that they had to arrive, so I chose the cheapest shipping ($12.99, and no free option, but hey, they're flowers--you want it done right).  It was well worth the shipping cost.  MUCH faster than the estimated delivery date w/o having to pay to expedite.  Falcon Farms apparently used FedEx standard next-day.  Thanks!  The tracking feature was also very accurate with FedEx.  I knew exactly where it was at every key point, which enabled me to alert her to its early arrival to within about an 2-hour window.<br /><br />The flowers delivered exactly as they were pictured and described (actually with more roses & lilies than promised and a classy tissue and bow selection to tie-up the bouquet).  Roses were healthy, deep red, and full; delicate lilies arrived as buds, as they said they would.  Even the eucalyptus and "bear grass" (What do I know about botany? I'm just a regular guy.) turned out to be great accents.  My personalized message was also there, just as I wrote it during the order process.<br /><br />I wanted a bouquet to send (just because) to the woman I just started seeing recently--something really nice, but in a slightly understated way that wasn't too fussy or frilly or with a million things going on.  I also wanted something that could be seen as romantic, but not clich&eacute; or over-the-top. ...Tough to strike that balance, and guys know, in a new relationship, you want to modulate these early gestures just right.  This bouquet was perfect (and I scoured many different sites, including FTD and 1-800-Flowers, in addition to Amazon's selection).  Also would be great for a Valentine's Day bouquet.  They are versatile enough to work for a V-Day bouquet for a mother or sister, too.  I buy a lot of other durable goods, but I was initially unsure of how well buying flowers through Amazon would go.  However, this seller is apparently also the grower, and doesn't outsource; I think that makes a huge difference in the consistency of product and process one could expect.  Falcon Farms has found a loyal buyer in me!

review/summary: Only negative is the pulp
review/text: I've tried several of the Alo Coco drinks.  I really only have two complaints.  The first is obviously the pulp.  I have to strain the pulp in order to be able to drink it.  That's a personal preference, though.  I can't drink orange juice with pulp, either.<br /><br />The other negative isn't really a negative but needs to be mentioned nonetheless.  All of the Alo Coco drinks taste about the same to me.  That's not necessarily a bad thing.  I love the coconut flavor, and I love the fact that I can simply shop for whichever is the least expensive.<br /><br />The biggest positive, though, is the hydration quality of the drink.  It is high in potassium, an electrolyte, and I have found that I only need to drink about half of the water as normal while excercising when I have a half bottle of Alo Coco before and the other half after.  It's a great alternative to Gatorade, and for that reason alone, I will continue to purchase Alo Coco.

review/text: First of all- if you're not a fan of high pulp juices, you may not care for this product. In fact, my own first taste was 'off-putting'..  The tapioca-like pulp was not expected. Aloe vera has pulp? Who knew.. ?<br />  But once I realized the lumps were not unpleasant (and supposed to be there) and the coconut water and fruit juice combos tasted really good- I was hooked.<br />  I see another reviewer found the salt content overwhelming.. I haven't tried the peach flavor but neither of the two flavors I have tried taste salty at all. (And the labels list sodium as a 2%.)<br />  I think this is a really fine product. Certainly worth a try..

review/summary: undrinkable in my humble opinion
review/text: I am by no means a coffee snob and I can usually handle coffee of lower quality but when I brewed a cup of this Hazelnut community coffee I had a lot of trouble drinking it. The aroma is almost predominantly hazelnut and the smell of coffee is a distant second. Visually the ground is extremely uneven with random chunks here and there. Now for the taste, as soon as I had my first mouthful the first thought in my mind was "vegetables". There is a strong green vegetable flavor to it that I find extremely unpleasant. A friend of mine found that mixing this coffee with another companies dark roast coffee before brewing helped alleviate this problem. I will not be purchasing from this company again especially with so many other great coffee choices out there.

review/text: I found these to be quite delightfully fluffier than the consistency of a regular peep. I'm talking about the viscocity of the internal fluff here.  The covering granules seem to be finer than that garnished upon regular peeps.  This combination results in a lighter (weight, not calorie) snack that has a smooth finish of chocolate mousse.  The individual cats are joined to each other at the side of the head and at a point between 1/3 and 1/4 from the bottom.  The head of the snack is most fragile at the neck area, which will sometimes cause there to be a break at this point when trying to separate the cats.

review/summary: Tart and Yummy Healthy Snack
review/text: *****<br />These apple chips are tart, very crispy, and yummy! They don't have the processed or chemically taste that some dried apples have. They also are not soggy at all--I like my apple chips very crispy! They are 100% certified organic, baked with no added sugar, no preservatives or chemicals, no pesticides or herbicides, gluten free, and made from Washington State apples with five apples in every bag. There are 6 servings in every 2.6 ounce bag, with 29 calories in each serving. These are a truly healthy and delicious snack.<br /><br />These particular chips are only just barely sweet, mostly tart. If you want sweet apple chips, you can buy Fuji apple chips from the same company that are just as crisp and good. I like to mix both together for a sweet-tart combo.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/text: I like these.<br />They are low calorie snacks and also good for you.<br />Taste just like dried granny smith apples.<br />Not a bad price for getting a dozen bags.<br />They have a long shelf life as well.<br />No added sugar, just the apples.<br /><br />But I do prefer the fuji apples, they are sweeter in comparison.<br />Granny smith are more sour.

review/summary: Sour as heck, not dried completely
review/text: Well, green apples are sour, I should have known better.  The chips themselves are not nearly dried enough, some are mush, some dried, some mush in the center.  Very bizarre shapes and size chips.  As if they used the peels from a pie factory to make these (feels like a bag of scraps, to be honest).<br /><br />Simply, avoid!

review/summary: Sour Apple Lover doesn't love this.
review/text: I'm a huge sour apple lover. I choose them over other popular flavor/fruit every time. I ordered and received the product today.<br /><br />I opened one of the bags and ate my first chip. First impression, it tasted truly bitter. Perhaps I'll get used to it so I ate half of the bag despite the strong bitter taste. I got slightly sick with stomach aches with terrible aftertaste in my mouth. I immediately took a Jolly Rancher Sour Apple candy to overwrite the aftertaste.<br /><br />I'm sad, I so want to like this snack but it's far too bitter which caused me to be physically sick. I'm still giving some stars just because they decided against adding any chemical or artificial flavors and extra bonus for being gluten-free.

review/summary: Sour Bitter Chips
review/text: Wow, I'm a big fan of sour things but these chips might be the worst!  They are very stiff and thick, not nice and thin like a normal apple chip.  They are very firm and not chip-like.  They are more like a super dried fruit leather.  In addition, they have zero sugar or flavoring or anything and the granny smith apple flavor is intense and overpowering.  They are so sweet and bitter I can not make it through a few of these before my mouth is too puckered to continue.

review/summary: Great on Popcorn & Veggies, Chicken
review/text: If you like the Lucas Limon salts on your fruit, with your beers and lime, or on veggies (and I know a lot of the kids like to just eat the salt by itself!) then you'll like this healthier salt-free version that is similar in flavor, the Mrs. Dash Fiesta Lime seasoning. I personally love this on corn on the cob and popcorn. I'm into air popped popcorn with seasoning, and the Mrs. Dash blends are perfect for seasoning popcorn. For me, this fiesta lime one is one of the best ones for popcorn.<br /><br />It's a tangy blend, more citrus than 'fiesta'. If you're very sensitive to 'heat' levels, this does have a bit of a kick, but for those who like a little heat, it's really not spicy hot. It's much more limey-citrusy flavorful than it is hot. You only need a little bit. It can be overpowering with the lime/citrus flavor is you use too much, and it's a fine powder, so it's easy to use too much if you're not careful. The good news is, the product lasts a long time, because it takes so little and is so flavorful for a small amount.<br /><br />I really, really love it on chicken. This spice can completely transform a plain skinless chicken breast and give it a nice zesty kick of flavor with just a touch of good quality olive oil. If you're wanting healthier alternatives but don't want to skimp on flavor, I really do recommend this fiesta lime blend.<br /><br />And you absolutely must try it on popcorn if you like popcorn like I do. I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure, and I had to cut salt out of my diet completely, and it's tough, 'cause I love salty foods. Mrs. Dash's blends have saved me, because I can still have savory and 'salty' type foods, without losing flavor. It would have been hard to give up salt without Mrs. Dash, and now, I find I like all these flavors so much more than I liked the salt. The Fiesta Lime is really probably my favorite one of the Mrs. Dash products of mine (chipotle southwest is my real favorite, but it has sugar in it, so I can't have it... the fiesta lime is a good second though!)

review/summary: Decent, but not great
review/text: When I first started to use IAMS Savory Sauce, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get a little drizzle in their kibble every once in a while, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced, and low calorie. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a "gravy" like texture and aroma that most dogs love. Not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues, but a great free solution for picky eaters.

review/text: I'm not a big fruit eater unless its fresh picked and in season.  I also will not buy anyt type of fruit that has added sugar.  I tried these and fell in love with them.  They are tasty and retain the sweet tartness of a fresh mango.  True, they do not have the texture of dried apricots or apples but this is thier natural texture and they are not treated with sulfur or other additives/preservatives.  I keep several bags of these and the dried cherries on hand for snacking.  I have quite a sweet tooth and these help keep me from reaching for other processed treats.  And I'm getting some of my daily fruit and vegies....

review/text: Doesn't look like much but pretty tasty. I'm quite addicted. I love how there is no added sugar, especially since mangoes are naturally very sweet. I got 2 orders in 2 weeks.

review/summary: How many calories are in the bag?  How hard is that?
review/text: 1 bag = 204 calories<br /><br />The easy way to find out how many calories there are in what you are eating is to know how many calories are in the entire bag, box, can, etc. since people rarely eat "one serving".  And the number of servings and the number of calories per servings is always included in the nutritional information on the container.  However I have noticed on Amazon that this is not the case.  When the nutritional information is shown it's "ONE" serving, in this case 18 grams.  How unhelpful is that?  They make it a process to find out how many calories are in this bag of mangoes, for example.  They tell you how many calories are in 18 grams; I personally think it's an attempt at deception or misleading if you want to be kind by the vendor.  In any case, there are 204 calories in one bag.  one ounce = 28.349 grams; 2.2 ounces per bag X 28.349 = 62.368 grams; 62.368 grams/18 = 3.465 servings per bag.  3.465 X 59 calories per 18 grams = 204.428 calories.  I'm going to ask Amazon to ask the vendors that when they say they are including the information on the product in the description that they provide all of it and part of this is the number of servings contained.  I believe that the vendors are required by law to provide the number of servings on the container but I'm not sure about online.  This is conveniently left out; plus, who the heck deals with servings in grams?  When is the last time you measured out a serving in grams?  Americans use ounces.

review/text: This product is good and healthy, but WAY more calories than I need to eat (as I'm on a 1200 calorie a day diet right now).

review/summary: dried mango
review/text: This product is of great quality. There was nothing wrong with this product, except I didnt realize that I would not feel like eating 12 bags of mangos right away. Use for a business to re-sell maybe? or share with a friend..
