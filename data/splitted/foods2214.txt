review/text: These cookies are AMAZING and the texture is excellent considering that they're totally vegan. I got turned on to these cookies before I became veg and IMO the pumpkin and lemon cookies are the best. Not a fan of the "chocolate chip", unfortunately, but I had no problem, texture-wise, with the lemon and pumpkin flavors at all.

Considering that they are grain free and made in the USA the price is certainly reasonable. I'd say you get about 20 per bag.

review/summary: Tastes good, salt is WAY too coarse to stick to popcorn.
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LLXBCO">Gourmet Popcorn Seasoning Assortment</a>I got some popcorn and seasoning salt in the same package by/from Wisconsinmade.  The popcorn popped up quite nicely in my hot air popper.<br /><br />The seasoning salt was was much too coarse to stick to the popcorn--even when I used vegetable oil spray.  I bought a mortar and pestle to re-grind the salt down to a fine grain like the size of butter-flavored popcorn salt from the grocery store. When I get the mortar-pestle, I will grind the salt down to the size it should have been in the first place.<br /><br />It is an inexpensive product and not worth the hassle to send it back.  The popcorn seasoning salt likely the worst designed/made product I ever bought from Amazon.com.<br /><br />Admittedly, I have only tried one flavor so far.  The grain size was so far off the mark, I have no problems writing this less-than-positive review.  Man has been grinding salt for at least 5000 years, it is not that complicated to differentiate between rock salt, table salt and a finely ground powder.

review/summary: Thank you for carrying this product, but...
review/text: I was going to visit a friend in a foreign country where fruity tea is a rarity, and since she specifically requested this particular brand and flavor, I started the search in my neighborhood grocery stores. From the very high end to the mom and pop shop, I couldn't find this particular flavor, that's when I turned to Amazon.<br /><br />Fortunately, it is available through a seller store but I was shocked to find that the shipping and handling cost almost as much as the price of the product. In other words, for the price for 3 boxes of tea, you only get 2. But since this is the only place I can find it, I paid the price. My only consolation is that my friend's happiness is priceless.<br /><br />To give the seller the benefit of the doubt, I think the effort was to keep the fragile paper box intact as it arrives. But my friend didn't care for the box, she even suggested that I "discard the box and put the tea bags in a ziplock bag" for easier fit in the suitcase.<br /><br />If I may suggest that the store offer different types of packaging options, such as the highest priced and most sturdy package, or less sturdy (a plastic wrap to prevent the product gets wet in the process of shipping, in a large bubble envelop, for example) but more reasonable price, it would be great.

review/text: Torani Salted Caramel Syrup is so delicious. I first got to try it thanks to She Speaks. It was sent to me and and I was very skeptical. We were not sure how it would taste. I first put it in hot chocolate and all I can say is wow! We all really liked the flavor and well it went with hot chocolate and a little cool whip on top. Our next creation was choclate smoothies. Again it was another hit. The flavor is rich, but not overpowering. I now have bought it and it has replaced my want for coffee shop drinks. We really enjoyed it and will keep buying it for our occasional treats.

review/text: First of all, one of the reviews was not aware of the type of product this ACTUALLY is.  This is a FLAVORING type of syrup, as with all Torani Syrups...they are additives for other items...hot drinks, recipes, etc.  They are not made to be eaten as a typical type of "pancake" type of syrup.  Clearning this issue up for everyone, since the bad review person wasn't aware of what he/she was purchasing, this is AN EXCELLENT flavor.  I add to coffee, tea, and hot drinks and it adds so much flavor to everything.  This flavor is one of the newest in the Torani line and is absolutely marvelous!  It's sweet, caramel, and with a hint of a salty flavor which makes it an excellent "ADDITIVE" type of syrup (as it was designed to be!).

review/summary: Kids LOVED it added to Hot Milk!
review/text: I ordered this product to give it a try. I added about 8 teaspoons of the supplement to 4 cups of goat's milk on the stove top, heated to around 105 degrees. (It mixed well around 95 degrees- for a cold drink, I might tend to mix a small amount of liquid with the mix into a paste and then add the rest of the liquid- you know how difficult cocoa is to mix sometimes.)<br /><br />Poured the hot beverage into cups for my 3 boys, and they said "it is great! How often can we have this as a treat?"<br /><br />Now, we love Stevita flavored supplements for our cold milk- some favorites are Toffee, Vanilla, and Chocolate. My oldest makes concoctions with all 3 flavors in his cold milk drinks. I just purchased the Mango, and it is super in my hot tea.

You do have to put a little liquid in the cup, mix it really well and then add the rest of your liquid.  This is a great substitue for chocolate milk and hot chocolate without all the sugar and artifical junk in it. We mix it with rice or hemp milk since they don't drink milk.  It really doesn't take as much as the package says- we use about 1/4 tsp. for 8 oz. and they are happy with that so a little container goes a long way.

review/summary: awful..pass on this one
review/text: Based on the other reviews I purchased this product. I have been using stevia for over 15 years, so I know the ins and outs of using it pretty well, and I love it.<br />I currently mix droche cocoa powder with stevia powder for a hot chocolate drink and it definitely has a super dark chocolate flavor which i like.<br />So when I saw this product I thought I'd try it...what a complete disappointment. It tasted horrible. It's taste reminded me of what fresh potting soil smells like, and it left gritt in my mouth...so unless i happened to get a bad batch of this and they cut it with soil, don't buy this. Hopefully, me wasting my money saves you from wasting yours. Make your own with cocoa powder.<br />Also this is what the usage directions on the lable read exactly...  "Suggested Use: Blend 2 1 sp in Oz liquid".  Did ya get that?<br />I went by serving size which was 2 tsp.<br /><br />I did order the strawberry and orange mixes also, but haven't received them yet.<br />Hopefully these are better.

review/text: I didn't know what to expect but bought some and put in w/my almond milk (no sweetener) w/fruit and protein powder, added some extra stevia because I like it sweeter and it's great!! Stevia sweetener is the best and only sweetener I will use, other than agave nectar. From the research I've done, it's the only one that is not harmful in any way and wish the FDA would get off their rears and allow companies to add stevia to food. It's alot healthier than sugar in "any" form and alot better than all of those truly chemical artificial sweeteners.

review/summary: Great Sugar Free Chocolate substitute.
review/text: If you are diabetic like me, and allergic to aspartame ( which I am ), you will miss things like chocolate milk.. This product came to the rescue! I found that just a small amount is needed to make a 12 ounce glass of milk, or a bowl of fat free greek yogurt ( way less than you might think, Stevia is VERY sweet compared to sugar. I found the trick for me, is to put about a 4th of a teaspoon of Stevita in little bit of hot tap water, and mix it well, creating a sort of syrup. Then when you add your milk, it doesn't leave little lumps of Stevita floating on the top of your chocolate milk ( kind of like what happens with Ovaltine, which I also used to love ) I found that if I over do adding it to the milk it is too sweet, and doesn't taste as good as when you use just a little. Of course "Your Milage May Vary(tm)"<br />Personally, I am just happy to be able to have a glass of chocolate milk again. I hope that more companies give us a stevia option instead of the usual sugar, high fructose corn syrup, and aspertame. I will be buying this product again ( but the beauty of it, is you don't need a lot, so the jar lasts a looong time :-)

review/text: I love flavored stevia, and this is one of my favorites!  Also, Stevita is an awesome brand.  I buy their product line regularly and am very pleased.<br /><br />This product tastes very good to me with a medium degree chocolate flavor.  I mix it with my protein shakes to turn a vanilla into chocolate, or make a chocolate more chocolaty (I'm a chocolate lover).  What I love about this product is that it is tasty, low in calories (13 calories for two teaspoons I believe), and sweetened with all natural stevia. I make it a point to never consume anything with harmful, poisonous chemicals such as sucralose or aspartame, so the fact that this is sweetened with stevia is extremely important.<br /><br />The container does not come with a spoon or scooper, so be certain you have a measuring teaspoon to use with it if you are counting calories and need to be exact.  Inside the container, it looks and feels similar to cocoa.<br /><br />Taste is personal and particular, but I do so enjoy this and recommend it.  I hope you like it too!

Don't over do or you'll end up with that Stevia aftertaste.

review/text: It seems you either love or hate this stuff, and I fall into the former group. A warning about my preferences, though... I don't care for cocoa that's heavy on the chocolate flavor. Dark chocolate tastes bitter to me. When I was still drinking Quik, I would cut the serving size in half.<br /><br />I use a Back to Basics Cocoa-Latte machine to make cocoa. I've never tried this stuff in cold milk. It's not too sweet, but like all stevia products, you have to be careful about how much you add. If you put in too much, it has a strong aftertaste. Each person's threshold is different, so you may need to tweak the serving size.<br /><br />The only drawback I can think of is it seems to precipitate out of liquid fairly quickly, so if you don't keep stirring or drink it fast you'll end up with sludge in the bottom of your cup.

review/summary: OK, but could be chocolatier
review/text: This didn't have a lot of chocolate taste for the recommended serving size.  Or the right amount of sweetener.  I had to add a spoonful of Hershey's unsweetened cocoa powder and a few more drops of stevia to get my desired taste.  I could have just started with that and left out the fancy product.....

review/summary: Tastes Terrible
review/text: I realize that when it comes to taste, To each his own, but I have to agree with the reviewers who say this tastes terrible. When you mix this with just plain water or milk, it tastes nothing like any chocolate or chocolate drink I've ever had. I've had pure Mexican chocolate in drinks. Perhaps it is good for mixed drinks--Cafe Mochas, flavored coffees... This doesn't beat any chocolate mix that's in the US market. I'm going back to Qwik.

review/summary: So Sweet and Healthy
review/text: I have been a bit of a health nut lately.  I have given up most sugars, but I still love sweets.  I mean, I LOVE sweets.  It's hard for me not to give into the temptation of sweetening everything I eat.  I like Splenda and Sweet 'N' Low too, and I know those are good for you.  It was on a recent trip to the grocery store that I found this.  I have heard of corn syrup, but didn't really know what it was.  I didn't realize it was so sweet!  I certainly didn't realize that something so sweet could be made from a vegetable!  Now, I am realizing that so many of the things I love are made with this vegetarian syrup!  This corn syrup is the best, it tastes so good and if you use it five times a day you don't have to worry about getting the right amount of vegetables (remember it is made from corn!).  I have chosen this "light" version of the syrup because I am so into my health lately, it doesn't taste too much different from the regular.  I also like the vanilla flavor they have added.  You can't make it too sweet for my sweet tooth!  You are just going to love it if you haven't tried it before!

review/summary: Best I found so far
review/text: I chew A LOT of gum because when I work out or hike, it keeps my mouth from going dry.  Even when I knew Aspartame wasn't good for me, I didn't care too much as long as the gum worked. Then I had my first kid turn 1 yr and she noticed me chewing gum and wanted some.  She also found some that I left low enough for her to get into and we found her chewing away.  That's when I decided no more Aspartame crap for my family.  So the hunt began and I went to natural sugar gum (but didn't like the sugar aspect) and then discovered xylitol products, and finally this gum.  I love it!  Yes, the drawback is that this gum doesn't last as long as the Aspartame gums, but the trade off is that it's actually good for you.  Go google Xylitol and see the benefits.  So now I actually give my daughter this gum after meals and usually whenever she wants because it's that good (I consider it like if she wanted to eat vegetables all the time, I would let her).  I've been buying Xyloburst gum for at least a year now.  Great flavor, great for your teeth, and you can relax knowing that it's SAFE for your family.  I've tried this flavor, fruit, and peppermint, and they all rock!  Enjoy!

review/text: Due to chronic dry mouth from medication, my dentist and doctor recommend I take 5-7 grams of xylitol in gum or candy form throughout each day. I've been trying lots of varieties of brands and flavors and Xyloburst has been the best to me by far. I also like the fact that they label their packaging as to how many grams or milligrams each piece has in its ingredients. The flavor in Xyloburst seems to last a bit longer than most others... and it's fresh. Am looking forward to trying more of what Xyloburst has to offer in candy and gum.

review/text: One gram of xylitol per piece of gum! That's the reason I bought this gum. My dentist recommended xylitol products because they can prevent cavities. I first looked into Trident, but that only has a pittance of xylitol compared to this. This has ~5x as much as Trident. The taste is also great, much better than many other gums. It's like munching into a sprig of mint. That being said, the taste does not last long.<br /><br />If you're looking for a gum that is good for you teeth and tastes great, give this a try.

Personally I love its strong distinctive flavor, regardless of what percentage pure vanilla extract it is.  For those who feel it's too strong, use half the amount listed in the recipe.  I know a couple of people who do this when using Molina Vanilla.  Again, I like the flavor, so I use the full amount called for in the recipe.  This stuff has a great flavor that really kicks things up a notch.

review/summary: Delicious and potent!  (Do not use in making home made icrecream - vanillin is a natural agent that increases freezing temp)
review/text: I did not purchase this item on amazon, but have purchased several bottles at a local Mexican food market.  It's flavor is phenomenal.  I add vanilla to a lot more than calls for it and have used many different brands of vanilla, including ones bought across the border in Mexico.  This is the best I've tasted thus far.  Do not be frightened away by the "vanillin" content.  Vanillin is natural and occurs during the fermentation process of the beans.  It is not harmful.  The Propylene Glycol in the vanilla increases the freezing temperature of whatever you are making - so if using this for home made icre cream, wait until the VERY end of the freezing process to add the vanilla.  I paid just over $6 for a 33oz bottle at the Mexican super market.  Google-maps it, you may have one near by.  It is delicious vanilla and MUCH cheaper than it's competitors!

review/summary: Vanillin is NOT artificial vanilla! Read up before you slam!
review/text: This is amazing tasting vanilla and contrary to what others are saying it does not contain artificial vanilla. Vanillin is the crystalline substance that forms on the outside of the beans as they ferment. There is also an "artificial vanillin, but that is NOT what is contained here!. The following quote is from "The Joy of Baking": The beans are first plunged into hot water and then the 'drying' and 'sweating' process starts.  The beans are dried in the sun during the day and then wrapped in the blankets at night so they can sweat.  This process can last anywhere from 2 to 6 months until the beans become a very dark brown color and develop a white crystalline substance (or frost) on the outside of the bean, called vanillin.  The vanillin is what gives the beans their wonderful flavor and aroma and these beans are prized.<br /> [...]<br />So PLEASE, disregard these other bad reviews and try this. It is a STEAL!

review/text: In response to those who say this is no different than typical artificial vanilla, Molina Vanilla actually contains both real Mexican vanilla and artificial vanillin. It's much different than the stuff you'd buy in the supermarket. If you don't believe me, do a side by side taste test. You'll immediately notice that the Molina vanilla is much more aromatic, with a fuller range of flavor.  Personally I prefer Molina vanilla over both artificial vanilla and even the typical pure Madagascar vanilla.  I would recommend it to anyone.

review/summary: We love the "blended" traditional form of Mexican vanilla
review/text: Friends from Tahiti rave all the time about Tahitian vanilla.  They've given us some and I'll admit, it was pretty good.  Then we brought home Mexican "traditional" blended vanilla from a vacation to the Yucatan. We fell in love with it and started baking significantly more than we ever have in the past!  We started looking exclusively for recipes that included vanilla, and the more the better.  Since that first purchase we always came home from dive trips to Cozumel and the Yucatan with bottles of the stuff to use and give to family and friends.  The vanilla flavor of the vanilla/vanillin blend is superb and oh-so-vanilla-satisfying in everything you bake.<br /><br />We haven't made it back to Mexico in three years or so and recently ran out of our previous stock of traditional blend.  We used the higher alcohol Tahitian pure vanilla for baking recently but the flavor is noticeably different.  With no Mexican trips on the schedule we thought we'd give Molina Mexican Vanilla Blend a try from Amazon.  It arrived, we opened it, and it is absolutely the vanilla/vanillin blend we love.  As I type we have a Ricotta Mascarpone vanilla custard baking in the oven and the aroma of vanilla filling the house is wonderful.<br /><br />I understand that many folks only use pure vanilla.  That's great.  But if "pure" isn't that important to you and you just want incredible vanilla flavor, give Molina Mexican Vanilla Blend a try.

review/summary: Tasty, but fake, possibly Toxic vanilla.
review/text: It says Vanilla all over the bottle, but vanilla is not in the Ingredients. This is purely a mix of artificail ingredients and other "natural" (possibly toxic)substances that resemble vanilla taste, yet there is no actual vanilla in this.<br />I would definitely spend more money and research time before buying this. Don't be fooled!

review/summary: OUR NEW FAVORITE!
review/text: I had never bought Tiger Tiger curry paste before--I always buy Kitchens of India butter curry, and it's exquisite. But my husband always gets lamb korma when we go out to an Indian restaurant, so I thought I'd buy some of these and give them a try. WOW!! This is slightly sweet, very creamy (you add cream/half n half, or coconut milk) and you can taste what tastes like cashews in the sauce. Next time we make it, we're putting unsalted cashew pieces on top. Anyway, it's super-tasty and a decent deal, because it's sooo easy to make and sooo much cheaper than eating out. You can use this sauce on any kind of meat or veg. It's well-worth trying if you like mildish curry--we would have liked it hotter but we also have a 6 yr old who doesn't eat food as spicy as we like it...so we added the heat individually. Altogether, an excellent product and excellent price from Amazon! BTW, you'll need minimum of one whole package (2 pouches) to make dinner for 4 or 5.

This size bottle is perfect for the newborn that doesn't consume much formula and to avoid wasting formula since it goes bad after an hour of being opened.

I do wish they had the powder on the go option like Similac and Enfamil, but I won't use another formula as this one works well for my daughter.

It was mushy AND woody with a tinny, fishy flavor that was truly unpleasant. I had a sample from Costco from a bottled source recently which was excellent but I don't recall the brand off-hand.

I also noticed before ordering that the order would be from Amazon's warehouses so that helped lower the expectations as well.  In short, these are chocolate covered pretzels... sort of.  When I received them they were sadly packaged for such a delicate item.  The chocolate was broken off of most of the pretzels so some degree and many pretzels were broken as well.  What I ended up receiving was a back of semi-chocolate covered pretzel pieces and many chocolate pieces  They also had a hint of staleness to them as if they had been on the shelf a wee bit too long.  Poor production?  Bad storage?  Violent shipping?  Is hard to tell where things went wrong but one thing is for sure, I won't be buying these again.

Imagine my glee when I saw this price ...<br />24 for $49.99.  24 boxes for $49.99 comes to about $2.08 each .... except there was a problem.  I didn't get 24 boxes.  I got 4 boxes w/ 6 cookie bars which equals 24.  If you do the math, that comes to $12.50 per box. Girl Scout cookies don't cost that much! (YET ANYWAY!)<br />I quickly called Amazon, I was told this was the price.  I told them I wanted to return them and get a full refund.  No problem, we'll do you one better: keep the cookies and we'll refund you the full price.  I LOVE Amazon.  But, someone definitely dropped the ball on this one.  To charge $12.50 for a box of 6 cookie bars is highway robbery.  BEWARE Amazon Customers!

review/text: These sundried tomatoes were easy to reconstitute. Just cover with warm water and wait 30 minutes. We used them on vegan pizzas. We combined them with equal amounts of oil-packed sundried tomatoes (marinated a few hours) because we preferred the taste of oil-packed but wanted to cut down on the oil/calories (and expense). I thought they were fine, but my sister said she tasted something "soapy" in the pizza and believed it was the tomatoes. I didn't taste that, so couldn't determine the source. Anyway, I thought it was a good way to cut calories and maintain flavor. I would not use these exclusively without marinating them with equal amount of oil-packed sundried tomatoes.

It's definately more expensive, but it's worth it!...and their matzo balls seal the deal.
