review/summary: Greatest Container for Marmite . .  and other things.
review/text: I've been really loving the Big squeeze container.  As much as I really loved my Marmite jars (and I really DO miss the little 57g jars, the big squeeze has splodged its way right into my heart.  It's so great to be able to squirt out a line and then spread without any temptation to stick the buttery knife in the jar for a little more.<br /><br />I used up my first one a couple of weeks ago. I put some hot water in the container and shook it well to add the last bit to some chili that I was making.  (Yes, I do add Marmite to chili, bumps up both nutrition and beefy complexity of flavor.)<br /><br />The smaller squeeze container is nice enough . . . I do like that size for Bovril, so I can carry it in my bag to make drinks.  The big one is just awesome!<br /><br />The container makes a great travel container for other things, also . . . thought it IS recyclable.

review/text: Simply Organic has delicious spice mixes. The Vegetarian Chili one is alchemical. All one needs to do is blend it with water, then put the roux (so to speak) in the mixture of beans/diced tomatoes... I added corn. I used kidney and black beans. It's a flavorful spice mix that subtly spicy. Surprising, considering that it's made in Iowa. It's spicy enough to merit sour cream and shredded cheese topping. Delicious and nutritious!

review/summary: Never liked oatmeal until I tried this
review/text: WOW!  I grew up hating oatmeal - thought it was slimey and reminded me of wallpaper paste.  Could only tolerate it when used as an ingredient in cookies, meatloaf, etc.  First time I ate Silver Palate Oatmeal I was amazed at the difference.  There was actual taste and texture that was good!  I've since tried other rough cut, minimally processed oatmeals but I keep coming back to Silver Palate.  Sometimes I even get a craving for this oatmeal - which I would never have imagined could happen to a confirmed oatmeal hater.

review/summary: Very Good Stuff!
review/text: I tried this oatmeal because of Silver Palate's reputation and an incredible 50% off deal.  It's great.  Not mushy at all.  Substantial.  It has changed my idea of traditional oatmeal - I'd become a McCann's steel cut guy.  I still prefer McCann's (and Trader Joe's less expensive steel cut), but some days I don't have 30 minutes to make McCann's, and the 8-10 minute cooking time for Silver Palate is a plus.  (I find McCann's fast cooking oatmeal inedible.)

review/text: If the only oatmeal you've eaten is Quaker Oats, you'll be pleasantly surprised at how much better Silver Palate Thick & Rough Oatmeal is.  The texture is chewy rather than mushy, and the taste is nutty rather than bland.  I make it with milk rather than water for extra richness.  Throw in some raisins, dried cranberries, fresh fruit, walnuts, a little cinnamon sugar -- whatever you like and have on hand.  It's a delicious, nutritious and satisfying breakfast.  Be sure to follow the directions carefully if you cook it in the microwave.  You'll need a deep bowl and no higher than 50 percent power level; otherwise it will boil over.  It's not an instant breakfast by any means, but well worth the time.

review/summary: Tastes Good, Liked The Texture, But...Doesn't Make The "Cut"
review/text: Oatmeal is an excellent choice for breakfast. It has fiber and protein and has no cholesterol and even helps to reduce cholesterol levels. I have it almost every morning. I especially like the steel cut oats for the taste, texture and the way it satisfies me at breakfast and sustains me until lunch. But sometimes I just want to try something a little different for a change of pace. So I decided to give Silver Palate Thick and Rough Oatmeal a go. This 4 pack looked to be a much better deal than buying an individual package at my local market.<br /><br />The 'steel cut' oats I have been using take about 30 minutes to cook up - there is an instant or quick cook in that style but I prefer the regular - and I have found it very much worth the wait and even getting up a little earlier to get them going. So beside a change of pace and texture,I thought these would be good for mornings I didn't have as much time. These cook up in about 10 minutes and are way better than the instant. It was definitely nice for a little variety. Tasted great and I liked the texture as well. Following the directions for 1 serving I found though, it was not enough to satisfy - I am a pretty small person, it doesn't take much to fill me up. Next I tried the 2 serving recipe(double) and this I did find to be filling enough for a good breakfast, but even at that they did not sustain me until lunch. I noticed after a few days I was always getting hungry again about halfway to lunch time.<br /><br />So even though I really liked them, I feel that having to double the recipe(also double the calories) was really not such a good buy when you break it down to cost per serving. Add that to the extra snack I was having between meals and I just didn't think these were worth the change.<br /><br />If you already know that you like and prefer this brand and style, you are getting a good deal here in comparison to buying one box at a time. Also there are some pretty good recipes for cookies and bread(on the inside of the carton) that may make for some nice holiday fare as well as a granola recipe on the back of the box that I will give a try.<br /><br />Ingredients are 100% Natural Whole Grain Rolled Oats(A really good thing)<br />For nutrition facts there is a link to click on the detail/buying page<br /><br />I like to top of my oatmeal with either a little honey, raisins or blueberries, and every once in a while, a light(low-fat) butter flavor substitute and a tiny bit of salt.<br /><br />Remember to breathe, eat healthy, and...enjoy the holidays....Laurie

review/text: I am not a grain scientist, so I do not understand how this is so good, but it is. The grains hold together without getting mushy and have a perfect nutty flavor, yet it cooks up to a thick and comforting consistency. This is the only stuff I like.<br /><br />I have been packing jars of this mixed with cinnamon, brown sugar and dried fruit and cooking it in the office microwave. It cooks up in about 4 minutes.<br /><br />It usually has me running to the bathroom an hour later. Lots of fiber I guess.

review/text: My wife and I have really enjoyed Silver Palate's oatmeal.  With 5g of fiber in just 1/3 cup of oatmeal makes it the most fiber-filled oatmeal we have come across.  It is not to be confused with an instant oatmeal though, as so much fiber comes with much needed patience because of its long preparation time. Along with its great taste, we highly recommend it.

I appreciate that it can be made quickly and easily on the stove or microwave (my family prefers the stove top) - a hot and wholesome way to start the day.  Make it in water or milk; sprinkle in some vanilla, cinnamon, maple syrup and/or brown sugar; and serve with fresh fruit or nuts it is filling and satisfying.  The box claims that it "splendidly nutritious" and "helps to reduce cholesterol".  That may be true, but we go back to it again and again for its taste.

review/text: Silver Palate oatmeal in my opinion is simply the best oatmeal on the market.  I never cook this or anything else via microwave.  That being said, this oatmeal has never disappointed!  I start out by lightly toasting the dry oats in a frying pan which takes about 2  minutes. Then I cook per the box instructions.<br />If you like to flavor your oatmeal, you cannot go wrong with fresh ground cinnamon.  If you want a dessert for breakfast, try it with a little butter and brown sugar!  Of course dry or fresh fruit is always good as well.

If you are a Prime member you pay no shipping and no tax so comparing the price to our grocery stores it's a nice savings on the bet oatmeal. I only wish I could use the coupons they occassionally come with, but that's a minor savings of .25 . I'll be ordering again next month as we eat it almost every morning.

review/summary: Loose tea quality from a convenient tea bag!
review/text: Dilmah teas are singles source, 100% Ceylon teas from Sry Lanka. Ceylon teas grown on the large Island nation of Sri Lanka share a bright, pleasant, smooth flavor that varies with the elevation where the teas are grown (as well as with the variety of tea plant, of course). In general, lowland teas are robust, dark, and powerful while teas grown high in the mountains (up to 6,000+ feet) tend to be lighter in color, more complex in taste, like a fine Himalayan Darjeeling. This is a gross generalization; however, one can taste strong differences. Most teas, even many loose teas, are blends from different estates. Dilmah blends are all excellent, especially their Supreme Ceylon, yet something individual and unique is lost in a blend. There is something special about experiencing a tea taken from a single estate and type of tea plant. Most Americans prefer tea bags. Until now, single-source Estate teas have only been available as loose tea (for good reason, because tea bags generally contain tea leaf powder, or fannings and dust, not whole leaves, so they will color quickly and produce fast flavor in the cup). As a result, most Americans, unless they go out of their way to buy the few good brands of tea bags, such as Numi, never drink a decent cup of tea! Even "good" tea bags from Numi, Peet's tea, or Republic of Tea tend to be blends or "flavored" teas containing jasmine, chai spices, etc. Dilmah's Single Estate Tea bags are different...<br /><br />The special Dilmah bag design and the quality loose tea in that bag produces a delicious, single Estate cup of tea. I was skeptical at first, but, knowing Dilmah's quality, I gave the Somerset Estate tea a try. It is delicious! A smooth, beautifully colored and highly flavorful black tea. Delightful for morning or afternoon, with or without food or sweets. High quality loose tea in a tea bag costs a bit more; however, if you don't want the hassle of brewing with loose tea in a tea pot, or need a nice tea to enjoy in your office, this is the tea for you! In fact, I suggest you give all Dilmah teas a try. They are new to the U.S. and, as far as I know here in S. California, only available online. As such, they make a unique gift a recipient has not seen in every store.<br /><br />Dilmah single source fine Ceylon tea finally came to the United States only a few years ago. We first tasted Dilmah teas in Moscow, Russia back in 1994. At that time, Dilmah was a brand limited to European countries and Russia. As an everyday tea bag, Dilmah had the dark, tasteless Lipton tea bags ubiquitous to U.S. restaurants beat hands down. It was a flavorful, slightly sweet, pleasant daily tea. I enjoyed it so much I brought a giant box home in my luggage both times I went to Russia. Unfortunately, I could not buy Dilmah anywhere in the U.S. Fast forward to just a few years ago when an importer finally brought this extraordinary tea brand to the U.S. I initially ordered from one of only a handful of online sellers ([...] that offers free shipping), but I'm delighted to discover that a selection of Dilmah teas are now available from Amazon. It appears Dilmah is finally being "discovered," and that's about time.<br /><br />For those with a social conscience for workers and the environment, I've discovered that Dilmah teas are ethically grown and owned by the tea growers (that's an important boost to quality). The company takes care of its workers (mostly experienced women picking in the field) by providing village-based work and has established a humanitarian assistance foundation: [...]. Dilmah is involved in housing, builds local schools, and so forth. Dilmah also cares about the environment and the wildlife that lives on the land where their ancient tea plants are grown. The company supports wildlife protection and conservation through their Dilmah Conservation organization: [...]. That means a lot to me as a consumer.<br /><br />You can learn more and watch videos at [...]. Give this ethical, high quality, reasonably priced tea brand a try! If you are seeking an inexpensive tea bag to replace your ho-hum Lipton or Tetley or generic store tea bags, try Dilmah's blue box, inexpensive, Premium Leaf Dilmah Ceylon tea bags. If you want individually foil wrapped, good quality tea bags for office or travel, order one of their boxed teas, such as Ceylon Supreme, Irish Breakfast, or Afternoon Tea. Their British Breakfast blend tea bag is also good. For luxurious, single estate tea bags, try Somerset Estate. For single region teas (from several local Estates) try Uda Watte (high grown at 4-5,000 ft) and Ran Watte (high grown at 6,000 ft, similar to a Darjeeling).<br /><br />Dilmah is our favorite every day tea brand. It deserves more "shelf space" in the USA. (Dump your over-hyped, mediocre TAZO tea brand, Starbucks, and pick up Dilmah quality instead!)

review/text: That cake was sooo smooth and moist and tasted just right and even better heated for 10 seconds in the microwave... OH...MY...GOD. I hate to say this bit it was gone in about 24hrs from it's opening... we each ate half and totally enjoyed it! Next time, make sure it leaves the maps to my hips at the factory! But I am gladly cutting those calories now because it was so good... I would even fake out and bring it somewhere and tell them it was all my work and love it! but then blab at the end and credit Miss Ellie...honesty.. is a free coffee cake for telling the truth...hint...hint....

review/summary: False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!
review/text: I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food at first, and slowly began to not like it. After reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs." Basically, dogs cannot fully digest corn as they are carnivores. Corn it is just a cheap filler that can cause dogs to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. Most inexpensive low-quality pet foods have lots of these fillers and cheap ingredients with little to no nutritional value.The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging if the product does not contain the pictured items; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (non vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness. High-quality foods tend to be more nutritionally dense, meaning you will be feeding a much smaller amount for the same number of calories. If you do the math to figure out the cost for the number of calories you need to feed your pet, many premium foods are CHEAPER than the awful crap you're buying at the grocery store.

review/text: I used to love Nestle Milk Chocolate Bars. They were rich, creamy,and velvety- a sinfully delightful candy bar. They were my favorite high quality tasting chocolate. I just purchased several to keep on hand and needed my a fix for my chocolate craving so I bit into a bar expecting a little bit of heaven. YUCK! YUCK! YUCK! It tasted grainy, sugary and thin. I couldn't believe it. The consistency is worse than a Hershey Chocolate Bar and the taste is worse than generic. It was horribly disappointing to realize that they switched to cheaper tasting ingredients and the company probably thinks we won't notice much. What a shame. I guess I'll permanently switch to Ghiradelli, Godiva or Lindt and pay more. When it comes to chocolate TASTE IS EVERYTHING, or what's the point?

review/summary: Great Green Tea Experience, Tazo's Best
review/text: *****<br /><br />Tazo's China Green Tips Green Tea is a slightly stronger green tea than Tazo's Zen, and I liked that it doesn't contain Tazo's omnipresent "natural flavors" that almost all of their other teas contain, which to me is not an advantage. I like a natural, real taste with real ingredients sans vague "natural flavors" and sans flavorings, sans essences, etc. China Green Tips delivers this in a cleaner, purer way than Tazo's other teas. I liked this green tea!<br /><br />The ingredients in China Green Tips are simply spring-harvested green teas from China. It contains caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague and unnecessary for a super premium tea. China Green Tips has none of these "natural flavors" and it shows in the quality and cleanliness of the tea experience.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a traditional Chinese green tea with a delicate fresh taste and a light green liquor." This is the perfect way to describe this tea! On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of China Green Tips as "grassy, vegetative, sweet, ricey". Tazo describes the aroma as "vegetative, popcorn".<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi or Aspen. Still, this tea is excellent, so I'm breaking my tradition with Tazo teas and giving it five stars. If you enjoy super premium teas, and are stuck with Tazo for some reason, choose China Green Tips and you will be quite satisfied. I can't honestly say that about any other Tazo tea.<br /><br />*****

review/summary: What Happened to the Rao's recipe
review/text: I have always been a fan or Rao's Marinara sauce and willing to shell out the premium price of $7-$9 a bottle. However of late (I would say within the last 3-6 months) the recipe or process has apparently changed. The sauce is no where near as fresh tasting as it once was. The sauce is now more homogenized and bland to the point that I will no longer shell out the premium price for a product that is no better then sauces selling for $2 a bottle. It is sad that the company has cut corners in the way that they have (perhaps they have expanded production and are using a new supplier). I hope that they return to their original recipe or drop the new manufacturing source.<br /><br />Considering the price point and the average quality I would rate the current product as poor.<br /><br />I would be interested in other opinions.<br /><br />Sign me an unhappy customer.

The sauce is simple enough to use as a pizza topping and gives the pizza a nice kick without competing with the other topping ingredients.  As a pasta sauce,  or for chicken cacciatore,  veal, chicken or eggplant parmesan it's perfect.

review/summary: Tricky Food Dispenser
review/text: One of my dogs loves this, the other one couldn't care less! It is trickier than your average "ball treat dispenser" which is perhaps why my one pooch doesn't bother with it . . . he prefers the less challenging option :-(  My 7-month old puppy is mesmerized by this toy however and it occupies her for extended periods of time! The drawback is that it's made of a hard plastic and therefore can make quite a racket up against a wall or tumbling down the stairs. Also, the top is too large for her to grab with her mouth to remove from a corner, so it will sometimes get stuck in places and I have to retrieve it for her . . . this makes it a less than ideal option for her when I'm not home (she's a 7 month old, 30 pound elkhound pup).

review/summary: Best Affordable GF Spaghetti
review/text: I have remained unimpressed with all of the rice spaghettis on the market -- even Tinkyada. While other shapes of rice pasta cook up just fine, spaghetti is just harder to cook "just right" and the rice noodles tend to stick together and clump.<br />I have much better luck using corn pasta when I want spaghetti. Unfortunately, Mrs. Leeper's spaghetti is just too expensive (as is Tinkyada). I can buy rice pasta from Trader Joe's at a reasonable price, but I pretty much gave up on having spaghetti as a regular part of our family menu.<br />Then one day Amazon started carrying the Sam's Mills corn spaghetti! I had used the other shapes of Sam's Mills pastas before, and knew they were good. I was excited to try this because I liked the Mrs. Leeper's corn spaghetti, but couldn't justify the expense when I could make do with other shapes of pasta from Trader Joe's for half the price.<br />I couldn't be happier with the product. I only wish I'd ordered more because now Amazon is out of stock! But I got a large case and it should last me a while. Thanks, Amazon, for carrying this great gluten-free pasta. Our family is enjoying "spaghetti night" once again!

review/text: I rely on reviews when I order a new product and I went with the majority in making my decision to purchase this pasta.  The other brand I loved became simply unaffordable, though it is still my first choice, so only four stars for this brand.  This has been a welcome surprise as I was willing to "make do" simply because it was cheaper.  It really is very good pasta.  My whole family, (Mom, sisters, aunts) are all gluten intolerant and they all enjoyed this pasta.  Even my husband who can eat wheat prefers this pasta now.  It is a little starchier than the other brand which shall remain nameless due to the shameful shipping costs and exorbitant price. But it is no where near the glutenous mass that is rice pasta and the corn pasta has great flavor and is almost indistinguishable from regular pasta.  The pasta even holds up nicely in soup!  I will be ordering again.

The taste is somewhat bland, but I'm not complaining. I get tastes out of the other foods I eat with it. It's a vegan product and has no added MSG or preservatives and is gluten free.

review/summary: Whatever happened to HOT cinnamon candy?
review/text: Valentines Day is one of those rare holidays where I join the Philistines whose favorite candy is not chocolate.  Forget the heart shaped box, the chocolate chip roses, the cakes.  Give me cinnamon that's hotter than a scorned woman's temper.<br /><br />Except, where did it go?  Somewhere in the past few years, cinnamon candy got namby pamby.  Someone told me that people complained.<br /><br />These are not the red hot Jelly Bellys I used to get. You know, the ones that made your nose run?  And in a cold February, there's nothing better. (Well, nothing I'm going to talk about here, anyway) They're sanitized, expurgated, dare I say it?  MILD, kiddie candy.<br /><br />Still looking for my sinfully hot cinnamon for the year.  Any suggestions?<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, February 2009

review/summary: another great product from Firstmate
review/text: I tried the lamb dog food because the blueberry and chicken flavor was on back order, and even though it is a little more expensive, I'm glad I did.  It's a nice alternative flavor for our dog and he experienced no digestive problems with the change, one of the benefits of Firstmate dog foods -- all flavors are interchangeable.  I would urge the reader to try this or any other Firstmate dog food flavor.

If you can afford this food, buy it, you won't regret it.<br /><br />No, I don't work for First Mate BTW, but I used to work at a pet store that sold it and every pet on it was super happy and healthy and the owners were so happy with the improvements in their pets. If I didn't do a raw diet for my cats now they would still be eating First Mate.

review/summary: The tea is just the icing...
review/text: This tea chest is amazing - burled rosewood that looks and feels just right. The box is pretty solidly built and well designed for its purpose too - with felt liners, and nifty compartments. A felted gasket ensures it shuts with the feel of a well built German luxury car - and this also serves to keep the contents protected.<br />The tea bags that come with it - sure they may be 'worth' just 20c ea - but their purpose is to complement the box and  fulfil the olfactory and gustatory senses.<br />[A fairly broad selection of bags - 8 types, with 8 bags apiece is included. They include regular and spiced chai teas, citrus and herbal teas, and one low caff variety, many of which may be available at your grocery store].<br />If you even mildly like tea, snap it up especially if this ever makes it to the Gold Box or Lightning Deal.

review/summary: You are buying a beautiful tea box, not just tea bags
review/text: When buying this product, think that you are buying a nice tea box that will be used to present tea options to your guests. The tea bags that come with it are nice, but the idea is to refill the box over and over for years to come. So, this purchase is not about the tea, it's about the box.<br />The box is made out of high quality wood and it's beautiful. The outside is reddish brown (mahogany) color. The inside is green velvet. It's nicely built with even a thumb indentation that allows to open the box easily. The only thing that distracts from the high quality of box is the golden "Celestial" logo that is stamped in the inside of the lid of the box.

review/summary: Horrible quality for price
review/text: I rarely write reviews but am shocked this rated so highly (which is why I bought it in the first place).  I am a big tea drinker and wanted a single box to consolidate all of my teas and clear out a cupboard. This was difficult to do as the tea bags don't fit in the box standing up, so you cannot really fit much more than the 64 tea bags it comes with, and all must lay flat for the box to close.  My main problem though is the box itself; it is a piece of junk.  It is made of that chemical-smelling made-in-China-furniture "wood", if you know what I mean.  You don't want your tea to taste/smell like that, especially if you want to store the teas that don't come in foil packets (uh, like Celestial Seasonings...).  I cannot believe this cost $55, it is worth maybe $20, counting the tea!!  Horrid quality for the outrageous price.

review/summary: The coffee is great, but other buyers were right: mysterious punch hole
review/text: The coffe is really great, makes very aromatic, full bodied espresso.  I would just like to review the packaging more. I ordered several packs of these, packaged in bricks of 4, vacuum-packed, and covered with clear plastic. Very impressed because of the efficiency of packaging, very tightly packed. Of the 3 sets I ordered,  one set had one of the bricks with a punch hole at the bottom, seems mysterious since the clear plastic covering the 4 bricks was in no way punched and remained intact. It's just the one brick with the punch hole at the bottom. I wonder how it got that way. Anyway, this would have been 5-stars but for that. Highly recommend the coffee.

After Senseo stopped making their pods, we bought the Coffee Duck/Ecopad pack from Amazon but weren't sure which coffee to use in them.  Tried the Crema e Gusto based on high reviews and are happy we did! Best cup of coffee from our Senseo machine ever!  Much smoother and lower acidity than the Senseo coffee we were used to, and can get some nice crema when using the Ecopads. Price can't be beat, either!

review/text: I bought this to use with a 3 cup espresso maker.  This stuff seems to last quite a while, even though I fill up the holding dish to the top.  The espresso tastes great and in my opinion (if you flavor it right) is just as good or better than many of the coffee products that you can purchase that are made for you (aka starbucks, caribou, etc).  Buying it in the 4 pack also brings down cost quite a bit.<br /><br />Overall, a great product and highly recommended.  It is a very bold flavor, so if you aren't in to dark and bold coffee then beware.

Although it has a very high concentration of robusta beans (60 or 70%) instead of the market-favored arabica beans (40 or 30%),  it's the robusta beans which produce such an excellent creamy and rich crema, from both my stove-top espresso maker and my Nespresso machine (I fill my own home-made capsules with this brand...see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005UP1M4I">Ne-Cap Nespresso� Compatible Refill Capsules</a> ), and the espresso is absolutely perfect. No bitterness, just rich, dark and flavorful. Would buy again if it goes on sale (the Amazon price is still better than NYC supermarkets which sell one pack for $4.75),

We've tried several Lavazza pre-ground and all are pleasing, this is no exception. you aren't taking any chances here, except for a slightly higher-than-prefered price.

review/text: I love this espresso coffee, it makes such a nice cup of espresso with an amazing crema.  It's very consistent and the flavor is smooth, however I have noticed that I get a major headache after drinking an espresso made with this coffee.  I am making it properly with the right amount of coffee so I know it's not that.  It's also not the caffeine since I drink drip coffee almost every day.  That leaves really one thing which is the robusta beans that is blended with arabica to make this coffee.<br /><br />Great coffee, just not for me and if anyone else experiences this then it's the robusta beans so just try another 100% arabic blend, it comes out good anyways.

review/text: I've tried just about anything when it comes to ground coffee for espresso machines, and nothing comes close to this Lavazza. I've been ordering it regularly for over a year now, and am very happy with it. It makes an espresso rich in taste and smell, with a pleasant hint of chocolate flavor (you can barely notice it). It certainly helps me start my day the right way!

review/summary: The best breakfast coffee we ever had
review/text: We love Crema e Gusto for breakfast. It has the smooth and intense flavor of the coffee in Europe; no bitter or over roasted. There is nothing better.

review/summary: My favorite for cappucino
review/text: Using Lavazza Crema Gusto in my Moka is like being back in Italy. It makes a great cup of cappucino, without which I cannot start my day.  Rich flavor, strongly roasted but not burnt tasting.  The vacuum package keeps it very fresh.

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: Amazing espresso coffee! I strongly advise anyone who as the passion for espresso coffee to buy this brand! Although once in a while due to the packaging the bricks come with small holes making it loose it's freshness and vacuum properties...<br />Besides this small problem it's definitely the best espresso coffee you can get in America!!!

review/summary: Starbucks has nothing on Lavazza
review/text: After spending almost $5.00 a day for months at Starbucks on iced lattes with an extra shot, I finally got wise and did some research on Amazon. After purchasing an espresso maker, I had to find a quality espresso to go along with it. The description is 100% accurate. Smooth and not bitter. This is the best espresso I have ever tasted. Thank goodness I can order it from Amazon.

review/summary: Super delicious
review/text: I recently bought an espresso maker  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002A3S66">De'Longhi BAR32 Retro 15 BAR Pump Espresso and Cappuccino Maker</a>  which I love, and wanted some good coffee to go with it.  Originally I was going to buy the illy espresso, but I saw this and it's cheaper and got great reviews, which are definitely well-deserved.  It's so delicious and I love the smell of the coffee - it's chocolaty.  MMMmmmmmmm.

review/summary: Great Coffee, Honey!
review/text: I was enthralled with the coffee I was served in Florence, Italy years ago and brought some home.  Now, it's available in the U.S. and it's Lavazza.  My local market used to sell it and no longer does but amazon comes through for us.  The flavor is intense but not harsh and has a slight mocha flavor (at least to my untrained palate).  The only negative is my own fault by not noticing that I was ordering a 4-pack, so I have more than I need.  After giving one away to someone who probably won't appreciate it, I'm going to keep the rest and transport myself back to Florence every morning.  The grind is fine enough for an espresso maker but also works for drip makers, although you should use less than usual at first.  It's pretty strong.  Americans are inundated with choices of coffee these days, but I highly recommend trying Lavazza if you're a regular coffee drinker.  The price was very reasonable, even with the shipping.  Share the cost and product with 3 friends at first to give it a try.<br />Ciao
