review/summary: dog likes it
review/text: Dog likes it and it seems to have less fat than the cheap stuff. We adopted a 7 year old Corgi mix who was raised on this and decided to contiue it because of his remarkable good health, solid muscles and lean condition. We do walk him quite a lot, but the combination of enough exercise, very little junk food and this food has resulted in a really healthy doggie.

review/summary: Not my dog's favorite..
review/text: The main thing here is, your dog has to like it and eat it, not how healthy it is for him.  My dog will eat this when there are no other options (Ex. cat food, mooching food from someone), but he won't dive on this stuff first thing.  I also had some Blue Buffalo food which got the same response; that bag was given to me by someone who couldn't get THEIR dog to eat it.

review/summary: Doogs and puppies LOVE this!!
review/text: My only complaint about this is the same complaint I have about most all designer pet foods - PRICE. I understand it costs more to make with specialty ingredients and smaller batches, but the difference in cost is really more than necessary. Having said that, my dogs LOVE this food, they don't have to be "coaxed" or "bribed" to eat it by desguising it with canned food or sauces, and the hot spots they developed when eating the other food with wheat and corn are disappearing. They LOVE the duck!!

review/text: My two terriers love this dog food, never snubbing it or holding out for something better.  Amazon also has a better price that the retail pet stores who constantly try to get you buy an add-on.  I find the 15 lb package easier to lift and store versus the 30 lb, especially since it is only a little more than the 30lb.

I toast it in the toaster oven for 5 or 6 minutes until the nuts start to look golden brown, and then let the bread cool for a couple of minutes. After this treatment the bread is much less likely to fall apart, and tastes great.

review/text: This is a great product, and it is extremely palatable.  It is usually used as a travel food because it is easy to travel with and even dogs who don't eat while traveling will eat this.  It can be fed alone either dry or rehydrated. My dogs like to eat this crumbled and mixed with water, but they'll eat it dry and it pieces too. They just really, really like it a lot. It's a bit expensive to feed as a sole diet, so I feed mostly Nature's variety Instinct Dry (rotate between flavors) and then supplement with the freeze dried medallions.

review/summary: A Bland Type of Mush.
review/text: Our son (one year old) now eats solid foods. What should we give him? Well, the doctor says he can have anything we eat, as long as he can handle it. OK. When we eat, he eats some of our stuff. He loves going to the neighborhood frozen yogurt shop, that's for sure. He enjoys refried beans in many Mexican places. He loved my split-pea soup with ham. Apple sauce is one of his favorite foods. When we go to the In 'n' Out Burger, he loves the french fries and parts of the burger, and I hesitate even to mention the chocolate shakes. Yum!<br /><br />In addition, my wife has picked up a variety of more traditional baby foods and many of those have been made by Gerber under the Graduates heading. This afternoon, he dined on one of the Graduates lil' entrees, specifically the Pasta Stars in Meat Sauce. This particular dining experience was an almost total failure. He ingested a couple spoons of the pasta sauce and then refused to eat any more. I gave him a few if the green beans. He took them in, a negative experience was recorded on his face and they came right back out. Hmmmmm. I wondered what the problem was. So, I took a spoon and ate the pasta sauce. It was bland and way overcooked but it didn't taste all that bad. I also ate the beans. They were severely overcooked. Both parts of the entree were cooked to the point where they resembled some type of mush. Well, after dining on french fries and hamburgers, no wonder he winces at these entrees. He needn't worry any more. He won't be getting any further Gerber's lil' entrees. My wife also noted that they were packaged in a #7 plastic container and she said she'd serve them no longer. Not all is bad about the Graduates items, however, our son loves the Crunchies and Wagon wheels.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: A Yankee's take on a British staple
review/text: Having lived in the US all of my life (although I have traveled quite a bit) I had never heard of Marmite until last week.  I've been participating in an on-line, UK based think-tank dealing with international brands and digital advertising.  As we discussed products that we grew up with and are still loyal to Marmite came up several times.  I looked at some Marmite ads (the British call them "adverts"), and then searched for it on Amazon.  Being a dedicated foodie I decided to give it a shot.  Here is my impression:<br /><br />When I first opened the glass jar and gave it a whiff it seemed oddly familiar.  I put just a dab on my spoon and tasted it straight.  Again, strangely familiar.  The taste was very strong, almost condensed.  I could taste the beer-like yeast but I was also getting a savory, deep vegetable flavor. Then it hit me.<br /><br />I love to make sauces and I often use pre-made glaces and demi-glaces which have a very thick consistency when gently heated (before heating they are almost solid).  They come in many different varieties: beef; duck; veal; chicken; lamb; seafood; mushroom; vegetable; etc.  Marmite has a strong resemblance to a straight, undiluted, vegetable glace.  Pungent, earthy and with that quality that the Japanese refer to as "Umami".  WOW!  Who knew?  Well, I guess a lot of people did but it was new to me.  Now, what to do with it...<br /><br />My on-line British friends gave me some sage advice: use it sparingly and on some sort of bread with butter.  I bought some fresh English Muffin bread from a local artisan bakery shop, lightly toasted it, coated it thinly with about 2/3 teaspoon of Marmite and spread some salted Vermont cultured butter onto it.  HEAVEN!  The Marmite balanced out the heaviness of the butter perfectly.  That gave me the inspiration for my next test.  I've alway loved a toasted bagel with cream cheese or Marscapone but need something to cut the palate-coating fat of the cheese besides a slice of onion (lox works well if you have it).  Marmite fit the bill technically, but I think that I will have to get used to the combination.  Still, I will keep using it here for a while and I think that it might become a favorite for me.<br /><br />Next I tried it in a simple sauce.  I browned a tablespoon of finely chopped shallots in 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter (who am I kidding? I used 2 tablespoons of butter).  After the shallots were browned I added 3 tablespoons of Marite and 1 teaspoon of water.  I reduced it a little and added 1/3 cup of heavy cream, a small bouquet garnet in cheesecloth and 1 tablespoon of dry sherry. I reduced it by about half and adjusted the strength by adding more Marmite (I needed more, maybe I should have used less cream).  When finished it tasted really good, not great but it could certainly WOW most people.  Put this on fish, chicken, turkey, or any light meat or veggie and it works.<br /><br />Marmite has an advertising campaign that tells people that they will either love it or hate it.  I am definitely in the love camp.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029SGS3O">Veggie-Glace Gold (Classic Roasted Vegetable Demi-Glace) - 1.5oz</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010OQP90">More Than Gourmet Veggie-stock Gold; Vegetable Stock, 16-Ounce Packages</a>

review/summary: Something is different
review/text: I love both Marmite and Vegemite, but have always preferred Marmite. I recently exhausted my last jar, so decided to order the 4 pack from Amazon since I live in the US and it is hard to come by. Now, my previous jars of Marmite were a thick, nearly black paste, resembling bearing grease, but this stuff is so thin I can almost pour it out.  It's also much, much lighter in color. I made a couple of slices of toast and spread one with my Vegemite, the other with my new Marmite. I was shocked at the lightness of the Marmite. More shocking was the flavor seemed to be less intense than the Vegemite, which was not the case before. I have since read that many long time Marmite fans have been complaining about a change in our beloved spread. Unilever denies any change in the recipe, but that is nonsense. It's still tasty, and the seller ships quickly, so I'm giving it 4 stars, but I'm beginning to prefer Vegemite over this "new" Marmite. The "old" Marmite is a solid 5 stars.

If you want a departure from the morning toast with butter and jam, skip the butter and jam and smear on some Marmite!  Your coffee will taste brighter!<br /><br />This stuff it definitely a different way to hammer on your taste buds in a vigorous fassion!

review/text: It might be an acquired taste for some, but Marmite is really tasty!  A little goes a long way, I like it best spread lightly on buttered toast with eggs in the morning!  The quality of this particular shipment was great too.  It was fresh and easily spreadable.

review/summary: Quick, easy, and delicious!!
review/text: I've been a fan of Betty Crocker Complete Meals (especially the Chicken and Buttermilk Biscuits) for a long time, but they're getting increasingly difficult to find in stores. I was thrilled to find them here on Amazon at a great price!<br /><br />Making them is extremely simple:<br />1. Mix bisquick mix (included) and water in bowl<br />2. Pour soup (included) into a caserole dish<br />3. Mix in seasoning packet (included), milk and water<br />4. Plop bisquick into the caserole dish.<br />5. Bake for about 35 minutes<br />6. Eat up!<br /><br />Each box makes 2-3 servings depending on how big of an eater you are. My wife and I easily finish off the box in one sitting.<br /><br />Highly recommended for a quick, easy, delicious meal that takes minimal preparation!

review/summary: Easy to prepare and hearty tasting
review/text: I was interested in trying this so I ordered a case. I must say it was very easy to make. Looking at it, it does not look appealing. In the box are a can, topping, and also the biscuit mix. You have everything you need in the box but you need to buy or have milk. This is how you prepare it:<br /><br />* Open biscuit mix and mix with � cup water (I used warm, mix until lumps are out) place to side<br />* Take can and open and place in ungreased glass pan<br />* Add seasoning mix to can contents<br />* Mix 2/3 milk to seasoning and can mix in pan<br />* Add 9 biscuit drops to top and bake!<br /><br />The can consist of sauce, chicken, celery, potatoes, peas, and carrots. I took the celery out and even all the chicken. I knew it would be low quality chicken but it was not appealing at all. I might add Swanson white can chicken in the future. I took a picture of when it was done and also when I served it and uploaded it to the photo gallery.<br /><br />Above was my first attempt at making it, it is so simple! It is also great to serve leftover and heats fast. I would say it serves two hearty servings for adults. The next time I made it I added a can of cream corn to the pan and also a small can of carrots and peas. Adding more vegetables and the cream of corn, made it delicious! I am sure when you make it you can add what you desire. At first I was going to give this only 3 stars. I did not hate it but did not love it either by looking at it. However, tasting it, it has an incredible flavor! When it was done I only sprinkled a little pepper on it and it taste great! For the flavor it gets 4 stars!

review/summary: Good shelf stable product to have on hand
review/text: All in all, a pretty tasty dish. The biscuits come out and golden brown and the filling part has a nice chicken pot pie consistency. You can put in your own favorite add-ins, I personally add mushrooms and about 5 oz of canned chicken breast (I like it extra chickeny).  It feeds two adults and two small kids if you have sides.  You only have to get the baking dish and one mixing bowl dirty.  Best thing is that you can always have it in your pantry, ready to go if you need it.  Also, don't worry if when you put in the biscuit mixture and it sinks to the bottom out of sight through the thin soup mixture, the soup eventually thickens and the biscuits float to the top and bake up real nice.

review/text: I personally hated these, but I also hate fig newtons and I didn't buy them for myself.  I bought them for my 4 yr old son who is on a gluten-free casein-free diet and is very picky.  My son needed a snack option and we wanted to sneak some fruit into his diet.  Surprisingly enough, given the reviews and my own opinion, he absolutely LOVES these.  So, if you have a child on a special diet, it is probably worth buying a single box and trying it out... you just never know with kids!

review/summary: Liked them in the past, not any more...
review/text: Original Review:<br /><br />I don't eat a lot of different foods because I'm very particular. But these bars are good to me. They taste like a normal fruit bar so they pass my test! Just don't eat a lot at once or they will probably make you sick. The flavor, texture and size is nice. If you have a gluten free diet, I think you should try these. If you have a normal diet, these may be nasty to you. I like them and may buy again but try a different flavor.<br /><br />Since we have to buy 6 boxes in bulk, I wish there was an option where we could choose more than one flavor in our order. But overall, I'm happy with this product.<br /><br />Edited Review:<br /><br />I have been sensitive to gluten since 2009, so I'm used to eating really nasty gluten free foods. Now that I've tasted a lot of store bought and homemade bars, I had to change my review. Now the bars are not as good when compared to other brands...but are not the worst I've had. A person not on a special restrictive diet would not enjoy them. I'm on a gluten free diet and I no longer enjoy them. Times have changed and the gluten free world is getting better, so you may want to do your research and seek out better brands or even make some yourself. They're okay, but not great.

I can't recommend these to anyone unless their getting them free and even then I wouldn't eat too many of them as they seem to be horribly fattening.

review/summary: Want Chick Peas With Your Blueberries?
review/text: I bought these hoping they'd taste like Nutra-Grain bars.  They didn't.  The key here is that these bars have Chick Pea flour in them.  You know, garbanzo beans?!  The outer texture is dry and crumbly.  The inside, which they say is "blueberry" is actually mostly apple and raisin with some blueberries thrown in.  A very small blueberry taste here and very little filling for the amount of breading (chick pea) it has.  Nasty taste initially.  Who wants chick peas with their blueberries (or apples or raisins for that matter)?!  Certainly not me.  The after taste is what really got me.  It was like I'd just eaten plain mashed chick peas.  Oh disgust!  Had one for a snack at work and wound up bumming some altoids from a co-worker to get rid of the taste.  Just plain nasty!!!  Will not buy again!  Guess I'm still searching for a gluten free alternative for those Nutra-Grain bars.  Gave two stars instead of one because I could made myself choke it down.  Gluten-free foods aren't always choke downable even.

review/summary: Gluten free bars-it is what it is
review/text: My 2 year old likes these bars but doesn't love them. She eats them but not all at once which says to me they are just ok. But, when her older brother is eating a regular cereal bar, at least these look similar. I've tried them and they are ok.

review/summary: Fruit filling is okay BUT breading is pretty nasty!
review/text: I bought three flavors of these Glutino gluten free cereal bars to try and replace the Nutri-Grain cereal bars my 8 year-old used to love to eat before his Celiacs diagnosis. Bottom line - These bars are pretty nasty!  Even though my son understandably rejected them, I honestly tried to give all three a chance.  The blueberry, strawberry and cherry filling taste okay (except for being much "tart-er" than the filling in the Nutri-Grain bars our family was used to eating) BUT the breading - YIKES let me put it this way - it is exactly the texture and taste of what I would imagine SAWDUST tasting like!  I am NOT A PICKY EATER and I am trying not to throw these away and save the $15(for 3 boxes)I spent on them from going down the drain but I HONESTLY CAN BARELY GET THESE DOWN!

review/summary: Poor taste
review/text: I was surprised that these were flavored so poorly when so many gluten free foods are delicious. There's a bitter aftertaste (and during taste). I was hoping this would satisfy my craving for something small that was sweet and cake like, but the flavor is really unpleasant. It's kind of like blueberry medicine. I can't make myself eat the rest of the box.

review/text: I am on a gluten-free diet, and generally I like Glutino brand foods.  However, these breakfast bars are truly horrible.  I even passed them out to 4 other co-workers who after a few seconds of chewing spit them out.  If this is my only option for a breakfast bar, then I will just have to find something else to eat.  Yuck!

review/text: While I have been a big fan of Glutino products, they failed miserably with this item. The chocolate ones are even worse tasting. Not even dunked in coffee makes them palitable. These were by far the most DISCUSTING foul tasting GF product I have ever tried. I could not get rid of the horrible aftertaste that was inbedded into my tongue. Gross. Even if they tasted good they would be way over priced. Save your money and avoid these!

review/summary: Pretty bad
review/text: I've found that most Glutino products taste quite good. However, I was very disappointed in the breakfast bars. I tried the apple and the blueberry. They both have kind of a bitter taste and you can hardly taste the fruit. They are edible but not very enjoyable. Some folks might feel differently about the taste but, if I were you, I would try one box from a health food store, before I ordered boxes and boxes of them from Amazon.

review/summary: Only if really, really hungry
review/text: I was introduced to these bars at a celiac conference, and later bought a box at a health food store. They are gluten free and they travel well. On the down side, they aren't good and I don't enjoy eating them. I will take them in my purse if I have nothing else, but I only eat them when really, really hungry and there are no other options around.<br /><br />I much prefer the gluten free lara bars for flavor. These may however be good for those with complex dietary restrictions like Celiac combined with diabetes. But- I wouldn't buy them again.

review/text: For one thing, it seems that food companies seem to be under the impression that everybody who is allergic to gluten is also rich.  Insanely pricey- it MIGHT be worth it if they tasted like anything other than chalk.  There are MUCH better gluten/wheat free bars out there that are much more worthy of your $.  These have such an aftertaste.  Blueberry flavor is the lesser of the evils, though.  Save the chocolate flavor for somebody you have a score to settle with.

review/summary: EEYECH!  Zero stars is right! Non-food item
review/text: I may not agree with the institutionalization idea, but I am absolutely astounded that anyone can like these things.  Zero blueberry flavor --I couldn't even detect a figgy flavor, I can't imagine where others got that-- they are dry, sandy, nearly tasteless, & what little taste they have is awful.  I can't believe I spent so much money on these things...I guess the whole case is going into the compost pile; I wouldn't even offer these to the dog!<br />Added note: I did offer them to a friend (hmm....) along with a suitable warning.  He insisted he could eat anything and enjoy it.  He later said it was the only food item he ever spat out, & when he tried it the next day (just in case; he really wanted free food), he spat it out again.  If this guy won't eat it, I can't believe ANYONE would.

review/summary: deeeelicious
review/text: I make my own bbq sauce every couple months and usually throw in a bunch of habaneros, or a couple ghost peppers if I have them. I also have a really hard time not buying a bottle of hot sauce I haven't tried before. Back in June I stumbled across a small store that sold Cajohns scorpion hot sauce, and I really liked it a lot. It's definitely not as hot as most ghost pepper sauces, but doesn't have that bitter ghost pepper sauce taste.<br />So when my family went on vacation last week to DE I snuck off one morning to a store that sells only hot sauces. I left with 5 different bottles of hot sauce, and one bottle of this bbq sauce. I should have just bought 6 bottles of this. It's great! Has a good smoky taste and just enough heat for me. It's a little too hot for my wife, but she doesn't have any tolerance at all. Great on anything, I even dip pizza crust in it. Would definitely recommend it for fans of hot sauce.

review/text: The main reason I wanted to get this tea set was for the box and not necessarily for the tea.  I have been looking for a nice tea box for my wife to match our cherry cabinets.  Surprisingly, it is a lot harder finding a nice quality box with a window.<br /><br />Again to reiterate, I have not tried the tea so I will not comment on that.  The box however is very poorly built.  The picture is a lot nicer than what we received.  There is no way I could give this to my wife as a gift.  The inside compartments were bent and it looks like someone from elementary school pasted the inside lining because the felt was crooked and did not even cover the entire inside of the box.  The stain outside was uneven, especially at the lip where you are suppose to open the box.<br /><br />I had originally bought this because I saw a 5 star rating for this product.  Even though ratings are subjective, this product is far from a 5 star rating.

review/summary: A Mixed bag, so to speak
review/text: A longer review than I would usually write for food but since there's 4 different items, I address the set as a whole and each of the different snacks/cookies.<br /><br />Warning for allergy eaters: This is on the back of the box in small print "Contains Milk, Wheat, Soy, processed in a facility that uses eggs, peanuts, and tree nuts".<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />*I am thrilled to have had the opportunity to get a variety pack since I had never tried her packaged snacks and small enough that if you don't like them or get allergic to something, you don't have a whole lot to give away and feel you wasted alot of money.<br /><br />*CHEESE STRAWS are the second biggest pro but I would like to buy them on their own in a larger package in the future.<br /><br />* CHEESE STRAWS stay crunchy, taste great, no aftertaste<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />Okay, this may seem like a contradiction because I love that I can get a small variety pack in order to try something out - if I got a full box, it would be plenty but once you open the box and then open the little bag stuffed in the bottom, you barely get anything in each package.  No offense but what a waste of a beautiful package/box for less than two servings of a snack.  If you eat a couple here and a couple there (of cheese straws) you could make the package last two days.  If there's two people having two here and two there, and they have complete self control and are very conscious of limiting your portion sizes (people who have the ability to eat 4 potato chips and not go back until tomorrow) I'd give it an hour, or less. For me, the cheese straws lasted an hour - I put them away three times. There's certainly not enough to put in a little nut size bowl and set it out on the coffee table if you are having a couple people over.  This is literally a sample packet put into a box that's made to look like you are getting a full box of treats.<br /><br />One open box is 7" tall and 3 1/2" wide.  Inside the box is a gold bag that is about 5"x4 1/2".  But the contents of the bag is 4 1/2" wide and only 2" tall.  For the cookies, because they are so sweet/strong you can make them last a few days, and they are tiny (size of a quarter for the pineapple cookies), so just a few will do for the chocolate cookies and pineapple cookies. But still, nowhere near putting them in a nut-size small bowl unless you combine them all.<br /><br /> *All snacks except for the cheese straws, change texture in less than 5 minutes of being open.  Immediately transfer to a tightly closed ziploc or tight lidded "tupperware" type container.  They all are crunchy when opened but after a couple of minutes, the pineapple and the shortbread go from firm , crunchy pecan sandies to falling apart crumbly and can't hold the cookie as a solid piece, the Chocolate marsh go from solid crunchy to a stale chewy texture.  The texture changed before I put them away the very first time and each time I only had a couple cookies and decided to put them away but the texture already changed dramatically.<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br /><br />CHEESE STRAWS -<br />If you've had Paula Deen's Macaroni and Cheese - which I was able to find online - and you like it, the Cheese Straws taste very much like the Macaroni and Cheese.  It has a strong Cheddar flavor but not quite "Sharp cheddar" or "mild cheddar", more like a medium with a stronger taste than medium.  It also seems like it is a multi cheese, but I don't know what other cheese is in it. I ate them and tossed the box the night I got them.  They look like crinkle fries, fatter than my pinky,crunchy when opened and they stay that way-while I had them out and each time I went back for more,still crunchy and very good.  No funky after taste (like two others).<br /><br />PINEAPPLE DROP COOKIES - Quarter size, very very strong pineapple taste, with a very very sweet powdered sugar on top that tastes like it has pineapple (or something?) flavoring too.  Bitter after taste, way too strong, crunchy in a "pecan sandies" like texture, unless they are out for a couple minutes, then they crumble.  I had two cookies with a few minutes in between because it was so very strong I didn't know if I really wanted another one.  When I reached in the tiny bag for the second cookie, they were already crumbly.  I couldn't have a 3rd and instead gave them away - they were just terrible, although I usually love pineapple, love sandies type cookies, and love powdered sugar.  But there was nothing good about these.<br /><br />COCONUT PECAN BARS - about 2" long rounded top rectangle, they were mostly broken but that was okay.  These too are like a "pecan sandies" texture to start with, good crunch, but does turn soft and crumbly very quickly. The initial flavor is very good, like a powdered sugar covered pecan sandy with a hint of coconut flavor and obvious pieces of coconut once you chew the cookie, and pecan flavor, but very little in the way of tiny pecan pieces.  The main problem is the awful after taste that lasted way too long-not bitter like the pineapple but just as funky. Worse than that is that the after taste isn't recognizable. It isn't coconut, isn't pecan, it's what I usually call "chemically" because it's not a food flavor. Even strong coffee didn't get rid of it. But I did have four of them before tossing the other 6-8 cookies in the trash.  First 2 were the original texture and the last two fell apart in my hand, like a handful of sand with some coconut.  Literally, not 3 minutes after the first two I ate, the last two were like a totally different cookie, could not hold itself together and the sandies crunch was gone replaced by crumbled ingredients that made the shredded coconut much more obvious (not bad if you like coconut, which I do)but no longer a cookie, more a pile of crumbs. But the after taste is a product killer, I just couldn't have any more.<br /><br />CHOCOLATE MARSH MUD COOKIES-  The best sweet in the assortment.  Round quarter size, sweet enough that you only need a few but not so sweet that you don't want more.  Not mild like milk chocolate, more like bitter-sweet chocolate chips type flavor or cocoa powder.  Except for the bizarre texture change, they were good and I ate them all over a few days.  There's not that many, they are small like the pineapple cookies but chocolatey enough that I couldn't just eat the little bag in one or two sittings.  Unfortunately, I did not enjoy them quite as much two hours later when I went to have another two cookies because they had a chewy/stale texture-not chewy out of the oven, but chewy/stale/rubbery and even though they were folded over twice with the sides tucked in, clamped closed with a mini binder clip, and back in the closed box, the texture still morphed - that's just weird to me.  Next day out of a ziploc, still chewy but didn't get worse.  They were still an actual cookie and held together to be eaten like a cookie (well, it's bite-size so it's not like you're going to take a bite anyway, it's too small for that but it's not a pile of crumbs like the other two, but if they were a normal size cookie, they could be bitten into without losing the entire cookie.  Anyway, although it was totally weird, like nothing I've ever seen before, this morphing texture thing that is almost immediate, I still ate the rest of the Chocolate Mud Cookies.  But, I wouldn't buy them again.  They weren't good enough to ignore the texture thing and $5 a box for less than a nut bowl's worth of cookies (they are sold here-- 4 boxes, 3 oz each, same as this set for $19current price-$24 regular price)that's just a ridiculous price for the amount of product, especially considering the quality as a whole.  Sorry Paula Deen, the cookies in this set are just not quality products and 3 oz is much less than you could ever think.  Sadly, the one and only decent product that I would buy again from this sample is the Cheese Straws and it is THE ONLY PRODUCT IN THIS SET THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE ON ITS OWN.  That's a shame because I would buy them today.

review/summary: Yummy Coconut Pecan Bars by Paula Deen!
review/text: I think these bars are absolutely delicious. Somebody spoke of an aftertaste, but I don't get why that's a problem when you love the taste and don't want it to leave! To me, it leaved too quickly, and off I am to another one :) Its coconut flavor stays with you for just a little while, and I can't get enough. I like the texture as well, which is crumbly and remind me of some fancy cookies I had in France once. I want more! I bought these for $4.99 and I will be buying more.

review/summary: The pictured product contains 100 tea bags; I received a box containing only 20 tea bags
review/text: If you receive 100 tea bags after paying this incredibly low price (I paid less than $4.50 and qualified for Super Saver Shipping), then you've done very well.  I received a box of Prince of Peace 100% Organic Green Tea that contains only 20 tea bags.  In scientific studies, people who drink green tea have relatively healthy bones.  People who drink cow's milk have relatively unhealthy bones despite the fact that the calcium, the protein, and the vitamin D in cow's milk probably helped their bones!  Amazon has been so generous with me on other orders that I've decided not to bother them.  I won't contact them to send me 80 more tea bags.  The only disadvantage of buying this product is that if you are unlucky and one of the twenty tea bags is leaking, you will need to use your fingers to brush off several specks of green tea leaf fragments resting on the outside of the paper pouch enclosing each tea bag.

review/summary: Made a mistake on the ad
review/text: I also ordered this product because they claimed 100 bags for around $5 a box, thought it was too good to be true because I only received a box of 20 bags. At least the corrected the price.

review/summary: Good for the dog
review/text: My Dalmatian mix has severe skin allergies. This food has helped reduce her problems by about 50%. Fewer visits to the vet and less scratching at home.<br /><br />I have been using Wysong products for about 5 years. They make a quality product at a reasonable price.

review/summary: Allergenic Dog Food?
review/text: This kibble has been the staple diet of my 80 lb Great Dane Mix (named Kobe) for the past year. He came to me two years ago from a rescue group who transports black dogs from the southern U.S, where black dogs have a very high kill rate, to the nortern U.S. to be adopted. He was about 5 yrs old at the time I adopted him, sight unseen, from Arkansas.  Severe alleries were included among the miriad of issues that afflicted him. This manifested itself in runny eyes, full body skin yeast infection resulting in what the vet termed "elephant skin" on his abdomen, throat, elbows, and haunches.  Also bald spots over his neck, throat, thighs, and toes from constant scratching and biting at himself. In many places the "elepant skin" was perpetually split/cracked, infected, and bleeding.  After treating the bacterial and yeast infections with both topical and oral agents which did clear up the bacteria but left the yeast as a chronic secondary infection of the allergies, I searched for other remedies.  Along with seasonal, environmental, and other allergies to dust, fabrics, vegitation, etc. I also found a lot of good information about food allergies.<br />Taking this information into consideration I scouted around for an "allergenic" kibble that was made by a company that has never had a recall, does not do animal testing, provides appropriate nutrition, and is somewhat affordable. Wysong seemed to fit the bill. Anergen has been a key part of Kobe's allergy treatment program for the past year.  Along with "therapeutic baths", Ketokonazole lotions, hydrocortisone lotions, diligent laundering of doggie coats/bedding/linens (no wool), and oral antihistamines Kobe's skin is soft and smooth without splits/cracks/infection; his bald spots have shrunk to half the size; and his eyes only run occasionally.  He still does scratch and bite at himself intermittently. I notice this usually happens when I deviate from the Anergen diet, giving him rawhide chews, beef bones with marrow, or cookies (organic) with mixed ingredients.<br />I don't really know what else, short of steroids, can be done to help him. I have avoided steroids due to their own detrimental health effects. Anergen seems to be the food solution to his allergies, which is a good thing! I add water to the kibble and let it sit about 10 minutes to form a kind of "gravy".  He likes this better than the straight dry kibble and it also helps to keep him hydrated.<br />Note: My other dog, a 9yr old husky-shepard mix eats Wysong Maintenance and is strong and svelt; and the cats eat Wysong Uretic.

review/summary: Deters cat from overeating
review/text: Okay, so my cat doesn't like this alone BUT when I mix it with her other food it stops her from overeating/eating too fast and vomiting her food.  I'm all for it because of that.  No more messes on the floor after she eats too fast.
