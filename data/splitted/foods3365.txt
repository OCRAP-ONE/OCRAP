review/summary: Excellent chips!  Wish they came in dark.
review/text: These are the best allergen friendly chips out there.  I like how little they are.  Makes it much easier to get chocolate flavor in each bite when you bake with them.  I have actually never seen them for sale on Amazon, just listed here.  I await the time to actually buy them here!  I will guess it to be a wonderful price compared to my local grocery.

review/summary: Thank Goodness for these chips!
review/text: When you're cutting out Dairy AND Soy, you're really limited to what you can eat. . . especially chocolate and baked goods.  These chips have a wonderful flavor and satisfy my chocolate cravings even if I just eat them right out of the bag.  Don't be shy, buy a case!!  You can make peanut butter cups, CC cookies, CC pancakes. . .YUMMY!

review/summary: The BEST chips ever and so versatile!
review/text: The chips themselves are very tiny -- even smaller than standard mini chips, I think. At first that took a little getting used to, but that also makes them quite versatile for tossing in to recipes where you just want a hint of chocolate, baking oatmeal-chocolate chip cookies, snacking right out of the bag, and for melting very quickly in the microwave when needed (perfect for a quick dipping fondue, or mixing the melted chips with just a touch of oil and then swirling a few dollops of sunbutter and eating when cooled/hardened).<br /><br />Although I started buying these chips a couple of years ago due to one family member's multiple food allergies, everyone in the family totally loves these chips and I would still buy them even if there were no food allergy issues: we all like them that much.

review/summary: chocolate chips are great!
review/text: I love this product. I originally bought it for my daughter who has issues with both milk and soy. This works great in recipes and they taste great!! They taste better than regular chocolate chips that you buy in stores! I would certainly recommend. I just wish I could find them easier with cheaper shipping. It gets expensive to buy these all the time. I try to only stock up on these chocolate chips when it's cold. That way they don't melt during shipping and I make them last longer until I can buy them next.

review/summary: Great Chocolate Chips
review/text: These are my favorite chocolate chips. They are really amazing and it is nice that they are more "natural" than others. Being free of many common allergens is also great and I wish mainstream food producers would reevaluate the many substances they put in our food, often in the name of higher profits. Maybe you agree with this, maybe you don't, but these chips speak for themselves when you taste them. Do yourself a favor, eat more raw foods, give up meat, drink young coconut water (available on Amazon), eat steel cut oats, exercise daily, don't go near a television or the Internet (except for Amazon.com), spend lots of time outdoors, treat animals with reverence and eat cookies made with these chips. The rest comes easy...

review/summary: Awesome vegan chocolate chips, but price fluctuates
review/text: The price fluctuates widely on these things. From $21.65 (Eligible for Super Saver Shipping) to $29.99 (+ about $6.30 shipping), and higher, depending on whether Amazon has it in stock. I've seen it hit the low price 3 times (when I've been looking), but I'm not sure on the timing. Anyway, I can get Ghirardelli Semi-Sweet Chocolate Baking Chips, which are also vegan and less in fat but also have soy lecithin and vanilla and are bigger, from my local supermarket for a cheaper price per ounce than even the low price of these Enjoy Life ones here.<br /><br />My original review:<br />I love these things. I love that the ingredients are so simple. They are delicious and cruelty-free. I have mainly used them for vegan brownies (my daily dose of chocolate!). And the price is right ($21.65 for 60 oz, beats my health food store). Highly recommended for vegans and non-vegans alike.<br />One con: on my bags, the serving size is in grams. FYI- I measured and one bag is almost exactly seven 1/4 cups (which has 40% of your daily saturated fat, I did the math).

review/summary: No soy. For eating, good, but baked fell short
review/text: The title says it all for me. I wanted these for baking! If they don't tell you, or you couldn't tell from the photo, these are MINI-CHOCOLATE CHIPS! My bags didn't have the words "Mini Chips", and no picture, so the manufacturer is in the process of learning/updating. They taste good/fine/chocolately when you eat them out of the bag. But, when you bake them into cookies, be prepared to make a smaller batch(use less flour, etc.), or use more than one bag! I was REALLY disappointed! I couldn't taste them at all! Because of how they tasted in hand, I thought they would be fine, but most recipes call for 2 cups chocolate chips = 1 bag of chocolate chips. Those are 12 oz bags. These are 10 oz bags.  Who measures?? Well, I didn't measure. I think if I had used maybe 1 1/2 to 2 bags it might of been okay.<br /><br />Okay, so I didn't react soy-wise, but.... what's the good of being rid of the reactive element if you get rid of the flavor and enjoyment at the same time?! I might as  well done plain cookies in that case! Or shortbread, then I wouldn't of expected chocolate-chip flavor, ya know?!?<br /><br />If you can find the "right" bag of Dagoba (Organic Chocolate) Chocodrops 73% cacao content, in the baking section, read the label [one bag HAD soy lecithin; the other one from another store didn't-of course I bought it, and they really didn't have the soy lecithin, how odd. April 2011], they are a much better choice, choco chip size-wise. The Dagoba's were an accident find. Unfortunately, these are only 8 oz. (not 12), but the flavor stands up to the baking. You probably want to add vanilla to complement. * I got mine from Whole Food's Market. This isn't something you typically find at Safeway or Lucky's Market, FYI.<br /><br />I will make it a point to re-bake using two bags and see what happens and add a comment

review/text: In all the places I ever lived in I found Maggi in the Supermarkets except the last one, the one where I live now, somewhat out of the way I might add.  So I searched for it online and found it on your website. Imagine how very happy I was. I thought I might now have to live without it. IMPOSSIBLE! I am now 76 years old and used it for all of my life. So has my mother who lived in Germany all of her life and so have I in my younger years. It's wonderful that you carry "Maggi". Thank you so much for your prompt delivery of my order. My very best regards to you all and have a lovely day.<br />Lorraine Alexander.

review/summary: Convenient, delicious, and long shelf life
review/text: We've used Yoder's canned bacon for several years - mainly for the times when company comes and I don't have fresh bacon handy.  We keep a case of it for emergencies too.  There's no reason to do without favorites like bacon just because the power is out.  They're great to toss in a backpack for camping, and people are often amazed to see that bacon comes in cans.<br /><br />There are about 50 slices in each can, cooked and ready to eat(we like our crispy, this is more limp), rolled up in paper.  The cans will last a decade if kept at normal home temperatures.  We pull out the paper and unroll it, then finish crisping up the bacon in a frying pan.  It gives off just enough grease to fry eggs, which is great for camping.  You can also soak the can in hot water to ease the paper/bacon out of the can.<br /><br />There's a lot of arguing in the reviews about the pricing of this bacon, but I consider it a good value.  Each can contains several pounds (pre-cooked) of bacon, and currently bacon is around $4 per pound at the grocery.  Plus being able to store it on a shelf and even eat it right out of the can makes it worth the extra cost.<br /><br />This canned bacon is a really useful product that we don't ever plan to do without.

review/text: I have also found this cheaper elsewhere (I'm an Amazon Prime member and buy more from Amazon than from any other retailer but even I know to Google around and comparison shop because Amazon is not always the least expensive source).  Now as for the product itself, at least a quarter of the cans in the case came dented but they were all still sealed well.  I opened the most badly dented can to test the product and the bacon was wonderful. It is rather thinly sliced, which we like, and partially cooked so finishing it off in the oven (our favorite method) or microwave took very little time.  It was absolutely delicious and no one could tell it had come out of a can.  I was amazed at how many slices of bacon there were in that one can!  This is a must-have for every emergency food pantry or camping trip food supply.  I will definitely be buying more and may even start canning my own one of these days.

I'm not sure if it does this for me; however, it certainly is refreshing. My husband likes it too, and his tastes are away from healthy-type drinks, preferring high fructose corn syrup sweetened juices and aspartame (which he adds to Ginkgo IQ Tea) sweetened sodas; still he will drink this tea, which is saying something.<br /><br />I am impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Ginkgo IQ Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea is another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site, yogitea.com, is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />The ingredients in this herbal teasan are: organic ginkgo leaf, organic ginkgo leaf extract, organic rhodiola rosea extract, and 14 additional organic herbs. It also contains organic lemon flavor and ascorbic acid. Altogether, the tea is 98% organic.<br /><br />Highly recommended, especially as an alternative to caffeine.<br />*****

review/summary: great taste, hoping for just as great results
review/text: This product tastes AMAZING and somewhat sweet, naturally. Seems to have plenty of ingredients that health reviews agree are supposed to be good for what this tea is claiming to do - enhance the function of your mind and memory. I suffer from terrible memory, and while it is too early to tell, i am going to continue drinking this (alternating with Brain Booster tea) for the next 3-6 months, as it definitely cannot hurt, and if nothing else, is delicious. I will try to update after 3-6 months.

review/summary: Makes for a nice cup of tea
review/text: I have tried probably every tea by Yogi and this one is as good as any other. Yogi Teas are just good! However, don't buy if you can't stand that licorice-sweet taste typical to the brand. Also, do not expect this tea to work wonders on the brain as other Chinese Ginkgo teas seem to do a bit more effectively. It's a nice drink-during-the-day-while you're at work...but try to buy just one box before going all out on 6 pakages if this is your first time buying it.

review/summary: Quite a pick-up ... may be caffeine-free but is not stimulant-free
review/text: This is an excellent tea. The taste is a tad strong - while I quite like it, others may find a touch of honey helps greatly. Also provides a strong pick-up, similar to a cup of coffee in my experience. It is also a good enough tea to get two 12 oz cups out of one bag (the second slightly weaker but still flavorful).<br /><br />I should note, unless the box has changed from the product in my pantry, there is no mention of being caffeine-free. It certainly is not free of stimulants - licorice root having a dilatory effect, and gotu kola being a circulatory system stimulant. If you have a sensitivity to caffeine you may wish to try one of Yogi's rooibus products instead. I've never been dissatisfied with Yogi tea but it's good to be aware of potential sensitivities.

I have never used these seeds before so I can't even tell if it's the right thing in the package.  The same Amazon vendor ("SimplyBeautiful") offers six 7-ounce packages of this product for $14.98.<br /><br />I ain't happy.  I never want to order from these "SimplyBeautiful" stinkers again. My advice to others: don't trust "SimplyBeautiful", don't trust their products.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I got a refund on this purchase.  Still think the stuff tastes like nasty medicine, which may be what some want (long history as herbal cure-all) but not me.  Still don't want to deal with "SimplyBeautiful" again.

review/summary: Good Tasting, Better than most
review/text: I usually make my own GF pizza crust, but I decided to try this when I saw the ingredients were very close to my own. I pre-cooked the crust for 10 minutes as stated on the box, but I made one large pizza instead of 2-12" pizzas, and it was a little underdone. I would cook it 2-3 minutes longer if making one pizza. When it was done, the crust was a little soft and we had to mostly use a fork, but it had a<br />really good taste, very comparable to my own, and it was quicker to make.It also had a good texture.  I'll definitely buy this again. As for the stickiness, spoon it on the greased cookie sheet and use cornstarch or tapioca starch and keep coating your fingers to press it<br />out. It worked fine that way.

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: Like many coffee drinkers, I'm very particular about coffee and try a lot of different ones even though I already have favorites. Archer Farms is a Target brand and generally I do not suppose people associate Target with great coffee, but I shop at Target a lot and one day I just decided to try a few of the Archer Farm brands.<br /><br />I tried the Colombian, Mexican, Vanilla and didn't really care for any of those, but I was really blown away by their Kona blend. It's a fairly light and creamy blend (there are two one star reviews here but I think they are in the wrong place because they seem to have reviewed beans, whereas this product is clearly marked as ground.) Excellent body and flavor. I like it so much that right now it's one of my mainstays and I'll have at least a cup of this a day.<br /><br />I've tried to find more information about the blend, such as what the % of Kona beans it has but Archer Farms or Target doesn't supply a lot of information (a minimum of 10% Kona is required for a Kona blend). No matter what, this is just a very, very nice light roast coffee and I really recommend it.

review/text: I wish I had read the previous review before buying this coffee. Despite the "Light Roast" label on the bag, this coffee is in fact a VERY dark roast! Beans are covered in oil, and taste very burnt. Dark roasting completely destroys any flavors that the Kona beans would have added to this blend, and it ends up tasting like any other nasty $tarbucks blend. Avoid!

Yet, it's surprisingly healthy and not too sweet.  The fat/sugar content is comparable to most other granolas.<br /><br />I've tried numerous granola's over the years, and this one is special.  Probably not the most nutritious granola overall, but it's definitely a treat for the tastebuds and a welcome relief from ordinary granolas.<br /><br />I would not have this as my exclusive source of granola, but I will buy this many more times in the future to satisfy my chocoholic cravings.  In fact, I will probably always keep this product handy because it's highly satisfying.<br /><br />Great for a breakfast, snack or dessert.  Yummy!

review/summary: Holy Granola Batman!
review/text: By itself,in the morning,this would probably be too much chocolate. Cut it with another granola,making a 50% mixture.(Bear Naked brand granola is an excellent chice for the other half of the mix)  Throw some raisins or chopped dates on top,then pour a fair amount of milk over the entire mix. The granola is very crunchy,as it should be,so let the milk saturate the granola a little longer than you would for a 'conventional' cereal. That way,when the granola is gone,the milk has a bit of a chocolate taste and makes for a good tasting final "slurp". This granola is very fresh so the extra soak time with the milk will not result in any sogginess. Note: Do not attempt to eat this in a hurry since the original crunchy texture will not breakdown quickly. So, sit back,enjoy the early part of the day and munch on!

review/summary: Dry granola !!!!
review/text: Granola was very dry and not too sweet.  Need milk.  I prefer Costco's granola -- it taste much better.  I would not recommend the purchase of this product.  Now I got to find way to get rid of the other 5 packages.  Also bought the fruit and nut one.  Hope that's better.

review/summary: Is this really a Bravo bully stick
review/text: I gave my dog a Bravo bully stick today and he just threw it up after much gagging etc. It's not like any Bravo stick I've ever seen. He threw up big pieces that looked like they were finely cut with a sharp knife. Almost as if it were knife cut segments that were glued together.This should not happen with a Bravo stick. I will never buy a bully stick from this retailer at Amazon again. I question if this really is a Bravo product. It does not appear to be natural. After 8 hrs in his stomach it is totally undigested.

review/summary: Lovely color, great to work with
review/text: The most important thing (to me at least) is that the color of this gold is great.  It may look greenish in the bottle, but on icing or fondant it has a nice warm color, not too yellow, not brassy, just really nice.<br /><br />I also like the different effects you can get through layering.  One coat produces a pearly gold shimmer, sort of like an Art Noveau enameled brooch. 2 + coats will get you a bolder solid gold look.  It's not going to come out like polished metal, but the effect is still VERY pretty and impressive.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this paint for writing or drawing on icing or fondant (you have to stroke over it repeatedly to produce crisp lines), but it's GREAT for "highlighting" raised areas and adding a beautiful something extra.

review/summary: Is this a joke? If I could give it a 0, I would.
review/text: First of all, I am aware that this is made for the gun, however after reading the reviews I purchased it and let me say I have never been more dissapointed. In the picture the gold is brilliant, bold, and intense. When I got this product it was oily in appearance and looked like vinegar in color. I used a paintbrush as I read in a previous review. The color is a yellow, maybe a copper tone---nothing like gold. I used part of this for an anniversary cake--I had to drive to the arts and crafts store to purchase Wiltons Gold shimmer to attempt to cover this disaster. I thought $15 was pretty expensive in the first place, but after using the product I am sure it is not worth a single cent. I cannot believe how grotesque this color is. If I wanted a copper/yellow tone I would have just used edible dye---I sure would have saved the money for something else. I bake hundreds of cakes each year, and I am confident to say that this is the worst item I have ever used. Garbage. I have another bottle that should be arriving in the mail in a couple days for the silver color, I will be sending it right back and getting my money back for sure!

Water is listed as the first ingredient, then "smoked herring 40%," followed by cuttlefish, salt, potato starch, and other ingredients. It would be useful if the online descriptions were at least as clear as the labels.

review/summary: Be leary of giving these ingredients to your dog!
review/text: I have studied canine nutrition for the last 5 years and one of the biggest negatives I see in many commercial dog food companies is putting profit over care.<br /><br />In looking at ingredients in treats and food, many companies are fabulous. However, sadly, some put the cheapest ingredients that often even cause negative reactions in dogs into their products and then add flavors to make the dog want them so they continue to be bought.<br /><br />Ah, but don't take my word for it.<br /><br />First ingredient in these? Rice Flour. Not meat. Not whole wheat flour. Not brown rice flour. Rice flour...bad carb, no protein, breaks down into sugar. But it gets better. Second main ingredient? SUGAR.<br /><br />Let me repeat that. This contains mostly sugar.<br /><br />Yes they are shaped like bones and you feel like you are getting some good protein in and that they aren't like giving your pet hard candy. Naw. That's marketing. They only contain 7% protein and the protein source is derived from "dried meat by product". In other words, meat waste.<br /><br />But lets go back to sugar. You could give your dog a tablespoon of sugar each day and they would crave that too. But you will also have to pay for extra tartar scrapings from your vet which are stressful to your canine companion or have a pet lose their teeth in their later years.<br /><br />But I'm just getting started. 3rd ingredient? Wheat flour. Not whole wheat flour...processed and stripped of it's nutriotional value. Cheaper. And of no nutritional value. Cheap.<br /><br />So you think the fourth ingredient must be some protein huh? Naw, it's Propylene Glycol.<br /><br />Then powdered cellulose<br /><br />Then sodium caseinate<br /><br />but we dont want our dogs to thumb their paws up at such ingredients so natural poultry FLAVOR is then added. This is what some dog companies do, besides adding sugar, to make a product marketable...have it TASTE to the dog like it has something they need or want in it but it just be a flavoring. Then they beg for it and owners think it's great, buy more, and profit is good.<br /><br />BAD.<br /><br />Now then, let me sum this up with the warning under the feeding guide:<br />"Up to (meaning no more than) 5 sticks every week"<br />and "not suitable for puppies or dogs under 5 lbs." Yet the jumbone mini with a yorkie on the front has these ingredients and then says not to give it to small dogs! That is called a legal disclaimer should your dog develop issues from the feeding of this product. What more needs to be said?<br /><br />Yeah, you don't have those warnings about nutritional harm when you just feed your dog some good natural treats or meat.<br /><br />Animal crackers or saltwater taffy would offer your dog the same taste and ingredients for the most part as these and be cheaper.<br /><br />I take it back. The above two wouldn't have as many artificial flavors and preservatives.<br /><br />Don't buy into the hype "big meaty center"<br /><br />If by "meaty" they mean 'sugar and cellulse" then I agree...<br /><br />I so hate seeing profit over care for companion animals.<br /><br />Why did I give it 1 star? I had no choice, but afterall, If you have to go by will your dog like it? You bet! But they like chocolate too...doesn't mean they should eat it.<br /><br />I am not promoting any particular dog food or treat here...just giving my opinion (based on 5 years of study on the subject on my part) that you may wish to avoid sugar and cheap fillers for anything going into your pet. Animals are so little and dependant upon our choices for them. And, especially if you dont brush their teeth daily as most of us don't, giving them something filled with sugar and bad-carb flours is highly detrimental to thier livers, teeth, livers, kidneys, and full canine systems.<br /><br />Not to mention the artificial fillers and dried meat by products. Meat waste can have very bad things in it. It's not suitable for human consumption (these include the parts thrown away that may be diseased or tumerous. Yes, seriously, these ARE allowed to be used in dog food.)<br /><br />And don't even consider the vitamins added. When made into a processed dog food of this type, they get baked out at such high temperatures used in the processing. So consider that teeninsy bit added at the very end of the ingredient list null and void after processing.<br /><br />Buy em a real soup bone or give them carrots or NATURAL wet dog food or cottage cheese for a treat.<br /><br />Dogs don't do well on things like this and it can cost you more in their health than the savings on buying a less expensive brand.<br /><br />I love em (pets) too much not to review this honestly...

review/text: The first review was more than critical, it was hysterical, biased by what the writer perceives as science as he has learned it. This amazon comment section is not the forum to discuss all his comments -- the length of my rebuttal (and queries) would consume more space than is appropriate to this site. Jumbone is a fine product and is generally of high quality. It is a treat, not a food substitute, and it does stimulate some dogs to chew who might not otherwise. It's nonsense to list all those items categorically as "bad." I'm not employed by any company connected with Jumbone, and I don't have any interest in the product other than it keeps my dog healthy and happy. Give us break, will ya?

I came onto Amazon and on a whim just to see if I could something at least close  to this tea. It was such a surprize when I saw this tea at the top of the search results list. I bought this tea as part of a Christmas gift for my husband, he is missing Kenya and his family there very much. I hope this will bring Kenya to him in small way. I really can't wait to see his face when he unwraps it on Christmas! It only took a few days to receive the tea. The package was well packed so there are no dents or breaks in the box. I am very happy with this purchase, and I can't wait to sit and have a cup with my husband like we did every morning in Kenya! :) I very much recommend this tea to any tea drinker. The shping and handling was almost as much as it costs for the tea, but well worth it!!

Retreiving the bag required using a spoon or other devise.<br />Athough the tea tastes good, I am not happy with the packaging, or lack thereof of the present Ketepa product.

I am so glad to be able to buy them on Amazon. Now I can drink Ketepa Pride tea whenever I want, and I always think about my friends from Kenya when I do. These teabags have tags and strings on them, so they are easy to use and dispose of (the export pack my friend gave me were teabags only, without the strings). The tea has a round, black tea taste that is similar to Bromley tea. I am so grateful to Amazon for bringing Kenya to me right here in NJ!

review/summary: Learned to love this in Kenya
review/text: We lived in Kenya for years and this is the very brand I bought there.  We have driven past the factory where this is produced in Kericho many times.  Mild but never bitter, even when I forget and leave the tea bag in the mug for a long time, but also has plenty of flavor.  Even my friend has started ordering it. This is a very good price when you consider that it's imported.  Probably won't be in envelopes even when the box says it is.  It's coming from Africa and vendors have to take what they can get.

review/text: My sister brought me a box of this tea after a missions trip to Kenya. This is exactly the way tea should taste. The word that initially comes to mind is "smooth," but I'm not sure how helpful that is. It's spoiled me for all other tea, and I actually started trying to convince my sister to go into full-time missions work and bring me home a suitcase full. Then I remembered......the internet! I've been saved from a lifetime of disappointing tea!

review/summary: LOVE this tea!
review/text: My husband and I visited Kenya a couple of months ago.  I love tea, so I took advantage of being there and tried a bunch of different kinds of tea in our hotel.  This is by far THE BEST tea I've ever had!  There's no aftertaste.  It's just GOOD tea!  You don't need a ton of sugar or flavored creamers, but I will say that half & half gives it a nice texture (as Kenyans put milk in their tea like the British).  If you like tea, even the crazy expensive ones we have here in the US, give this one a try!  Don't let the price off-put you.  It tastes far better than the price would make it seem!

review/summary: Ketepa Pride
review/text: This is my favorite black tea. I've tried a lot of breakfast/black teas: Ceylon, Irish, English, Assam, etc. Ketepa Pride is the best. Not only is it great as a breakfast tea, but I find myself drinking an extra cup or two through the day, winter, summer, what have you. I hope more Americans will "discover" this tea and make Ketepa Pride a household name.

review/text: This tea is truly from the highlands in Kenya and tastes great.  It is refreshing with a great flavor.  The packages was delivered on time and intact.<br />We usually drink tea (with milk) in the evening and this tea adds to the relaxation after a long day.

review/summary: I'm exceeding my daily recommended amount with this stuff!
review/text: I am a big fan of Ketepa pride and just got a new box a couple of days ago. I had no issues with packaging or the appearance of the tea bags. I switch between Ketepa and Safari, both of which I drank during my visits to Kenya. I prefer Safari but only when I can get it in loose form (I prefer my tea a little stronger) but I have grown fond of Ketepa and I like that each bag is not individually in layers of plastic and paper that can become wasteful. I am very excited that I can get it from Amazon! Now I'm off to order some more tooth whitener...

review/summary: Great tea!
review/text: My brother-in-law lived in Kenya for awhile and told me how wonderful the tea was. I ordered this based on his stories, and I am glad I did. It is a great drinking tea; I feel it is better than US and British tea, and similar to the teas I got in Russia. If you jut want a hot drink, you can find cheaper, but if you want good flavor, I recommend this Kenya Tea.

review/summary: Kenya Tea-Kepta Pride
review/text: A friend introduced me to this tea a few years ago. It is the best tea I have ever had. I used what she gave me sparingly to avoid running out. I'm so glad to have found it on Amazon and now I can drink it every day.
