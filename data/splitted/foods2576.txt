review/summary: Needs improvement!
review/text: Lids do not seal off water going into the pod.  Therefore it leaks around the top and down the side of the pod which misses the cup and clean up is necessary.  Some do okay but in my case it is about 50/50.  The center of lid I believe is to far down away from the seal which allows it to leak.  In all fairness sometimes it is the fault of the filter glues to the inside of the pod that won't let the lids fit well. I have tried rubber O rings to help with the gap but that does not seam to work.  All in all the best is still the original pod with foil seal.  Search still goes on to be able to make my own coffee to save money.  The best option are for the K-Cup makers to lower their profit margins so the pods are more reasonably prices.  If they did they would get more people to switch to their makers and the pod route. And they will make it up in volume.

review/summary: Just as good as the originals
review/text: I'm very glad I found these. Keurig cups are expensive and you're stuck with what they offer. If you like your own coffee, the DisposaKup lids work really great. You can use your own coffee and, unlike what some have said about it being weak, I haven't found that at all. My coffee is just as good as it's always been, and I'm not tied down to a limited expensive line of coffees anymore.<br /><br />Save your current Kcups, too, because you will need them. Simply peel off the foil liner, wash out the filter and pop on a DisposaKup lid. Line up the bottom hole of the cup that was already there from when you used it before, and you're good to go.

review/summary: K-Cup lids from Amazon.com are money savers
review/text: The disposable K-Cup lids we just purchased have allowed us to re-use our K-Cups rather than throwing them away after one use.  This definitely results in savings at the grocery store during these tough economic times.  One minor complaint is that some K-Cups require you to push the top edge of the filter paper down with a knife or similar tool in order to snap the lid in place.

review/summary: Refill Caps
review/text: These caps worked great!  I had been saving k cups so I around 25 ready.  I bought some good EXRA fine grind coffee and it took me around 1/2 hr to get all the kups cleaned and refilled.  The lids snap of perfectly.  Some are stubborn but that's it.  Any careful adult should have no problem.  I was worried about having a little foil still stuck to the rim but it worked perfectly fine.  No difference since they seal inside.  Overall I am pretty happy.  Just with they were still a little cheaper.

review/summary: Very Useful Product
review/text: I definitely recommend these lids for reuse of my K-cups.  I've not had one failure and am on my scond order.  I find that there is no leakage and no grounds in my coffee as a result of these snug-fitting cups and I am able noo use my recycled cups several times.  I have tried using the lids more than once and had have satisfactory results but I usually use them just once.  It has cut down on the cost of my coffee habit and also allows me to make my own K-cups with the coffee of my choice which I buy from a local coffee roaster.  I would recommend these for anyone who desires to use their own coffee or just cut the cost of a cup of coffee.

review/text: These are another great option for brewing your own coffee with a Keurig coffee brewer. They can be used more than once too. I've tried the pre-filled K-cups, the refillable K-cups, and these lids that you can use on pre-filled K-cups after they have been used. These and the refillable K-cups work great for me. I would recommend these to my friends.

review/text: Seller was fine BUT cleaning out and refilling used cups is time and labor intensive, lids don't fit all recycled cups and when they do, they often come off and stick in top of the brewer where resides a very sharp needle. We decided that despite our attempts to be frugal and recycle as much as possible, in this case, we will be happy with buying new coffee cups and discarding used.

review/summary: I like these things
review/text: Depending on the manufacturer of the cup you are reusing, these lids are fantastic.  Let's face it, the Kcups are expensive.  Being able to re-use them is a godsend to those of us who believe that coffee is for drinking and water is for bathing.  If you're careful with the thinner walled cups, you can use them with these lids but keep in mind that if they ARE the thinner ones, they will crumble easily so use steady gentle pressure to seal these lids on them rather than just try to smoosh the lids down.

review/text: Saves time and money. Gives you the option to brew your favorite blend at any strength you like. Take a small pampered chef knife cut around inside foil of cup. Wash out used coffee rub the paper lightly with your finger while washing and let dry. You can blow into bottom of cup while wet and let the filter dry on the counter. This pushes the filter out to dry faster.

The disposakup  lids are from Amazon. The package of 100 cups costs about $16 shipping included. So with a free cup [you already used it]And your choice of the best coffee each cup cost about 20cents not 50-60cents.

review/text: Arrived promptly and performs exactly as advertised. Moreover each lid will last as long as the K-cup itself; there's no need to dispose of the DisposaCup lids after each use. And a tip for those of you who find the lid too tight to fit onto San Francisco Bays inovative variation of the K-cup design. Use the lid on a regular K-cup first. It will then fit to the size of the rim of SF Bay's filter like a glove!<br /><br />Together with your favorite blend of coffee, this lid can reduce your costs to well under 25 cents per cup.

These lids are a must if you love your Keurig and these are the best price around.

review/summary: Yea!!!
review/text: These are so cool!  They're simple to use, just have to make sure and line up the hole in the k-cup with the needle so you don't re-punch it.  The hardest part is finding the right amount of coffee to put in (which is nothing).  I like strong coffee and haven't had any trouble from these refills as long as the filter gets cleaned out well.  I didn't buy any of the replacement filters, just reused the filters in the original K-cup.  They won't hold on forever, but so far, so good!  These lids can be reused too, just not immediately. After brewing they're pretty warm and won't seal up quite tightly enough for a second round. However, after they've cooled down, it's just like the bottom of the K-cup, line them up so the top needle doesn't punch a second hole and you'll be fine. I love my Keurig machine but have really missed my Smokey Row coffee. Now I can have both!

review/summary: K cup disposal lids.
review/text: We have had our Keurig K cup coffee pot about a month now and have been experimenting<br />wih different ways of reusing the K cups to add our favorite blends of coffee.  We have<br />both the plastic reusable inserts and the disposable lids.  Both work fine.  Most K cups<br />have a filter inside of them glued to the inside rim of the cup.  We have found that we can<br />reuse the same filter if we rinse them out good for a 2nd or 3rd time.<br /><br />Disposable rims work on about 95% of the resued K cups.  Some of the filters where they are<br />glued around rim will not allow the diposable lid to fit without excessive force which results<br />in crushing the cup itself.  We just move the coffee and lid to another cup and works ok.  The<br />plastic lids are thicker and can usually pass over the filter rim.<br /><br />We have also reused the lids 2 or 3 times before disposing them and the K cups once or twice.<br />If you purchase cup filters, then reuse of the cup would be extended.<br /><br />Some reused K cups will leak around hole in bottom causing leakage around bottom which can allow<br />some of the coffee to drip down outsite of cup but this is minor.<br /><br />We mix and match between refilled and factory type K cups of coffee so always have enough<br />K cups to reuse.  They also sell blank K cups and filters but we have not tried that yet.<br />We are happy with results we have been getting.

review/summary: DisposaKup Lids are OK
review/text: The Disposakup Lids are OK, they work as advertised.  I have no problems.  I suspect, but haven't tried it, that they could be reused if they are carefully rotationally indexed to the Kcup body (using an index mark).  However, one has to consider the cost of the lids themselves (including shipping), plus the cost of the premium coffee, plus the considerable trouble of peeling off the original foil, cleaning out the K-cup, refilling it, as opposed to just getting a bunch of Kcups at Sam's Club for $0.50 each, and tossing the carcasses.<br />However, I am still not sold on the whole Kuring thing.  I got it as a gift.

review/summary: DisposaKup Lid for K-cups
review/text: These work great. They do just as promised. Yes, they are tight fitting, but that's a good thing.  You'll get the hang of assembling the lid to the cup after about 2 or 3 cups.  Tip: once you have the lid on, flip it upside down on a counter and press around the edges so you don't crush the cup. You'll feel the snap as the lid goes in completely.  When placing in the brewer, it's best to line up the bottom puncture with the needle.  In short, if your favorite coffee isn't yet available as a K-cup, get these lids.

review/text: These lids work perfectly.  So far they have fit every lid from the different brands of k-kups.  I know they are disposable, but I have been able to get at least 2-3 uses out of each lid.  Well worth the price!

review/summary: Low cost solution to expensive K-cups
review/text: We recently purchased a Keurig coffee maker.  Love the convenience but was finding the kcups to be an expensive luxury.  Now with the replacement lids we simply clean out the used kcups and fill them with our own coffee and place a new lid on and presto.... we still have the convenience of the coffee maker at half the price.  Love them!

review/summary: Amazing Product
review/text: In my house we drink coffee like it's going out of style.  We are constantly buying K-cup for our machine.  We have tried a number of different products to save a bit of money and save the environment.  These k-cup tops are amazingly simple to use and work wonderfully.  They lessen the environmental impact of using 1000's of k-cups.

review/summary: Works like a charm!
review/text: How cool is it that you can actually reuse your k-cups!?  These disposable lids work perfectly and fit on the top of the cleaned k-cups.  I noticed no leakage.  The fit is nice and tight and I even managed to reuse the lids a few times before throwing them away.<br /><br />I never made it to five uses, but what a great idea!<br /><br />(Also might add that you cannot place a piece of press and seal under them when you reuse them.  The press and seal kind of melts and stretches down and seals the punctured hole.  Ended up with water everywhere.)<br /><br />If you're looking to save a few bucks by reusing your k-cups, these are a great find!

review/summary: Finally ... a make-your-own K-cup gimmick that works!!
review/text: With the soaring price of K-cups I've tried all the various gimmicks out there ... but each one had a problem, so I kept looking.  Now at last, I can stop looking and enjoy my coffee again.<br /><br />These DisposaKup lids fit tighly ... and best of all don't leak!  And by using the original k-cups with their built-in paper filter, the water is held in the coffee long enough to brew a perfect cup.  Just like the expensive K-cups you buy.  The other types I tried ... 2 different types of hard plastic cups with mesh filters ... allow water to drain thru so quickly, the taste never came out right.  And one type leaked so much during brewing, I had to clean up a mess on the counter everytime I used it.  I also tried a different type lid ... but they didn't fit tightly enough ... and leaked badly as well.<br /><br />But these lids are great.  I recommend them to anyone who has tried the other products out there and who is still looking.  And best of all ... now I've got enough lids to prepare a bunch of k-cups ahead ... and not have to stop and clean out grounds, each time I make a cup of coffee.

review/summary: Too big for some k cups
review/text: I thought this would be a perfect solution for re-using my K cups.  It worked fine on the black or dark blue cups, but was too big to get into the white cups that most suppliers use.  The white cups are more flimsy and you end up ruining the cup by the time you get this lid inserted, if you can insert it at all.  I had previously tried the "iron-on" aluminum lids but found them to leak too often, and it took a lot of time to prepare the cups.

review/text: I purchased these DisposaKup lids for a number of reasons, primarily to try and reuse the plastic K-Cups for more than 1 cup of coffee. As of this writing I've had 10 cups of coffee using these caps and I am very pleased with the results. No leakage, no mess, and a good cup of coffee. I prefer my coffee a bit strong and that is what I get (some people complained of the coffee being weak).<br /><br />We have a Cuisinart and not a Keurig brand of maker and perhaps that is the reason I haven't seen any of the problems that some people have seen.<br /><br />The only thing that you should know is that cleaning the used K-Cups does take a bit of time and patience but in my opinion it's worth the effort.

review/summary: DisposaKup Lids
review/text: I think the lids work great and are a fantastic way to save money when using the Kuerig coffee maker. I have found the easiest coffee cups to refill with the lids is the millstone coffee. We love the hazelnut flavor too. I just peel off the foil lid on a used Kcup, empty out the coffee, then put a spoon of coffee in, then put the lid on. It is fairly easy to tell where the previous hole was in the bottom, so you can find it without too much effort. That way you won't have extra coffee coming into your cup as it brews.

review/summary: Better than complete DisposaKups
review/text: Allows me to use my favorite -- and less expensive -- Ethiopian coffee from Green Mountain in a k-cup coffeemaker.  Works for several repeat uses of original cup before filter detaches from wear.  Prolong use of cup by making certain that lower needle fits existing cup puncture.  Better than the DisposaKup complete cup-filter-lid kits because those tend to leak a bit whereas the replacement lids on reused regular cups don't.  Worth trying if you are trying to save money on k-cups or if you can't get commercial k-cups with the coffee you want [seasonal or special coffees, like Blue Mountain Jamaican or some Konas or African beans].  Face it -- the economics of producing commercial k-cup blends place real restrictions on what you can enjoy unless you use something like this or one of the reloadable plastic devices [which are messier to my thinking and don't always make good coffee].  Give it a try!

review/text: I would love to try the disposaKup lids, but they are too spendy. $10.99 for 100 plus $5.98 shipping makes them about .17 cents each. If you can get 3 uses per lid then not so bad but at .17 cents per cup plus the price of the coffee you choose to use I may as well just buy the K-Cups. My husband however figured out that the K-Cups fit into the grey or brown My K-Cup tightly the first time and easier after that and the lid screws on tightly and works great. We just leave the little basket out and put in a clean K-Cup also the little filters that are 7.99 for 100 and free shipping with Amazon Prime fit into the My K-Cup filter and put lid on.

review/text: I love to bake and cook and feel homemade, from scratch, is almost always the way to go. Cookies, cakes etc, nothing can beat the loving touch of measuring the ingredients, right? Wrong! On a whim I picked up some Ghirardelli chocolate brownie mix at the store and haven't looked back since. Like all brownie mixes it's a box of powdered stuff to which is added oil, water, and egg.<br /><br />After that it's totally different from any box mix, or made at home brownie. The brownies have a delicious flavor, no fake or nasty taste. They are thick and dense and chocolate. Of course, being Ghirardelli I would expect the chocolate to be good, but these are great. I felt a little miffed to be honest and began making brownies left and right from some pretty famous chefs and gourmet cookbooks and finally, about the fifth time my family said, "these are good, when are you going to make the Ghiardelli again?" I gave up. I even take these to events and always get compliments.

If there is ever a special occasion and my wife wants to treat the guests to something they will love we prepare these brownies.<br /><br />Should you want to enhance the brownies you can top the warm brownies after baking with a layer of unwrapped Dark or Milk Chocolate Hershey Chocolate bars and allow to cool to room temperature before cutting. Either of those combinations should provide a baked desert that will bring enthusiastic compliments.

review/text: Ghirardelli Chocolate Brownie Mix, Double Chocolate, 18 Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)  I have been using this product for years - have also tried many other brands but nothing compares to the rich chocolate flavor of Ghirardelli; so much so I buy it by the case.  Amazon.com offers a great price and needless to say their delivery service far surpasses all other companies.  I am 78 years "young" and the fact that I've used their product  FOR YEARS  is really saying something.  The texture of this product is so silky and ease of making a pleasure.

review/summary: Best boxed mix, better than made from scratch
review/text: I've tried a lot of brownie recipes and love to bake. Ghirardelli brownie mix is far, far better than any recipe I've tried (and people love my baked goodies).<br />The recipe is easy to follow, and the results are just fabulous- the perfect texture and flavor. There's a reason all the other reviews that have been posted so far are all 5-stars as well.<br /><br />There is a walnut brownie mix from Ghirardelli, but I like to add chopped walnut & add them to the double chocolate one instead, & then top with large pieces.<br /><br />I've taken them out of the oven 10 minutes before they're done, piped swirls of Nutella on top (and a few times topped that with chopped hazelnuts), and then put them back in for the remaining time. Delicious, but very rich.

review/summary: Sinfully delicious
review/text: Prepare for a chocolate overload with these brownies!  Scrumptious brownies with chocolate chips inside ensure you get an overdose of chocolate with every bite.  VERY simple to make.  You just beat an egg, add 1/3 oil and 1/3 water then the brownie mix.  Beat with a spatula about 40 times, then pour into a baking dish sprayed with oil.  Cooks in about 45 mintues.  Doesn't cool fast enough especially because the house fills up with yummy brownie smells and you just about go insane waiting to pop them in your mouth!<br /><br />Hint: Line a glass baking dish with aluminum foil prior to spraying with oil.  That way, once the brownies are cooled, you just lift out the foil and peel away from the brownies easily without anything sticking to the bottom of the dish, and you can just transfer onto a plate once they're cooled and cut.

review/text: I always bake from scratch, but decided to make an exception with Ghirardelli brownies. These are delicious, and quite a difference from Ghirardelli's "Dark Chocolate Brownies," which are horrid. I thought both mixes would be close, since the ingredients are very similar, but nothing could be further from the truth. These taste great, while the "Dark Chocolate Brownies" taste like burnt coal.

review/summary: Chewy, rich milk chocolate taste, and moist!
review/text: I saw this at my local grocery store and decided to give it a try. I like baking, and though I've baked brownies from scratch, I've not had the best results - some turn out too hard, some turn out dry, and the other brand mixes had not yielded great results either.<br /><br />Well, Ghirardelli has truly outdone itself. This mix turned out a great batch of brownies, earning high praise from my husband and daughter, and it was so easy! The brownies have chocolate bits in them which add to the already rich chocolate flavor, and they are deliciously chewy and moist, even after I stored them in the refrigerator for a couple of days. I also tried out the Ghirardelli brownie mix with walnuts and they were great too. I'm sticking to this brand to satisfy my family's brownie craving from now on!

review/summary: Best brownies ever.  EVER.
review/text: My boyfriend and I have been trying various boxed brownie mixes to find the one. He hates cake so brownies are the compromise. We tried an organic healthy mix, which was the second worst brownie I have ever had, next to a gluten free brownie, as well as all the typical Betty Crocker stuff. Then at Winco, I decided to splurge, because he was buying, and get the Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Brownie Mix for $2.75. We both agreed they were the BEST brownies we've ever had. These brownies are the reason anyone would even like brownies. An added plus, something I strive to look for in all processed foods, is that it has absolutely NO Partially or Fully Hydrogenated anything. About as close to measuring the ingredients out at home as you can get without actually having to do it. I'll be sure to subscribe for Ghirardelli Brownie Mix deliveries every month! Also, the triple chocolate and dark chocolate brownies are also awesome.

review/summary: The perfect brownie mix
review/text: The chocolate flavor is just amazing.  The texture is soft and slightly gooey (but not runny) - basically perfect.  Infinitely better than any other brownie mix I've ever tried.  More expensive than the cheap $1 box, but you get what you pay for.  For me, its more about the calories than the price.  If I'm going to indulge I want it to be worthwhile.  If you're tired of hard, crusty brownies with a stale flavor, try these.  I get these at my local Target and the price is (surprisingly) better than Amazon.

review/summary: threw out my scratch recipe after trying these....
review/text: ....because after just a couple of bites I realized that I would not be needing it anymore. I've been baking for a good number of years and I've tasted some really good brownies in my time; these not only can compete with a scratch/homemade recipe, it totally beats the pants off of just about any brownie I've ever tried.<br /><br />Taste/Texture: This is definitely a quality chocolate experience; leans toward the darker chocolate taste - I'd say at least a 55-65% cocoa flavor, in the semisweet family for sure. The level of sweetness is medium to high but well balanced with the chocolate so it's not cloying or grainy,  like a really good Godiva truffle. These have a texture halfway between fudgy and cake-like, both dense and moist. The chips add a subtle bit of extra something that is gooey and delicious when warm and adds a tiny bit of creamy crunch when they are cold. The top has that delicate crust to it when they cool which to me is the hallmark of an utterly perfect brownie.<br /><br />Not a thing I would change about this mix - except maybe the price - but still worth it.

review/summary: A Treat to Stick With
review/text: Our three pooches get a Beefeaters Munchy Stick every day, usually in the evening. They look forward to this daily ritual with great anticipation. When the treats are presented to the three girls, each assumes her position apart from the others and commences chewing. Between five and ten minutes the Stix are history, and three happy girls are searching for some fortuitous crumbs. We've been following this routine for years and the dogs have never tired of these chew treats. We do vary the flavor of the Stix, and have even purchased Beefeater variations on the theme that target the coat, calm jittery nerves, or help build cartilage with glucosamine. Occasionally we've run out of Beefeeaters and had to substitute other brands while waiting for our mail order supply to arrive. Our pooches seem to prefer the Beefeaters brand.<br /><br />No matter which flavor we choose, the girls love their Beefeaters Munchies.

review/text: I'm a sardine purist in that I typically prefer my sardines with little more than olive oil and perhaps a hint of smoke. I found myself in the canned fish section of the local supermarket and was tempted to try something new. While there normally would be something off-putting if not downright scary about anything that comes in a "sweet and tangy sauce", I figured what the hell and took home a tin. I'm glad I did. The sardines are filleted completely without and bones. The texture was middle of the road. The could be easily picked up with fingers without fear of breaking, but just as easily given a quick mash with the tines of a fork. The meat was a little darker than most, probably from the sauce, and has a nice robust flavor but without smelling fishy. The sauce was thin and clear, mostly oil obviously, but tinted brick red. There was an ever so slight hint of heat but a definite but once again not overpowering vinegar tang. It's the perfect oil flavor to complement the bread for the active dipper. I've purchased these many times since.

review/summary: Refreshingly different take on canned sardines
review/text: The Season product line of canned sardines I think is one of the best, but even so it took a bit of courage to order these sardines in a "sweet and tangy sauce".  What will they be like?  Will they be super hot?  Will they be sardines packed in salsa?  What will I get.<br /><br />Well, I was pleasantly surprised at the understated taste of the sauce.  You can still taste plenty of sardine, but the sauce offsets the fishyness substantially.  In fact, as far as I can tell the sauce is clear with the exception that it leaves the fish itself a shade or two darker than canned sardines would usually be.<br /><br />At first I thought it tasted rather strange but sort of good, but the taste grew on me and by the time I finished the can I wanted more.  So, if you're getting bored with your usual canned sardines, these may be your ticket to some variety.

review/summary: Quality product, unique flavor, but messy access
review/text: If you are someone (like myself) who normally only eats sardines in tomato sauce and would like a change of pace, this is a product to seriously consider.  It has a unique flavor, no doubt due to the clove/oregano combination, and it sports the cleanness of ingredients which makes the Season brand a premium one.  I have never seen this exact product in any stores in my area, so it is thanks to Amazon that I can get them at all.  The reason I gave only four stars instead of five is, really, the can.  Whereas Season's sardines in tomato sauce now have the convenient peel-open lid, this variety still comes in the old-style pull-ring can.  Given that the base of these is very oily, it is about impossible to open the can without squeezing it somehow -- and out comes the oil.  So if you do try these, and I recommend you do, you may as well open them over the sink and have a dish ready nearby to avoid a substantial mess.  They are good paired with buttered (yes, I said buttered) whole-wheat toast.
