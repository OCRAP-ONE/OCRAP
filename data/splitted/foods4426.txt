review/text: It took two or three cans, but I love these now.  When I first tried these, I thought the taste was not as "bold" as I would like it to be.  I do wish they were a tad stronger and hotter on the wasabi taste, but I am hooked on these now.  I eat some almost every day.

review/text: These almonds aren't bad--better than just eating regular salted almonds.  But I tried the Jalapeno Smokehouse almonds first, and I like those a LOT more than the Wasabi & Soy.  I found that I got a stronger "kick" from the horseradish if I sucked on the almond first before eating it.

review/summary: I Didn't Know
review/text: I didn't like these.<br />I guess it's my fault for not liking them, because I actually have never tried wasabi, but I like asian flavors in food and adore all of Blue Diamond's bold flavors, so when I saw this in the store, I was like hey why not.<br /><br />Now I know why not. These nuts were horrific...they had this...harsh acerbic taste to them that I just could not enjoy. I ended up wiping most of the flavoring off and chopping the nuts up to put in stuff like salads. The nuts themselves are high quality and always taste fresh, so at least I was able to get some use from them. However, I would never  buy these again and if you are not experienced with wasabi, you may want to think twice before buying them lol.

review/summary: Not what I hoped for, but probably should've expected
review/text: I picked up a can of these after the glowing reviews I read for it. To keep it short, it has a very authentic wasabi taste. It literally tastes like an almond dipped in wasabi sauce. And that, to me, doesn't make the most appealing snack. I find the wasabi flavor overwhelming, and none of the soy flavor coming through. I thought it'd come through as a more balanced flavor, but that's not the case. I won't be eating anymore, personally. I gave it two stars since it is wasabi flavor, and it certainly tastes like that.

review/text: I'd been buying it for years WHEN I COULD FIND IT, at the local grocery. Generally buying 5 or 6 cans cause I couldn't be sure it would be there next time I went. As such, I was thrilled to see Amazon selling it in bulk and cheaper than at my local store.<br /><br />These are almonds... so you get the health benefits of that. They are very tasty, with a mild wasabi tang... I've shared them with friends and they love them.<br /><br />Granted, these don't provide the entertainment value of the wasabi peas from the Japanese place that blow out your sinuses. But Its still a very tasty, semi healthy (lots of salt), snack that fills my need for something crunchy.<br /><br />MUCH healthier than potato chips.

review/summary: Very tasty but not very Habanero-y
review/text: This is one of my favorites in the Blue Diamond "BOLD" flavors line. There's a nice balance of heat vs sweet, and the saltiness isn't overwhelming. You can eat 'em by the handful, and probably will once you taste them.<br /><br /> However, true hot-pepper fans know that the heat of the Habanero pepper is a fearsome thing. You won't find much of it here, just a little hint. That's probably for the best, given that most people can't tolerate the blazing intensity of those devilish little peppers. But I kind of wish Blue Diamond would put out a "BOLD, and This Time We Mean It" line for those of us who really do love spicy foods.

review/summary: Just right for this low carb snacker!
review/text: OH MY WORD!! I love these, I love the bold flavored Blue Diamond almonds. Love this flavor first, then the wasabi then the salt vinegar. The Wasabi has a gram or so more of carbs, so I generally choose this one or the salt and vinegar. The problem for me is I'm an addict. If I got 3 pounds of these almonds, I'd eat 3 pounds of these almonds in short order. That being said. They are delicious, salty, a little spicy with a touch of sweeet - they are fantastic! This price is better than I get them at Wally World for the 6oz can and they are cheaper there than anywhere else. So, buy these, buy them now and hide the other bags from yourself (or send them to me) ...they are SO good, I'm eating them now! :<br /><br />Hey Amazon, this is sold and shipped by you, it would be ever so nice if this came on the subscribe and save!

review/summary: A Great Spicy, Healthy Snack!!
review/text: Blue Diamond Bold Jalapeno Smokehouse Almonds are a great snack.  Almonds are one of the healthiest nuts that you can eat, and the Jalapeno Smokehouse flavor is very similar to chipotle.  This isn't too surprising since a chipotle is a smoked jalapeno after all.  From a nutrition stand point, the only special consideration that doesn't come will all almonds is the 180 mg of sodium per serving.  Unless you get a plain, unsalted nut this is pretty typical.  I like to keep a can of these either in my desk or in the pantry at home for snacking.  Grabbing a handful of these is great between meals when hunger strikes.  So if you are looking for a spicy snack that is fairly healthy, give these a try.

While the price is a little higher than I'd like, that is overridden by the fact that I can indeed get them, and they are delivered right to my door.  Ordering two packs gives me free shipping, too. These almonds are delicious by themselves, but when mixed with dark chocolate, they become irresistible.  The yummy recipe goes like this: take two almonds and one Hershey's dark chocolate kiss.  Pop the two almonds in your mouth and chew a little. Then pop in the chocolate kiss and chew, mixing the two together.  Sheer bliss!  I've become addicted and don't know what I'd do if these flavored almonds ever become unavailable.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about "bowel tolerance" or "happy bowels" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

review/text: Lime and Chili seemed a strange combination but the Lime Flavor is natural, not sweet, just tart enough to bring out the chili spice to create a great tasting nut treat to snack on.  Almonds are a great, fun snack and having one that has a Lime Tart Flavor is absolutely Fabulous.  Even better is that Amazon delivers three full one pound packages for less than the price this item normally retails for in Stores, IF you can even get it in your favorite store.

review/text: Blue Diamond almonds are by far my favorite for flavor and texture. My only minimal complaint about these is that they are very minimally spicy. I was afraid to go for Habenero in case they were TOO spicy, but given that these are much more mild than Jalepenos I will go for Habanero next order.

review/summary: only for lime lovers
review/text: I like lime and I like chili so I figured this would be a pretty tasty nut. It is definitely very flavorful but the lime overpowers the chili so much that the chili might as well be nonexistent. So if you are a lime lover you will probably enjoy this flavor, otherwise you might want to try one of the other varieties instead.  Personally I will finish up this batch but once they're gone I will go back to my habanero bbq and wasabi.

review/text: I love these almonds - they are the perfect snack, you don't need to eat a lot to feel satisfied. Also, since they have a lot of flavor, you feel "mouth-satisfied" as well. The wasabi is not too hot (actually I wish it were just a little hotter) and the soy just adds a little bit of saltiness. I recommend these if you like wasabi peas but want something with more nutritional value.

review/text: To start I should say I HATE Almonds. I don't dislike them, I hate them (and I have tried all manner of almonds, from raw to various flavors). A former co-worker brought a huge jug of these to work and urged me to give one a try. Like the stubborn child who refuses to eat her veggies, I popped one in my mouth, with a large glass of water in hand to wash down what I expected to be the awful (to me) flavor. I was shocked to find I not only didn't object to these, but became hooked on them in short order.<br /><br />I have been unable to find this flavor in the mega jug my co-worked purchased at a big box retailer over a year ago and was pleased to find this option on Amazon for a price lower than my local grogery store. I wish that big jug were available, but these smaller cans probably assure a fresher product.<br /><br />I will add, that I am a big fan of vinegar, but am not a big fan of salt and vinegar chips. These almonds have an excellent balance of flavor.

They are very tasty as well as healthy.  When we got home, we purchased them from Amazon.  We bought the 1.5 ounce snack bags.  They are perfect for lunches or travel snacks.  They also help with portion control!<br />By purchasing them in bulk from Amazon, we are able to get them for $1 or less per bag.  When we purchased them from a convenience store on our vacation we paid $2+ per bag.  It's a great savings to buy them here.

review/summary: addictive taste
review/text: The taste of these almonds are addictive.  They are spicy, but not too hot like you'd think a habanero would be.  It's been hard to stay out of them and I eat too many in a day.  The price from this seller is stellar and about the same price (per lb) that I find at walmart for a small can.<br />We will re-order soon as the almonds are almost gone  :-)

review/summary: A good flavor but not bold in comparison to some of the other flavors and more salt!
review/text: I love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are my favorite snack.  This one while good was not great for me.  When I hear the word "Bold" I expect something over the top and this one was just sort of medium.  It seems that they aimed for the middle of the road when it comes to being a spicy flavor!  We have Buffalo Wing restaurants here that offer about 6 grades of spiciness from hot to death and this wasn't even close.<br /><br />If I compare this to the Blue Diamond Wasabi & Soy spiciness it is not even in the same galaxy.  This is still a good flavor but not what I was expecting.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor does have 9% of your daily intake of sodium which is almost twice the amount in many of the other Blue Diamond flavors. It has even 50% more salt than the Bold Salt `n Vinegar flavor? For that reason I will eat this flavor more sparingly.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you, just watch the salt.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them. Since they have a more moderate flavor than what I was expecting for a "Bold" product and contain so much salt I gave it 4 stars.  I eat these almonds because they taste good and are healthier for you but the extra salt in this one negates some of the health benefits in my opinion. This is still a good flavor and I like them but not love them!

review/text: I bought this item in Overland Park, Kansas and was unable to find in Central New Jersey. So, went to Amazon and wala--it appeared, Thank goodness! The tea is totally Caffeine Free as it is Herbal. The best is the fact that it is Kosher as most Bigelow tea is. Nice taste and can actually get more than 2 quarts from one tea bag. If you drink alot of iced tea, be prepared to go through a box quickly--there are 4 bags/pouch and 2 pouches/box. The pack is comprised of 6 boxes in all equally 48 tea bags/pack.<br />Good luck

Add 1 foil pack (contains 4 large tea bags) and let seep for 50 minutes.  Remove bags. Add sugar or sugar substitute if needed.<br />Refrigerate.  Same recipe for the raspberry tea.

review/summary: Incredible taste, poor description
review/text: I have been purchasing this product for about a year after first trying it on a trip to Memphis.  The taste is nothing like a dill pickle, and the picture above shows pickle chips, not a relish (which this is).  It is like a very good sweet relish with a great kick!  Not at all like a hot sauce, but will gently warm your tongue.  Wonderful used in anything where you would normally use sweet relish.  Really worth a try!  A hot dog will never taste the same again!

review/summary: It has 202 cals and 53 carbs per cup. Great sweetener, but their marketing is misleading!
review/text: I like this sweetener a lot. But it is not a NO sweetener like the label claims, it is a LOW calorie sweetener when you do the math.<br /><br />The company says on their website that are 202 calories and 53 grams of carbs for a cup of Ideal. So it is 12.5 cals/3.3 carbs a tablespoon, and 4 cals/1.1 carbs a teaspoon. So not an actual NO calorie sweetener like the bag says. They list 0 calories because they can since it is under 5 calories for the serving size they have listed, but on a large pouch meant for baking you would use way more than a teaspoon -- especially if you wanted to make any of the sweet items they have pictured on the front of the bag! The label should be changed to reflect its intended purpose. It's like saying a can of regular soda is calorie free if you list it as being 42 servings.<br /><br />That said, I will still be using it since it has less than a third of the calories of sugar, about a quarter of the carbs and tastes very good. Their shady lack of disclosure on the bag leaves a bad taste in my mouth. But while it's not a no calorie sweetener, but it is pretty close to ideal.<br /><br />Rating breakdown:<br />Product claims = 1 star<br />Product taste = 5 stars<br />Overall: 3 stars<br /><br />Calorie and carb info from their own website.

review/summary: Ok in a pinch, but make your own
review/text: I thought this product would be vastly different from all the other 'brown sugar replacement' items on the market. It does taste better than Diabetisweet or the Steele's.<br /><br />Ideal has become my new favorite sweetener. There is no aftertaste, unlike what many of us experience with Splenda. However I did not find this Ideal Brown Sugar sub to be so much different that it's worth the higher cost. It's just Ideal sweetener and molasses, packaged for convenience with the higher premium for convenience's sake.<br /><br />I make my own 'brown sugar' out of Ideal using about a teaspoon of blackstrap molasses to 1/4 c. of Ideal regular. You can adjust the molasses to suit your need for light or dark brown sugar in your recipes, or to suit your taste. (And your pocketbook will thank you)

review/summary: Simply the best sugar substitute available
review/text: For health reasons, our family has searched for an adequate sugar substitute. Over the years we have tried them all and found each product wanting - until we found Ideal.<br /><br />This sweetener has the taste and texture of sugar without any of the issues surrounding other sugar substitutes. It avoids the question of health risks attributed to aspartame. It does not have the 'grassy' taste of Stevia; the 'cold' sensation of erythritol; or, what we find to be, the after-taste of Splenda.<br /><br />For baking, it is unparalleled. Even our friends who eat sugar cannot tell that we use Ideal. We bake custards and crustless cheesecakes with Ideal and no one knows that they are sugar free. We use it in confections such as fudge and chocolate truffles with exceptional results.<br /><br />Like many other sugar alternatives, Ideal will not caramelize. This is not a fault of the product but rather a chemical dynamic of sugar alcohol based sweeteners. However, this seems is a small price to pay for a sweetener that is otherwise indistinguishable from sugar.<br /><br />Whether you choose to use the brown sugar substitute (which does not have the actual sugar found in Splenda's brown sugar blend) or the white sweetener, we are sure that you will find Ideal a wonderful alternative to sugar. We recommend it to our friends who are diabetic or who are looking to cut out sugar for other reasons. They all agree that it is the best tasting alternative to sugar on the market today.

I've been hearing all the horrors of sugar in our bodies and decided to really search for a substitute for my whole family. Well, I've found it...this sweetner was very good in my oatmeal along side the cinnamon. I was a little more hesitant to use it in my favorite cookie recipe. Well, this evening I used it in my recipe and it was fantastic! I didn't miss the sugar at all and it had no after taste at all. My husband even couldn't tell it was sugar free.<br /><br />So if you're like me and trying to get away from sugar, try this. It might surprise you too.

review/text: Finally, a really good substitute for brown sugar! I've only used it in three recipes so far, but it tastes great. The really good recipe was for Carolina Pulled Pork, and the accompanying vinegar barbecue sauce. Splenda's idea for brown sugar is to use their sweetener along with sugar-free maple syrup. Doesn't sound like brown sugar to me. This really does taste like brown sugar, though. It's not moist and clumpy like brown sugar, but the taste is there, and that's what counts.

It was good while it lasted I guess.<br /><br />Updated 4/26/12<br />Ok, they must have filled up their supply at Amazon because today it's back down to around $5.49. I get cranky when I run out of stuff I like, so this time I'm ordering 3 bags of it. AND raising my rating to 5 stars.<br /><br />BTW, this stuff is made with zylitol which my dentist promotes like crazy. He says it kills bacteria that cause tooth decay AND is a great anti-inflammatory.

review/summary: Better than Splenda Brown for baking
review/text: After doing lots of research regarding the best sugar substitutes for baking, I decided to try the Ideal brand.  I try to adhere as much as possible to a South Beach Diet eating plan, but I love to bake, so it was important for me to find something that fits the plan and still tastes good in baked products.  I had been pleased with Splenda Brown, but it still contains more sugar than I wanted to use.  I've been substituting Ideal Brown for brown sugar in my cakes and cookies and have been very pleased with the results.  There is none of that strange, artificial taste that often comes with sugar substitutes, plus Ideal Brown is much easier to measure.

review/summary: Excellent brown sugar replacement!
review/text: I've been a low-carber for 15 years.  Up till I tried this, my brown sugar-alternative sweetener of choice was Canadian Brown Sugar Twin, which is made from cyclamates. American BST is made from saccharine, as is Brown Sweet 'n' Low, both of which are so-so in taste and becoming harder to find om stores.  But the taste of the brown Ideal sweetener was WAY superior in taste to any of the other brown artificial sweeteners!
