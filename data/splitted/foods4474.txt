review/summary: Fiber-None Bars  Don't Be Fooled!
review/text: Fiber one bars actually don't have real fiber.  They contain inulin (from chicory root) which is technically fiber because the body can't digest it.  Unfortunately fiber is defined by anything that can't be broken down easily.  These bars do not contain REAL fiber. (The real fiber usually found in whole grain breads and cereals) So if it says "chicory root" or "inulin" in the ingredients, you can be sure you aren't eating the fiber your body can actually use.

review/summary: Highly enjoyable cup of coffee
review/text: Just ordered our second set of this coffee and decided to share with others.  When brewed it was smooth and flavorful.  The aroma was wonderful; there was none of the burned/uriney smell some coffee has.  The only negative, minor as I have filters, is that it is a very, very fine grind so the gold basket alone let stragglers through.  My family highly recommends this coffee!

review/summary: Saves me trips to Starbucks
review/text: I absolutely LOVE the pumpkin spice latte they serve at Starbucks.  My friend told me about the Via Ready Brew Pumpkin Spice packs.  While there is no nutmeg on top this stuff still hits the spot (and I can also add my own nutmeg).  Also I don't have to drive 10 minutes just to get some, wait in line, etc... I can just heat up a small pan of milk on the stove, add the Via Ready Brew to my mug, pour, mix and enjoy!  Also it is cheaper than going to Starbucks.  Their grande size latte is about $4 whereas one packet of Via Ready Brew from Amazon comes out to $2.68 for a serving.  Also, depending on your mug size you can add more or not as much milk so the flavor is to your liking.  I'm going to stock up while I can on this :)

review/text: My 5 month old is teething and putting everything in her mouth. She is simultaneously showing interest in food. I was looking for something that would satisfy all of her needs and this is it. Although this is made in China, I felt confident about buying it because it is organic. The crackers are crisp and textured so they provide teething relief. However,once they get really wet they dissolve, so there's no choking risk! This plus is also a minus because if your baby is messy and gets this everywhere, clean up before they dry because they dry like cement chips!

review/summary: An Earl Grey Tea That Won't Disappoint
review/text: *****<br />St. Dalfour's wonderful Certified Organic Earl Grey Tea is made from hand-picked, organic Ceylon tea. The flavor is enhanced by "the all natural flavor of bergamot orange", which added interest and made my tea experience delightful. The orange flavor was subtle, not overwhelming at all. I left the tea bag in as I drank the tea (the whole time, much longer than recommended), which turns most teas bitter, but not this one.<br /><br />St. Dalfour is a French firm that makes natural teas, including this organic tea. There is not a lot of information about them on their web site beyond the basics, but what is there looks good.<br /><br />Earl Grey teas are one of my favorite black teas, so if you are a fan also, this tea is one not to miss.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/text: An admitted fan of Stash Earl Grey, nevertheless I endeavor to try them all.  St. Dalfour seemed intriguing, being a French company instead of British, so I gave it a try.  This tea neither tastes nor smells anything like Earl Grey.  The aroma of the tea upon opening the bag is rather bland with no hint of bergamont.  Believe it or not, the aroma and flavor after steeping are a mild licorice.  I'm serious!  If I was given this tea with no forewarning, I would have assumed it was Licorice Tea.  The flavor is not unpleasant.  It is quite different.  It is definitely not Earl Grey.  Be forewarned if you are seeking an Earl Grey aroma/flavor - this is not it.

review/text: I'm not much of a health food person (actually, if the food is healthy I usually don't like it) but this taco mix is awesome. I've used just about every taco mix known to man over the years and have been making my own for quite some time but this stuff has brought me back to using a simple mix in my tacos without feeling guilty.

review/summary: Best taco seasoning you can buy
review/text: Notice that this taco seasoning packet weighs as much as the other brands, but doesn't have fillers like corn in it.  That means you get a lot more spices and flavor.  It's our favorite brand, and we've tried everything from store brands to organic/natural versions (a close second is La Preferida, and everything else is a distant third).  It's also great for people like me with multiple food allergies, or just if you're trying to cut chemicals out of your diet.  It's purpose is flavor and not excessive heat, so if you want to burn off your taste buds you'll have to add something to do that.

review/summary: Awesome product
review/text: I have used agave for many things and find that it is a better alternative to sugar.  It will not give you the sugar plunge you get from sugary products.  If you are using this product in beverages please realize that it is not going to give you that same sugary, syrupy flavor that some people are used to from regular sugar or substitutes.  It is a subtle sweetness.<br /><br />I have served this product to friends, and those who are used to a sugary taste in their tea didn't care for it as much as those friends who don't use a lot of sugar.  It really depends on what you are used to.  I have no complaints about this product.<br /><br />Agave is also better for people who have diabetes, as it does not spike blood sugar levels.<br /><br />Don't pass up on trying this great alternative to sugar.  It is worth letting your tastebuds adapt to the subtleness.  It is also great for baking.  Also, this is now labeled as organic, so another reason to try it.

Plus, each stick is only 15 calories, so you can watch your proportion if that matters to you. I will definitely purchase this again.

review/summary: convenient way of taking your agave with you!
review/text: I was hesitant about this product based on some customer reviews that said there were difficulties opening the little sticks and that they (the customers, not the sticks) got agave all over their fingers... I wonder if Stash read the reviews and changed their packaging?  I have not had this problem, and I'm usually *awful* at opening packaging! With these, I simply bite off the end (gross, I know, but I am a student and I don't/can't carry a knife around with me in my bookbag all day) and squeeze it into my coffee.  It's a great way to have my agave with me because most coffee shops and cafes have not yet started stocking this alongside their poisonous sugar alternatives (you know, those pink, blue, and yellow packets).  Keeps my blood sugar from spiking, sweetens my coffee--what more could you ask for?

review/summary: Smell delightful, taste not so much
review/text: I picked up these honey sticks because I'm in a chai tea phase and thought they'd be nice to add to a simple black tea. Upon taking one from the box, I was treated to a wonderful scent of cinnamon and spices that reminded me of Christmas time.  I brewed my tea, added the stick of honey and stirred.  As I took that first sip, I couldn't much smell the honey I just added.  As the tea coated my tongue I was waiting and waiting for the scent of the honey stick to hit my tongue and it never really did. I could taste a tiny bit of honey, but nothing more than if I added plain clover honey to my tea.  It was rather underwhelming.  My second cup I tried 2 sticks and it was a little better, but for the price, I'd much rather just buy chai tea bags.<br /><br />All in all, don't expect it to taste the way it smells.  Far too weak in just a simple black tea, but smells divine still sealed up!

review/summary: Portable Health
review/text: I agree with other reviewers about Agave in general and also specifically this product.  Know that I have a pretty big sweet tooth, and thanks to Agave I feel I'm slowly taming it.  I do find Agave to be sufficiently satisfying -- with the right amount.  And it makes me feel very good to know I'm not jacking up my blood sugar level with sugar, and that I'm not putting sugar (which I increasingly think of as poison) into my body.  But you do have to use around the same amount as regular sugar, maybe sometimes less, sometimes more.  Various mfgs. of the product claim you can use less.  I have not found this to be the case.<br /><br />Regarding the sticks specifically, you do have to squeeze fairly hard and repeatedly to get it all out, and inevitably some gets on your fingers.  However, given the above pluses, in the absence of anything better I'm willing to settle for the drawbacks as opposed to putting sugar or -- quel horreur -- artificial sweetners into my body when I'm away from home.

review/summary: Deceptive Term = "Sticks"
review/text: When I ordered these, based on the description, I thought the honey was somehow hardened into stick-form and thus would 'melt' into a cup of hot tea.  I was surprised when I discovered these sticks were actually thin plastic straws filled with honey!  There is no way I'm going to insert a plastic straw into a hot cup of tea. I'm not sure it would work anyway; I suppose you could cut open each end and then blow the honey in the tea.  Does Stash think you're going to sip on these straws?  I don't know what the company was thinking when they produced this product, other than as a candy to be eaten.<br /><br />I believe the term "stick" does not accurately describe this product and is misleading.  I doubt it's intentional, however.  The Stash Tea Company is an excellent company and has many high quality teas and products.<br /><br />The honey flavored with chai spices is good enough but frankly, it it a very expensive way to buy honey.  Better to buy a jar and flavor it yourself.  I wound up using these Chai Honey Sticks by cutting open one end and pressing out the honey into a tea cup/pot, which was messy and time consuming.<br /><br />I love Stash tea... drink it every morning.  But this product is a bust and I would never purchase it again.

review/text: I bought this to try on two registered Maine Coon kittens, as one is picky and refused all previous dry foods.  I feed wet food several times a day and keep dry food available at all times.  To my surprise, they both love this dry food.  For a lower priced dry food, it has exceptional ingredients.  Fat content is high, but that's good for active, growing kittens.  I love hearing them crunching between wet food feedings.  At 12 months, I'll try to find a different dry food they like, but for now I'm a very happy camper.

review/summary: Two Siberians like it!
review/text: When we brought home two 3-month-old purebred Siberian kittens, this was the dry food I picked for them.  Wolfram, the boy, prefers this to his wet canned food!  Catmium, the girl, likes wet food better, but she'll eat this when she's hungry and there's no wet food.  (They also eat the kitten versions of Fancy Feast wet canned food; it used to be 1 can per cat daily, but we've cut down to half a can per cat daily.  Catmium was gobbling her wet food and then eating Wolfram's, and Wolfram was letting her, preferring to eat dry food; he likes the crunchiness.  Catmium didn't need two cans a day, so now we just put out one can a day and they eat dry food if they don't get enough of the wet.)  They are growing quickly, and they are adorable little furballs full of energy.  Their coats are soft and luxurious, too.

review/summary: not what I ordered
review/text: When I ordered this chutney, it was supposed to be "Sun" brand, where mangoes were the first ingredient.  What I was sent was "Patak" brand, where sugar is the first ingredient, and which is quite sweet for a chutney.  I don't feel I got what I ordered.  I have bought Patak brand in the past and didn't like it much.

review/text: I bought this candy for my son, who spent time in France, and came to like it.  We couldn't find much here locally, and nothing like the violet candy he had tasted, so I took a chance.  He said it is the same he purchased in France, so he is happy.  So am I!  It was well packaged, which was a concern, since it's in a glass jar.  I received the item very quickly.  I'm very satisfied.

review/summary: Tastes horrible!
review/text: I just bought this soup today at my local grocer, brought it back to work with me, heated it up and almost spit out my first bite.  The taste is so sweet, and it's not just the aftertaste as a previous commenter said.  This soup is horrible!  It tastes nothing like true Cajun red beans and rice.  I tried complaining via the Healthy Choice website today, only to have their servers fail twice before it wiped my complaint.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS SOUP.<br /><br />I have never been so dissatisfied with food before I ate this soup.  I'm the type that will say, "eh, it doesn't taste good, but I bought it, so I'll eat it," but miraculously I ate three spoonfuls before I gave up and tossed the rest in the trash.  Tomato puree is one of the first three ingredients (high sugar), followed closely by evaporated cane juice?  Who puts evaporated cane juice in red beans and rice?  Healthy Choice, that's who!  Hey, Healthy Choice, maybe if you didn't add the evaporated cane juice this soup may very well be worth eating, and would probably have a few calories less than it already does.<br /><br />P.S. I bought this soup today not because it was "healthy" or "low fat" but because it didn't have wheat in it.  SORRY GLUTEN FREE PEOPLE. THIS SOUP SUCKS.

review/text: It is mostly broth, with the advertised 3/4 cup of vegetables. However, each cup contains about 3 tortellinis. This is supposed to be a double serving bowl, but 1.5 tortellini isn't much of a meal. It tastes good and I like all the veggies (plus it has low sodium) but I really wish they would include a couple more tortellini.

review/summary: Delicious, all natural and allergy free treats!
review/text: Indie Candy's gummies are absolutely delicious. I buy them for my kids and I can't wait to have one myself! They are soft and so flavorful. Whenever I visit the store (I live a little ways away), I get orders from at least 5 friends of all the things they want me to get for them. It has quickly become our favorite candy store! I especially appreciate that their candy will never include artificial food coloring or flavors. I can trust that the candy is natural and the owner is so helpful. She will always tell me where the ingredients came from and exactly what is in them. She and her employees have been very easy to work with. My friends who have children with severe nut, gluten and milk allergies LOVE Indie. All their chocolate and candy is made in a big 8 free facility - no cross contamination!!

review/summary: Excellent Tea
review/text: I love this tea.  I first discovered the pleasures of chai after attending a yoga class.  The yoga instructor made tea for us.  I wanted to make some on my own, and I tried many brands and recipes, including making it from scratch.  This is the best tea I found. In my opinion, steeping tea bags makes a weak, bland tea.  You really need to use loose tea and cook it according to the directions.  I use half and half for the milk, and it makes a rich, spicy tea.  Additionally, for the sweetener, I use maple syrup instead of honey or sugar.  It might sound odd, but the maple syrup blends with the chai spices much better.  If you want to make authentic chai (instead of using some kind of processed powdery mix), try this one.

review/text: Hoping there is no MSG in this, this tastes extremely good when i make it with toasted fish. I used to eat fried chicken and other chicken dishes when i was young and had no idea they tasted so good because of this spice mix. Now i know when i remember about the great aroma and lip smacking flavor this imparts to my fish.  This is also good in soups and gives you a kind of addiction that you will want to put this spice mix into everything you eat.<br />Would like to add this will make anyone eat any kind of meat or vegetable, in my case I prefer costly red salmon in a can but pink salmon is so cheaper and now with Five spice pink salmon toast feels as enjoyable as anything else i have eaten.
