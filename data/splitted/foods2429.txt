review/summary: Nice and hot! Good substitute for pizza-shop pepper flakes
review/text: Bought these for the guy who can never have anything hot enough. He eats fresh habaneros like apples (seeds and all!). The only pepper flakes that make him happy are Penzey's Extra Hot Red Pepper Flakes. But finally there's something hotter. Granted, habaneros have a 'fruitier' nose than the red chiles in traditional flakes. That stands true with these, making them slightly more versatile, but limiting in the authentic-italian arena. We're happy with this purchase and will be back for more. The container is one of those restaurant-style, large clear plastic shelf-containers with the red flip-top lid, not a "jar" as the title says.

review/summary: HABANERO, FLAKES,(DRIED) 10 oz. jar
review/text: Bought this jar of crushed peppers to add to my peppers collection but it hasn't stayed on the shelf for long.<br />I practically use this on every meal.<br />As impressed as I am with this sellers quality of product I am also disappointed that the price has gone up so much.<br />Guess it's due to inflation in the volatile economy. Anyways, the product is great!<br />I did try to share with my brother and mom and they didn't much care for the "fruity" flavor.<br />Good thing it was just a taste for them and that means more for me.<br />If you are tired or "burned out" with buying those intimation pepper flakes to pour over your spaghetti<br />then I would recommend you try HABANERO, FLAKES,(DRIED) 10 oz. jar<br />Believe me, when I say 10 oz is not gonna last too long if you use it in almost every meal like I do.

review/summary: Only for true hot pepper lovers
review/text: These flakes are incredibly hot and well milled so a small amount envelopes a large amount of food in very spicy pepper.  Even if you enjoy pepper in every meal, it would probably take a few years to finish the entire 10 oz. jar.  I always sneeze as I am cooking with it, not sure why.  I strongly suggest these flakes to true hot pepper lovers, but warn others to proceed with caution.

I put heat on EVERYTHING and I was looking for a good HOT substitute to crushed red pepper, and weak green chilis for my pizza and, well, just about everything else.  What I ended up finding was a glorious source for the HEAT that I love.  I have been mixing this with everything!  Chicken, eggs, pizza (of course), pasta, etc. - even adding it to green chili to kick it up a few ~10,000 scovilles!  ;-)  a few months later - time for another order!<br /><br />If you like hot (you must if you're reading this) - then you cant go wrong here - This is pure concentrated hellfire heat in a jumbo sized spice container - its GREAT!<br /><br />If you are asking yourself if this might be too hot, then it probably is.....

review/summary: Not the soup it used to be
review/text: I eat the Health Valley brand Lentil and Carrot soup often. When I found it on this site I was happy to buy the case because of the better price and it qualified for free shipping. When I opened the first can I realized something was wrong because the soup didn't look like it usually did.<br /><br />It was more brown and had no visible pieces of tomato or celery. I thought perhaps I had made a mistake and ordered a different version of the soup. I double checked the label and compared it to an empty can I had in my recycling box. The ingredients were different but they are both called fat-free Lentil and Carrot soup by Health Valley.<br /><br />I visited Health Valley's website and learned that they have changed the recipe and made it 100% organic vs. 70% organic. It contains tomato paste instead of chopped tomatoes. Rice starch has been added and the seasonings have changed.<br /><br />I'm a picky eater who prefers to avoid veggies but tries to eat them and this soup (w/added whole wheat couscous) was one way to have a healthy lunch. I ate the new version and added some steamed broccoli and spinach leaves and a few chunks of tomatoes to make it less brown. Without the added veggies it is more of a bean soup and not a veggie soup except for the few diced carrots.<br /><br />Also the protein per serving used to be 10gm and is now 8gm. I would have given the old style more stars due to the added variety of veggies.

review/text: I was surprised at how crispy and tasty these flax crackers were.  I am disappointed that the price has increased $5 from when I last ordered.  You have to like onion and garlic if you want to enjoy these crackers because you can smell them as soon as you open the pouch.  They are delicious with cheese and taste good dipped into salsa.  Very filling and good to take to work, if your co-workers don't mind a bit of garlic/onion smell.  But the price is now going to cause me to experiment elsewhere:(

review/summary: Tasty and satisfying, but perhaps a bit pricey
review/text: These crackers are irregularly sized (1"x2" approximately in most cases), rather sturdy (good for dipping in hummus) tasty and satisfying.  They also are a more convenient way I think to get flax seed than sprinkling it on cereal, fruit etc.  I find in those case the seed tends to stick to the bowl/plate even after going through the dishwasher, and forgetting to sprinkle it on in the first place is more likely than forgetting to snack on some tasty crackers and spread!  Only down-side is that they're a bit pricey.  Price is offset somewhat by the substantial nature of the cracker - you're not likely to eat as many - but definitely it is more cost effective to buy flax seed specifically if cost is a primary factor.

review/summary: Great to snack on it's own - for Garlic & onion lovers only!
review/text: I received this order on time, in good shape and the crackers were fresh and very delicious.  I ended up skipping my dinner because I opened up one package to try and finished the whole thing right out of the bag before I knew what happened!<br /><br />But be warned, the garlic and onions are very strong - just the way we garlic & onion lovers prefer.  But you definitely do not want to eat it before you go out on a date.  And the rest of your family will be able to smell the evidence of your consumption soon enough. ;-)<br /><br />There are only 5 ingredients & all are 100% Organic & Kosher: Golden Flaxseed, Tomato, Garlic, Onion, Celtic Sea Salt.<br /><br />Crackers are certified vegan, Raw, Gluten Free, Soy Free, Nut Free, Dairy Free.<br /><br />Like any seed, this does have natural & healthy fat grams but unlike commercial chips, it does not leave any salt or a greasy mess on your hands.  And don't forget to drink lots of fluids as it suggests on the bag.<br /><br />If you're looking for a new healthy snack, look no more.  I know I just found it.<br /><br />My only small gripe is that this brand "Foods Alive" has about 8 different flavors and most are avaiable at a discount PLUS FREE "super saver" shipping but only this GARLIC & ONION flavor costs more & charges for shipping.

review/summary: Quick easy way to make tasty muffins
review/text: Krusteaz One Step Muffin Mix is very easy to use. You preheat the oven to 400 degrees and use either non-stick cooking spray on your muffin tin or use paper liners (I prefer the liners). To make the muffins you first loosen the dry mix by shaking the container sideways for 15 seconds. Next you add � cup of water to the container, replace the lid securely, turn the container over and shake vigorously for 60 seconds. After that, you pour the batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling them 2/3 full. Finally, you bake the muffins for 15 -17 minutes - after they are done baking let them cool in the pan for five minutes before removing them. The mix makes six muffins.<br /><br />I love the convenience of the Krusteaz One Step Muffin Mix. It is a quick solution to making muffins - all you need to do is add water so you don't have to worry about needing eggs or other ingredients. I also like the convenience of not having to use anything but the container and muffin pan - there is much less to clean up (which makes these muffins a perfect solution if you have unexpected visitors). The muffin container and lid (not the label) are both recyclable which is another bonus. The muffins come out nice and big - I was pleasantly surprised at how big they were. They also taste quite nice. When I make them I like to take them into work for a breakfast snack.<br /><br />Krusteaz One Step Muffin Mix is a quick easy way to make tasty muffins.

If you get in the mood for muffins, or have company but no eggs &/or oil, all you need for this is add water and shake ( however it is hard to get the last 1/8  cup out of 'jar'/'can' so may want to pour the dry mix in a bowl first if you want every little bit oh the mix) the n pour into muffin tins or maker.  They tast good, if not great, but are so easy since you only need water.  For me it makes a nice breakfast when I want easy and/or have no eggs.  Wish the would add banana nut, etc. to the line up.

review/summary: Great, but not for baking
review/text: I'm trying to reduce my sugar intake and bought XyloSweet to use in smoothies, shakes and cereal. It worked fabulously: no strange taste, dissolved like real sugar, no unpleasant gastrointestinal issues. Sweet but not cloying or overpowering. Since xylosweet is granulated, I decided to try it in baking. This was a total failure. I used a brownie recipe that is typically very forgiving (In the past, I've replaced the sugar with honey, used 2/3 the sugar and substituted whole wheat flour with minimal differences in taste or texture). This time, I substituted only 25% of the sugar with xylosweet (1/4 cup xylosweet and 3/4 cup white sugar). The batter tasted fine. In the oven, the top of the brownies was extremely shiny. The finished brownies were dry, cakey (instead of fudgey) and lacked the slightly crackly crust they usually had. They tasted plasticky and smelled a bit like playdough. Even the extra chocolate chips I threw in couldn't save them. I tried to eat them, but ended up throwing most of the batch out. They were truly inedible, even though the xylosweet was a very small part of the batter's total volume. So, I will definitely keep using xylosweet for drinks and cereal but I'm not going to waste ingredients on a baking project again.

review/text: My otherwise healthy daughter started getting caries at about 18 months. Giving her xylitol-based cheming-gum after every meal or snack seems to have stopped them (no noticeable developments 15 months later; we also paid more attention to brushing and dental visits). Next step was to find a replacement sugar and chose Xlear's Xylo-Sweet. The product tastes better than sugar, is just as sweet, and if the Finnish and other Scandinavian dental authorities recommend xylitol for caries control, I ain't going to argue.

It's amazing! so i hopped online & did more research on xyltol & read that it is used as a nasal wash & to clear up ear infections.

review/summary: Good substitute for baking for diabetics
review/text: I just bought this and also received some fresh zucchini.  My husband and I are both type 2 diabetics and so miss not being able to have muffins and cakes that require the "weight" of sugar.  I make great sugar free pies  with Splenda, but cookies and muffins and cakes require the weight and bulk of sugar.  The xylitol worked great!  I used  a standard recipe, but subsituted the xylitol for the entire amount of the sugar and then used white whole wheet flour instead of white flour (white flour is also not so great for diabetics!)The brand I used was Xyla, but I noticed it is considerably cheaper her at Amazon, so will be purchasing more soon.  The only concern I had with it is the 1 lb bag was about 8 dollars at the health food store and using the 1 2/3 cup called for in the recipe used it almost all up.  But then it made 24 muffins, so that is quite a bit.  I would give it 5 stars except for the cost!

review/summary: I love it but it never gets here--why does Amazon not have a 'Choose Shipper' box?
review/text: I love this stuff.  kills bacteria, cures earaches, sore throats, etc.  In fact, I rely on it as a medicine around my house.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I never know whether I will get my orders here at Amazon.  In my building, some shippers (you, Fed Ex., and I have had trouble with Ontrac as well)  make "valid" attempts to deliver but they never really try to get in the building.  Whereas UPS always manages, and the USPS gets there sooner or later.<br /><br />It would also be nice to be able to "waive" the right to delivery confirmation, or agree in advance it was received if they say so (but do not tell them!)  so the USPS could just leave it here rather than do the pink slip dance a thon.<br /><br />I have called Amazon I have searched there is NO WAY to express a preference or shipping info, such as "my mailbox is 11 by 5 by 5 inches"  "leave on top"  "please use UPS or USPS if necessary."<br /><br />But the xylito is great.  Since I am a Prime member, I just reorder it after Fedex returns it.  Do I get the feeling they know this?  YES I DO.  They are rippiing off Amazon in this case, and Amazon does not lose enough money to care I suppose.<br /><br />Sure wish I did not have this itchy feeling in my ears and throat that XYLITOL will cure!!!  (and it is good for the teeth.  oh, and it is sweet with a cool aftertaste, literally.

review/summary: OK-maybe.
review/text: The product is not as sweet as sugar(25-35% less) but does not have the slightly bitter taste of artificial sweeteners. Since it only has about 25% less calories than regular sugar, I not sure it is worth the price or effort. It does say it fights tooth decay rather than promote it.

review/summary: The Best Substitute
review/text: I have tried all sugar substitutes and used Splenda for several years.  I had to give up Splenda due to a side<br />effect and someone recommended Xylitol.  This product is great, I use it in everything.  It tastes good, is a<br />natural sweetner, and has no bad after taste or side effect.  I don't really bake, so I cannot attest to its use<br />in baking but it is the best in everything else.

review/text: Sweeter than sugar, no effect on blood sugar if you are a diabetic.  Baking, cooking, coffee or tea, anything you need sugar for you can substitute Xylosweet.  You don't need as much so go slowly, sweetening as you go.  I made a fantastic apple pie with this stuff.  Will definitely add this to my monthly purchases.

I never would have bought a Keurig brewer because the K-cups are expensive, but I got a free one so I am always seeking out deals on K-cups.  Newman's Own is one of my favorites but can be $16 for an 18-pack, close to $1 a cup!!  This was a deal I couldn't pass up.  Delivery was fast, and the product is just what I expected.

review/text: This is a very good tea as far as teabags go...traditionally loose tea is always better quality than teabag teas, But this is the exception...being organic as well as the least processed compared to other teas(White tea is the least processed of all teas)...teabags impart a subtle paper flavor that loose teas are free of...these bags are a cut above other teabagged teas(the subtle teabag flavor is less of a factor in this instance)... and are an excellent choice in leu of saving money...It took about six weeks to finally get delivered, but it was worth the weight...This one is a no brainer...!!!

review/summary: such a special gem, this one!
review/text: after reading the other reviews, i'm confused and don't think that anyone was talking about THIS TEA! (sounded like most comments pertained to prince of peace green tea, and don't have anything to do with the instant dong quai and red date tea that i clicked on...that being said, this is a remarkable tea...it's delicious, it's instant (so you don't have to wait for it to steep) and it's really good for you...i just love the taste of this, but then again - i enjoy the uniquely-bitter flavor of dong quai (but this isn't bitter, it's yummy!)...for those who don't know, dong quai is considered to be "ginseng for women" beceause it's very high in vit B12 and helps to keep women from becoming anemic (due the their monthly cycle)...it also is said to help regulate irregular periods, when used on a daily basis...that said, this tea is special because it helps to "draw one's energy" downwards (and the red date, adds to this effect in that red is the color of the 1st chakra)...in other words, this tea has aphrodisiac qualities and will create pleasnt feelings when taken before bed (and it's "good for you" and it tastes good and it's a snap to make)...so what's there to be quibbling about?

review/summary: After at least a year drinking this tea, some thoughts.
review/text: My household has this tea stocked up at all times.. not to say it's my favorite tea, but it's my favorite day to day tea. We tend to drink Green Tea for its health benefits and as Green Teas go this one is affordable and fairly high quality for tea bag types. A few notes.. you have to be fairly careful about steeping this tea, it doesn't have a whole lot of tolerance from "crisp and delicious" to "overpowering and slightly off-putting". I guess I attribute that to the freshness of the tea. I'm not sure. I've had a lot different results with loose tea in a ball and some herbal teas. While this tastes good when you get it right, if you forget the cup for a few minutes, it's not forgiving. That said, that's the only real drawback to this tea. Yes. I've had teas I would rate five stars, six if I could. Yes, they also cost 5-6x more than this easily for a quarter of the amount of tea. Bottom line, if you drink a lot of tea, this is a good brand to buy. If you don't drink a whole lot and would rather buy something really high quality for the few times you do partake of it, I'd look elsewhere.

review/summary: Good tea, very gingery
review/text: This tea has a wonderfully strong ginger flavor.  The bags come individually wrapped in foil packets.  It steeps fast and the resulting mug of tea is murky and delightfully aromatic.  I love it and will undoubtedly use every bag in the next month or so.  The one thing I think anyone buying this product should be aware of is that they add stevia to the bags.  I am usually not a fan of stevia (to me it has a bitter aftertaste) but it was not overwhelming here.

review/summary: Good tea wish it came in loose tea too.
review/text: I am sensitive to Caffeine and supposedly the White teas have 1/3 approx. what Black teas contain. And about half of what the green teas contain. This probably varies all over the place however. Often a decaf tea isn't. If you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks. I find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas. My husband and I can't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it's astringent properties. But we temper that with milk or 100% Cranberry Juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered. Good both hot or iced. Looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags. Look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the Prince of Peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable. I hope they don't up the price just because everyone else's white tea is higher. I wish it was available in a loose tea too. A smooth flavored good tasting tea that reminds me of teas I had as a child and at Chinese restaurants. Beats anything I can buy in local supermarkets.<br /><br />I did try the organic version and no way. This one is better for some reason. Stronger and overall a better product even the bag it'self is better than the organic's.

I'm not a Pu-erh expert and I am looking for something as authentic as I can get without paying an arm and a leg.  Can anyone suggest a good quality??

I lived in the St. Louis area for 50years before moving to Texas and this Imo's Italian Dressing is such a great taste of home.  Super on salads, as a marinate, a dipping sauce, basting sauce for crustini and so much more.

review/text: I just love this salad dressing--as well as the pizza--from Imo's.  I stock up on it when I get back to the St. Louis area, but was very pleased to find it on-line; especially from a vendor that didn't require a $75 minimum order.  It's taste is unique; sweet, but not too sweet.  Just the perfect compliment for olives and feta and/or mozarella and whatever else you want to toss in your salad.  And it beats the heck out of the gazillion types of Ranch that proliferate the market now. I WILL buy more and maybe get around to being more creative by using it in appetizers.

One cup (serving) is only 200 calories (5 from fat) which is low fat as claimed.  Only 480 mg of sodium (20%) which isn't bad for this type of dish.  43g carbs and 7g protein.  It does have a teriyaki flavor and while not great teriyaki, it's not bad at all and probably better than average for microwavable "instant" style foods.<br /><br />Not my favorite McDougall's meal, but not bad and I will probably order again as the noodles are very good for this type product.

review/summary: Amazing peppers if they come unbroken
review/text: These are so good but they often come leaking or broken jars. They raised the price by 10 to... I love these so much but the extra hike in price and the odds of them coming broken or leaking scares me. I am always tempted to try ordering again. The other stuff this company sells is not all that but these are amazing! I thought they were hot after a few peppers it really kicked me a bit. Not the hottest stuff ever but these days these are up there in heat. If only i could find these locally.

review/summary: Just like a Chicklet!
review/text: I actually just bought this gum from our new dentist's office today!  I wanted to look it up on amazon since it was so expensive - [...] for 100 pieces.  It's currently unavailable here, but I was sure I could find the same container in a health food store.  I just couldn't believe the price was so high.<br /><br />As for the gum itself, I bought it specifically for my 6-year-old daughter who has been diagnosed with a mouth full of cavities.  We each tried a piece today and to my surprise, it was good!  When you open the top and inhale the scent, your mouth actually does water!  The gum has a hard shell, like a Chicklet.  It is 1/2 inch x 3/4 inch in dimension.  The gum was tasty, not too strong or minty.  She chewed it for at least 30 minutes, and I had it longer.  It did not lose flavor at all!<br /><br />The container is a #2 plastic and the ingredients are: Xylitol, gum base, natural flavor (spearmint oil), vegetable glycerin, gum arabic, soy lecithin and beeswax.  Apparently, Xylitol is highly toxic for dogs - FYI.  The recommended usage is to chew 6-10 grams per day, which is about 6-10 pieces per day.  The container says the gum has &lt;1 gram of Xylitol in each piece.<br /><br />The purpose of this gum is to help kill bacteria that lives in your mouth.  Xylitol is a natural sugar derived from plants and prevents bacteria from sticking to tooth enamel, while stimulating saliva production.  Saliva nautralizes our mouth after an acid attack from food.  Most other gums have Xylitol listed as third or farther down on the ingredient list.<br /><br />If you have trouble locating the product on amazon or locally, here's the company info: 1-800-223-8225 or [...]

review/summary: Aromat - our favorite indispensible flavor enhancer
review/text: We were getting desperate! During the 30 years since we left England to live in the States, we have been unable to purchase Aromat here, and have resorted to having friends bring suitcases full of it to us when coming to visit. Now that it is available online through Amazon, we are delighted. We use it in every single meal we cook - wonderful on BBQd steaks, in casseroles, all kinds of sauces, but our favorite is tomato salad - thick-sliced tomatoes, drizzled with a mix of garlic oil, (lots of crushed garlic with black pepper and aromat) and topped with grated Romano cheese. Delish!

review/summary: Failed to see the Magic!
review/text: Bought 12 of them based on fellow reviewers opinions. As an all purpose seasoning so far does a fair job. I have not noticed any greatness so far in this product. I have used it in many different types of food and it is okey. I use several herbs and some spices in cooking and thought this one would be above average but like I said it is average tasting. Hope I am not missing the point here but I did expect a fantastic all around seasoning. I guess the question to ask is: What makes it so special to those reviewers that gave it so many praises? Do not regret the purchase, still have plenty of time to decide if I would buy this product again. They said it worked great with steamed vegetables but I can not endorse that. I tried it on steamed vegetables and I still needed to add a little more to the plate which defeated the idea of just using Knorr Aromat All Purpose Seasoning. I thought I would forego the Mayonnaise but it was not so. 3 to 3.5 Stars at best!

It's such a great seasoning just on a baked potato, cream sauces, soups, a chicken breast, or anything at all.  I'd relied on it for ages and had no idea it was at all hard to come by until I left the east coast.  Now I stockpile.

The seasoning taste is unique and really adds to the flavor of whatever I am eating.  It has helped me to eliminate sauces and butter by giving me the additional flavor that I was missing from the higher calorie alternatives.  Highly recommended if you are not on a sodium-restricted diet program.

I now live in San Antonio and have to make a special trip to a "specialty store" and was delighted to find it on-line at comparative pricing. I send it in care packages to two out-of-state daughters and use it (with the Meat Seasoning) as a small hostess gift for my Bunco Club. Oh, yes, it works wonderfully well on everything from scrambled eggs to stews, chicken, and just about anything you would season with salt.

review/summary: Aromat Seasoning - Best Ever

review/summary: Thanks, Amazon, for having my favorite seasoning.
review/text: Like another reviewer, I was used to toting it back from Europe, because getting it locally is a hit-or-miss thing.  Now, thanks to Amazon, I'm in MSG heaven!  Yes, if you're against MSG, then stay away.  As for me, as I type I'm having Bristol Farms egg salad, sprinkled with Aromat, with apple-cured bacon on the side.  An Atkins pigout.  Another is my dynamite guacamole, the secret of which is ground cumin and Aromat.  Later, I'll break the Atkins with a big bowl of white popcorn, popped in palm and sesame oil, tossed with a few dashes of Maggi and sprinkled with Aromat.  Aromat is about taste and, as the name suggests, smell.  It's a guilty pleasure.
