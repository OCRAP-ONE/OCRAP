review/summary: Incredible Stuff
review/text: Just finished a bowl of soup with 3 drops of this sauce in it.  Should have used 2 drops.  Scalp and hair now damp with sweat as a reaction to this incredible hot sauce.  As someone else mentioned, this hot sauce is considered mid-range on the heat scale, but use it sparingly unless you're into pain.  Unlike another reviewer, I like the flavor and like the heat.  Several drops of this in a pot of soup or chili produces amazing results.<br /><br />What you likely don't want to do is to try a dime size serving of this on a cracker like my 22 year old son did.  He had been bragging about his pepper tolerance, so he had to try it.  After first eating it, he blurted out, "see, this isn't that hot".  About a minute later, the color was coming into his cheeks and he proceeded to drink about 8 glasses of milk to kill the burn.  Yep ... he won't do that again.  :-)

review/summary: Too hot and Very Little Flavor
review/text: I purchased this item as a gift for a good friend along with several other hot sauces.  This was the only one that I was displeased with.  First off the sauce is just too hot.  I know what you are going to say...  but the truth is I love hot sauce, and have only come across one or two that are just too hot to enjoy.  This is so far beyond hot that I feel it's abusive.  It was so strong that my lips were red and swollen for several hours.  That was only from an amount the size of the head of a pin.<br /><br />All that said, it would still be worth cooking with it, if it had a good flavor, but it doesn't.  The initial flavor, before the heat kicks in, is nothing more than molasses. This gives it an unpleasant cloying taste that does not go well with the off the charts fire.<br /><br />If you need something for self defense, this would make a good choice.  But I would not cook with it.

review/text: "This one caught us by surprise! We don't know of any other pod maker that has this flavor and it's really good! We love the way it smells - the way it tastes - and the fact it is just plain different. Most pod people are ignoring the flavored sector to this extent - and it's nice to have a cup of really flavored coffee - meaning - a rich chocolate and raspberry flavored cup of coffee is hard to come by and this one is very good." singleservecoffee.com

review/summary: Great tasting coffee for my Senseo!
review/text: I received my package via UPS in a reasonable amount of time.  The coffee itself is smooth and very flavorful, but not fake-tasting.  However,I did waste a few pods trying to perfect the use.  For some reason, a couple of cups came out really weak.  So, I referred to the Senseo handbook for a hint.  Now, when I put a pod in, I make sure to smooth it out on top and make sure it is in evenly and snugly.  That seems to have solved the problem.

review/text: Warning to dog owners! This product has caused many dogs, including mine, diarrhea, vomiting, and seizures.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />My history with this product:<br /><br />My dog was very ill for 3 days: violent diarrhea and vomiting. Called vet after first day, they instructed me to keep him on a bland diet, and to bring him in if this persisted more than 3 days. Luckily, he got better and I didn't have to take him in. I thought, maybe it's just my dog and he has a sensitive stomach?<br /><br />I went to the web to research the product and found others had experienced the same thing. So I wondered...why is this product still on the market? I contacted Purina, and after no luck with them (who claimed they never heard of any complaints), I contacted the FDA, which currently has this product under surveillance.<br /><br />By the way, my dog is not a toy breed, he's a 20 lb. mutt. So say what you want to say about the latest 'not meant for toy breed' disclaimer on the package, he doesn't fall into that category.<br /><br />Sure, some dogs can tolerate this treat, but why take a chance on your pet's health and life?

review/text: Oregon Chai is the only concentrate my wife and I will buy, so this is not a critique of the product, but the cost of this particular package.<br /><br />You'd think buying the larger container, in a super concentrate (2 oz. per serving) would be lower in cost per serving. This half gallon of super concentrate costs 90� per serving, but the quart-sized package costs 71� per serving.<br /><br />So save your money, buy the 5-pack of quart packages.

That is much more expensive, but good for taking to the office or on the road.

review/text: This item came highly recommended for someone who is pre-diabetic in need of a low carb healthy snack. This snack is about $4.25 for ten ounces in stores. When I found them for $2.82 a bag when you purchase a case of 12 I went for it. The taste is great however about a forth of each bag is crumbs. I got a pound of crumbs total out of three bags. Whether this is from shipping or manufacturing I don't know. I won't purchase on line again.

They are thin and crispy, nice and salty. When I went to reorder, these weren't available, so I bought the Classic Yellow Corn, but we don't like those at all-too thick and have a funny flavor.  We're glad to be back to the extra thin.

review/summary: Delicious, Healthy Chips
review/text: If you're a chip lover, take heart. There are healthy options out there to soothe your cravings. RW Garcia has a soy flaxseed chip with no trans fats, no gluten, with fiber and omega 3s.<br /><br />I've tried many different chip varieties over the years. Many of them are very cardboardy - they try their best, but they sacrifice a lot of flavor in order to keep the junk stuff out. I'm really pleased that in modern times they seem to have figured out the balance of ingredients to make this work!<br /><br />First, this chip set is fully organic, including certification. The ingredient list is rather clear. Corn. Soy grits. Flaxseed. Corn oil, sea salt, water, lime. You know exactly what is in here! There's no wheat, no gluten. No cholesterol.<br /><br />Ah, but how does it taste? If it's like cardboard, it doesn't matter how good it is for you - you're not going to eat it. Luckily, it is rather good! I am *especially* impressed how it tastes nice and salty, but each serving only has 50mg of salt - i.e only 2% of your daily salt intake!! This is incredibly low for a chip or snack food.<br /><br />For other stats, there is 13g of carbs, minus the 4g of fiber leaves 9g of net carbs. There are 8g of fat (1g is saturated) and 140 calories. This is for about 7 large chips.<br /><br />These chips have 6% iron, 2% Vitamin A and 2% calcium. So the serving is not going to give you enough to really worry about skipping your multivitamins, but heck, it's a nice bonus.<br /><br />Now, I don't recommend sitting down and eating your way through an entire bag of these at one sitting :) The whole bag would still give you 90g of carbs, or 1400 calories. That's not a healthy way to get your energy! But there are many times that you want a snack and want something crunchy. Fiber is of course VERY good for you, too. If you have some healthy salsa, it's a good way to get some good veggies into you on a chip base that has very little salt, has good ingredients and is tasty.

review/text: I have purchased these in the past from other websites and love them.  I was excited to find such a deal on the price per bag by purchasing the case through amazon, although that is a lot of chips!  I ordered one plain and one spicy.  The plain were delicious and fresh.  The spicy were stale.  So now I have a case of stale chips and a case of fresh chips...thus the gamble with ordering in quantity I suppose.  The chips themselves are wonderful, nutty and a much healthier and lower carb/higher fiber alternative to tortilla chips.  I eat them plain, with salsa or make nachos with them.  We even crumble them over taco salad.

review/summary: Fair Anchovy Paste...
review/text: I use anchovy paste for Caesar salad and have tried several brands.  The Alessi brand seemed "hard" by comparison, a bit weak in taste, and was more difficult to mix.  As I ordered 10, I will use them up but will probably not order this brand again.  I also had trouble opening the tube with the cap as usual and had to get a knife.

review/summary: RIPOFF
review/text: Look elsewhere for a better DEAL on Amazon by buying bulk than this ripoff OVERPRICED item.<br />Besides, these contain stems/partial stems, which not only cheapens the price but wounds up with uneven done-ness. If you want best quality, your best bet would be to look for stem-free (caps only) variety even though they tend to cost more. From one gourmet chef to another, hope it helps.

review/summary: Fresh, fabulous raw cashews.  Quick delivery too!
review/text: We use raw cashews to make cashew milk.  These are large, mostly whole, plump, fresh cashews.  They are very clean.  Other cashews I've used have to be washed several times before soaking.  These only need a quick rinse. I have ordered these twice and will continue to do so.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Delivery A+.  Cashews D-.
review/text: These came super-fast, thanks to Amazon's Prime shipping and I was so excited to open a bag of them and experiment with some raw recipes.<br />The nuts themselves were in good shape- very few fractured pieces.<br />Then I opened the first bag.  The cashews smell like damp wool in a health a food store populated by sweaty folks.<br />Yuck.<br />I decided that I would soak them (as is common in many raw recipes) and see if that, and a number of rinses with fresh, clean water would help.<br />It didn't.<br />I decided to go ahead and make a simple recipe with a cup of the soaked cashews to see if that wet, sweaty knit-at-woodstock-in-a-downpour smell would permeate or if it would be hidden.  It still came through loud and clear.  I had assumed they were safe to eat, as they didn't smell rancid, and the smell wasn't one I would associate with mold or mildew, but just a smell that I really don't like (no offense to sheep, but I just don't like that sheepy-wooly smell)...<br />Also, these Cashews do not have an origin on the bag or label.  A friend had just alerted me to controversy regarding cashew harvest and processing in Vietnam, so I was curious to see where these came from...  (you can use a search engine for 'Blood' Cashews for more information)<br />I'm disappointed.  I was hoping I found a reliable source of reasonably priced cashews, but I've nicknamed these "Sheep Nuts" (not to be confused with non-vegetarian "Lamb Fries")....<br />The search continues....

review/text: These cashews are very good quality and the price is hard to beat.<br /><br />I have used them for cooking, baking, making vegan products (they're a great base for making vegan sour cream or mayo), granola, and just roasted them for a quick snack. Throw a handful in the toaster oven for a few minutes and voila!<br /><br />They store very well. I keep one bag in the fridge and one in the freezer, which does nothing to change the taste or texture. They're still as fresh as when I first got them.

review/summary: Love this tea!
review/text: I absolutely love this tea! I originally bought it in a small tin from the local grocery store and fell in love with it. It has a really nice light minty flavor and is perfect in the morning with breakfast to jump-start my day. I've also read that green tea and peppermint are both supposed to be very good digestion and metabolism aids. And maybe it's all in my head, but I really do feel wonderful when I drink a cup of this tea every day.<br /><br />When I was searching through Amazon and saw that they sell the Zhena's teas in bulk I was ecstatic. I bought this big bag of the mint tea as well as a three-pack of some of their other tea bag tins (these have also proved to be really great). I do not regret getting the gigantic bag, however it is definitely going to last me for a long time.<br /><br />The only downside is that it seems the tea is crushed a little more finely in this big bag than it was in the canister. This isn't really a huge problem, it just means that if you use a mesh diffuser you will have some tea debris floating in your cup. I'd recommend using those disposable tea sachets that you can buy now to avoid getting lots of tea leaves in your cup.

review/summary: Plump, juicy and oh, so addicting
review/text: While reading through one of those lists advising me of what I should be eating in order to get all of the vitamins, minerals, bioflavinoids, and existential approval necessary for perfect health, I found that I should be eating dried cherries.  On a regular basis.  As in daily.  So I went off to the store in search of dried cherries.  It turns out that not only are dried cherries really good for you.  They are also really expensive.  Or dry as sawdust with about as much taste.<br /><br />Oskri produces and packages some wonderful dried cranberries and I wondered if they did the same for cherries.  It turns out that Oskri's dried cherries are just as wonderful as the dried cranberries.  Like the cranberries, these are the whole fruit and not bits and pieces.  The cherries have been pitted and doused with a touch of apple juice for a bit of extra sweetener and then dried.  The end result is a dried cherry that retains the perfect amount of moisture and a deep rich flavor.<br /><br />I've been mixing my own "trail mix" (it should probably be called "office mix") using Brazil nut, pecans, almonds, hazelnuts, and these dried cherries.  Fabulous, healthy with just enough existential approval.

review/summary: Outstanding product - very good value
review/text: I had this for the first time yesterday, and was well satisfied with it.  Everything's precooked and the three packets easy to open, with clear microwave heating instructions.  A microwave bowl and lid are included, wrapped in saran-type wrap and enclosed in the outer cardboard sleeve, so it would be easy to fix in a break room at work.  (You do need to add 2 tablespoons of water before heating.)  The quantity of food was excellent, the textures were also, and so was the seasoning.  It was full flavored without over-harsh or unbalanced seasonings.  Once I discovered these qualities, I added a leftover sauteed pork chop and chowed down.  Cooked chicken or beef would also be very good.  And even without home-kitchen additions, it's enough food to be filling.  My only quibble is the laughable size of the plastic fork enclosed in the bowl - but that's a very small detail.  I've been a good home cook for many years and this surely does rate 5 stars.  I'm eager to try other flavors now too.

The only negative thing I find is the price... almost $6.00 for a 10 ounce jar!  According to the label, that's approximately 14 tablespoons of jelly.  Worth a try, but a bit too pricey for repeat purchases.

review/text: My poor JRT used to suffer with allergies. The canine reaction is to bite paws...she used to bite her paws until they were bloody. After many costly vet visits, cortisone, Atopica etc. I started her on an elimination diet. She turned out to be allergic to grain and avocado. Most common dog foods have corn, grains and avocado as fillers. Within weeks of switching to a grain free diet, her paws began to heal and regrow fur.<br /><br />There are more and more grain free dog foods on the market. Ziwi Peak is a softer dry food that she never turns down. We have even used this food to replace high calorie treats. Yes, it is expensive. Vet visits are far more expensive!

review/text: Our six year old 92 pound Old English Bulldog and his partner in crime our 6 month old puppy of the same breed - are the certified kings when it comes to destroying even the toughest toys.<br /><br />A long time fan of Nylabone products - they design toys with the dog in mind and not humans, and have been producing some of the finest, most durable dog toys here in the United States for over 50 years.<br /><br />A rarity among dog toys that beg for our attention with an army of adorable kitty cats, bunnies and an endless parade of cute toys.<br /><br />With the majority of them resembling road kill in a very short time.That said, we just knew this particular toy being made of the so rock solid Dura Chew material and scented like Bacon - they would be a huge hit.And boy, were they ever. Our Bulldogs simply LOVE this toy!<br /><br />Our oldest Bulldog "Harley" is finicky about toys and loses interest after a hours, but kept this chew bone in his mouth for hours - even walking around the house with it looking like he was puffing on a big fat ole' stogie<br /><br />Elvis our 6 month old Godzilla chewer couldn't leave it alone for one second - and managed to do some serious damage. What is more, Rawhide is processed with Formaldehyde and is fundamentally unhealthy for dogs - we stopped using rawhide toys years ago. But dogs do adore trying to un tie those knots.<br /><br />Nylabone has come up with a brilliant alternative with this giant chew toy.<br /><br />It's the thickest, heaviest  Nylabone toy I've seen - and it's great fun watching our dogs dragging this monster from room to room looking for perfect place to settle down into a chomping no holes barred chewing frenzy.<br /><br />Like most all Nylabone products these toys not only provide hours fun and hold up to even the most aggressive hardcore chewers - they clean their teeth of tarter and plaque and help keep them healthy and snow white.<br /><br />When our Vet asked how we kept Harley's teeth so prefect - we answered Nylabones!This toy is just Great and offers the Following benefits to Pooch and Human Alike:<br /><br />1) Molded in a shape dogs just love<br /><br />2) Surprisingly strong and resilient.<br /><br />3) safe and Non Toxic Material<br /><br />4) Quality construction<br /><br />5) American made 100% Safe<br /><br />If you're looking for an excellent toy, that can stand up to big time chewers - you can't go wrong with huge turkey leg from Nylabone.<br /><br />My only regret is buying this toy from a large chain store at twice the price it's offered on Amazon.

Which surprised me because it has a terrible, strong fishy smell, and all the jelly and fish parts look disgusting.  But I have to say, this is a great food - because it's recognizable pieces of seafood, you can tell what your cat is really eating. This is mostly sardines, but that is fine with me - sardines are low in mercury and high in nutritious fat, and they're reasonably sustainable. She seems to love the jelly and the chunky texture. It's pretty much free of any carbohydrates - perfect for a carnivore.  I think it's a better product that many of the more expensive foods I've tried.

review/summary: NOT natural
review/text: I have tried a few of the chunk style foods from this company, but have found out through research that it is not "all natural" as it claims.  I know - too late.  In the chunk styles they use the synthetic form of vitamin K - menadione sodium bisulfite.  This chemical has been banned in Europe and the food and drug administration has even banned it in the form of vitamins in America.  In lab rats, poor things, it has caused internal bleeding and lesions on their heart, liver and kidneys among other internal organs.  The scary part is that they claim this has been the result of too much of this chemical, but no one seems to know where that line is. Amazon won't take it back so I guess I will take a loss on this one.  There is no way I am going to continue to give it to my babies with this knowledge.  If you are in doubt of this, just do a google search on it and you will find a wealth of information that can help you make a better decision.  Go with Wellness or Natural Balance.  Even By Natures Organics and Spa Select do not use this is their food.  By the way, I contacted the president of the company "Natural Value" and have yet to hear back.<br />May 28th update - I heard back from the president at Natural Value who was sorry to hear I wasn't happy with the food and is refunding my money PLUS sending me labels to return the food to him.  He is also researching my findings.  I think that showed a lot of integrity so I will continue to buy the pate foods which do not contain the synthetic K.  I did find out more on the chemical as well.  Even low doses of it stay in the organs and tissue of the animals and continue to build even if they are only fed "small amounts."  This is one ingredient to completely avoid!

review/summary: Firm Red Flesh and Delicate Smokey Flavor
review/text: I am rating this three stars although I wish I could give it 2.5.  The fish itself is very good sockeye with a nice red color and firm flesh.  However, the smoke on this fish is so delicate it nears bland.  The smokey flavor is there but you have to strain to taste it.  What is unfortunate about this fact is that sockeye should have a rich distinct flavor.  Instead, the smoke robs the flesh of its richness and doesn't really give you much in return.  The net result is something nearer salmon jerkey rather than smoked sockeye.  The overall effect is OK, but my initial reaction was "what have they done to this fish!"<br /><br />Edit:  Sockeye has a high fat content and as a consequnce you should avoid if on a diet.

review/summary: Not nutritionally sound
review/text: I had been using this food mixed with the canned science diet for my lab puppy (because that is what the shelter had used), and didn't have any issues.  However, after reading the other review, I asked the manager at a local pet food store what he thought of this brand, and he said it was NOT good - all fillers (corn) and animal by-products.  He suggested I gradually shift the dog to Blue, which has a similar protein/carbohydrate mix, and then when the puppy is a bit older (around a year), move to a food with a higher protein content.  (To ease the puppy into a new diet, he suggested I start by mixing 1/4 cup new food with 3/4 old food for a few days, then half and half, etc).  He also recommended that I mix in a couple of tablespoons of canned food with some water, just to make the dry food moist.  (He said the nutritional content of the canned food isn't as important, since the dry food will provide most of the substance, and that I can vary the canned food.)  Finally, he also said that bully sticks are far better for dogs than rawhide (which are basically like eating leather).

review/text: Please do your research on pet foods and what is actually good for your dogs.  Hills science diet is a horrible food filled with horrible ingredients.  They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food.  This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school.  Then they sell the dog food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness.  Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat.  i would recommend going to [...] and compare brands and see what is right for you budget wise. try something like orijen or evo.

review/summary: Simply the best
review/text: I grew up near Hershey, and Hershey's is what people eat around there.  When I got to college and a German friend introduced me to Ritter Sport, I was hooked.  Alpenmilch is the creamiest, smoothest milk chocolate ever.  I don't shed tears after eating the whole package either - even though I should be crying with guilt for eating that much chocolate!  They're so good I can easily rationalize eating the whole package at once.<br /><br />This flavor does have a very tiny hint of some kind of nut.  I don't like nuts (not allergic, just don't like them), and sometimes this nut taste really stands out, and sometimes not.  I suspect it is simply because this product is made on the same machines they use for the ones containing nuts, and a bit of nut oil gets into the product.

review/text: In an attempt to get away from drinking a lot of tea, I started drinking cocoa powder in hot water and lightly sweetened with natural sugar. I'm happily addicted. Because this is a dutch-processed chocolate it does not contain the acid that Hershey's cocoa powder has. It also does not have the additional sugar and additives that typical hot cocoa mixes have. I highly recommend it as a wonderful warm drink in cool weather. However, I have also enjoyed it in warmer weather by making it in concentrated form, dissolving the cocoa and sugar in a little bit of hot water and then adding ice and more cold water as desired. I also enjoy it sweetened with concentrated orange juice.

Also this is a dutch cocoa so it is great for making really dark chocolate, almost black looking cakes. Since it is dutch processed you also want to be sure to adjust your recipes if they are not designed for dutch chocolate as how it rises is a bit different.

Plus, really LOVE that there is no 'sludge' left in the bottom of my cup when the hot chocolate is gone (unlike typical super market unsweetened cocoas I've used in the past.) There is a little more fat in this cocoa than other cocoas, which explains the richer taste. But it's not that much difference in calories from many other brands. Also, tastes fantastic in baking!

review/text: I sometimes buy coconut jelly beans from "bulk bins" at a couple local candy stores.  They're enough of a niche item that they're not very fresh -- they've tasted "good enough"; they've hardened a bit and don't really have a noticeable smell, but that's what I was used to.  Initially, these weren't a huge hit for me -- the texture was a little softer, and the taste was stronger than I was used to, and they have a buttery/coconut smell.  However, they grew on after a couple days and I began to crave them.  10 pounds of beans lasted a while, but now I'm out and (unfortunately) so is Amazon, so I'm on their waiting list -- I don't think I'd be satisfied by stale "bulk bin" beans anymore, so I hope they restock soon.

review/summary: Very Tasty Coffee!
review/text: This coffee is very flavorful without being overpowering. I use one of the Wolfgang Puck flavored coffee pods along with either a Senseo or Melita medium roast (depending on what I have) pod every morning. I like my coffee strong, so the result is strong, smooth and lightly flavored without being bitter. YUM! Even though I use two coffee pods every morning, it ends up being about the same cost wise as using a K-cup.
