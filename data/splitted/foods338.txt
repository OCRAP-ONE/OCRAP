review/summary: This popcorn is perfect for little ones!
review/text: Our 5 year old son loves popcorn but we are always concerned about the hulls in most popcorn's and the potential choking hazard with little ones.  This popcorn is perfect!  Although there is no true "hull free" popcorn, this one comes as close as it gets!  It tastes great and, in our opinion, is very "kid friendly".  This is the only brand of popcorn we use in our popcorn machine at home!

review/summary: Strange love/hate relationship with this popcorn
review/text: I think hate is too strong a word.  I do have a strange like/dislike relationship with this popcorn.  My first impression was "OMG, it's popping all over my kitchen".  My second impression was, "Look how cute it is", followed by "this tastes REALLY good".  And finally, "I need a spoon to eat this stuff".<br /><br />Love:<br />1. It truly is a very "clean" popcorn.  The lack of hulls makes it 100% worthwhile<br />2. Taste:  It's delicious.<br /><br />Not so much love:<br />1. I suppose because the small seeds are so light, it is truly (as one review said) a volcanic erruption.  I had to hold a towel over the opening to my air popper to assure the seeds stayed inside and didn't fly all over the kitchen.  If you want to entertain small children, pets or even yourself, put in the recommended 1/2 cup and stand back and watch the show.  You can totally get around this by adding a generous 3/4 cups of seeds instead of the "do not exceed" 1/2 cup.  It has caused no problems with our popper.<br />2.  Because the kernels are so small it's easy to drop them before you get them to your mouth.  This doesn't bother me that much, but it was a deal breaker for my mother when she came for a visit.<br /><br />Overall, I would definitely recommend this popcorn for it's taste.  My 5-year old loves the small size so I'll break out my spoon and deal with the tiny kernels.

review/summary: Family favorite
review/text: We use a stove top popper and this absolutely my family's favorite popcorn. Hardly any unpopped kernels, it tastes fantastic and the diminutive size is charming and a lot of fun. Plus because it's so tiny, when we use the caramel flavor with it, it's all well coated and a nice sweet treat.<br />I thought my husband wouldn't like it because it was so small, he just eats a couple pieces at a time.<br />It pops up to about half the size of regular popcorn, very delicate and pretty and just fancy enough to thrill my daughter. No big hulls to get caught in teeth. Lovely!

review/summary: There's a reason it has less hull
review/text: I'm almost embarrassed to admit it.....but, there is one reason, and one reason only that this popcorn has less hull/husk than typical popcorn...it's because the kernels are much smaller than regular size popcorn.  Smaller kernels means less hull, less popcorn (duh ;-)<br /><br />I don't know why I didn't think of it before ordering.  I could have purchased six pounds of popcorn at the local grocers, for a fraction of the cost.

review/summary: Great tasting popcorn
review/text: The texture and flavor of this popcorn is unlike any other. Really delicious. BUT I find it best to use an air-popper as with the stovetop method many kernals refuse to pop. You'll need to double the amount and pour 1 full cup into the blower, or spend a good half an hour cleaning the house when the small kernals come roaring out like a volcano. Even then you'll be finding them crunching underfoot for a week or more. Great tasting popcorn though - a real treat.

review/text: Could potentially yield a quality brew if I knew what the hell I was doing. Definitely recommend for a beginner to homebrewing. The only advice from experience I can give is: ignore the directions provided where it says to use cane sugar in the wort. Use malt extract for that portion and then use corn sugar when bottling. Using cane sugar makes it taste cidery, and you'll end up with a little over 2 cases of off tasting beer, unless that's what you're going for.

review/summary: Grocery Store Caviar
review/text: This caviar arrives, via Priority Mail from the USPS, not on ice but vacuum sealed in a set of four glass jars. I immediately put it into the fridge for a later date, which was today.<br /><br />The caviar is of the very small variety and did, despite not arriving chilled, maintain a mild crunch. The taste is over-salted, and a glance at the ingredients explains why. 620mg of sodium X 4 servings in one tiny jar of 3.5 oz. So 2480mg of sodium total. And the poor list of ingredients doesn't stop there. There is a stabilizer added, a preservative added, and three food colorings added. You may as well go to the grocery store and buy off the shelf rather than have this sent to you. I won't be buying it again. Please see my other review of a very fine salmon roe that arrives shipped overnight for free with ice packs. That same company also offers a delightful whitefish caviar that ships in the same manner and is very reasonable.

review/text: Let me make this very simple. Unless you're spending $30/oz. on "inexpensive" sturgeon caviar, this may be your best option for flavor, and it's almost certainly your best option on a price / value basis. The black caviar is small (which you'd expect of white fish), but it's clean and crisp tasting, with the freshness of the sea. Works really well as a garnish. At this price and this quantity, you can't ask for anything more. Highly recommended.

We are retired flight attendants and in our previous life enjoyed the best of the Beluga,carried home personally by either one of us. On fixed income we can no longer afford the Beluga, purchased locally.<br />She stated that it was not only tasty but the salt was not overpowering and she was thrilled with the 4 pack for it afforded her 4 Fridays.Sent with the Mother of Pearl serving spoon and the iceing server it was the perfect elegant yet affordable gift. I will purchase the Caviar for myself in the future.<br />My only concern was the packing. The box did not indicate it was perishable, nor was it contained in ice. I had to call her and advise what was in the package for she's known for storing gifts until her actual day.The Caviar was no surprise, however the server shipped separately was.

review/summary: Just what I hoped for
review/text: I love salmon caviar and other expensive caviars with large eggs. This was a gamble that the taste would be good without the expense. I am well satisfied. The eggs are very small but a thin layer spread on top of cream cheese on a bagel was just right. To really get the flavor though, it is necessary to chew the eggs. Their smallness means you might just swish them in your mouth with your tongue and that won't impart the full flavor.

review/summary: Caveat Emptor on this Caviar!  Well packaged Budget Caviar - But I got Sick from this!
review/text: Hate to give a bad review but hopefully people who are at least sensitive to this brand will find benefit and avoid this item:<br /><br />I was raised with Seafood and used to eating caviar/roes and was very happy with some of the Romanoff purchases but I got sick off of this brand.<br />Almost like a bacteria attack on my body and really bad feeling and I'm a very fit guy.  I tried the Capelin because it was from the same Icelandic environment like Romanoff and similar brands and couldn't beat the pricing with what looks like a great "fancy" packaging and opted out of my Salmon choice to try a new type of fish.  Ultimately a Very Bad Idea especially if someone would have been older with a weaker immune system. Stick with the familiar fish over this one.<br /><br />Caveat Emptor on this Caviar!!!

I used to make a monthly trip specifically to pick up 15 to 20 bags of this Eight O'Clock Coffee French Vanilla.

review/summary: An excellent but excessively expensive Greek yogurt
review/text: Be sure to notice that this is sold both here and in supermarkets in a 17.6 ounce container for just a little more than is charged for other brands' 32 ounce containers. I am assuming that you, gentle reader, can do arithmetic and that you see that makes Fage mighty "dear", to use an antiquated term.<br /><br />However it is good and reasonably well strained. By that I refer to what percentage of the liquid or whey is removed from the yogurt prior to packaging. I've made plenty of my own Greek yogurt and know that as much of the whey as you remove, more will settle out. With this yogurt, in this package, I got approximately a quarter cup of liquid. It can be stirred back in but the real point is that Greek yogurt is around twice as expensive as regular - because, of course, so much of the original weight was in the removed liquid. So if a "cheaty" producer wants to make more per container, he leaves more of the liquid in. It is up to us, the consumers (depending on the role of the FDA which I haven't investigated), to notice this and purchase the "good" products. I believe Fage is doing a reasonable job of straining but still cannot justify its price per unit.<br /><br />This Greek yogurt does have an excellent dairy taste and is free of the ingredients other producers use to disguise sloppiness and (to me) ruin the taste: emulsifiers, thickeners such as pectin, guar gum, locust bean gum and the like. A really good yogurt simply does not require those. It also has only a mild acidity.<br /><br />The ingredients listed on my current container of Fage nonfat plain Greek yogurt:<br />-Grade A pasteurized skimmed milk<br />-Live active yogurt cultures (L. Bulgaricus, S. Thermophilus, L. Acidophilus, Bifidus, L. Casei)<br /><br />A one-cup serving (227g) has 130 calories with 0% fat and cholesterol, 85mg sodium, 9g carbohydrate and 23g protein.<br /><br />If price is no object, I highly recommend it.

The caramel-like taste, which I'd compare to Cap'n Crunch or old school Mr T, Gremlins and Batman cereal, is sweetened with honey, graham (cracker) flour and brown sugar.<br /><br />It's not a good-tasting but a great-tasting cereal, easily one of the best I've ever tried. But; get this; it's too crunchy. No, it wont get soggy in milk, at-least not in any reasonable amount of time, but that's the problem because it makes for a hard chew.

review/text: I discovered these oils years ago, bought one of each flavor, and was thunderstruck at the quality. I use these in place of vegetable or olive oil whenever a dish calls for a similar flavor ingredient (to give it the extra flavor &quot;kick&quot;), but I found myself using them sparingly since I didn't know where to find more when they're gone! I'm almost out of the bottles I bought (just opened 2 of them, and they're fresh as ever!) and was thrilled to see them available on Amazon! The Lemon oil makes a wonderful Greek Saganaki (flamed Feta or Kaseri cheese), the Lime oil is fantastic for Thai cooking and it's many lime-based dishes, and the Orange oil I use in Salmon marinades, as well as with Oriental stir-fry &amp; Chinese duck--I may even try it in making Duck a L'Orange! I don't recall what I paid when I initially purchased them, but as gourmet oils are pricey to begin with, I would consider this a reasonable price, especially considering Amazon's free shipping &amp; the convenience of to-your-door delivery! The bottles are also attractive to display, &amp; are so tall &amp; slim that they take up very little space on your counter. Treat yourself to these oils!

Certainly in a cheese or other highly flavored sauce should be fine.<br />  -substituted for half the non-fat dried milk in our instant hot cholate mix recipe. Everyone raved about the flavor! I noticed our mix wasn't being used up at the same phenomenal clip as people professed themselves more satisfied.<br />- Perfect for single people who want small amounts of milk, mostly for creamer in hot beverages. If you're going to use it slowly, maybe put in a glass jar in the fridge.<br />- Disaster supplies;earthquake,hurricane,etc.<br />- save on gasoline! Won't have to make trips for the sole purpose of someone having milk in their coffee or cereal!<br />- Camping,etc. where weight is an issue;bring this powder and reconstitute as needed.<br />Buy it-you will love it! If two cans seems a big quantity for you, give/resell the other one to a friend,neighbor,etc.<br />NEW ADVANTAGES_ADDED 8-01-11<br />-Easier to use in cooking than liquid milk- in any recipe where it calls for scalding and then cooling the milk, you can skip that step by just mixing up the amount of milk used in your recipe from the milk powder and lukewarm water. Faster and saves on pots needed too.<br />-Absolutely ESSENTIAL if you make yougurt at home. Milk solids are added to milk in making yougurt to stiffen the milk so the resulting yougurt will have the texture people have come to expect from store-bought yogurt.By using this whole milk powder instead of nonfat milk powder, the yougurt thickens better, and it tastes better-for the best yogurt you have ever eaten, try homemade yogurt made with whole milk AND this whole milk powder!!

review/text: I like the product and have been pleased with it from other vendors. I looked at all the vendors on amazon and found this one to be the best value on a delivered price per ounce value (assuming you have amazon prime). However, the savings was very small compared to the next best value and this particular vendor shipped me containers that the date stamps showed they were already at least half expired. So if you are planning on storing this and not using it all within 6 months, I suggest you buy it elsewhere. If you plan to use it all within 6 months than it is the best value for your money (maybe because it is discounted for being old stock). BTW, amazon does not allow the return of these as the are classified as "Grocery Items" which are non-returnable.

These two, however, will expire just six months from now. Just something to be aware of if you are buying this intending it for longer-term storage.<br /><br />The milk itself is delicious.

And the adults weren't unhappy with the taste - actually we were fairly impressed.  Better than most of the other powdered milk we have had.  This is the stuff we'll buy for our sierra trip again next year.

review/text: NIDO INSTANT DRY WHOLE MILK POWDER seemed the answer to the prayers of anyone with a too-small-for-their-needs-refrigerator-and-who-can't-afford-to-presently-purchase-a-new-refrigerator -- like me.  I've tried non-fat dry milk to save room in my refrigerator --but the taste is AWFUL!  I've tried to substitute sweetened condensed milk, (too sweet), and 1/2 and 1/2, (which needs refrigeration -- but not that much room in the refrigerator.  OK -- but no Vitamin D!  Nido Instant Dry Whole Milk Powder, though expensive, seemed just want I wanted -- and, though expensive, is not as expensive as buying a new refrigerator!<br /><br />The taste of NIDO is much better than non-fat dry milk.  And for most purposes, works quite well.  But somehow, when I try to use it with coffee -- and Splenda -- the sweetness of the Splenda is lessened.  I like sweet coffee -- but putting 3 or 4 times my usual amount of Splenda to achieve the sweetness I like in coffee could be dangerous.<br />(My doctor has already told me to cut down, as too much Splenda seems to be bad for the liver.) I suspect that the LECITHIN in NIDO is what gets in the way of the sweetness, as lecithin is NOT found in most liquid whole milks, (that I know of, anyway).  So my advice would be to use NIDO in anything that does not require too much sweetness, (sweentess from Splenda, and/or sucralose, at any rate.)  But if you don't require too much sweetness in your coffee, it's OK to use, I guess.  And it can always be used, if an emergency strikes and your refrigerator stops working.

I use two tablespoons of this or the regular Nido and a bit of stevia liquid (Kal brand is the best) and use two short pours (about 3.5 oz. total) of hot water from my Nespresso and then froth with my Black & Decker frother. Both sold here. Tilt the glass and keep the frother near the top after initial mixing. Makes delicious, thick froth as good as Nespresso's. I then add a 4 oz. pour of espresso. I use the Ristretto. Mix for a second with the frother so there's still milk froth on top and add a dash of cinnamon. Delicious and only 80 calories. No smelling the milk to see if it's still good and throwing out milk that went bad if you don't use it for anything else.

review/summary: The next best thing to Peak Instant Milk
review/text: I have used both Nido and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004K0862K">Peak Dry Whole Milk Powder, 900-Grams</a> for years and I will say that this is the runner-up for high quality,dried whole milk. It is great to have in the pantry for emergencies or if you simply can't ever get to the bottom of a carton of fresh milk before it goes off.<br />* I find that Nido doesn't dissolve as readily as Peak powder.<br />* Also,I feel that Peak simply has a superior creaminess factor to Nido,which makes it better for drinking,so I would rather use Nido for baking and cooking.<br />* Check the expiry dates before purchase if you buying for emergency purposes,aiming at a 24 month window.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: Unlike most other hollandaise sauce packet preparations on the market, you don't need to add butter or milk or both to this.  This is just water, boil and it comes out perfectly silky every time.  I add an ounce of shredded cheese and dash of hot sauce for my Eggs Benedict.  Thyme and lemon for asparagus or cauliflower.  It's not cloyingly rich like homemade, and it's ready in as fast as you can boil a cup of water on the stove (stupidly fast).  We used to find this in the supermarket in the fresh veggie section clipped to the end of the aisles, then in the 'packet' aisle, then it disappeared from the store altogether and now we have to buy it online, but it's worth it at less than 2 bucks a packet.

review/summary: Easier than from scratch. Better tasting??
review/text: The first few times I made hollandaise sauce from scratch, I failed about as often as I succeeded. You need to attend to this dish as you prepare it, or it curdles. I finally learned that lesson. When I made it right, boy did it add great taste to, for example, asparagus. On the other hand, it took lots of attention.<br /><br />So, as a compromise, I sometimes go to these packaged products.  Concord Foods makes a useable hollandaise sauce. The key advantage is ease of preparation. The cost? It's not as rich a taste as when I make my own. So, it's a tradeoff. But, in the end, this packaged product works well enough to justify my buying it from time to time.

review/summary: Beware if You are in Early Pregnancy
review/text: This is a very tasty tea, but you should be very careful if you are pregnant.  I decided to check the ingredients before drinking it.  As it turns out, there is some debate regarding the very first ingredient, raspberry leaf.  It is unclear whether this is safe early in a pregnancy, or whether it should only be used at the end...when trying to induce labor.  Rather than take any chances, I threw the stuff out!<br /><br />I think the manufacturer should warn people not to consume this during early pregnancy, or at least advise of the risks.  The advertising is irresponsible, in my view.  No more Yogi products for me.

review/summary: Bland but filling
review/text: Having tried & adored most of this brand's soup cups, I eagerly grabbed a cup of their lentil & couscous soup. Thirty minutes later, I was pretty underwhelmed by the experience.<br /><br />The soup may have less sodium, but it is incredibly bland tasting. It doesn't need salt, but a pinch of extra seasoning would have helped the taste. This may be great for some, but for me it would deter me from purchasing more of this product unless I were to get some extra seasoning to dump in it.<br /><br />The best part of the soup is that it is incredibly filling- even more so than some of McDougall's other products. It's just that I'd rather have something that tastes good rather than something that is filling. If you don't mind bland food or can season it to perfection, get this product. If you are like me & just don't have the time to season food at work, you may want to skip this & give their other products a try.<br /><br />*Oh, and I recommend letting this sit for 8 minutes rather than 5. It made the lentils & couscous much more tender!

True, the taste can be a little bland... but I've played around with some spices to make it a little more interesting. But honestly, it doesn't taste bad and I love a) the convenience and b) the fullness factor. I will be buying this product again shortly.

review/summary: Not that great
review/text: Like many high-carbohydrate instant "soups," the Lentil Couscous Soup is more couscous than soup.  Preparation is easy, although mine boiled over when prepared according to the very precise (1 minute, 40 seconds) cooking time in the instructions.  I would have preferred a more vague time endpoint and directions to watch for boiling.  The resulting food is quite bland as other reviewers have noted, and what this "low-sodium" (330 mg) soup really needed was more salt.  The flavors that were present were nondescript, neither the couscous nor the lentils providing a distinctive flavor note.  I kept looking at the package to see what kind of flavor I should have been expecting.  The texture was also pretty monotonous, and the couscous itself did not have the best texture, which was disappointing because good couscous is not that hard to make.  As for healthy eating, the product is essentially pasta with lentils added to provide some protein and fiber, and with 37 grams of carbs the 190 calories are pretty empty -- not all that much different from macaroni with low-fat cheese.  I'm glad I tried it, I won't mind eating the other 5 cups in the pack, but I won't be buying it again.

review/text: This flavor is awesomely good, in my opinion. I recently ordered 5 different varieties of Dr. McDougall's soups, and this flavor quickly became my favorite. I just ordered several more 6-packs of the lentil couscous soup.<br /><br />I was looking for high fiber, and this soup has lots of fiber. My stomach is pretty finicky, but the only problem this product caused me was a craving for more.<br /><br />Some people complained about it not having enough salt, but the label says "lower sodium," for goodness sakes! Duh! Anyway,I would have preferred even less sodium. For me, the flavor is great!

review/summary: Outstanding, quick and easy healthy meal!
review/text: Reading some of the reviews for this, I was worried it would be tasteless drool...but it is very well seasoned.  The "blandness" so often mentioned by others is due to the lack of salt...and this is a "Lower Sodium" soup, so I'm not sure what else people expect.  The fact is, other seasonings cannot make up for lack of salt.  You can add other (non-sodium) seasonings and change the flavor, but it will still have something "missing".  I believe tastes very good as it is, or you can "spice it up" if you want.<br /><br />This soup is also very healthy (especially considering other "quick" meal or snack options)...try getting the same fiber and protein, with almost no fat or sugar and only 190 calories, in anything else this warm and filling.  Now, others seem to have tried to compare it to soup from a five-star restaurant, complaining of missing "distinct flavor notes" and incorrect "texture"...this is dehydrated soup in a cup, people!  I prepared it with hot water, and let it sit for over 5 minutes.  The soup was not "mushy" at all...the couscous was fine, the lentils were quite soft, but they did not break up into a nebulous grey glob or anything.  It is what it is, and for an instant "cup of soup", it is excellent!<br /><br />Considering how easy it is to store and make, the quality of ingredients, how healthy it is for a fairly filling quick meal or snack, and how inexpensive it is (the cost breaks down to less than the cost of a can of name-brand soup at the supermarket)...I am going to be buying this again for sure!

review/summary: What a nice surprise!
review/text: This is an excellent product!  I know many reviewers have written that it has a lousy taste, or no taste, but in my opinion it is very flavorful.  To me, it has sort of a spicy flavor that is not overwhelming.  The primary reason for eating McDougall's products is to enjoy a healthier lifestyle.  When I think of all the fast food that people think is flavorful, it makes me nauseous.<br /><br />The ingredients absorb all the water so it will be thick.  You can add more water if you like.  My first cup turned out perfect, and although this is a smaller-size cup it was a lot to eat.  I actually had this for my breakfast and I stayed and felt full all morning!  Actually there are only 180 calories, so that is fantastic.  Prepare yourself for a lot of gas after consuming this, but that can usually be expected after eating something so healthy.

I also didn't want to eat something full of all kinds of dangerous chemicals, and I wanted it to be fairly inexpensive.<br /><br />I saw these little soup in a cup things at Hannaford in Waterville, Maine.  I read the ingredients and it fit the bill so I bought 4 different varieties.  I am trying the lentil and couscous first and I am very pleasantly surprised.
