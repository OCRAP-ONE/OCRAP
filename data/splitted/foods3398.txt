review/summary: Made by Diamond Pet Foods
review/text: I dropped the ball when I ordered a large bag of this for my dogs.  I love the Chicken Soup books, and I figured that the company would also produce good quality dog food.  Imagine my surprise to find out that Diamond Pet Foods, which has had numerous problems, is the one behind this.  There is a news article today about this company and people getting sick from salmonella just from handling the dog food.  I feel cheated, but it is my own fault for not doing enough research on the product.  And my dogs didn't care for it anyway.  I wound up mixing it with another brand.  Had I but known, I would have returned it.  Live and learn, and I am glad that my dogs survived it.

review/summary: Made my lab sick
review/text: After reading good reviews and because of the great price I decided to give this dog food a shot. My 7 year old lab loves to eat and is not picky about dog food but I have found that some brands give her itchy skin so I have been looking for something that is affordable and has quality ingredients. I started her on this dog food about a week ago and at first she had bad gas which I thought was probably just because of the new food. Now she has terrible diarrhea. My boyfriend gave his dog some of the food a few days ago (before I had noticed my dog having diarrhea) to see if he might like it. Later, late that that night my boyfriend told me that the food must have not agreed with his dogs stomach because he got diarrhea in the house. Hmmm. Sounds like this food is not what it seems. I am beginning to wonder if the company has their employees write good reviews on here to help make sales. I found a couple other reviews on other sites that said they had similar gas/diarrhea problems with their dogs on this food.

review/summary: Surprisingly good
review/text: My expectations were pretty low for this, maybe because the wrapper promises "hemp protein powder" and "organic" and "Gluten Free" and various other trendy buzzwords I don't associate with good taste or even good nutrition.  However the macronutrients are fairly good (this flavor having much better macros than the other two flavors of Flaxpower bars) and it's pretty high in fiber, so I thought I'd give it a chance.<br /><br />I quite like it.  It's a bunch of seeds and small bits of berries all stuck together with sugar syrup.  That probably sounds like birdseed, but I find the taste appealing.  It's a little too much on the sweet side, but certainly it's not cloying.  I'll get it again.

review/summary: A great taste that satisfies your sweet tooth!
review/text: Blue Diamond Almonds are just the best almonds around.  They are always fresh and they have so many different flavors that you can buy whatever taste suits your fancy.  This is a very good one and we like it as it is delicious.  I do have to be careful as it contains 5 grams of sugar and 9 grams of carbohydrates per serving which is about 28 nuts.<br /><br />The problem is that they are so good that you have to hide the can and fight taking seconds.  I prefer eating almonds for a snack as opposed to eating chips because the almonds have 2 grams of fiber, vitamin E 30%, Magnesium 15%, 6 grams of protein and calcium 6% in them.  They just are healthier and they satisfy your craving for for something to munch on.<br /><br />I you like to nibble on a snack then I recommend these to you.  If you have to avoid sugar then there are many other flavors available without so much sugar.

review/summary: Sugar coated burned almonds!!
review/text: MEH!! How do people give this 5 stars? This is yucky. The only reason I decided to buy these is because few months back I bought honey roasted almonds from PLANTERS brand. They were special edition limited edition I found on the supermarket. It was part of the superbowl extravaganza. Not knowing I would like them I bought only one. Sweet toother, YUM! They were addicting. I went back the next week looking for them again and they were gone. Weeks to months pass I forget about them. Then all of a sudden I looked it up if they had it on Amazon. Yes they did, but not Planters brand. All they had was Blue Diamond. Which I figured, could they be that different? There just roasted almonds coasted with honey. Give Blue Diamond a try, get it in the mail and open them up.. they both definitely taste very different. Blue Diamond has this odd burnt taste you barley get the taste of honey in the aftertaste. So disappointed.. If anyone has tasted the Planters Honey Roasted Almonds you can definitely tell the difference. Planters is more sweet or rather it doesn't have that burnt taste. Perhaps Blue Diamonds product is too smokey/ roasted. Ugh.. will not buy from again. These aren't terribly bad so don't take me wrong. This is my own personal opinion. But pack of 12 I learned my lesson. Next time I will try only 1 in an individual item. By the way, I'm glad there only 6oz.. dear Lord if there were any bigger.

review/text: Product came quickly in Plastic shrink wraps, even with super budget shipping. No dent on the cans and very fresh stock as you can tell from the exp dates.<br /><br />Blue diamond almonds, IMO, is better than any other brands on the market. I've tried almost all the brands available here in the states. Blue Dia offers both bold/strong taste as well as light/healthy options. The Honey Roasted and Lightly Salted (sea salt) are my favorites.<br /><br />Will order again once we finish eating them. Try jasmine tea or any light green tea with the almonds together, very addictive!

review/summary: Easy to use and okay flavor, but expen$ive
review/text: I was looking for a Jello-type mix that was sugar-free and did not use aspartame, as most mixes do, because I cannot tolerate it. Since this was sweetened with Splenda, which I can tolerate fine, I bought it to try. Although it uses both natural and artificial flavors, I was pleasantly surprised to see that it uses mostly natural ingredients, including natural colors. There is no aspartame in it; the sweeteners are sucralose (Splenda) and acesulfame K. The package makes two half-cup servings at 20 calories/7 g carb each.<br /><br />I used the first package to make a diet drink from another cookbook. Although the package directions call for dissolving the package in a cup of boiling water and NOT adding ice or cold water, the mix dissolved easily in a half-cup of boiling water and I was able to add the other ingredients.<br /><br />The main drawbacks are the package size (2-serving instead of the 4-serving common package, which means you have to remember to use 2 of these packages when 1 is called for in recipes), price, and that the flavor isn't very strong. While the flavor was acceptable when made as directed, when I had to add a little more ice to the drink recipe, it noticeably diluted the strawberry flavor. At $1.50/pkg when purchased in this order of 10, two packages are about triple the price of a single comparable 4-serving aspartame-containing mix at the store. But as an occasional treat to help me achieve my weight-loss goal, I will be keeping it around.

review/summary: Good but not as memorable as I'd anticipated.
review/text: I am not a coffee snob. I am, however, a former barista who appreciates coffee that has been properly roasted ground and brewed. When I have company I often am complimented on what a good cup of coffee I've served and delight in explaining to my guests that my secret is fresh, coarse ground beans and a french press. That said I do like Starbucks' Breakfast Blend quite a bit though I prefer medium roasts and have recently discovered an excellent fair trade store brand Columbian that is divine.<br /><br />Unless I am in the mood for a coffee treat (think Caramel Frappucinos) or a home brewed cappucino I only drink my coffee black. I've loved the smell and taste of coffee since I was far too young to be drinking it so when I drink it I want to taste coffee, not sugar and dairy. A badly made cup of coffee is downright depressing. I won't drink percolated coffee unless there is nothing else available because it tends to destroy the oils in coffee beans that give them a smooth flavor. Same with overly roasted beans. But I'm getting off subject here...<br /><br />What did I think of Melitta Cafe Collection's Blanc et Noir?<br /><br />The first thing I noticed when I opened the bag was that I wasn't instantly hit with its scent. Half of what I love about making coffee is what I like to think of as the foreplay... that enticing odor teasing me when I open up the bag! Okay, I guess I can live without it. As this is a very finely ground blend I chose to prepare it as espresso. I would not recommend this coffee to those who use a french press (course ground is best when using that method) as you will end up drinking a LOT of the powdery grind that passes through the mesh of your press which for some can cause digestive upsets and for others is just gross. I did not try percolating it but I'm certain others who will review this product will use that method so check out what they thought if you'd like to know.<br /><br />I tried Blanc et Noir both as my preferred cuppa, black, and with steamed milk, as a latte. I was expecting a much stronger flavor for such a beautiful dark brew. As a stand-alone cup of black coffee it wasn't overly memorable. Smooth without the bitterness darker roasts often have or the acidic bite of lighter roasts. It sounds good in theory but by combining the two they somehow loose what makes each special. Which is why I tried it with some steamed milk and a little foam as well. I must say that if you like milk in your coffee this is a lovely coffee to pair with it. Unlike traditional espresso which is a dark roast, the added light roast just gave it something I can't seem to find the right word for.<br /><br />While I don't think Blanc et Noir is one I'd choose for brewing at home given other options I would definitely request it if it were being offered at a coffee house I was patronizing.

review/text: Before we begin, I am somewhat of a coffee snob -- I roast my own beans weekly.  That being said...<br /><br />I suppose every company would like its products described as "the best"... This coffee will have to settle for "damned respectable".  This stuff is better than most of what can be found at your average grocery store.  It also beats the 'bux though this is a low bar.<br /><br />As for the taste, it is dark and has some of that earthy high end but is not overly bitter.  I would not call the taste "complex", but would say it is flavorful.<br /><br />I think given how reasonably priced this stuff is you have a very solid cup of coffee at a very reasonable price.  Point being... You're probably paying more for a worse cup of coffee right now?

review/text: I'm not a coffee connoisseur but I do drink a lot of it and I have a definite idea of the type of coffee I like and what tastes good. So, based on my limited palate, I can say that there are some things I like about this coffee and some things I don't. This is a medium sort of brew that is neither too strong or too mild and this makes it easy to drink. It's also easy to drink because there is no bitterness or harshness. The downside of this coffee is that there isn't much flavor. It's a sort of bland coffee without much substance "in the middle." I can see this coffee being used in an office or during the day when the caffeine effect is more important than the flavor. The only downside to this is that it's a bit pricey for an everyday drink at an office.

review/summary: A pleasant blended coffee
review/text: My usual coffee is a dark French roast from New England Coffee Co; I buy it ground, make it a bit strong and use it up before it loses its freshness. Like anyone else who appreciates coffee, I don't want any bitter or burned taste in my brew.<br /><br />This Blanc et Noir ground coffee from Melitta is a blend of light and dark roasts, so I thought it might taste bland. I was pleasantly surprised that it has such a good flavor, though I did need to make it stronger than the package directions recommend to enjoy it fully. Thankfully, making it stronger didn't introduce any bitterness to the flavor. This is a pleasant coffee. I brewed it in a basket-style electric drip pot, which is all I have available at the moment. I don't usually mind if my coffee cools a bit in the cup--don't need it piping hot to enjoy it--but I found this Melitta coffee to be far more flavorful at a just-poured temperature.<br /><br />I probably won't give up my usual coffee for this product, but I'd certainly buy it above other brands when I can't get my preferred New England coffee; that's an eventuality I have to prepare for, since I don't live in New England any more!<br /><br />Linda Bulger, 2010

review/text: I am a Folders Classic Roast kind of girl, I can't tell you the exact notes that I am picking up when I drink Melitta's Blanc Noir coffee - all I can tell you is that it's pretty good, not great, just pretty good.  I have been fiddling with the exact measurements, thinking that you have to use slightly more then you usually would when making a pot, but be careful not to use too much since it tends to taste "burned" or over roasted when you use too much.<br /><br />Also, for some reason, flavored coffee creamer seems to be intensified with this coffee blend so do not use too much.  I know, it sounds weird, but that has been my experience.<br /><br />With the name that Melitta has given this product, I was thinking that it would have had a more dominate flavor.  It just was not that way for me.  Back to my Folgers.

review/summary: It's coffee, nothing wonderful, nothing bad.
review/text: I am not a coffee drinker, but my wife is so I got this for her. She likes her starbucks and she'll drink the McDonalds version coffee.<br /><br />Her overall impression of this was it was ok. She wasn't overly impressed with it. I will say that from my non-coffee drinking point of view, when I received this the fresh scent of coffee was very overpowering compared to most bags of coffee I have ever touched. It smelled very fresh.<br /><br />The overall impression however of the taste, it was decent. Not a high end, and not something that will make you want to pour it down the drain. It's just a basic coffee that you could drink every morning.

review/summary: The best
review/text: Now it's possible to have coffee shop flavor at home. Melitta Blanc et Noir is full of enticing aroma and smooth, rich flavor. We've been grinding beans at home up till now, but this ground coffee product is the first we've tried that is satisfying in every way, and doesn't turn bitter with time after the package is opened. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Very robust
review/text: This is a very strong, robust coffee that can be overwhelming if your taste buds prefer a more mild flavor. However, my husband adored the flavor. He loves a 'hardy' coffee and often makes it so strong I think my eyes will pop! Whether or not my enamel remains on my teeth depends on who reaches the coffee maker first in the morning. So, if you are like my hubby and love an extra robust flavor and want to fill your house with that grand, eye-popping coffee smell, this particular blend of Melitta Cafe is for you. If your tongue needs to adjust in the early morning and you tend to even out the taste of the beans with milk, I recommend a milder blend.

review/summary: Not as bold as expected, but very smooth.
review/text: We used this in our Keurig and were delighted.  I think my husband was expecting it to be stronger and bolder, which is why it is getting 4 out of 5 stars.  For me, it was perfect, but he was hoping for something to slap him in the face!  I am a "lots of cream and sugar" coffee drinker, and I used about half as much cream as I normally do.  The coffee is amazingly smooth, so I just didn't need as much.  My husband drinks coffee with nothing in it, or just a small sprinkle of sugar and he also enjoyed it by itself.  I think this may be making a regular appearance in our cupboard!

review/summary: Well-Balanced Coffee
review/text: When roasting coffee, there is always a decision on how far to go.  Too little does not develop the nuanced coffee flavor but gives a solid drink, too much yields acrid, bitter blechh so common in certain national chains.  Melitta has addressed this dilemma by including both horns, a well-roasted Noir, and substantial body from the so-called Blanc (medium roast).  What you get is a very drinkable blend without the harsh overtones which have been modulated by the lighter roast.  Of course, being a pre-ground blend, it is important to store properly after opening to maintain this flavor balance.

review/summary: Pretty darned good
review/text: I don't consider myself a coffee "connoiseur", but I do know what I like and don't like.<br /><br />Typically, I start my day with a glass of coffee in a frapuccino-style drink, and may have another in the course of a day. I know; many of you are thinking, "Who cares what THIS guy thinks, the way he drinks coffee?"<br /><br />Well, even though I'm not a "purist", the coffee still makes or breaks that drink. Many of the dark roasts give me a very strong, bitter drink that I don't enjoy whatsoever. Other coffees are so bland that I end up with a slightly-colored milk drink of no particular character.<br /><br />I made the coffee as espresso in my Krup machine, then used it as the base for the drink. It came out of the espresso machine with the proper visual, a nice frothy top. Adding the other ingredients -- milk and sweetener -- I found the taste to be rich without bitterness, slightly complex, not at all over-roasted. I then added some Torani vanilla syrup, and thought it was quite delectable.<br /><br />I'd put this coffee on a par with Starbucks.<br /><br />One thing I'd like to point out. The product page discusses this being a "Pack of 3". I only received one bag of coffee. Now, I don't know whether this was due to the fact that I received the product through the Vine Program, and quantities were reduced because I got it for free for the purposes of reviewing it, or if there's actually some other issue like a shipping or printing error. I'm simply reporting my experience.<br /><br />Obviously, this has a big effect on the "value" of what you're buying for that price.

review/summary: Excellent... but a little 'thin'
review/text: I'm pretty picky about my coffee. It has to be bold. Has to be smooth. Bitter is bad. Burned beans are bad. And hotel conference room coffee from the 100-cup percolator pot is generally the most vile thing on Earth. Little styrofoam cups filled with overheated pool chemicals and mop-bucket waste.<br /><br />In fact, if you've ever taken a sip of the latter and remarked "hmmm, not a bad cup of coffee!" then perhaps you shouldn't even consider the purchase of a premium blend, as you would simply be wasting your money. You've destroyed your taste buds and they probably wouldn't be able to appreciate the difference anyway.<br /><br />So I opened the little bag of Melitta with a healthy dose of skepticism. As it was available only ground (given a choice, I grind my own beans), I wondered if it could really be any good.<br /><br />Following the directions on the bag, we put eight teaspoons of coffee in our French press with 24 oz of water, added almost-boiling water, waited about 5 minutes and pushed the plunger. And?????<br /><br />It was quite a bit better than I expected it to be. No hint of bitterness, and low in acidity, it was a very smooth cup of coffee that was lacking in only one area. It wasn't as bold as I would have liked. Having said that, I must say that if a restaurant were to serve this, I'd be thrilled, as I find most restaurant coffee to be less-than-stellar.<br /><br />The Melitta is certainly not going to replace the coffee my wife and I have been purchasing exclusively for the last several years (Raven's Brew, which in my opinion, blows away Starbucks, and even Gevalia), but we'll definitely enjoy the next several pots. Although I may go a little bit 'heavier' on the coffee-to-water ratio next time.<br /><br />- Jonathan Sabin

review/summary: Way better coffee than Star*****
review/text: My sack of Melitta coffee is labeled, "Extra fine grind, Blanc et Noir, Light & Dark Roast."  The sack, which is airtight until cut, and which contains a firm fastener, contains 312 grams of finely ground coffee.  This product, therefore, will be convenient for adults to brew their coffee early in the morning, without waking up the little ones with the loud grinding sound of grinding coffee beans.<br /><br />I prefer to brew strong coffee, and for this task, I used a brewing machine from Cuisinart.  This machine contains a fine metal filter, not a paper filter. The coffee had a convincing, rich flavor, with a slightly acidic taste.  At any rate, I found this product to provide a brew that was superior to that from Star*****.  I have discovered, with repeated samplings over several years, that Star***** coffee powder has the flavor of ashes from burned wood, or perhaps worse.  I do not think that the Melitta product can match Peet's coffee powder.  Once the Melitta bag is opened, the powder in the bag does not generate much  of an aroma.  In contrast, when a bag of Peet's ground coffee is first opened, it provides a dynamic symphony of aromas.<br /><br />This is about the history of the Melitta company. In 1908, Melitta Bentz, a housewife from Dresden, Germany invented the first coffee filter. On July 8, 1908, Melitta Bentz received a patent for her "Filter Top Device lined with Filter Paper" from the Patent Office in Berlin. The 35-year-old housewife was transformed into a businesswoman and, during the same year of her invention, the company bearing her name was established.  Melitta USA, headquartered in Clearwater, Florida is part of the privately held Melitta Group of Minden, Germany. Melitta USA is responsible for the sales and marketing of Melitta coffee filters, coffee, and non electric coffee systems in the USA.

review/summary: Well balanced, not bitter, substantial flavor
review/text: Gotta start the day with a cup o' joe, so I put the Melitta Cafe Collection Blanc et Noir Ground Coffee through its paces. For those who care about such things, I brewed the coffee in an electric drip coffeemaker, using a non-bleached paper filter. I used 18 ounces of water (or three cups according to the coffee package) and approximately 2 teaspoons of coffee per cup as instructed on the package (plus my signature "one to grow on" teaspoon that always goes in for a little boost).<br /><br />When I poured the cup, I was pleased to see that the coffee was very dark. I drink my coffee black and I like it strong, so my ratio of water to coffee seemed right for me. I did notice that there wasn't as much aroma as I would have liked. What I did smell had that freshly brewed scent but it was subtle. The flavor was very balanced - not bitter like an overly roasted coffee (Sorry Starbucks) but not wishy washy like most grocery store blends. It was the kind of morning coffee that I enjoy, flavor without being too bold and in my face first thing. Not too much acid, but a bit of a zing. I guess that's why it is a blend of light and dark coffees, which seems to work well.<br /><br />My normal coffee is Gevalia Stockholm and this compared favorably. I thought it was tastier than my runner-up coffee (when I run out of Gevalia), Dunkin' Donuts. I would definitely purchase this blend and I'll recommend it to the coffee fiends in my family.

review/summary: Fail
review/text: I really enjoy Melita's canned coffee, so I figured this collection would be a real treat. I absolutely hated this blend. This is entirely a matter of taste. I believe the actual quality of the coffee is acceptable, not great, and not bad. The description does not specify the blend to region or location. However this is most assuredly a Arabican blend.<br /><br />As I stated, this is a matter of individual taste. Personally I detest Arabica blends. They leave a strange earthy aftertaste that stays with you for hours. Had I known this was Arabica derived, I would not have purchased it. That information is entirely missing from the product description.<br /><br />From the quality and freshness of this blend (taste aside) I will not be purchasing any further Melitta coffees from this bagged collection. The coffee was nowhere near fresh, the grinds were excessively dry and somewhat stale.

review/summary: Melitta Blanc Et Noir---It's good
review/text: I enjoy coffee and drink 2-4 cups of the stuff a day. Im not a Cafe snob so im not going to pretend i know a lot about the Cafe subject. I bought a Melitta Coffee maker(a rebadged Hamilton Beach) and i figured hey why not try Melitta Coffee. I'm use to buying the Spanish Coffee (Bustello and Pilon). They both are Cuban Espresso blend. That stuff is fine however it is slightly bitter. This Blanc et Noir with light and dark blends is wonderful. There is almost no bitter taste in it all. The one thing with the Melitta coffee some of the "character" of the coffee seems to be subdued. Maybe a little to much, robbing the blend of much character or boldness. Seems like in a effort to make a smooth non-bitter coffee some of the characteristics of the coffee was subdued in the process. This isnt to say it has no flavor or character in it. It does, and i can detect the two different levels of the blends. I still enjoy the blend however i dont know where to purchase this locally. I live in a major city so im sure some store must carry it. The price of a individual bag itself isnt bad. A bag of Gevalia here retails for $9-$10, the Melitta is about $7-8 online. However once you factor in the shipping everything equals out. As it stands im not sure if willing to spend twice the amount of what i usually spend on a bag of Coffee. Maybe as a occasional treat i may order it.

review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised!
review/text: Like most people (I suspect) we tend to stick to the coffee we know and love.  Neither of us are what you might consider "coffee snobs" but we both have pretty strong feelings on what is good and bad coffee.  We lean toward stronger brews, but not too acidic.  Hidden flavors are a plus, but not required.  We seem to rotate between Starbucks (Yukon, Pike Place or Pike Place Reserve), Seattle's Best (Henry's Blend), Frederick's, Caffe Vita and El Diablo (on Queen Anne in Seattle!).  So when I was presented with this through the Vine program I was skeptical and was a little concerned and assumed I might be writing a not-so-favorable review, however that turned out to not be the case.  Here are my basic pros and cons:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Bold and Flavorful, but not offensively so!  Other reviewers have called this "really strong" or "too bold" but I guess it all depends on what you drink.  Personally, we didn't find it so.  Starbucks has a penchant for burning their beans at times giving the coffee and almost acrid, acidic taste - even in the beans you purchase from the store.  This coffee was smooth, rich and good to the last drop.<br />The bag itself was easy to open and reseal.  All too often I end up fighting open a new bag of coffee only to have it all over the counter.  Resealing the bag then requires magician's handy work.  Not so here.  Seems silly to critique the bag itself perhaps, but it's true!!<br /><br />Cons:<br />No adventures here.  Don't expect hints of this or that, or nutty edge.  Not even sure this is a con!<br /><br />All in all, I'd buy this again and I'm glad I gave it a shot!

review/summary: Very satisfying cup of coffee
review/text: I am certainly not a coffee expert, though I have been drinking the stuff for 50 years or so.  Nor do I have any of this awesome coffee-making apparatus I see advertized.  I just have my trusty old Melitta drip coffee maker--put the coffee in a filter on the top and pour in your hot water. So, I am certainly no cafe gourmet.  I found this coffee to be quite good in brewing it up.  The coffee is very rich and dark and has a pleasant aroma, especially after you pour hot water on it. It can be too strong if you overdo it, but used in moderate amounts it generates quite a satisfying cup.  Otherwise, it is very easy to utilize even in my primitive equipment. It stores well also--I had my test batch in the fridge for several months and it was just as captivating when I pulled it out as when it first arrived. So, I guess the best term for this coffee is "moderately hearty" and quite pleasant.

review/text: Melitta Cafe COllection Blanc et Noir coffee has a very smooth, refined armoma you notice as soon as you open up the package. That same aroma translates well throughout the brewing process and remains once poured into your cup. Once you taste it, you will find that the flavor is bold yet smooth, it has a slightly dark, powerful flavor without any of the coarseness or bitterness. I went directly from one of those high-pressure coffee pod brewing systems to using the Melitta in a percolator, and it seems Melitta has helped me find my way back to a better cup of coffee.

review/text: I like preground coffee just for the convenience, but I realize grinding your own beans just before brewing is going to be a lot better than the usual "coffee from a can".  These are vacuum sealed bags of preground coffee.  It's a great compromise as the coffee is pretty good on the taste front.  The  three bags are small enough that with regular use, you can go through a bag fairly quickly and then open the next vacuum sealed bag without fear of letting your coffee sit around too long exposed to air.  I use sugar and fair amount of cream in mine, so the flavor really has to stand out.

review/summary: Great taste
review/text: I've tried to capture the taste of really fine coffee I've experienced in some excellent restaurants without much success--including grinding my own beans, buying expensive ones at specialty shops, etc.  This product, while not quite doing justice to my memories of great coffee, comes closest.  It is somewhat expensive at about $9/lb.  Supermarket coffees are, of course, much cheaper--and you can get larger packages at discount places for much, much less.  I even tried mixing this coffee with Folgers--and it was pretty good too.  Naturally, this coffee is much richer so one needs to experiment a bit to figure out how much to use in your coffee maker.  I drink coffee straight up--no sweetener, no milk products, but I like it pretty strong--but not burnt or over-roasted.  This coffee is not over-roasted or bitter (unless you use too much of it).  I found it superior to the other Melitta products I've tried as well as to other much-vaunted brands such as Starbucks, Seattle's Best, and Gevalia.  But taste is on the tongue of the beholder...

review/summary: Now my working day Thermos Coffee
review/text: Generally I drink only home pressed espresso - and way too much of it - so for the past few months have been going with drip brewed coffee (except on weekends!) in an effort to cut down on the amount of caffeine I drink.<br /><br />This works, as I can make drip coffee weaker than espresso without it being too watery, whereas weak espresso is simply dreadful. Recall that "Caff&egrave; Americano" is espresso with hot water added to it to make it weak enough for our usual national preference, and is not the sort of coffee that I enjoy.<br /><br />Perhaps because it is so finely ground, I find myself using under half as much of this Melitta "Blanc et Noir" coffee as I had been using with my previous home ground mix for my drip brewer and still ending up with OK coffee.<br /><br />The "Blanc et Noir" also seems to be quite "smooth," though I do find myself adding about a third of a teaspoon of sugar per pint else it is slightly bitter - which seems characteristic of all pre-ground coffees.<br /><br />Though I did get a complementary bag of this coffee from Amazon for review (which is how I found out about it), I liked it well enough that I now have it as a regular order on my Amazon "Subscribe and Save" program.<br /><br />It is not great coffee, but it is good coffee. It is what I now take to work everyday for it is much better than that which I can get at the hospital, and, as am using less coffee to make it, it not only has further decreased my caffeine intake, but is cheaper as well.<br /><br />Disclaimer: This item was initially provided by Amazon to me for review.

review/summary: GREAT COFFEE
review/text: When I first received the coffee I wondered how a mix of light and dark would be anything different than just a regular medium brew coffee.  After tasting it I was hooked.  It has the rich dark taste with any bitterness and a smooth finish.  Very comfortable to drink yet bold.

review/summary: A taste of Europe
review/text: We spent some time living overseas and grew accustomed to the fine coffees and espresso so readily available. After moving back to the States, we've searched for comparable coffee, but nothing quite measures up.<br /><br />I've tried some of the other Melitta blends, and they've been...ok...but not spectacular. This Blanc et Noir blend, however, blew me away! It's strong without being the least bit bitter or acidic, rich with a full body. I don't know if/how the flavor may change while sitting on the shelf or in the fridge, because we drank this up so quickly. This is robust coffee for being a blend, and sipping it for breakfast gave me a little taste of Europe.

review/text: I'm not a coffee drinker, but my husband drinks a ton of coffee ... Starbucks, McDonald's, Dunkin' Donuts ... you name it, he's probably had a cup of it to drink.  Anyway, he usually buys the Dunkin' Donuts brand at the grocery store (because it tastes good and doesn't cost that much) and LOVES he Starbucks (which is a very expensive habit).  I had him try this one and he said that it tastes good (actually he said that it "taste expensive, but that it was good").  He finished the entire bag off in no time! :)

review/summary: Nice flavor, nothing spectacular though
review/text: I openly admit to not being a coffee snob, with the amount of sugar and cream I add it would be hard to claim that I was very picky however I do have a few coffee's that I normally buy and like and tend to stick with medium blends. Prior to my last pregnancy I only used my french press but lately I'm back to the drip maker since its just faster and easier so I thought I'd give this pre-ground coffee a try.<br /><br />It's not bad. Granted it's not amazing either, it does have a bit stronger flavor then I'm used to but I expected that... thankfully it's just richer and not bitter which sometimes can happen with stronger coffees IMO. My mother was visiting and she prefers a very dark coffee but said that this one was acceptable (as someone who drinks her coffee black I figure she's a better judge then I am). So while I won't go out of my way to purchase this for myself it is a coffee I'd probably keep on hand for guests who like a stronger coffee.

review/summary: a coffee black and tan
review/text: Some coffees try to impress by including a particular strong added flavor or mixing in a variety of tastes so as to distract from the often bitter taste of the coffee itself.<br /><br />This Melitta Cafe doesn't do that.  Rather it has a very pure, direct and yes smooth taste that is surprisingly not bitter.  It is a coffee for those who enjoy sitting down with a hot beverage and enjoying the moment.  It does not grab your attention, but that's not what I'm looking for in a cup of coffee.<br /><br />The mix of dark and light roasts are very finely blended, and give the coffee a robust flavor, and a great, welcomed dose of caffeine.<br /><br />I'd definitely get this again.

review/text: Melitta European Roast Extra Dark is my daily coffee, so I should have known that this blend (Blanc et Noir) would be weaker than I'm used too.  If you don't like strong, dark, flavorful coffee, then Blanc et Noir may be a good fit for you, but if you like a little more "strength," you might like the European Roast Extra Dark.

review/summary: Product 4, packaging 2
review/text: I love coffee, and yet I'm not the type of person who distinguishes flavors and aromas generally coffee falls into one of two categories for me - good coffee and garbage coffee.  Good coffee is generally coffee you have to pay for, you get it at a resturant or at a coffee shop, or make it at home.  Garbage coffee is generally found free from your employer.<br /><br />This stuff falls under good coffee.  I like the scent, I love the taste, and since I love my coffee extra strong, I don't need as much of it as I generally do with store bought coffees.  I took the bag to a friends house and everyone there agreed that this was an exceptionally flavorful and enjoyable coffee.<br /><br />Now the packaging on the other hand... you're not getting that bag open without scissors.  If buying for people with arthitis go ahead and buy them some scissors too otherwise they will just sit and stare longingly at the bag.<br /><br />Final opinion - yes I would pay for this coffee, and yes I enjoyed the entire bag of it - 4 stars

review/summary: Nice mix of coffees for the days you want something "different".
review/text: I love dark roast coffee. There is nothing better than the smell, feel, and flavor of a good dark roast. Unfortunately, a lot of places thing "dark" means "burnt". After I've had some bad "dark" roast coffee, it is nice to have something a little mellower. Melitta Cafe Collection Blanc et Noir fills in nicely for those times.<br /><br />The flavor is not light roast, or dark roast. I wouldn't even really say it is somewhere in between. It is definitely not a "Medium Roast" like the Maxwell house some reviewers have likened it to.<br /><br />While this will not be replacing my dark roast anytime soon, Melitta Cafe Collection Blanc et Noir has earned its place in my pantry for those times when I just want something different. Not light, not dark, but somehow both.

review/summary: Just a good coffee - nothing spectacular
review/text: We typically buy our coffee from Trader Joe's - it's economical, tasty and you can grind it fresh at the store. But we thought we'd check out this coffee from the German Melitta Group. It's got a good, strong flavor but there's really nothing especially memorable about it. If you're looking for a good coffee, there's really nothing to object to here - but there's also nothing to boast about. It's straight-up coffee. It's also surprisingly fresh for being pre-ground which is nice.<br /><br />As a side note, it's certified Kosher. I would think that most coffee would be Kosher, but after a little research it appears that's not something you can assume. So, if you're looking for a Kosher coffee - check this one out.

review/summary: I enjoyed this coffee.
review/text: This coffee was very good at breakfast, it is low acid and brewed up in our Hamilton Beach drip machine nicely. I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 because it is a very fine grind, probably closer to an espresso grind than a drip but the description doesn't say that. It did work in the drip machine. I found that the best way to get a not to strong cup of coffee was to measure one teaspoon of coffee grounds less per cup then I normally would. Once I did that it made a very fine pot of coffee.

review/summary: Nice, smooth, medium-bodied cup of coffee
review/text: My husband and I enjoy trying various flavors/types of coffee, although we tend to prefer lighter roasts--"breakfast blend" varieties are some of our favorites.  However, Melitta's Blanc et Noir professed to be a combination of both light and dark roasts, so I decided to take a chance on the idea that it in the balance, it would not be too dark for us.<br /><br />Turns out that I was right--the mix of light and dark roasts does produce a more medium-bodied coffee.  We found the end result (made in our drip coffee maker) to rich and smooth without being bitter.  However, I can't say that the flavor was particularly remarkable or notable; it was simply a good, decent cup of coffee.  Furthermore, although I realize that the extra fine grind is supposed to be an advantage, it means that we cannot use this coffee in our French press, which we use occasionally as an alternate to our drip coffee maker.<br /><br />In the end, this makes a nice cup of coffee, but I'm not sure that I'd choose to buy it on my own, mainly because there are other products that I prefer.

review/summary: Middling
review/text: I am not sure what the rationale is for combining dark and light roast coffees, as the result you get is neither fish, flesh, fowl nor good red herring, but something akin to . . . well, Maxwell House.<br /><br />I have nothing against Maxwell House, I made and drank a lot of it in my younger days as a soda jerk, but we've moved on. Distinctive coffees are the thing now.<br /><br />My terms of reference are high, since I live on Maui, where I have easy access to Kona coffee, still the very best, and a selection of estate-grown Maui and Molokai coffees that are good but not quite as good. (You may never have tasted Kona, even if you paid for it; one of the big chains for years sold more coffee as Kona than Kona ever produced.)<br /><br />I was also not a fan of the very fine grind of this coffee, which the producer claims helps bring out the full flavor. Not necessary, and I ended up having to use two Melitta filters to keep sediment out of my cup.

review/summary: Better than everyday coffee
review/text: I thought this coffee was very good, but I drink lattes and tea more than regular coffee, so I don't necessarily trust my judgment.  As a result, I shared it with a coffee-loving colleague at work.  He brewed a pot and came back with these comments:  "The coffee is just as yum as I remember it. I made it espresso-style today.  Melitta coffee reminds me of a morning kitchen in Germany: making coffee, slicing bread and cheese, and preparing all the jams. As it's brewing, Melitta smells like coffee should smell - none of the burning scent you often get with other coffees. As for the flavor, it is dark, rich and bold yet smooth with only a slight bitter after-taste, which I actually like. I highly recommend it, especially if you're used to Folgers or other more commercial brands."

review/text: Disclaimer: I am reviewing a bag that I received for free through the Vine program.<br /><br />It's OK, decent, not remarkable. I usually prefer dark roast, and this one is a mixed blend of dark and lighter roasts, so it's not as dark as I like it. And I usually prefer to grind my own beans, at least at home. But for a bag of pre-ground coffee that you can mail order, it's not bad. I don't know if that makes it competitive, price-wise.

review/text: In the interest of being objective I must first state that I am fond of at least two other Melitta products: The European Roast and Melitta's unbleached #2 filter cones. I'm not one usually taken by fru-fru coffees, so I wasn't expecting much before trying Blanc et Noir. But I was most surprised at the taste - midway between my usual Melitta dark roast and most-favored chocolate Vietnamese #1. This is an interesting blend that will satisfy. I just wish that manufacturers would still with an honest pound, instead of manipulating ounce measurements to extract profitability - this coffee comes in slightly over 11-ounce bags.

review/summary: Surprisingly good!
review/text: I am a coffee snob of sorts. When I received this "Blanc et Noir" coffee from Melitta, I was ready to be underwhelmed. I was totally positively surprised! The very tightly sealed package kept the pre-ground coffee fresh until opening. The fine grind is suitable for cone and similar drip coffee makers. My normal brew is Peet's dark roast (French, Italian Espresso, etc.) and so I added a bit more coffee to test out the B&E blend. It came out full, rich and smooth. It is definitely a medium by my taste, but it is not a wimpy tasting coffee. it has a full and rich coffee flavor without being bitter or burnt tasting.<br /><br />Now if you really, really like the off the charts dark roast coffee, this is not the one for you. I am still likely to buy a lot more Peet's in my life. However, I will probably also get some more Melitta as a result of this test because it is a very satisfying coffee to have with breakfast or other food. It is strong enough that I still feel like I've had coffee, but not so strong that I am finishing the whole pot myself due to elimination of all other takers. In other words, you can serve it for a mixed taste crew of coffee drinkers and everyone is likely to be satisfied to one extent or another. In fact, the majority (I think I am fringe) are going to be actually impressed.<br /><br />One note: You have to cut the top of the package to open it. It will not just pull apart like many vacuum packed coffee bags. If you cut the package just between the wire re-sealing closure and the seal at the top of the bag, you should be fine with it.

review/summary: Nothing wrong, nothing special
review/text: If you're a fan of darker roasts, there's not much to dislike about "Blanc et Noir" from Melitta -- not much that I could detect, anyway. On the other hand, there wasn't a lot to set it apart from other similarly-priced dark roasts on the market. It is a perfectly serviceable coffee I was happy to have in my rotation for a week or two. But it won't displace, say, the coffee I brought back from a recent Hawaii vacation as my weekends-and-special-occasions choice, nor did it evoke all the memories of European cafes the marketing promised. But as I said, it's not a bad choice by any means if darker beans are your thing.

review/text: I was wary of this coffee before I first brewed some, because I usually find that anything described as a 'dark roast' has a bitter taste to it.  But I really liked this blend -- it makes a fairly dark coffee, but I couldn't taste a trace of bitterness or a "burnt" flavor.  Maybe that is because it is blended with a mild roast?  Who knows.  Anyway, I would definitely buy this again...makes a great morning cup of coffee: strong but not bitter.<br /><br />Note: It is very finely ground, so you may actually want to use a bit less of it than with regular ground coffee.  Also, it would NOT work in a French Press coffee maker (which needs a course grind).

review/text: Melitta's Blanc et Noir is a recommended solution for a busy lifestyle. The main benefit is that you don't have to spend time grinding coffee beans: just measure what you need and go.<br /><br />As with all coffees, you might have to experiment a bit with the serving size - I am trending towards using more coffee than directed to get the flavor I want - but the bottom line is that no matter how you measure or serve this ground coffee, you'll be rewarded with a flavorful, but not bitter cup that tastes great with or without cream and sugar (I've tried both). I think any time-challenged person who enjoys good coffee should give Blanc et Noir a try!

There was no bitterness to it (something that I really dislike in coffee).<br /><br />I used just a little more with this than my usual scoop amounts.<br /><br />We usually drink some version of Costco's Starbucks brew or Dunkin' Donuts.<br /><br />I liked the Melitta Blanc et Noir better than anything else we've had in years.<br /><br />It is already ground, fairly fine too but it brewed well in our cone filter coffee maker.

review/summary: Unusual Blend
review/text: Whereas most coffee blends involve a blend of different coffee bean varieties, this blend features a range of different roasts. I suppose it also includes different varieties but the label tells us nothing in that regard. We are only told it includes both light and dark roasts, thus the name which translates as "White and Black". The taste, of course, combines the features of both roasts and is an interesting, mild flavor with only slight acidity. I drank it black with nothing added in a variation of the French press method to get the full impression. The grind is very fine which is the most preferred these days, especially for a drip process. The fine grind might be a problem for those using unfiltered methods, such as percolator or even the French press which uses a crude metal filter(I like my coffee unfiltered). This coffee is a great choice for coffee connoisseurs.

review/summary: Not bad but not great
review/text: My husband did not care for it at all. I thought it was okay but nothing I would pay extra for. I think you definitely need to use more of the coffee than the directions call for or else it is really not that flavorful. I will probably end up mixing it with a can of my regular coffee and finishing off the bag that way.

review/summary: Good Dark/Light Blend
review/text: I'm a coffee drinker that prefers to grind my own beans because it is fresher that way. The more recently it was roasted the better. I like dark, hearty coffees, but not ones that have been over-roasted. A select few ground coffees can be good, and this is one of them. Melitta strikes a nice balance between the light and dark roasts. The dark roast predominates but the light roast helps make it smooth and flavorful. This is a fine grind and makes a more potent pot of coffee than similar amounts of your standard ground coffees like Foldgers or Maxwell House.<br /><br />They've priced this mid-range coffee competitively and I would recommend it to people who appreciate a flavorful, aromatic coffee. It cannot replace just roasted and freshly ground coffee, but you'd be hard pressed to find something much better outside of a gourmet shop. I've used Melitta's filters for years, and now I'm enjoying their coffees as well. Because of the Blanc et Noir Ground blend, I tried their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5GTO">Colombian Medium Roast</a> and found it to be quite good as well.

review/summary: Decent Coffee
review/text: I am a coffee addict or connoisseur if you prefer a more genteel description. I will not turn down any coffee as a rule, and my only motto is "the stronger the better".<br />That being said, I grind my beans in a burr grinder and have found a great brand of premeasured and preground coffee for the drip machine, and have tried more than my share of brands looking for that elusive coffee perfection. I typically go through at least one handmade latte each day and a pot of drip brew a day. Yikes! I tried this brand in both machines. I think the advertised concept, a blend of light and dark roasts is a great idea; it's something that I do myself and it makes a nicely balanced cup. Upon opening the attractive package, coffee smelled great, and I measured the usual amount for espresso. The finely ground Melitta ground beans produced crema (that means they were fresh) and before I added steamed and frothed milk, I tasted the brew. It was fine, but nothing special. Upon adding the milk the flavor really diminished and it was kind of grainy and grassy...not very appealing. To be fair, I then made a batch in the drip machine according to package description. While the espresso made with the Melitta was acceptable, the drip coffee was frankly horrible. It tasted burnt, harsh, and acidic, without any well-rounded smoothness. This is a coffee with a lovely art deco package, but not much else to recommend it. Let's just say, if I was stranded in the desert it wouldn't be half-bad. Otherwise, I'll take my tried and true coffee.

review/summary: Rich Smooth Taste
review/text: UPDATE JANUARY 2011<br />I am now a pretty regular drinker of this stuff! In fact, I just ordered some more and I note the price has gone down which makes it very afforable, take in the free shipping, and it's an absolutely delicious  steal!<br /><br />I am really enjoying this Coffee. I usually drink Folgers at home and have done so for nearly 20 years. This was a pleasant surprise, the aroma as it was brewing was scintillating, the taste (with my regular creamer and sugar) was a treat for my taste buds.<br />I finished two cups and was tempted to drink more because it was such a smooth tasting coffee. I used 6 heaped tea-spoon fulls for make 8 cups (as marked on my coffee maker) and it worked out just about right for me; though some hard line coffee drinkers make like it stronger than that!<br />The package itself was a little hard to open, I found the best way was to cut the top off with scissors and use the metal bands on the package to securely close it as airtight as possible.<br /><br />This a really nice coffee but the only way to be sure you will like it is to try it.

review/summary: Good but not great
review/text: My taste is usually for bold coffees and nothing French roasted.  I prefer Colombians and Sumatras, and various blends such as Fresh Market's Tres Rios.  However, I also keep the cheap can of Folgers around for when I'm too lazy to grind, and while it's not great, it's certainly acceptable.  The Melitta Blanc et Noir on that scale is far higher than the Folgers, but not among my favorites.  I don't see myself ever pining after it the way I would if I hadn't had my favorites in a while.  Blanc et Noir bills itself as its literal translation Light and Dark, and by blending these two I think it takes away some from the tastes of both.  It does serve as a richer breakfast type coffee if the typical light breakfast blend is too bland or weak for your taste.

review/text: This is good coffee...I think it is just short of 5-start rating.  The boldness and dark roast is tempered by the lighter roast. Bold coffee drinkers could probably make it stronger and enjoy a bold taste due to the fine grinding. I don't think any coffee drinkers will be displeased with this roast.  We made a pot for a dinner party and everyone gave it the thumbs up!

review/text: Nice strong and dark flavor without the bitterness.  I found it taste even better with half cream than milk or soya milk, which kinda mellowed the deep flavor.  I really enjoyed the coffee with two full scoop full (it is ground coffee) with a French press.  The package comes a press seal and a metal wrap to seal in the freshness.  Highly recommend that you keep it in the fridge once open and should use within 2 weeks.  Loved it.

review/summary: pleasantly surprised
review/text: When I read the name of this coffee, I figured that a mix of light and dark roasts would simply taste like a medium roast. However, I was pleasantly surprised that I was mistaken. As a blend of light and dark roast, this coffee has some distinct attributes that a medium roast can't achieve by itself.<br /><br />The flavor of this coffee leans strongly toward the dark side. The taste is full and slightly bitter, but it's not over-roasted like some dark coffees. However, the light roast comes across in the aftertaste, which is relatively mild. I find the transition from a strong flavor going down to a more subtle aftertaste to be rare, and this makes for a very interesting coffee.<br /><br />I'm impressed with the quality of this coffee, and am certain that most coffee enthusiasts would give it a thumbs up. Of course, it may not be everyone's favorite, but it's definitely worth a try. I would definitely get it again!

review/summary: High marks
review/text: I freely admit I like my coffee strong.  That's how I learned to drink it and that's how I make it.  So let me lead off by saying that I have one quibble with Melitta's coffee, but it's fixable:  If brewed according to the instructions on the bag, it's Church Coffee, a thin, bitter brew that doesn't do justice to the rather good coffee in the bag.<br /><br />I was careful, I read the instructions several times just to make sure that it was two teaspoons per six ounces of water, not two tablespoons, which is roughly what I use.  But no, Melitta insists you use two teaspoons, and so I thought "Fair enough, I'll do it their way."  That was a mistake.  While it wasn't undrinkable, it sure wasn't anything to write home about.  I will say that it made decent iced coffee later that evening, which did go a long way to improving my opinion of it.<br /><br />The next day I made it my way, and I have to say that it's really excellent coffee.  It's smooth and flavorful without a hint of bitterness.  And the iced coffee was even better this time.  I've always enjoyed Melitta coffee, and I think their Blanc et Noir is a very nice addition to their line.  It's particularly attractive at the price it's being offered at here.  But use it with the caveat that the instructions may not yield the best possible cup of coffee for your taste.  Don't be afraid to play with the measurements.

review/summary: a Drinkable Cup
review/text: As the name implies, this is a blended cup. I like this kind of coffee. This is not roasted like French Roast or even Italian roast. This veers more to the flavor that you might expect at Dunkin' Donuts. It is drinkable. It is a "session coffee" - the kind that you can enjoy, and then not worry if you want to have a second cup.<br /><br />The challenge for this kind of coffee is that it doesn't become bitter if you put too much in your filter. I made this with a Melitta filter, in a Melitta maker. I'm satisfied. There is a strong finish to this coffee, but even at a higher strength, it won't overshoot.<br /><br />I used to work in a fine hotel restaurant. We served a rich but mellow cup. This is that kind of drink. I know it says "Blanc et Noir," but it is not cowboy coffee or even Midwestern diner coffee. This is a cup that you would serve to guests without reservation.<br /><br />I drink coffee with a blend of half-and-half and 2 percent milk, and often with a bit of sugar. Many mornings, I reach for French Roast and I make it fuertissimo. So, perhaps my sense of "strong" is unusual. But, I think you could do fine with just milk on this coffee. It probably wouldn't handle too much cream.

review/summary: The Best Part of Waking Up...
review/text: Is great coffee in your cup...  Melitta Cafe Collection Blanc et Noir Ground Coffee doesn't quite make it as great coffee, but it is very good coffee. I compare it to something similar one would receive at a good, four-star hotel - it beats the coffee served at fund-raising socials, but doesn't compare to the fine coffees grown in Kona, Hawaii.<br /><br />If you follow the directions, using only 2 teaspoons of ground coffee per 6 oz. cup, you will find this a pleasant, smooth brew with which to start your morning or to keep you going into that long night.  There is none of the burnt taste some of the darker roasts are prone to having, no bitter after-taste, and no acidic flavor to this coffee.  However, if you make the mistake I initially did - yes, I didn't read the directions but used the same measurements I always do - and use 3 teaspoons per cup, you will find this an unpleasantly strong brew.  This is a coffee I would definitely serve to friends and family.<br /><br />Melita Cafe Collection Blanc et Noir Ground Coffee is a good value for anyone who wants something better than the grocery store carries, but doesn't want to go broke purchasing coffee for home brewing.  Because it uses 1/3 less coffee, due to its fine grind, one gets approximately as many cups of coffee as would be obtained from regular grind sold in one pound bags.

review/summary: Be bold, be bold, but not too bold
review/text: I love this coffee, and I would definitely buy it again. After reading a few other reviews, I think that's because I like my coffee flavorful (and not bitter), but not overly bold. This coffee has a full but subtle flavor that carries just a hint of dark beans (or French roast), but it's just a hint, not overwhelming. Very smooth: It would be easy to drink cup after cup. My only criticism is that the packaging was not as easy to open as some other coffees I drink; next time, I'll start with a pair of scissors.<br /><br />But I do plan to purchase more of this coffee; I recommend it to others with coffee taste similar to mine.

review/summary: Average mild coffee
review/text: I'm a thrifty person, and I usually buy store brand foods, but coffee is the one item we really splurge on in our house. I've recently become really picky about my coffee. I work from home, so I don't hit up Starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts on the way to work. I used to be able to literally drink ANY coffee, and wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Now I can barely stomach what I used to drink, like Folgers. These days I buy Starbucks beans and grind them at home, or use the self serve dispensers at the grocery store that are organic or green mountain brand.<br /><br />This Melitta coffee didn't disgust me, but I wouldn't start buying it exclusively as a replacement for the coffee we currently drink. When I asked my boyfriend his thoughts on the Melitta he said it was good, kinda of nutty. Then I asked him if I could replace the Starbucks beans and instantly a big emphatic "NO!" came flying out of his mouth. No consideration what-so-ever that this could be a replacement. I find it to be a mild blend, not really enough flavor for me. I tend to like the bold beans like French Roast.<br /><br />It will do in a pinch but I don't really think I'll purchase Melitta in the future.

review/summary: Adequate but wins no awards
review/text: I love Melitta products. Even use the now almost antique ceramic coffee cone to brew cups individually (they're better brewed that way).  I also admit to being a coffee snob and someone who is qualified to judge the flavor and worth of a brewed cup of "the nectar of the gods."  So I was hopeful that the Blanc et Noir would score higher than the Creme Brulee which I recently reviewed..<br /><br />While better than the Creme Brulee, I felt the Blanc et Noir lacked the full-bodied flavor I come to associate with rich, premium coffee.  I normally use three heaping measures (special pewter Melitta coffee measure) for a 10-12 oz. cup, because I prefer a full-flavor brew and my preparation of Blanc et Noir was done in this manner.  What should have been a rich and smooth brew was in actuality an acidic "thin" tasting coffee that rated slightly above average but not by much.  I realize I am spoiled by purchasing whole beans and grinding them prior to use.  I feel pre-ground coffee does not keep that freshness, so this is partially a factor.  But that aside, Blanc et Noir is not a coffee I would purchase again.<br /><br />As with my review of Creme Brulee, I am disappointed to give Blanc et Noir a less than stellar report, however, search further.  There are better brews on the market.

review/text: Not a bad cup of Joe. Smooth, medium roast flavor and smells divine and I preferred it to Starbucks. (I do not like the taste of burnt beans.) Only one little problem, I did a taste test with this up against Kroeger store brand coffee a generic.<br /><br />This was almost a dead tie. the flavor and density was comparable with the only obvious difference being that the finer ground of the Melitta meant that it was less acidic and didn't upset my stomach as much after my 4th cup. Unfortunately the disparity in price can be depressing and makes the Kroeger brand appear more reasonable to my budget.<br /><br />Too bad, I do like this coffee.

review/summary: Not my Cup of Tea
review/text: I love my coffee and I order my own from a coffee dealer.  I usually grind my own beans for the freshest taste.  I was anxious to try the Melitta Cafe when I saw it was available.  I understand that there are other Melitta blends besides the lighter French style that I received.<br /><br />My reaction to French roast coffee was reaffirmed when I tried this coffee.  That slightly burnt, bitter taste was there and, while it was minimized somewhat, I found myself disappointed.  I had that for my morning coffee and my afternoon coffee and I was going to do the same the next day.  However, I decided that I really didn't want any more of the Melitta so I switched back to the coffee I had been drinking before.  I think that those who like Franch roast coffee will enjoy this product.  As for me, I will pass.  But, hey, what do I know.  I mean, I still have most of the Blue Mountain coffee I bought in Jamaica sitting on the shelf because I didn't it was all that great.

review/summary: Excellent coffee...!
review/text: Let me start by saying that I am someone who enjoys a good cup of coffee, but by no means am I a 'coffee expert' in the analytical sense. For instance: it would be impossible for me to tell if a certain batch of coffee were from Columbia rather than Hawaii without looking at the packaging; however, that level of discrimination is not, in my experience, necessary for me to enjoy either or both varieties. My taste buds know what they like; and they, in concert with my eyes and nose, provide me with all the information I need to make a determination concerning the quality of the coffee being served to me.<br /><br />Melitta has done a great job of packaging their Gourmet Coffee Cafe' Collection, giving it a subdued yet elegant appearance that beckons one to take a closer look. Opening the bag and testing the aroma I was able to tell that this was no off-the-shelf everyday coffee: my impression was of a full-bodied coffee but without the overpowering smell of a dark roast. Time to put my coffee maker into action. Blanc Et Noir is a combination of dark and light roast coffees which should theoretically have the same flavor as a medium roast; however, this is definitely not the case as I was able to detect the dark roast as well as the mellowing influence of the light roast. I drank my first cup black and was pleased at the lack of bitterness. My second cup was with cream and sugar. Both ways produced a wonderfully flavorful cup of coffee that I enjoyed completely. This would be the perfect coffee to serve to guests, or to pamper oneself with while reading a good book.

review/summary: OK coffee, somewhat interesting
review/text: First, our family drinks an almost absurd amount of coffee.  I pull 10 to 20 espresso shots on a typical day, mostly lattes and frappucino drinks.  Occasionally, we make drip.  For reference, I won't even drink "office" grade coffee or typical garbage like Folgers.  I would rather drink a glass of water or a good tea.  So, I am rather familiar with good coffee and probably more demanding than most reviewers here.<br /><br />As a result, I would rate Melitta Blanc et Noir just OK.  It's average.  It is more bitter and acidic than I would like.  It is maybe comparable to Starbuck's coffee which isn't that great.  It is definitely better than many store/house brands.  However, there are some good to great coffees out there including Millstone, Cost Plus' varieties, Peet's, and Illy, the latter, especially being frighteningly expensive.  I do, however, encourage you to try Illy as it has a fantastic, reusable tin.<br /><br />With all that, I give it a bump to 4 stars.  That is because, here at Amazon, especially with their subscription program, it is cheap.  You would probably not notice the difference in frou-frou'ed up drinks with a lot of cream and sugar.  Also, it deserves 4 stars because it is somewhat interesting.  Blanc et Noir is a blend of dark French roast and a light roast.  I expected it to be some middling blend in between, but actually you do get a sense of both the mild roast and the more full, smoky darker roast.  It is interesting, but I'm not sure I'd like it over and over.  I prefer more single bean roasts like a good Columbian Supremo or a well-blended house.<br /><br />Finally, it is listed as "Extra Fine Grind".  It is very, very evenly ground which is impressive, but it is not that extra fine.  I would say more of just fine.  It is definitely way too coarse to use in an espresso machine, even with a pressurized portafilter.<br /><br />This product is worth a try, and also be sure to pick up a can of Illy (even for the tin) and try some good Columbian Supremo if you haven't already.  These are good reference coffees, and I made a bunch of A/B tests among them and a couple others before writing this review.

review/summary: Complex and Enjoyable
review/text: I'm sitting here this morning having a cup of Melitta Cafe Collection Blanc et Noir as I peruse the paper and facebook and look for goodies on Amazon. Let me just say that I really like this fine blend of the dark and light coffees. What you get is a coffee that's very drinkable with or without cream, as light on the palate as any American breakfast coffee. Yet there are wonderful subdued flavors of the darker and richer coffees one might expect down at the local coffee shop. My normal cup of home-brew is something along the lines of Starbucks Cafe Estima or Sumatra, so I do like the heavier, darker brews. And this Blanc et Noir just hints at those beans in a beverage which is smooth and aromatic and suitable for nearly every occasion. If you like the flavors of the darker brews but find the full-bore coffees sometimes overpowering, this is the blend for you. Blanc et Noir finishes with mild tones of citrus. Very nice.

review/summary: makes the best iced coffee, bar none
review/text: This coffee scored well when compared over a few days use with the coffees we normally use, also premium coffees. First, if you are looking for a great iced coffee, look no further.  This makes the best iced coffee, bar none. Second, my husband and I both like a strong, robust, on the dark side coffee, fine ground and black with no cream or other additions.  The price we pay for this preference is that we often go too far over the edge into bitterness.  This coffee, by blending the light with the dark, gets around this potential bitterness factor better than any coffee we've used.  We will be buying this again as right now it is in first place with us.

review/summary: Great tasting coffee
review/text: I have long been a fan of German based Melitta products, and found their coffee to be far superior to most of the mainstream popular coffees, and even some so called "exclusive" or "select" blends.<br />Blanc et Noir is one selection from their Cafe Collection, which I would put in the medium to dark roast catagory.<br />A full bodied flavor without acidity, but not too strong. That is when made in French press, I don't use old style "leave it in the pot all day" machines.<br />A lot of people have switched to the pod type or single cup brewing systems lately, and in fact coffee consumption seems down in general, in favor of herb teas and non caffeinated drinks. So it was nice to go back to an old style ground coffee taste.<br />If you like European style ground coffees, you may also like to try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CJJKRU">Douwe Egberts Intense - Real Coffee Dark Roast Ground Coffee, 8.8-Ounce Packages (Pack of 3)</a> which is Dutch, or the bold flavored <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVIRCU">Jacobs Kr&ouml;nung Coffee, 8.81-Ounce Vacuum Packs (Pack of 4)</a>.<br /><br />Another point worth mentioning is cost, these value packs here work out pretty cheap compared to pod systems bags or cups, and are even not that bad compared to everyday grocery store prices. When compared to gourmet stores like Gevalia, they are a steal, and great quality.
