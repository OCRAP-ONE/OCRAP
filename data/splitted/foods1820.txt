review/text: I tried this at a Life Time Fitness center it was awesome but at 4.00$ it was not. I found this on amazon and now I'm a subscriber I order 3 packs per month (36 units). I am happy with the way its made... organic and with its ingredients. I highly recommend all of Orgain's products but Vanilla is my favorite!

review/summary: Fantastic Flavors- Even Better Organic Nutrition
review/text: I am a long-time user of protein shakes and recently I was exposed to the harmful effects of synthetic sweeteners used in most protein shakes.  This delicious shake solved that dilemma for me- i needed protein supplements but was harming my body in other ways with the old shakes.  Orgain tastes incredible, is affordable, and super convenient.  I love this product and wont ever stop.  Finally,  you can have your cake and eat it too.

review/summary: Love the taste and texture
review/text: The chocolate flavor is not too sweet, relies on natural sugars, has veggies and fruit added, and a smooth texture.  Tastes great cold or room temperature.  It's well balanced with 16g protein, 13g sugars, 7g fat, 2g fiber, and 255 calories.  It makes a reasonable replacement for a small meal or larger snack.  For a while, I had several a day, but I now use them as a back up plan, which means they get stashed in my car, my office drawer, and my luggage when I travel.

review/summary: New Favorite Gym Drink
review/text: Orgain shakes have become my new favorite thing to drink at the gym.<br /><br />I am really picky about taste - and way too lazy to make my own shakes.  In the past, this has been a problem to putting on any weight.<br /><br />I drink one every day now during my workout.<br /><br />Anyways,  Vanilla tastes great too.  Nothing but good things to say about this drink.

review/summary: Better than any other protein/health drink I've tried
review/text: I first discovered Orgain a couple of months ago right before I had a tonsillectomy.  I went to a health food store and literally grabbed different brands and flavors of drinks to buy and test right there.  I am a picky eater and the only one I liked (and actually loved the taste of) was the chocolate fudge Orgain.  For several days after my surgery, Orgain, literally, was what I lived on.<br /><br />Once I could eat solid food, my husband and I agreed that, due to my picky taste and poor food habits, I should continue to drink Orgain.  That was fine with me as I love the taste of them.  I am now signed up with Amazon for automatic delivery and drink 1-2 a day, and my husband, who is working out and trying to build more muscle, has been drinking about 2 a day.

They are perfect!  I love the Chocolate and the Mocha and am ready to try the new Vanilla.  They are best served ice-cold.

She likes the other two flavors (vanilla and chocolate also). So wonderful that they are gluten free. Not too sweet. Glad I 'pre-ordered' as this flavor seems perpetually sold out. Amazon makes it so easy to send little treats like this to my daughter who is several states away.

review/text: Very carefully thought out recipe with good, balanced nutrition and good taste. This one does not leave a chemically aftertaste because it doesn't use artificial sweetener. It doesn't have to be refrigerated until just before you plan to drink it so you can save quite a bit buying in bulk and even more buying by subscription. I like all the flavors but Mocha is my favorite.

review/summary: Best Tasting and Healthiest Ready to Drink Meal Replacement Shake
review/text: I've been searching since the days that Kashi stopped producing their meal replacement shake mix for something that tastes just as good and is just as good for you.  I've tried both available flavors of Orgain and I find the chocolate to have no remnant of soy protein in its taste.  The shake tastes great at room temp and amazing chilled.  I appreciate that there's some remnants of veggies and fruit in the shake too.<br /><br />Potential downsides:<br />It's not all oil, sugar, and protein....although its mostly that...  So it's not exactly as good as sitting down and eating a sandwich.  The shake is only made in pre-measured little boxes so there's no opportunity to save some money with a tub of a dry mix.  The shakes are expensive too.  The trade off is better ingredients, instead of unpronounceable and artificial junk found in say, Slimfast (although that too is mostly oil, sugar, and protein...just from worse ingredient sources).  The shake is also not vegan if that's something you're looking for.  There's currently only 2 flavors of the shake too, so if variety's your thing, this isn't a good shake to try out long term.<br /><br />I still rate this 5 stars for the ingredients, the taste, and the fairly extensive nutrition content.  I wish this had more veggies and fruit in it though...vs. 50 mg each of a fruit and veggie blend.

review/text: I was the biggest Orgain fan, purchasing many cases a month. They have recently changed the formula and the new taste is bad and very different.  Also, they've removed the antioxidant complex. They also added a sweetener - Stevia which I don't understand. Usually, sweeteners are added to make products taste better, not worse. I wish they'd wouldn't have messed with a great thing.

review/summary: Delicious & Easy while Pregnant or Breastfeeding!
review/text: I currently have 9 month old breast feeding twins, so protein is a huge need for me, as it was during my pregnancy.<br /><br />It can be really hard to consume the full amount of protein that pregnant ladies should have. Orgain makes this important task so much easier and yummy! I would drink one right before bed and kept one on my bedside table (yes they actually taste great at room temp) and drink it the moment I woke up. I believe that this was a huge part of me not getting morning sickness. That's not even counting the few I always had stashed in the car for when I got stuck in traffic.<br />Now that I'm breast feeding, they are just as important to my daily nutrition. Specially great when you need something fast but you are stuck in bed or have hands full of baby. I could feed me, while I fed them.<br />It is really good to know that I can do all this without consuming fake sugars that can be dangerous to my babes or lots chemicals that most commercial shakes have. This shake has a great wide array of the good stuff and little or none of the bad.<br /><br /> Amazon Subscribe & Save  gives you pretty much the best price I have ever found.<br /><br />Great Uses:<br /><br />  * Put them in coffee at home, wow!<br />  * Make them the base of a larger blender smoothie<br />  * On your bedside for late night breastfeeding refueling<br />  * On your bedside for morning sickness prevention<br />  * In you diaper bag for mommy fuel<br />  * Glove box for getting thru traffic thats makes you late for meals<br />  * Frozen as a desert!

review/text: SO glad to see this on Amazon with free super saver shipping!  I tried Orgain after reading Dr. Julian Whitaker's<br />glowing recommendation. I was most pleasantly surprised at how tasty it is, especially considering all the healthful ingredients it contains.  I found it at my local health food store and continue to keep it on hand.  It is great icy cold but is also good at room temperature, making it handy to toss in a bag or purse while going out and about for those who need a snack or have to miss a meal for one reason or another.  When I need to leave the house early, I stick a straw in the container and sip it for my breakfast as I drive. My daughter-in-law who has GERD found that she tolerated Orgain well.  Love both flavors but the vanilla has the edge.

review/summary: Organic Orgain
review/text: After my first drink I was hooked on Orgain creamy chocolate fudge.<br />I had been looking for an organic protein shake and came upon this brand by accident. The 10 servings of fruits and vegetables is bonus. I wish it was lactose free. Though I handle it better that pure milk.<br />It taste like regular chocolate milk and is heavenly when chilled. I find it an excellent meal replacement but I think one a day is sufficient due to it being very rich.<br />It comes in a tetra pak and it feels different than drinking from a soda can so I prefer to pour the drink into a glass.<br />Orgain is pricey $3.49 Bartells, $3.30 Amazon and $2.99 Whole foods. It is cheaper than a sandwich for lunch.<br />For a chocolate lover like me Orgain gives me my daily chocolate fix.

review/summary: The best protein drink
review/text: We've tried lots of protein drinks over the years, but this one is the best we've ever had. It tastes great and it's good for you (no fake sugars, no bad-for-you fats, lots of vitamins and minerals). In no other dimension would you catch me eating beets, but supposedly they're in this drink. I sure don't taste it if that's true! It would be nice if there were a bit more fiber, but 2g isn't horrible. The only true negative for this product is the price. They are very expensive; however, for a ready-to-drink meal, it's the easiest, most convenient and tastiest alternative we've found. The vanilla flavor is most popular in my family, but I like the chocolate one, too. Overall I don't think you can go wrong with this drink.

review/text: This is honestly the first protein drink I've ever had that I absolutely love!  It's rich and chocolatey, and it doesn't leave that horrible chalkiness in your mouth like nearly every other protein drink.  It tastes pretty similar to a good, rich chocolate milk.  It was recommended to me by my doctor, but I was skeptical of trying yet another protein drink that I'd waste my money on.  I bought one container at a local store to give it a try.  I'm in love!  I'm not sure what exactly Orgain has done to make this taste so great, but with organic ingredients, I'm not sure I care.  I 100% recommend this to anyone - even if you're skeptical of protein drinks.  Haven't yet tried the vanilla or mocha, but looking forward to doing so.

review/summary: Tastes so much better than a "health drink"
review/text: Firstly, the health benefits: It's only about 250 calories and has just about every vitamin, mineral, and other healthy thing you can stick in it, not to mention it's organic. (I also LOVE that they aren't in plastic bottles). There are a gajillion other things I could say, but really you just need to read the nutrition info for yourself. I bought these to drink for breakfast since I am rarely hungry enough to eat actual food in the mornings and I was pleasantly surprised by how GOOD they taste (Very fudgey.) I am now somewhat obsessed with these and find myself craving them when I'm not in the mood for a big meal, or when I'm sick and I don't want solid foods. They keep me full for at least 2 hours, not as much as a real meal, but plenty for breakfast. I can't seem to find these in stock at any nearby stores, which is fine since you automatically get super saver shipping on these, but beware that the price will skyrocket when they're backordered (these things are like liquid gold). I can't start my morning without these anymore and insist on dragging them with me on vacations and trips. Beware the vanilla flavor though, which I hated so much that I threw them away (no one would take them off my hands). They were lumpy and left a gross after taste. I haven't tried the mocha flavor since I'm not into coffee, but it sounds like it would be good if you are a coffee drinker! I hope they come up with some other flavors to try!

review/summary: Best Protein Shake
review/text: Amazon sent these ready to drink protein shakes which had issues, the protein had separated (or maybe curdled) I shook the container for a minute or so and was not bad, but still felt weird about it. I contacted Orgain and they said Amazon might have some warehouse storing issues, they right away replaced the product and the difference between what Orgain sent and amazon sent was the difference between a very refreshing drink and (drink is ok, why these amazing reviews). This drink really fills me up, I usually drink this in the evening with dinner (steamed veggies, fruits). Helped me reduce my weight. I highly recommend this drink to everyone, just look at the ingredients, all natural, organic & simply amazing.  Excellent Customer service from Orgain too. I wish I could give 1 star for amazon's service and 5 stars for orgain when I ordered the first time. BTW I have ordered more of these RTD shakes from amazon and this time I think they got it right! I only wish this drink would come in quart size and becomes more economical for busy people.  This product will be part of my diet for a long time, my wife loves it too!  I will try the Mocha variety next time. Again Orgain thanks for this great product.

review/text: Hands down, this is simply the best protein/meal replacement I've ever had.  They use real fruit extracts and wholesome ingredients.  Aside from these nice points, it tastes great; like a milkshake you would make for yourself.  No nasty/gritty taste of powdered protein or chalky powder taste.  Just all goodness.  My favorite flavor is Ice Cafe Mocha, but I will happily settle for the Creamy Chocolate Fudge until I can get the other from Amazon!  I thank Orgain 3 times a day for creating this beverage!!!!

review/summary: Love Orgain
review/text: Just read the ingredients label....fantastic!  So far I have tried the chocolate and vanilla and I signed up for auto-ship.  Orgain is delicious and makes a great breakfast for on-the-go people.  Also, if your children don't always want to eat breakfast, this would be perfect drink on their way to school.  It is very filling and I like knowing that it is a healthy choice.  The auto-ship is a lot cheaper than the store prices, and you get free shipping!

review/summary: Good product.
review/text: I purchased my twelve pack in the ten days leading up to Hurricane Irene. Turned out to be a great idea.  These were a stand-by during and after the storm as there was no need for electricity. Looking forward to having one thoroughly chilled.  I was astonished by the list of ingredients and the whopping protein content in the Orgain. This is a very good value when you consider the ingredients and cost in comparison to other brand-name mrps. Orgain tastes good and there is no weird after-taste or chalkiness like most mrps.  I like the packaging, too. These are a great grab 'n go.<br /><br />I also use Ultimate Life Ultimate Meal Replacement which I love, but this tastes better and requires no preparation.

review/summary: Hands down the best protein drink on the market.
review/text: I have tried lots of powders and shakes over the years usually sticking to with one for a few weeks then getting tired of it. Orgain taste so good that I never get tired of drinking it. I know you might look at the price and want to shy away at first but trust me you won't find anything that is even close in quality and taste on the market. The boxes are quick and convenient, I grab one on my way out the door in the morning and enjoy it on my drive to work. I have been drinking these for just over a year and still look forward to them in the morning. These are also great substitute to an evening bowl of ice cream.<br /><br />Thank you Orgain for developing the perfect shake!

review/summary: Great!!!
review/text: I have been getting the Orgain for a few months now on auto delivery. I like the vanilla best, but the chocolate is great too. I recently contacted Orgain directly because of an issue with the vanilla I was having. It was chunky (not normal)and I wasn't sure it was safe to drink. My husband called them for me directly to see what the problem might be. They were very nice and informed my husband they were indeed safe to drink and that sometimes the protein might separate due to temperature fluctuations but there was nothing wrong with the product. They asked for our address and said they would send a replacement out immediately even though I buy it through amazon. I really love this product. I don't like to eat a lot of meat, and I never get enough protein, and this helps me a lot. It's easy to carry with you and I take it when I travel as well.

review/summary: Tastes great, organic ingredients, high cholesterol
review/text: For those who require additional daily calories and nutrients, or those looking for a quick and delicious meal replacement in between meals, this shake is the real deal. Aside from the loads of nutrients packed into this powerhouse shake, I was amazed at how great it tasted. I kept referring back to the label to remind me how healthy this drink was because it tastes so good. Hands down the best meal replacement shake I've ever tried. And not to mention, it fills you up for at least a few hours. I loved the vanilla, but the chocolate is simply scrumptious for all you chocolate lovers. I'm ordering another case so that I'm not without any of these fabulous grab-and-go meals.<br /><br />UPDATE (08/22/12)<br /><br />Ok, so I recently had my cholesterol checked and was shocked to learn that it was a little on the high side (actually 209/200). This may not seem like a big deal to most, but I am a vegetarian who does not consume meat, or much dairy including cheese, milk, and eats a 50% raw vegan diet. Orgain is made with whey and has 20 mgs of cholesterol per serving, so if you're consuming more than one drink a day...well, you get the picture.<br /><br />I love the taste and the organic ingredients, but until the company starts making a vegan alternative with soy, rice or almond milk, I'll have to spare my arteries and heart by passing.

review/summary: Delicious taste, long lasting protein energy
review/text: I have tried, like most reviewers here, all sorts of different WMR shakes and bars. There is something really nice about the Orgain Chocolate Shakes, not only in the way that they taste but also in the way that they keep my energy up for a longer amount of time than other meal replacements. The fat content may have something to do with that, which is kind of counter-intuitive to my DIY dieting strategies, but good fats really do have excellent energy as any nutritionist will tell you. The bottom line is that these shakes really do live up to their reviews and, while they do seem expensive, products with high nutritional value usually are. By a pack and I promise you won't be disappointed! Thumbs up to Amazon for putting the Subscribe and Save program on these as well.

review/summary: Best tasting one I've tried
review/text: I have been looking for a decent-tasting meal replacement drink for MONTHS. The healthiest ones taste like liquid grass and the best tasting ones aren't at all healthy.<br />This hits somewhere in-between healthy-wise but tastes GREAT! I found it while shopping at whole foods (in L.A.) they were giving out samples and, after tasting both vanilla and chocolate, I walked away with four boxes of each.<br />I love that it's organic and doesn't use soy-based protein (my soy-allergic son can drink it too!). I love the flavor and the natural, whole grain sweetener. No chalky taste or aftertaste from splenda or any of that other fake garbage.<br /><br />Only reason it's not 5 stars--could have used a little more fruits and veggies in the blend. And at least a couple of grams more fiber. I would have liked a higher vitamin profile. But this way you COULD drink 2/day and not worry about OD'ing on Vitamin A. Lol<br /><br />Great as an after-workout protein boost with a salad or healthy, whole grain snack (multi-grain tortilla chips and hummus?)<br />;)<br /><br />So glad I found it.

The pediatrician had been telling me to supplement my skinny girls with pedicure, but I refused. We love it!<br /><br />This is how we feel now: wtf?<br /><br />I also ordered from vitamin shoppe because amazon was out. I had no idea it was changing, because I wouldn't have bothered ordering a boatload for myself and my friends. Now we are stuck. I can sometimes mix it into a shake for my girls but not my hubby. PLEASE DON'T MAKE US SWITCH TO PEDIASURE! my girls are still very thin and this helped them gain weight heathily ( though they would have originally preferred chips and cookies like every other kid).<br />Please change this back, or make it better. Nobody likes goop.  Consider myself brand loyal, and I don't want to have to start looking for a competing natural weight gain supplement.

review/text: I can tell you from experience this is the best protein (meal replacement) drink I have ever tried.  It does not taste chalky, and it has absolutely no awful aftertaste! In fact if I had to make a comparison it taste almost identical to a really good chocolate milk.  This stuff is great, the only negative I have is its a bit low on the protein side so I usually have to eat it with a protein bar.  I am a 6'1 Male and I run about 12 miles a week though so my protein cravings are a bit higher than average!  Highly recommend it to anyone!!  If you do the subscription on Amazon its free shipping and you save 15%, awesome deal since its already $9 dollars cheaper than Wegmans!

review/summary: Orgain hit a grandslam
review/text: Finally, there is an actually healthy RTD shake! I would like to shake the hand of the developer for making a healthy drink for an affordable price. I've heard enough educated people warn about the other RTD drinks like muscle milk (which I used to drink for a lack of alternatives) that I figured I better find something a with higher quality ingredients even if I end up spending a little bit more. Well Orgain is very reasonably priced and isn't filled with garbage preservatives and msg derivatives. I went through 2 12 packs and am sold since the taste has remained delicious throughout (sometimes you initially like something but eventually get olfactory & taste exhaustion). IMO Orgain hit a home run with this RTD mix.<br /><br />About the only thing I wish Orgain would change is to offer a mix without the added vitamin mix. I like the veggie blend, fruit blend, and anti-oxident blend that is included, but since I already take other high-quality supplements I don't think the vitamin blend is necessary even if it is in relatively low-amounts. Plus, adding vitamin powder tends to reduce the taste quality.

review/text: Orgain is a great product!  It is an organic drink full of vitamins and minerals, green tea, antioxidants, 16 grams of protein and only 255 calories!  It also tastes great.<br />I am using Orgain to help me lose weight.  It is a perfect meal replacement because the high level of protein keeps me from getting hungry.  I have tried drinks of this nature before and they had a terrible aftertaste and didn't "agree" with my system.  Not so with Orgain.  I drink the chocolate flavor and it tastes like chocolate milk to me.<br />My son uses this product as a protein drink after workout.  It works very well for him.  He actually researched the product for us and found that it was developed by a physician that had been through cancer treatments.  He wanted to develop a drink that was very healthy that he could have when he couldn't handle regular food.  Orgain was the result.<br />I would highly recommend Orgain for a dieter, a sports enthusiast, and someone on the go needing a healthy meal replacement.

review/summary: Aboslutely Deeeelish!
review/text: So I am not really a hard core athlete or anything. Just an average person trying to take better care of myself. I recently started walking 5 to 6 miles a day and reducing my caloric intake (about 1200 daily currently) as I am about 50 lbs over weight. I work with kids and have a very weird schedule, with that it sometimes difficult for me to get a good healthy meal in.<br /><br />So, I found these last week on Amazon and decided to try them. I got the creamy chocolate fudge and it's scrumptious! I threw mine in the freezer for about 10 minutes before I drank it, that's just a personal preference because I like milk products very cold. I have no complaints at all. It doesn't give you that funky after taste I've experienced with other drinks. I am happy I put this on my monthly subscribe list!<br /><br />Enjoy!

The one thing I wish is that they'd use glucose instead of sugar, but at least they use organic cane sugar. Vanilla is my fave, but the chocolate is yummy, too. It tastes like a rich hot chocolate that's been chilled<br />BUT...  Amazon is totally flaky about keeping these available. I've been ordering 2-4 cases regularly & they're often out of stock so prepare ahead. I ordered on Nov. 18 & now they don't even show them as available. VERY ANNOYING!

review/summary: Wonderful product from a wonderful company
review/text: I really love these shakes. They taste reasonably good (very good for a protein shake), are healthy and do not have the additives that most other shakes have. If you have lots of allergies or are looking for a "clean" protein shake without sugar substitutes, this is a fantastic option. I have bought  these many times. However, there was a problem with this order and Amazon said they would not fix it. I contacted Orgain directly and they responded immediately and fixed it immediately. I am so grateful that now I have found a good tasting protein shake without soy, artificial sugar substitutes, or stevia.I cannot recommend this product and company enough! Like some other reviews said, it tastes best cold and out of a glass, but I also take it on the road with me.

review/summary: Very Good, But the Chocolate is better.
review/text: I'm not a meat eater therefore I need extra protein and found these Orgain products during a trip to Whole Foods. The clerk there described them to me as a completely balanced portion of Carbs/Protein/Fat using all natural food products and nothing artifical.  She said, on top of that, they actually taste GOOD!  She was right!  I love these things.  I have only briefly read up on her claims, but from what I can tell, it's all true.<br /><br />The only cons I have found to this product is 1)Cost.  They are pretty expensive to use on a regular basis.  2) The serving is 255 calories and it doesn't quite keep me satisfied as a "meal" but has too many calories to consider it a snack. I'm not too fond of the vanilla.  It's got a good flavor, but the few times I've had it, I've gotten "clumps" at the bottom of the container.  That grosses me out.  Never happened with the Mocha or Chocolate flavors though.  The chocolate is my favorite but the mocha is good too.  I have one of these every morning with breakfast along with a small spoon of peanut butter for a little more protein and calories to sustain me a little longer than these do on their own.

review/summary: Did not like the vanilla bean...
review/text: I purchased both the vanilla bean and chocolate based on all the 5 star reviews, protein, organic, and nutritionally equivalent to 10 servings of fruits/veggies.  The chocolate was okay, but the vanilla bean had a strange after-taste....still not sure how to describe it - reminded me of cornbread and soybeans.  Adding frozen fruit and blending it helped a little, but didn't completely mask the weird after-taste.  Maybe it was a 'bad batch,' but the expiration date was March 2012, so I don't believe that was the probem.  Unfortunately, taste is a HUGE factor for me, so even though I like everything else about these shakes, I won't be buying again.

review/summary: Vanilla has odd note in the flavor and is pretty "watery"...just okay
review/text: I bought this in the vanilla cause the nutritional profile seemed good for hubby (who has trouble keeping weight on since we ditched most starches). He's not much into chocolate-milk type things. I got the case today, chilled a few, and tasted it.<br /><br />There's that weird aspect to the taste--first kinda like bacon, then sorta green. It's really unpleasant in the first sip. Fortunately, after a few more sips, you start to get used to it and can get the vanilla vibe better. I'm assuming it's the veggie component in there making me cringe at first--since I don't normally have veggie smoothies masquerading as vanilla shakes. I like my veggie smoothies overtly, unapologetically veggie-green. I like the taste of the Green Magma or Green Goddess type smoothies  that have spinach, celery, cucumber, parsley, etc. :) (Don't know why my first sip of Orgain hollered, "bacon!" at me, but there it is. Offputting.)<br /><br />The shake is thin--watery even. NOT creamy or thick.<br /><br />I could drink this if I needed unto. I've had some protein shakes that made me gag. This did not, it went down easily, no weird slimy texture, no weird chalkiness, just that odd smoky/then/green vibe. It's not something I could say was tasty.<br /><br />Maybe the chocolate flavor hides that weird taste thing going on better than the vanilla. I like the Amazing Grass that has the cocoa, so I could see that working. Still,  I doubt I'll order it to find out. I hope hubby likes this flavor. I don't really want to finish this case.

review/summary: PLEASE READ EDIT BELOW! If you like whey based supplements...
review/text: If you like whey based supplements, and are used to that kind of taste, you might like this. Otherwise, stay away, FAR away. Do not expect a delicious, refreshing smoothie or an 'Ensure' type of meal replacement product. This is nicely organic, but unless shaken hard and chugged in a few seconds, there is a bunch of sludge at the bottom. I myself do not like to drink it, it is a bit too sweet, and the sludge factor is kinda creepy. Adding a frozen banana and blending is fine, and I even cook with it. I made a fresh fruit cobbler using this instead of milk and cutting back on the sugar.<br />EDIT....Above is my original review. It was too late to call Amazon so I was just going to let it go, long story short, I tried it again, and it is DELICIOUS! Even the color was different, an off white instead of deep tan. I suspect Amazon stored it near a heater. NO goop at the bottom, and it tastes fresh and sweet, totally fine without anything added. I emailed the company, they responded and sent coupons, wooHOO! So great taste, attentive customer service...I'll be buying more.

review/summary: Sorry to disagree but........
review/text: Seems most people love these Orgain shakes.  This fact really, really makes me wonder.  I don't normally like to leave negative reviews of anything, but I feel it's my duty to express my difference of opinion.  I have tried only the "chocolate", and I use quotation marks because it tastes like no chocolate I have ever tasted in my entire life, and I'm a girl who knows her way around chocolate.  It was absolutely the most disgusting protein drink I have ever tasted.  If you put bark mulch, lawn clippings and a little bit of manure in a blender with milk and drank it - that might be a close comparison to the taste of this stuff, in my humble opinion.  I can't even believe I spent money on these, or that anyone else does.  Maybe if you're one of those people who drinks wheatgrass or eats carob like it's really chocolate, or one of those other "healthy" and a way too earthy concoctions, you'll like it.  If you have normal tastebuds, run - don't walk -  the other way from this stuff.

review/summary: Surprisingly Tasty!!
review/text: I first discovered Orgain (chocolate flavor) at Farm to Market. Although very skeptical, I found the high protein content to be appealing, so I purchased it, and cautiously tried it a couple days later, room temperature.  I was delighted at its great taste!  And after reading the nutrition label, I realized this could be an extremely healthy and great-tasting solution to being too busy (or too lazy) to prepare food.  I ordered a case from Amazon, and chilled them... even better, IMO.  Now, not only do I feel healthier, less hungry, and have more energy, but I also broke through the pound plateau and have lost weight since I started drinking Orgain.  I've recommended it to family members, and I continue to drink it myself.  I'm so glad I took an uncharacteristic risk and tried it.

review/summary: Thanks for ruining a great product
review/text: This shake was one of the last shakes I could find that was both energizing, good for me (especially the non-gluten part), and helped me gain weight. I recently had 2 surgeries, and was looking forward to using orgain to get better. Had I known they were going to completely botch the formula, I would've ordered 10 cases beforehand.<br /><br />But I order 3 cases a month ago... and they were so undrinkable i assumed we got a bad batch of spoiled ones. But there were 3 separate cases like this... with the individual drinks inside tasting 'spoiled'. The expiration date seemed okay.<br /><br />Well, now its clear that the product wasn't spoiled... the formula was spoiled.<br /><br />I'm just so, so disappointed. Orgain had become a major supplement towards my health and recovery process after an injury I sustained last year and was hoping it would continue to be so during my recovery phase after the surgery.<br /><br />That's the type of mindset this drink was created for, right? A doctor made it because he knew the need for healthy, essential amino acids, antioxidants, minerals, and organic blends to help someone gain weight, especially if they're been sick? A formula he concocted after beating cancer? Why not stick that??<br /><br />Am very disappointed to see this cheap change destroy the product that the brand was about.<br />Why should anyone prefer this over any other pre-made drink other than its hypoallergenic aspects? Many of the younger, healthier guys who're drinking this because it was simply better for you ounce for ounce than other mixes... well, good luck keeping them now. Especially with the huge change in taste. Just... augh. You can't even get it down.<br /><br />Am very sad to see such an amazing product be gutted without warning to its loyal consumers. If there really is a Doctor out there in charge of this company... well, I hope you still have a say in it, that you're reading these reviews, and hopefully that you'll evaluate your altered product for yourself and decide whether or not its something you would've preferred to the old orgain when you were recovering and rebuilding healthy mass. I imagine you would say - "no" - the old orgain was far more beneficial.<br /><br />I'm now looking for a new supplement shake. Very sad to see the old Orgain go.<br /><br />Anyone have any suggestions for other similar brands?

review/summary: Taste and Composition Change
review/text: As other reviewers have pointed out, I am also disappointed in the reformulation of this product and in the fact that the company didn't properly disclose this information. I buy this in bulk for personal use and, as others, also thought for a minute that I got a shipment of expired or spoiled product. To clarify, both the taste and the consistency have changed from before. The product is now thicker and overall tastes closer to typical protein drinks which for my personal taste is a letdown. There are dozens of other protein drinks on the market and this one had a distinctive taste and consistency that are now both gone. I will look for a replacement, since this is part of my daily diet.

review/text: As someone with digestive issues, I was so happy to find Orgain to help me gain and maintain my weight.  The ingredients are superior to most products out there and could serve as a meal on the go.  The new formula change, however, was not for the better.  It leaves a chalky aftertaste and just does not taste as good as the original.  As someone who does not have cancer, I also liked that I was getting additional anti-oxidants in the original formula. I am not sure who they used as taste testers, but the original was far better than the new stuff.  I seriously hope they consider going back to the original formula or making some changes to improve the new formula.

review/summary: You can't find a better product than this!
review/text: I first tried this product at my local Whole Foods grocery store and loved it!  What I really enjoy about it is that I'm not drinking junk, no chemicals, no additives, no food coloring...  Nothing bad!  Both flavors, the chocolate and vanilla, are tasty!  I'm also vegetarian and a majorly picky eater, so this product really suited my problems of not intaking enough protein.<br /><br />What made me a believer in this product is that I was given a suggestion to drink a protein shake, ala Orgain, about 15-60 minutes after working out at the gym.  I've given this a test trial for a week and noticed dramatic results.  I recover faster, easier, and I'm energized after the fact.  I sleep better at night too.  I missed dinner the day that Disneyland was open for 24 hours for Leap Day and took one of these along.  I felt great the whole night, only had three hours of sleep, and absolutely no fatigue when I went to work plus no ill-effects the following day.<br /><br />My boyfriend would scrunch up his face seeing me drink these.  He also is now a supporter of the product by caving into one of these yesterday night.  He came back home after playing a 1 1/2 hour match of ping pong, was really sleepy and tired, but wanted to go back out to play badminton.  He drank one of these and about 20 minutes later, felt good enough to go play badminton.  He said it felt like he was never tired initially and was still feeling good after playing for an hour.<br /><br />Instead of reaching for a Red Bull, soda, coffee, or something else with a ton of caffeine for a boost, drink this.  I subscribe for a monthly shipment for both flavors of this product now from this site for the free shipping + additional discount.  You won't regret it!  Thank you, Amazon.com, for carrying this phenomenal product!

review/summary: Great protein alternative
review/text: I used to drink these daily as a meal replacement while feeling very poorly.  I was able to maintain a level of energy that I would not have had otherwise.  They are also delicious-tasting when cold.  I found I couldn't really drink them at room temperature.  They're convenient on the go and I feel good about the ingredient list.  I prefer the chocolate but actually found the vanilla very pleasant as well, almost like melted vanilla ice cream or rich vanilla soymilk.  The chocolate is a bit chalky, but more in a cocoa powder sort of way, so not bad.<br /><br />As someone who doesn't eat much meat or dairy, these are a great alternative for me once in a while.  I was nearly living off of them for several weeks last summer, and feeling reasonably good while doing so, but then sort of went cold turkey.  The bottom line is that real, whole foods are always going to be better for you but if that isn't an option, these are a better alternative than junk food or nothing.  I still have a case and a half left and will probably consume them here and there, sparingly.  I do recommend them, especially in place of typical protein supplements.

review/summary: Highly Disappointed in Sudden Flavor Change & Store Unavailability
review/text: I've been researching Orgain online trying to figure out what happened considering I used to live on it but now can no longer even FIND it. Like many of the other reviews mention - I lived on this stuff for breakfast and would purchase it by the case for months. I immediately noticed the flavor change that other reviews have mentioned (I always ordered the chocolate flavor) and agree the new ingredient flavor change was NOT for the better. I was very disappointed.<br /><br />Then I suddenly realized that Orgain was no longer available at ALL in my local Whole Foods where I used to find it in both the shelf and chilled sections of the store. I then noticed that my 'subscribe & save' case shipping from Amazon quit shipping entirely after a years on-going subscription. I mentioned this to the friend who first introduced me to Orgain only to hear her tell me that our very popular and local vegetarian grocery store, Rainbow Grocery, has also quit selling it. I assumed that Orgain went out of business but I am still finding it online here at Amazon (just no longer with subscribe & save option) - and the official website appears to be up and running (with Whole Foods still quite confusingly being listed as a retail provider). I checked another Whole Foods retail store in another city and they, too, have quit selling this product which leads me to believe that Whole Foods has backed out entirely.<br /><br />Super frustrated and really disappointed on all counts. I am actively seeking, like other customers, a new replacement. I tried Muscle Milk the other day -- GROSS!

review/summary: HORRIBLE change to the original orgain
review/text: I had my whole family hooked on Orgain. I made my kids drink one every morning with their breakfast. It was my breakfast every morning as well as my husbands. We loved Orgain so much that we had several cases auto shipped to us every month. Then a couple months ago, we thought we got a bad batch of the iced mocha and so we returned them and tried getting them locally in a store by us. Same horrific taste. At the same time, we were dropped from the auto ship program and it was getting harder to find it in the local stores in that flavor so we assumed they changed the formula but the Vitamin Shoppe had no idea and there was no indication on the packaging saying that there were any changes made. So, we tried switching to the chocolate fudge. It was delicious so we just changed our auto ship to the new flavor and for a couple months got by with the chocolate fudge. Then, we got dropped from the auto ship again and had a harder time finding it in the stores. Apparently, they changed the chocolate fudge formula also. I just got 2 new cases and they have that same DISGUSTING taste that the iced mocha had. Needless to say we can't drink it anymore, will be returning what we have and actively trying to find a replacement drink. I can't tell you how disappointed we are. All I can say is that unless they change the formula back, I'll never buy it again. It isn't even drinkable. It's absolutely revolting!

review/summary: Price increase.
review/text: Let me join my voice to the chorus of people upset with Amazon for the price increase for Orgain drinks.  As others have mentioned, the price has gone up from $28. to $44.  Even though this is an excellent product, I will no longer be buying Orgain from Amazon.<br /><br />Perhaps when enough people have stopped buying Orgain, Amazon and the makers of this product will come to their senses and bring down the price to former levels.  I can already hear readers of this review saying, "Nice try!"<br /><br />Does anyone have recommendations for products that do the same thing as Orgain, but for a reasonable price?

review/summary: LOVE LOVE LOVE ORGAIN!!!!
review/text: This is a staple in my house at all times. I use it as a meal replacement since i try to eat 4-5 small meals a day at about 250 calories, which is what Orgain has. It also has an antioxidant berry blend and a greens blend mixed in which is unlike any other protein drink. But the best part is it tastes like chocolate milk and i always want to drink it. AMAZING!! Chocolate fudge is the best flavor by the way. No need to even go to the vanilla or mocha since the chocolate is so delish!

review/summary: Orgain
review/text: I am on medications for cancer and among the many side effects of the treatment is loss of taste and appetite with a resultant weight loss. Orgain was recommended as a food supplement although I had been using Ensure. I found Orgain to be not only delicious but it has had a very positive effect in terms of halting weight loss and providing excellent nutrients. Since there is no lactose content it is also far more tolerable. Recommend highly.

review/summary: Love this newest flavor
review/text: What can I say? Orgain is the best protein shake I've ever had, and I've tried many of them over the years. Out of the three flavors, this newest flavor is definitely the best. I have used and continue to use Amazon's 'Subscribe & Save' option for all of the Orgain shakes, as I drink them at least four to five times per week and don't have to worry about searching for them all over town. In my area, the Whole Foods by me sells out often and generally only has the Vanilla Bean flavor in stock (my least favorite). The local health food store, hardly ever has them as well. So, I was quite happy after finding the Orgain shakes on Amazon, over a year ago.<br /><br />Nutrition wise, I can honestly say that there is definitely an increase in energy after consistently drinking these, but not in that unnatural, over stimulated way that caffeinated or chemical laden products can sometimes leave you feeling. I use them as meal replacements when pressed for time, when my appetite is light, and/or an hour before working out...for the energy boost.<br /><br />Cost wise, if you're on a tight budget, this product might be a bit of a splurge, but is still less per shake, than the average latte, or fast food meal. Which is obviously, not as healthy for you.<br /><br />Currently, I switch between drinking the Cafe Mocha and Chocolate Fudge and would highly recommend this product. For those like myself, who work in an office setting, these are a great option to keep in the work fridge, in order to steer clear of that office snacking area (the vending machine, that co-worker who loves to bake, the Friday doughnut day, etc.).

review/summary: Great Taste
review/text: I saw this in a wellness email I get and checked out their website and was impressed. I was able to locate this at my local grocery store and tried the chocolate, vanilla and the coffee mocha. I only liked the chocolate the other two flavors were doable but I would not buy again but that is just me as I typically find that drinks with these flavors do not suit me. I really enjoy the chocolate and can drink it cold out of the carton without having to add/blend anything with it which makes it a great grab and go meal/snack. The price from Amazon is cheaper then the grocery store and the subscribe and save / auto delivery make it that much better. This will remain as a go to item in my pantry.

review/summary: FINALLY, Amazon offers Prime Shipping for the Mocha Flavor
review/text: I am a huge fan of Orgain; stumbled upon it a few months ago accidentally, when I was looking for an organic, high quality meal replacement/protein drink with no artificial sweeteners.  I don't like stevia either.  I love the ingredients list on Orgain- organic whey & milk proteins!!, brown rice syrup to avoid that sugar crash, and a great blend of vegetables and fruits.  I can't even tell from drinking that it contains kale, beet, spinach, carrots, and tomatoes.  The 16g of protein per asceptic container is perfect and ideally sized.<br /><br />I purchase at least 5-6 cases of Orgain a month, because I drink 2-3 a day.  At least 1 as a post-workout shake, and the others as meal supplements.  Orgain also helps me stay awake at night for evening classes, and are more preferable to consuming Red Bull or 5-hour energy drinks.  I credit Orgain (along with a healthy diet) for helping me lose weight and pursue my fitness goals.<br /><br />Big fan of the sweet vanilla and chocolate flavors, was hoping to try the Cafe Mocha flavor, but Amazon didn't offer any with Prime shipping...until now!  The coffee flavor is delicious; there's a slight coffee-ish aftertaste, but I like it.  Its flavor profile lies somewhere between the more neutral vanilla and the stronger chocolate flavors.  There's also no caffeine in the Mocha varieties.  Unlike the vanilla flavor, I'm happy to report that the Mocha flavors do not seem prone to  whey protein aggregation.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and grab a Cafe Mocha Orgain!  Pop it in the fridge, and it'll be like drinking a nice iced coffee from Starbucks, but much healthier.  Just a final caveat; the Cafe Mocha flavor seems very popular, and frequently goes out of stock.  Buy it when you can!

review/summary: Great product and outstanding Orgain customer service
review/text: I have been a fan of Orgain for over a year now. I recently subscribed-and-saved so I get a shipment of the Vanilla Bean flavor monthly. I have delayed gastric emptying and the Orgain drinks are helpful on bad days. They are way better all around than the alternatives for meal replacement drinks. I recently had an unexpected quality issue with the most recent carton she received, so I contacted Orgain about the problem. They replied promptly, offered a replacement, and followed up thoroughly. The quality of customer service I received was great--you don't get that very often. The company really seems to care about putting a quality product out there and keeping their customers happy. Orgain: Keep up the good work. Amazon: Keep offering good deals on this awesome product. Everyone else: Try Orgain, you'll be glad you did.

review/text: Best protein drink out there. I've been drinking protein shakes for over 10 years and have tried every single brand available. The powdered, the ready made, the big jugs, the protein water, etc. This tastes so good it should not be healthy! And on top of the great protein, there is nothing bad in it! Even my two boys love them. The chocolate is the best, in my opinion, but the vanilla and mocha are still better than anything out there. I travel all the time for work and now that I've discovered these great drinks, I have to figure out a way to get 5 of them in my checked luggage for every week that I'm gone from home! That's how much I love them!

review/summary: Amazing!!!
review/text: I absolutely love these shakes!  Previously, I was mixing my own protein shakes (chocolate whey protein with unsweetened diluted coconut milk, and a banana blended) every morning for breakfast.  Since I found Orgain, I no longer have to clean my hand blender every day and waste five plastic cups a week or carry around a dirty cup until I get home from work.  The taste is amazing (the vanilla is decent, but not nearly as good as the chocolate) and the nutritional content and organic ingredients are exactly what I was looking for.  It's smooth and creamy (not gritty) and, don't worry, you only taste chocolate, not the vegetable extracts, vitamins and minerals (the vanilla tastes significantly more mineral-and-protein-powder-like, that's why I wouldn't recommend it).  I have a degree in nutrition, I am a semi-professional chef, I'm active, and I'm very picky with what I eat, so I'm impressed that I like a product like this so much.  Usually there's something I would want to change (like removing artificial sweeteners, sugar alcohols, etc).<br /><br />I live near Los Angeles and the only place I can find Orgain now is at Ralph's for $2.99/ea + tax and they do not offer any sort of discount for bulk purchases.  They used to carry it at Whole Foods for a month or two and would offer 10% off if you bought 10 or more, but they have recently stopped carrying it.  If you like this product as much as I do, the cheapest way to get it is to subscribe to have it regularly delivered through Amazon, giving you an additional 15% savings from the already low price and you will also receive free shipping!

review/summary: Not As Good As Chocolate, but Still An Excellent Choice!
review/text: I've been searching since the days that Kashi stopped producing their meal replacement shake mix for something that tastes just as good and is just as good for you. I've tried both available flavors of Orgain, and the Vanilla flavor I find to have some whey protein taste...I don't enjoy tasting whey protein but still find the drink palatable.  The shake tastes great at room temp and amazing chilled. I appreciate that there's some remnants of veggies and fruit in the shake too.<br /><br />Potential downsides:<br />It's not all oil, sugar, and protein....although its mostly that... So it's not exactly as good as sitting down and eating a sandwich. The shake is only made in pre-measured little boxes so there's no opportunity to save some money with a tub of a dry mix. The shakes are expensive too. The trade off is better ingredients, instead of unpronounceable and artificial junk found in say, Slimfast (although that too is mostly oil, sugar, and protein...just from worse ingredient sources). The shake is also not vegan if that's something you're looking for. There's currently only 2 flavors of the shake too, so if variety's your thing, this isn't a good shake to try out long term. I wish this had more veggies and fruit in it though...vs. 50 mg each of a fruit and veggie blend.

review/summary: Best meal replacement I have ever had
review/text: Over the years I have tried many meal replacements.  Becasue of my need to have no preservatives and no junk I can not pronounce in my drinks it got pretty inconvenient and messy so I went to bars.  With Orgain I get everything I want and more.  Most of all it sustains me for about 4 hours.  The taste is fantastic both chocolate and vanilla.  I feel healthy when I drink it.  I have been on weight watchers for 6 weeks now and with the help of Orgain I have lost 13 pounds and am nearing the 190's which I have not been in over 6 months.  If you are wondering the point value it is 5 which seems a bit high for a small drink but most meals at this point value will sustain you for this long and if you have no time to cook, prepare and need the best alternative on the market grab an Orgain!!!! you won't be sorry

review/text: Definitely the shake/smoothie you should be drinking!!!<br /><br />It has all the nutrient base covered, it's taste great, easy to carry, I got this once and now i'm Hooked.  It's basically a meal replacement drink that contains all your important nutrients and protein.<br /><br />If you want to lose weight and feed your body with good stuff, this is your DRINK!<br /><br />It's that simple.<br /><br />So my little advice to the founder: Dr. Abraham, if you are reading this, you have done a good job in producing the first pure organic nutrient rich meal replacement drink, please don't be tempted as most other product manufactures have done or are currently doing by putting profit before people health. I'm sure you get what i'm saying.<br /><br />I hope you are successful and orgain makes it BIG<br /><br />So fellow consumers this is a 5 star!!! You won't be disappointed. I hope.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I don't work or anyway associated with Orgain. I'm a regular consumer like you who LOVES this product. it's that simple. I'm surely not paid to write this review. I just want to spread the good work of Orgain.<br /><br />That's it!

review/text: I'm a huge fan of ready to go drinks and smoothies, and when I saw these in my local health food store, I almost became giddy.  After tasting it, I DID become giddy!  This stuff not only tastes AMAZING, but it's also the healthiest ready to go drink on the market.  Digests well, tastes amazing, very nutritious.<br /><br />My ONLY problem with this formulation is the use of Cane Sugar as the sweetener.  This formulation, if it's supposed to be truly healthy, should replace the cane sugar with brown rice syrup, or some other sweetener with nutritive properties.  Cane sugar is damaging to the body, even when "organic".

review/text: What are these people writing reviews thinking?  I bought the Creamy Chocolate Fudge based on the great reviews it got. It tastes terrible!  It has some type of aftertaste that I can't even describe. Gasoline?  At $3 each, it's tough to pour them down the sink.  And it's probably against some evironmental law to pour it down the gutter in the street.  Maybe I'll try the gas tank of my car......
