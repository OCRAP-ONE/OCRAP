review/text: If you are looking for foie gras, stay away from this product. One could safely assume that its only purpose is to convince the world that foie should be banned: it's the subject of so much controversy and it tastes like that????<br />Of course, anyone who has tried the real thing knows that this canned, pureed food for human consumption resembles spiced, spreadable ham much more that it reminds you of foie gras. If that is your perversion: go for it. You might have spent your youth in an institution that served something similar: go for it!<br />If you want foie gras, stay as far away from this as you can!

review/text: What a great excuse to bolster your anti-oxidant intake!  I was given a block of Brix last year with a bottle of Shiraz, wow what a pairing!  Believe it or not, the wine somehow tastes better with this chocolate.  The product itself isn't too sweet or creamy but at the same time it isn't bitter.  We've tried the extra-dark version of Brix and it went well with the deeper red wines, like a big cab.  Great price, thanks Amazon!

I put the bar on a cutting board (at first with a knife then changed to an ice pick which worked perfectly)  and near the wines.  Every single person there had to try at least one piece of it.  It was such a unique party fun food. As soon as the first guest spotted it, no one left it alone until it was gone.  My guests agreed that BRIX was so much fun especially with a good glass of wine.

review/summary: Wonderful Chocolate for those with food allergies or sensitivities
review/text: The Rapunzel Organic Dark Chocolate with Almonds Bars are my absolute favorite chocolate.  While not as high in antioxidants as a 70%+ dark chocolate, 55% cocoa is still much richer than a milk chocolate.  Rather than being creamy, the bars have a firm texture.  Being 55% cocoa, they have a strong chocolate taste without being bitter.<br /><br />Just looking at them, the bars seem to be about 1/4 to 1/3 almonds by volume and about 3/4 to 2/3 chocolate by volume.  The almonds are a tad larger than the almond slivers (not the thin slices) that you would buy in the store.  This is much better than having GIANT whole almonds sticking out of the chocolate like some brands.  You are guaranteed to taste almonds in every bite.<br /><br />The absolute best part about these bars is that they do not contain soy, dairy or wheat as ingredients. It is fairly easy to find chocolate without wheat, pretty hard to find chocolate without dairy, and almost impossible to find chocolate without Soy Lechithin in it. To find chocolate with none of those three is extraordinarily rare. And it tastes great!! So the Rapunzel Chocolate practically qualifies as a miracle.<br /><br />I also recommend the Rapunzel 70% Dark Chocolate for a change of flavor.

review/summary: Perhaps the World's Best Chocolate
review/text: All Rapunzel Dark Chocolates are sweetened with their "Rapadura" Whole Unrefined Cane Sugar, unlike virtually all organic chocolate brands which use refined "Raw Sugar"  This full flavored and carmel-like sugar is the reduced whole syrup of the cane juice with its full content of mineral-rich molasses. Whole sugar imparts a deeper flavor to the chocolate that may take a little getting used to, but when done its superiority becomes absolutely apparent.  All refined sugars require the body to deplete its store of minerals to digest, thus making them essentially demineralizing to the bones and teeth.  Refined sugars also far more readily feed pathogens such as candida.  This chocolate is truly an outstanding and healthful food which maximinizes chocoloate's tonic and health builing properties, once you try it other brands will seem cheap and inadequate.  Super Yum!

review/summary: Tasty, but I get burned out on them quickly
review/text: I signed up for the Atkins program on the actual site a few weeks ago. They sent me a box containing 3 Atkins food products; one of which was this chocolate peanut butter bar. I received the box about 4-5 days into phase one and was craving something sweet, so I tried this (the pack said it could be eaten in all phases, so I "went to town," so to speak). Anyway, I thought it was pretty freakin' tasty -- especially after having nothing of a sweet variety for a week or so. With that in mind, I went ahead and ordered 12 of them here on Amazon (along with a whole slew of other Atkins food products I was interested in trying for phase 2).<br /><br />At this point, I still like them, but I get burned out on them really fast. About halfway through one bar, I'm done with it. It's got a certain flavor profile that just kind of exhausts my taste buds relatively fast. Having said that, I would certainly recommend people give these a try to see what they, personally, think about them. I plan to have one of these every week or so and figure that should keep me from getting COMPLETELY burned out on them.<br /><br />They're good, but I can only enjoy them in small doses.<br /><br />-Stephen

review/summary: The REAL "Wonder Bread"
review/text: This is by far the best bread product for celiacs if you can have cheese.<br />Any kind of cheese makes this mix tasty.  As someone who doesn't like to cook, I am thrilled with the ten minute prep time and 25 minute baking time.  My house smells fabulous, I get fresh bread, and hello sandwiches!!!  Something I love and hadn't had in over two years as I have MANY other food allergies, including yeast and rice, so all other celiac bread options I found were not suitable for me.<br />As for the directions, I find it easier to add the baking soda to the mix and THEN mix all wet ingredients together BEFORE adding to the mix.  Incorporate wet ingredients and then knead.  Then add the cheese and continue to knead.  I bake rolls at 375 for 25 minutes and they are moist and a bit chewy.  I find 35 minutes is too long.<br />There is no sales tax on Amazon and this is a MUCH better price than in my local supermarkets or health food stores.  I will only order Chebe from Amazon if the price stays this reasonable.

review/text: After trying many different types of gluten free breads and mixes, I love Chebe! It's very easy to prepare, is versatile and tastes unique but great. If you're wanting something light and fluffy, Chebe is probably not it, but if you are missing the days of chewy great bread, Chebe fits the bill. The fact that it's nice and chewy, and not dry and crumbly is a great appeal.

review/summary: Add your own cheese
review/text: O, for a while, Amazon was selling Yoki p�o de queijo mix.  Those were the days.  You had to buy them 24 at a time, but we went through them surprisingly quickly.  Life was good.  Then Amazon dropped the product.  We were sad.  Eventually, they picked up this one instead, and we decided to try it.  I much prefer Yoki brand, I find both the flavor and the texture of the end product to be superior and more similar to what you'll find in a padaria in Brazil.  But, opinions and preferences may differ on that.<br /><br />But, here's what's really surprising about this product as compared with other p�o de queijo mixes we've used: you have to add your own cheese to this one!  This makes for more work, increases the overall cost, and as noted above, does not (imho) result in a better product.  We wondered if it's really any different than making it from scratch then (out of manioc flour), but it is... substantially less work than making it from scratch.  But, you might think of it as a middle ground between making-from-scratch and super-easy-mix.<br /><br />So, in short, it's ok, but we'll be looking for Yoki brand wherever we think it might be hiding... and maybe refining our from-scratch techniques...

review/text: Oh my! I love this stuff! I am not a good cook and I don't like to experiment with making Gluten Free foods because I waste a lot of time/money on things I end up hating anyways. This is a GOOD buy. When my sister was diagnosed with Celiac, she tried this mix and had me try one of the cheesey bread balls. I was immediately hooked. It was soft, you can refigerate and reheat the leftovers and there are lots of different things you can use this for. Goes great with soups, a variety of suppers and as a treat. At the moment Amazon is fixing the listing or something so they are not selling them at a good price, but when they have them back up, I will definately be ordering more! The pizza crust mix is great too. I was a big fan of self-rising pizzas and that is what the mix is like! soft wonderful pizza crust. I can't reccomend these enough to people! Even ones who don't HAVE to eat GF like me.

review/summary: Chebe great for gluten sensitivity due to MS
review/text: I was recently diagnosed with MS and have been playing with diet and supplements to see what helps to manage symptoms (fatigue, spasms, peripheral neuropathy).  We realized quickly that gluten was a major trigger.  I happened across chebe and am hooked!  Actually my entire family is.  Chebe made with sharp cheese into dinner rolls is a favorite with everyone (make them with a good hard parm to go along with spaghetti - use quinoa pasta!).  Save money and use this mix for pizza crust too.  Add into the mix some oregano, basil and parsley and skip the cheese.  Roll out on a large baking stone, bake for 15 mins, then add your favorite toppings and bake for another 10 minutes or so.  I have the monthly subscription now that the whole family is eating my GF rolls and even pizza!  Only warning, don't make up extra rolls for reheating, they won't reheat well...  pizza is decent reheated, but the rolls get kinda chewy when reheated.<br /><br />If you have any gluten issues, you should definitely keep these in your pantry!!

I just add a little palm oil (solid at room temperature) and water and I omit the cheese. I kneed the dough until it is well mixed and pliable. If it is sticky just add a little extra dough. I can then roll it out with a rolling pin (very thin!). My kids like the homemade mini pies I make with it using a mini tart making machine. Takes about 15 minutes from box to mouth and is really fun to do.

I am a huge bread lover and have been struggling with having to avoid some of my most favorite foods.  I made this mix yesterday and was very pleased with the results.  The rolls were very flavorful and had a wonderful texture.  I wouldn't say that they were exactly like my favorite cheesy rolls from a popular restuarant, but they were a great substitue.  Other bread products I have tried have been extremely dry and tough to chew.  These rolls were not at all like that.  I also like that this mix calls for you to add your own shredded cheese.  I am also a cheese lover and had a great cheddar I shredded up and added to the mix.  I am glad this mix came in an 8 pack as I am looking forward to trying to make breadsticks with this mix next time!

review/summary: Makes GREAT pizza!
review/text: Though my super picky gluten eating husband would rather pass on it, I am so excited to have a replacement for rolls, bread sticks, and especially pizza crust.  You can't expect the rolls to taste like regular gluten rolls, as they are chewy, but I love them.  I make the pizza crust with pesto, tomato chunks, and 4 cheese just like Uno's regular flatbread 4-cheese pizza, and it is just as good as the real thing in my opinion, and better than their gluten free pizza.  It holds together wonderfully!  You can even roll it out without it sticking or falling apart.  I will be signing up for the automated shipping, it's THAT good.

review/summary: CHEBE mixes are great!
review/text: We found these little mixes when we needed something for my daughter's gluten free diet.  These were easy to fix and didn't taste like cardboard.  There are more gluten free foods and mixes available in our area now, many very good, but our local store that carried  Chebe mixes folded.  We were so pleased to find we could order through Amazon and enjoy them again.  Prepare one package for a smaller amount, or you can use two for a large family like ours!  GREAT!

review/text: Tried this mix because of the reviews and the price was more reasonable than the other breads in the store. I used half grated Parmesan and half Romano for the cheese and had to add a bit more water. They baked up nice and golden brown. The texture had a crispy outside with a doughy somewhat chewy inside. Cooled, the next day they tasted even more like actual gluten bread. We ate these with Bear Creek Cheddar Broccoli Soup. Perfect combination. Next time I will try to use mozzarella and see how the taste differs.

review/text: I have been using Chebe mixes for years and love the texture, flavor and convenience of the product.  The Original Bread Mix makes delicious cheese rolls which travel well.  Most of the gluten free breads don't taste good unless you heat or toast them which is totally inconvenient if you are running out the door on an errand and need to bring something with you.  I make a batch every week to keep in the freezer for those times I will be out for lunch and want a roll to go with my salad.

review/summary: very good but not a loaf of bread
review/text: The photo on the package shows balls of a cheesy bread but the words "Chebe Original Bread Mix" might make you think that it makes a regular loaf of bread.  It doesn't.  Instead, it makes a very tasty bread bun or balls that have a chewy, substantial texture often missing in gluten free baked goods.  We liked it with soups and chili -- it's good for dipping too.<br /><br />The package calls for adding 4 tablespoons of water after mixing the package contents with oil, parmesan cheese and eggs.  That wasn't nearly enough water.  It took about 3 times that amount before the dough formed into a ball.  Also, I elected to make 4 buns rather than the balls.  Be sure to add the optional 1 teaspoon baking powder when making buns.  They puffed up nicely in the oven that way.  Because the tops were quite dry when they came out of the oven, I immediately brushed them with butter and covered them with foil, and this made them soften.<br /><br />We liked this mix, which a friend gave to us.  We plan to buy more.

review/text: I bought this Chebe item to try since the reviews were mostly good.  My daughter & I have gluten & dairy allergies, so I opted NOT to use cheese in this original mix, but to make it into rolls according the the directions on the cheese rolls box.  These were easy to make & texture was good--little crispy outside & chewy inside.  Rolls were VERY small (golf ball size or smaller) when made according to instructions.  Problem was the flavor.  It was VERY bland.  The cheese must give these the wonderful taste, because neither my dauther nor I care to even eat them & I will probably end up throwing them out.  Simply no flavor.  Won't be buying these again.  Too bad since they were so quick & easy to make.

review/text: Given the positive reviews posted, I thought I ought to give this sausage a try, particularly given the higher cost of salami I had purchased from other companies (Columbus Salame Company and Fortuna). The Bridgford salami was kind of a disappointment-fibrous and greasy with a somehow duller taste. Kind of like a Slim Jim with less heat and more sawdust (I'm not implying there is really sawdust in it-it just has a different texture that what I'm used to). My wife took a bite out of her slice, then put it aside and didn't nibble on it further... that is actually not a common outcome in encounters between my wife and bits of food. I did bake it with some cheese in some soon to expire canned pizza dough and it was pretty decent-my son really liked it. All in all, I'd say go a little upmarket if you are going to use the salami to snack on with fresh fruit, olives and whatnot but this product is probably fine for cooking.

review/text: Well, what can I say?  I regret this purchase of Bridgeford Italian salami (I didn't buy the hard salami).  The quality of the salami is just so-so, not terrible but not comparable in quality to slightly more-expensive salamis available at my local grocers.  The taste?  Not bad but not great either, a walk on the mild side (in other words, bland and a bit rubbery-tasting).<br /><br />Stick with Hillshire Farm, Genoa, Gallo, etc...Bridgeford makes good pepperoni but their salami is sub-par and not worth the money.

The texture isn't grainy like some of the more gourmet brands I've wasted my hard earned dollar on. Surprisingly it isn't very greasy, no gristle bits, no bitter aftertaste, and it smells good for a salami. Their use of salt and spices are well balanced. You could eat this with a sweet beverage and there is no conflicting flavors. Overall I rate this 5 stars and will be ordering this from Amazon again.

What I found to be exact was 3/4ths of one of the salami, in some sort of pet food dish as if left for a pet or some wildlife.  Well, since it was left outside, I decided that the owner might not care if I went ahead and ate it.  So I did, and it was wonderful!  I am only giving this product four stars since like "Mntijo" here with his review it was a bit greasy, and I also had stomach distress after eating it.  But this product is still delicious!  I do hope the owner of the home that placed this salami outside orders more, I'd love to get more free food of this caliber.

review/text: Tastes like a rancid dishrag pickled in brine.  No sign of spoilage - just bad tasting.  I bought based on the rave reviews of others here so I thought I'd chime in with my opinion.  I'm comparing this with the Fresh and Easy house brand - scarcely the premium - that costs less and is scrumptious.

review/summary: My favorite Starbucks blend!
review/text: I have tried all the Via blends, and my favorite by far is still Starbucks Tribute.  It was so sad when they ran out last year.  My back-up is the Columbian, always good, but I have always loved Sumatra.  The cherry is a note, and does not come across as a 'flavor'.  I do not like flavored coffee.  I heat this in the microwave for two minutes in a mug of 1% organic milk.  Yummy!<br /><br />Starbucks writes:  . . . "Spicy & Cherry" and "With beans from all three of the world's coffee-growing regions . . . Aged Sumatra, sun-dried beans from Ethiopia, and coffees from Papua New Guinea and Colombia come together to create this spicy and full-bodied blend with dark cherry notes."

review/text: I've learned that I can cutopen the top of the packet, pinch it to divide the micro-ground coffee in half, and it makes a nice cup of coffee! Be sure to know how many ounces your cup is, or, you may be making very strong coffee. Try experimenting a bit to s t r e t c h the individual packet servings. :)

review/summary: IF YOU LIKE REALLY ORDINARY COFFEE...
review/text: My husband and I agree that this brew is really ordinary. If you don't like espresso, or strong coffee, this blend if for you! It reminds me of the coffee I used to drink before finding Lavazza, an Italian coffee we've drunk since 2007 when we came home from France with memories of that divine espresso. Now, we've gotten lazy and enjoy the Starbucks VIA italian roast instant coffee--the key to our appreciation being the strong but NOT BITTER flavor.

review/text: Found these in Florida a few months ago while on vacation.  Love at first bite.  I am a huge fan of crunchy snacks but I really have to watch the cholesterol intake.  These are awesome.  They taste so good you are convinced you are eating something decadent.  You can fill a sandwich bag with these crispy little rounds and only be consuming about 120 calories for the serving size.  They work well with dips but are just fine all by themselves.

review/summary: Crispy. Tasty. Thinny
review/text: All the buzz words are on the box - baked, naturals, simply, golden, no preservatives, savory, real,and more.<br />But do these anorexic pretzels with a new twist live up to the hype on the box?  Yes. Yes. Yes.<br /><br />Pepperidge Farm Pretzel Thins are almost akin to potato chips, the snack made from the wonderful potato. These snacks look like pretzel cut outs with the distinctive look of pretzels but with a different taste and dynamic. Not too salty, these pretzel snacks are a sensory delight.<br /><br />A serving size of 11 crisps will fill you with 110 calories, none of those from fat. I don't count my individual pretzels as I snack, but I would guess I exceed the one serving specification by at least a factor of two.<br /><br />Pretzel Thins are baked in the USA.

review/text: I had this wine for the first time almost two years ago at Olive Garden and immediately fell in love with it!  But then I found out that they had it under contract and that it couldnt be purchased outside of the Restaurant.  And even if I purchased it at the restaurant, it had to be opened by them and a bit consumed before I could take it out.  I am so happy now that I can get it at the store!  Im Canadian, and its not sold here, so I cant wait for my next trip to the States to load up.  Nice gently sweet blush wine with just a touch of effervesscence (sp?)  No wonder they cant keep it on the shelves.

That React 5 gum?  Holds up TERRIBLE when left in the car with summer heat even inside the package and out of the sun.  Also, the taste is very short lived.  Save your money and avoid the React 5 gum.<br /><br />I only wish Walmart could carry this flavor but like everything else I seem to like my local Walmart either doesn't carry it or is always sold out.

review/summary: Nice Ice Wine!!
review/text: First off, this kit produces 30-375ml bottles of wine, not the advertised 30-750ml bottles of wine.. Also, this is not a 13.5lb box, it's a 13.5kg box which equals 30lb. It does not require the addition of any water. The main juice bag is 9L, and the F-Pack (sweetening pack) is 3L.. That being said, you will need a 3 gal carboy in order to make this wine, along with all the other necessary equipment. The finished product is very good! Like any ice wine, this is very sweet, and meant to be sipped along with a dessert. It fermented from 1.114 to 0.990 in just over 3 weeks, and after adding the sweetening pack, it was 1.060, so it's like drinking candy! I've tasted a few different ice wines from the finger lakes, and this is right on par with them. This is the first Ice Wine I have made, so I can't compare it to any of the other kits available from other manufacturers.. The color of this wine looks like a whiskey. With free shipping this is a bargin price for an Ice Wine.. Normally in the store, these go for roughly $15.00-$25.00/375ml bottle, and these cost $2.00/375ml bottle!!<br /><br />I will be ordering this again!

review/summary: Diamante Ice Wine Review
review/text: I just did a taste test on this wine and it was great. It will be bottled this weekend. 30 bottles of 375ml. It is in a 3 gallon carboy. I will filter the wine, add a cheap bottle of brandy and then bottle it. I can tell it will be great, now and aged. This is a great buy. I just ordered the port. I'll comment on that later. I have made kits before from Wine Experts and RJ Spagnols, both were $149.95 each. This kit did not come with labels or heat shrink caps. No tax, free shipping and subscription ordering brings the price to $52.00 I think. You can't beat this.<br /><br />UPDATE 5/27/12: I bottled this and had some Canadian friends (home of the ice wine) taste it and my pal said it was equall to a $100 bottle in Canada. Him and his wife both loved it. I added a cup of Vodka instead of brandy before bottling. Hope this helps. This will be another I add to my collection every 6 months.

In any event, it was a big mess and everything needed to be thrown away and I was short a Christmas gift right before Christmas.  I won't buy anything like this again on Amazon... too risky I guess.

review/text: I've baked with other Bob's Red Mill products before and I finally got a case of the Active Dry Yeast. A great deal when you consider the price of those pouches or even the small jars in the grocery store. The yeast is consistently well behaved and the bags are a convenient size. Bulk without having to feel like you need to rush through before the yeast looses its efficacy.<br /><br />The only thing that bothers me is the labeling. I think Bob's Red Mill ought to consider fixing the front label where it says "Must Be Refrigerated". There's no need to refrigerate until AFTER a bag has been opened. A couple extra words explanation would keep from scaring off some would-be buyers not experienced with yeast.

review/summary: BEWARE OF BOB'S RED MILL YEAST
review/text: I purchased this Yeast because the description stated that the only ingredient was YEAST.  However, when I received it I found that SORBITAN MONOSTEARATE has been added to the yeast.  I am allergic to sorbital and sorbitan is a derivative of sorbital.  If you google Sorbitan Monostearate you will find many discussions about the allergic properties of sorbital/sorbitan.<br /><br />I called Bob's Red Mill who did not care and put all the blame on amazon.com<br /><br />So for those of you with allergies or want plain yeast buy Red Star active yeast in the red, white, & blue packages and you will find only yeast. Do not buy the Red Star in jars, or the one for bread making as they also contain sorbitan.  I emailed the Red Star company for this information.<br /><br />It certainly is becoming a challenge to find products that don't have additives.

review/text: This 8-pack has lasted me more than a year and I will probably restock it when I run out.  It took a while before I learned that the water must be nearly but not exceed 115 degrees Fahrenheit to get the yeast to bloom.  Now that I own a stand mixer, I have finally made bread successfully at home.  It is very convenient to have had this 8 pack.<br /><br />Last year, this 8 pack cost a dollar less than this year i.e. $21.
