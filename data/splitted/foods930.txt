review/summary: I hate mayo--if it isn't Dukes
review/text: I don't like mayonnaise--or I thought I didn't. Other than a mere dab on a hardboiled egg, I have no use for the white, fluffy, oily stuff. I couldn't even bring myself to use it as a hair-repair pack on the recommendation of my hair stylist (you put it on like conditioner, wait an hour and wash it off. Avoid picnics, boiled potatoes, eggs and tomato sandwiches in the meantime.)<br /><br />But it turns out I actually really like mayonnaise as long as it's Dukes. This mayo is made from (they say) the same recipe as Mrs. Eugenia Duke created in 1917. This mayo has eggs, oil and vinegar but...no sugar. If you look at classical mayonnaise recipes, there is never sugar. Sugar is not a great addition to mayonnaise. Curry powder, paprika, mustard, tarragon are good additions. Sugar is not. When I took a test spoon of this mayo, having run out of my squeeze bottle of a national brand, I was amazed. First, this is what mayo tasted like when I was a kid, and second, this was actually so good I could eat it alone, which is damn dangerous as I don't need to be scooping mayo up with a teaspoon as an addition to my diet.<br /><br />The taste is tangy and somewhat perhaps more sour than you are used to. It works well on tomato sandwiches, deviled eggs, potato salad and anything requiring mayonnaise. I happen to like it as a small dab on a hardboiled egg, then sprinkled with curry for a quick breakfast.<br /><br />The squeeze bottle is nice until you get to the end, then it's a bit hard to get all of it to squirt out, so a knife is needed to get the rest. If this bothers you, use the plastic jars. But watch out for dipping in those dangerous spoons for a taste. This is a recipe for diet disaster.

review/summary: Great for Sugar free diets
review/text: I searched my whole city for a sugar free mayo because I didn't want to take the time to make my own.  I'm a type 2 diabetic trying my hardest to avoid sugar and every mayo in the store has sugar in it, as do 98% of all foods even meat! (one wonders why????) and then thinks no wonder our nation has an epidemic of obesity and diabetes. I was told that Duke's mayo was sugar free so I looked for it every where.  I finally found it at my World Market. I didn't care what it cost I wanted it. I must say it's delicious! I had heard about Duke's and I wondered how it could be so different. Let me tell you it is. As one other reviewer said, it's like the mayo we used to have years ago. But, everything tasted better in the 50's and 60's before hormones and antibiotics and genetic engineering of foods but I digress. I just wish I could get it locally in bigger jars. I use it for so many things as I make my own salad dressings, dips, appetizers, deviled eggs and an ingredient in baked goods. It's so versatile. If you want a good mayo with taste and flavor that's sugar free buy Duke's. You'll wonder why you ever bought another brand.

review/text: Shipping for this item came to over $24.  There was no way for me to check shipping cost before ordering, so if I had to do it again, I'd throw the money in my gas tank, drive a couple of states over, and buy it myself instead... especially when the delivery estimate for that outrageous shipping price is 1-3 weeks.<br /><br />Duke's is my all time favorite mayo, but not at 30 cents per ounce.

review/text: Ordered from Martha and have been very pleased with the bush. It came bare root in March just as it was beginning to bud out. Didn't do so hot here in Maryland in March. The buds died. However, the bush began growing again in April and flowered this year. Two of the flowers have since turned into pomegranates about the size of apricots. I don't know if they'll ripen or not by October (when it starts getting cold) but I was amazed it set fruit so soon. I've heard from professionals that pomegranates do not fair well in humidity (we have a ton). This bush seems to be an exception! We'll see.

review/summary: Floored by the incredible price; love the freshness
review/text: Seeing as how I use this as a ground beef stretcher (you can't tell the difference, really!) the price is a pleasant surprise.  The product itself is top-notch.  I've tried many different brands and Bob's Red Mill has the best texture and flavor by far.<br /><br />Here's how I use the product.  I put 1/2 cup of bulgur in a glass measuring cup and pour hot water on it to make it to the 1 1/4 cup mark.  I let it sit for about 10-15 minutes, then use it as a supplement to loose ground beef recipes such as taco filling or spaghetti.  Voila!  Not only are you eating healthier, you're saving money too.  As you cook, the bulgur will blend with the other ingredients and soak up additional sauce and flavors.<br /><br />By the way, I have tried using bulgur without meat as a meat substitute, and I found it just fine as a taco filler.  Bulgur really doesn't have much of a flavor though, so it should be used with strong accompanying ingredients.  In any case, you'll find that it is a great addition to your kitchen: easy to prepare and healthy to eat.

review/summary: Vegan foods
review/text: Trying to become a vegetarian and eventually a full vegan. Heart disease runs in the family and not interested in taking the statin drugs. One of the challenges is replacing one of my favorites - hamburgers and French fries. Making baked French fries that tasted like fried with the right spices was easy. Making vegie burgers that taste good has been a challenge. Bought several Amazon books on vegie burgers and this was an ingredient in many. This was another Bob's Red Mill product sourced via Amazon Prime, and as usual Bob's Red Mill stuff is of the highest quality.

review/summary: Deceptive!! Not what you think they are...
review/text: I purchased these because they came up in the "organic" search on Amazon.  When I received them and read the ingredients, they use regular apples and organic cinnamon! Their product is crispy initially (I don't eat a bag at a time so they are stored in a zip-lock bag) but looses the crispiness within two days. NOW, the really bad part!! If an apple is not organic, it's been exposed to pesticides and other chemicals right?  The Funky Monkey Apple Crisps are made with the skin of the apple, frequently, with pieces that are skin only. GUESS WHERE ARE THE PESTICIDES ARE??? I am VERY disappointed in this product, there are certainly healthier options on the market. Organic buyer beware of what you feed your family!

review/summary: Good Little Sweet Snack
review/text: I was fooled by the pacakaging.  The box cover looks like they are fairly big pieces of cake with pineapple filling.  They're not.  They're cookies about 1.5 inches in length and 1/4 of an inch thick.<br /><br />The cookie is very tasty, a little crumbly though.  It taste kind of like cheesecake with a chewy strip (and I mean strip) of  filling (something else the package deceived me on).  They are actually reminiscent of those cookies with the bit of fruit in the center like Knotts Berry Farm's shortbread cookies.  The difference is the cookie is more buttery and instead of being in the middle of a flat cookie, it's a filling.  While you can taste the butter, in no way does it taste like pineapple.  I double checked with someonelse and they didn't get a hint of pineapple either.  The filling is secondary really especially since there's so little of it.<br /><br />They definitely weren't what I was expecting, but they're very good.  Since they're individually wrapped, they're easily transportable.<br /><br />edit 1 wk later: The filling isn't a strip in each cookie nor are all of them crumbly.  Either the manufacturing is inconsistent or my box had then end of one batch and the beginning of another.

review/text: If you are like me and cannot abide by powdered or jar gravy, then this is what you must have!!!  THIS IS REAL GENUINE TURKEY STOCK!! I have used this product for a few years.  I usually add it and some water or broth (this is concentrated and like a gel) to the drippings I already have just to make the gravy I already have go much further, I can double or triple - I mean, everyone loves gravy and leftovers, too!  I have added small amounts when I am making turkey or chicken soups and it would probably work well in stuffing for the extra turkey flavor.  I also have the beef and ham since my family loves, loves, loves gravies.

review/text: I like this product. I use it when making Thanksgiving Gravy. What I typically do is add a couple tablespoons to store bought chicken stock while it's on the stove. I let it simmer along with my turkey neck, gizzards, onion celery and carrots. It helps to give the stock more of a turkey flavor as opposed to the chicken. The only drawback is that it is very salty!

review/text: Shampoos are tricky for my hair.  It's a bit more coarse, and has a bit of a curl to it, but after using this shampoo for a short time I've found that my hair has more shine and is easier to style than with my previous shampoo which I paid more for.<br /><br />I do color my hair, but I can't really comment on how well it protects against fading since my color was a bit faded prior to using this shampoo, but if the product lives up to this claim like it does the others than I am sure it will do an admiral job.<br /><br />For the price I LOVE this shampoo.  I love the way it smells (not to fruity or flowery, just a nice scent) I love that my scalp is less irritated, and I like my hair more while using it (something that is hard to do).  My only wish was that it was sulfate free, but at this price I think I will be switching to this shampoo from now on!

It doesn't weigh my hair down or increase the number of tangles. It has a pleasant faint apple scent and you don't need to use very much to get a nice lather.

Combined with the Damage & Color Repair conditioner, this left my hair feeling soft and healthy.  I really recommend this shampoo for anyone with color treated hair.

review/summary: cheap smell, itchy scalp, animal-tested
review/text: I tried this shampoo (paired with the strength conditioner) for about a week and I had to get rid of it.  Here is why:<br />1. It is meant to make your scalp healthy, yet it gave me an itchy, flaky scalp.<br />2. The smell is so fake perfumy.  It smells like really cheap shampoo.<br />3. I thought perhaps it would be a more environmentally/animal-friendly version of their company (Unilever) kindof like how L'Oreal has the line Everpure, and sadly, it isn't.  According to the website (clearhair.com) It uses stearic acid (from cows) and it doesn't have a no-animal testing policy.  It is hard to call the product "Clear" when it has so many icky ingredients.<br /><br />Big thumbs down.

review/summary: Good, Standard Shampoo
review/text: This is a good shampoo with a pleasant, apple-y scent. I don't think a shampoo that claims to be for "color repair" should contain sodium laureth sulfate -- I'd rather have less lather and have my color last longer. That said, the lather is generous, and the shampoo left my hair feeling clean and not stripped of moisture.<br /><br />I ordered three shampoo/conditioner products from Amazon, and all three leaked during shipping. They were wrapped in plastic, so it wasn't a huge mess, but it would be nice if Amazon could find a way to ship shampoo without it leaking.<br /><br />I don't think this shampoo is anything special, and probably not worth paying extra for.

review/text: I cannot review how well this shampoo works on the hair as it arrived in the mail with all of the shampoo leaked into the mailing envelope. I will say that if you are sensitive to products with strong fragrances like I am, this is not a good choice. It is heavily scented. I also don't recommend ordering this product through the mail as the pop top popped open and there was not packaging or shrink wrap to secure it shut.

review/summary: Another Itchy Rash
review/text: I love the scent of this product. That's the good news. The only good news.<br /><br />But in my old age, I have developed a horrible itchy reaction to certain hair products, namely WEN, which gave me an awful rash on my hairline (front and back) as well as my entire neck. So when I saw this product, I thought it would be a relief now that my itchy WEN rash is finally (after SIX months of healing) a thing of the past.<br /><br />Sad to say that I was wrong. I used Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty conditioner and shampoo  three times in a row and guess what happened?  Yup. Same sort of irritation and itching in all of the same places.<br /><br />There must be a very specific ingredient the makers of hair products are including in their respective cleansers and conditioners because the fact that this has happened AGAIN literally has me scratching my head in disbelief.<br /><br />Again, this shampoo (and its companion conditioner) has a lovely scent - but I will not spend my waking and sleeping hours scratching myself like a cat with fleas.  If you have any sensitivity to hair products, avoid this one.<br /><br />Boo. So goes this product the way of WEN. In the trash.

review/summary: Meh
review/text: After finally caving into the commercials and all the rave reviews I finally caved in and bought this shampoo and conditioner, the one labeled Damage and Color Repair, it's been a month now and I just finished the bottles and I'm not at all impressed, in fact I'm disappointed and almost angry. I have fine dry hair that I color once a month, now this shampoo, wow, it strips the color right out of my hair because of all the sulfates in it. I've NEVER seen a shampoo do this to my hair before. Because of this my color faded terribly and I had to recolor my hair. The shampoo also dried my already dry hair out even MORE and caused more shedding.<br />Problem two, the conditioner, I felt like I couldn't rinse it out, I didn't use a lot, maybe a tiny little dime sized and still when I dried my hair it felt like there was still a weird sticky film in my hair that weighed my hair down, leaving my hair with no life, no shine, nothing.<br />2 stars for it being pleasant smelling and having a good bottle design.

review/summary: My beautician asked me why my hair was shedding so much! I ended up with a bald spot!
review/text: My review below is very detailed, but if you are having issues with your hair because of this shampoo your FIRST step is to get it out of your hair.  Wash your hair with a moisturizing shampoo, follow with a moisturizing conditioner, and then use Apple Cider Vinegar or another vinegar to strip this shampoo and reminents out of your hair.  THEN do a hot oil treatment.  After the hot oil treatment wash and condition again and your hair should stop shedding.<br />=============================<br /><br />My review:<br /><br />I don't know if this shampoo is damaging my hair, but I noticed that I can just touch my hair after using this shampoo and it sheds. My hair sheds a lot anyway so I definitely would not use a shampoo that causes it to shed even more. The shampoo smells good and is creamy.<br /><br />From reading the other reviews, apparently YOU HAVE TO USE the conditioner or you will mess up your hair.  I would NEVER use a shampoo that strips the hair just so you can use a special conditioner to re-soften it.<br /><br />UPdate: I am downgrading to a ONE (1*).  I have NEVER had a bald spot in my life.  It has been 3 weeks now and my hair feels like straw (in spite of several deep conditionings at home and the salon).  Today, I look in the mirror and I now have a bald spot (IN THE FRONT OF MY HEAD) from all the breakage and shedding.  It is CLEAR this shampoo has a protein in it which is a NO-NO for damaged hair UNLESS you use a certain type of conditioner to bring back the softness.<br /><br />Once I discovered the bald spot, I began to panic and I went and bought the CLEAR conditioner trying to get the dryness to leave and it still didn't leave.  I am sitting here now with my regular conditioner trying to get the softness back.  I am afraid it will not come back and I will have to wait for my hair to grow out.  This shampoo is HORRIBLE.<br /><br />Update #2: This is all I had to do to stop my hair from falling out.  I had to do a clarifier.  First, I used a mixture of baking soda and water.  This soften the hair immediately, but the shedding didn't stop so I slept in a plastic cap with an oil [I used mustard oil, but any oil likely will do]).  I woke up this morning and the hair was definitely in better condition.  I then went to my refrigerator and used Apple Cidar Vinegar, more oil, and my Creme of Nature Shampoo and Conditioner.  The hair is FINALLY back to its original condition (except for the bald spot).

review/summary: Very good shampoo if you can handle the strong synthetic fragrance
review/text: Fragrance: EXTREMELY strong, synthetic smelling fragrance.  I used the product once to give a fair review and the scent made me ill.  If you aren't sensitive to strong and/or synthetic scents it's probably going to just smell like shampoo to you.<br /><br />Cleaning:  Cleaned hair very well, lathered richly, rinsed easily.<br /><br />Conditioning:  I normally use a conditioner but did not need to after using this shampoo.  Huge bonus points for that.<br /><br />Safe for color treated hair:  The product contains sodium laureth sulfate which is considered to be easier on colored hair than many of the other sulfates.  In an ideal world there would be an affordable, sulfate-free, effective shampoo--but we don't live in that world--yet.<br /><br />Overall:  This is a good product but I will continue my search for a color safe shampoo that has no sulfates and actually cleans your hair and leaves it in a somewhat manageable condition.

review/text: I have dyed my hair for years and am always trying different shampoos. My hair is straight and on the fine side and I wash it every day. I liked this shampoo. It lathers well (even in our hard water) and left my hair feeling nice. I didn't need any conditioner and it didn't dry out my hair or weigh it down.<br /><br />I think it has a strong scent - not totally unpleasant, but if you're sensitive to scents, it may bother you.<br /><br />I do wish Amazon didn't ship this in a padded envelope. Somehow the shampoo bottle opened and while the bottle was wrapped in plastic, I lost about 1/3 of the shampoo. Shipping this in a box would have prevented this problem.

review/summary: I had an allergic reaction to this shampoo
review/text: I purchased this shampoo about 2 weeks ago, and used it for the first time last weekend.  After using it in the shower, I noticed that my forehead and temples were blotchy red, clearly an allergic reaction.  I put cortisone on the blotches and took two benadryl tablets and the blotches subsided after a few hours.  In order to determine whether or not it was indeed this shampoo that caused the reaction (and not some other product or a random food allergy), I used the shampoo in the shower again this morning.  While I was rinsing it, my face and neck began to itch, and when I got out of the shower and looked in the mirror, the blotchiness had returned.<br /><br />I don't usually have particularly sensitive skin, but do have various allergies in my immediate family - two brothers are allergic to latex, one of my sons is peanut-allergic, and another son is allergic to cats and dogs.  I checked the label of the product, and noticed that it contained almond oil and soy, which is not a problem for me, but might be a problem for someone allergic to those foods (yes, I know you don't EAT the shampoo, but sometimes people with food allergies react to it when it comes into contact with their skin).<br /><br />I called the 800 number on the bottle to report the allergic reaction, and they were very nice about it - a representative took my info, and another person called me back a few hours later.  They asked me to return the unused product and they are going to send me a refund and coupons for alternate products.<br /><br />I am giving this product 3 stars based on the fact that my hair looked clean after use, and the customer service people were pleasant.  Obviously I'm not going to purchase it again though.

review/summary: Excellent Shampoo, love it!
review/text: First of all, this review is for the shampoo only (the colored/damaged hair version). I purchased this because I read an article in a magazine that said that normal shampoos/shampooing doesn't clear the hair follicles of dead skin cells and sebum, clogging them and making it more challenging for hair to grown long and strong. I have long, naturally curly blonde hair that I color dark brown and straighten daily. It is about 6 inches past my clavicle, and I have been trying to grow it past my breasts, ala Kim Kardashian, for what seems like years. I had beautiful long hair as a teen, but since being in my adult years, just can't seem to get past this length where it ends right around my underarms.<br />I have been using this shampoo for a little over a week (probably around 10 days) and can honestly say I am VERY impressed. I am someone who has always believed that shampoo doesn't really matter in comparison to a good, rich conditioner. Well, I was wrong. I massage this shampoo into my roots in a circular motion with my fingertips, being sure to reach all of my scalps, and taking around 2-3 minutes to do my whole head before rinsing. I am using my usual conditioner (Tresseme Soft and Silky), which I always use. My hair feels incredibly soft and shiny, and actually appears to be stronger as I don't have as many stray hairs all over my bathroom after styling. My root area has more volume than usual and my hair just feels cleaner overall than normal.<br />The next test is to see if it starts to accelerate in growth, which will probably not be visible for a little while. Meanwhile, I am going to switch to the Clear conditioner too once my Treseme is gone. This will be the first shampoo that I ever re-purchase out of loyalty. As for the scent, it is fine...not too floral or strong. It really just has that typical "clean shampoo" smell. My boyfriend likes it, which is great because he only seems to like very clean scents. However, if you are particularly sensitive to heavy scents, you may want to steer clear of this as it is definitely perfumed.<br />Another nice thing I noted is that Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is listed fairly towards the end of the ingredient list, unlike most shampoos that list it right after water (like the V05 I usually use).<br />Overall, I am happy with this product and will continue to use it. I am also going to monitor my hair growth to see if this will help my healing my scalp.<br />**update**<br />I finished my bottle today, roughly 30 days after I wrote this review and noticed that my hair does seem longer by about an inch. Obviously I cant be 100% sure since I didn't measure it before starting to use this shampoo, but if I noticed it that alone is a big deal as my hair grows very slowly. I will definitely re-purchase!

review/summary: Can't be used on it's own! Buy the conditioner, too!
review/text: The first time I used the shampoo, my hair felt like it was made out of straw. It literally stripped my hair of all moisture. Reading the bottle, it requires the conditioner to make it a complete package. At first I didn't want to try the two because I was worried it would make my hair worse, but finally I gave in and selected the conditioner as well. I'm very happy that I did! Using the shampoo and conditioner exclusively, I have to say my hair is definitely shinier, softer and healthier than before. I love the pleasing scent of the shampoo and conditioner. Neither are overwhelming. I don't know that I will switch to this shampoo and conditioner exclusively when I run out, but the price and free shipping (with Amazon Prime) certainly makes it appealing. I awarded it three stars because it requires both the shampoo and conditioner to get great results. I like more freedom in selecting my hair care products.

review/summary: Not as appealing as their Ultra Shea shampoo...
review/text: I ordered this to alternate with the Clear Ultra Shea shampoo, which, for a sulfate containing shampoo, I actually like. This Damage and Color Repair version has a very strong frangrance in comparison with the Ultra Shea, and for an alleged restorative shampoo, seems pretty drying to my color treated hair. This requires extra time with a conditioner, which is not the case with the Ultra Shea. The product was not a home run for me, and I will likely not purchase it in the future.

review/summary: Was surprised
review/text: I received this item free for review.  I've got shoulder-length curly, frizzy hair.  Color is put on my roots every 3-4 weeks.  When I ordered this, I just hoped for the best regarding healthier hair.  The temps and humidity have been brutal this summer and I have seen some days since using this where my hair wasn't as frizzy.  Is that due to the shampoo and/or the conditioner?  Hard to determine.  Yesterday it was pretty frizzy again.<br /><br />Been using the product for about 2 weeks now.  Something I did notice a couple of days ago, was that there wasn't as much hair on the floor of the shower as I've been seeing for the past couple of years.  Wow, I wasn't expecting that.  It makes sense since this product is supposed to make your scalp healthier.  But slowing down hair loss is not listed as a selling point.<br /><br />The shampoo itself has a silky feel and a light pleasant scent and my hair feels good when getting out of the shower.  Both the shampoo and conditioner can be stood with the opening down, making it quicker to dispense.<br /><br />Two things I need to mention.  The first is that the item came well-wrapped in plastic, and it's a good thing it was.  There was some leakage during shipment.  Not a lot, but it would have messed up everything else in the box.  Probably better to purchase this from a brick and mortar store to avoid possible loss of product.<br /><br />The second is that in order to see a list of ingredients, you are told to pull up part of the label.  What???  Can you see doing this in a store?  Would you purchase one that already had part of the label pulled back?  I think a redesign is in order.<br /><br />On the whole I'm happy with using the product.<br /><br />Amending my review.  I've been using the product for over a month and I'm torn as to what I think of it.  I am definitely experiencing a lot less hair loss since using it, which is a HUGE plus.  However, my hair doesn't look and feel nearly as good and the color is being stripped out of it with each washing.  I think I'm going to have to stop using it.  I've downgraded the rating from a 4 to a 3.

With the shampoo...a little goes a long way.  Nice rich suds that rinse easily.  I use both the shampoo and conditioner.  Will continue to do so.

review/text: The Good Stuff:<br /><br />The container is nice, dispenses well. The color is pale lavender. Whatever.<br /><br />The product itself is very creamy and light and has a whitish color before you apply it to your hair. It then lathers very well, especially in soft water. I had a 2-day dirty head so this worked very well on my hair and cleansed it without stripping it or making it feel dry.<br /><br />I dried and styled my hair like always yet it was more manageable than normal and did not have any frizz or "stick out" hairs. I liked that part.<br /><br />Here's the Bad Stuff:<br /><br />Woah, that is some flowery, perfume-y, strong scent! I rinsed my hair extremely well (hoping most of that scent would leave) and it still smelled VERY strong, after towel and blow drying it. This might be OK for some ladies, but this particular guy does not appreciate smelling like he just wallowed in the perfume display at Nordstrom.<br /><br />As well, there seems to be a slight residue after a few hours, especially the next morning. (And I had to throw my pillowcase in the laundry, it smelled just as strong.)<br /><br />All in all, not a bad product for your hair per se, but it's one that consumers should probably not buy unless they love smelling like a giant room freshening wick.<br /><br />+4 stars for what it did to my hair, -1 star for what it did to my nose.

review/summary: Five Star Container For An Average Shampoo...
review/text: "Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Damage & Color Repair Nourishing Shampoo" is an average shampoo packaged in a 5-star container.  The shampoo is lightly scented; the fragrance is very pleasant.  A tablespoon of the shampoo does a nice job of cleaning one's hair.<br /><br />However, while "Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Damage & Color Repair Nourishing Shampoo" is labeled as specifically formulated for hair that has been "color refreshed," it strips the color from hair much more than other similar products.  The suds, following shampooing, are very tinted by my semi-permanent hair color.  If I shampoo daily as is my custom, I foresee this shampoo "stripping" the color and revealing the grays in two weeks or less.  As I only recolor every four weeks, this is not acceptable.<br /><br />"Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Damage & Color Repair Nourishing Shampoo" is packaged in a uniquely shaped container.  It fits nicely in one's hand; is easy to hold, even with wet hands; and is easy to control with respect to dispensing the shampoo.  I plan on saving the container and refilling when the "Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Damage & Color Repair Nourishing Shampoo" is gone.<br /><br />"Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Damage & Color Repair Nourishing Shampoo" is an average shampoo in a 5-star container.  If you recolor more frequently than I do or use permanent color, you will find the product performs adequately.  Overall, it rates only 3 stars.

I don't wash it for 3 or 4 days and I look like I put cooking oil in it. But the ends feel like straw. I went and bought Shampoo and Conditioner from a salon and figured I would need to buy the expensive stuff from now on. I saw this and was instantly interested because it talked about healing the scalp where all the problems come from. After using almost a whole bottle of this I feel like I can give it a thorough review. I have discovered you don't need as much, it covers and lathers well with a quarter size.I love the smell! Very light sweet and refreshing. My hair is not as oily as before and I don't have the straw feeling in the ends when I use the conditioner too. I am impressed and that is not an easy thing to do when it comes to hair care.

I used the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Damage and Color repair Shampoo and Conditioner together. I have shoulder length, thin, straight hair which I color every few months and blow dry every day.  The damage and color repair seemed like the best fit for me.<br /><br />The smell during use was okay, but it leaves a terrible chemical cloud around my head all day and even left the same smell on my pillow. This is not a fragrance it left-- it's chemicals.  My scalp started burning not long after use and it left my hair dry, dull, and frizzy.<br /><br />I cannot remember the last time I used such a terrible beauty product and cannot wait to wash this out of my hair!<br /><br />*The only redeeming quality of this product was the bottle design.  I do really like the way it opens and closes.

review/text: I decided to try this shampoo as I regularly hi-light my hair.  To start, I'm a little skeptical over any shampoo that claims to be for damaged or color treated hair but isn't sulfate-free.  Regardless.... I like my shampoo to lather and I have found that when I actually use sulfate-free shampoo I don't notice any difference in the life of my hi-lights, and I end up wasting it because I keep trying to get it to lather by putting more and more in my hair (to no avail).<br /><br />Regarding this shampoo - I liked it and I'll buy it again.  The shampoo has a pleasant smell - it's not too strong as others have noted.  And once you rinse it out, it's about the same as any other shampoo.  I almost wish it had a stronger smell as I enjoy the smell of clean/fresh hair.  It didn't do anything mind-blowing-ly awesome to my hair, but it was nice.  A rich lather, a pleasant smell, and I will note - blow drying my hair was fast and less frizzy than normal.  I've noticed with the use of some other shampoos claiming to be for damaged hair, it takes me longer to blow dry my hair, which in turn, causes it to get frizzier.  Not with this shampoo - blow drying was fast, and for the most part, my hair has remained pretty flat all day (and I live in South Florida - so I know a thing or two about humidity).<br /><br />Overall, a good product that I would use again and recommend.  I can't give it 5 stars, simply for the fact that it claims to be for color-treated/damaged hair, yet contains sulfates.

The name 'Clear' carries connotations of purity to my mind.<br /><br />Sadly, the shampoo is not sulfate free- it's the second item on the list. So while it might be making my hair feel and look better temporarily, it's not going to help the color stay in. Which means more color damage as I have to frequently recolor... Also, the shampoo contains silicons. Now, silicons are much, much better for thin hair than oils are, but it's still a conditioner that can weigh thin, fine hair down.<br /><br />I've been using the shampoo daily for just over a week now. I can say that my hair is shinier after washing and drying, and a little easier to comb tangles out of. But the silicon does weigh my hair down a bit - not nearly as much as other shampoos for color treated hair do! - and I've noticed it collecting dust. I use a white comb, so I can readily see if there is dirt in my hair at the end of the day. Of course, I work in a very dusty/dirty atmosphere a lot of days, so YMMV.<br /><br />My decision in the end? This is a decent shampoo, and will probably use it a couple of times a week. But I want something without any conditioner/silicon for the rest of the time. Someone who has thicker hair will probably love this shampoo! I had my husband try it (his hair isn't damaged, or as limp as mine) and he thought it was really nice.<br /><br />Just one thing- I was a little confused when something named 'Clear' came out of the bottle as a creamy, opaque liquid. I rechecked the bottle to make sure I hadn't accidentally gotten conditioner!

review/summary: Works with my Hard Well Water + Highlighted Hair
review/text: I have long hair that is fine in texture and lots of it. I have my hair foil-wrapped (highlighted) about every 6-7 weeks or so. I live in a rural area and have somewhat hard well water.<br /><br />I don't really have any problems with my scalp like dandruff but because I have sort of hard well water, sometimes when I use certain moisturizing shampoos, due to all the "gunk" in them, they'll cause my scalp to itch and very occasionally will cause bumps like they are "plugging up" my folicles or something. In addition, after a few uses, some moisturizing shampoos leave my hair limp and lifeless.<br /><br />I can usually tell within a couple of uses or so whether or not the shampoo is going to work for me. I'm happy to say this shampoo works for me. After a few uses, my scalp felt fine - no itching or bumps - and my hair was soft without being weighed down.<br /><br />Also, I love the bottle this shampoo comes in. You might not be able to tell my the picture but rather than being a round bottle, it's quite oval shaped and to dispense the shampoo, you press down on one end of the top and it clicks down raising up the opposite edge that has the hole in it where the shampoo will come out.<br /><br />The oval shape makes this bottle much easier to keep ahold of than some of the bigger round bottles. One of the times I was using this shampoo, I didn't get quite enough shampoo to totally cover my hair and had to dispense more and even though my hands were soapy, I was able to grab the bottle with one hand, click it open, turn it upside down and dispense more shampoo into the palm of my opposite hand and then close the bottle up again and replace it on my shower shelf. All of that one handed and with soapy hands and I didn't drop it and it never felt like it was too slippery to keep ahold of.<br /><br />The shampoo itself is a creamy light pink color and fairly thick. Make sure your hair is extremely wet when applying so you can disperse it more easily through your hair.<br /><br />The only downside to this shampoo is the scent. To me it was a cross between ever-so-slightly chemically and sort of like the smell in the vitamin aisle of a healthfood store. It's wasn't absolutely hideous but just not my favorite and thankfully it dissipated quite a bit after my hair was dried and styled.<br /><br />I give this 4.75 stars. I like this enough that I would buy more in the future.<br /><br />Sincere THANKS to Amazon and the manufacturer/distributor who gave me the opportunity to give this product a try.

review/text: I loved (LOVED!) the Clear conditioner and had very high hopes for the shampoo. Perhaps too high. Because while I'm happy to report that it left my hair and scalp feeling fresh and clean -- which is, after all, what a shampoo is supposed to do -- it didn't leave my hair exponentially softer, the way Clear conditioner did.

review/summary: Shampoo that Mends
review/text: I gave this to a woman in my life who is a lifelong salon shampoo and conditioner user and she said she really noticed a difference in the texture of her hair afterwords. The split ends were helped considerably. Being an older woman who has had her her colored many many times this was a shampoo that was surprisingly helpful despite its price. What was most noticeable to me was that her hair seemed to have more sheen than before using the product. Now I myself can't say I've used it, but for a woman that's had many hair treatments she has a pretty good estimation of how well these types of products work. I'd recommend at least sampling if you have damage from color treatments.

review/summary: Silky smooth hair
review/text: Well this shampoo is great.  First, it smells really nice without being overly perfumed.  Second, it lathers very well in my very thick hair.  Third, it cleans my very oily hair without overdrying.  Lastly, it leaves my hair looking very silky.  I have noticed a slight improvement in my dermatitis so that is an added benefit.  I got this bottle for free but I will buy one when it runs out.  And lest you wonder why I knocked off a star...it is because I am not a big fan of the spout and shape of the bottle.  It is a little akward to open and squeeze.

review/summary: Average, pleasant shampoo
review/text: This shampoo does the job. It lathers well, smells pleasant, and seems to work fine. After lathering, the shampoo rinses out well and my hair feels squeaky clean. You don't have to use much shampoo...a little goes a long way. I really can't find any superlative things to say about it, it does the job without any problems. I will say that I have an issue with telling which is the shampoo and which is the conditioner because the bottles are almost identical and I always forget which is which.<br /><br />I can't really tell if there is a benefit to using this on my colored hair or not. Everything seems fine with this shampoo, nothing stands out as being wonderful or awful. I did not have any leakage like other reviewers have reported with the shipping of this product. The cost is reasonable, that might be the best thing about this product.

review/summary: Opened during shipping - messy delivery
review/text: There is a bit of a problem with these shampoo bottles that only really applies for shipping; the new pop top. I actually like the way the bottle opens during use - it's a vast improvement over smaller flip tops that are difficult to open with wet hands or those horrid little spout type bottles. Unfortunately, they don't ship well and arrived as a big mess. Fortunately, Amazon wrapped these in plastic which contained most of the mess but still about 1/4 of the bottle was gone.<br /><br />Now, aside from that, I'm not a big fan of the fragrance which seems quite strong...however, my better half loves the smell of this entire line of products. As for the function, with summer in Florida and very long hair, I have sun damage especially near the ends and this does seem to help keep the friz and breakage down. Hair is smooth although perhaps just a bit heavier feeling than I'd normally like.<br /><br />All in all, a nice product but open pop tops - despite the convenience when in use - leave something to be desired during extended shipping.

review/summary: Not as good as the CLEAR conditioner
review/text: I love the CLEAR Conditioner and even though I received a bottle of it for review, I'll keep buying it.  The difference in my hair is amazing and though I complained that I'm getting weird little tangles at my hairline, it dawned on me that that's because the product is so good.  Duh!<br /><br />So, since I'd used the CLEAR conditioner with my regular shampoo and getting fabulous results, I was expecting great things from the CLEAR shampoo.  Alas, I've been using for about a month now and have come to the reluctant conclusion that it's merely average.  It smells wonderful and gets my hair clean, but it's not making any more difference in my hair than just using the conditioner.<br /><br />If you like your grooming products in matched sets, then by all means purchase away, but there's really no need.  It's possible to get the CLEAR results from the conditioner alone.

review/text: The Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Damage & Color Repair Nourishing Shampoo smells absolutely incredible!  That's what makes it 2 stars and not lower.  I have used this shampoo about 5 or 6 times and even tried different conditioners with it.  However, each time, I had trouble combing the conditioner through my hair.  Also, my scalp itched slightly after using it.  I've used one of Clear's conditioners before, and it didn't get me an itchy scalp, so there must be a different ingredient in this shampoo that my body does not like.  Once again, the smell of the shampoo is absolutely incredible -- very clean, fresh, and great; but it doesn't make up for the tangly hair and bothered scalp.

review/summary: Still an issue with continer
review/text: Let me share the positive first.<br />This is a fine shampoo. I can't say I saw anything very special about it's shampooing ability, all the promised scalp and hair benefit, but I saw no negatives either. Just does a nice job<br />I think it has a pleasant smell, not too strong in my opinion.<br />And it has a nice consistency, although the lavender color is a little strange and unnecessary.<br /><br />But back to that container.<br />In use it is nice, wide, easy to use tilt top.<br />But once again (I reviewed a different variety of this brand before) the bottle leaked in transit.<br />Certainly a problem if you plan to buy it online. This time the top was wrapped in plastic, but it still came partially open and leaked. I guess the same factors that make it easy to use in a wet shower make it too easy to open in an Amazon box in shipping.

review/summary: Is it really any different than other shampoo?
review/text: I was unsure what to make of this new hair care line.  All of the basic ingredients are the same as my other shampoos for color-treated hair.  Also, my understanding of basic health science regarding healthy hair & scalp left me skeptical that the Clear shampoo or conditioner would be much different than any other.<br /><br />Many people rely on hair care products to give them healthy hair, but forget that the food you eat and the shampooing technique used are far more important.  To properly shampoo hair, use the pads of your fingers, stimulate the scalp in rows of circular motions, for at least 30 seconds.  This increases nutrient-rich bloodflow to the scalp to encourage healthy hair growth, as well as adequately exfoliate the scalp.<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />Despite my initial misgivings that this line was all hype, I still gave both the shampoo and conditioner a try.<br /><br />The shampoo lathered up better than the other shampoo I had been using, so I ended up needing less of it.<br /><br />It rinsed away smoothly, leaving my hair feeling strong.  My other shampoo left my hair feeling a bit rough and tangled, and I had always thought this was just how colored hair felt.<br /><br />I see sunflower, soybean, almond & coconut oils, as well as aloe vera, further down on the Clear ingredient list.  While my other shampoo contains some fruit extracts and grape seed oil, it does not contain the soothing ingredients found in the Clear product.  I do think this must be part of the difference between the two that I've experienced.<br /><br />I don't have fragrance sensitivities, but I don't like when it is overwhelming.  I found the fragrance to be pleasant, to me it smells like apples.<br /><br />The lid design presses open with a lever-like motion, which is much easier to operate with wet hands than a flip-open cap.<br /><br />The assymetrical design of the bottle is interesting to look at, but is a huge pain when the wider part is put away facing down (such as when the contents are running low).  I use an over-the-shower-head wire rack for my products, and the awkward shape of this lid kept getting stuck under and around other bottles when I would try to pull it out, pulling other products out with it.<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />Keep in mind that shampoo is more for the scalp area of the hair, while conditioner is for the ends.  This works well for this product line's image when it comes to the shampoos, but not for the conditioners.  I also tried the Damage & Color Repair Conditioner, and the directions instruct the user to massage it into the scalp.  This is awful, resulting in greasy hair.  So be warned, if you use the conditioner as well, just use it like regular conditioner, combed through the ends of your hair, and keep it away from your scalp.  When used this way, it is nice conditioner.<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />Overall, I was pleased with the results of using the Clear shampoo and conditioner.  My hair looks nice, seems less stressed, more shiny, and styles well.

review/summary: A Miracle Product?
review/text: Since I color my hair, fading between treatments can become an issue, especially in the summer when I'm outside more often. I was excited about trying this product because I hoped it would slow the fading process. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. It could be that I'm looking for a miracle since probably the only thing that would keep hair well conditioned and glossy is to stick with one's natural color. On the plus side, the shampoo is pretty, pink, creamy, and scented (like strawberries).

review/summary: A Good Value, but Not Good for Color Preservation
review/text: The Clear Scalp Damage & Color Repair shampoo is a reasonably good product: it has helped to minimize split ends during use. However, after spending a small fortune on coloring, I'm loathe to use this product: it contains sodium laureth sulfate, which can fade color more rapidly than shampoos without it.<br /><br />The fragrance is almost like a citrus, but a bit too cloying for my preference. The scent doesn't really linger after washing, though, which is good.<br /><br />The major drawback is actually a functional design. The bottle's closure and cap doesn't avoid inadvertent opening and leaking. The product arrived, having opened during shipment, and had spilled all over the inside of the shipping box. This meant a loss of about 1/4-1/3 of the shampoo; had there been other items in the box, they would've been destroyed. A similar issue was encountered when packing it in luggage for a trip.

review/summary: Shampoo and conditioner work well together.
review/text: I had seen the commercial for the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy.  I was intrigued by the idea of a shampoo and conditioner working from the scalp and its claim to restore the scalp's natural moisture balance.  I had never seen a product focused on the nourishing of the scalp which makes more sense than all the shampoos and conditioners of the past that are supposed to work on the ends of your hair.  The past products focused more on the prevention of split ends or ending fizzy hair.  I color my hair every 6 to 8 weeks, so I always purchase a color-safe shampoo and conditioner.  I also liked that has vitamins and nutrients including vitamins B5, C & E, sunflower, almond, soybean, coconut oils and aloe vera.<br /><br />The bottles arrived wrapped in plastic bubble wrap and did have a small amount of leakage on the shampoo bottle but the conditioner bottle was okay.  I have used both the shampoo and conditioner for over a week and I like the products very much.  The shampoo has a lovely lavender color and a light scent.  I didn't find the scent overpowering.  I like that it takes a dime size amount to get a good lather.  The conditioner also works well with a small amount in your palm.  Most conditioners I use require quite a bit to work through my entire head of hair.  I think the conditioner is very easy to work through my hair without a lot of pulling and snagging.  It feels good and it doesn't leave a heavy, greasy film on my hair.  It rinses very clean.  Overall, I like the products.  Often in the past, most store bought shampoos begin to break my head and scalp out and neither of these products have done that.  I like that both shampoo and conditioner are designed to be set in such a way that the conditioner and shampoo bottles can be set flat so that the product is always draining down towards the opening.  I would recommend both of these products.

I tried it with its companion product, Clear Scalp Hair Beauty Damage and Color Repair Nourishing Conditioner (how's that for a long name?) and found they work well together.

But I have very fine, curly hair that's temperamental, so another person might not have the same experience. All in all, I'd say this product is worth a try.

review/summary: Badly designed bottle, OK shampoo for UNcolored hair
review/text: The bottle for this shampoo has an opening that you lever up when you want to put shampoo on your hair.  The problem is that it also levers up easily during shipping, meaning the bottle is covered with shampoo when it arrives.  Amazon did wrap the bottle in a plastic bag to limit the damage, but the manufacturer should really design a bottle that doesn't leak, or at least seal the top with plastic tape.<br /><br />Clear Scalp & Hair Therapy has a strong, lingering fruity scent. Whether you like it will be a matter of taste. I color my hair, and I was hoping that a "damage and color repair" shampoo would do a good job of preserving color. I can't speak to the damage repair part, but it's not a very good color preserving shampoo. I would recommend it for someone with average, uncolored hair.

I don't wash my hair every day (more like every 3-4), so it's hard to tell about any improvement in breakage, but I do think there is a little bit. Overall, especially combined with the conditioner, I like it.

review/summary: Clean and no residue
review/text: I have color treated hair and after several weeks using this shampoo I can say that it doesn't fade my hair color. I like the creamy consistency (rather than clear liquid) without leaving a greasy residue. Hair feels clean and light after washing without being too dry or dull. It also suds up well and I end up using much less than I normally do with a similar Pantene product. The drawback is that I don't detect any added benefit from the nutrium 10. I've used other salon quality shampoo that gives me thicker, more supple hair. This one doesn't - so only 4 stars.

review/summary: Move over Nexxus, this is just as good, if not better
review/text: I am really picky about my shampoos/conditioners, and was SO dubious when Amazon sent me this item to review.<br />I have colored, fine hair, which frizzes easily and breaks often.  It grows very slowly and any harsh shampoos/conditioners will either break my hair or weigh it down and make it look dirty and lifeless.<br /><br />Amazon sent me this item (Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Damage and Color Repair Nourishing Shampoo) and the corresponding shampoo (Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Damage and Color Repair Nourishing Conditioner).<br /><br />I usually use the Nexxus damaged hair products that are found at Costco.  It is expensive, even at Costco.  But it didn't weigh my hair down nor cause breakage.<br /><br />This shampoo and conditioner smells GREAT.  I usually don't notice the scents, unless they are gross or medicinal, because my sense of smell is limited.  But this one smells really great, like fruity flowers.<br /><br />I use it basically like everyone--shampoo, rinse, condition, let sit for a minute and rinse.<br /><br />Here is where it's different:  When I comb out my hair, which is longer than shoulder length, it doesn't pull, tangle, or (on the other end of the spectrum) feel greasy or heavy.  It combs out sleekly (is that a word?) and as my hair dries naturally, it's not frizzy or lifeless--it shows off my natural curls.  If I dry it with the blowdryer, it doesn't frizz at all.  I can flat iron it, and maybe because it really allows the hair to curl naturally, it takes a bit more work to get that curl out, but it looks GREAT.<br /><br />I have been using it for a month now, and my hair dresser actually noticed a difference in my hair. She said that it grew more than usual (she's been doing my hair for 3 years now, every 6 weeks).  I believe that because my hair doesn't break or frizz, my hair really is "growing" faster because it's not breaking off.<br /><br />I didn't think that any line could replace my Nexxus, but this has.  It took me a long time to find the Nexxus--with my sensitive hair that breaks so easily...  And it saves me money, too, which is a great thing, especially in this economy.

review/summary: Thicker Than Other Shampoos
review/text: Let me say right up front that I haven't noticed any real change in my hair.  It hasn't been thicker or had less breakage or any of those things, but I still love this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR89S">CLEAR Shampoo</a> because of the thickness of the suds.<br /><br />For years I've been a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ISCZEE">Pantene</a> user but I'm switching!<br /><br />Unlike other shampoos that suds up but tend to run if not washed away quickly, CLEAR is thick and doesn't run.  I actually scrub my hair and then leave it up while I finish showering then rinse.  And it just feels so good.<br /><br />As I said, though, even with my newfound shampoo love, I can't speak to it's "special affects," because I haven't noticed any difference in my own hair.<br /><br />My hair is clean and shampooing feels good - that's enough for me!

review/summary: Hair Pleasing--Worth the Splurge
review/text: My unmanageable mane of hair currently falls to the middle of my back.  It's very fine, tangles easily and tends to confound many shampoos.  Given the amount of hair, I am used to having to use a lot of product just to work up a lather.  I've occasionally used some higher end brands and given up simply because I'm pouring out too much  at once trying to work up a lather.  It's hardly worth the price if I'm use a quarter of the bottle at a time.  Cheaper shampoos tend to fall into two categories, gloppy or watery enough to run out of my hand.  I've tended to use them because of price, but it's a quick suds and wash with the objective to get my hair rinsed as quickly as possible.<br /><br />This shampoo is neither gloppy nor too watery.  I can pop up the spout and use just about a quarter sized amount of shampoo to lather up the entire mass of hair.  It lathers quickly, with a pleasant texture and smell and rinses out without the feeling I've either dried my hair out  or left a stick residue.  My hair is noticeably more manageable, especially when I have to brush it out and detangle it (which is a chore).  I'm able to get it combed and ready for my day in about half the time it takes with cheaper shampoos. While I don't like this shampoo quite as much as the Shea shampoo, it's a wonderful go-to for my color weary hair that doesn't cost my grocery budget to buy.  As with all products, if you have sensitive skin, it's probably worthwhile to be cautious with anything not designed for sensitive skin.  I haven't had any problems with it, and my skin appears to be less dried out than usual after showers--which is a plus.<br /><br />^_^ Shanshad

review/text: I have used ths shampoo for a month or so. This bottle was the first i recieved from amazon but not the first i used. I'm very happy with it. It has a pleasant but not overpowering scent, lathers up quickly and rinses out easily. My hair when dry doesn't look weighed down the way it does with some other shampoos. It was shipped tightly wrapped in plastic and while there was a little leakage into the wrap it was completely contained and easily rinsed off from the bottle so it didn't concern me.

review/summary: Moisturizes but not color protecting
review/text: My husband and I tried this product along with the corresponding conditioner. His hair is dry, thinning, and brittle, very curly but not color treated. Mine is normal, slightly wavy, with good body, and salon colored.<br /><br />He likes this product for the moisturizing effect. We have tried just about every product we can find but his hair continues to be fragile.  This is the first product that he said actually makes a difference. His hair is softer and breaks less after only 2 weeks.<br /><br />For my color treated hair, it's made no positive difference. I don't like the texture feel of the hair when wet, and my color has faded twice as fast as it does using John Frieda shampoo for red hair.<br /><br />We'll probably keep buying this product for my husband's brittle hair, but I've stopped using it on mine.

review/text: This is my first time using this shampoo and I was very happy with it.  The product is smooth, has a wonderfully pleasant aroma --not too strong-- and lathers up well.  My hair felt soft and shiny, and after using nearly the entire bottle I haven't experienced any build-up or other strange after-effects.  I did not use it with the conditioner, so I don't know what their combined effect would be, but I would recommend the shampoo and will likely use it again.

review/summary: Clean, Clear and Colorful
review/text: I ordered both the Clear Scalp Shampoo and the Conditioner for Damage and Color Repair since I regularly color my dark hair and like to use products that help sustain the color. I typically buy sulfate-free since those seem to work best, and was a little bit surprised that this formula contained sulfates. However, I didn't notice any negative difference in my color after using it for a just few weeks.<br /><br />The shampoo did seem to be a thorough cleanser,leaving my hair "squeaky clean" and once I added the conditioner it left my hair soft and silky as I stepped out of the shower. I found the scent clean and pleasant and it doesn't linger at all after rinsing.<br /><br />Once blow-dried, it did seem that the shampoo might have been a bit of a stronger cleanser than I am used to since my hair was slightly fluffier than usual. It could also be that the conditioner was not as deep conditioning as I have found with other products made for color-treated or damaged hair. I should note that I have relatively "normal-dry" wavy hair and this might be a bit more ideal for those who have "oily-normal" hair.<br /><br />I would recommend this combo to anyone looking for a super clean head of hair with body, but not to anyone who tends to have dry hair to begin with since it may be a bit too harsh. I also wonder about long term use on color treated hair with a product that contains sulfates, since I prefer those without. They performed pretty well, so I did give the shampoo/conditioner 4 stars, but it could have had 5 if it were sulfate-free.

review/summary: Wonderful scent, buffered lather, didn't strip my hair
review/text: If you were a child of the 80's you will feel a definite sense of deja vu with this product! The smell and feel of it reminded me instantly of PermaSoft. The next closest smell would be Pert Plus. It's the same manufacturer as Pert Plus so that makes sense.<br /><br />This shampoo did a great job of removing hairstyling product buildup without stripping my hair, and I didn't have to shampoo twice to achieve that. I tested it on 3-day-old gross hair, and one wash removed all the buildup and gunk! I used it without a follow up conditioner and my hair was not frizzy, dry, or flyaway like it normally would be with what I consider a 'drugstore product'. It was very soft and had soft waves, no frizz.<br /><br />I normally only use a few certain salon brands on my hair because I have it colored and I use a flatiron a lot (lots of damage potential there!); I would consider this brand of shampoo to be an acceptable substitute and not worry too much that it's stripping my color in the meantime.<br /><br />I would buy this.

review/summary: Smooth and creamy - feels nice
review/text: The shampoo is opaque, with a slightly pinkish color. It is very smooth and comes out of the bottle easily.  Note the bottle opens at the top, whereas that of the conditioner opens at the bottom. Also the bottle is skinny, so it looks to hold more than its 12.9 fluid ounces or 381 milliliters.  It did not irritate my scalp and was smooth to apply.  If you have really filthy, greasy hair then <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001XQ7LOS">Dawn Ultra Dishwashing Liquid, Original Scent, Blue,  24 Ounce (Pack of 2)</a> would provide a stronger degreasing effect, but it could make the hair dry.  So the shampoo has to be rubbed in for a while to remove dirt well. Then the hair has to be rinsed to remove the bubbles and other shampoo ingredients.<br /><br />I tried it twice - the first time I did not use conditioner.  The second time, after I used the shampoo I used <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8UM">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a>.  The shampoo was so creamy that I thought it might be possible to avoid using conditioner - the results were OK - my hair was not frizzy. However, with the conditioner it became quite shiny and silky.<br /><br />I am not commenting on the toxicity or lack of toxicity of the ingredients.  I am giving an ingredient list so readers can find what is in the product.  The ingredients in common with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8UM">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a> are:<br /><br />Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract<br />Ascorbic Acid<br />Dimethiconol<br />DMDM Hydantoin<br />Fragrance<br />Glycerin<br />Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil<br />Helianthus Annus (Sunflower) Seed Oil<br />Hydrogenated Coconut Oil<br />Lysine HCI<br />Methychloroisothiaszolinone<br />Methylisothiaszolinone<br />Niacinamide<br />Panthenol<br />Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil<br />Red 33 (CL 17200)<br />Sodium Chloride<br />TEA-dodecylbenzenesulfonate<br />Tocopheryl Acetate<br />Water<br />Zinc Pyrithione<br />Zinc Sulphate<br /><br />The ingredients in the shampoo and not in the conditioner are:<br />Bismuth Oxychloride (Cl 77163)<br />Carbomer<br />Citric Acid<br />Cocomidopropyl Betaine<br />Dimethicone<br />Guar Hydroxypeopyltrimonium Chloride<br />Mica (Cl 77019)<br />Poloxamer 407<br />Sodium Isethionate<br />Sodium Laureth Sulfate<br />Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate<br />Stearic Acid<br />Tallow Acid<br />Titanium Dioxide (CL 77891)<br />Xanthan Gum<br /><br />Ingredients in the conditioner and not in the shampoo are:<br />Behentrimonium Chloride<br />Cetearyl Alcohol - emulsifier, foaming agent<br />Cyclopentasiloxane - silicone to stop hair breaking<br />Dimethylamine<br />Dipropylene  Glycol<br />Lactic Acid<br />PEG-150 Distearate<br />Stearamidopropyl<br /><br />I may have missed some ingredients in common as some ingredients have multiple names and shampoo labeling tends to be inconsistent.<br /><br />As you can see there are multiple chemicals. The shampoo claims it has 10 vitamins and nutrients.<br /><br />I prefer shampoos with simpler ingredient lists.  Despite various nut and seed oils, this is really a chemical-based shampoo.  However, the shampoo works well and provides a high quality wash. It does what it claims to do - repairs damage. With 4 coloring agents at least (that make the shampoo the same hue as the bottle), I assume it "repairs color" - whatever that means!<br /><br />I wish the ingredients weren't hidden under the label - as it was they came off with the label and I had to scan them from behind then reflect them in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EUBSL0">Adobe Photoshop CS4 - Old Version</a> to read them.

I'm skeptical about hair product claims because I have found that products vary only slightly - if at all - from the cheapest products to the most expensive. But Clear Scalp and Hair is distinctly different. After about a week of use I actually could tell that my scalp was less dry - I didn't have flakes and  it didn't feel tight after a hot shower. My hair is prone to oiliness, and I didn't experience excessive oiliness with this product, nor did it weigh my hair down. It also smells great, which is a bonus.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say I have found my new shampoo - it works great.

review/summary: Decent Everyday Shampoo
review/text: First of all I want to say that I also had a problem with my shampoo bottle breaking and getting everywhere during shipping. In my case, it was UPS's fault since the package actually had foot prints on it and looked beat up. Amazon was quick to reship me a new bottle that arrived fine. If you have this issue, Amazon is willing to fix it for you.<br /><br />On to the shampoo..I normally alternate between Herbal Essences, Pantene Pro-V and Aussie. I have straight, thick, long, highlighted hair. I was a little disappointed to see that this shampoo has Sodium Laureth Sulfate in it. Sodium Laureth Sulfate is known for being bad for colored hair, so I am not sure why it is in this "Color Repair" shampoo.<br /><br />The shampoo itself is thick and creamy and has a slightly pink color. It has a really nice almost floral scent. It lathers well and you don't have to use a ton of it. Honestly, it feels like Pantene Pro-V. It leaves your hair feeling clean, soft and healthy. However, I don't think it does anything to repair your color. The Sodium Laureth Sulfate may even harm it. My hair is not damaged, so I can not attest to that part of the shampoo claim.<br /><br />Overall, I do like the shampoo and will buy it in the future, but only if it is on sale.

review/summary: Very Thick ... Helped Flakiness on Scalp
review/text: I tend to have a flaky and dry scalp. I occasionally use dandruff shampoos and they help somewhat. When I saw this new shampoo, I thought I'd give it a go. I'd prefer to use a "regular" shampoo than a special one so it seemed worth a try.<br /><br />The CLEAR shampoo is very thick. It lathers up quite nicely and stays on your head rather than dripping down. It seemed thicker than any other shampoo I tried -- more like a conditioner than a shampoo. After using it for a week or so, I'd have to say that my scalp felt less itchy and dry. I didn't notice any significant other changes -- my hair wasn't shinier or easier to manage but I did think it help clear up my scalp issues somewhat.<br /><br />The smell is subtle and not too strong.<br /><br />I would use this shampoo again.

review/summary: Light scent, feels nice
review/text: I've been using this shampoo exclusively for a couple of weeks and will continue using it.  The scent is difficult to pin down: it's a light scent and reminds me of the smell of shampoo at my hairdresser's but it doesn't really smell like anything (mint, fruit, spice).  It has pleasant lather and leaves my hair manageable.  I'm not sure that using this will keep my color from fading more rapidly than it does, but it's not a bad shampoo.<br /><br />I have fairly thick wavy hair and live in a humid climate--so I appreciate the fact that my hair does not frizz much with this product.<br /><br />The only problem I had was with the delivery of the shampoo. Although it was wrapped in plastic, the cap was not secured and about 1/3 of the bottle emptied into the shipping envelope.  I don't think I'd ever order shampoo in the mail after that experience.

It has a tendency to be dry, and it is very prone to frizziness.<br />I have tried a lot of products (of various costs) to try to make my hair shiny, straight, and non-frizzy.<br />I received this shampoo, and the accompanying conditioner a couple of weeks ago, and have been using them exclusively, without using any additional products.<br />The shampoo is packaged in a very usable bottle, it is easy to get the shampoo out, even with hands that are wet and slippery.<br />The shampoo is very sudsy, and has almost no odor. Even though there are lots of suds, they rinse out very easily. My hair feels clean and soft after shampooing.<br />I have not used the shampoo without the conditioner, so the comments are for both products used together.<br />After towel drying my hair, it is relatively easy to comb through, although there are some small tangles. After blow drying my hair is really soft and nice, and the flat iron straightens it very well.<br />I have noticed, though, that my hair has a tendency to be somewhat fly-away with this product, so I will try to use a leave-in product as well.<br />Since I live in Florida, humidity is a big problem, and I do not find this product to help with frizziness.<br />All in all I really like this shampoo, and I would give it 5 stars if I lived in a less humid area.

review/summary: clear scalp damage & color repair
review/text: i gave this to the wife for her to use.  after a couple of applications she said that it did help her hair and was repairing the split ends.  she said wouldn't know about the color repair since her hair is turning silver anyway.  looking at her hair it seemed to me that it seemed fluffier and the color was a little bit bolder-but hey what does a man know.

review/summary: Not as great as I hoped.
review/text: I am a big fan of Suave and since this product is made by the same company, I jumped at the chance to try something new from them. I have to say my review may be tainted by the way the product came to me. First, when the package arrived, it was leaking. The bottle was inside a plastic bag which must have been made to seal in any leakage. I don't know if it was broken or the button on top somehow got pushed, but half of the bottle of shampoo was out. Once I cut off the wrapping and threw away the spoils, the bottle seemed okay. I put it in my shower, eager to try it the next morning.<br />The shampoo itself is okay. It smells and feels like the "color seal" shampoo you get in a hair-dye box for after rinsing. I'm not found of that sort of smell everyday, but it's not unpleasant. After using the shampoo for a couple of days, my hair felt limp and oily compared to using Suave shampoo and conditioner (I like to use Mango Mandarin, Citrus Smoothie, or Apple). For someone who's hair is usually light, healthy, and shiny, I did not like the effect this shampoo gave to my hair. For someone who tends to have dry scalp, it might help you. I stopped using it after a week.<br />After a few uses, the bottle started leaking from the (almost) invisible seam holding the lid on. I don't know if I got a messed up bottle or if this is how they all are. I would not buy this again.

review/summary: Doesn't live up to the hype
review/text: I am a die hard salon product user, usually <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CMLRWO">Aveda Color Conserve Shampoo, 8.5-Ounce Bottle</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BIXP3A">Bumble and Bumble Gentle Shampoo, 8-Ounce Bottle</a> as I color my hair every 6 weeks at the salon. So a product really has to be good to get my approval. Clear falls short.<br /><br />It will clean your hair, but the quality here is very much more grocery store - you get what you pay for. Its claims to give one a healthier scalp are unfounded, in my opinion, as there was no decrease in scalp dryness over weeks of use. For a truly healthy scalp, try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XTFP0I">Nioxin Cleanser, System 2 (Fine/Noticeably Thinning ), 33.8 Ounce</a> and pair it with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4GIPM">Nioxin Scalp Therapy, System 3 (Fine/Treated/Normal to Thin-Looking), 33.8 Ounce</a>.<br /><br />The scent of Clear lingers all day, but it does this by being overpowering. Hair is not nourished, feeling dry and fly away after use.

review/summary: Clearly--a winner!
review/text: I gave my wife the new "CLEAR Scalp and Hair Therapy shampoo and conditioner for damage and color repair" for her birthday.  She is picky about her hair products and has trained me to purchase only those for color treated hair, though she rarely admits to having color added.  I've learned my lesson, about her pickiness, when buying shampoo and conditioner, but I dared to try something new.<br /><br />Whew! Did I ever score with CLEAR!  She told me "the bottle shapes are so cute, and the open/close mechanism was very secure," something she doesn't always find on her regular brands.  She also said she doesn't need to use as big a portion to clean as she has before, making it very economical.  She said the suds felt thick, smooth, and it had a nice mild scent.<br /><br />After just a couple days of use, and especially after a full week of daily use, she thought her hair was indeed shinier thatn before, had much better texture, and seemed smooth, manageable, and extremely soft.  Usually in the humidity of warm weather she has the "frizzies."  When the CLEAR runs out, she asked me to get her more.  Boy, do I now have little gifts for future occasions--the jackpot of suprise gift-giving!

review/summary: good, but wait a few days to get used to it
review/text: This shampoo has a nice light fragrance and lathers quickly and efficiently (even in pretty hard water). My hair is color-treated and on the dry and thick side. The first time I used this product, my hair felt more dry, but after a few shampoos, I find that it leaves my hair feeling comparatively clean and soft. It is definitely best applied with the companion conditioner (clear scalp and hair beauty damage and color repair nourishing conditioner). A good choice for the price.

review/summary: LOVE this new product
review/text: I have very fine, long and thin hair that I color to hide the gray.  I also live in the northern part of the country and during the colder months my hair is SO dry it is like straw.  I tried the Clear Scalp conditioner, and really liked it, so I broke down to try the Clear Scalp shampoo.  I got this one because my hair is colored and so dry that I would call it a bit damaged.  I tried this shampoo with the conditioner and didn't need to add any leave in conditioner after my shower - this stuff just really cleaned my hair and conditioned it so well that I just blow dried it and was good to go.  I am very happy with this product, and I love the smell.  I would recommend this and buy it again.

review/summary: Clever bottle design
review/text: I've been using both the shampoo and conditioner for a few days now. It has a nice long lasting fragrance. My hair feels clean and soft. I reitterate SOFT. I go the salon on a regular basis to have my hair colored. I use shampoo/conditioner for color treated hair and some have left my hair feeling dry. Not the case with Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty. It really left my hair feeling soft through out the day.<br /><br />Another bonus: for people like me, who need eye glasses to read and have a hard time deciphering which bottle is the shampoo and which is the conditioner, the shape of both bottles is not only very helpful but is also very clever. Both bottles have a flat spot and you push down for the spot to open and dispense shampoo or conditioner. The shampoo sits up right with the spot on the top and the conditioner sits with the spot on the bottom. No problem with trying to figure out which bottle is the shampoo or conditioner.<br /><br />I liked this product and will be purchasing more.

review/summary: Silky hair color vibrant
review/text: For the last 12 years I have colored my hair religiously every 3 months. For the last 11 years I spent countless dollars on salon products and finally decided that their has to be other products that work as well if not better. I am surprised I liked this shampoo as much as I did because I have been using sulfate free however I did assume that since this was "Clear" it was also sulfate free however it is the second ingredient on the list. Lathers well, great scent, and leaves my hair soft and silky. Color is very vibrant however I will alternate after this bottle finishes back to my sulfate free and then back to this just to change it up.

review/summary: bottle design not good, liked what was left of the shampoo
review/text: I actually bought this shampoo at the supermarket.  The reason I give it 3 stars is the bottle lid design.  It is WAY too easy for the top to open in a bag, box or whatever.  The checkout person bagged this shampoo by itself which was a godsend because the top tipped open and half the contents were in the bag.  I would expect many more negative comments like this one unless they change their lid design or tape off the top so it can't tip to the open position.  I liked the scent of the shampoo (on the strong side) and thought it cleaned well, left my hair full bodied and my scalp moisturized.  I agree with another poster about the SLS.  I primarily use WEN or Loreal Creme (LOVE IT) and my bleached hair looks wonderful after being severely damaged due to bleaching and nutritional problems.  Clear did not give me the luminosity and shine or define my color hair the way the creme poo does.  I will only use whats left on occassion when I want a fluffier style.

review/summary: Goodbye Garnier Fructus, Hello Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty!
review/text: I have thick shoulder-length hair that every 3 - 4 months my salonist either colors or highlights (and chops away some of the thickness so I don't look like a wooly mammoth).  For this reason, I switched from using my usual brand, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GCWDDE">Fructis Sleek and Shine fortifying Shampoo By Garnier for Unisex Shampoo, 13 Ounce</a>, to this brand.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: This was used in conjunction with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8TS">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Damage & Color Repair Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a>.<br /><br />I rather liked the packaging.  It is a little similar to the Clear Conditioner, but fortunately, I have sharp eyes.  The shampoo itself had a nice, light pleasant smell, and a good consistency (neither too thick, nor too thin and watery).<br /><br />I started out with about a palm-sized amount of shampoo--what normally would have been just enough with my regular brand.  I quickly found out that this was too much for the Clear shampoo.  It lathers quite nicely and also rinses out quite easily.<br /><br />But the end results were what stunned me.  My hair was delightfully soft and smooth!  After flat-ironing my hair, my hair was sleek and flat in a way that I could only rarely get from my usual hair products.  But the best part was when a coworker approached me and asked if I had recently gone in to have my hair cut and colored.  I told him, no, my last appointment was a month ago!<br /><br />I am now a convert; I'm saying goodbye to Garnier Fructus, and hello to Clear and better hair!<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

review/summary: Clean, shiny hair!
review/text: I can't say enough good things about the Clear Scalp & Hair line. The product delivers exactly what it claims to do...beautiful, clean hair. The shampoo is creamy and silky with a very rich lather. It rinses well without a filmy residue left behind. The scent is light and pleasing and not overpowering like some leading shampoos on the market. The only negative thing I can say about this product is that I wish it came in a bigger size! Definitely worth the money!

review/summary: OK
review/text: For a product that is supposed to nourish damaged and colored hair, I was surprised that the second ingredient is sodium laurel sulfate, a harsh, cheap ingredient to help foaming/lather.  I've started buying soaps and shampoos without sodium laurel sulfate.<br /><br />I also found the fragrance too strong.<br /><br />When it arrived, it was wrapped in plastic, in a padded envelope. The envelop had been squeezed so some of the shampoo squished out.  I could smell the shampoo through the envelop.<br /><br />My hair is soft and clean. My scalp is clean.<br /><br />It's OK but I don't think I'd get it again.<br /><br />AUGUST 21, 2012 UPDATE:<br />I've been using a Conditioning - Shampoo (like Wen) for a couple of weeks and find Clear Scalp and Hair is a MUST - at least once a week.  The conditioning shampoos clean the hair but not the scalp.  Clear SCALP and Hair is extremely helpful - actually necessary - to clean "debris" aka dandruff so I can enjoy a conditioning  shampoo. : )
