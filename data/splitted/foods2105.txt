review/summary: GREAT SUBSITITUE FOR REGULAR SPAGHETTI
review/text: Theese buckwheat noodles are so good and my non-health food loving husband actually prefers them over regular spaghetti. He normally hates whole wheat spaghetti.  Just use with regular tomato sauce, you don't have to use them only for asian-style dishes.  Once again, another great product by Annie.  Yum-Yum Annie Chun!

review/text: Annie Chun's Soba Japanese Noodles, 12oz. These noodles were just ok for me. I much prefer the texture of Hakubaku organic soba noodles. I think its their size as they cook up differently. But the real deciding factor for me is the salt content, 390mg making it a daily value of 15%, as Hakubaku is a mere 0.1mg

review/summary: Pretty good soba noodles
review/text: These buckwheat noodles are among our favorite summer snacks, and my 7 year old son will eat them anytime.  You want to cook them according to the package instructions and then flush them with cold water in the sink until they're chilled, then strain.  You can actually ziploc these up and get a couple of days out of them if you don't feel like cooking on a hot summer stretch.<br /><br />In a bowl with Memmi sauce (sort of like a teriyaki style sauce, soy, sugar, etc) water to thin the memmi, sliced or shredded cucumber, carrot, chili's, whatever you like.  Wonderful tasting and refreshing, takes 5 minutes to put together.

review/text: These noodles are great.  I have been serving whole wheat pasta, then after reading about soba noodles, decided to try them.  I chose this brand based on the price and reviews.  The first time I served them with grilled zucchini and a marinara sauce.  After the first bite, my husband asked what kind of pasta I was using.  When I told him, he asked me to never use anything else.  I had to agreed, they were the best...even better than regular pasta, as they seem to absorb the flavors of the dish.  Guess we are hooked.

review/text: My family likes these soba noodles - they show up on our menu for Saturday lunch without fail. I make sure not to overcook them and dunk them in ice water as soon as they have boiled, to prevent them from turning soft or slimy.<br />However, I have not sampled any other brand of soba noodles nor have I been able to determine how much buckwheat flour (as percentage of total flour) these noodles contain. So I am not able to provide a more objective review.

review/text: I haven't recieved the noodles yet, but I'm very impressed with the price! With my sights set on making a soba dish, I headed to the grocery store to find that an eight-ounce package of Soba noodles was selling for $7. And my recipe called for twelve ounces! I just could not see paying $14 for a simple noodle dish. As an experiment, I bought one package of soba noodles, and one $3 package of Udon to see if the soba noodles were really necessary. The soba noodles were significantly better for this dish, so I was resigned to have to pay so much for my yummy dish.<br /><br />Then I came here to and found that I can get a larger package of noodles for a little over $3 per package (after shipping)! I was very pleased. I hope they taste good! I'll be back for more, as I think I'm becoming addicted to Soba noodles!

review/summary: Where have all the deals gone?
review/text: It's not the 7 buck deal I got in March 2012 and at over 13 bucks now it's actually much cheaper in the stores. I purchased the 20oz. pack of 3 so that was about 2.34 a box and close to what I was paying in stores so I went for the free shipping and bought two. I'm in a rural area and it's a long trip to the store so we go about once a month and having this deal meant I didn't have to look at several stores to find the best price. However, over 4 bucks a box is no deal. I gave this 5 stars because I like Raisin Bran; I could not see where it was made so no complaints about Mexico, the use by dates are mid-2013; the price was right and I was a happy camper. I would not purchase this again at this price for any reasons that I can possibly fathom. As a side note, check prices carefully in the food stores because I find that the larger boxes are often more per ounce than the smaller boxes and at one store the store brand in a bag was more per ounce than the Kellogg's.

review/summary: Not as fresh dated as I get at the Stores and made in Mexico
review/text: I just received 3 Boxes of Kellogs Rasin Bran as a Subscribe and Save purchase.  I like to check the "Use By Date" at the stores because it may sit awhile in our pantry before we use it.  I bought Kellogs Rasin Bran at Sam's Club last week, and it has a date for June 2013.  The boxes I just got from Amazon are dated for February 2013, so I will have to use them up first.  It is mid-Sept 2012 now, so there is still time to use the 3 boxes.  But dissapointed that they are closer dated than at the stores here. Also, the Box from Sam's shows Battle Creek, Michigan - and these from Amazon show being from Mexico. Based on this and other reviews here mentioning Kellog's ingredients being altered, I think I will change to another brand and cancel my Subscribe and Save.

review/summary: Raisins for breakfast
review/text: I've had raisin bran from various brands, from growing up on various cereal that popped up on sale, but I don't remember any of them having as many raisins as Kellogg's Raisin Bran! It seems every normal-sized spoonful has 5-6 raisins on average. It's enough to make me look up the health benefits of raisins, as I can't see a cereal this sweet as being very healthy. As suspected, raisins are full of calories, mainly from sugars. If you're looking for a very healthy cereal, look elsewhere. This one seems to be made for those with a sweet tooth, though I guess some may find that sweetness from raisins is better than sweetness from other ingredients (ex. high fructose corn syrup).<br /><br />My rating reflects my personal opinion and taste, more than the quality of the product. Amazon shipped them to me in a shape no worse than found at a local grocery store and the flakes are still very crisp and palette pleasing, with the sell by date 6 months away (Mar '13). It seems fresh enough. It's the ratio of raisins and flakes that bugs me; I guess I was hoping more for a bowl of Wheaties with only a handful of raisins, for 1-2 raisins per spoonful on average.<br /><br />As a warning for those who don't normally eat raisin bran, beware that this cereal is dense. 20 oz of this stuff comes in a similar sized box as some others' 10-14 oz boxes. If you eat a bowl of it, filled up the same amount as you would with something like Cheerios, this will leave you a heavy feeling in your stomach. I recommend mixing some of this cereal with some other cereal, to make it more palatable, with my favorite being Quaker Oatmeal Squares, though I imagine this goes well with many other cereals.<br /><br />Also note that these boxes currently do not have any Kellogg's Family Rewards codes, at least the three I checked do not. Maybe it might be a new program and Amazon still has old stock.

review/summary: It's Kellog's R. Brain, which most people already know, so buy on price if cheaper than store, but...
review/text: Not a huge fan of Kellog's Raisin Bran for a variety of reasons:<br /><br />1. Relative to other flakey cereals (Special K, Total etc.), the flakes are sometimes not always fresh (I don't know about Amazon's batch) and it really makes the cereal sort of gummy and yucky<br />2. In general, the flakes themselves, even when fresh,a re not real crunchy (admittedly, they are bran flakes, not pure rice, wheat or corn flakes, so they seem more like a bran fiber cereal) and they get mushy in milk pretty quickly.<br />3. Amazon used to have a four-pack for nearly the same price, so this is not a big savings anymore with the three-pack (pricey NYC stores typically always have Kellog's Raisin Bran on sale and it's usually $2.99/20 oz box).<br /><br />On the plus side, I DO like the raisins. They're plump and not sugary coated.

review/text: I wouldn't go so far to say this cereal is bad for you, but with the amount of added sugar it isn't great. I suppose that is the only way you can make bran appealing to the masses though. Bran is the nutritious cardboard part of a wheat grain. I personally would like to see them reduce the added sugar and add more raisins for a natural sweetness. As far a a amazon rating though it is, in my opinion, a good (not great) tasting cereal and has a good bit or fiber and protein. Also it's price is great for to the door delivery and you don't have to wait for it to go on sale at your local grocery store.

review/summary: The great raisin bran debate: Post vs. Kellogg's
review/text: I switch between Kellogg's and Post's respective versions of raisin bran since each has its pluses. Post has the flake portion down pat - large flakes with a nice crunch. In contrast, the Kellogg's flakes are smaller and more fiber-tasting. (As an aside, the Kellogg's flakes work better than Post when using the cereal as an add-in for baking multi-grain breads or oatmeal cookies).<br /><br />But raisins are part of the equation as well. Kellogg's seems to have more raisins and, more importantly, they taste better - plumper and less chewy than the ones in Post.<br /><br />I usually get Kellogg's since I can live with their less than great flakes, and they usually cost less (good sales on Amazon, plus I can get the jumbo boxes at Sam's Club). But, if only these two companies would collaborate - flakes by Post, raisins by Kellogg's. That would be perfect

review/summary: Unacceptable ingredients
review/text: I will no longer consider buying product from Kelloggs for the following reason:<br />Kelloggs continues to include GMO (genetically modified organism) ingredients in their products but refuses to include that information on their product labels.  There are no long term studied to prove that GMOs are safe for either human or animal consumption.  Kelloggs/ position is that GMOs are deemed safe by the FDA so they are not required to be identified to consumers.  However, Michael Taylor, head of the FDA, is a former attorney for Monsanto, the chemical company responsible for the development and wide spread use of GMOs in the American food supply, illustrating a conflict of interest that prevents the FDA from acting responsibly.  It's interesting to note that 50 other countries around the world have banned GMOs from their food supply all together but consumers here in the United States do not even have the right to be informed when GMOs are present in the products we buy.  Kelloggs is an unacceptable choice as long as they refuse to fully disclose the true nature of their ingredients to consumers.

review/summary: Contains GMOs! We say NO!
review/text: Kellogg's Raisin Bran contains unlabeled genetically modified ingredients and Kellogg doesn't want you to know this. They contributed $632,500 to a propaganda campaign in California to try to trick people into voting against Prop. 37, which would require that genetically engineered foods be labeled. Raisin Bran contains GMO Bt corn and GMO sugar derived from GMO sugar beet. Both were developed and patented by chemical companies. GMO Bt corn is an EPA registered pesticide. It has been genetically engineered by forcing a foreign gene that makes its own pesticide into the plant DNA. Every cell of this plant is a pesticide factory. When corn worms bite into it, their stomachs explode. Both the sugar and the corn have foreign genes for herbicide resistance forced into their DNA. The plants are made to resist high levels of RoundUp. The active chemical ingredient in RoundUp, a chemical called glyphosate, has been linked to birth defects, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer and more. These GMOs have been snuck into our food supply without telling us. 50 countries around the world require that GMOs be labeled (including all of Europe, China, Russia, Japan, Australia, Brazil and India). In the US there is currently NO labeling law. The FDA does NOT require long term, peer reviewed studies to determine if GMOs are really safe. They let the chemical companies that patent these "foods" decide. How can this be when the FDA is there to protect us? WRONG. Just google Michael Taylor, Food Safety Czar and you'll see that he's setting food policy. When it suits him, he uses the revolving door to go back and forth between the FDA and the largest chemical company that is patenting and trying to monopolize our food supply.  Should people be eating this stuff? I wouldn't feed it to my pets. My family is boycotting ALL Kellogg's products.

review/text: Delicious & well worth it. Found it at Target & Meijer, Cheaper at Target I think. Great taste, better than peanut butter believe me... Well that's what I think but I do love sun flower seeds so I'm a little bias. Only thing is that by the time you get to the last 1/2 inch it's a little packed so I turn it upside down when in the cupboard so it doesn't separate. I've read some time ago about certain chemicals in peanut butter that cause cancer & so we've been using Sunbutter for the last 3 years. Try it!!!!

I have actually come to like it better than peanut butter. I like that it is a little more oily than peanut butter, so it spreads better and does not stick to the roof of your mouth. I have not baked with it yet, but I do love it with celery sticks or apple slices.

review/summary: Seriously Delicious.
review/text: Yummy. I am allergic to peanuts (Mildly, like many, many other people) and just never really cared for peanut butter all that much. I still always liked certain peanut butter candies and cookies though.<br /><br />I recently decided to go Vegan-ish which to my knowledge requires lots of pb&j's. Since I am taking care of myself (...my body), I have chosen not to eat peanut butter. I was totally bummed about not enjoying pb&j's like other vegans and vegan wannabe's, until I spied this stuff on sale in a grocery store flier. I did a quick search before shelling out the clams for this pricey treat(I think I searched taste and sunflower seed butter) And found a great comparison of the two butters (peanut vs. sunflower) and decided to go for it.<br /><br />So Glad I did. It is totally worth it. I am currently trying to find a recipe for sunflower seed butter though due to the cost compared to the cost of just plain sunflower seeds... Found this for sale on amazon with only two measly reviews and thought I should let whomever is interested know... This product is certainly worth the moolah but you are going to want to eat so much of it that the cost may be a bit imperative to your taste buds' desires for more more more sunbutter.<br /><br />Perfect for peanut free classrooms, lunchrooms schools, whatever. It tastes remarkably similar to peanut butter with a Slightly runnier consistency. I recommend a good stirring with each use (stirring sunbutter is way easier than stirring those natural peanut butters). Store opened container in fridge to prolong freshness.<br /><br />To my peanut allergic taste buds sun-butter tastes like peanut butter without whatever the weird stuff is in peanut butter that makes it taste slightly off (other than hydrogenated oils, of course) and it comes without that weird yet vaguely appealing peanut butter scent.<br /><br />I am going to try making sun-butter "peanut butter" cookies sometime soon. I have missed those since giving up peanut butter a few years ago.

review/summary: The only energy drink I can enjoy without jitters.
review/text: I am constantly searching for an energy drink that is "better" than Red Bull. My father drinks Red Bull regularly, and over the years I have brought him many different energy drinks to try--none that he liked. That was until he tried Pure Energy, he actually shrugged and said "I can do this". I had bought two of the drinks then, saved one for myself.<br /><br />I used to have major problems with my blood sugar, but have since improved my diet drastically. I don't drink soda--essentially this has become my once-in-a-while treat of such a craving.<br /><br />With only 15g of sugar per can (natural beet sugar at that!), this is a shining improvement over almost every energy drink. The guarana and B vitamins contribute to a good energy rush. I have yet to experience jitters that I get with almost any other sugary or caffeinated beverage. These are becoming a favorite addition to pre-workout meals. And to top all of that off, the "crash" is quite minimal.<br /><br />You can find these sold as single can at a lot of stores these days (especially the natural/organic stores") so try one there, and be ready to buy a case (or four).

review/text: As mentioned by some other reviewers it is not a 100% buckwheat noodle but a mix of wheat and buckwheat. The noodles resemble more of a wholewheat type spaghetti that you can get in any store.<br /><br />Also the noodles are just shipped in a box in an unsealed plastic bag which is not very sanitary or smart as the box could get damp in shipping and ruin the product. I don't like opened boxes of grain goods because they can get pests in them so I had to take the noodles out and divide them up into zip lock bags.

The box holds the noodles well, I haven't had an instance where the noodles don't taste as fresh as they did the day I opened them.<br /><br />I would highly recommend these for anyone looking for a bulk case of soba noodles.

review/summary: Barely adequate
review/text: I'll admit it, I was attracted by the price and the lack of negative reviews.  I really wanted to like this product.  I've been drinking sencha for years and drink a lot of it.  This particular tea is certainly drinkable, but it lacks any of the qualities of a good sencha. After several weeks of experimenting, I find that the best way to brew it is to use 3 times as much as I would for another sencha (I use 3 teaspoon fulls for my medium sized teapot) and then only brew it for a short time, under 3 minutes.  Also (as with all senchas), don't use boiling water, ideally no more than 190 degrees F.  And after doing all that, I get tea that I can tolerate.<br /><br />So what's my bottom line?  I won't be buying this again because the cost savings are undermined because I have to use 3 times as much to get only a reasonable tasting drink.

review/summary: Caveat Emptor!  Producer Integrity Issues
review/text: This WAS a great everyday coffee until Green Mountain, K-cup/Keurig patentholder and producer, started playing games with it.  They substituted an IMO inferior (cheaper) blend and changed the description to a light roast from medium roast.  They also changed the color of the K-cup to light green from orange and freely substituted this tasteless wastewater as the real caribou blend that I have enjoyed for many years.  My supplier agreed and gave me a full refund.  Not surprisingly, Caribou (Green Mountain) refused to respond to my requests for an explanation. They are currently being investigated by the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission for accounting "irregularities".  GM, of course, publicly blames their quality and delivery problems on their suppliers. How convenient.  In the meantime, "shortages" of GM K-cups appeared that drove up prices and profitability even though Green Mountains inventories were twice the level of the prior year.  Holding the patent and copyrights for K-Cups allows lots of liberties since the competition and prices are controlled by GM.  You may remember the Hot Cocoa shortage last year and the half-caff (their most popular) shortage this year.  But Greed is Good at Green Mountain.  Profits are up a whopping 97% and the CEO is probably, no, certainly wallowing in cash bonuses.  I bought some EZ-Cups from Amazon and make my own k-cup compatibles now with quality ground coffee.  They are indistinguishable from Green Mountain's in flavor and you'll save 80% of the cost.  Don't confuse EZ-cups with the gadget that Keurig (Green Mountain) sells. I refuse to give one more nickel to a company that ruthlessly exploits its customers in the name of profit.  Use the EZ-cups and stick it to these SOBs.

review/summary: Truly Disappointing. Product changed. Not for the better!
review/text: We have been buying Caribou Blend K-cups for a couple of years. It is a fine medium blend that we, and everyone that we have served it to, loves. We usually order it in larger quantities to try and save some money since we go through it fairly quickly. The last order we placed for 2 x 80 boxes was fulfilled with the K-cups with green color labels (the older labels were orange around the edges). The taste of this new k-cup can only be described as vile and has nothing to do with the former product. It is not drinkable. We have written to Caribou and have been waiting for a response, but nothing yet (I will update if I hear anything). DO NOT BUY this product if you have used the older product with he orange color on the label and liked it. You will not get the same thing and this coffee is truly terrible!<br /><br />Deserves 0 Stars...<br /><br />Update - a note from Caribou Corporate:<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to contact us.<br /><br />We certainly apologize for any confusion. Recently the packaging for Caribou Blend K Cups did change. Previously the regular blend had an orange band and the decaf had a green band. The new labels the regular is a green band and the decaf is an orange band.<br /><br />The coffee itself has not changed, simply the label. There are two factors that might be involved in the change you taste. The change in taste is affected by the time that has lapsed between roasting the coffee beans and brewing them...freshness. Also, coffee is an agricultural crop that varies with weather and other environmental factors. Our Roastmasters put in a lot of time and attention to provide a consistency when roasting the coffee beans.<br /><br />We do apologize for any confusion and please let us know if there is anything else we can do for you.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Linda<br /><br />Caribou Coffee Customer Relations<br /><br />The coffee is Dramatically different, but they will not admit to the change. Oh, well. Goodbye Caribou Coffee.

review/summary: I love Caribou for K Cups
review/text: If you like very strong coffee- this probably is not the coffee for you. But if you like a medium to lighter roast this will hit the spot. I love this coffee and I buy it in bulk. Personally I think it's better than Newman's or even Starbucks (at least the Verona). Caribou is not bitter but has a milder almost fruity kindof taste. Everyone has their preferences on coffee, this one is mine. It's a staple in my home and I love being able to brew it in less than a minute in a k cup. It's great with flavored syrups, just plain, or as an iced drink. For me this hits the spot.

review/summary: Good buy - Great product.
review/text: I love Eden Organic products - I will not buy any other canned product AT ALL. I recommend that anyone interested buy them at amazons price - you won't find a better one. There isn't much one can say about red beans. But I can tell you that this is a high quality product that you can feel good (and safe) about eating and feeding to your family. If we start buying more of these products, we will see a greater variety offered, lower prices and maybe other (not safe) brands will take notice and follow Eden's practices when it comes to canning their food safely. Eden is the only one on the market that can truly claim to be safe. Even other organic brand canned foods are tainted by their poisonous cans. You're wasting your money there. Go Eden and you can sleep soundly at night.

review/text: This Campbell's Chicken Corn Chowder was on sale a few years ago, so I tried it.  I had never had a soup like this at all, so I was skeptical.  This is rich, creamy, and very delicious.  It is ready to heat and serve without adding water or milk.  For taking along to work, you can just pour it into a microwave safe container, heat it for about 2-3 minutes and it's ready.  This and the Chicken & Dumpling are both very rich and very nice to keep on hand for a quick soup anytime.  Even my kids like them and they don't like soups very much.  Eight thumbs up from our house!

They had little jars filled with olive size pink salt and you pour the oil over them, close the lid when not in use. I thought I could do that myself. I found these on Amazon, just what I was looking for. Perfect size and price.  The salt does not influence the fragrance of the oils at all, the perfect diffuser. I even will smash some with a hammer for my salt grinder. Spice Lab shipped it out quickly, very happy with the product and Spice Lab.

Just finished the last carefully hoarded tray tonight, and signed up with Amazon to be notified if they are stocked.  Now I'm out, and VERY VERY SAD, because these noodles are FABULOUS.<br /><br />It's unbelievable, and in all honesty I can't imagine how Maruchan does it.  No butter or milk added, made in a microwave, and they're the best cheesy pasta product you can buy!?  How??  Yet, it's totally true.  Puts anything from Kraft or Velveeta to shame.  Great flavor, great texture, and so easy!  My only complaint might be that one tray is really more food than one person ought to be eating... and yet, it's hard to share. :)<br /><br />If someday soon Amazon does carry these, I highly recommend trying them.  Just leave me some too, k?

But it doesn't taste like other microwavable mac-&-cheese.  It's delicious, and about the same price as other brands.  The noodles themselves are very nice, and the sauce is cheesy and creamy.  There is plenty of room in the container to add frozen broccoli before heating--same cooking time.  The package contains a *lot* of noodles & sauce, for a total of 560 calories.  I got them for a starving student, so this size is perfect for him, but it would be nice if they were also offered in a smaller size.

review/summary: Tastes better than the cup o noodles
review/text: So my wife gets the biggest laugh when I order food from Amazon. However then she trys it and understands why I don't want the .25 cup o noodles. I like fast easy stuff like this for grab and goes at work. It also nice to keep a couple in my drawer at work for that random long day when I can't get out for food or have eaten the little food I brought with me. I do the subscribe and save and that makes these just a bit over a dollar. But hey .90 gets me a cup o noodles out of the vending machine and this is twice as much food. Think of this one as Ramen Mac and Cheese. Now who doesn't like mac and cheese? I know I do and this is a very good one for a quick meal. As others have said there is even room to throw a can of tuna or something in it after it is done cooking. So go ahead and splurge on a good ramen noodle meal. Pick up some of these.

I have tried several flavors of these noodle trays and they are all great. They come with the ubiquitous noodle brick and flavor packets. Just fill the tray to the line with water, add the noodles and microwave covered for 4 minuts then add the flavoring and let set for a couple of minutes. No soup, just great tasting noodles in a thick, flavorful sauce.

review/summary: Not the best
review/text: Before I delve any further into my review, I would like to inform you that I am not picky when it comes to my instant noodles. In fact, I have eaten many varieties spanning all across the globe that have been met with looks of disgust and bewilderment from my peers. So given my extremely high fondness (and tolerance) for some pretty wacky varieties of instant noodles, it almost pains me to give this product a poor review.<br /><br />I wanted to like it. I really did. As a HUGE macaroni and cheese and ramen noodle aficionado, I figured there really could be nothing better than coalescing two of my favorite foods in the world into one convenient packaged hunk of noodles and cheese sauce.<br /><br />The first time I ate it, the powder in the packet did not mesh well with the noodles at all despite me following all the cooking directions and thoroughly stirring the flavor packet into the noodles. The ensuing cheese sauce was clumpy and poorly distributed, so I got this rich cheese flavor from about 1/2 the noodles and the other half just tasted like plain ramen. Also, I noticed that immediately after finishing the meal, my stomach got pretty angry at me and continued to remain angry for the next several hours. The flavor packet has potential, but it's just too overbearing and strong right now.<br /><br />I thought that this was all a fluke, so I decided to give the noodles another chance tonight. Nope. Exact same result.... once more the sauce did not distribute well amongst the noodles, and my stomach is cursing me for feeding me this monstrosity yet again.<br /><br />So sadly, Maruchan Yakisoba cheddar cheese and I are no longer friends. I've tried the Nissin version of this product, and it's much, much better. From now on, when I'm itching to get my cheddar cheese/ramen fix, I'll pick up that one instead.

review/text: for what it is_ an instant noodle product- it's pretty decent. I like to add food stuffs to these cheese noodles to make it more a meal and to add taste. i've thrown in veggies. i've thrown in canned chicken. most recently i added cream of broccoli condensed soup 1/2 of small can_ so it would be a broc/chz/creamy/noodle concoction- and it was really good that way. So if you can get these at $1 or less a package. the small can of condensed cream of broccoli soup is also less than $1 and you only use 1/2 a can- add more if you like i suppose_ and you have a very tasty and filling, hot meal- you cook and eat out of the same disposable, microwave container_ the only thing to wash is a fork.<br />long shelf life for emergency kits or for extra food during winter months-incase of storm- or food to leave at your vacation cabins/trailers. great to send to college students-all they need is a small microwave and a fork to cook/eat this. cooks in 4 minutes.<br />It is the best of the dry noodle product foods that i've ever eaten- if that helps you.<br />-also good to donate to your local food banks. senior centers. keep in desk at work incase you miss lunch or work late. shelf stabile, doesn't need refrigeration, long shelf life. lots of benefits. hope this helps you- it's as honest as i can offer

review/text: OK, so let's first address the fiction that one package is two servings -- really?  Come on.  So double all those nutritional numbers and you get 240 calories, 28g of fat (44% dv), 1020mg sodium (42%)66g carbs, 10g protein, and so on.  OK, so no one really expected this to be health food, right?  I wouldn't eat these every day, myself.  But OK for a quick lunch now and then.  Ok, so that's said.<br /><br />The noodles are good, very tasty.  The cheese flavor packet is adequate, if not special.  At the current subscribe and save price with free shipping, these are a good, cheap, quick lunch.  Preparation is easy (just add water and microwave), add cheese powder and stir.  I did get some boil over, so you may need to experiment with the time and your microwave to avoid that.<br /><br />You might add some steamed broccoli or other vegetables to improve this. It's pretty much what you expect and a fair value.

And I ended up in the bathroom - do not think I need to explain further! The taste was bland but not obnoxious!

review/summary: Yummy
review/text: I just discovered these a few weeks ago, and love them. I don't know about eating them in a salad, mostly because I gobble them up straight outta the bag, they never last long. They taste like a healthy cheeto, if that makes sense. Slightly salty, crispy, with a nice delicate flavor similar to puffed rice.

review/text: Oh my, are these delicious! One bite is definitely not enough. If that could be a problem for you, stay away. Otherwise, don't pass these up, they are that good. Light, salty, crispy...mmmmmmm...

review/summary: my son's favorite snack
review/text: These are the best. I have gotten everyone I know to try these and they're all hooked, adults and children alike. I found these a couple years ago at Trader Joe's when I was looking for a healthy snack for my toddler and we all just loved them. Luckily, our local supermarket started stocking these so we always have them in stock at home. I bought these at Amazon with the subscribe and save option and got them a good bit cheaper than I can anywhere else. These are a great way to sneak veggies into your child's diet. The best way I can describe them is that they are similar in texture to cheese puffs, and even though they are only salted they have lots of flavor.

review/summary: Tasty snack
review/text: We tend to eat these straight and/or with hummus as a chip substitute. I've noticed some variation between packages in the texture of the crisps. I prefer them when they're a bit firmer, but they're still nice even when they're softer than I would like.

review/summary: Very Tasty
review/text: I love these tasty snacks.  They have a great crunch and just the right amount of salt.  I am not sure I would call these a "health food" because of the fat content, but they are really good tasting, and I will be ordering again.

review/summary: I like 'em
review/text: They are salty (but not too much so) and crunchy and have a sufficient amount of nutrition. I don't waste them on salads--just eat them right out of the bag. They shipped quickly and had a good expiration date from Amazon.
