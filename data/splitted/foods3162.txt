review/summary: Flavor is okay
review/text: With the chocolate and vanilla stevia, I like to make a non-caffeinated hot beverage.  Stevita brand is almost as tasty as Sweetleaf brand, which I had used previously.  The vanilla is a little more vanilla-y than the chocolate is chocolate-y.  I am just not sure, in the long run, whether Stevita's plastic bottle has/will have an effect on the flavor; Sweetleaf is in a glass bottle.

review/summary: Chocolate flavor just as good as Sweetleaf
review/text: It's so hard to adjust from putting Splenda and Hershey's syrup in my morning coffee, but this is a good alternative.  Like the Sweetleaf brand which is a little more costly, it's taking awhile to get the balance between enough chocolate flavor and too much sweetness from the stevia.  Still, it's more healthy than what I was using prior to this, so 4 stars from me.

It seems Bob's Red Mill is one of the few brands that touts the absence of this metal in it's product. I can attest this does it's job well as sodium bicarbonate, and I recommend the use of this over less costly products from a health conscious stand point. Your health is something to revere, no?

review/summary: Bob's Red Mill Baking Soda 16-Ounce (Pack of 4)
review/text: Two of the bags were leaking baking soda when I opened the box, but it was a very small amount.  The thin plastic bag packaging could be improved upon.  I transferred the baking soda from those two bags into a glass Ball Jar.<br /><br />The quality of the Baking soda is very good.  It is a much finer grain, than regular Arm & Hammer baking Soda, so it is great for using in the homemade toothpaste I make using baking soda and coconut oil.  I give the quality of the baking soda 5 stars.

review/summary: Great deal and packaged well
review/text: Just got the item today and wanted to say that despite my concerns based on reviews the packaging was fine and the items arrived without any spills or package breakage. There may be variations on the way this is shipped, my order arrived in a box with cushioned air pads - but I have noticed that Amazon can be inconsistent, particularly the warehouse in the packaging. I think I know why some arrive with leaks in the bags - the larger Bob's Red Mill box that the baking soda bags come in is the standard size that the grains come in but the bags are usually larger - so the product manufacturer may need to make some adjustment as I can see how the smaller bags could knock around inside the box and cause damage. Bob's could improve it by putting the bags of baking soda into a snugger fitting shipping box - would save them a lot on refunds and returns I'm sure! Mine were fine like I said and when I opened one of the bags the plastic seemed sturdy so maybe they have worked on the packaging issue.<br /><br />As for quality I just now tried it as an alkalizer with lemon juice & water. Not exactly tasty but the baking soda is much finer than arm & hammer & I trust in the quality of Bob's Red Mill so I am not worried about aluminum or other toxins in this product. I'll use it for cooking as well and other personal use but will probably get the cheap stuff for the fridge or other household uses of baking soda. However this is a great price & the 4 bags will last me a looooong time for their intended uses so I am very satisfied with the purchase.

review/summary: Poor Red Mill packaging - product works fine
review/text: Recently received this product in the mail and while the packaging itself looked fine (Amazon box and inner Red Mill box were OK), when I opened the Red Mill box containing the 4 plastic pouches of baking soda, 3 out of the 4 had cuts on the top of the pouches and were all leaking baking soda everywhere.  Terrible packaging by the company and a really flimsy plastic clearly not acceptable for housing a powdered substance that could be shipped.  Luckily Amazon handled it well and are sending me a replacement.  Hoping the replacement actually has more than 1 sealed pouch.<br /><br />In terms of the product, it works fine - it's baking soda.

review/text: YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY! Doesnt matter if you're allergen-free or not, the Cravings Place mixes make the most DELICIOUS foods you'll ever have. AND they're the EASIEST to make - much easier than the "regular" stuff, AND they DONT require to make ANY SUBSTITUTIONS.  What other mixes or recipes are you going to find ANYWHERE that only require oil & water, and wha-lah, you have pancakes, muffins, cookies, brownies... etc etc etc that are delicious & everyone will love.  A few of the mixes require some kind of shortening - we use the organic palm shortening, but there are a number of types you could use that would work.<br /><br />I have not had a single "failure" or even a "mediocre" result with these - and that's saying something when you consider I've had YEARS of experience ruining food, even before I went allergen-free.  My elementary-school child has become a master baker because of these mixes.<br /><br />As a previous reviewer mentioned, many other products marketed as "dairy-free" or "egg-free" or whatever, REQUIRE you to add those very things when mixing it up - and the substitutions they offer never come out the same. The Cravings Place mixes are DESIGNED not to need those things, so they come out EXACTLY the way they were meant to - EVERY TIME.<br /><br />Try it, you'll like it, you WONT be sorry!

Not only that, but they are dairy free and egg free as well, AND no artificial anything or overly processed ingredients.  Another BIG PLUS is that while so many "allergen free" mixes require you to then add the very allergens that you are trying to avoid to make the mix work properly, The Cravings Place mixes generally only require water and perhaps oil or dairy free margarine to get delicious baked goods.<br /><br />I cannot recommend them enough. Delicious, healthy, natural, easy, quick and allergen free from bag to table! (-:

It's a little expensive (over a $1 a k-cup once you add shipping) but worth it.<br /><br />My ONLY problem with this seller is they didn't send me one of the flavors I wanted and sent me ones that I didn't ask for in replace...I have contacted them twice already about it, they send they will send the right ones out but that never happened. Because they are a little more expensive it makes me a little upset I am stuck with 3 kcups of a flavor I didn't ask for (and probably won't ever drink) instead of the flavor I really wanted.  Otherwise a nice seller to work with and really fast shipping.

From that perspective you might actually be saving money by not wasting product.  I'll definitely get this sampler again!

Well I emailed right back and just said to surprise me. I only received 29 K-cups out of supposedly a 31 count. HaHa, the surprise is certainly on me as I didn't receive either.  This is a way to try an array of selections without buying cases and finding the brews that you will be happy to settle into.

While I found a few favorites right off with recommendations found on Amazon reviews (Coffee People Wake Up Call & Jet Fuel) - my husband did not.  That was remedied at home with a My K-cup & cuban espresso.  Unfortunately at his new job you can't use the my k-cup with the "commercial" Keurig setup.<br /><br />It's expensive to buy 12-20 k-cups at a pop only to not like them.  What we needed was a way to get a lot of different ones for him to try.  While this isn't an inexpensive option - it's a heck of a lot cheaper than buying 30 different boxes (at $10-$15) a pop.<br /><br />I ordered 30 different k-cups - and I got exactly what I ordered in 2 business days.  Now my fingers are crossed that hubby finds something suitable!<br /><br />Kudo's to the vendor for filling this need!

review/summary: The Choice is Yours
review/text: As an owner of a new Keurig, I wanted to sample a lot of coffee types and flavors before "settling down". Most of the assortments I looked at on Amazon had quite a few critical comments about the assortments being limited, misleading or just plain past their expiration date. Then I saw this one--I got to choose all my varieties, they came quickly, and correctly--and so far I've been enjoying experimenting. It's well worth doing so as the various coffees are very different. There are some I like, and some I don't so I'm happy to pay a bit more for these samplers--to avoid having to use up a box of a type of coffee I may not enjoy.<br /><br />One important note: make sure you send the email specifying your choices promptly after ordering. I used the communicate with merchant feature to do this. It wasn't obvious in the ordering process.

review/text: Just received a Keurig coffeemaker for my birthday and wanted to try some different flavors.  I thought I would have to buy bigger packages of all one flavor and hoped I would like them.  Found this on Amazon and what a great way to try flavors.  I now know which ones to buy and which ones to pass on.  The company was very prompt in getting the product to me.  I had picked a few flavors they didn't have and they promptly messaged me and I was able to pick something else.  Package arrived within a week of putting in order.  I would definitely order from them again.

review/summary: GENIUS!
review/text: I've always wondered WHY somebody wouldn't do EXACTLY what these guys did! At first glance $1+/cup seems pricey but, when I consider that sampling will spare me the expense of buying an entire $10 box of a single coffee that I deem undrinkable, the bottom line savings is immeasurable!  Lets face it, coffee roasts are NOT one size fits all, with varying degrees of boldness and flavor, I recommend ordering at least TWO of any given coffee so that you can experiment with brew sizes.  CoffeeMix shipped my order quickly and it arrived just as ordered with a personal note of "Thanks".

review/text: The product was promptly shipped upon receiving my selection.  The package arrived a few days later and all of the k-cups I requested were in the package.  A great option for trying different flavors.  I didn't like the selection of all of the other prepackaged sample packs, so this was a great alternative.  This time, I ordered all flavored coffees, next time I will try the traditional coffees.

review/text: I was excited to place my order in hopes of getting exactly what I ordered, however I received 29 k-kups rather than the advertised 30 k-kups.  This was disappointing as the missing k-kup was a hot chocolate for when my niece comes to visit.  Other than that, the other 29 k-kups were exactly as ordered and within 4-5 months of expiration.  Delivery was pretty quick (5 mail days) considering it was shipped from East Coast to West Coast.

review/text: My husband is a coffee explorer, and I have been purchasing him the K-cup coffee sampler mixes I could find.  The problem is that we always get several of the same kinds, and each pack gets several repeats.  This was the best purchase I have made for him.  I selected flavors I knew he'd like, and he was very excited to have flavors he hadn't seen yet.  Thank you for making this option available!  I will definitely be purchasing from you again!

review/text: I have used Artemis food for over a 6 month period and couldn't be happier.  It has been the best food for both of my pups (one being a Shih Tzu who has a sensitive stomach).  Other premium foods kept irritating her large intestines which caused me numerous vet bills.  I have had dogs for the last 25 years and have always researched and bought premium dog food; however, Artemis Fresh Mix Small Breed Adult Formula is by far the best.  It may costs a little more, but has saved me dollars in vet bills.  I would recommend spending the few extra dollars for peace of mind in knowing you are feeding your loved ones a quality food without all the fillers that are in other foods.

review/text: I've been feeding my small dog this food for 4ish years now, only switching to something else when I haven't been able to find this brand. I always want to switch back immediately - I won't get too graphic, but in the words of the dog trainer who recommended this food to me initially, "it will make your dog's poop bounce!"  Definitely a plus for any owner of a pup with a sensitive stomach.  I add a little bit of plain canned pumpkin to her food, and I've almost completely eliminated her stomach problems.  Highly recommended!

review/text: I am kind of obsessed with my little shih tzu and spent days researching dog food reviews, content etc. This product stands out to be one of the best products available for dogs. I do combine this with another dog food (Orijen - but because of its high protein content my dog can't tolerate a full meal of it on its own), but Artemis is my dogs staple diet for the past year or more since its high quality, solid content, and it agrees with him.<br /><br />If you want only the best for your dog, then this is it.

review/summary: Well tolerated and appreciated
review/text: My dog is also doing very well on this food, despite her tempermental stomach, and seemed to adjust to it almost instantly, without the usual intestinal issues that go along with changing foods. I'm using this food, some supplemental homemade food, several supplements from VetriScience, and cranberry, which controls her tendency toward bladder infections (every time I run out of it and she's off the cranberry for a while, the problems come back). I chose this food mainly because of my discovery, during my previous dog's struggle with cancer, that there is a preservative called ethoxyquin used in most dog food fish meal that is known cause cancer. Artemis is supposedly one of the few foods that doesn't use this. I am willing to pay extra to ensure that my dog lives as long and healthy a life as possible. Right now she is brimming with energy and attitude, as a proper terrier should be, and I presume this food has had a role in making this possible.

review/text: I've been drinking Zevia for several years. Ginger-ale is my favorite, and the Ginger Root beer is pretty good. Most of the flavors, though, are just too sweet and too strongly flavored. I remedy this by filling a glassful of ice with half a glass of Perrier and topping it off with Zevia. I do not like any of the colas, but they might be good if you didn't grow up drinking Coke. These fruity pack drinks are not very natural tasting; I had high hopes for the Strawberry, but it not a true strawberry taste; the black cherry is so strong it's hardly drinkable, but I can't have sugar or regular soft drinks, so I'm just happy there's something to drink for a little treat in the afternoons. Note to Zevia makers: Please offer some drinks that are about half as sweet and flavored. They'll taste more like grown-up beverages.

review/summary: Good option
review/text: Keep in mind when trying this product that any new sweetener takes some time to get used to it, especially in a high fructose world. Remember the sweetener in this pop is actually good for you. Right now I am having chemo treatments. This fruity pop feels pretty good in my mouth. It is very sweet sometimes I have to mix it with fizz water. My three year old granddaughter has digestive issues and stievia is something she can have so, I took some over and she loves it. Strawbery is my favorite. This four flavor pack is a great way to try orange, black cherry, grape and strawberry. There is also a variety pack of 12 flavors. Try that before getting a whole case of something. I found all the colas to be quite nasty and the Dr Z did not live up to it's 5 stars. I would give it a three.The ginger root beer is also good. Make sure, whatever flavor, that it is VERY cold: chill it over night and ice it. I am getting all my family and friends to try Zevia soda. It is great that this company has given us pop that is actally good for us.

review/text: This is great for your health.<br />Animal studies have shown how the lingonberry can lower inflammatory molecules, block oxidants from destroying tissue, and also help the body replace important antioxidants, like glutathione, which is a master antioxidant in our body. Lingonberry has also been shown to increase red blood cell and liver enzymes needed for antioxidant protection. We need antioxidants to protect vessels and nerve tissue, and also to help decrease the damage from inflammation. Proanthocyanidin extracts from lingonberries were also found to be effective against the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, which can cause a wide variety of infections.

review/text: I bought these to make cake pops. I decided at the last minute I wanted to make cake pops for a Christmas Eve party, I live in a small town & there is only one store. The store was completely out of any chocolate coatings. Luckily, I was able to order these from Amazon, with overnight shipping. The chocolate was good, it worked wonderfully, but it was quite expensive for what it is.

review/text: First off let me say this is a great product.  Real tasty.  However in the product description they say it is a 6 pack.  It is not.  The price is for one pack.  At 4.25 apiece this is an extremely high price.  They cost 1.75 at the store.  If you can't find them ask a friend to mail you some.<br /> After emailing the seller she offered to sell me the items at a good price.  She indicated that she would fix the description of the items.  Very prompt response.  I will use her again.

review/text: This item came so fast, almost next day.  Part of the reason is probably because it was shipped from one state over.  The coffee was good. I was given a Hamilton Beach one-cup that they say to use with Senseo pods only. Nasty coffee and you have to use two pods to get any flavor.  Skeptical, I said I would try the Java not sure pods would fit.  Excellent choice, Good fit and Good Coffee.

review/summary: Best Dog Treats Available
review/text: As a life-long pet caregiver, I have preached and practiced one of four rules for having and protecting animals: always feed animals the very best in nutrition that you can afford. The other three rules are: annual veterinary check-ups (semi-annual for senior pets), regular grooming, and frequent personal affection.<br /><br />After extensive researching of available high-end treats for my senior Cavalier King Charles spaniel Rennea, we (my dog and I) have selected Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance all-natural wheat-free/gluten-free Healthy Bones For Small Dogs as her exclusive dog treat. This very affordable exceptional product is now available in several flavors, though Rennea's favorite is the Turkey Oatmeal Cranberry treat. I unconditionally recommend this product for any dog who prefers (and demands) the very best treat for nutritional value from all natural limited ingredients and for taste that will keep any dog begging for more. Thanks to Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance and to Amazon.com for making this product available.

review/text: My parents were having issues getting their Yorkie to eat Wellness dry and so was I with my Yorkie. They would eventually eat, but it was dragging down their routines. According to the Whole Dog Journal, Wellness Canned Dog Food Chicken and Sweet Potato Recipe is a great food for your dog. The article stressed how gone are the days where wet food was worse for a dog than dry. As long as it's a good, quality food, the wet is actually better for dogs than the dry. I mix the wet with the dry and our Yorkies lap it down quick. I can also hide my Yorkie's morning pill with it and she doesn't realize she's taking her medicine.

review/summary: Used This for a Starved Rescue Hound
review/text: I have been involved in dog rescue for many years. I recently took in a very large hound who had been starved within an inch of his life. The vet recommended this (in addition to many other treatments and holistic measures, including yogurt!) to try to quickly get some weight on and good nutrition into the dog. You'd think a starving dog would eat anything, but often times they will not. I had to bake this hound homemade meatloaf for a month. Wellness and Nutro canned were the only "dog foods" I could get him to eat. But he did gain weight steadily, was able to wean off 'human food', and did very well.  After gaining 20 lbs, he was adopted by a wonderful family. When you need the best, any of the Wellness Brands I would highly recommend.

review/summary: Feed my two dogs only Wellness brand. Consistently on top ten canned dog food lists
review/text: Had my big noble boy dog, who had been with me for ten years, die of Cancer recently. He was a animal shelter rescue (As all my pets have been, and are.), and a great creature who never wanted to ever show weakness. By the time he did show weakness, the Cancer was far too advanced to operate on or save him and he died within a month.<br /><br />That set me to feeding my two dogs (His mate who is still with me, and her new mate) ONLY quality dog food. It costs more; but after seeing what was in the average store dog food on internet posts, and confirmed on dog food cans labels, that convinced me to try something better.<br /><br />I researched the net for the top ten dog foods, and this brand kept coming up in the lists consistently; including Veterinary sites. Made only with grain free quality ingredients,and otehr healthy additions for good digestion, my two dogs eat it enthusiastically, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Both dogs are fed Wellness brand "Beef Stew" and Wellness brand "Lamb and Beef Stew", alternating for variety in their diets; they love both equally, and both canned foods are equally healthy.

review/summary: This is the ONLY food my dog will eat
review/text: I have had my chihuahua since he was a puppy, and he never had much of an appetite. I tried all varieties of dry and canned dog food and he would barely sniff them. He was underweight as a result and his coat looked terrible. I was so glad to discover this dog food. It is the only thing he will eat! Since I began feeding him lamb he has gained a whole pound and his coat is thicker and longer. He also eats the Wellness dry. I really cannot say enough good things about this brand of dog food. It also works for my other chihuahua who has a huge appetite but severe food allergies.<br /><br />If nothing else has worked, give this a try! You may be surprised by how much your dog loves it.

review/text: My dog is now older so she is not happy having to take so many pills. I switched from the more solid Wellness (which is still pretty good) to the stew line since thanks to the thick gravy I no longer have to use most of the can to hide medication. I agree with some of the reviews that my dogs stools were a little on the runny side but figuring out that it was due to whitefish and not of the food itself I just stopped buying the ones with whitefish listed and she has yet to have the same side effect. So take that into account with your pet it could be something listed that was not apart of your dog food before.

review/text: I like the fact that Wellness offers grain free all meat canned and limited ingredient allergy dry food. Unfortunately my old dog has serious skin issues that Wellness also did not seem to correct so I have decided to take him off commercial foods completely and he now eats only organic human grade freeze dried artisan dog food. Wellness dog food is probably one of the better choices if you feed your dog commercial foods so I recommend this product over other cheaper commercial brand names. Amazon prices are the best and shipping to Maui excellent.

I just mix the entire can up gel and all and put it in a small tupperware container. I put left overs in the fridge. My extremely picky girl had her nose in the can while I was trying to scoop the food out. She licked her bowl clean. So happy I found this stuff. Also it actually smells good. I didn't think it smelled at all. My girl is allergic to chicken so I was very happy to find wellness made several flavors without any chicken and grain free. Highly recommend this dog food.
