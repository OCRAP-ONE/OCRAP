review/summary: half inedible
review/text: We love these fruit rolls.  I grew up eating them and now my daughter loves them.  I think they're the best "fruit snack" option on the market!  However, half of the box I just purchased arrived inedible...the consistency is all wrong and I've had to throw them out.  I'm very disappointed...not sure if it's the product or something that happened during shipping. I guess I have to stick with buying them in the store.

review/text: These are just like the ones I had as a kid growing up in Brooklyn because they are the same!  The apricot taste so good....but my favorite is sour apple, uhm...make that cherry.  Stretch Island and all the rest have their own unique taste, but nothing taste as good as Jorays.  We are addicted.

review/summary: Worst "fruit" roll ever!
review/text: I miss read the brand, thinking this was the Jovey fruit rolls I got as a kid. This is NOT anything remotely similar. The texture is that of plastic and it has so much food coloring it is neon orange. What a disaster of an order. It makes fruit by the yard look like health food.

review/summary: This is the worst of any fruit rollup I have ever tasted
review/text: I had been buying Stretch Island apricot fruit rollups, and they have quite a pleasing taste.  When I came across Joray, I decided to give it a try, hoping for an even better taste experience.  What a disappointment this was!!<br /><br />-- The apricot taste is barely discernable.  In fact this is not even remotely what true apricot tastes. This is more like a lousy candy taste than a real fruit taste.<br /><br />-- The "thing" leaves a horrible aftertaste in your mouth...the kind that you would want to brush your teeth after and gargle with Listerin mouthwash.<br /><br />-- The "thing" is packed with yellow and red food colorings, which gives it a fake look that does not remotely resemble what true apricot color is.<br /><br />-- As if that wasn't enough, the ingredients include flour and corn syrup solids.  How is that for a healthy concoction?<br /><br />-- The $29.59 I spent is a total waste. Now I know why no local retailers carry this thing. If any did, I would have bought one serving for testing ... not all 48 servings.

review/text: I've been hooked on these for over 50 years.  I remember when they sold them at candy stands in the subway.  Now I've noticed the sweet and sour notes vary from time to time, but for the most part their taste hasn't changed much.  Hope you like them as much as I do.  They're better than candy!

review/text: I was so looking forward to these thinking they were going to be like the roll ups I had when I was a kid.  These are terrible.  They taste like flour and pumpkin with gritty bits in it. Does not taste like apricot at all and is a bright orange in color. Nothing at all like a natural fruit roll up.  Don't waste your money on these get the stretch island fruit leather instead.  They taste so much better, like actual fruit.

review/summary: This is my new favorite gum!!
review/text: A few months ago I discovered Mentos gum, and loved the way the gum had a very long lasting chewability.  The first flavors I tried were Watermelon and Red Fruit.  After some online searching I found that there were a number of different flavors, so I ordered some of each flavor so I could have my own little taste test.  After all of the sampling, Sweet Mint emerged as my absolute favorite.  It has just a little bit of a mint bite, and proved to be very enjoyable.  A lot of the mint gums just completely overpower you when you start chewing on them.  I now order the Sweet Mint flavor by the box, so I can always have a good supply on hand.  Watermelon anod Red Fruit are still on hand, too - just not in the quantity!

review/summary: Better than corn-based food
review/text: I can't affod the really expensive healthy dog foods, and I hate buying corn based by-product food that is advertised on TV. (By-product means anything they can get their hands on such as other euthanized animals.) I got Nutrish last month because the two main ingredients are meat. It's not super high quality, but I'm poor so it's what I got. Since my dog has been eating it, she sheds less, farts less, and has fewer stools. It even smells better than regular dog food. So far, I'm impressed.

She gets excited to eat, and never has gas anymore. Plus, meat is the #1 ingredient, and there are no meat by-products. I recommend it to anyone.

review/summary: If you love your dog, DON'T feed them this!
review/text: I was hoping that mega-bucks Racael Ray would put out a better dog food then this. Out of the first 10 ingredients, five are terrible and should not be fed to a dog that you love. Chicken Meal,Corn Meal,Soybean Meal,Corn Gluten Meal,Dried Beet Pulp-research these products for yourself, they are the top 5 items that cause allergies and food intolerance in animals among other things-that is 50% of the first ten items.<br />I expected better from Racael Ray! On the plus side however, her "Just 6" treats is one of BEST products out there, so I know she has the knowledge to make heathy foods for pets, just not willing to part with her money in her dog food line. My dogs LOVE the Just 6 treats and because they are super good for them I do not mind feeding them the treats but not the food.

review/summary: Poison for dogs
review/text: If you want your dog to have yeast infections and allergies, go ahead and buy this crap. I got a new dog about 3 weeks ago and was told she doesn't have allergies at all, her fur was full, skin intact, no redness was apparent when I got her and her feet/paws looked good. The only reason I bought this food (not on Amazon) was because my other dog's stool was looking pretty good on Rachel Ray's Just 6 diet and I purchased in error because I thought it was the same thing. But I looked more closely at the ingredients later on and realized there are many more fillers and now even his ears started getting stinky in the last 2 weeks.  With the new girl, I was steadily switching over her from Science Diet to this poison, I was realizing she seemed more and more itchy and there was a lot of redness and smelly feet. After getting some advice from other dog owners I decided to go cold turkey and switch to Natural Balance LID for the girl and within 4 days of switching foods, itchiness has subsided and feet are less red, inflamed, and stinky. As far as my boy, he is now on a combo of Newman's regular and Wellness grain free, and he loves it and stool looks great. All I can say is invest in your dog's diet, read the reviews of the popular brands, and there will probably a lot less trips to the vet which means a happier dog and savings. It makes me so angry that there are so many bad dog foods out there! I will also be supplementing their food with an oil too as I have read many great reviews about that too and how it improves their health.

review/summary: My Dog Loves It
review/text: I realize that this product doesn't live up to it's name of being truly 'nutrish' (nutritional), but I've tried other 'healthier' dry dog foods. My sleddogs won't touch other dry dog foods that are supposedly healthier and better for them. But when I recieved a sample of this food and tested it on my pickiest eater- Coho, she gobbled it up. She ate every little last peice, which was extremely surprising. Most of the time she wants nothing to do with dry dog foods unless I add some salmon, lynx, or beaver meat- but this stuff was evidentally ideal for her tastebuds. I wasn't thrilled with the ingrediants but I'm happy I found something my dogs will at least eat.Of course I substitute it with fresh meat 100% of the time, but this is a nice additive to soften their stomache after oily salmon and beaver.

review/summary: Fairly average food.
review/text: I was very excited to have my dogs switch to this food. My sister highly recomended it too me after she did a bunch of research on what dog foods are good for dogs. I like how the first and most ingredient is meat, not corn (we all know corn has no nutritional value and is intigestible to pets and humans).<br />I've been using it for a couple of weeks and my big Lab seems to not like it at all :( He sometimes will go all day without touching it and finally gets so hungry he gives in. I am not sure if this is due to the transition from switching over from Beneful, or if he just doesn't like it. The beneful is now all gone and they are just eating straight Nutrish, so hopefully things will start getting better. I will have to report later after using Nutrish for a while.<br /><br />Update:  It's been about 2 months now and the big lab seems to have adjusted well to this food, BUT he has lost a lot of weight and I can see his ribs. He was not an overweight dog to begin with so the weight loss worries me since there is no medical reason for it. My springerdor puppy is 6 months and loves this food, BUT has the worst gas. I do not allow my dogs to eat human food, so the only thing that would cause the gas is this food. It is a good healthy food, but isn't particularly special except for the main ingredients.<br /><br />I DO NOT RECOMEND purchasing this food from Amazon though, because the prices are absolutely rediculous, I can buy a 28 lb bag from walmart.com for $26 and only pay $3 shipping. (I am not saying Amazon is bad and Walmart is good, but in this case the vendors are trying to cash in on Rachel Ray's name).

review/summary: Fantastic Low Carb Pasta! Highly Recommended
review/text: This great tasting pasta is a diabetic's Godsend! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for ways to reduce my carb intake. Up till now that has meant avoiding pasta completely since a single serving of normal pasta has about 35 - 40 carbs. This has been one of the biggest impacts to my diet as we love Italian cooking. I was not sure about Dreamfields' claim to only have 5 carbs, but we gave it a try anyway.<br /><br />After having a full serving, my blood sugar levels only took a modest rise, about what I would have expected from 5 carbs (plus the 15 others from the rest of the meal)!<br /><br />It does cost more than regular pasta, but it is worth it to me to be able to eat pasta again.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

review/summary: A topnotch pasta for those who want more fiber and less blood sugar spiking
review/text: I've been using Dreamfields pasta for about a year and a half now. It's become a kitchen staple for us. I bought it to help keep my sugar under control while still enjoying pasta dishes. My husband, a very finicky eater, didn't even notice it was high-fiber (well, until he got a bit gassy later). Tastewise, this is just as good as regular, quality pasta. (And not gritty like whole wheat ones can be.)<br /><br />A very nice product, and a boon to those watching their sugar numbers. I'll add that I don't get the super-sleepiness after eating this pasta that I used to eating regular pasta (you know, that post-carb napping syndrome).<br /><br />I've used the penne, the linguine, the elbow (for mac'n'cheese) and the lasagna (for veggie and regular lasagne casseroles). Great. All of them.<br /><br />Thumbs up.

review/text: I paid $2.49 in my supermarket for one box of linguine. I don't know if Amazon is selling a multiple pack, but you might want to check if your local supermarket can order it for you before you pay so much. I found it tasty and lower in carbs, judging by its effect on my body, than normal pasta. Note, it's still not a diet food, but if you eat a normal portion with a sauce that has no added sugar, it's great. It was a bit softer than durum pasta, but I might have overcooked it, and I don't usually cook it al dente, anyway.

review/text: This product is awesome for diabetics. Most pasta, even the higher fiber ones, still have about 39-41 carbs per serving, which keeps us diabetics from being able to enjoy pasta as much and as often as we'd like. But Dreamfields only has 5 digestible grams of carb in each serving so you can enjoy a healthy serving. And it tastes like regular pasta. The only problem is the high cost shipping per box. I found two health food stores where I live that carries Dreamfields at about $3.50 per box. I recommend this product and checking for it at your local health food stores.

When it arrived I was somewhat disappointed to find the word "Peppered" on the package. No where in the description or the picture of the product does it show that it is peppered. I don't generally care for peppered jerkies. This one was just okay because of that. The flavor was good but then the pepper cancels it out for me. My husband likes it, so it isn't a total loss. So be aware, if you do NOT like peppered jerky, do not purchase this buffalo jerky. If you do like it, then you will enjoy this very much.

We had been feeding her only on indoor cat dry food. After many trips to the vet and rounds of antibiotics, I read that some cats with this problem do better on wet food - something to do with not drinking enough water or just not getting enough fluids in general. For the past 4 years, she has not had one bladder infection! Friskies Chicken Dinner in Gravy Special Diet is the only one she likes the taste of.

review/text: This is my cat's second favorite food.  He's not a senior but he just goes wild over this stuff.  I have to give it to him quite often because he just smells it in the cabinet, I think.  Between this one and the turkey and cheese, I should have been offered stock in the company by now.  There are many, many cases of this stuff that comes home for our cat.  He loves it that much.

review/summary: Fabulous Chocolate
review/text: I first tasted this chocolate when I happened to come upon the company shop in Burlington, Vermont.  I was delighted to find it in one of the shops near my town in Connecticut, but it sold out so quickly that I couldn't count on finding it when needed for a gift or for my own pleasure.  I solved the problem by buying the 80 piece box on line at Amazon.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z9RJAG">Dark Chocolate Maple Crunch (80 piece) - Chocolates of Vermont</a><br /><br />Each piece of chocolate is beautifully wrapped in gold paper. Unwrap it and find a maple leaf embossed on the top surface of the candy.  Bite into the hefty, delicious dark chocolate or let it melt in your mouth.  Either way, find a surprise piece of maple crunch inside. Swoon.

review/text: Maybe I was disappointed because my expectations were different than the product I recieved.  This "jerky" is more of a slow cooked, somewhat moist piece of meat.  I'm more of an old fashioned jerky guy.  This has a higher moisture content than I consider appropriate for jerky. It has a slight unnatural smok taste.  All in all, definately not "bad" product, just not quite what I was looking for.

review/text: I'm a big fan of the sweet chili sauce for rice and other asian food products as a condiment or dipping sauce.  I was looking for another brand "Thai Chili Sauce", but it's harder and harder to find in large capacity containers.  I bought this as a subsitute, and I really enjoy it.  It comes in large qauanty containers,  I can only find of my other favorit Thai Chili Sauce in small 2.5 ounce expensive containers.  This comes as a full two liters of sauce, so this will last me at least three months, and it's cheaper in large qantities.  I will buy this brand again.

review/summary: Little things
review/text: It's the little things that make all the difference. Our 11 week old son prefers Enfamil, or rather his GI prefers it. I was shocked at how quickly formula turns sour, and Adam will not tolerate refrigerated formula over 24hrs or room temperature bottles over 1hr. Powder is a pain, concentrate and ready to feed cans make too much, and single serving 4oz are not enough. These 8oz ready to feed are just right, and cheaper by volume than everything (ready to feed). There is far less waste being poured down the drain. Travelling to Grandma's house? No need to pack ice, just throw a couple of bottles in the bag and go. Daycare has a couple in his locker for backup. How much of your formula ends up in your infant's belly?

review/text: We have used Enfamil for my son for several months now. I enjoy the convenience of the ready to feed liquid and this is one of the best prices that I have been able to find. I purchased this when Amazon was also offering a coupon, so it was a great deal. It is also wonderful to have his formula delivered right to our home, instead of making a trip to the store. I will definitely purchase our formula from Amazon again.

review/summary: Great Formula
review/text: I breastfed my daughter for 5 1/2 months and was very anxious when I had to transition her to formula. I read a ton of reviews and even looked at the organic options. For the first few days we tried similac which caused a lot of upset stomach and gas. I had a sample of enfamil so I gave it a try. We have been hooked ever since! The ready feed option is so easy to use and my daughter adjusted to it without any problems. I am also price conscious and amazon definently has the best price for the 6pack ready feed...there shipping is always on time and its one less thing to worry about.

review/text: My little one loves this formula and especially loves the pre-mixed kind (more than the powder). Unfortunately, it is really too expensive for us to buy all the time, but whenever we use it, we are pleased!  The one issue with this particular (8 oz) size is the fact that you can't just stick a nipple right on the Enfamil bottle, but still have to use your own bottle, which seems to defeat the purpose a bit!

review/summary: My son would always spit this back up.
review/text: I really like Enfamil powder and after I saw this I thought it would be a good alternative to mixing.  The first few times my son had it, he didn't appear to like it.  It was a darker color, with an odd odor (not spoiled, but off smelling) and that concerned me.  I kept it for times when I wasn't able to get his powder mix ready and was hungry.  He would spit up often after keeping at it.  I am throwing the rest away.  I don't recommend using this unless you're really in a hurry or out and about a need something quick.  Be prepared for spit up. I won't be using this again.

I keep them in my walk in closet by my cat's feeding station. I used to keep the bigger bags there, but then I had 3 big bags of food all open at one time. I would take some kibble from each bag and mix it in the bowl. Inevitably, little pieces of kibble would fly around in the closet and land on the floor and hide from me. It was a mess. With these little bags, I am able to open one and dump the whole thing in the bowl and then, when that has been eaten, they get another flavor. I like this system much better. I just zip open a bag and pour in the contents. Then there is no mess in the closet.<br /><br />I love having my cat food delivered. That way I do not have to go through the routine of putting it in the cart, then out of the cart. Now into a grocery bag, then out of a grocery bag and into the cupboard. Instead it is in the front door, out of the box and into the cupboard (closet). Much, much easier.<br /><br />I think your kitties will enjoy the taste of Filet Migon and you will enjoy the handiness of these little one pound bags. Getting them delivered on a rotating basis is an extra plus provided by Amazon. I love it and hope you will too. Thank you for your time.

review/text: When I left England in 1997 I think I missed these the most, sure there were parents and aunts and uncles, but that's why they invented the web cam.  Looking at Cherry Bakewells on a webcam never gave me the same satisfaction of actually eating one.  I could get other people to eat them and then describe precisely the sensation, but it was never enough.  I tried to find a US substitute over here, Cherry Poptarts?  Hah!  I laugh at your pitiful attempts at creating a cherry cake.<br /><br />Jump forward about 10 years and these babies show up on Amazon, what a great day indeed.  I ordered a pack immediately and awaited their arrival, they arrived promptly and as I ate the first one (whole) that same great taste I remembered came flooding back.  The soft fondant icing, the almondy crumble filling, the plum jam at the bottom, the firm but somehow soft pastry case and of course the cherry on top.  Bliss :)<br /><br />I don't recommend anyone buy these as I want them all for myself.  All of them you hear? ALL OF THEM!!!!!

review/text: I used to get these at the Esso station near my house when I lived in England and ever since that first one, I've been hooked.  When I left England, I had to do without until a few years later when a friend who turned out to have parents in England had them send me two boxes for Christmas!  They're so light, perfect when you want just "a little something".  When my fiance assumes I will share them with him, he usually gets a chewing out because some things you just don't share!  I would say, if you can find them locally, that would be a better option.  They are pretty delicate and rarely hold up to shipping real well.  But crumbled bakewells eat just as well! Also, sine they are mostly jam and frosting, they are super sweet (which I love) but some may not like something so sweet.

I'm in love with the Honey Nut flakes version they came out with first recently in the U.S. It's perfect. Then I tasted this crap. It tastes nothing like the honey nut (which I guess is the point), but it's not in a good way. I can't even really describe it to you, it's just not an appealing taste. It's like you're eating burnt toast mixed with molasses or something. It's a shame because I love almost all things caramel too. Avoid this one.

review/summary: Unbelievably superior!
review/text: Linguini and fettuccine are my favorite pasta shapes. For many years I've been buying delicious, imported-from-Italy DeCecco pasta, but I found this on sale and decided to try it. OMG this is the BEST linguini I have ever tasted! It has the most wonderful toothiness. Every bite was better than the last and I didn't have to eat a lot to feel satisfied. I can't pay nearly $7/lb but I will definitely stock up when I find it on sale. I'm afraid I'll have to demote lovely DeCecco to 4.5 stars!

review/summary: Nice Product
review/text: I bought this sea salt grinder a while back at a local super store. The flavor is good and the grinder works well even having a knob to adjust for coarse or fine grind. The knob turns quite a bit so it's not just a two stage choice but allows for a range. Be careful though as I left the bottle too close to the stove one day and the top melted. The grinder cap came off and could not be reattached. I dumped the salt into a container and I use it whenever I need a pinch. The salt is very coarse obviously but works fine for cooking.<br /><br />Overall I like these grinders as they are nice and big and the adjustable grind is a nice touch. Shop around though because Amazon does not have the best price on these and I was able to pick them up for about half this price locally.

review/summary: It's So, ahem, Salty!
review/text: Salt is salt. If you like, it's sodium chloride. Or, if you like, it occurs naturally as the mineral Halite (I'm a geologist, by the way). If it's pure, it's just sodium chloride and there's no reason to believe that one type of salt is any different than the other. Thus it is that I have looked at such gourmet products as "Mediterranean Sea Salt" with a great deal of skepticism, and especially when you note the exceptionally high prices associated with such products.<br /><br />Well, my wife obtained a grinder of Mediterranean Sea Salt and I got after her for such a needless expense. I tried it, of course, and I was amazed. The taste is superb, much better than regular salt. It's so bright and fresh and, ahem, salty. Just a little bit is all you need. How can this be? Are other commercial salts somehow contaminated with extraneous ingredients? In any case, give Mediterranean Sea Salt a try sometime and make up your own mind.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I was hesitant to pay ten bucks for a disposable salt shaker but, boy, am I glad I did.  The salt itself is devine -- truly tasty-- and enhances the flavor of many dishes.  The grinder is large and easy to turn.  With the companion pepper grinder, it is a perfect set to use both in the kitchen at the table.  I highly recommend this product.

The noodles are still great quality but the flavoring is horrid. I've since given the entire boxes to a friend that will eat anything.

review/text: I purchased this butter flavor for $8.93 in October 2011, which was a good price/oz compared with other offerings.  I used 8 drops in an ice cream called "Savannah Buttermint", and it added a substantial, deep butter flavor.  The ingredient seems perfectly good for home cooking, though since 8 drops delivered so much flavor, I don't see how I'll ever use the rest of the bottle.

review/summary: Not quite was depicted
review/text: For starters, it comes in a clear plastic bottle, not the dark glass in the picture.  Then there's the ingredient list:<br /><br />Water, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, natural and artificial flavors, Phosphoric Acid.  Doing a bit of research, I find that while propylene glycol is what goes into modern antifreeze and hand sanitizers, the US FDA has determined that it is "generally considered safe.  According to the rest of the reading, it would take a LOT to cause a problem.  But my question is: Why are we using it at all?  Is there nothing else that will do the job?  Theoretically, it's an alcohol, but then again wood alcohol makes people go blind, so...<br /><br />Lots of questions, no conclusive answers.  I'll likely try a drop or two, but I wish Amazon had revealed this in the first place.  At $8.xx, it's not responsible to the carbon footprint to ship it back... but that doesn't mean I've go to like it.<br /><br />EDIT: put a couple drops into some oil... it doesn't mix.  Not even a little bit.  So it is being returned.  Not worth buying, IMO.

review/text: There are a lot of salad croutons out there.  Some have no taste and add nothing to a salad, some have too much taste and overwhelm a salad and some are way too oily for my texture preference.  Actually, we don't always put salad croutons in our salads but if we make a Caesar salad then, yes, we definitely want a crouton.  The Cardini's Gourmet Cut Crouton's are the absolute best croutons to put in a Caesar salad.  None better taste or texture-wise.

review/summary: Made my dogs sick!
review/text: Having to watch what my three dogs eat, I first ordered a single package of SmartBones from another website as a trial. Since everyone was fine and the dogs loved them, I ordered a bag of each flavor from Amazon.com. After a single small SmartBone all three dogs became very ill. The two larger dogs were able to recover on their own but the smallest dog spent 6 days in the vet hospital, came home a few days, and is back in the hospital again.<br /><br />I took the SmartBones package to the vet to make sure I hadn't overlooked an ingredient they shouldn't have and the first thing the vet noted was this product is made in China where there is no assurance of either contents or quality. My vet has treated several pets who became ill from Chinese products and also said there are reports of salmonella discovered in other pet products manufactured in China. I share this information to spare others the agony of seeing their pets become ill, along with the considerable expense ($500 and counting) of trying to get them well.

review/summary: Awesome jerky
review/text: This is really good stuff.  It's made from slabs of top round so it's very tender and chewable, and I didn't run across any gristle at all.  Each package is generously sized so it would probably be difficult to eat one in one sitting (both the size and the heat contribute to that opinion).<br /><br />It's a bit on the sweet and "soy saucy" side, but it has a hell of a kick and the flavors mesh nicely.  The habaneros make themselves known pretty quickly, both going in and (at the risk of sounding crude) coming out, but the pain on either end is worth it.<br /><br />I rated it 4 stars because it was a bit sweeter than I normally like, but it's an EASY 5 star jerky if you don't mind that particular flavor.  Will likely order again once my internals cool off.

review/summary: Best Jerkey Ever!
review/text: Wow. This was by far the best jerkey I have ever had. I have tried a very large number of different brands and this blows away the competition! The jerkey taste very fresh like it was homemade. If you have ever had homemade jerkey than you will know what I mean and appreciate this product. It does not seem overly spicy like you would expect with habanero peppers but it does have a very nice spice. The jerkey is very similar to a roadside stand I stop at every year on the way to Mammoth Lakes, Ca. After eating this, you will not be able to ever buy the fake jerkey they sell in stores again! Highly recommended.

review/summary: Good old-fashioned jerky
review/text: My wife bought a bag of this in an airport while traveling and brought it home for me, and I'm happy to say that I have a new favorite beef jerky brand! I like it because it has a simple, beefy taste with no frills and doesn't taste too salty. I also like how the pieces are solid, meaning no random stringy or fatty pieces which I hate. I've never seen this in local stores, so being able to get it in bulk from Amazon was a nice find.

review/summary: Tasty!! Need more tender
review/text: Never try this brand before but saw it has a good review so just give it a try.<br /><br />Pro: Very tasty. I order the pepper flavor and it is one of the best beef jerky I ever tried.<br /><br />Con: It is not tender enough. If your tooth are not strong enough, you need to take great effort to bite. Actually there is a way to tear it before you bite and make it easy. But I guess most people still prefer more tender.<br /><br />Bottom line: the hardness is still acceptable and it is very tasty. The quality price ratio is pretty high. Recommend!
