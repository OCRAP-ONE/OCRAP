review/summary: YUMMY, but too sweet for an Every Day snack
review/text: I love Coconut and the flavor is really good, but it was much sweeter than expected. I like to have a healthy mid morning snack at work and this is just a little too much to serve that purpose. I have enjoyed having one before a workout to get some extra energy but I won't be buying these on a regular basis.

review/summary: A little stale...but I'll give them another chance
review/text: I searched out my favorite KIND bars on Amazon because I was buying them every day at the mini mart for nearly two dollars each.  These are the best; not too sweet, very filling, perfect for a post-workout craving.  I signed up for Subscribe and Save to get the best deal and because I know I'll go through these things. My first delivery came within a week but I'm sad to say that they were stale.  Not flat-out gross, thankfully they still taste good. But they are super hard and chewy (much more so than normal) and appear to have been exposed to high heat, like they melted a bit at some point.  I've got to admit that I never looked at the expiration date on one that I've bought at a mini mart, but that's probably because they've never been stale or given me cause to question the freshness. As it turns out, the case I have now was delivered in September 2012 and expires in October 2013, so they should be fine. Hopefully, this was just a fluke and the next case will be better.  If not, they're getting returned and I'll find another source.  So, the KIND Fruit & Nut bars would normally get 5 stars from me, but my experience by ordering them through Amazon brought them down a few stars.  I'll try to remember to update in the future.

review/text: I love kind bars!  As a super allergic person these have been very helpful. However when I received the "apple cinnamon pecan" bars, tore open the first one and saw CASHEW pieces, sadness resulted. If there is an ingredient as allergy causing as peanuts or cashews in a bar that I could SEE upon opening it should be noted somewhere. My mother won as I gave her the box if bars but I, sadly, had a big disappointment.

review/summary: Apricot & Almond bars satisfy me!
review/text: I have recently discovered the Kind bars and thoroughly enjoy them because they genuinely taste good and are a reasonable expense. The Apricot & Almond bars are my favorite and are now entered into subscription . . . I love them as an anytime snack! Healthy yes, but these are way better tasting than most granola bars! The nuts with dried fruit remind me of the vegetarian version of pemmican. These are rich tasting, low glycemic impact, nice crunch, sweet & tangy fruit with a bit of chew for enjoyment!! I have these bars with a cup'o'Kicking Horse coffee and am "in the saddle" and energized!

review/summary: Stays better intact than protein bars in the heat
review/text: Usually, I consume protein bars during my work day, but I had to search for something to replace those bars during the hotter months in my part of California because protein bars melt quite quickly if not stored in a cooler with ice packs. I was on the search for something that would not weigh me down during the work day, taste good, and portable. I tried several other flavors before I found two that agreed with my taste buds - almond & coconut and nut delight.

review/text: I grabbed a variety of various protein/energy bars, including a few different KIND bars after I got a free sample of the Dark Chocolate & Sea Salt. The DCK & Sea Salt flavor is now my ultimate measuring stick for the rest of the salty sweet snacks KIND provides. The Almond & Apricot flavor is particularly disappointing, unfortunately. Many of the other varieties are very satiating and flavorful, but the apricot fruit in combination with the nuts in this bar are a misplaced one. They just don't make sense on my pallet.

review/text: Even though I like the taste of these bars (Apricot & Macademia) because of presense of macademia nuts, i am kind of upset with the company (KIND).  In the past 6 months, the bars got A LOT smaller, and price for an individual bar went up.  I hate when companies do that. It's called greed.<br />As the the stale taste (in other reviews) -- I do know that macademia nuts go stale very fast.  I don't know what can be done about that, short of making them salty for preservation.

review/summary: Awesome Taste, Great Aroma!
review/text: When I first got my Keurig brewing machine, I was a little skeptical about the quality of coffee any K-Cup could provide. After making a cup of Gloria Jean's Hazelnut coffee using a K-Cup from a sample pack, I now stand corrected! Gloria Jean's makes great coffee to begin with and their Hazelnut coffee in K-Cup form is fantastic.<br /><br />The coffee gives off a wonderful Hazelnut aroma while it's brewing and it tastes great! It's the kind of aroma and taste you'd expect after grinding the beans yourself, but the K-Cup saves you the hassle. In the time that I've owned a Keurig brewer, this is hands-down one of the best coffees I've tried, and I'll definitely be ordering it again.<br /><br />My only complaint is in the packaging, but since it doesn't have anything to do with the quality of the coffee, I can't rate it less than five stars. Just wish this 50-pack came in a differently-sized/designed box so it would store more easily in a kitchen cabinet.

review/summary: Delicious hazelnut aroma!
review/text: I love Gloria Jean coffee and their hazelnut K-cups do not disappoint. The aroma smells mouthwatering as it's brewing and the strength is just right. I do have to admit that hazelnut coffee tends to be on the light side of coffee strength so strong coffee drinkers beware! I always use the medium cup setting on the Keurig B60 special edition so if you want it stronger, use the smallest cup setting. At $0.60 per cup, this is easily the best value for coffee, especially if you're drinking a mug everyday like me.

review/summary: Am I drinking the same coffee as the 5-star reviewers?
review/text: I don't know how what I tried could be considered the same as what all the rave reviews are coming in for.<br /><br />When we got our new Keurig brewer for Christmas it came with a sample pack of 12 different coffees. We were excited for the opportunity to try different blends before purchasing an entire (pricey) box of any one flavor.<br /><br />To preface: I enjoy flavored coffees. French vanilla, mocha, hazelnut... Pretty much any variety available. I was really excited to try Gloria Jean's Hazelnut since it was one of the few flavored options in the sample pack. I typically enjoy smooth medium roasts and I can't stand bitter coffee with a pungent aftertaste.<br /><br />Unfortunately, though, this brew is without-a-doubt undrinkable. So bitter and thick. I couldn't believe this was supposed to be a flavored blend. It smelled burnt as soon as it was brewed. We brewed an 8 ounce cup since typically flavored coffees tend to be weaker so we assumed brewing the smaller size cup would allow us to enjoy to most flavor. The coffee was dark in appearance and both my boyfriend and I tried it befor dumping it out in the sink because the taste was so foul.<br /><br />Aside from its burnt flavor and bitter aftertaste, it's also worth mentioning that I couldn't detect any hazelnut notes at all. Very disappointing.<br /><br />I'd never tried a Gloria Jean brand coffee before and now I'm nervous to try another. I might attempt the Butter Toffee flavor if I can find it in a small pack. But I'll avoid hazelnut from now on.

review/text: I'm generally not a fan of Hazelnut coffee but even I like this one.  My husband tried this in a sample pack and loved it so I ordered them for him.  I was surprised that the cups arrived loose in the shipping box so make sure you have a container for them as this box doesn't exactly fit in the cabinet the way the small retail boxes do.  That said this coffee has a nice bold taste which works great in a big mug.  We will definitely buy more of these.

review/summary: Hazelnut Heaven
review/text: My husband and I are hazelnut coffee fans.  We've tried every brand of hazelnut K-cups we can find.  The Gloria Jean's is our favorite, even beating out Dunkin' Donut's and Millstone's Hazelnut Cream (which used to be my favorite) hands down.  We always make the largest size cup and there is still plenty of flavor, never watered down or "thin" tasting.  I've always been the major coffee drinker in the house, until we got the Keurig and then the Gloria Jean's Hazelnut.  My husband now drinks 2-4 cups a day!  Make the investment in the Keurig so much more worth it.<br /><br />This purchase is a great deal.  At $0.60 per cup and free shipping, it's a fabulous price and I don't feel like I'm paying extra money for packaging.  It does come in a no-frills box with all 50 of the cups just loose in the large box.  However, we have a holder on the counter which we fill and just keep the box in the pantry to pull from as we need.  If you have a storage situation like a stand or a drawer you keep your K-cups in, you'll have no complaints about them being loose in the box.  We're about to order our second box, and will definitely be repeat buyers!

When a couple people make coffee daily, you can really go through the k-cups, and this product keeps us stocked.  When these arrived, there were one or two that had been damaged in transit, but it didn't really bother me.  I removed the broken cups and transferred the rest to our k-cup staging area.  Definitely a good buy.

review/summary: Bitter, Burned Flavor. Major Aftertaste.
review/text: With the first sip, you can taste the bitter, burned nut flavor in this Gloria Jeans k-cup.  Top it off with a major aftertaste (cream & sugar didn't help) & this blend went straight to the bottom of my list.<br /><br />If you want a nice hazelnut coffee, try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IRGDFW">Millstone Coffee, Hazelnut Cream, 12-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 3)</a>.

review/summary: Not a good value and weak in strength.
review/text: I guess my title says it all.<br /><br />Price has gone up 30% plus in the past three months. I have got my old coffee maker back out for when there is more than one of us having coffee. At over 50 cents a cup, even on "sale", this is too much. (All K-cup were at one time 30-40 cents now they are 50-60 cents!)<br /><br />For the taste it is weak at best and I am not a strong coffee drinker.  Better flavored Kcups out there but this one is just OK.  I do like some other Gloria Jean's coffee but usually get the bold one's just get a normal cup of coffee.

review/summary: Gloria Jean's Coffee - Hazelnut
review/text: Gloria Jean's Coffees, Hazelnut K-Cups for Keurig.  Tasted fine but was hoping for a bit more Hazelnut flavor.  In their defense I have found most K-Cups not to have a strong flavor like fresh brew coffee.  Product good, would buy again, but the flavor was not over the top.

review/summary: Smooth, Rich, non-acidy flavor
review/text: I love hazlenut coffee.  I have tried several brand of Kcups over the first year of having a Keurig.  Gloria Jean's Hazelnut is rich in flavor without the acidy after taste of many others that often upsets your stomach if you enjoy coffee often.  I start out the day with no less than 4 cups and I never get tired of Gloria Jean's.  You simply "must" use the "frustration free" packaging, thank's Amazon!

review/summary: Not as strong as previous orders
review/text: I've bought this flavor a number of times before.  This latest order, the coffee simply isn't as strong as previous orders.  In fact, it's absolutely flavorless.  I'm not sure what is wrong with this batch, but it's completely unacceptable.
