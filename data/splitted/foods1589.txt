review/summary: I want my Bays!
review/text: My husband and I grew up in Milwaukee eating Bays English Muffins.  We've lived all over the world and have yet to find another English muffin that compares to Bays.  They have little pockets that pool with the butter as it melts...fantastic!  I'm so happy that we can order them online now.

review/summary: Undoubtedly the best
review/text: I discovered Bay's English Muffins when I lived in Cleveland, where they are sold in markets. I now live in Philadelphia and no muffin sold here even comes close to the unique taste of Bay's. The others (Thomas' seems to have a stranglehold on the market here) are just like regular bread that's in the shape of muffins. It's well worth mail-ordering them. Better still would be if Bay's started selling muffins in Philly stores.

review/summary: No Soy!
review/text: I think these muffins taste so much better than any other brand out there- and I believe it's because they don't use soy flour or soy oil like every other bread and muffin company out there!  I would never buy any other brand.  These are great for toasting, jams and butter and I make awesome English muffin pizzas from them. I just toast them first and then add my toppings and bake in the oven @ 375 for 14 minutes.  healthy and delicious!

review/text: I am from Michigan, where I grew up eating Bays English Muffins. I always liked them, but didn't realize how much better they were than the rest. I moved to Seattle and couldn't find Bays ANYWHERE! So, when my mom would visit, she would stuff her suitcase with Bays for me. I tried other brands that looked like Bays, but they didn't come close in taste. Now, my husband and kids love them too, so I order them online!!! They are truly the best!!!

review/summary: The Best English Muffin
review/text: I grew up on Thomas's, have tried other brands including the almighty Wolfermans' (Blech!). My parents moved to North Carolina and found Bays in the local grocery store. At each visit my father would push them and I resisted...should never doubt Dad...they are without doubt the best english muffin I've tried. Can't find them in my area of New York and was so happy to see I could order on-line. I too will make room in my freezer, gladly sacrificing ice cream room!

I love the sourdough, whole wheat, and original. Though original i like best.  With Breakstone's whipped salted butter on it, and it's a slice of heaven!<br /><br />I just wish it were easier to find now that I'm back in New England!

review/summary: Bay's English Muffins are fantastic!
review/text: I learned about these muffins while visiting Costa Rica where they are sold at a local supermarket. Because they are not sold in New Jersey where I reside, I searched for them on the Internet. To my surprise I was able to buy a case and have them shipped to my home. My entire family loves them.  They have a special flavor unlike the normal English Muffins sold in NJ. They are pre-sliced so that you always have a perfect muffin to toast.  Add some imported butter and they are so deliscious.  I can't every go back to the Thomas English Muffins.

review/text: I grew up in Tulsa where Bay's were the only English muffins around -- at least at our house. I have since had to branch out to other brands because Bay's have become hard to find. Nothing is as good as Bay's. Nothing. Nada. Bother to compare, if you must, but you'll find no better, if as good, English muffin in the U.S. Whenever I am fortunate enough to find them in my local grocery, I buy every package they have. Now I can order through Amazon. Happy day!

review/text: These english muffins, to me, are by far the best tasting. They toast crisp on the crust, while retaining good texture and pockets for butter. I can't find them locally anymore, so am forced to buy the bulk package. The good news is that freezing them does not detract from the taste after thawing. Luckily we are a two freezer family.<br /><br />The shipping cost adds to the price, but still reasonable when you're hooked on a product.

review/text: I first tried Bay's english muffins about 20 years ago and haven't bought any other brand by choice since then. They toast up nice and crispy and taste better than anything else I have tried. Some people say less sour or I think less "doughy". The are great with just butter and jam but hold up well to heavier items. I also use them for scrambled egg and cheese breakfast sandwiches, peanut butter and jelly, egg salad, tuna.

review/summary: Does it make sense to post Yet Another 5-star review?
review/text: Bays English Muffins are the best English muffins!  One might consider them the only widely available English muffin in the U.S.  I don't have anything new to add besides the other excellent reviews here.  I like that they're sliced rather than split, their delicious taste and chewy texture are like real muffins, not like conventional bread in the shape of a muffin.<br /><br />Back in the late '80s, one of the big fast food chains offered breakfast sandwiches on croissants.  Then one day, suddenly they replaced the pastry with a hamburger bun formed in the shape of a croissant, and it just completely ruined the sandwich.  That's how I feel about the dominant brands of muffins--they're not muffins at all, just ordinary, dried out bread.<br /><br />We relate to poster whose mom would bring out Bays when she visited; we used to have to smuggle back Bays from Chicago to Boston, but now we've got Bays here!  If only we could get Brownberry bread out here, too--still bring home a whole sack of Brownberry as part of our carry-on baggage when we fly home.

review/text: I have eaten Bays English Muffins for years.  In the last 6 months or so, there has been a consistent quality control problem.  The muffins are not being cut in halves.  Instead, they are consistently cut leaving a small top slice so thin that parts of it burn in the toaster.  This problem occurs in every carton I buy.

I've tried the rest, and these are the best by a very wide margin.  This is one case where you truly do get what you pay for.<br /><br />Where I live in Indiana, they can be a hard find.  The local W-M and Marsh stores carried them...then they didn't...then they did...sadly, now they don't.  It is a bit more expensive to order online, but worth it if it's the only way to get them.<br /><br />Beware, once you've had Bay's, you will forever be ruined for any other muffin.

review/text: I was pleasantly suprised to see that Bays English Muffins are available on Amazon as you can't find them with any regularity in this state.  I ordered a case on a Thursday and received them the following Monday.  They were packed nicely and very fresh.  The box says to refrigerate or freeze immediately but I kept some in the pantry (which stayed fresh for over a week) and froze the rest.  As long as you have the freezer space for them, this is a great way to buy them.  Even with the shipping cost, it still works out to be a litter cheaper per package than in the stores.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002Y121K">Bays English Muffins</a><br />Excellent English Muffins! I bought these muffins in Northa Carolina and loved them! I do not have a place in my area where I can buy them so I ordered them directly fom Bays. In the area that I live in we have the brand Thomas and I can not even remotely compare them to Bays.<br /><br />Bays is the ways.......to go!! Hands down, they are softer, tastier, and stay fresher longer. I was most impressed at how soft the muffins were. I also thought it was great that the muffin was not to toasted, so when I toast them they are light if I prefer them that way, unlike the heavily toasted other brands. I received the case within a weeks time, purchased here on Amazon. I froze most of the muffins, but I can't imagine them lasting too long in my freezer because they taste so good! I will definately purchase them again!<br /><br />Also, I received them yesterday Febuary 21st and the date on the muffins is April 10th. That is awesome that they can stay fresh that long in the refrigerated section if I want them to.<br /><br />When I first thought of buying a case it seemed crazy, however, the price is right on target for per each (even with the shipping charge) and I will always have a fresh supply in my freezer since I bought a case.

review/summary: Nooks and Crannies are still deep in this brand . . .
review/text: If you were to do an English Muffin test regarding the long aqueducts that form in which the butter treks along `nooks and crannies' of a Thomas evrsus a bays English muffin, there is no real winner because they both absorb and entertain the healthy eater ! These BAYS ENGLISH MUFFINS are not only identical to the Thomas brand but they are less expensive. This review is for the original type of Bays English Muffin which is sold in most grocery chain stores that carry the Thomas's brand.<br /><br />Bays English Muffin is the Bays Michigan Corporation run out of Chicago Illinois so this product is STILL manufactured and distributed in the USA which makes me a rather proud consumer. It is also a product thankfully void of chemicals I cannot pronounce, additives that are hazardous to my continued cognitive construction and brain development (yes the brain is forever developing), and non-nutritional components I will never metabolize effectively.<br /><br />This tradition of the nooks and crannies which soak up the running tributaries of butter pooled in the center and flowing radically throughout, began in 1933. Not for me of course, I was not even born yet; however, older relatives of my extended family do recall this delightful toasted breakfast treat. For a scrumptious meal you can stack anything on top of this to start your day off with a smile and satisfied tum-tum.<br /><br />The Ingredients: Bays uses the finest and I found all of them quite safe and important in maintaining quality of life.<br /><br />Bleached wheat flour; Water; 2% or less of the following: Potato flour; Dry Whole Milk; Butter; Sugar; Yeast; Salt; Malted Barley Flour; Niacin; Reduced Iron;<br />Folic Acid; Thiamin Mononitrate; Riboflavin; Baking powder; Yeast nutrients--The grains in here are definitely appreciated by the yeast components which read as follows: calcium sulfate and ammonium chloride; Enzymes; Corn starch; White corn meal; Farina; Sodium Propionate and Propionic acid; Sulfites.<br /><br />Overall, the Bays English Muffin is a good portion of healthy ! There are 6 in this plastic wrapped breakfast staple in this household and each serving contains 57 grams of yumminess.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts<br /><br />Calories: 140 from fat: 10<br />Total Fat: 1.5 grams or 2%<br />Saturated Fat: 0.5 grams or 3%<br />Trans Fat: 0 grams or 0%<br /><br />Cholesterol: 0 milligrams or 0%<br />Sodium: 540 milligrams or 22%<br />Total Carbs: 27 grams or 9%<br />Dietary Fiber: 1 gram or 5%<br />Sugars 2 grams or ? %<br />Protein: 5 grams or ? %<br /><br />Vitamin A: 0%, Vitamin C: 0%, Calcium: 6%, Iron 8%, Thiamin 20%, Riboflavin 10%, Niacin 10% * percent daily values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.

review/summary: Best there is for Risotto
review/text: You shouldn't make risotto with anything other than arborio rice; this is the right stuff.  Eight pounds seems like a lot, but it's vacuum-packed in boxes of two pounds, and so it should keep well.  (However, I'm already into the second eight pound order because it's so good!)  This is less expensive than buying smaller packages at the grocery.<br /><br />You can find the recipe for the smoked Gouda risotto in the pictures by searching for "emory cottage risotto".

review/summary: too hot
review/text: I'm typically a huge fan of spicy food and absolutely love the favor of jalapenos and ranch.  But wow, these were just too much. The spice was so hot and strong that it made these unpleasant to eat. A couple chips gave me a terrible case of heartburn.  I do like the idea of the popcorn chips though and will be seeking out another flavor to see if it's any better

review/text: I loved the quality and the taste of these cookies. They are not too sweet and they will live to your expectations. To the person that posted a bad review, just a small comment. They are called meltaways because they have real butter, go figure. If you are interested in low fat food, look elsewhere. It like complaining that french fries are fried, or that chocolate is fattening. Just saying.

review/text: These were so, so good, and I love that they're made with whole wheat flour and a healthier sugar substitute (not aspartame or splenda).  I looked at some Atkins peanut butter cups I'd just bought, and they're a higher percentage of saturated fat than these cookies.  I worry a lot more about the sugar in a product than the fat, unless it's made with soybean oil or lists trans fat.  I list this as one of my "healthy snacks."  And since I'm over 40, size 4, with no health problems - I must be on the right track of what "healthy" is. :)<br /><br />One customer said hers were "greasy."  Maybe hers were in the heat, and the butter got hot?  I'm now placing my third order for these. They're worth it!

review/text: My husband is gluten sensitive, dairy sensitive, and diabetic, so it is very difficult to find desserts for him.  Usually, if it's gluten free, it has waaaay too much sugar, for example.  I tried a box of these cookies for him.  He tried them and said that they are surprisingly good.<br /><br />They are not mereingues, even though they are shaped like those types of cookies.  They are regular cookie consistency.  There are just a few in a package, so they are rather expensive.  However, they are less expensive than buying all the materials yourself and having them fail.  (Can you tell I have made some bombs in my time as a specialty cook? LOL)

review/text: I buy mine from the local middle eastern store in NY and it costs me $1.59 for the 10 oz bottle. This is ridiculously overpriced. Just bought one yesterday to make some desserts and cookies. This brand, however, is much better than Ziyad brand in terms of quality and overall taste. That being said, I would never pay $4 for a 10 oz bottle. Even the 17 oz bottle is cheaper than $4 at my local store.

review/text: It smells much stronger than I imagined. Like candy. It is hard to believe it is all natural but Cortas seems to have a very good reputation with other customers.<br /><br />It does feel refreshing and I like that I can use it in my hair rinse (masks the ACV smell), or under my arms. As far as a toner- which is why I bought it, I might need to use it longer to feel the toning effects. I wanted it to help restore my natural pH balance, but so far I prefer it on the rest of my body.<br /><br />I also think the price is much better than the other rose waters on Amazon.

Amazon subscribe and save is still slightly more than going to 'the bath store' however, and their coupons make it cheaper also with free shipping. These are carried in several large brick and mortar stores now as well, so I won't be ordering them through amazon again until there's a significant price shift online.<br /><br />If you like a Kcup machine, but want an espresso as well, I highly recommend it. Puts out a similar crema/flavor to my Lavazza capsule machine. Though honestly, once you have the espresso, the coffee is always 'second choice.'

review/summary: A Whole Lotta Gummy Bears!
review/text: First off, these gummy bears were delivered in July, with temperatures in the mid-nineties.  When I opened the box, I was a bit worried because both huge bags of lemon bears looked to me melted!  But they weren't.  Each bear separated as hoped.<br /><br />Second, these bears are very nice tasting.  They are soft and a lovely color of yellow.  A bit of lemony tang also.<br /><br />Lastly, there are two huge five-pound bags in this order.  That's alot more gummy bears than we needed!  Anyway, I divided these up into ziploc bags, and we'll be snacking on these critters for quite a while!

review/text: I really enjoy this tea. It's as stimulating as coffee but it taste better. I will drink tea instead of coffee any day. Guayaki seems to be a good brand. I visited the company's website. Guayaki is the strongest Yerba Mate' that I have tried. I strongly recommend this to anyone seeking an alternative to coffee. Descriptions of the tea suggest that it also promotes mental awareness. I found this to be true. It is similar to the feeling i get when I take Gingko Biloba.

review/summary: Tastes great AND it's good for you!
review/text: I'm sitting here this morning drinking a cool and refreshing Guayaki Yerba Mate and it reminded me that I have not yet done a review on my most favorite drink. Guayaki mate comes in many forms; dry loose-leaf tea, tea bags for steeping, and sweetened, flavored iced tea. I was first introduced to the joys of mate over a year ago by my tea-savvy sister-in-law. She was so devoted that should could not help but tell everyone she knew about the awesome powers of mate. Yerba Mate is made from a holly tree that grows in the South American Rainforest and the native people have been drinking it for centuries. In fact the natives call it the "drink of the gods." Mate contains a cousin of caffeine that many have dubbed "mateine" which wakes you mentally without all the negative side effects that caffeine has. It doesn't give you the jitters, or an upset stomach, or the sweats. It just gives your brain a little energy boost slowly but very effectively. Mate also contains many antioxidants, even more than green tea!<br /><br />The plain hot tea tastes very similar to plain green tea and is great on a chilly morning. They have recently started selling flavored versions of the hot tea (at least at the store near me) but I have not had a chance to try them. I know one of them is mint flavored and I would bet that it's tasty. The sweetened and flavored ice teas are beyond delicious. They come in Revel Berry, Lemon, and Mint flavors and I have tried all three. I'm not a big fan of the mint flavor, but my husband thinks it's the best of them all. My personal favorite is the Revel Berry flavor.<br /><br />Best of all, Guayaki is Certified Organic, Fair Trade, Kosher, and Non GMO. Guayaki is committed to helping the farmers earn a decent living as well as restore the Rainforest. According to the Guayaki can, "Guayaki's mission is to steward and restore 200,000 acres of South American Atlantic Rainforest and create over 1,000 living wage jobs by 2020". So, we can rest assured that the delicious beverage we are enjoying is going to actually HELP the Rainforest instead of ruin it. So drink up!

It also suppressed my appetite; I was not running to the vending machines for my usual 3 PM pick me up.  Definitely give it a try, it is very good, and not bitter at all, some teas if I steep them too long, they become bitter, making me gag, not this tea, the bag sits in the cup all till the last drop.<br />I love it!

review/summary: A little expensive, but good
review/text: This yerba mate has been described by some other reviewers as smoky, and I don't really agree with that at all. I think the flavor is slightly bitter and grassy, much more like a maccha green tea than anything that could be called "smoky." I do like the caffeine level it has, but think it's important to note that it's very different than coffee caffeine, which an earlier reviewer seemed to miss when she asked why not just drink coffee. Coffee's caffeine affects me badly, making me feel shaky and tense sometimes, whereas this yerba mate actually mellows me out physically while it picks me up mentally. For more information about how it works, check the article about yerba mate in Wikipedia, and pick up a bag of this for yourself. My only reservation about it is that I think it might be cheaper to buy it loose leaf in greater bulk than this package offers.

review/summary: A good addition to a tea-drinker's mix
review/text: I drink quite a bit of Tazo Thrive and Tazo Zen green teas.  Tazo Thrive is a nice mix of green tea, mate, and various botanicals.  My liking for this tea got me to try Mate.  I actually first tried a bottled version of unsweetened Guayaki Yerba Mate, which I like very much -- I always keep some bottles in my fridge in case I need to grab something quick on my way out the door and don't have time to heat water for tea.<br /><br />Hot Guayaki Yerba Mate is a different taste from the cold version, but as I understand it, is the more traditional way to drink mate.  In  any event, mate is a bit of an acquired taste, and it is one that I am acquiring.  It seems to taste better (as with many teas) if the water is not too hot -- steaming a bit but short of boiling, or allowed to cool somewhat.  In addition, one can't leave the bag in too long, as with many teas, or it will become excessively bitter.  Finally, I find that adding a bit of cool water after steeping the appropriate amount of time seems to make it taste less bitter and make it easier to drink.<br /><br />In any event, mate is supposedly good for appetite suppression, disproportionate to the amount of caffeine in it.  I'm not sure it is a powerful appetite suppression -- no more than green tea, in my opinion -- but as part of a regular hydration and tea-drinking regimen can only help with controlling those urges to eat.  It is certainly an invigorating drink -- again, more than the amount of caffeine in it would promise.<br /><br />I've not tried other mate versions, but I like this one so well that I've not been interested in trying others.

I don't like it as a first cup of the day too smoky but as the second cup  it is perfect and late at night it is reminiscent of a nice single malt. Definitely a sophisticated taste.

review/summary: A great way to wake up
review/text: After kicking a caffeine addiction I had nurtured for nearly 40 years, I was ready to find a tea that would not upset my stomach and that would help break through that groggy morning feeling.  Most teas make me a little nauseous or seem to fire up my heartburn not to mention their wake-up power was in caffeine still.  Doing some research I discovered the healthy aspects of yerba mate and decided to give it a try.  It does help to break through and give me a quick awake that lasts much longer than caffeine without the jitters and heartburn.  I do not think I would go so far as to say it is better than coffee at bringing me out of that groggy feeling - but it is certainly a different, milder and calmer kind of alert.  A cup of this in the morning and occasionally in the afternoon is all I generally need to keep me going and never once has heartburn or nausea set in afterwards.<br /><br />There are many other coffee substitutes out there, some do a fair job of matching coffee flavor, this is not a good choice for coffee flavor but it is the one best for the morning wake up.  Very good product.  Do some research because overuse of yerba mate has been linked with some health concerns but I would not worry with just a cup or two a day.

review/summary: Go for unsmoked mate instead
review/text: I totally love Yerba Mate.  Too much probably.  But some studies have shown that there is a connection between regular mate use and several types of cancers.  Another study found that mate has high concentrations of molecules associated with smoke that are known carcinogens.  Inference: it's most likely the smoking process that causes mate to be carcinogenic.  I know the smoked version takes better, but the unsmoked version ain't bad at all if you like the mate taste.  So do yourself a favor and find an unsmoked mate (I don't want to advertise --they're easy enough to find).  After a couple of pounds of unsmoked mate, you won't miss it.  But to be more safe, alternate mate with strong green tea like I do.

My order of 1 box came earlier than expected and they packed it like it was crystal...so funny.  Tried my first Tea Bag today. Surprisingly smooth.  The bag was much larger than an ordinary tea bag, and I like a weaker tea consistancy so I used it to brew 4 CUPS OF TEA.  Delicious and so mild...probably from my watered down version, but I am confident that even at a one cup strength it would be wonderfully smooth.  Forgot what Dr. Oz said it would help with...either stress or energy or maybe both....we'll see. I will try to find this at a lower price because of several of the reviews saying it was way too pricey on Amazon, but still glad I purchased it.

I had hoped that the milder tea bag version might warrant reconsideration, but mate is really just horrible stuff.  Both my husband and I describe the taste as dirty and pungent.  Guayaki's flavored mate's warrant some consideration if you want the health benefits, but I would stay away from the original unless you really are a mate fan.

review/text: I bought this for my son's girlfriend for Christmas.  I haven't heard from her if she's tried it, but my son says she keeps it in the dorm (as opposed to his apartment) so I guess she wants to have it more often!  That's a good sign, right?  I'd never heard of it until he mentioned that he bought her the "pot" (cooker/cup) for Christmas.  She's a Kinestheology Major, so maybe she's onto something...I might have to try it when we go visit them the next time.

review/text: This tea isn't too bad ... it tastes a little bit like hay.  The stuff I've gotten in the local Espresso Royale puts this tea to shame.  This could be a more traditional/real deal tea but I wouldn't know.  It just tastes a little bit off.
