review/summary: Delicious Turkish soup
review/text: I live in Turkey and like to try the local soups.  This one is a creamy cabage and carrot one.  It is really good and easy to make - just add 1 liter of water and cook 10-15 minutes.  I can highly recoment it, as it is my favorite of the the Knorr Turkish soups.

review/summary: Homemade is Best
review/text: There are a lot of inexpensive yogurts in the stores but I feel I want to make my own for many reasons.  It takes a little planning because the yogurt maker (also a Euro-Cuisine) needs 7 to 8 hours and I need to bring the milk up to proper temperature before adding the culture - but the end product is worth it.  As soon as I open a jar of the finished product I first smell it - you don't get that smell from the store brands.  This particular starter makes a 'thicker' variety like Greek yogurt and when you dip your spoon into it you see it.  Then the taste - there is a tang that I've never tasted in a store brand.  Most of the time I don't get around to adding any honey and grated lemon to it (my favorite) because if I start eating I can't stop.  The instructions are on the back of the packets and are easy to follow.  I like using whole organic milk from a local dairy so my experience is based on that - but I'm sure you get good results from low fat milk.  And I have also had success with allowing the yogurt maker to work over night - then I quickly refrigerate the jars in the morning to stop the culturing process.  For me it's not just about the cost it's more about the quality and sustainability of ingredients...it's food for my soul.

review/text: I've been making my own yogurt for quite a while now, but was pleasantly surprised when I tried this starter.  So far, it's the best I've tried, and I've tried quite a few.  My yogurt sets much more quickly, and has a nice creamy texture instead of the clumping I find with some other starters.  I've re-cultured five generations so far, and it's holding up wonderfully.  Wonderful light fresh taste.  Give it a try!

review/summary: Makes a nice yogurt, as promised
review/text: I have been making my own yogurt for a couple of years now and I needed a new starter.  I don't have any other brand to compare to, as my previous starters were finished yogurt from another batch.  I decided to start each Spring off with a fresh starter, so I bought this product and it performed nicely.  I reserve some from each batch to start the next batch and that works just fine too.

review/summary: NEEDS TO BE REFRIGERATED FOR STORAGE
review/text: I used this stuff successfully a number of times and started having failures.  The manufacturer's rep in L.A. told me that it is supposed to be refrigerated or the cultures "bloom" early and then don't work to make yogurt.  Well, the product is not sold nor warehoused under refrigeration, so who would have guessed?  The package does say "store refrigerated" but why the end-user only?  Could it possibly have "bloomed" before purchase?  The company does not stand behind the product for direct purchase; if  you are going to buy it, go to a retail store where you can return products that don't work.  I now use store-purchased natural yogurt for my starter, a bit of a pain, but no failures.

review/summary: Quality Starter
review/text: High quality yogurt starter that has consistently produced results.  Does not contain pectin.<br /><br />Starter packets contain sucrose, and I found that when I re-used a culture from one batch of yogurt to the next adding a tsp sugar helped create firmer yogurt.<br /><br />Yogurt is very sour and strong in flavor.  Firms to slightly softer than Dannon plain yogurt after 8 hours of culturing.  Yogurt is a perfect match for Mediterranean and Indian dishes, but may require some sugar to mix with fruit effectively.<br /><br />I have successfully made both whole milk and skim milk yogurt with this starter.  Whole milk was considerably firmer and easier to use in cooking.  Consider adding pectin if using skim milk if you intend to eat it out of the cup.

review/summary: Van Wyk Yogurt
review/text: This yogurt "starter" seems to be good stuff. The price of the yogurt starter seems to be a bit high, bringing home-made yogurt to the same cost as store bought. But the home-made yogurt is better for you because the store-bought yogurt is Pastureized after making the yogurt, thus destroying the friendly bacteria culture. This system starts with Pastureized milk but nothing is allowed to harm the friendly bacteria in the home-prepared version of the yogurt. After preparation, I mix mine with a tad of Sugar Twin and vanilla, sometimes adding some diced strawberries, blueberries or peaches.

review/summary: Excellent Yogurt
review/text: I used the instructions in the Euro Cuisine manual. If you make it straight it will be a looser yogurt, more like a yogurt drink and my husband says it tastes just like buttermilk.  If you want a store-bought thick yogurt, add dry milk powder per the instructions. I would recommend 3 to 5 tablespoons of dry milk powder (I used Organic Valley nonfat dry milk powder which is high quality) depending on the thickness you want.<br /><br />This culture is excellent and I would recommend it. I wish it would come in a higher quantity package, but probably keeping it at the amount it is keeps it fresher.

review/text: I bought this to start my home yogurt making process. I made it last night and just tasted my 1st yogurt. I made it with 1% organic milk and this thing is sour. I like a little sour kick to my yogurt but this thing is super sour. I was making this for my 2 year old daughter but I doubt she will eat this version. I probably have to modify and add some fruit or something sweet to make it appetizing for my girl. I am going to try with crushed granola bar and see if that will cut the sourness. I guess it does what it's suppose to do which is to turn milk into yogurt but not a very tasty one.

review/text: Just received my case, popped a can into the freezer, and within minutes was able to try it. As per other reviews, I don't taste a lot of tangerine, but more lime (but, with 7-Up, do you taste the lemon and lime separately?). Whatever, I've been looking for a Splenda-sweetened 7-Up-like soda for a long time, and I'm thrilled with this. Especially during this very long hot summer, it's going to be really refreshing, and I happily recommend it.

Just as important is flavor, and boy does this taste good! It delivers what you expect out of a soda - flavor without a syrup aftertaste.<br /><br />In one word: refreshing.

review/summary: Yummy soda!
review/text: I love soda, but don't want to consume too many calories or aspartame. The Diet Hansen's has been a great find for me! The diet tangerine lime is my favorite by far. It tastes like Fresca or sort of like Sprite.<br /><br />The only ingredient that I'm not thrilled about is "acesulfame potassium". Doing a quick search on it reveals that there is no evidence of it being a carcinogen (cancer causing agent), but long term studies haven't been done.  Here's a quick blurb about a study done with it: "This study investigates whether mother's exposure to the artificial sweetener acesulfame-K (AK) during pregnancy or lactation affected her adult offspring's sweet preference... Our data suggest that AK can be ingested by the prenatal or postnatal mice through their mother's amniotic fluid or breast milk, producing a long-dated function on the adult's sweet preference." [...]<br /><br />I realize that mice and humans are different. But studies may show long term that drinking this while your pregnant or breastfeeding may change your child's taste buds as they get older. Anyway, I will continue drinking this, but if I get pregnant I will stick with water and organic milk! I realize that to sweeten something without sugar there is something that has to give.

I won't purchase this product or any other from this seller again.

review/summary: The best K-Cup coffee there is
review/text: When I first got my Cuisinart K-cup machine, I tried every flavor coffee available, buying the various sampler packs and so on. Making coffee suddenly became fun!<br /><br />First thing I found out 'Extra Bold' means enough in the K-cup to make a car mug (10 oz) of coffee instead of a teacup, and that most of the coffees are pretty average, else bitter.<br /><br />Newman's is medium strong, 'Extra Bold' (20% more in K-cup), smooth and not bitter, and the best of the bunch. The price is in line with the others, too, while some brands charge more just for the brand name.<br />Buying bulk at Amazon sure beats the tiny 12 packs at the grocery store. There is nothing worse for a coffee drinker than running out of morning coffee!<br /><br />I like most of Newman's other products, finding them better than the other comparable products at the local chain grocery stores, and the coffee is also equal or better than the competition in terms of quality and taste. Their buyers, tasters, and marketers are obviously doing something right.<br /><br />A large percentage of Newman's profits all goes to charity, too.<br /><br />So if you love Newman's sauces and dressings, and like Starbucks coffees, you will love Newman's Coffee.

review/summary: It's Adequate
review/text: I purchased this item to replace some Savannah Bee Company Tupelo Honey that I had received as a gift and thought was simply delicious.  I thought "tupelo honey should be all the same since it comes from the same flowers" and I was most certainly wrong.  This honey is a step above your standard wildflower honey found at the supermarket, but many steps below the likes that Savannah Bee Company (and I hear Langnese) make.<br /><br />I'll try to describe it as best I can in comparison with Savannah Bee(since it's the only other I've had):  It is mildly "buttery" and darker than Savannah's(Savannah has a more buttery flavor and texture).  It still is pleasant tasting and sweet and mixes well with tea (my primary use); you don't find a glob of honey at the bottom of your cup.  Neither of the two brands even hinted at crystallizing while I had them.<br /><br />Tropic Bee is a decent honey, but if you're looking for the best tasting one out there don't just settle for this one.<br /><br />Hopefully this is helpful to someone; I seem to find honey hard to describe.

review/summary: Tropic Bee vrs Savannah Bee
review/text: Yes, there is a distinct difference in taste between Tropic Bee and Savannah Bee Company's Tupelo Honey.  Tropic Bee is a raw unfiltered honey with a distinctive Tupelo taste.  Savannah Bee Company's honey is refined and has only a very faint, almost indistinguishable, Tupelo taste.  If you like the Tupelo taste, which is unlike any other honey, then you definitely want Tropic Bee's honey.  If you want a refined, mellow-tasting honey, then Savannah Bee Company's honey can't be beat.  I love both - but I have to say that I think of Tropic Bee as being real Tupelo Honey, whereas Savannah Bee Company's is just great honey.  Neither one will crystallize, which is a honey-lover's dream come true.

review/text: I prefer stong coffee but my husband does not like it quite so strong.  It works well for me.  The way he made it work for him, he makes a cup and a half and that suits him.  It also makes the KCup last twice as long!

review/summary: Green Mountain compared with Tully's French Roast
review/text: Out of curiosity I compared with side-by-side with Tully's French Roast k-cups.  These Green Mountain k-cups do not have quite the full bodied flavor of Tully's.  Both k-cups are good, but if you're going after a French Roast with the most full spectrum and thickness of flavor then I'd recommend Tully's French Roast k-cups.

review/summary: My FAVORITE K-Cup
review/text: French roast my green mountain is my favorite every day K-cup. Its a good coffee... bold yet smooth. NOT BURNT (I hate Peets and Starbucks because they taste like the burn the beans). If you like the nasty burnt taste, these probably are not for you. If you want a well balanced, bold, smooth everyday coffee these K-Cups will work!

review/summary: Tastes like...
review/text: If you love super dark, rich, bold and thick flavored coffee then this is the coffee for you...with one problem.  Personally I love coffee that embodies everything I just said.  I love esspresso and the like.  To find a K-cup that is this bold even on the 10 oz. setting is great...but there is that problem again...<br /><br />It smells, tastes, and leaves the after taste of burnt urine!  Like someone torched a public restroom and mopped the floor with coffee, then packaged it. Yum!<br /><br />There are other dark, bold k-cups out there that have a better smell, flavor and does not have a nasty after taste. You may not believe me, and that is fine, but get a sample pack before going for the 24, you'll thank me later. Try the Green Mountain Coffee Extra Bold Sumatran Reserve K-Cups. Better all around cup of coffee.

review/summary: WOW.....Plump bean with lots of pulp, aroma and flavor.....
review/text: I never knew that India even produced vanilla beans until now.  I came across this when I was looking for something other than Madagascar vanilla beans.  With $1.50 a bean and free shipping, there was nothing to lose.  It came vacuum-sealed in a plastic pack.  It was more plump than the skinny ones you get at your grocery store - even the good brands.  With my new Cuisinart ice cream maker, I could think of only one thing: Vanilla Bean Ice cream.  And I slit the bean, there came - lots of pulp.  Usually what you get with 2 or 1.5 beans.  I scalded the milk & cream with this pulp and the bean, made the base and ripened the custard base.  The next day, my custard was heady with vanilla aroma and lots of specks from the bean.  OMG....The ice cream was the BEST EVER - Dear Haagen Dazs, please move.  I'm now thinking of buying in sets of 3 or 6.  Also, it is highly recommended to store beans in glass jars at room temperature in dark place. And the shipping was prompt and fast.  THANKS BEANILLA.  You opened the door to a whole new world of aroma and flavor.

review/summary: Wonderful taste and color, without bitterness. Superb tea!
review/text: I am 56 years old, a Lancastrian and a lifelong 'strong' tea drinker. I am also a former owner of two very decent restaurants and tea rooms in a popular tourist area in the UK.<br /><br />Being fussy about taste, preferring strong brews, but disliking bitterness, I had always considered Taylor's English Breakfast Tea to be my favourites among bagged teas. That is, until I discovered Punjana Irish Breakfast tea! At $3.50 for a box of 80 bags in a local overstock store (Big Lots), although I'd never heard of the brand, I figured it was worth taking a chance. I didn't expect anything special - I was simply stocking up on UK tea without paying the outrageous price typically charged here in Indiana for UK brands.<br /><br />From the very first pot I made, this tea has been a revelation! Whether by the cup or the pot, it brews VERY quickly (under two minutes suits my taste), with a rich tan color, with some orange brightness. When drinking, it exhibits no bitterness, even if steeped for more than twice that time - far beyond the point where Twinings and Taylors become bitter and wasted. I really only drink tea with 'milk,' (for tea I use almond milk unsweetened, not dairy, as I am vegan), but I tried this with fresh lemon and it was equally delicious. Fabulous taste indeed. I will be sure to stock up on Punjana now, whenever I find it - this is the best tea I have EVER tasted, by quite some margin. Buy some - you won't regret it.

review/summary: Surprising and Amazing!
review/text: I picked this up from Ocean State Job Lot for $3.99 and realized I'm in love with Irish Breakfast.<br />Its pretty strange to love a cup of black tea with just a lemon, and to brew black tea for under 3 minutes!<br />The tea has quite high tannin content, so if you let it sit for a while it will get cloudy... probably why most Irish drink tea with milk!<br />Despite the surprise at the effect of the tannins, its pretty much the only fool proof cup of tea, regardless of the quality of water, you'll be sure to enjoy!<br />Pick up a pack.. you won't regret it!

review/text: I am a lifelong tea drinker--mostly iced and I love a deeply flavorful tea---this is it.  I first found this tea at a liquidation store in Austin, Texas, decided to try it, and fell in love.  It is the best tea I've ever experienced.  I make it bold and strong and it is wonderful, refreshing, and relaxing.  I sent an email to the company to let them know how much I love it and they sent me a thank-you note and a teacup from Ireland!!  This is a quality product, made by dedicated people and I am ecstatic to have made the discovery.

review/summary: Good Ingredients; Jack Russell loves it.
review/text: My dog absolutely devoured his food with this on it. This product contains just about every known ingredient available for joint health. In case you are like me, and want to know what's in your pet's products, here's the list (amounts are per serving, 60 servings per container):<br /><br />Glucosamine (from shellfish), 500 mg.<br />Algae from spirulina & alfalfa, 285 mg.<br />MSM, 250 mg.<br />Herbal blend: Meadowsweet, Stinging Nettle, Ginger, Turmeric, & Bromelain (the bromelain is a proteolytic enzyme) concentrated 210 mg,(1100 mg crude herb equivalent)<br />Green Mussel extract, 100 mg.<br />Omega blend from wild salmon, cod, and tuna oil, 75 mg.<br />Inactive ingredients: cinnamon, cloves, sweet salmon flavor, flax, silica, barley malt.<br /><br />If you have done any research into these ingredients you know that it's a great combination. I can't tell you how effective it is, because I got it for prevention rather than treatment. My Jack Russel Terrier just reached senior status in dog years and I want him to keep his joints healthy!<br /><br />And now I'll get to what I feel is an important consideration....My main reason for giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because there is a statement on the label that says "For use in dogs only". I don't like to give my dog anything unless it is fit for human consumption (I order his dog food online). The 'for dogs only' statement makes me wonder if the omegas 3's are processed properly, and if the flax is fresh (it becomes rancid easily). These are things even humans need to be aware of when shopping in a health food store. I'll give this product the benefit of the doubt since my dog loves it so much, but that statement is an eyebrow raiser for me.<br />Oh, one more thing...as the jar says, turmeric can be a little hard on the stomach, so make sure you give with food then watch your dog for signs of stomach discomfort. Most dogs should be able to tolerate it. It is a Great anti-inflammatory & has numerous other health benefits. (google it!)

review/summary: Healthy Motion Powder
review/text: I have an eleven year old Labrador retriever that weighs about 65 pounds and we administered 1 � tablespoons a day.<br />He has hip problems, and spends a lot more time just laying down than he used to.<br /><br /> The container is half full after opening and it smells like a light grassy herbal tea and the powder looks like dirt.<br />The flavor is salmon which my dog was not too happy about. When I sprinkle it on his food, he mournfully looks up at me as if to say "I don't know what I did, but I am SO sorry.  Why are you ruining my food?" He will stare at his food for several minutes and walk by the cats and "ask" if they are finished yet. Eventually, he'll give in and eat his own food - which is good because I have seen results.<br /><br />I've noticed that he has a bit more pep in his step. He seems happier and doesn't lie down as much. This was especially noticeable on bath day. When it's time for his bath (and he ALWAYS knows) he won't come when I call. He'll just lay there and stare at me with bleary eyes - even if I slide his motionless body all the way to door, like he's Ghandi or something. After a few weeks of motion powder, he came trotting along - ready for bath time.<br /><br />And instead morosely marching onto the driveway, ready for his walk, he comes galumphing out of the house and will even run around the block for a bit (which he hasn't done in years). If only they made this stuff in a more palatable flavor. What kind of dog eats salmon? It should be chicken, liver or beef flavored instead. I also think it would be better if it came with a scoop and in pellet form because the powder would fall to the bottom of the bowl. I think my dog would enjoy this with his food more.<br /><br />Despite my glowing praise - this is NOT some fountain of youth for your dog. My dog still tires quickly and still loves laying around. However, I think it makes the little things in his life a bit easier for him. And after all, it's the little things in life that matter.

review/summary: My Dogs LOVE the Flavor - And It Works
review/text: I have a 7 year-old Border Collie mix, Abbey, who has arthritic knees.  She had bilateral arthroscopic knee surgery about a year and a half ago to remove broken bone fragments in her joints. Our vet instructed me to give her an oral glucosamine supplement for the rest of her life.  Abbey also gets a glucosamine injection, Adequan, every other week. My vet allows me to administer it myself (at home) to save on vet bills.<br /><br />The injection turned out to be the simple part. Abbey hated the glucosamine supplement we got from our vet. I had to wrap it in cheese or something, and she usually spit it out once or twice before it went down.  She tends to be a little overweight, so the added calories from cheese and other disguises were a negative.  I tried several different brands of glucosamine tablets, and she refused every one.<br /><br />A couple of months ago, my local Petco had a close-out sale on Healthy Motion, so I thought we'd give it try.  I opened it and immediately noticed the spicy scent. It smells kind of like Indian food spices.  To my great surprise, Abbey and two other dogs came looking before I opened their wet food.  It turns out that three of my four dogs PREFER the Healthy Motion-sprinkled food to their otherwise identical wet & dry mixed dinner.<br /><br />It works! After using it for 2-3 weeks, I noticed that Abbey has more energy and is moving better. Finally, something that is both effective and palatable to her.  She looks forward to it and licks up every speck.

review/text: My wife and I have 13 dogs, half of whom are older, and several of whom have severe arthritis. While my wife, who is a pet nutritionist, likes the ingredients, she doesn't like the price. That's why I had to give GreenDog Naturals four instead of five stars. If you can afford it, this powder seems to appeal when mixed with your dog's normal food. It also seems to help our older dogs move better after several weeks of use.

She really doesn't like the taste of it, she eats her food with the powder on it almost begrudgingly.

If this were in a tablet or even liquid (like a tincture) form, it would be a five star review.

review/summary: Dog doesn't mind the taste, haven't noticed a huge change.
review/text: I have a 20# Boston Terrier (a breed known for knee joint issues) so I thought this would be a good product to try with her. Unfortunately, after using for over a month, I haven't seen any specific and obvious improvements. However, to be honest, she wasn't currently experiencing any issues when I started her on the powder, so I am using it as preventative care. She doesn't seem to mind the taste at all and even though it's going on dry food, she still manages to ingest most of it. I use it probably 4-5 times a week and have been giving her 1 tsp a time and we still have quite a bit of the powder left...so for us it's not that bad of a deal. We will probably buy continue buying it off and on as she gets older and/or has actual knee issues (which come and go with her level of activity).
