review/summary: Love this stuff!!
review/text: If you are used to the dark brown, coarse ground flaxseed, do yourself a favor and try this golden flax.  Wonderful!!!  I got it a week ago and have already tried it in smoothies, bread, muffins and oatmeal.  It is very finely ground, which makes it all but disappear.  Much better than what I was eating before!  And the value was far greater than the grocery store.  Highly recommend!

review/summary: closure
review/text: This is a good product. A bit overpriced at the cost as  you really need to shop around. The one thing i do not like is the zipper closire could be built better. too many times, i have thought i had closed it well enough to find it popped open sitting on the shelve. Can't keep "critters" out that way. It seems that the milled flax is gatting caught in the seal and prevents for a proper seal. They need to revamp this seal.<br /><br />Not sure if i will buy it again as i have transferred the product to a quart size jar that i can screw on the top. Lose the product info (i went and taped it to the outside.) but I know the seal stays that way.

review/summary: Always get cold milled!  Great for keto/low carb/atkins dieters
review/text: I bought this at Costco years ago and would use it occasionally as a mix in for my yogurt (they were demonstrating that way and were selling it as a fiber supplement).<br /><br />Then my boyfriend went on the keto diet.  And he now uses this stuff like crazy since he can't eat bread.  He has recipes for muffins, pizzas, and so on...I have to admit the chocolate muffins really ARE awesome (stevia, cocoa powder, flax, egg, butter to avoid carbs) even though I am not on a low carb diet and have no such restrictions.  So it's awesome stuff...very good for you too if you need extra fiber.<br /><br />To clarify it does have carbs but almost all of it is indigestible fiber so most diets don't count it.  (It does also have calories...that's mostly from the flax oil)<br /><br />However, you MUST buy cold milled if you're planning on storing it long term and not refrigerating.  As I said, the first package I had of this lasted years.  Cold milled is milled so that the flax doesn't heat up as it's ground.  This is important because otherwise the oils break down and it will spoil in a few weeks.  Cold milled has a MUCH longer shelf life.<br /><br />Flax USA tastes great, stays good, and at this size is a good deal.

review/text: After reading all the "healthy benefits" of using flaxseed, I bought this product to add to my morning smoothie.  Like all healthy products you buy them with high expectations but I personally can't see any change.  It does mix well in my smoothie and I'll continue to purchase this product. Not knocking flaxseed...it's just another health food to add to your diet. As I get older I continue to eat healthier and that's got to be a good thing.

review/text: Gold is way better than brown flax seed, even if it is a mental thing. I add a scoop to my protein shakes, and you hardly notice a taste. The only reason I like this better than brown is it is visually more appealing when drinking. Just make sure you drink it quickly because it will thicken after a few min.

review/text: A friend of the family gave us some Bob's Red Mill whole flaxseed, and so I went looking for it on Amazon. Found this instead for a cheaper price--plus it's already ground for you! The product is fine, but the packaging is not; it's definitely not resealable. I must have tried thirty different times to seal that bag, and it wouldn't take. Thankfully we had some containers around to store it in, but it's rather inconvenient, especially with such a large quantity.

review/text: I use it everyday in my protein shakes, and I the subtle nutty flavor is great! When I add it into my oatmeal, it tends to thicken, so I end up adding a little water to it. I haven't had any problems with the seal like other reviews here. I still have about 1/8 of a bag left, and I bought it at Cosco mid-February. It lasts a long time! I store mine in the fridge. Implementing the ground flax into your diet is an easy and great way to add extra nutrients without a whole lot of calories, or sacrifice of flavor. Very satisfied.

review/summary: I'll take the orchid please!
review/text: Bought this tea as a result of being captured by a salesperson who made it impossible to say "no" and I am 100% to blame.  Never been a pushover but now, I have joined the club.  This tea is terrific and that is all that is important.  Our family has about 7-10 teas available at any one time and the Shanghai Orchid is a great "accent tea" to the plain teas...take a straight jasmine pearl or the Darjeeling or the silver needle and add some of the Orchid...wow!  The smell of flowers translates to taste beautifully.  Of course the price is high and I find it is confusing to purchase tea in the shop because of the "ounce" pricing...however if you use this tea as an accent rather than a straight tea, the idea is it will last longer.  My favorite is using this tea with any plan jasmine.  Amazing!

review/text: These are excellent treats that I would recommend to almost any dog owner. After purchasing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CI9X4">Bil-Jac Little Jacs Liver Treats</a> while in a rush at the store, and then reading the ingredients list, I knew that I didn't want to purchase anything with additives and low-grade chicken any more! My wife and I picked these up at a pet store and so far we have been quite pleased!<br /><br />PROS<br />- Contains NO chicken by-products*<br />- Contains no wheat**<br />- Perfect size for puppies, small dogs or training<br />- Also available at pet stores<br /><br />CONS<br />- A tad pricey<br />- Give some dogs loose stools<br /><br />*While this product doesn't contain chicken by-products, don't be fooled into thinking that it contains high-grade chicken. This is definitely better than most dog treats, but it's not on par with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CR41KQ">Newman's Own Organic Chicken Treats</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TL2XN4">Flint River Ranch Dog Treats</a>, that use human-grade meat and poultry.<br /><br />**Some dogs are allergic to wheat. If your dog has allergies or even is beginning to show symptoms, wheat should be the first thing you cut out. Many MANY foods contain it as a filler, and many allergies are traced back to it.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />These are a little pricey, but you are paying for a healthy, nutritious treat, not some WalMart-grade by-product infused junk. If you care about your dog, you need to feed them with the best food and treats available, and these Chicken Bits are a great place to start!

review/text: The best balsamic vinegar for the money, bar none.  I have used balsamic vinegar for over twenty years along with regular red wine vinegars for my different salads, but until I found Academia Barilla I had no idea what a difference an aged, thick, dense, aromatic vinegar could make. It comes the closest to privately made balsamic vinegar I've enjoyed in Modena, Italy. Compared to other "industrially made" vinegars that are watery, transparent, lacking in intensity, and, needless to say, much cheaper, Academia Barilla is superior to all of them for its artisanal quality. Unless one wants to pay anywhere from 30 to 100 dollars for artisanal balsamic vinegar from Modena, Academia Barilla at slightly over 10 dollars is definitely worth the price.

review/summary: Healthy, Light White Whole Wheat Flour
review/text: If you're looking for a healthy, light whole wheat flour to cook with, a nutritionist recommended KING ARTHUR'S WHITE WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR. It has the nutrition of whole wheat with the consistency of white flour--so it's not too heavy and gritty.  I make gravies, soups, muffins, pancakes, cookies etc.--everything with it.  I'll never buy white non-nutritious flour again! I never feel guilty cooking with this as I know it's healthy for my family and provides necessary whole grains. I love cooking with this flour and use it all the time.

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: I was skeptical of this product at first; I thought it was a gimmick, maybe white flour with some bran added. But this is real whole wheat, made from a softer wheat than regular WW flour. I use it all the time because it is virtually identical in mouth feel to white flour but has all the nutrition of whole grain. If you're trying to convert your family to whole grains, try mixing it 50/50 with white flour. Because this flour is nearly white, they probably won't even notice. It works equally well in yeast breads, quick breads, and even cookies, but I'd use WW pastry flour for cakes. Like all KA products, it is top quality.

review/summary: Not impressed
review/text: I bought this gum at Fred Meyer today because it looked good and I've never seen it before. I usually buy the "Tropical Twist" by Trident and love that flavor, so I thought this would turn out to be good also. Both packs have pictures of oranges and a few other fruits on them, so I figured they'd be comparable. I chew gum a lot to try and prevent me from snacking when I'm not really hungry and because I have read in numerous places that chewing sugar free gum is good for your teeth.<br /><br />So, here's the scoop. The flavor is a 2.5/5, not nearly as yummy as the tropical one. I timed how long the flavor lasts and I got about 7 minutes out of it before I was anxiously searching for a garbage can to throw it out in. The aftertaste wasn't  horrible, but wasn't great either.  Bottom line, I give it a try and now I'm going to try and pawn this pack of gum off on my co-workers and keep chewing the "Tropical Twist" and "Bubblegum" flavors.

review/summary: Chicken water
review/text: This soup has a few shreds of chicken meat in each can- hardly "chunks" as the label proclaims. Also, the bulk of the soup only takes up about a fifth of the can and the broth tastes like mildly salinated water. Organic or not, this soup is a total rip-off.

review/summary: Sweet Treat...
review/text: I ordered this to use in my popcorn machine.  I was uneasy about how the kettle would handle this product, but since I have a great kettle cleaner I went ahead and ordered it.  I am sure glad that I did because this is FABULOUS!  It leaves no mess in the kettle at all.  When it starts to pop the first kernels that come out are the best coated ones and then as more pop they get less coated, but if you mix them all together I think you get great flavor.  Just remember this is a sticky coating when it first comes out so unpopped kernels stick to the popped ones so watch out for those.  Still a great tasting product that I will keep purchasing...  It is very sweet, but I love it all the same.

review/summary: sweet and spicy tea
review/text: I love pumpkin (cookies, pie, frappachinos!) so I didn't hesitate to order this tea when I discovered it. It is a good tea, and it made a DELICIOUS chai tea latte. However, it's not really pumpkin flavored. The tea relies on pumpkin pie spices like cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, etc., so it smells like pumpkin pie but doesn't quite taste like it. If it had actual pumpkin flavor with those spices, it would be perfect and five stars. Never-the-less, the tea is spicy and delicious with a nice twist on the traditional chai flavor. Recommended.

review/text: Okay, so it doesn't taste exactly like pumpkin.  It does sort of have a pumpkin essence, however.  Maybe it just sort of smells pumpkin-y.  Either way, the tea is delicious.  My co-workers tease me about how many cups a day of it that I drink.  Personally, I like it with a packet of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0025UC2DQ">Truvia,Natura's Calorie-Free Sweetener  1  Ounce Packages (Pack of 400)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019LWUJI">NuNaturals Nustevia Nocarbs Blend, 50 Packets</a>.<br /><br />As far as the comment another reviewer made about the black tea tasting like Lipton's, maybe that makes it more authentic.  It is said that chai tea was first created in India to make undrinkable tea bearable.

I could taste the black tea more then the flavor it was printed on the box. The taste of the black tea was simular to that of a regular box of Lipton Tea, which I really do not like at all. I really would not suggest this tea to anyone.

They should not even be called bagels - they have none of the properties of a bagel - not the taste, texture, or quality.

I ended up giving them to the dog. I'll stick w/the regular ones....

I thought they had the same consistency as a regular bagel.  The bagels were good both toasted and plain.  They are also great to use as sandwiches either for breakfast or as a meal.  I love regular bagels so I was happy to find these that are less calories and carbs than a regular bagel.  I was able to try the plain version and the everything version and enjoyed both very much.  I will definitely be buying more in the future.

review/summary: Thomas Bagel Thins Plain
review/text: I am a Bzz Agent and received a coupon for a free package of Thomas Bagel Thins.  At first I was skeptical of trying them.  When a product claims to be low in calories, usually taste is sacrificed.  I didnn't find this to be the case with Thomas Bagel Thins.  I love bagels but have not purchased any in a long time because they are not neccessarily a good morning breakfast item (meaning they have a high calorie count).  I tried these and they tasted just like a bagel would taste, granted you get a little less, but you don't lose the taste.  If you like to toast your bagels, you need half the time that it requires to toast a regular bagel or you might burn them.  Overall a great product with great taste.

review/text: I am a Bzz Agent.  I received a coupon to try a package of these Thomas Bagel Thins for free.  I buy regular bagels quite often.  I got a package of the plain bagel thins.  I would say the taste is similar to the regular bagels.  What I like about them is the reduced amount of calories (only 110 calories per bagel).  They are also presliced which is a nice convenience and makes it so easy to toast and prepare. I would recommend these for anyone who likes bagels and/or wants to watch their caloric intake.

Nothing seemed to make more sense than this small bonsai, or money, tree.  I was a bit skeptical about purchasing a tree online, but it came very carefully packaged and in excellent condition.  We followed the directions and I waited to write my review just in case something went wrong.  But he has had this tree in the office next to a window for about 2 months now and it still looks just as nice, if not nicer, than the day we got it.  And that's saying a lot since no other plants at our house have managed to live this long.

I would like the plant a bit smaller, but overall, I think this will make a really nice gift.  I would definitely purchase another one.

review/summary: 3 out of 4 were good.
review/text: I bought two of these as gifts for my dad and brother and LOVED them so I bought another for my mom and she LOVED hers.<br />Our neighbor loved my mom's tree so I got one for her too but I recently found out that when she got it it had little tiny white spots and the leaves were very dull. It's now falling apart. I'm pretty unhappy about this. I was actually getting ready to buy another one for a friend. I hope the company will reimburse me or provide me with a new tree for my neighbor. If so, I will continue to purchase the trees.

I sent this tree to a friend of mine just after the new year.  Unfortunately, it was subzero here in Missouri at that time and the (first) tree did not survive the harsh conditions while in transit.  I sent the nursery an e-mail asking that a replacement tree be sent.  Lou (the owner) was very responsive and immediately sent another tree!!!  Wonderful, my friend loves it!!!  Excellent customer service, I highly recommend this company!

review/summary: Awesome, healthy plant
review/text: I have had this plant for several months and was sorry to see that it is no longer offered through Brussel's at Amazon.  I have sent several friends to Amazon to order the plant as they love it when they see mine.  It arrived healthy and has remained healthy over the months.  I originally ordered this plant because I had received two from Red Envelope which arrived quite sickly.  I had ordered them as gifts and had to return them to R.E.  I was quite pleased when this one arrived from Brussel's.  I ordered a lucky bamboo from Amazon/Brussel's and it also arrived healthy and is thriving several months later.  I highly recommend this company.

Unfortunately there was no zero for a rating.  I got a beautiful diamond necklace, he got a very sick looking tree.

There are more exotic chews, more "hip" chews, newer chews, chewier chews, and bubblier chews, but Super Bubble pulls it all together in one, enduring, classic gum.<br /><br />Super Bubble has better texture, and maintains its delicious flavor longer and more effectively than any other Bubble Gum.  It's a perfect balance between firm and soft, and it doesn't disentegrate in your mouth like so many of the other brands.<br /><br />It's the Cadillac brand of bubble gum!

review/summary: Only wish the flavor lasted longer.
review/text: This has been my favorite bubble gum since junior high in Plano, Texas. As kids we collected soda bottles and returned them at the 7-11 for welcome small change and one of the items I always bought was Super Bubble! This gum is what bubble gum should taste like. It even smells like it should. The 300 pack plus 40 free piece box seems to be the best deal on Amazon for this gum which is great since the only bags I seems to find sold locally include the grape and sour apple gum. I am not one of the kind of people that can chew the same piece of gum for hours on end until it has no taste at all, so the only wish I had was that the taste would somehow magically last longer. It is also a great bubble gum for blowing bubbles, HOWEVER, just because you can, doesn't mean you should. Please don't be like the cow I work with that pops and snaps her gum all night long. It's annoying and not very attractive.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007STCYK">Super Bubble Box Original 300 pack Plus 40 Free Bonus Pieces, Total 340</a>

review/text: I was very pleased by the ingredient list and the quality of this chocolate. It retains the benefits of being a superfood without the worry if the other ingredients will offset the nutrition you are getting from the chocolate.<br /><br />Very smooth and pleasant taste, not overly candy tasting. Perfect blend of tadte and nutition. These bars are a bit high on the price scale at roughly 5 a piece, but you get what you pay for.<br /><br />I originally ordered them for valentines day, but have reordered since at the request of my girlfriend who is a chocoholic.

My 18 lb dog, moderately active, eats 2/3 cup of the food a day. It is a chunkier product than the Grandma Lucy's Artisan line. Also, it doesn't contain white potatoes, which I don't like to feed my dog. I use Dog Food Advisor's website and this food is rated 5 stars on there... Great for pups with allergies to grains, etc.

review/text: My dogs go crazy for this stuff.  In our house it is called 'sprinkles' - for dinner she has kibble with about a quarter cup of 'sprinkles'.  Add warm water, stir and you will have one happy dog.  It smells good and when one of the dogs was sick, this was the only thing she would eat.  The cats even try to get some!  Lot's of chicken in this food.  The chickpeas add fiber to the diet making it easier to pick up after the dog on walks too.  It's pricey, but if you use it to supplement kibble it can last a long time.

You just pour it over chicken or steak and put them in the oven or grill them. We love to make kabobs and this is a great sauce for them. I haven't tried it on pork or anything else, but we get compliments on it everytime we use it for guests.
