review/text: tastes like a failed willy wonka experiment from the 80s made when the oompa loompas went on strike then repackaged as this salad dressing because to dump the vats of this syruppy concoction would be tantamount to the worst environmental tragedy in history. tastes like diabetes wrapped in a coma surrounded by a diabetic coma lying sideways in fanta strawberry soda if it got up and walked onto your otherwise perfect salad and grimaced at you.

review/text: While I don't think this makes my homemade coffee drinks taste just like the Pumpkin Spice drink offered by Starbucks, I do think it's very good.  It may be my favorite syrup for home use because it really tastes like pumpkin pie filling.  I also love to put it into my soymilk.  Silk makes Pumpkin Soymilk, but it's seasonal and hard to find in my area, not to mention expensive.  I add two or three pumps of Torani Pumpkin Pie Syrup to a glass of Vanilla Silk soymilk and made something very close for less $$$.

review/summary: A *must-have* household staple
review/text: This sauce is medium heat for everyday use.  It has an excellent roasted pepper flavor, and there is *NO VINEGAR* to get in the way.  Consequently, you get exactly what one should expect from a pepper sauce...versatility and flavor that does not try to smother the character of the food you season with it.<br /><br />An every-day sauce should not leave a patina on your tongue.  This is not a boutique novelty, it's a household staple.  The 32 oz. size is the right size for a hot sauce household.<br /><br />You want good?  Try Tapatio on cottage cheese.  You'll never eat cottage cheese any other way again, I promise.<br /><br />I use it on just about anything except cereal and ice cream, but my personal favorite applications of Tapatio are:<br /><br />eggs<br />potatoes<br />pizza<br />anything creole (forget tabasco!)<br />cottage cheese<br />most rice<br />mac cheese<br />and of course...Mex<br /><br />In my opinion, this is the best sauce in your local grocery store.

review/summary: If there were any more stars to give that 5 stars...
review/text: I would give it.  This hot sauce is the best hot sauce that has ever been made with human hands.  To compare this to Tabasco is an utter mockery, but that is the most common "hot sauce" that most Americans have experienced, so that is the one that I will compare it to.  Anyone that would try to genuinely compare the two should have a CAT scan done.  A 7 out of 10 as far as hotness, Tapatio can go on anything that you need to make spicy and tasty.  Try putting a couple of squirts of this Mexican nectar in a bag of Doritos and you WILL NOT be able to put them down.  Buy the 32 oz. size, you will not regret it!

review/summary: Best hot sauce I've ever tasted
review/text: This is without a doubt the best-tasting hot sauce I've ever had. I first encountered this sauce at a Mexican restaurant, among the other condiments on the table, and decided the cheap, simple-looking logo and foreign-sounding name merited a try for curiosity's sake. Boy, am I glad! I'm so used to the tongue-scathing, vinegary sourness of brands like Texas Pete and Frank's RedHot. This was so refreshing, it tastes so peppery and flavorful. The heat is definitely still there, but not overpowering like other sauces I've tried. I highly recommend giving this hot sauce a try.

review/summary: Absolute Favorite Hot Sauce
review/text: Have tried many hot sauces over the years, but Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce is my favorite. After my local grocery discontinued it, I was bereft. Was so very pleased to discover that I could order it through Amazon. The first listed ingredient is chili peppers (in contrast to so many whose primary ingredient seems to be vinegar); it is hot without be mouth-numbingly so. It really is a delightful addition to a Bloody Mary (but, I must admit, I use it on many, many other things, from scrambled eggs to tostadas to all kinds of soups). I purchased this product from Amazon through Mex-Grocer; recently one of my shipments was lost in transit. They were so very great about following through, rectifying the situation, and apologizing that I wouldn't consider ordering from anyone else in the future. Would have to admit that I am somewhat addicted to this salsa.

review/text: I like spicy food, but usually avoid <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001R6HC2A">Tabasco</a>-like hot sauce because it tastes like I poured vinegar over my food.<br /><br />Tapatio is not made with vinegar. As a result, the hot sauce adds flavor instead of taking away.<br /><br />In fact, it may taste too good. The heat has a way of sneaking up on you. I'd say it is about as hot as Tabasco, but you won't notice the heat at first.<br /><br />Tapatio is hands down the best hot-sauce available and I use to to add flavor to everything from pizza to spaghetti to mac and cheese.

review/summary: A nice blend. Medium heat - not too much vinegar and a smart buy in the 32 oz size
review/text: I really like this sauce. It is a great blend! While there is nothing truly remarkable about it - more importantly - it has no obvious flaws.  It simply has a nicely balanced flavor and that alone is quite rare in hot sauces!!!! This sauce could or should be a staple in any kitchen.  I'm glad to have a bottle in my pantry.<br /><br />I would rate this sauce somewhere between mild and medium hot. You'll need more than a couple of drops but not much more than that to generate some heat in any dish. Compared to Tabasco's original you'll need about twice the number of drops.<br /><br />Ingredients (as copied from the label): Water, Red Peppers, Salt, Spices, Garlic, Acetic Acid (a component of vinegar), etc ......<br /><br />Note the relatively low level of vinegar within the sauce. That is a good thing. The type of red pepper is unknown but there is a natural sweetness to this sauce which I find quite pleasant. That sweetness balances nicely against the heat. View this sauce as a superior alternative to a very common benchmark - the original Tabasco hot sauce.<br /><br />Minor flaws: There is a bit too much salt in this sauce but that only becomes evident when used in an already heavily salted dish. For example: This is not the best choice for a Bloody Mary due to the heavily salted nature of most vegetable/tomato juices.<br /><br />Since this sauce is available in 5 oz, 10 oz and 32 oz sizes - you'd be wise to pick up the 32oz size given the fact that it often costs little more than the smaller sizes.<br /><br />This is a fine basic hot sauce with a natural sweetness to it. This sauce is worthy of being a staple in any kitchen. It is better than most. What it lacks is that rare sense of freshness and, as noted, there is also a bit too much salt.

review/summary: Great product, quick shipping
review/text: I received this product from a friend of mine who is from AZ and immediately fell in love with it.  It's slightly thicker than Tabasco and Trappey's, but not as sour, and with a little bit more heat.  It goes well with almost EVERYTHING.  So, I knew what to expect.<br /><br />I bought two large bottles.  The seller shipped the package quickly, except that the cap on one of the bottles was loose, so the hot sauce leaked a little bit; otherwise, I would have given them 5 stars.  But that won't stop me from buying from them again next time I run out.<br /><br />Highly recommend to those who want a little bit of heat, without having too much of a vinegar base.

review/summary: A favorite hot sauce
review/text: For well over a year, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce has set itself apart from the others and has become a favorite.  When I was given a bottle of this hot sauce for the first time, as far as I remember, I was just expecting a typical hot sauce--this is not typical hot sauce.  It is hotter than the other hot sauces that I like, but it is not overpowering and does not have a searing heat--more like a peppery heat.  In addition, Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce has a pleasing, exceptional flavor.  This is a hot sauce that I prefer to use only for special occasions.  It is recommendable.

review/text: A little more heat than cayenne pepper sauces like Tabasco but nowhere near as hot as the hotter habanero sauces.  It has a great flavor that goes well with a variety of foods, flavors salad dressing, sandwich spread and barbeque sauces and make the blandest dishes come to life.  It ranks in the upper tier of my favorite sauces.

review/summary: Good sauce with good flavor
review/text: This sauce has a good delicately balanced flavor, I can understand why it is a favorite sauce among it's fans. The flavor is balanced with no one particular one ingredient taking over. It is a farily simple hot sauce flavor profile with vinegar, garlic and onion boosted with citrus to make it interesting.<br /><br />I have to admit, it was not quite as hot as I was expecting after seeing it had both habaneros and pepper extract in the ingredients, and from the many warnings on the label about how dangerously hot it was. Don't be fooled though, this is still a very, very hot sauce. I have had other sauces without extracts that were as hot as this which is the only reason I bring this up. I suppose it could be possible the batch I got was weak for some reason and I did not get a typical sample.<br /><br />This is a good sauce, I would recommend it to others.

review/text: I waited quite a while before following my impuslse to buy SMOKED SALMON AND SPINACHE MOUSSE, manufactured by GOURMETFOODSTORE.  Of course, it's expensive, and I ahd to save up for it.  And it's quite caloric, as well.  However, the picture of this gourmet treat finally DID get to me, and...after returning to this picture and this product several time.....couldn't resist it any longer.  For me, it was my "royal treat", to celebrate the Royal Wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton!<br /><br />Well, my package arrived a bit after the wedding, (today, actually) --but that's because I ordered it a bit after the wedding, (May 6, to be exact.)  I kept reminding myself how expensive this really is, and how even the Queen saves money whenever, and wherever, she can....but it was no good.  I had to at least TRY this stuff...at least once...<br /><br />The package, marked "Perishable", had stood out in my hallway for a few hours, as I was out this morning.  Upon opening the outer cardboard box, then the inner styrofoam box, (repleate with cold-bags, to keep the pershable food inside fresh),  I came across a small brown-cardboard box which held my Smoked Salmon Mousse.  Inside, was not one big package, as I had expected, but, instead -- to my delight -- sixt small black plastic tubs!  It seems, happily, that no matter how much you order of this Somoked Salmon Mousse, it will always be packed in these elegant little black plastic tubs.  The black contrasts nicely with the Smoked Salmon Mousse peeking through both sides of the large yellow label, that almost -- but not quite -- covers the food within.  The label says "Terroirs d'Antan" in big letterss, and I take it this means "land" of Antan, (and not "terrors" therefrom),<br />as "terre" means "land" in French.  Three ducks on one side and one rabbit on the other side of the central "Terroir's d'Antan" are "inhabiting" the yellow label, and we can see, in the far right distance, a huge building that looks like a French chateau -- and, indeed, right below this, in smaller letters, are the words,<br />"The selection 'Terroirs d'Antan' revives ancient recipes from the vearious terroirs of France.  Enjoy."  But further down the label, it is revealed that the product was 'Made in USA - Distrib by Optimus, Inc., Miami Fl  33138.<br /><br />The larger box in which this individual serving, (actually, containing 3 servings -- 7 ounces), black plastic box came, described the contents as being "Packed in Aspic".  And so it is.  When the vaccum-packing, transparent plastic covering is removed, there still is another transparent layer to be removed.  My own experience with "aspic" had heretofore been, mainly, with learning of the title of a movie, "A Dandy In Aspic", starring the late, (and really great), Laurence Harvey.  I have yet to see the movie -- and have never, really, known what 'aspic' is, exceptthat it is some sort of foodstuff.  Well -- I discovered, upon taking what must be aspic off the top op of the salmon mousse, that it is similar to the temporary, plastic 'dots' that are sometimes used to keep products on cardboard backings, but are (somewhat) easily removed.  A type of transparent jello, actually -- about 1/8 inch thick.<br /><br />Well, finally I had the mousse in front of me, and it was time to eat it!<br /><br />The flavour was milder rhan I had expected -- perhaps because "Cream Cheese" is the first ingredient.  The smoked salmon flavour DOES come through, on occasion, and it is a nice, dark, smoked salmon flavour, indeed!  But there is far too little of this wonderfully rich smoked salmon flavour here.  (Maybe my taste buds came upon a "pocket" of the salmon that had not thoroughly mixed with the cream cheese.  In any event, this product should have been labled as "Cream Cheese and Salmon Mousee", because "cream cheese" is the first ingredient listed, and "smoked salmon" is the eighth ingredient listed, (out of 17 ingredients), and "spinach" is the fourteenth.  (This product was made in the USA, remember -- and if I remember correctly, ingredients here must be listed in descending order.  But -- does this<br />"in size" order apply to titles too?  If not, it should...<br /><br />The smoked salmon mousse has, again, a very MILD flavour.  it tastes very UNsimilar to the NY-type "lox" I had hoped it would.  Here, the amount of cream-cheese SO overwhelms the amount of smoked salmion, that it ALMOST tastes like exotically spiced, and flavoured, cream cheese!<br /><br />The little black "tubs", however, are definitely re-usable.  Of a size similar to restaurant trays for artificial sweetner, they are happily made of "No. 5" plastic.  According to an "Organic Gardening" article I read a while back, ONLY No. 5, or No. 6 plastic are safe to reuse.  So, these little black tubs can be used to hold sugar and artificial sweetener packets, stray coins, business cards, tea-bags, or any other similar object(s).  They can also be used as "portion-control" containers, as they hold not-too-much, and not-too-little of any food -- including, (for reference), about five rounded tablespoons of tuna spre<br />trays for<br /><br />"Vita" foods, (available in New York's Waldbaum's supermarkets, and probably other areas as well, sells a someked salmon and cream-cheese spread, at 8 ounces for under $3.  Ir does not have spinach, chives, eggs, tomato, or many of the other ingredients in this Smoked Salmon Mousse, sold by GourmetFoodStore. It comes in a white, round plastic tub.  As it has more smoked slamon in it, it tastes more like smoked salmon to me.  As it's kind of inconvenient for me to go to a land-based store, I certainly hope Amazon will offer this VITA product, and others, (like their herring in wine sauce), soon.  otherwise, I'll save up for, and load up on, this Vita product when next I go to Walbaum's.  The 'Smoked Salmon and Spinach Mousse Pate - All Natural," being reviewed here, DOES have more "snob" appeal, and DOES come with those nice little space-saving black tubs.  But, unlike the Vita smoked salmon and cream cheese spread, it has more smoked-salmon taste.  And that, when all is said and done, in the end, the main thing that matters in foods, doesn't it?<br /><br />P.S.  One More Plus:  The "GourmetFoodStore" catalogue which is included with every pruchase is an education in gourmet food, all by itself.  Did you know HOW MANY types of smoked salmon there are?  HOW many types of caviar?  Whether you buy anything (else) from "GourmetFoodStore", this catalogue is not only mouth-watering...but very educational!  Made on fine "slick" paper, and filled with beautiful cloured photos, (and also high gourmet-food prices), it is a "gourmet" catalogue in more ways than one!  Thanks, GourmetFoodStore!<br /><br />One More Minus:  Sadly, my food came packed in "peanuts".  No -- not the edible type of peanuts....the STYROFOAM type of peanuts!  It's impossible to open ANY package packed in styrofoam peanuts, without getting at least some of these innocuous-looking, but incredibly annoying little pieces of styrofoam, all over your floor! GourmetFoodStore is not the only manufacturer/ seller who does this of course....but one would think, with the wonderful, (and espensive) gourmet products they sell, that this up-market marketer would pack their food with something less annoying to the customer?  Of course, there IS the TINY advantage in having something packed in peanuts...one gets forced excercise picking up these small, but aggravating, strofoam peace-of-mind-destroyers, off the<br />floor.  OK -- a few calories are used in this way, and, if you are female, you can imagine yourself to be Ruth, (from the Bible), doing some gleaning.  However, I prefer to have MY fantasies when I desire to have them, and to excercise when _I_ decide to excercise, and NOT have these things suddenly and unexpexctedly forced upon me when opening up a package -- especially from such a luxury-goods emporium as GourmetFoodStore truly is.  Perhaps a $1 charge for having one's goods "not to be packed in peanuts" might be applied?  (PLEASE don't make it more than $1!)  Bubble-wrap and similar plastic space-fillers are SO appreciated by customer!  And less aggravation leads to less buying of calmatives and pain-relievers....possibly allowing for MORE money to be spent at GourmetFoodStore!

At 8 packs at 3.3 oz for over $15.00 this is very expensive. Just be aware this ad is misleading.

review/summary: Great  Chocolate, not so great MarzipanThis
review/text: This candy had a great chocolate covering but the Marzipan was lacking in texture (too runny) and flavor. It could be it was overpowered by the chocolate since the almond scent and flavor is fairly delicate. It came simply but beautifully wrapped and the candy was very attractive to look at. If you want true marzipan flavor, go somewhere else.

review/summary: A *must-have* household staple
review/text: This sauce is medium heat for everyday use.  It has an excellent roasted pepper flavor, and there is *NO VINEGAR* to get in the way.  Consequently, you get exactly what one should expect from a pepper sauce...versatility and flavor that does not try to smother the character of the food you season with it.<br /><br />An every-day sauce should not leave a patina on your tongue.  This is not a boutique novelty, it's a household staple.  The 32 oz. size is the right size for a hot sauce household.<br /><br />You want good?  Try Tapatio on cottage cheese.  You'll never eat cottage cheese any other way again, I promise.<br /><br />I use it on just about anything except cereal and ice cream, but my personal favorite applications of Tapatio are:<br /><br />eggs<br />potatoes<br />pizza<br />anything creole (forget tabasco!)<br />cottage cheese<br />most rice<br />mac cheese<br />and of course...Mex<br /><br />In my opinion, this is the best sauce in your local grocery store.

review/summary: If there were any more stars to give that 5 stars...
review/text: I would give it.  This hot sauce is the best hot sauce that has ever been made with human hands.  To compare this to Tabasco is an utter mockery, but that is the most common "hot sauce" that most Americans have experienced, so that is the one that I will compare it to.  Anyone that would try to genuinely compare the two should have a CAT scan done.  A 7 out of 10 as far as hotness, Tapatio can go on anything that you need to make spicy and tasty.  Try putting a couple of squirts of this Mexican nectar in a bag of Doritos and you WILL NOT be able to put them down.  Buy the 32 oz. size, you will not regret it!

review/summary: Best hot sauce I've ever tasted
review/text: This is without a doubt the best-tasting hot sauce I've ever had. I first encountered this sauce at a Mexican restaurant, among the other condiments on the table, and decided the cheap, simple-looking logo and foreign-sounding name merited a try for curiosity's sake. Boy, am I glad! I'm so used to the tongue-scathing, vinegary sourness of brands like Texas Pete and Frank's RedHot. This was so refreshing, it tastes so peppery and flavorful. The heat is definitely still there, but not overpowering like other sauces I've tried. I highly recommend giving this hot sauce a try.

review/summary: Absolute Favorite Hot Sauce
review/text: Have tried many hot sauces over the years, but Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce is my favorite. After my local grocery discontinued it, I was bereft. Was so very pleased to discover that I could order it through Amazon. The first listed ingredient is chili peppers (in contrast to so many whose primary ingredient seems to be vinegar); it is hot without be mouth-numbingly so. It really is a delightful addition to a Bloody Mary (but, I must admit, I use it on many, many other things, from scrambled eggs to tostadas to all kinds of soups). I purchased this product from Amazon through Mex-Grocer; recently one of my shipments was lost in transit. They were so very great about following through, rectifying the situation, and apologizing that I wouldn't consider ordering from anyone else in the future. Would have to admit that I am somewhat addicted to this salsa.

review/text: I like spicy food, but usually avoid <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001R6HC2A">Tabasco</a>-like hot sauce because it tastes like I poured vinegar over my food.<br /><br />Tapatio is not made with vinegar. As a result, the hot sauce adds flavor instead of taking away.<br /><br />In fact, it may taste too good. The heat has a way of sneaking up on you. I'd say it is about as hot as Tabasco, but you won't notice the heat at first.<br /><br />Tapatio is hands down the best hot-sauce available and I use to to add flavor to everything from pizza to spaghetti to mac and cheese.

review/summary: A nice blend. Medium heat - not too much vinegar and a smart buy in the 32 oz size
review/text: I really like this sauce. It is a great blend! While there is nothing truly remarkable about it - more importantly - it has no obvious flaws.  It simply has a nicely balanced flavor and that alone is quite rare in hot sauces!!!! This sauce could or should be a staple in any kitchen.  I'm glad to have a bottle in my pantry.<br /><br />I would rate this sauce somewhere between mild and medium hot. You'll need more than a couple of drops but not much more than that to generate some heat in any dish. Compared to Tabasco's original you'll need about twice the number of drops.<br /><br />Ingredients (as copied from the label): Water, Red Peppers, Salt, Spices, Garlic, Acetic Acid (a component of vinegar), etc ......<br /><br />Note the relatively low level of vinegar within the sauce. That is a good thing. The type of red pepper is unknown but there is a natural sweetness to this sauce which I find quite pleasant. That sweetness balances nicely against the heat. View this sauce as a superior alternative to a very common benchmark - the original Tabasco hot sauce.<br /><br />Minor flaws: There is a bit too much salt in this sauce but that only becomes evident when used in an already heavily salted dish. For example: This is not the best choice for a Bloody Mary due to the heavily salted nature of most vegetable/tomato juices.<br /><br />Since this sauce is available in 5 oz, 10 oz and 32 oz sizes - you'd be wise to pick up the 32oz size given the fact that it often costs little more than the smaller sizes.<br /><br />This is a fine basic hot sauce with a natural sweetness to it. This sauce is worthy of being a staple in any kitchen. It is better than most. What it lacks is that rare sense of freshness and, as noted, there is also a bit too much salt.

review/summary: Great product, quick shipping
review/text: I received this product from a friend of mine who is from AZ and immediately fell in love with it.  It's slightly thicker than Tabasco and Trappey's, but not as sour, and with a little bit more heat.  It goes well with almost EVERYTHING.  So, I knew what to expect.<br /><br />I bought two large bottles.  The seller shipped the package quickly, except that the cap on one of the bottles was loose, so the hot sauce leaked a little bit; otherwise, I would have given them 5 stars.  But that won't stop me from buying from them again next time I run out.<br /><br />Highly recommend to those who want a little bit of heat, without having too much of a vinegar base.

review/summary: A favorite hot sauce
review/text: For well over a year, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce has set itself apart from the others and has become a favorite.  When I was given a bottle of this hot sauce for the first time, as far as I remember, I was just expecting a typical hot sauce--this is not typical hot sauce.  It is hotter than the other hot sauces that I like, but it is not overpowering and does not have a searing heat--more like a peppery heat.  In addition, Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce has a pleasing, exceptional flavor.  This is a hot sauce that I prefer to use only for special occasions.  It is recommendable.

review/text: Like, alot of others, we purchased the Bosch Tassimo believing what appears to be a great selection of coffees. Well here in America, most prefer a large cup of coffee, this delivers a good size, but this is really weak flavored coffee. Yes I wanted Starbucks, but I have been buying different coffees for the Tassimo machine and have yet to find the coffee I really like. I have purchased almost all that are offered, either they are very short cups, strong, but bitter and you have to use 2, to get the cup size you want, so then the price is not so great. This is really a sad situation, great machine, but really poor selection of coffees, Tassimo really needs to step of their game.

review/summary: close to dunkin donuts with milk and sugar
review/text: I like Dunkin Donuts coffee and was looking for something similar.  I like this Maxwell House "Cafe Collection" House Blend, as long as a add a little more water than suggested and I use skim milk and 2 sugars.<br />Looking at the choices on Amazon I see that there is a 12oz version but the T disc that I use makes an 8oz cup.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WDCEHA">Maxwell House Cafe Collection House Blend Coffee (Medium), 16-Count T-Discs for Tassimo Coffeemakers (Pack of 2)</a>

review/summary: This is very "medium" coffee
review/text: I think some of the negative reviews are coming from people who like strong brews and tried this thinking it would have the same deep flavor. It doesn't, but this really isn't the coffee drinkers' coffee. This is the the coffee you mix with sugar and creamer to enjoy or serve to guests you don't really like (saving the good stuff for yourself). I wouldn't say it is bad...it's just average. The flavor is very light and dissipates almost immediately after hitting your tongue. It would be fair to say the resulting beverage is, "water, with a hint of coffee".

review/summary: Good coffee - One of my favorites by Tassimo
review/text: I understand that there's no universal coffee that everyone loves.  Everyone has unique tastes and preferences.  But for me, this coffee is great. I've bought Starbucks and Seattle's Best coffee for Tassimo, as well as other designer coffees as well.  Pretty much everything Tassimo T-Discs have to offer.<br /><br />I guess I don't have expensive tastes or something, because this Maxwell House is the cheapest Tassimo has to offer, and I like it the best.  I JUST bought 2 boxes yesterday, and amazon lowered the price by 25% in a single day!  What the heck??<br /><br />Yes, I know this seems expensive to the lay person, who might be new to Tassimo or is thinking about buying one.  If you don't have a Tassimo machine yet, don't get one!  Unfortunately, I'm stuck with one, so I'm forced to use it, but the coffee T-Discs are just way too expensive.  Buy a Keurig.  You'll pay more for the machine, but you'll pay less for the coffee, and you'll have a lot more options.<br /><br />I don't like my Tassimo, but I refuse to buy a new machine when mine works perfectly.  I DO like this coffee, however!

review/summary: Most people like to smoke their cigarettes.
review/text: Wow, if this is the only thing you can get in Europe, I feel sorry for them. After trying this for myself, I suspected that those high ratings were only illusions. My husband told me that company's consider these reviews as just another form of advertising and pay people to lie about a product's quality. I really can't imagine anyone thinking this product is drinkable, let alone, pleasurable. If you want a couple recommendations on decent tasting t-discs for your Tassimo machine, the Jacobs Latte Macchiato isn't bad if you add sugar. This morning though, I drank it after I tried the Voluptuoso and my mouth has a metallic taste to it. Not sure which one is responsible. Another thing, the milk in the disc tastes sour, but when you add sugar, there is a decent flavor there. For the 2nd decent beverage, you can take the Kenco Crema with some Coffee Mate's Spiced Pumpkin and Vanilla Spiced Chai (a liberal amount) creamers, with enough sugar, and have a nice smooth cappaccino. I've tried about nine flavors now, and the coffee, cremas, most lattes and cappaccinos, have the same inferior quality in looks and taste, as a cheap instant coffee, as well as, having your mouth taste like you just drank the contents of an ashtray. Kenco Crema is the only one that did not taste like nicotene. These are the coffees I've tried: Gevailia Cappaccino, Maxwell House - House Blend, Hag Crema Decaf, Jacobs Kronung, Carte Noire Voluptuoso Classic, Kenco Crema and Jacob's Macchiato. After finding one inferior brew after another, I've given up looking for a good cup of black coffee and/or cappaccino, for the Tassimo. Don't do what I did, which was believe all the positive reviews and downplay the critical reviews. My curiousity has been appeased after spending $34 in Tassimo beverages. Thankfully, 2 packages were free. Now I can either spend more money in S&H to return them, or drink all 56 cigarettes...I mean coffee.

review/summary: Not quite what you think
review/text: Dried strawberries are smaller than most - and as another reviewer mentioned - sweetened with high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />For a product that costs about $.90 an ounce, you would think that Stoneridge could've ponied up the extra $.02 per ounce for real sugar.<br /><br />In addition, they include propylene glycol (a less-toxic version of ethylene glycol, both used as antifreeze) to stop the berries from sticking to each other.  OK.... the effect of this is that they come across as "slippery" in your mouth, and not in a good way.<br /><br />Strange part is, the ingredient list on the package that I typed this from is different than the ingredient list of the product as listed on the Stoneridge website. Their website mentioned that they are sweetened with sucrose, for example.<br /><br />But the Stoneridge product we received from Amazon has HFCS.  And antifreeze.<br /><br />The disclaimer above says it all - "Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website."<br /><br />We won't be repeat customers.

review/summary: Best online dried strawberries I've tried
review/text: These dried strawberries are quite good, although they're not cheap.  I disagree with the other reviewer who thinks these strawberries are too sweet.  They are indeed slightly sweetened, but no more than many of the dried fruits available at Trader Joes which also have a light sugar coating.<br /><br />I've tried two other dried strawberry products available online:  the Nuts Online dried strawberries and the Barry Farm dried strawberries.  They both taste like strawberry candy to me, rather than like dried strawberries (although the texture of the strawberries comes through a bit in the Nuts Online product).  In contrast, the Stoneridge Orchards dried strawberries taste like dried strawberries, rather than like candy. In my opinion, these are not oversweetened, unlike the Nuts Online and Barry Farms brands.  (I also just noticed another brand available - from Angolina's Gormet, I think.  They are even more expensive than Stoneridge Orchards.  I wonder what they taste like.)<br /><br />In summary - if you have a craving for dried strawberries, I suggest the Stoneridge Orchards brand, but NOT the Barry Farms brand or the Nuts Online brand.

review/summary: FAIL-SAFE CHILI
review/text: Ro-Tel Chili Fixins takes the work out of making a Big Pot of Red.  The basic seasonings for chili are in the can.  I generally stir in a couple of seeded jalapeno peppers and add extra chili powder to taste but this is just me.  There is no way to foul up a good bowl of chili if you follow the instructions and use one can of Chili Fixins per pound of coarse ground beef.  I always make a big batch and freeze the left overs.  I use two pounds of  course ground beef, one pound of ground turkey and one pound of cubed beef roast or stew meat with four cans of Chili Fixins.  I also add a coursely chopped onion that I sautee with the meat.  Just follow the directions on the can.  I ordered this product through Amazon because none of the local stores carry it.  The chili recipe on the can works just fine without adding extra stuff.  I just like to personalize the chili a little.  Of course, I tell everyone I make my chili from scratch and I did until I discovered Chili Fixins almost 10 years ago.

For some people these may taste a little too strong, perhaps; but I enjoy them very much.<br /><br />Altoid mints are very low in calories, fat, sodium and more. The main effect, therefore, is simply to make your breath its very freshest. They come in that famous little tin that keeps them fresh until their expiration date.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend Altoids as THE ultimate in breath mints. People who also simply love that strong peppermint taste will delight in these, too.<br /><br />Great job, Altoids!

review/summary: These mints will knock your socks off!!!
review/text: These peppermints are a whole new experience in mints.  Once you get used to these, any other brand or type of mint will be too bland and too sweet.  Altoids are intense.

review/summary: We Love Altoids!!!
review/text: We love these peppermint Altoids!  While they are a very good breath mint, we use them mainly for flavoring our coffee and sometimes, tea.  One, in the bottom of the cup, or a few in the coffee/tea pot makes life more interesting!  Also, good with just a touch of hot cocoa, added along with Altoids, in coffee.  And yes, they are good in hot cocoa, too.  Very inexpensive, easy way to flavor coffee or tea, much cheaper than alternative.  Almost no calories, but big on flavor!  We've used these for decades!

review/summary: Love the peppermint
review/text: I buy various flavors of Altoids at times, but the peppermint are my all time favorites.  Besides the great tate they leave the mouth felling fresh.  Also I have hear that if you have a cold and having problems breathing a peppermint Altoid will help.  And it does, for me anyway.  I've hear that if you're on an inhaler it will help also so you don't have to use your inhaler as often.  Can't say on that.  I don't buy, or eat, a lot of candy, but always try to have some peppermint Altoids on hand.  The other flavors are good too, but I prefer the peppermint.

review/summary: SOOO good.
review/text: Peppermint Altoids are good and strong.  The strong pepperment scent allows you to place two under your tongue, or in you cheeks instead of cough drops: it works about the same, too.

review/summary: Get your attention mints
review/text: I have found altoids to be the best type of mint.<br />1. They are refreshing.<br />2. They will most definetly clear your sinus should you need to.<br />3. The tin they come in makes them easy to carry, not to mention the assortment of flavors. I am partial to Peppermint.<br />4. The cost at Amazon.com is great. I would and have recommended Altoids to my friends and family.<br />5. Go for it.---They are fabulous!

review/summary: Woo-Hoo!
review/text: You've got allergies, stuffed-up sinuses, scratchy throat, dry mouth??<br /><br />Pop in an Altoid (two, if you are feeling very brave) and all will be well in a moment's time. Strong doesn't describe them. They are screaming atomic mints, and the peppermint will blow you into the 18th century to say hello to George III.<br /><br />Dang, these are powerful mints.

review/summary: My favorite mints
review/text: This is my favorite mint, it does a good job of freshening up your breath however it isn't extremely potent like the cinnamon ones. The tin can also be reused for storing small items for a survival kit. For example one tin can carry a pack of needles, a small thimble, a couple different color threads spun on the cardboard cutouts and some buttons in one and then use a different one for a small portable fishing kit w/ hooks, lines, and sinkers, etc...So not only are the mints great but with such versatile packaging I can't get enough of these.

review/summary: Strong candies, bitter world
review/text: I am French and since many years to Altoids Strong Mints addicted :-) I tried other tastes but peppermints are for me the only ones. Can you believed that, dear peppermints fans : it's terribly difficult to get them in Paris (though it's the most beautyful city in the world :-) and if you find some, they are scandalously expensive. And I can't buy it online ("This item can't be shipped in the selected country"). Why ?? What must I do ? Go to rehab and change for fruit candies ?? No way.<br />Strong candies, bitter world...<br /><br />But I'm sort of lucky, a friend of mine fly to New-York next week, I'll soon have a stock.

review/summary: A great  peppermint mint
review/text: I have always used Altoids peppermint mints until I discovered a better mint. Newman's Own organic peppermints. Never will I eat another Altoids mint again after trying Newman's Own Peppermint and they are organic too. Newman's own peppermints are just a better mint.
