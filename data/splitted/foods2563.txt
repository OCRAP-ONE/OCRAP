review/summary: A New Tasty Flavor From Kool Aid
review/text: It seems like Peach-Mango is the new flavor de jour as I have seen it popped up everywhere lately and now it is the latest Kool Aid flavor.  If you ever bought the 19 oz Kool Aid container, the Peach-Mango flavor is no different, same size, same measuring instructions as the rest of them. If this will be your first experience, it is extremely easy to make and the lid even doubles as a measuring tool to help you make one or two quarts worth at a time.  The Peach-Mango tastes exactly how I would expect a Peach-Mango Kool Aid flavor would taste, but it does taste slightly more watered down than other flavors.  But I would still it is my top five Kool Aid flavors and it add it my rotation whenever buying Kool Aid.

review/summary: I liked it, the kids didn't.
review/text: When mixed, this new Kool Aid flavor looks more like Sunny D than it does a typical Kool Aid drink.  It's more opaque.  And, even though I used icy cold water, it dissolved completely with a few stirs.  I really liked this new flavor, but I love mangoes.  I preferred it over the typical Kool Aid flavors, but when I let the kids try it, they didn't really care for it at all. I guess I'll have it all to myself.

review/summary: Good flavor.  Packaging not so great.
review/text: I like the flavor of the Peach Mango Kool-Aid.  The flavor is not too artificial and I can definitely tell that the flavors are peach and mango, however mango is much stronger.  I found the drink to be too sweet if mixed per instructions.  I used 4 teaspoons per 24 oz of water (slightly less than 1/2 of the recommended amount) and I thought that it was sweet enough. However, I used cool water.  I am sure that if I used ice-cold water, the drink would taste less sweet.<br /><br />I think the packaging is not well thought through.  I think the opening is too narrow, and not very convenient for reaching in with a spoon.  Also, the outer colorful layer is a shrink wrap.  When the jar is first opened and the lid is removed, the portion of the wrapper that goes around the lid falls off.  That portion contains both the name of the flavor and the instructions in English.  I think the container could have been designed better.<br /><br />In my opinion, once you figure out water-to-mix proportions, this is a good product that both adults and kids will enjoy.

review/summary: Really not my favorite flavor
review/text: As a kid, I loved Kool-Aid and still to this day, the tast of Kool-Aid Lemonade brings back memories of Summer afternoons. But I'm just not digging this new Peach Mango flavor. It was quite peachy in flavor, I couldn't really taste the mango part of the drink. Apart from the easy to read and understand directions, I don't have too much to say about the drink. It just wasn't to my taste but others may enjoy the flavor a lot more.

review/summary: Very sweet, not "Kool-Aid" like...
review/text: I'm old school when it comes to Kool-Aid flavors --- lemonade, orange, lemon-lime, cherry, grape -- but I tried this peach-mango flavor with an open mind.  The only way I knew it was Kool-Aid was because the packaging said it was.  I don't particularly like fruity tasting beverages, and this seemed extremely sweet for my tastes as well.  I drink lemonade and iced tea powdered mixers sugared or with sugar substitutes, and they are all just fine (not Kool-Aid brand), so it could just be me.  This is not a flavor I think kids would like either.  In fact, I've offered the remainder of this container to kids up through their teens and so far, no one has touched it.

review/text: I really enjoyed this. I'm not a Kool Aid drinking person at all but I am a huge mango lover so I tried it and it is really yummy. I preferr mine not too sweet with tons of ice and it is so refreshing. I did not really notice the peach flavor-but the mango influence is strong, you should give this a try it will be a great summer drink.

review/summary: Great peachy flavor, not too sweet
review/text: This Kook-Aid has a really nice flavor - sort of reminds one of a peachy TANG. While peach is a dominate flavor, you still get a really good hint of mango as well. A really refreshing sort of flavor. Its not too sweet and definitely could hold its own as a fun summer punch with fruit slices or blended with vanilla ice cream for a great dessert. It has a more mature flavor than most Kool-Aid drinks, but the kids still really enjoyed it. Would definitely get again.

review/summary: Kids love it
review/text: I love a good peach mango beverage and was excited to find this flavor in Kool Aid. Unfortunately, my adult taste buds found the drink to be overly peachy with no real discernible mango flavor. I also found the drink to be not quite sweet enough when made according to package directions.<br /><br />On the other hand, my children (3 and 4 years old) absolutely loved this flavor. We're talking actual begging for a refill. Having less sugar than the other juices type drinks they love and containing some vitamins, I was pleased they were so happy with it.

review/text: This is a great new flavor of Kool-Aid, a non-carbonated drink which I have enjoyed all my life. This particular product contains a little less sugar than the old Kool-Aid but I couldn't taste the difference. This flavor is very refreshing and it's incredibly easy to mix. I often make it a glass at a time to avoid clogging up my refrigerator with yet another pitcher.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Nice Flavor
review/text: I decided to make a gallon of this. For making a gallon of Kool-aid you have to dump in two lids full of powder. That seemed pretty excessive. At first I did just one lid, and it was too watery. Then I added a half a lid and tasted real good. When I was younger, I remember just using those small little packets and then a bunch of sugar, but with this one the sweetener is added so you only have to add the powered. Using a gallon, takes up nearly half of the powered in the jar though.<br /><br />Both my boyfriend and I liked the taste a lot. Not too sweet, very refreshing. The first flavor you get is the mango flavor with a sweet peach flavor aftertaste. I am sure it would have been stronger if I added the second half a lid of power to it. But I liked it with the amount I added. I remember as a child when using the small packets I never used as much sugar as it said because it was always to sweet for me.<br /><br />My boyfriend really likes koolaid, and we don't drink it much, but after tastings this one we are most likely going to go out and buy other flavors and maybe even this flavor again because we liked it so much. Very easy to make, just dump in the amount of powered per size of container, add water and stir. Not messy, but a little powdery, it puffed up when I added the powder and I had kool aid smell stuck in my nose for awhile.

review/summary: Full of mango-flavored deliciousness
review/text: This new peach mango Kool-Aid flavor sounded interesting so I decided to give it a try. It really does taste like peach and mango, with the sweetness that you can expect with any Kool-Aid. I think this is a bit more sophisticated flavor than a lot of the Kool-Aid I've tried before - a kid would still probably love the stuff, but the flavor doesn't have the overly artificial fruit character that a lot of drinks of this nature do.

review/text: Unbelieveably I've never had a Kool-Aid drink until now, therefore I was looking forward to a new taste experience when I received this item. I added two teaspoons of the mix in cold water, added ice and enjoyed a very flavorable drink.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the fact that it was tasty but not over powering with sweetness. Although the mix says it contains peach, the mango flavor was certainly more overwhelming.

No need to add anything but water, this mix is already sweetened.  Not so great if you like to use something like Splenda instead of sugar, but convenient.

review/text: Well, this was pretty decent. I may have to doctor it up next time. I wish it was a little bit sweeter. Usually, when I make Kool-Aid from the packs, I usually make it more on the sweeter side. So the next time I try this I may put some sugar in it or a little bit more Kool-Aid mix than what was suggested in the directions.<br /><br />However, it was still good. My roommate was not really into it, though. I doubt I will ever buy it, because I prefer the Kool-Aid packs and their variety of flavors.

review/summary: It's Kool Aid ... You Know You Love It
review/text: Let's be honest: I'm not sure how many people need to read a review of a new flavor of Kool Aid, but if you're on the fence about trying Peach Mango Kool Aid you can rest easy. This tastes exactly like the typical red fruit punch Kool Aid (well, it actually looks orange) but with ... wait for it ... a hint of peach and mango flavor mixed in.<br /><br />Honestly, if you like Kool Aid (and I do since I grew up drinking it) then you'll like this new flavor of Kool Aid ... provided that you don't hate peaches or mango. The peach and mango flavor is pretty faint but I personally taste more of the peach flavor than mango.<br /><br />Still, we're talking about Kool Aid here folks; it's sugar water with a hint of fruit flavor. The basic concept hasn't changed in decades and the new Peach Mango Kool Aid is no exception.

review/text: I was actually really excited to have a chance to try this Kool Aid since mango and peach are two of my favorite flavors.<br />It was a great idea, but the actual product is just too sweet and is lacking the slight "tang" that a real peach has and the mango flavor is almost missing<br /><br />On the bright side, my son loved it, but then again it contains sugar, and he is addicted to sugar.<br /><br />My recommendation, if it is on sale and you have kids, go ahead and buy it, if it is the same price as cherry, grape, or fruit punch, buy those instead

review/text: I was a bit scared to try a drink with mango in it because usually anything with mango has an odd flavor to it to me, but my teenager talked me into getting this so she could try it too. Ok, so we got it and tried it and it really was much better than I expected. More of the peach flavor comes through than the mango. My teenager really liked it. I like buying kool aid like this as you can make as much or as little as you want right from the container to the glass.

review/summary: It's Alright....
review/text: And that's about all my family said!  With five boys, I admit it, I buy kool-aid.  And on a hot summer day, who doesn't love a glass of ice cold Kool-aid?  I know I sure do!<br /><br />All five of the boys like grape and fruit punch, so when they heard about this new flavor, they agreed to give it a shot.  We received it, and I made immediately.<br /><br />Their responses:<br /><br />"hmm....tastes sort of weird."<br /><br />"It's alright."<br /><br />"I want the purple one."<br /><br />Ok, so it wasn't a huge hit.  But it was pleasant enough.  I LOVE mangos, and I LOVE peaches, so I was psyched, but I didn't get a real clear taste of either.  One thing I wasn't a fan of, was the sort of strange after taste.<br /><br />Bottom line-the kids will drink it if I buy it, but it isn't their favorite.  And though it does have less sugar than soda (the label says 33% less) there is still a decent amount in a serving-14g in an 8 ounce glass.

review/text: I haven't had Kool Aid in awhile, but have a 6 year old daughter who is always asking for it, and this sounded like a promising flavor combination.<br /><br />My little family of three was weirdly excited about trying the Kool Aid, so as soon as I opened the package, I made a glass for each of us. We all took a sip, then another, then another. We all looked at each other in agreement... this is good stuff!! It's peachy and mango-ey, without being over the top, and not too sweet either. In fact, it tastes like surprisingly like juice. Very, very drinkable. I will be looking for other new flavors by Kool Aid, as it seems that they are catering to not just kids any more. Great stuff.

review/text: I have not had Kool-Aid in such a long time! But I was very surprised on how great tasting Peach Mango Kool-Aid is! A very nice combination of both Peach & Mango but not overpowering in either flavor. I do remember having to add a lot of sugar to past Kool-Aids but in fact I didn't have to add very much sugar at all, which makes me very happy! True is not the healthiest mix in water alternative but it is a nice refreshing treat to have at home. Easy to mix plus you can do other things with it that other healthier smaller packages are not able to. I froze some and made ice cubes and pops for hubby since he has such a sweet tooth. He loved them and it was such a nice sweet flavor. Perfect to have at home when you just don't want a glass of water or when you run out of the more expensive alternative water mix ins.

review/summary: An okay tasting flavor from Kool-Aid
review/text: Kool Aid Peach Mango Sugar Sweetened is a new flavor from the makers of Kool-Aid.  I really didn't care for it.  The taste wasn't bad but it wasn't the kind that will make me go out and buy it.  I really like the plastic container it comes in.  The top serves as a measuring cup allowing you to make either one or two quarts of Kool Aid,  If you're looking for a new tasting flavor of Kool Aid and if you enjoy the taste of Mango or Peach then you'll want to try this flavor out.  But, if you're not a fan of either flavor or the mix of the two then I advise you to try classic Cherry.<br /><br />Wow, I didn't know that Kool-Aid is going to be 85 years old.

review/text: It's Kool-Aid! It's peach mango flavored, and it tastes great! Since it's already sweetened, you just add water, stir, and start pouring. If it was just me, I'd use slightly less than the recommended amount for 2 quarts, since I find it to be a little bit sweet. But for my girls, even at the recommended amount, my 6 year old determined that it was missing just a little bit of sugar, and that with that added sugar it would be perfect.<br /><br />We don't drink this often, but it's great for a treat every so often. And since it's premixed, my girls could actually make it themselves.

review/summary: MMMMmmmm Kool Aid!
review/text: Okay, so there's no juice here, and it's basically just flavored sugar water, but Kool-Aid is great for pepping up water and making it taste better than just plain old tap water. This flavor is Peach Mango, and it's heavier on the peach than the mango, making it a refreshing, sweet drink. I like to mix the finished product with real juice (whatever is on hand) to make the juice stretch further without having a watered-down flavor.<br /><br />This product is nothing new in the world of Kool-Aid, of course. It's sugar-sweetened. No bad-tasting aspartame, sucralose/Splenda, or other artificial sweeteners in here, thank goodness! Just good old sugar.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with Kool-Aid, especially if you use it as a way to make real juice last longer. It's certainly better than loading yourself or your kids down with high fructose corn syrup!<br /><br />Worth the price. Bring your own water.

review/summary: It's pretty tasty and downright convenient, don't even need a measuring cup
review/text: I admit I haven't had Kool-Aid in many years.  I remember it being in powdered form in small foil lined bags with simple flavors like lime or cherry.  This is leaps and bounds away from that stuff.  It probably has less sugar too since you don't have to add your own.  What I like about this product is that the cap doubles as a measuring cup.  It works good yet you have to knock all the mix into the pitcher and make sure it is all in there or else the mix particles will get caught in the tracks of the cap and it won't fit as tight as it once did.  So far, no problems with that though and the cap isn't too loosened but if a person wasn't paying attention, it could be a mess.  The taste of the product is very good.  I could imagine this would be even better in the summer, then drinking it now.  The peach and mango flavors taste natural.  I would recommend it to people who want an easy to make drink mix they don't have to add sugar too or even find a measuring cup for.  Just get a pitcher, add water and ice, stir and it's done!  I wanted to say I mixed this with the suggested amount of product to water and had a good, sweet but not too sweet, result and a good tasting peach mango drink.  I could taste the peach and the mango.  The product does leave "ghost rings" of white on glasses sitting out too, but I find that amusing more than anything else.

review/summary: Another great flavor from Kool Aid!
review/text: I've been drinking Kool Aid since I was a little kid decades ago. I wonder why it took so long to get to this flavor.  Maybe it wasn't easy to replicate the artificial peach and mango taste?  Still they have it right now, and it's not like the real fruit, but it's not bad, certainly no worse than other Kool Aid.  Real sugar is the way to drink Kool Aid since they took Sodium Cyclomate off the market in the 60's because some rats they pickled in the stuff got cancer.  Cyclomate was the best non-sugar sweetner for taste ever, I'm surprised they've not brought it back, but until then sugar is the way to go. I'm a bit disappointed I only got one jar of this instead of the four promised, but that's the way they work with food products for Vine reviewers, a can instead of a case typically.<br /><br />Standard Kool Aid stuff here, pre-measured scoop for a pitcher or a glass and dissolve the stuff in very cold water.  Very drinkable.  I tried it with sliced peaches and some pineapple as an alternative to drinking it straight and it blends well.  Might save you a bit on fruit juices if you have a lot of thirsty kids.  I don't think they'll complain about the taste, I'm a lot more discriminating at my age than I was as a kid.  Now where do I get one of those big Kool Aid pitchers, I've looked for one for years!

review/summary: More of a MANGO flavor ... and NO, it is NOT healthy.
review/text: I grew up on Kool-Aid ... orange, cherry, tropical punch, and strawberry flavors.  I don't drink it anymore, but do buy it on occasion as a treat for my kids.  It's still KOOL-AID, which means sugar (even if it is 35% less than sodas) and, of course, those infamous "artificial colors and flavors."  This particular variety has more of a MANGO taste than a peach taste.  It does taste good, as far as Kool-Aids go, if you like mangos (which I and my kids do).  Again, I cannot recommend this as a "healthy" drink for your kids, BUT I do believe it is better than drinking sodas (which can become addictive).  I still prefer (and push) my kids to drink water and milk as their primary means of hydration.  We leave the Kool-Aid mixes for parties or special treats.

review/summary: Mmmm... Sugary
review/text: Peach Mango Kool Aid, when added to water, has a pretty color and good flavor. Even though I am partial to their tropical punch flavor, I love mangoes, and this drink mix has wonderful mango notes with the subtle peach. Yes, I'm aware this is not wine, but I liked it.<br /><br />The label also boasts 35% less sugar than soda, but let's be honest. Kool Aid equals sugar, artificial colors, and flavors. And we would not have it any other way. I made a single serving glass (medium sized) for myself the first time I tried this and was hit by a mouthful of sweetness. It left a bit of an aftertaste which I had to chase down with water. Since then, it's a balancing act between the right amount of water and about a third of a tablespoon of the drink mix to get a good glass.<br /><br />If you get past the stigma of having "less sugar," you'll probably enjoy this nostalgic drink more. Cheers!

review/summary: Very Artificial, But Pretty Tasty
review/text: When you see the Kool Aid name, you know what you are getting - lots of sugar, artificial flavors, and artificial colors. I like mangoes, and the mango flavor really comes through in this drink. I don't really taste the peach. Many people said they thought the drink wasn't sweet enough, but I followed the directions and thought it was a little too sweet and added more water. My husband tries to avoid artificial drinks in general and didn't care for the flavor. I noticed that the bottom of my pitcher had a white film coating it after the drink was gone, and I found that to be a little off-putting. It seems like the chemicals they use don't completely dissolve and that just helped remind me of the drink's artificiality.<br /><br />One of Kool Aid's claims is that this drink has "35% less sugar than the leading regular sodas." Knowing how sugary Kool Aid usually is, I figured they were fudging the numbers by comparing their 8 ounce serving to a 12 oz serving of soda or something. I did a little research and compared some "leading regular sodas" (7-Up, Coke, Dr. Pepper, and Pepsi) and found that this Kool Aid drink actually has at least 35% less sugar than the sodas. I was surprised.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the flavor of this drink but I don't plan to buy it.

review/summary: Not the best of flavors
review/text: Kool Aid has been around for so long - it's probably been a part of almost everyone's childhood in some way shape or form, and I'm sure everyone has their favorites.<br /><br />While I appreciate that Kool Aid is trying new things, this flavor is not one of their best offerings.  When made according to the package directions the flavor is weak.  I added a little extra powder to my glass and while it did strengthen the flavor to what I thought it should be, it still just wasn't that appealing to me, it still tasted a bit blah unlike favorite Kool Aid flavors such as cherry and grape.<br /><br />If you're looking for something different or more mild perhaps you'll like this, but overall it's not something I would recommend if you're looking for traditional Kool Aid taste.

review/summary: Kool-Aid Kool-Aid, tastes great! More mango-y than peachy
review/text: Kool-Aid is a sugary kids drink, no doubt about that.  It has the same calories and sugar content as Country Time lemonade, but while Country Time only has Vitamin C, this Kool-Aid has added C and E, for what that's worth.  Instead of the jar containing a scoop, the lid is a large measuring cup with lines for 1 or 2 quarts and you pour in the mix from the jar, much less messy than scooping. There's a little powder "cloud" but it dissolves easily.<br /><br />Kids and I both liked it. I felt there was a more mango flavor than peach, which gets points from me because artificial peach flavoring can be pretty bad. In fact, I bet they could sell this as just "mango" flavor.

review/text: I haven't drank Kool Aid in probably 30 years. Kool Aid Peach Mango tastes pretty much exactly how I remember Kool Aid tasting though. Just like the old fashioned flavors of Kool Aid, you'll have to use your imagination to think you're drinking something tasting like the actual flavor it is supposed to be. With that being said, it isn't bad. If you like sugary soft drinks, it tastes pleasant. It's loaded with sugar, artificial flavors, and artificial colorings. A health drink it is obviously not, but it is no worse than any other sugar or high fructose corn syrup soft drink.

review/summary: It's Kool-Aid Folks
review/text: First of all, this is Kool-Aid.  So right off, you know you are basically getting a surgar fix with some artifical flavoring.  Those desiring something healthy should go elsewhere - this is not it.  Given that we are talking about Kool-Aid and not something that will make some governmental food pyramid or whatever polyhedra they are using at the moment, the only thing worth discussing is the taste.<br /><br />Back in the day (and I am old enough to remember "the day"), Kool-Aid came in pretty basic flavors:  cherry, orange, grape, etc.  It was in a bit of a competition by a johnny-come-lately competitor by Pillsbury called "Funny Face" that had such flavors as "Choo Choo Cherry", "Rootin Tootin Raspberry", "Goofy Grape", and "Jolly Ollie Orange."  Kool-Aid won and now rules as the sugar drink of choice.<br /><br />It now seems the choices are a lot more varied these days.  I guess all the competition from other those squeeze pouches with their unusual flavors have made Kool-Aid keep up with the trends.  No one would have imagined there would ever be a "peach mango" Kool-Aid or that it would actually taste like anything other than sugar water with some fake flavor.  But this stuff tastes pretty good - even fruit like.  It makes me wonder if the rest of the stuff has changed over the years as well.  In summary, this tastes pretty good for sugar water.  Isn't modern science great!!

review/summary: Actually does have a mango flavor
review/text: Growing up my mom refused to buy Kool Aid so I never had it as a kid at my parents house but had it at my friends whenever I had the opportunity to go there. As an adult I don't buy Kool Aid either for my kids but when given the opportunity from Vine to try this new flavor I decided why not? Personally I wouldn't buy it again but if you're a lover of Kool Aid then this definitely delivers. It does have that mango flavor that you can actually taste. The kids actually enjoyed it as well. Whoever said this isn't a drink that kids would enjoy as well probably doesn't have kids.<br /><br />We recently took a trip to the Caribbean and the kids got the opportunity to actually eat hand picked mangoes and my 11year old son said "this taste like the mango we had in St. Vincent" and he was right. It states that it has 33% less sugar and has vitamins C & E combined. As far as the sugar content I can't really state if this is true or not but it's good to know that it does have a few vitamins that's good for you. In my household we drink more water than juice but if given again I'd definitely drink it since it makes a great thirst quencher for hot summer days.

review/text: I'm not much of a peach-mango fan, so I went into drinking this as a skeptic. So when I say "I did not dislike it" that's a compliment. I usually can't stand any kind of peach drink, but I didn't mind the Kool-Aid. My girlfriend, who likes MiO's Peach Mango flavor, gave this high marks, as did her best friend.<br /><br />Note that this Kool-Aid is pre-sweetened, so you don't have to add sugar unless you like your "sweet" the kind of sweet you find in Southern sweet tea.<br /><br />You can also vary the amount of water you add here to great effect; unlike some lemonades, where it tastes "wrong" unless you get the mixture just so, here it varies from a full-bodied fruit punch to a refreshing, slightly fruity thirst quencher.

The flavor is Peach with a Mango aftertaste. There are no "bad" or "artificial" tastes, just a nice tropical blend. It makes a great Breakfast juice first thing in the morning.<br />And while not my favorite flavors, it is still very nice when you are thirsty. The mix comes in a container where the lid is your mixing guide. My one complaint is that it that the label that holds the lid on also has half of the instructions.

The Peach Mango Kool Aid is already been mixed with Sugar so all you have to do is add the amount of water that is necessary and drink it. This is a great low calorie juice option at only 60 calories per 8 fluid oz. As for how it tastes, the peach enhances the mango flavor giving it a soft non overpowering sweet taste. This is a great new flavor from Kool Aid and I can't wait to try other combinations in the future!

review/text: There is no question that Kool-Aid has been putting the smiles on so many people over the years. But they definitely have had a lack of strong tropical flavors. Their Peach Mango drink mix gives a nice, mild flavor combining the elegance of peach with the tangy twist of mango which blends in very nicely. I was a bit mixed at first, but overall pleasantly surprised at how good it tastes. It honestly is better than those tiring cherry and grape flavors after awhile, and definitely a nice change of pace for the kids. Overall, I definitely recommend that you give Kool-Aid's new Peach Mango flavor a try, and simply drift into a twist on sweet peach and tangy mango madness.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Taste: B<br /><br />Overall: B

It was just okay for me. The peach and mango flavoring is very light. Also the sugar was a bit too much. I found myself having to add more Kool-aid than was suggested to get the fruit flavor to be stronger. I could taste the sugar no problem but I really wanted to taste more of the fruit flavoring. Even my kids, who are sugar fiends thought the sugary taste was too much. They also agreed that it needed a stronger fruit flavor. The Kool-aid does mix well and the sugar does dissolve well. It was an okay flavor.

review/text: It has been a while since I have had koolaid. I remember when I was younger my mom didn't like to buy it, because they only sold the packets that you had to add sugar to and she didn't want us drinking all that sugar. Now that Koolaid comes in the tubs with the sugar already included, it is much easier to deal with. We now have the option to make just one glass at a time, rather than having to create a whole pitcher because we have to add sugar.<br /><br />I am a big fan of peach flavor, and this peach mango Koolaid is no exception. The taste is great! There is the perfect blend of mango versus peach. I love that I can add the amount of powder that I prefer and someone else can make a glass at the same time and add the amount of powder that they like.

However, as an alternative to other sugar-sweetened beverages, it is economical (almost two quarts for a dollar) and convenient, because you're not bringing big heavy bottles home from the store.

review/text: Kool Aid's been around for 85 years and most folks have tried it at some time so I'm reviewing the flavor not the idea that it is Kool Aid versus other drink choices. The flavor is called peach mango but it is the mango that dominates the drink. As a family who loves peaches and likes mango, it seemed like a good fit but it really should be called Mango with a hint of Peach.  So, if you love mango-flavored foods and drinks you'll enjoy this. If you are looking for the peach flavor to be equal (or more because it is first in the title)to the mango then you'll be disappointed.  Also, using the directed amount exactly made the flavor taste a bit "thin"; adding a couple of teaspoons to the directed amount improved the richness of the flavor but didn't change it from mango to more of a peach-mango pair.

To me, Kool Aid has that distinctive flavor to it that reminds me of other kids' houses growing up - coming in from playing outside and their mom gives you some red Kool Aid that turned your lips red.  (We didn't have this stuff in my house growing up.).  This stuff - the "peach mango" version of Kool Aid, tastes to me like a more of an "adult" drink.  I don't think kids would like "peach mango" anything.  I didn't mind it - but I didn't think it was amazing either.  It was sort of like a more flavorful version of Crystal Light.<br />I'm not a fan of these drink mixes, even Crystal Light.  I don't trust the chemicals they use, the sweeteners, even the "natural" flavorings used.  You'd be surprised where those actually come from!<br />But, overall, I liked the flavor, but I wouldn't think kids would like it, and I wouldn't buy it again for myself.

I love Bolt house Mango Peach, and this is gives me good light fresh taste similar to the fresh mango flavor, sort of like if you diluted the Bolt house. If you like Mango you will love this. Makes a great punch for punch bowl.<br /><br />  Renita's Mango Punch<br /> Mix whole 19 ounce container with 1 gallon water. Fill Jell-O mold or bundt shape or even round bowl, and freeze overnight. You can add fruit to this if you prefer. Refrigerate rest of Kool-Aid.<br /><br />Party time place in punch bowl (optional 1/2 gallon pineapple sherbet and) frozen mango Kool-Aid.  Pour remaining Kool-Aid over top. Next add 1(2 liter or 6 -12 ounce cans) of sweet ginger ale. Are any that start with s:shasta<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WEC3JC">Shasta Ginger Ale, 33.81-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 15)</a>, segrams<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002U8W3MI">Seagram's Ginger Ale, 12 oz Can (Pack of 24)</a>) or if you prefer 7UP you can add more soda to taste. Remember sherbet is optional punch is good without it.

review/summary: Go Koolaid!
review/text: I was an instant fan of this product. My kids? Even more! The only downside is the same downside as the rest of the pre-sweetened koolaid products... I couldn't control the amount of sugar in it. However, if you're in a pinch and need something quick, this will certainly refresh kids and adults alike.

review/summary: Toss-Up
review/text: I served this as a treat to a bunch of ten year old boys who LOVED it.  The pitcher was gone before the ice had a chance to melt. I snagged a glass before it was gone and I didn't have the same reaction as the boys.  Maybe because I am a product of the Kool-Aid generation?  Nothing sends me into flashbacks of happiness like the original.  This one was just "ok" and since we are a healthier family I would rather enjoy the classic flavor as a treat.  The boys were split 50/50 on who liked the Peach Mango flavor better than the original.  Either way, I don't think it is disappointing or off-the-mark, rather a taste preference.

review/text: This isn't bad.  I used to like Kool-Aid when I was a kid, especially the red flavors.  Or mixing a red with grape was also quite good.  I'm just not sure about the Mango.  I like mango flavor, and this does taste like mango to me, but it doesn't do it for me as a drink.  I also tried this with my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KYT6CS">Sodastream Fountain Jet Soda Maker Starter Kit</a>, but it's not much better carbonated.  It's too sweet.  Perhaps the packets where you can add the sugar yourself would be better.

review/summary: Way better than the UTZ brand
review/text: The UTZ select pretzel pieces (honey mustard & onion) really is disgusting.  Same concept which Snyder's perfected but a poor imitation. Actually I want to complain to UTZ, which I have never done with any food company for dissatisfaction but it didn't cost me too much and they know it.<br /><br />Snyder's lost 1 star because it has high sodium. If you're not washing down gallons of water with this you might get kidney stones.  All crunchy snack foods are like that but this one is worth it.  Also Honey mustard & Onion is the only flavor to get, I don' know why they bother to put out other flavors because they're not very good.  Yes, it is subjective.<br /><br />To the reviewer that gave it 1 star for being too hard, man, brush your teeth more so you have perfect teeth and gums like I do.  Get more foods with texture, hardness, and different consistency. Fritos Twist come in a second to hardest compared to this.<br /><br />Again, do not get the UTZ brand that packages it just like this one.

They're sweet, with just a little cinnamon kick.  My son even likes to sneak a few on their own when I'm baking and he thinks I'm not looking.

I thought this was a result of shipping, but after buying this in a store, it is simply how it is made.<br /><br />The cereal is closer to the expiration date than most stores, but one person can easily eat it all before it even comes close to being questionable.  I've never had the problem of freshness.<br /><br />This is a high quality cereal and one I truly miss.  I will be buying this again and again.

review/summary: Really good cereal, one of my favorites!
review/text: I don't generally eat "kid" cereals such as Froot Loops, Cocoa Puffs, etc but if you like Rice Krispies Treats you might just love this cereal. It's not sticky and chewy like a Rice Krispies treat, but more crispy. Once milk is poured over it softens a bit while still maintaining the shape and flavor of a broken up Rice Krispies treat. It's not too sweet, it seems to have just the right amount of sweetness to make it delicous. My kids also enjoy this cereal. The only drawback is that when I order this they eat it up so quickly. If I had only ordered Raisin Bran I would still have it.

review/summary: Ummm Good!
review/text: We really likes these Rice Krispies Treats Cereal. It should be all bigger pieces though! I give it 4 stars because there is alot of that powdery sludge at the bottom of every bowl. Most cereal only has the sludge at the last bowl, but this seems to have it with every bowl you have out of it... Was like that with all the boxes too- Other than that it was good.

review/text: Delicious like the regular snack Treats but a sugar rush  is the last thing I need early in the morning. As a snack by hand out of the box at other times fine.

review/summary: Love the stuff, but this item was alone
review/text: I love this cereal and have not been able to find it for years. It turns out it's here on amazon as well as only in walmart super stores, which sucks because I hate walmart with a passion and won't go there unless it's something I can't get anywhere else or it's late and I need it.<br /><br />However the problem here is that this products description says it's a pack of 4 but I only got 1 box and it says that it's package 1 of 1 and completes my order.<br /><br />When I seen the normal sized box it came in, I thought "well I'm the noob for not reading. It was probably 4 travel boxes" but it wasn't when I opened it and it was just 1 normal box, bot 4 as described.<br /><br />5 for the cereal, 1 for this service.

review/summary: Too sweet , bad flavor
review/text: I'm a fan of regular rice Krispies, but this cereal is something gone horribly wrong.  It is much too sweet and has a really bad flavor to it - I'm not really sure how to describe it.  I'm a fan of lucky charms, cookie crisp, etc .. but I just can not eat this stuff.

review/summary: Rice Krispies Treats Cereal. Best Thing. EVER
review/text: First off i was a bit weary due to other reviews sayin the cereal was expiring soon. My cereal came packed very well, 4 boxes of beautiful rice krispies treats cereal which didnt expire for about 8 months. opening the first box was epic...those first big chunks were huge! and despite shipping the cereal was in great condition. Now, as someone who eats cereal once maybe twice a week, i tell you this. all 4 boxes were gone in a week. This cereal is simply AMAZING. childhood memory lane. i ordered frankenberry and booberry afterwards too, but this cereal is 10x better then both. Fortunately, i found a specialty store which carries this cereal :) but had i not, i would be spending alot more money on amazon.

review/text: I used to snack on this rather than eating things like cookies, donuts, and other sweets.  Imagine my disappointment when all the grocery stores I went to quit carrying it.  As soon as I saw it here I placed my first order.  I've reordered it twice already.  It's sweet but not not overly sweet like cereals like "Super Sugar Crisp" or "Froot Loops" (I never have liked Froot Loops).  Rice Krispies Treats cereal tastes just like the name says.

review/text: I LOVE LOVE LOVE this cereal and first had it as a kid in California maybe 10-12 years ago.  Imagine my saddness when I couldn't find it ANYWHERE in Southern California.  I went to NY and found it in the grocery store and then moved back to CA and found it on Amazon!
