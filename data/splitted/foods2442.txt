review/text: I eat one of these on a daily basis on my way to gym after work as an on-the-go meal. These are nutritious and provide a good amount of protein and vitamins but not overly sweet like some other protein/nutrition bars. I have been eating gluten free and these are one of my favorite gluten free products.

review/text: Kind bars are expensive, but so worth it! They make great snacks, are very nutritious, and gluten free! The chocolate will melt, so another flavor might be better if you need to keep them in a hot car, or backpack on a hot day, but this flavor is what Snickers wish they were!

review/text: I love these cereal bars...the mixed nuts with protein bars are my favorite. They have the right amount of crunch and have 10gm of protein. They are definitely very heavy on 'calories from fat' but keep me full much longer than a regular cereal bar. The best part I like about these bars is that they are not extra sugary and have the right amount of sugar to just remove the blandness of the nuts. LOVE IT.

review/summary: Fresh Nutty & Fruity On the Go Snack
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised that this bar actually tasted like a handful of fresh nuts & fruit. Usually snack, protein or energy bars taste chemically. Not this one. It would be a convenient food to take to eat on-the-go. But, be warned. It's a bit on the sticky side (and I didn't carry it in the sun or in a car...). So either bring along a moist towelette or use a squirt of those towel free hand sanitizers to eliminate sticky finger syndrome. I'd suggest not eating this particular bar while driving because of that. The calories were not too high for this class of food product (190) and the sodium wasn't obnoxious (20mg - I've seen worse), but I wish they'd get the sugars to under 9g (they're 12g). While I wouldn't eat these bars every day, for nutritional & calorie reasons, it's a brand I'll keep on hand for quick emergency hunger fixes.

review/text: I love the cranberry bar. It has the right about of crunch and sweetness. I eat them midday and it keeps me full until dinner. Some people were complaining that the nuts in the bars were a bit stale. I didn't run across that problem, but they were sticky (just pop them in the fridge and they should be fine). You can buy them at kroger but they are much cheaper at amazon (almost half the price if you get a subscription).<br />I also had the dark chocolate cherry bar but I didn't buy it from amazon. It's really sweet and not to my liking. It's a good replacement if you normally eat a candy bar but that's just my opinion.<br />Go order some you won't regret it.

review/text: While this bar (Almond Walnut Macadamia with Peanuts) is really tasty, I was surprised by the misleading description because Peanuts are actually the first ingredient (you have to lift the marketing flap on the packaging to discern the actual ingredients), yet they say "Almond Walnut Macadamia + Protein with Peanuts".

review/text: I discovered these bars some time ago at my local grocery store - they were on this little display with some other things. The next time I went there, I couldn't find them. And I couldn't really remember what they were called. So, I was very excited when I saw them at Starbucks probably a year later. They are, of course, way too expensive there! I wasn't able to find them reliably anywhere around town, so I found them online and now I have two boxes (two different flavors) auto-shipped to me from Amazon. Now I have begun to see these in stores more often so I've been trying some other flavors.<br /><br />I used to eat Kashi cereal each morning but now I have one of these bars with my requisite Dr. Pepper. I'm not sure how long ago I changed my breakfast choice, but I have lost about 15 pounds (that needed to be lost) since I changed over to the bars. I definitely didn't change earlier than November, 2010. And, instead of being starving at 11 a.m., I don't get seriously hungry until later.*<br /><br />* These claims have not been evaluated by anyone, and no animals have been tortured to prove them.

Bonus. So, I picked up a few on close-out at my local grocer.<br /><br />Made in Australia, stored on a shelf, put on close-out, and traveled around in my bag for awhile... not even close to expiration, but still... it has been around.  I expected a mediocre nut bar. Not so. It's so good I felt compelled to look online for more.<br /><br />Looking over the ingredients list, nothing stands out as "The Flavor" that makes these so tasty, so I'll just leave it at that. Simple, sweet and soft, crunchy and flavorful. I wish I would have bought the rest of the ones I saw on close-out. These are good.

I will definitely be ordering these again.

review/summary: delicious
review/text: I am gluten-free and dairy-free, so there are not a lot of "on the go" food choices.  Some, like the Lara bars, are really dense and don't resemble real food.  The Kind bars however taste fresh with a nice mix of flavors.  The Cranberry Almond is my favorite, followed closely by the Almond Apricot.  They are resilient enough to be carried around in my purse for "food emergencies".  They get a little flat, but hold up much better than a banana and still taste great.  Good price on Amazon, I pay over $20/box at local stores.

review/summary: Healthy Candy Bar!
review/text: Of all the KIND bars (and I've had them all) this one will hit the spot if you're craving the taste and texture of caramel and nuts. What's nice is that the fat content is relatively low for something that really can qualify as a comfort snack, while the nuts and other unprocessed goodies will give you sustained energy and the important OMGA-3.<br /><br />I've removed all the junk snacks from our home and put in boxes of KIND Bars; this one is the one I have to restock most often. If you're curious, go to your local health food store and pay $2.00 for a single bar; I promise you'll be back here ordering it by the box.

review/summary: Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio + Antioxidants
review/text: First got turned onto these bars at Starbucks. Our favorite is the blueberry vanilla & cashew but Amazon does not offer this combo for some reason. So I ordered the  Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio + Antioxidants as well as another type, figuring that even if the kids did not like it my husband would take the remainders to work to snack on midday. Well no one likes this flavor. It consists of a lot of the puffed filler grains used in cheap bars, almost like smaller firmer rice crispies. I even had the box in the car to pull out when the kids were starving as a snack but no go and husband doesn't like them. The other kind I ordered was the fruit and nut delight which everyone will eat, but our favorite remains the blueberry vanilla and cashews.

review/text: I've had other Kind bars and this one is okay (I don't particularly care for the taste). In my opinion, it's too sweet (while I occasionally indulge in sweet things, this isn't what I had expected with this product). Every bar is 40g and there are 13g of sugar. Yikes. I wish I had looked this up before I purchased this because I have nine more bars. What's worse, instead of getting twelve bars, my box only came with ten. I will not be ordering this or any other Kind bars.

It is very satisfying on many levels as well as healthy for me. Kind told me that the price I paid for these on Amazon is excellent since they typically retail at $2. per bar in stores. These are so incredible that I possibly could go into 'withdrawal' without my daily Kind fix!

review/summary: Delicious and satisfying all-purpose bar
review/text: Almost every breakfast/snack bar is plastered with claims that it's "satisfying" and "nutritious."  Ironically, the exact opposite is usually the case:  the bar amounts to a couple of bites of chemical-laden chalk comprised of over-processed protein isolate and corn syrup.  These KIND bars are one of the only available bars on the market that actually ARE delicious, nutritious, and filling.<br /><br />I'm a chocolate and peanut butter fiend, and before I discovered KIND bars, I had abandoned my years-long quest for a bar that contained chocolate and peanut butter without being a glorified candy bar devoid of nutritive value.  I have one almost every day for breakfast, and for hours afterward I feel both satisfied and energetic, in contrast to the jittery 30-minute sugar rush followed by a swift crash provided by other brands.

review/text: This bar has cranberries, almonds, and macadamia nuts (NOT bits and pieces!) as their main ingredients, in a soft honey-like glaze to keep it all together.  I refrigerate them in the summer or they kind of "wilt".  The ingredients are fresh, and the nuts are crunchy.  What I really appreciate about these bars is that it really takes time to eat and enjoy them.  Those nuts are meant to be chewed and not inhaled, unlike a lot of snacks that disappear as soon as you get the wrapper off.  I can't eat one in front of my favorite dog, as this is one snack I am too fond of to share with her... much to her dismay.  I think they are worth the cost, and I know they cost way more if you find them in a local grocery store.

review/text: I was looking forward to receiving this order. Almonds, macadamias, and walnuts! Sounded delicious.<br />Then I tried one, and was puzzled. Yes, I could taste some almond, but WOW, the  main flavor was PEANUTS. The ingredients list peanuts as the largest amount of nuts. This should be called the Peanut, Almond Bar. If one likes to have the main flavor of a nut bar as peanuts, you will enjoy this.<br />The quality of KIND products I appreciate, as well as the low GI, the natural properties, and having a healthier choice. But honesty in advertising and product would be appreciated.<br /><br />I was disappointed with the deception, and the unexpectedly strong flavor of peanuts, as I purchased it for the nuts I like best, which were supposed to be the main source of nut protein.<br />Let's get honest KIND!

review/text: These were a staple for my gluten-free teenager until a few months ago when she started complaining that they tasted different, not in a good way.  We found out that the company has moved to a new factory/producer and that the formula has changed in some ways.  The flavor is not as fresh and tastes more like processed food. We are really disappointed and are hoping that the company can somehow find its way back to making really great bars.

So I've tried a lot of bars and frankly they range around mediocre,  pretending to be something (chocolate!)that they are clearly not.<br /><br />So what are these bars like?  Great!  Really delicious - full of nuts you can see and taste,  not too sweet,  as often these bars are, and it has protein!  A happy find,  we bought a box and will buy more,  I can see it becoming a staple in our cupboards.<br /><br />May 2010 - on to my third order,  so this is a really great snack in our house.  The protein really does help fill you up,  it's a perfect snack,  and all of us think it's delicious (though my son does prefer the macadamia passionfruit, this one has protein and that makes it a much better bar for me and my husband and our low sugar tendencies)

Very tasty combination and I highly recommend.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: KIND PLUS Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio bars are very delicious.  I enjoy one bar and a glass of orange/carrot juice every morning.  Dr Oz recommends that you eat protein within the first hour after waking; you will get protein from this bar.  I really love the fresh taste and texture.  2012 UPDATE: I usually get bored with food, but not these bars!  I still have my juice and this Pom/Blue/Pistach bar every single morning for breakfast.  I don't kind-a-like KIND, I totally love it!!!

review/text: I am new to the "Kind" family of products and ordered these bars after talking with a friend.  WOW!  These are amazing!  They serve as a total meal replacement when I'm on the go, but still taste good enough to be considered a snack.  I have now also tried the cranberry/almond (which are tasty, but sticky enough that I have learned not to eat them in the car)and the Vanilla Blueberry Granola and Cinnamon Oat Cereal as well.  These are GREAT products and I recommend them highly.  I've never written a review for anything before, but "Kind" words needed to be said!!!

review/summary: Solid GF protein to have on hand
review/text: My daughter and I have Celiac Disease and in our experience, lunch is the hardest meal of the day. When we are at home we are fine, but when we are at work or school, it is either difficult to find safe Gluten Free food or a clean enough location in which to eat that food without contaminating it by all the meals previously eaten there. We try to carry our lunch when possible, but we rely on safety net foods such as the Kind Plus Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate and Protein Bars to save us in a pinch or help us have energy to get home.

review/summary: Fabulous option for on-the-go snacks for those who eat Gluten Free!
review/text: I used to regularly grab various brands of granola and meal replacement bars when I was too busy to eat a proper meal, but since becoming gluten intolerant I have found myself at a loss for what to purchase.  Even seemingly innocent products would have hidden ingredients waiting to make me feel miserable.  Anyone who is gluten intolerant (or is allergic, or has Celiac) knows how frustrating it can be to find convenient foods, despite the growing number of food producers who are aware and clearly mark their packaging as "gluten free".<br /><br />Then, thanks to the bride at a recent wedding I photographed, I found Kind bars.  The almond-cranberry ones were the type she offered me as a snack while the bridesmaids were getting ready, and I found them to be a fabulous mix of flavors and have a very palatable texture (perhaps a bit on the dry side, but it's a nut bar, so have something to drink handy).  The amount of fiber and protein in these bars is quite filling even with the small portion size, and there are no worries about sugar drops thanks to the low-glycemic recipe.<br /><br />I highly recommend these to not just those who are gluten intolerant, but also for anyone who wants a healthy on-the-go snack that will actually sustain you until your next meal.  So far I haven't been disappointing by any flavors I've tried and just ordered a few I haven't seen anywhere in stores and look forward to reviewing those as well.

Good quality, sturdy enough to toss in a purse or backpack, and pleasantly sweet without being overwhelming.  Good substitute for candy when I want a treat.  Filling enough to hold me several hours when I'm on the go.

review/text: The only problem with this bar is that once you try it you can't seem to do without it, it tastes that good.<br />Dr. OZ mentioned these bars on his show so we thought we would try one, WOW! we love them.<br />This particular one, (KIND PLUS Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew) if you read the ingredients you will find not one thing that is bad for you. Finally a treat that won't harm you......unless you eat about six a day...(calories)<br />We checked quite a few places that handle this product and Amazon is by far the best price.

review/text: I have been buying these Cranbery Almond Kind Bars at the grocery store.  I was so glad to see Amazon has them cheaper.  They're delicious and healthy.<br /><br />Kind Bars come in seveal flavors, but the Cranberry Almond is the only one with low glycemic index.  That's very important!  I don't feel guilty at all when I eat one.  Yummy and healthy.  What could be better.  And they're gluten free.

review/text: Tastes great and satisfies my hunger. I am currently on a fitness diet and I don't feel guilty when I am eating one of these.  Since there are no "melty" ingredients, it stays in tact in hot cars, at beaches etc which is an added bonus.  I took a star off because the calorie count is a bit high, but I chalk that up to the great taste and the fact that it fills you up.

I was not to fond of the super nutty one - but to each their own)<br />These in particular have an addictive quality which hurts my bank account.<br />you shouldn't be eating more than one of them in a day though, so it's honestly not that bad of a deal.<br />They just taste so darn good.
