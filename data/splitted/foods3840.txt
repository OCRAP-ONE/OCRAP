review/summary: Healthy dogs
review/text: I've been feeding my dogs this canned food mixed in with their Organix kibble for about a year.  They are very healthy.  I have two 70 pound Goldendoodles, one with bilateral hip dysplasia.  I have fed them various food over the past five years and none seem to agree with them more than this Castor & Pollux.  One of my dogs has terrible gastric problems with gurgling and passing gas and he hasn't experienced any of that eating this food.  I'm glad to be able to get it on Amazon. Saves me a lot of money compared to the pet store where I was buying it.

review/text: I've tried other foods in the past, but I have never gotten such a positive reation from my husky like I did with this food! I usually mix it with with dry food and she eats it all! In the past she would only lick up a majority of the canned food and would leave the dry, but with just 2 table spoons of this product is enough to have her finish everything every time!

review/text: My dog loves this brand of canned dog food.  I used to cook for her but lately, due to unfortunate circumstances, I do not have the time.  This food has been great for us!  My dog eats this and then looks at me like "give me more please"  haha...  Also It was really fast shipping.  I signed up for auto ship to get one every month.  Also the price is much better than at the pet store where they charge about $2.50 or more per can.

review/text: I've always bought high quality foods for my dogs.  The past couple years my 16 yr. old has had diarrhea.  The vet prescribed medications that sometimes worked.  She's a picky eater and never liked any canned food I tried.  I switched her to the Organix Turkey flavors and she eats well and the diarrhea is gone!  I don't need to give her any medications either.  It's expensive, but she's worth it and I'm not fooling around with the vet and have the peace of mind that she eating.

review/summary: My dog LOVES this........
review/text: We used to have two pomeranians - Autumn and Teddie.  Ever since we lost Teddie last summer, Autumn became very depressed and wouldn't eat.  We tried so many different brands including home-cooked, he would only ate a couple times and wouldn't touch it anymore.  He lost so much weight and got us so worried.  But that all changed when we found Organix and that's the only brand Autumn will eat.  Now, he can't wait until I feed him every morning.  The cost Amazon offered is less expenisve than other retailers and you can't beat free shipping!!  Please continue carrying it!!

review/text: Just so anyone knows, I think they have a stockpile of Turkey, Chicken, Veggies flavor.  All the cases I have ordered the last 6 months have the same expiration date in 2013.  My dog eats this flavor no problems every day, so for me this is a good chance to stock up on organic food at an unbeatable price.  $17 for a case after sub & save is going to be virtually unbeatable I would presume, so 5 stars amazon.

review/summary: Don't buy this garbage!
review/text: I bought a case of this (Adult Organic Turkey and Organic Vegetables Formula)12.7 oz cans beause my dog adores the Organix Dry Dog Food  and he does very well on it. As soon as I gave him a little canned (a small amount mixed with his other food) he started vomiting white foamy stuff the following morning.  I ended up giving a can to a friend and her dog had horrible breath (from his stomach--does not have bad teeth). I didn't give the rest away, will throw it away. I emailed the company twice and they couldn't  bother to respond in about two weeks. Apparently they don't stand by their products. Now I don't trust any of their products even though my dog does fine on the dry formula.

review/summary: high-potency taste at good value
review/text: Saccharin wouldn't be my first choice sweetener based on taste alone, hence the 1 less star, but value-for-strength in taste, this product beats all other non-calorie sweeteners I've tried. Sucralose tastes better in my opinion (less bitter), but is way more expensive, and typically only packets are sold, not tablets. Necta-sweet works great in coffee, since coffee is already bitter, so bitter in OK.<br />Most importantly, there are no added calories from fillers in this product. So if manufacturers want to add crap like dextrose and maltodextrin into a supposedly no-calorie sweetener, we don't have to buy it, since there's Necta-Sweet.<br />Last but not least, it comes in convenient form. Popping tablets into a drink is easier than tearing open packets. It dissolves easier than I expected, too.

review/text: We got stuck on NectaSweet years ago when it was sold in many of our supermarkets, but apparently they didn't move the inventory quick enough and finally we could not find it in any stores.  My wife tried several of the other brands of artificial sweeteners, but none were as satisfying as NectaSweet.  I finally thought about checking it on the internet and found it was still available and bought three bottles.  We love it so much we would have bought more, but there was a limit of three bottles where we bought it.  We will be sure to re-order from Amazon.com next time we run low.

review/summary: Best Oolong I can afford!
review/text: First of all this tea is not from Formosa. It's from India. That said the way this tea has been picked & dried has produced a high quality cup of organic Oolong tea. At a fair price. Most Oolong costs about the same for 3 to 4 oz only! Note all tea is from the same species of plant. so the growing conditions, leaf stage at picking & the drying process dictate the final cup most. together with storage & handling by the packer & you the consumer. Davidson has got this tea to me in good condition.<br /><br />This tea looks like green beads when dry. When brewed complete leaves unfurl with a only a small number of broken leaves. Chinese style tea does not grade by leave size, like black teas from India & Ceylon. These leaves will give 2 to three re-brewings by just adding hot water & allowing a 2nd infusion after 1st brewing has been poured. 1st brewing stronger & less sweet than 2nd brewing.<br /><br />This style of tea is drunk without the addition of milk, sugar or lemon.<br />It has a faint aroma of  honey on the nose & subtle natural sweetness. However if your palate is used to drink very sweet soda then this may be too subtle.<br /><br />Tip put a few leaves in travel mug. add hot water & top up during the day with fresh hot water unto twice or three times. But remove the lid to smell the tea, to enjoy the subtle aroma, if safe to do so ( at your desk not traveling in a car).<br /><br />I am told that:<br />This has zero calories, high in flavonoids so is a healthy alternative to diet soda etc.<br />Some also find this style of tea aids digestion (note most chinese drink tea with food for this reason). May Help in calming a stomach, if lunch was a little too rich in fat.<br /><br />Other teas from Davidsons I like are:<br />Ceylon black OP & English Breakfast These I drink with milk added.

It is grown in India which i prefer to it being grown in China, this is also why the name is "Formosa STYLE Oolong" and not "Formosa Oolong". It has a very smooth and great taste and can be re steeped if you want. I like to steep it for 5-7 minutes for a more bold flavor instead of the 3-5 minutes recommended on the bag.

review/text: I discovered Cattlemen's Tangy Gold on a turkey sandwich wrap at WaWa (gas/convenience store).  For years I searched for it on grocery shelves and finally saw the waitlist here at Amazon.  You don't need much to get a load of flavor.  I use it instead of other condiments on sandwiches, hamburgers, hot dogs, pork chops, ribs, chicken, and meatloaf. Lately, I've been adding it to prepared salads like tuna, egg (also deviled eggs), potato, and pasta.  It adds a unique flavor and beautiful color. I hope Amazon continues to offer this product.  The 6-pack means I can share with friends (or not).

review/summary: The Best Carolina BBQ Sauce
review/text: I've recently developed what some people might describe as an obsession with Carolina BBQ sauce. I've searched the internet, scanned grocery shelves, adventured through big box stores and raided every market I could find to seek out the best bottled Carolina BBQ money can buy.<br /><br />Here it is, folks: Cattlemen's Carolina Tangy Gold beats any of the others hands-down (and trust me, I've tried many). It is the perfect balance of sweet, smoky, vinegar, mustard and spice. Other sauces tend to be a little overpowering with one flavor or another, but I've found this one to be the perfect blend. I had my eye on this sauce for a while, but I hesitated a bit because I didn't want to buy a pack of six, dislike it, and then waste 5 1/2 bottles of sauce. I'm glad I went for it. If you like this style of barbecue, you'll love this sauce.

review/summary: THERE ARE MANY GOOD BRANDS OF BREWERS YEAST - TWIN LABS ADDS TASTE & VALUE TO A WINNING FORMULA
review/text: IN A NUTSHELL: VERY GOOD TASTING "REAL BREWER'S YEAST" -- NOTHING ADDED<br /><br />This "Genuine Brewer's Yeast" powder tastes very good for real Brewers Yeast. Having said that, remember this is not a vitamin or mineral -- BREWER'S YEAST is one of the ultimate super-foods, a veritable food supplement by itself. Traditionally, people who have been involved with weight lifting, body building or competitive sports that require strength, and muscle building have found that Brewer's Yeast had preceded them. It has very well balanced amino-acids plus all the B-complex vitamins which include large doses of Inositol and Choline. Add to this, the best, and most bioavailable source of chromium and selenium too, as well as many trace minerals and elements. AND - they're all naturally occurring -- nothing is added, no preservatives, sugars or additives of any kind. Really good food is what this Brewer's Yeast is, and you can add it to many things. Right now, I have a tablespoon mixed in with a huge glass of very diluted orange juice, but you can put it in anything you want, including; casseroles, yogurt, soup, juices, meat loaf, salads, milk and of course water. Honestly, I have been using this stuff on myself for over 40 years. Truly, I've never gotten over the wonder of how well, and alert Brewer's Yeast has always made me feel. My guess is that the large quantities of Inositol and Choline are the key to the alertness, combined with the natural amino-acids.<br /><br />BELOW IS A COPY OF THE LABELING INFO THAT IS PROBABLY EASIER TO READ -- remember, all the nutrients are naturally occurring - nothing is added!<br /><br />Supplement Facts<br /><br />Serving Size: 1 heaping tablespoonful (16 g)<br /><br />Servings per container: 31<br /><br />Amount Per Serving % Daily Value<br /><br />Calories 35<br /><br />Protein 8 g 16%<br /><br />Thiamin 1.4 mg 93%<br /><br />Riboflavin 0.7 mg 41%<br /><br />Niacin 5.3 mg 27%<br /><br />Vitamin B6 0.6 mg 30%<br /><br />Folic Acid 240 mcg 60%<br /><br />Vitamin B12 2 mcg 33%<br /><br />Biotin 16 mcg 5%<br /><br />Pantothenic Acid 0.4 mg 4%<br /><br />Calcium 59 mg 6%<br /><br />Iron 1.5 mg 8%<br /><br />Phosphorus 234 mg 23%<br /><br />Magnesium 33 mg 8%<br /><br />Zinc 1.2 mg 8%<br /><br />Copper 0.5 mg 25%<br /><br />Manganese 0.13 mg 7%<br /><br />Chromium 60 mcg 50%<br /><br />Sodium 60 mg 3%<br /><br />Potassium 222 mg 6%<br /><br />Alanine 592 mg *<br /><br />Arginine 464 mg *<br /><br />Aspartic Acid 800 mg *<br /><br />Glutamic Acid 1120 mg *<br /><br />Glycine 400 mg *<br /><br />Histidine 208 mg *<br /><br />Isoleucine2,3 400 mg *<br /><br />Cystine 112 mg *<br /><br />Leucine2,3 624 mg *<br /><br />Lysine' 592 mg *<br /><br />Methionine' 144 mg *<br /><br />Phenylalanine' 368 mg *<br /><br />Proline 400 mg *<br /><br />Threonine' 400 mg *<br /><br />Serine 448 mg *<br /><br />Tryptophan1,2 96 mg *<br /><br />Tyrosine 304 mg *<br /><br />Valine2,3 480 mg *<br /><br />'The L-Tryptophan in the product is naturally present in the protein.

Interestingly, the larger vendors tend to have fresher product, and this is evidenced by the expiration date on the jar which typically gives you about 2 years on these vacuum sealed containers.<br /><br />THERE ARE MANY GOOD BRANDS OF BREWERS YEAST - TWIN LABS ADDS TASTE & VALUE TO A WINNING FORMULA<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE:<br /><br />[WE AND I ARE NOT INVOLVED IN THE SALE OR PROMOTION OF THIS OR ANY OTHER PRODUCT -- I SIMPLY BELIEVE IN BREWER'S YEAST AND THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF ABOUT 4 BRANDS THAT I HAVE ALWAYS PURCHASED FOR OUR PERSONAL CONSUMPTION OVER THE YEARS]

review/summary: B Vitamin Bonanza
review/text: I first encountered brewers yeast when pregnant.  It kept coming up again and again as the perfect food based nutritional additive.  Since it is food based and not a suppliment, it is easily absorbed.  However, it is known for its unpleasent taste.  A serving is two heaping tablespoons, and at first I could not find something to mix it in that I liked well enough, so I gave up on it temporarily.  It kept coming up in my researches for a healthy pregnancy, and so returned to it and it has remained part of my daily routine.  The mix I found I like quite well is the two heaping tablespoons mixed into about 5oz of Pom pomagranite juice.  This mixture is actually quite pleasent.<br /><br />I have tried a few different brands, and I am fond of Twinlab for the more palitable taste and the balance of the B vitamins.  The "subscribe and save" deal on Amazon puts it at a very good price.

review/summary: The Cats Like It
review/text: The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPUPSS">Brewer's Yeast</a> is for my cats. Every day I sprinkle a little onto their food. They like the taste of the yeast and regard it as a special treat. The yeast provides them with extra B vitamins.<br /><br />One of the vitamins in the yeast is vitamin B1, thiamine. Many people believe that thiamine repels fleas. This has not been proved. However, since the cats like the yeast, they get in on their food. One 18 ounce bottle seems to last forever. Also, they do not have fleas.

review/text: I ordered this as what is said to be a more bio-available source of chromium and B12, as well as essential amino acids, vitamins, minerals and trace elements, vs most of the peddled chromium supplements. I haven't tried sprinkling it directly on food but I have enjoyed adding it to my shakes and the flavors it imparts. A blender helps when adding to liquids as it seems to mix about as well as powdered cocoa.

review/text: I was looking for a brewers yeast that I could add to my protein drink so as to be able to get the amazing health benefits of brewers yeast also.  This yeast, while I am sure is quite healthy and a huge health benefit, tastes horrible.<br /><br />The taste so changes the taste of the protein drink, that I found that I actually skipped drinking my protein drink rather than have to endure the taste of it with this brewers yeast.<br /><br />Epic Fail.  Now on to try to find a brewers yeast that doesnt make me shudder.

review/summary: Good taste, bad solubility
review/text: I started taking brewers yeast because the large amount of chromium in it is supposed to be very good for your skin, especially if it's acne prone. I've been taking it since the end of January and my skin still breaks out a little bit, but I stopped taking it for a couple of days and my face broke out a lot so I suppose that it is having some sort of an effect. An online review I read said that most people's skin cleared after eight months in an study, so I am staying positive.<br /><br />I started out by taking Swansons' Brewer's Yeast Powder, and mixed it in smoothies and grapefruit juice. I tried mixing it in orange juice, which was pretty bad, and even just having it with water, which was horrible and made me gag. Because I wasn't crazy about the taste, I read some reviews and decided to try this product next. The taste is much better, it is much less noticeable, especially if I add a little bit of peanut butter or grapefruit juice to the smoothies. The taste is also not at all noticeable in warmed apple juice. I don't have the courage to try it in plain water, though.<br /><br />What I dislike about this product is that it does not dissolve well. I cannot stir it in any cold liquid without getting clumps (hopeless when stirred with a spoon or knife, somewhat works when stirred with a fork but little clumps remain), I can barely dissolve all of it in warmed liquids, and if I put it first in my blender when I make the smoothies, a lot of it remains at the bottom. In that respect, I liked Swansons' Brewer's Yeast better. This one is a little bit high maintenance because if I want to just have it in grapefruit juice, I have to put it in the blender first and when I make smoothies, I have to make sure that it's one of the last things to go in. I would, however, buy this product again if I can't find a brewers yeast that has the taste of this product with a better solubility.

review/text: this stuff is ok.  I was hoping it was the flakes but it's a very fine powder, like a flour consistency.  Which makes it kinda turn pasty when sprinkled on veggies or sprinkled on popcorn.  The taste isn't bad, not really great either, but not bad.  I think the yeast flakes would be better, more texture.  But since it only comes in the 3 bottle package, I have 3 bottles to get through now before I can buy the flakes!  If you're not sure you'll like it, try to find it in a single bottle first.

review/summary: Organic, Low Sugar & No Artificial Sugar - Finally!
review/text: We eat healthy. That means my kids drink very little juice and zero soda. By very little I mean I never buy it, they might have some at a friend's house or a party or something. Generally they drink only milk or water. But that means they feel left out when the other kids have sugar-filled juice boxes or caprisuns. Enter Honest Kids! Yes, they have sugar in them, that's what I like. Go look at a box of 'Roaring waters' - that has artificial sweeteners (and sugar too, something I never could quite figure out). I would rather my children had a small amount of real sugar than artificial sweeteners. Since they are used to drinking only water otherwise, they like these, they don't complain they taste watered down. In fact if you compare these to a typical CapriSun, its kind of like the difference between a Vitamin Water and Gatorade. When you are used to Vitamin water, (original) Gatorade is going to taste sickly sweet, if you are used to Gatorade, Vitamin water is going to taste like water with slight flavor. Ask yourself which you want your children to be used to?<br /><br />I've seen other reviewers complain that they are hard to open or messy - my 6 and 8 year olds have no problems with them.  They put the straw in themselves and don't have a problem spilling them.<br /><br />Now they don't feel left out when everyone else has a juice box, and I feel good about the amount of sugar they are taking in. At only 40 calories and no artificial sweeteners, this is exactly what I've been looking for!

review/text: This is a great creamer, it is hard finding Irish Creamer in our hometown and my husband loves this stuff. The only problem I had was when the box arrived, one of the creamers was smushed open and the creamers weren't in a bag just the box so I had the wonderful task of washing each little creamer and finding the culprit in a soggy box. I highly recommend using this creamer, it has a true Irish Cream taste without the alcohol. The price is very good and is lower than what other bulk foods websites are offering for the same brand/type.

review/text: I ordered a 288 count of the International Delight Irish Creme Liquid Creamer for coffee. When the package showed up to it had 288 containers (which i ordered) jammed in a box too small for that amount of creamers. I am sure creamers come in boxes of 20/25/75 etc., but it looks like someone just jammed them all into a box. Some of them leaked milk because they were jammed in the box and made a mess. Last time I'll use Amazon for anything that isn't a hard cover book or DVD etc.. They're packing for fragile items is less than steller.

Thanks Amazon!<br /><br />I was doing great with my subscription for Irish Creme until I received the next delivery.  The outside box was soaked with creamer and I salvaged about 3/4s of the creamers.  I suspect that the containers had been changed and the new ones were not strong enough to endure the knocks and bumps in transporting them.  At any rate, I canceled my subscription and will try again another time in hopes that enough complaints were made that they switched back to the original containers.  I still enjoy a delicious cup of coffee every morning with a smile on my face but without the convenience of Amazon.com!

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00284TSCW">International Delight Irish Creme Liquid Creamer, 288-Count Single-Serve Packages</a><br />Be aware Amazon has to find a better way to ship this product. When I opened the box,I was greeted by<br />a great liquid creamy mess. Thankfully Amazon had packed the little green cups inside a well sealed plastic bag. Otherwise the box most likely would of been a soggy mess. This is why I gave the product a 2 star ratting.(Please be aware Amazon would not let me publish this review the first time with a 2 star ratting Amazon made me change it to a 3 star before they would publish my review)  I did not even open the bag. I just put the whole thing in the garbage can. I called Amazon and they gave me a full credit on this order. Very nice of them. It's to bad too, as I was looking forward to getting these. I also canceled my order for the chocolate liquid creamers as they are packaged the same way. I would not recommend ordering this product. Fully related to the shipping method NOT the product.<br />09/08/1220 Update: It looks as amazon has licked their shipping problem with this item. I took another chance and ordered this again. Low an behold all 288 creamers arrived intact with out one leaking. Which made me very very happy! As I really enjoy this flavor. And now I can give this product a (5)five star rating. So now I can highly recommend this product to anyone who also enjoys International Delight Irish Creme Liquid Creamer. Enjoy World!!!!!

review/text: I love carrot cake and if I have the time, I would make it from scratch. But, I'm busy and usually don't have time to grate carrots and sift flour. This mix will let me put a cake together in under 10 minutes and get great results. The flavor isn't exactly what I would make if I could choose my own spices, but its still good. What I like is it is full of flavor, moist and takes only 1 bowl to stir everything together. No mixer needed.  I might try adding a few walnuts next time around. I will keep several boxes on my pantry shelf. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is I would prefer more carrot flavor and less spice flavor.

review/summary: 5 Star Cake Decadence in a Box
review/text: Duncan Hines recently came out with their Decadent Desserts Line and I've made the Decadent Chocolate and the Decadent Carrot Cakes and found them to be the best out of the box cake mixes I know of.  DH used to have a Signature Line of desserts but I can't find them anywhere so I guess Decadence has replaced them.<br /><br />These are foolproof and fast to make with the chocolate containing 2 packages, one with the cake mix and one with lots of bits and chunks of chocoloate and it is somewhat like a molten chocolate lava cake after you have swirled the ingredients.  The carrot cake comes with all the ingredients  in 2 packages, one with the cake mix and the other with raisins, carrots and spices and is nearly as good as a cake from scratch. Easy to make just add some water, vege oil and 3 eggs to the cake mix and stir 50 times and you are good to go.  Prep time for these is 5 minutes max and then pop it in the pre-heated oven.  Try their Glazes too.  These are so easy that a 5 year old could make them.<br /><br />For just a couple bucks you can have a cake to rival the bakeries cakes.

review/summary: Very easy to cook with, high quality
review/text: These noodles are fantastic. They have a great, slightly chewy bite when prepared al dente, prior to stir frying. They also have good length and great elasticity, which are both very desirable traits in noodles, so that you don't need to worry too much about being overly gentle and can focus on cooking. Even when overcooked and used in soups, these noodles don't fall apart. While hardy, they readily take on flavors of sauces that you use with them. When prepared without any kind of sauce, like for Vietnamese spring rolls, or Bun cha, they have a very clean taste and lightness. They also do not leech out much starch, albeit I stll recommend pre-rinsing them to avoid them from sticking. Overall, a very versatile noodle, and a fantastic price for the quality that you are getting. I live near a 99 Ranch (large Chinese supermarket/grocer in California) and have tried many brands of rice noodles. These are now among my top choices.

review/summary: The real deal.
review/text: I would say this its restaurant quality in terms of authentic Vietnamese rice vermicelli noodles. It's pretty easy to make and difficult to mess up. I've tried other brands where the noodles either come out mushy or break. The texture works mostly with a soup base but the dry version if you want to be creative can work too. Very satisfied with purchase overall.

Not three pounds of regular, they substituted crackers that were all smashed and cappuccino liquer cake.  I opened the day before it was to be gifted to wrap it and was really dissapointed.  decaf for a coffee addict!!!  This turned out to be a really expensive pound of coffee in a nice basket.

review/text: An elderly man (98) that I cared for ate these in his oatmeal w/ flax seed EVERY morning. Our local grocery stores quit carrying the "raspberry" fruit, so I ordered him cases from Amazon whenever his stock was low.

review/summary: Non Organic Chocolate/Cocoa Ruin Best Cookies Ever...
review/text: I almost have tears in my eyes as I type the Truth.  PLEASE READ Before Buying, these were the best Organic based cookies...  Now they should be avoided by all who value quality.  Newman was a Great man, when he was alive the company was better... Since his death they have destroyed their best products by replacing the key organic ingredients w/ non Organic ones.  These cookies used to break apart great, often w/ a circle of chocolate... Now when you break them apart, the chocolate looks like what sticks to rear before wiping.  Nasty taste/texture, its not creamy, broken bits of chocolate.  I got very sick after eating these, causing me many issues trying to do number 2.  I'm considering a refund since I was dumb enough to buy 6 of them... There were no warning or notice that the formula had changed... I had just got them a few months prior so didn't expect anything different.  Please believe there is a huge difference w/ how body handles Organic Chocolate/Coca compared to non organic.  Sadly this is another product the Newman's company has made unconsumable.  It shows that companies do not respect consumer enough to have the main or key ingredients Organic.  For example if you get Organic cinnamon, ginger, cocoa, or chocolate cookies it should be Organic... Not made from Organic Wheat while the named ingredients are non organic unknown chemicals etc.  I'll continue to use their products for my dogs until those are ruined too.  Please realize the positive reviews are for a changed product... You will not receive the 5 star cookies people raved about... Instead there is just the 1 star non Organic Cocoa & Chocolate ones.

Among all the brands that I had before, I have to honestly say that Polar's peach halves is the best canned peach that I have ever had.<br /><br />I was first attracted by both its beautiful color and its elegant glass jar. When you open it, you'll find that it is not smells as sweet as other brand does. But it also proves that there is Definitely No artificial flavor be added.

review/summary: Not a better canned tomato product out there.
review/text: Okay - I should probably qualify this by saying there is no way I have tasted EVERY canned tomato product out there - but I have tasted a lot of them, including many of the DOP certified.<br /><br /> Using San Marzano tomatoes makes a significant difference in any dish I use them in, but especially in the classic tomato sauces.  Rich, sweet, gorgeous color.  Incredible price for ORGANIC San Marzanos - my pantry will never be without a case of these ready to go - with these on hand I can whip up something pretty impressive on the fly.  And I never have to reach for a can of tomato paste to add body or extra tomato umph to sauces - this provides plenty.<br /><br />So yeah - these do not have the official DOP designation - but the flavor is what counts and these have it in abundance.<br /><br />I have not yet had a problem with receiving dented or otherwise damaged cans - this will be my 4th case from Amazon.  Also - gotta admit I love the pull-tab lids - not a reason for buying a specific brand of tomatoes certainly, but it is a nice bonus for this lazy girl.<br /><br />As I will continue to order these as long as they are offered and I am still cooking, I will be sure to update if I receive a damaged case.  Sad to see it has been an issue with some.

review/text: This is my first trial of these tomatoes and as far as I am concerned, they are superior to the chopped tomatoes I have bought from local groceries.  I first learned of these tomatoes from a local Italian restaurant.  They make a superior sauce for hot dogs as well as for pizza.<br /><br />I just made a dish using these in pasta and it was great.  In fact, I like them so much I just ordered them for a friend that lives in another state.<br /><br />Here is a recipe that is very good, USING THESE TOMATOES- WORKED PERFECT-try it!<br /><br />TOMATO PIE RECIPE:<br /><br />You may enrich this recipe by carmealizing the onions first or just use them as is.  To carmealize onions- use a sweet onion as it is the sugar in them that carmealizies.  If no sweet onion, you can add a tsp of brown sugar to the onions to get the same effect.  You chop the onions, add a tlbs. of butter to the skillet, add the onions, and cook 10 min, stirring ever 3 to 4 minutes.  Reduce the heat, and cook another 35 minutes, stirring ever five minutes until they are brown.<br /><br />1. 1  nine inch pie crust.<br />2. Sweet or regular onion-chopped.<br /><br />3.  One can Mangia Carmelina Brand Organic Italian Tomatoes in Puree.<br />4.

Salt and black pepper- amt. yuour choice.<br />9. Mushrooms sliced if desired.<br /><br />Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place the pie shell in the oven and bake 8 minutes.  Cool.<br />Sprinkle a little cheese over the partially baked pie crust (this helps to keep it from getting soggy)<br />Sprinkle the onions over the crust.<br />Add the chopped tomatoes.<br />Sprinkle the basil seasoning over the tomatoes.<br /><br />Combine the cheese with the mayonnaise, hot papper, salt and black pepper-(this will make a soft ball) spread this over the tomatoes and bake 40 minutes.

review/text: I have been using Alber's Yellow Corn Meal for about 40 years.  I have their recipe for cornbread memorized as it is the best, most pure cornbread I have ever eaten. After moving to the south and not being able to find it I began going through a withdrawal.  I tried all different kinds of "corn meal", which, being in the south usually meant more of a "corn FLOUR"!  I was eating cakie, heavy cornbread and couldn't stand it.  It was in desperation that I checked Amazon and found that I could order my very favorite!  Now I have to admit that 4-40 oz boxes is a bit much for 2 old people but I put 2 boxes in the freezer and gave one to my daughter who declared that it made the best cornbread she had ever had also.  (She had forgotten the cornbread of her youth!)  So, if you are looking for the best, most pure and authentic cornbread ever, stop messing around the cheap copies and get the real thing - Albers!

review/text: Plum Organics is a really good product, and this flavor is no exception.  My 8-month old loves, loves, loves the Spinach, Peas & Pear combo...more so than any other brand out there.  She is keen on savory foods and I guess this qualifies because she can't get enough of it!  It is still sweet, but not overwhelming so, and you can really smell the spinach in it, which I think is a good thing.<br /><br />As far as the integrity of the product is concerned, I also give it a 5 star.  After researching "where" the product is made, it has become apparent to me in talking both with Plum Baby Organics and the distributor, Oregon Tilth, that most of the main ingredients are made in the U.S. and not in China.  The bulk of their ingredients come from Emeryville, CA.  The exception would be fruit such as bananas, mangoes and other tropical fruit come from Mexico.  So, until proven otherwise, I will continue purchasing their products gladly and quite satisfied.  I was also quite pleased that I actually spoke with representatives from both companies in a timely manner.  I will gladly support small businesses such as Plum, especially knowing that they are endeavoring to provide a quality product for our children.

review/text: My daughter started out not really digging food.  She warmed up to pears right away and was really particular about what else she liked.  Mostly fruit (mango, pineapple, pear, blueberry) she would eat and peas on their own, forget it!  I was a bit reluctant to try this flavor out seeing as my daughter absolutely refused to eat peas after trying them once.  To my surprise she loved it!  Loved it so much she ate nearly the entire packet in one sitting (unheard of for her).  This is now a regular staple in our rotation and she simply can't get enough.  As a Mom, I'm delighted she is so into veggies, I am happy to spend any amount of money on these little suckers as long as she's happy eating them.<br /><br />Convenient pouches last for days in the fridge once opened.  Easy to take anywhere with us, including traveling.  The spoon attachments are really handy for these, but my little one enjoys eating straight from the bag. Slurp slurp slurp!<br /><br />Messy with the green, so be sure to use a bib.  Otherwise, hands down one of my favorite baby foods on the market.

review/text: We feed all of our large dogs Fromm, and they love it. We tried several brands with them, but Fromm is the only one they seem to enjoy eating. It's a high protein, no grain, no filler food. Of course, these things do make it cost more, but it's worth it to feed our pets food that is actually beneficial to them. I've done tons and tons of research on dog food, with all of the recalls happening I want to be sure that whatever I'm feeding them is safe and healthy. It's the least I can do for them. Fromm hasn't had any recalls in the 5 years I've been feeding it, and my dogs have had zero problems while eating it. It's definitely worth the price to me to have happy, healthy pets. If Fromm is out of your price range, please do research, and find the best food within your budget... your dog will thank you immensely!!!!

review/summary: Quality Food
review/text: This is the food my dogs get exclusively. My little one (got him first) has been on it since soon after I got him because I discovered the truth about dog foods after I got him. I research everything like crazy..almost to a point where I drive myself nuts. I keep coming back to this brand of dog food. I first discovered it at a small local pet store (that does not sell pets of course; (I try not to go to those)). The store recommended we try Fromm because they have been selling it for a long time and think it is a really good food and company. So I gave it a shot (of course I had to research it more on my own). But both of my dogs do very well on it. They are small dogs (13lb and 5lb) so the kibble size is good with all the flavors. They have no problems eating any of the adult dog flavors. I do switch up the flavors for them though because they get sick of the same flavor all the time but I would too. They are healthy and spoiled rotten. In my opinion, it is the best kibble you can buy. They don't care for the canned versions though, so I get a different brand when they get a canned 'treat'. But thankfully, my boys are healthy and happy on this food. I wouldn't want it any other way. Dog foods scare me because I am putting a lot of trust into a company that has the potential to harm my boys who mean the world to me. If I had the time and money, I would make their food myself. But I hope Fromm doesn't change anything. They use quality ingredients and I've never recalled an issue with the food.<br /><br />By the way, I have tried other brands here and there because I am sometimes so indecisive because of my crazy researching and wanting 'the best' but I always come back to Fromm and this last time, I told myself that's it; were sticking with it; Fromm that is). So I'm glad I can get it online because I moved and don't have any pet store that carries decent food like this within an hours driving time. I refuse to get anything else now. So thanks Amazon ;)

review/summary: Interesting shape...
review/text: One of my two dogs really likes this food.  The other one isn't interested.  The shape of the kibble is very interesting and unique, it is a three dimensional pyramid.

review/summary: Delicious Tender Mochi Bites
review/text: I think these are fabulous, especially compared to so many other mochi products I've tried over the years.  These have a very nice, gentle sweetness that is balanced; a tender but not mooshy or soggy bite, and the fillings also have nice flavors and textures.  The overall result is a little snack that is satisfying and appealing.

review/summary: I like it...
review/text: Taste is individual so you either like it or you don't. This mochi is sweet but not too sweet, I like it. I enrolled to Amazon's automatic delivery on this product, so that says a lot. Shipping is free & quick and the product is always fresh, kudos to Amazon. I'm yours for life.

review/summary: They all taste like the peanut mochi
review/text: I got this figuring it was a great price for three different types of mochi.  The problem is that the peanut mochi is so strong it actually overpowered/changed the flavors of the red bean and sesame mochi so they all taste like peanuts. It was still good but I knocked off a few stars since I was expecting three different flavors for what I paid.

review/summary: Tasty but peanut wasn't very good.
review/text: The dough isn't as thick as I'd like but that might be personal preference. Some of the red bean ones had a chunky filling as well.

review/summary: Good for such a big pack!
review/text: It's pretty good with such a giganic pack. The red bean flavor is pretty good. Like it the most!These packages I tried tasted using less sugar than the regular one. I don't know if it's good for all, but I like it less sugar.

review/summary: Good for over 30 years...
review/text: Yes, I've been using Utah red (pink, really) salt for that long, beginning when Walnut Acres carried it.  It's a good addition to your salt repertoire, enhances many many flavors.  I couldn't cook without it!

review/summary: great salt!
review/text: I bought this product for my partner who is a professional chef. We love this product-never ceases to amaze that so many flavors can be brought forward with the many varieties of salt on the market today. Utah Jurassic salt is a 'sweet' salt and your culinary uses are only limited by your imagination. I recommend this product and hope you enjoy the adventure.

review/summary: love the taste!
review/text: I have chronic high blood pressure and my naturopathic dr recommended this salt to help my sleepy thyroid and overall health.  Because it has iodine it helps my thyroid.  Because the salt is natural with no added anti-caking ingredients it will not have ill effects on my body or BP.  This is the best tasting salt i've ever had!  Somewhat sweet.

review/text: Rich and smooth olive oil without the bitter after-taste common in other brands.  This oil is so good one can take a spoonful for a pleasant and mouth cleansing experience.

review/text: Wow! These are amazing. I admit, I was a little worried about how they would get to my house unmelted, but they were packed in dry ice so they were still good. Definitely a product worth ordering.

review/summary: Great stuff!
review/text: Salty, malty and tasty. Not for sissies. A little goes a long way and is a tasteful departure from jam or marmalade. About a jar-a-year should do for a party of two.
