review/summary: Yea, not so much.
review/text: This is the first canned coffee I've tried. I found it to be a major disappointment. It was very bitter. I know other reviewers have said it was sweet. I certainly could not taste any sweetness at all. There was a definite metallic edge that I did not enjoy. We poured it into several glasses and had a panel of judges try it, all of whom love their coffee. Not one person finished it. "Ick!" was the overwhelming response.

review/summary: Bitter - Not Sweet and It Has 10 grams of Sugar
review/text: The ingredients in this product are: coffee, sugar, potassium bicarbonate and potassium citrate. It has 10 grams of sugar. Note this does not have a dairy product ingredient in it.<br /><br />This is a thin consistency drink with a bold bitter coffee taste. I detect no sweetness at all, although it has 10 grams of sugar.<br /><br />I like the taste of bold coffee with french roast or cofee and chickory New Orleans style or Vietnamese style coffee drinks. This was bold and strong but a thin consistency and bitter despite the sugar added.<br /><br />This drink did nothing for me. I prefer a real cup of hot coffee with half and half to give it a creamy consistency, or I like a strong coffee iced coffee drink or I like an espresso based coffee drink or a frozen Frappuccino type of drink. I love strong coffee that's bold. I usually only use one sugar in a large coffee so I don't like it super-sweet by any means. This is just bitter and I rate it 2 stars = I Don't Like It.<br /><br />There are other iced canned or iced bottled prepared coffee drinks, milk or no milk products that I prefer the taste of such as the ones made by Starbucks (i.e. glass bottled Frappuccino) or the little aluminum cans of espresso drinks such as Starbucks DoubleShot.

review/summary: Convenience = 5 stars, Taste = 2 stars
review/text: The world changed for the me the first time I tried a bottle of Starbucks Mocha Frappucino about 10 years ago. The product tasted better than the one you get in store, and the convenience of being able to grab a bottle of a Frappucino and take it to the office was great. Illy's Issimo Caff&egrave; "Coffee Drink" comes in a sharp-looking six-ounce can, so there's no disputing the convenience of the product. However, the taste was another matter - flat, bland, and underwhelming. In fact, if I had to rate the flavor of all the packaged coffee drinks I've tried over the years, this would be close to the bottom of the list. Perhaps their other drinks pack more of a flavor punch, but Issimo Caff&egrave; Coffee Drink was a disappointment.

review/summary: Potent but the taste is not for me
review/text: This is an extremely strong blended drink.  It is bitter and strong.  I only had one can to experiment with so my views are limited.  I opened the can while it was room temperature and took a sip. This was not a pleasant experience.  I then poured some over ice and it did taste much better.  It was not until I cut the rest of the can with some vanilla flavored soy milk and ice that it tasted "good" to me.  On the up side, this small can gave me much fuel for studying for several hours.<br /><br />Final impression:  I would not buy this on a regular basis but would consider using it for a long study session.  Not a terrible product but not for me.

review/text: I tried this in sips to start after pouring it from the can and being surprised by the dark color.  It's a proper espresso but it's sweet and a bit bitter at the same time because it's basically just espresso and sugar for some sweetness.  I have to say it is not my favorite but I was able to drink it.  Not sure I'll be switching from my regular choice which has cream added, but to try this was not bad.  Probably ideal for people other than me who like their coffee strong and black with a hint of sweet since the flavors are definitely bold.

review/summary: Bitter, but drinkable
review/text: I've a few people refer to this as being strong, but it's not really particularly strong, just bitter. It also seemed to get more bitter as I got to the end of the can. Bitter does not mean strong, it just means it was made from cheap beans and brewed at too high heat. I thought it was drinkable, but it didn't taste like good coffee. It is sweetened, but not enough to counter the bitterness. The can says not to shake, so I was expecting it to have a bit of fizz, but it doesn't. Overall, it is good in a pinch, but I wouldn't want to have it very often.

review/summary: Very good
review/text: If your idea of a cold, bottled coffee drink is something on the order of a Starbuck's Frappucino, you're going to be disappointed with the illy issimo coffee drink.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of the Starbuck's frap, but you don't have to read the ingredients list to realize that both sugar and milk probably come before coffee.  Although the illy issimo contains a touch of sugar, it leaves you with no doubt that the main ingredient is coffee: strong, espresso-type coffee.<br /><br />I enjoyed the illy issimo caff&eacute;, and if you're a veteran coffee drinker who likes espresso, you'll probably like it, too.  No, it doesn't compare to freshly brewed espresso, but what does?  I drank this cold, straight up, but it has enough flavor to hold its own over ice, too.  The small can is reminiscent of the small size of espresso cups.  I don't buy ready-made coffee drinks very often, partly because I own the Mr. Coffee Frappe Maker (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FWMF8G">Mr. Coffee BVMC-FM1 20-Ounce Frappe Maker</a>) and can whip up a fresh coffee drink quickly and easily, but when I'm out and about, the illy issimo caff&eacute; will be high on my list of choices.

review/summary: Not bad as a pick me up
review/text: I am a routine coffee drinker (Starbucks) but not a connoisseur by any measure. I also understand everyone's taste is different so keep that in mind as you read this review.<br /><br />This product has a very strong taste so much so that I was somewhat surprised. The packaging indicates it is made with 100% Arabica coffee and only natural ingredients at 45 calories.  I found it very a little creamy, strong, dark, lightly sweet, with a strong kick.  Some may want to add sweetener to it in an effort to balance the flavor. I personally found the coffee tastes much better over ice with added sweetener. I suspect coffee connoisseur's will appreciate the taste more than I do however. It's distinct advantage is that it is ready made and easily pack-able.<br /><br />Ultimately, I will not be buying this product because it does not suit me personally.

review/summary: Meh, not very good.
review/text: For reference, my "morning coffee" is a doubleshot of espresso, hot and very lightly sweetened with brown sugar in the winter, unsweetened over ice in the summer.<br /><br />This morning, I had this, first on its own (ick), and then over ice (slightly better). There is no part of me that's tempted to replace my morning routing with a can of this, easy as it might be.<br /><br />Really, it wasn't horrible. It tasted an awful lot like the other big brand's version of this, which, unfortunately (and I know this sounds horrible), tastes to me like, well, like coffee smells when it's exiting the body. Maybe this is just me, but it's something of a turn-off, and is true for both that other brand and for this one.<br /><br />I didn't really enjoy the texture of this drink, either -- kind of syrupy and thick, when it seems like without cream it should be pretty watery. It was also waaaay sweeter than I would ever want my coffee to be, but given that I generally prefer an unsweetened cold coffee, I'm not sure how much stock you want to put in that.<br /><br />Overall, if you like that other brand's version of this product, I don't see why you wouldn't like this, but if you're hoping for something better -- I don't think this is it.

Illy's offering is pretty good if one like coffee that isn't drenched in cream and sugar. I can't say the flavor is my favorite, but it is good enough for occasional drinking. I wouldn't consider this an energy drink. If you like strong coffee flavor and don't mind the price tag, then you should enjoy this beverage.

review/summary: Low calorie quick shot of espresso and caffeine - bitter and strong - you may like it
review/text: If you like your coffee strong and bitter, this may be the product for you.  In this little 6.8 ounce can, you get 50 calories of espresso with a bit of sugar and 155 mg of caffeine.  After drinking the relatively mild <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cappucino, 8.45-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> which I also got from Amazon Vine, I was expecting this drink to be similarly weak.  I was quite surprised to find it to be thick, dark, and quick flavorful.  Make sure it's ice cold and it will be good.  If you do not like straight espresso and prefer heavily sweetened ice-coffee drinks, this is not the can for you.  There is no apparent milk or creamer - it is straight espresso with sugar and some preservatives.  In that spirit, if you like cold espresso, you will like this drink.

It's not exceptional, but tastes fine.

review/summary: Not Too Weak, But Not Super Strong.  Best Cold.
review/text: This coffee drink is a chilled espresso, so one's expectation should be that it is espresso strength.  I'd rate it as equivalent to a single shot of espresso.  It provides a nice little jolt and tastes the way I think chilled espresso should taste.<br /><br />For the most part, Illy Caffe hits the mark in the canned coffee category.  Coca Cola, the manufacturer, added sugar to the drink, so that may put some people off.  For me, while the sugar was discernible, I did not find that it made the drink overly sweet.<br /><br />50 calories, not 45 as the Amazon ad states.  I prefer to drink Illy Caffe ice cold.

review/summary: Very good canned coffee. Just don't shake it!
review/text: I'm not a big fan of canned coffee, but this issimo expresso is one I can stand behind. It provides a nice double shot of caffeine at only 50 calories per can. Served chilled, it is pleasantly sweet and definitely tastes and smells more like fresh brewed iced coffee than many others I've tried over the years. It is smooth and tasty, though I like my coffee to have a deeper flavor. I wouldn't say it's exactly "bold and full-bodied". This product was developed for the US market and Americans tend to like their coffees weak and milky (Duncan Donuts, caff&egrave; Americano), but it is a lot better than other canned/bottled coffees on the market. The sweetness level is just right for me.<br /><br />I would definitely order this again and keep in my office fridge for that mid-afternoon boost when the 2pm slump hits. It's more convenient than making my own and refrigerating. Strangely, there's 1g of fiber in here (4% USRDA) and the can says "Do not shake". I drank it straight from the can and did not detect any metal taste.<br /><br />Italian-styled Arabica coffee, product of Denmark, distributed by Coca-Cola of Atlanta, GA. All hail internationalization!

review/summary: Delicious and Bold, without the frills.
review/text: I am currently drinking one, as I write this review. It has a nice and clean flavor, without sacrificing robustness (as many coffee drinks will do). It doesn't have gobs of cream or tons of sugar, and that allows the flavor of the coffee itself to go front and center. The fact that these have been around for a while, and that it is still on the market should tell you something: the coffee itself is good enough to stand on its own, without all the other stuff that is in most of the other coffee drinks.  Bear in mind, that I am comparing this to other prepared and canned/bottled coffee drinks; nothing out of a can will compare to a freshly brewed cup of coffee of quality beans.<br /><br />Be sure to heed the warning on the can, as shaking these up can cause them to go everywhere.<br /><br />I drink caffeinated beverages on a daily basis, and this is still giving me a nice little boost of energy. :)

It is well packaged and for those who want to take their cans when they travel, this packs well and maintains the freshness of the contents.  The coffee hounds laud this for its energy boosting properties.<br /><br />This brand has only 100 calories and very little fat, which is far better than you will find if you purchase gourmet coffee.  You can also buy this in a 8.45 oz can.

review/summary: Strong and flavorful, but too sweet for me.
review/text: If you're a fan of iced or room temperature coffee, you'll probably enjoy this quite a bit.  It's a very rich and flavorful drink that would take ice and still taste well.  Personally, I found it to be a bit sweet, but I usually take my coffee without sugar.<br /><br />At $3 a can, it's a pricey drink for everyday consumption.  But I can see how it would be nice to have these around for a barbecue or other special occasions.  They're so strong that one can could probably mix into at least 2 blended beverages.<br /><br />For me, I think it's a good product, but I could never consume these on a regular basis.

review/summary: Illy Issimo Coffee Drink
review/text: I got this because I am a huge coffee fan and am always looking for a summer drink that is cool instead of hot. I chilled the can and got myself a glass of ice. I popped the top and poured, none of that cream color for me.... I like my coffee straight. That is ALMOST what I got, they made it just a little sweet, no cream, but some sweet. I tell you, I would rather have cream than sweetener any day of the week. So, this drink did not do it for me, cold black coffee tastes better!

review/summary: I love coffee-but a bit too strong cold
review/text: This is a great product for those that enjoy iced coffee, and strong. I prefer strong coffee with milk, so this one was a bit strong for me. This one is definitely a power shot for if you're on the go and looking for a jolt. It has a very rich flavor, but was a bit strong for my taste. I think I would enjoy a selection that had milk and perhaps, flavored, with this kind of strength. Not for me, but definitely a rich, bold flavor.

review/summary: Not entirely sold on the bitter flavor
review/text: A hot cup of coffee (preferably with creamer or foamed milk) is my preferred way to start the day, but I thought I'd try out one of the cold coffee drinks just to see what I'd been missing. The product description uses the phrase "Full-bodied," which is definitely an understatement; despite the high sugar content, a can of illy issimo's Caffe has an extremely bitter flavor that's almost biting.<br /><br />The first sip almost stopped me cold in my tracks because it was rather unpleasant at first, but like coffee in general, it takes a little while to start to really appreciate the flavor. There's a bit of a sweet aftertaste from the sugar, and the coffee itself will appeal to anyone who likes a darker roast. On the energy front, you will get a serious caffeine jolt just from one can.<br /><br />I still prefer a cup of hot coffee with creamer, but this isn't a bad on-the-go choice for anyone who likes a darker, more bitter flavor and doesn't mind iced versions of coffee.

review/summary: Inconsistent. First one was watery, second was stronger.
review/text: I had two of these to try. My first impression was that this was kind of small, compared to Starbucks bottled drinks and other popular coffee drinks at the store for around the same price.<br /><br />As for taste, the first one....it doesn't taste bad, but to me it doesn't taste good either. Meaning, at first blush/taste it comes across as water with some espresso in it, not the other way around. I had it cold, so perhaps it's a bit stronger if served at room temperature. Truly, it tastes like they filled the can with water, almost to the top. Then dropped in a splash of espresso. That give it the very slight bitter taste, which is more in the aftertaste really.<br /><br />The second can was what the manufacturer was probably going for.  A stronger espresso flavor. Good, kind of bold, espresso-ish. I'd say the second can was not only much better, but worth buying again.<br /><br />Just a heads-up for folks, this is in no way creamy, it's truly an espresso drink..not a latte etc.<br /><br />It contains 6.8 ounces in this wee can. So,  that 1 cup measuring cup in your kitchen? It would not even fill that, which is 8 ounces.  This is barely a juice box. If it tasted like a real SHOT of espresso, the small size would be more than exciting, even a little endearing.<br /><br />On the good side, I love the idea of coffee to go. If the flavor was much more consistent I'd buy these when I didn't want a creamy, cold drink.<br /><br />Sheri Gill - author

review/summary: Good coffee drink for when you are on the go
review/text: This is a canned espresso drink.  So, it does not have any milk or cream, but it does have sugar.<br /><br />I don't normally take sugar or sweetener in my coffee, so this product was a little on the sweet side for my taste.  However, for someone who does sweeten their coffee, this would probably be just right.<br /><br />The can did not list any serving suggestions.  So, as and experiment, I tried some cold and some heated in the microwave.  I definitely preferred this drink cold.  In my opinion, heating the product seemed to lessen the flavor.<br /><br />All in all I liked this product.  But, given a choice, I would rather have freshly made espresso.  That being said, I would buy this drink again for convenience, perhaps when travelling.

review/summary: Good coffee taste, but too sweet for me.
review/text: This little can was definitely full of energy! It had that thick, bold espresso taste to it, which I find essential to the enjoyment. But alas, like every other pre-packaged drink these days, it was far too sugary. I am one to put a quarter teaspoon of raw sugar in my little 1.75 oz espresso. This drink, while not frappaccino levels, was just too much for me. I was able to finish it though. I have been told it is best to enjoy these drinks cold, but I drank mine at room temp, and it was just fine. Perhaps if it were cold, I would have liked the sweetness a bit more? The size was good too; not a whole big drink, but not one of those piddling little five-hour energies either.

review/summary: Not for casual coffee drinkers
review/text: Perhaps it's just something about the area I live in, but our convenience stores sell many brands of coffee "shot" drinks and all of them have some sort of cream in them to cut the bitter taste of pure espresso. That being said, I was unpleasantly surprised when I took a sip of illy issimo Caffe. It was pure, undiluted cold coffee. And unlike some other reviewers, I couldn't taste the sweetener at all.<br /><br />This is the first quickie cold coffee drink that I haven't completely enjoyed. I just couldn't drink it, but my reasons for disliking it are probably the exact reasons black coffee and straight espresso drinkers will love it. Those who like their iced coffees light and sweet and their Frappuchinos heavy on the extras should steer clear of illy issimo Caffe.

review/summary: Basically An Expensive Cup Of Bitter Coffee
review/text: Apparently illy issimo is a well-known brand of coffee in Italy.  I don't know if they had a hard time turning their product into a canned drink, but color me unimpressed by illy.  I chilled the product because I felt that it would be better than drinking it lukewarm.  I don't think it would have mattered as all I tasted was a cold cup of your standard cheap grocery store brand coffee.  Even my wife who drinks much more coffee than I disliked it.  It wasn't that it had a rich, strong capuccino taste which I actually like - the coffee tasted bitter, had a strange after taste, and would have needed ALOT of sweetener for it to be even marginally palatable.  I drank about half of the can and then had to pour the rest out (and drink a big glass of water to wash the taste out of my mouth).  An overall unpleasant experience...

review/text: This drink has the rich taste of Illy coffee slightly sweetened with sugar. When I saw that it was pre-sweetened I expected that it might be overly sweet, but that isn't the case; the taste of the coffee comes through strongly. I would prefer to make a cup of Illy and pour it over ice, but the canned version is a convenient alternative. I would have rated it higher, but I found that it left a distinct aftertaste, not the pleasant aftertaste from a strong coffee, but more of a metallic taste from the can. I prefer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">illy issimo Cappuccino Coffee Drink, 8.45-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>.

review/text: I don't use sugar in my coffee or tea and this product has sugar in it. It is way too sugary for me but otherwise had a pleasant coffee taste, not bitter and very smooth to drink. This is an espresso based product so it will be high in caffeine.<br /><br />If you are not used to strong coffee flavors then this might overpower you but if you are used to espresso or very strong coffees, then you might like the flavor of this coffee drink. It is rich tasting but not overpowering. But if you are like me and do not like sugar, then you will be disappointed with the sweetness of this coffee drink.<br />If you use sugar in your coffee and also like strong coffee flavors then you might like this product. I think though that it would have been really good without the sugar.

review/text: If you're in a situation where you wanted to bring coffee with you, but were somehow prevented from bringing a thermos or Starbucks cup, I suppose you could do worse than this canned coffee. That's basically all it is: lightly sweetened canned coffee. The can is small enough to fit in a bag or purse, and there's just enough here for "one cup of coffee," as it were. It's meant to be drank cold, but for me coffee drinks are better served hot unless they've got lots of flavor and sugar in them. This one is just canned coffee, and it's good enough as that, but not much more.

review/text: I liked the taste. The coffee taste was right there ready to be enjoyed-- not strong, not weak. It wasn't real sweet. But there is a lot of caffeine in it: 155 mg in just 6.8 ounces. Also, the ingredients say it uses sugar for sweetner and potassium citrate, some people may be looking for those for their mass produced beverages as opposed to more commonly used ingredients. Further research on your own might be interesting.<br /><br />I'll have to think about that much caffeine before getting any more. Otherwise, I liked it.

But then I limit my caffeine intake normally. But under normal circumstances you are not going to catch me spending $1.65 or more per can of this drink. I got better things to do with my money, and it must be a sign of how affluent a country the USA is, even in these supposedly hard times, that people buy products such as this or delivered pizza with enough frequency to keep the companies supplying them afloat. We ought to be paying off our national debt, that burden we show every sign of irresponsibly passing on to our kids and grandkids, instead of buying these luxury products.

review/summary: Lives Up to illy's Standard
review/text: I'm a big ice coffee drinker but I usually prefer to either make it myself or purchase it from a coffee shop where I know it's at least been made on the premise. Freshness is generally something that you can recognize when it comes to coffee. That's why I avoid drinks like those Starbucks Double Shot cans. They taste generic and fake.<br /><br />I usually use a Tassimo pod based brewer to get my caffeine fix but I've made coffee using illy beans before. It really is great coffee. As far as coffee drinks go, it's pretty hard to beat the illy issimo coffee drink. It actually tastes like coffee and isn't drowned out by preservatives or whatever other junk they put into canned coffee.<br /><br />I tend to take my coffee with as little milk as possible. I found that the milk level in this drink was fine, something that I usually take umbrage with when it comes to canned coffee. I suppose you could add more milk if you really wanted to, but I wouldn't bother.<br /><br />The price for a pack of twelve of these is a bit steep for coffee, but I guess it makes sense considering what the other canned coffees cost. If canned coffee is your thing, certainly go for the illy coffee drink. It really does taste quite good.

review/summary: Well made, not too sweet
review/text: This little can of "Americano" (espresso with a little water) tastes like it just came out of an espresso bar -- great smoothness, no bitterness, balanced flavor. There's a little sweetener to balance the bitterness, and it tastes great poured over ice with a little creamer for a refreshing summer drink.

review/summary: Nice Coffee for On-the-Go
review/text: I am a confirmed black coffee drinker -- or so I thought, but the light sugar in this canned coffee is just the thing for drinking in the car.  I hadn't realized that it would be pre-sugared, but it is quite nice. No bitter taste, no tinned taste either, so I'm a happy camper and will be buying this to take with me on road trips.<br /><br />Thanks, Illy Issimo!

review/summary: Delicious caffeine booster
review/text: illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave;, 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)<br /><br />First Rule of illy coffee is DO NOT SHAKE! Second rule is see first rule. OK. So I did shake then I realized what I did and put it back in the fridge for later. Later, arrives/ I open the can and there is no spray or other problems. It's not carbonated but I've heard of people having issues after shaking the can.<br /><br />The color of the beverage is a deep dark coffee brown as one should expect. See my photo that I've uploaded.  The taste is rich and deep, lots of strong coffee taste. There is sugar, 10 grams and 50 calories, so there is a good amount of sweetness too.  All in all a really nice coffee drink, for one that is in a can. It's made in Denmark for the Coca Cola Company. It's a really nice way to get that caffeine boost.

review/summary: Strong, smooth tasting coffee
review/text: The color is deep brown; almost black as it should be with  espresso-type coffee. It taste like a good cup of strong coffee and not as acidic or bitter as I expect espresso to taste.  The flavor is very smooth.  Each 6.8 ounce serving is 50 calories. There are only four ingredients - coffee, sugar, potassium bicarbonate, and potassium citrate. Each serving has 155 mg of caffeine which is about the same as is in a cup of drip coffee (115 - 175 mg).<br /><br />My boyfriend really loved this drink (he shared it with me) and would rate it 5 stars because it has a strong flavor and a good caffeine content; although he does consider this expensive.

review/summary: A pleasant surprise, taste-wise and buzz-wise
review/text: Some reviews of this coffee drink led me to expect a beverage I'd want to sweeten, given that I never drink and can't stand unsweetened coffee and espresso (hot or cold). But while illy issimo caffe isn't sweet sweet, it does contain sugar (which I assume accounts for the fact that each can contains 50 calories), and I find it quite palatable as is straight from the can. I find that the beverage's bitterness is offset by the sugar content.  And strong, in that I began to feel a caffeine buzz within minutes after drinking less than 1/3 of the can (on an empty stomach), and after finishing the can I felt a significant caffeine buzz comparable to what I feel after drinking an 8 ounce can of Red Bull. But I would say that the buzz I got from the illy was smoother than what I typically experience on the relatively rare occasions (usually during long drives) when I partake of Red Bull, in the sense that the illy gave me a buzz without any jittery feeling, and I did not experience the kind of "come down" that I have experienced after drinking Red Bull.<br /><br />It says, "VERY LOW SODIUM" on the illy caffe label (20mg per can), and that's good for those of us who watch our sodium intake.<br /><br />illy issimo caffe is a product of Denmark and is produced for and distributed by the Coca-Cola Company. Each 6.8 ounce can contains 155mg of caffeine, nearly double the 80mg of caffeine found in each 8.5 ounce can of Red Bull. At the Coffee Chemistry dot com page titled, "Caffeine content in espresso vs drip coffee" we are told that, "According to the National Coffee Association (NCA) a typical cup of drip coffee (8oz) contains approximately 65-120 mg of caffeine." A 12 ounce can of Coca Cola has less than 40mg of caffeine, so the bottom line is that there is a lot of caffeine in each 6.8 ounce can of illy issimo caffe compared to what we find in other commonly consumed caffeinated beverages. A shot of espresso has 30-50mg of caffeine, so to get the amount of caffeine in a can of illy issimo caffe one would have to drink about 3-5 shots of regular espresso.<br /><br />If you're in the market for a strong coffee/espresso beverage in a can that's meant to be drunk cold and that can give you a good caffeine pick-up, give illy issimo caffe a try.

review/summary: Strong coffee flavor without too much sugar.
review/text: The Illy Issimo Caffe is an Italian espresso style cold coffee drink.  Nutrition stats are as follows per 6.8 oz can:<br /><br />50 calories<br />1 g of fiber<br />10 g of sugar<br />155 mg of caffeine<br /><br />I love cold coffee so was looking forward to trying this drink.  One thing I like is that it is not too sweet.  A lot of these bottled coffee drinks taste too much like chocolate milk.  This drink is tasty because the sugar flavor is not overpowering, and the strong coffee flavor sticks out.  While it is not comparable to a cold coffee you would get fresh from a coffee shop, it does well in a pinch.  Overall I would give it 3.5 stars.

review/text: I'm an avid coffee drinker. I like it hot, iced and on certain days, room temperature. I also like it black with cream on occasion and sweetened slightly. I could not have imagined how great illy issimo Caffe Coffee Drink would taste. I poured half for my assistant and myself and after drinking it, we both agreed that this coffee tasted bold without being overwhelming and pleasantly sweet. Clean brisk and refreshing.<br /><br />Each can contains 6.8 fluid ounces and can go just about anywhere you want to take it this summer, on the go, to work, on vacation, or even camping. I recommend this to anyone who drinks coffee and enjoys it sweet and black.

review/text: I tried half the can over ice, the other half, hot. Not as strong as a true espresso, especially after the ice starts melting. Also not as strong as a real espresso heated with no ice. When heated, the coffee became bitter and metallic-tasting. Not worth spending 50 calories and 12 carbs (10 grams sugar) over a bad-tasting coffee drink. I couldn't finish this, I tossed it down the drain. If I'm drinking coffee away from home, I'd rather have a non-fat McCafe Mocha from McDonalds.

review/summary: Bad Tasting Caffeine Boost
review/text: I enjoy trying new drinks, and I also like coffee and espresso drinks.  So I was curious about the Caffe coffee drink from Illy Issimo.  However, I was a little disappointed in the result.  The taste started sweet, transitioned to citrus, and finished bitter.  I found that the added sugar masked any potential nuance from the coffee without providing any real desirable flavor of its own.  While not necessarily bad, the Caffe (6.8 oz, 50 calories, 155 mg caffeine) does not compare favorably with a tall Starbucks Iced Coffee (12 oz, 60 calories, 120 mg caffeine).  If you are looking for a compact shot of caffeine, this might be what you want.  However, don't expect much in the taste department.  I am hoping that the Cappuccino fares better.

review/text: This coffee is very bitter with a strong bold taste. Heating it up (if you like your drink warm) makes it more bitter.<br /><br />It has a strong coffee aroma, and its not too sweet. I could only take a couple of sips of it, and this 1 can lasted me 2-3 days because I wasn't enamored with the flavor. If you like tasty coffee, illy Cappuccino is a lot better. I felt this product has more of a caffeine punch that the Starbucks double shot cans.<br /><br />I didn't find anything special with this drink (and to be perfectly honest, it made me kind of nauseous on a empty stomach). It also increase my acid reflux just a bit. Will not be ordering in the future.

review/text: Illy is a top coffee brand in Italy, so I was very interested in trying their pre-packaged espresso. This drink is also pre-sweetened. It was quite a disappointment to take a sip and find that there was absolutely no flavor of coffee at all. And espresso's supposed to be pretty strong. The only taste was that of the sweetener, of which there was far too much. I'll continue to make expresso at home, grinding the beans and using my little stove top pot.

That being said she does love the starbucks drinks you can buy and this was not on-par with the taste of those according to her. I believe if she wants canned coffee in the future we'll be staying away from this brand.

review/summary: NASTY! Tastes like 2 day old burnt coffee.
review/text: This is some really nasty tasting stuff. I just tried this one "illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cappucino, 8.45-Ounce Cans" before trying this one. Of the two, this is definitely the worst. But saying the other one was better isn't really saying much because it was really nasty tasting too.<br /><br />  The closest thing I can compare the flavor of this to is a pot of coffee that was left cooking on a hot plate till there was only a cup left in the pot. Then sat for 2 days. It has a nasty burnt coffee flavor with a strong metallic twang to it like it has boiled for hours in a aluminum sauce pan. It left a bitter burnt after taste stuck in the back of my throat and a foul metallic yuck coating my tongue. And neither one wants to go away. It might supposed to have a espresso flavor and I'm not real sure what that is since I haven't had one in several years. But, if real espresso taste's like this stuff, then espresso certainly wouldn't be as popular as it is. Except as a tar remover or something like that.<br /> On the can it says "DO NOT SHAKE" and that made me wonder why? After trying to drink it I'd have to say its probably because it still has a bunch of coffee grounds settled in the bottom of it. And if I shook it up then I would have the chew it instead of drink it. I thought about cutting the top off of the can and see what's in it, but decided that I really didn't want to know. I used to call bad strong coffee battery acid, I think this could actually be used for that.<br /><br />The only plus I could say about this is,,,mmmm. There's only 6.8 oz. of it to drink!

It has a smooth, slightly bitter coffee flavor with a little sweetness -- not quite as bitter as brewed espresso, but it's definitely a coffee drink first and an energy drink second.<br /><br />I'm a black coffee drinker by nature and liked it quite a bit.  The flavors were well balanced and complex, but if you like your coffee with a lot of sugar or with cream, then this probably is the wrong drink for you.  On the other hand, if you like the flavor of good black coffee with a hint of sweet, then I recommend giving it a try.

review/text: -------------------------------------------------------<br />Illy Issimo Coffee Drink,<br />Caffe, 6.8-Ounce Can<br />-------------------------------------------------------<br />As noted elsewhere, I'm a fan of Illy coffee, an Italian brand best known for their vacuum-sealed whole bean and ground coffee varieties. I try to keep a can or two around in case civilization breaks down and I either want a little morning jolt before the vampires attack, or if need something to trade with the survivalists and atomic mutants.<br /><br />This aluminum-clad product is a pre-made, sweetened coffee drink -- unlike the similar Illy capuccino drink, this one does not contain milk, just coffee, some sugar and a few chemicals. It has a pretty basic taste - a little metallic, actually, with the combination of the can and the white sugar. I liked their other flavor better; this one seemed uninspired, although I suppose if I had added cream, it might have perked up a bit. Guess I'll stick to their brew-it-yourself beans instead. (Side note: Kind of weird that the drink is licensed to (or owned by) Coca-Cola, from Italy, and manufactured in Denmark. But hey, that's globalism in action!)

review/text: This illy coffee drink tastes like a somewhat sweetened European roast coffee.  It isn't bad for flavor.  However, the company mixes in some ingredients that apparently are supposed to give the drink a smooth consistency.  These leave me with an odd mouthfeel and aftertaste that I never get from drinking coffee.  That detracts significantly from the experience.  I can't see spending this much on these drinks in light of that odd texture/consistency and aftertaste.  For the price, stick with real coffee or espresso.

It tasted very bitter to me, and I could not detect any sweetness, even though the information on the can stated that it contained sugar. I am not sure why the instructions say not to shake the can before opening, but I decided for once to follow instructions...just in case, you know. My guess is that this product is popular among those who already enjoy espresso rather than just accept a cup when it is pressed upon them. One can drink it at room temperature or cold -- I drank my half a can at room temperature before disposing of it,  but upon reflection I probably should have chilled the rest to see if that improved the flavor.

I like the taste of this espresso flavored drink for the most part but it has a slightly artificial taste to it. Each 6.8 fluid ounce can has 50 calories. They display it on the can in a way that leads you to believe that should be good but straight espresso doesn't have any calories so 50 calories worth of sweetener seems like a lot to me. The size of the can is quite small as well. For the cost of this product I would think that they could be a little more generous with the size of the drink. It's nice and convenient while on the go and I like the energy boost from the caffeine.

I guess the reason for 3 stars is that I just overall didnt care for the flavor. This particular flavor is geared more toward the hard core coffee drinker, so if thats you, then you should try it.

review/text: This is my second "coffee-in-a-can" from illy issimo - my first being the much sweeter <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">Cappuccino</a>.<br /><br />I should preface my review by first saying that I am not a coffee drinker - I usually like my coffee in a dessert setting; being nice and sweet and creamy. I knew enough about coffees to know that the espresso would be the darker, more robust and more bitter of the two drinks, but wow - what a punch. I have been on a beer kick lately and many of the darker stout beers say that they have a strong "coffee flavor" which I never understood because I was expecting "coffee" as in the flavor I associate with something like coffee iced cream. After drinking this espresso drink, I now understand the flavor they talk about - and oddly enough, the first thought that came to my mind when I drank this was, "Wow, this tastes like a beer." (not in the boozy sense, mind you - just the bitter bite and flavor overtones).<br /><br />There is a twinge of sweetness to the drink, but nothing that I would consider having a major impact. The bitterness is pretty impressive considering that this small can has 10g of sugar - to put that into perspective, it has about half the sugar of a normal Coke.<br /><br />Now... the caffeine part.<br /><br />I don't really get much caffeine any more - I used to drink tons when I was a kid - going through multiple six-packs of Coke in a week. Nowadays the only caffeine I get is from iced tea at a restaurant (unsweet). So maybe it's because my tolerance is now a bit lower than it used to be, but this thing kicks like a mule. I drank the espresso about three hours after eating lunch, and I would say that I felt the impact within ten minutes of finishing off the can. It stuck with me for about an hour too. Oddly enough, the cappuccino version of this drink took a few hours for me to feel the caffeine high. I checked out the can and found out why... pregnant women and people with heart issues should probably stay very far away from this drink.<br /><br />Here are some basic caffeine stats from the Mayo Clinic:<br />Drink  Size  Caffeine<br />5-Hour Energy  2 oz. (60 mL)  207 mg<br />Red Bull  8.4 oz (250 mL)  76-80 mg<br />Coca-Cola Classic  12 oz. (355 mL)  30-35 mg<br />Mountain Dew  12 oz. (355 mL)  46-55 mg<br /><br />This little can is 6.8 fl oz (200mL) and contains 155 mg of caffeine.<br /><br />If you're a big coffee drinker who takes a lot of their coffee strong and black, these numbers won't come as much of a shock to you since it's pretty much in line with normal brewed coffee. However, if you're no longer a caffeine junkie, don't be surprised if you suddenly feel the need to run a marathon.<br /><br />My final verdict is that I like this stuff, although in the future I'd probably tend to stick more with the sweeter Mochas and Cappuccinos. If you're not a fan of the bitter coffees, I can't say I'd recommend this drink for you, but I didn't find the flavor as off-putting as many other reviewers seem to have.

review/summary: Very Good Coffee From A Can
review/text: I'm not much of a cold coffee drinker, but I took a sip from this and though it was surprisingly strong and not too sweet. Very good, much better than I was expecting.<br /><br />My wife really wanted the rest - she loves iced coffee. She poured it over ice and filled the glass with milk and loved it. Sweetness was perfect, major caffeine boost, and just as good as what you can get from a coffee shop where they charge triple for the same size drink. If you are looking for an alternative to an energy drink or a quick coffee drink in the morning, pick these up. Recommended.

review/summary: Good Taste, Bit Pricey
review/text: I've tried this one and also the illy cappachino mocha version (which is a slightly larger can).  I thought the mocha version seemed to mask the taste of the illy coffee and make it a bit generic.  However this one seemed to be be much closer to espresso taste.  Quite strong (albeit not bitter) espresso taste, which prevents you from chugging the small 6.8oz can, and instead savoring it in smaller sips.<br /><br />Overall I think these are quite a bit of money for what you get, but the cans are small, they taste good, and much cheaper/better than the equivalent starbucks version.

review/summary: Very strong, very small.
review/text: Quick review:<br /><br />Size: Tiny, but you probably wouldn't want much bigger.<br />Flavor: Good, if you like strong coffee.<br />Effect: ZING! Yeah, that's some caffeine there.<br />Value: Passable, though I still prefer the less-strong, larger, cheaper stuff.<br /><br />Final verdict: A good coffee drink, but not one I'd want every day. Very strong. Good for a pick-me-up. I can't complain, except that I might like 8 ounces instead of a mere 6.8 ounces for the price.<br /><br />All in all: Not bad. I'd buy it again.

review/summary: It's ok but it's on the bitter side.
review/text: I split this can with my work associates to get a more balanced view.  A dark coffee fan, a sweetened coffee fan and myself (Somewhere in the middle). All of us agree.  This is a very bitter coffee flavor.<br /><br />The sweetened coffee fan really didn't like this so if you are the type that puts sugar in your coffee - this is probably not the flavor for you.  The dark coffee fan and I enjoyed it more, but we agreed that the dark flavor is full but a little bitter.<br /><br />It's just going to come down to if you like your coffee sweet or not.  Sweetened coffee drinkers are not going to like this much... but if you like stronger coffee this may be just your thing.  This is a very strong flavor for a very bold coffee lover.

review/summary: A Bit Too Strong for Me, but Tastier Than Most Canned Coffees
review/text: If you like iced coffee, you will probably prefer to continue drinking your favorite iced brand.  While I found this a bit too strong, it does have a better, less bitter flavor than most canned coffees, and the metallic taste I often notice in canned coffees is very light here.  For the money, I would not purchase it in this manner.  It's rather expensive for the small sized cans.  For someone who just likes an occassional iced coffee treat at home, it may be a good choice.

review/summary: Too Bitter and It Had Sugar In It
review/text: This coffee is way too bitter.  It also has sugar, which I despise sugar in my coffee.  When I saw it had sugar it in, I chilled it (got it really ice-cold) before I tried it, so that I could give it a shadow of a chance.  But even though it was chilled, it was still too bitter and sweet.<br /><br />Perhaps if there were no sugar in it, I might could have gotten over the bitterness and gave it a few more stars, even if I couldn't have given it 5 stars.<br /><br />But it was absolutely horrible.  Never again.  (And I do love coffee.)

review/summary: Too Bitter For My Taste
review/text: I had high hopes for this drink despite the fact that I prefer unsweetened drinks.  I poured it in the glass and was unhappy with how dark it was.  I took a sip and choked.  This drink is bitter and to me undrinkable.  It was like drinking the bottom of a burned pot of coffee.  I tried adding milk to the cup but it didn't lighten the color at all.  Even with the milk I couldn't drink it and down the drain it went.  Awful!

review/summary: Why it's only 4 stars
review/text: ****<br /><br />First, this drink, illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave;, 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12), definitely tastes like coffee as opposed to, say, tea or ketchup or turkey gravy.  Also, because I'm a bit of a coffee connoisseur (grind my own beans, ingeniously mix various varieties, use a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NTMHRW">Chemex 10 Cup Classic Glass Coffee Maker</a>, that sort of thing), I think I stand on pretty firms grounds here when I say this no standard brew haha.  It is much nearer the bitter end of the scale.<br /><br />Yet it is also sweet.  I don't know about you, but, first, to me the very idea of adding sugar to coffee is like adding honey to tea or ketchup to a bratwurst or turkey gravy to a filet mignon.  I like it!<br /><br />Speaking of which, according to the description on the Amazon page this product is "sweetened with beet [sic] sugar."  First, I think they mean "beaten" sugar, not "beat sugar."  That would be like saying molt lava instead of molten lava.  Also, they spelled "beat" wrong anyway.  Sheesh.  I don't subtract any stars for this, I just thought it was worth noting.<br /><br />****<br /><br />PRICE ERROR<br /><br />As of this writing there's another error in the description.  You get 12 6.8-ounce cans for $24.13, which is said to be 29 cents per ounce.  But if you do the math you get quite a different result.<br /><br />Oh heck, here, let me do it for you.<br /><br />6.8 ounces time 12 cans equals 81.6 ounces.  $24.13 times 100 equals 2,413 cents.  2,413 cents divided by 81.6 ounces per 12-pack equals exactly 29.5710784313725490196 cents per ounce (*where the least significant 16 digits repeat, and also which the decimal portion of which is equal to exactly 233 divided by 408, which as if you didn't know).<br /><br />As we round that number to less and less precision we discover that the 7 in the hundredths place forces the 5 in the tenths place to round up to 6.  And if you round 29.6 cents to some integral unit you are forced to round up to 30 cents; you may not round down to 29 cents.<br /><br />First, this is just plain false advertising.  I find it interesting, nay, suspicious, that the error just happens to be in the manufacturer's favor.  If you were to order a million cans of illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave;, 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12) that difference would make a difference, and here's the proof.<br /><br />A million cans at 6.8 ounces per can = 6,800,000 ounces.  At the incorrect stated price of 29 cents per ounce, the total would be 197,200,000 cents, which is $1,972,000.  But in fact, as I'm sure you'll remember, the price is 29.5710784313725490196* cents per ounce, which results in a total price for a million cans of $2,010.833.3333.<br /><br />[ 29 + ( 408 / 433 ) ] * 6,800,000<br />= 201,083,333.333 cents<br />= $2,010,833.33<br /><br />That's a difference of a whopping $38,833.33.  I don't know about you, but every time someone asks me whether I want a discount of nearly $39,000, I always say that I very much do.<br /><br />Now, I'm not saying that if you place an order for a million cans of this product and promise to pay up front in cash the manufacturer won't consider offering you some sort of deal, maybe throw in a free Coca-Cola mouse pad or something.  I'm just saying that the price per ounce as stated on the Amazon description page is incorrect, and I'm curious as to why.  Whatever the answer is, I don't see how it can be satisfactory.  So first, if you find out, let me know by composing a Comment at the bottom of this review.<br /><br />****<br /><br />CAFFEINE<br /><br />According to the Mayo Clinic web site, an 8.4-ounce can of Red Bull contains 76 to 80 milligrams of caffeine, which I will hereby fearlessly average to 78.  78 mg divided by 8.4 is 9.2857 mg per ounce.  The product under review contains 155 mg of caffeine per 6.8-ounce can, which works out to 22.7941 mg per ounce, so the percentage by which illy issimo is more caffeinated is calculated like this.<br /><br />(22.7941 - 9.2857) / 9.2857<br />= 13.5084 / 9.2857<br />= 1.455<br /><br />So, despite what any previous or future reviewer might putatively or may allegedly say or have said, this illy issimo contains about 145% more caffeine per ounce than Red Bull.<br /><br />But first, maybe we should be more interested in the total caffeine per can, not per ounce, because most people aren't going to choose between drinking all of a 6.8-ounce can of illy issimo on the one hand and, in, er, ON the other hand, drinking only 80.95% of an 8.4-ounce can of Red Bull; most people are going to drink all of whichever can they happen to have at hand.  If that's what we're measuring, here's the math.<br /><br />(155 mg - 78 mg) / 78 mg<br />= 77 / 78<br />= 0.98717<br />=98.7%<br /><br />98.7% is so close to 1 that what this means is that you get the same number of milligrams of caffeine from a can of Red Bull as from a can of illy issimo.<br /><br />****<br /><br />THE NAME<br /><br />Speaking of which, the name illy issimo is multiply confusing.  First, it doesn't have any capital letters, which I secretly regard as presumptuous but for which I subtract no stars, although in a better world I would.  It begs a typical speaker of English to think the first part of it refers the word ill, which means you're sick, i.e., you have some medical condition you wish you didn't have, which seems like a poor choice for the first name of a product designed for the sole purpose of being ingested into the body.<br /><br />The whole word "illy" is indeed the legitimate if somewhat unusual adjectival form of that word ill.  Illy means poorly or badly, as in, "Her review of that product was illy received by the manufacturer" or (more or less literally depending on how you interpret it), "He performed illy on his first autopsy."<br /><br />That first word illy, especially because it is uncapitalized, begs native speakers of English to fill in a first letter, and the choices are billy, dilly, filly, hilly, and silly.  I'll tell you that the first possibility that popped into my own personal mind was silly.<br /><br />With all these problems potentially in English speakers' minds, I my own personal self would have voted against the choice of the word illy to headline the name of this product or any other, if I had been asked, which I wasn't, which is no doubt why it is named what it is, which is no good reason to subtract any stars, which I won't.<br /><br />Still.<br /><br />****<br /><br />KOSHER!<br /><br />illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave;, 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12) is declared to be "Kosher Certified."  First and most important, that means if you restrict yourself to cans of coffee that have been kashered, you may safely drink this product without risking any bad outcomes that would arise if you didn't.<br /><br />I don't know about you, but I don't want my diet controlled by centuries-dead people -- people who couldn't possibly have had access to all the information that's now available about foods and nutrition -- who espoused antediluvian rules that proscribe meat that comes from "any animal that has cloven hoofs and doesn't ruminate," which excludes from their prescribed diet such extraordinarily useful food as pigs.  That so many people in 2012 refuse to eat pork products is astonishing to me.  And I don't want my diet controlled by a rule that dairy products and meat may not meet, which I'm pretty sure 100% rules out a properly prepared cheddar cheeseburger, which I'm pretty sure I will never rule out of my life as long as I can operate an outdoor grill or a simple stove.  I'm sure I should, by which I mean I'm sure I should forgo the cheese, but not for illy and capricious reasons but rather for health reasons, but the point is that this product IS kosher, so if you care about that then you have my blessing to go nuts.<br /><br />I award 4 stars because this product delivers what it says it will unless you order a million cans, in which case you're out $38,833.33.<br /><br />****<br /><br />Did you notice that eight times in the review above I started with "First," implying at some point a "Second," but that I never delivered even once?

The thing is, is this something so special that folks are going to go out and put down their cash for?  If you like iced coffee that's actually fairly potent and not made for a teenager (again no offense), then this is for you.  If you like iced coffee but money is important to you, just brew some at home etc...

review/summary: Clean taste of coffee without milk.
review/text: I love illy espresso, so when I saw that illy was offering canned coffee I was both happy and disgusted.<br /><br />As a former coffee snob, I was disappointed that my #1 commercial brand would stoop so low as to make canned coffee but at the same time, I was hoping that this would be the best canned coffee available since it was illy after all.<br /><br />This product is a single European cup (not US 8-oz mug) of black coffee with sugar.  Since it is meant to be consumed cold, there is more than your average amount of sugar in it as taste buds are less receptive to flavours as the temperature drops.  When chilled, this is a much richer tasting coffee product than Nestle, Mr Brown or UCC and the sweetness is as expected.  However, when this product is taken at room temperature or served warm, it is definitely too sweet.  I hesitate to compare this to Starbucks as each brand has its own "taste" and therefore its own fans.<br /><br />Obviously this illy canned coffee is nowhere near as flavourful as coffee from freshly ground illy beans, nor as good as fresh roasted beans from an artisan coffee house.<br /><br />Overall I liked it enough that I would buy this product if I was looking for a sweet cold canned/bottled coffee drink.

review/summary: Great as a mixer or in recipes
review/text: I don't usually drink espresso so this was a bit strong for me.  The flavor, however, was very good.  I drank part of it straight and mixed the rest with some milk and ice.  I preferred it prepared as an iced latte.  That is the great feature of this drink, it gives you so many options.  You can use it in recipes (Tiramisu comes to mind), frappes, iced lattes, lattes or just straight as a slightly sweet espresso. This would also be a great mixer for coffee cocktails. It would be nice to keep a can or two on hand in the pantry.  I personally probably wouldn't just be grabbing a can to drink straight because that's just not my thing but for anyone who likes strong coffee flavor it would be a treat.  If you're going on a camping trip, hike or to any location that you won't be able to brew a cup, packing a can of illy issimo would be a wonderful alternative.

review/text: I got a can of the Illy Issimo coffee drink to review through the Amazon Vine program.  I also review the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cappuccino, 8.45-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> which I liked quite a bit.  I wasn't as much a fan of this coffee drink as I was of the Cappuccino.<br /><br />The coffee drink comes in a pressurized can, so remember not to shake before opening or you will have a mess on your hands.  It's a pretty little can and is fairly sweet tasting.  They use real sugar to sweeten which it nice.<br /><br />I thought the coffee drink was a bit bitter despite the sweetness and that it didn't pack all that large of a punch.  It was okay but definitely not the best.  I personally enjoyed the Cappuccino version of this drink better, it wasn't so sweet or bitter and packed more of a caffeine boost.<br /><br />Overall it was okay, it you like coffee convenience items this one is lower in calories and uses real sugar. So you might want to give it a try.  It was more bitter than I like my coffee though and didn't pack much caffeine.

review/summary: Great kick, not too sweet
review/text: It's rare for a prepared coffee drink to actually taste like a proper espresso - dark, bold, and rich. But this one does. It's lightly sweetened (lightly being the operative word) and has no cream. I tried it two ways - first, I dumped a shot over vanilla ice cream. The bitter boldness went great with the smooth sweetness of the ice cream. Next, I tried it straight, then added cream to taste. It was excellent.<br /><br />If you're tired of all the corn syrup and icky creamers in so many of the packaged coffee drinks out there, give this one a "shot". It's just the right size for enjoying and it is great for coffee fans who are tired of the way Starbucks and others have turned coffee into a sickly-sweet milkshake-like experience.

review/summary: Not as great as I had hoped
review/text: Personally I enjoy coffee drinks from local stores and even canned drinks. So when I ordered this one I had high hopes. Sadly I wasn't as excited about it as I thought I would be. The drink is ok and in a pinch will satisfy a craving but overall if I had other choices I would not choose this one.

review/summary: A bit too strong and bitter for me
review/text: If you like strong coffee that isn't watered down with cream and sugar this probably will be more to your taste. I prefer the Starbucks little expresso drinks myself though, this is too strong for me.
