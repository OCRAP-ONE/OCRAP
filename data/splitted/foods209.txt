review/text: I bought this product because it was organic AND it contained the probiotic elements that my baby needed to help her digestive issues.  She does not eat it by itself, I add it to the home-made purees I make at home.

review/summary: Great alternative to Gerber
review/text: I had a hard time finding organic single grain cereal at the store.  All the grocery stores including Central Market and Whole Foods were completely out of the Earth's Best, and I don't really like the Gerber organic.  My baby was exclusively breast fed for the first six months, and I felt like this was the best transition to solids.  I also like that it's brown rice.  I feel good about giving it to my baby, and he likes it!

review/text: Happybellies was the answer to my prayers. We first used Earth's Best and had allergy problems. What a mystery! I though rice cereal was supposed to be pure and natural....but discovered that not all brands have nut or soy free products. We switched our daughter to Happybellies and she's an eating monster. Not only is this product iron fortified, but also has probiotics. Thank you Happybellies!

review/summary: Excellent product
review/text: I discovered the HappyBellies at Babies R Us and didn't know anything about it. (btw it is more expensive there) We started our baby on it in 4 months. She LOVES it and it is good for her belly. She used to be constipated from time to time even on the breast milk. Now she is much more regular. Once i could not find the HappyBellies rice cereal at the store and got the Earth Best instead. The baby didn't like it and it was hard to feed through the bottle<br /><br />The only problem i have is what's up with the 3/4 of the container? Why it is not as full as it's used to be? Keeping static price in expense of the quantity i guess? oh well...economy it is

review/text: So far a great choice for us.

review/summary: the babies love it
review/text: I make my own baby food - it tastes much better than the canned baby food and introduces them to the taste of real food. The only exception is that I give them the Happy Bellies oatmeal as well as their rice and multigrain. These have extra iron formulated to be easily absorbed and also the probiotics which are probably part of the reason both babies are nice and regular. They're organic and whole grain so they're healthy and train the babies taste to like whole grain. I mix it with water and they gobble it up and love it.

review/summary: multigrain version does not appeal to either of my twins
review/text: My now 1 yr old babies love the rice and oatmeal versions of this cereal, but hate the multigrain version.  Pity that I tried it out<br />as an amzn multipack, guess it will go into my second harvest bin.  Like other reviewers mentioned, it has a slightly stale<br />smell to it -- perhaps they don't wash the quinoa enough before processing it?  I taste everything my babies eat, and have<br />to mention that it does not have the melt in the mouth texture of the other two besides not tasting good.  My babies will eat quinoa for eg<br />when I cook it for family meals.  And amaranth in flakes from their brother's cereals.  Buy a single can from whole foods<br />or target etc before buying a multi pack.  They won't even eat it if I put in one tablespoon to 5 of rice cereal.  Ended up just tossing the open can.<br />Either of these is fantastic. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YSTGGW">HAPPYBELLIES Brown Rice Cereal Contains DHA and Probiotics, Organic, 7-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 6)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YSS7EO">HAPPYBELLIES Oatmeal Cereal, Organic, Contains DHA and Probiotics, 7-Ounce Containers (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Rice and Oatmeal Cereals - Toxic Hexane
review/text: The can of oatmeal clearly says they use Life's DHA (manufactured by Martek). If you research Martek (including their own site), you will find that they use hexane to extract the DHA from algae. Shame on Happy Baby for lying to parents by saying that they do not use any DHA extracted with hexane. Will never reccommend this product to anyone.<br /><br />Also, all the cans that I opened smelled rancid. I prefer Gerber Organic with Smart Nourish instead.

Her dad heard and said:  "...well I opened a new can of Oatmeal yesterday, and it smelled horrible, looks very different than past cans".  Sure enough, I opened it and it was horrible smelling and looked bad  (as noted in other reviews, dark grey flakes mixed in, much darker than normal).  There MUST be something wrong - I plan to contact the company tomorrow and would NOT recommend right now.

review/summary: Had been wonderful until September 2010 - now bad color/smell
review/text: My son (now 9 months old) has been eating HAPPYBELLIES organic oatmeal cereal twice a day since he was 6 months old, and loves it. So I love it too - until recently. The last container I bought had a different color and smell. All our cereal until now had been a cream-ish color, soft and flaky in texture and smelled like, well, oats. Not anymore. The recent batch had cereal that had black/gray-ish flakes mixed with the regular-looking oat flakes, and it smelled horrible, almost like mold or really, really rancid oil. I had bought that batch from [...] and they promptly issued a refund. Now I'm a fix as to what to feed my baby! I don't want to experiment with an unfamiliar brand given how much he loves this one, but again I don't want him to eat what clearly doesn't look or smell like food.<br /><br />Can someone, from either Amazon or HAPPYBELLIES, please repond to this and other similar concerns and put them to rest?

review/summary: Baby developed yeast diaper rash after trying this cereal
review/text: I have been giving my 8 month old happy bellies for the last month and noticed that after a process of elimination, this cereal has caused my baby to have a yeast diaper rash. She loved eating it so I gave it to her daily. I've done everything to take care of her diaper rash but it persisted even after I started applying nystatin which her pediatrician prescribed. I then decided to eliminate foods and monitor what happened to the rash and identified the happy bellies as the culprit. It's too bad because I thought that the probiotics would do her good but instead she's developed an annoying yeast diaper rash. Has anyone else's baby had any allergic reactions to this cereal?

It is also made without many of the fancy preservatives that are found in other more conventional brands.  We can't wait to try the other varieties!

Ever since I gave my 6 month old this organic oatmeal cereal (which she seemed to like with my breast milk) she has been constipated. Day no 4 and I am still waiting for her "full diaper"! I can see how much she is suffering trying to poop, I tried prunes and this product is still sitting in her little tummy. Waste of money!

review/summary: musty smell, baby could not stand it
review/text: This was my baby's first food (or at least I tried it) at 6 months. When I opened the can, a musty smell welcomed me. It had not gone bad from what I could see and it was well before the expiration date, it was just not terribly appetizing. Several times I went through the hassle of expressing breastmilk and mixing it with this stuff. There is no way I could get my baby to take this cereal, regardless of the milk to cereal ratio. I threw the stuff out and we went straight to real solids (non-pureed or mashed) after a few weeks. My baby has some preferences for which I do not want to rate this product poorly, however the musty smell was a turnoff for me too.

review/summary: Without Question, The Best Honey I Ever Tasted!
review/text: I planned to make a batch of blackberry mead (honey wine)and needed a good honey for that.  I'd read reviews of this honey, and most were glowing reviews.  One was even from a fellow mead brewer.  While some reported tasting or smelling a light blackberry flavor from this, I have to say that I didn't.  It is a dark, rich honey without the "hay taste" of clover honey.  My wife is not a fan of honey at all, having only eaten the supermarket garbage.  Even she loved this stuff, and kept going back for more.  I have my mead brewing (6 1/2 gallons), and the brewing yeast seems to love it too.  I ordered a second 12lb bucket of this honey for my next batch of mead, which will be black cherry.  Anna's Honey is the best I have ever tasted!

I am certain this is because they are no longer consuming the veritable slaughter house slop/floor waste - all of the garbage that is too toxic/inedible for human consumption is made into dog and cat food.  Not only slaughterhouse waste, but also sometimes animals who have been euthanized at shelters are "rendered" into "pet food".  I wish I could safely feed my cats a vegetarian diet, but as they are obligate carnivores, I cannot.  So, I shall continue to do the best I can and will do so by continuing to feed my dogs AvoDerm Natural Vegetarian Formula.

review/summary: Great food, super healthy dog
review/text: My vet recommended Avoderm for my dog several years ago due to the fact that he has a nail condition and could benefit from the formula this company uses for healthy skin and nails.  He is a picky eater with a sensitive stomach and we've never had any problems with this food.  I give him a mix of the vegetarian kind and the "lite" chicken and rice, both canned and dry, two meals per day.  He loves the food and at 10 1/2 years old (a large purebreed) he's healthier than he's ever been.  We've been thrilled and will never switch.

The smell was completely different. After a few months my dogs developed MALNUTRITION!  You should be deeply ashamed of your negligence.  Vegetarian dog food must be of the highest quality and carefully monitored for it's value..  I will let all dog owners know of this horrible experience.

review/summary: Tasty pepper corns
review/text: It taste different from the peppercorns you buy at the market.  Can't quite put my finger on it, but it is just different.  Tellicherry black pepper is suppose to be one of the best in the world and if you are a pepper expert, which I am not, you might be able to pick out the little differences. Anyway it is a nice pepper and at a very good price through Amazon, also a plus compared to what you pay for just any old peppercorns at the supermarket. I will definitely buy them again and I love the individual little bags. Thanks Melina for a great product.

Tellichery is a place in India where these peppercorns come from. India was the spice center of the world centuries ago and I think I know why. Grind up some of this and pepper your favorite to pepper food and you'll never go back to generic black pepper.<br /><br />Amazing aroma and flavor.

review/summary: Much better than you local supermarket
review/text: After having to deal with overpriced whole peppercorns of dubious quality from my local supermarket, I decided to give Amazon Grocery a spin.  The price and quality of these peppercorns was vastly better than the supermarket.<br /><br />Cons: lifetime supply of peppercorns if you don't use much (I do, and even then a pack of 6 is a lot of peppercorns).  Still Amazon Grocery appears to be a superior way to get your spices (and get it shipped free and fast).  Only mark down is for the lack of quantity control and a lower selection in certain items.

review/summary: Make sure you get the package best suited for your use
review/text: The qualities and benefits of Gatorade are well established. For the past almost two years, it has been my choice of electrolyte/carb post-workout drink. During long runs, I prefer electrolyte only tabs such as Nuun or GU so I can separately control electrolyte intake from carb intake. Also, it is easier to clean up the Camelback without the sugars in the fluids. But for cool down and recovery, this is what I turn to.<br /><br />The focus of my review here is to highlight that this is four packets of mix and each packet makes 2.5 gallons of drink. That's 10 gallons total. Fine for a sports team. A lifetime supply for one person at liter and half liter quantities.<br /><br />I ordered this several months ago. The product description as I write this today indicates the quantity. I am not sure whether it did when I ordered, or how I missed it if it did. In any event, I have a lot of my favorite drink.

review/summary: Be brave and just try it !  Put it in Yogurt or Applesauce
review/text: My secret weapon to perform hard work with a great attitude.  Guanine (a caffeine analog) gives a long lasting stimulant boost while theobromine provides the attitude adujstment of chocolate.  A wonderful delight that got me to quit coffee which is jittery, short-acting and just pale in comparison.<br /><br />Guanine is oil-based so it's hard to dissolve in water but that allows for slow-release in your body.  Be brave, depending on your body size use a teaspoon to a tablespoon.  If you can consume a tablespoon of coffee you can certainly consume a tbsp of this.<br /><br />Instead of trying to dissolve into liquid put it in Yogurt or Apple Sauce.  Makes a great low calorie breakfast that stays with you and reduces hunger.<br /><br />Truly an amazing product that leaves a six-hour silly grin on my face with motivation to clean the garage !

I actually think it may lengthen the effect even mnore by doing this and it is a fat soluble so it's a lot easier to get down. Because of the chemistry of this molecule, it is bitter and never tastes good. If it really bothers you, it's possible to order some gelatin capsules and make your own guarana capsules! That way you can swallow them and will not have to deal with the taste:)

review/text: I'm glad I bought two bags of this coffee because it turned out to be the coffee I was looking for for that first cup in the morning. It is rich, earthy, honest coffee that just tastes good! Roasting one's own coffee sounds exotic to many people, but people used to home-roast their beans all the time before about the 1930s. The aroma of home-roasted coffee filling the home is equal to that of a pot of fresh-ground coffee brewing for your breakfast. I don't know why more people don't do it, and if someone wanted to try, they would love the results with this coffee, never go back to the commercially-roasted and roasted variety. Blend with other varieties, and you can create your very own "house coffee". The possibilities are endless.

review/summary: Dog wasn't a fan
review/text: Purchased the roasted chicken flavor and product looks just as pictured.  Ingredients seems simple enough and the biscuits actually held up well during the shipping.  The only problem I have is that my dog does not care for it much.  She would eat it if I handed it to her, but the buddy biscuits fail miserably as a motivational tool. If I pull the buddy biscuits out of the box, she would initially look at me then just continue what she was doing earlier.  I know all dogs are different with their own tastes, but my dog loves to eat everything edible (and sometimes non-edible). To give an idea how her tastes are compared to your dog i'll list some items.<br /><br />She would eat...<br />Dog food brands (does not matter what flavors I tried with each brand): Natural Balance, Avoderm, Blue Buffalo, Orijen, Pedigree<br />Veggies:  Carrots, cabbage, lettuce, bell peppers, chili peppers (I have a chili pepper plant in the yard)<br /><br />She won't eat...<br />Citrus fruits (lemons and oranges)<br /><br />Basically, I assumed my dog would love to eat any treat and I purchased this because of the ingredients and cost. Sadly, I bought it in the 6pack and she isn't too fond of the treats.  I'm giving 3 stars for my situation, but your dog maybe different and love them.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Biscuits held up well during shipping<br />-Ingredients<br />-Cheap<br /><br />Negative:<br />-Fails to motivate dog or get her attention<br /><br />Pros? / Negative?:<br />-Dog will eat it....(although she would spit it out after I hand it to her, then stare at it, then look at me, and eventually eat it if I don't pull out another type of treat)

I also like that they are shaped like cute little gingerbread men and look cute in a clear cookie jar on the counter.  My dogs like the size, the crunch, and apparently the flavor.  When we get a new shipment of Buddy Biscuits using the Subscribe and Save feature on Amazon, they know immediately that it's for them and practically do flips until they get one.  These are definitely a staple in our dog pantry.

review/summary: True Lemon Lemonade
review/text: Ok, so I have to say that I did not enjoy the True Lemon Lemonade nearly as much as I enjoyed the True Lemon Raspberry Lemonade.  It didn't have nearly as much flavor, and the flavor it did have wasn't much like lemonade to me.  But the ingredients were still pretty good, and that's really what makes this brand stand out from the others.<br /><br />True Lemon products boast that they have 100% natural ingredients.  And its true, they do.  They use stevia instead of artificial sweeteners and actual lemon oil and juice for the flavoring.  This makes me think at least that what I'm drinking is healthy.  There's even some turmeric for color in here and that's actually a beneficial spice.  So all in all, a good product on the market.  A lot healthier than some of the other drink additives out there.<br /><br />The taste, not as good in this one.  Its not terrible, like some of the water additives I've tried, but it tastes extremely weak.  That and the pale yellow color the water turns it just isn't appetizing.  Its still got a sweet taste, but the tanginess of the lemon isn't really there and it more just tastes like sugar water.  I would say their estimate on the amount of flavoring per water ratio may be off and perhaps two packets would be a better choice for the water.  It may be something I have to try.<br /><br />I probably won't buy this particular flavor from True Lemon again, but it won't stop me from trying some of their other products.  And I will definitely get their Raspberry Lemonade again.  I just hope that maybe they improve this one or keep adding new products to their line up. It sure does help when that soda craving kicks in and I can have one of these instead.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/summary: A Great Alternative
review/text: First things first: if you've been drinking powdered drink mixes flavored with aspartame or similar chemicals, True Lemonade will probably take a bit of getting used to.  These days, everything is ridiculously over-sweetened, and our taste buds have become accustomed to it.  Now that I've been drinking True Lemonade for years, I don't know how I ever drank the other stuff.  It's all sickeningly sweet.<br /><br />True Lemonade is milder but perfectly palatable.  It won't replace fresh-squeezed lemonade or anything of that sort, but when it comes to naturally flavored, low calorie drink mixes, it's the best game in town.  I can't stand plain water, and this jazzes it up very nicely.  The flavor isn't watery or over-sweetened (and I actually use the packets meant for 16 oz in my 25 oz water bottle, so I get a much milder flavor than most people do).<br /><br />My only complaints might not apply to everyone, since they have to do with the packaging.  I wish True Lemon offered a container of just powder, sans the packets, since I don't use it on the go, and the packets just create extra waste.  I also recommend ordering from Amazon, because the official True Lemon store likes to send outrageous amounts of plastic packing peanuts along with the order, which shows a real lack of environmental awareness.  Amazon's packaging is much less wasteful.

review/summary: Weak lemonade, but low calorie
review/text: Lemonade is a summer staple: Tasty, cold, refreshing ... and made with LOTS of sugar. This product is sweetened with Stevia, a natural but low calorie sweetener which to me, tastes a bit like saccharine, including the aftertaste.<br /><br />When you mix this powder with 16 ounces of cold water, you are not going to mistake the result for actual lemonade. It is much weaker, and has the stevia flavor. However, its not bad either, and the calorie savings makes it a serious alternative when you have a lemonade craving. We find that if we add a few drops of RealLemon juice to the mixture, it blunts the stevia taste somewhat. We'll be drinking a lot of this throughout the summer.

review/summary: Bitter, empty taste
review/text: I was expecting this to taste like a weak version of what I make with my juicer. I was incredibly wrong. It has a very empty, dull taste to it while being fairly bitter (NOT sour!). It's extremely unpleasant, and now I have lots of this stuff I likely wont drink.<br /><br />I understand taste is a very subjective topic, and I'm sure there are people who might enjoy this. However, it tastes absolutely nothing like other drink mixes and absolutely nothing like lemonade you'd make yourself (from real lemons). Keep that in mind if you're looking for a more natural alternative to common drink mixes (as I was); this is not the answer.

Since there were so many of the same bottle I checked them all to add up prices and shipping (which I find annoying done on a per item basis!). I was thrilled when the last one I checked was the cheapest and happened to be from a company that I was considering reordering some other items. American Spice Company has a set shipping charge no matter the size of the order so I knew I had found my new source for mustard. When it came, it isn't quite the same as Amazon, but it is excellent in its own right. Enjoy!

I have done everything to eliminate the bugs. Naturally I disposed of every crumb of Swheat Scoop. But once you have these in your house, it is very difficult to get rid of them permanently, due to the life cycle of meal bugs. You think you've eliminated them, and then a few months later, they're back. Do not buy this product, even if you think it works great as a cat litter. You run the risk of being plagued by bugs forever.

review/summary: Absolutely fantastic - wouldn't use another litter
review/text: Interesting to read the other reviews - especially the ones that comment about the bugs.  We've been using Swheat Scoop since we adopted our cat in May of 2010 and haven't had a single problem with it.  There is only one local retailer that carries it and only in box form.  Maybe the bags can be infiltrated more easily by the bugs? Maybe it's the timing of maufacture and the environmental conditions at the factory or warehouse, and maybe its the location of the end-use litterbox and environmental conditions of the space? Or any combination of aforementioned possibilities... or I'm way off. Regarless, observations noted and I will look for problems in future batches - I'll make sure to add bay leaves as noted by another reviewer.<br /><br />I certainly won't plan on changing anytime soon, however, even with the chance of bugs.  This stuff is wonderful.  Grew up with cats and volunteered at a shelter. Will never buy clay again - the dust is awful and the fragrance even worse.  After several years of keeping their cat's box in a storage room, my parents found there was a layer of light, perfumy dust on EVERYTHING when they pulled the boxes and began sorting items for a rummage sale. Just think about that getting circulated around the house! They did try another natural litter after my experience with Swheat Scoop and ended up switching a short time later to this brand and are very glad they did. It only sticks to the bottom when the level starts to get low - so I add more and its fine again.  I try to scoop something every other day - may be a few days in between if life gets busy, but there is still not that much odor. It clumps nicely; however, I try to scoop when I know my cat hasn't used the box in a while just to make sure that the clumps have time to set up. Never had a problem otherwise. Flushing can sometimes be a problem if I get impatient and overload the bowl and then fail to let it soak and soften for a few minutes. But this particular toilet has issues, too.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Love this stuff, so do my parents; we'd recommend to anyone.
