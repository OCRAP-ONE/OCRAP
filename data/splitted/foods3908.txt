review/summary: These don't taste bad. They don't taste great, either.
review/text: They don't fill you up.<br /><br />My plan was, for lunch, to slowly eat one of these with a large glass of water. It's what my friend does with his nutrition bars.<br /><br />However, not only are these incredibly light, small, and I mean small, we're talking 3-4 bites, maybe 5-6 half-bites. Even if you chew 1-2 minutes(nearly impossible)<br /><br />They have a kind of sandy texture. Like you've just eaten caramel dipped in sand.<br /><br />The taste is alright, but I am disappointed. Triple Chocolate and I could not taste the chocolate. It barely tasted like anything...just had a kind of bland taste to it.<br /><br />At this price...I am disappointed massively. These were top rated by so many...<br /><br />But I think I will try the bar my friend has - his are 32g's of protein, 2.5x this ones, and only 30-40 more calories. Those are filling from what I've seen, have way more to them as well. Bigger, about 30% bigger size as well. To top it off? They are the same price and often on sale...they also have Vitamins and anti-oxidants.<br /><br />These, I don't know. If you down them with a Glass of Carnation instant breakfast, it goes well, kinda a good combo, not to heavy, just right. But this + water...not filling in the least.<br /><br />These are treats for after a meal, I suppose. I was looking for meal replacers. Ect, replace a breakfast here, or a lunch there. So I don't lose any muscle, just fat.<br /><br />I would recommend them if you want something very light to have as an after-snack to a small meal<br /><br />But these are not meal replacers. These do not go by themselves, you eat these + a meal. Just make sure you know that.<br /><br />It's my fault, I suppose for not researching.

review/summary: Not The Best Option Out There...
review/text: I had high hopes for these bars... I am a huge chocolate wafer fan! I am familiar with protein/energy bars and knew going into it that there would more than likely be a hint of that chalky protein bar flavor... but it hit me like a brick wall with the first bite. Luckily my husband has tastebuds that are muted to flavor, so he has slowly been able to work through this box of protein bars so we weren't just throwing money away... but wow. Just overall very disappointing. I went by reviews before deciding to purchase these, and most reviews were awesome...  so I can only assume that these are just one of those bars that is hit and miss. Some are going to love it, others are going to hate it. Unfortunately, I am in the latter group for this one. (And as a side-note, I shouldn't even call this a protein bar since it only contains 13g protein --- my all time favorite protein bar contains 20g. Granted, 13g is still a lot... but if you can choke this down, surely you can choke down a 20g bar with more flavor. In the future I will stick with my tried and true Chocolate Mint Builder's bars.)

review/summary: Mouth watering!
review/text: Over the last 3 years I have sampled every major protein bar offering and I have to say these Power Crunch bars are my favorite.  It has a very sugary, chocolate taste that is similar to real chocolate wafer cookies. Power Crunch does not have the thick, hard protein "paste" you'll find in most bars. The chocolate wafer style is soft and almost disintegrates in your mouth - quite a contrast from most protein bar offerings. I've eaten probably a dozen a week for the last six weeks and I still cannot get enough of these bars.<br /><br />In all fairness most protein bars have 30+ grams of protein - more than double the amount than the 14 grams in Power Crunch. So personally I consider Power Crunch to be a very healthy high protein candy bar rather than protein bar. But after tasting Power Crunch, it'll be a long time before I reach for another Detour, MET-Rx, Oh Yeah, South Beach, or any other bar.

review/summary: A *true* protein bar, does NOT contain hydrogenated oils!
review/text: My wife and I love these Power Crunch bars!  They have a great protein content and are low carb, which is great for our current exercise and diet routine.  Contrary to what's listed above, it does *not* contain hydrogenated *anything.*<br /><br />However, we're a bit concerned with the Palm Oil and Palm Kernel oils, and were told by BNRG that this was the healthiest alternative for the chocolately coating on the outside and the inside filling that would remain solid at room temps.<br /><br />My suggestion to them would be to make an alternative variety that has NO chocolatey coating (much like Bisco's sugar wafers), thus limiting the amount of oils that they'd need to use in these otherwise stellar protein bars.

review/summary: Cookies & Cream taste weird
review/text: I have had the vanilla, triple chocolate and PB versions of the power crunch bars and those are all very good.  The cookies & cream flavor however tastes very strongly of fake sugar.  For some reason the other flavors do a better job at masking this, the C&C  does not.<br /><br />I recommend having these with a hot drink, if you drink something cold while eating them you get a weird filmy coating to the roof of your mouth.  All flavors work well at keeping hunger away for 3 hours and do not cause gastric distress like some low carb bars can.  I prefer the other flavors over the C&C, but these are fine if the other flavors are gone and I need a quick bite with my morning coffee.<br /><br />I do not crave sweets after I eat a power crunch bar; sometimes sugar substitutes make me want to eat more sugar, but these actually cut my sweet tooth off at the pass.

review/summary: Taste like a chocolate covered wafer. With STEVIA!!!
review/text: I was looking for a bar to snack on that wasn't loaded with carbs and sugar. This was it. It only has 4g of sugar in the whole bar and the rest is STEVIA. I couldn't tell at first and i wondered why it still tasted sweet so when i read the label I found the stevia. LOW LOW LOW on carbs too. I hate the gummy yucky..chewy texture of most health bars or power bars. this was a nice change and crisp. I only eat the Triple chocolate and the chocolate peanut butter. Those are the only two flavors that use STEVIA. the other flavors use sucralose and tasted waaaayyyyy too sweet.<br /><br />I bought them online here becuz at the store they were usually 3/$5. SO this was a bargain.<br /><br />Love them, Thanks. Taste even better cold out of the fridge.

review/summary: Hydrolyzed protein is the best absorbed
review/text: These bars contain hydrolyzed whey protein, which is the highest quality. It doesnt matter if a bar contains 100g of protein if you dont absorb any of it. Hydrolyzation "pre digests" the protein so it absorbs more completely and quickly. These bars are the only ones that contain only hydrolyzed protein that I've found. Hydrolyzed protein also gives less gas. They taste great as well. They are very light and melt in your mouth a bit.

review/text: I love these things. Eating one of these bars is highly reminiscent of snarfing down a handful of those super-sweet wafer cookies in all their unhealthy, refined yumminess. The only problem? Despite the 14gr of protein, I find these bars utterly unsatisfying. As someone who needs to make sure every calorie counts bigtime, I can't afford to eat a protein bar that won't carry me over to the next mealtime. Unfortunately, I can (and have) devoured more than one of these at a time in a single sitting. I believe I purchased a single bar in the grocery store recently as a "treat", but I can never buy a whole box of these bars ever again. These taste great, no question (though I do detect the "protein" aftertaste), just don't get them if you shouldn't be cramming them down your throat two at a time. Unless, of course, you have more self control than I do.

Second, I've eaten them before and during workouts and I really do notice a difference in my energy level and stamina. There's no stimulants in it, as far as I can tell - and I don't feel a caffiene buzz or anything, I just notice myself motivated to keep going at times when before I definitely would have stopped. It's really fascinating! Plus, I didn't feel any gnawing hunger to consume high energy (meat, cheese, etc.) stuff at the end of the workout like usual. I'm a skeptic when it comes to different health fads and supplements and stuff, and this looked sorta like one of those that looked fancy but just were a waste of money. But after this second time of trying one right before a workout, I'm convinced this is quality stuff, and I just bought 2 dozen more!

review/summary: So good
review/text: I love these bars. They're low in carbs 3-4% per bar, light texure, and great taste. I especially like the triple chocolate or peanut butter fudge flavors. The berry flavor has a slight after taste and I wasn't a fan of the peanut butter flavor. These are great if you're watching carb intake and they make a guilt free quick snack.

review/summary: Soy-less protein bars that taste good...
review/text: I was looking for some protein bars that taste good and were soyless. These come close (soy lethicin is still listed).<br />Warning: don't order in warm climate/weather as the chocolate coating melts, even in your hands from holding it.<br />The stevia (sweetener) has a noticeable aftertaste that needs getting used to.<br />I still need to find a substitute protein bar that is good for you, not made of soy and tastes good.<br />I have to say, other than the above, these are light and crispy.

review/text: This is a great snack bar.  But don't expect normal chocolate taste.  It's different.  Not horrible, but different.  After the first bite and you kinda adjust it's fine.  I think the vanilla one is a little more of a real taste.  But the bar itself is great- I love the low sugar- definitely the best low sugar chocolate protein bar I have tasted.

review/text: I love these bars!!  I eat this for breakfast and lunch due to a very hectic schedule that doesn't allow me to sit and eat.  I can only find them "locally" at the wt loss centers 1 hour away.  No time for that!  However, I'm disappointed that I can only receive 3 boxes at a time then I'm limited when I try to order more.  I go through 3 boxes in less than 1 month.  Any tips?!!

review/summary: Best tasting protein bars
review/text: These are the best tasting protein bars i've ever eaten. the taste sweet but only have 5 grams of sugar. they don't have that bad chemically tasting sweetness that alot of low sugar foods have.  they only have 200 calories whereas most of the protein bars i've tried have over 300 calories.  i've been trying to lose weight and starting eat one of these bars a day to try and keep myself from eating candy bars. they definitly satisfy my craving for sweets. i've lost 4 lbs in the past few weeks so at least i know they aren't preventing me from losing weight like my daily candy bar fix was.  also the carb amount is fairly low in these bars. i'm hooked on them and will plan to keep buying them in bulk.

review/summary: Guilt-free and delicious
review/text: Most protein bars are either loaded with sugar (and if you are in the market for protein bars, you probably don't want tons of simple carbs) or sugar alcohols (which are an excellent laxative! it does let manufacturers say say 'low sugar' on the packaging though), have a strange taste to them, and honestly aren't as good as a source of protein as they may appear -- most contain Soy protein.<br />They also tend to have a texture that isn't very appetizing, either really chewey or really gooey.<br /><br />The main difference with these bars is that they taste amazing. They taste what they look like - a giant chocolate wafer, have very little sugar and no sugar alcohols either. They have a pure whey protein source, no soy protein in these (I always read the packaging on protein bars and sadly soy protein is very common). Nutritionally they are not too bad at all, they are definitely great for a pre-workout treat. They are fairly high in fat, very low in carbs, and middle of the road protein (for a protein bar).  But the fact that it has 0 sugar alcohol, very low sugar, whey protein instead of soy and taste delicious really does make up for the higher fat content.<br /><br />Now it isn't really a downside but they are dry and make your mouth water a ton - make sure you have something to drink with them. But really these are my favorite protein/energy bars out there.

review/summary: It's like a cookie . . . with protein!  Yum, yum, yum.
review/text: I stumbled upon these quite by accident: a co-worker left them in the kitchen (people often bring in leftovers or things to share).  I read the package and mused "Creme filled wafer bar?  Intriguing."  I'd never heard the words "wafer" and "protein" used in the same sentence.  But I remembered how much I used to love going to my grandma's house as a kid because she used to keep vanilla, chocolate and strawberry wafer cookies in the cookie jar.<br /><br />These tasty, light crunchy wafers do remind me of those wafer cookies from my childhood.  The peanut butter ones are sweetened with fructose and stevia.  Stevia is a natural swetener with a sightly unusual taste that might be jarring if you're not used it.  It's sweet, but doesn't taste quite like sugar, which is what I like about it.  These bars are just sweet enough to be enjoyable, but not sweet enough that I would want to devour a whole box of them like I would a candy bar.<br /><br />They are light and crispy, and perfect as a snack or a treat.  They're only 10 grams of carbs and 5 grams of sugar [just over a teaspoon] - perfect if you're watching your carbs and want a sweet[ish] snack.  I brought the chocolate one with me to the movies the other night, and while other people had their candy, I had my own "candy" to enjoy, without the suagr high and with the benefit of 13 g of portein.  I can't see a big, buff muscley guy getting a lot out of them [men need more calories & protein], but for me, they are the perfect addition to my health and fitness plan.<br /><br />The only thing I'd change [for nutritional purposes] would be to add more fiber.  But I suppose adding that would affect the texture and possibly the taste.

review/text: So far I have only tried the Vanilla and Chocolate and they were both excellent! These bars were suggested by one of the top weight loss Doctors in the country. Combining these bars for breakfast, having a protein and vegetable for lunch and a protein and vegetable for dinner and sugar free jello or sugar free pudding .for dessert I have lost 14 pounds in 4 weeks and I don't have much more to lose!<br /><br />My Doctor told me that you must multiply the grams of protein in this bar times 2.5 to get the true grams of protein, since the protein used in these bars are di- and tri- peptides, and you absorb 2.5 more of the actual protein than in a regular protein meal. Therefore the true protein grams are:<br /><br />Peanut Butter Cream: 32.5g Protein<br />Peanut Butter Fudge: 32.5g Protein<br />Triple Chocolate: 32.5g Protein<br />Cookies & Cream: 35g Protein<br />Vanilla Cream: 35g Protein<br />Wild Berry Cream: 35g Protein

The carb count is good but the fat content is high so we only use this as a treat when he really needs something sweet and other low carb food is not satisfying him. Highly recommend it in moderation. We want to try some of the other flavors now.

review/summary: Tastes great!
review/text: I have tried lots of different protein bars but the main problem is always the same, they taste like protein bars. This is my favorite because it tastes like eating a normal chocolate waffer candy bar. Chocolate is my favorite, followed by peanut butter. Great for a snack, I take one with me when I go out with friends so I have a tasty healthy treat.

review/summary: Tastes like a Lil Debby
review/text: Remember those Lil Debby peanut butter stick things? That's what these protein bars taste like. These are probably the most flavorful protein bars I have ever had. They aren't grainy like many others and they keep me full when I need it as an afternoon or preworkout snack. Sometimes there is a bit of dry after taste, but it is quickly solved with a swigg of water.

review/text: I've had many protein bars over the years, and don't generally enjoy them because they tend to be dense and lay heavy in the stomach.<br /><br />Not these!  These bars are very light, crunchy, and delish!  Even my picky daughter likes these!  My brother had me try one, and I had to order.<br /><br />Amazon had the fastest shipping (1 day turnover, WOW!) and by FAR the best per/case prices.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Fantastic bar
review/text: I am recovering from pretty extensive GI surgery, so while I need a lot of protein, I have to be careful about what I eat to get it. I am on a bland diet and sensitive to many things right now, so I was having a hard time figuring out new things to eat during the day that are still somewhat healthy.<br /><br />I researched protein bars for days and all of them had either tons of sugar alcohols or were loaded with nuts or fiber. I needed one that would be easily digestible. I was SO glad when I found these but I only purchased one because I was still skeptical. Needless to say, here I am on Amazon buying them by the box.<br /><br />These bars are light, easy to digest, don't sit in your stomach like a brick, and one bar in the morning will curb your hunger until you're ready for lunch. I appreciate that they have 3 new bars that are sucralose free. I just wish they had more flavors!!!

review/summary: Good Protein Bar
review/text: These are pretty good bars.  I like that they don't have 30 grams of protein, so I can actually finish a whole one without feeling lethargic.  They are low carb, which is kind of what I wanted...but I don't enjoy the artificial sweetener in it.  I would honestly rather not have it sweet, but I'm sure most people won't find this an issue.

review/summary: Weight to calorie ratio
review/text: Wafer is light weight but a package of french vanilla packs over 200 calories!  Weight to calorie ratio is important while hiking/backpacking.  This bar is lighter than most power bars on the market and tastes DELICIOUSLY like a desert!<br /><br />I only tried the vanilla flavor therefore I can't recommend other flavor but I am heading to my local Trader Joe's to get cookie n cream and the berry flavor to try (am tired of the chocolate and peanut butter varieties among all the energy bars).<br /><br />The vanilla wafer isn't too sweet and the crunch wafer is a great alternative from the usual soft/dense/chewy energy bars out there.

review/text: Very good texture and taste. I have tried quite a few different bars over the last few months, and these are easily the best.  They are light and don't weigh you down, but are still enough to ease hunger.  Especially good after a workout or for a high protein dessert when you want something sweet.  They do however have sugar in the ingredient list, but only have 5 grams of sugar for the whole bar.

review/summary: Perfect for adding flavor to dry food. Our little dog loves this stuff
review/text: I don't know a lot about dogs but I thought they ate anything. The dachshund we had growing up would eat banana peels if you left them out. We rescued a Maltese (5 years ago now) and while he is healthy, he eats when he's hungry and leaves the rest.  He's never like doggy treats, bones etc. and prefers human food/meat to anything for dogs. Since I've read dry food is best for dogs we feed him dry but again, he eats when hungry but doesn't lick his chops. Cesar is the best dog food I've found to add to the dry for taste. We get at least 4 feedings from one container, which make it pretty cheap. We simply mix a spoonful into the dry food for flavor and he's got the best of both worlds. If I could find a dry food tasty enough to be served solo, I would buy it but he eats such a small amount of food I don't mind making it tasty.

I think that that focus on fame (and money) is apparent in his approach to dog food:  Give crummy food nice packaging and an appealing name.<br /><br />That one's dog will eat it is no advertisement.  First, the only thing one really has to do to sell dog food is make it so the dogs will eat it.  That the dog will eat it is no measure of the quality or benefit of the food.

review/summary: We're both happy at long last!
review/text: I have two dogs, but only one of them eats Cesar chicken "in meaty juices" (it HAS to be the "in meaty juices kind!) and she GOBBLES IT. after years of searching for a food she'll eat to enjoy, not just eat to survive, we've finally found a winner!<br /><br /> Gigi is a 9-year-old Papillon mix who is both dainty, firecely independent, and plain fierce when she's disturbed, while 1-year-old Mini-Dachshund Sophie is a happy, bouncy, and utterly addicted to attention. Gigi spends her time under the bed, Sophie is wherever I am. What Sophie eats is actually still TBD. This is Gigi's review.<br /><br />Both of them have been picky eaters. Gigi went years on starving herself until she couldn't hold out any longer, then deigning to eat the dry food we supply between wet food dinners, even as we tried all kinds of different foods to tempt her. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KH02I">Beneful Dog Food Prepared Meals Beef Stew Dog Food, 10-Ounce Plastic Containers (Pack of 8)</a> used to work now and then, and though it was expensive, we could get 3 servings from it. However, even though it had a lid, it would often grow moldy even before the next meal. So even though she liked it, it was wasted and really too expensive anyway.<br /><br />When Sohpie arrived, we'd been serving <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJF62Y">Mighty Dog Hearty Pulled-Style Chicken Dinner In Gravy, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> with the longest sustained success yet, about a year. Only chicken, mind you, and it had to be the chunky in sauce kind, NOT the pate kind. Well, along came the puppy, and Gigi expressed her distaste by wasting food again.<br /><br />Finally, I've found Cesar. And oddly, now it has to be the p�t&eacute; kind, I.e. "in meaty juices" NOT the chunky kind! But AT LAST we've found a dog food that The Mrs. will absolutely SNARF ON. She doesn't come up for air when I put any chicken-based "in meaty juices" Cesar dinner in front of her, which I cube into bite sizes.<br /><br />The added bonus is that I can hide pills in the cubes. Gigi's been diagnosed with congenital heart failure, and she's on 3 different pills, 3 times a day. Dinner is the easier dose, because I just push the little pills into the soft p�t&eacute;, and she's none the wiser because she swallows the cubes almost whole! Sadly, we won't probably have Gigi with us for the fourteen or fifteen years I've been blessed to have spent with my previous dogs. But I'm determined to make sure she's as healthy and happy as possible in the time we have. She may be feisty, prickly, and a loner, but when I *can* catch her, she does love to snuggle with her mama.<br /><br />Cesar "in nearby juices" dog food might just give me a few month's more snuggled than we'd otherwise have.
