review/summary: Good taste, but FULL of shell pieces
review/text: I ordered two boxes, one each of the Almond Coconut and Date Walnut.<br />Tasted decent enough but both are CHOCK FULL O' Nut SHELLS.  I took some walnut shell shrapnel to the the gum line and my wife pulled it out with a pair of hemostats.  It was almost 1/8th" long and looked like a sabre tooth fang.<br /><br />Can't take any more chances on the rest.  Chew with extreme prejudice.

review/summary: Almond and Apricot? No, almond and coconut.
review/text: Just FYI, for those that don't prefer coconut like me, these Almond and Apricot bars are LOADED with coconut. It is the 2nd ingredient. You can taste the apricot, as a subtle aftertaste, but other than that, it might as well not be in the bar. The coconut pieces linger in your mouth, so carry a toothbrush close-by.

review/text: I was really impressed with this Kind bar. It tasted like an Almond Joy candy bar, but without the chocolate. I'm a chocoholic, but didn't really miss it in the bar.<br />I bought an extra box, just in case my kids started taking them. Good decision!! They are already gone, so I'm glad I have a hidden box just for me.

review/text: As with other Kind Bars, I love these!  If you find that the Fruit and Nut Delight bar is too crunchy, try this one!  The dates are soft as are the walnuts (and it is less densely packed with nuts).  An excellent, healthy snack (and the price on Amazon is WAY less than the store where I found these for $1.69 each!)  Use Subscribe and Save to get an even better price on these.  You'll want to keep them coming!

review/text: I love these bars!  It is hard to find decent gluten-free snacks, and, these are a treasure!  They are packed with crunchy nuts and sweet fruit.  I like that they are all natural, too.  I don't feel guilty indulging with these.  They are great to take along to the office, for lunch or snacks, or on the road, and, considering their size, they are really quite filling and satisfying! They are, of course, a little pricey, but, buying them by the case from Amazon (especially if you use Subscribe and Save) makes them less expensive than they are at the local health food store. Excellent!

review/summary: one of a KIND, delicious gluten free bar
review/text: I have never been one to rely on nor crave a bar. Following a gluten-free and low- allergy controlled diet, I stumbled across these KIND bars while looking for nutritious options for my teens, thinking I would be able to try them. Well indeed they truly are scrumptuous. My 18 year old loves them and when running out the door will grab one or two for the road. I have only tried the Walnut and Date and the Cranbery, Almonds and Oxidants as I follow a blood type diet and do not love things that are too sweet. We are on our second box of each and I will be looking at the other varieties to try in time.

review/text: I'm currently doing a self experiment where I have cut out all dairy and all gluten for a month.  I didn't realize that in doing this, I'd have to be making almost every single meal I ate from scratch.<br /><br />I knew about Larabars, but I wanted something with more crunch for snacks that I could throw in my bag.  I stumbled upon these at a local store, bought one of each flavor, and just fell in love.  The Almond Coconut is my favorite.  It really tastes like a candy bar!  It's so nice to have something so healthy in my bag so that I can avoid temptation when temptation strikes!  Thanks KIND!!!<br /><br />Oh, and I ordered these on a Wednesday morning, and they were delivered on that Friday afternoon!  Thanks Amazon!

Sugar and Glucose in the cranberry bars and honey and Glucose in the almond & coconut.

I ordered the apricot/coconut which is heavenly, and almost inhaled two boxes. I started to notice some weight gain and when I checked the calorie count, I was shocked to see that one little bar has up to 190 calories! I was eating up to 3-4 bars a day because they taste so good and are small and light. I realized that I consuming over 700 additional calories daily. Yikes! I think these are great for athletes and runners who burn lots of calories and need the extra fuel or as a snack in between meals. The only problem is that they are small and light and for me I don't get enough satisfaction from just one bar.

review/summary: Eat at your own risk
review/text: Kind bars taste great and pack a nutritional punch, but they pack another kind of punch as well.  On October 10, I bit into an almond/fruit bar and broke a front crown.  What made it worse (and more expensive) is that I was en route from Chicago to San Francisco at the time so the accident made it imperative to seek emergency dental care for a temporary crown in SF and then have the permanent crown made upon my return home.  Total sticker price for that Kind bar:  $1665, not counting the cost of the bar itself.  I called Kind's corporate headquarters in New York and was referred to its insurance company, Chubb, which declined to assist me with any of my bills on the grounds that the company was not negligent.  That's a matter of interpretation, I think, but rather than pursue silly litigation that would cost more than I've already spent, I think I'll just do my civic duty and warn Kind's buyers in the most public way I can think of to beware when eating these bars.  They're delicious, but they can break teeth.  Let the Kind eater beware:  caveat emptor, caveat vore.

review/text: I was looking for a healty snack and these got good reviews. My first impression was that these are very small and extremely bland tasting. The almonds were slightly soft and did not thaste very much like almonds, but it was edible. The second bar had a spot that tasted really bad as if one of the nuts were bad. The third bar was ok, but then it was almost every bar after that was bad. I ended upo throwing the last few bars away. The packaging was sealed properly and it was well within it's expiration date. These bars also have a way of twisting your teeth around to the point I thought I might have damaged one of my teeth. If you want an equally healthy snack for a better price, pick up a bag of mixed nuts/trail mix from your grocery store.

review/summary: a better snack than most granola bars
review/text: The almond and apricot bars make the best emergency snacks I've found. The bar is pliable rather than extra chewy or crunchy, and while it's definitely sweet it's not as sweet as the ones with yogurt. Finishing one is usually enough to fix a hungry headache or blood-sugar crash, and satiating enough that I'm not rooting around for more food if I've somehow skipped lunch. The gluten-free is an extra bonus; I've got a few friends with celiac, so being able to share with them is quite nice.

review/text: These are my favorite variety from the KIND bars. If you are expecting a chewy and sweet (very sweet) bar that does not make you feel guilty, this is the right kind of bar for you! Additionally, the price on amazon is very good as they retail on other places for over 2 dollars a piece!

review/text: I buy these often, and I get a pretty good deal from amazon compared to getting it in the stores.  I keep some in my desk at work, gym bag, and ocket book for when a hunger attack comes on.  I like that it is low glycemic too, I don't worry too much about a rapid spike in sugar.  It is very sweet for those with sensitive taste buds.  Not a meal replacement but a good hold off until you can get a meal.

review/text: We love Kind bars and regularly get about four of the varieties.  They are delicious, healthy, and reasonably priced on Amazon.  You pay a lot more for them in shops, that is, if you can find them.<br /><br />They also make great gifts, especially 'thank-you' gifts. I just sent two orders to my daughter and brother.<br /><br />We are delighted with the Amazon subscription program.  We automatically receive three different Kinds every two months, but if we run out, it is easy to get an extra order quickly. The service is excellent.

review/text: I use these bars (macadamia and apricot are my favorite) as meal replacements on the go. They have a tremendous energy punch and satiate my hunger for a long time. The best thing about them is that they taste like real food, not some dry rice crispy treat like so many others.<br /><br />Getting these through Amazon is wonderful because I finally get fresh bars (usually expired in the health food stores near me if I can find them at all) and a terrific price. I definitely recommend subscribing. It's a great service.

review/text: After searching high and low for some kind of snack food bar to stash in my purse that wasn't chock full of soy, hydrogenated oils and other nasty things I gave these a go - and I was amazed!<br /><br />These are delectable - really almost like eating candy, only good for you. I tried about four different flavors so far and have liked them all. I appreciate that the labels are quite clear, so those of us who can't have soy can see at a glance exactly which ones we can and can't have.<br /><br />These did not get mushed or sticky or stale the way so many things do - they are a fantastic option and I will definitely be buying more!

Gluten-free foods tend to be very expensive and being able to get them from Amazon is wonderful.

review/summary: One of my favorite
review/text: I absolutely love the flavor of the Kind bars, and this one is my favorite.  For people complaining about the fat.....NUTS HAVE FAT.  But that is the only source of fat in these bars.  Nuts are also full of vitamins and minerals..oh yes and PROTEIN.  These actually do taste like candy, and are a great pick me up snack.  If you want something filling though, and more of a meal replacement...go with Clif bars.  They can keep you going for quite awhile.  My real complaint with these?  The price.  No matter where you get them, they are on the high end.  I have 4 children and I cannot afford to keep these around as a regular staple.  Even buying directly, you have to get them in cases of 72..for over a 100 bucks.  Larabars if I am savvy I can get for about 1.00 a bar, and even though the texture is different (since they pretty much pulverize the nuts) are awesome and simple healthy organic, non GMO, gluten free, raw diet, vegan, most are lactose free variety's, and if the word peanut is not in the ingredients they were made in a non-peanut plant.  Kind can boast most of these too....larabars do take a couple extra steps.  they are also free-trade certified.....Oh and they have 19 flavors of their basic bars.

review/summary: great sweet treat
review/text: Every once in a while, I'll have a KIND bar for my 3 'o clock snack at work. I had no problem polishing off my whole box in around 2 weeks all by myself, because they're so delicious!<br /><br />Like other reviewers have said, the bar tastes really sweet. I'm a candy/chocolate-loving person and I prefer the KIND bar for my sugar fix. It does have 16g carbs, of which 13g are sugar, so while it may be "all natural", it has quite a bit of "all natural" sugar. While not the healthiest snack option, its satisfying and yummy enough to keep me away from my even less healthy options.<br /><br />Though I enjoyed the Almond & Apricot bar, my favorite is the Macadamia and Apricot. If you're worried about a lot of chewiness like some of the other reviewers, try the Macadamia option. It is truly melt-in-your-mouth delicious and the soft macadamias perfectly complement the sweet chewiness of the fruit and coconut with an amazing texture. I haven't tried any other flavors, but I will soon!

review/summary: Better than most bars, for sure- very nutty!
review/text: I usually don't like "nutrition" bars- if I'm hungry and in a hurry, I don't like to try and choke down a grain-type bar that requires a lot of water  or liquid to get it down. These bars are great because there's no grain involved. It's just a delightful blend of dried fruit and crunchy toasted almonds- a bit of a tang to balance out the sweetness. Not TOO dry- still moist, chewy, crunchy, and very delicious.<br />I realize grains may be important to some people, but I usually just have trouble eating those style bars.<br />This, I look forward to- and in a pinch, it makes a tasty dessert- healthier than lots of other things.

review/text: Like others have commented, Amazon has done a really poor job with the packaging on these.  The 12-pack ships from Missouri, and I'm not sure what kind of storage facilities Amazon or UPS has, but the bars are completed melted by the time you receive them, which is very disappointing.  When Amazon used to carry the sesame-peanut-chocolate in the 8-pack, the biggest complaint was that those bars were too tough to chew.  Now they're just mushy.  Bring back the tough bars!

review/summary: I like Kind bars but not this flavor
review/text: This flavor has an overwhelming peanut, i.e. peanut butter flavor with a tart, fruity flavor reminding me of a PB&J sandwich.  I didn't enjoy it but that may be because I don't like peanut butter.  Too many peanuts ("nuts" to me doesn't mean a majority of peanuts) and too tart of fruit, too pasty texture of fruit as well as too much of it.  I prefer nutty with no peanuts and chewy, sweeter fruit pieces.  My bars were fresh and chewy (a tad on the soft side).  I'd picked up various flavors at small local stores and enjoyed them so grabbed this when it went on sale to try.  I'll not buy this flavor again but do recommend the brand.

review/text: The cost of the items is very high.  Almost $1.60 for each bar.  In my opinion, this is excessive.<br /><br />However, these bars are fantastic and you can literally see all of the nuts (whole) that make the bar.  The exterior is slightly sweet, but is really balanced with the falvor and crunch of the nuts.  It is about the perfect size bar for my breakfast.<br /><br />I bought the one's in the yogurt since it gives the bar a creamy smooth flavor.<br /><br />I will continue to buy them since they're the best nut bar I've had.

review/summary: A little stale...but I'll give them another chance
review/text: I searched out my favorite KIND bars on Amazon because I was buying them every day at the mini mart for nearly two dollars each.  These are the best; not too sweet, very filling, perfect for a post-workout craving.  I signed up for Subscribe and Save to get the best deal and because I know I'll go through these things. My first delivery came within a week but I'm sad to say that they were stale.  Not flat-out gross, thankfully they still taste good. But they are super hard and chewy (much more so than normal) and appear to have been exposed to high heat, like they melted a bit at some point.  I've got to admit that I never looked at the expiration date on one that I've bought at a mini mart, but that's probably because they've never been stale or given me cause to question the freshness. As it turns out, the case I have now was delivered in September 2012 and expires in October 2013, so they should be fine. Hopefully, this was just a fluke and the next case will be better.  If not, they're getting returned and I'll find another source.  So, the KIND Fruit & Nut bars would normally get 5 stars from me, but my experience by ordering them through Amazon brought them down a few stars.  I'll try to remember to update in the future.

review/summary: Great product and cheaper than buying it in the grocery store!
review/text: The fruit and nut almond apricot is the best product they make so far! These snack bars are a artificial ingredient free healthy alternative to a nutragrain bar or some other power bar. they really fill you up as far as snack bars go and they keep well even in heat. They are as healthy as you are going to get in a snack bar!

review/summary: Extra ingredients made these in edible!
review/text: I love kind bars!  As a super allergic person these have been very helpful. However when I received the "apple cinnamon pecan" bars, tore open the first one and saw CASHEW pieces, sadness resulted. If there is an ingredient as allergy causing as peanuts or cashews in a bar that I could SEE upon opening it should be noted somewhere. My mother won as I gave her the box if bars but I, sadly, had a big disappointment.

review/summary: Excellent gluten free snack
review/text: My wife has celiac disease, so must have a gluten free diet.  It is not a lifestyle choice. These Kind bars provide a great tasting snack with plenty of hearty crunch.  They are so tasty, I even sneak one now and again. If you require a gluten free diet, but can eat nuts, then you owe it to yourself to give them a try.

review/summary: Apricot & Almond bars satisfy me!
review/text: I have recently discovered the Kind bars and thoroughly enjoy them because they genuinely taste good and are a reasonable expense. The Apricot & Almond bars are my favorite and are now entered into subscription . . . I love them as an anytime snack! Healthy yes, but these are way better tasting than most granola bars! The nuts with dried fruit remind me of the vegetarian version of pemmican. These are rich tasting, low glycemic impact, nice crunch, sweet & tangy fruit with a bit of chew for enjoyment!! I have these bars with a cup'o'Kicking Horse coffee and am "in the saddle" and energized!

review/summary: Stays better intact than protein bars in the heat
review/text: Usually, I consume protein bars during my work day, but I had to search for something to replace those bars during the hotter months in my part of California because protein bars melt quite quickly if not stored in a cooler with ice packs. I was on the search for something that would not weigh me down during the work day, taste good, and portable. I tried several other flavors before I found two that agreed with my taste buds - almond & coconut and nut delight.

review/text: I grabbed a variety of various protein/energy bars, including a few different KIND bars after I got a free sample of the Dark Chocolate & Sea Salt. The DCK & Sea Salt flavor is now my ultimate measuring stick for the rest of the salty sweet snacks KIND provides. The Almond & Apricot flavor is particularly disappointing, unfortunately. Many of the other varieties are very satiating and flavorful, but the apricot fruit in combination with the nuts in this bar are a misplaced one. They just don't make sense on my pallet.

review/text: Even though I like the taste of these bars (Apricot & Macademia) because of presense of macademia nuts, i am kind of upset with the company (KIND).  In the past 6 months, the bars got A LOT smaller, and price for an individual bar went up.  I hate when companies do that. It's called greed.<br />As the the stale taste (in other reviews) -- I do know that macademia nuts go stale very fast.  I don't know what can be done about that, short of making them salty for preservation.

review/summary: Fresh lemon all year long
review/text: This organic squeeze contains fragrant oil from the lemon peel, and, in my opinion, that is what gives it the fresh zing that is pasturized out of most bottled lemon juices. This one tastes more real than any bottled or squeezed lemon product, it is very close to fresh wedges. I squeeze it in soda, tea, on rice and veggies, even in cake icings. Rim cocktail glasses or just squirt a little in your water bottle. I like putting a pitcher of water out on the dinner table with a slice of lemon in it, but while it looks lovely, the peel can give the water a bitter taste after a few hours. A squirt of this does the trick without any bitterness! Pop in the fridge after breaking the seal.

review/summary: Really does taste like fresh squeezed!
review/text: If you compare this w/ the conventional plastic juice lemons found in your grocery store or even the green bottled lemon juices, you will taste a major difference. I think it is due to the added lemon oil. My incentive to purchase this item was mainly for an economical organic lemon juice that I would enjoy and this juice exceeds my expectations. Of course I'd prefer a container such as a small glass bottle like Lakewood organic lemon juice uses but for the price difference I'll keep my fingers crossed that the plastic containers are BPA free. Another plus is Italy is highly regarded for their quality lemons and this product certainly supports that claim. Lemonade anyone?

On the negative side, the closure of this product is inferior-- it is a snap closure with a small peg that inserts to seal the container.  Be careful not to bend the container when opening the package, or you may have difficulty getting it to close.  Overall recommended, but the seal is an issue, since the seal keeps the product fresh.

review/summary: Best Lemon Juice Ever!
review/text: A while ago, I decided to lose some weight and one of the most important things I did was to cut out all juice, soda, or any other sugar-added drink from my diet. I immediately felt better and started dropping weight, but quickly got bored with the taste of plain water. A friend suggested adding lemon juice, and the quest for the perfect lemon juice began. After searching high and low, trying brand after brand of lemon juice, I can honestly say that Dream Foods International is the best. It's second only to making the juice yourself from fresh lemons. The flavor is really intense, so you don't need alot, and it doesn't make your water cloudy or discolored like other lemon juices do. And the taste is super refreshing and very lemony. I also love that it comes in a little bottle, so I can throw it in my purse and have it on hand at all times. I will never be without this lemon juice...it's my one true lemony love.<br /><br />P.S. The lime juice is also delicious.

review/summary: Good product but avoid Subscribe and Save
review/text: It's difficult to review a product when you'd like to praise the actual product but have objections to some aspect of Amazon's sale of it. One perennial problem with Subscribe and Save grocery items is that you have no way of knowing what the item's expiration date is. In this instance, I ordered a case of Lemon Burst (package of 12) and anticipated that I would have enough for 9 months to a year. This is a potent product and you need to add only a small amount to produce a strong and vital lemon flavor. Unless you're making food for a restaurant, it's hard to imagine that anyone would use enough of this product to use up a pack of 12 in less time than that. If I'm wrong about this, and you're one of those who do use enormous amounts of lemon flavoring, this part of the review will not apply to you. For the rest of you, here is my experience. I ordered the package of 12 in mid-May of 2012. The expiration date on the individual containers is mid-October 2012, giving me less than 6 months in which to use up the 12 containers. If I'd known this, I would not have ordered, since I couldn't possibly use that amount in less than six months. I've had the same issue on occasion (and seen it commented on by others) with grocery items in bulk, such as mayonnaise, where the product was close to the expiration date when it arrived. I suppose there are people who could use six large jars of mayo in a month or so, but if you are not one of them, beware ordering time-sensitive products through Subscribe and Save. In any event, the vendor should be required to state the expiration date so that the buyer has the needed information to decide for himself or herself whether to order.<br /><br />I've used this product for some time, long before I bought it from Amazon, and have used it in everything where you might possibly use lemon juice (including a squirt in iced tea). It's pure lemon juice and oil of lemon, unadulterated in any way, and has a potent true lemon flavor. I believe I've tried every such product on the market, and this is by far the best; it exists in an entirely different universe from *Real*Lemon, nor should it be confused with supermarket lemon juices that come in a similar container but bear no resemblance whatsoever to this pure and natural product. If you're uncertain about buying large quantities of a product you may not have tried before, this item is usually easily found in health food stores and co-ops, where you can buy a single one and give it a try. As there are also some reports of allergic reactions to lemon juice due to factors that might not be disclosed on this site, it's always good to look at the actual ingredient list printed on the product.
