review/summary: Youl'll bunny hop for joy!
review/text: You will bunny hop for joy when the Fedex man delivers your whole fresh rabbit! He was so meticulously wrapped and engagingly charming. I promptly named him Juan, for that sly, sexy look that he gave me, or would have given me had he had a head.  I took him lovingly into my arms a the heat that built between us was too much! Alas, he burst into flames and I let him slow roast for about an hour and served him on a bed of wild rice with a side dish of glazed carrots.

review/summary: Looks fairly lifelike, but fails to function as a rabbit
review/text: When i received my rabbit, i was impressed at the likeness to a real rabbit, but after closer inspection was disappointed with the lack of features. First of all, the 2 AA batteries were not included, and considering the price i payed for my rabbit i would have expected a pair. The mobility options are very limited, being able to move only by holding the rabbit and moving it around in a rabbit-like manner. The noise capabilities are non-existent, no sound was heard even after poking quite hard.<br /><br />All in all i was not impressed with this fresh whole rabbit, in the end all i could do with it was cook it and eat it.

review/summary: broken!
review/text: I think I must have ordered the wrong rabbit. The rabbit I supposedly ordered came with pearls. I looked all over for the battery compartment and only found one slot that would fit C batteries. Well, the rabbit never turned on and I couldn't get my batteries back out of the compartment without using extra lube. To make matters worse, judging by the smell of the rabbit, I think it's already been used. I have to say I'm disappointed in this product and I will be exchanging it at the Adult Megaplex for a new one.

review/summary: Nature's Candy
review/text: Ted Nugent turned me on to this years ago.  We were having roast marmoset with duck-stuffed hog, when he brought out this tasty treat.  Sun-dried and salt-cured, it makes the absolute quintessential backpack snack for those long excursions when one needs to hide in the forest for extended periods of time.  The bonus in all of this is that there is absolutely no buckshot to pick out of the meat, which makes it a huge time saver!  I think they would probably do well to include the tail and maybe the entire pelt as an extra bonus treat, in case one of the kids wants a really cool hat to show off at school.  All in all, it beats having to trap or shoot), kill and skin your own rabbit, unless you're into that sort of thing.  Or if you're Elmer Fudd.

review/summary: Wish I'd found this before!
review/text: Back in December, the men from the Baptist church I attend got up stupidly early to go hunting.  They brought back their catch (4 rabbits and squirrels) for the ladies of the church to skin and cook over an open fire.  The ladies carried wood from the nearby woods, skinned the unfortunate rodents with their bare hands and we waited three hours for the meat to cook.  Because everyone who attends the church was invited to eat at the church, and 4 small critters don't feed many people, a lot of people left the church sad and hungry.  Now that I know about ordering meat from Amazon.com, our problems are solved!  The men can sleep in, the ladies are saved the effort of removing fur and entrails and there will be enough food for everyone!  Awesome!

review/summary: Too much blood
review/text: I've been a rabbit eater for most of my life, used to shoot my own but as I get older, I've been ordering online. When this arrived, I was quite excited to get my slow cooker going and have a great stew, however when I opened the package, there was at least 8 cups of blood and intestinal type matter with the carcass. I went ahead and cleaned it up and everything worked fine but I cannot recommend this product as it's a pain to clean the body up before cooking, my preference is out of the bag straight to crock pot without having to deal with blood and guts....guess this is what happens with age.

review/summary: Where's the head?
review/text: You reckon when the ad says "whole rabbit" you ought get the whole rabbit. I ain't got a head on this critter! My neighbor kids sure love playin with them rabbit heads. If I ain't got a rabbit head fer makin peace with them neighbor kids they prolly gonna come bust up my old ridin tractor. Without my tractor I can't even get up the corner store for no beer. Another thing is I ain't even got any intestines fer sausage makin! How is Easter dinner gonna be any good with no varmint sausages? This thing looks like it coulda been a guinea pig or a chinchilla or somethin. I mean, it tasted pretty damn good with hot sauce, but I reckon I oughta shot my own critter next time around. That or scrape one up off the main road, sure is cheaper. Least they left some bones in there for my ol coonhound to chaw awhile. Mavis gives it four stars but I'm only givin it two on account of no head or nothin to make sausages with. Reckon also if you ain't familiar with rabbit don't be expectin to feed no three grown men on one, ain't enough eatin on em.

review/summary: The dead Rabbit that saved a life.
review/text: The wilds of Kamchatka are a brutal, harsh landscape filled with death and despair where only polar bears and monsters born out of the nightmares of children roam. I had once thought of Kamchatka only as a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000IWCX">Risk</a>y way to get my armies to Japan, Alaska, Mongolia, Yakutsk and Irkutsk. Now, however, I knew differently. You see, the ghost of my dead wife explained to me through my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CT2A6I">Diamond HDMI Digital Audio/Video Cable W/ Ethernet Connection (5M)</a> to pack up nothing and track the No-armed man to the wilds of Kamchatka. I did so, and found I was woefully ill-prepared for our encounter. If only I had <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9622177808">Kamachatka: A Journal & Guide to Russia's Land of Ice and Fire (Odyssey Illustrated Guides)</a>, I would have been better prepared for all the ice and fire. Instead, all my training in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WVXM0W">Zubaz Pants</a> with Master Goh did nothing but keep me alive. After the No-armed man finished beating me to a pulp and escaped my grasp I found myself starving.<br />I trundled through the insane weather conditions, alternating between snow and burning forests and came across a strange site. There, rising out of the snow and flames, like an apparition, was a massive building. On the front it read "Cloverdale." I thought of the monster with a similar name, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018QCXGY">Cloverfield [Blu-ray</a>], and how that movie would play a crucial role in this theater of pain I was trapped in. But it was at Cloverdale that an old woman, nearly 80 years old if a day, walked out wearing a headscarf and leading a Yak that was strapped with bundles of polar bear skins, and spoke to me. What language it was that poured out of her broken toothed mouth I could not say, but the intent was clear. "Eat this fresh whole rabbit," her eyes explained to me what her language could not. She picked me up and placed me on the back of the yak with the polar bear skins. I would live. My vengeance would keep me warm. My vengeance and all those polar bear skins. And I would find my strength in all those fresh whole rabbits. Strength for my next encounter with the No-armed man.

review/summary: WARNING - Contains DRM!
review/text: The manufacturer of this innocuous looking animal has seen fit to hide a rather disgusting form of DRM in it without disclosing this fact to us paying customers.  I purchased this rabbit for my daughter, as I thought it would be nice for her to have a more realistic toy than her current stuffed teddy bears and dolls.  To my astonishment, it began to smell very bad after only a few hours, and eventually degraded into a hard, wrinkly lump of brittle rabbit flesh.  Totally unsuitable for cuddling.  It is obvious that the manufacturer expects you to then buy another to replace it.  Well not this guy!  Once I have been burned I do not return to the flame for more.  I will not be purchasing another Cloverdale whole animal, and I suggest that none of you do either.  If we continue to accept these practices, things will only become worse!  What's next, Cloverdale?  Bears with claws?<br /><br />*EDIT*  It has come to my attention that this animal is intended to be either frozen or consumed immediately at time of receipt.  I believe Amazon should be more thorough in their descriptions of products such as this!  I do not think it is unreasonable to assume that people will be buying this animal for reasons other than consumption.  Until Amazon changes their description, I will stand by my 1 star rating!

review/summary: The Coming Rabbit Crisis
review/text: I am shocked that Amazon would conspire in rabbit slaughter and their consumption by the public.  Rabbits are cute and furry.  They are the most popular pet in Baluchistan and parts of Vanuatu.  Many people have expressed their desire to marry rabbits, and the 9th Circuit will soon affirm our Constitutional right to realize that desire.  Many rabbits are wealthy and productive members of society.  Rabbits invented the steam engine, the toaster oven, the pneumatic bolt gun, and Spandex.  Rabbits pay 27% of all U.S. income taxes. This fall, for the first time, rabbits make up the majority of incoming freshman at Miami University of Ohio.<br />Since they received the right to vote in 1979, rabbits have been reliable supporters of the Whig party, which is the only thing standing between the world and utter chaos.  Last March, while the rest of us were cowering in basements and bomb shelters, rabbits were defending Earth against the Venusian invasion.<br />Of course the rabbits have begun to fight back against our heartless exploitation.  Roving bands of rogue rabbits have remained armed since their defeat of the Venusians, and `wilding' by rabbit gangs has made New York's Central Park unsafe at all hours of day and night.  A radical Whig splinter group, led by the mysterious rabbit who calls himself Lucky Lepus, has even been calling for armed revolt in pursuit of a separate, nuclear, Rabbit Republic.<br />If we know what's good for us, we will put down the butcher's knife and make peaceful accommodation with the rabbits while it is still possible.  Amazon, for the love of God, stop selling this product before the rabbits come for us all.

review/summary: University of Victoria Rabbit Cull
review/text: This rabbit product is very good, if you like hassenpfeffer.  I would rate it 5 (instead of 4) if it were not so high priced and expensive to ship.  Also, I had hoped to be able to use the fur to tie salmon flies -- oh well.  However, I have discovered why this whole rabbit product is so expensive: These rabbits are imported from Canada!<br />  The University of Victoria, in Victoria BC, has had a feral rabbit problem for years.  Recently, they have got a lot of press because of their intentions to thin the herd (Check numerous articles in the Victoria Times-Colonist, summer to fall, 2010.)  This has met with significant public resistance; plans to trap, neuter and re-release the rabbits have not gone far, either, partly because cost estimates run to $227/snip. And there are literally hundreds of the little buggers.<br />  Using my Automatic Game & Wildlife Camera, with infrared attachment (very good on deer, BTW.  I review it elsewhere,) I have documented photos of black-clad meat company representatives (I think of them as rabbit Ninjas) "harvesting" sacks full of bunnies on moonless nights.  They place these sacks into a black van (with US licence plates!!) and catch the ferry back south to Washington State.<br />  This is a pretty reprehensible business plan (although, as a starving student, I must confess to doing it as an amateur; it beats road-kill.)<br />The only good thing I can say is, their diet is good, healthful and natural; and they are free of hormone and antibiotic additives.

review/summary: Whole rabbits save the day
review/text: The fresh whole rabbits were an amazing addition to my Civil War battle recreations.  Complete with authentic Civil War-era fabric and little Army hats, General Hop Jump an Colonial Fuzzy Ears were particularly vigorous participants as they reenacted the Battle of Bull Run.  General Hop Jump led the Northern troops directly into the line of fire and came out victorious!  Colonial Fuzzy Ears, not to be outdone, soon took the stronghold of a South Carolina beach fort by leading his men, many no more than 18 years old, right to the front gates.  They were thwarted masterfully by Admiral Chompers, but Colonial Fuzzy Ears had won the bottle of will and mutual admiration.  Admiral Chompers then proceeded to eat his Civil War side burns made of fine great and white thread that had come unhinged of it's scotch tape backing.  The war came to a crashing halt when General Long Back Legs marched his brigade through the fields of Georgia, and my side yard, and burned every living thing until the South finally waved the white flag.  The fresh whole rabbits will take on new challenges such as The Battle of the Bulge and the War of 1812 where Wascally Wabbit will play the part of Napoleon complete with fine admiral blue attire, that funny little sideways hat, the arm and paw tucked into jacket, and all the trimmings.

And when it arrived, thank you Amazon for fast delivery, I clapped, danced, cut cart wheels, and shouted with joy at the top of my lungs. And as soon I as got into the house, I called my cousin, Roger, and let him know that this rabbit didn't get away! You see, 40 years ago, my brother and two other cousins where in the back yard trying to catch a rabbit. Roger was no help, as he stood on the sidelines and watched. Then he smugly quipped, "What's wrong, can't you catch it before it mul...ti...plies". Finally, I have the last laugh on him, I have my rabbit.

review/summary: Utterly Remarkable!!!
review/text: For the past three hundred and fifty one years I have been completely, totally, utterly, unequivocally insane. And not just any insane, but the kind of turbo charged crazy that you wouldn't want anywhere near your daughter or your monkey if you've got one. It seemed nothing would help. I was doomed to live a life of madness, sitting alone in the dark eating somewhat slightly rancid deer meat while watching Batman Beyond over and over again in my mind's eye.<br />  Not to worry though!!! Stop being so concerned for me! My story has an awesome ending! Last Thursday, while I was trying desperately to do nude hand stands in my basement, I was visited by OMNIPOTENT MOON BEINGS (you know that part's important for you to read, cause I used the CAPS LOCK to make it extra special) and they suggested that I eat a Fresh Whole Rabbit. I had my doubts, obviously, but I figured that OMNIPOTENT MOON BEINGS wouldn't intentionally lie to me and so I leapt like a battle hardened war panther onto a computer terminal and ordered one. Needless to say, it was a life changing experience. The Fresh Whole Rabbit was indeed a veritable cornucopia of utopian delights. It cured me of my madness. I now command a handsome salary at a prestigious place that you've probably never heard of, and I'm dating a girl who likes to have SEX!!!! It is no joke. This product will change reality for you as you know it forever!!!!!

review/summary: Watch out for protein poisoning
review/text: I understand that most of the reviews are fake and I would like to say that while I find them all very enjoyable and humorous, there is a something that a real customer of this product feels should be known.<br /><br />I purchased 10 of the rabbits for the purpose of making hare jerky (a tasty treat) when I was overcome with the desire to indulge in a bit of rabbit meat before the smoking process. Giving into my guilty urges, I took one rabbit for my own personal pre-jerky consumption and proceeded to eat the entire animal whole (I do not own a stove, only a plastic box and some firewood for smoking things, hence it was uncooked). After my little personal rabbit fiesta, I laid down to digest the food.<br /><br />This was a mistake. Within two hours, I had never felt worse. I used the trusty search engine "Bing" to do some armchair medical research while clutching a trashcan in the most horrendous gastric distress you can imagine (I do not have health insurance so I did not call the hospital). Quickly, I found out that a side effect to eating rabbit was "protein poisoning," a situation that arises when lean meat is eaten. It is also known as "rabbit starvation" because rabbit meat contains almost no fat whatsoever. Apparently, consumption of large amounts of protein with little or no carbohydrates or fat is dangerous. Well you imagine how much that tickled me angry. All ready to write an angry letter of protest to the rabbit meat industry about their marketing of a dangerous foodstuff, I stumbled to my writing desk but alas, I only made it 3 feet before collapsing in pain. The next 5 hours were like a blur as I lay on the floor writhing in my own waste seeing people and things from the past and quite possibly the future. I have experimented with drugs back in the day and let me tell you, nothing came as close to disconnecting me from the universe in the worst way possible, as this. No one ever wants to experience protein poisoning, I promise you.<br /><br />At about 10 in the evening I came to and used a chair and the wall to help pull myself off of the floor. I still felt sick and I went back to my computer to see if there was a cure. Suddenly it hit me, I needed to eat other macronutrients! I remembered the tub of lard I had been saving in the fridge and stumbled across my apartment. The pain only grew worse. I remembered reading that bodybuilders eat lots of protein. I have no idea how they do it. It must be horrible for them. My vegan friend has always said that anything over 20 grams of a protein a day is overkill and I'm inclined to believe him now. He is the healthiest person I know, he is very skinny but he doesn't have visible muscle (which he says is the result of toxins and not enough body fat to properly survive). I finally reached my fridge and reached in for the I Can't Believe It's Not Butter container with my stockpiled lard. I quickly shoveled it into my mouth and wouldn't you believe it but it only made me feel worse! I passed out again, the cold air of the fridge blowing onto me.<br /><br />I awoke three days later (according to my watch) at 7 at night. The fridge had apparently preserved my body as it fought the proteins for the first night but now my electricity was off because my bill was due yesterday. It didn't matter, my body had apparently started to win the fight around 2 nights ago and now I am pretty much back to normal. However, I SINCERELY DO NOT RECOMMEND RABBIT MEAT as it can potentially kill you, as it nearly did me.<br /><br />Five stars - 1 for nearly killing me - 1 slightly chewy - 1 no head + 1 made great jerky = 3 stars

review/summary: Thumper Rabbit RIP
review/text: **Former Child Star Thumper Meets Tragic End**<br /><br />The mystery of the disappearance of Thumper, on par with that of Judge Crater and Jimmy Hoffa, came to a shocking end yesterday when a gory photograph of the famous actor was posted on the Amazon web site.<br /><br />Clues in the photograph, showing Thumper's headless and trussed body, led California Private Investigator, Edward "Eddie" Valiant to the Cloverdale processing plant where Thumper's long and fabled life had evidently ended.<br /><br />"Who would do such a dastardly thing to my uncle?"  sobbed  family spokesman Roger Rabbit, who is Thumper's nephew and also a known Hollywood actor, at the mobbed press conference held hours after the gristly discovery. "If I hadn't hired Eddie Valiant to get the job done, the cops would still have their heads down a rabbit hole!" and "Where the %@*& is my uncle's head?"<br /><br />Born Oscar Q Rabbit to a theatrical family of animated characters specializing in animal roles, Rabbit was hired by the Disney Studios when just a tiny bunny. Nicknamed "Thumper" for an endearing but nervous twitch of the left hind foot, he eventually became known throughout the world by that single name, joining the exclusive rank of one named stars such as Cher, Madonna and Pele.<br /><br />Cast as a child character in a small supporting role in the movie Bambi in 1942, Thumper's adorable and enduring persona lit the screen with a charisma way beyond that of a humble sidekick.<br /><br />A memorable line in Bambi became the touchstone of Thumper's life. "If you can't say something nice, don't say nothing at all!" formed the basis of what is now known as "The Thumperian Principle" . Grown to a world movement, Thumperian disciples believe in the tenant that bad grammar and good deeds are cosmically linked.<br /><br />Thumper continued work at the Disney Studios with Thumper2 and Thumper Goes Exploring but was eventually released from his contract when as a young adult, despite desperate efforts, he could not control the twitch in his hind leg. Rumors of drug abuse were never proven although Thumper spent several months at a private hospital for reported exhaustion  after completing the filming Thumper Goes Exploring.<br /><br />Never making the transition to television as did his younger relatives, Crusader Rabbit and Bugs Bunny, Thumper's career floundered until he was reduced to starring in three rabbitsploitation movies, "Suck My Carrot", "Young Bunny Coed Love", and finally, "The Bunny Hole".<br /><br />A long time alcoholic and well known visitor to the watering holes along the Sunset Strip and Las Vegas, Thumper lent his name to what has become a popular drinking game.<br /><br />Thumper spent his final years prior to his disappearance making celebrity appearances at Bambi reunions and Thumperian conferences and spent two seasons on Hollywood Squares where the muffled thumping of his hind led could often be heard in the background.<br /><br />Thumper was the founder and president of the "Shake A Leg Foundation" a research and charitable organization for rabbits and other small mammals suffering from hind leg movement disorder. Contributions to the foundation can be made in his name.<br /><br />Thumper is survived by his older brother, Benjamin Bunny, his nephew, Roger Rabbit, and his fourth wife, Jessica Rabbit and 974 children.

review/summary: Rabbit: the finer meat
review/text: Cokadoodledoo! amazing, incredible...THANK YOU AMAZON! it has been approximately a year and seventy two days since I had rabbit and I gotta tell ya, there is no sweeter meat. For so long myself and the rest of my two-bit gang would hunt Appalachian Cottontails in the mountain foothills in east TN. Trappin' and snarin' will catch some plump ones and for the experience ol' stew and I would sometimes bite the bullet and eat those suckers raw before a good hit on that grubby corn cob pipe. Vulturin' never was better! Everything changed though when the folks shipped me up north and where I am now there ain't nothing! I aint seen a hare since i've been in this dadgum city-suburban town and with all this business going well, I thought I'd never get out of here to taste rabbit again...until now. Now between my dog washin job, my moonshinin' on the side, and now THIS, its practically back to the old days! Fresh Whole Rabbit* product from amazon is bliss...

review/summary: Snowmobile Fresh
review/text: I'd first like to thank Gov. Palin for introducing me to this tasty treat.  The FWR (fresh whole rabbit) was the perfect late night snack at the end of a perfect evening spent with the 'Dinosaurs Aint Real' discussion group in Juno.  I'd also like to thank her for defining snowmobile fresh - "in order to receive this label, the critter has to be path-whacked by a Skiddoo, immediately placed in a bucket of snow, and delivered to Joe Butcher in no less than thirty minutes ... for 'de-skinning'"  I don't, on the other hand, think she was right when she told me fresh was nasty-kinky.  FYI - I have not been able to find nasty-kinky whole rabbit on amazon but I did find it on a few other sites.<br /><br />And here's where I must confess that things got a bit out of hand.  After the tasty FWR at Dinosaurs Aint Real, I started attendig similar meetings in search of FWRs.  I was mostly disappointed, but I did get a serving at Better Sex Through Prayer.  Unsatisfied, I placed my first order at Amazon for a half dozen.  I promptly ate these in five days and was kicked into an FWR binge that lasted two and a half months.  Seventy-three FWRs later and a positvive drug test that required an ice trucker's union hearing, I realized things were out of control and went cold turkey.  I can only thank the good people at Pickled Rat Torsos for their help in swapping out of my FRW addiction.<br /><br />This is a great product.  Just be aware of the addictive nature of partaking.  Thus my reason for four and not five stars.

review/summary: Sweet clean taste, very pretty flower
review/text: My 12-year old daughter and I have just found tea flowers, and wanted to try a tea that wasn't heavy with black tea leaves.  This tea is very refreshing and lovely tasting.  The strawberry flavor is truly delicious without being overpowering.  We did use some honey to sweeten it a bit, but the second cup I drank was unsweetened, and it was nice too.  The flower opened up nicely and was attractive, which is important when you buy tea flowers, as the visual is part of the ceremony.  I would buy this tea flower again, and will.  I recommend this as an afternoon tea with cookies or a morning tea with a light breakfast.  It won't be strong enough to stand against a heavy meal. It is also good as just a tea without a side at all.

It turns out that buying this online is about half the price of retail, so I win both ways (price & availability). I do not add sugar, milk or anything else to this tea. It is wonderful all by itself. However, just one bit of advice: Do NOT remove the bag after brewing. The tea is so mild, that I leave it in the cup the whole time I am drinking the tea.

Great for travel. Just stash some tea bags in your purse or pocket and if you have access to hot water you can have tea in an instant. I make this tea at work, too. Actually, I drink it all day long and never tire of the fresh berry taste.

It's the only herbal tea I've found that is naturally sweet so you don't have to add sugar or sweeteners. The aroma is heavenly and as an added bonus, it acts as an appetite suppressant (at least for me) because when you're inhaling that scent your palate doesn't crave anything else. Great as an after-dinner/before-bed drink.

review/text: If you love black licorice and and would like something that also has great health benefits, you'll love this tea.  I brew this tea and drink hot, but even when it gets cold, its still great.  I often just add more cold water to it and get a very mild licorice taste that is better than just strait water.  I will do this several times until I just want more of the licorice taste, and brew some more tea.  As to the health benefits, there are many.  Here are just a few: "useful for many ailments including asthma, body odor, bursitis, canker sores, chronic fatigue, depression, colds and flu, coughs, gingivitis and tooth decay, gout, heartburn, HIV, viral infections, fungal infections, ulcers, liver problems, Lyme disease, menopause, psoriasis, shingles, sore throat, tendinitis, tuberculosis, ulcers, yeast infections, prostate enlargement and arthritis."  See [...] and click on the link licorice.  That is where this health info came from, but there is much much more info there on that web site too.  It's said to be very good for flu and colds, which I'm fighting now, and it's so very SOOTHING to my throat!  You'll love this tea.

review/summary: A loyal drinker (!) for years
review/text: Simply stated, I've been drinking this specific tea for several years now after an experiment went (happily) well.  Some friends have found it to be too sweet, but they needed to be corrected in that no sugar is required (because they inadvertently added some).  The tea provides more than enough natural sweetness of its own with no aftertaste (albeit a pleasant one, if it turns out that you're a little ill and therefore a trifle phlegmy... there, I said it).<br /><br />It mixes exceptionally well with green tea, though I've found not so much with certain black teas like Irish Breakfast -in which case I'd recommend avoid adding milk if you're normally inclined to do so with any kind of black tea.  It is decaffeinated, so this is a perfect "unwinding" drink before bedtime.  Not "spicy" in the classic sense at all, either.  I thoroughly and highly recommend this variety of Stash tea.

review/text: I love the taste of this tea. It tastes exactly like licorice root and it's very refreshing. I like to make iced tea with it. However, I just read a review someone made on another licorice tea product on amazon, telling their story of licorice toxicity. I'm a fairly paranoid person, so I'm now only going to enjoy this tea about twice a week, instead of everyday like I was doing. I canceled my subscribe & save order because I don't think I can safely use up 6 boxes within the time I selected. I might be overreacting, I probably am, but better safe than sorry.

She still made me a cup and I was stunned.  This is the best tea EVER!  I stopped drinking coffee during the winter and drank this tea all day long.  The students in my class noticed my new love of this tea and bought me a package as a gift.  The flavor is fabulous and I really like the fact that I do not need to add any sweetener at all.  The aftertaste is so interesting.  I have never had anything like it.<br /><br />I prepared this as a cold tea this summer, but it just didn't taste the same.  I will stick with it as a hot tea only.  Did I mention that I love it?

review/summary: Love this when I'm sick
review/text: This tea is super gingery, and lemony, and I just love it with honey when I'm sick. Love it. My local grocery is out, so here I am on Amazon, buying more.<br /><br />Note that the primary source of "lemon" appears to be lemongrass. (Ingredients, via the product packaging: "Ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, and citric acid. Contains: Soy." I don't understand "Contains: Soy", but it's not listed on the ingredients... I wonder if this is an allergy alert thing.)<br /><br />Looking at the ingredients, the organic version has caffeine and doesn't have any actual lemon in it... I haven't tried that one yet, though. I'm a fan of both green tea and organic products, but I don't want caffeine when I'm sick, so I'll stick with this.

review/text: Those of you who love black licorice or anise flavor - this is it! This tea is so flavorful and aromatic, it's intense. In my opinion, the addition of sweetener is not necessary! Good for your daily diet but remember this is not a wimpy tea, it's full bodied. And great for your digestive system. Love, Love, Love this tea :)

review/summary: Really Great Tea
review/text: A friend introduced me to Licorice Tea many years ago by asking for a cup at a restuarant. When the server stated that the restuarant did not have Licorice tea, she took a packette out of her handbag and asked for a cup of hot water. She had an extra packette for me to try. WOW, interesting taste, not bitter and no need for sweetner. Stash makes the most robust decafinated tea. Until a short while ago, I was able to puchase the 20 count box of Stash Premium Licorice Spice Herbal Tea at the local grocery, but Licorice Spice is no longer on the shelf. I placed my order for the Pack of 6 to save on shipping and should now have sufficient tea bags for several months. Individually, foil wrapped tea bags keeps the flavor fresh.

review/text: If you aren't familiar with the taste, I can only suggest you try it before you end up with 6 boxes of the stuff.  But if you are a committed lover of this tea, then Amazon's Subscribe and Save is REALLY a great deal!  Definitely not for people who do not like the taste of black licorice.  I personally steep the tea for longer than advised on the package but I like my teas strong (package says 3-5 minutes, I go for 10).  I have turned some of my licorice loving friends onto it - 1 is a diabetic and she LOVES it since it gives a really sweet flavor with NO sugar or carbohydrates.  It is wonderful on a cold evening and won't keep you awake as there is NO caffeine.

review/text: I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this tea! I don't even like licorice, my friend encouraged me to taste it, as she was so pleased with it. I did not realize (as the packaging box states) that herbal teas contain no true tea leaves, but are created from an international collection of herbs and spices such as licorice, cinnamon, orange peel, star anise and sarsaparilla. It is a perfect after dinner tea. I live in Michigan and those wintery nights are good for a cup of this caffeine free tea.

review/summary: I like this tea!
review/text: Well, what's to be said other than I really like this Licorice Spice Tea?<br /><br />I cut out sugar and reduced my caffeine intake over the last year or so and this licorice tea is my favorite replacement for a caffeinated hot drink. Because I have a sweet tooth I usually now drink tea and coffee with soy milk to reduce the bitterness. This licorice spice tea is delicious and I drink it equally happily both with and without soy milk (the licorice gives it a natural sweet flavor). I have at least one or two cups a day, and even if I was to return to my previous high regime of caffeination I would still include a cup or two of this tea during the day.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of chamomile and this Licorice spice tea does not seem to list that as an ingredient.<br /><br />It seems many people don't like the flavor of licorice, but those that do really like this tea.<br /><br />I've found that the flavor of each batch seems to vary in intensity and the last batch I bought had a less strong taste which simply means it needs to be steeped a little longer.<br /><br />Scratching around for other things to say, my only concern about Stash teas is what appears to be plastic coated aluminum sashes that the teabags are sealed in. That does a great job in terms of sealing in flavor, but I'd rather it wasn't either plastic or aluminum coated. Maybe there's no good alternative.<br /><br />The only other thing is that the latest boxes have changed the design of the semi-circular hole at the bottom of the box and the new design makes it near impossible to easily remove a sachet. You'll be attacking it with the scissors or opening the box lid to get them out.<br /><br />But what really matters is the flavor and this is simply the best!

review/summary: Hands down my favorite tea!
review/text: I've been "addicted" to this tea for years and glad that it has become more widely available.<br /><br />A few weeks ago my cousin and I were discussing our love of tea.  I put forth Licorice Spice as my favorite and she said her all time favorite was, surprisingly enough, a tea made by Aveda - the haircare company - called Comforting Tea.  She lamented that she found it hard to find and described the taste to me.  I immediately told her that she had to try Licorice Spice then.  A few days after my recommendation she emailed me that she had tried the Stash tea and it was EVEN BETTER than the Aveda one!  I so do love making converts!<br /><br />As an added bonus, I've discovered after many nights of letting the tea steep, forgetting about the cup I've made, but not wanting to waste the tea bag - it tastes really good cold too!

I used up almost the entire box of tea bags to make a pitcher full of iced tea, and it was still pretty weak in flavor.  When I've made hot tea with it, I need two tea bags.<br /><br />The flavor is ok--I love the tartness of hibiscus and the raspberry--but it's really just too weak overall.  Will not purchase again.

I called Stash to find out if the soy was GMO, and...the woman in customer service guarenteed me the suppliers sell them non-GMO soy. If this is the case, they really should label it as such. I like the flavor though, it's very soothing and gentle on the tummy (hence the three stars). The only way I will order again is if they start labeling the soy as non-GMO, i can't trust the product without a label!<br /><br />PS: after reading ingredient list again, I found NO mention of soy...

review/summary: Try this for Sore Throat or to Wind Down!!!
review/text: First of all, I am a tea drinker.  I have been drinking tea all my 60 years of life and I LOVE tea.  Stash is a wonderful tea and they have a tremendous line of delicious flavors out there right now. Stash chamomile is caffeine free.<br /><br />Now, let me share one of Kathy W's secrets with you. (S-h-h-h-h-h...) Chamomile tea is EXCELLENT for sore throats, scratchy throats, any throat irritation.  I first learned about Chamomile tea from my Greek neighbors. YaYa and PaPu always gave the grandchildren Chamomile tea whenever they got sick.  It not only is very soothing but it somehow soothes throat irritations.  Over the years, I have found that if I get a sore throat, I drink 2 cups of chamomile tea, one behind the other, and my throat STOPS hurting.  If it starts again the next day, I repeat the procedure, and it stops again.<br /><br />I rarely get sick now-a-days, and if I get a bug, it passes through and out real quick, but I have turned many a friend and co-worker on to my little secret.  It works!  Chamomile brews/steeps as a yellow tea and it has a different taste than black tea.  So, if the taste is strange to you initially, you will probably get used to it quickly.  I assure you, it beats the heck out of having a sore throat.  For a sore throat, you can also add honey if you want.  Honey makes it even more smooth and soothing.<br /><br />Some people also like a cup of chamomile tea before bedtime because it is soothing and helps them wind down.<br /><br />So, when you use this for a sore throat, and you realize it helped you or your children, do me a favor.  Look up to heaven and say Thank You to YaYa and PaPu Harjandrou for sharing this special secret with all of us.<br /><br />God Bless you all.<br /><br />(Note: I am not a doctor.)

review/summary: It is not real Acai
review/text: I am dissapointed!! When I bought this product I thought I was buying the real Acai Tea. But when I read ingredients it occured that Acai is the only one of the ingredients from a lot of others. So I blamed myself because I had to read those ingredients before I bought this Tea. I was fooled because the tea is named as "Acai Tea" so I thought it really was Acai. I reccomend everybody to read ingredients carefully before buying the product.

review/summary: there are affordable teabags and there are affordable teabags
review/text: nothing comes realatively cheap these days and still get the satisfaction.  I love stash tea, as it presents both good value (via amazon) and offers a little luxury amongst its peers.  There are more expensive brands, but as a brand, this one cuts about the rest.  I love the chamomile version and it is a sure winner in the taste section too. Highly recommend and thanks amazon for making it so affordable.

review/summary: Locorice is hidden ingredient in Stash Teas
review/text: Locorice even in small amounts raises my blood pressure to dangerous levels. My doctor began to have problems regulating my high blood pressure soon after beginning to drink Stash teas, which (almost all) I discovered contain licorice.<br /><br />I recommend either that Stash remove licorice from their teas or they carry a warning label for persons with high blood pressure be aware.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I thought for sure I was going to love this tea. I love licorice and I like my teas sweet. I was so disappointed in the flavor of this product! It has very little licorice taste and an almost sickening after taste and smell. I added sugar to it as I did not find it very sweet. I ordered the 6 box pack of this so I guess I have 5 boxes of it to give away

review/summary: Licorice Lovers--You must check this out!
review/text: Those of you who love licorice or anise flavor and who happen to be tea-drinkers, rejoice! This tea is so flavorful and aromatic. The anise/licorice flavor is intense. The tea is relatively sweet, so in my opinion, the addition of sweetener is not necessary, but you may want to add a little honey to it. This is not a wimpy tea, but full bodied and the longer you steep it, the stronger it gets.

review/summary: Delicious and soothing
review/text: I first tried this tea 4 years ago when a friend introduced it to me at work.  I was able to buy it at Trader Joes but they discontinued stocking it in my local store about a year ago.  I then found this online directly from Stash and bought boxes at a time.  I am a person who finds it hard to drink water but this herb tea helps me drink up to 10 huge mugs of it a day. Lemon and ginger combination is perfect to satisfy the need for sweet with a little bite at the end with the ginger. It has also helped me stop drinking caffeine drinks which lets me now sleep at night.  I will continue to buy this and recommend it highly.

review/summary: Tried it...loved it...now my favorite herbal tea
review/text: Based on the other review, I went and tried this tea.  As a choir member, I am always interested in licorice products since they soothe a worn voice.  However, many of the teas I have tried have too much ginger in it.  I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this tea.<br /><br />1) The licorice taste is subtle, but definitely present.<br /><br />2) No sugar necessary.  As a dentist, I love this.  The licorice flavor doesn't jump out at you at first, but around 4 or 5 seconds after swallowing, the licorice "dances" around the sides of your tongue.  I don't know how else to describe it, but it really does dance.  I've never had that before.  Brilliant!<br /><br />3) It's best when over-steeped - like 10 minutes.<br /><br />4) Most grocery stores I've been to carry this, so it's readily available should you find yourself staring at an empty box early in the evening.

review/summary: Good tea except for one thing...
review/text: It is a pretty good tea except they have licorice in it -- even in small amounts it is not appealing to me.<br />Raises some people's blood pressure, too, so it would be good to know this before purchasing.<br /><br />I liked it except for the licorice flavor.

review/summary: Basic Lemon Ginger Herbal Tea
review/text: ***<br />Stash's Lemon Ginger Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is a basic lemon ginger tea, tasting strongly of ginger, and full of flavorings, and oddly, even contains soy. This is one of the better commercial highly processed, non-organic teas. I much prefer organic teas that are made without artificial flavorings and certainly without soy, but if you are not picky about herb teas, and are looking something very strongly flavored as an introduction to the world of teasans and decaffeinated beverages, this would be fine. If you like your tea more subtle, with true pure tastes, and can discern complex differences between natural and commercial teas, then this definitely is not for you, and I would recommend any Numi tea, Yogi Tea, Traditional Medicinals, or even Stash's organic line of teas (which comes in a wonderful Lemon Ginger Organic Tea!)<br /><br />Stash Lemon Ginger Tea contains ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, citric acid, and soy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, nothing special.<br />***

review/summary: This Tea is a Must Try
review/text: The flavors of this tea are spicy, rich and complex, but nothing stands out too strong screaming "this spice is overwhelming."  When preparing ensure your water is sufficently heated and that you streep the tea for a minimum of 5-10 minutes.

review/summary: Rather weak and non-descript tea
review/text: There are several other Stash teas that I've tried and enjoyed. But this one is sort of feeble-tasting.  Up until now, I've gotten the Yogi Tea Egyptian Licorice <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F3QL6">Yogi Tea Organic Egyptian Licorice, Tea Bags, 16-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>and that one actually has a bold licorice taste.  And it is that one that is serving as the point of comparison to this Stash tea.  Keep in mind that I don't add honey or any sweetner to my teas, so they have to stand on their own.  This Stash Licorice Spice has a weak licorice taste and a weak spice taste.  I have to use TWO teabags at a time (which makes the seemingly low price not so much a good deal).

review/summary: Subtle, Mild Chamomile Tea
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers. Although I do like this, it means that the tea is rather weak, but still a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little mild and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker!<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for over 35 years, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****
