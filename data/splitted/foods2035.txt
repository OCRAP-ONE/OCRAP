review/summary: Really good Miso
review/text: Finding really good Miso has been harder than I originally thought.  This is one of the two really tasty ones that I have found.  The ingredients are individually packaged inside the cup so you have everything you need to eat a meal... even the cup. Just add hot water. It is really good.  Not quite restaurant quality Miso, but pretty close. Plenty of veggies and seaweed.  No noodles here.  I don't like noodles in my Miso. (just seems wrong to do that to Miso.)<br /><br />If you want great Miso try Edward & Sons Miso-Cup.  it is the best i've found so far.<br /><br />This product reviewed here is very good too, and I will be getting it again in the future for sure. Either is a far cry better than the others I've tried.

Nice to be able to add water without a measuring cup by using the pouch. Also bought the Old fashion maple and brown sugar. Also very good. They were not too sweet with just enough flavor. I'm going to continue to buy this as long as I can find a good deal.

review/summary: Very good oatmeal!
review/text: I love this oatmeal for several reasons.  They include:<br /><br />1. A perfect oatmeal made easy - The manufacturer's products are packaged in a bag that has a fill line.  The user uses the bag as a device to determine how much water is needed for the oatmeal.  I'm one of those folks that always uses too little water, which leads to a gluey, unsatisfying mess.  I have never had an unsatisfying mess with this product.  Always delicious.<br /><br />2. Chai, peaches, strawberries? - Better Oats comes in an assortment of flavors.  My favorite is the spiced chai.  It has a bit of spice but also has some sweet notes.  For those that like plain oatmeal, the company also has a plain option that can be dressed up with fruit or something like sweetened cacao nibs <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002PA8VNG">Navitas Naturals Cacao Nibs Sweetened, 8-Ounce</a>.<br /><br />3. Satisfying - This oatmeal has the power to satisfy for several hours.  I usually eat it in the morning around 8 a.m. and feel fairly full until 11:00 - 11:30.<br /><br />This oatmeal has 160 calories per packet, 3 grams of fiber, 2.5 grams of fat, and 4 grams of protein.<br /><br />Ingredients: Organic whole grain rolled oats, organic evaporated can juice, organic flaxseed, organic barley, organic quinoa, organic rye, organic wheat, evaporated sea salt, natural flavor, guar gum<br /><br />I purchase my Better Oats oatmeal at Big Lots stores.  They sell for 1 dollar for a box of five packets.

review/summary: Weird flavor that I just can't get past
review/text: Found this at the grocery store yesterday for $2 a box, so I thought I'd give it a try. I made my first package a few minutes ago. It smelled great while I let it cool, just like a good chai should. But then the aroma changed to something I couldn't quite place, and unfortunately, this oatmeal had a taste to match. I found it very unappetizing, but taste is subjective, so maybe you'll like it.

review/summary: ALMOST gave this a three...
review/text: But I didn't.<br />My reason for almost giving this oatmeal a 3 was mostly because of the flavour. Despite the wonderful, spicy aroma it gives off (almost makes me think of being in a tea house), the flavour was a little bland, the spice was kinda subtle. I added a little bit of milk, and it tasted MUCH better. Much more flavour when adding a little bit of milk.<br />I'm pretty used to having other kinds of oatmeal, like Quaker oats and Cream of Wheat. I wanted to try this mostly for the sake of trying new things. Well, also I really enjoy chai tea.

review/summary: Used to be super smokey, now more salty than smokey
review/text: I've been getting these for years, but the last few bags since December 2011 and especially the most recent bag in March 2012 since being fulfilled by Amazon have been getting less smokey and more salty. This month's bag was barely smokey at all and super salty. I have no idea why.<br /><br />These used to be shipped direct from Choo Choo R Snacks, and always got delivered in 3 days, and they also included a free sample of another beef snack product. Now that they are being shipped by Amazon, they cost more, took 13 days to receive instead of 3, and no more free sample of another snack!<br /><br />Update! Wow, the same day that I wrote the review above I got a call from an owner of Choo Choo R Snacks, they are sending me some more directly, and their product consistency is very important to them. I haven't been blown away by awesome customer service like this in a very long time! My hopes are up, and I look forward to enjoying the excellent deep smokey flavor again!

review/text: I have having this in my cart for a while since my friend wanted to try it for s long time, but was trying to justify if it was worth its weight in taste. I finally bought it and spilt it equally between ourselves. It was lean and smokey, but it was indeed salty. I liked it enough to want to eat at least 2-3 sticks in one sitting, but the salt content did not allow me to. It is still good and no oily after taste in your mouth like Slim Jim, but I don't think I could buy another set if it would be too salty.

review/summary: Excellent flavor, but a bit too smokey for me
review/text: Overall the flavor of these is excellent.  They are actually a bit denser and dryer then expected, but not enough so to make them less enjoyable for me.<br /><br />But, I can't quite give them five stars.  The first bite, I very much enjoyed both the saltiness and smokiness of the beef stick.  But by the time I finished, the smoke flavor and saltiness had became slightly overpowering.  I may cut them into half sticks to be honest, a half a stick as a snack is about right given the smoke flavor and saltiness for me.<br /><br />Having said that, if you like a STRONG natural smoke flavor and/or like things very salty, then consider this a five star review.  As much as I did enjoy this sausage in small doses, I'd rate their jerky products a bit higher, most or all I've tried I've rated five stars.  Still, if you do like a very strong smokey flavor, again this is the product for you.<br /><br />As an aside, this company has always given me free samples of various flavors of their country cut jerky line, and this time also a free sample of a new flavor, "maple-peppered".  The maple-pepper flavor was excellent, the mix of the two worked well.  I'd probably rate the new flavor 5 stars, and next time I order from them I'll see if they have the new flavor ready to order.  Customer service has always been excellent as well.  This is a wonderful company to order from, and even the product I liked the least I rated four stars.  The ones I liked the most, five stars easily.

review/text: This package of beef sticks didn't exactly meet my expectations.  Two things immediately came to mind when eating: 1. the beef sticks are as hard as rocks!  The sticks are so hard to bite into and then chew, my jaw ends up getting sore after only one piece; definitely not good.  2.  Way too salty!  The flavor of the beef is masked by an undeniable taste of too much salt.<br /><br />I think I only eat 1-2 pieces a week, simply when I need a quick protein source; I wouldn't recommend these to people, especially if they are looking to a tasty and fun to eat snack.

review/text: Buffalo Bill rides again.  These "Extra Smokeys" have very strong smoked flavor, which I have been looking (or drooling) for quite a few years.  By far the best smoked meat snack available in the USA that I know of.  Overall flavor is excellent, though somewhat on the "extra peppery" side.  And a little pricey at $1 each.  And don't even think of doing this at home if you wear dentures--these sticks are quite tough.<br />I will order more within the month, excellent service form Choo Choo R Snacks, and they even give you a bonus beef jerky sample to try.<br />"Extra Smokeys" really smoke!

review/summary: These little things are great
review/text: I love beef jerky. It is one of my favorite snacks and these are awesome. They have a unique taste unlike anything else on the market.  Calling them "extra smokey" is not a joke. You can smell the smoke in the bag, and on the meat. After the first bite I thought, "wow never had anything like that before" then I though "I want more."<br />These are pretty tough, but I like tougher jerky. The soft stuff is not for me at all.  These are salty, but traditional type dried meat is supposed to be and they say this is an "old world" recipe. Like another reviewer stated, I was well taken care of by Choo Choo R snacks when a problem came up that was not of their control. Customer service is great. I have tried a few products in the Buffalo Bills line, and this to me is by far the best. I have had nothing like this before, and I like-em.

review/summary: Intense Flavor To The Max
review/text: After my first order of Extra Smokeys was lost in the mail by the post office, one of the owners, Paul, really took care of me and sent another package right away plus an extra $20 worth of free extra samples for my trouble.  As for the product, I think it is really a flavor explosion.  The smokey smell is obvious when you get too close to the bag, and the flavor is very powerful.  There is just enough spice in there too but not too much.  They are a little chewy, but that just makes you take smaller bites, which both lets you savor the flavor and makes each stick last longer.  They are also very convenient to just grab one from the bag and eat it on the run or in the car.  No mess and no wrappers left behind.  Oh and after 28 days passed, the original missing package finally arrived, so now I have a new bag to start on!  YES! Thanks Paul and Choo Choo R Snacks.  This is some SERIOUS BEEF JERKY.

review/summary: Not as good as they used to be
review/text: ***Original Review***<br />I bought these to try out.  When I got them, the smoke flavor was a little intense, so I only ate 1 stick a day or so.<br /><br />After a while, they grew on me and I found myself eating 2 or 3 a day.<br /><br />I'm ordering more, which shows how much I've grown to like them.<br /><br />**** Revised review ****<br />My last order was dry and very salty.  When I originally ordered these links, they were shipped from a third party or the manufacturer, but the last one I ordered came from Amazon.<br /><br />Is it possible that the stocks have sat around and dried out a bit?  I don't know, but I do know these were not as good as they used to be, hence dropping the number of stars down to 3.

review/text: As a Type 1 diabetic, it's very important for me to have easy and quick access to sugar in case my blood glucose goes too low.  You can buy glucose tablets from any pharmacy, but it turns out that's exactly what Sweet Tarts are.  These are way cheaper, and while the Dex4 tastes pretty good, these are *made* to taste good.  Can't help myself from sneaking a few every now and again.

The kernals are HUGE!!!!!<br />Practically no hull and did I mention they are huge?  We love this popcorn!  We make it in our Whirly Pop with corn oil or seasoned oil and then put butter and salt on it.  The ONLY way to eat popcorn!  Yummmmmmm.

review/summary: Convenient item used in torte recipes
review/text: Many European tortes and cookies use ground hazelnuts as the major ingredient, replacing flour. Some examples are Christmas star cookies from Germany which are small iced nut cakes that have a baked-on icing (Zimtsterne.) Tortes frequently use hazelnut flour as the main ingredient. Rather than having to rub off the skins and grind your own, you can buy Bob's Red Mill hazelnut meal instead. Keep it in the freezer or fridge as it can go rancid if you don't use it all up.<br /><br />ZIMTSTERNE (Cinnamon Stars)<br /><br />1 1/2 cups (about 8 ounces) hazelnuts or blanched almonds, finely ground<br /><br />1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br /><br />3/4 teaspoon grated lemon zest<br /><br />1/4 cup egg whites (about 2 large)<br /><br />Pinch of salt<br /><br />1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar<br /><br />About 1/2 cup additional confectioners' sugar for rolling<br /><br />1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil.<br /><br />2. Combine the nuts, cinnamon, and zest. Beat the egg whites on low speed until foamy, about 30 seconds. Add the salt, increase the speed to medium-high, and beat until soft peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes. Gradually add the confectioners' sugar and beat until stiff and glossy, 5 to 8 minutes. Reserve one-third of the meringue (about 1/3 cup) and fold the nut mixture into the remaining meringue.<br /><br />3. Place a large piece of waxed paper on a flat surface and sprinkle with additional confectioners' sugar. Place the nut mixture on the sugar, lightly sprinkle with more confectioners' sugar, top with a second piece of waxed paper, and roll out 1/4 inch thick. Remove the top piece of waxed paper. Using a cookie cutter dipped in water, cut into 2-inch star shapes or use a sharp knife to cut into diamonds. Reroll and cut any scraps. Place on the prepared baking sheet.<br /><br />4. Bake until set, 10 to 12 minutes. Spread the reserved meringue over the top of the cookies and bake until the tops are lightly colored, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool.  These cookies set up and dry out over 1 day, so let them alone overnight AT LEAST and keep in a tin to store. If they last...which in our house they don't. They are horribly addictive.<br /><br />Approximately 3 dozen cookies.

I run a little bed & breakfast inn, the Anton-Walsh House -- in Hurley, Wisconsin. The guests love the aroma that fills the house when these muffins are cooking. More importantly, they love the rich, nutty flavor this ingredient gives to their first course in the morning.

review/summary: Glorious Assam
review/text: The original box caught my attention while I was tea shopping at the always busy Fairway on Broadway. Price wise this was almost double of what all the other teas were but I couldn't resist the temptation of a new tea. It was a good choice in the end and I can't wait to try all the flavors this brand carries.<br /><br />The mesh tea bag crinkles and sloshes like an expensive fabric as this single origin full leaf tea blooms once the water hits it. This tastes and looks like expensive loose tea with long graceful leaves that always remind me of seaweed in cold green sea. The taste is absolutely exquisite due to the single origin or pure Assam tea, meaning that small and delicate blossoms are selected with no fillers and cheap mixes to stretch the quantity of tea the company can package and sell. This tastes lovely on its own or is incredibly creamy and quiet dreamy with a splash of milk and always with sugar. For connoisseurs of plain black tea, this taste will soothe the taste buds and this will be something that they will reach for daily. I can't even recall how many times I pick this tea over coffee in the morning to give me will to live!<br /><br />- Kasia S.

review/summary: At Last!
review/text: For the last 10 years, I have been striving toward healthier eating.  We joined an organic CSA (Community Support Agriculture), we found good sources for free-range meats & poultry & eggs, we switched over to organic milk.  I buy organic, local, or fair-trade (or all of the above), whenever available.  But my daily elixir: a pot of hot black tea with milk & raw sugar... that perfect pot of tea kept eluding me.<br /><br />The organic and fair-trade options in tea were never right. Oh, sure, if I want rooibos, green, or white tea, organic choices abound.  And organic herbals have always been easy to find, as are good chai teas.  But for unflavored black tea, my organic choices were limited to an adequate English Breakfast, which was never as tasty as I thought it should be for the high price.<br /><br />The proprietor of the local tea & herb specialty shop finally helped me solve my challenge, when she suggested I try Irish Breakfast if I was looking for a lovely black tea for my morning routine, since it is mostly Assam tea, which is just the best, in her opinion, for us black tea lovers.  So after 30 years a tea lover, I finally put my finger on what I loved best in tea: Assam.  Armed with a name for it, I typed "organic assam" into the Amazon search box, and found this wonderful tea.<br /><br />Finally a high quality tea that is rich and smooth and bright and lovely and organic!  And leave it to Amazon to offer case pricing on it.  My inner socially-responsible obsessive-compulsive does a little happy dance with every sip...

review/text: In my opinion this tea is a really good black tea. It is very flavorful, yet extremely mellow. I, like many reviewers, drink this tea all day long. And don't be fooled that one has to drink green tea only, for the health benefits.  Recent research has found that many of the same antioxidants are contained in black tea. So enjoy as I do, and amazon has the best price around.

review/summary: lovely assam tea
review/text: this is my daily morning tea - it is a more delicate bouquet than english breakfast.  try it like this: with a mortar and pestle, ground two cardamom buds, a pinch of fennel seeds, and a little piece of cinnamon.  grate a little ginger.  boil a half cup of water on the stove, and add the ground spices, ginger, and a sugar (1 add about 2 teaspoons of sugar).  as the water starts to boil, add one bag of the assam breakfast tea.  let a nice color develop - takes about a minute.  add a little less than a quarter cup of milk (whole, 2%, 1%, or fat free - you need less if it has more fat) and bring it to a boil.  let it sit for 3-4 minutes before serving.  it should have a nice caramel color.

So if this is what you are looking for then you are in luck, but if you are instead looking for a hazelnut flavored chocolate coating a coffee bean, as I was look elsewhere.<br /><br />These do taste like a chocolate coated piece of coffee flavored candy, but not what I was desiring nor expecting when I placed my order for this item.  Instead they are shaped and formed to give one they are in fact a real coffee bean, which they are not.

review/summary: Great for Indoor Cats on a Budget
review/text: I do cat rescue work, which means I get to keep the special needs cats.  Most of my gang is over 12 years old.  I started them on this because it sounded like a better cat food than the commercial stuff I find on sale, and the money for it was in the same ballpark.  Since I have put all 15 on this food the "Hawking up Hairballs" has went down to a small fracture of what it has been for years.  And they eat much less, which means litter boxes are not as busy, and they are more healthy.  Its a good deal for me, and a great deal for their health!  For the price, its the best I can find!  And I would know after 30 years of cat rescue.

review/text: It pains me to have to disagree with reviewer K.Wessel. The information in that review is incorrect. This product is healthy for cats. Maybe not so for humans, but healthy for the digestive tract of a cat. My five year old Siamese neutered male is stupendously healthy, satisfied and very happy. He has maintained his exact weight for three consecutive years. We have his vet records to back up these statements. His vet is happy, his mom is happy, and best of all he (Tu'i Tonga) is happy. If you have questions, please consult your vet. A cats digestive needs are much different than a humans. The ingredients may sound awful to us, but it's not our health we should be concerned with when buying pet food.

review/text: My kitties and I love this catfood. Had some problems with the boy kitty after neutering and he went off his food for over a week. He was wasting away. When he got back to having an appetite (no amount of treats or special foods would tempt him) he went back to chowing down on the GoodLife Recipe food, and regained all the lost weight and muscles he had lost. I believe this food saved his life.

review/summary: My 3 cats eat it...  guess it's good.
review/text: My three cats seem to really like this cat food, although I think they would be happy with any cat food.  Every feeding they act as if I never feed them.  As a pet owner I looked more at price and quality.  Decent price, decent quality.  I am on the fence weather I like this product or the new Purina One Beyond better for my cats.  I think I will stick with The Goodlife Recipe primarily because it is cheaper through amazon and it is just a lot easier to have food automatically at my doorstep when I need it.  Believe me, you don't want to run out with three cats swooping around like vultures at food time!  If amazon starts carrying the Beyond with Subscribe and Save, I could be swayed.<br /><br />In the past, when my oldest cat was younger, I would buy the cheapest cat food money could buy.  This caused him to be over-weight and his coat was dull and he just didn't look good.  Once I got him to a normal weight with a high protein food of Purina One Healthy Weight Formula, I began looking for a lower price food to maintain this new lower weight.  They have been eating this food for over 6 months now and coats are great and all three cats look very healthy.<br /><br />I gave it four stars because, although it is a decent food, I know there are better out there, just not as convenient as this item on amazon in my price range.

review/summary: Healthy Food For Our Feline Friends
review/text: When my parents first got their cat, they tried every cat food brand - dry or wet - it didn't matter, their cat would not eat more than a few bites.  Then they discovered The Goodlife.  That is all their pampered cat eats.<br /><br />A few years ago, when I adopted my lil feline buddy from the shelter, I wanted the best for her.  I tried the expensive, all-protein brands, but my cat would have various stomach issues.  I finally switched her over to The Goodlife and again, voila!  For the past 2 years, that is all she ever eats (plus her treats).<br /><br />Currently, I also am a caretaker for a feral cat colony in my condo complex and feed them a combination of the store brand stuff and The Goodlife.  They are healthier and more lively than I could possibly hope for.<br /><br />Plus, with Amazon's Shop N Save program, I never run out of food for my feline best-friend.

review/summary: Not the best, but better than most
review/text: I have two boys...well first we had one. He was a little panther zipping and yowling around our house and would anything, especially bagels...I still can't keep bagels in my house. Then we decided he need a playmate. That's when we came across Octavious or "silky" as his current human called him. And he was silky, such much so in comparison our first cat felt like velcro when petted. We couldn't afford Science diet and they seemed to hate the plain taste of it. We started mixing the good life with it and we have noticed more energy, more love from them and softer shiny coats. Less itchiness too.<br /><br />Yes it has corn, but guess what so does half the things you eat. I am not concerned on wheat/corn debate as my cat goes after my bread, my bagels or anything tasting like wheat.

review/summary: Very Happy with it!
review/text: We have 4 cats a little over 1 year old. We started out feeding them Blue Buffalo but they were always very gassy and 2 of the cats were getting plump.. while another was too skinny. So we ventured into trying other brands healthy or otherwise. They can be a bit picky but they eventually got used to anything. "Their" favorite was the Purina stuff... but that's just like us loving junk food isn't it...while the 1 skinny one did attain a normal weight the 2 plump ones became quite fat! So eventually we picked up this Goodlife brand, for indoor cats. They took to it well and before we knew it the 2 fat cats are down to a healthy weight. The skinny cat is looking a little skinnier too but she has maintained a healthy weight with this stuff. It's been about 5 months now and they are all still very healthy and I am very Happy with this brand and this particular recipe (indoor). It has been a perfect balance for all 4 of our cats. We did try the all ages a couple of times but it doesn't seem to satisfy them as well and they eat a lot more of it.

review/summary: Mixed feelings
review/text: I bought this for my 2 indoor only cats. The price was very good at the time for what seemed to be decent quality food for the price. It arrived super fast with Prime shipping. I was very impressed that the 15 pound bag had a very sturdy resealable zipper to help reduce the food going stale or needing to put it in a storage container.<br /><br />Unfortunately though, my cats would just not eat this food. I had bought it on a whim since money was tight and I was trying to save a few bucks. I filled up the self feeding container for the cats and they just would not touch it..the food just sat and sat, for literally a week. They had nibbled at it now and then, but did not eat as they do with their regular food. It was like they would eat just a few pieces and that was it.<br /><br />Luckily, one of the cats prefers wet food anyway, so she was still eating daily, but the other cat does not eat wet food and just refused to eat this Good Life Recipe. I was hoping she would come out of being stubborn, or would just get so hungry that she would eat it, but no such luck. I ended up buying our regular food after it was apparent that she would not eat this replacement.<br /><br />A few years back, when this cat food first came on the market, I had received a sample bag of it in the mail. At that time I had another cat who has since passed away, and he ate it just fine. I assume it has a particualr taste or smell that just does not appeal to certain cats. I will say that this food does have a strong smell and oddly enough it sort of reminds me of vomit. This could very well be the reason that some cats do not take to it.<br /><br />Since getting our regular cat food, I tried mixing it half and half with this Goodlife recipen so that I would not be wasting an entire 15lb bag, and the cats would still not eat it. I added more of the regular food, maybe 75/25 and now they seem to be eating it since there is more of the Iams than Goodlife. I will keep mixing it with that ratio so that it does not go to waste.

review/summary: My Sensitve Stomach Cats Love it!
review/text: I want to start by saying I am not a professional, just an average cat owner. I realize this isn't the highest quality cat food out there. However, in my opinion, this is a great middle of the road more natural cat food. Our cats love it and haven't had any problems digesting it.<br /><br />We have 2 cats that are a year old. We adopted them from a shelter 4 months ago. When they were babies they got a virus and as a result have sensitive stomachs. I had to find a food for them with not a lot of fillers and dyes. Particularly the red dye found in most cat foods. The foster home gave them Purina Naturals which was more expensive then Goodlife so I am very happy I found this brand of food. I am a realistic common sense cat owner on a budget so price had to be a factor especially with 2 cats. I admit I didn't know anything about corn and other stuff in cat food. The ingredients in this cat food hasn't had any negative affects on our cats. In fact they have a soft shiny coat, very seldom get hair balls, and are full of energy.<br /><br />I always had cats growing up that ate just regular cat food and they lived to be old. In fact my one cat is 13 years old now. I don't understand why all of a sudden people are so critical of cat food. There are certainly worse cat foods out there with a lot of fillers and dyes that in some cases can be more expensive. I recommend giving this food a try and let your cat decide if he/she likes it.

review/summary: Great choice of food, no stomach sensitivities
review/text: One of my cats is 17 years old and I rescued her from the outdoors.  She had a rough life before I had her.  Over the years I've fed her premium brands and a few regular brands.  I tried this food after I first saw the commercial and I've never had to switch to any other since.  I like this food because all 3 of my cats like it and they don't have any sensitivities to it.  The bottom line is that I'm certain there are many brands on the market that may have only natural ingredients in them.  But I think all food has to have some preservatives in them so they are able to be packaged for sale in dry form.  So how can even the purest foods with preservatives in them really be any better than this one?  I don't feel as though I'm shortening my cats' life span feeding them this brand.  Hey, 17 years and still kickin' is enough proof to me.  I give The Goodlife Recipe two thumbs up!!

review/text: This is a very good cat food; high quality and eagerly gobbled up by 8 picky cats at our house.  Be aware that it is $10 cheaper for the same sized bag at Walmart.  Jest sayin'.....

review/summary: It's the Goodlife!
review/text: My cats enjoy the taste of this, it seems to be healthy for them also. My orange tabby has hairball problems, hopefully the moisture will help him out here. The bag is heavy duty, re-sealable, and easy to store. I would definitely get this again, maybe in another flavor just for variety.

review/summary: Pooptacularly Bad
review/text: I tried this cat food for my 5 month old kitten.  we used this for about two weeks thinking that her stomach would get used to it.  We were wrong.  This cat food made our cat crap like a 300 pound man.  And my gosh did it stink.  This cat food turned our cute little fur ball into a feline ball of gas that you no longer wanted on your lap or for that matter in our house.  I kid you not, after two weeks of this cat food the cat's butthole was actually protruding.  We went back to the cat food we were giving her before and within two weeks she was back to normal.<br /><br />Never again.

review/summary: Corn?? Really??
review/text: My two cats are both over 10 yrs of age - and they are different in how they eat - but one thing is for sure - they don't and can't digest CORN!!!  My Russian Blue cat, Katie - got sick EVERY TIME she ate. They don't get outside - so they needed more protein in the diet - and even though it seems like a good food ( I was hook line and sinker too) - it is not worth it when my cats are constantly throwing up five minutes after eating it.  So - it was time for a change.  Read your labels carefully!!  They need MEAT - PROTEIN! - not corn!

review/summary: amazing!!
review/text: I never write reviews for things I purchase.. but this product is definately something I'll never go without for my babies! I switched my 3 cats to this approx 10months ago, not only has my cat lost weight (he was weighing in at 23lbs while eating meow mix, he now weighs 17) all the cats have better breath and are much more playful.  I purchase this at walmart at only pay about $14, which is only $2 more than what i was paying for meow mix. My babies love this food, and its obviously a lot better for them.. looks like we've found a food of choice!!<br /><br />Spook 17bs, 3yo<br />Twinkie 8.5lbs, 6yo<br />Betelguese 7lbs, 1yo

review/summary: Great Nutrition for Cats
review/text: I got this so that my girls could have some variety in their meals. The nutritional value is great and they really scarf it up! They "helped" me open up the Amazon box when I brought it in the door. Since this is such a hit with them, it will be on their menu quite often.It is the first time I tried this brand. I usually feed them Iams, but wanted to try a little variety for a change.
