review/summary: Wellnes Dog Food
review/text: It is a good dog food.  Our dogs stools have become normal since using it.  My only complaint is when you open the can there is a gell similar to when you open a can of Spam, which has to be scraped off and you lose some dog food because of the space taken by the gel.

review/summary: Consistently in the top ten recommended canned dog foods
review/text: Had my big noble boy dog, who had been with me for ten years, die of Cancer recently. He was a animal shelter rescue (As all my pets have been, and are.), and a great creature who never wanted to ever show weakness. By the time he did show weakness, the Cancer was far too advanced to operate on or save him and he died within a month.<br /><br />That set me to feeding my two dogs (His mate who is still with me, and her new mate) ONLY quality dog food. It costs more; but after seeing what was in the average store dog food on internet posts, and confirmed on dog food cans labels, that convinced me to try something better.<br /><br />I researched the net for the top ten dog foods, and this brand kept coming up in the lists consistently; including Veterinary sites. Made only with grain free quality ingredients,and other healthy additions for good digestion, my two dogs eat it enthusiastically, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Both dogs are fed Wellness brand "Beef Stew" and Wellness brand "Lamb and Beef Stew", alternating for variety in their diets; they love both equally, and both canned foods are equally healthy.

review/summary: My Chihuahua Loves this Stuff
review/text: I've been feeding Wellness food to my Chihuahua for nearly a year and she loves it. She dances around eager for her breakfast when I start scooping it into her dish. I would give it 5 stars, except that it is difficult to find in the 6 oz size, and it has that room-filling reek that most canned dog foods have (which my dog loves, but I hate). She has not had any digestive issues with the food, and I like that the first three ingredients on the list are all turkey, and the following three are vegetables. I can actually see the sweet potato in the food. My dog doesn't have any food allergies, but I have read that foods using alternative meats such as turkey, lamb and duck can help if your dog has poor reaction to beef based foods. As long as they keep making this, I'll keep buying it.

review/text: I love this brand. If you go to their website, sign up for their newsletters. They'll send you $3.00 off coupons every couple of months or so. No so helpful when purchasing through amazon but helpful if you have a local store with Amazon similar pricing like I do ;)<br /><br />My dog loves this food. I use a spoonful in his dry food every night with some warm water to make it a little soupy for him. I like the ingredients, the way his coat looks, how he NEVER has bad breath or dog farts. Ever.

review/text: I mix a spoonful of the Wellness food topper/mixer with Wellness Core dry food for both of my dogs and they LOVE it! It's healthy AND grain free which makes me feel confident that they are getting everything they need in their diets. Both dogs eat every bit of their food at their scheduled feedings which has been super beneficial for potty training my new rescue dog. I would highly recommend Wellness to everyone! You can't go wrong with this stuff!

review/summary: Almost as good as the lamb
review/text: After reviewing the lamb product that is labeled the same way it is worth noting that this food is very good as well.  Not quite as attractive as the lamb, but still rated high on her taste test scale.  It provides a way to give some variety without upsetting her system.  Most of the Wellness canned foods are remarkable in that respect.

I'm glad to report after a week on Wellness Lamb and Sweet Potato, in addition to the Core dry food, Gil's stomach problems are over.<br /><br /> This is Human Grade Food for dogs.  He gets one 6 ounce can a day and munches on core dry all day. I also cut out all processed dog treats. We stick with fresh food treats such as: apple, sweet potato, egg, and some cheese once in awhile. Frozen string beans in an ice cube tray are also great!<br /><br />Please take care to feed your dogs and cats natural foods!  Read articles on rendered meats, your stomach will turn.  Take care!

review/summary: Cleared my Dogs Eyes Right Up! No more RX's for Her!
review/text: My dog loves this....and so do we!  Miki has been having problems for over a year with the skin just outside of her tear ducts getting red, then raw...poor thing.  Each time I'd take her to the vet, (2 different vets just to see), they  both prescribed the same eye drop medicine ($27.00) for a tiny bottle.  But, it never cleared up entirely, and the minute I'd stop with the drops, after weeks of applying 2-3 x's a day, it would come right back. Looking at her made me feel terrible.<br /><br />Then, I started thinking about maybe it was something she is eating, even though I've been feeding her Ceasar for a couple years and thought it to be a "good" dog food.  But after researching what was in Wellness dog food compared to the store bought stuff, I couldn't believe I was feeding her that stuff!<br />So, after doing the math, a 3oz tub of Ceasar vs the 12 1/2 oz can of Wellness, I could get 3 bigger servings (4.1 oz each) out of a can of Wellness...for the same, or better price, and it was way healthier for her!<br /><br />Our Miki looks so pretty again (Papillon) and seems she has a whole lot more energy too! I figure it must be the change in diet that helped clear up her eyes but wasn't sure because we moved at the same time (same town) and I thought it might have been some plants/allergies she was getting into in the back yard.  But....I let myself run out of Wellness (not on purpose!) and had to feed her something else, so I went with the Ceasar and ordered her some more Wellness.  By the time I placed and received my order, (not much more than a week), the skin below her eyes had already broken out again! Ummmm...CONFIRMATION! And guess what?  Within 2 weeks after our Wellness shipment arrived, and she was back eating her favorite dog food, Miki's tear duct area was dried up, rawness gone, and hair was growing back!<br /><br />I don't even remember how I stumbled across this dog food, and who would have ever thought I'd be ordering dog food from Amazon, but with the great price, and free super saver shipping, like I said earlier, it's the same price as that store bought "stuff", but she gets more than an ounce more per serving and look at the ingredients...it's real chicken, and sweet potatoes! (A lot of other good for her stuff!)<br /><br />I'm sold on Wellness (so is Miki~she loves it!) I had just come back online to re-order some more Wellness Chicken and Sweet Potato food, when I thought that I should take a moment to RAVE about this great stuff.<br />So I did!

review/summary: Looks like Pate meh  -1 star
review/text: well I gave this product 4 stars because the purpose I used it for was not intended.  I saw that it had 95%  meat which was perfect (in my mind) for a cat diet, and the price point was nearly half of that which is for cats.<br /><br />FTR:  Cats and dogs have two completely and vastly varied nutritional needs, in my research I recall reading that a cat's diet is mainly 95% meat (from which they derive their moisture/water from as well) since cats hunt and eat small rodents and birds in nature this makes sense, since the 5% veggie content is likely from eating cat grasses and the contents of their prey's tummy at the time of death.<br /><br />I decided to purchase this food since it was only 2.56 a can at Unleashed and I figured I would just add in a calcium supplement, and taurine, and cat vitamin supplement to make up for the missing bones which would provide the natural calcium source for cats, and taurine since I don't believe dogs require as much taurine in their diets as cats would and vitamins to make up for the possibility that there may not be enough vitamins in just meat alone.<br /><br />My cats loved it.  I have one very finicky girl kitty whom refuses to eat human foods (which is a good thing)  and most junky cat foods (another good thing)  and one male cat that eats whatever he can get his whiskers into.  They both liked this.  So I would consider feeding this to them in lieu of the more expensive cat foods (after I compare the ingredients of this to that of cat foods and make up the missing vitamins and minerals)  however I am not happy with the fact that this cat food has the consistency of pate..<br /><br />it is all ground up meats and looks like refried beans... I'm going to search for a similar product which has shredded meat rather than this consistency :)

review/text: I have to say its a bit pricey but at the end I actually saved alot because you only need to give a couple of spoonful along with the dry food. My dog loves it! You have to make sure you give a small amount depending on the size of your pet because it's high in calories. Sashie did not experience any problems when I switched to this new dog food. It's also a great coverup for any medications your dog might need to take.

review/summary: Good value and fast shipping
review/text: This 12-pack case is a great value and is actually about 20 cents cheaper per can than my local pet food store. It arrived very quickly at our house and only one of the cans had a small dent at the base. It still made the swoosh sound when I opened it with the can opener, so the vacuum was still good and the food was still fresh. Great deal, and now I don't have to run out to the pet food store after work every few days to pick up more cans. I can simply drive home to my baby puppy at the end of the day. I did notice that all my dogs have had softer stools with this food, but if I mix it with the dry food and feed less frequently they don't have too much of a problem.

review/summary: Perfect as an occasional supplement!
review/text: My wife and I bought a couple cans of this food for a few days when we were away from home with our dog. It is a little pricey, but then again this is definitely not meant as a daily meal - it even plainly says on the can to feed supplementally only!<br /><br />PROS<br />- Our dog loves it!<br />- 95% chicken content, no fillers<br />- Perfect for road/camping trips<br />- No gastrointestinal discomfort that we could see<br /><br />CONS<br />- Not human grade meat<br /><br />It is important to understand the difference between quality in meats for dog (and cat) food. Much research has been done on the subject (easily found on Google), but my wife and I decided some months ago to only feed our dog human-grade meat, termed in the pet food industry as "inspected for human consumption". The chicken used in the wellness food is NOT inspected for human consumption, however since we have only fed our pup this twice, we aren't too worried. If Wellness switched to human-grade meat, I would happily give this the full five stars, and this is really the only criticism I could give for this product.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I would recommend this as an occasional food for your dog, with the one reservation noted above.

review/summary: Not a balanced meal -
review/text: If my dog were reviewing this, he'd give it 5 stars - but that's because he's not aware that nutritional imbalances are possible.  It's high quality - and he thinks it's delicious.<br /><br />I looked back at the page after ordering to see if I'd just missed a warning, but I don't think it's there. The page is not clear enough, in my opinion - that this is NOT a balanced diet. I didn't realize until it arrived and has a note on it that says "Wellness 95% Canned Recipes are intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only."<br /><br />I get that I should have been aware that something with so few ingredients is obviously not enough for long term feeding, but I do think the page should have a more clear note on it so that when people are ordering a few cases of food quickly it's clear that this one is really more a treat than a meal.<br /><br />It's good though, for what it aims to be: a canned chicken treat to serve in addition to your dog's normal diet.

review/summary: Stinky but my dogs love it!
review/text: Even though this is 95% chicken, it looks like cat food (ground up texture) and smells like stinky canned chicken.  It's a very strong smell!  My dogs go NUTS for this, though (1 Labrador and 2 Boston Terriers).  I just add a couple spoonfuls as a topper to their dry food, so one can lasts awhile.  I probably will try something less smelly next time but I like the quality of the ingredients and like the Wellness brand.

review/text: This is one of four or five varieties of Wellness canned food my dog has tried.  At first she seemed to like it, and she ate it well.  After a couple of packs(12 cans) she refused to eat it at all.  This was not the only flavor she was given during this time, but she knew when it was part of her meal.  I don't know what happened, but it is not on our menu any longer.

review/summary: A thousand Times Better than what the store has to offer!
review/text: I have a corn allergy and Bob's Red Mill is the only brand that I could find that didn't use some form of corn in their dates to prevent clumping.<br /><br />Taste wise, they are great! Not dry at all, slightly chewy but nice and tender. After using an entire bag I did not run across even one pit or piece of pit! And the slight bit of oat flour doesn't distort the taste or texture.<br /><br />I just love having a 1/4 cup of these as a snack and they hit the spot!<br /><br />Bob's Red Mill dates are by far one of the best, if not the best that you can readily get since most stores carry them. No additional sugar (some add sugar to dates, crazy hu?), no preservatives, and main thing for me, no corn products!

review/text: Good packaging.  Have the sunflower, sesame, flaxseed and wheat gern from Bob's Red Mill, all of which are very good.  However, the date pieces would be tastier if they were slightly bigger.  They are very small and rolled in flour and this cuts down on their flavor.  I bought them primarily to use as a snack.  Have seen similar date pieces in homes that look like very tiny short sausages.  Unfortunately I don't know the brand.

review/summary: Convenient
review/text: I was looking for a convenient way to make myself a single mug of reasonably healthy "vin chaud" for winter evenings, so I decided to try these teabag-style sachets. I've tried various experiments, and a tasty, *very* convenient method is as follows: pour about 4-5 oz each of unfiltered apple juice and jug-style red wine into a mug with one of these sachets, and heat in the microwave until it just boils. Remove from microwave and cover with (for example) a saucer and let it sit for about 10-15 minutes. Then carefully remove the sachet with a spoon and start sipping your vin chaud. You can reheat it in the microwave if necessary, but I've found it's still a reasonable temperature (depending on the ambient temperature and on the sides of the mug). I also tried it without adding apple juice, and to me, the sharpness of these spices plus the acidity of the wine was not pleasant, but of course YMMV. Half and half apple juice and wine plus one of these sachets is just about perfect in terms of the sour-sweet-bitter balance. I don't like adding sugar to my food, and of course that's what most people do, but I can't comment on that because I never tried it. It's acceptable with just apple juice and the spice sachet, but too sweet/sour for my tastes.<br /><br />The spice sachets are individually wrapped in paper, not foil. For freshness I store them in one of those air-tight clear plastic containers.

review/summary: Pecan Pie, 3 Ingredients, How DO they do it?!
review/text: WOW! I recently tried Lara Bar for the first time, and have tried several flavors now. Who knew an energy/meal bar could be this good? Simply amazing!<br /><br />My favorite is the PECAN PIE FLAVOR. It satisfies my craving for an actual pecan pie, and it only has 3 ingredients! The ingredients are: dates, pecans, almonds. That's it! I cannot figure out how they make it taste like pie with only these ingredients but they do. How wonderful to have an item with such a short healthy ingredient list.<br /><br />My second favorite so far is the Lemon Bar, it's really good too, and has only 5 ingredients. Key Lime Pie is good... heck, they're all good!<br /><br />So refreshing to eat something that tastes so decadent, and is made from whole foods, thanks Lara Bar! :-)

review/summary: Larabar Key Lime Pie
review/text: Yum!  This was my first experience with a Larabar and I really liked it.  I love key lime pie to begin with, so I was beyond excited to find a bar in that flavor.<br /><br />While it didn't taste exactly like a Key Lime Pie, this bar did have a lot of lime flavor.  It also had some crunchy nuts that contrasted nicely with the almost fruit chews texture of the rest of the bar.  I also was able to taste the hint of coconut in there as well.  Between those three flavors, it tasted very fresh and almost like I was eating a fruit salad in bar form.  Definitely a pleasant experience.<br /><br />The ingredient list on this bar is phenomenal.  Only 5 ingredients are in it:  dates, cashews, almonds, coconut, and lime juice.  That's it, no hard to pronounce ingredients, no added sweeteners, just plain food that is easily recognized by just about anyone.  In fact, according to the package, because of those ingredients, this bar equals 1/4 of a cup of fruit.<br /><br />Nutrition wise, this bar is about on par with most other fitness bars.  It has 220 calories, which is high for a snack but good for if you're working out or as a meal replacement.  Sugars are high, 24 grams, but at least it's from all natural foods and not because they dumped a pile of sugar in the bar.  There's also some vitamins hiding in there, but those too aren't from vitamins injected into the food.<br /><br />A pretty good bar.  I'm eager to try out the other Larabars and see if they're just as good.  And I know I'll definitely be buying this one again.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/summary: Simply Delightful
review/text: I love a Larabar as a snack at work.  I don't get breaks or lunches, so I eat one mid-shift which holds me over well until I get home to eat a real meal.  They're convenient to throw in my purse, and are easy to eat.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Super healthy.  Three simple ingredients, no fillers, no added sugars.<br />- Good source of protein, plus a handful of vitamins and minerals.<br />- Very tasty.  Slightly sweet, and fresh peanut taste.<br />- Soft and chewy, easy to eat.  The peanuts are ground into small pieces, which I really like.  They're plentiful and blended perfectly with the dates.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Make me thirsty.  I recommend at least a little water after eating.<br />- A bit pricey.<br /><br />OVERALL OPINION:<br />I just love these Larabars.  They don't taste just like a peanut butter cookie, but they do have a wonderful flavor which I found surprising given the ingredients.  I love that there is no added sugars.  One bar makes me feel great after I eat it, and there is no sugar crash later on.  With protein and fiber, it's a great choice.  Also, it's gluten-free and dairy-free for individuals who cannot consume either of those two things.<br /><br />I highly recommend!

review/summary: Gingerbread without the guilt
review/text: At Christmastime, I made gingerbread men that I rolled out thick so they would retain their softness. They were good -- so good that I put on more pounds than I wanted because I enjoyed them so. But it's hard to find that spicy ginger taste that satisfies. Most gingerbreads and gingersnaps are lacking.<br /><br />In February, I started eating paleo. (Look it up - I won't explain it here.) For the occasional "cheat," I wanted something naturally sweetened without glutens or grains. Many paleo/primal websites recommend Larabars. I've eaten them before but never the Ginger Snap variety.<br /><br />O.M.G. They hit the spot and then some. What an indulgence -- and they remind me of my fattening gingerbread men from Christmas. Soft and chewy with that marvelous gingerbread taste. So worth it.<br /><br />So whether you're eating paleo, gluten free, natural whole foods or just want a good for you treat, Ginger Snap is it for ginger lovers.

review/summary: Cinnamon Roll
review/text: This Larabar tastes just like a cinnamon roll!!!  I don't know how those Larabar people do it, but whatever the flavor of Larabar it is, it tastes just like the real thing!!!  This particular Larabar is cinnamon roll, therefore, it goes good with a cup of coffee.  And in this cold weather lately, good hot coffee has been welcome!!!  I've been having my share lately of good hot coffee and Larabars!!!  And if you like cinnamon rolls, I'm sure you would love this particular Larabar.<br /><br />And for hot weather, or for the flavors of Larabars that go better with cold beverages, cold iced tea works very well also with Larabars.<br /><br />Oh, and I need to tell you, Larabars are natural - no added sugar, only natural sugar from fruits.  There are no bad ingredients.  There is also no soy.  Larabars are healthy, convenient, filling, perfect.  And vegan.  And even if you aren't vegan, you can still eat Larabars because they are so good.  They are so good, you forget that they are made from healthy ingredients.<br /><br />Cinnamon Roll Larabar.  Highly Recommended.

review/text: I love Larabars in general, they're wonderfully portable, filling, and the most straightforwardly healthy/unprocessed bars widely available in my area.  The cherry pie flavor in particular is fun because of its unabashed tangy-cherry taste, the mix of sour-sweet and nutty is perfect.

review/summary: Excellent taste and great for pick-me-up during activities
review/text: I'm always trying different "energy bar" type products. Lately I've been eating the Larabar during my long XC skiing tours. I've got to say that I think these are one of the best tasting bars I've eaten... ever. I love the tangy taste of the cherry and it is also good news to me that it is made with raw ingredients, no added sugar and no saturated fat (cholesterol free).<br /><br />The closest thing I could equate this bar to would be the inside of a fig newton cookie. It's firmer though and has more pronounced cherry flavor. I find it satisfying and I do "feel good" about eating it. I also like Cliff Bars but if I had only these two to choose from, I'd choose the Larabar Cherry Pie. Yum.

review/text: I'm off gluten and trying to wean myself off dairy as well.  Larabar pecan pie has no gluten or dairy, and it actually tastes great!  The bars are 1.6 ounces, which I find just the right size for a snack.  The pecan flavor is sweet, but not too sweet, and the bar has a nice balance between soft and crunchy. There are 220 calories in each bar, and 130 of them are fat calories, but this is FAR healthier for you than any candy bar.  Ingredients are dates, pecans, and almonds- amazingly simple!<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Pretty good - though flavor not all I had hoped
review/text: These are, like all LaraBars, flavorful, filling, and made of simple ingredients.  The flavor wasn't all I'd hoped, given some of the reviews - they're cherry pie LaraBars with chopped peanuts added - a little peanut taste as you bite into them, and a peanut aftertaste.  What I loved about peanut butter sandwiches was the way the richness of the peanut butter contrasted with the fruitiness of the jelly.<br /><br />These bars don't do it for me, since they lack the rich peanut butter taste I love.  However, they're not at all bad in themselves (just not so good that they'd make my favorites list, where apple pie remains at the top, though I've never tried a LaraBar I really didn't like).

review/summary: As healthy as bars get
review/text: The raw nuts and fruits in these bars make them as close to nature as anything you will find in a wrapper. The Larabar reminds me of the naturally zesty and sweet fruit rolls I used to eat as a kid but also has wonderful, flavorfull fresh nuts mixed in. Raw nuts contain healthy fats and the protein and fat in the nuts will lower the glycemic index of the food. If you don't want to lug around raw cherries and a snack bag of raw nuts, this is the convenient alternative.<br /><br />Keep in mind, these are excellent treats for pets too. They are especially nice for birds who like to pick at the dried fruit and munch on the raw nuts. If you are going to offer these to a pet, please check the ingredients to be sure they are compatible with your species of pet.

review/text: I've tried many bars over the years, from snack bars to energy bars. These bars are the best tasting and are great in any flavor, but my favorite flavor is Peanut Butter Cookie as it's not too sweet. Being gluten sensitive and struggling with low blood sugar, Lara Bars are the perfect balanced snack for me when on the go whether I'm running errands or exercising. I ride a bicycle for many miles and carry a couple of Lara Bars, some fruit, and water. As a result, I feel sufficiently fueled for my rides and do not encounter any stomach distress.

review/summary: Yummy G/F Alternative!
review/text: First let me state that I've only tried 3 flavors so far (chocolate coconut, cocoa mole', and apple pie).<br /><br />I found chocolate coconut to be my least favorite. Normally I like the chocolate coconut combination, but in this brand it just didn't work for me!  If I had to rate it, I'd only give it 2 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that cocoa mole' was a huge improvement (so if you're in the mood for something chocolaty- I would highly recommend this)!!  The cinnamon/chili combo is very unique (but shouldn't be a surprise if you know what mole' is).  The cinnamon is comforting, and the chili gives it a little zing- with a faint hint of heat.<br /><br />  The apple pie flavor is so far my favorite out of the three.  You can definitely taste the distinct apple cinnamon flavor.  I'm not sure if I encountered a rasin in mine though.  I also like that it has walnuts in it.<br /><br />  Anyway, I can't wait to sample other flavors!  ..I hope they come up with a new flavor that involves macadamia nuts!!

review/text: The box shipped to me receives one star for old and stale inventory.<br />The product itself receives 5 stars.<br />Amazon receives 5 stars for refunding the full purchase amount.<br />Customer Service receives 5 starts for their professional conduct.<br /><br />For several years I have been purchasing my favorite LaraBar flavors at the nearest Trader Joe's location. I recently moved to an area where TJ has little presence, if any, and ordered the bars from Amazon instead. Although the label on the box had indicated the expiration date was 10 months away, the first bar I chewed into was dry, stale, with a bitter after taste. This is disappointing because I am familiar with this product and I know what flavor to expect. I still like LaraBar and will continue to consume it but my next purchase will have to be from a brick and mortar location where I can sample an individual bar prior to purchasing a full box.<br />Upon my request Amazon had issued a full refund for this purchase.

review/text: I can't believe some people actually manage to compare these bars to Snickers or other fake-ingredient bars. Really? A 200 calories of fruit and nuts vs. hydrogenated, high-fructose, heart-attack calling candy bars should really make this decision easy.<br />I actually came across Larabars just recently. I heard about them, but I was just never too curious to actually read the ingredients and try one. To give a little background on my life-style, I do all of my own cooking to make sure I know exactly what goes into it. I stray away from all the processed foods and I don't eat grains and starches such as potatoes. I also don't eat refined sugars as it falls into a category of processed foods. With that said, I am a human being and I do get cravings for something dessert-like. I have very high standards for my dessert. It has to be all-natural, unprocessed, and preferably without added sweeteners. With all of those requirements one has to pretty much always prepare their desserts from scratch because there aren't whole lot of prepackaged foods out there that have that same philosophy about preparing it. Larabar is one of the very few out there who actually got it right.<br />I was a little skeptical about the taste of the bars when I bought a couple to sample, but they all exceeded my expectations and I will definitely be buying them in the future.<br />Now, I wouldn't overindulge in eating a few of those a day as they are still plenty sweet and carbolicious, but I usually have a few bites after lunch as a dessert treat. One bar lasts me 3-4 days and I will choose it over Snickers any time of the day.

review/summary: Wonderful fruit and nuts on the go
review/text: This bar is great for getting raw fruit and nuts into your family. Could the nuts be chopped a bit smaller? Sure. But then the whole bar would be too mushy. Could they use fewer dates (to cut the sugar) and make the bar as moist? Doubtful. Cheries are tough as dried fruit goes, and I'm guessing that's the reason for the excessive dates. (Note, though, I can't stand plain dates and I don't notice the flavor or find them overwhelming. I'd just like a more tart, less sweet bar.)<br />This is the alternative to giving yourself and your family dried fruit--this bar is softer, easier to share, and slightly more flavorful than the best dried fruit. It makes nuts palatable to kids who think they don't like nuts. And that means more protein into your diet (though not as much as I'd like, it has exponentially more than plain fruit).<br />Great bar. Good price through Amazon. Stash these bars in your car, your briefcase, your desk drawer, your diaper bag, your kids' backpacks, and your family's workout bags.

review/summary: Great gluten-free snack
review/text: I started picking up these bars at the health food store after I had to give up granola bars.  The cherry pie bars taste amazingly like the real filling, except without all the unnecessary sugar.  The bars are sweet enough on their own and the nuts add a delightful crunch.  The other flavors are delicious as well.  The price of the individual bars can fluctuate by more than sixty cents depending on the vendor and Amazon sells them for less as a large package than the individuals would cost at the cheapest store.  The organic ingredients and lack of additives ensure that the bars are gluten-free, but are still tasty.

review/text: A little harder to find than most of the other Larabars....by far my favorite.  All natural and very light lemon flavor. Packed with nuts to satisfy hunger for several hours and just sweet enough to keep cravings at bay.  My six year old even likes these.

review/text: I really like the Lara bar series of bars.  This one is yummy but very strong.  I can only have maybe half at a sitting.
