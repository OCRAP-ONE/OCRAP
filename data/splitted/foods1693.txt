review/summary: My daughter loves this
review/text: My 14 month old loves these pouches and it's a great way of getting broccoli into her diet.  she just started being able to do it herself recently, although it's sometimes messy.  I just wish they were available in the larger size.  3.5 ounces is not a lot for a toddler - she can finish this in a minute and would want more.  She also loves the spinach, mango, and pear happy baby pouches which are bigger.

review/summary: HappyBaby is my go-to
review/text: I'm a busy mom with two jobs and a 6 month old. I want to make my own baby food but I really don't even have five extra minutes to do that. HappyBaby pouches are my go to! I started adding Apple Cherry to my daughters cereal because she didn't want to eat the rice cereal plain. Now she gobbles it up! I feel good that she is getting awesome organic fruit in her cereal that doesn't have added sugar or color and it only took me a few seconds to get it prepared for her.

review/text: Happy Family Pouches are so convenient, healthy and easy for little ones to use. Like most households, our mornings are super crazy and these are so perfect to use on the go and in the car. Banana Kiwi is one of our favorites. I love that all of the products are Organic and GMO-Free. I also thought that the price was very reasonable and would definitely order this again. Try mixing a bit of it into Happy Family Organic Oatmeal for a new twist on breakfast for the kids. Happy Family is a must have in our house :)

review/summary: Great flavor combination
review/text: We're big HappyBaby fans here, and this flavor pouch is one of my favorites for my son, who is now two. I tried to make my own baby food for him when we were first introducing solids, but I had trouble finding all the fresh organic fruits and vegetables during certain times of the year -- and apricot was one of them. I would have never thought to combine apricots and sweet potatoes on my own, but the combination works! I love that it is really nutrient dense and an easy snack for on the go. My son is in the picky-eater phase and these pouches help get the veggies in! I also think this pouch is the reason behind his current love of dried apricots :) Overall, this is a great flavor combination and a super nutritious food for little ones.<br /><br />I don't find that these pouches are runny like other commenters have mentioned, FYI.

review/text: I ordered this product when my baby was starting solids and loved that it had the sweet potato and apricot combo.  What a unique blend.  He is now 16 months and it is one of his favorite HappyBaby flavors.  In fact, he just gobbled one up at lunch today.  He is at the age where giving him snacks on the go is difficult.  I don't always have time to do a bib and highchair for snacks.  I can give him this pouch and it keeps him satisfied until lunch or dinner, and I know he is consuming food that is good for his growing body!

You don't need a spoon and they don't make a mess. I hardly have to wipe my 11 month old daughter's face when we are done. I am a fan! I also love that I can screw the top back on and stick it in the fridge if she doesn't finish the whole thing. The best part is that my daughter is getting organic fruits and veggies, and she loves it!

review/text: I love all of the HappyBaby pouches because of their fresh taste and healthy ingredients. My toddlers love feeding themselves with these.

This is one of my favorite flavors to use because of the health benefits of blueberries and beets (plus my little ones love the taste!) HappyBaby makes it so easy to introduce my kids to a wide variety of fruits and veggies.

review/summary: Update: Runny Consistency Good on the Go!
review/text: My daughter loves this (as well as every other Happy Baby food she has tried)! The only reason I docked a star is because the consistency is thin. I normally mix all of her Stage 2 foods with cereal, so it's not a big deal for us. However, if your baby eats this straight, try one of the various "squeezie" spoons on the market. It is too runny to use a traditional spoon.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I changed my rating to five stars. Yes, it's still a bit runny. However, I have found this to actually be a good thing.<br /><br />My daughter is almost seven months old. We were out the other day, and I had a pouch of this food in the diaper bag. I had just gotten her seated for lunch when I realized that I'd forgotten her bowl, spoon, and cereal to mix with the food. I decided to let her try to "eat" it directly from the pouch. (We both drink homemade green smoothies a lot. The consistency is similar.) It was great! She was easily able to suck it out of the pouch, with me holding the pouch, making sure that there was always food near the opening. She only spilled a tiny bit onto her bib. It also took less than five minutes for her to eat!<br /><br />I am going to keep a pouch of this food in the diaper bag from now on. It's great that I don't have to worry about carting a bowl, spoon, and container of cereal anymore. However, I will continue to mix it with cereal at home.

review/summary: Used to be the only way I could get veggies down my baby!
review/text: Before trying these pouches, I would attempt to hide veggies in my daughter's baby cereal and fruit puree.  I could put the tiniest bit in her bowl and she would always detect it.  I'm sure she would have survived without veggies, but it still bothered me that she wasn't eating any.  (It's a mom thing I guess!)  I saw these in the store and thought that the combinations of fruits and veggies in these looked "interesting."  I picked up a few, not really expecting my little one to like them.  However, she really liked them - a lot.  Maybe it has something to do with the fact that they come in a pouch that she can feed to herself.<br /><br />Not only were these great to give her as an infant, she still enjoys these as a toddler.  These are great to take with on outings - when it's otherwise difficult to give her produce.  She can eat these without making a mess and we don't have to worry about spoilage.  So far, she has liked all of the flavors.  I like the fact that these aren't stored in plastic or in jars with BPA.  I wish that these would have been available years ago.  :)

review/text: These pouches are wonderful to keep in the diaper bag. They do not require refrigeration or heating so it's great for on the go. My son likes to hold the pouch and feed himself (warning: I always put it in his mouth for the initial squeeze or else he will squeeze so hard it flies in the air).  I also use them in the house for those days when he says no to all other foods. He has never turned down one of these pouches. Figure it's more nutritious than eating goldfish crackers for a meal.

He loves these purees, he'll eat any flavor and they seem quite natural and healthy.

They are also super portable and conveniently stored.

I used it on her almond butter sandwiches instead of jelly. So I thought the consistency was fine.<br />The taste was obviously delicious as my daughter didn't even notice the difference. Plus organic, no GMO, BPA free...can't really beat that.

I started cooking for him since he was 5 months old and he ate well but something happened when I went back to work and he no longer accepts "good" food. However, he happily ate entire pack of HappyBaby Spinach, Mango & Pear and asked for more two days in the row! My husband is a Mr. Mom for now so weight off his shoulders as far as feeding. We ordered other flavors and hoping trend with eating organic veggies and fruits will continue with our picky eater.

review/summary: Wanted so badly to like it
review/text: My 8 month old has eaten nearly on the flavors of ellas, happy baby/tot, and sprout meals.  This one is so tart, she shuttered with a sour face and then started to cry- something that NEVER happens.  I tasted it and it is pretty sour (I like sour), perhaps overwhelmingly so for a fresh pallette (not a beat up adult one). I served it along with a savory meal and she was fine with that but I wont be buying it again.  May be good for an adult smoothie where you want some tang.

review/summary: Son eats ALL HappyBaby products EXCEPT this one
review/text: My son has been gobbling these pouches down since he was just over a year old (he's now 2 1/2).  They are such a fantastic way to get quality foods into picky bodies.<br /><br />However, this is the only combo that he has refused to eat.  I've tried it multiple times, and he continues to leave the pouch full after taking just one sip.  The rest he will slurp down until even the air is out of the package ;)<br /><br />I'd order any of the other combinations if I were you.

review/summary: Best way to keep my toddler eating his veggies!
review/text: My son has a very high gag reflex and transitioning to solids has been a task.  However, he also won't have anything to do with homemade baby food anymore.  We found these pouches when buying food for a trip and he was hooked.  I like that the veggies are organic, the pouches produce little garbage, that he can feed himself, but most importantly, that it is keeping the taste of veggies in his diet while we slowly work on chewing veggies.

review/text: This is the best raspberry jam I have ever tried and I have tried a lot. I make raspberry bars (frequently) and so I was on a quest to find the best raspberry jam. I bought several brands and tried them all side by side. No other brand came even close to Maury Farms. It tastes of fresh delicious raspberries and is not overly sweet as many of the other brands were. The flavor was incomparable and the seedless was just as good as the one with seeds so I buy seedless when I can find it. This is delicious.

This is probably because I live in California where we grow citrus and don't want any imported pests (we have enough pests of our own already :-).<br /><br />Note that the post mark on this was Thailand.<br /><br />The seller should have know this and not sold to me.<br /><br />I guess it is OK if you live in some other state.

review/summary: A slight let-down
review/text: We decided to purchase Weber N'Orleans Cajun Seasoning because we figured if it boasted the New Orleans name, it had to be good stuff.  But, we were slightly let down by the overall spiciness of this seasoning.<br /><br />The first time I used it, I just used a little on the fish I made.  This was because in the past, some Cajun flavored foods were very spicy, and when I smelled the spice after opening it, it smelled strong.  But as we ate the fish, we could barley taste the Cajun!<br /><br />This spice is good for those who don't want an overpowering or highly spicy Cajun flavoring.  Sometimes I myself like that, but if I'm using Cajun, I usually want it to be bold.<br /><br />Add a little extra paprika alongside this seasoning and it greatly enhances it.<br /><br />Overall it isn't terrible, but it isn't as bold as one might expect from a N'Orleans Cajun.

review/text: It seemed like a good idea. Buy in bulk and save some cash, but as it were being shipped it must have warmed up and cooled down. Many of them were stuck together, and colors rubbed off on each other. There was a 2lb mass of beans in the box! Also, beware and don't freak out because the package consists of a cardboard box and jelly beans. No plastic inside the box, no paper lining, nothing. Kind of creepy, but I'm not dead yet, so it must be okay.

Was concerned following the other review about beans sticking together, but decided it'd be worth it to have 10 flavors.  Box arrived and they were stuck together, but only 5 flavors.  A waste of my time.  Never would have ordered if product had been described correctly by the seller.  Just drive to the store and get the 5 flavor mix that's not already stuck together.

review/summary: As Homer would say, "Mmmmm, Chorizo"
review/text: When I was an exchange student living in Spain almost 10 years ago, I fell in love with the food there, most especially the chorizo. When I got back to the US, all I could find was mexican chorizo which is *not* the same as and is *completely* different than spanish chorizo. I eventually found some US-made spanish-style chorizos but none of them was quite like what I had in Spain. This is the real deal. This is exacly what I remember from Spain. And the funny thing is, that much of the chorizo I had in Spain was homemade chorizo in central/southern Spain (Ciudad Real to be exact) but this brand comes from northern Spain. This is definitely the best chorizo I've had in the US and is perfect for making any spanish dish that calls for chorizo, including lentejas (lentil stew), paella, and migas (fried bread crumbs with various meats served on the side). It is also outstanding to eat as is--I know I could eat a whole chorizo in one sitting if it wasn't so expensive but that's the price of imported gourmet foods.

review/text: Love that this really is a natural product AND it is cheaper than buying other brands in my local stores.  Other brands contain preservatives and "Guar Gum" (whatever that is!)  Used this in a Thai dish the day the box arrived, and we have even made cocktails with it!  Great ingredient for Thai & Indian dishes and a wonderful alternative to cow, soy, or almond milk.  If you have problems with the coconut & water separating, simply shake the can before opening (as I discovered with other brands, I don't know how badly this one separates).  Wish that coconut milk was sold in cartons like chicken stock is - I use this so frequently that keeping the rest of the can would be much easier in a carton.<br /><br />Update: the price for this has tripled since I purchased it.  If the price doesn't go back down before I run out, I will try the Trader Joe's Light Coconut milk, which costs $0.99/can.

The flavor of this hot sauce is interesting and different, and I like it.  It also has a pleasing saltiness and tanginess to it.  As for the heat, neither is it too hot nor too mild.

review/summary: Very yummy.
review/text: I bought these along with the Razzmatazz drops and the cinnamon is very good also. The flavor is just strong enough that you get a good idea that it is cinnamon your eating. I like eating one of these right after a meal to get the minty feel in my mouth.  I like the idea that I can still satisfy my sweet tooth and feel good that there isn't any really bad stuff in this product. I'm looking forward to trying many of the other flavors that YummyEarth has come up with! Enjoy!

review/summary: jolly rancher fruit smoothie jelly beans the best i've ever tasted
review/text: as a rule i do not eat sweet things but this past easter i asked my significant other to try to get some cream filled chocolate covered easter eggs and some jelly heans. the kind that are sweet and taste like they have suger. not the jelly beans that have a spicy flavor. well, she come home with these pastel jelly beans i had never seen before. i ate a chocolate cream filled easter egg and then opened the bag of jolly rancher fruit smoothie jelly beans. well, it's been awhile since easter and i am addicted to these very specially flavored jelly beans. i have to say stop when i get started eating them. now remember that i said i don't often eat sweets. i'm not especially fond of them. but these jolly rancher fruit smoothie jelly beans are delicious. the only problem, after easter was passed she couldn't find but one more bag of them in the whole area where we live. well, i had the bright idea to check online at amazon.com. if you need something i always think of checking here first. sure enough, amazon.com had jolly rancher fruit smoothie jelly beans. now i just have to wait until morning and have my s/o buy me a package of 6 or 9 for my upcoming birthday. that would be so nice. you see i am down to less than 1/3 of a bag. i've been rationing them. now that i have a source, i feel reassured that my supply could become endless. now i still am not going to gorge myself on them. i just will enjoy them as a treat without the worry that there will always be more available and i don't have to wait until easter.

review/summary: Not as good as the original flavors but still okay
review/text: We love the original Jolly Rancher jelly beans. They are some of the best out there with extremely bold flavors. I thought these would be just as great but with a subtler, creamier flavor. This isn't really the case. The flavors are still very strong, they are just... odd. A few are really good but the majority leave a strange aftertaste. We ended up mixing these in a bowl with the regular kind to get them eaten because if we have the original kind around, everyone goes for those first, but we won't be buying them again. They aren't bad, necessarily, just not as good as the original flavors.<br /><br />If you are looking for something different but like the original flavored Jolly Rancher jelly beans, I would go ahead and say to give these a try. But if you are trying to decide between these and the originals, go for the originals all the way.

review/text: I ordered this Coffee-mate Caramel product because I could not find it in any of the stores in my area. I bought the 6-pack because each container comes with an inner seal, so they stay fresh if not opened. The taste is excellent, the delivery was quick, the packaging was great, and the cost was less that if I had bought the same product in a retail store if I had found it. So, I am very happy with this purchase!

review/summary: Possible Quality Control  or Formula Change Issue
review/text: I have ordered this product many, many times and was always VERY pleased with it.  However, the last shipment, ordered in January 2010 was altogether unsatisfactory.  This shipment had little of the expected wonderful flavor and sweetness; I opened two of the six containers and both are different than all previous orders.  I do not not whether the formula has been changed or whether this is a failure in quality control.  I do know that I will not take a chance and order this item again.  I plan to report this issue to Amazon so that they are aware of my experience.

review/summary: Yes!
review/text: At the very least 4 Stars! Once the right amounts are figured out this coffee creamer is every bit as good as the fine amazon reviewers had mentioned. Might sound like I am a chemistry wannabee but it is imperative that the right amount is used, for too much is not half as good and too little also spells failure in the taste department. It probably deserves half a star more but the doctor is still out so for now 4 Stars, which is above average, stands in solid grounds. One thing I have found out that depending on the coffee I use (I use ground coffee in an old gevalia, cheap monkey that I am) the ratio changes. But once the right amounts are used this product elevates itself. Since sugar was a concern it is good that the free enterprisers of this beautiful country are seeing fit to consider the needs of those that wanna say bye bye to sugar (I use to go to the movies with a couple of pounds of See's Candies and with one or two avid chocolate lovers besides me, finish the whole thing! So is no wonder I seek sugar free as a norm) and cut down drastically on such a seriously unhealthy consumption. 4.5 Stars for Coffee-Mate Vanilla Caramel, Sugar-Free Powdered Coffee Creamer, 10.2-Ounce Units (Pack of 6). Yes!

review/text: I was hooked on sugar-free french vanilla Coffee-Mate until I tried this flavor. This blows the french vanilla out of the water! It still has that wonderful vanilla flavor, but the caramel just gives it a little extra something. It smells great, too. I wish I could find this scent in a candle. I would love for my kitchen to smell like this...LOL  In my opinion, this is Coffee-Mate's best flavored creamer.

review/text: Ordered this tea as well (as the pumpkin spice variety) as favor gifts for an autumn bridal shower. The apple cider tea has a great apple flavor, but has different spices than the traditional apple spice variety which makes it unique. My husband is a huge apple cider fan and really liked this tea.  Traditional apple cider is a bit too acidic for me, and this tea is a welcome alternative! Would definitely recommend!

The apple-cider taste is strong enough that you really enjoy it.  You can also really taste cloves and spice.  This tea and a piece of (my) home-made pumpkin pie, on a cold, damp Baltimore night--mmmmmmmmm--to die for!<br /><br />Ingredients (in this order): apple, hibiscus, cinnamon, natural apple flavor with other natural flavors (soy lecithin), orange peel, lemon peel, rose hips, licorice root, clove, natural apple cider flavor with other natural flavors (soy lecithin).<br /><br />No caffeine.  You really don't need sugar, unless you just want it sweeter.<br /><br />I suggest 2 bags per 24 oz hot water.

review/summary: Tastes like apple, not cinnamon!
review/text: I love apple cider and apple cider teas, but it is hard for me to find one without chamomile (which I am allergic to) and without an overpowering cinnamon flavor. This is a great tea that has neither of those problems.  This is a nice mildly sweet apple tea with a slightly tart aftertaste.  It smells of cloves, but the taste isn't overwhelming.<br /><br />As other reviewers have said, this tea can end up pretty light/thin, but if you steep it longer or use 2 bags, it should turn out fine. It's great with a little sugar or mild honey.<br /><br />Another thing to note, the expiration date on the boxes is very good.  I received the 6-pack of boxes October 2012, and the expiration/sell by dates on the boxes are for 2015. Because this is a seasonal tea, and hard to find in stores year-round, it was worth buying the pack of 6.
