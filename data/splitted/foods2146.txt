review/summary: Surprisingly enjoyable - perfect blend of nutrition and sweet flavor
review/text: I've always heard about the many healthy drinks that V8 has made in the past. Many of the vegetable drinks (particular with tomato) made me go "blah." But, the V8 fusion is a brilliant selection of nutrition drinks. Now, I can snap open and enjoy a refreshing drink, but also have a full serving of vegetable and fruits in every can. I am thoroughly impressed at the improvement that V8 has made. I'm convinced, and so are my family and friends whom have tried this drink at gatherings.<br /><br />Some other thoughts:<br /><br />* No Sugar, not preservatives, just 100% vegetables and fruits.<br />* Actually tastes good. I feel this is in part with the fruits. In the past, putting vegetables in drinks alone didn't work for me. The fusion of vegetables and fruits is a perfect match.<br /><br />Be careful with how many you drink! Before you know it, you'll be chugging these things like water. But, that's not such a bad thing anyway. Highly recommended for craving for a sweet drinks, parties, and a drink with nutrition on-the-go.

review/text: This is absolutely my favourite of the Yogi Teas I've tried.  It's got a lot of body without being bitter, and works well with and without milk.  Having stevia means that it doesn't need sugar, but isn't too sweet.  Rather than tasting like a typical herbal tea, this makes a good, caffeine-free substitute for standard tea and coffee.

review/summary: Tea for a coffee lover
review/text: My wife and I both love coffee, and tea to a lesser extent. I've realized over the years that my preference for coffee is largely due to two factors: the strength of the flavor, and the 'thickness' of the drink. This is one of the few teas that rivals coffee in both departments. That's not to say it tastes anything like coffee--it is strong and aromatic, but sweet and almost nutty, not acidic or tending towards bitter. The hazelnut and vanilla flavors mingle quite nicely in this dark, expressive tea. Yogi makes some really fine teas, including this one.<br /><br />If you like substantial flavor in your teas, give this one a try. My wife and I both really enjoy it.

review/summary: If you like your tea spicy...
review/text: This tea should be more accurately called "Tahitian Ginger Ginger" tea.<br /><br />It tastes like ginger and cinnamon and....that's it. No hazelnut or vanilla that I could detect. If (like me) you are really not a fan of ginger you will be disappointed. In my case, after choking down the first cup, I had resolved that I must throw the rest of the box away because it was just way too spicy and gingery for me. Very unpleasant.<br /><br />However, I decided to give it another try. I steeped the tea only briefly, less than 30 seconds, as opposed to 3-4 minutes, and I added two splashes of milk (instead of my usual one) and also, I added a little more stevia than usual. Anyway, the result was... a nice cup of tea that I enjoyed. I've had the tea a few more times in this same way and I actually do like it now and might even consider buying it again. Still the advertising for this tea is so strange (the main flavors are not in the title), and the tea is so strong and harsh that I feel the need to warn others. If you do try it, and dislike it like I do, steeping it for less time will go a long way....

review/summary: surprise!  i really like this stuff.
review/text: i'm not usually a big vanilla or super sweet-tea fan but with the colder weather i've found myself gravitating to heartier, sweeter and more dessert-like beverages. i was craving hot chocolate and decaf coffee a lot but didn't like the chocolate tea i bought and am too lazy to make a good cup of decaf most of the time.  i thought i'd give this yogi tea a try, although it's not technically a tea as it's chicory based, no tea leaves (green, white, black or roiboos-red) hence the name "herbal supplement."  not being able to tolerate caffeine i've become a bit of a connoisseur of decaf teas.  usually i prefer black tea decaffeinated (like earl grey or irish b'fast) and i steer away from herbal infusions/supplements, especially the sweeter or fruiter kinds. however, i'm a big spice fan, just about any spice (pepper is one of my favorites and even that's in this tea.)  i'm not finding any of the flavors in this tea at all overpowering.  and it's not sugary sweet either.  the stevia is a nice touch, not too much.  it reminds me of celestial seasonings "bengal spice" with a little bit of sweetener.  checked the ingredients and the only difference is that the yogi tea also has the stevia, hazelnut and a bit of butterscotch.  i like that many of the ingredients in this are organic, and none taste fake.  i like it with milk, soy milk especially cause it's just a tiny bit sweeter that way and i really don't feel like i need to add anything else.  since i like this yogi tea a tad better than bengal spice but i'm a sucker for the pretty tiger illustration on the bengal spice box, maybe i'll keep their cute box and put these teas in it!

review/summary: an herbal tea with body
review/text: One of my favorite herbal teas is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OI5VTW">Celestial Seasonings Roastaroma</a>, and one reason I like it is because it's about as full-bodied as an herbal tea can be. But I wanted something a bit sweeter and lighter to drink in the evening, including before bed and on occasion as an after dinner beverage, so I decided to try Yogi Tea Tahitian Vanilla Hazelnut Tea. The first four ingredients of Roastaroma are roasted barley, roasted chicory, roasted carob, and cinnamon, and it is the chicory that gives Roastaroma it's coffee-like full-bodiedness, as chicory is often used as a coffee substitute. Tahitian Vanilla Hazelnut does not have barley in it, but its first three ingredients are roasted chicory root, carob pod, and organic cinnamon bark, and I assume this accounts for why I consider it to be in a similar herbal tea category as Roastaroma. Some of the sweetness of Tahitian Vanilla Hazelnut comes from stevia leaf. I'm drinking a cup now, sweetened with half a packet of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003PMSTTE">Truvia Natural Sweetener</a> and cooled with a dash of fat-free milk. Sometimes I sweeten it with a little raw sugar. And I find it delicious and satisfying, with a nice, mildly spicy aftertaste that I assume comes from the organic black pepper, clove bud, and organic ginger root that are among the ingredients of this fine tea.<br /><br />Tahitian Vanilla Hazelnut also contains organic cardamom seed, and thus this tea contains the five traditional Ayurvedic spices, cardamom seed, cinnamon bark, clove bud, ginger root and black pepper, which were among the ingredients in the prototype "Yogi Tea" that Yogi Bhajan shared with his students after he arrived in America in 1969. (It wasn't until 1984 when the Yogi Tea Company that brings us Tahitian Vanilla Hazelnut and other fine teas was formed.) One can get a sense of the care with which Yogi Teas are made by visiting their website and/or YouTube and watching the video of Yogi Tea's herbalist, Guru Hari Khalsa, explaining the Yogi Tea philosophy.<br /><br />I purchased a pack of 6 boxes of Tahitian Vanilla Hazenut tea bags through Amazon's easy to manage Subscribe & Save program on 9/25/11, and each box arrived with a "best by" date of June 2013 on it, which is a good long time from the time of purchase. (16 bags per box x 6 boxes = 96 cups of tea, a little over a 3-month supply for someone who drinks one cup a day.) One of the most satisfying herbal teas I've had, and I speak as someone who worked in the natural food industry before it was an industry and has been drinking herbal teas for 4 decades.

review/text: I purchased one box of this locally so I could try it first, but I'll begin getting it here by the case since it's so delicious! I'm trying to cut back on caffeine/sugar and have been drinking a few cups of coffee daily for years. I can't drink it w/o sugar so I was looking for a tea that would be close enough for me to not feel deprived. This is fantastic!! The flavors are so warm and spicy that I can easily drink it w/o sugar. I add just a splash of vanilla almond milk, and for me, it soothes me in the same way that coffee did, maybe even more so. It's still in the upper 90's here, but sipping this makes me feel like it's cloudy and 55 degrees outside. That feeling alone is worth the price of this tea. Love it!!

review/text: This was an impulse buy at my local Turkish grocery store. I dipped strawberries in it! Yum! Great fruit dip. I dipped some ginger snaps in it and it was yummy. It was even better on top of graham crackers. It would also be great on top of hot cinnamon rolls instead of the sugar topping, which is my next experiment (I'm going to go the lazy route and use the pre-made ones from the grocery store). It would also be delicious as icing on a pumpkin roll, on top of a carrot cake, on a spice cake, on cupcakes, between layers of cake - do you see a cake theme? Also, it would be a great filling for any of the homemade pop tart recipes that are going around the internet. Also, a great filling for doughnuts. Or as the filling for one of the stuffed french toast recipes. Or, spread on top of Ritz crackers. I could go on, but I think you get the point. Buy it, it's versatile, it's yummy, it begs you to experiment with it.<br /><br />EDIT: Oops, I just realized that I have the Ulker Golden brand and not the Armella. I'm sure that they're extremely similar. They're both labeled "Findik Ezmesi."

review/summary: Out of Stock?!?!?!?
review/text: I ordered these as stocking stuffers for 4 children (4 each of 3 designs).  The company, however, sent me a box of 12 candy dispensers shaped like the Wii-mote.  I have to say that they were helpful in this regard.  Although it took them several days to respond, they sent me a UPS label so I could return the Wii dispensers.  I was not happy, however, with several things.  First, they told me they could not do an exchange because this item (Nintendo Kliks) was out of stock.  That was only a week ago and it is still listed here on Amazon.  So either they lied to me or other customers are potentially ordering this item and won't receiving it.  It also really messed up  my "stocking stuffers" plan!  The other issue, is that this company tried to convince me to keep the 12 Wii-mote dispensers since supposedly they cost more than the Nintendo dispensers, so the price I paid was an "excellent" deal.  This added extra days to the process because I had to reply that I was not interested and then I had to wait for them to reply to my email, etc.  I would not order this item from this company without first checking with them to make sure it is in stock.  Update:  1/13/10:  This item is still listed on Amazon as "in stock"!  I think this company might have lied to me about them being out of stock b/c they didn't want to pay return shipping on the Wii dispensers and then pay again to ship the correct item to me.  I'm VERY disappointed. I DO NOT recommend this company, at all.

review/text: I originally tried this tea, and found it somewhat bitter - until I learned that green tea cannot be steeped in boiling hot water. Let the pot or your cup of water sit for 5-10 minutes, THEN add the tea bag for no longer than 2 minutes. PERFECTION! Best green tea ever!

review/summary: Good Tea, Flavor not as Strong as Regular Green Tea
review/text: I have been drinking Twinings teas for years.  Twinings teas are consistently good.  Each tea bag comes in a sealed envelope which helps to keep it fresh.  Over a period of time, I have settled on two favorites.  These are the Darjeeling and Green teas.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4F95C">Twinings Darjeeling Tea</a>: At one time, I used Twinings China Black Tea.  Unfortunately, they stopped selling that variety.  I tried others, but chose the Darjeeling tea for an afternoon tea and snack break.  It offers a nice strong flavor and deep color.  There is enough caffeine in this tea to provide a nice lift.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4DKAS">Twinings Green Tea</a>:  There are quite a few varieties of green tea offered by Twinings. I prefer the pure green tea.  Interestingly, according to the product blurb, green tea is made from the same leaves as is black tea.  The difference is in the processing.  Green tea is lighter in color and has a more subtle taste.  In general, green teas have less caffeine than the darker teas.  I find that the Green tea is good for early evening.  It has just enough caffeine to provide some energy but not too much to keep me awake at night. For later in the evening, I like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001LO3EM">Decaffeinated Green Tea</a>. The tea is good, even though the flavor is not as strongs as the regular green tea.<br /><br />I recommend both the Darjeeling and Green varieties of Twinings teas.

review/text: I was looking for minimally processed mulberries at a reasonable price, and this product fit the bill.  I was willing to pay a little extra for the organic label, however you have to take their word for it because the certification is not listed on the package.  The mulberries themselves are not overly sweet, are slightly chewy and still have their stems on in some cases - which to me indicates minimal processing and that they likely came right off the tree! Don't worry, the stems aren't a bother, I just eat them whole with some almonds or in a ground coconut and almond meal porridge in the morning.  Some more information about their origins would be nice (i.e. given their origins in Turkey, do we know they are not irradiated etc?), but otherwise I'm quite happy and would order again.

review/text: LMAO at these reviews. One guy says the "cheese and garlic are overpowering"<br />and another guy says you cant taste any cheese or garlic.

You can<br />even make Cream Chipped Beef on Toast with this stuff, and that makes a great<br />surprise breakfast with poached eggs.<br /><br />And to anybody that grew up eating "Tuna Helper" and is just too embarrased to<br />buy that box, this sauce + frozen green peas + fettucine and a can or two of<br />tuna and you are all set. Its better than it sounds.<br /><br />Course this stuff is also great for making a classic Alfredo. Impress your friends,<br />tell em its homemade.

review/summary: Good and creamy
review/text: This is a creamy sauce, with a mild but pleasant flavor.  It has just enough garlic to enhance the flavor, but not so much that it overpowers it.  I had it with spinach and cheese ravioli, which it complemented very well.  The pasta it would suit best would be fettuccine, which should be coated with the sauce by thoroughly mixing it.<br /><br />In addition to going well with vegetable pasta dishes, it would be good with shrimp, chicken or chopped ham.  With any of those, adding onion and mushrooms would help it along, and black pepper would top it off nicely.<br /><br />There is a slight but distinct garlic aftertaste, so you might want to be careful about socializing afterwards with anyone who has not shared the meal with you!

review/text: I'm seriously addicted to these.  The Chocolate Chip is amazing.  The Choco Lot tastes a lot like a brownie, especially when a bit warm.  I was concerned initially by the amount of xylitol (a sugar alcohol) as I'm sensitive to most sugar alcohols. And this has quite a bit (19gm). BUT one cookie doesn't seem to affect me - too much.  Love that they have protein (8gm in a cookie?!?!?) and fiber (2gm).  But mostly I'm hooked on the taste.  I prefer chewy cookies (vs the crunchy kind) so this is perfect for me. AND it's vegan. (Whole Foods bakes a mega-yummy vegan chocolate chip cookie but I know it's packed with sugar, certainly more than the 10gm in a Kookie Karma.)  The only suggestion I would make is to make them just a tad less sweet.  Guilt free indulgence :-)

Orange/tan in color and lacking that grassy taste that most green teas carry.<br /><br />Having said that, it's good value, arrived promptly, and will do just fine as an everyday drink - I just wouldn't serve it to company.<br /><br />Seems to work best with the water at no more than 160 to 170 degrees, steeped for only 1 minute. Will yield multiple 4-cup carafes during the course of the day. Just don't let it sit in the carafe /thermos for more than 3 hours - it gets bitter, as do most green teas, I have found.

review/text: This is quickly becoming our favorite green tea. Almost as soon as I've enjoyed drinking a large mug, I make another. Unlike other decaf greens we have tried, my wife doesn't ask for peppermint leaves or hibiscus blossoms or other natural flavorings in hers to offset unpleasantness. I have been searching for years for an unflavored decaf green with a good leaf and mouth feel. This is it.<br />  It's organic and CO2 (non-chemically) processed to boot. According to the tea company's site, "Our organic decaffeinated teas utilize a carbon dioxide rinse process to remove the caffeine, a process we feel leaves more of the tea flavor and leaf structure intact.  This process is also USDA approved for certified organic tea. 98% caffeine-free, these teas maintain much of the body and character of their caffeinated counterparts, and can be enjoyed all day."<br />  I certainly agree and gratefully tip my cup to Davidson's for making this healthy tea (as well as other loose decaf and regular teas) available to all. I also appreciate Amazon's subscribe/save program which is convenient, economical and user friendly. This is a tea I will be reordering ahead of schedule.

review/summary: Not necessarily for fighting cancer
review/text: 3 stars is probably too generous for this tea, but I've had good customer service from Davidson's. Also, it is wonderful that they offer not just decaf green tea, but organic teas and especially in bulk--all at a good price.<br /><br />As green teas go, this one has not had a great flavor, but it's drinkable.  I agree with another reviewerer that I wouldn't offer this to guests.  I drink green tea for its presumed health benefits.  Since a family member was diagnosed with cancer, I have learned (1) in general, Japanese green teas are much higher than Chinese in the cancer-fighting compounds (catechins) that most of us associate with green tea, and (2) in order to release those compounds, the advice is to steep tea for 7 - 10 minutes, and (3) decaf green has a lower amount of the compounds than regular.<br /><br />Davidson's decaf, at least the 6 or 7 pounds I have drunk, are drinkable after a very short brewing time (1 - 1 1/2 minutes, which is the company's advice).  Anything longer than that and it is too harsh and bitter for me.<br /><br />Just know what you're getting at this good price.  I have nothing against this tea, and I am delighted that Davidson's offers organic teas in bulk, but I have switched to a tea (exorbitantly priced) that is specifically blended for maximum catechin content.  Maybe it delivers, maybe it doesn't.  It is, however, delicious, as it should be at its price.  More info at [...]<br /><br />Also -- again if you're drinking green tea for the anti-cancer benefit, it may interfere with some chemotherapy regimens for blood-based cancers;  see [...]  All things are subject to more and more recent research -- I'm not a physician -- enjoy your tea and good health to you!

review/summary: Gluten Free Cafe Chicken Noodle Soup
review/text: I was looking forward to this gluten free soup because the picture looks great.  It does have a starchy taste which happens when noodles are not rinsed after cooking, they are probably cooking the pasta right in with the soup from the start rather than cook and rinse first.  It's hard to find any canned chicken noodle soup gluten free so this is a good start, with canned soup containing pasta starchy soft pasta is probably hard to avoid.<br /><br />Particularly because rice pasta is extremely starchy I have been partially cooking pasta separately and rinsing and keep in fridge, when heating soup or broth I just add the pasta at the end a couple of minutes prior to eating and it works best.  I got the idea from a restaurant serving soups as a gluten free option - they do not put pasta into the soup until just before serving to prevent mushy pasta.  I will probably go back to this method for soups with noodles but will definitely try some of the other Gluten Free Cafe soups that do not contain pasta.

review/summary: Great Soup!
review/text: My daughter loves noodle soups.  Since going gluten free, we have been without the convenience of canned soups for her.  We first found Gluten Free Cafe soup while traveling and she was thrilled.  It tastes great and good for you too!!  It doesn't have all the extra additives.  She'll even eat it straight out of the can if we're on a trip and can't heat it up!!<br /><br />So glad Amazon started selling it on the subscription plan!

review/summary: Terrible taste, fakey pasta
review/text: I was so excited to see GF chicken noodle soup. It's one of the "regular" foods that I've missed. Unfortunately this "soup" is terrible. The noodles were a very strange consistency (this coming from someone who has tried a LOT of GF noodles). The chicken was more like mystery meat, and there was very little of it. The overall broth didn't even taste good. I had a few bites, and literally dumped the rest down the sink. Don't waste your money.

review/summary: Awful, just awful.
review/text: My wife bought a couple cans of the gluten free chicken noodle soup month or so ago.  She tried two bites from one can and dumped the rest. Said it was terrible.  I ran across the second can on a shelf today and thought "It's chicken noodle soup.  How bad can it be?"  Well, it was really, really, really bad. Broth had an off taste and the chicken pieces were hard; almost like dried out but still crumbly.  Very strange texture.  Wouldn't give it a single star, it was that bad, but had to enter something.  Would have expected much better from a Hain product.

The only bad thing is that we found out he has several food sensitivities, one of them being onions (and possibly celery) :(. I wish there were more options out there without the onions in it...they are so hard to avoid unless cooking from scratch.

review/text: This soup is just wonderful!  Incredibly tasty, with a rich broth that's not overly salty like many canned soups, with big chunks of chicken, veggies and great tasting noodles.  It's better than ony other canned dhicken soup I've ever had in my life, even before I found out I had celiac disease.  I'm so excited to finally find a gluten free canned soup that compares to homemade for those times when I can't or don't want to cook.  The vegetable noodle and black bean are great too.

review/summary: Buyer Beware!
review/text: I foolishly bought this whole case because the reviews were so good and I could not find 1 can in a local store to try.  It was the WORST canned soup I have EVER tasted, it even smells sickening, like rotten garlic.  The noodles were complete greasy mush.  I had only 2 spoonfuls and have thrown the rest away.  Do not be fooled by the picture on the label, the contents do not even come close to looking like that.  Celiacs have enough trouble finding decent food, stay away from this product.

review/summary: I'm sticking with Progresso for GF soup
review/text: If you took a bunch of chicken broth, cut up one baby carrot, cooked 10 fettuccine noodles and cut them up, and cooked 1 small chicken breast, threw away 90% of it, and threw the remaining 10% in a pot with the aforementioned ingredients, you'd have a better version of this soup.  It's nearly all broth.  The chicken tastes way over-processed and rubbery.  And it costs about twice as much as a larger, heartier, tastier can of Progresso soup.  Trust me, I wanted to like this, as I haven't had chicken noodle soup in the 10 years since I've been diagnosed as a Celiac.  Well, I'll never crave this stuff again, so the only chicken noodle soup I ever eat again will be made by myself.<br /><br />The flavor isn't absolutely terrible (well, the chicken is), but for what you pay--even with the Amazon discount--it's a ripoff.  I'm glad I bought one can as a test before jumping into buying a 12-pack, because I'd have a hard time making it through 11 more cans of this stuff.  Step it up, Gluten Free Cafe.  And the picture on this can is hilarious-- I think if you took the whole 12 pack, boiled off the broth, and threw all the remaining ingredients into one bowl it may come close to resembling the picture.

review/text: I often have a pot of homemade soup or stew on hand.  For those times when I don't, or when I'm traveling, a prepared soup is sometimes just the answer to a quick, tasty, and hopefully nutritious meal.<br />The picture on this can piqued my interest, and into the cart it went.  The broth was thin and watery, and there was a slightly 'tingy' aftertaste.  Ugh.<br />Not a repeat product for me.<br /><br />(Kettle Cuisine makes an excellent product.  All varieties are very good.  It must be kept frozen though.  If you've never tried it, keep an eye out for it.  It tastes like you made it yourself.)

review/summary: Good, not great
review/text: For a gluten-free chicken noodle soup, I think this is the best on the market. I've tried some frozen kinds (mushy noodles and carrots, very little chicken), and this is a good, decent chicken noodle soup.  If at first the noodles seem hard and crumbly out of the can, heating the soup to a near-boil takes care of that, softening the noodles till they are nice and slurpable, just like "normal" chicken noodle soup.  The chicken portions are generous, to the point where I think they could have made them smaller, but it's tasty.<br /><br />Seasoning wise, at first it may seem peppery, but it actually isn't. If you're expecting it to taste as salty and metallic as Campbell's, you'll naturally be disappointed. Think of this as tasting halfway between the canned condensed kind and your Grandma's soup.  This is one of my staple pantry items, a go-to meal when I'm out of time or inclination to make a "real" meal. And calorie-wise, it's not too shabby---a whole can is just 180 calories.

review/text: My son has been gluten free for 2 months now and convenience foods are a god-send.  He has been craving soup and we were running tons of errands today and got home late.  I picked this up at a store a few weeks ago to have on hand for just such an occasion.  I broke it open, popped it in the microwave and he inhaled it!  It is expensive for soup, but if he loves it, it is super easy, and good for him too, I will definitely keep them on hand.  I tasted it too, and it is very tasty.  I didn't find the noodles soft or starchy at all.  They tasted like regular old noodles, and the broth was super tasty too.

review/summary: Don't believe the hype!!
review/text: I just recently switched to a gluten free diet and boy was I highly disappointed. I ordered this soup based on the comments of other users stating how tasty it was... don't believe the hype. It's quite disgusting.  First off, it's not set in broth but more of a creamy substance.  It was very salty so beware if anyone has high blood pressure.  The chicken bits tasted like rubber which I had to throw out... I guess for people who are solely on a gluten free diet, they don't have that many choices... thank god I'm not one of them.  I even gave some to my mother-in-law thinking maybe it's just me.  She didn't like it either.  I'm going back to my normal Campbell Chicken noodle soups.

(The one thing I don't like about these is that you have to microwave them for 5 1/2 minutes in order to get the noodles done, so it makes this really hot.  Personally I don't like my food at very high temperatures, so I end up putting these in the fridge to cool them down.  Just an FYI.)

A little sprinkle per dish goes a long way. And the two bags lasted more than a year now.  It tastes better than just typical curry powder. If you use it sparingly, it doesn't just make the dish completely like a curry dish, but adds more depth to the dish flavor.

The external box was not mangled - I have to believe this was a byproduct of the brittle, thin, flimsy individual plastic containers, in combination with having been shipped along with giant cashew tins in a large box with minimal packing materials. Although I think had the container packaging been sturdier this would not have been a problem. In any event, it was a disappointment that none of the packages arrived intact.

Unfortunately, it was only sold seasonally at World Imports.  I have searched everywhere for this wine. I even went to Monterey,California in hopes of purchasing more Truffle Merlot, but was not successful.  As you can probably tell, this is my all time favorite wine.  Imagine my excitement when I did a search on Amazon and found out that is going to be available soon.  I can't wait to start shipping it to my friends.

review/summary: Lemon Bars are a Real Crowd Pleaser
review/text: I had not been able to find Sunkist Lemon Bars by Betty Crocker in any local grocery stores. When my neighbor said that she would love me to bring my lemon bars to her party I didn't know where to turn. I found them on Amazon, and know that I will use every last box. They're that delicious.

review/summary: Betty Crocker Sunkist Lemon Bars
review/text: Boyfriend had been hinting about these bars and telling me how wonderful they were but couldn't find them anywhere. So for a "just because" item I thought I'd surprise him. He had been trying to find them around here but no one carried them. Only makers like krusteez or some other brand that just didn't taste right. So his face lit up when he opened the box. Thoroughly satisfied. He made some that night and they were great!

review/summary: Wow!
review/text: These are great! The crust is light and flaky, and the lemon filling is "to die for." I was always afraid they were horrible, and never bought them until I saw the great reviews. They taste as good as the freshly baked bars, that I love, and are super easy to make.

review/summary: Best ever Lemon Bar MIx
review/text: It was so nice to find these mixes on Amazon.  I have used them for years and over the past few years have had trouble finding them in my area.  Other mixes I've tried are nasty/artificial tasting.  The Betty Crocker-Sunkist mix is great!  They are easy to make - taste great and are easliy modified - Key Lime Squares, Lemon Cheesecake bars, etc.  Peggy (SC)

review/summary: slightly tart and delicious
review/text: love this mix, as well..they are absolutely delicious and taste like "from scratch"..my minor adjustments are that i grate the skin of one lemon into the mix and i use 1% milk, rather than water..i also bake the crust for about 8 minutes, then brush melted butter across the top, and continue baking for 4 more minutes, until it starts browning..makes a crispier and buttery crust.

review/summary: 10 stars from a lemon-bar fanatic
review/text: These are "to die far" lemon bars, especially if you substitute lemon juice for all the water in the instructions. They are excellent with water, but much more lemony with lemon juice (bottled is all I've ever used).
