review/summary: 5gum
review/text: 5gum<br />I like 5gum because it is good and comes in different flavors. It lasts a long time so you can be chewing on it for a long time. I buy 5gum because it leaves a good smell. If you have  bad breath or forgot to brush your teeth, chew 5gum. 5gum comes in many flavors. Apple, Spearmint, and Peppermint are a few of the flavors. I like 5gum because it lasts longer than any gum I've ever tried.<br />I don't like that some of the 5gum gets hard, but not so fast like the apple flavor.  5gum is not bad for your teeth. The best long lasting gum I've tried is 5gum. I would recommend it to others who like chewing gum, because 5gum is sugar free.<br />5gum is good for age 2 and above. The cost of 5gum is $1.19. You can get it at any gas station or grocery store. 5gum is good.

review/summary: Not so Great
review/text: By the end, I just couldn't wait to get rid of the gum. I'd buy either Trident or Orbit over 5 fruit flavors. They both last longer and have better flavor. The orange actually tastes pretty good, and the flavor lasts much longer. The other three start to disintegrate after just a couple of hours.

review/summary: Terrible raisins
review/text: I bought this thinking with M&M chocolate it had to be good. Well the nuts are good and the M&M's are good.  I do love raisins but these are the wors things I have ever had.  Realize that trail mix has a huge percentage of raisins so the money you put into this you better eat them. I have tried three times to eat these things.  I can't figure out what it is though.  The raisins have a fine coating of salt which is to much. Then after the salt there is another flavor I can't place.  It almost burns and almost has a metal taste.  Some kind of preservative?  What ever this additive is, it makes it impossible to eat a second raisin.  I'm going to see if I can return this to Sam's Club.  There is something wrong here.  Do you think they will take it back just because I say the preservative is bad tasting?  Hope so.  Otherwise I have to throw over 50% of the package out.

review/summary: Cheap, easy to open, and light weight Emergency Preparedness Food
review/text: Hey there retrodog (reviewer) - I use to eat this as a kid too. With mayo or Miracle Whip on white bread or toast. Lots of other great ways to use it too - in deviled eggs, or mixed with horseradish and stuffed into cherry tomatoes (add sliced olives to the top and it's even better). Mix with veggies to make a zingy tasting wrap. I've even known people to put it on their baked potatoes with sour cream. You can spice up mac & cheese with it too.<br /><br />In short: It's relatively cheap (3 sandwiches per 3 oz can), easy to open (pull top lid), and light weight (for back packs, lunch bags, and emergency "go" bags.<br /><br />In depth review:<br /><br />It may not be the healthiest item on the store shelves (relatively high in cholesterol and salt), but it is an excellent quick sandwich if you're in a hurry, very cheap (when you get it at a good price) for those who are on tight budgets (you can get 2-3 sandwiches per 3 oz can), it's also a great emergency food to keep in your home, and is also great for emergency "go" or "bug out" bags. These days, with threats of terrorism and so many natural disasters, an easy to pack, small, light weight source of calories is essential.<br /><br />It's more than 98% meat and fat from chicken and beef, which are 2 things (meat and fat) you want to eat if you're in an emergency situation (no other food available) and need protein and calories to keep you going. This way you're body does not eat its own muscle and fat, so you stay strong and warm until help arrives or you get yourself out of what ever situation you're in. Imagine Eskimos; they ate lots of meat and fat to keep warm in harsh conditions. I'm not saying you want to live on this stuff for months on end, but for a few days or a few weeks, it can save your life - it's cheap, easy to open, light weight emergency calories.<br /><br />Amour's Vienna sausage and sausage bits are also good for the same reason. Keep these, crackers (whole wheat is best), and canned fruit on hand ALWAYS, no matter where you live. Canned beans (any kind) and rice (if you can get moist prepared rice packets) are also good emergency foods. You never know when you might need to stay in for days or weeks at a time with no electricity and no outside contact, or you may need to bug out and live on your own, w/o shopping or going to restaurants for days or weeks.<br /><br />And yes, Amour potted mean is also a great treat for your cat. Although I can't tell if Pauline E. Nordin (reviewer) was attempting sarcasm when referring to cat food, or if she's really had to eat cat food or food that tasted like cat food due to financial distress, but our cats loved it. We use to give it to them once in a while treat when we were kids (50s and 60s). Again, a little too high in cholesterol and salt though (I wish they made a low salt version) so keep it as a once in a while treat only. That goes for you and your cats.<br /><br />What's a good price? You can usually find it on sale; three 3 oz cans for $1.00. At $19.08 for 48 cans that's just under 40 cents per can. Not a bad deal at all if you can't find the 3 for $1 deal near you. And if you belong to Amazon Prime (see PracticalWaysToSaveMoney to find out how to get Amazon Prime for free, we have a special link for Amazon.com related posts) you don't pay for shipping, which saves you money on gas instead of going out to a special store to find that 3 for $1 price. If you live in a very rural area and can't find the 3 for $1 price, or if getting out to shop is difficult for you, we recommend getting this deal at Amazon for sure.<br /><br />Don't need 48 cans? Ask your neighbors to buy in bulk with you. This is always a great way to save. Everyone saves, everyone has emergency food on hand. Win-win.<br /><br />How many cans should you keep on hand for emergencies? We recommend 2 cans for every 3 to 4 people in your household for each week of emergency food you want to keep on hand. For example, if you are a family of 3 and want to keep a 3 week supply of emergency food in the house (three weeks is now recommended by experts), stock 6 cans. That means one can will feed 3 people twice a week for 3 weeks. If there are 4 people in your family, bump it up to 12 cans and you can afford to eat a bit more or feed neighbors if need be (or your cats). You fill in the other meals with other canned emergency food of course.<br /><br />How long to keep? Some cans will show a "best by" date on the bottom. Some cans will show a date of manufacture. It depends on what facility is was packaged in. If it has a date of manufacture, according to Amour you're guaranteed good taste for a minimum of 2 years. But knowing this product, we'd say 3 years or more. Most cans with a "best by" date will have at least 2 to 3 years before you've come to that date (for example the can I bought this week expires in July 2014), but that doest not mean you can't eat it after that. According to Amour, as long as the can is sealed it's good "indefinitely", which is why it's a great emergency preparedness product. WTSHTF I'd eat a 15 year old can of potted mean over bugs any day if I were starving (thinking of those survival shows). But hopefully it will never come to that. And like all emergency preparedness foods, you should rotate on a first in first out basis. Eat the old stock before it gets to it's "best by" date and replenish with new stock. That goes for any food.

review/summary: It's Potted Meat, People... You Know it's Good
review/text: I grew up eating this stuff as a kid. We would put it on all kinds of stuff. Crackers, bread, tortillas, and whatever else it tasted good with. The small can was perfect for two kids (two sandwiches), and now is perfect for a grown adult. Amazon sells this pack of 48 cans. They are tiny cans but it's good stuff. Perfect for emergency food supplies. Think of it, a serving of meat in a tiny little can. This thing and a pack of crackers, and you're good to go.<br /><br />It's easy open too. And if you're hard up for a spreading tool, the lid can be bent to create one. Pure genius.<br /><br />And while some health nuts might complain about preservatives and salt, just remember that these are the very same things that keep it safe to eat and tasty. :-)

review/text: Milima Estate tea is famous for its quality.  This is a deeply soothing and nuanced tea that's easily detected among many others.  One must know how to properly brew tea as this isn't the tea dust you get in bags from the supermarket.  It takes 3 to 5 minutes of steeping because these are leaves not powder.  You can get the paper tea sacs from Amazon if you don't want to bother with a pot, but do give the tea time to release its flavor and you will be well rewarded.

Great with milk and a little sugar.<br /><br />If you've never brewed a proper cup of tea before, you will need a coffee press or heavy tea pot, preferable pre-warmed with hot water.<br /><br />You will also need boiling water.  I mean boiling.  No, that's not boiling.  I said BOILING.  As in it looks like it'll splash everywhere if it gets any hotter.  Anything less than a full roiling boil will make an insipid cup of tea.<br /><br />Use four tablespoons of tea per liter of water, let it steep three minutes, and you're there.

review/summary: Weak and lifeless. Worst of the Colombians.
review/text: As with most Green Mountain k-cups, this is weak and bland compared to any other k-cup. Highly disappointing. Just a splash of cream and the coffee turns almost white. If you like weak coffee, you will like this. If you like flavor, go with any other cup but this one. Even on the smallest cup setting this coffee is pathetic, and I cannot even imagine it on the other settings. The Dunkin Donuts, Puck, Starbucks, and other Colombians are far superior to this.<br /><br />Bottom line: Green Mountain Columbian is about as good as water with brown food coloring. My Siamese cat likes to drink coffee, and even he would not touch this. Good kitty.

review/summary: Notes from a Dunkin' drinker
review/text: I have been a dedicated Dunkin Donuts coffee drinker for years.  To frame how I feel about this Green Mountain Colombian K-Cup I feel it might be best to share how I go about making a cup of Dunkin' coffee when I'm at home.<br /><br />I use a coffee scoop to measure out my coffee.  To my tastes, the perfect home brew is 7 mounded scoops and 7 cups of water.  I put all this in my Cuisinart 1200 and come out w/ 6 cups of java bliss.  I use sugar and milk in my coffee; when I make my coffee as stated it get a satisfying mocha swirl of coffee and milk.  Just by sight I can tell my cup is rich.<br /><br />Now, using that as my baseline, I find this K-cup to be very satisfying.  I have tried MANY kinds of regular coffee K-cups, and this is the first one that makes a satisfying cup of full bodied coffee to my tastes.  Granted, I brew on the 6oz setting.  If you take your coffee black maybe you can get away w/ the 8oz setting.  The cup reminds me of my beloved Dunkin' (note I said reminds, its clearly not Dunkin' but I don't mean that in a bad way).  It doesn't end sharp or bitter like the very popular Coffee People Donut Shop.  It has a muted finish, reasonably full body for a K-Cup, and nice flavor.  When I pour in the milk, I can take more than a drop before turning the cup white - which tells me the cup is rich.<br /><br />Its my go to cup when I'm not brewing a pot.<br /><br />I love this stuff.  I highly recommend it if you like your drip coffee as I describe above.  Why not 5 stars?  Well, it doesn't taste like the Dunkin' I brew from a drip machine, that's why !  Its at least on the same field though ...

I have come across 3 K-cups so far that have either closed the water flow completely or allowed a very slow drip. My Kuerig has worked fine before and after those bad K-cups so I know it isn't my machine.

review/text: I'm not sure if I got a bad batch, but this does not make a good 8 oz cup like most other K Cups that I've tried.  I've had to reduce it to a 4 or 6 oz cup size to get a cup of coffee that is not like coffee flavored water.  I like a medium cup of coffee - not too strong or too weak.  I generally like the Green Mountain brand, but this is a weak, flavorless K Cup (and I have tried many, have found very few bad ones).

review/text: I am a bzzagent and received this coffee for free from bzzagent.I have been drinking my Green Mountain coffee fair trade k-cups for several days now and I am happy with them. I am so glad this coffee is fair trade but I wish the flavor was a little more to my liking - it has a little bit of a weedy after taste to it. I like how smooth it is but it has just a little back bite that would make me choose another coffee. It is not a bad drink, just not my favorite. This is definitely a medium to light roast coffee - if you want something darker, try the Sumatra Green Mountain cups. But if you like a more mild coffee that doesn't need much cream added to it, this is the coffee for you.

I liked the aroma it had a great taste, but I think it's more for people who enjoy a lighter cup of joe. I found it was great for like a mid-day coffee break. Like if you were looking for a not-too-strong/ not-too-light type of break. So if your that type, you'll definitely like it! Overall I enjoyed it but would've preferred a darker roast.

review/summary: I disagree with the reviews below
review/text: I knew this kit would have to be soldered / assembled.  As such, this is a great / fun project.  All the parts are well labeled and the manual is 34 pages with pictures and great instructions.  There are many projects with fewer instructions, poor component labeling, etc.  Many projects are completed in 5 minutes, making them very boring.  This project took an evening to assemble while we listened to music and I explained the workings to my kids.  This project came with 6 sections so that you could check your work along the way.<br /><br />As a note, for people who understand what electronic kit building is really about, check out the following: (transistor clock kit) [...] (ham radio kit) [...] and (oscilloscope kit) [...]<br /><br />I am not affiliated with Elenco, or any of these sites, I just love building kits.<br /><br />What we as hobbyists really need are more complex kits with SMD components for those "weekend builds".

review/text: Seems to be a quality product, especially for the price. Unlike some of the other raters, I read the description and knew this was a kit, the project lasted about 10 hours and the instructions were great! I would seriously recommend getting a solder sucker if you don't have one, mistakes are easy to make. There is one important thing to note! The instructions tell the user to compare the output to another accurate multimeter at multiple points to test the device and calibrate the variable resistors. I don't have one, but I was able to get it decently calibrated by using common voltage sources, a AA battery, a 5V and 12V power cable, and home voltage.

I found this brand at my local Publix, but not the beans nor the "supremo" line. I ordered it at Amazon and it arrived in a few days. I am very pleased.<br /><br />I should mention that I use a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AR7SY">Capresso 560.01 Infinity Burr Grinder, Black</a>, along with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000A8VUS">Bodum Columbia 12-Ounce Stainless-Steel Thermal Coffee Press Pot</a>. What a winning combination for me. The result is superior to anything you can buy at any of the coffee houses.<br /><br />P.S. My Bodum is very small because I am the only coffee drinker in the house and I just make one cup for myself. They come in larger sizes.

review/summary: Smooth Flavor
review/text: My husband and I are hooked on Columbian coffee because of it's smooth flavor.  We have tried a variety of brands of Columbian coffee prefer Millstone.  We also grind our own beans prior to brewing the coffee for a more fresh taste.  Prior to grinding the beans we mix 1/2 regular and 1/2 decaf coffee to be a little more health conscious.

review/summary: love the flavor
review/text: I have used this brand of coffee for a long time. The flavor is robust and mellow. I like the whole bean better than the ground so I can grind it the way I like it. I have tried the frence roast whole bean also, and it is a fuller bodied flavor but still smooth. I like the colombian better for a everyday drink because I can vary the strength to my mood for the day.

review/summary: Outstanding coffee
review/text: Millstone's Colombian Supremo is a medium rich blend - these beans were fresh and are ground every morning for our first cups of the day - really starts the day off right.  It has been difficult to track this coffee down but once I found it on Amazon and was able to put it on a two month re-order it turned out to be very competitive in price and available when we need it - problem happily solved.  Since we order 10 lbs at a time, I would be happy to received it in, say, 5 lb bags, but I'll take it any way I can get it - have not found another coffee we like as well.

review/summary: The Best Coffee
review/text: I have been enjoying Millstone Colombian Supremo Coffee for years. It became unavailable in our area for a time. I ordered it online from another company but Ive found Amazon.com to be the most reasonable and accommodation is awesome. The beans are fresh and on time delivered to my door once a month. It really is a good full flavored coffee without that bitter taste. Grind your beans right before you brew and buy these great beans.

review/summary: A good, average whole bean coffee
review/text: This grinds nicely; smells good; slightly acidic; a little bland overall - but you can drink it anytime and will not likely displease.<br />Quality of this order was fine and promptly delivered. I usually grind whole beans and brew in a french press.  I would rate 8 O'Clock Columbian coffee as slightly richer tasting and a better value.

review/summary: Very Mediocre
review/text: These beans are so mediocre... I don't know how they get such good reviews. The beans are definitely roasted beyond medium roast. They are dark, slightly oily, and produce a dark grind. The flavor is not so good, either. There is no hint of any nuttiness common to other Columbian beans. The roast is dark enough to bring out some of the oil from the beans, which promptly becomes rancid and ruins the flavor. There is very little depth to the flavor... all that lingers is the rancid taste. Honestly, I was reminded of Folger's coffee when I drank this.

review/summary: Great for big dogs, too!!
review/text: My dogs love these treats-one is a Red Heeler and the other a Lab/Great Dane mix and these are the perfect size for training, rewards throughout the day and to get my 60 pound puppy into her crate at night-we practice sit, stay and down and then "go to bed" and she gets 3 more. I like the smaller size so don't feel that I am loading them up with calories-I have purchased the regular Bil Jac's and cut them in half but these are the best size for us.  My Red Heeler is not that food motivated and he loves these (he could care less for cracker type treats or Beggin Treats, etc.) These are the perfect size, they love them and the cost is good-if you want a healthier treat and have deep pockets then try Primal Jerky Chicken Nibs-also a small size but my dogs flip over them even more(doggie crack) but they are $17 a bag....So try these, your dogs will love them!!

But it is also good as a little treat when you are out on the road or at the dog park as well.  Definitely get these and also try their other product called Yapple Nanas...my dog goes crazy for them too!

review/summary: Good for puppies who can't chew hard biscuits yet
review/text: My dogs go crazy for these............Bil-jac is their all time fav treats. My dogs prefer the soft treats over the hard ones, but I only found this out not to long ago when I got a new puppy. I realized he wasn't eating the treats I was giving him, so I decided to give these soft treats a try. And I am so glad I did! Not only does the puppy love them to death, but my adult dogs do too. They ALL go crazy for these. They wag their tails like mad and will do just about any command I ask with these in my hands. I have never seen my dogs get so excited over a treat like I did when I first opened a bag of Bil-jac. It's truly amazing!<br /><br />I've always given my dogs a treat since they were puppies with potty training, so they are used to getting a treat everytime they come in from outside. The minute we step foot in the house, they all line up in front of the cabinet and sit there like perfect little soldiers waiting for their Bil-jac. It's the cutest thing. They just love them!! They love all of the Bil-jac flavors too not just these.<br /><br />If you are ever looking for something just like these, the tractor supply store has a similar brand called "retriever". They are the same as these, just a little smaller, but only come in the liver flavor, but they are a really good price like these too. I buy both of them whenever I can.

review/text: The reviewer who says that these are not the most nutritious treats in the world is probably right, but so far I haven't come across any other conveniently-packaged-sold-in-pet-stores-everywhere small treat that my dog likes half as much! They work perfectly as training treats as far as my dog is concerned. (Sorry, I don't have a cute video to prove it. LOL. But it's like magic... I can show him one of these treats, tell him "boxy time!" and he runs up the stairs and into his crate for bedtime.) I'm sure it's not any unhealthier than the processed, additive-soaked, non-organic foods that I must confess that the human members of my family eat.

review/summary: That's Nuts!
review/text: Supposedly, Crunchy Nut has been available in England for quite some time and Kellogg's finally decided to bring it over to US shores.  Kellogg's used to make "Nut & Honey Crunch", though it was discontinued a while ago. Like Crunchy Nut, they came in both flakes and "Os" versions. I have fond memories of eating Nut & Honey Crunch in the 80s, and missed it when it was discontinued. Remember the "Nothin' Honey" commercials? ;)<br /><br />Well, if you want to relive those days, give Crunchy Nut a try. To the best of my taste buds' recollection, the crunch and flavor are nearly identical. There is the sweet tang of the honey coating and satisfying texture of the peanut-sprinkled corn flakes. The flavor is comparable to frosted flakes, but with honey and nut flavors. It holds up well in milk, retaining it's crunch down to the last bite. Comparing ingredients and nutritional information from their respective boxes shows that they match up pretty closely there as well, though the serving size for N&H is 2/3 cup and for CN it is 3/4 cup. If anything, ounce for ounce, Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut Flakes looks a little healthier for you than Nut & Honey Crunch.<br /><br />That's not to say it truly healthy though. Sure, it is fortified with the usual assortment of vitamins and when eaten with milk you fill even more of your daily nutritional requirements. However, it is still laden with sugar, molasses, honey and High Fructose Corn Syrup. My taste buds must have changed a bit since the 80s because it is almost too sweet for me. Blame it on a steady diet of low sugar cereals over recent years. I would have a hard time eating this regularly first thing in the morning. Instead, I mimic a habit of my father's and eat a small bowl of it in place of dessert. You could even mix it with other cereals that contain less sugar (as my dad would do).<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, Crunch Nut tastes great on it's own, and if you have a sugar/crunch craving, it hits the spot. It even makes a good breading base for fried chicken. I just no longer have quite the sweet tooth I once did. I give Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut Flakes fives stars for flavor, mouth-feel and craving satisfaction. One star comes off for health impact though. If you decide to give it a try, I would shop around a little. Current 3rd party vendor prices are ludicrous. A much better deal can probably be found at your local grocer.

review/summary: My favorite cereal
review/text: I'm a 20-year-old college student who religiously eats at least 2 bowls of cereal or oatmeal every morning. Prior to my finding this cereal about 6 months ago, I was on a standard rotation of Life, Frosted Mini Wheats, Raisin Bran Crunch, and Corn Flakes among others. I liked each one for different reasons, but it wasn't until I ate Crunchy Nut that I truly fell in love with a cereal.<br /><br />Normally, cereals are simply some combination of sweet, starchy, crunchy, and chewy. With Crunchy Nut, a new dimension is added: hearty. The peanut coating adds a definite protein taste to the cereal, much more so than Honey Nut Cheerios (another cereal I enjoy). For me, it's a great way to wake up, but I also use it as a late-night snack (with crumbs falling into my keyboard as I type this).<br /><br />The cereal is pretty sweet; I'd place it somewhere between Honey Nut Cheerios and Frosted Mini Wheats. There isn't much positive about the nutrition facts, but not much negative either.<br /><br />Overall, this is my favorite cereal, and that's saying something for a 7-year runner dependent upon carbs. I hope that Amazon can begin sending it as part of their Subscribe and Save program. I would be in cereal heaven...

review/summary: Better than Mrs. Mays...
review/text: I used to buy Mrs. May's nut crunches for my family....until I discovered they were made of Chinese grown ingredients.  They used to also put their products together in China, which I see they've changed.  But that aside, they are still sourcing their ingredients from a country that sees nothing wrong with putting melamine in milk and dog food and uses lead based paints on childrens' toys.  I tried Mareblu's Cashew Crunch a few months ago because their products are made in the U.S. of ingredients sourced in the U.S.  They're wonderful!  They are as good or better than Mrs. May's and the carbon footprint used to create these products has to be half.

review/summary: Great dark roast for the Bunn My Cafe
review/text: I got a Bunn My Cafe pod coffee maker for my birthday, and this was one of the coffee pod products I tried. This is an excellent dark roast coffee, and as I live in the rainy Pacific NW, good strong coffee is one of the basic necessities of life here. What I particularly liked about this brand, being a newbie, was that they mark the bottom of the pod so you know which side is up, so to speak. Fits perfectly in the Bunn My Cafe, and for my own personal taste, I highly recommend that you brew this using "Tea" button for a stronger cup. I also found that the coffee seems to be stronger if you moisten the bag and/or the pod holder before you pop it in the Bunn My Cafe. I have 20-oz latte cups, and I fill it using two pods/two cycles with 8 oz water on the "Tea" setting each cycle and it's a perfect, FAST cup of coffee. That leaves 4 oz of space for milk, sweetener and stirring.

review/summary: Perfectly Yummy
review/text: I have been struggling to find a decent cup of coffee for my Keurig brewer.  The K-cups just don't have a full bodied flavor and I grow really sick and tired of them quite easily.  A few months ago, I found some of the Vienna Reserve in a discount store and decided to try it in my regular brewer.  It was truly the most fabulous coffee I've ever had in my life ( and I am a very finicky coffee connoisseur).  I searched on Amazon.com for the coffee but only found the Vienna pods.  Lucky for me, I already had the pod adapter for my Keurig brewer and so I purchased several boxes and am more than pleased with this coffee even though it's not the Reserve.  To compare the two, the Reserve was a bit smoother than this Vienna and it had a very ' buttery-nut taste with absolutely NO bitterness which was truly amazing.  This Vienna is just as tasty but not as smooth as the other.  However, it's still a great cup of coffee.  I highly recommend this coffee for anyone who cherishes a great cup of coffee.  If you have a Keurig brewer, it's worth purchasing the pod adapter for this coffee alone!  The pods do fit this adapter very nicely.  If you are not familiar with how to insert the pod into the adapter-  well, it's quite simple:  Just pinch the top side of the pod with one hand and then shape the pod into a ' ball' and place into the adapter with the bottom ( which is labeled) down and begin brewing.  Voila!  A fast, fresh and easy cup of sophisticated quality.  An added plus to using pods instead of Kcups is that the pods biodegrade and you can add them to your compost pile if you choose.  K-cups fill up the landfills.

review/summary: Careful to use it in Senseo!
review/text: The Wolfgang Puck pads seemed tighter than other pods and smells good, so I thought it would be great. However, it turned out to be wrong and the pods made a huge mess. Because they are too thick to be fit into Senseo system, you have to force it to close. The worse thing is that the cap of Senseo pops up and steam and coffee (from torn pod)came out, due to the build up of steam pressure by thick coffee pads.<br />I end up to open all the pods to make coffee in a regular dripping machine. Taste is good though.

review/summary: Very Authentic
review/text: It is just like the jerk you get in a restaurant n Jamaica.<br />Very flavorful and spicey, great on chicken, pork and<br />seafood. I would recommend this product if you like to grill. It is also available in a smaller size.

review/text: All of the kids liked the peanut bamba, regular flavor, better. I like this kind, but it is a dessert and fattening...we still have a bunch left although we've gone through our regular bamba already.

review/summary: * Smooth & Delicious! *
review/text: I picked this tea up just out of curiosity at my local supermarket in the international foods section.  Wow!  I'm not a major tea afficianado or anything but this tea is superb.  I have never tasted an "over the counter" supermarket tea like this before.  Celestial Seasonings, Twinnings, Nestea ... all crap compared to this!  Nice smooth, mellow yet bold taste.  A nice deep golden color.  I drink mine straight, but with milk its good too.<br /><br />I had my mother try some and she laughed at my astonishment about how good this tea is.  She said, "well you know how the British are about their tea, don't you?"  I guess I didn't know -- I sure know now!!<br /><br />Great great tea!  Superb, really.

review/summary: A fine and sturdy everyday tea
review/text: This is a very drinkable blend of Assam, Ceylon, and Kenyan black teas from PG Tips, one of the UK's most popular brands. Although some California grocery stores (and Cost Plus World Market) stock this tea, I had not tried it until reading helpful reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />Each PG Tips bag weighs 38 percent more than the Lipton bag (that is available in the USA). As expected, PG Tips makes a stronger brew. Each PG Tips bag has so much tea that I can easily make a 12 ounce mug with a single bag. I drink my tea black, but PG Tips is clearly robust enough to maintain character with milk or sweetener.<br /><br />PG Tips is a sturdy, straight-ahead blend with more strength than Lipton's. It is a caffeine-rich tea - in part because each bag has more tea than other brands.<br /><br />PG Tips uses a pyramid shaped bag that allows more room for tea leaves to expand while steeping. Does it make better tea? I don't know, but it is a point of differentiation.<br /><br />HINT: PG Tips also makes a Special Blend black tea that is only slightly more expensive in stores. I much prefer the Special Blend to their regular black tea. The PG Tips Special Blend is a very hardy and rich breakfast tea. The Special Blend is more sensitive to longer steeping times (I usually steep mine less than 3 minutes), but I find the taste more complex and satisfying.<br /><br />Cognoscenti typically prefer loose tea. Tea bags contain the less expensive "fannings" or "dust," remains from processing loose leaf tea. And with some others brands of tea (not PG Tips), many people can taste the paper used in the bag.<br /><br />However, if you like I sometimes appreciate the convenience of bags, I recommend trying PG Tips as a sturdy everyday tea. And, I more strongly recommend their Special Blend as a hardy and rich breakfast tea.

review/summary: Not My Cup of Tea - And Pass the Rolaids, Please...
review/text: My friend swears by this tea.  Other reviewers sing its praises.  I don't get it.  I find it to be a coarse, heavy, undrinkable tea.  The taste is reminiscent of tobacco.  One reviewer called it "sturdy."  That it is-- kind of the tea equivalent to the worst diner coffee you've ever had. I can't imagine serving this at a high tea.  I am a fan of Tazo's Darjeeling tea, which may explain my reaction to PG Tips.  There is nothing refined or nuanced in this cup.

review/summary: Really Terrific!
review/text: After fooling around years ago with several different teas, my wife settled on this one. I have no memory of what I was drinking before PG Tips, but that must mean that it was forgettable. PG Tips is not. The English seem to know what they're doing in this department. No surprise there. To me it has precisely the right flavor, full and rich. If I get up in the middle of the night, for whatever reason that happens, PG Tips is there to quiet me down and put me back to sleep. (Won't work for those sensitive to caffine, I'm afraid, but I am not.) Now, after a long absence, I've returned to drinking it in the morning in place of coffee. My wife still thinks of it as something to have in the afternoon.  Just the best at any time. Try PG Tips!
