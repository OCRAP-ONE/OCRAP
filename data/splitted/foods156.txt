review/summary: Boldo is the natural way to treat fat-liver
review/text: I found that best way to brew this is to use the drip-style coffee maker. 1 tea bag for 12 cups of coffee. I tried in a pot of hot water but coffee maker extracts the most tea out. It tasted funny at first but it's not unbearable. It's much easier to drink while it's hot or warm. At first, I couldn't drink it cold because of its strong flavor. I also found that this helps with digestion too. After a big holiday meal, I drink this and I never get indigestion.

review/text: This is a very good tea--it tastes somewhat like an infusion of green tea with a peppermint leaves. It comes from Chile and it reminds me of Yerba Mate. It is natural and has many health benefits--mostly detoxifying the system. All the women in my family drink it and they swear it keeps their system in tip top shape and bc of that, their skin is supple and beautiful. Some of them are between 55-72 and their complexions are flawless. I developed some age spots on my face and have started drinking it on a daily basis.<br />The package contains 12 boxes. It was wrapped well and it arrived on time. The price is extremely reasonable for this product. Thanks!

review/summary: Claey's Root Beer Drops
review/text: Yes, I did purchase 12 6-Ounce packets of Claey's Root Beer Drops. The reasons I think they are just okay are my own.  Late night computer shopping sometimes makes me order haphazardly.  I like the candies fine.  They have an intense anise flavor, which borders on strong licorice.  They are not individually wrapped, which is stated right on the order page, but I overlooked.  They are coated with dried sugars, much like a lemon drop.  The candies get softer as you consume them, which plays hard-ball with my dental work.  They taste delicious, but I find them harder to carry around with me everywhere I go.

review/summary: Very artificial tasting
review/text: I agree with the other reviewer about these tasting nothing like a real latte. The Maxwell House ones are much much better. The problem is that the vanilla flavor that they used to flavor the espresso is extremely strong and powerful but it has such an artificial taste to it. Brewing it did give my house a wonderful vanilla fragrance and it didn't taste completely horrible which is why I am giving it some stars...I will drink the rest of the package however...I would never buy this again. The plain lattes with a little bit of vanilla syrup are exponentially better. I do have to say that the creamer that comes with this though is the best creamer I have had from the tassimo line. That said...I won't pay this price just for a slightly sweeter creamer disc.

review/summary: Five stars Plus for product quality and GREAT SERVICE!
review/text: When I ordered a bouquet of pink roses to be delivered for my mother's birthday, I placed the order much later than I should have and I included in the order a special request to Spring in the Air to expedite delivery in a tight, actually unfair, time frame. I received a personal response from the company that they would make a particular effort to ship the roses in time -- from Columbia, South America to Ohio, USA! They also contacted my mother to expect the package. They kept me notified by email of the progress of the shipment. Unfortunately, due to a FedEx delay, the roses were delivered the morning after the requested delivery date. That was not the fault of Spring in the Air, who updated me several times with the delivery information. I still would consider it a lightning speed delivery.<br /><br />  When the roses arrived, my mother was ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED! She told me there were enough roses for her to make two beautiful bouquets, and each rose was in the perfect stage of bloom and without any blemishes due to the EXQUISITE CARE the company took in packaging the flowers. She was amazed the stems on the roses were so long! They were absolutely PERFECT and FRESH cut flowers! She was so happy with them! Because they barely missed the requested delivery date, though through no fault of theirs, Spring in the Air credited the purchase price. I will certainly use this company again. I can't write a review glowing enough to express my satisfaction with my order and my pleasure in dealing with a seller that gives such terrific customer service!

I've never had a male that will eat a pate, no matter what the variety and this one is no exception.  The female, she just lOVES this stuff.  I mix it with a bit of water and microwave it for about 8 seconds since it's pretty thick in the can. The quality is quite good on this stuff too - almost like Fancy Feast.  It's a bit rich and will fill you cat up quite nicely too.  Great stuff, loved sincerely in this house, highly recommend!

review/summary: Good for constipated kitties
review/text: One of my cats has had a chronic constipation problem most of her life.  The Friskies Indoor Selects Classic Chicken Entree is her favorite flavor of all.  Since this has brown rice and spinach as some of the ingredients it has helped keep Stinky a little more "regular".  My vet believes all cats should get *some* wet food per day - he gave his approval on this brand over some of the others, even though it's a grocery store brand.  Occasionally I still have to help her along with an 1/8 tsp. of Miralax mixed into this, but she doesn't even notice the Miralax, she still laps this up and begs for more.

review/summary: MISLEADING LABEL
review/text: BEWARE! This is not the "flavor" displayed on the label of the pictured can of cat food in the photo.  This is a photo of the original formula's label.  I ordered 5 cases because the label indeed showed a photo of the label on the "Classic Chicken ENTREE with Brown Rice"..this was the ORIGINAL formula.  Friskies phased out the original formula and REPLACED it with "Classic Chicken PATE with Brown Rice" (PATE IS ON THE LABEL OF THE NEW FORMULA).<br />My cat LOVED the ORIGINAL formula.  Friskies "replacement" formula is different (texture is nearly the same, so it has to be in the ingredients) MY CAT DOES NOT LIKE THE NEW FORMULA.  I believe this is an outrage.  Displaying one picture and then sending an entirely different labeled can?  I am disappointed in Amazon.  NOW, imagine the shipping expense to return 5 cases of canned cat food???? I had to separate the cases from the huge box in order to even lift them into the house!......$73+ down the drain.  To add insult to injury...I can get this replacement "PATE formula" at my local Petco store (on sale) for the SAME PRICE per case.  So much for trusting the photos of products displayed for sale on Amazon.

I give her a third of a can every morning and it keeps her happy all day (she eats dry food, too).  The Amazon price is a little more than I would pay at the grocery store, but my grocery store doesn't regularly stock it, so it's convenient to order it here and also not have to lug it home and pay for sales tax.

I know different cats prefer different food- for example, if I give my cats food that is not the pate kind they won't touch it- so it may not work for all cats but it was great for mine.

review/text: My 2nd adventure for health into ingesting Aloe.  My first taste had me realizing this was way too sweet to be a health drink.  Upon examination the very small font list of ingredients, I found; 1st Aloe Gel, 2nd Honey(surprising), 3rd High Fructose Corn Syrup... yep... 15 grams of sugars per cup 160ml the bottle that is the size of a small bought water bottle is 500ml... I easily gulped it down before my full study was complete. Down the end of ingredients there is artificial green grape flavor...we all need that...to match the green bottle I guess.<br />  After I mixed it 50/50 with filtered water I was able to actually taste other than sweet and it was not bad with a bit of pulp that I liked as in pulp orange juice.  I added some pure Aloe Juice to get it closer to the health drink I stupidly assumed associated with Aloe... and will make it thru the case I ordered.<br /><br /> I suppose if your looking for a better after school replacement drink than say.. Mt Dew, for one of the many new obese children it may suffice...but keep a tongue depressor handy for surely down the road they will be falling down and shaking at this sugar level as well.

Its just the right amount of sweet and the slightest bit of spice that makes these a fantastic tasting chip.<br /><br />Lets talk about details:<br /><br />Chip thickness (+)<br />These are gourmet chips and the quality is there from the moment you open the bag. Each one is crunchy and not too thick but just enough to let you know you didn't buy a bag of Lays.<br /><br />Grease (+)<br />These are NOT greasy chips. Depending on the flavor they are just mildy seasoned and not coated in a heavy grease or oil.<br /><br />Flavor (+)<br />Each flavor stands completely on its own. You could do a blind taste test of each one of these flavors sold by Deep River and I bet you could tell what it was. None of the flavors are overpowering except maybe the Jalapeno flavor which is honestly too hot and I love hot food.<br /><br />Resale (+)<br />You may not resell these but at the current price and using Prime shipping the cost per bag allows you to make a decent profit.<br /><br />Overall:<br />These are great tasting, unique flavored chips that are hands down better than the ones you can get in bulk at a Sams or BJ's. Do yourself a favor and try a bag or two. I bet you'll love em like we do.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review.

review/text: I like these chips, even though they are a little different than chips I am used to. I love that they are reduced fat, but be warned, they are extremely crunchy. So crunchy that I have to turn the volume up on the TV to hear it when I'm chewing them. The taste is quite good though and I like crunchy salty food. I will probably order them again.

review/text: I took a chance on these and they are awesome.  They are crisp and not at all greasy.  I like the Lay's Kettle Chips, but these are really much better, less greasy, maybe a bit more crisp too.  The rosemary is good - it's not overpowering and it tastes like rosemary.  No MSG.  Hits the salty snack craving just right.  I like the size too - it's enough to satisfy a craving but keeps me from eating a whole big bag.  Which I'd probably do with these, if that's what I had.  I'll definitely order them again.  My husband and 16 year old both really like them too.

review/summary: Keep it simple
review/text: Just to keep it simple...more of a comparison than a total review.  I love jalapeno chips - look mostly for the level of spice, then pepper flavor, good crunch, and not loaded down with salt.<br /><br />With that said, these Deep River Snacks chips (jalapeno flavor) are:<br />1. Better than the Lays Jalapeno.  (Deep RIver have the same spice level, which is lacking.  Neither have a lot of pepper flavor.)<br />2. About the same as the jalapeno chips that the "World Market" branded chips.  (World Market has a little more spice, but also a lot more salt.)<br />3. Not nearly as good as Tim's Cascade Jalapeno chips.  (Tims has more pepper flavor, more spice, a little bit better crunch...but also have MSG.)<br /><br />It's not to say these chips are bad, but just what the 3-stars says "It's OK."  There are better, there are worse...to me, these are right in the middle of the pack.

review/text: Before you turn to other name brands out there, give these a try. Although the Maui Onion can be a bit salty at times, i can still say these are amongst the crunchiest and tastiest chips I have ever had. Now i have tried both the barbeque and Asian style flavor, but still I must say these are the best. If you are looking for something to snack on that tastes good, these are the ones for you. Its better than the pringle's commercial, since these are harder to put down once you start.

review/summary: Pretty good, but prefer other jalapeno chips
review/text: I was expecting some "serious flavor" as it was advertised on the bag.. but compared to other jalapeno chips I've had, it's pretty bland. The ingredients list is short, which is a plus, and it's fairly low in sodium (160mg per 1oz serving) which is probably why I prefer this less, as I like saltier chips. Overall I'd say this is a good choice if you like a healthier version of a jalapeno chip.. but if you like strong flavor like I do, stick with Kettle brand jalapeno chips.

There is the right amount of vinegar, virtually every single chip I have tasted is done just right, no burned chips, and they have an excellent thickness to impart just the correct amount of potato taste.<br /><br />They go great with lunches or as a snack. They are very economical. Beats the heck in terms of quality, taste, and price to buying these at work or out and about (I bought the 2 ounce bags).

review/text: These chips are very spicy to say the least, my tongue burned too much to finish the small individual serving bag. They have an overpowering amount of some Asian spice, perhaps ginger, but it is way too strong and you are left with a very unpleasant taste. I bought 24 of the small size bags but could not bring myself to like the flavor, it all ended up in the trash.  This is definitely a chip that will appeal to only certain palates. I do like the sweet onion flavor of this brand but this Asian flavor was too much of a good thing!

review/text: I loved kettle chips from the moment I tried them but I felt absolutely disgusting every time I had the Kettle Brand. Though very tasty and crunchy, they were also very oily. With Deep River Snacks, they've got the crunch and taste without that repulsive burst of oil in your mouth with each crunch that Kettle Brand had. I LOVE the Sweet Onion Maui and Mesquite BBQ. The Jalapeno flavor does spicy justice and the Rosemary & olive Oil is very unique for a chip. I wish they had a sour cream and onion flavor but I love them regardless.

review/text: I did a search on Amazon for Kettle reduced fat chips, hoping to find a good deal on Kettle brand chips.  I stumbled upon these Deep River reduced fat kettle chips, and liked the per bag price (works out to about $1.50 per bag, about half the price of a similarly sized bag of Kettle brand chips at my local grocery store).  I am so glad I ordered these.  I love the taste, and I love the texture, and never would have guessed they were reduced fat.  I particularly like the short list of ingredients: Potatoes, Sunflower or Corn oil, and Salt.  That's it.<br /><br />I do wish Amazon would make it easy to find the nutritional information...so, here are the basics: 12-chip serving (28g) is 120 calories, 6g fat, 1g fiber.<br /><br />I will definitely order these again.

When I received them, I noticed from the very first bag that over half of the chips were inedible due to rotten potatoes! I know how kettle chips should look, and I know what normal marks look like on chips. These were rotten. After waiting over a month for a response from the company, I finally found a phone number and called them, only to be told there was nothing they could do. The sad thing is, the chips that were edible were actually flavorful and tasty. Obviously they just don't care about consistent quality, so stay away from these chips!

review/text: These figs are firm on the outside and somewhat soft on the inside. I can just feel the health radiating through my body *wink* when I eat them. I dipped them in extra dark heart-healthy chocolate, put each one in a mini-heart muffin paper, and gave as valentine gifts instead of the usual boring, bad-for-you chocolates.

review/text: We lived in South Carolina many years ago and enjoyed their pork BBQ.  Being from Texas, it took us some time to try this type of BBQ.  The sause used on these sandwiches was similar to Carolina Gold, or possibly the same.  We loved it.  A friend brought me back a bottle and we went ape over it. I tried the internet and there it was.  We are enjoying this tangy and different BBQ sauce with pork and chicken.  We find it of high quality and a wondeful reminder of our days in South Carolina.  Since it is not sold here, I am sure I will be a returning customer.  I highly recommend anyone try this product.

review/summary: Not the real one again :-(
review/text: Of course, the problem that we have, my wife and I, is the fact that we are Belgians and lived the first 25 years of our lifes in Liege (born and raised). So when I get pearl sugar online for our Liege waffles, like this one, pretending to be "belgian pearl sugar" (it's written on the box!), we can only be disappointed. I guess it's good enough for those who never been in Belgium or those who just passed by there...Those swedish made pearl sugar - at least they are not the rocky sugar - are too big, melt during cooking, give a taste of caramel instead, making the waffle chewy. Oh well...I'm sure one day we'll find the real belgian pearl sugar somewhere online...

OK for decoration, they will not work for baking.  If you do a lot of baking, the 4 pack is a better buy because of the shipping cost.

review/text: So I haven't used this to make a Liege style belgian waffle yet, although I'm sure its the key ingredient I've been missing, but the pearl sugar came fast and as advertised and came with a small pack of Penguin Peppermint Gum for some reason.<br /><br />I also wanted to leave the recipe that's on the box here for those that want to try out their recipe which I've heard (but haven't verified) is awesome for Liege belgian waffles:<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />3 1/2 Cups Bread Flour<br />1 Packet Dry Yeast<br />3/4 Cup Lukewarm Milk (~105 F)<br />8 oz softened butter (2 sticks)<br />2 eggs<br />1/2 Teaspoon Salt<br />1 Teaspoon Vanilla<br />Cinnamon (optional)<br />1 Bag Lars' Own Belgian Pearl Sugar<br /><br />Directions:<br />Dissolve yeast in lukewarm milk. Gradually add all ingredients and the flour into the yeast/milk mix except for the pearl sugar. Let dough rise until it doubles in size (approx 30 minutes). Add pearl sugar and fold in. Divide dough into small patties about 3 to 4 ounces each (roughly an ice cream scoop). Bake in a heated and greased waffle iron.<br /><br />Serve drizzled with chocolate, fruit, whipped cream.

review/summary: NOT for making ordinary Belgian Waffles!
review/text: These sugar pearls are used for makign Belgian "steet waffles" common in the 18th century, (and now resurrected by foodies).  The waffles are properly called "Gaufre Liege" and are made using this type of beet-based sugar pearls which melt and carmelize using a dough recipe.<br /><br />The more common gooey batter Belgian Waffle recipe is called the "Bruxelles" type, and it would be very odd to use these sugar pearls when preparing them.  Ordinary Belgian "Bruxelles" waffle batter can be made perfectly using common cane sugar.

review/text: If you (like me) have been looking for the South Beach Living, Protein Fit, Cinnamon Raisin Cereal Bars then this product is what you want. According to the South Beach Living website all of their foods are being "reimagined". I'm not sure what that means but ultimately it means that the Protein Cereal Bars have been unavailable at my local grocery stores for some time.<br /><br />I saw these at my local store and decided to give them a try. It turns out that they are identical in size, taste, and nutritional content. After looking at the packaging I can see that they are actually both owned by Kraft Foods and this SnackWell's product is just a rebranding of the exact Protein bars I wanted.<br /><br />The price as of this posting is pretty high here through this Amazon reseller so I recommend asking your local grocer to carry them if they don't already. I know I was glad to find them!<br /><br />Bottom line is, if you're looking for these:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K7382A">South Beach Diet High Protein Cereal Bars, Cinnamon Raisin 5 ea</a><br /><br />Buy these instead:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U49R2Y">Snackwell's Cinnamon Raisin Bars, 6.15-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>

I found these here and bought them thinking they looked in the picture like the South Beach bars and was very happy when I received them and they were the same bars as far as I could tell.  These are sweet and a little crunchy but not too crunchy and not near as crunchy as granola bars.  They keep me from getting hungry when I cannot eat a full meal.  They do not have that gritty taste that some protein bars have.  I find that the flavor is like a cross between a cinnamon bun and a pecan roll.  Very good and glad to have found them here!

When Kraft Foods reinvented and reintroduced them as SnackWell cereal bars I was thrilled.  Nothing starts off my healthy, smart eating better than something that reminds me I don't need to be deprived to lose weight. Try them heated briefly in the microwave and indulge! ****July 2012**** I found new South Beach Bars in the cereal aisle and thought they would be just like these and the old South Beach ones but cheaper - NOT! They are hard as a rock, smaller and taste different.  I may pay a little more per box (I use Subscribe & Save) but they are worth it!  Don't be fooled.

Snackwells really missed the mark by discontinuing the Cranberry Almond and Maplenut! They were my favorite!  Having only Cinnamon Raisin, Chocolate, and Peanut Butter makes Snackwells just like everyone else.  Boo!!<br /><br />As for Amazon.com, whom I also love, but not in this case; WHY?  Well, most grocery stores sell them for under $3 so why would anyone by four boxes at $13.54 plus S&H and then have to wait for them to come when you can go down the street to the nearest store and pay $12??

review/text: The first thing you notice about the New Guinea bean is the size. These are large, heavy beans and I had to turn the air to full on my roaster to get the beans to circulate. Not a problem as long as your roaster can handle it. I didn't experience any burned beans.<br /><br />I gave it a full roast and the results were quite good: full-bodied, well-balanced complex flavors. The taste is similar to the Sumatra beans (one of my favorites) so if you like Asian beans in general you won't be disappointed, especially at the price. I'll be buying this one again after I exhaust this bag.

review/text: These are very versatile green beans that I would not normally roast and drink on their own, but rather blended to make a truly robust brew. These beans definitely like a full city roast (although they stand up nicely to a french roast) to bring out the caramel/chocolatey notes that can take a more delicate bean to new heights. The beans are a bit larger than some of the other green bean products offered on Amazon, but roast nicely with my equipment.

review/summary: The bars are fine.  This deal is not.
review/text: I have severe diet restrictions.  All you who would like to be thin, I can recommend the IBS diet--as little fat as possible (I find I can take no more than 5 grams of fat in a meal), no dairy, no nuts, no chocolate, no caffeine, no decaf, limit wheat flour, no red meat, no heavy meals, no empty stomach, and on and on.  Deviate from the diet restrictions and you will lose weight. Eat carefully and you still lose weight.<br /><br />This allows very few options when you eat out or you're on the road.  Since I work a job which requires a fair amount of travel in a large rural area, finding a 'nutrition bar' or snack food I can eat was a challenge.<br /><br />Cliff bars are easy to find in most Walmarts, and cost just under a dollar each.  They're a little cheaper in case lots -- $5 for a box of 6.  I can only eat 2 kinds, and of course they're popular, so I seldom find them in boxes.  I searched online and was surprised to see Walmart.com offers an assortment of 3 boxes (18 bars) for $15.  They add $1.47 for shipping, but even so, that's a much better price than Amazon's offering here. If you like these, or have a lot of kids and family who do, you may want to check out that source.
