review/summary: Not Exactly Stupendous
review/text: For me, this is nothing more than weak hot chocolate that tastes as if a cinnamon hot drop hard candy was ground up and dropped into it. I had really been looking for ward to this, but to my palette generic store brand cocoa is more appealing. No matter how hard I tried, I could not get it to adequately mix with milk. Always a grainy, chunky bottom layer persisted towards the last ounce and it surely did not enhance the flavor.<br /><br />Sorry Nestle, but this product is definitely not for me.

review/summary: It WAS our favorite....
review/text: After living in the Southwest for many years, I developed a fondness for the cinnamon-chocolate flavor combination.  I used to always buy the tablet of chocolate and added it to hot milk, stirred and stirred...and had a fantastic cup of cocoa.  Wonderful, but not real convenient.  This product makes my favorite cup of cocoa instantly, no heating of milk and stirring to dissolve the tablet routine, and I can take our favorite hot cocoa flavor with us on camping trips.  Its not quite as creamy as the version made the old fashioned way, but a dab of cream added to the mixed cocoa takes care of  that.  Unfortunately, the powdered mix includes artificial sweeteners, which we are not thrilled with.<br /><br />If you don't mind the artificial factor, this is great.  If you do mind...stick with the tablet version!

review/summary: Finally Found It
review/text: I have been trying to find someplace in the Northeast selling the Abuelita single packets.  I even tried to order directly from Nestle.  Seems it is only sold in the Southeast (I originally tasted it in Florida) and Southcentral (found it again in New Mexico).<br /><br />Love this product.  The hint of cinnamon in the chocolate gives it a bit of a different taste.  And it's not too sweet.

review/summary: Not what I was expecting, but still pretty good with adjustment
review/text: I grew up munching on Abuelita chocolate and was excited to see a hot chocolate mix in the grocery store. However, one packet was fairly watered down in taste compared to the tablets.<br /><br />But I figured out that using about one and a half packets fixes the taste, and makes a very delicious drink. It gets thicker and starts to remind me of this: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H13626">Maizena Chocolate Drink Mix, 1.5-Ounce Packets (Pack of 48)</a>, which is excellent.

review/summary: Jolly Rancher Apple Candy - 160 Count Box
review/text: ASIN B000NME05Q - My JR Watermelon review can be partly recycled here, since certain things apply to both flavors! AND I'm copying this from my review of another listing for the exact same item because they're EXACTLY THE SAME!<br /><br />One of the original Jolly Rancher flavors, and a lifelong favorite around here, the 160 piece box is something I generally pick up locally to avoid the shipping charges that come with ordering online. To make sure you get the best price on Amazon, take the time to do a search because there are several listings and the prices vary.<br /><br />From the crinkle of the plastic wrapper as you open it to the last tiny sliver of mouth-watering flavor, everything about these candies is a flawless-summer-day-in-childhood memory for me. While Watermelon is sweet-sweet, Apple is sweet-tart and will literally make your mouth water. As with all JR candies, you can smell them before you open them and the scent is a huge temptation. There's about 24 calories in a candy and, because they're yummy, I use them rather than cough drops for fighting off that dry mouth, throat-tickling cough. Any excuse!<br /><br />Also see: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014C5OB8">Jolly Rancher Twist Apple 160 Piece Box</a>.

review/summary: The best Italian peppers you can get this side of Calabria
review/text: These are the real deal. Italian hot chili peppers marinated in olive oil. They are salty, delicious heat. I like slapping them on slices of fresh bred or crackers and stuffing myself. They make a great antipasti addition or pizza topping. I probably woudn't include them in pasta sauce or with pasta because they are pretty salty, and there are better options for that (Like Delallo's imported pepper and garlic pasta sauce, which is similar but with garlic and not very salty). If you  are a hot pepper aficionado you will love these, not becaues they are burning hot (they aren't) but because they have enough heat to be respectable, but also flavor that you can't find among typical hot peppers.

review/summary: Add some heat with not so much effect on the flavor
review/text: I discovered these in a restaurant, or actually several restaurants in the same area, although none would say where they got the chilis.  One finally brought the jar out.  They are pretty hot and great in soups and pasta.  They don't change the flavor as much as the vinegar based sauces which is the best feature.  There are times when the vinegar taste is ok, but times when it doesn't work, so these fit right in.  You do have to tear them apart to disperse through the dish, but they're pretty soft.  I guess they could be added while cooking, but I've never tried them that way.

review/text: These are large cans of beans, not dry beans like I thought.  I would have kept them because Eden Foods is one of the few producers of canned goods that do not include BPA in their linings (I'm a big fan of Eden).  Some of the cans, however, arrived damaged at the seams which can let in air and cause bacterial growth.  They were packaged poorly, having put the cans with several books making the somewhat small box weigh 30 lbs and destined to be damaged.<br /><br />Update:  I wrote "canned, not dry" because originally there was not a photo.

review/summary: Loaded with Sugar -- Unacceptable!
review/text: After buying 12 boxes of this to save money over the Annie's Organic M&C we usually purchase, I have learned the hard way WHY this is sold under private label by Annie's and WHY it is cheaper.  These questions are raised on this site by other reviewers, and I certainly do wish someone had previously addressed the matter herewith so I could have saved myself the purchase cost of this x12.<br /><br />This Simply Organic M&C contains a lesser-grade pasta and less actual cheese than Annie's.  As a result, to achieve palatable texture and flavor by mainstream standards, Simply Organic adds starch and whey, not to mention SUGAR!  Yes that's right, I said SUGAR!  I cannot believe any responsible organic manufacturer would put sugar in macaroni and cheese.  Nor can I believe that any responsible parent would wittingly or willingly feed sugar to their children via yet another unnecessary source.  Nevertheless, sugar is the second ingredient, and I would guess [hope] that most buyers are merely unsuspecting and unaware.<br /><br />As a holistic mother whose one compromise in our completely organic lifestyle is occasional macaroni and cheese from a box (because we home school our children and manage a large property including five kinds of fruits plus a variety of vegetables and animals, and there are hectic days when dinner simply gets "pushed to the back burner" - pun intended!), I would not dream of feeding this to my children.  If you have strong convictions about what the growing bodies and brains in your family ingest, then you will want to steer clear of this.<br /><br />If this is not enough to convince you, then allow me to cite a real life experiment.  My husband is an engineer who dabbles in new product development and cannot let anything go untested; as such, we made one box to sample.  Since he is an ardent cheese lover, I fully expected him to recoil from the sickengly sweet taste, which he did.  However, I am notorious among my family and friends for having a mad sweet tooth (e.g., I eat icing and leave the cake behind).  Yet despite my love of all things sugary, this was a complete turn off for me.  When I want sugar, I want sugar.  And when I want cheddar, I want cheddar.  In my humble opinion, in this case more than ever, it should be as the old saying states: "never the twain shall meet."<br /><br />Sugary sweet cheddar?  It's just not right.<br /><br />Feeding sugar to children hidden in macaroni and cheese?  It's just plain wrong.<br /><br />Simply put: Simply Organic is not worthy of our patronage.<br /><br />Eat healthy and be well in your journey.... ;)

review/summary: tastes much better than Kraft
review/text: I have been trying to steer my family to the organic side of the food chain.  They have been resisting.  They complain more often than not and I give in more often than I should. So it has been with Mac N Cheese.  Annie's sat on the shelf ignored until I donated them.  So had a number of other versions.  I took a chance on these and ordered a case when the price was good on Amazon.  The case of 12 got eaten in a month (it is the fall back dinner that my hubby makes for the kids if I am not around).  Then, yesterday, my husband pulled out the left over Kraft box, made it and regretfully told me that it doesn't hold a candle to this stuff.  Go figure.  I think I was speechless for a minute there as Kraft has been the torch that nothing else compared to in flavor.  Came back on here to buy more and it's sold out.

review/text: This is my first cake that I have made gluten free, I tried the brownie mix by Betty Crocker and that is to die for.<br />This is a very nice, moist not too sweet chocolate cake it gives a nice little crispy edge which I love.  The only issue is that they say decadent, I do not agree with that, the chocolate is a bit light, it could use a stronger chocolate flavor. It is just a plain, albeit very good, chocolate cake. With that said I would definitely buy this again, it hits the spot on most levels.

review/summary: Wonderful taste and will protect your teeth
review/text: I love licorice, and just the smell of these licorice mints when I opened the box from Amazon was heavenly... So was the taste! They didn't melt instantly in my mouth as another poster said, although they're small and won't last for long (mainly because other common ingredients to slow down disintegration are thankfully missing, so it's just xylitol and natural flavors). But the licorice flavor lingers for quite a while. Gosh, I can just sniff the container periodically for a quick fix.... :) You just can't go wrong with something that is just xylitol plus natural licorice extract, natural anise, and natural fennel oil - all my favorites!<br /><br />I didn't buy them as candy (although I can see they will be quite suitable as a licorice fix when the craving hits) or as a "breath mint" but rather to use for preventive dental care, to help preserve and repair my teeth. The recommendation (see the zellies site with the link down at the bottom of the home page to the Ask Dr. Ellie blog for more information) is 3 to 6 grams of xylitol per day, preferably in small amounts after each meal, snack, or non-water beverage. These will do just fine for reaching my goal of 6 grams xylitol per day, since they have 0.4 grams (400 milligrams) of xylitol in each tiny tablet. One or two of them per dose will work well.<br /><br />They also do not have any sorbitol in them (a common ingredient in many products marketed as containing xylitol), which is a big asset because sorbitol can cause digestive problems and also can promote growth of the mouth bacteria (they can easily metabolize it) we're trying to reduce with xylitol (which can be eaten in much larger amounts with no problem by humans but the bacteria don't seem to be able to manage it). Xylitol also helps alkalinize your saliva after acidic foods or drinks, a good thing because that helps remineralize your teeth.<br /><br />The Amazon price is good, also, especially with Subscribe&Save.

review/text: I first tried these Ricochet Mints at work. The person in the cubicle next to me suggested I try them and I'm really glad I did. That fact that these mints are sugar free, have all natural ingredients in them, and that they taste great makes them a joy to eat every time I use them. The flavor is not so strong that you will hate it. In fact, I'm not a big licorice fan in general yet I love these mints. I'd highly recommend them to anyone who wants a decent breath mint.

review/text: Our family enjoyed these. I ran across the site online that now sells them...XYLITOL USA and placed an order of 12 boxes. Same tin pictured. Big BIG mistake. Once received they were broken up, moist and gritty with just a hint of licorice taste. I emailed to ask if they changed the recipe or, I said our order was clearly just bad. Each email I received back was from "office" at "customer care specialist". No names, no numbers to contact. Then I was informed that they stopped making the "Ricochet" brand mints and the ones sold from Amazon were left over yet. Both the statement received and the tins from XYLITOL USA say "Ricochet Licorice Mints" across them. I was informed (from "Office") that "there is not that much of a difference", they "can't do anything about it", they were "sorry" and that I should "try another flavor". I call it "fishy" and "another life lesson learned". BUY THESE FROM AMAZON WHILE YOU CAN!

While this brew hints at toffee flavor, it is significantly weaker than other manufacturer's flavors.<br /><br />LUCKILY.....<br /><br />you can sell, give, or trade your unwanted k-cups at the K-Cup Exchange on Yahoo Groups (Amazon prevents me from listing the site's address here, but you'll find it if you go on Yahoo Groups and search for K-Cup Exchange) This site is a great idea for K-Cup users.

review/summary: So disappointed!
review/text: After reading so many glowing reviews, I was expecting a really special taste experience. It just goes to show how different people's tastes are, b/c I found it to be weak and hardly tasty at all! I brewed it on the "small cup" setting to get the strongest brew (b/c I know Gloria Jean's flavors tend to be on the weaker side) and still found it to be nearly tasteless. It doesn't have a BAD taste, just not enough taste. This is not the coffee for me. I'm just glad I got it in a sample pack and did not get stuck w/2 whole boxes!

review/text: I would honestly just make cup after cup of this stuff, so it would make my apartment smell like heaven.  I didn't purchase mine from Amazon (they were cheaper on other sites), but I thought I'd share-- if you like the smell of butterscotch, or the taste of butter pecan ice cream, just stand around your Keurig and sniff while brewing this flavored coffee gem.  It's terrific.  I like my coffee sweet, so I add caramel syrup (just generic stuff purchased at Target) and a little warm milk to mine.  Faaaaaantastic!

review/summary: Well...
review/text: I'm not entirely sure why I bought these.  I'm more of a medium coffee drinker who takes it black and I've never been a big fan of flavored coffee but I was surfing for K-Cup refills and ran across this with its superior reviews and was sold.<br /><br />It's a pretty typical flavored coffee for me, with a seriously bitter finish.  The big cup setting produces a nearly tea-colored coffee, but the small setting is just about right...I just need to brew two of them.  It smells good though, and doesn't taste terrible, it's just not for me.  Luckily, a shot of Irish cream (some shots stiffer than others) will cure most bad coffee ills, otherwise I wouldn't be able to finish off my now huge supply of this stuff.

review/text: I was so disappointed bc this seems to get great reviews.  It has an extremely weak taste and is bitter.  Also, I find that Gloria Jean's coffees (hazelnut, french vanilla, butter toffee) are weak and taste like you're drinking perfume.  I love a stronger, smoother coffee... this is just not good.

review/summary: Best K-Cup Ever.
review/text: I enjoy trying new K-Cups and finding out which are my favorites and which I'll never try again.  This K-Cup is by far the best I have tried so far.  It smells delicious when it's brewing, and although the actual flavor when you drink it is more mild, it's simply perfect.  It's got notes of caramel, nuts and vanilla, yet is not so overwhelming that you can't drink it as your every day coffee.  It's flavor profile is very similar to Green Mountain Southern Pecan, but I find Gloria Jean's butter toffee to be more rich and flavorful.  If I could only have two K-Cups for all time, I would choose this coffee and Coffee People Donut Shop.<br /><br />Buy this- you'll love it!

It tastes like a heath bar but without the chocolate. Truly delicious!

review/summary: Mediocre, But Good for Variety
review/text: I like this just for the variety.  I have really liked a number of the flavored coffees, but this one is borderline.  It is a little bitter, but I still like to drink it black, but my wife adds a little sugar which we've never done for other kcups so far.  Unlike some other flavors, I don't feel like the flavor is spot on.  There is a butter flavor taste, but seems more like an added flavor and imperfect coffee rather than perfect harmony.  I keep a large selection of flavors, so I still like this enough to have in the rotation for variety.  But one box is enough and I will probably buy it again when I run out, but I'm in no hurry.  I wouldn't give this to guests as their first k-cup experience, but fine for me when I feel like it.<br /><br />So if you're more into flavors and don't care about having to be superb coffee, it is something you can mix into your variety.  I rate it right in the middle, not bad.  But I can see why some might not like it since there are better kcups out there.  I feel like I'm being too harsh since I'll probably have more.  I have just been so thrilled with other kcups that this is quite a contrast with some that seem so perfect.

review/summary: Absolutely my favorite flavor thus far.....
review/text: I am basically new to K-cups and the single maker, but when I got my variety pack, this was the first one I tried.  I didn't care for it all that much at first.  However, it was in the running.  I was a heavy English Toffee cappuccino drinker before a diagnosis of type-2 diabetes in late February, and I sure have missed having it every day (several times a day).  So, I was looking for a replacement.  My daughter ended up buying me a box locally, and I cringed, because I had found another variety of toffee elsewhere, bought it, and thought it was the one.  I liked it so much at first that I bought 2 more boxes (and the title is English Toffee).  However, now I find that it doesn't come close to tasting as good as Gloria Jeans Butter Toffee (too strong and bitter, and the flavor just doesn't compare at all....and I have a lot to muddle through....ugh).  The minute I close the lid with Gloria Jeans, the aroma pours out and makes my heart race.  It's not a strong coffee, so that's perfect for me.  Once I add creamer and sweetener, it's divine.  This flavor/brand is by far my ultimate favorite and the best I've tried out of many thus far.  I'm sipping on a cup now and have only 1 of that flavor left.  I find myself panicking, too.  Time to get a lot more *lol*  I just ordered a box of her Mudslide K-cups to try, so I'm hoping hers are good.  (I tried another brand and didn't like it at all...tasted like coconut when there's no such thing in a mudslide at all *ha ha*)  Anyway, I highly endorse this product a million times :-)
