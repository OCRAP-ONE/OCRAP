review/summary: Even a novice can cook the nicest rice!
review/text: I picked this brand up at a local discount store and what a wonderful product!<br />First it cooks FAST...15 minutes and you're done. I boil mine in a covered pan.<br />Second, the grains don't "explode" like regular rice, it keeps its ricey shape, even when re-heated.<br />Third, the grains don't stick together. (I've always had trouble with the sticking grains syndrome).<br />And of course, there's the flavor.....Ummm!<br />Honestly, if you can't find this locally, buy it here, because it's a bargain at any price!

review/summary: Fragrant and fluffy
review/text: I've always used short-grained glutinous rice in my meals, but I needed something a little lower on the glycemic index. After much research, I discovered Basmati rice rated as low, if not lower, than brown rice (which I cannot stomach). Next came the question of which Basmati brand to purchase from. Since this was for health reasons, it was very important that I find a brand I could trust, and Tilda ranked high on everyone's list due to their reputation and genetic testing of their grains.<br /><br />The rice arrived in a very convenient bag with an easy resealable slide along the top (in the photo where the gold band is). My rice was very fragrant but not as strong as Jasmine rice...a plus in my book. The rice was free of detritus and cooked up nice and fluffy in my Zojirushi rice cooker. The flavor was nice and subtle; a plus when pairing with delicate flavors as you don't want your rice to overpower the other food in terms of aroma, taste, and texture. I definitely plan on purchasing again.

review/summary: Instant Rice
review/text: Updated:  I purchased Tilda Basmati because of the rave reviews, WOW whats not to like about getting an even better basmati flavor?  This bag of basmati rice was packaged well, packed well for shipping, and shipped promptly.  But the rice itself is very disappointing.  It's instant rice, and not very good instant rice at that, with a basmati flavor.  It cooks in ten minutes to a mushy pasty individual grain.<br />  What with having ten pounds of it, I've tried cooking it every way that rice can be cooked, just in case I was preparing it incorrectly. Nope, tastes like someone made rice mush and then extruded it thru small holes and re-dried it. My family and I enjoy whole grain rices that generally take 55 minutes to cook and allow you to have a pleasant flavor and distinct individual grain texture to the mouth. I even tried using it as a filler for meat loaf or meat balls. It decreases the quality of any recipe you use it in.<br />  The only explanation for all these rave reviews that I can see is that they're generated by the company, or that the purchasers have never tasted real rice before.  This stuff is awful.  After a year of holding it in my refrigerator, much to long to get a refund, I've just finished dumping 9 1/2 pounds of it in the trash.

review/summary: Good rice, but...
review/text: Okay, it is a good rice. Tilda Basmati is a completely fantastic rice if separate rice grains are an important thing to you.<br /><br />I should say that I purchased a Zojirushi NS-LAC05 rice cooker. If you want rice to make a difference, buy a really good rice cooker. Rice does not have to be a filler substance.<br /><br />Tilda Basmati Rice has extra-super long grains. The grains are so long that many of them curl after being prepared. This is an absolutely superb rice if a fluffy, separate grain rice is of high priority. There is a place for that and I am quite thankful for my purchase for that category of need. Tilda really is a great, high quality rice for common rice needs.<br /><br />Since I got my Zojirushi rice cooker, well, the cooker really brings out the differences in rice. If you just prepare your rice in a saucepan on the stove, it really doesn't matter all that much to buy an upper level quality rice IMHO. No offense to saucepan/stove-top people. Rice is a good and often necessary food item. Stove-top prep is certainly better than not having it. HOWEVER, my Zojirushi rice cooker has really made rice a whole 'nuther deal.<br /><br />And to my point: Tilda Basmati is a really great rice if you want fluffy rice with separate rice grains. Fluffy rice with separate grains is a totally valid category. In fact, it may be what most people want. I feel that my Tilda Basmati is a very high quality rice. My only disappointment is that it is in that extra long grain category and the fact that it produces very separate rice grains, which could be a very positive aspect to many, if not most. I just happen to like rice that sticks together more.<br /><br />I would buy it again in a heartbeat next time I need long grain rice that has very separate grains. Since I purchased a 10-Pound bag, I may not need to buy more for a while.<br /><br />Very highly recommended if you want fluffy rice with separate grains. Not much good for sushi rice.

review/summary: sugar rush
review/text: My baby is 10 months old. Teeth are coming, fever is present, fussiness is there, what's better than teething biscuits, right? organic, all natural, etc, right? Well, I gave one to her. She was gnawing away happily. Then she took a too big of a bite and a chunk fell down, and I tried it. To my shock I discovered that this biscuit is sweeter than the doughnut you would get at Dunkin, and sweeter than any danish you would have. It is sweeter than animal crackers, and I just had a few myself, as it was late at night, my baby asleep, and I wanted something sweet with my tea - I will NEVER give another one of these to my baby. Complete sugar rush and therefore, I can't imagine it is good for her. If you are a sensible parent and don't feed your child McDonalds - these 'all natural' and 'organic' biscuits are a waste of your money. I can't imagine anything that sweet is good for your baby.

I am weaning off the caffeine, but will soon be on a diet where I can't have any fruit for a while. This is the only down-side to this product - that and it has barley, which is not tolerable by those who are gluten-sensitive. Taste-wise though, I like it! And I really like that you can brew it however you desire, and that it's not just another instant powder.

review/summary: Better Than the Original!
review/text: For years, my favorite cracker has been the Keebler Clubs. One day, I saw the Multi-Grain version, and thought I'd give it a try--especially since I normally enjoy whole grain breads and was trying to lower my cholesterol.<br /><br />I couldn't believe it, but the Multi-Grain version actually tastes BETTER than the original! I've bought several boxes of these crackers, and always make sure some are on hand. I use them with Asian tuna salad (canned tuna with mayo and sesame oil--you can add diced red pepper, too), chesee and Inglehoffer Sweet Honey Mustard, spreads, soups, and so on.<br /><br />Very, very tasty crackers!

I don't know about the nutrition or real grain content, but I just buy them because they are the most delicious cracker I've had, including all the other major brands.<br /><br />I highly recommend trying these. I mostly eat them plain, because aside from laziness and fragility, I just want to taste the cracker and it doesn't need topping.

review/text: This faux Spathyfillum from "Nearly Natural" is beautiful.  Some of the leaves are still a little scrunched from being in the box, but I think they will straighten out as they relax a bit.  The color of the leaves is just right...not cheap looking at all, and the leaves don't have rough stringy edges like some less expensive ones I've had. The plant is just the right size where you need something in a corner or some other spot where you need a little taller plant, but it doesn't overpower the room. The Spathyfillum comes in the pot shown in the photo, but I set it, planter and all, into a large nicer looking ceramic planter, and it's stunning.  It is very realistic, and to me, this is definitely worth what it costs.  I would order again.

I cannot describe the taste but I am assuming its the sunflower oil since all the<br />other ingredients are the same. Sometimes, an organic product will taste different and not in a desirable way.<br /><br />Whatever it is, I like the Nutella much better. I put both spreads on different crepes and when "testing" both, I found the Nutella creamier and richer in chocolate taste. I am certainly disappointed that Nutella tastes better due to the above list but I will try some other spreads, hoping to find an organic hazelnut that satisfies.

review/summary: there ought'ta be a law....
review/text: I tried this on a banana recently and I have to agree with the other five star reviews that there  should be some sort of warning label about how addictive this stuff could be. Nothing like Nutella in flavor *or* texture and that for me is a *good* thing; the best I could do to try to explain the difference would be to compare/contrast - Nutella is to Hershey's what Nocciolata is to Godiva. Not that I have anything against good ol' Hersheys but my palate has grown up a bit over the years and I happen to LOVE the less sweet, more natural taste of this spread.<br /><br />To me, this tastes more like milk chocolate than dark which the description says it is made with; makes sense as it does contain milk too. You definitely taste the fresh toasted hazelnuts as well. The texture is great for dipping that banana in the two tiny teaspoons the label says I can have. Somehow with the perfect balance of chocolate and hazelnut just that little bit does seem to satisfy my cravings though.

I used to get it regularly at a local supermarket, then it disappeared without an explanation or forwarding address.  Last week happened on a few jars at the same supermarket...was told that a jobber had left a box.  So, maybe someday they will just appear again, like magic.  As I paid $2.99 per jar, doubt that I would ever spring for the Amazon price PLUS shipping.  It's truffle-like and only the nutritional label keeps me from having more than a teaspoon [ok, half tablespoon] at a time.

review/summary: Gourmet, use with caution!
review/text: This higher quality "Nutella-like" spread can be dangerous----it's so delicious and yet, so sugary!  I have to be cautious with added sugar (I may have hypoglycemia and Candida), and this spread is loaded with sugar (the nemesis of both health conditions).  I was briefly vegan and still have very vegan-like sentiments for a vegetarian (the less animal product the better), so I wasn't too thrilled with the skim milk powder ingredient, organic though it may be. I haven't tried the Justin's version of Nutella, and my friend who works at a local health food store warned that it was practically tasteless compared to Nocciolata's Organic Hazelnut Spread with Cocoa and Milk.  As a side note, Justin's Maple Almond Butter is delicious and just sweet enough without overdoing it. I may still give the Justin's version of Nutella a try since it has several less grams of sugar per serving and no milk product in it.<br /><br />This product is delicious---yet a little goes a long way, and it is very rich.  I put some of the spread on mixed berries and Granny Smith apples, and that was sumptuous, of course.  Yet I also confess to putting a spoon in the jar when I am nearing the end of the product and just eating it by itself.  When I was little, I used to do the same thing to the Sander's Milk Chocolate Fudge that was supposed to be poured over ice cream---eat it by itself by the spoonful.  Although I don't eat ice cream, this product would be much better than typical hot fudge chocolate sauces on the market.

For me, that's a good thing.<br /><br />It tastes delicious alone, or on toast or fruit.  Putting it on something that is already sweet will give it that "too sweet" taste.<br /><br />However you prefer it, as my grandmother used to say, - Mangiare!<br /><br />(I can't wait to try it with a warm croissant).

review/summary: OVERLY SWEET chocolatey nutella
review/text: I bought mine at Whole Foods and it was a smaller more beautiful packaged glass container than the other nutellas and more expensive but I figure since it came directly from Italy, it would have to be higher in quality, especially being organic.  If you like OVERLY sweet chocolate paste, then it's for you.  Based on the amazon ad, it's supposed to be used for desserts.  I instead wanted to use it as they do in Europe on bread or waffles or butter wafer cookies.  But, I found myself having to grab a gallon of water after every taste.  I would prefer it to have less sugar like Justin's "nutella" <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JG5TVS">Justin's Nut Butter Natural Chocolate Hazelnut Blend, 16 Ounce plastic jars (Pack of 3)</a>

review/summary: Not a Nutella-killer
review/text: I love hazelnuts and hazelnut spreads, or so I thought. But it seems that the competition is still far behind Nutella in getting the right taste. The reason I bought this product is that American Nutellas have trans fats, which I obviously wanted to avoid, and the Nutellas sold on Amazon are not European ones or at least not German versions. But this hazelnut spread is just too sweet for my liking. It wasn't bad for a small change, but I will never buy any product other than Nutella, especially for this price.

review/summary: Product is Awesome / Amazon's handling of it not so!!!
review/text: Why would someone decides to package glass jars of $11 a piece in the box in which they ship books(you know those flat "boxes" that have just a flap for a top and the bottom). Box showed up with  "Received Unsealed" stamped all over it. Two jars leaked out, one because metal cap got dented other because seal got broken and cap unscrewed.<br />It is so sad that even though shipping and handling charges double the price of an item it still arrives damaged when fulfilled by Amazon.<br />Just a note:This product is great which makes me even more furious that I have to send it back. We love Nutella as well but unless they switch from using palm oil I won't be feeding it to my toddlers. After it turned into thick paste in my 3 years old stomach which made him throw up all over himself in the car I'm very careful with products that contain palm oil.

review/text: We were introduced to Siciliani olive oil by Chef Bettancourt at his excellent restaurant, "62 on Wharf" in Salem, Ma. It is the best I've had in over 40 years of dining, but difficult to find in local stores (thus we are delighted to order from Amazon). Believe me, you will never regret buying this product! Dip your bread into a little bowl of Siciliani, and WOW!, what a taste.

review/text: I'm sorry but in contrast to the other rave reviews for this product, I did not like it at all!  I purchased several e.v. olive oils and this one was most disliked by both my husband and myself.  We tasted it alone and with some fresh bread for dipping and we each experienced a funny feeling inside our mouths and a dry scratchiness to our throats that made us cough.  This has no place in my kitchen.  Sorry Siciliani :)

review/summary: My cats are now conspiring to buy stock in Halo
review/text: Or so I assume, based on their wild reaction every time I open the food cupboard.  Even as I type this, one of my cats is battling my keyboard for control of my hands so he can push me into the kitchen and make me serve him food.  Or use my computer to check out stocks; I'm not sure.<br /><br />After switching to a grain-free diet of my own, I decided to do the same for my cats.  One, the little girl, is a hearty 11 lbs with plenty of belly swag that sways when she runs :3  Cute as it is, I imagine the extra weight can't be great for her long-term health.  Following a bit of research on the subject, and after considering taking up hunting and training them to be in my party, I ended up on Amazon looking for grain-free foods.  Much to my delight, I found a brand that wasn't exorbitantly more expensive as compared to the other food (Organix) that I had been buying previously, so I gave it a shot.<br /><br />Enter Halo's Ground Whitefish flavor, harbinger of end sleeps.<br /><br />The kitty alarm sounds at 6 AM sharp.  If I don't have a food dish in my hands by 6:05, several paws of needle claws remind me of my human duty to their cat majesty--you know, in that "I'm-kneading-you-into-bloody-dough-because-I-love-you" way, all purrs.  Food, once released to the hungry pit of tails and nudging faces, is devoured in a matter of minutes.  Cries of "MOAAAR!" carry on throughout the day, noses turned up to the (almost) grain-free dry food I leave out for them.  If I could afford it, I'd feed them six cans a day and train them to be ninjas.  Whatever Halo's doing, they're doing it right.<br /><br />TL;DR: Success.  Would buy again.  Cats are likely plotting to invest in Halo to secure discounts on fishy goodness.

review/summary: Halo Grain Free Wet Cat Food - Purrrrfect for Felines!
review/text: I feed my cat Stashu the dry grain free Halo food too!  The combination of the Halo Wet & Dry Grain Free food is wonderful!!!  Stashu used to "Toot" all the time, so much so it made you think he was stinky!!  Our dog eats Halo dry food too, so I put Stashu on Halo brand and he no longer "Toots" like crazy !  Big improvement and he absolutely loves it!  I feed him the wet Halo food to help keep his "Urinary Tract" healthy and he likes dry food so I give him a little of the Halo Grain Free dry food every day too.  He had no adverse reaction to switching brands at all  (he was a stray cat I took in - I am so lucky!)  I'm so happy I found a Natural, Healthy GRAIN FREE cat food for him.  Cats do not eat grains, they are carnivores and require high protein diets.  I highly recommend this product for all feline lovers.  I feel good feeding this to Stashu and he is mroe than happpy and healthy eating it!

review/text: Picked up a couple of cases of this on sale for my favorite feline to try, she can be notoriously finicky and will often devour the first can of some new brand of food but turn her nose up to the same after three or four cans.  Going strong at nine cans now and she is still pouncing on it like it was can 1.  Has a pleasant enough texture with a nice little bit of juiciness (gravy) to make it all go down smooth, an ingredients list that has actual ingredients in it and most important it makes her happy so that makes me happy.

review/summary: OK for an alternative snack
review/text: Purchased this variety pack and although I was VERY impressed with Amazon Prime shipping (I literally received it in less than 24 hours!), the snack itself is average tasting.  Mostly like flavorless cardboard.  The best flavor is the jalapeno one, pretty spicy.  It satisfies the crunch and salt factor, but no way is this a replacement for real chips.  I recommend PopChips original flavor which reminds me of Munchos, or PopChips BBQ flavor; both are satisfying and taste very good.  I would NOT purchase these Gourmet Basics Smart Fries again.  I even joked with my co-workers when they asked me what I was eating.."They're Smart Fries, but they're not so smart since they don't taste that good!"  They tasted for themselves and they all pretty much agreed with me.

review/summary: Too Salty for Me!
review/text: I'm really disappointed in these, unless for some reason I got a bad box of them!  I've been buying the plain Pop Chips for over a year now, very happy with them but was looking for something new.  Well, these are too salty for me,,,,,I can't eat them.  So I'm giving the entire box away tomorrow to get them out of here.  What a bummer!  That's the problem when you try something new with Amazon in the food category, you have to buy a boatload,,,and if it doesn't work out, you've wasted $20.00.  I don't  see what the point is in air popping something so it's low in fat but then making it way too salty,,,,sure defeats the purpose in my viewpoint.  Not good,,,,I'm really not pleased.

review/summary: Healthy and delicious, wish they were cheap.
review/text: For the cost this is not a good snack but if you don't mind how expensive they are then these can't be beat for calorie counters. A single bag offers tremendous taste and fulfillment for such low levels of calories and fat. My wife loves Popchips and I don't count calories but we both love these fries (mostly). Brief flavour rundown:<br /><br />Jalapeno is very hot. Tastes good. If you like jalapeno, you'll love these.<br /><br />Honey Mustard is the best flavour. Rich, bold, strong taste, very flavourful and high quality.<br /><br />Sea Salt is good but bare and basic.<br /><br />Honey BBQ is great. Weak BBQ flavour compared to most potato chips but still quality.<br /><br />Vinegar is decent, pretty good vinegar taste, again weak compared to most potato chips.<br /><br />Vintage Cheddar is the poorest of the lot, with a dry and musty white cheddar taste, which though real, tastes fake.

review/text: These smart fries are a great alternative to the usual chips, pretzels, and tortilla chips. You get a heap of pieces for 110 cals (I think about 60), and it definitely does satisfy that salty snack craving I get from time to time. As for the flavors, we got the 6 variety mix. Some were definitely good (the BBQ and japapeno ones were best in my opinion) but others were a bit rough to get through (like the vinegar/salt). Regardless, I definitely plan to get some more in the future.

review/text: I love cheese-flavored snacks and I was highly disappointed by these. Their styrofoam texture was offset only by putrid tang of faux cheese powder. I'm pretty sure the only good Smart Fries flavor is salt and vinegar.

review/text: Last time I went to the store(Big Lots) I was just looking around for a moment and my mom spotted the Smart Fries, she knows that I am calorie conscious. She grabs the Smart Fries and tells me, "look these have 80% less fat". We bought the product of course, when we got home I was hungry and ate half the bag my mom ate the other half. They were delicious, crunchy, airy texture, also great flavor, low in fat and calories! I want to buy more.<br />My mom is not calorie conscious and loved the fries.

review/text: This is by far the best alternative to french fries.. they are low calorie & so light to eat. I will definitely keep ordering them & reordering them. I love the fact that they give an assortment of flavors in each box. My family & friends are constantly asking for another flavor to try.... Good job making these Smart Fries...

review/summary: Not bad, not great...
review/text: I personally did not like these, but I gave the rest of the box to my mother and she had me order two more cases.  These are probably a good item for dieting because you think you are getting a lot for the calorie amount, but the flavor to me (and my husband) was sort of gummy and styrofoamy.  I could not finish a whole bag.  That didnt mean I was full, that meant I had gotten tired of them and wanted something more satisfying.  It is like eating a pound of celery when you really wanted a grilled cheese.<br /><br />By the way, I love the Pop Chips.  Much more flavor.<br />And my review was up for no less than a minute when I got a "not helpful" so I am not sure how this is not helpful, but the company requested that I write a review. If they are not happy that I didnt like the product, that is too bad.

review/summary: Need Improvement
review/text: Love Pop Chips and thought I'd give these a try.  First of all, I should say that the flavors are really, really good.  However, something in the manufacturing process ensures that very little flavor actually "sticks" to the fries.  I wish they could somehow infuse the flavor INTO the fries themselves.  As they are, they are like eating little pieces of styrofoam with a tiny bit of flavored powder on them.  As soon as the enter your mouth, the flavor comes off and you're left to chew and swallow the tasteless piece of styrofoam.  They use plenty of seasoning...it's just that most of it ends up in the bottom of the bag.  Dry powder just doesn't stay on a dry fry very well.  These have the potential of being very good.  And it's a good sized snack for the calories.  I just wish the actual fries had some flavor, instead of just the powder that falls right off.

review/text: This was the first time I had any issues with an order from Amazon - and the vendor handled it quickly and generously!  My order came in from the shipping company in a rather squashed box and I thought it was okay at first, but once I got a better look, the bags inside the box all had been pushed on hard enough to have small holes, so I emailed the vendor through Amazon and they responded the same afternoon that they would ship out a new box with the product I had ordered!  I think these smart fries are the best snacks and my two year old loves them too, so we were very excited about the quick resolution!  Thank you!

review/summary: Salted Styrofoam - But Low-Cal!
review/text: Gourmet Basics indeed! I think the basics are to keep it simple and let the natural flavor of the food shine through. I am blown away that they have actually managed to make a "natural food" taste faker than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00346J90Y">Andy Capp Hot Fries, 3-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>. Rice cakes have a luxurious mouth-feel compared to these. I couldn't get past the fake flavor and horrible texture.<br /><br />I just can't imagine what type of odd palate people must have to think that these abominations are tasty. Perhaps people who are on a restricted diet might find these a convenient snack food. Or parents tricking their kids into eating healthy. I can almost promise the parents that these snacks will go uneaten. I would have been more likely to eat the unsweetened Baker's Chocolate in the pantry before I'd eat these.<br /><br />Though this product might be suggested by Amazon if you purchase Popcorners or Popchips, do not buy it. These are nothing like Popcorners or Popchips, these "Smart Fries" are nothing but awful.

review/summary: You eat potato snacks for potato flavor
review/text: I really like potato snacks and have not tried many that I did not like. This one however, I felt I had to report my experience. These are the worst potato snacks I have ever tried. not only do they not taste like potatoes, but they are also very bland as well. Put it this way, I received a case of 12 3oz bags and I opened one bag and ate about half the bag. The rest I had to throw out and I won't even inflict coworkers with this product by leaving them in the break room for free. Instead, I plan on using the bags as shipping protection to fill empty space inside a few boxes I have outgoing. That's right folks, packing material. That's what these excess bags of smart fries are good for.

review/text: After reading all the raving reviews I decide to order the 6-Flavor variety pack.  I tried the Honey Mustard & Onion as well as the Sea Salt.  The Honey Mustard & Onion has a decent flavor but it fades almost as soon as you start crunching.  The Sea Salt had almost no flavor at all.  The texture is great, a bit like a skinnier, more crunchy (yet light) Cheese puff.  I love the texture, I love the idea but the flavor needs to be amped up CONSIDERABLY.  I wish I hadn't purchase so much since I don't want to eat them.

review/summary: Very very tasty snack
review/text: Attracted by the packaging, I purchased a bag [of the Classic Sea Salt flavor] in a local 'gourmet market'.  At 110 calories, I suspected that I had been, as frequently happens, fooled by the 'serving size' (you know how it goes, 2.5 pieces = a 'serving' - so there are actually 7 'servings'/bag)  BUT, NO, what a pleasant surprise - 110 calories was for the WHOLE delicious bag!  They're non-greasy, light as a feather and unexpectedly filling - I almost couldn't finish the bag.  I noticed they were produced here in NY, which I also liked and, after going online to find out more about them, decided to splurge for a case [of 1 oz. bags] to try all the varieties.<br /><br />One ounce doesn't sound like very much but they are so light that it is actually a very full bag and definitely more than enough for a single serving.  (The 3 oz. bag contains substantially more then you would want for just one person)<br /><br />Favorites so far are:<br />Honey Mustard & Onion<br />Vintage Cheese<br />Classic Sea Salt<br /><br />I don't have kids but I expect these would work extremely well as a lunch box addition.<br /><br />My only suggestion to the company would be that it might be a good idea if they made them available for purchase in smaller quantities.  I'm afraid many people will be put off by having to purchase in 12- & 24-bag sized cases.<br /><br />But, if you do decide to purchase, I also have no doubt that you'll have no trouble sharing them with friends and will probably be back for more sooner than you expected.

review/summary: Best, Healthy and Low-Fat Alternative for Cheetos Puffs!!
review/text: I purchased the variety pack and have been able to try out all the flavors. This Vintage Cheddar variety is one of my faves. If you're a Cheetos Puffs fan and want to cut back on calories and fat, this is the product for you.<br /><br />The texture in both are similar -- light and airy. So is the taste. Of course, it's not an exact match, but nothing else on the market this low in fat content comes close. (And I've tried several alternatives.)<br /><br />To compare nutritional info on a 1-oz. bag, Cheetos Puffs contains 160 calories compared to Gourmet Basics' 110. As for fat grams, Cheetos Puffs has 9 grams and 1 gram saturated versus GB's 2 grams of fat and 0 saturated. On the flip side, the sodium content on the GB is higher at 340mg compared to Cheetos' 250mg. Carb count is also higher in the GB at 22 grams as compared to Cheetos' 16.<br /><br />I'm sold on this product and my next order will be for a carton of this flavor alone.

review/text: I have tried half of the flavors so far, and every one of them has tasted OUT OF THIS WORLD! for a package of snack food that has very little crap in it, i'm really surprised at how great they taste. I would definitely buy this stuff again. Hope they make more products like this!!

review/summary: met expectations
review/text: Met expectations--filling, flavorful, one bag is very generous portion, non-greasy.  Flavors are not very distinctive.  BBQ was best, but not well distributed.  Six adults tried them and Six adults liked them.

review/summary: Smart Fries- Best snack ever!
review/text: There are not many things that taste good that you can eat an entire bag for 1.5 grams of fat!  This product is great for diets and an awesome alternative to chips.  They taste great and are filling.  So glad I discovered them.  Also the company has fantastic customer service if needed.

review/summary: Better than expected!
review/text: After being on a very strict diet for over two years, the same foods, day in and day out, become repetitious, and it becomes very difficult to maintain the will-power to continue.  However, Smart Fries are an excellent product that offers a bit of a variety to a healthful diet.  As another customer wrote, I, too, was skeptical of purchasing this product, but, at 110 calories per bag, I was very impressed and have become a loyal customer after the first try.  Additionally, I find that I can not eat an entire bag.  My fiancee and I shared a bag of the Smart Fries, and I had some left over for another meal.  A great product for those looking for healthy alternatives, while maintaining a great taste.

review/summary: Tasty Snack, Very satisfying!
review/text: These Snacks are SO SO good. They do NOT taste like a healthy snack and are very satisfying. I love the Honey BBQ, Honey Mustard and Onion and cheddar. The texture reminds me of wise onion ring chips and they are yummy! This is the 3rd time I am buying it and I have a feeling I will be buying it for a long time!
