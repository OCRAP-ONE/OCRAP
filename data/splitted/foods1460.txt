review/summary: Awesome for the low carb diets!
review/text: For over a year now I have been enjoying this product. I eat very few carbs and, as anyone who limits carbs knows, there are very few snacks to bring on the go with you. This is the perfect solution! At first I thought "Seaweed? Really?" but figured I enjoy seaweed on sushi so why not give it a try. I have been hooked ever since! It doesn't taste fishy or have any funky "ocean" flavors and when it's paired with the olive oil and salt it really is as addicting as potato chips. I buy the family packs now and my entire family is hooked on seaweed. We bring it hiking, to the movies and to work! It has about .6g of carbs for the entire pack of 4 sheets. Thanks SeaSnax for giving us this awesome HEALTHY product!!

review/summary: Great Healthy Snack
review/text: This is an extremely tasty seaweed snack.  The biggest plus to this product however, is the fact that it is roasted with Olive Oil.  Most commercial seaweed snacks are roasted in rancid, unhealthy canola oil or soybean oil.  So the only option for health conscious people was to buy the raw nori sheets and roast them ourselves, which is fine but a bit of a pain.  Kudos to SeaSnax for stepping in and filling the void.  The only downside is they are a bit pricey but that sometimes happens when a company is first to market with a compelling product.  Hopefully others will get in on the act and competition will drive the price a bit.  Also, there is no real "Amazon" discount vs buying at Whole Foods, but not everybody lives near a WF and not all WF's stock this product.

review/summary: Yummy low-cal snack
review/text: As anybody who grew up on Asian food, I love seaweed snacks.  I saw this at Whole Foods and tried it and loved it.  The lightly salted taste was perfect.  However, this is a bit pricey considering you can get the same thing at an Asian supermarket for half the price.  But if you don't live close to an Asian supermarket, this will have to do.<br />My only complaint about this product is how big the sheets are.  It would be better if they cut it into smaller pieces.  Every time when I eat this, I get seaweed and salt all over myself.

review/text: I like rice cakes and all sorts of health food my husband would describe as cardboard, but this is probably one of the most unappealing things I've ever tasted. No, it does not compare to potato chips. I smells a little like gold fish food and I imagine the taste is not far off as this tastes terrible. However, my order was placed with vitacost.com and their service was good. This product even shipped 1 week earlier than expected.

review/summary: Tonino Tuna with Jalapeno
review/text: If one attempts to rationlize this selection as I do, you conclude that the jalapeno in the jar is one expensive pepper, albeit beautiful, since it displaces one of the seven fillets of truly delectable yellowfin tuna.  Stated differently, it is a one dollar jalapeno.  However, less is more here because the flavor that results from steeping the tuna in that pepper and in the top quality olive oil is incomparable.  Worth every penny.  An awesome delicacy.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: It is hard to find cereals when you have food allergies. I can't have dairy, soy, gluten, or nuts, and the options available were usually very bland and very low in fiber and other nutritional value. This granola, however, is both scrumptious and nutritious. There is flax so it's high in fiber and other nutrients, and the chocolate bits are very tasty. The only reason I don't give it five stars is that it has a slightly odd, almost chemical smell/taste at first. I don't know if I got used to it or if the smell dissipated, but after the first few bites I didn't mind it at all (and I have since finished the whole package). And as anyone with a food allergy knows, there's no perfect product out there.

review/text: I took a tour of the Numi facility in Oakland and I am totally sold on them as a company. If you are going to drink tea, drink their tea. Its a brother and sister operation, they are good to their suppliers all the way down the chain, they try to be really efficient with the way they ship and their products are all real - not "natural flavors" ie jasmine tea uses real jasmine flowers to scent the tea - most spray it on to get the smell.<br /><br />The Puerh bricks are really cool, like a choclolate bar. Break off the one chunk and drop it in the pot and you can get several steeps. Good rich flavor.

review/summary: Modify Your Expectations
review/text: These are Turkish apricots that differ from varieties found in the U.S.  Dried Turkish apricots are moister and thicker and have a somewhat tangy taste.  Since these apricots are unsulphured, they are brown.  (Sulphur is used manly to make fruits look more attractive.  Sulphured apricots are yellow, just as sulphured "golden" raisins are.)<br /><br />Any bag of dried fruit (organic or not) will most likely have a piece or two that is drier and tougher than the rest. Made in Nature is no different.<br /><br />I find the fruit to be mostly sweet and chewy.  This is a good mid-day snack.  Dried apricots can also be finely chopped and cooked with oatmeal.  The reasealable bags are terrific. I will continue to purchase these as the price is lower than health food stores and shipping is free on orders of $25 and up.

I,ve been shopping from the health food stores for over 25 years. Let me say that the color is not as bright and cheerful as the non- organic counterpart but keep in mind that this is all natural. It was not treated with chemicals, preservatives or colorings. This is good tasting and good for you. For me, it is good quality and deliscious. I will order this again and other natural fruit products by them. Enjoy!

review/summary: These Apricots Aren't Dried Properly
review/text: One star.  These Apricots aren't dried all the way through.  Some of them were fine, but others were wet inside and tasted off.  They gave me a stomach ache and the runs.  They were even stored in the refrigerator after opening.  I ended up throwing out the rest of the first package.  I thought I just had gotten a bad batch.  When I went to open the second bag, I noticed that two of the remaining bags (out of the 6 pack) were fat with air - like they could explode eventually.  That is bacteria inside giving off their gaseous byproduct.  If you've ever seen a can of food that wasn't properly canned, you'll know what I mean.  They can rupture.  I threw out the remaining bags because Amazon only has a thirty day return policy.  Don't waste your money!  There are better dried fruits out there that won't make you sick.

review/summary: I really like these
review/text: Based on the reviews here, there clearly isn't a consensus on these.  Personally, I really like them.  I tried them for the first time last week after buying them from Amazon, and after finishing my first bag of them, my opinion hasn't changed from my first bite - very tasty.  After raisins, apricots are my dried fruit of choice.  These are the first organic dried apricots that I've tasted, and they have a stronger flavor than the ones that I've had in the past.  They are less tangy, but they have more of a sugary taste to them that I think makes them great for a sweet snack.<br /><br />As mentioned, they are dark in color and therefore do not look like the dried apricots that most people are probably used to seeing.  However, I think they taste great, and I particularly like that they are organic.  People may want to try a single bag from the local store before ordering these seeing as how they appear to be a love them or hate them item.

review/summary: quite inconsistent
review/text: We normally buy organic dried unsulphured Turkish apricots in bulk 5# packages through a food club.  They are always plump and moist even after the package has been opened and put into smaller packages and stored in the refrigerator for a few weeks.  I decided to try these small bags because most of the reviews were positive.<br /><br />We were very disappointed. There is a difference between "dried" and "all dried up". Most of these Made In Nature brand individual fruits are all dried up!  In fact, they are closer to being like dried apples than to being like apricots.<br /><br />The apricots are "OK" when you first open the bag, with a few of them being as plump and moist as the bulk apricots we usually eat.  However, after being stored in the refrigerator for even one day a high percentage of them are extremely dry and hard to chew. This has been true of all of the 6 bags we received in this shipment.  We will not be ordering them again.  We are going back to ordering the 5# bulk bags of unsulphered Turkish apricots from our food club.

review/text: I bought these mainly to make apricot oatmeal for my baby, and I have to say it has become my signature baby food because even my adult friends and family members love to eat my apricot oatmeal. I soak the apricots in water overnight, then boil them in another pot of water. The apricot water smells and tastes so good! Then I use the water to make oatmeal with it along with puree apricots. I love the fact is that they are organic and safe for my baby. They are also cheaper than those sold in the organic stores. I also like the bags are resealable, so they don't get stale first. I always look for ways to cut down my grocery budget, but these are just one of those things that you just have to spurge and eat right.

I wanted to try these to get a more natural tasting apricot. The taste of these apricots is not very much different to the brands I can get locally.  They taste pretty good.  However, the big difference is that many in each package are quite dried out, hard and tough.  I have yet to try to reconstitute them with warm water.  But I will definitely give that a try when I cook them up to make baby food.

I stewed these for a few minutes in water with a squeeze of lemon and they were much more palatable but not really flavorful.<br /><br />These are not as soft, flavorful or pretty as the non-organic apricots I would buy in the grocery store. I was hoping the organic would be better.

review/summary: What were they thinking?
review/text: Simply awful product if you are familiar with Sunsweet or other domestic brands.  I don't really care if they came from Al Sharpton's basement, they taste stale, colorless, not tangy like an apricot... OMG.  I write a lot of positive food reviews here and there is nothing to say about these.  I suppose if you were a very dedicated veg that you could mix them with some normal Sunsweet apricots and get them down.  I'm going to find a way to use them as a door stop.  Save your money, there's lot's of other brands of apricots on here including Newmans Own.

It doesn't taste artificial, and it doesn't leave me wanting for more flavor.  It is really a fantastic 100% organic, sugar free beverage, and I'll be repurchasing for sure.  I can't wait to try the other flavors :)

review/summary: Great Improvement Over Their Cookie Line in 2007
review/text: The first and last time I tried Enjoy Life cookies was back in November of 2007, when I was newly diagnosed. They were terrible. I believe I tried the Soft Baked Snickerdoodle and the Soft Baked Double Chocolate Brownie. I'm not sure if they have redeveloped those cookies since then but at that time I had decided never to buy Enjoy Life. Recently our Celiac Support Group leader returned from the CDF convention and had samples of the Enjoy Life crunchy cookies. I tried the Vanilla Honey Graham flavor and was pleasantly surprised. It would work really well for s'mores and is tasty plain. I will buy this one in the future.

review/text: My kids love these cookies, and I really like the flavor and the crunch, but I have to admit that the texture is a little grainy when chewing.  It's such a relief to give my children these cookies for a snack or dessert without having to worry about possible cross-contamination.  Two of my three children have nut allergies, and my husband and I grew up without any food allergies, so this has been a scary and trying experience for us, at times.  It's difficult to reassure your children when even you have doubts about the safety of their food and snacks.  Enjoy Life Foods really takes a lot of strain off of us by producing such thoughtful and tasty products.  Keep it up Enjoy Life because we need more products and more companies like yours!  :)

review/summary: Exceeded expectations-except the "frosting"
review/text: Looking for a soy-free, gluten-free chocolate cake mix that actually tasted good, I picked this mix up on sale. The texture was great! It far exceeded my expectations as far as both texture and taste for the cake itself. The frosting was a disappointment. I should have followed my instincts and not added all the water at once, instead one Tbsp. at a time until I got the consistency right. It tasted fine- but was completely runny and watery! I ended up dumping it over anyway, which made it like a chocolate fudge cake- which honestly didn't hurt it! Despite not looking like it should have it tasted great and even NON-GF peeps were taking it rather than the regular cake at my daughters' birthday party. I'll be buying it again, because it's great to have a decent-tasting mix that EVERYONE in the family can enjoy! Next time I'll add the water to the frosting one Tbsp. at a time, though!

review/text: I have baked many gluten free cakes from scratch. This one ended up in the trash. The 'frosting' was so thin some of it soaked into the cake, the rest spilled onto the counter. None of it actually frosted the cake. The cake itself had this weird vaguely fishy taste. I checked my oil to make sure it wasn't rancid and the eggs were fresh. Maybe the mix was rancid, I don't know. It was in airtight plastic.

review/summary: Says Mudslide but doesn't taste like it
review/text: I rarely complain about things but something is up with these K-Cups.  My wife and I got a few sample mudslide k-cups from a water distributor and really liked it.  We went looking around and found this great deal on amazon for the 50 k-cups.  Now they say mudslide on them, and I even checked the label against some other Gloria Jean coffee K-Cups we have and they appear to be the same.  However, they definitely do not taste like mudslide.  I tried cleaning my machine, running clear water cycles before brewing, etc and it doesn't help.  Not sure if it's just a bad box or something more but I definitely will not be purchasing them here again.

review/text: I think Mudslide is a really good coffee.  I'd say on a chocolate scale of 1 to 5, it's a 3.  It's subtle, nutty and makes a nice cup.  If I am drinking coffee I don't always want to be hit in the face with chocolate like you do when you have the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030H1WW0">Cafe Escapes Cafe Mocha K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 16 pack</a>.  Don't get me wrong, I like the Cafe Mocha, but sometimes you want "coffee" and not chocolate.<br /><br />I don't know what the people who give this coffee a low review rating of are drinking, because this has a very good amount of flavor.  I always do my cup at the ~10oz size and always get a nice, consistent cup.

review/summary: REAL Maple Syrup
review/text: I thought maple syrup was maple syrup but, apparently things have changed over the last several years.  I noticed a while back that the maple syrup I purchased in the store (even organic) had an "odd" taste.  It just didn't taste right.  I tried several types but, with the same result.<br /><br />Then I read a review on here about Vermont having tougher standards for maple syrup.  As in something about not allowing other sweeteners or something, don't remember exactly.<br /><br />Anyway, I decided try Brown Family Pure Vermont Maple Syrup.  Wow, major taste difference, even the after taste lingers and is very nice.  I also bake bread with maple syrup, the smell of the baking bread, and the bread flavor are much more distinct maple.

review/text: I ordered this for my husband, a die-hard maple syrup fan.  I've always been of the "any good syrup will do" opinion.  After having this syrup over waffles my husband made the morning after the shipment arrived, I'm now a convert.  We will definitely continue our subscription to regular shipments of this delicious elixir!

Sometimes I even make my buckwheat pancakes for dinner just so I can have the syrup without waiting for breakfast.  The price is great and the quality is consistent between batches.

review/summary: GOOD PRICE BUT NOT THE BEST TASTE
review/text: I normally buy Maple Syrup from the Amish around here but ran short before I could get there to buy more...so I ordered this thinking it was going to be the same.  It's pretty thin and doesn't have the same full bodied flavor as making it the old fashioned way.  I wouldn't pay the price for it again.

review/summary: Great tasting syrup, excellent price
review/text: This is a GREAT tasting syrup! Not too sweet and not thin & runny like some other pure maple syrups. I was pleasantly surprised at how thick this syrup is--my husband had to check to make sure it was just maple syrup (I've been buying our maple syrup at Sam's Club & I guess we didn't realize just how runny that syrup is)<br />This has a rich amber color and great maple flavor that you can still taste even with a whole lot of butter on your pancakes or waffles (my son likes lots of butter)<br />My only complaint is that it is messy to pour. I have had other bottles of syrup with similar shaped spouts that have not been messy whereas with this spout the syrup glug-glug-glugs out.

review/text: This is good syrup.  I am a Vermonter who has lived all over the world and have missed real maple syrup.  I now live "just"  a few hundred miles from Vermont but I still don't find jugs of the real stuff very often.  Now, thank goodness,  I have a regular subscription to get jugs of this essential of life.  And it is good.

review/summary: Brown Family Farm Pure Vermont Maple Syrup
review/text: I just ordered a second jug of this syrup after finishing off my first jug yesterday.  There are some things upon which one cannot skimp, and real maple syrup is one of them.  I grew up with Mrs. Butterworth's, but now that I'm older (and buying my own groceries!), I've found that there really is no comparison between real maple syrup and the other stuff.  A 12-oz container of maple syrup is $7.99 at the grocer in my area, so this 32-oz jug is easily a better deal (and it tastes great).  Unlike the stuff from the store, this syrup is from Vermont!  Overall, I highly recommend this syrup on the bases of price and taste.

They are both equally good.

review/summary: Not Impressed
review/text: I am puzzled by the rave reviews - I was not especially impressed.  Maybe I had a bad batch.  But I have had PHENOMENAL Maple Syrup that tasted literally like butter - homemade on the farm in upper State New York.  Admittedly nothing else compares but this stuff was pretty tasteless - Spring Tree is at least one star better.  I would not order again -<br /><br />BTW - I don't think syrup s/b left in these plastic containers - I suggest moving them to glass asap.  I notice my other one picked up the taste of the plastic (I gave the Brown Family away so I did not have it that long).

review/summary: Rich dark flavor, highly addictive!
review/text: This maple syrup has a very rich flavor.  It is a little "darker" than what you might typically find in the grocery store, but I thought that gave it a richer depth.  I will never go back to artificial maple syrup again!  A little goes a long way and it is wonderful on all the typical breakfast fare, and divine drizzled over  vanilla ice cream.  I've even used it when making bread.

review/summary: My first REAL maple syrup experience
review/text: I have been making my own maple-flavored syrup for over 40 yrs and wanted to experience the "real thing" so I purchased this highly-rated syrup and gave it a try. Since my home-made syrup only costs a small fraction of the real thing, I was expecting a huge difference. Nope, the real maple syrup is good but I have to admit I like my home-made stuff just as much. Everyone has different tastes so there is no right or wrong. It's all subjective.

review/text: I am not a maple syrup authority. All I can say is that this syrup is delicious with plenty of fresh maple flavor. My only disappointment is that after purchasing it I discovered a comparable syrup at my local grocery for about $4 less. My recommendation is to check local sources first and, if you don't find anything comparable for a comparable price, buy this one.

review/text: This is a slightly darker maple syrup, and the flavor is fantastic! Seriously, once you've tried this stuff, you'll never want to go back to the artificially-flavored drek ("maple-flavored" syrup).  Yes, it's more expensive, but the taste is worth it. I use it on pancakes and waffles, and brush a little on chunks of sweet potato before roasting them to bring out the sweetness and flavor. Excellent product, good price.

review/summary: Fake maple syrup is a crime against food
review/text: When the food packaging laws were revised back in the 90s, the word "maple" disappeared off a lot of syrup bottles because they had no maple in them. Thankfully, this is the real stuff. It has a delicate maple flavor. Great for icing, maple cookies and breakfast for those who prefer a hint of maple taste. If you want a stronger maple taste, go with a grade B syrup.<br /><br />Real maple syrup is thinner than the flavored corn syrup you may be used to. It's also a lot more expensive. You can get the most out of it by pouring the syrup into a small bowl, cutting the pancakes/waffles/French toast into pieces and dipping them in the syrup with a fork. That way it doesn't get wasted when you wash the plate.

review/summary: Very good maple syrup
review/text: This syrup has a wonderful intense flavor which means you don't need much of it, either as a topping or in a recipe.  We use very few sweeteners, but when I need something really special for a fruit and nut bar treat I add a bit of this syrup and WOW! the flavor explodes.  We sometimes use it on blueberry buckwheat pancakes also and that makes a breakfast from heaven.  There may be better maple syrups out there somewhere (or not?) but at this price I think the Brown Family brand should satisfy most anyone.
