review/summary: Dogs love it!
review/text: I bought this because it's a tad more affordable than Natural Balance's food roll.  I cut this roll up into bite size pieces and use it as a positive food reward when training my dogs.  Much to my suprise, both my cats LOVE this stuff as well so I crumble a bit of it into their food and they gobble it right down.  My eldercat is thin and I have a hard time keeping weight on her, and she will just about do back flips for this stuff.  Came as a huge shock to me because she only likes sweet, creamy treats like cream and yogurt.  Anyway, 4 lbs cut into cubes will last you a pretty long time, and when fed as treats won't cause your animal to have gastric upset.. atleast not mine.  2 thumbs up!

review/summary: Always Pleased
review/text: I've used Redbarn beef rolls and chicken and liver rolls for many years..  Because they are a balanced food, they don't create nutritional gaps if used often for positive reinforcement and are great for puppy training.  I would cut them up into small squares and put them in sandwich baggies for my pockets. I prefer Redbarn to other brands because they do not cause the enormous stools the others do, which tells me those brands contain a lot of filler.  They also do not contain nitrites.  Eventually I began using them to feed a very picky eater who was always too thin, which is the reason I still purchase them, though she is no longer too thin!  They do contain wheat, an allergen for many dogs.  The Lamb & Rice flavor does not, but my picky eater won't eat that one.

review/text: I think Fruity Cheerios is a great alternative to some of the sweet kid's cereals on the market.  A serving has 9 grams of sugar which turns out to be a lot less than many of the kid's cereals out there.  The flavors are mild and remind me more of real fruit juices rather than candy.  My kiddos love it for their cereal and snacking.

review/text: Cheerios Fruity Cereal has much more of a fruit flavor than other kids' cereal. The overpowering artificial candy taste that makes me crings is missing, along with some of the sugar. Kids and adults will like it. While it's not a "health" cereal, it is better than other brands of flavored breakfast food.<br /><br />It also tastes pretty good out of the box, so a little in a zip-lock snack baggie makes it the perfect sweet snack for work or school.

I got them thinking (I really love Fruit Loops!! but I'm sure they are really bad for you) they'd taste like them, only be better for you, since they are Cheerios...since they kinda look like Fruit Loops even.<br /><br />Well they definitely are not the same.  And I find that these have a strange after taste sort of, hard to describe.  The first bite, I initially thought of soap to be honest?!?!  I don't know if its the sugar or fruit taste...but its a strange taste.  So I probably wouldn't buy these again, they weren't what I was expecting.  I much rather prefer the Honey Nut Cheerios by far.

If you like Fruity Cheerios, I would recommend purchasing it through Amazon.  If you haven't had it before, try one box from the store first, just to make sure you don't end up with six boxes of a cereal you aren't going to eat.

review/summary: Great Coffee or Postum Substitute
review/text: I am addicted to coffee and for health reasons am trying to drastically reduce my intake. I resorted to using an unopened jar of Postum left from my mom's estate, and when it was gone, looked to replace it. Much to my disbelief,  Postum was no longer being manufactured. So, I tried several substitutes before coming across the Dandy Blend from Amazon, which I'm convinced is even better than Postum. It was great.<br /><br />Sometimes I just have to have a little taste of the real thing and then I add just a tad of instant Mount Hagen Organic Cafe to the Dandy Blend. At the most I go 50/50 so I figure it's like normal, decaffeinated coffee which is still not really what I should be drinking.  I've moved on to purchasing the Dandy Blend in the 2 pound bag which I store in a large, glass, vacuum-sealed jar. I place a small amount of the blend in an air tight can for daily use. In the high humidity environment I live in, this product can clump, like instant coffee, if exposed to damp air. So, keeping a tight lid on it is important. Coffee always calmed me down and help me focus. In the past, I would have some before bedtime with organic milk.  It may have been the milk but it did not affect my sleep. Now, I can continue this ritual.  Again, for health reasons, I've totally cut out milk. Dandy Blend is sooo good, I don't need the milk.  This is truly a great product for someone who enjoys coffee but must limit or discontinue drinking the real thing.

review/summary: No dog treats from China!
review/text: My dogs love these treats, but the news that they are made in China puts an end to their love affair.<br />Here is a letter from Del Monte admitting that these treats come from China:<br />Many of my clients feed Milo's Kitchen Dog Treats to their pets. After seeing recent stories about dogs becoming sick from treats, I decided to write to Del Monte, the company that makes Milo's Kitchen brand treats.  I asked Del Monte if they could tell me if 100% of the ingredients of the Milos Kitchen Beef Jerky & Sausage are made in the US, & if any part of the beef products were sourced from China. Here's the reply:<br />April 20, 2012<br />Dear Michele,<br />Thanks for your e-mail and your interest in Milo's Kitchen Beef Sausage Slices. Three varieties of Milo's Kitchen dog treats are made in the United States - Beef Jerky, Chicken Meatballs and Beef Sausage Slices. For these three varieties, the majority of the ingredients, including the beef and chicken, come from the U.S. Two varieties - Chicken Jerky and Chicken Grillers - are made at a facility in China.<br />Regardless of which Milo's Kitchen dog treats you feed your dog, we want you to know our products are made with nutritious, quality ingredients that meet the applicable standards and specifications of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

review/summary: Subtle Chamomile Tea
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers. It is rather weak, but a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little weak and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful for me, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker or less annoying.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****

review/summary: Flavored Commercial Tea
review/text: ***<br />Stash's Lemon Ginger Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is a basic lemon ginger tea, tasting strongly of ginger, full of flavorings, and oddly, even contains soy. This is one of the better commercial highly processed, non-organic teas. I much prefer organic teas that are made without artificial flavorings and certainly without soy, but if you are not picky about herb teas, and are looking something very strongly flavored as an introduction to the world of teasans and decaffeinated beverages, this would be fine. If you like your tea more subtle, with true pure tastes, and can discern complex differences between natural and commercial teas, then this definitely is not for you, and I would recommend any Numi tea, Yogi Tea, Traditional Medicinals, or even Stash's organic line of teas (which comes in a wonderful Lemon Ginger Organic Tea!)<br /><br />Stash Lemon Ginger Tea contains ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, citric acid, and soy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, nothing special.<br />***

review/summary: Hibiscus and Raspberry--Lovely!
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, and that's great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/summary: The Best Earl Grey Bagged Tea I have Had
review/text: This tea is flavorful and delicious and became an instant favorite from the first time I have tried it. Stash Earl Grey started me into experiencing tea beyond iced and typical restaurant fare. Today I have 20 varieties of teas, both in bags and loose and Stash Earl Grey is still one of my favorites to this day. (The flavor for Stash Earl Grey loose tea is different from the bagged. The bagged is better IMO.)<br /><br />Some other flavors and brands you might like if you like Stash Earl Grey.<br /><br />Stash Vanilla Nut Decaf. A perfect desert or night time tea.  Sweetened and with milk, it is divine.<br />http://www.amazon.com/Stash-Premium-Vanilla-Tea-30-Count/dp/B003D4GSAQ/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1335572191&sr=8-6<br /><br />Teavan Mate Vanna<br />[...]

review/text: This combination of green and white tea from Stash is just right.  I don't like but can tolerate the taste of plain green tea.  The trick here is that the white tea as a nice sweetness to that green-tea taste with no sugar!  It's perfect as an after-lunch pick-me-up and as simple as boiling water, just the right amount of caffeine.  The teabags are foil-sealed, so they stay fresh a long time.  I buy in quantity to save money.  Can't go wrong with this choice.

review/summary: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea
review/text: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile.  I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you like chamomile tea, this is a good choice.

review/text: Del Monte claims that one 15.25oz can of their Low Sodium Whole Kernel Corn contains 490mg of sodium and 245 calories.  Compare this against one 15.25oz can of Del Monte's No Salt Added Whole Kernel Corn, which Del Monte claims contains only 35mg of sodium and only 210 calories.  [Why does increasing the sodium from 35mg to 490mg per can also increase the calories from 210 to 245 per can?]  It is common practice for Del Monte and all other brands of canned foods to understate the amount of sodium and the amount of calories in each can by approximately 20% to 30%.  The real number of calories in each 15.25oz can of whole kernel corn is about 276.

review/summary: Decent, but not great
review/text: When I first started to use IAMS Savory Sauce, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get a little drizzle in their kibble every once in a while, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced, and low calorie. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a "gravy" like texture and aroma that most dogs love. Not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues, but a great free solution for picky eaters.

review/text: As with Thomas Wolfes' theme in the novel "You Can't Go Home Again", attempts to relive youthful memories will always fail. Well, this product didn't exactly fail, but it was not a good as the original, plus the company didn't bring back the cherry flavored drop either.  The honey flavor was okay, but nowhere near as concentrated as the original drop.  I wonder if it is because it is advertised as "Natural Honey".  Isn't all honey "natural"?  Obviously, there was some demand for the company to attempt to bring it back, but if they went to the effort to do so, how come they did't follow their original recipe?!?!  I do like the new container as sometimes the drops got stuck together in the original box.

review/summary: Addicting and Luscious
review/text: I drink this nearly every day, and have been for at least 5 years!  I'm not a fan of many chai teas, and have found no other brand to compare to this!  This blend has a perfect, deliciously sweet and spicy aroma (from coconut, which is subtle, and cinnammon, ginger, caradamom cloves, nutmeg, and black pepper), and full-bodied flavor incredibly without bitterness.  I don't find the taste to be too spicy or too sweet, though I think it's a rare breed in that it doesn't require sweetening.  I've shared this tea with many people, and there was only 1 who said she didn't care for it, which was simply due to her literal tastebuds.  As a sidenote, the most 2 recent tins I've bought at my supermarket in September 2011 (that have best by dates of Feb. 2014) taste and smell markedly different than older tins, reminding me of vinegar or something sour.  I e-mailed Zhena's Gypsy Tea asking whether they had changed the makeup or concoction of this blend, and they thankfully said no, so they must have been bad batches, which I've never before experienced!

review/text: hiGH price and very expensive. About 40cents per full chip ( if they dont arrive smashed up!)... 3+ dollars per small baggie... but Great item. This is a homerun for me. Crispy and tasty. Great snack. This will not fill you up and is not a meal by any means. It is just a little snack with a great taste.

review/summary: Twang Beer Salt, Lime
review/text: If you like a little salt and lime in your beer Twang is the best product. I have tried other brands and they don't compare.<br />It is even good to use for cooking. Great in beer. If you try it once you will use it all the time in your beer. Great in all beers, best in lite beer. If you liked the older style of Miller Chill, it will remind you of that flavor. Highly recommend it.<br />If you buy a case you  are set for a long time depending on how much you like it.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZGY7X0">Twang Beer Salt, Lime, 1.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 24)</a>

review/text: These bars are so good. I don't like most protein bars because of the strong protein taste. I do taste a little bit of the protein still cause there is a lot of protein, but mainly I taste peanut butter and crunchy-ness. The chocolate bars, to me, taste like a Kit Kat w a little peanut butter.<br />I love these bars! I think they are worth the try.

review/summary: These Bars Are Awesome
review/text: I've tried lots of different protein bars over the years and these are by far the tastiest (Triple Choc is the best in my opinion) - I actually look forward to eating these things!  I sometimes eat one of these in place of lunch or as a snack in the late morning and middle of the day (half in the mid-morning, half after lunch).<br /><br />The bars are relatively low-cal and have a decent amount of protein which, per their packaging, is more easily absorbed than other protein supplements.  I can't speak to their science but the bars seem to be working for me . . . I've lost around 10 lbs over the past month and put on a lot of muscle.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good protein bar, look no further.

review/summary: Crunchy and Sweet
review/text: I am following a low carb way of eating and was looking for a protein bar that didn't remind me of a tootsie roll.  This is nice and crunchy, but a little too sweet for my taste.  So instead of eating it by itself, I add it to my morning breakfast of greek yogurt, nuts, and coconut oil/flax seed oil.  Now the sweetness is offset by the tartness of the yogurt, and perfectly balanced out.

review/summary: Finally a protein bar I can digest
review/text: I can't eat most of the protein bars because the protein in them don't digest well (whey, soy, milk).  But this one (proto whey) is really great.  Doesn't bother my tummy at all.  This tastes good, doesn't give me a sugar high, and is a great meal replacement for breakfast or before workout.  I've tried it in just about all the available flavors and all have been good.  Protein shakes made with proto whey is great, too.

review/text: When I am short on time to eat a proper meal, one of these bars and a beverage fits the bill.<br /><br />If I eat one of these and have a large coffee or a glass of iced tea, I won't be hungry for 3 hours.<br /><br />They taste great, have a nice texture and a good balance of protein, carbs and fats.<br /><br />I have tried all the flavors and the triple chocolate crunch is my favorite.<br /><br />They don't spike and crash my blood sugar like some bars do.<br /><br />If you have them in any kind of heat, like stashed in your purse or car, they will melt in the package.<br /><br />I keep these at home in our pantry to grab if the baby is upset and I haven't had a moment to eat anything.<br /><br />The price here on Amazon is the cheapest you will find ANYwhere.

review/text: Like all the other reviewers, I have tried many protein bars.  These are by FAR the very best I have ever eaten!  Great for post workout, or a grab and go in the morning or for snack.  They taste like those sugar wafer cookies I ate when I was little... Of course, these don't have near the sugar - so I guess it's more like the sugar wafer cookies with a "less sweet" but still delicious filling! :)  Peanut butter crunch and cookies and cream are both d'lish!

I like it because of the different texture than a lot of bars. Most I have tried have been sort of gummy and chewy, but this has the nice cripness of the cookie wafer.
