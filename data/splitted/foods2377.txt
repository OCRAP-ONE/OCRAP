review/summary: addictive
review/text: we discovered justin's nut butter after buying it at whole foods.<br />however other people must have caught on because they can barely keep the hazelnut butter in stock now.<br /><br />we bought it because it was a vegan alternative to Nutella- no milk in it. I can tell you, as a vegetarian that still allows milk and dairy into my diet, this is actually BETTER then nutella once you stir it and get it whipped into a frosting-like texture.<br /><br />it's a healthier, organic alternative to nutella or other products and just what you need for that chocolate fix, without the guilt. granted, you can still go overboard and eat more than is healthy! you may want to start or pace yourself with the small pouches (think serving size) that they may also offer.<br /><br />good stuff. addictive!

review/summary: SOO Good!
review/text: I can't get enough of this stuff! This is an amazing product and one that I can feel good about indulging in. Unlike its more popular counterpart, it has just 7g of sugar per serving rather than 21g. That's tremendous!<br /><br />But the even bigger pay off is the taste. Decadent, delicious, rich, and thoroughly satisfying. As others have mentioned, it's not as smooth as Nutella. It's more the consistency of natural creamy peanut butter. This made no difference to me.  I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />I also want to give kudos to Amazon.com for their customer service. This item was erroneously reported as delivered when it had not been. This is the third time that I've had this issue with UPS. Amazon promptly sent out a replacement and scheduled Saturday delivery. I was very impressed.

review/summary: Disappointed :(
review/text: It really pains me to give this product a bad review. It is such a good idea and I really wanted to like it.<br /><br />I purchased Justines Chocolate Hazelnut Butter Blend at Whole Foods - a total impulse purchase. I'd never heard of it. I am crazy about Nutella and don't trust myself to buy it more than once a year, as I eat it by the spoon and I'm lucky if it lasts 3 days !!!  This product sounded great and I saw the mostly good reviews.<br /><br />It just doesn't taste that good. It feels greasy and is pretty flavorless. I see from another review that Justine recently changed the formulation - that reviewer commented that  the "blend" isn't as tasty as the original. I wish W/F had had the little 99-cent sample so I could have tried this before dropping $10 (!!!) on the jar.<br /><br />Although it was a noble effort, this product is too caloric (and expensive) - I will stick with Nutella for my splurges!

review/summary: Too salty
review/text: The formula seems much healthier than Nutella, but some parts were too salty. Absolutely not satisfying as Nutella.<br />Also, my package had some chocolate outside. Why? The package was sealed internally and the pot was not broken, so I don't know why there was chocolate on the outside part of the lid. Poor handling at the factory?<br />Better would be something between this and Nutella.

review/summary: Does the new almond addition ruin the taste?
review/text: I agree with the other review stating that the original version was better. It was. One thing I'd like to add however. In my opinion, it was better, but not "way better." I would be happy if they brought the older version back but this version is still very good. I really like it. Could be that the original version was 5 stars, but this one deserves 4, not one. I mean, they only added some almonds, the sugar is still the same, and hazelnuts are still the first ingredient. I think some people are just upset at the formula change that they went from five starts to one. Not me. I still like it.

review/text: I thought this would be wonderful because I love nuttela!  Let me tell you this is a terrible product.  I have never had a nut butter that was so bad.  Even the natural peanutbutter I tried wasn't this bad.  First let me say if your looking for a Nuttela like product, buy Nuttela.  This product tastes like they took peanut shells, added water, oil, and a pinch of poor quality chocolate put it in a blender and pulsed it twice.  The texture is gritty at best, I swear they used shells not nuts!  Horrible, thew it away immediately.

review/summary: If you haven't tried this -- WHY NOT???
review/text: A normal, off the shelf pasta has about 220 calories per 2oz (dry, uncooked) serving.  Very few people actually eat JUST 2 ounces -- this is why pasta has gotten such a bad reputation in the quest to loose weight or maintain a healthy weight.  The wheat provides a small amount of protein, but unless you're eating whole wheat pasta (ik) it doesn't provide fiber.<br /><br />Enter Fiber Gourmet products!  That same 2oz dry serving has only 130 calories, plus it also has 18 (can you believe it?) grams of fiber.  And it isn't grainy like whole wheat pasta, or slimy like some of the low-carb things that hit the market a few years ago with the Adkins craze.  In fact, it tastes just like regular pasta.<br /><br />And they make it in several of the most popular shapes.  And if you go to the Fiber Gourmet site, they also make it in several popular flavors -- my favorites are the red/black pepper, the cajun, and the garlic/parsley.  They evidently also make tomato, but have been out of it every time I've gone looking.<br /><br />It's really good stuff.  :D  Hard to argue with 130 calories and 18g of fiber, now matter what kind of sauce or pesto you put on it!

review/summary: Seriously, amazing
review/text: I have been getting FiberGourmet pastas since I first heard about them - probably a few years ago? I, and my entire family, LOVE these pastas. I have since swapped them in for literally every pasta dish we've made with fantastic success. The lasagna makes perfect lasagna, the fettuccine (both unflavored short and flavored nested) can stand up to any sauce, and the penne is a great standby. I've even served friends who were initially hesitant but then had to go make their own order.<br /><br />Given that the average American doesn't eat nearly enough fiber, and that these offer so much - along with a great reduction in unnecessary calories - I think these are just marvelous. Some of my older family members, who are really cautious about their net carbs for metabolic/blood sugar reasons, say that these are the best way they can enjoy pasta without impacting their health.

Later I got a hesitant note from her stating that they had expired in May 2011. I ordered them on Dec 1, 2011. Embarrassing and disappointing. Of course I got a refund from Amazon with no problem.

review/summary: Very Special Honey with Unique Flavor
review/text: This is a specialty item we ordered as we were tempted by the prospect of the chestnut flavor in the honey itself. It's a lovely honey--very flavorful with a beautiful scent, color, and taste. It goes best with a straightforward (non-flavored) tea such as English Breakfast. If you pair it with a flavored tea (mint, chamomile, Earl Grey, or such), the scent and taste of the chestnuts will be overwhelmed, so stick with what's simple and mild. This honey is also great on plain yogurt, and I'd imagine it would be super as an addition to mildly flavored baked loaves, such as lemon bread. We're glad we gave it a try.

review/summary: illy issimo caff&egrave;
review/text: Illy issimo caff&egrave; Italian espresso style coffee drink is a 6.8 fl. oz. (200 ml) blast of sweetened caffeine in a can.<br /><br />1930s Italy under the rule of Mussolini greatly contributed to the development of modern coffee culture, improved coffee-making, and new types of coffee-making equipment. The Horn of Africa (where coffee originated) was under Italian colonization and companies such as illy and Bialetti were founded.<br /><br />In that tradition, this drink is now made in Denmark under the issimo brand from illy and distributed in the U.S. by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />This canned cappuccino has a slightly bitter dark roast coffee taste with the right amount of sugar and a pleasant mouthfeel. It's not as good as freshly made espresso but it's not bad at all. I do prefer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">illy issimo cappucino</a> as a treat.

review/summary: Recommended over packets for Diabetics
review/text: Dr. Berstein, in his book Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution (available on Amazon) recommends tablets over packets because packets include a filler that adds carbs. This is a great tablet in Coffee. I prefer NuStevia tablets in hot tea but Splenda minis are good in hot tea also. The package is great for on the go folks, have not had any dispenser malfunctions. Stores don't normally carry the tablets for some reason. I found this at my local Wegeman's, the only store near me that carries them, for 2.99 a pack. That is cheaper than this item on Prime. However, it took me awhile to find a store and then had to go get them so for a couple bucks more, Amazon might be the option for you.<br /><br />Overall, a very good alternative to packets for diabetics following Dr. Bernstein's advice. The package indicates one mini tablet equals 1/2 packet. Each package contains 100 mini tablets. I like the one-click dispenser, I never have to touch the tablet.

review/text: I was happy to find this item. I had a similar item for my Equal, but I have switched to Splenda because it doesn't lose its sweetness in hot beverages. This pocket dispenser is great, it dispenses one tablet with each press of the release button. The only reason for the 4 stars is that these tablets do NOT actually equate one tablet to a packet. It's more like 3 tablets are the equivalent of 2 Splenda packets. But all in all, I am happy with these dispensers for their convenience.

review/summary: Great Way To Carry Splenda - Highly Recommended
review/text: Splenda Minis are a very convenient way to carry Splenda with you when traveling.<br /><br />I mostly use Splenda since the other non-sugar sweeteners have never tasted "right" to me, but not every restaurant or person I'm visiting serves it. I had started to carry the little packets (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I6JPQQ">Splenda No Calorie Sweetener, Granular, Individual Packets, 700-Count Box</a>) with me, but they get grungy if left in the pocket too long and do take up a good bit of space.<br /><br />The 200 Splenda Minis in the hard plastic dispenser are equal to 100 packets, so these will last a good long time. Note: Be sure to give the tablets time to dissolve and stir well.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/text: I have used Splenda for years mostly packets and mini's when they came on the market. Retailers use to sell them at food stores, then it stopped. Packets are a good option but can be messy if you are carrying them around. They become torn and a mess of powder. Not with the Splenda Mini'a they are like small mini suger cubes in a dispenser that fits into pocket, bag or drawer. They taste the same and you may need less since each mini packs flavor. I do not know why more stores do not carry them, since they great for tea, coffee and hot beverages. Retailers do not have to carry them. We are lucky we can get them from Amazon. I am enjoying my pack. :-)

review/summary: Hooray for quick, easy Splenda!
review/text: Splenda is such a popular sweetener, I would think that most restaurants would know to carry it by now--I, at least, highly prefer it over any other artificial sweetener. In fact, it's the only one I'll use. I can't stand the taste of anything else, so if there's no Splenda on the table, I won't order iced tea. I'll drink water, and the restaurant will be out a few bucks on my beverage!<br /><br />I don't have that excuse anymore now, of course. I have a Splenda Minis pack in my purse, and all I have to do is pop it out and squeeze the trigger once... or twice... or six times... (I like my tea sweet!) to sweeten by beverage. If you've ever tried to keep Splenda packets on hand, you know what happens: eventually they get crumpled, and the edges start to tear, and before long you have Splenda in your wallet, your cell phone, your travel-sized hairbrush. ... Even keeping the packets in a plastic baggie doesn't help, because then you just have a plastic baggie full of leaked Splenda, and that's not very appetizing, now, is it?<br /><br />Spare yourself a purse full of Splenda--or, worse, having to use the pink packets in your tea. Buy these Minis. You won't regret it.

Amazing the funny places these get to, and where they stick.<br /><br />I found one of these dispensers in my purse.  It's really old so I decided to use the Splenda up.  I really like just popping a little tab in my coffee, not messing around with the packets.  So convenient.  But I couldn't find any of these in my local stores, so I ordered them from Amazon.<br /><br />My order came quickly, and now I am fixed for Splenda tabs for a while!

review/text: Love this item, it's a great way to keep your preferred sweetener accessible. Some places only stock sugar and Sweet 'n Low. I keep one of these in my purse to combat these issues. They last forever, AND they don't get all beat up and spill inside your purse the way packets do.

review/summary: Splenda Tabs
review/text: We are sooooo glad we found Splenda Tabs at Amazon!  They are in a tiny cute dispenser package of 100 that is easy to use and does not come apart in your purse or pocket like the little paper packets of sweetener do.  Not to add, I certainly can not imagine trying to cart 100 little paper packets around with me!!!<br />The local stores all claimed these were not available but they were on Splenda's website as a regular item!  So I checked Amazon and as usual, Amazon had the item I was looking for!<br />Amazon fulfilled the order so fast, it was amazing!!

review/summary: Certified gluten free as of November 2010
review/text: My name is Annelies and I work for attune foods, the manufacturer of Erewhon Crispy Brown Rice- Gluten Free cereal. Our Erewhon certified gluten free cereals are made in a peanut-free, tree-nut free and dairy-free facility. They are run on a shared line with gluten and we abide by good manufacturing practices to help ensure against cross-contamination. This consists of the machinery being sanitized and thoroughly washed down before the cereal is made. Then after it is made, the cereal is tested to ensure it is less than 20 ppm of gluten. We sent the cereal to a separate facility last fall to double check the levels at which it tested and found it to be less than 5ppm of gluten. In November of 2010, our Erewhon gluten free cereals were certified gluten free by GIG. I hope this helps clarify our current practices as I realize there are reviews dating back many years on amazon.com and thought it would be helpful to update interested consumers of it on amazon.com.

review/summary: Not Gluten Free.
review/text: I've been gluten free for ten years.  I'm o.k. enough that I can slip up a little and only get a little sick:  what that means is that if something isn't entirely gluten free, it will make me sick for hours, not days.  That's made me tolerant of food that isn't entirely gluten free--I'll eat the not-entirely-gluten-free food for a couple of days, and then start having a reaction, not realizing that is what is happening.<br /><br />This is only sort of gluten free.  You might be able to eat it a few times with only a little bit of distress, but then it will get worse.  If you are a celiac on a long-standing gluten free diet, you will slowly get sicker again.<br /><br />And, your risk of getting colon cancer later in life will go up dramatically, which is apparently what happens to celiacs who eat little bits of gluten throughout their lives.  Just because it's not really making you sick, doesn't mean it's not doing damage.<br /><br />Avoid this, and don't feed it to celiac kids.<br /><br />Edit:  On the gluten-free listservs there are discussions of people getting sick from this.  Erewhon has confirmed that they run oat cereals on some of the lines, so if you are a celiac who can't tolerate oats (which I am) this is bad stuff.<br /><br />Also, they make this in a facility that processes wheat, so it may be legally gluten free (20 ppm or less), but not actually gluten-free.  Mixed facilities can have 10 ppm wheat in the air alone.

review/summary: Definitely a "health food" cereal
review/text: This cereal has a healthy, nutty flavor very similar to that of puffed rice, but with more crisp. It is very low in calories, and it's true what the other reviewer mentioned about the low glycemic impact. It is not a sweet cereal by any means. I eat it with vanilla soymilk, and that makes it tasty enough for me. I personally I would not spring it on a child who is new to a gluten-free diet, because they'll likely turn their nose up at it if served as is. I agree with the other reviewer and would recommend the Envirokids line of cereals for GF kids (caution - a couple of them are *not* GF!).

review/text: This is a great tasting cereal, but it is NOT gluten free. It took me months to figure how my family kept getting gluten because I trusted the "family" owned Erewhon brand.  Guess what?  They are no longer family owned. The corporation who makes Skinner Raisin Brand owns them and processes raisin bran in the same plant as the supposedly gluten free Crispy Brown Rice cereal. If avoiding gluten is important to your family's health, then avoid this cereal. It is definitely cross contaminated with gluten.

review/summary: Edible, but not great
review/text: I tried my first bowl tonight after ordering the bulk order from Amazon due to the reviews.  I thought they tasted a bit like a cardboard version of Rice Krispies - they were pretty tasteless.  I ended up adding a bit of sugar to it to make it more palatable.<br /><br />The cereal tastes like it would be decent with fruit, but I would probably add a few extra marshmallows if I were to make rice krispie treats out of it.<br /><br />Overall, I would say that there are other, tastier GF cereals out there -- the Envirokids brand is a pretty good one for instance.  However, if you're looking for something to replace Rice Krispies specifically, this is an okay substitute but by no means perfect.

If you have Celiac's disease and multiple allergies, however, like me, or if you just want a pure and wholesome cereal without a lot of unhealthy additives, this is definitely for you. It is light and crispy, but filling and satisfying. I gave a box to my girlfriend who just found out that she is Celiac, and she thought it was great too. I'm so glad that Erewhon decided to make this cereal. It gives me something to eat for breakfast besides eggs, eggs and more eggs. It make breakfast seem like breakfast again! Caution: the unsalted type is not very tasty at all.

review/summary: Not a substitute for Rice Krispies unfortunately
review/text: I'm a cereal fanatic, but I've got celiac so I have to choose gluten free cereals. I bought this as a substitute for Rice Krispies so that I could make my favorite cookies, which require that type of rice cereal. The pieces in this cereal are a bit bigger than Rice Krispies. I'm not sure if it was the sweetener or the brown rice, but the flavor just did not appeal to me at all. So I didn't even bother trying to make my cookies. I actually threw out most of the box, which I never do, because every time I tried eating it, it just didn't taste good. I tried it with regular milk and almond milk (I thought maybe the almond milk would flavor it better, nope). I did not have any sort of gluten-related reaction to it. I just didn't like it, and neither did my non-celiac husband.

We especially like the fact that it isn't too sweet, and is very low in sugar, but still has a cereal-y taste.  For you sweet-tooths, don't panic - it tastes great with an extra sprinkle or drizzle of something sweet on it.

review/text: This cereal is perfect to use for my husband who has celiac disease. I blend 2 boxes of this cereal to use for breading for fish and chicken or any time I need crumbs for a recipe when I have to substitute gluten free crumbs for wheat bread crumbs. I store the crumbs in an airtight container in the refrigerator. I also make him rice krispie bars as this cereal is safe for people like my husband who is very sensitive to gluten. It is a life saving product for us. We buy it by the case at Amazon.com and save money with the Super Saver program at Amazon.com and it is convenient to have it shipped to our home and less expensive as gluten free and lactose free products are much more expensive in the grocery store. We also purchase Glutino Gluten Free Pretzel Twists family pack 14.1oz., Gluten Free Pantry Old Fashioned Cake and Cookie Mix 15oz. and Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Hearty Whole Grain Bread Mix which we have found to be my husband's favorite products which we also order from Amazon.com using the Super Saver Program mentioned above.

I recently used it as an ingredient in a new granola recipe, and it added welcome crunch and nutrition. I especially like having a gluten-free option for times when I'm not eating wheat in my diet.

review/summary: Erewhon Crispy Brown Rice Cereal, Gluten Free
review/text: FANTASTIC. Although I ordered the wrong product and was supposed to order the cereal with berries, my wife refused to send the product back. She loves the Crispy Brown Rice Cereal and just adds her own fruit. I've corrected my mistake, and Amazon.com was wonderful, understanding and very helpful about my error. These products listed with gluten free, wheat free are less expensive than in local stores and delivered right to our front door in just a few days. My wife is allergic to wheat and we've tried the Ener-G bread, Bob's GF flour, Pamela's mini choc chip cookies and the cereal and my wife LOVES them. I would recommend to anyone who needs gluten free, wheat free products to order thru Amazon.com.  The prices, the quality, the quantity and the free shipping option is great especially for seniors who have trouble getting to the grocery.  Can't say enough about these products.  Amazon.com saves you gas, time AND money and the quality of the food is TOP NOTCH!  It tastes a little different than wheat products that we've all grown up with, but my wifes health is going to be better by using these products. Would recommend gluten free, wheat free products sold on Amazon.com to anyone.  My wife says this product is a 9 1/2 (1/2 off because I didn't order it w/berries). Thanks to all those who help produce these products for so many who need them.

review/summary: Great Price & Taste, especially for GF & Rotation diets
review/text: This is a great gluten-free version of "Rice Krispies". It's very low in sugar, so it's also good for diabetics & hypoglycemics. Since the ingredient list is short, it's good for food rotation diets for those with severe food allergies. It also does the snap, crackle, pop just like the original. If it needs flavor but not added sugar/calories, then add flavored liquid Stevia (comes in chocolate, strawberry, orange creme, etc.) to some plain rice or soy milk before mixing the milk with the cereal. My kids love this cereal. Originally, they added all kinds of flavored Stevia to it, but now they just eat it plain. You CAN get your children to eat less sugar - just reduce it slowly. Resist the premade foods with lots of added sugar or artificial sweeteners instead of sugar. Search for no sugar or sweetener-added products like plain yogurt & applesauce, and add sugar to your liking, then reduce over time (months). Make your own & reduce the sugar and add fruit or seasonings when you can; at least that will add nutrition. Over time, continue to reduce the amount of sugar you add and substitute with some Stevia. Voila! My kids eat much less sugar. In fact, my daughter once complained that my granola was TOO sweet!. (I had added more sugar than normal because it was for her scout troop. I was afraid no one would eat it since it wasn't very sweet to begin with.) Interestingly, the scouts & their adult leaders found it delicious & not overly sweet, which shows that probably everyone is overloaded with sugar. Ok, now back to our review...Amazon has the best price I've seen anywhere. My local stores are charging four dollars a box! If this GF version of rice 'krispies' isn't to your liking, try the Barbara's version. It is a little sweeter and still GF, but not so good for rotation diets because it uses 2-3 fruit juices for sweetening. If these cereals taste like cardboard, that's your sugar addiction/Standard American Diet stomach talking. Don't give in unless you want to die young. You can change your diet; it just takes some work & some time...

review/summary: Delicious!  Much better than R.K.
review/text: The name of this product is not "Celiac's Cereal". It is Crispy Brown Rice Cereal.  The manufacturers have created a delicious cereal for all to eat, no where do they claim that this product is for Celiacs.<br /><br />The ingredients are heads above the rest in its category. #1 it's Organic #2 it's made from brown rice not white rice and #3 there is no high fructose corn syrup as sweetener. Can't say that about Rice Krispies.  Speaking of which, I called Kelloggs to ask where the rice comes from that they use in their cereal. I was told, "we don't know". Oh really?  Makes you wonder what conditions are that the rice is grown in. Clearly they don't care.  That concerned me which is why I started to look for an organic alternative.  I started off buying one box at Whole Foods to see how I liked it.  Very impressed with it's taste, texture, and ingredients I came to Amazon to order it in bulk to save money. I've just placed my second order, this time on the auto delivery plan with even more savings.<br /><br />UPDATE...We've just been told the product is now safe for Celiacs but it comes at a significant increase in price.  I'm on the 2 month auto ship plan.  I've ordered this cereal 9 times.  The last shipment saw a price jump and now I see they've raised it again!  New packaging...25% more. I might as well go back to buying it from WF if I'm not going to get a sufficient discount purchasing in bulk from Amazon.  Time to reaccess whether I should continue with this plan.

review/summary: Really nice, healthier version of Rice Krispies, great for those avoiding gluten (though celiac disease folk may need to beware)
review/text: I bought a box of this at Whole Foods and really liked it. I had it with organic milk, with almond milk, with added cocoa powder, all sorts of ways, and it was just a nice, sounder version of the Rice Krispies I had as a kid. I will note it is GRITTIER than R.K., but that's cause it's simpler (not a long list of ingredients) and uses brown rice. It doesn't stay crispy as long as traditional R.K., so only pour your milk/almond milk/soymilk/etc when you're ready to chow down.<br /><br />For folks avoiding gluten (but not low carb, obviously), this is a nice cereal for when one wants something other than eggs. I find it's really nice with a sprinkle of real cocoa powder (sans sugar).<br /><br />If you have celiac disease, heed the warnings you see here from others. I'm gluten sensitive (not celiac) and I didn't detect any issues after eating this.<br /><br />I will not that the only reason I didn't buy it here, from Amazon, is that 6 boxes is just too much. I have nowhere to store that much cereal, and I don't like cereal getting stale, laying around. I'm the only one in the house who eats this (hubby hates unsweetened cereal), so six boxes is excessive for me. If it were a two pack, yeah, I would have.

So when we found this we were excited and bought it on subscribe and save.  Unfortunately, it does not seem as crispy as the others.  Not sure if we are used to the preservative taste, but it was a bit disappointing.  I admit, I can't blame the cereal if that's the way its supposed to taste without preservatives.... but it also could be because Amazon sent us some old boxes.

review/summary: Erewhon Crispy Brown Rice Cereal (gluten free & organic) purchased at Amazon.com
review/text: Due to food allergies I found Erewhon's Gluten Free Brown Rice Cereal. I have tried other gluten free brands and Erewhon's was the first that actually tasted great! It tastes better than other popular (gluten) cereals that I have had before my allergies were diagnosed.  It does not taste like someone puffed a lot of air in it or like a card board box. A regular serving of Erewhon's Gluten Free Brown Rice Cereal with some sliced fruit or chopped nuts can actually fill you up.<br /><br />Erewhon's Gluten Free Brown Rice Cereal is fresh and flavorful and does not get soggy when rice or almond milk are added (I would imagine it would be the same no matter what type of milk you used). The best part is you don't have to add sugar or anything else to it for it to taste good.<br /><br />Some of the favorite ways I enjoy eating Erewhon's Gluten Free Brown Rice Cereal are:  plain with rice or almond milk, adding sliced fresh fruit, chopped pecans or almonds or just straight out of the box as a snack. With young toddlers and children this is a great healthy snack to serve them that can also assist them with practicing their pincer grip. :-)<br /><br />If you are seeking a healthier and tasty cereal, then Erewhon's Gluten Free Brown Rice Cereal is for you. With only three ingredients: organic brown rice, organic brown rice syrup and sea salt; you can't go wrong. An added plus is the cost.  With today's rising food prices, Erewhon's Gluten Free Brown Rice Cereal is very competitive and in many cases less expensive than the popular cereal brands.  I highly recommend Erewhon's Gluten Free Brown Rice Cereal for you and your family.

review/summary: Gluten Free Cereal
review/text: I love this cereal.  I can only eat grain cereals made from brown rice and this one fits the bill.  I have it most mornings with some fruit on top. It's tasty and nutritious.  I am very happy that I can get it thru Amazon, in bulk and at a better price than in the grocery store.

review/summary: healthy brown rice cereal
review/text: When combined with a little fruit and nuts, it makes for a satisfying breakfast.  The texture is good and it retains "crunch" after adding milk.  If you enjoy cereal but want to reduce the glycemic load, consider this product.

review/summary: Love this cereal
review/text: I am on a yeast cleanse and can't do wheat or gluten.  I love this cereal as a quick meal when I don't have time to cook.  I love it so much that I have reached the maximum allowed purchases on Amazon and now have to go to local grocery store and pay more per box  :((((
