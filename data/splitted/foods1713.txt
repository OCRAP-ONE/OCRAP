review/summary: Sea Salt For Excema
review/text: I brought this salt so I could add it to my son's bath since he has excema and is allergic to several types of grasses. He plays football so rolling around in the grass is inevitable. So far, it seems to be drying up a bit. But I'm still playing with the amounts to add to is bath water. If I feel once I've completed the bag it helped, then I will bump up the ratings. I had no problem with the way the product was shipped or the timeliness of it's arrival.

review/summary: A Strong Aftertaste
review/text: This salt has the most oomph of any of the sea salts I have tried so far.  When I first tried this salt that mineral oomph threw me off;  I was actually thinking about giving this salt away.  Now I appreciate the aftertaste kick I get from it.  As has been suggested in other reviews here on Amazon and around the internet, I would recommend this salt on heartier, blander foods (potatoes, cabbage, stews, etc.) that need a little kick.  They say you won't be able to taste a finishing salt in a baked dish or a liquid based dish, but if one salt can pull either of those feats off it is this salt.

review/summary: NOT FOR GRINDERS
review/text: Do not buy this salt if you're planning on putting it in a grinder. I wish I had listened to other reviews.  This salt is wet, wet, wet.  It gummed up my grinder and would not go through it at all.  I don't know if the grinder will ever work again or if I'll be able to get this mush out of it.<br /><br />This is not rock salt.  It is a slightly coarse ground, wet mess.  It would be suitable for snail prevention or other such tasks.  The flavor is above average, but it is simply not useable for grinders or cooking.

review/summary: Better than regular salt but expensive
review/text: This is one spice that I never pursued in big way until now. The one thing to note is that the sale is slightly damp. I bought on the internet and it works great, but have heard about other grinders not working so well due to the moisture. All in all, I highly recommend this. My first venture into a higher grade salt, and I'm happy. I bought this and a salt grinder and there is a significant difference in the flavor of the salt and foods that you mix it with.  I think the price is a little too high but that is my only real issue other than the moisture.

review/summary: pretty wet to use in a salt grinder
review/text: I must have missed it in the description but this salt is very wet.  I wanted to use this in a table salt/pepper grinder.  My grinder came with coarse DRY salt.  I guess I'll keep looking for another salt.<br /><br />---  updated July 23, 2012 ---<br /><br />Ok, just read that a ceramic salt mill would handle wet salt (I didn't say moist as in moisture but really wet salt).  I ordered one by Kyocera (under $17) and will update when I get it.  For a month now, this salt has been sitting way back in my pantry - or cabinet - or not sure where it is (hint hint).  Anyway, will have to find it when I get the new mill.<br /><br />--------------------------

review/summary: Tasty, but Damp
review/text: I was surprised to discover that the salt is packaged while damp. I don't know what accounts for the dampness, but it causes the salt crystals to be a bit sticky, which hinders the electric salt grinder that I'm using. I have not had this problem with other brands of salt. Anyway, I was going to return it, but instead chose to spread the salt on some wax paper on a cookie tray and let in bake in the oven for 1/2 hour, which removed the moisture and now it seems fine! One really shouldn't have to do that, right? Anyway, I won't be ordering this product again because of the dampness, but this may not be a problem for others and I must say that the salt does taste great.

Directions are in such small print even with a magnifying glass I could not make them out. The flavor was not very hot as I had expected from a red curry so I am a bit dissapointed. I used a lot and mixed with vegetable oil as it says but still not very strong flavor. I also do not see any storage instructions on the package and since you only use a small amount at a time I am going to try freesing the remaining amount in small cubes for later  use.

review/summary: Why is this tea not famous and widely available?
review/text: You used to be able to find Stash Licorice at major grocery stores, and I'm baffled as to why it has disappeared from shelves and can only be found online. It's the only herbal tea I've found that is naturally sweet so you don't have to add sugar or sweeteners. The aroma is heavenly and as an added bonus, it acts as an appetite suppressant (at least for me) because when you're inhaling that scent your palate doesn't crave anything else. Great as an after-dinner/before-bed drink.

review/summary: Licorice lovers and health nuts, this is for you!
review/text: If you love black licorice and and would like something that also has great health benefits, you'll love this tea.  I brew this tea and drink hot, but even when it gets cold, its still great.  I often just add more cold water to it and get a very mild licorice taste that is better than just strait water.  I will do this several times until I just want more of the licorice taste, and brew some more tea.  As to the health benefits, there are many.  Here are just a few: "useful for many ailments including asthma, body odor, bursitis, canker sores, chronic fatigue, depression, colds and flu, coughs, gingivitis and tooth decay, gout, heartburn, HIV, viral infections, fungal infections, ulcers, liver problems, Lyme disease, menopause, psoriasis, shingles, sore throat, tendinitis, tuberculosis, ulcers, yeast infections, prostate enlargement and arthritis."  See [...] and click on the link licorice.  That is where this health info came from, but there is much much more info there on that web site too.  It's said to be very good for flu and colds, which I'm fighting now, and it's so very SOOTHING to my throat!  You'll love this tea.

review/text: I tried this tea in a sampler pack and became totally addicted!  I moved and could not find any stores that carry the flavor so I have to buy online.<br /><br />It is a very sweet and strong tea that requires no sugar or milk.  I guess it tastes like black licorice, but I never eat it so I'm not sure.

review/summary: A loyal drinker (!) for years
review/text: Simply stated, I've been drinking this specific tea for several years now after an experiment went (happily) well.  Some friends have found it to be too sweet, but they needed to be corrected in that no sugar is required (because they inadvertently added some).  The tea provides more than enough natural sweetness of its own with no aftertaste (albeit a pleasant one, if it turns out that you're a little ill and therefore a trifle phlegmy... there, I said it).<br /><br />It mixes exceptionally well with green tea, though I've found not so much with certain black teas like Irish Breakfast -in which case I'd recommend avoid adding milk if you're normally inclined to do so with any kind of black tea.  It is decaffeinated, so this is a perfect "unwinding" drink before bedtime.  Not "spicy" in the classic sense at all, either.  I thoroughly and highly recommend this variety of Stash tea.

It tastes almost as good as homemade lemon/ginger tea from fresh ingredients.<br /><br />It really is good.  Not a mild flavored tea at all, but that is why I like it.  It really is very, very flavorful.<br /><br />It has a nice blend of both flavors.

review/summary: Delicious, sweet tasting tea, but...
review/text: I love the taste of this tea. It tastes exactly like licorice root and it's very refreshing. I like to make iced tea with it. However, I just read a review someone made on another licorice tea product on amazon, telling their story of licorice toxicity. I'm a fairly paranoid person, so I'm now only going to enjoy this tea about twice a week, instead of everyday like I was doing. I canceled my subscribe & save order because I don't think I can safely use up 6 boxes within the time I selected. I might be overreacting, I probably am, but better safe than sorry.

review/summary: Amazing tea!!
review/text: I will be honest and say that when a friend suggested I try this tea as I began getting sick last winter, I told her no way because I do not like licorice flavor.  She still made me a cup and I was stunned.  This is the best tea EVER!  I stopped drinking coffee during the winter and drank this tea all day long.  The students in my class noticed my new love of this tea and bought me a package as a gift.  The flavor is fabulous and I really like the fact that I do not need to add any sweetener at all.  The aftertaste is so interesting.  I have never had anything like it.<br /><br />I prepared this as a cold tea this summer, but it just didn't taste the same.  I will stick with it as a hot tea only.  Did I mention that I love it?

This is also a really good deal considering that if you buy 80 tea bags from the company's website it would cost 13.95 (not including shipping and handling which costs ~$8) and buying from amazon you get 108 tea bags with cheaper shipping.

review/summary: Love this when I'm sick
review/text: This tea is super gingery, and lemony, and I just love it with honey when I'm sick. Love it. My local grocery is out, so here I am on Amazon, buying more.<br /><br />Note that the primary source of "lemon" appears to be lemongrass. (Ingredients, via the product packaging: "Ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, and citric acid. Contains: Soy." I don't understand "Contains: Soy", but it's not listed on the ingredients... I wonder if this is an allergy alert thing.)<br /><br />Looking at the ingredients, the organic version has caffeine and doesn't have any actual lemon in it... I haven't tried that one yet, though. I'm a fan of both green tea and organic products, but I don't want caffeine when I'm sick, so I'll stick with this.

review/text: A friend introduced me to Licorice Tea many years ago by asking for a cup at a restuarant. When the server stated that the restuarant did not have Licorice tea, she took a packette out of her handbag and asked for a cup of hot water. She had an extra packette for me to try. WOW, interesting taste, not bitter and no need for sweetner. Stash makes the most robust decafinated tea. Until a short while ago, I was able to puchase the 20 count box of Stash Premium Licorice Spice Herbal Tea at the local grocery, but Licorice Spice is no longer on the shelf. I placed my order for the Pack of 6 to save on shipping and should now have sufficient tea bags for several months. Individually, foil wrapped tea bags keeps the flavor fresh.

review/text: If you aren't familiar with the taste, I can only suggest you try it before you end up with 6 boxes of the stuff.  But if you are a committed lover of this tea, then Amazon's Subscribe and Save is REALLY a great deal!  Definitely not for people who do not like the taste of black licorice.  I personally steep the tea for longer than advised on the package but I like my teas strong (package says 3-5 minutes, I go for 10).  I have turned some of my licorice loving friends onto it - 1 is a diabetic and she LOVES it since it gives a really sweet flavor with NO sugar or carbohydrates.  It is wonderful on a cold evening and won't keep you awake as there is NO caffeine.

I did not realize (as the packaging box states) that herbal teas contain no true tea leaves, but are created from an international collection of herbs and spices such as licorice, cinnamon, orange peel, star anise and sarsaparilla. It is a perfect after dinner tea. I live in Michigan and those wintery nights are good for a cup of this caffeine free tea.

review/summary: I like this tea!
review/text: Well, what's to be said other than I really like this Licorice Spice Tea?<br /><br />I cut out sugar and reduced my caffeine intake over the last year or so and this licorice tea is my favorite replacement for a caffeinated hot drink. Because I have a sweet tooth I usually now drink tea and coffee with soy milk to reduce the bitterness. This licorice spice tea is delicious and I drink it equally happily both with and without soy milk (the licorice gives it a natural sweet flavor). I have at least one or two cups a day, and even if I was to return to my previous high regime of caffeination I would still include a cup or two of this tea during the day.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of chamomile and this Licorice spice tea does not seem to list that as an ingredient.<br /><br />It seems many people don't like the flavor of licorice, but those that do really like this tea.<br /><br />I've found that the flavor of each batch seems to vary in intensity and the last batch I bought had a less strong taste which simply means it needs to be steeped a little longer.<br /><br />Scratching around for other things to say, my only concern about Stash teas is what appears to be plastic coated aluminum sashes that the teabags are sealed in. That does a great job in terms of sealing in flavor, but I'd rather it wasn't either plastic or aluminum coated. Maybe there's no good alternative.<br /><br />The only other thing is that the latest boxes have changed the design of the semi-circular hole at the bottom of the box and the new design makes it near impossible to easily remove a sachet. You'll be attacking it with the scissors or opening the box lid to get them out.<br /><br />But what really matters is the flavor and this is simply the best!

review/text: I've been "addicted" to this tea for years and glad that it has become more widely available.<br /><br />A few weeks ago my cousin and I were discussing our love of tea.  I put forth Licorice Spice as my favorite and she said her all time favorite was, surprisingly enough, a tea made by Aveda - the haircare company - called Comforting Tea.  She lamented that she found it hard to find and described the taste to me.  I immediately told her that she had to try Licorice Spice then.  A few days after my recommendation she emailed me that she had tried the Stash tea and it was EVEN BETTER than the Aveda one!  I so do love making converts!<br /><br />As an added bonus, I've discovered after many nights of letting the tea steep, forgetting about the cup I've made, but not wanting to waste the tea bag - it tastes really good cold too!

review/summary: Weak, as usual for this brand
review/text: I bought this recently, not paying attention to brand.  When I got it home, I realized it was Stash, and thought, oh, no, here comes the weak tea!<br /><br />Indeed, as with other of their teas, it is weak.  I used up almost the entire box of tea bags to make a pitcher full of iced tea, and it was still pretty weak in flavor.  When I've made hot tea with it, I need two tea bags.<br /><br />The flavor is ok--I love the tartness of hibiscus and the raspberry--but it's really just too weak overall.  Will not purchase again.

review/summary: SOY??? WHY?
review/text: Maybe I didn't read the ingredient list thoroughly, because I was not expecting to find SOY in my tea!! What a disappointment! I called Stash to find out if the soy was GMO, and...the woman in customer service guarenteed me the suppliers sell them non-GMO soy. If this is the case, they really should label it as such. I like the flavor though, it's very soothing and gentle on the tummy (hence the three stars). The only way I will order again is if they start labeling the soy as non-GMO, i can't trust the product without a label!<br /><br />PS: after reading ingredient list again, I found NO mention of soy...

review/summary: Try this for Sore Throat or to Wind Down!!!
review/text: First of all, I am a tea drinker.  I have been drinking tea all my 60 years of life and I LOVE tea.  Stash is a wonderful tea and they have a tremendous line of delicious flavors out there right now. Stash chamomile is caffeine free.<br /><br />Now, let me share one of Kathy W's secrets with you. (S-h-h-h-h-h...) Chamomile tea is EXCELLENT for sore throats, scratchy throats, any throat irritation.  I first learned about Chamomile tea from my Greek neighbors. YaYa and PaPu always gave the grandchildren Chamomile tea whenever they got sick.  It not only is very soothing but it somehow soothes throat irritations.  Over the years, I have found that if I get a sore throat, I drink 2 cups of chamomile tea, one behind the other, and my throat STOPS hurting.  If it starts again the next day, I repeat the procedure, and it stops again.<br /><br />I rarely get sick now-a-days, and if I get a bug, it passes through and out real quick, but I have turned many a friend and co-worker on to my little secret.  It works!  Chamomile brews/steeps as a yellow tea and it has a different taste than black tea.  So, if the taste is strange to you initially, you will probably get used to it quickly.  I assure you, it beats the heck out of having a sore throat.  For a sore throat, you can also add honey if you want.  Honey makes it even more smooth and soothing.<br /><br />Some people also like a cup of chamomile tea before bedtime because it is soothing and helps them wind down.<br /><br />So, when you use this for a sore throat, and you realize it helped you or your children, do me a favor.  Look up to heaven and say Thank You to YaYa and PaPu Harjandrou for sharing this special secret with all of us.<br /><br />God Bless you all.<br /><br />(Note: I am not a doctor.)

review/text: I am dissapointed!! When I bought this product I thought I was buying the real Acai Tea. But when I read ingredients it occured that Acai is the only one of the ingredients from a lot of others. So I blamed myself because I had to read those ingredients before I bought this Tea. I was fooled because the tea is named as "Acai Tea" so I thought it really was Acai. I reccomend everybody to read ingredients carefully before buying the product.

review/summary: Licorice Lovers--You must check this out!
review/text: Those of you who love licorice or anise flavor and who happen to be tea-drinkers, rejoice! This tea is so flavorful and aromatic. The anise/licorice flavor is intense. The tea is relatively sweet, so in my opinion, the addition of sweetener is not necessary, but you may want to add a little honey to it. This is not a wimpy tea, but full bodied and the longer you steep it, the stronger it gets.

review/text: I first tried this tea 4 years ago when a friend introduced it to me at work.  I was able to buy it at Trader Joes but they discontinued stocking it in my local store about a year ago.  I then found this online directly from Stash and bought boxes at a time.  I am a person who finds it hard to drink water but this herb tea helps me drink up to 10 huge mugs of it a day. Lemon and ginger combination is perfect to satisfy the need for sweet with a little bite at the end with the ginger. It has also helped me stop drinking caffeine drinks which lets me now sleep at night.  I will continue to buy this and recommend it highly.

review/summary: Tried it...loved it...now my favorite herbal tea
review/text: Based on the other review, I went and tried this tea.  As a choir member, I am always interested in licorice products since they soothe a worn voice.  However, many of the teas I have tried have too much ginger in it.  I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this tea.<br /><br />1) The licorice taste is subtle, but definitely present.<br /><br />2) No sugar necessary.  As a dentist, I love this.  The licorice flavor doesn't jump out at you at first, but around 4 or 5 seconds after swallowing, the licorice "dances" around the sides of your tongue.  I don't know how else to describe it, but it really does dance.  I've never had that before.  Brilliant!<br /><br />3) It's best when over-steeped - like 10 minutes.<br /><br />4) Most grocery stores I've been to carry this, so it's readily available should you find yourself staring at an empty box early in the evening.

review/summary: Basic Lemon Ginger Herbal Tea
review/text: ***<br />Stash's Lemon Ginger Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is a basic lemon ginger tea, tasting strongly of ginger, and full of flavorings, and oddly, even contains soy. This is one of the better commercial highly processed, non-organic teas. I much prefer organic teas that are made without artificial flavorings and certainly without soy, but if you are not picky about herb teas, and are looking something very strongly flavored as an introduction to the world of teasans and decaffeinated beverages, this would be fine. If you like your tea more subtle, with true pure tastes, and can discern complex differences between natural and commercial teas, then this definitely is not for you, and I would recommend any Numi tea, Yogi Tea, Traditional Medicinals, or even Stash's organic line of teas (which comes in a wonderful Lemon Ginger Organic Tea!)<br /><br />Stash Lemon Ginger Tea contains ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, citric acid, and soy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, nothing special.<br />***

review/text: There are several other Stash teas that I've tried and enjoyed. But this one is sort of feeble-tasting.  Up until now, I've gotten the Yogi Tea Egyptian Licorice <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F3QL6">Yogi Tea Organic Egyptian Licorice, Tea Bags, 16-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>and that one actually has a bold licorice taste.  And it is that one that is serving as the point of comparison to this Stash tea.  Keep in mind that I don't add honey or any sweetner to my teas, so they have to stand on their own.  This Stash Licorice Spice has a weak licorice taste and a weak spice taste.  I have to use TWO teabags at a time (which makes the seemingly low price not so much a good deal).

review/summary: Subtle, Mild Chamomile Tea
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers. Although I do like this, it means that the tea is rather weak, but still a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little mild and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker!<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for over 35 years, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****
