review/summary: So Good, My Family Can't Tell the Difference!
review/text: I love this pasta! It opens up a whole new range of food ideas while on a low carb diet...Macaroni salad, spaghetti, pasta salad, Tuna noodle, Mac n cheese, etc...It's so good, that my family has no idea that it's a low carb pasta.<br /><br />I'm able to get them at the grocery store for less than $4 a box.

review/summary: Great low carb pasta but costs too much
review/text: This is a great-tasting, easy to make, low carb pasta. If it's true that there are only 5 grams net carbs, then this is a dream come true for me. I love a good, home-made pasta dish but I avoid them because of the high carb content. With this pasta, I made a couple of my favorites and enjoyed them without feeling guilty. My only complaint, as with all low carb products, is the high price. That's why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5. So unfortunately, I can only buy this once in a while. I'm glad I found this though because I know I can have a really good pasta dish every now and then.

review/summary: Great Lo Carb Pasta
review/text: I don't know about diabetic use but this pasta works great for a low carb weight loss diet, like Atkins or South Beach. Cook to direction on package or a little under and this pasta tastes great and really works to mitigate carb intake. We have found the Rao's sauces to be a good prepared compliment to this pasta, as they have far fewer carbs than the average sauce. Also don't re-heat any leftovers because the acids in sauce and the added heat will diminish or negate the carb buffeting effect. Highly recommended along with Julian Bakeries low carb bread - a meal of spaghetti with red sauce and garlic bread for under 10 grams of carbs is possible!

review/summary: nice pot
review/text: I bought this pot for a wisteria bonsai plant.  The pot is smaller than the picture looks but is the size of the measurements that are listed.  I think the picture of the pot looks bigger than it is and I should have read it more carefully.  The pot is pretty, it is level and appears to be a nice thickness.  I am starting the wisteria bonsai from a seed, so this pot will still be ok for that and depending how quickly the plant grows will determine how long I may be able to use it.

review/summary: Good and simple list of ingredients!
review/text: For what it's worth - the Better Than Bouillon Organic Mushroom Base has different ingredients as compared with the non-organic version. I found this item for about $6.50 at our small local health food store in Brunswick, Maine. The ingredients are: Mushrooms, salt, cane sugar, maltodextrin, natural flavors, dried onion, soybean oil, dried garlic and natural butter flavor. I haven't tried it yet, but I will give you an update after I use it and amend the star rating as needed.  Each jar has 38 servings and makes 9.5 quarts of broth.  A 1 tsp. serving has 630 mg of sodium and just 10 calories.

review/summary: No dog can resist!
review/text: I was first introduced to Benny Bully's Liver Chops at a veterinary exhibit hall. The company was giving out free samples, and when I told them I had a picky "treat-snob" dog, they handed me a pack of liver chop treats. Well, the company was correct - my dog couldn't resist these liver treats.<br /><br />What I like about this product: it's made in the USA, has no additives, fillers, coloring, or preservatives, and they are extremely palatable. The ingredients are simple to understand - just one: Pure beef liver.<br /><br />These treats are perfect for puppy obedience training for that dog who isn't food motivated - even he (or she) will sit for these!

review/summary: limited ingredients?
review/text: These dog cookies were suppose to have limited ingredients for dogs with food allergies. Problem was they did not list all of the ingredients and these stupid cookies ended up having copious amounts of hickory smoke flavoring!!  My Papillon gets sick on smoke flavoring and many of the additives that do not need to be in dog treats or food. The smell of smoke flavoring  was so strong how could they leave it off the ingredient list and why do they even need to add it if there is actual duck in the cookie. What dog in his right mind would choose smoke flavoring over duck flavoring. Money down the drain and damn aggravating that Amazon product descriptions can not be trusted.

review/summary: Duck and potato dog treats
review/text: My dog was put on a hypoallergenic (duck and potato) dog food last month by the vet - allergy testing is under way to find out why my baby is itching and his hair is falling out - so I've had to hide his chicken/sweet potato treats and other than duck jerky which was made in China, these were the only dog treats I could find and which I'm willing to give him - he's adjusted to these new treats (nice and crunchy) but once he gets the three he's allowed after his morning walk, he doesn't come back and bark at me to get more - so OK but doesn't rock his boat!  Hopefully we'll get the results of his allergy tests soon and I can add more foods back to his diet.

review/summary: Diverse Collection of Enjoyable & Delicious Teas
review/text: *****<br />Numi's Collection Assortment Melange includes:<br />5 Herbal Teas (caffeine-free, also called "teasans"):<br />* Dry Desert Lime: Lime Herbal Teasan<br />* Fields of Gold: Lemongrass Herbal Teasan<br />* Red Mellow Bush: Rooibos Herbal Teasan<br />* Bushmen's Brew: Honeybush Herbal Teasan<br />* Simply Mint: Moroccan Mint<br /><br />2 Green Teas (lower in caffeine):<br />* Temple of Heaven: Gunpowder Green Tea<br />* Monkey King: Jasmine Green Tea<br /><br />2 Black Teas (contain caffeine):<br />* Chinese Breakfast: Yunnan Black Tea<br />* Smoky Tarry: Lapsang Souchong Black Tea<br /><br />This is a total of nine different teas, two tea bags of each one in each box. Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest."<br /><br />If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

So it probably tastes as good to others as it does to me.<br /><br />I haven't seen another chili powder without salt.  And I haven't run across this one locally.  Since you have to order online, it isn't an imposition to have to get 24 packs and just stock up if you are a chili fancier.

The brands from left to right are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028HN5A">Sojos Certified Organic Catnip</a>, in the middle is the product in this listing - Cosmic Catnip (this video review shows the 3oz jar), and on the far right we have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VNEII0">Frontier Catnip Leaf & Flower C/s Certified Organic, 16 Ounce Bag</a>.<br /><br />Like the little bear at Goldilock's table, Tristan tries a bit from each plate; at the end of this clip he seemed to have no *overwhelming* preference for any particular brand though. As far as his physical reactions to each (sampled separately), he did not act "stoned" nor hyper, he merely scratches on his scratch pad a bit more with catnip than without catnip and gives himself a good stretch. He also strongly prefers catnip infused mice to non-catnip mice and I'm happy to oblige.<br /><br />As as far which *I* prefer, if it's all the same to the cat (and it seems that it is) here's my take on things -<br /><br />The Frontier brand is by far the least expensive at just under fifteen dollars for 16oz. It is slightly more coarse and seems to have a little bit of stems mixed in. VERY fragrant though and turned out to be a close second favorite of the cat reviewing the products. I would definitely buy the Frontier brand again and use it for stuffing toys generously or for "marinating" his little cloth mice. Organic and suitable even for human consumption if you like it as a tea.<br /><br />The Sojos brand (1oz can) is the most expensive - by my calculations comes to over a hundred dollars for 16oz!. The description says it produces a "harmless, euphoric state" but we saw no evidence of that. Smelled fresh but definitely a milder aroma than the other two brands; had the finest chopped leaves of the three. Hand harvested if that is important you or your cat.<br /><br />With the Cosmic Cat brand, we *may* have a winner.....<br /><br />When the camera was off, Tristan returned to the Cosmic Cat sample several times more so than the other brands. I repeated this little taste test for the next two days and Cosmic Cat had a small but definite edge over the competition. I'd have to say that I agree with his choice; the Cosmic Cat brand leaves are darker and more fragrant than the other two brands. The leaves are also cut just right - not too fine/not too large, and no stems or coarse pieces. I find the Cosmic Cat brand's price reasonable, the storage container is very convenient, and the 3oz* size is enough not to be too little and not so much to get stale and spoil.<br /><br />Hope you find this information useful in choosing for your own cat or kitten.

review/summary: Great catnip!
review/text: This is the only catnip our cat will have anything to do with and she LOVES Cosmic Catnip.  It's been a little difficult to find in the stores here but Amazon always has it for sale online.  The packing was great and shipped very quickly.  I would recommend this to everyone who has a cat.

review/text: My cats have gotten so used to this Cosmic Catnip that they won't be impressed by any other!  People have given me other catnip and they basically turn up their noses at it after using Cosmic Catnip.  This stuff is the BEST!!  If you keep it tightly closed, it lasts a very long time.  My cats are the best judges and they LOVE it!!!  Even my friendly strays outside love it!!  That's got to say something!

review/summary: No lady bugs
review/text: My cats will only get their buzz from Cosmic, even cat toys stuffed with catnip doesnt work with them. But I was becoming concerned when the last container I purchased thru Amazon had 2 ladybugs (dried and preserved) floating amidst the catnip. I have nothing against lady bugs, the idea of quality control concerned me. So I'm keeping an eye on this large container and hoping it was just a fluke last time.

review/text: Whenever I open the cabinet w/ the catnip in it, my cat runs toward me like a bullet eager for her herbs.  I usually just buy it from the market - no fancy brand.  However, when I put Cosmic Catnip in her bowl, she came running as she usually does, but turned her nose at it and this was three days ago.  It is still sitting in her bowl untouched.  The store brand of catnip is gone in SECONDS. Clearly, Cosmic Catnip is not a favorite w/ my Peesh.

review/summary: This is very fragrant, and loved by my kitties
review/text: I'm a cat lover, and spoil them very often. Recently we tried several local stores for catnip and none were very fragrant or very loved by my cats. The older Cosmic Catnip size was no longer for sale, and had lasted a while. After about a year of trying to get decent catnip locally, I came back to Amazon. Read the reviews, and came back to Cosmic catnip (now in a slightly larger size container).<br /><br />This stuff is great, my cats respond to it well, and they love it. The biggest problem is they have really been using the cat scratcher we put the catnip on much more than usual and have had to order a refill kit.<br /><br />If you want very good catnip at a very reasonable price, this may be a good choice.

review/summary: The cats prefer Kong but this will do
review/text: I have gone through several <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018N1DRW">KONG Naturals Premium Catnip, 2-Ounce</a> jars.  Looking for a bit more value, I decided to try Cosmic Catnip.  I don't typically like to change a good thing but went with it. I have house cats and also care for some free-roaming cats. Both populations react favorably to the product. For the house cats, I sprinkle some in their cat beds and on their toys and they roll around, sometimes head over heels. It is quite amusing to watch. However, I think the cats are more interested in the Kong product; they seem to spend greater periods of time playing with it and sniffing it.  In my house, that means more exercise and that is something I like to promote.<br /><br />Cosmic's catnip is packaged in a #3 plastic container, which is not as easily recyclable as a #1 or #2 plastic in most areas. The product's packaging also indicates that it is grown in North America, so that may mean outside of the United States. (For the record, Kong's catnip comes in a #1 PETE container that is easily recyclable and its catnip is also grown in North America).<br /><br />Would I purchase it again?  My cats like it but there is no reason to use a container that is only sometimes recyclable for catnip.  Additionally, my cats liked the Kong product a bit more.  I will likely stick with that when it is time to repurchase.

review/summary: Great nip
review/text: Every year I buy a container of Cosmic Catnip to make a few "tube-sock" type toys with for my cats (currently 8 and 9 years- Female and male respectively) for Christmas. Even with the toy downstairs and wrapped in some thick wrapping paper, the cats go directly to their toy and try to claw off the paper to start playing with it. The toy entices them for about a week, which afterwards the smell of the catnip starts to vanish. If I accidently leave the lid of the container off, I'll find the jar tipped over and two kitties eating up the leaves and rolling their faces in it.<br /><br />The only down side of this nip, being sold in such bulk and so pure, is it has "stem-like" pieces in the container, which can poke through fabric when making toys for the cats. I try to pull out all the stems before filling the toys up with the nip or letting the cats nibble on the product raw. The cats don't seem to mind, however, and there have never been any incidents where the stem gets stuck in their mouth (you know, like when we eat popcorn and the kernel always gets jammed in our mouths).<br /><br />Bottom line: Some powerful nip, the most potent of any nip I've ever bought and will continue to buy it every year.

review/summary: Not The Same as Store bought??
review/text: Not sure if this was AUTHENTIC Cosmic Catnip, as it had a lot more larger bits of stems and coarse material. My cats had loved this stuff when I had gotten a small sample from a local pet store. So, I thought it would be a great idea to get this larger size, but the catnip was not the same. My cats barely like this stuff and it even hurts my fingers when I pinch it to release the aroma. Would not recommend this 3 oz size!

review/text: Only reason I give it 4 stars is because someone was right, there are ALOT of hard stems/sticks in this product but maybe I just have been buying catnip without stems in it for a while.  Maybe this means it is fresh and all natural too.  I saw lots of buds which was good.  I removed as many sticks/stems as I could and gave it to my cats.  They seemed to really like it alot.  They didn't go crazy nutty cuckoo but who knows, maybe tomorrow they will!  I bought it mainly for their digestion and it seemed to calm them and relax them which I liked.  I noticed a little bit later one of them was up on the table trying to get in the jar which I thought was cute.  They give it eight paws up!  (because there are two of them, four paws each).

review/text: I have been looking for this brand of kitty nip for over 10yrs. I bought this brand long time ago & my kitties were in heaven. This is a safe product for your pet, I trust it completely. I give it a rating of 100+. My pet is picky & when the package showed up & I opened the box, put the jar on the floor my kitty was all over the jar trying to open it up, it was hilarious. He new it was his. If you wanted to buy just a 1/2oz 10yrs ago you paid $10.00 for it. When I saw the price of this 4oz jar I was flabbergasted, I just had to snap it up in a heartbeat while I could still could find this brand. It is very hard to find it in the stores now days (go figure something that's good for the pet)I'm the cats-meow in my pets eye now! It's like a kitty Valium in green form,lol. So look no farther you have found the BEST & SAFEST product for your pet right here and the price is out of this world (inexpensive). Believe me the other catnip on the market today is bunk junk & will cause health problems for your pet, Cosmic Catnip will not cause health problems, I know because the other stuff almost killed my pet.<br />http://www.amazon.com/B005CGUUJS <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CGUUJS">Cosmic Catnip Jar, 4-Ounce</a>

review/text: This is an excellent version of the Rock and Rye soda product but I think it may have become sweeter over the years with more sugars added than I recall (or perhaps my taste buds have changed).  In any case, if you like rock and rye, this is a very good product.

review/text: I purchased this from Hometown Fvorites and all I can say is WOW. If you love coconut, this is the way to go... Along with the white coconut icing you're in for a real treat. For some reason, they don't sell it anywhere locally, so I'm forced to mail order, but yum.<br /><br />I kind of wish they sold it in quantities of 6, since I'm not likely to make more than that in one year... But its still great... Light and fluffy. A real treat.

review/text: I purchased the first box at a store on sale after Christmas.  I don't usually like mixes but I made cupcakes and frosted them with home-made buttercream frosting and garnished them with shredded coconut.  Delicious. The coconut flavor in the mix is very faint which I liked as my fear was that it might be overpowering and "fake".

review/summary: They will disappoint you!!!
review/text: Ordered the 6 coconut cake mixes on February 17, 2010 and order was in stock and confirmed by them.  I was told the order would arrive between February 23rd and 26th.  Did not arrive on 26th, but was told it shipped.  Due to snow storm gave them the benefit of the doublt.  Emailed on Saturday the 27th letting them know I had not recieved the coconut cake mixes.  I expected a responce confirming that due to weather it was delay and should/would arrive on Monday March 1st.  Needless to day on March 1st when I arrived home no package.<br /><br />I checked my email only to find a message saying "Thank you for your query and I apologize for the delay. We won't be getting a new shipment in for that item until the middle of March. How would you like us to handle your order?"  This after confriming it was in stock when order was placed and again after confirming receipt of order on the 17th and giving me the arrival date of February 23-26th!!!<br /><br />Rather unprofessional wouldn't you say not to mention unreliable?  How disappointing as this was for a wedding cake for a friend.  Had I known on the 17th they didn't have the mixes in stock I would have searched for other vendors or tested my own "from scratch" cake  Now I won't have the flavor for the weeking cake for March 6th nor will I have time to search for a recipe.  So sad.<br /><br />So beware if you need somethingin a timely manner from this vendor as they are not reliable!!! Shame on them!!!

Making a cake from scratch is a bother, but, as with most things in life, there are no shortcuts and if it's worth doing it's worth doing it well.

They are being delivered today, it didn't take long to get them shipped out to me which made me a happy camper, and this is the highlight of my month since I started school! Totally recommend since they are less fatty and better for kids since they're baked.

review/summary: Doesn't last long for agressive chewers
review/text: I don't like all the controversy surrounding rawhide bones and don't want take the risk of my Lab getting a blockage so I exclusively give him Booda bones which are safe. My lab is an aggressive chewer and considering this is edible it makes him that much more excited as he LOVES food. He enjoys these bones but devours them in less than 20 minutes. I usually give it to him for a few minutes until he eats half of it and then I take it away to save for next time. This obviously would get very expensive so he has his non-edible Nylabones most of the time and these are special treats.

review/summary: Goodbye Rawhides! Hello Peace of Mind - & Dogs Love 'em!
review/text: Love these! Well, because...we have 3 dogs (2 were unplanned children ;-) & our 60-LB German Shepherd AND our 40-LB we-have-no-clue-what-she-is dog have both choked on various shapes & sizes of rawhides. The Shepherd choked so badly that, this time, it wouldn't come up. She couldn't cough & started to literally choke to death. I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do - the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway? Well, I tried anyway and thank God it finally did dislodge & we got it out! Was it the Heimlich? I don't know. Probably not. I mean, she still won't tell me... After all, I guess it was very traumatic for her.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, what I do know, is that was the last time any of my dogs have had any kind of regular rawhide bones! Which, I really wanted to let everyone know of my personal experiences; I believe anybody who is at all concerned about giving their dogs rawhides and/or experiencing a similar problem is on the right track to avoid them.<br /><br />Our small part Chihuawa/part something else, first 2 times in-a-row, threw up repeatedly w/rawhide pieces and w/foam. He was VERY sick the 3rd time, so we definitely stopped that! The ONLY kind I did finally take a chance with were granulated rawhide munchy sticks, & they're all fine w/these; though I'm still nervous about them choking on a piece, but neither of them have had any problems with Boodas so far, & they don't swell up in their throats like regular rawhides.<br /><br />So, now... It's Booda Bones!<br /><br />Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially for my 2 larger aggressive chewers. I agree with some other reviewers that they are not very long-lasting. But it's all I'll give them now. But, for my half Chihuahua/half something else(20lbs), I give him the smallest ones and they are like mega-saurus bones for him(it is my hope that the manufacturer will start selling these in bulk packages, for less $). I get 3 different sizes for my 3 different whatever-they-are-dogs. They absolutely love them! This includes the assorted flavors, the bacon-flavored, and the yogurt-flavored. Whichever is cheaper at the time and shipped by Amazon.<br /><br />And I owe a big thank you to Brian Amazon, all of you for all of your reviews, Booda Bones, and Amazon!<br /><br />** Confession: This was originally a comment I posted to a reviewer by the name of "Brian Amazon" a long time ago. I have been buying Bones from Amazon, and, only Booda Bones, ever since. They are so great that I've been wanting to write a review, & now finally have the chance to (I have, however, resorted to copying and pasting much of my original [brief... LOL] comment, with some editing).

review/summary: More of a treat then something to keep your dog busy.
review/text: Let me start by saying our dogs love these. As soon as they see the bag they stop whatever they're doing and run to their crates (where we typically give these to them). However, for our dogs these are definitely more of a treat then an activity. I have one dog who is an aggressive chewer who finishes these in under five minutes. He doesn't chew them as much as bite of chunks of it. My other dog isn't quite as strong of a chewer but it usually takes her just around fifteen minutes to eat the whole thing (this review is specific to the Biggest Boodas). So for my dogs this is less of a chewing experience and more of a treat. And when the eat them this quickly, they do get expensive quick.

I like that they are safer than rawhide bones and easy to digest and she really seems to enjoy them more than other bones I've bought for her. I tried a few other brands when I stopped being able to find the booda bones at pet stores and she would not even eat some of them. You can't go wrong with these, they are reasonibly priced, safe, help reduce tartar, and dogs seem to love them.

review/summary: Really good!
review/text: Let me start by saying that I'm a lifelong tea drinker and I love tea, and I've tried all sorts.<br /><br />I started out years ago with Lipton's before all these different designer brands and flavors came along. Black Ceylon tea was what they called it. Then when all these designer brands and flavors came out I tried all the exotic flavors I could get my hands on, mango, vanilla, raspberry, chocoloate, peach, whatever. I tried different brands, I tried expensive teas, cheap teas, organic teas, the standards such as Earl Grey, Darjeeling, Assam, etc.<br /><br />Finally, I came back to this tea. It was like travelling around the world in a circle and coming back to the start. I love this tea because I've found all that other stuff, apple, peach, raspberry, just detracts from the true flavor of tea. This tea is just pure tea, without any other distracting flavors and that's what I love about it. A stong tea, a robust tea with full strong flavor, for a man (or a manly woman).<br /><br />When I make it just right, the right temperature, the right strength, this is what I imagine Homer's nectar of the gods to be like. It's like Zeus brews me a cup, hands it over and says "here, drink this".<br /><br />So far I have not been able to find another unadulterated tea with such a full and strong flavor. A 10/10.

review/summary: South African Secret.
review/text: South Africans are as avid tea drinkers as the inhabitants of any other country (formerly) belonging to the British Commmonwealth - today, consumption averages about 10 billion cups per year - and tea was first grown in Durban Botanical Gardens in 1850 from plants imported from London's Kew Gardens (commercial production began in 1877, with seeds from Assam). Yet, production around the major tea center of Tzaneen in the Northern Province (formerly known as North-East Transvaal) as well as in the country's other tea growing locations has had an unstable history; staggering badly in the mid-twentieth century and although revived thereafter, available only domestically during apartheid. Only after apartheid ended, South African tea farmers were able to export their products. Hence, black tea from South Africa is still a fairly well-kept secret; although roughly 40% of the country's tea is now sold on the world market and it is already among the world's top 20 tea-producing nations.<br /><br />Harvested before the beginning of the winter cool, between October and April, a tea fairly well-known outside South Africa is that produced by the Ntingwe Estate located in a remote corner of the Kwazulu-Natal heartland. Established in 1987 and with over 200 permanent employees, 430 seasonal pickers as well as a program involving the cooperation of local farmers with the estate's on-site processing plant, Ntingwe is *the* single biggest employer and source of financial stability in a region otherwise plagued by record unemployment numbers (up to 60%), illiteracy and poverty. Lighter than other African (e.g. Kenyan) teas, Ntingwe tea has gained an excellent reputation in the short time since its introduction to the international market and makes for as great a breakfast tea as an afternoon refreshment or a pick-me-up throughout the day.

review/summary: My favorite soups
review/text: Amy's soups are a staple. They are hearty and filling unlike their condensed competitors and the lentil and minestrone are my two favorites. Unlike most other soups these lend themselves very easily to added spices and they have a lot of potential uses in cooking. Amy's is a great company and I eat a lot of their products when I can afford them. This is a great deal that they have on Amazon.

review/summary: Variety Pack
review/text: This variety pack contains Minestrone and Lentil soup.  The pack contains 8 as stated on the box.  (The description says 6, but you do in fact receive 8:  four minestrone and 4 lentil.)  Both soups taste very good and are filling. I wish Amy's offered more variety packs.  It is on the pricey side, but it is one of the better organic/healthy soup options out there, so I will continue to buy.

review/summary: Tastiest Ever
review/text: Amys makes my favorite vegetarian soups!  I particularly love the lentil, with it's floating carrot and potato bits.  It's hearty and very flavorful.  The minestrone is the only canned minestrone I'll eat, but it's still not my favorite.  It is a delicious soup with a great base.

review/text: Love these soups, great value for money. Would have given it 5 starts if I could have something other than minestrone with the lentil. Not even Amy's can manage to make canned pasta not be mushy.

review/summary: Fills the stomach
review/text: I got this from BJ's thinking they were gluten free. The lentil one is gluten free. Minestrone is not. They do not claim it is gluten free. I had eaten lentil soup before so I just assumed minestrone one was also gluten free.<br /><br />I have been a vegetarian all my life. So I know when there is a weird fishy smell to something. The soups did not smell fishy. Of course it tastes different. But this can be attributed only to the product being in a can and not being fresh. One can will fill you stomach (unless you are craving to eat more and not actually feeling hungry).
