review/summary: Nestle fat free hot cocoa mix
review/text: I really like Nestle non fat hot cocoa mix.It is low cal but still tastes good. I mix it with dry instant coffee and put in my  microwaved hot water. I used to buy the cocoa mix at the store and had to buy  the packets because the store didn't carry the canisters.<br />It is cheaper getting it through Amazon.com!!

review/text: great purchase.  I live alone, and am the only one drinking this... wish that i could have bought it in a small size package.  Hopefully I will go through it all before the expiration date.  It is wonderful to know that you can have a "zero" point weight watchers snack in the evening.... It felt like having dessert without the guilt.  It mixes well, and was creamy and chocolately.  I would recommend to all!!

review/text: I also LOVE this stuff!!!<br /><br />Unfortunately, I believe Nestle's has stopped making it.<br /><br />I actually wrote them TWO letters.  They replied that the sales numbers weren't strong enough to warrant the continued production of it.<br /><br />I just can't believe this.  I think they simply tried to re-tool their formulas for some unknown reason.<br /><br />In my opinion, they should have stuck to the old adage:  "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."  Because they did, and none of their new products compare to this flavor--I have tried several of the competitors also--still searching!

review/summary: A delicious cocoa mix
review/text: We made batches of hot chocolate for the people walking down our street looking at the neighborhood Christmas lights. Everyone loved it. The chocolate flavor doesn't overwhelm the taste buds. The best part is that hot water is all that's needed. One note of caution: The person making the hot chocolate must adjust the amount of mix to get good results. She didn't follow the directions on the can, but did a taste test for each batch.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I tried this flavor since Nestle appears to have stopped making my favorite, Double Chocolate Meltdown.  This flavor is not as watered down as the Rich flavor, and for that I'm glad.  However, as a dark chocolate lover and someone who enjoys a true, deep chocolate taste, I was disappointed.  This flavor is more bitter than bittersweet.  It did not satisfy my palette, and it's unlikely that I will purchase any more of the current Nestle hot chocolate flavors.

review/summary: Sweetens well, but if you're used to and like the Starbucks Vanilla Sugar Free syrup...not comparable
review/text: I got this to try in making my lattes (hot and cold) at home, where I was used to using the Starbucks syrup. This seemed like a very  nice deal, pricewise, with subscribe and save.<br /><br />The syrup is nicely sweet, so you don't need to add any other sweetener when using this. And it's intensely vanilla-ey. I just found the vanilla flavor on this oddly cloying and somewhat unappealing. Granted, this is very subjective, and you  may love it like so many others in reviews here.<br /><br />But if you like the vanilla-ey-ness of the Starbucks sugar free syrup or the Cook's vanilla extract, this is not comparable and you may, like me, not really want to use it in your coffee. I find it kinda makes me not wanna finish my latte.<br /><br />So, YMMV, natch. Just putting this here for those who do really like the particular type of vanilla flavor in the Starbucks syrup and who may find this "just not right" according to personal preference.<br /><br />HTH, enjoy!

review/text: I have always liked Torani syrup, since it is made with pure cane sugar and not high fructose corn syrup. It has a much milder sweet taste and sweetens ice coffee perfectly! The vanilla flavor is not overwhelming, very mellow and still lets you get the full taste of the coffee. I paid 15 for 3 bottles on Amazon, which is a great price. One bottle should last a long time. Highly recommended!

review/text: I love the flavor of vanilla, from chocolate to ice cream, vanilla has always been my go to flavor. My favorite soda is Vanilla Coke, and they are under very low production as of now. Whenever I tried to purchase them online, the price would me tremendously high. Now you might be thinking how is this relevant? Well I started to look for alternative and I came across product. I did enough research and asked restaurant.owners, and they all referred me to this item. I am so glad I asked around, this product mixed with coke just the right amount gives it the classic Coca Cola vanilla taste that I loved growing up. This product bonds very well with coffee also, if your looking for a vanilla taste. Of course I have not tried this product with a lot of drinks but the few I did, this is perfect. Give it a try, you will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Okay but absolutely nothing to get excited about...
review/text: I recently purchased a bottle each of the Sugar Free Chocolate and the regular Vanilla because I had two $1.00 coupons for this product, and I thought why not try it, as I love coffee and thought this product may be a nice treat to add to my coffee. After drinking two or three cups of coffee with either the regular Vanilla or the Sugar Free Chocolate, I can tell you that the regular Vanilla is okay but nothing to get excited about, and the Sugar Free Chocolate leaves everything to be desired.  After trying two flavours, I certainly would not rush to send emails to friends and family to tell them of a great find for their coffee.<br /><br />The sugar free leaves behind a very, very unpleasant aftertaste in my opinion, even though I am used to diet soda, etc. The aftertaste is so strong and so unpleasant that the only way I am able to get rid of the aftertaste is to brush my teeth!  Something that is delicious does not make you want to brush your teeth after drinking it.  The regular Vanilla was better than the Sugar Free Chocolate, but of course, it has a whopping 20 sugars per serving, which is more than a can of regular soda. Twenty sugars is a very high sugar count, and it is very fattening, so the sugared varieties are not something one would want to use regularly unless one was intentionally trying to put on weight.<br /><br />Also, I have noticed that these syrups tend NOT to remain well mixed in my coffee despite the fact that I stir well.  I plan to offer the bottle of Sugar Free Chocolate to a friend (albeit with a warning) because the aftertaste is just too unpleasant for me.  The Sugar Free Chocolate should be called Bitter Chocolate in my opinion.  I even added real sugar to my coffee with the Sugar Free Chocolate, and not even real sugar helped!  The Sugar Free version is simply a waste of money in my opinion.  If adding real sugar does not improve the taste, you know there is something in this product which is not very good, and I think it is the Splenda sugar substitute.  Personally, I have always found Equal to be the best sugar substitute.  I have never used Splenda or products containing Splenda before, but I think Equal would have been a much, much better choice for sugar substitution here.<br /><br />My advice is not to purchase the sugar free varieties because they are just not very tasty and leave such an unpleasant aftertaste. Buy the regular varieties, if you must, and use them once in a while as a treat in your coffee or your soda instead of having a dessert for example.  Also, be prepared to keep your spoon in cup in order to keep stirring your coffee before each sip to keep the syrup mixed in the coffee, otherwise, it separates and can be seen to sort of float on the top in a very unappealing way. I cannot understand why it will not stay well mixed in coffee. There is a lot of room for improvement of this product.

review/text: We love flavored syrups in our lattes and coffee and we make Italian sodas at home.  Torani syrups are second to none.  We have tried the Davinci and the Monin brands, but we always come back to Torani.  The flavor is well balanced; it enhances your beverage, it does not overpower it!

review/text: I love to use this syrup in my coffee (and other flavors to make slushies for my kids).  The pricing is great with subscribe and save (and even better when they offer the additional 10% off).  The problem is Amazon shipping is horrible.  I had to have my last shipment replaced 3 times since the bottles kept arriving damaged during shipment.  The warehouse does put any protective packaging in the box or using a box way too big.  Then the bottles move around too much during shipment and leak all over.  Amazon is great about replacing the items but my last order was replaced multiple times because each time the bottles arrived broken open and leaking all over.  Great price, but really not worth the hassle.

review/summary: Awesome vegan frittata!
review/text: While the directions require a bit of watching the stove and clock, the few minutes required to bake this frittata are well worth it. I've tried this flavor and the rosemary frittata and both are delicious. This one, however, is warm so if you are not one for anything over mild, I'd stay away from this and check out the rosemary or the traditional. The spicy flavor can also overpower flavors in pilaf (something I normally serve with this).<br />The prep is easy; just add water, oil, and salt, stir, and bake. I've never had frittata before this brand as I'm not a big egg fan, but when I saw this alternative at the store I wanted to try it. I was not disappointed. The price at the store is cheaper for me than here on Amazon (at the moment - that often changes), but I thought it was worth it to review here anyway.

review/summary: My very favorite diet salad dressing
review/text: UPDATED REVIEW 4/2/08:<br /><br />SAD NEWS. KRAFT HAS TOTALLY REFORMULATED THIS DRESSING. IT NO LONGER CONTAINS LEMON JUICE AND HAS A STRONG SOUR VINEGAR TASTE. THEY ALSO INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF CALORIES IN THE DRESSING. THERE ARE VERY FEW MILD, LOW CAL, NON SWEET VINEGRETTES OUT THERE. IT'S A SHAME THAT KRAFT KILLED THIS ONE.<br /><br />--OLD REVIEW--<br /><br />This is a refreshing light and not very  sweet vinagrette that tastes more of lemon juice than vinegar and has a nice garlic and pepper kick.<br /><br />In this day and age of sugary and gummy diet dressings this awesome dressing is a breath of fresh air!!<br /><br />I believe this is Krafts original vinaigrette dressing which leads me to one caveat: Like it did in the old days, it contains MSG. Now unless you are sensitive to MSG, this is actually a very GOOD THING. It makes the salad sing with taste even though the dressing only has 50 calories in two tablespoons. That would not be possible without MSG and which is why I think so many salad dressings these days are sugary bland disasters - because the manufacturers are afraid to add MSG. Sometimes  politically incorrect ingredients from the old days are great!<br /><br />I love to use 2 or three tablespoons of this dressing over a huge veggie and feta cheese salad... it makes those veggies sing on your tongue!!!<br /><br />Get it quick, I heard rumors that Kraft may be thinking of killing this product off. I hope not!!!!!

I sent an email to the owner of the company asking where I could pick up the sauce. He replied within hours notifying me of the Amazon option via MountainWave. I put on large tailgates for all the OU football games and this sauce is now featured on many of the meat dishes that I make including a smoked pulled pork as well as smoked chicken wings. One of its great attributes is its level of spice as It caters to a wide array of individuals (Not too spicy/ Not too mild)! I find this sauce is also great on non-meat items such as low-fat cottage cheese and even a bit on some grilled asparagus. I received my order in 3 days and in great condition. Thank you Schultz's and MountainWave!

review/summary: Pasteurized kombucha. Get real.
review/text: I was looking to see what amazon had as far as kombucha goes and came across this drink.  I did a little research and realized this stuff is pasteurized.  I must repeat- PASTEURIZED.  One of the main reasons to drink kombucha is to bring beneficial bacteria into the gut to balance gut flora to aid digestion, nutrient absorption and to fight off bad bacteria and other invaders.  Pasteurization kills this bacteria rendering them useless.  There are still plenty of B vitamins in the drink that the body may still utilize even after pasteurization.  If you are buying it for taste and the small amount of B vitamins, go for it.  If you are buying it to nourish your body and introduce probiotics into your system, forget this product.  Instead, make your own kombucha, check out raw brands such as GT's or other local brands(In Madison WI we have Nessala which is raw, nutritious and delicious) or invest in some refrigerated probiotics.

review/text: I'll never buy 'cola' again. Thank god there is a real and healthful alternative to junk soda.<br />I prefer the unflavored. Don't care for the flavored at all.<br />You can also use the unflavored to make your own. I guess you could use the flavored though it is not recommended by Kombucha "purists".<br />If you love the feel of carbonated drinks and the burp after a good, cold swig on a hot day you'll be hooked.

review/text: Not a typical tasting drink. If you are familiar with kombucha, this product tastes great. If you have never had kombucha, you will be surprised by the slight vinegar taste, and by the fact that this tea is not sweet at all. Overall a great tasting kombucha tea

review/summary: Decent, but not as good as the lemon + green tea
review/text: Well, in another review I mentioned in passing that this brand's "green tea and lemon" is better, and I stand by that impression.  I've gone through about half of a case of this one, and even though it isn't any different from a calorie perspective, it just seems too sweet for my taste.  I'm sure there will be those that would love the extra sweetness, and in fact it's very much like sweetened tea with some vinegar essence added.  Overall, it's quite drinkable, and it's not a bad way to get started on a Kombucha habit.  It won't replace GT Dave's Kombucha, but to me it's better than some of the other brands floating around, and it's certainly better than no Kombucha at all.

review/summary: The things we do for "health"...
review/text: I think this stuff is disgusting. I have been hearing about the "wonderfulness" of Kombucha and instead of getting a can from my local health food store, I bought a case thinking I was saving a lot of money. I do not know good Kombucha from bad Kombucha, but who could tell the difference? It must be an acquired taste because I am pretty adventurous in food and drink. If you are unfamiliar with Kombucha, it is fermented tea, which tastes yeasty, moldy, spoiled and vinegary all at once. Also, it smells like dirty socks. It is like drinking something that has been hiding in the back of the fridge since christmas of 1988. Ewww!! Since my hairdresser chatters all the time about this stuff, he is getting 23 cans as a tip next time. I gave it 2 stars because it might just be the best Kombucha ever but I will never know. P.s. Kombucha used to have a bit of alcohol in it from the fermentation untill Lidnsay Lohan supposedly tested positive after drinking some (?), ruining Kombucha for everyone. Now it doesn't have any alcohol, I dont know how they get it out though. But even if there was the benefit of a little buzz, I would rather get it by drinking something that actually tastes good.

review/summary: Royal Knockout!!!
review/text: TWININGS ENGLISH AFTERNOON TEA in the distinctive reddish-purple box is one heavenly tea that one simply cannot survive without having in the cupboard. Made from a spectacular Keemun ('Hong Cha') and Ceylon blend, this Twinings will put a guaranteed smile on your face that could only be removed by either having to drink coffee again, or running totally out of tea (only blackguards do THAT).<br /><br />I have touted this as my second-favorite tea, a close second only to the bible-black, rich and fertile <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4J74G">Twinings Irish Breakfast Decaf Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> (which by the way is available in both decaf and normal). These teas cry out for a splash of cold milk or cream - but as I often say, it is no sin to drink it black as does my wife. The only sin is in NOT drinking it.<br /><br />In the event it interests you, Twinings tea bags are designed like Lipton's clever invention, the 'double' tea bag (what they originally named "FLOW-THROUGH") that you can puff apart a bit if you like before steeping it. Twinings does not have any staples anywhere on their teabags, unlike other companies with a staple here and a staple there. You might as well buy staple-flavored tea.<br /><br />Learn the secret of the Royal Family and all those classy people who think 'Twinings' when they think 'tea'.

review/text: What else can I say? Twinings is a quality company. The expense was reasonable and the English Afternoon tea carries a delightful bouquet that's reminiscent of its cousin, the English Breakfast tea, but lighter. I'll most definitely be purchasing again and likely through Amazon, because the price is reasonable (especially with Prime free shipping) and my local grocery stores don't carry English Afternoon.

review/summary: Worst soup broth I've EVER had
review/text: I am in love with pho, and so of course the idea of being able to make it at home was appealing.  The first clue that this product and I were not going to get along was the smell.  As it began to simmer my apartment started to smell so gross that I thought something must be stuck on my burner and was smelling.  When I realized the smell was coming from the soup I decided to give it a try (this was just the broth at this point, I had not yet added anything).  It tasted TERRIBLE.  I rarely want to just spit something out, but this stuff was so foul - the various spices are not in harmony and they are completely overpowering - the lime and the star anise together so stongly made it unedible.<br /><br />Seriously, don't try this stuff.  I'm still airing out my apartment and trying to cleanse my poor taste buds.  Nasty.

review/summary: Just plain BAD
review/text: Pho is one of my all-time favorite foods. When I saw this at the grocery store, I was extremely excited. I'd been waiting for a product like this for a long time. I bought both the chicken and veggie varieties.<br /><br />Both flavors were terrible.  Neither tastes anything like any bowl of Pho I've ever tasted. It's horrific. Both flavors have a terrible citrusy/sweet taste that just doesn't come close to Pho -- or taste good in any way.<br /><br />I give this product a (very generous) two stars because the idea is awesome, and the organic/MSG-free recipe caught my eye.  Unfortunately, the execution is terrible. I can't believe the people that made this product let it go to market tasting like it does. I won't be buying this ever again unless they completely reformulate their recipe.

review/text: Ask a Chinese friend about "forbidden rice" (&#31105;&#31859;), unless they are history buff like myself, they will give you a puzzled look.  The term refers to an obscure trade policy during Manchurian dynasty, not an exotic rice.  I will not going to bore you  with history here.<br /><br />The story about emperor depriving commoners of red rice is a hoax made in America, like the legion of fortune cookies. Most fortune cookies are made in a wholesome factory near Atlanta.  We trust that fortune cookies are safe to eat.  "Forbidden rice?"<br /><br />There is a red rice in China, dark red, close to red bean.  The color varies from gran to gran. Its thick bran provides a pleasant nutty flavor and al dente texture.  The color does not come off easily.  You can get them from Chinese grocery store.<br /><br />What is sold as "forbidden rice" at Amazon and Costco has a uniformed black to deep purple color.  It appears to be rice over-milled, dyed, and polished.  Drop a few grains in water, you can see color coming off.  And the color tent to sink to the bottom. That is a easy tell tail.  When cooked, the favor and texture of bran are absent.  If they use red rice, they have milled away its bran to make the rice easy to dye.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with using food coloring.  But is the ink FDA approved?  We do not know.  The label does not say.<br /><br />I am returning mine to Costco.  I will ask Costco to pull it off the shelf.

I would have to say that if you use this for baking in place of another major caramel sauce brand like Smuckers, Mrs. Richardsons, ect. this flavor will win hands down.  You can't go wrong with this one.  I have a "Better Than Sex" Bar Recipe that goes to US Soldiers in the Sand when it's cool enough in the fall and winter.  This makes those completely awesome.  Rich, thick and tastes like liquified brown sugar.  If you like caramel in your coffee or latte, this is the stuff!!!
