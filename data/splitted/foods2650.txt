review/text: I have been looking for a really good Expresso coffee and  I finally found it. I used this in my regular Mr. Coffee maker and it was very good, I also used it in my travel and my 2 to go maker and still it did not loose it's flavor. Tip, try it with Coffeemate Italian Sweet Cream for a quick latte. Can't wait to use it with an expresso machine.

review/summary: too coarse for espresso
review/text: This coffee is ground too coarsely to make decent espresso in either of my two Capresso machines.  I filled the portafilter to the top and tamped as hard as I could, but when I brew the water runs through the filter way too fast.  I get about 3 oz. of coffee in 10 seconds instead the ideal 1 oz. in 25 seconds.  This results in strong coffee instead of actual espresso.  I've tried to make this as regular coffee in a french press as well, but the 70% robusto bean in the blend makes for a pretty bland cup of coffee.

review/summary: Burnt taste nothing like Lavazza
review/text: I bought this from Amazon since they don't have this kind of coffee locally. I had purchased the identical brand and boldness about a year ago.  Wow, this stuff doesn't even taste like what I had originally! It has an awful burnt taste that lingers as an aftertaste. It really doesn't even compare to what I had before. They must have changed the beans or reduced the quality because it is not smooth at all and has a bitterness and aftertaste that reminds me of the lingering taste after smoking a cigarette. I've decided to switch brands completely. No returns it so I'm stuck with 3 1/2 bricks of sub-par coffee grounds.

review/summary: Refreshing coffee, a hit with the office
review/text: deployed in the military doesn't always mean you need to miss out on the finer things in life. Another co-worker and myself enjoy our coffee everyday and talking about the brewing smells that come with it. I was able to snag this for 3 bucks a brick. This is some smooth and great tasting coffee. The taste going down your throat is amazing and when we open a new vacuum sealed bag we both take a big whiff of that great ground coffee smell. It makes a pretty strong cup of joe(caffeine too) and not for that bad of a price. Our bags don't expire until the end of 2012 but we don't have to worry about that since we are on our third bag already... this won't replace our regular brands but is a good change. thanks to amazon for shipping this to us.

review/summary: excellent taste, decaf please
review/text: My absolute favorite. So smooth and not bitter at all.  With cream and sugar it tastes like premium coffee ice cream.  I use it in my small drip coffee maker, because I'm usually too busy to make with the espresso maker.  It tastes the same either way, just with less water.<br /><br />My only issue with it is that after drinking it every day for six months I developed heart palpitations. I previously was not a daily coffee drinker, so that probably has something to do with it, but I am only in my early thirties. They don't make a decaf version, and I have yet to find one that tastes as smooth.  So now it's only for special occasions, never days in a row.<br /><br />So if you are sure your heart is VERY healthy (I thought mine was before I had issues), go for it.  But tread lightly, and be sure to keep well hydrated.

review/text: Lavazza is a great Italian brand name and the Crema e Gusto blend is a fairly new introduction to the Lavazza catalog. I first tried the Crema e Gusto in Europe and quickly became addicted! I packed my suitcase full when I came home and it was worth the effort. All of the Lavazza blends are excellent, but this blend is particularly special- it is very smooth and rich with virtually no bitterness at all. I brew it in a stove-top espresso maker and it's absolutely perfect every time.

review/summary: My favorite coffee. Very rich and full flavored.
review/text: One taste was all it took for me. I tried Lavazza at a local coffee house in Denver and really enjoyed the taste. No bitterness at all. Very full flavored coffee.<br /><br />I came across this as the word "Crema" caught my eye. Now I am ordering it using the subscribe and save. It is running me $17.41 for every order and that's with free 2 day shipping because of the Prime Membership.<br /><br />Each brick lasts about 10 days for 2 people drinking 6 cups of coffee every morning. I use 1 tablespoon coffee for every 6 ounces of water brewed in a Target Michael Graves design automatic drip coffeemaker. The "Flavor" button really brings it out in this coffee. I love my coffee with half and half and it really seems to compliment it well.<br /><br />The packages are vacuumed sealed and take up very little space. It really is a 5 star coffee.

review/summary: Rich and flavorful - even from the "wrong" pot!
review/text: I found a brick of Lavazza Crema e Gusto at a local shop some months ago, and tried it in my stovetop espresso maker. For some reason I thought the grind was what I needed (it *does* have a picture of a stovetop machine on it!) but the grind is really very fine, more like what a professional-type machine needs.<br /><br />But this works even in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001DJT7G">Bialetti Brikka 4-Cup Stovetop Percolator</a> stovetop machine, and generates a beautiful crema. The Brikka really wants a slightly coarser grind, so I have to be *very* careful to put in the coffee with a light touch, and not to pack it down even a tiny bit.<br /><br />The flavor, as others have written, is very rich without being too dark-roasted, with lovely chocolatey notes. Bitterness can come if I overfill the maker so that the coffee is packed too hard, which causes boiling and burning. So care must be taken when using a stovetop maker. But it's truly worth it, because it gives such delicious coffee.

review/summary: Not the greatest, but not the worst either.
review/text: I drink espresso (moka) daily, and go through a 250g/8.8oz brick in about 2 weeks. In my opinion, this isn't the greatest blend from Lavazza that I've had, but it's not the worst coffee I've had either (it definitely beats the drip coffee I'd otherwise get at work). It's a 70/30 robusta/arabica blend, a dark roast with a fruity though noticeably bitter finish (but not as bad as Starbucks or Peet's coffee). The Lavazza Espresso (black tin, 100% arabica claimed) tastes better than this blend, but after having tried Illy's moka grind, the different blends from Lavazza, Kimbo, Segafredo, and also blends from the local coffee roasters, I actually think that a robusta/arabica blend works best for a moka pot; just not this one. Overall, I'd say that I got what I paid for, but I didn't get what I wanted and I was seduced by the 93 or so 4/5 star reviews for this coffee. I'd really give it a 2.5 or 3 but then again, all taste is subjective, That being said, this is a reasonable coffee (considering taste vs. price), but I'll probably switch back to my regular (and unfortunately more expensive) blend.

review/summary: Good, Mild Flavor, High Caffeine Coffee
review/text: I consider myself a reasonable coffee enthusiast having done tours of places like Intelligentsia and know a decent bit about how to make the right brew.<br /><br />That said, Lavazza Crema e Gusto is an interesting 30% Arabica, 70% Robusto blend.  It's well known that Robusto beans have less flavor than Arabica and are cheaper, but tend to higher in caffeine content.  That said, that is pretty much what you get with this blend.  It's in all technical aspects a lower quality product, Robusto is considered a low end bean that you will almost never find it in American consumer coffee.  Even instant coffee tends to tout 100% Arabica as well-informed consumers prefer the full flavor.<br /><br />What's interesting is that Lavazza has decided to mix it, and so there's that coffee flavor coming from the Arabica, but it's mild due to how it's diluted.  The "creaminess" I would say comes in part from the very fine grind they use, hence it comes packaged in these vacuum-packed bricks that are more like a mold when you open the bag than the usual medium grind you'll see.  As a result, whether you drip or french press it, you get some of that bean filtrate coming through and it gives it a more creamy texture which is in all actuality the bean particulate coming through.<br /><br />Finally the caffeine kick is awesome, as it's probably 2x stronger than your average coffee thanks to the Robusto beans and the super fine grind, making it a solid wake up coffee.  I personally don't like the taste of it straight as compared to other 100% Arabica coffees like Sumatra or Columbian (which are my preferences) as it's just it's just too bland for my tastes but a touch of milk and sugar brings out more mellow flavors and again that subtle texture.  Good for mornings, but I wouldn't necessarily ever have it as my go to coffee my evening cup.

Robusta is mixed in cheap blends because it is cheap. Tastes awful too... ). Also, the price of this coffe does not reflect the low quality - it should be way cheaper.<br />I normally buy Lavazza Oro, but somehow the quality of that coffee deteriorated in the last year or so).

review/text: I've tried several brands and flavors of ground coffee from Amazon, and this is by far the.best.coffee.I've.had. I decided to write a review because last weekend my husband made me a latte, and it was yummy. I asked for a second one, and what he gave me was not what I had the first time. I asked him what was different, and he told me he used a different brand and flavor. He was really surprised that I could tell. The one that I LOVED was the Lavazza Crema e Gusto. Wow. What a difference. It's smooth and full bodied - okay, I'm full of crap. I have no idea what "full bodied" is other than a fat chick. But I can tell you this -- this coffee is tasty and you will not regret buying it.<br /><br />I bought it in January because there was a deal going on - $12 for 4 bricks. But here I am willing to pay $15 for 4 bricks (S&S price) less than 2 months later. I wish I had stocked up when it was cheaper, but who knew the coffee was going to be THAT GOOD! It's so worth even $18 for 4 bricks!

review/summary: Strong cup of coffee. I deal for making iced coffee.
review/text: What type of coffee drinker am I?<br />In our Cuisinart coffee maker my wife and I use 1.5 tablespoons of Dunkin Donuts coffee per 6 oz of water so we like our coffee pretty strong. However, neither one of us goes out of our way to get Starbucks because we don't like the taste for some reason. If Starbucks is considered bitter, that is probably why.<br /><br />Review.<br />I would consider this coffee bold yet not bitter. It's definitely full flavored yet not over powering. Maybe that is what "Crema e Gusto" is specifying. The ratio of coffee to water for a Dunkin Donuts drinker is about 3/4 of a table spoon to 6oz of water. I accredit the smaller ratio to how finely ground the coffee is rather than overall strength.<br /><br />I drink iced coffee in the summer so even though it is January I had to try it. This coffee is IDEAL for making iced coffee because you can make it at 1.5 table spoons to 6oz of water and the taste is not effected by a little bit of ice melting. I can not stress enough how good this coffee is iced!<br /><br />I am defiantly enjoying the LavAzza and may try other varieties to make hot coffee but this is my go to for iced coffee from now on!

review/summary: tasty in the keurig
review/text: well after 2 months of trying new k-cup flavors, i got tired of the expense and waste. i bought a reusable k-cup from amazon (ecobrew) and am in the process of finding the perfect bean. THIS IS IT!!! i fill my cup halfway and brew it on the 8oz setting. not only is it a perfect cup of rich flavorful coffee, the bag has lasted soooo long! i bought when it was 12 bucks for 4 bags (subscribe and save) and i think this will last at least 2 months drinking 2-3 cups a day. absolutely no waste! i love my keurig and lavazza!!!<br /><br />i also have a wonderful espresso machine that i use this in, however the keurig is my new coffee toy to play with. either way the lavazza tastes great.<br /><br />note: it brews a lot slower due to the fine ground BUT this is the way to extract all the flavor. it is brews way too slow use less in the k-cup filter.

review/summary: illy fan is loving this blend in our home machine
review/text: As my wife and I found we had become "those people" who stop at the local coffee shop many times a week, we needed to hit the lotto, quit or buy a machine and learn to make our own go-juice.<br /><br />This coffee brews wonderfully in our new DeLonghi Bar32 (EC155 clone) - the fine grind makes the cheezy built-in tamper more than good enough, reducing counter-clutter. And the crema produced is a dream - though the fancy, much older, espresso machine at work can't hope to achieve this with me driving it --- the DeLonghi is just newbie-proof and brews this blend really really nicely.<br /><br />Though she was initially disappointed I didn't splurge on the illy to christen the new machine, she likes the lattes we're making at home more than her $3 coffee shop favorite. This blend is fine for my mocha, too, though if she didn't LOVE this coffee I'd give the Rossa a whirl looking for just a little stronger flavor to stand up with the cocca powder. Frankly - this is making as good a mocha as what I buy at any of my 3 shops, so I'm happy too!<br /><br />Glad I trusted the reviews. I just signed up for a "subscription" - can't beat the price!

review/summary: LAVAZZA CREME E GUSTO V LAVAZZA ROSSA
review/text: I decided to try the Lavazza blue pack (Crema e Gusto) instead of the one that I had found to be perfect in Europe, the Red pack or Lavazza Rossa. I like it but not as much as the Rossa. For my taste it is a little too mocha flavored and I prefer the more robust cafe espresso flavor of the red pack. The price for either coffee is very competetive, particularly if you take advantage of the subscription ordering option. I will be switching back to the Lavazza Rossa.

review/text: This is a great espresso, and amazon has the BEST price out there!  I can't drink hot coffee in the summer, so I have started brewing this the night before.  I make about 4 double shots, but brew it more like an americano - into a small pyrex cup.  Then I allow it to cool, pour it into a container with a little ice, and the next morning, voila - Iced Americano as soon as I wake up without having to mess with the espresso machine.  I have tried other brands, Illy, Fresh and Easy, but this is my favorite and the price is right.

review/summary: This is the coffee I have been looking for
review/text: First had Lavazza at a local coffee shop and was floored. To me, this is what coffee should taste like. It is bold and strong, but no bitterness whatsoever. I recently bought a Curtis commercial coffee maker and was hoping for the same experience from my office and home. After a few different coffees (mostly local whole bean), I was disappointed that my coffee wasn't turning out as good as the cafe I went to. To my surprise, the next time I visited the local grocery store, I saw this Lavazza brand in the Italian isle. I immediately bought it and brewed it that night. After the first sip, I knew I had hit the jackpot. This is what I have been waiting for. All along it had been the coffee making the difference. The Curtis helps significantly with ensuring the proper temperature of the brew, but it is really the coffee that makes all the difference. I am impressed in the packaging and was surprised how packed they are able to get the ground coffee.<br /><br />BTW - I have only used this for my drip coffee maker - have not used it for espresso yet. For my taste, one coffee scoop (1/8 cup / or 2 tablespoons) for every 16 oz of water.<br /><br />As long as Amazon or my local grocer carries this coffee, I will be buying it. Wish I could give it more than 5 stars. .

review/summary: Very nice coffee blend
review/text: I started drinking coffee only about a month or so ago, but I was interested in trying some finer coffees.  This blend was very nice, with a nice rich coffee flavor without all the bitterness you would find with cheaper coffee.  I have not tried this with espresso, as I do not own an espresso machine.  With a drip machine, you will still experience the wonderfully bold flavor of this coffee.  I have had a few of my friends that love coffee try this blend and they were just as impressed as I was.  This is a must have in my house!

review/summary: Undeniably delicious!
review/text: I recently purchased a Bialetti stovetop espresso maker, and read that Lavazza was a well-suited brand for use in this maker. After a few trials in getting the right coffee:water ratio, I can say that this blend of coffee is smooth, aromatic, and definitely delicious. I am a strong coffee drinker, and this dark roast coffee is a blend of Robutso and Arabica beans which makes the flavor much stronger and rich. It's definitely a full-bodied roast with great chocolate notes. Buy this coffee, and you will truly enjoy it, use it with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CNY6UK">Bialetti 6800 Moka Express 6-Cup Stovetop Espresso Maker</a> and you will not be disappointed!

This coffee is smooth (i.e. not acidic) but it packs a big flavor. If you're looking for a coffee that packs a good punch, this is the one. If you want more subtlety, I would go for the for the Lavassa Caffe Espresso.

review/text: This is an amazing coffee.  Intense flavor, but not bitter.<br /><br />I use it in my Bialetti Moka espresso maker and the results are no less than phenomenal.  I prefer it served in shot form, as is.  But I've also tried it with a little sugar in the shot (very tasty), with a little frothed almond milk to create a cappuccino (good), and my husband has had it with frothed milk, and a little sugar to create a latte (he enjoys it immensely).<br /><br />I have always had an affinity for strong coffee, so this works out wonderfully for me.  Rich, intense flavor without the associated bitterness most coffee's have.<br /><br />I recommend you try it!

review/summary: Excellent for pre-ground coffee!
review/text: First of, there is nothing better than a cup of coffee made with fresh beans, being ground right before making the cup of coffee.  That being said, the Lavazza Crema e Gusto coffee is actually kind of great.  I bought it based on the number of great reviews on Amazon.  Opening the package I immediately noticed the back of the bag of coffee - it says 70% robusta beans and 30% arabica beans.  I was immediately nervous that this coffee would be horribly bitter, but after making a double "shot" Americano from my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047BIWSK">Aerobie AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker</a> my fears disappeared. It is a very smooth, almost chocolatey coffee.  This coffee will be perfect to keep at my office where it's near impossible to get a good cup of coffee.

review/summary: Great in the Bialetti Moka Pot
review/text: This is nice, full-bodied espresso, which I brew in my moka pot.  It doesn't do much to get crema in a moka pot, but then not much will with this method... but with the Robusta in this blend, you should experience crema a bit more easily in a machine. With my stove-top milk frother, a little steamed milk brings out the chocolaty notes described by Lavazza, and it's a nice morning treat.<br /><br />This amount (4 bricks, 8.8oz each) has lasted me a good 3 months of summertime use in a 6c moka pot.  I'll probably go to every 2 months on my subscription for autumn through spring.

review/summary: New Espresso Drinker
review/text: I purchased this brand of coffee when I purchased Bialetti Moka Express L'Original 12 Cup Espresso Maker. Up until now, I've had no experience with either. Normally, I'm the type of person to find one brand of coffee and stick with it. When the price of my current brand of coffee shot up, I started looking around for something else.<br /><br />What caught my eye was the Arabica/Indian/Robusta blend. It sounded so exotic. Plus, the chocolaty flavor in the description. I've never been one for dark coffee, but if it had a chocolaty undertone, I was in. Besides, the onetime cost of $20.13 for a pack of four (as of 07/23/2011) was reasonable.<br /><br />My cup of coffee is mixed with equal parts of cream, but my husband only uses a little. Both of us agree this is a smooth cup of coffee with no bitter taste. We love it so much that I've signed up for the subscribe and save plan. Now it's only $17.11 for a pack of four. Again, this is as of 07/23/2011.

review/summary: Mmmm, Lavazza
review/text: I first tasted and loved Lavazza espresso during time in Italy, where it's popularly consumed. The rich aroma and full flavor are a delight, and I don't find it overly acidic (it's certainly MUCH easier on my stomach than American-style drip coffee, and this from someone with strong stomach and a love of all kinds of drip coffees). I haven't tasted the various Lavazza roasts extensively, but I typically buy and adore Crema e Gusto--in fact, I brew it *every* single morning I'm at home and drink it latte-style, at about a 2:1 warmed-milk to hot-espresso ratio.<br /><br />I heartily recommend buying an authentic Italian stovetop coffeemaker to brew this espresso. I have and love the Bialetti six-cup caffettiere (Bialetti 6800 Moka Express 6-Cup Stovetop Espresso Maker, found here on Amazon). It's what the typical Italian family uses every morning and throughout the day.<br /><br />The Lavazza vacuum packs are sturdy and small little bricks that store easily, and every time I snip open a new container the distinctive, warm aroma rush fills my kitchen. Mmmm, Lavazza.

review/summary: deeply satisfying
review/text: I needed to find a grind and roast that would fit my need for the taste I was used to with my home espresso machine, a high end Illy that broke and left me after 10 years of service! I went low tech and bought a Bialetti stainless steel 4 cup model with a valve system that creates foam and great crema. The Lavazza crema e gusto ground coffee works perfectly in this pot, only takes a few minutes to brew and the taste is wonderful, full bodied, rich and with no bitterness. For me, it lingers with a bit of smokiness and overtone of dark chocolate. Sometimes I place a very thin 99% cocoa square on the back of my tongue if I'm drinking this coffee later in the day and have a craving for something. It can distract me from many other more caloric choices!

review/text: Yes i did say drip. I have now tried 2 different lavazza brands. This is the better of the two but do not discount the other as i love it equally. I will continue to buy both as i love the occasional change up. If you use this in a drip coffee pot i would suggest staring out with using just over half of the normal amount you usually use then move on from there. With other brands including starbucks i would use 1 - 1.5 scoops per cup. So in my 5 cup maker depending on what taste i was going after i would use up to 8 scoops. With both lavazza coffees i have found 3-3.5 scoops is ideal in my 5 cup maker. It takes a few times to get it in your head that so much less coffee works but it does.

review/summary: Trust the reviews!
review/text: I read the reviews and went for it.  Having little experience with the brand, I was nervous about trying it. But, I really wanted a better espresso that my husband and I had available.  Starbucks was acceptable, but not great and grocery store brands were laughable.<br /><br />I am so glad I trusted the reviews!! Six months later, we don't drink anything else now and have no desire to pay someone else to make a sub-par cup o' joe. The flavor of Lavazza is strong, full, and without bitterness.<br /><br />If you're on the fence - go for it.  It was totally worth the chance we took.

review/summary: No prob with french press, very tasty!!
review/text: I bought it after the great reviews. Instead of buying the bialetti for the stovetop, I used my bodum french press despite of it being too fine ground. 2 Cups of hot microwaved water (getto style haha) with 1.5 scoop of coffee is perfect for me. Despite of it being very bold with the crema on top, I'm surprised that it doesn't taste bitter and sour at all! I added a bit of french vanilla, VERY TASTY! Get the individual brick if you're still not sure (sold by LaPrima Shops for $7.49)<br /><br />Try it, you'll love it!

review/text: I am from Italy and I came to the US a couple of weeks ago (I will stay here for  a year). I am really sorry but I have to say that for my taste american coffee is a kind of "watered down" soft drink. Thus, I brought my espresso machine with me and I am so happy that Amazon is selling this italian coffee. I really love it and I will definitely order this product again: it is italian coffee, good price and extremely fast shipping. What more could you ask for?

review/text: For the longest time I've been looking for something that compares to Illy espresso (medium roast) at a lower price. Thought this was a deal as I've been paying $14+ per can of Illy. I read all the hype & tried to order via Amazon only to be told they will NOT ship this product to Hawaii.I found the Crema e Gusto somewhere else for less than $9/pack; sadly, I was disappointed with the slightly bitter undertone and will most likely go back to Illy. Any Illy addicts out there who found something as good at a lower price?

review/summary: Terrific Coffee: So-So Packaging
review/text: I received my order of four (4) packs of this coffee yesterday and today, upon opening the bricks that were shrink-wrapped together, I noticed that one of the individual packages was clearly not vacuum sealed.  Sure enough, at the bottom of the package, I could see a slice from what was most likely a straight razor used to open a box.  Hmm...out with that package.  (I should add that the shipping box was was in perfect condition.)<br /><br />Understandably, this type of thing can happen with packaging / stocking.  Still, I'm a little disappointed that on my first order, only 3 out of 4 packages are any good.

review/text: I tried to learn to like the taste, but it did not happen, no matter how hard I tried.  The coffee has a strange aroma and after taste (like some sort of a strong chemical), and I have been drinking Italian espressos all my life.  After I ran out of the 4 bricks, I also stopped getting the runs and stomach pains every morning.  No more rushing to the toilet after breakfast!  I initially believed I was beginning to have unknown health problems, but after quitting this coffee, I realized that my health was fine.  For some reason it worked out terribly for me.  Espresso drinking has always been a ritual of delight for me.  Aroma, color, taste, and the feel-good-effect after drinking the coffee should all combine to bring forth a unique moment of goodness.

review/text: Unfortunately, I haven't found anything I can make this coffee in where the filter doesn't become instantly clogged.<br /><br />The filter on my French press is quite tolerant being a decent model but the grinds still get through the filter quite excessively.<br /><br />With a drip coffee maker, a permanent gold filter has no chance, as the fine grind blocks the filter and quickly causes the coffee maker to overflow. Paper filters are even worse, clogging up almost instantly.<br /><br />I'll end up giving it away since I can't actually make a good batch without excessive messes.

In comparison to Cafe Bustelo, which has a boring, but tolerable strong dark roast espresso flavor, Lavazza espresso has a more unique, rich syrupy flavor.<br /><br />However, if I compare Lavazza to the beans that I bought at Four Barrel in San Francisco last week, Lavazza's flavor seems pretty boring. I give it 4 stars because it is a great deal for the price and has good flavor.

review/summary: a miracle for my little girl!
review/text: All of a sudden my 11 1/2 yr old beagle started acting strange at night, pacing around, not sleeping, not wanting affection when she always wanted to be by us and snuggle before. Based on what I could find online I thought she was getting doggie Alzheimer's and I was scared. My boyfriend got this at a healthfood store and we started giving her 4 drops 2x a day (once with dinner and once at bedtime; she is approx 22 lbs). Right away there was a difference. She started sleeping through the night and seemed much more relaxed and herself. After only a few days she was snuggling again! I find it's easiest to mix in with food rather than in the water bowl so I can control how much she takes, plus we have 2 dogs and the other one doesn't need it. At bedtime I give them some unsweetened applesauce which they love and I just put her drops in that. This is a great price compared to the smaller size we got at the healthfood store, and I received my order earlier than expected. I definitely recommend this!

review/summary: Calm Cats
review/text: We moved our cats out of state two years ago and the drive took three days. One of our cats had a panic attack every hour or so. Neither cat would eat/drink/go to the bathroom the entire day--they would wait until they after they got adjusted to the hotel at night. We moved out of state again about a month ago with our two cats. We added Bach's Herbal Rescue Remedy for pets to their water every day a week prior, during, and after our move until they got adjusted to their new home.<br /><br />The difference between our first trip two years ago and now was like night and day. They were both laid back (not comotose-which, I understand, can happen from medications) and panic attacks were significantly reduced (if not entirely absent--it really was a smooth uneventful drive). They still didn't eat/drink/go to the bathroom until they got to the hotel but they would adjust much quicker. And, whereas two years ago they took three months to fully adjust to the move, they took no more than three days to adjust to their new surroundings this time around.<br /><br />I cannot say with certainty that Bach's Rescue Remedy "caused" them to be more calm; this was not a controlled experiment, it was their second interstate move, they stayed at "Grandma and Grandpa's" house while the packing was done wheras before they witnessed all our stuff being boxed up (which might have freaked them out), etc. However, I certainly think Bach's Rescue Remedy had something to do with putting them at ease the second time around. [Note: we tried Feliway (both the spray and the plug-in product) and it didn't help calm the at all.]

review/text: I was advised by a friend to use this product for my two dogs who began fighting with one another very frequently and out of the blue.  It wasn't a playful fight either.  Within about two weeks, they stopped fighting all together.<br /><br />I received the product quicker than anticipated too!<br /><br />This product gets 10 stars from me!!! :)

review/summary: Doggie Ritalin
review/text: The joke in the house is, this product is doggie Ritalin.  It's not a miracle remedy, but it does seem to serve a purpose.<br /><br />I have a black lab mix, who was rescued from a shelter, and bounced around quite a bit before finding a home with us.  His exact age is unknown, but the vet estimates about a year, to a year and a half.  He has severe separation anxiety that is most noticeable when someone leaves the house, or when he is taken somewhere in the car (he loves the dog park, but he is an absolute wreck in the car, getting there).<br /><br />If I'm home watching a baseball game, he paces the house non stop, whining the whole time.  The vet has given him a clean bill of health, but without fully knowing what he may have been through before he got to me, there's no telling what the cause of his anxiety is, or how long it will last.<br /><br />I tried Rescue Remedy at the suggestion of a friend, and ran it by my vet who told me he would use it sparingly, and also that he's not positive it isn't just a placebo of some sort.  For my dog, it seems to make a difference.<br /><br />The difference isn't huge:  While on it, instead of pacing the house constantly, he will sit or lay down by me to be pet.  None the less, that only lasts 5 to 10 minutes before he will go pace the house, but after a lap or two, he returns.  His whining occurs at about 1/10 of it's normal, constant, occurrence.<br /><br />In the car, the difference is more minimal.  He still paces the back seat the whole time, but the whining seems about half as frequent.  When someone leaves, the whining is still heard through the door, and nothing seems to have changed.  Perhaps the separation anxiety is too much for Rescue Remedy to overcome, but when someone is present in the house with him, there is a noticeable difference.  I'll continue to use the product until he's a little older, and hopefully it will no longer be necessary.

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: My parents have an Australian Shepherd that is very nervous during storms.  She is not a barker or a hider, but rather she paces endlessly, drooling, quivering, and whining.  She is completely inconsolable.<br /><br />Now, we give her the recommended four drops when a storm is blowing up, and she acts like her normal self!<br />I would never have believed it without seeing the results with my own eyes.<br /><br />Great product!!  Amazing results!

review/summary: Didn't see any change
review/text: I read that this was a miracle cure for canine anxiety.  I'm afraid that, when used on my dog, I saw absolutely no change come over him.  He was still anxious and nervous as ever.  Still, I will finish it, adding it to his water and using it with other calming procedures in hopes of finding the right combination.

review/summary: Use it on my dog
review/text: My dog is TERRIFIED of thunderstorms, complete with panting, massive trembling, and climbing on my head.  When I give him this it helps to calm him down, not 100%, but enough so that he is not trembling and panting and climbing on my head.  He is still aware the storms are going on, but I can at least get through the night without the whole bead shaking from his panting.

review/summary: Seems to work!
review/text: This product seems to work on my two cats.  I just moved across country and they are still a little scared (it's been about a month).  I have felaway plugged into the walls, but the vet also recommended this.  I put it on their noses every once in a while and they are extremely playful and running around. However, I did notice one time that I used it, my male cat's heartrate seemed to be higher than normal.  The vet says its completely safe, but I'll only use it when I'm around.  This is also good to use when company comes over, they are not as stressed out and actually come out!

review/summary: Great product
review/text: We have a two year old female kitty who was feral.  We rescued her at about four months of age.  She is extremely nervous about any changes in her routine and particularly about having any strangers in the house.  The doorbell terrifies her.  We started using Bach's Rescue Remedy about a year ago and I really do think that it has helped to calm her down a bit.  I put four drops in her wet food three times a week.  It must actually taste good to her and she seems not to notice at all that it is there.<br /><br />Be certain that you get the Bach's Rescue Remedy for Pets as it is the only one that does not contain alcohol.

review/summary: Didn't work for my cat
review/text: This didn't work for my over anxious kitty.  I tried it about four seperate time and did not notice any real changes in her demeanor.  I even tried various doses and no change.  I am disappointed but at least I didn't spend much money. I am going to try Feliway next and see if that helps.
