review/summary: Pretty good taste; goes a long way
review/text: Contains both sugar and sucralose (Splenda), which leaves me a bit of an aftertaste. (Your mileage may vary.) Everyone else in the family likes it -- pretty good root beer taste. We don't have a "SodaStream" carbonator, but just use plain old carbonated or sparkling water to mix it. A little goes a long way, making it cheaper than most alternatives.

review/summary: Energy Drink vs Red Bull
review/text: I love this product.  I've heard alot about the Sodastream and finally decided to purchase one, and as I drink a lot of Red Bull (mainly as a cocktail mixer), I gave this mix a try.  Quite impressed on just how I can't really tell the difference between this Energy Drink Sodamix and Red Bull, other than the price.  On average I spend about $2.25 per can of Red Bull, and this Sodamix will yield 50 8oz servings, so easy math says $112 for 50 cans of Red Bull or $6.99 for the Sodastream Energy Drink Sodamix 16.9 Fl oz bottle and 50 8oz servings.  And as not to be biased, I have a few friends who also drink Red Bull who all agreed that it was a toss up on tasting the difference between the two products, and how much money could be saved.

review/summary: Redbull?
review/text: Someone said that it tasted like a Sprite. No it doesn't to me. Not even close in my opinion. It's a Energy Drink. It tastes more like Redbull but with a less tart flavor. I couldn't taste any after taste so that was a plus. Even if it does have Splenda in it, I don't even taste that and I don't like Splenda. It isn't my favorite flavor as I am not a fan of Redbull, but if you do then this syrup just may be for you.<br /><br />*EDIT* I just realized when I wrote that it does not taste like a Sprite the person was commenting about the Lemon Lime syrup. I apologize about that.

review/summary: Diet Flavors are Not Great - Nasty Aftertaste
review/text: I absolutely love my Sodastream because I drink a lot of sparkling water and this has saved me a fortune! Recently I thought it would be great to have some of the soda flavorings around for guests, mixed drinks, etc. However, I have not been thrilled with diet flavors I have tried so far. Of the three I have tried (diet tonic, diet ginger ale, and diet root beer), I think the diet root beer is the best, but is not even close to any of the name brand diet root beers.  Both the diet ginger ale and diet tonic have a nasty aftertaste - way worse than any name brand diet soda on the market.  The worst part about the aftertaste is that it doesn't seem to go away. As I write this, I still have a bad taste in my mouth - and it's been nearly a half hour since I drank some of the diet ginger ale. That alone compelled me to pull out my computer and log a review. I have tried them several times now, altering the amount of syrup to see if it would make a difference, and each time I end up pouring it down the drain. I am SO disappointed by this as I had high hopes for flavorings.

review/summary: Win some, lose some
review/text: I recently received a soda stream, and have been playing around with the flavors. What I find is that everyone has their own amount of syrup they like added to the bottle. For example, with the cream soda I had to use about half the recommended amount, but with the diet root beer I like to add more mix. The real thing with these flavors - you just have to try them. I really like the diet cranberry, diet grapefruit and the diet root beer is literally the best soda I've ever had - diet or non-diet. Some others I didn't like so much. The cola didn't really do it for me, and I'm on the fence over the ginger ale. There is a bit of an after taste on the sodas, but they do have a lower calorie count (even the non-diets) than regular sodas. All in all I like the soda stream, it's fun, but I still buy Coke and some other sodas. I am looking forward to trying some more of the exotic soda stream flavors (BBB has almost all of them in stock) and playing with making my own.<br /><br />3 stars because... well, win some, lose some with the flavors. It's all subject to taste.

review/text: This is fabulous. Heard about it on Sean Hannity and wanted to try it. My wife bought it for me as an early Christmas present. The set up and operation is super simple. To me the taste is excellent because it is so fresh. I like Polar sodas and those work out to about $.98 a liter. This does $.67 a liter. The diet cola does not have the classic metal taste and no aspartame. If you love diet soda you will love this. If you don't, you will leave a poor review. I thought it would taste like a cheap store brand diet cola, and it is so much better than that. It reminded me of Coke Classic.

review/summary: Diet drinks taste like diet soda from the old days
review/text: I got a SodaStream for my birthday.  It comes with a 12 pack syrup sampler with 6 diet syrups and 6 "regular" syrups.  I have only tried the diet, caffeine-free syrups.  None of them come close to tasting anything as good as the diet drinks I buy at the grocery store.  Even the store brands taste better than the SodaStream diet drinks.  They remind me of the pre-Nutrasweet sodas that used saccharine as the sweetener.  I use my Soda Stream to make seltzer and it does a great job at that!  I've been experimenting with using drink mixes like Crystal Light, and those work OK.  DISCLAIMER:  I'm one of the folks who get a bad aftertaste with Splenda and Splenda is the sweetener used in the diet SodaStream drink syrups.

review/text: Of the Sodastream syrups, this is my favorite.  Unlike the other flavors, which are very often poor remakes of classic brands, the orange flavor is unique. It has qualities of Orange Crush and Sunkist, but adds an original flavor that only it has.  Overall, it is a great flavor, and even pop snobs will likely enjoy it.  If you can't live without the classics, any flavor (including Orange) is not worth buying though, so be cautious, and try buying one instead of a three pack the first time.

review/summary: Regular Cola has Artificial Sweetener
review/text: I bought the regular cola flavor to give it a try, but after tasting it, I realized that it had artificial sweetener. I didn't think to read the ingredients before buying, since it wasn't diet. Not sure why they did that, since the first ingredient is SUGAR. I can't give it a good rating, as I stay away from artificial sweeteners and I feel that they were a bit deceptive by not making the fact that it contains artificial sweeteners more noticeable. I don't drink cola every day (maybe once a week or less) and I feel that sugar is OK in moderation.

review/text: I have the SodaStream and love it. I am a diet soda drinker and love all the varieties of flavors my local retailer carries. My favorite is the pink grapefruit. I came on Amazon expecting to find a deal and was shocked at the price some people are selling the flavor syrup for. HIGHWAY ROBBERY! These can be purchased for $3.99 - $4.99 (Bed Bath and Beyond, Kohls)for single bottles . I thought maybe this was the price for a double pack, but doesn't appear to be. At this price, this machine would not be very cost effective now would it?

review/text: The other reviews are correct in the fact that the "suggested" retail price is $4.99 per bottle.  Some sellers are ripping the consumers off by pricing them higher.  As always... caveat emptor!<br /><br />The Ginger Ale syrup is very good in my opinion.  It is very close to Canada Dry's Ginger Ale in crispness and tartness.<br /><br />I use the "three buzz" carbonation method and then fill the syrup cap to the line in the cap about a 1/2" from the top of the filler.  This creates the perfect syrup to carbonation ratio and makes a very drinkable and tasty ginger ale!

It' is 1/3 the price per serving of store bought soda, 1/2 the caffeine, 1/3 the sugar and calories, but it still tastes amazing. And we don't have bags and bags of recycling, and we can make whatever soda we want when we want. At this price, it's basically just buying 3 cases of soda on sale... what's the point??? When you can order it online from ANYWHERE ELSE for half the price, this is just absurd. Please just search for it, you'll find a better price in about 10 seconds.

review/summary: Aftertaste
review/text: I bought the Sodastream after just looking at it for a while.  Then, decided to try it as I remember drinking "fizzies" many years ago and was shooting for that effect.  Sodastream does indeed add great fizz but beware the aftertaste.  I tried the orange and thought, while I was drinking it, that it was terrific.  But, then, for more than a day, I had an aftertaste like some of the diet drinks leave.  Same with the Root Beer.  And, even though the machine says add carbonation only to water and then add syrup, I decided to try adding carbonation to my own drinks, like Kool-Aid or Hawaiian Punch.  Other than being careful with the carbonation and making sure to clean the CO2 port afterward, it works very well.  However, even with my own drinks I still get the terrible aftertaste.  That part is very disappointing.  Not sure if that can even be removed.  Is it the carbonation itself?  Regular carbonated drinks do not have it.

So I said to myself hey I can buy soda water in my store for 88 cents per 2 liters and the syrup makes 6 or so liters per bottle depending on how strong you want the taste I buy the energy mix 2 or 3 bottles at a time and it lasts me about a month I still buy other soda buy much less and no more paying 3 bucks a can for red bull,oh side note if you are into jager bombs and so are your party friends buy a bottle of this and some soda water bottle of jager and have fun in my opinion it tastes better than real red bull

review/text: Ive heard many reviews about Sodastream: most bad, a few OK. I understand that Sodastream sodas cant taste exactly like regular soda so im not expecting them to taste exact. With that said Im pretty pleased with or am OK with most of the flavors that ive tried. Bellow are my reviews of a few.<br /><br />Cola: 5/5 stars Doesnt taste exactly like Coke but is close. One of my favorites.<br /><br />Orange: 5/5 stars If youve tried different brands of Orange soda you will notice that some taste better than others. This tastes like cheaper dollar store orange soda, so is similar to Sunkist, but it still tastes pretty good & does taste like a known orange soda.<br /><br />Lemon Lime (Sprite): 4/5 Tastes like Sprite at first but leaves an odd after taste. Ive noticed that if you open your mouth after each drink the after taste is minimal. If it werent for the after taste I would give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Cranberry Raspberry: 5/5 Not sure what to compare it to, but it tastes great with no weird after flavor.<br /><br />Energy: 5/5 This came in the trial pack, & since im not into energy drinks I sipped it & had a friend try it. It gets 5 stars because it tastes just like Red Bull according to both of us.<br /><br />Dr. Pete: 3/5 Its OK but it tastes pretty vanillaish & not all that close to Dr. Pepper. You can sort of taste the similarity but not enough to say "WOW! JUST like or very similar to Dr. Pepper!!!".<br /><br />Overall Im still a big Sodastream fan, & most of the flavors ive tried I would buy again.

review/summary: The ENERGY drink is the only one I can tolerate, and I love that one!
review/text: We got a Sodastream for Christmas. My kids have lots of fun making soda, and for them it's really become a passed-fad already and it's only July. For myself though, I think all of the sodas are totally gross except for the Energy drink one. They all have this creepy flavor, I'm not sure what exactly it is?  You know how Coke tastes great, and Walmart  Cola tastes okay, if you had to drink it instead of Coke you would live, right? Well these soda flavors are like three notches below the generic sodas at the store. Like I mentioned, they all have some weird flavor.<br /><br />Except the Energy drink. WOW, if you like Red Bull, then you are going to LOVE LOVE LOVE this. It's like the flavor of Red Bull, bumped up ten times. Plus, I'd say it gives me more energy than Red Bull. Okay, not energy, but the shakes and the so-alert-I-may-explode feeling. It makes me so jittery, IF I drink a lot of it, that I can't think straight and my heart is pounding. If you like that, you'll love this.<br /><br />To me, I look for the Guarna (sp?) in energy drinks, and this has the absoute most guarna flavor of anything I've tried. I LOVE IT.

The soda stream device is a COMPLETE RIP OFF,But if you add up 50 cans of red bull the cost would be anywhere from $150-200 which pays for the cost on the machine and then some with the savings of buying this syrup. The purchase of the machine is worth it but only if you like the energy syrup, otherwise go to walmart and buy a two liter of regular pop for a buck.

review/summary: Some really great and some really really bad
review/text: Diet Cranberry Raspberry - The BEST flavor I've tried yet. It's just sweet enough, great flavor, and calorie free. I always have at least three bottles of this in my cabinet at all times.<br /><br />Orange - Very sweet but good. I'm not a fan of orange soda so that's probably the only reason I don't love this.<br /><br />Lemon-Lime - Again, very sweet. It has a good sprite-type flavor though so I went ahead and tried the diet version as well to see if that would be a staple in our house.<br /><br />Diet Lemon-Lime - It's not an all time favorite but it's good. I have a bottle of this usually for whenever I'm craving something different or something a bit more refreshing and I'm tired of plain water.<br /><br />Cream Soda - WAY too strong. I love cream soda and so I didn't expect any issues with it but just the smell when opening the bottle was enough to make me slightly sick to my stomach. And I'm not exaggerating. I actually threw out the entire bottle after one sip. It has an almost alcoholish undertone to it that doesn't help at all. Gross.<br /><br />Root Beer - Not even close to as bad as the cream soda but slightly reminiscent. I did drink the entire sample that came with the Sodastream but do not plan to buy a bottle of it even though I am a huge fan of root beer.<br /><br />Cola - I bought this to act as an emergency back up for when my husband wanted a rum and coke and didn't have any coke in the house. It tastes a bit like off-brand diet cola to me, probably because of the Splenda. This is very off-putting only because there is so many calories in this and you don't even get a calorie-laden taste. Hahaha. This will continue to be held for those emergencies but we won't be drinking it by itself at all.<br /><br />Grape - This one actually surprised me because I was so prepared not to like it. It's a bit on the sweet side but still much better than many others. I've been putting about 1/4th the amount of syrup in less than called for and it helps cut the sweetness a bit but after that it starts to make the flavor taste watered down. I wish I could find a diet version of this. Not sure if it exists or not but I can't find it on Amazon if it does.<br /><br />I'll update this as I try more. I am cautiously optimistic about the diet ginger ale so that will be my next purchase.

review/summary: A fairly "meh" generic cola.
review/text: I love my Soda Stream, and most of the mixes I've used have been quite good (pretty much any of their fruit flavors, their Dr. Pepper substitute,  Root Beer and Energy Drink have all been quite tasty), however the one flavor that really stands out as a disappointment is the cola flavor. I can forgive the fact that it doesn't taste like Coke or Pepsi-- I have tried other "b-list" colas that tasted good in their own way-- however, this one is overall just plain bland. It's not sweet enough, and it lacks the "kick" that I expect from a cola. I tried making the most of it by adding additional ingredients-- once I used vanilla, and it made the soda even more bland. The other time i used some cheap whisky my room mate bought, and it was probably the nastiest mixed drink I've ever had (I'm not a heavy drinker though, keep in mind, and I blame the crappy alcohol more than the soda for that one).<br /><br />I have not explored other options for cola syrups yet, but this is one I don't expect I'll be buying again unless they change the formula. I'm pretty sure there's got to be a better option out there that does not involve spending $150 on a 5 gallon bag of Coca Cola syrup (which would have the high fructose corn syrup that I've been trying to avoid anyway).

review/text: We love our SodaStream and have found several of the mixes we like including the Root Beer.  It is not as good as A&W root beer but it makes a great root beer float.  It does not taste overly sweet, nor does it leave you with a chemical after taste.  Plus it is nice that you can control how much syrup you add to play with the flavor a bit.  I would recommend at least trying this syrup and definately use it for a root beer float!

review/summary: With a little doctoring, very good
review/text: This is better than diet but falls short of brand name cola taste.  I feel the cola flavor is a little "spicy" and not fruity enough. I tried a few mixin's and now I think it is great.  If it came as good as I can mix it, I would give it five stars.  If you decide to try this product, get some True Lemon or Lime, True Orange, stevia packets (with a high level, 90% or better, of steviosides for cleaner,sweeter flavor, and a bottle of cherry snow cone syrup if you like cherry cola.  I use a half packet of lemon and Orange, 1 packet of stevia, and a short squirt of cherry per liter bottle. Now the flavor falls between generic and brand name.  Cheaper than using cans, but not cheaper than using two liter bottles.  The calorie count is about a third of normal cola.  You have to be comfortable with Splenda and Ace-K as Soda Stream uses those to offset some of the sugar (not corn Syrup a plus).  Thankfully no Nutrasweet/aspartame as I get terrible headaches from that.

review/text: I chose the diet soda. Notice that the total amount of the product is not written. I was perplexed at first, but then discerned that the product image clearly says 750ml. So at $8.39 it seemed to be a decent price. However what I received was a 500ml bottle. Not worth the hassle of returning for a couple of bucks, but an annoyance none the less. So beware when you purchase. I suggest you assume that you will receive a 500ml bottle.

review/text: First thing, this does give you energy just like an energy drink. It also tastes very similar to Redbull. When I burp, it has the similar energy drink belch smell that energy drinks have for some reason. The color is not quite the same as Redbull.<br /><br />But having said all that I still find this to be an excellent value when you compare the prices of Redbull vs this mixture. At the store, Redbulls are $1.99 where as this one costs maybe $0.40 after all is said and done (cost of carbonation, syrup, shipping charged on carbonation, etc). I made that number up in my head though, did not use a calculator or even really think mathmatically about it so it is pretty much a made up cost I pulled out of the air and doesn't represent anything truthfully.<br /><br />Anyhow, I know it is a much cheaper solution, I enjoy it and am drinking some now.

review/summary: Flavors from home and childhood
review/text: The sodastream has been a real help to my family we are currently serving overseas and while there is an abundance of coke here the other flavors of soda are shall we say lacking! Some are so bitter that they are not palatable to my family. Rootbeer is a favorite and the sodastream has it nearly perfect to the rootbeer my dad made when I was young! I think that a touch more syrup is necessary to reach the true rootbeer flavor so it gets one less use for my family than the bottle says and I think there is an underlying mint flavor that is not overwhelming or unwanted but a bit noticeable to me. I did not give it 4 stars because the items arrived dented and not packed as well as I would have liked to make the journey overseas not punctured but close. It was however shipped quickly and without delay. I have not tried the diet in any flavor other than cola and with  the significantly lower sugar count in the regular probably wont but wouldnt mind hearin how they are! Thanks for shipping to us folks overseas since the sodastream site will not and where they have international sites they will only ship the flavor varieties for each country! That doesnt help much for me!

review/summary: It's OK to drink the water in the can
review/text: It's OK to drink the water in these Del Monte French Style Green Beans cans because no salt has been added and lead has been banned from the canning process in the U.S.  In fact, according to the "Nutrition Facts and Analysis" website, the fluid in the can contains at least 20% of the nutritional value (vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants) of the entire can of green beans.  So drink the fluid inside the can as if it were a very healthy tea.  All beans are moderately high in antioxidants (and calories).  French Style Green Beans are slightly above average among beans in antioxidants and substantially below average among beans in calories.  Among beans, only soybeans, which are high in calories, are healthier for us to eat than these low-calorie green beans.  Eating 6 cans of green beans equals the same number of calories as eating 1 can of soybeans.  Like most modern varieties of green beans, there is no string in these French Style Green Beans.  When compared against Libby's French Style Green Beans (no salt added), Del Monte (this product) was just slightly firmer and just slightly better tasting inside the can.  But Libby's product is priced slightly lower than Del Monte's.  According to whfoods.com, green beans are moderately high in the carotenoids, beta-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, violaxanthin, and neoxanthin and in the polyphenols/bioflavonoids miquelianin, quercetin, kaempferol, catechins, epicatechins, and procyanidins and in the absorbable, bone-friendly mineral, silicon.

We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest."<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Teas for Creative Moods
review/text: Numi's tea sampler has a lot to offer if you enjoy mild teas. If you prefer stronger teas, then you may want to creatively mix and match for a new experience.<br /><br />Delicate Tea for Calm Mornings<br /><br />The Numi "Morning Rise," organic breakfast blend has elements of smooth perfection when blended with milk powder or cream. This tea has a mild dreamy flavor when using one teabag. You may want two if you prefer a stronger morning blend. If you are looking for an elegant tea, this blend of Fair Trade Certified Keemun, Darjeeling, Ceylon and Assam black tea is sure to impress. Morning Rise is a delicate tea that awakens you slowly to the day and seems to bring a new clarity to the mind.<br /><br />Dreamy Vanilla<br /><br />Numi teas are blended to an elegant perfection. Numi "Decaf Black Vanilla" is no exception and will please anyone who loves mild black tea with a hint of vanilla. For a richer experience, use two teabags per 8-ounce cup. This tea is perfect for drinking at night when you are relaxing, reading poetry or starting a new novel. The vanilla flavor is enhanced with a dash of cream or even an little vanilla syrup from France. I can recommend Rieme French Vanilla syrup or even a cane sugar to add a caramel twist.<br /><br />Delicate Ginger with hints of Anise<br /><br />Numi "Golden Chai" is a delicately spiced Assam black tea that I like to blend with the Numi "Chinese Breakfast" tea made with Yunnan black tea. Together they seem perfect and I like using two teabags per experience. This creates a flowery tea scented with anise and cardamom and spiced with cinnamon and ginger. If you like making chai with milk, heat some milk in a saucepan and then add one or two teabags. It is much more convenient than having to look around for all the separate ingredients and the spices and tea are perfectly blended.<br /><br />Afternoons in Africa<br /><br />Bushmen's Brew "Honeybush," "Jasmine Green Tea" and "White Nectar Osmanthus Spring" make a good combination for a honey/floral tea. Adding in a little honey enhances the experience. With this blend you can enjoy white tea with Osmanthus flowers, green tea with jasmine flowers and honeybush tea with a mild flavor. You may enjoy this as an ice tea in the summer.<br /><br />Lemon Iced Mint Tea<br /><br />Numi's "Gen Mai Cha" Toasted Rice Green, Simply Mint "Mooccan Herbal Teasan" and Rainforest Green "Mate Lemon Myrtle Green Tea" can be steeped together to create a delicious tea to pour over ice. Add honey while the tea is hot and lemon juice just before serving.<br /><br />The Lemon Iced Tea was the best experience of all the teas<br />and I can see myself buying a box of each tea so I can make<br />this tea again.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Great Yam Noodle!
review/text: These are my new favorite Shirataki Yam Noodles. They have a great texture and hold up very well. They are just as filling as House Foods' Tofu Shirataki, but they have 0 calories! Finally You make a great tasty sauce and enjoy it!<br /><br />My advice when cooking Shirataki noodles? If you're a first-timer, cut the bag over a strainer holding it upright. Do not take any deep breaths and breathe through your mouth. The liquid keeping the noodles doesn't smell good. Although I didn't smell JFC's, it might have been because of experience. Rinse the noodles thoroughly in cold water. Squeeze lemon juice over the noodles (it's a palette cleanser, so it helps rinse away any of the suspension liquid's flavor), and continue rinsing. Microwave the noodles on a paper towel for 2 minutes, or take the blow dryer to them. Make sure they are really dry. I like to microwave them with lemon, lime or a wasabi vinaigrette, depending on what type of food I am preparing to help the noodles start soaking up flavors.<br /><br />The noodles will absorb the flavors of whatever you cook them in, so depending on how long you cook the noodles in the sauce, they may or may not taste up to your standards. This is why I try to pre-flavor them unless they are going into soup.

review/summary: Quick and Simple
review/text: Shirataki Noodles are made from Konjac yams.  The noodles without tofu added is 0 calories.  Also, it has less than 1g of carbs per serving which is 3oz.  I have eaten Shirataki noodles many times before with the tofu added.  Today I got the JFC brand at The Hong Kong market here in Texas.  I made a quick soup with a vegan bouillon cube.  I rinsed the noodles then added it to the soup.  I had it on the stove for approx 1 minute.  The first time I ever made Shirataki Noodles I cooked it like regular pasta and it turned into a gel--this was years ago.  I learned that was the worst mistake to make and changed how I eat these noodles.  The next time I made it correctly and tried to eat it with pasta sauce.  That didn't work for me, the flavors did not merry and I was accustomed to the hard texture of pasta.  Furthermore, to get an idea, the noodles are similar to the texture of vermicelli rice noodles. The longest it should be put into boiling water is approx a minute or two so it can warm up.  I was afraid that these noodles will fall apart.  The tofu shirataki is definitely a harder texture which I like but I quickly found out the JFC white Shirataki noodles were nothing to be afraid of.  The product has no taste, so seasoning it will be helpful.  This product is perfect for me and I will continue using it.<br /><br />Update:<br />I did some more research on Shirataki noodles in order to expand my ideas with recipes.  I found that the reason that my shirataki noodles may have turned into mush was because it expired.  It seems Shirataki noodles is still good for a year and even after it is still edible however it would turn to mush if cooked too long.  These noodles also apparently shrink and become thinner, something it seems some people like.  As I mentioned above the first time I had the shirataki noodles was the tofu kind.  I went to the store that I used to get my Tofu Shirataki noodles, and looked at the for an expiration date.  Lo and behold, it was expired by over a year.  I even saw some in the store expired by over 2 years.  It seems that non expired shirataki noodles will become alot more chewy if cooked too long.  My mom used it in stir fry, and I have also tried it baked which is also a great idea.  I been lazy and not just use any boullion cube with the noodles and that works fine...I just let it sit in the seasoning for a few hours to take the flavor of the soup.

review/summary: Holy Grail for those tryin to lose weight!
review/text: I am a low carb diet and these noodles have been a Godsend. I went on the atkins before and lost sixty pounds and gained it all back once I ate carbs. Before I went without carbs cold turkey, but it unrealistic as I need to adapt this as a lifestyle (diabetes runs in my family, but I don't have it yet). I used this noodles in mostly asian dishes such as pad thai and beef and brocoli which both came out superb. I can really see the difference in how I feel after I eat them total energy and i defintely don't have the sluggish feeling after eating traditional carbs. Warning: the first time you eat these you may be running to the bathroom because of the high concentration of fiber. Today, I plan to use these with my traditional spagethetti with my low carb homemade sauce, and it should come out excellent as these noodles absorb any flavor you cook with. In my opinion, these are the noodles you start out with when you are trying to lose weight and once you get to your goal you can switch it up with tofu shirataki ( which have carbs but still very low in comparison to traditional) as it resembles traditional noodles with more shape varieties such as fettucini, macaroni,angel hair etc.<br /><br />UPDATE: The spaghetti came out wonderful and taste wise i could not tell the difference! THe texture will take some getting used to , but there now is absolutely no need to use traditional flour pasta anymore. When you get these noodles, just rinse for five minutes  to get rid of the seafood smell which really isn't that bad at all ,season and add to your favorite dish

review/summary: Not Bad
review/text: First off you can buy them a lot cheaper at your local Asian grocer.  Rinse them for several minutes then pat dry, I throw mine in a frying pan to "dry" them out before I use them.  Yes they smell but don't stick your nose in the bag.  I like to eat mine with a chicken bouillon cube mixed in or with a tsp. garlic chili sauce or mixed with a light cow swiss cheese.  I'm allergic to wheat and trying to lose weight so this is a good low calorie option. Don't be scared of the smell I was at first but I got over it.

review/summary: Great product, terrible price.
review/text: These noodles have no calories. Quite a bit is written about how terrible they smell. Frankly, it is true. However, it is easily dealt with. I open up the bag, drain the noodles in a strainer, and continue to soak the noodles in warm water from the tap for some 30 minutes or so. They are great for use in soups. They also work well in any situation where there will be a strongly flavored sauce. They do not tend to take up the taste of the sauce they are cooked in. To be quite honest, if I had a choice between these and the regular Vietnamese rice noodle I would certainly eat the regular Vietnamese noodle however the calories and carbohydrates are not workable for me. The fact that these have insignificant calories and carbohydrates trumps any minor problems I have with taste and texture.<br /><br />You should be aware that these are available from local stores for quite a bit less. I bought 20 bags of these yesterday from my local Asian store in a small to medium town for 2 dollars and 15 cents per bag.

I rinsed them several times, but they still had a fishy smell.  They also did NOT absorb the flavor of the sauce I cooked them in, as I had read they would do.  Ate about 3 forkfuls, then threw the rest in the trash.

I couldn't help gag from the stench of these noodles. You can rinse them, but it makes me wonder why on earth these noodles smell so bad in the first place. If whatever is in these noodles is making this smell, (like chemicals), I don't want these in my body. These things must be bad because they don't even sell them anymore from this company.

review/summary: I Think They're Great
review/text: I was surprised to see so many negative reviews about these seeds. I think they are one of the best flavors! Taste is very subjective so it's one of those things where you just have to try them for yourself to see if you like it. Don't relyon 0ther's sense of taste to define yours! If you've tried the jalapeno hot salsa version, these are similar. It's very hard to find these at stores around me so I'm happy to find them on Amazon.<br />Outside of the taste, the David brand typically has very good quality seeds. Rarely do you find stems or bad seeds and the jumbo versions are just plain awesome. After you've been eating the jumbo versions for a awhile, it's tough to go back to the regular sized seeds.

They taste like they've been washed in Dial soap, which is emphasized and highlighted by the jalepe&ntilde;o flavoring.<br /><br />I know this because I've had my mouth washed out before as a kid.<br /><br />The David Buffalo Ranch flavored seeds also have that strange and repulsive chemical taste, but not as pronounced as these hot flavored ones.<br /><br />Stick to the Frito Lay seeds. They might not be jumbo, but they don't taste like they were made in Detroit.<br /><br />P.S. baseball players chew too, but that don't make it appropriate, or a baseball player an authority by any stretch of the imagination. But good for you, you baseball player you.

I'll agree the taste is unusual, but it's a good unusual taste. Plus the seeds are larger so you can't go wrong there. I've been eating sunflower seeds for about 20 years now and have tried all different brands and flavors. These are some of the best seeds I've ever had! Just make sure you have plenty of water around as they will tend to dry out the mouth after a while.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent bag of seeds. Highly recommended!

review/summary: Perfect portion size
review/text: Daybreak Blend is perfect portion control.  I could eat trail mix or granola all day so it's great to have a size that is big enough to satisfy and keep you from opening a second!  180 calories is right in the range I like when a light snack is in order and if I need more I throw it on some yogurt for a bigger snack.<br /><br />The flavor is great with a high percentage of nuts and raisins.  It is a little on the sweet side, but it is really tasty.  Great right out of the bag or with milk or yogurt.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Someone's shipping OLD product.
review/text: This would be good, if it didn't arrive stale, with only 60 days before expiration. It tastes rancid, like flour or rice that's gotten too old. Even yogurt doesn't hide the wet cardboard taste.<br /><br />FRESH product is probably fine, but this stinks (literally!).

review/summary: These syrups are very special and beautifully crafted
review/text: The Amoretti syrups are extraordinary. Thinking I could duplicate the Starbucks green tea frappe with a melon syrup I first ordered the honeydew flavor -- which is exquisite. Next I tried vanilla and hazelnut and these are wonderful too. The catalog has me thinking all sorts of ambitious thoughts about creating new recipes....Anyone who loves to experiment with syrups should buy these. The Amoretti products are far beyond any flavored syrups I have used before. The quality and crafting are evident, and they come in beautiful bottles....

review/summary: Highest quality syrup around, makes excellent SB Green Tea Frapps!!
review/text: This is my second purchase of Amoretti Honeydew Melon syrup. Their customer service is above and beyond, I would not hesitate to do business with them again. The Honeydew Melon syrup is of very high quality and has a nice vescocity to, it is not watered down like many other brands. It has a crisp, clean taste and works perfectly to make Starbucks Green Tea Frapps at home! We love this stuff and will surely be purchasing more through Amoretti when needed. If you are wondering if it is worth your purchase, no need to worry as it is truly worth the nominal price they charge. It comes wonderfully packaged in a nice clear box with it's own pump for easy dispensing. The bottle itself is very attractive, and it is all well wrapped to ensure safety during shipping. All I can say is everything all around is high quality from this company. They do not scimp on their products or their desire to provide the best customer service.

review/summary: Just as I thought, awesome.
review/text: Youtubers from England and the parts of America I have never been to have raved about these Wine Gums for quite awhile but only now did I take it upon myself to buy a few and try them out.  Not only were they delicious, they were also sent quicker than I expected and were very good quality, the package was wrapped efficiently and the rolls themselves were bigger than I expected. I would definitely suggest that others buy from Maynard's if they also like awesome, good quality candy.

review/summary: delicious-my kitties told me so
review/text: not really sure how i can review a product i can't taste, so i'll go by my cats reaction to this. i have 2 good eaters and one fusspot!. well, now miss fusspot jumps on the counter while i'm opening the cans and i have to feed her first! she has turned into a total pig!. i'm hooked on the stuff. I order several different flavors to give them some variety. I will also say that when I adopted my fatty 21 pounder, i tried for years to get him to lose weight. Recently the vet told me he lost 5 pounds! (that's like 50 pounds in humans) and I will honestly say the pounds didn't come off until I started feeding him this stuff. I gave him high quality dry food, pure tuna (pet food) from TJs and nothing worked. until this.<br />And the price is right! I'm hooked.

review/summary: A quality food cats love
review/text: All of my cats like this food, including the two that generally only eat wet food if it's tuna. It is a tightly packed food and you can definitely spot the big chunks of sardine among the chicken.<br />And it is a good value as far as quality, natural cat food goes. It is made with human-grade ingredients and no byproducts or fillers. I want to try more varieties of Natural Value to add to my cats' diet.

review/summary: Cats did not enjoy it
review/text: I have two cats. One refused to eat this brand outright and the other eats it begrudgingly. Although it's a great value for natural ingredients, it's not worth the money as I had to throw out the leftovers every day.

review/summary: Delicious Quickbread and muffin mix
review/text: This is a delicious gluten-free bread and muffin mix; it is also free of potato and polysorbate.  No one would guess is gluten-free! I feel most oils are a more nutritious alternative to dairy-free margine, so I always use a different oil (walnut, almond, grapeseed, etc) and they all turn out delicious. I also substitute different sweeteners for the sugar such as maple syrup, honey, yacon syrup, date sugar, and coconut sugar and have been consistently very pleased. The bag also offers variations to make the following breads/muffins:  poppy see, blueberry, berry, zucchini, apple, banana bread, pumpkin, dried cranberry apple, carrot raisin, streusel, tropical, and chocolate chunk.<br /><br />The following information is from manufacturer's website and was missing on this webpage before I posted it in my review:  Create-Your-Own Quick Bread & Muffin Mix-NEW Net Wt. 14.75 oz (418 G)UPC 833330001184<br />MIX IS NOT PRE-SWEETENED<br />Description: vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg flavored mix.
