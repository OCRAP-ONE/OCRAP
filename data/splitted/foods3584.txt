review/summary: Easy on you
review/text: This is a very silky feeling water.  I had to take a lot of medication and continue to since an automobile accident.  One of my medications really did a number on my stomach lining which in turn creates a lot of acid reflux on a normal day to day basis.  So I thought giving alkaline a try couldn't hurt.  And it most certainly did not hurt.  It was nice not to have to take meds before and after meals. I was down to just one acid reflux pill a day.  Normally I end up taking one a hour before every meal and possibly one or two after meals.  I just took one in the evening and that was a nice change of pace.<br /><br />I would certainly buy this again.  Other members of my family liked the texture of the water too.  I sort of wish we could get in our five gallon jugs for the water cooler.

review/text: Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water, 1.5 Liter, (Pack of 12)<br /><br />This is a difficult thing to review. It's bottled water. There are some basics to consider. How does it taste, well, like water. Clean, crisp, refreshing, water. Essentia does that very well, no faults at all. The bottle has a description on it as "A difference you can taste." This  can be true, but I've been drinking different bottled waters over the years and I must say there is a smoothness that I do notice. It kind of reminds me of my youth in summer camp in the Pocono Mountains of PA. There was a stream that was fed by a rubber pipe in the ground. This has that heavy smooth cold taste that I always remembered. Nothing before, has reminded me of that experience. Am I imagining it, I don't think so. It really is different.<br /><br />I like the water very much. I was only given one bottle to evaluate. I can't talk to any long term benefits of the pH or electrolytes that are in the water. It's very good water and I'll leave it to you if the price is worth it to you. Cheers!

review/summary: alkaline water in a plastic bottle
review/text: One of the more widely marketed health aids in recent years has been alkalized water - Kangen and other companies have been selling devices to create alkaline water and sharing stories of amazing health benefits in those who consume this type of water. Those units can be very expensive, so if you wish to try this type of water for a while to see how it is for you without investing in a special system then Essentia's 9.5 pH water may be a good option. It tastes fine and is good for hydration and electrolytes, though you could take regular purified water and add some minerals and lemon or vegetable juice for similar benefits. Since it comes in a plastic bottle you'll want to keep it cool so that heat doesn't make the water absorb plastic chemicals. If you are getting bottled water this is a pretty good option, though to be more eco-conscious you may wish to invest in your own water purification and pH control system to avoid the plastics.

review/summary: Tastes like water to me...
review/text: My son and I recently decided to go up on a nice hike to one of the local caves. The forest service recommended bringing at least 32 ounces per person. This bottle of Essentia looked like a good way for us to bring the recommended amount, and yet still have some left over. Needless to say, after climbing over 1000 ft in a mile and a half, we found ourselves glad we had this product. It touts having lots of essential vitamins, etc to help you with such situations. I'm not sure if it really made that big of a difference compared to regular drinking water. It certainly tastes about like regular water, so nothing really bad to say about the taste of the product. In our case, it was water (whether enhanced or not), and it helped us achieve our goal of visiting the cave and having the water we needed. It certainly served its purpose. The question begs, though, would our experience have been any different had we just had regular water? The entrance to the cave even had natural spring water you could fill your containers with.<br /><br />I'm one who certainly gets daily headaches if I do not drink enough water. I've personally found drinking things like Gatorade or Propel certainly help me more than just drinking water. I suspect Essentia is going to be similar, despite its taste being basically water. It probably fools the mind more, compared to having some sort of flavor enhanced water/drink.<br /><br />Would I buy it again? Probably. The pricing isn't bad for a 12 pack, and you certainly get a good size bottle for each of the 12 units.

review/summary: Eh.It's Water
review/text: There's no doubt that water will taste quite different from source to source, but for the most part, unless you live in a town with a high sulfur or arsenic concentration, you don't NEED bottled water. A good PUR, Brita or Zero Water filter should be enough. So no one actually needs to PURCHASE Essentia. That said, if you're on a long car ride or visiting another country, bottled water makes sense. Essentia is a high pH water (on the base side. Low would be acidic and you wouldn't want to drink it). It tastes...okay. I've have better and I've had worse. It's a little pricer than most bottled water, but I'm happy that it is Electrolyte infused and that the bottles are BPA and Phthalate free. That makes Essentia a better choice than Aquavita or even Fiji which has a massively high carbon footprint.<br /><br />All in all, it's water. I can't say I'd go out of my way for this as I'd prefer to get Smartwater for my electrolyte enchanced h20 (better tasting), but I'd pick this up over a lot of the more common mass produced, secretly just tap water brands.

review/summary: Tastes Good
review/text: Previous reviews have been negative on the taste of this water, but to me, it has less taste than some common brands (Dasani, Aquafina) of water.  In that sense I like it more: I can't stand the slightly bitter/metallic taste of those waters.  This one "tastes" more like water.<br /><br />On the other hand, this is advertised for having the "correct" pH level, and as being electrolyte infused, but I have noticed nothing special about it in terms of how it impacts my workouts: it's wet, just like any other water.  So in this facet, I rate it as being less than advertised.

Can't compare to this water due to the pH. Didn't notice any benefits of drinking water. Pretty sure if I had continued drinking the water overtime there would be some sort of advantage over regular water. As far as price I will stick to the regular water that is less expensive.

review/summary: Helps me get better results when baking but doesn't taste much different
review/text: I ordered this to try primarily becuase I come from a part of the East Coast where our Tap water or Well water is naturally more Alkaline  than it is here in SOuthern CA.  For almost 20 years I've tried to make a decent crispy pizza crust or the right combination of tender on the inside, crsuty on the outside homemade breads.  I tried addiing things that should make the PH of my doughs more alkaline, hoping to reproduce the baking of my upbringing and yet.. I always failed.  Shortly before she died, an italian neighbor of mine from back east suggested I carry back some bottled water from our own well and save it just for bread baking.  well, after 9/11, you couldn't do that and it seemed all the bottled waters out here in CA tasted like sulfur and made my bread crusts tough.  The Good news is that I tried making several different types of bread using the Essentia and it DID seem to do the trick.  That may be a silly reason to buy bottled water but if you want to bake your great-grandmother's bread for the holidays, then what'sa few bottles of special water gonna hurt?<br /><br />As for taste?  It tasted fine to me - no better or worse than the best waters I've had. I can't say speak to the issue of GERD and acid reflux but if this water helps somebody with that, it's a lot better than getting hooked on Proton-pump inhibitor prescriptions that cause even more problems than they solve.  I read many of the reviews from people who were buying the Essentia for that reason and many of them seem to have found this water gives them more natural relief.  It's an interesting approach and one worth trying since the environmental impact and carbon footprint of relying for life on Prevacid or Nexium is far worse than simply swithing the bottled water you drink.  In a perfect world, we'd all toss our bottled water and use Tap filters but Essentia's Reverse Osmosis process followed by Ionic Separartion tech is a little bit.. no.. way above the cost reach of most home-owners.<br /><br />Me, I'll use my tap filter for drinking water but when I bake anything, I'll likely use Essentia as the water called for in the recipe because it most closely mimics the effect that the natural well water of my youth had on the baking process.  Water is not simply H20 - the minerals in it contribute to the outcome in cooking as does the pH.  Sure, I could just dump some extra baking soda in but that never worked in the past as well as Essentia has worked in my recent baking spree.  I'm a believer in it's chemcial differences vis a vis baking.  If helps some people reduce acid stomach without medication then they've found a unique way to help others.  You know how much a year's worth of Nexium costs?  Do the math and then you'll see my point.<br /><br />I don't think essentia will rock the world of bottled water but like Coconut water, caffiene water and even mint water, if it ain't HFCS soda, it's not as bad.  Sure, we should drink tap water but some people can't.  Until we all have Triple filtering technologies, there's Essentia.

review/summary: From someone who doesn't like bottled water, I enjoyed Essentia quite a bit...
review/text: Bottled water to me always seemed like a gimmick.  I grew up on tap water, unfiltered, straight from the hose or sink, and didn't mind it at all.  As I grew older I wanted the mineral taste to the water that you find in tap water, and spring water just seemed so bland and boring that the only time I ever actually liked drinking it was when I had run a marathon and was exhausted and any water would do.  Even now I bring bottled water to work, quickly finish it, and then drink tap water for the rest of the day.  I don't understand why people bring gallons of bottled water to work or the gym, or bring 4 16 oz. bottled water with them.  Made no sense.<br /><br />With Essentia I think I may have been turned.  Maybe it is the pH balance, but whatever they did to the water I absolutely love.  Crisp and fresh tasting, more so than normal bottled water.  I can see myself purchasing this and keeping it stocked.  They do come in rather large size bottles.  The one I had was 1.5 liters, but you receive 12 of them for around $28, which comes to a comparison shop of a little under a $1 per 16 oz. bottle.  From someone who doesn't like bottled water, I did enjoy this one quite a bit.<br /><br />5 stars.

review/summary: All Water Is Not The Same IMO
review/text: I have been drinking filtered water for many years. Ever since I was young I remember growing up drinking distilled water because my Uncle had sold my parents a distiller. Since then I have learned that the mineral content of the water is very important and also lends to a more smooth and refreshing drink. If any of you have tasted distilled water then you know what I mean.<br /><br />When I moved out and purchased my own house, I installed an R.O. filter under my kitchen sink and drank R.O. water for several years. R.O. water like distilled water has had most of the minerals removed during the filtration process. My local tap water has a pH of about 7.6 and a TDS (total dissolved solids) average of about 356 mS. My own R.O. water brought the conductivity down to around 30 mS and the pH to around 7 or slightly less. (I currently use my RO filter along with a de-ionizing filter afterwards to create ultra pure 0 mS TDS water for my Reef Tank) I do not drink it.<br /><br />I was introduced to "Kangen" or "ionized alkaline water" while I was traveling in Japan. It is water that has been filtered (usually thru a sediment, then a carbon block cartridge) and then run past energized Platinum plates to create 2 water streams. One stream is acidic and one is alkaline. The acid water can be used to clean, water plants and put topically on the skin amongst its many uses. The alkaline water is what you drink. Apparently during the ionizing process the water molecules are also altered. Usually water clusters together in 12 or so molecule clusters, while ionized water has smaller clusters of around 6-8 molecules. Supposedly this allows the water to cross the cell membranes in our bodies easier and promotes more rapid rehydration.<br /><br />Despite all the theories and studies, the real evidence for me is the way the water works for me. Before drinking alkaline water I would get heartburn or acid reflux occasionally after a long day of hard work or after eating certain foods. After several months of drinking alkaline water I never got acid reflux. Three years later since I first started drinking alkaline water I have only had acid reflux maybe twice. I would attribute that to the foods I ate that day and stressful work as well as not drinking the filtered water for several days prior. Alkaline water has improved my health in my opinion and am still drinking and prefer it to any other drinks when I am thirsty. It hasn't however kept me from getting sick occasionally or making me look many years younger. It has overall generally improved my health and I do feel better drinking it on a daily basis.<br /><br />Since I own a several thousand dollar alkaline water ionizer filter and drink the water daily. Own an R.O. filter and water testing equipment and understand a moderate amount of water chemistry principles. I was very curious to try this bottled version of alkaline water and see how it compares.<br /><br />It states on the label that the water has been R.O. filtered. Then minerals have been added back. It lists Sodium Bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate and calcium chloride. After the minerals have been added back then it is "alkalized and restructured using Ionic Separation Technology. All of this sounds very familiar as this is exactly how alkaline water ionizers work. The water needs to have minerals added back to be able to ionize the water. Here is what I discovered after trying a bottle:<br /><br />Taste: I like the taste of it. It's not bad. It's light and refreshing and very similar to my own alkaline water.<br /><br />Smell: Clean. No noticeable "off" odors.<br /><br />Hydration Ability: Better than tap, but, "nano-clustered" water supposedly looses its smaller clustering formation over time measured in days. I wonder if the water is still structured the same by the time it gets to us to drink. Didn't seem to refresh quite as well as freshly made alkaline water.<br /><br />pH: Label states a pH of 9.5 which is on par with my ionizer unit which can produce a range of pH strengths from 7.0 to 12.0 I usually drink alkaline water with a pH of 9.<br /><br />Overall I like the water and would choose it first over any other bottled water at the connivence store. Its benefits would be the fact that it is filtered, has a proper mineral content (unlike distilled and RO water only), and has an alkaline pH. It's limitations to me seem to be the age of it thus potentially losing its small water clustering, as well as the plastic bottle is comes in. Many alkaline water aficionados recommend using glass containers first, stainless steel second and BPA free plastic third as the hierarchy of best water vessels to use. While not providing all the benefits of freshly made alkaline ionized water, it does provide a good many of them. Currently a 12 pack of 1.5L bottles on Amazon cost $28.75 and this translates to roughly $0.80 per 16 oz of water, which is not bad compared to $1.25 16 oz bottles at my local store. I think the 1.5 liter is a good size and a good quantity of water to drink per day of this water for most people. That amount to $2.40 per 1.5L bottle. I make my own for pennies on the dollar, but when including the initial investment of purchasing the ionizer along with replacement filter costs, buying these bottles will be cheaper for a long payback period. However if getting the absolute full benefits of alkaline ionized water is very important, you may want to consider purchasing an ionizing unit. These also would be a good way to test drinking this type of water before purchasing your own unit. In conclusion I think Essentia water is making a very good attempt to bring the benefits of alkaline ionized water to more people and I would purchase it over any other bottled waters.

review/text: This water is amazing.  After getting a bottle at Whole Foods, I knew this is the water I like and I immediately ordered a whole case of it.  The taste is awesome, does make you feel more hydrated upon drinking (electrolytes), and the very high pH level aids in bodily functions such as digestion.  My body loves it.  I've tried many artisan (aka= pricier) waters out there available on the market and this water now made its way to my groceries list.  The 3 waters I now drink everyday are Fiji (it has high silica content, which is great for the skin), Hawaiian Springs (an all-rounded good water, and the bottle is pretty so I drink it when I go out), and now Essentia.  I also suggest people to really look into the pH level of the waters they are buying; don't bother if it's lower than 7 because it won't really benefit your body much (you'll be amazed at how many of the pricier waters are below pH 7; and surprisingly, Whole Foods 365 water is a nice water that is price-friendly).

review/summary: Keeping One's Body Alkaline is Essential for Good Health.  Drinking Essentia Helps.
review/text: After a strenuous workout, one must drink plenty of water in order to replenish the electrolytes that were lost through sweating.  Water with an optimum pH level of 9.5 is better absorbed into one's body.  Most tap water and bottled water has a pH level of 7 or below.  Not only is Essentia enriched with electrolytes but it has an average pH level of 9.5.  Therefore, these electrolytes, which are essential for rehydration after a workout, are more readily absorbed into the body.  Bodybuilders have begun carrying gallon jugs of electrolyte rich water with a pH level of 9.5 to their gyms.  Over a few months, most of them have noticed that they recover quicker from their workouts.<br /><br />  I enjoy using one of the elliptical trainers inside the clubhouse at Holly Point Apartments where I live.  Usually, I drink Glaceau Smart Water [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005T1302A">Glaceau Smart Water, 33.82-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>] after each of my workouts.  It tastes very refreshing and hydrates me better than ordinary tap water.  It is called Smart Water because it is rich in electrolytes.  Recently, I received a 1.5 Liter plastic bottle of Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water from the Amazon Vine Program.  Essentia is also rich in electrolytes but boasts a pH level of 9.5, which is essential for ensuring that these electrolytes are absorbed by the body.  As far as taste and smell, there is no difference between the Essentia and Glaceau.  (See the photograph that I have posted on the web site for this product.)  Odorless and colorless, both brands are very refreshing.  They readily quench my thirst after thirty minutes on the elliptical.  I've tried other brands of tap water {e.g., Aquafina (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042YSWLE">Aquafina Pure Water - 32 / 16.9 fl. Oz.</a>) and Dasani [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ZY7Y9M">Dasani Purified Water (02762) 0.5 Liter (Pack of 24)</a>]} and they look and taste no different than my tap water.<br /><br />  Many nutritionists are constantly shouting that good health is obtained by eating fruits and vegetables because they make our bodies more alkaline (higher pH level).  An alkaline body resists disease.  Highly processed foods, junk foods, sugars, and meats cause our bodies to become more acidic (lower pH).  Acidic bodies are prone to disease and illness.  Cancer cells are fueled by foods that are acidic.  It only makes sense that our water is best when its alkaline level has a high pH level such as 9.5.  I've noticed that I feel more energetic after a workout when I drink Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water or Glaceau Smart Water in lieu of ordinary tap water that has been flavored with my favorite MIO sweet tea water enhancer [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4HUMY">MIO Sweet Tea, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>].  The MIO probably inhibits the absorption of much needed electrolytes.  Now, I only drink water enhanced with MIO at mealtime.  I continue drinking Essentia or Glaceau during and after my workouts.<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos

review/text: And that is pretty awesome.  It is silky smooth and rests well on my palate.  Sometimes these bottled waters, especially those with ulterior motives, can have an almost thick texture, but Essentia goes down with ease.  Now, this water is infused with electrolytes and is formatted to help reduce acid reflux and help with indigestion.  I must admit that this works rather well in that regard.  I've had an issue with indigestion for a while (years) and while I can't say that this has cured me entirely, I have noticed a difference in the way I feel.  I'm glad that some have compared this to Evian, because Evian is one brand of water I cannot stomach (talking of thick water), but Essentia is clean and smooth and serves its purpose beautifully.

I rarely drink bottled water, but when I do I often find the taste doesn't impress me much. Water is wet, tasteless, hydrating, that's it.<br /><br />I can say, as far as water goes, this Essentia water had zero funny, minerally, chemically taste to it. Pure and tasteless. I did appreciate that. I can't speak to the added pH factor because I'm not really sure what the benefits of that would look like in real time. I suppose if I only drank this water for a month through all the cycling, running and swimming I do I might see a difference, but that is a costly experiment for someone on a budget.<br /><br />All in all, decent bottled water, but nothing supernatural about it that would make me switch from tap.

review/summary: Silky, Smooth, pH Balanced Water
review/text: Disclosure:  I'm a tap water drinker at heart.  Give me a Camelback bottle and an hour in the refrigerator and I'll gladly drink our city water as is.  When I got the chance to try Essentia's purified, pH balanced water for review purposes, I jumped at it, mostly to find out what I was missing.  On balance, I like it better that tap water or some of the store bottled waters.  I'm probably too stingy to buy more myself, but if you think it would make the difference between drinking water and going without, I would highly recommend Essentia.<br /><br />Flavor:  Essentia is osmotically purified, then electrolytes* are added to mimic the subtle mineral flavors that you get with groundwater.  The result: A very clean water flavor, with an almost silky feel as you drink it.  The difference isn't huge -- it's all water, after all -- but it's definitely there, and it's definitely an improvement.<br /><br />pH Balance: As stated, this is pH balanced at 9.5.  I have to confess I haven't read anything on why you might want water this alkaline, and I didn't notice any difference while drinking it.  Still, if you're looking for an alkaline drink, this fits the bill.

review/summary: Great tasting water and good hydration!
review/text: Essentia is great tasting water. I don't like super cold water and most taste awful at room temperature so that is the temperature I judge water by. At room temp this water tasted great and I felt hydrated after drinking it which is the most important thing. I used reverse osmosis water before and no matter how much I drank I would still get dehydrated because of the 0 mineral content your body just doesn't hydrate. This water left me feeling great even after a very strenuous workout I didn't feel like I had to keep going for more and more water. This water has good mineral content and hydrates well and tastes really great what more can you ask for.

review/summary: It's water, with a metallic aftertaste.
review/text: Essentia 9.5ph Drinking water is pretty much...water. It advertises a "silky smooth taste", but I think it just tasted like plain old tap water. We passed it around a group of people, sampling it and everyone agreed there is a definite metallic taste. I would take a pass on this brand.

review/summary: It's water
review/text: I tried this product while hiking Mount Whitney - you need good hydration while hiking and the electrolytes are a plus too.  Now I only had one bottle with me on the 20 mile hike so my experience is limited and the weather was perfect for hiking (i.e. not hot but very warm)<br /><br />The following is from the product page:<br /><br />"Essentia Water provides unmatched hydration, health benefits and smooth taste."<br />- The perfect water has no taste and this had a slight bitter taste<br /><br />"Its superior hydrating qualities come from a special electrolyte formula and optimal pH level of 9.5, which gives your body more of what it needs to thrive."<br />- On the trail, this water lasted a long time.  Therefore, I must assume that the hydration claim is valid<br /><br />"Drinking Essentia Water boosts the antioxidant properties of your immune system and helps bring your body back into balance."<br />-This of course is virtually impossible to evaluate<br /><br />"It also helps maintain normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and more."<br />-Again, this is virtually impossible to evaluate.<br /><br />I would guess that if you are just looking for drinking water, this is a waste of money but if you are looking for water to drink while exercising or other physical activity where hydration is very important this might be worth looking into.

review/summary: Have you ever had...dry water?
review/text: Essential water sounded great...in theory. Just what I needed after running. After trying it, I guess i will stick to Gatorade to replenish electrolytes.<br /><br />I tried this water over several days and I have to say,  have never felt so thirsty whilst drinking so called "water". Let's start with the taste. I have tried spring water, as in 'put my hand in a spring and drink water' spring water and this can't taste any further from it. It tastes metallic and artificial at the same time. It leaves my mouth  with a horrible after taste. Not only that, after drinking it I was never dated. I have never been so thirsty after drinking water... Ever.<br /><br />The price of this is well above anything I would pay for water. At least <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NPUTSq">Vitamin Water</a> tasted good.

review/summary: Not Better Than My Filtered Water
review/text: A couple years ago my dentists told me that tap water was rotting my teeth.  So it was time to make change.  Usually I just drink from the filter I attached to my kitchen faucet since bottled water is not good for the environment and sometimes bottled water manufacturers have been found to just put tap water in their bottles.  Essentia hypes "silky smooth taste" "hydrates better" "electrolytes infused" and "Best available pH at 9.5".  Okay, the last two sound like marketing mumbo jumbo.  It does have silky smooth taste, but really all water I have drank aside from unfiltered well or city water has silky smooth taste.  It does have a slight weird taste to it.  Not bad weird or good weird, just different taste to what I am used to.  As for its claim to that it hydrated better, I drank it after mowing the lawn and did not feel better than I do with my regular filtered water.  Essentia will not get me to change from tap water, but if you only drink bottled water you may want to give it a try, it is a bigger bottle which makes it slightly better for the environment than the smaller bottles (but not s good as just buying a filter).

review/summary: It is water.....
review/text: Other than orange juice in the morning I pretty much don't drink anything except water.  I received a 1.5 liter bottle to try of this purified water.  I think "purified" in the name says something.<br />The bottle says that they have "proprietary technology" which has purified the water by reverse osmosis then infused it with electrolytes for taste, alkalized and restructured it using ionic separation technology.  Okay, we will take their word for it, but none of that sounds any different from any other reverse osmosis to me and adding the "electrolytes" is what changes the pH of the water to make it alkalized and restructured, if I remember my chemistry correctly.  The ingredients are listed as purified water, sodium bicarbonate dipotassium phosphate magnesium sulfate and calcium chloride.  The bottle never gives a source but you can find Bothell WA, so most likely it comes from the public water supply there.<br /><br />More bottle information - Doctor recommended to protect improve and enhance the quality of your health.  Silky smooth taste, infused with electrolytes for a difference you can taste 9.5 pH.  I have been told by my doctor to drink at least 2 liters of water daily.  I am a distance walker and live in a hot dry area of the country so any outside work or exercise requires a replacement of fluids and most likely electrolytes.  I don't like sports drinks.  So water with electrolytes is perfect for me.<br /><br />This water did taste good.  It was smooth.  I am just not sure that I want to drink water from a public water source when I can get water from a spring, drop in an electrolyte tablet and have the same thing.  So while I can't argue with any of the claims made on the bottle, I am not convinced enough that this is a "can't live without it" purchase.

review/summary: Noticeably great tasting water compared to regular bottled water
review/text: The Essentia 9.5 pH drinking water has a noticeably distinct taste compared to the regular bottled ones you buy in the store. And I say this from a bottled-water drinker perspective. Water in my part of the country is specially hard, even when applying consumer filtration. That is why we have regular drinking water delivery. But after trying Essentia, I have a brand new perspective of what drinking water should be. Nothing beats water that has been industrially treated with the right minerals and ph balance. Unlike other consumer grade bottled drinking water, the Essentia undergoes the usual filtration: reverse osmosis, UV, etc. but what makes this a truly long lasting hydrating liquid is that it is infused with electrolytes and life essential minerals that you cannot get with consumer-grade bottled water. Essentia hydrates better making drinking water fun and far in between. Very highly recommended!!

review/summary: Health claims aside, it's a unique tasting water
review/text: There are a number of interesting studies surrounding alkaline water and its health benefits.  A google search can be hard to find a good source given the amount of salesmanship surrounding this type of product.  However, I felt the livestrong website had a well-sourced write up ([...]).  Having only had one bottle to sample, the long term benefits are not my concern for the purposes of this review.<br /><br />What I did notice right away was that this water does actually have a unique taste -- as subtle as water tastes can be.  I thought it was actually quite pleasant and clean -- certainly better than the filtered tap water that comes out of my fridge.  The electrolytes, which can sometimes have an oily taste, are undetectable.<br /><br />The hydration factor is noticeable to me.  I would go out on a limb and say that it may even surpass the hydration factor of electrolyte water on its own (which can be made easily by buying electrolyte packs to add to water).<br /><br />Now, is the hydration factor and *potential* long term health benefit something that's worth more than double the price of, say, Poland Spring?  That's up to you.  There's not a lot of information surrounding how much of this stuff you'd need to drink to see health benefits.  So using it as a long term product might get quite expensive.  Using it for hydration after a long day, or when feeling sick would be my choice.

review/summary: Superbly Refreshing
review/text: I drink water from my jug as I work through long days, and I love water so much, I usually drink more from a glass when I get home as well. Water is my drink of choice.<br /><br />This Essentia pH balanced water has an advantage over plain water when it comes to refreshment. I've read about the scientifically most agreeable level of pH in water before, but I had never tried any of it until now.<br /><br />Having had jugged tap water until I was blue in the face that hot workday, I figured there would be no better time to try my Essentia once I got home and I was all watered-out. In every bit of honesty, I savored this bottle of water. I chugged, at a reasonable pace, every drop. I found it delicious, smooth and refreshing.<br /><br />Sure, it's more than just water; actually, it's purified water, sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate and calcium chloride. That's what it takes to achieve the perfect pH that makes it so easy to glide through all six servings these 1.5 liter bottles provide. Like most commercial beverages, this one has a formula as well, and it works out great.<br /><br />In the end, it's still water, but there is something favorable about water with a pH of 9.5. When chilled, this stuff is remarkably enjoyable. If you're a water connoisseur and you buy bottled water anyway, then definitely try Essentia - it's very nice.

review/summary: Too much hype
review/text: The description for this product makes some rather bold claims such as normalizing your blood pressure, proving a better night's sleep, boosting heart health, and muscle strength.  When I see these sorts of claims, I get very suspicious.  I'm not a scientist, but these sorts of claims bother me when no studies are cited.<br /><br />From what I can tell, the 9.5 pH level is achieved by the addition of sodium bicarbonate, the same ingredient in many antacids.  If you really hate the taste of antacids, trying this water to get relief might be worth it.<br /><br />I have to admit that this water really does taste great.  It's difficult to describe the taste exactly, but it tastes much better than most bottled waters.<br /><br />For some odd reason, this water gave me a stomach ache, so despite the taste, I won't give it another try.<br /><br />I marginally recommend this item if you want to give it a try for relieving indigestion.

review/summary: Beats the heck out of the tap!
review/text: I have to take several pills each day and the rusty dirt that the local municipal water company seeps out of our kitchen faucets doesn't particularly further my eagerness to swallow them. Choosing instead to use Gatorade or the Mio water flavoring is neither ideal or inexpensive in the long run either. I was pleasantly surprised therefore to find the Essentia pH Drinking water a nice alternative to flavorings plus the bottle that was supplied by Amazon was much larger than I expected. At the current price point this offers very good value for money especially when compared to the little 8oz bottles you can get at the store.<br /><br />Now I can't comment on the additional positives added by the pH levels boasted on the bottle, nor can I honestly say whether this water tastes 'good' compared to others. It tastes like clean water. I can say that some of the pills I take (steroids) taste awful so it's nice to be able to down them with a cold refreshing bit of aqua instead of brown sludge or sickly sweet drinks.<br /><br />Ultimately, if like me, your water supply is less than stellar then you can't go wrong with this brand for cost or quantity.

I am already a regular drinker of PH water but it is  8.4 and this particular one is 9.5.  I have found that PH water really does give me more energy and I have found that it allows me to eat some foods I love that I used to have more problems with because of the acid, like  tomatoes and uncooked apples.<br />I know this water  is man made but they do the job right with reverse osmosis.  I  love the extra things added to this water because many of us need them so much in our busy lives, things like electrolytes and potassium. I will buy this water as an extra when I am out and about or when I run out of water but I am sticking with my 8.4 alkaline water because it is cheaper, has the same smooth, good  taste and is natural as well as less expensive than this one.

Perhaps drinking nothing but pH adjusted water for weeks would make a difference.  It didn't do much for me.<br /><br />In short, it's decent bottled water.  If you like still bottled water in plastic bottles, then you probably would enjoy this as much as any other.

That being said I find myself pretty much unmoved by Essentia's claim for a 9.5PH factor, electrolyte infused & great taste.<br /><br />Quite frankly it tastes like filtered water. Unoffensive & yes, thirst quenching. I suppose the real bone to pick here would be the price. A case of this = twelve 1.5L bottles runs between $22.00 to $68.00 bucks. A case of 24, 20ox bottles runs for about $31.00 - meanwhile a case of Aquafina: 32/16.9oz bottles can go for as low as $4.95. And tastes pretty much the same.<br /><br />So I suppose the real answer is not so much the water itself but how much you are willing to pay?

review/summary: It's Good Water, But...?
review/text: I popped open a 1.5 Liter bad boy after a six-mile run and felt refreshed, but it was very hot and I don't know that the refreshment was from anything more than recovering from severe thirst.  I drank the entire bottle in about 15 minutes.<br /><br />I take other pre-workout and post-workout supplements and many of them have potassium and electrolytes.  I noticed that a bottle of water from Wal-mart, bottled at a municipal plan, contains the same level of potassium as Essentia.  I down a couple of 16.9 ounce bottles of that water after running as well.<br /><br />So, I can't attest that this water will change your life.  I can't even attest that it's worth more than other waters.  pH balanced water sounds great, and there's really nothing from a taste level that's bad, certainly.  But did it impact my overall physical recovery after a run?  I don't think so.  I was less thirsty, of course, but my legs didn't spring into action any faster or anything like that.<br /><br />It's good water.  Given a choice of this water or another brand that was similarly priced, I'd reach for this one.  But I also didn't experience a compelling reason to switch from the cheaper Wal-mart water.

review/text: I conducted a blind taste test between 4 different waters:  tap water, tap water filtered through a Brita filter, a popular bottled water, and this product.  All of the waters were at room temperature. Not surprisingly, the tap water tasted the worst.  The bottled water was next, and I would say that this water tied with the Brita filter water for good taste.  The Essentia water tasted "softer" (similar to Evian), but with a better flavor. It has a little after-taste which I presume is related to the minerals.  I can't evaluate any health benefits because I've only tried the product for a few days, but I'll update this review if I notice anything.  Bottom line-- at home I'll still probably use Brita-filtered water because it's less expensive, but when buying water at the store or needing bottled water for any reason, this is an excellent choice and better-tasting than typical bottled water.

review/text: Essentia has a nice, clean taste with no hint of chemical residue.  I've only tried one bottle so far, so I can't speak to its long-term health benefits.<br /><br />I DO know that UV treated reverse-osmosis water is the "safest," although, as with distillation, the R-O process also depletes minerals.  Which is probably why Essentia has added electrolytes, a big plus.  My hubby has a health condition that demands he carefully monitor his electrolyte levels, so this water makes that just a little bit easier, with a good balance of magnesium, sodium, and potassium, without any of the added sugars of conventional sports drinks like Gatorade.<br /><br />If you take vitamin supplements like I do, it's especially important to use a chlorine-free water like this for mixing and simply taking your supplements.  Chlorine SERIOUSLY interferes with the efficacy of supplements; this is especially obvious with green drinks, which will actually lose some of their color (and TONS of their nutritional value).  A compelling argument for giving a little more thought to the water you drink...

review/summary: Good taste - haven't hit on the benefits yet
review/text: I haven't felt any difference using the Essentia water after a workout - honestly the pH doesn't seem to impact the post-workout thirst, but the benefits from the electrolytes are a nice addition. I'm not a big fan of sports drinks so this unflavored option is welcome. If there's anything I can say that I don't like, it'd be that the water feels "heavy". I generally drink a generic bottled spring water (the tap water is very hard and tastes off to me) and in comparison the Essentia felt almost thick on the tongue.<br /><br />For the green folks, the bottle itself is listed as BPA free (PET 1) but it is not biodegradable (but it will not leech into the soil either - it simply won't breakdown).<br /><br />The purification method the company lists on their website is microfiltration, UV sterilization and reverse osmosis. For those who aren't familiar with these processes, safe to say that it really will not matter where the original water source originates from if these processes are used. Both microfiltration and reverse osmosis will remove most of the large particles and the UV light will kill off the organisms. Using a spring water source would really be irrelevant at this point because you'd essentially be stripping everything out of the water, leaving nothing but simple H2O.<br /><br />All-in-all, the Essentia didn't taste bad, and the flavorless electrolyte source is a great option if you're not a sports drink fan. Also, the fact that it didn't taste "salty" like the Disani-type waters was a big plus for me.

review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:32 Mins<br /><br /></span>One reviewer smartly pointed out that the water source that this company uses is "municipal water." That's tap water. Before you think negatively of that, consider that they then put it through the reverse osmosis process and add the ingredients that I mention in the video.<br /><br />More importantly, since it's bottled in Bothell, Washington, you can be assured that their municipal water is outstanding - practically spring water.<br /><br />The fact that it tastes just like nice water isn't surprising. It would be worrisome if it didn't taste like water!

review/summary: If I'm going to buy bottled water, I'll seek this one out.
review/text: I try not to buy a lot of bottled water.  It's expensive, and I don't like the extra plastic it creates even though I  always try to find a recycling bin for my empties.  However, there are those days where I forget my water bottle or want more to drink than I carried with me.  For those few days, I'd choose Essentia drinking water as often as I choose spring water even though Essentia comes from municipal sources.  Essentia's silky texture is very cool.  It reminds me of the lake and creek water we drink when out and about in rural Alaska (NOTE: you should NOT drink lake and creek water without verifying its safety).  I chose to try out Essentia since I was curious about the whole 9.5 pH thing.  I don't feel any difference in consuming this pH of water, but did find it nice to drink as water.<br /><br />In short, I can't say I'll be a regular consumer of Essentia since I'm not a regular consumer of bottled water.  But on the few days that I am, this is a choice I'd make.

review/summary: Good water, but could not confirm pH 9.5 benefits
review/text: Essentia has two major claims about this water: it has a smooth taste, and it also has health benefits due to 9.5 pH level. I can confirm that it does indeed taste good, but my research on pH 9.5 benefits were not conclusive.<br /><br />First of all, it really has high pH level. I have a test kit for my aquarium, and it confirmed that this water's pH is near asserted levels. But when I performed some research whether it really has benefits, I ended up with mixed results.<br /><br />Most majority of water sources (whether tap water, or special ones like Fiji) seems be alkaline (high pH level). And I know that natural water sources that are advertised to have health benefits are also in this area. But they are usually not that high (at least recommended levels are up to 8.5), and they contain beneficial minerals. Essentia lists only a few of them.<br /><br />Drinking such high pH would probably not upset your stomach (since our diets are highly acidic, this would only neutralize it). However I would not recommend it for any other use. For example coffee would not taste right. And it would probably kill your fish in the aquarium.<br /><br />Overall, this is much better than tap water, or regular bottled ones. While I cannot completely vouch for its chemical benefits, most of my research points in that direction. If the price is right (currently it seems to be higher than normal), I would recommend this.

review/text: First of all it's quite a challenge to do a review for water---for Pete's sake.  LOL<br />I received a 50.72 ounce of drinking water to review for Amazon.  I refrigerated it since I prefer to drink my water cold and then also pour it over ice.  What can I tell you?  I don't think it's my imagination when I tell you that it does taste smooth.  It is refreshing and even though I am not a big water drinker I would choose this product again if I had a chance to buy it.<br />Therefore I give it a recommend to buy.

review/summary: Unflavored Gatorade?
review/text: The label said this water is 'smooth'.  Dont know about you but I've I've never had water that wasn't smooth.<br /><br />Kind of like tap water in that it really isnt as tasteless as spring water.  Essentia, according to the label contains potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, as well as spring water.  The label says it's best available ph at 9.5.  (Not a clue what that means.)<br /><br />The label also says it hydrates better.  I'm thinking this may be true as my thirst was quenched with less of Essentia than of regular tap or spring water so I drank less.  Not sure if this is a good thing or not.  Also, I did not have to run to the bathroom in a half hour.  This could be coincidence of course.<br /><br />I have to admit I did feel a bit more energized by Essentia.  Not sure if this was my imagination or just another coincidence.<br /><br />All in all I found Essentia to be a good experience.  I would buy more.<br /><br />Thank you.<br />MEF

review/summary: Tastes like water, electrolytes help rehydrate
review/text: I'm all for the larger than most size (1.5 liter) bottle of water targeted for athletes, the mineral components and the simple taste of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HG9ET0">Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water, 1.5 Liter, (Pack of 12)</a>, but I've deducted a star from this rating because I consider its price to be exorbitant.  In its defense, not only is this water good for rehydration after exercise, but for the times when one is sick and requiring an infusion of electrolytes, I would choose this product over another "sports" drink in a heartbeat.  Will keep a bottle on hand for emergencies, but at the current high cost, I will not purchase for daily consumption.

review/summary: Re-hydrates Quickly!
review/text: The Essentia 9.5 ph drinking water taste similar to Aquafina or Dasani water and those brands I don't like, but this water was a little better tasting than those other brands. I wanted to give this water a chance and not compare it to those brands so, I drank it and monitored myself to see if there were any added benefits but there wasn't.<br /><br />The added electrolytes came in handy when I was on the treadmill and it seemed to re-hydrate me almost immediately without any extra calories that I would usually take in if I drank a sports drink. The water was smooth but I didn't really care for the taste. The water didn't give me any other benefits other than quickly re-hydrating my body and that's a good thing for me. I would drink this rather than sports drinks, but other than that I don't know if it is doing my body any good.

review/summary: Tastes good but quite expensive
review/text: I tested this water against my regular tap water and Whole Foods spring water - it does have a smooth and almost silky quality and a pleasant taste. We blind tested all three and could reliably identify each of them (just checking it wasn't my imagination!). I only received one sample bottle so I can't comment on its claim to 'hydrate better' or any of the supposed health effects, though some other reviewers have noted long-term benefits.<br /><br />I like the oversized bottle - if you're trying to drink more water each day, it's ideal for taking to work to measure how much you're actually drinking. It's a good product though the biggest downside is the cost compared with other bottled waters or home-installed filtration systems.

review/summary: About the same as normal filtered water.
review/text: There are wide selections of bottled drinking waters available.  This current trend of high pH water claims many "healthful benefits including being a natural antioxidant, flushes out toxins and neutralizes acidity in the body, more hydrating than conventional water, etc." from online health and nutrition websites.  Let's give this Essentia 9.5 pH drinking water a try.<br /><br />Likes:<br />>Decent taste; similar to my home water filter system with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YOQ0C2">Watts Premier 531105 RO-Pure Annual Filter Pack</a> that also uses reverse osmosis purification.<br />>I drank the sample 1.5 liter bottle for two evenings during my after-work workouts and didn't notice any improvements in performance but it did quench my thirst very well and seemed to have shortened recovery time with less sore muscles (perhaps from some lactic acid buffering properties AFTER the workouts).<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />>I appreciate this sample but the cost of Approx. $5 for each 1.5 liter bottle is very high.  My Ro-Pure system filters the same amount of water for far less.<br />>Healthful benefits are only claims and not proven through scientific studies with proper clinical research methodologies.  It's difficult to draw conclusions by just drinking 1.5 liters.<br />>Possible long term effects of high pH drinking water with ingredients of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, and calcium chloride (salts/electrolytes).<br /><br />Overall:<br />Overpriced "trendy" drinking water that tastes about the same as home reverse osmosis filtered water.  Claims of high pH water health benefits questionable.  Works OK as regular drinking water but doesn't improve performance during workouts.

review/text: This is nice bottled water. It does have minerals added - and the taste is slightly different. It reminds me of "soft" water. So if you like that type of taste or prefer it, then this is for you. If you like a crisper (the only way I know hoe to describe it) or "harder" water, then you wont like it.<br /><br />The other good news, is that the bottle it self is strong, like the old water bottles used to be. Not like the thin flimsy stuff you get today. So if you like to reuse your water bottles (like me) this one is great!

review/summary: Like the Idea...Not Sold on the Product
review/text: Tastes good, smooth...I thought (husband thought it tasted salty and chalky compared with our reverse osmosis system).  I like the idea of the alkalinized pH and electrolytes...but I'm not willing to spend the amount asked for this product.  For pennies on the dollar I can mix an electrolyte formula at home, add some gatorade powder, or eat a salted banana or some prunes to restore electrolytes.  I also am certain that the pH will make no difference long term if one's diet is not also addressed (in which case this water is no longer needed).  There is a lot of information available online about the acidity of foods and the types of symptoms one can expect if they have trouble with pH...and what to do about it.  I'd rather spend my money on the right food than on expensive bottled water that is likely no better than what I already have under my kitchen sink.  I did like the 1.5L bottle, I liked the water...I just am not convinced it is worth the price or the convenience.

review/text: Essentia's 9.5 pH water is pleasant enough drinking water with electrolytes to spare--perfect to keep refreshed after exercising or spending all day outside. Unlike many bottled waters or sports drinks, I did not find a metallic aftertaste and I did not detect an odor. I was a bit concerned with the price--though the Amazon price of almost 30 bucks for a 12 pack of 1.5 liter bottles seems a bit more reasonable than some of the other prices out there. Still, this is reservoir water--as other reviewers note. While the water was refreshing enough and kept me hydrated, if I'm going to pay this much for water, I would prefer something a bit more natural.

review/summary: Clean taste
review/text: First off, I normally don't buy bottled water, so I'm not an expert on the taste of bottled water.  I do, however, buy a lot of sports drinks for drinking while cycling and working out.  I wasn't sure how to review plain ol' water, but I decided just to compare it with the water I get out of my faucet.  The Essentia does indeed have a better taste to it.  By comparison, my tap water has a slightly bitter taste (I'm guessing from chlorine or other chemicals added to purify it).  Essentia's water really has no taste, which is actually a good thing.  I'm not sure of the benefits its pH balance has for your body.  The addition of electrolytes does mean this product can do more for you than plain tap water if you're working out and losing a lot of water through sweat.  If you won't miss the sugary taste of a sports drink, this is a good zero-calorie alternative.

review/summary: Pretty Decent Water :)
review/text: I have tasted a lot of different types of bottled waters, and most are little more than once or twice purified city water, and the taste shows, they don't taste good at all, some even have a plastic-like taste...  Thankfully, that is not the case with this water, in regards to taste.<br /><br />  The bottle doesn't really say how many times it has been purified, and what process it uses to purify the water, but it does state it is Alkalized, which is supposed to be very good for your body.  I have a local Asian restaurant where all of their water (they do this themselves, they have a purifier and what-not) is purified through reverse osmosis and is then Alkalized, which they say, has been known to cure illnesses in countries like Japan for a very long time.  Water processed that way does have a pretty good taste.<br /><br />  I would have to say, although this water may seen expensive, it really isn't, the bottles are a little smaller then two liters, so they last a while, as well as the way it is processed as well.  Since the bottles are so large, this is more of a water you would drink around the house rather than take on the go with you, unless, say it was at work or in your car.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy

review/text: I must admit, although it is bad for the environment due to the plastic bottles, I regularly consume bottled water.  I have tried many versions, and while one would think that water is water, they really do taste differently.<br /><br />In terms of taste, I thought this water tasted good.  I chose to chill mine before drinking it, and found it to be very refreshing, without any chemical or metallic taste that I was able to detect.  It tasted, in short, like water.  I did not think the change in pH made it taste any differently, so that is a real positive for me.<br /><br />While I cannot speak to the accuracy of the claims of the benefits to this particular formula of water, I can say that if the water does indeed contain the additional electrolytes, this provides a good alternative to sugary high calorie sports drinks.<br /><br />Many reviewer commented that this is merely treated water from municipalities, as opposed to spring water, and therefore not worth the cost.  If this were the sole source of my water intake, I would agree.  I would not purchase this for the whole of my drinking and cooking water.  But when looking for a bottle of water to take on a trip or throw in a backpack, or a source of electrolytes after athletic activity (or illness) I think this would fit the bit quite nicely.

I can't say that I noticed a huge difference between the water that I usually drink and this one, but it wasn't bad. Good taste and the electrolytes (and zero calories) made this a good post-workout drink.

review/summary: Tastes fine but kinda leaves your mouth dry??
review/text: You know how when you drink gatorade, you've never really quenched your thirst?  Do you know what I mean?  When I drink gatorade, or anything else with electrolytes in it, my tongue always feels kinda dry afterwards.  Like I should have just had plain water instead.<br />This stuff tastes fine.  I don't think it tasted "silky smooth" like the bottle said, but it was fine - tasted like water.  (You want "silky smooth" water?  Try Fiji water!  It rocks!).<br />I didn't get anything out of this.  I didn't feel any different or notice any tangible difference.<br />I mean, if you're big into getting electrolytes but don't want to drink gatorade or any of those other goofy products, then this is for you.  Me, I'm sticking with Poland Springs, or Fiji when I can get it!

review/summary: Great Tasting Water
review/text: I am very picky about my water. I moved to Florida at the age of 15 and I quickly realized that I could not drink the tap water. I can actually taste the difference at restaurants when they serve tap water versus purified or bottled water. Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water is the best water I have ever tasted. It tastes completely clear and delicious.<br /><br />I only received a 1.5 liter bottle, so I did not notice any of the medical benefits of the 9.5pH water. I do have GERD, but didn't notice a difference with drinking the 1.5 liters of water over 2 days. The price is a little steep on this water, but I would consider buying more for the taste and to see if it really helps my GERD.

review/summary: Nothing Special
review/text: I have to say from the beginning that I was a bit skeptical about the claims on the bottle of this product, the primary one being that it is "Doctor recommended to protect, improve and enhance the quality of your health." There is no information as to what kind of doctor is making the claim or as to what the specific recommendation is for. I have to wonder if, in fact, the claim, is simply in reference to the fact that most doctors recommend water over any other hydration source.<br /><br />The label also claims proprietary technology in the bottling of this water. However, that technology is described as reverse osmosis, which is pretty standard in the water bottling industry (it's what keeps most bottled waters from being nothing more than tap water). The claim this water makes that is missing from other bottled waters is that it is "infused with electrolytes" and "alkalinized and restructured using ionic Separation Technology." Now, it's been a long time since I've had a science class, but the fact that the ingredient list includes "purified water, sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate and calcium chloride" lead me to believe that this is nothing more than water that has been basically filtered and had some salt added to it to keep it soft.<br /><br />That being said, the taste of the water was just fine. It didn't have the chemically taste of tap water, but it wasn't as crisp as other bottled waters I've had (I'll take Aquafina or Arrowhead any day). I tried the water both chilled (as I prefer it) and at room temperature. Even chilled, it missed the crispness that I like in my water. It may simply be that I was expecting more considering the claims on the bottle; it may just as well be that it was over alkalinized. In either case, the taste neither bothered nor pleased me.<br /><br />As far as the size of the bottle itself, I'd say it's quite generous. At the current price of 28.25 for a dozen 1.5 liter bottles, it's a good value in comparison to other comparably sized bottles of water on the market. This makes it convenient for the mini-fridge at work, but much, much too large for the cup holder in the car where I'm more likely to want to grab a bottle of water for when I'm on the go.

review/summary: Water taste, sturdy bottle
review/text: This Essential bottled water comes in a 1.5 Liter (50.7 fluid ounces) recyclable bottle, which roughly translates to about six servings of water (8oz servings). Zero calories. The bottle promotes a silky smooth taste, better hydration, electrolytes infused and pH of 9.5 which is on the alkaline side of things.<br /><br />On the first claim, I liked the taste, it tasted slightly different than the water I usually drink, but no big difference. To me, the Essentia water tasted better cold/iced than room temperature, it has a nice crispness (for lack of a better word) to it. I drank this at different times and different days, before and after and in-between meals, so as to get a more rounded and averaged out taste. I did not taste any plasticiness.<br /><br />On the other three claims, without having access to a research lab, scientists, and hundreds of test subjects, I am afraid it is above and beyond a customer review to answer those claims. On the plus side, nothing bad happened to me after I drank this water :)<br /><br />The bottle appears to be a sturdy one, it arrived undaunted and undamaged. I don't know if it is reusable, but it is definitely recyclable.

review/summary: Strong taste, nothing special
review/text: This isn't bad water; but it's not great, either.  I don't like to be able to taste my water much, and this has just too much of a mineral taste for my preference.  If there was nothing else around, I could certainly drink it, but I would never go out of my way to buy it, especially at this price.<br /><br />But everyone has their own preference for water.  To give you an idea of mine, I am okay with most bottled waters, but I HATE Nestle Pure Life.  If you like Nestle, you probably like a more flavorful water, and you might enjoy this Essentia.<br /><br />Also, as far as I know, the alkaline pH of this water is a little unusual.  If you have a problem with stomach acidity or GERD, it might be worth trying to see if it helps.

review/summary: Now This IS Water
review/text: Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water is the kind of water I've always heard about, a tasteless beverage. Even when I was a little girl and heard someone say water has no taste I would think, "Yes, it does."<br /><br />I use a Brita Filter system which is fine for making coffee and tea as well as for cooking. But, it does get annoying spending a chunk of my time everyday filling the pitcher so I'm drinking and using water that smells and tastes like it was scooped from a swimming pool with a spritz of this chemical and a splash of that other one. So keeping some bottles of Essentia 9.5 pH in my refrigerator has it ready to go when all I want to drink is a nice, cold glass of water that refreshes without images of the pool at the gym flashing in my mind.<br /><br />Essentia 9.5 pH gives me exactly what I want. A glass of water that leaves me feeling refreshed and hydrated with no aftertaste.

review/text: I'm not familiar with the benefits of high pH water like this but if it's better for you than normal water then I'd highly recommend this product because it tastes EXACTLY like regular filtered, bottled water. Some people have talked about different aftertastes or flavors but to me it tastes the same as other bottled waters, even when drunk back to back. If this is healthier than just drinking water it's a great option - no calories, no added ingredients to give flavor, etc. Basically just water with hidden health benefits.

review/summary: Alkaline Water - Yes it is
review/text: A blind taste test was conducted among three members of the family ranging from 8 to 49 years of age. We used Poland Spring bottled water and Essentia 9.5 ph water, both cooled to identical temperatures. No family member was able to tell the difference in taste. Comments ranged from, "It's water, right?" to "Did you put the same thing in both glasses?" So...it looks and tastes like water.<br /><br />We next tested the pH using materials drawn from a 40 year old Gilbert Chemistry set. Remarkably, the Essentia water was, in fact, between pH 9 and 10, quite a bit more alkaline than the Poland Spring or tap water, both of which proved to be neutral in pH. A phenolpthalein solution turned pink when mixed with Essentia water but remained clear with both the Poland Spring and tap water.<br /><br />A MedLine search did not reveal any evidence for studies that have definitively identified health benefits of alkaline water. One study indicated that patients with metabolic acidosis due to renal failure may benefit from alkaline water, but human studies are still necessary to demonstrate any real value.<br /><br />Some individuals may enjoy using this water to mix with concentrated orange juice for a low-acid product. Drinking it alongside a high-acid meal such as a meal containing tomato sauce may reduce heartburn/reflux. Your mileage may vary. Otherwise, I'd be concerned about the potential negative impact of drinking large quantities of alkaline pH water without neutralizing it in advance. I don't see that any long term studies have been conducted to demonstrate safety of high volume intake of alkaline water.<br /><br />But for occasional use, this tastes just like any other bottled water.

review/summary: Good drinking water, need more information about the health claims
review/text: With packaging which indicates Essentia water has been purified and that electrolytes have been added "for taste", the foundation for the health benefit ("boosts the antioxidant properties of your immune system") of this water over filtered tap water or other bottled waters is unclear.  Taste is, of course, personal, and to me this water tastes like tap water!<br />I just used it in my water bottle during a run, and can't say I noticed any increased endurance on my usual course.<br />All that said, with Amazon Prime, a dozen 1-1/2 liter bottles can be delivered to your door, without additional shipping charges, for less than $30., which would be a reasonable price for ordinary tap water, so there's no reason not to choose Essentia, so long as you don't have unreasonable expectations for its health benefits.

No chemical tastes, no salty taste, just very refreshing water. I like the large size of the bottles, as carrying one of these as I go out would guarantee I meet my water quota for the day. I poured some for my five year old granddaughter and she said, "You have good water at your house, Granny." so I guess there is a difference. When it's good, it's good!

review/summary: Good pH Water, So So Taste
review/text: I don't know that there is anything about Essentia's taste that will wow you.  It is high pH, as in its alkaline water, and it is purified.  On the other hand its municipal tap water, apparently from a variety of municipalities.<br />So, while it is probably good for you, as far as its pH and electrolytes, taste wise it is just OK.  It doesn't have that "clean" taste familiar to those who drink spring waters.  Instead it tastes like what it is, tap water.<br /><br />You may indeed notice a "silky" taste - it has sodium bicarbonate in it.  That's baking soda to you and me.<br />I am not sure exactly why the sodium bicarbonate is in it, since Essentia advertises that they use electrolysis to split the water into negative (alkaline) and positive (acidic) ions.  It may be that the sodium bicarbonate is meant to support the stabilized pH or aid the electrolytes.<br /><br />Either way, if I want baking soda in my water, I'll add it myself.<br /><br />IThe bottle size is nice, about the equivalent of three "individual size" (16.7 ounce) water bottles.  So this is something you can drink over a few hours, or during physical activity to replenish lost fluids.  At the same time, the bottle is not so large as to make it a problem to bring with you.<br /><br />If you are looking for alkaline water, this might be a good purchase for you.  If you are buying water purely for superior taste, this isn't anything special.<br /><br />Overall, it is what it is advertised to be.  I am a little put off by the baking soda content, but other than that, it's OK.

review/summary: HIgh pH (alkaline) Water has bland taste
review/text: Water is normally neutral pH. Distilled water is 7, making it neither an acid (low pH) or a base (high pH). For a few years high pH water has been touted as improving performance and being better than neutral pH water. The highest pH of these waters is 9.5, just like Essentia.<br /><br />I can't say that this water improved anything, but I can say I wasn't impressed. The label said nothing about it being alkaline water just proclaimed the pH. This sent me running to the Internet to find out more about that measurement and what it meant. It would have been nice to have had a little more information on the label.<br /><br />You might think that with a bottle of water you would have a short list of ingredients. Pretty much I'd like to see a list of one: water. But not so with Essentia. After filtering their water by reverse osmosis, essentially the process a Brita filter uses, they up the pH, I assume, by adding a bunch of bases.<br /><br />But unlike mineral waters and many other bottled waters, they do not include a mineral analysis, so you don't know what's in there. All you know is that they have been added.<br /><br />The label didn't make me happy because I felt as if they were being stingy with information. While by buying in bulk on Amazon, I might be able to see more information, I can't see it in the store.<br /><br />But what about the taste?<br /><br />As you would expect from something with a high pH, the taste was flat and dull. I trued it cold & at room temperature, with & without ice. The taste actually improved when my tap water ice melted.<br /><br />Unless you want or like alkaline water, don't bother.

review/summary: Great for those on an Alkalinian Diet
review/text: I used to think that all water tasted the same. As in it was all tasteless. Then I went through a pregnancy where I had a very highly sensitive sense of taste and the taste of tap water made me sick. It was embarrassing and I felt stupid lugging bottled water everywhere but only room temperature bottled water was tolerable. I wish I'd known about Essentia at the time because it is the only bottled water I ever tried that I literally could not taste. It's absolutely weird.<br /><br />I first discovered Essentia through my extended family (mom, grandmother, and aunts) who were all trying to improve their health through the Alkaline 'diet'. They tried to convert me to it but talk about an expensive lifestyle change. It wasn't for me but the only water they'd drink was Essentia which got complicated when I had them all for a visit and had to go to a specialty store for it. Having now given it a try I can see why they preferred it but unless I were going to go Alkaline (or experience another pregnancy with the crazy highly sensitive tastebuds) I don't think I would be that concerned with choosing Essentia over another, less costly, bottled water option.

I understand that the main focus of this water is the effects of alkaline pH on performance and wellness, but I would need to drink this product over a longer period of time to evaluate any personal differences I might experience.<br /><br />Health benefits are so individualized that basically one has to try a product for themselves to evaluate the outcome. The product is priced right. Unfortunately, the mouth feel and strange aftertaste will prevent me from doing that.

However, I have to be honest and say that I loved the smooth taste of this water. I can't really speak to the "healthiness" of it, but on pure taste alone, I would buy this water for a refreshing drink. The normal metalic or plastic taste of bottled water is not present here (at least I couldn't perceive it) and the water is so smooth! This is stating the obvious, but it tastes better cool or cold and when it's at that temperature, I could not detect any aftertaste. I would buy Essentia at my local convenience store if they carried it!

review/summary: Delicious, soft water that seems to work well as an unsweetened Gatoraid substitute
review/text: When I tasted the Essentia water, I thought it had a smooth, soft taste. Not a crisp water; more earthy and gentle. It is very easy to drink, and tasty.<br /><br />I didn't just want to taste it and review it, though. I put it through its paces. The first thing I did was pick a hot, muggy summer day to test the electrolytes. I spent some time at the beach, in the sun, walking around. While I always love spending time at the beach, I usually get a headache from a combination of sunglare, heat, wind and inadequate hydration. Even if i bring plain water, I tend to get low enough in electrolytes by the end of the day that a minor headache comes on.<br /><br />I kept the Essentia by my side, drank most of the 1.5 liter container, and got through the day and evening comfortably. That is a real plus in my book, since I don't like sweet drinks like Gatoraid or energy sodas. This was a super easy way to drink water and keep my electrolytes up.<br /><br />With the rest of my Essentia, I decided to gather as many waters as I could and do a larger scale taste test. In front of me I have: Essentia, Function (with electrolytes, from CVS), Kirkland (from CostCo), Crystal Geyser (bottled in the Sierras), R/O water from my parent's filtration system, and plain Southern CA tap water.<br /><br />These are all flat waters, not sparkling. They are all at room temperature. The first two are electrolyte waters, and Kirkland's water has added minerals (for taste, the bottle says). And really, those three taste the absolute best. More on those in a minute.<br /><br />The Crystal Geyser water has the least amount of "taste" than the other three bottled waters. It is a little...flat? Boring? Staid? This isn't like wine tasting, so I am searching around for the words to describe the different tastes of water. This one just tastes like nothing more than "wet".  Arrowhead, which I often drink at home, has this same unexciting non-taste. Not bad, not exceptional.<br /><br />The reverse osmosis filtered water is tastier. It is a step above those forementioned  "mountain stream" advertised waters. It is softer and rounder and more enjoyable in the mouth.<br /><br />The tap water is...ok, blech. Don't drink the tap water in So Cal unless you have to. My parents don't even use it in their coffee.<br /><br />Back to the top three waters, Essentia, Function and Kirkland all have added items. The added "minerals", in all three cases, are sodium and/or phosphate bicarbonates. Baking soda, mainly. Also magnesium and calcium source minerals. This is interesting, since Kirkland is not advertising their water as an electrolyte replacement fluid. My guess is that Kirland may not have as much electrolyte particulates by volume? Or it could be the same darn thing in each. If anyone wants to call these compankes and find out, I'd love to know.<br /><br />Which of these three top waters tastes the best? Essentia, to my palate. It is almost creamy, very soft, very delicious. I would absolutely switch over to this brand if the price was right. However, if the Kirkland product was much cheaper, I'd stick to that one. It is still delicious. The Function brand is a little less round, somehow. Less zesty, as far as unflavored water can get. :-)<br /><br />I do recommend trying the Essentia, at least to see if you can taste a difference, since I don't think most of us get enough electrolytes in a day. Getting more can only be a good thing, and its easier than messing around with adding baking soda on your own.

It tastes good, the way good water is expected to taste with no aftertaste, it has no odors and it's crystal clear. This being said, I can't see myself paying more for 'water' than I would for the same amount of premium gasoline for as long as I can get 'almost as good' out of my well for 99% less even when I factor in the cost of the filters.<br /><br />Price aside, consider me impressed.

review/text: Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:<br />*** Somewhat recommended, with reservations and only lukewarm fuzzies.<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />+ Not too expensive compared to other bottled water, although it is not cheap either.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />- This bottled water product's labeling, product descriptions, and health claims are misleading.<br /><br />At first glance, this 1.5-liter bottle of water that I am reviewing looks like another one of the many varieties of bottled water on the market.  There are many kinds of bottled water: "spring water" produced from an underground formation where the groundwater naturally flows up to the Earth's surface, "artesian water" obtained from a well that taps into an underground aquifer, "mineral water" produced from a well or spring that naturally contains trace amounts of minerals that some people consider to provide health benefits, "ground/well water" produced from a well that tapes into an aquifer, "sparkling water" from a spring or well that is naturally carbonated, and "purified water" produced by distillation, deionization, reverse osmosis, or other purification processes.  This Essentia Drinking Water is "purified water"; this bottle contains municipal water (i.e. tap water that comes from your faucet) that is purified using reverse osmosis and ultraviolet light for disinfection.<br /><br />The label on this Essentia water bottle is filled with marketing hype and technical terms designed to make it sound exotic:<br />* "Infused with Electrolytes For A Difference You Can Taste"<br />* "Silky Smooth Taste"<br />* "Hydrates Better"<br />* "Electrolytes Infused"<br />* "Best Available pH at 9.5"<br />* "Doctor recommended to protect, improve, and enhance the quality of your health."<br />* "Our Proprietary Technology: Water purified by reverse osmosis; infused with electrolytes for taste; alkalinized and restructured using Ionic Separation Technology."<br />* "Ingredients: purified water, sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, calcium chloride."<br /><br />There are two ways to evaluate this water product.  One way to review this water is based on how it tastes, how safe are its added ingredients, and its cost.  Since Essentia includes a variety of health claims and marketing statements on the water bottle's label, on the Amazon product listing, and on the company's Web site, the veracity of this statements must also be scrutinized since the marketing hype of most other brands of bottled water is just limited to the "freshness" or "purity" of their taste without making other health-related claims.<br /><br />First, on the basis on its cost, with all of its marketing hype and hoopla, at least this water is not priced far more expensive than most other brands of bottled water.  But there are various other bottled water products on Amazon that cost less on a per-liter basis.  And if you think that this slightly pricey water can be justified based on its health "merits", keep reading...<br /><br />As for taste, that can be a highly personal preference, but I like my water to simply taste "wet".  :-)  If I want some kind of flavored drink - tea, wine, beer, fruit juice, etc. - I will drink that instead.  But nothing hydrates and quenches as easily as pure and simple water, with no additives or flavorings added to it.  This particular Essentia water does have a smooth texture to it.  Most other bottled waters taste more crisp than this Essentia water.  Again, you may either like the smooth texture of this water or you may think that its texture is rather flat and bland.  Unlike drinking "distilled water", or bottled water that was purified using distillation with no additives, this water has a very slight subtle aftertaste that might be considered as either "chalky" or "metallic".  Those are my highly subjective adjectives that I associate with this water.  I can only surmise that this is due to the small amounts of additives that were used in this water.  This aftertaste is not too objectionable, but if I just want to hydrate myself drinking "water", I really prefer my water to be without any identifiable taste, texture, or odor.<br /><br />Next, since this is not just a bottle of pure H2O water, let's consider what was added to this water: sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, and calcium chloride.  Sodium bicarbonate is the same thing as baking soda.  This water was made to have a slightly alkaline pH of 9.5 by adding sodium bicarbonate.  People sometimes also adjust and raise the pH of their swimming pool water by adding sodium bicarbonate.  Dipotassium phosphate is sometimes added to various food products as a buffering agent or emulsifier.  In this water, it serves as one of the "electrolytes" that is added.  The term "electrolytes" is just a subset of minerals that are found in both the Earth and the food that we eat.  Also serving as an electrolyte is the addition of magnesium sulfate.  Magnesium sulfate is sold in drug stores as "Epsom Salt", and you can either soak your feet or body in an Epsom Salt bath to soothe sore muscles, or when ingested in larger quantities, magnesium sulfate also can serve as a laxative.  Calcium chloride serves as another electrolyte in this water.  Calcium chloride is sometimes used as a food additive.  The trace amounts of calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus in this water do not qualify as a measurable part of your daily nutritional intake of these minerals, regardless of how much of this water you drink each day.<br /><br />Essentia is definitely not the first bottled water manufacturer to add electrolytes to either bottled water or drinks.  During the 1960s, Gatorade was possibly the first large-scale commercial drink that was produced with the goal of adding electrolytes of sodium, sugar, potassium, and phosphate to hydrate and replenish athletes who lost fluids during physical exertion in hot weather.  On Essentia's Web site, they have an FAQ question/answer of: "Why should I drink Essentia if I get my electrolytes through sports drinks?  Essentia provides a blend of dissolved minerals that emulate the ratio of the body's own mixture and concentration - providing the correct proportion of electrolytes without all the sugars and other additives you typically find in sports and energy drinks."  There are several problems with that statement.  First, if you are actively exercising and sweating, your body can actually use those extra calories, and if you are just sitting in front of the computer or television, guzzling Gatorade just adds useless calories and electrolytes.  Second, if you are drinking Essentia at home, this product's claim that it provides "the correct proportion of electrolytes" implies a one-size-fits-all balance of electrolytes, which is simply not true as we all have different bodies, diets, and lifestyles.<br /><br />None of what Essentia refers to as "Our Proprietary Technology" is really that "proprietary" or exotic.  The reverse osmosis purification of municipal tap water is commonly used to produce bottled water, and the addition of various electrolytes or minerals to water has been practiced by other bottled water manufacturers for many decades now.  Some people think that drinking plain distilled water tastes boring and, mentally at least, they like the idea that drinking water that is naturally infused with minerals from a spring or well/aquifer adds an extra measure of health benefits.  The addition of trace minerals do add noticeable flavor that mimics natural spring water.  Also, slightly flavoring the water with minerals masks the residual odors that can be left by the plastic water bottle; the plastic odor is still there, but you notice it less.  The same principle applies to using a room deodorizer to mask the existing odors in a house; that old cat urine smell is still present inside the house, but you notice it less and therefore the house smells fresher.  The most common electrolytes/minerals in spring water are calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, sulfate, and chloride.  The Coca-Cola company markets a "Dasani" bottled water that, like this Essentia, is municipal tap water purified via reverse osmosis.  Dasani has magnesium sulfate and potassium chloride added to it.  Perhaps the Dasani taste testing panels decided that their water tastes better without the addition of calcium?  But for whatever reasons, this Essentia water has a slight residual "chalky" or "metallic" aftertaste, as if it had a tannic undertone like the aftertaste after drinking a dry red wine, that I do not really care for.  I do not want my drinking water to leave a subtle aftertaste in my mouth.<br /><br />Essentia also competes directly with "Glaceau Smart Water", which takes an approach similar to Essentia's water.  Glaceau Smart Water is municipal water purified via distillation, and then infused with the similar ingredients of calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, and potassium bicarbonate.<br /><br />Not to be outdone, another of Essentia's alkaline/electrolyte water competitors, named "NEO Water" (to ride on the futuristic coattails of "The Matrix" fame??), pumps out even more junk science drivel filled with fear-mongering misleading statements, calling itself "Alkaline, Electrolyte, Antioxidant Super Hydrator ... ultra purified healthy and refreshing water formulated through proprietary technology to balance, revitalize and propel you unlike any traditional water", and "NEO's unique antioxidants neutralize free radicals the body releases when under exertion".  But when you really dig further into NEO Water's claims, there are *NO* antioxidants in NEO Water... just potassium bicarbonate, calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, which is similar to the mundane chemicals added to Essentia and Dasani water.  NEO Water's marketing nonsense says that its "alkalinity allows its molecules to carry more oxygen than normal with an extra attached electron (hydroxyl ions). As a result, these molecules are able to seek and neutralize free radicals in your body and prevent free radical damage to your cells. These natural antioxidant benefits leave your body rich in oxygen and energy."  Again, like Essentia, NEO Water hopes to blind and persuade the consumer by overwhelming you with exotic totally false techno-babble; it ascribes its antioxidant benefits entirely to its 9.5 pH alkalinity.  So if you really believe in this nonsense, you could, in theory, obtain far more amazing antioxidant protection simply by dissolving an antacid tablet into your tap water once a day.  As with Essentia's water, NEO Water's "ultra purified" water is simply municipal tap water purified using the common method of reverse osmosis.<br /><br />This Essentia Drinking Water is not the first product to tout the benefits of "alkaline water".  There have been previous highly-hyped products based on ionized water, alkaline water, and combination alkaline-ionized water.  There have even been so-called "liquid oxygen" drops that supposedly contained "O4" molecules (instead of the "O2" oxygen that is in the air) dissolved in a liquid, and by ingesting 10 drops each day, you feel more energized, but this quackery completely ignores the fact that oxygen is best utilized in the lungs, and not in the stomach.  Just as the "liquid oxygen" drops are a distorted version of twisted junk science based on the concept of oxygen bars (at least in oxygen bars, you do breathe in the oxygen instead of putting drops of useless oxygen in your stomach), this "alkaline water" concept is a distortion of the "alkaline diet" alternative medicine belief that the foods we eat can affect the acidity of urine and blood, which can then affect our well-being, susceptibility to disease, and energy level.  If you are an avid vegan/vegetarian practitioner of an alkaline diet, then this 9.5-pH alkaline water can keep your diet on its alkaline-based theme.  But if you regularly eat meats, poultry, seafood, dairy products, eggs, grains, processed sugar foods, and colas/sodas, all of which significantly boost the acidic levels of your food consumption, then drinking a slightly alkaline water makes absolutely no difference to your health.<br /><br />Your stomach has a healthily acidic pH that ranges between 1.45 to 3.5; your stomach must be very acidic to aid in digestion.  However, blood must always be slightly alkaline, with a pH of 7.35 to 7.45.  If the blood's pH drops below 6.8 (more acidic) or rises above 7.8 (more alkaline), death may occur.  But your blood automatically stays within its healthy pH range regardless of what you eat or drink because your blood utilizes several buffering systems.  The most important buffer for maintaining acidity/alkalinity balance in the blood is called the carbonic-acid-bicarbonate buffer.  To form the bicarbonate in this buffering system, your body uses carbon dioxide... guess what, carbon dioxide is in (over)abundance in the air that you breathe and you do not need sodium bicarbonate baking soda added to your drinking water to maintain a healthy pH in your body.  In fact, consuming too much supplemental sodium bicarbonate can actually lead to constipation, convulsions, diarrhea, frequent urination, and vomiting.  There is only a tiny amount of sodium bicarbonate in each bottle of Essentia water, so you do not have to worry about overdose.  But my point is that all this hoopla and hype about this water being of the "Best Available pH at 9.5" is purified nonsense.  Some other fear-mongering alkaline water sales gimmicks claim that, to quote another Web site, "Excess acidity weakens all our systems and forces the body to take minerals from vital organs and bones to buffer/neutralize the acid and safely remove it from the body."  But this is totally false fear-based junk science contrived to mislead you into thinking that your body will rob its vital organs and bones of minerals to neutralize excess acidity.  But our body's carbonic-acid-bicarbonate buffer simply combines carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air with water to make the blood plasma more acidic if it needs to, and it can prevent excess plasma acidity and raise its pH to be more alkaline by having the lungs convert the bicarbonate back into CO2 which you then breathe out.  A similar phosphate buffering system also helps to maintain the pH of cellular fluids, using phosphate instead of bicarbonate.  Phosphorus is present in nearly all foods, and regardless of whether you like to eat lots of meats or lots of vegetables, you can get plenty of sufficient phosphorus in your diet without needing to add it to your drinking water!<br /><br />Drinking too many acidic drinks such as sodas and colas can have a detrimental effect of eroding your tooth enamel, but guzzling all those colas have absolutely no effect on the pH of your cells and bodily fluids.  And regardless of how much alkalinity you consume and put in your stomach, your body is going to make sure that your stomach stays within a healthy acidic pH range and your body will use its pH buffering systems to keep your blood pH between 7.35 and 7.45 regardless of how much acidic or alkaline food and drink you consume. If you are familiar with logarithms, also realize that the pH scale is logarithmic (pH is not a linear scale) and drinking 9.5 pH water really has no effect on your various bodily fluids compared with drinking tap water or any other bottled water. And if you really could somehow artifically adjust your stomach, blood, and bodily fluids entirely to a 9.5 pH, you would be immediately wheeled into a hospital's emergency room because your body and its stomach cannot handle that kind of alkalinity.<br /><br />If you suffer from frequent heartburn or acid reflux disease (gastroesophageal reflux disease), drinking this 9.5 pH water will NOT help the least bit.  Your stomach acids need to constantly stay very acidic to maintain proper digestive functions, and the slight alkalinity of this water has no effect on the stomach acid that is entering into the esophagus of people with GERD.<br /><br />Trying to market bottled water based on its "silky smooth taste" and "hydrates better" claims, its over-hyped "9.5 pH" attribute, and all its overexaggerated health claims constitute marketing trickery to fool consumers by utilizing the "if you believe that it can really work, it does indeed work" placebo effect.  The placebo effect is a very powerful phenomenon that can frequently affect everything from clinical trials of pharmacological substances to faith healing.  Basically, if you have a hopeful mindset of expectancy and conditioning that makes you think that something will work, then that perception can become 100% of your subjectively observed reality and outcome of the treatment.  For examples of other placebo effects: If I told you that you can get stronger bones by breathing milk through your nose instead of drinking it through your mouth, or if I told you that you could be revitalized by just holding broccoli in your hands for two minutes every day instead of eating it, if you really believe or hope that to be true, then after breathing the milk into your nose or holding the broccoli in your hands, you may think to yourself, "Gee, I feel better, stronger, and more energetic after having done that!"  Likewise, if you really HOPE to feel more hydrated after drinking this Essentia water, you may actually feel more refreshed simply because you BELIEVE that this water is hydrating you better than drinking other sources of water, when in fact the tap water from your faucet could have hydrated you just as refreshingly.<br /><br />The Amazon 'Product Description' for this Essentia water falsely states even more overexaggerated health claims: "Essentia Water provides unmatched hydration, health benefits and smooth taste.  Its superior hydrating qualities come from a special electrolyte formula and optimal pH level of 9.5, which gives your body more of what it needs to thrive.  Drinking Essentia Water boosts the antioxidant properties of your immune system and helps bring your body back into balance.  It also helps maintain normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and more."  Again... these claims are way wayyyy overexaggerated!  Compared to your overall health, fitness level, and daily food diet, the trace minerals found in this water and this water's slight alkalinity really make no difference in boosting the "antioxidant properties of your immune system", nor does it "help maintain normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and more".  With this litany of false health claims, I am surprised that they also did not pile on claims that this water "increases libido, cures erectile dysfunction, grows hair on balding men, makes women sexy, and fixes the national debt" too.<br /><br />Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:<br /><br />I must admit that I personally do not regularly purchase bottled water for home use, even though I will sometimes buy it while I am away from home, both because I think that filtering my tap water through a Brita filter produces water that is just as tasty and healthy as bottled water and, just as important, I think that too much plastic (and petroleum) is used in the production of bottled water and most plastic bottles end up in our overflowing landfills.  Roughly 1.5 million tons of plastic is used to make water bottles.  And this does not include the energy used to make the plastic and the oil used for transporting all the bottled water.  It takes about two liters of water used during the production process just to make one liter of bottled water.  So behind each 1-liter bottle of water is another two liters of water that was expended during its production.  Essentia states that their plastic bottles are "safe and recyclable", but we can all reduce our carbon footprint if we drink less bottled water.  In many developing countries, tap water is either unavailable or unsafe, making bottled water a better option if residents cannot boil their tap water before consumption.  But here in the U.S., some bottled water manufacturers, including this Essentia bottled water, use fear-based advertising claims that their water is healthier than tap water, which it really is not.  The concerns for the taste of tap water are valid, however, especially with tap water that has residual smell or taste of chlorination.  But residual smells and taste issues can be easily and economically remedied by using various activated charcoal/carbon filters at home to treat your tap water.  Anyway, the tap water that comes out of my faucet at home is also slightly alkaline like this Essentia water, and many municipal water supplies are also slightly alkaline, so there is no need to purchase this bottled water that has baking soda added to it.<br /><br />This is not a bad bottled water.  It is priced competitively with other bottled waters.  But it has an odd aftertaste that I do not like.  And the techno-jargon claims that revolve around this water's selling points - 9.5 pH, "ionically separated water", "Infused With Electrolytes", and even falsely stating that this water boosts your immune system - amount to nothing but purified snake oil hogwash.  To quote William Shakespeare, all this marketing hype about 9.5 pH and electrolytes is really "much ado about nothing"!

review/summary: Over Hyped Bottled Water
review/text: The bottle says, "A Difference You Can Taste." For me that would not be a good thing. I don't want my water to taste like anything. Fortunately, this water disappointed...it tastes like, well, water.<br /><br />Now comes the problem. Essentia's Web site is full of hype, but what it comes down to is this: Essentia is filtered city water, just like Aquafina or Dasani...using essentially the same methods. I suspect the raise in pH is from the second ingredient, sodium bicarbonate, aka baking soda. I compared the water test results provided by Essentia on their Web site and those of my local water authority.<br /><br />Essentia says, "Electrolytes are dissolved minerals in the body that conduct electricity, such as calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium. We add trace amounts of those same elements in a formula that complements the body's naturally occurring mix and concentration." They must be really trace amounts. Reading their water test report, neither calcium or potassium are listed, and only .68 mg/l of magnesium. The sodium level is about the same as in my tap water. Certainly not the electrolyte levels of Gatorade.<br /><br />I can find nothing in my research that indicates a pH of 9.5 is anything special.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I'm not impressed. I often buy bottled water instead of soft drinks when traveling. If this were on the shelf in the mini mart, I would reach for the Poland Spring or Aquafina instead.

review/summary: Doesn't taste as good as some other waters
review/text: After drinking this for 3 weeks I see no health improvements. The taste is a little off to me. My Pur sink filter water tastes better. As for the higher ph the jury is still out weather it does any good or not. I did a lot of research and you can find both pros and cons. Some very respected Medical researchers say there is no way this water going into the acid stomach can do any good. I wanted to give it an honest try. Myself I prefer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CQWWKY">FIJI Natural Artesian Water, 16.9-Ounce bottle (Pack of 24)</a> You can get it here at Amazon and in my case it is considerably cheaper to do it subscription vs local purchase. It is the best tasting and I can feel the medical benefits of the silica.

review/summary: An options for runners who usually use a sports drink
review/text: The makers of Essential Water claim to deliver "unmatched hydration, health and taste."  I'm not sure it delivers all of those benefits, but it is a good option for runners like myself that don't want the calories from sports drinks, but need to hydrate and replenish their electrolytes while exercising.  That said, buyers should now that water comes from public water sources.<br /><br />- Source - The bottle says the water is "purified by reverse osmosis."  However, it doesn't mention where they get the water so I called the customer service department and asked.  I was told the water came from "municipalities"- in other words public water sources.  The person explained that "it doesn't matter where the water comes from, the only thing that matters is the purification process." I disagree.  I prefer water from natural springs.<br /><br />- Taste - I didn't discern any noticeable difference.  It tastes like the water I filtrate at home.<br /><br />- Size - It comes in a 50.72 oz bottle. I drink a lot of water through the day and usually have water at my desk.  I find an entire gallon too big to handle and a large cup too small.  I like this size because it doesn't take up too much room, but lasts me about 1/2 a day.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because it is cheaper than a sports drink and provides the necessary electrolytes during a run.  However, I wouldn't buy it to substitute another brand that uses natural spring water.

review/summary: Great alkaline water, 9.5pH
review/text: Got a bottle of this at my local Whole Foods market to try. It has a silky taste as it advertises and it is a great starting water for people -like me- who want to see if alkaline water can make a difference in how they feel and with stomach acidity. I liked it so much, I got a case from Amazon, delivered 2-days later with my Prime account (I love it!). I am slowly going through the case, one bottle every other day, sometimes everyday. I have to say that I have noticed a stamina related improvement but I will have to watch this for more days. I was away for 5 days not drinking it and my stamina was hampered so that is an experiment I can believe, but I need more proof. Tha page says bottles are BPA free but the label on the bottle has no such remark so I am not sure which is true. The price for the 12-case was just $20 when I bought them a few weeks ago, but now I see that Amazon has increased the pricing to $25. I will check with my local Whole Foods market and if price is lower for a case there, will not buy from Amazon the next time around -sorry Amazon.<br /><br />If you are now starting to get interested in an alkaline diet for improving your health, this is a great introduction along with several books on reducing the  acidity of food intake and stomach environment for all of us with GERD, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0982708319">Dropping Acid: The Reflux Diet Cookbook & Cure</a> which I also purchased.

review/text: This water tastes good, and after drinking it for a few weeks, it has most certainly helped with my indigestion and acid reflux.  I also feel like I can drink more of it without getting bloated than I did with Evian.  It tastes smooth and does well at quenching my thirst, better than some other bottled waters I have tried.<br /><br />I have now subscribed to a couple of cases of this direct from Amazon each month, as the price per liter works out less than I was paying for Evian from the store on a regular basis, and with a subcription, the shipping is always free.  Hard to beat that.<br /><br />Not sure why anyone would want to get same size bottles from the NutriCity listing for this on Amazon, as the price listed there is currently listed at $66.33, and no option to use amazon prime or to be able to subcribe and save.

review/text: The water came very quickly and in good shape.  It was quite a bit of water (maybe 40 pounds) to receive via free shipping.  From what I could tell by my own pH test readings it seemed to meet what was advertised.  As far as effect on urine pH testing I could not see any noticable difference from drinking the water.  As a minimum it was just regular bottled water, had no chlorine, and tasted OK, nothing remarkable.  I now have second thoughts about buying a product that leaves behind so many plastic bottles.  I have switched to another source of bottled water that does not require so many bottles.  I am also not so concerned about the pH aspects of the water.<br /><br />I will try pH buffering tablets, also adopting a diet that emphasizes alkaline producing foods vs acidic.

review/summary: Will drinking this brand make you drink more water?
review/text: Although the 1.5 Liter size is a bit too large to carry around conveniently, the water does taste good. What I liked about it was that it was not carbonated, it was smooth, and it did not leave an aftertaste.<br /><br />I really don't think that the pH of water is going to change your overall body health, but many like to think that the water they are drinking is pure and free of nonessential elements. The makers claim that Essentia has a special electrolyte formula but it is difficult to analyze this without a comparative chemical analysis.<br /><br />The important thing to remember is that getting plenty of fluid is very important to overall hydration. It is felt that water is the preferred fluid (vs soda, coffee, tea, alcohol, flavored drinks, gatorade, etc.) Drinking the proper amount of water, in addition to other beverages in moderate amounts, every day will help you to be more healthy and lose or maintain weight so make sure you know how much you need!<br /><br />Instructions to determine basic overall fluid need per day:<br /><br />  1)  Weigh yourself and write down your weight.<br />  2)  Take the number of pounds you weigh and multiply that by 2/3.<br />  3)  That is the number of ounces you should drink everyday. The conversion is: 30 mL to one ounce.<br />  4)  For example, if you weigh 150 pounds, two thirds of that is 100 and that is how many ounces you should drink daily. So that would be 3000 mL or 3 Liters of FLUID.<br />  5)  Add 12 ounces of water for every 30 minutes you work out.<br /><br />If you are under the care of a health care professional or have conditions that alter your fluid need from the average person, please seek advice.<br /><br />So, if drinking this particular brand of water helps to make sure you have adequate fluid intake because you like it more than tap water or other bottled water -- go for it!

review/text: Essentia water tastes just like my tap water (no metallic taste, no aftertaste).  What seems to set this apart from others is that it has a 9.5 pH.  I really didn't know what this meant, so I looked it up.  Apparently tap water typically has a 8.1 pH and some people need a higher pH for health reasons.  I didn't notice any difference in how I felt after drinking Essentia, but some might benefit from the higher pH.

review/summary: A Long drink of Water
review/text: This water is pleasant to drink, tasting clean and fresh.  I did not find it to be as smooth and silky as either Smart Water or Fiji water. Frankly, it was on par with the water that I pour out of my Brita Filter. It was palatable chilled and also made a nice cup of coffee.  Although the large size is nice to have on hand, I found the bottle unwieldy for anything other than in hyouse, in refrigerator use.<br /><br />As far as the health benefits claimed, I cannot confirm  that the ph is 9.5.  It is really just municipal tap water purified.  Drinking water is certainly beneficial and clean, purified water is better than the alternative. Would I buy it inlieu of juice or soda?  Sure.  Would I buy it over Smart Water or Fiji water?  Probably not.

review/summary: Zero difference from any other bottled water.
review/text: I don't understand all of the hype with this perfectly balanced 9.5pH water.  It tastes like all other bottled water I've had.  It isn't any smoother, doesn't taste any different and in the end, is just water.

review/summary: Premium water that you'd never be aware of without the premium price or label...
review/text: OK. Honesty time. I did a blind taste test between this water, some Nestle Ice Mountain bottled water (purchased at Meijer) and some Great Value bottled water (purchased at Wal-Mart). I couldn't taste any discernable difference between these waters, despite the difference in costs. They were all cold, wet, and refreshing.<br /><br />I finished this large 1.5 liter bottle of water in three sittings - all while watching TV or reading. I can't say that the water seemed any more refreshing or thirst-quenching than any other make of bottled water I've ever had. I realize that some effort was put into optimizing this water, but are the benefits REALLY discernable? Not to me. The difference is sort of like doing 24 push-ups or doing 25 push-ups. Either way, you're accomplishing what you want to do. I think the biggest difference is what you believe in your head. If that positive mental boost is enough for you, than go ahead and get this water. It certainly isn't going to do any harm, right? You'll just end up spending a bit more money. If you'd rather have the standard variety of bottled water and pay less money, do that. No harm in that route, either.

review/summary: Good recovery water, bph free etc but not wild about the taste
review/text: My spouse is training for a marathon so has been on a bit of a tangent about water, hydration etc...I also run and thought this would be interesting to give a try.<br /><br />The first thing you will notice is this is a big bottle! It's a nice sized but don't expect to fit this into the cup holder at the gym.<br /><br />BPH free - I've become much more aware of this growing problem and have taken pains to reduce/eliminate BPH products as much as possible.<br /><br />Vitamins and minterals - yet one additional nice touch without the sugar or other substitutes. Just plain energy and hydration without the harmful additions.<br /><br />Price - for a case of 12, the price is actually pretty good especially when compared to isolated bottles of water...most of which are not BPH free. It's also fairly equitable to sports drinks (filled with inferior sugar and chemicals).<br /><br />Taste - this is where we differed. The spouse tasted absolutely NOTHING whereas I felt it had a slightly salty type taste. Nothing major but just sufficient to be less than desirable. It is indeed "soft and silky"...very similar to water from my Big Birki filter. I like the fact that it's not filled with impurities.<br /><br />All in all, I would consider purchasing this above other water options and certainly above chemical/sugar laden sports drinks.

review/summary: tastes a little salty at first
review/text: I usually drink tap water and can only compare this to that experience. I used to drink city water which was treated with Chlorine which I would purify using a Brita water pitcher. That allowed me to review the harsher chemical elements from the taste. This water, since it is pre-filtered, lacks such chemical tastes out of the bottle, of course, but the first sip carried a salty taste reminiscent of bicarbonate of soda. This quickly dissipated and then it really didn't taste like much of anything, which is how water should be.<br /><br />Others have talked about a "silky" taste, but that is really about the mouth feel of the water (the equivalent of texture in food). If you are the sort of person who really attends to the experience of drinking water, this may be of value to you, but I think most people are drinking water for hydration, not for its taste or feel. The health benefits are something that I think one cannot measure. You can either take their word for whether or not the pH levels or electrolytes are helpful or not as it'd take a long term study to really know.<br /><br />If you're going to drink bottled water anyway, this would be a nice choice. If you are mixing water with other things and are sensitive to chemicals from other types of water purification, this may also be a good option. However, for most people, I'm guessing that they'd be just as happy with filtered tap water. I know that I will be.

review/summary: Good taste, but nothing special
review/text: The pH of this water is supposed to lead to health benefits, according to the bottle.  I sampled one bottle, drinking it over the course of the day, and while I can't say I noticed any difference in my health, I'm not sure how many bottles it would take to notice the results promised.  I did like the taste of it, very fresh and clean, but to be honest, it didn't really taste any different than the filtered water I get from my own fridge.  So while I liked it, at the end of the day it was water, and there wasn't anything special about it that would lead me to want to buy it rather than drinking my own filtered water for free.

review/summary: Smooth and refreshing
review/text: I love water and this water tastes great and is extra smooth. It is supposed to have a pH of 9.5 which makes it more alkaline which is much easier on our bodies and systems. I am a huge fan of alkaline foods such as salads and green juices, you can even get rid of indigestion by drinking some dissolved bicarbonate of soda in water. So, it is not surprising that this water actually has a small bit of bicarbonate of soda in the ingredients. This water has no after taste and is smooth and refreshing. It may be even better for hydrating because of the 9.5 pH. I would purchase this product in the future.

review/summary: Tastes neutral, benefits - not sure
review/text: I was curious to try this out and when I got from Amazon - had to do see how it feels.<br /><br />Taste - Tastes very neutral just like water filtered from my PUR filter<br /><br />Effects - I did feel good and refreshed - not sure if it is because of the high PH value or just the fact that water will make feel my good anytime.  It is very hard to make a definitive story on the effects of the water - the taste: Yes it is good.<br /><br />FYI some data:<br />  - Aquafina is 5.9 ph and Dasani is 7.4 (Source: google for "bottled water ph")<br />  - Coke & Pepsi are at around 2.25 (highly acidic)<br />  - Most fruits and veggies are acidic<br />  - Milk is slightly acidic<br /><br />In Summary,  If you believe that high ph water is good for you or if you are a follower of alkaline diet - go for it, This is a good product.

review/summary: It's Filtered Water with Baking Soda & Salt in It....
review/text: So according to Essentia's website, "Most bottled waters offer purity but not additional benefits. With Essentia, you get added electrolytes as well as a much higher pH level, providing superior hydration."<br /><br />I looked up the additional ingredients and found that it's pretty much filtered water with scant amounts of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) included.  In fact, each of the other additives (dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfat, and calcium chloride) are pretty much added salts.  Factoring that in with the 0s across the board for calories, sodium, carbohydrates, proteins, etc, you're really getting water with ridiculously scant amounts of mineral in it.  Will it make a huge difference in your life, such as giving you a better night sleep or amazingly clear skin?  Probably not - the placebo effect of you believing that you feel better will, though.  When it comes down to it, you can be chugging all this 9.5 ph water, but it won't matter much once you eat something...the acidity or the alkalinity will change immediately once you eat.<br /><br />When it comes to taste, the water actually tastes like the bottle water I chugged in China.  That said, it tastes like water, but with a metallic tinge to it.  It's not bad, but it's something I personally don't like tasting in my water.  If I had to say a water tasted "silky smooth", I would immediately turn to Voss water, but that's just me.<br /><br />All in all, it's still water, and if offered it, I would drink it.  But I do ding some stars for taste, hype, and cost.  It's probably cheaper to buy a reverse osmosis distiller over time - at least you can filter enough water the entire family!

review/summary: Excellent taste
review/text: I'm not smart enough to know enough about bottled water. I'm in the camp who believes that naturally filtered well water is the best.  Most bottled water strips the natural minerals out.<br /><br />However, there is somethign to be said about water being too acidic.  A higher pH would be the opposite, so in that regard this should make this water much better.<br /><br />Honestly I cannot tell the difference.  But I can say ther was no odor.  There was no bad aftertaste. But I cannot say if this is worth the price.

review/summary: better than flavored drinks
review/text: This water tasted better than some of the flavored vitamin type water drinks. But I find nothing to rave about the taste. I drank it at room temperature and used it during my kungfu class. Not familiar with the science of the 9.5pH and how that will affect the body long term. It did quench my thirst during a class which lasted a few hours. This water tasted like my tap water which is run through the fridge built-in filter. I did not see a difference in the two, however my 5 year old grandson said it tasted like plastic.<br /><br />It seems a sad state of affairs to me that we even have to bottle and sell water. I am old enough to remember our homes all having drilled wells that drew water from the aqua filter which runs under our island. It was free. TV was also free and much better quality. Now the aqua filter is being polluted by run off, making it necessary to filter water. I am hoping we don't get to a global state where water is more expensive and scarce than oil. Not making these remarks to be political or preach, just explaining my reasoning about how I feel about bottled water. I only buy it when I can't carry enough with me to get through a day, or a trip or other outing. I buy it instead of flavored drinks, or soda or energy drinks and I resent having to pay such a price for water and am sorry that we have to use so much extra packaging on basic items.

review/summary: Fair
review/text: I really didn't get much from this water.  To me it tasted like water I run through my own filter at home.  It has a pure taste which I didn't mind, but my wife hated it.  With the added stuff I would say this would be more for athletes who don't want to drink gatorade and the like.  For the average person I don't think this water cuts it.

review/summary: Tastes like water. Good water.
review/text: I wake up feeling dehydrated most mornings, so before hitting the caffeine, I want something truly thirst-quenching, preferably with electrolytes so it really helps. I tried this Essentia Drinking Water, nice and cold, and the taste was like any good drinking water; nothing odd in the slightest. I was able to jump up after that and start a long day, so it seems pretty good. If I'm going to spend money on bottled water, it might as well have a bit of something extra.

review/text: I drank this on ice after a workout. It was very crisp, cool, and refreshing! I am normally not a bottled water fan, they all seem to taste like the plastic bottle to me. But this product had a distinctive sharp CLEAN taste, like it was extra filtered or something. It tastes better than the filtered water coming out of the dispenser in my fridge.<br /><br />I would buy this!!! DELICIOUS and refreshing!

review/summary: Silky smooth taste???
review/text: I had to laugh at the product description. Those are the words to describe certain chocolates, not a water! Still, as a bit of a water taste snob, this is indeed great tasting water. We have well water that is absolutely vile to drink. I've found that there are great taste differences in bottled water, be it spring or filtered. I usually choose spring waters, but this product brings up the point that it can be produced anywhere, thus leaving a smaller carbon footprint.<br />PH levels in the body are a hot issue right now...the new 'mangosteen', if you will. There are products to raise the pH of your own water, which is normally in the 7 range. If you've been following the pH trend in health, this water is a terrific beverage option.
