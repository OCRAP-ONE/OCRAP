review/summary: Fantastic! ZSweet, Thank you!
review/text: Ok, I never usually write reviews, but this stuff is the best out there. I recently started the HCG Protocol and could not stomach Stevia as a sweetner no matter what flavor. I have never been a fan of ANY artificial sweetner until now. This is just as good or better then real sugar!! LOVE! Eating some on fresh fruit right now as I am typing. YUM!<br />Thank you! You're my hero!

review/summary: This is the perfect sugar alternative
review/text: We have used this product exclusively for the last 3 months and my family loves it! It does not have the after taste that is so common with other sugar replacements. It measures and tastes like sugar. If there was a negative with this item it would be the price but using it sparingly, the way we should use sugar, has been very effective. I must say that I did pay $17 for my first bag from a local health food store so, comparatively speaking, this is not that expensive. I would recommend this to anyone for use on or in anything that is usually sweetened with sugar.

review/summary: Nothing comes close!!!
review/text: I was amazed when I tasted this because I was in serious doubt about the high marks. I've never had a sweetener without an aftertaste... until now. I bake with it (carrot cake, muffins, etc), put it in tea and coffee and even make glazes for chicken wings and so forth. When I first opened it I literally took a pinch and put it on my tongue (to me that's the real straight-forward test) it tasted just like sugar! I am so excited to have found this and I've made it my sugar alternative, without question or competition. It's fantastic! I highly recommend it. I hear that for a small percentage of people it may cause some digestive issues but the website has the details. After trying it I shared it with my sister and mom and they both loved it and had no tummy troubles! At least give it a try - your taste buds will thank you! ;)

review/text: We have used this in baked goods and it is a fantastic substitute for table sugar. It's not quite as sweet as sugar, but we don't like our cookies, granola, muffins, etc overly sweet so the conversion works out perfectly for us. Highly recommend trying this product, especially if you are looking for a good tasting, lower carb alternative to sugar.

review/summary: The Best All-Natural Sweetener
review/text: I first started using ZSweet about 5 years ago when I got pregnant with my first child and became a super health-nut.  I had been using Splenda until then, but once I got pregnant and realized how important it was to watch everything that I ate (including the additives and chemicals), I went on a quest for a replacement.  I tried numerous all-natural sweeteners (which had to be one that I could cook with) and was disgusted by so many due to the awful aftertaste they left behind.  ZSweet (Granualted) is the only sweetener that I have found that does not have the horrible aftertaste and that you can cook with.  I will say that the packets have a bit of the aftertaste, so I don't use them, but the granulated ZSweet is very nice and I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Best -healthy and safe- sweetener!
review/text: This is a combination of 2 of the best sweeteners that are safe and do not raise blood sugar at all.  I highly recommend it.<br /><br />As some of you may know, most sugar alcohols that end in -ol will produce gastric upset. Erythritol has not upset me at all, even at higher consumption!<br /><br />It has no awful aftertaste, either. Stevia on its own without mixing has an awful aftertaste. By mixing stevia and erythritol, the aftertaste is eliminated!<br /><br />There are two unique tastes, though, that occur with z-sweet:<br /><br />1) a slightly cooling sensation-- not a taste, but a cooling. If you have had any of the other sugar alcohols, you will recognize it. It is often used in sugar free breath mints.<br /><br />2) a very minor peppery taste. I rather like it!<br /><br />I think this is the safest and the very best tasting natural sugar substitute out there. I have made a carrot cake and cream cheese frosting using it, and it was delicious! I intend to use it for more baking and frosting.

review/summary: Packets Differ From 1.5 Pound Package
review/text: I had been using Z Sweet in the little packets.  I found it tasted very good, but was looking for a better way to purchase it so I could use it in receipes, not just tea.  The 1.5 pound package of the product tasted different than the packet. It tasted like something I would not want to use. It may have been because the product in the packets I have been using is of a different texture, less grainy.  I don't know why a more grainy product would taste different to me, but it does.  I did not appreciate not receiving the type of product I had become used to.

review/summary: Good But Needs Help
review/text: It's a good base I like to start with, to save time. I use an Aldi's brand $20 electric ice cream machine, where you have to freeze the mixing container for 24 hours, instead of having to use rock salt and ice. If I had it to do over, I would have bought a better and bigger machine. However, it serves it's purpose. It works well for me, if I mix up half the contents of this packet with mostly 1% milk, using heavy or light cream for the last 1/8th cup. I also add a little over 1 tsp. peppermint liquid flavoring. Once I added both the spearmint and the peppermint, which turned out good. If you get too much, just add more cream or milk or both. I also add about 1/8 to 1/4 cup, semi sweet chocolate chips. Don't add too many. I'd also recommend grinding up the chocolate chips first. The consistency of the ice cream after 20 minutes is like a thick sorbet or soft serve, but not hard like ice cream. You can find the mix at Walmart for about $3. One packet makes 2 quarts. Walmart also sells the flavoring cheaper than my local grocers. I buy the McCormick peppermint and the spearmint is an off brand.

review/summary: Mixed reviews of real beef from our cat brothers
review/text: After reading up on cat nutrition, we ordered some of this and another high-end brand. Our 2 young cat brothers are used to Nutro and Friskies wet food, which makes up 50% of their diet (the rest dry).<br /><br />It looks similar in color and texture to ground beef, and is very sticky, like ground beef (but I'm guessing it's cooked).<br /><br />catinfo.org said Cowboy Cookout is formulated to mimic real mouse. Well, must be working, because our one cat took a half-can-sized slab, and ran with it dangling from his mouth like a trophy as I chased him around the house. Amazingly the huge chunk didn't fall apart until I caught him and he started to struggle. He kept doing this, I had to break it up so it doesn't stick together. So two thumbs up from him.<br /><br />The other cat wasn't a big fan, perhaps cause he's never had real beef (instead of beef byproducts?) - he kept stopping and looking around for something better to eat. He eventually finished his half-can, but took about 10 minutes to do so (during which I have to fight off his brother from stealing it).<br /><br />So make sure your cats like real beef, and the sticky consistency seems to make them take chunks from the bowl and eat it on the floor, which is messy. They don't do this with other wet foods. I will probably buy a chicken-based from Merrick next time.<br /><br />Edit: Changed to 5 stars, cause the only downside is your cat may not like beef, and I noticed it's the only can I've seen that doesn't appear to have a plastic (BPA) liner - bravo for that!

review/summary: It is like crack for my cat!!!!!!
review/text: This is my cat's FAVORITE flavor of food! When we first brought our cat into our home he was eating an all dry food diet. After plenty of research and disscusions we decided that we would rather him have a diet of wet food. Well as many people already know, switching a cat from dry food to wet food isn't always the easiest task. We tried with several flavors from Wellness (a brand similar to Merrick) but he just wasn't interested. Finally, we tried a can of Cowboy Cookout with him and he has never looked back since. This is a very healthy option and our cat goes crazy for it!!!

review/summary: Great but be careful when storing!
review/text: I bought these because I LOVE Merrick and I wanted my girls to try everything that is good for them and delicious at the same!<br /><br />This is the first time I bought Merrick treats although I've been buying raw hides and bones from them for years but thought I would give it a try since they looked like actual real sausages you would get an Italian deli and they do.<br /><br />When we got the box in I opened it right up because I was way too excited for the girls to try their new treats and I have to say they already new what was coming for them because once I was handed that box from UPS they were glued on me.<br /><br />They smell fantastic, taste great (for a dog treat), and they even look like the real deal except when you cut into them and the "meat" consistency you would be use to in a "human" sausage isn't there.<br /><br />Anyhow for my Labrador a full piece is fine but for my Toy size Fox Terrier a whole piece is way too much so I have to cut it into pieces and store the rest for a later time. Unfortunately I did not think of putting it in the fridge after I opened the single pack and the next time I went to grab it, it was covered in mold! I store them in the pantry so (dry/cool place) and I just put the rest in a Ziploc bag and it went bad.<br /><br />So if you plan on cutting pieces off make sure you put it in the fridge because a simple Ziploc bag won't do anything.<br /><br />Either than that these are amazing both my girls wiggle none stop from being super happy!

review/summary: Rather splendid Keemun blend
review/text: This is a blend of teas from a few different regional plantations. Overall the taste is a Keemun tea, but with very little of the pekoe flavors you would find in that type. This blend varies a little more than some of the other twinning teas in it's flavor, so you might get two tins that have decidedly different (yet tasty) flavors.<br /><br />You have no tea palate or still learning about loose teas? OK, no worries.<br />This is a mild blend. It has a very dry aftertaste, but the bitter has been mostly blended out. If you brew it weakly it can be a bit too bland. Overbrewed PoW avoids the bitter you often get, but the dry really can give it almost a pucker factor.<br /><br />This tea loves sweeteners. In the tea sweeteners such as all types of honey, or along side the tea in the form of cookies or cakes. If you like milk or cream, go light on that. There is little bitter to PoW and you can dilute the tea flavor right out on accident.<br /><br />This is not really a good tea for lemon or fruit extracts. It can be a bit bland as an iced tea for better or worse.<br /><br />- Fakin' It Chai -<br /><br />Prince Of Wales Tea<br />Mulled Wine/Cider spices<br />Honey<br />Half'n'Half<br />5-Spice powder (optional)<br /><br />Add 1 teaspoon Mulled cider/wine spices dry to your brewing pot with the Prince Of Wales tea leaves. Add your boiling water. (Once you learn the strength of your spices add a more or less to taste. When making this with Twinnings PoW I add half a stick of good cinnamon broken into bark bits, this tea can take the bite without getting overpowered.  )<br /><br />Pour the tea<br /><br />Add a spoon of honey stir thoroughly.<br /><br />Add little half'n'half or heavy cream to the cup.<br /><br />A dash of 5-spice powder on top. Stir again and serve.<br />[...]<br /><br />-----=======-----<br /><br />Another reviewer gives a false info here, I hope they just accidentally mixed up products. This is a black only tea. A blend of black teas from China (Camellia sinensis leaves -only-). There is no green tea species nor currants in the Prince of Wales product.

The tea is smooth, subtle, complex and richly satisfying, with a balanced leafy and floral flavour and the lightest hint of smoke.  It's the kind of tea that you can really explore with your taste buds, and I find it completely satisfying on its own, without any dessert accompaniment.<br /><br />A bit of milk and sugar bring out the flavour, especially if you brew it strongly.<br /><br />Since Twinings discontinued Russian Caravan (at least in Canada), this has become my favourite Twinings tea.  If you like keemun, you'll like this tea.  If you can't find Prince of Wales, then just get a good keemun.

review/text: this is okay.  i've always wanted to try tea leaves and thought thiswas a great deal since prince of wales tea is my favorite.  i found this only okay.  the tea is very powdery so when i'm making tea i see to get small leaves in my tea all the time.  when i got tea leaves at a store they were much better.  i was glad i tried this, it is stronger than bag tea like everyone says, but overall it is messier and not worth the extra effort

review/summary: Jerky Fans will Love this
review/text: I have tried every GoldenValleyNatural.com Jerky product.  By far the best are all the Sweet N'Spicy and Peppered Flavors.  Beef tends to be smoky and fatty, while Turkey is dry and flaky, making their Buffalo meat varieties the best of them all.<br /><br />Avoid their Low Carb Jerky unless you are willing to bite off tic-tac size bites and chew for a minute each time.  All the Teriyaki Jerkys have the texture and taste like sweet Corned Beef, so I'd skip them as well.<br /><br />If you want to try different flavors, instead of 8 of the same from Amazon, just go directly to their web sight and buy them for only 15% more than Amazon's sale price.

review/text: Ok I have to say I am baffled by the numerous negative reviews of this Jerky.<br /><br />It is wonderful, tastes great, lower sodium than other turkey jerkys, and perfect for snacking.<br /><br />I read almost all of the reviews before I decided to order it, usually I have purchased the Jacks brand in the past, in my opinion Golden Valley is far better.  I also read people saying they received very hard/chewy pieces of jerky?  I had a few tougher pieces here and there but for the most part all of it was soft and just the way turkey jerky should be.<br /><br />Highly recommend this to anyone -- don't let the negative reviews sway you.<br /><br />Great jerky.

review/summary: Great product, excellent flavor
review/text: I bought this jerky to satisfy a craving that has long been neglected. There used to be a local company in San Diego called Smitty's jerky, and he made the best peppered jerky ever. They disappeared for some reason and that left those of us that were his fans in the dark.<br /><br />Now on to the real review... I ordered this based on reviews here at Amazon, and figured I'd give it a try. The turkey jerky is literally exploding with flavor, and is so tender that it requires no more effort to chew than an oven-cooked turkey. I order 8 bags and they were gone in just a matter of a few days. I even shared a bag with co-workers, and everyone raved about how surprisingly good this product was.<br /><br />Without question or hesitation, I would highly recommend this to anyone who even remotely enjoys jerky.

review/summary: Sugar in the Jerky
review/text: Short and Sweet:  this jerky is quite sweet, compared to commercial jerky.  In a one ounce portion, there are seven (7) grams of carbohydrates.  For those on a low-carb diet, that is a significant amount.<br /><br />I notice that in the more "natural" jerkies, they tend to use more sugar.  Perhaps it helps the texture and make the jerky a little less likely to dry out.<br /><br />It does show this on the label, which Amazon makes available, so don't make the same mistake I did and buy impulsively.<br /><br />If you are trying to find a beef jerky without preservatives, and from animals raised without antibiotics, etc, then this product is acceptable, if a little sweet.  But if you are on a high protein diet, avoiding carbohydrates, then beware.

They sell this at the local "green" grocery store here at much higher rates.<br /><br />Everyone I know who has tried this brand loves it. It's not dry and tough like some others; the texture is just tender and moist enough to overcome typical jerky flaws. The blend of spices are quite good, even though there's a slight sweet taste. Normally I would hate even the slightest hint of sweetness in a product like this, but somehow it works.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this product highly enough.

review/summary: The Worst I've Ever Eaten
review/text: I started a low carb. diet and have been trying different brands of turkey jerky.  Golden Valley Natural Turkey Jerky "BLACK PEPPER" was by far the worst I have ever tasted.  I've never left a review about any product I've purchased, good or bad, but I had to say something about this. It literally tasted like candied meat. It has 6 grams of carbs per serving (all from sugar)....double that of any other I've found.  Why would any company put so much sugar in a turkey jerky labeled black pepper?  They should have just called it brown sugar turkey jerky.  I threw it in the trash and got a refund from Amazon.  Amazon truly is an incredible company and I will continue to make purchases via their venue, but this turkey jerky......?

At least to us.  We finally got on the regular shipment plan to save 15% per month.  Yay, Amazon.<br /><br />[Time passes]<br /><br />Hmmmm... I am starting to suspect there are two versions of this product.  One you buy in the health food store and pay top dollar for... and this one.  I have never had an issue with quality control with this product before.  However, with this multi-pack I am finding that in every pouch there are a couple/few pieces that should have not made it past inspection - cut too thick to eat without soaking and/or too grisely to consider worthy of this price.<br /><br />So, hopefully it was just a few bag bags and maybe that's been straightened out.  But I hope this is not the new version.  We really do love this stuff- the high quality product we are used to, not the thick, grisely version.

Because the price for this turkey jerky is pretty low, it makes it worth it, but it could be improved by being less sweet. It's not as bad as he beef, but still too sweet. Texture and meat quality were good, but not excellent.

review/summary: Probably the Best Turkey Jerky EVER!
review/text: I have had a love affair with Turkey Jerky for a long time, but as I have gotten wiser and started paying more attention to the foods I put into my body, I stopped buying it at the grocery store: it all has MSG and high fructose corn syrup and artificial color, et cetera, added.  Not this stuff!  And from free-range, hormone-free turkeys, too!  The whole family loves it. We've been giving my son beef jerky to help cut his teeth and thought this might be a bit too peppery for him ('cause it is a bit peppery), but he really seems to like it (granted, I ate nothing but Mexican food when I was pregnant with him & later when breast-feeding, so he's fairly accustomed to spicy foods).  And when you sign up for the automatic shipments, i think the price is quite reasonable for an organic and healthy snack food.

review/summary: Another winner from Golden Valley
review/text: This is delicious jerky. It's high in protein, softer and chewier than other brands, and it's relatively low in sodium for a jerky. It's easy to pack for snacks or lunches.  It keeps well so I buy it by the case and munch for a while. The Teriyaki flavor is a little bit greasier than the Original flavor, but that's only in the bag; once it's out, I don't notice. Excellent product for the whole family.

review/summary: Not bad.
review/text: A popular product in my household for years has been the teriyaki turkey jerky from the local warehouse store, so I selected this as a natural, free range, no-chemicals alternative. I'm giving it a 4 star rating, because it's good, in fact it's very good, but it's a little bit drier, a little less consistent, and not quite as flavorful as the brand we are used to.

review/summary: Horrible and moldy
review/text: This was the worst jerky I have every had in my life.  The first package was okay, but the next couple of packages tasted a little 'off', almost stale. How can jerky taste stale? Well, apparently it can if it gets moldy.<br /><br />Now, I have eaten a lot of jerky in my life.  I've made jerky. Properly prepared, jerky should not get moldy. I have never, ever had turkey jerky get moldy in an unopened package. But we found mold on the next package we opened, and by the time we got to the next one, it was covered in mold. These were stored in a dark, cool, dry place. We ended up throwing away the rest.<br /><br />I am glad that neither my family nor I got food poisoning from this stuff. Do not buy!

review/summary: Good Stuff
review/text: Not the biggest of mate drinkers and I've never liked any brand I've tried before this, but I keep trying because I like the IDEA of mate.<br /><br />This stuff was downright drinkable - I actually look forward to a cup. Possibly it is a bit on the powdery side for folks who want their tea strained clear of bits, but I've never cared about a little roughage in my tea, so it seems fine to me. I had no difficulty detecting the added spices and I enjoyed them. This stuff is definitely worth a try if the idea of a flavored mate doesn't send chills up your spine.<br /><br />I've purchased a few things from Davidson's over the past few years and I appreciate the no-nonsense packaging and the promptness when shipping. Never had a problem with the vendor.

review/text: This is my first mate outside of Teavana and it's delicious.  Very earthy, tastes strongly of roasted cinnamon.  Not sure why the other reviewer didn't taste cinnamon, it's the dominant note in my batch at least.  Mate is also very high in anti-oxidant, slightly higher profile than green tea, although different antioxidants than green tea for those who care.  Recommended highly, great value.

review/summary: Wonderful value, very earthy taste
review/text: Never having had M&aacute;te tea I had no idea what to expect. I found it made my stomach a little upset, but my husband drinks a couple of cups every morning. It has a very earthy taste, and we've tried a variety of ways of preparing this tea. Our favorite is to pour very hot (not boiling) water over 4-5 level teaspoons in a large french press. We then let it steep overnight. It doesn't get bitter, and after reading that in South America people just add a teaspoon or so of leaves every day to their already steeped tea leaves, we tried that as well. It works fine both ways, either with making it fresh daily or adding a bit of leaves and steeping again with some more leaves added.<br /><br />It is very good served over ice with a packet of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV8HMQ">Stevita Stevia Supreme 50/Box from Stevita</a>.

review/summary: Goodness inside
review/text: For taste this tea is excellent, with the cinnamon and orange peel it has a very distinct mild flavor (my bag does not list any other ingredients). The pairing with cinnamon which is very high in anti-oxidants makes the tea even more healthy.<br /><br />After emailing the company I found out that Davidson's uses a smoke free drying process (unlike many traditional methods). This makes the tea even more beneficial: Mate tea has been linked to cancer prevention, particularly the tea that's dried smoke free. I give Davidson's big points for their awareness of this issue, as well as their focus on organic methods and sustainability.<br /><br />Overall this makes this tea very affordable and good for you both inside and out.

review/summary: no lemon. not much green tea
review/text: If you're looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea, it's probably not a good idea for you to purchase this (especially 6 boxes of it). The tea's flavor is dominated by ginger, and some lemongrass, with barely any green tea taste. That's right, not lemon, but lemongrass. Not exactly what one might expect from a product titled "lemon ginger green tea." It doesn't necessarily have a bad taste, just an unexpected one. If I want my tea to have more of a green tea flavor, i prepare this with another plain green tea bag.

review/summary: Great Green Tea and Great Company!
review/text: This is a great decaf green tea. I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family.  I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.  After some research, I found out that there are several "natural" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using "natural" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.  It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste.  I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty. I am impressed with this tea and company and will continue to order from them.

review/summary: Excellent Green Tea from a real Tea drinker!
review/text: I have had the pleasure of exploring and experimenting with Green tea for the last five years. During that time, I believe that I have sampled the gamut of options on the market today. From rare, true Gyokuro tea from Kyoto, Japan at a friend's home which cost over $500USD/lb to cheap generic Sencha. I have had the pleasure to seek out various types of green tea from Lung Chung, Putuo Fo Cha and many others. I am always searching, tasting and learning about tea and its amazing health benefits.<br /><br />However, I was looking for something both readily available, cost effective and of excellent quality. Not an easy combination of traits at all considering my experience. I settled on the Stash brands of Teas and this version being the organic version was just pennies more than the non-organic green tea version from Stash. After researching, I discovered that this tea is grown and processed not in Japan but Brazil, yet from my personal experience, it rivals the Japanese tea leaf for leaf.<br /><br />The warm, rich tea that is produced after a moderate boiling temperature is very refreshing. Personally, I steep for about 3 minutes today and then allow it to rest up to a mild warm temperature where you can truly start tasting the mild notes of organic flavor. There is no taste of excessive tannins, bitterness, nor rough processing that comes through in its flavor. It is quite purely, an excellent tasting, fresh & mild form of green tea. Very enjoyable and surprising! :)<br /><br />Color is medium green to very slight brown in cup. Expected since this tea is not produced in the traditional "Gyokuro" shade growing and yielding techniques, but it is actually very flavorful and easy to drink. (Even for new green tea drinkers who might be turned off by some of the most traditional blends) --- something I cannot say for some of the more expensive Green teas. They can be quite hard to get used to at first!<br /><br />I can add nothing else but to note that for the price and for the fact that it is truly certified organic, I cannot recommend this tea enough.<br />It is a simply outstanding value for an excellent variety, flavor and production of pure green tea. For about $0.15 a cup, I cannot imagine where else you could possible buy a more flavorful organic drink that has so many tremendously wonderful health benefits.<br /><br />Cheers to STASH Tea for bringing us such an amazing cup of Green Tea goodness. Even after traveling the world and back, I was pleasantly surprised to find this STASH tea....At this price, I will make it a great habit of STASHING more of this away for safe keeping.

review/summary: Interesting blend
review/text: My two teas of choice are green tea and earl grey.  Green tea goes great with meals, and early grey makes a nice morning or evening relaxing drink.  When I saw a package combing them both, I had to give it a try.<br /><br />And it is good.  The mixing of green and black teas has a unique flavor, and the oil of the rind of a bergamot orange gives it that distinct "earl grey" taste.  Overall, it tastes much more like the classic earl grey black tea, with those notes overpowering the green tea, but it does have a lighter flavor than pure earl grey.<br /><br />I don't know if this will be come a regular drink for me, but it was a pleasant surprise and one that I will pull out every now and then.  It would be a fantastic beverage for those seeking the health benefits of green tea but aren't particularly taken with the flavor.  It is also an organic tea, which is an added bonus in flavor, health and overall quality of product.

It doesn't have that added 'bite' of black pepper that some chai teas have. It's a  real winner!

review/text: *****<br />Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea has the pure, true flavor of ginger and lemongrass---not flavorings. I am not usually a fan of Stash's teas, but this premium tea is as good as much more expensive and higher-end teas. Please make sure you get the ORGANIC GREEN tea version, as it is a different tea (albeit with caffeine) and far superior to Stash's regular lemon ginger herbal tea, in my opinion.<br /><br />Everything in this tea is organic---the organic ginger, the organic green tea, and the organic lemongrass. Although it does contain caffeine, I think it is a much milder green tea, because I tasted the ginger and lemongrass dramatically more than the green tea. This balance made the tea even more enjoyable---a sort of different kind of teasan, one balanced with a little green tea.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and I love the direction they are moving with their teas, towards more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea unless you do not care for ginger or for spicier teas; otherwise you are certain to be delighted!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/text: I have purchased and enjoyed the Stash brand of teas for years...though never this mix of green and black chai. I was surprisingly disappointed with this blend. Can definitely taste the green tea more than I can taste the chai. For me, it's a weak blend of spices compared to what I usually enjoy in a chai. I felt confident (obviously) when placing this order of so many boxes, and wish I could exchange or return them. Been trying to doctor it up with added spices I have in the kitchen cupboard which helped a little, though decided to just give it away to friends and family who might enjoy.

This mint tea tastes like it was grown and dried within the week. I prepare the tea with new water each time (I don't re-boil the water). I also make my tea using spring water vs tap water which contains chlorine. The tea is sweet tasting and I find I use less honey than with other mint teas. In addition to the high quality organic mint tea, I will comment on the subscription service I use to obtain this mint tea. I have subscribed to automated replenishment to make certain I am never out of this wonderful tea. The Amazon automatic replenishment service is very reliable and easy to adjust quantities and delivery frequencies. ENJOY!

review/summary: I love this relaxing tea!
review/text: This is one of my favorite teas.  A nice, relaxing change to my other favorite...Lady Grey.  I can only find this at my local Safeway, so was thrilled to see it on Amazon in a large quantity.

review/summary: Very stong
review/text: The tea is good. Not that great. Has a spicy flavor to it. Not recommended for any one who is weak to caffeine because this tea is very strong.
