review/text: Tea comes in bags inside a large foil lined pouch.  There are 2 bags 'attached', and you peel them apart to use one.  They are not individually wrapped, and they do not have strings.  Strong flavor, great price.

review/summary: Sage Tea helps with night sweats
review/text: I have one cup a day and it really decreases my night sweats. I'm in amazement at how much it helps!<br /><br />The taste isn't great, but I don't think it's as bad as some other reviews have said. If you're concerned about the taste, you can use some sage from your spice cabinet and make a cup. It tastes pretty much the same, but it didn't seem cost effective to use the sage you buy in the spice aisle.

review/summary: Yes it does have an odor that some will find disagreeable, but it works for me and I will continue to purchase it
review/text: I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase.  But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell.

review/text: I picked up a box of each Slimstix cocktail mixes:  Margarita, Mojito, Cosmo.  They all are great, but my favorite is Mojito. I was amazed and the ease of use. If you just muddle a little fresh mint and lime to this, No more having to worry about Simple Syrups etc and the its perfect, you would never know its sugarfree. As a Long time Mojito drinker the<br />drink mix is spot on and with the fresh fruit the only thing you are missing is the calories.<br /><br />They all have their own distinct style, Margarita is sweet/sour, Mojito light mint / lime, and Cosmo more sweet / fruit taste.  There are some great recipes on the website that you can create just by muddling in lime and other low cal ingredients.  Portability factor is great too.<br /><br />CL

review/text: Tried making a mojito with just the powder mix, soda water and vodka. Had a really bad, fake, metallic taste, so I tried adding lime and mint. It barely helped. It wasn't really any less effort to use the mix than making one from scratch. The powder also stayed in tiny clumps that didn't dissolve despite vigorous mixing.

review/text: I can't drink right now, so I thought this would be a great way to enjoy a mojito when I can't really enjoy a mojito. When you mix this with plain bottled water, it tastes horribly chalky with no hint of minty mojito.  It's supposed to be mixed with alcohol and soda water; hopefully that makes a huge difference. Highly recommend you skip this nastiness and try some of the CL mix - so much better and still low calorie. Still waiting to see on the Slimstix Margarita and Cosmo mixes... Anything is better than this.

review/summary: Great for Ribs!!!
review/text: This is a very tasty sauce for chicken, as should be expected. But the more amazing use of it is for ribs!! First score the ribs with a knife all over. Drench with some red or white COOKING wine. Let sit. Lightly coat with Canola oil, and dust with herbs. Then slather-on the the whole bottle of the Butter Chicken Sauce on the top of the ribs covering them completely. Put in a cooking dish in the oven at 360, and cook for two hours. The ribs are falling-off-the-bone amazing. With the perfect taste and texture, so moist and not fatty. Better than most ribs I have had "out".

review/text: I love butter chicken. I order it almost every time I go to Indian restaurants. I even make it from scratch at home when the craving sets in. I have had A LOT of it. So when I was looking for a quick and easy dinner at the grocery store and found a jar of this stuff, I was pretty excited to take it home. Man, was I let down. This tasted more like barbecue sauce than butter chicken! I even added peppers, onions, curry powder, and cayenne in attempts to make it better. Nope. Just spicy barbecue sauce. Where's the butter!?!

review/summary: Tastes decent...just nothing like butter chicken
review/text: When I think of butter chicken, I think of a smooth, creamy, almost sweet sauce with complex but subtle flavors.  This sauce, while it tastes pretty good and is easy to use on chicken, tastes nothing like any butter chicken I've ever had.  It tastes more like a red enchilada sauce (yes, as in Mexican food!) with a little bit of Indian spices added in.  The flavors are too strong, the texture is thicker and not as creamy, and the mild sweetness is missing.

Takes less than<br />15 minutes start to finish. This is an extremely mild starter sauce and by itself needs<br />salt and pepper to get going, but the finished product is up to you. A kitchen staple for<br />quick and tasty meals.<br /><br />The best thing I've found you can do with this, is combine it with the Patak's Hot Curry<br />Sauce to simmer chicken in, its amazing. "Smart shoppers" can find this locally for around<br />$3.

review/summary: Raspberry Tea with Hibiscus Highlights!
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me; it is important though if you are allergic. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/summary: Has the be the greatest soft drink EVER!
review/text: Ramune has to be one of the coolest and most unique soft drinks that I have ever seen. My kids had been dying to try this stuff ever since they had come across it on J-Box, the popular Japanese import webshop. Ramune is incredibly popular in it's native Japan, and now it looks like the fun is beginning to spread here in the States.<br /><br />To open a bottle of Ramune, you have to remove the top, pop out this little plastic plunger from it's casing, and then use the plunger to pop out a marble that seals the neck of the bottle. The neck of the bottle has two indentions that will hold the marble when you tip the bottle back to drink from it, keeping the neck of the bottle clear. Hold the bottle the wrong way, and the marble will clog things up. You can avoid carbonated overflow when opening by pressing gently on the plunger until it depresses the marble; knock it down with force and you're sure to get a fountain of spray.<br /><br />The original flavor reviewed here tastes a lot like Sprite, but Ramune also comes in several other flavors. It uses high fructose corn syrup and/or cane sugar as a sweetener (It lists both on the label, which usually means that it uses whatever is cheapest on the world market at the time of bottling. Listing both also means that they don't have to change their labeling every time they change sweetener.)<br /><br />This is a way fun product that kids (and most adults) will have a blast with. It's a smaller portion (8 ounces) than what we're used to here in the US, but that actually works out for us as we're trying to limit the amount of soda that our kids consume. Ramune works great as an occasional soda treat and the fun factor alone keeps us coming back for more. Ramune is easy to find at just about any Asian market, but for those who don't have easy access to one, ordering here on Amazon would be recommended.<br /><br />Also, for the safety conscious, I can attest that these drinks are very safe. We've never had a problem with the marble, and I can't find any reports on the internet that would indicate any safety concerns with this drink. It's not a choking hazard, in other words. Ramune means 'carbonated' in Japanese, and I can highly recommend this wonderful and very different drink.

review/text: 5 star.  Our vet recommended this product for our 8 year old male Golden Retriever.  He had some stomach issues at the time and was a little over weight.  We switched from Eukanuba.  Since changing, the stomach issues have never come back, and he is at normal weight now.

review/summary: Great Balanced Choice for Dog Nutrition
review/text: When we adopted our dog six months ago, we went to both the local big box pet store and the boutique store in our neighborhood to read the ingredient labels of every bag of dog food. We knew we had to make an informed choice up front since it is so hard to change your dog's diet, especially when she is in that nervous phase between shelter life and home life. We found that the Pinnacle brand had the greatest balance of nutrition and edibility (i.e. actual food ingredients that would be easy to digest). Our dog loves it so far, it keeps well in our storage bin and all around it is nice to feed our dog something that we know is giving a solid nutritional foundation every day.<br /><br />As a side note, this food is also a great size to use for training and to put inside chew toys. We found that some of the kibble size of some of the other brands were a little too big for this sort of use.

review/summary: A dog food my dogs actually like :-)
review/text: I made the mistake of feeding my dogs a lot of people food over the years.  I wanted to get them back on crunchy food to clean their teeth, and to make sure they are getting balanced nutrition.  The problem is that they now turn their noses at even many of the better dog foods.  I got a sample of this dog food to try, and they will even eat it like dog treats.  Your mileage may vary, so it is best to try with a smaller bag to make sure that your dogs actually like it.  However, it is worth a try!

review/summary: No Substitute for Dessaux Fils
review/text: Yes, many search for a substitute for Dessaux Fils Vinegar, out of business for years, once Julia Childs' only vinegar, with a perfectly aged and balanced flavor and virtually zero vinegar edge.  The Roland review that recommends their aged red wine vinegar as a substitute for Dessaux Fils  is off the mark.  The Roland is fine, but at 7% acidity, it is closer to the Italian style and much too harsh.  The closest we have found is Dutour Red Wine Vinegar (Aged in Wood).  At 6%, it is almost as smooth and balances at Dessaux Fils.

review/text: This tea is not a dainty, gentle tea for a thin, English teacup.  It is a strong, robust, smokey drink, worthy of a large handmade ceramic mug.  It is for tea lovers of oolongs and lapsongs, and cold nights, and Russian literature of the 18th Century.  It has a shadowy side, a hint of a flavor that defies identification, an Existantial taste that encourages deep thoughts.<br /><br />I bought a half pound of this tea and will go for a full pound next time I order.

It used to be "Durkee's Mister Mustard," then "Frank's Mister Mustard." I remember it being called a dijon-style hot mustard, probably referring to its coarser grind.  Now is made by a small manufacturer in NJ who probably isn't doing enough to distribute it nationwide.<br /><br />BUT it a great mustard, unique, hot in a different way than many hot mustards, just the right burn, just the right texture.<br /><br />Can you tell I really like this mustard?

This is perfect mustard for brats, italian sausages, whatever.  I won't use it for everything (not all ingredients are suited) but I will be getting this on a regular basis.  YUMYUMYUM!

review/summary: My favorite tea in the whole world. Period.
review/text: Now, I don't presume to say that this is a tea for everyone. I don't quite get it, but obviously, considering the reviews on the t-bag version of this item (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AR14WO">Numi Organic Tea Chocolate Puerh, 16-Count Full Leaf Tea Bags (Pack of 2)</a>), many people don't like it at all. (I gave t-bags to 2 co-workers, after raving about how wonderful this is, and their lack of comment 6 weeks later tells me that they didn't like it, either.) It's up to you whether you want to risk disliking it, or missing out on something truly amazing. (Rule of thumb: If you like pu-erh, you might as well try it; if not, this might not be your best introduction to it.) But for godssake, try the small size before buying 1 lb of it!<br /><br />When I'm having a horrible day, when things have turned sour and the world seems to be against me, this is my cup of comfort, my security blanket. It soothes me, calms me with its sheer deliciousness. (Give a child a big bar of chocolate, and he'll stop sulking in no time. That's my equivalent.)<br /><br />Now, this tea is amazing, but far from perfect. I wish there was more pu-erh itself than condiments (chocolate nibs, orange pieces). When I peak inside the bag I really see more pieces of this and that than tea (and chocolate + orange should never cost $43/pound; this is what it comes down to). This works better for re-steepings than the t-bags, but it doesn't go as far as most cooked pu-erhs.<br /><br />In fact, these shortcomings annoy me a bit, and I've been looking for other chocolate teas (pu-erh and non-pu-erh) to substitute it. So far they've all failed. It is next to impossible to find *good* chocolate tea; most are terrible. See: I hate rooibos, so that plus chocolate equals "eeew". I like black tea, but haven't found a good combination yet. Green tea and chocolate sounds gross; I haven't tried it yet. Same for white and oolong. I've only found another brand of chocolate pu-erh (Mighty Leaf) but the flavor just wasn't there.<br /><br />But I found a way to make this perfect: I mix it with regular pu-erh! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5L0I">Rishi Tea Organic Pu-erh Tuo Cha Loose Tea, 5-Ounce Tin (Pack of 2)</a> or a Camel's Breath tuo cha works beautifully. This way I can steep it 3-4 times, and I get the super yummy flavor in a much stronger version. Heavenly!!!

review/summary: Don't bother with the tea bags -- go for the full leaf!
review/text: Pu-erh is a tricky tea to talk about.  It is part of an ancient tradition of health-giving teas that isn't discussed or researched in the west. It comes from old (reallllly old) tea plants/trees.  It's aged in caves (natural or more lately, man made -- though purists will probably break out into cold sweats and loud fights over that one.)  This is the tea whose long tradition is of being given as a wedding gift -- like the envelopes of money in the Godfather movies.  Everyone brings pu-erh from their own stash, and contributes it to the newlywed's new stash.<br /><br />Pu-erh comes in green and black varieties -- this one is black.  Green is usually milder in flavor, and has less caffeine.  Black is considered more potent.<br /><br />Well -- this is very mild and smooth.  Delicate, in fact, like the best pu-erh touchas I've had.  The chocolate is an added bonus (who is ever going to argue with chocolate -- either for its taste -- or its own healthy attributes!)<br /><br />The chocolate and the pu-erh are both so complex that your best bet is to just dive in.  It tastes good -- especially with a little milk/half and half and a tiny bit of sugar (don't muck around with chemical sweeteners on this one. -- go for natural.)<br /><br />And go for the loose tea over the tea bags. I've had both -- and there's a depth of flavor in the steeping of this loose tea that really makes a difference.

review/summary: Only buy if you love ORANGE tea
review/text: Chocolate?  The strongest flavor of this tea - it's actually quite overwhelming - is ORANGE.  It seems to be of good quality so if you like strong ORANGE tea, then this is for you.  Unfortunately I now have a large bag of tea that I'll never drink because I don't care for the ORANGE taste.

review/summary: Doesn't Begin To Compare With the Real Thing
review/text: I usually buy Pu-erh tea at a store about 40 miles away, it comes in an orange box for less than 1/4 of the price of this (per pound). I haven't been able to get to that store for a while, and was having Pu-erh withdrawal, so I decided to try this. I don't know if this isn't aged, if it comes from inferior trees, or it's something else in how it's processed (or a combination of all of them), but this doesn't even begin to compare with the wonderfully complex and slightly pungent "real" Pu-erh that I've been drinking for the last twenty or so years. A real disappointment, I hope that Amazon gets the "real" product from China for sale someday - until then, I guess I've got a drive to take.

review/text: I am no tea expert by any means.  I do drink alot of coffee though.  Probably too much, and Ive been looking for a way to ween off of it.  I found this tea to be a great coffee replacement.  It tastes good alone, but even better when brewed with a fruity tea like Celestial Seasons Wild Berry Zinger.  Ill be going to the market to look for other flavors to combine with this tea.  This Black tea gives a nice boost without jitters and without as much caffeine as coffee.  I hope to lose weight by cutting out all that cream and sugar too.

review/summary: Nut-Thins are crunchier than a potato chip!
review/text: I originally purchased Nut-Thins as a snack for my cousin who would be visiting and told me she didn't eat gluten. When I first tasted them I was pleasantly surprised at how crispy and satisfying they were.  And they don't get stale like crackers do.  Plus they have the health qualities of the nuts in them.  Lower fat and calories than chips and you don't eat as many of them at once...because they are more satisfying than crackers or chips.  I gave a few boxes away so I am already ordering my second case.  I will be more of a miser this time.  I tried to not order this case but I was missing them as a snack alternative.  Through Amazon this is a much better deal than in health food or grocery stores.

They are crunchy, cheesy, and oh so good!  They are definitely worth the purchase and I would recommend buying them to anyone who enjoys a crisp, crunchy, cheese tasting cracker!  I would purchase them again.  To the Celiac Community-although they say they are made in a facility that also processes wheat; they are endorsed by CSA and are tested for ppm of gluten and pass the current standards for gluten free foods.  I have never bought any other product that states made in a facility that also manufacturers wheat, however I would buy these again since each box is tested and given the seal of approval to be certified GF by American standards.

review/summary: If you love Cheetos and Goldfish snacks, you'll love this even more!
review/text: This is a great substitute for less healthy, wheat-based, cheese-flavored snacks such as Cheetos, Goldfish and Doritos.<br /><br />I'm not allergic to wheat, but I love these crackers anyway, and I've tried all the flavors. I personally rank them this way in terms of my preference:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H154WQ">pecan</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003I567W4">almond with a touch of sea salt</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HP5FV2">hazelnut</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H154US">regular almond</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003I5A85G">BBQ</a><br />cheddar cheese<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H11C6I">smokehouse</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HPBRA0">country ranch</a><br /><br />I'm unusual in that I don't rank this at the top, but all the flavors are big winners to me, so my gradations of preference aren't huge.<br /><br />My two crunchy snacks of choice for some time now have been <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G7V3LC">Snyder's Butter Snaps Pretzels</a> and popcorn popped in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004W4UP">Nordic Ware 60120 Microwave Popcorn Popper</a>, but I recently discovered Blue Diamond Nut-Thins, and they've pushed those two treats from the top of my crunch list. In fact, I used to think the Snyder's butter flavor was great, but now in comparison, it just seems bland. The flavor of all of these various Nut-Thins crackers is sublime.<br /><br />In addition, you simply cannot beat this cracker for mouth feel if you like plenty of snap. They are wonderful with dips, but they are so delicious, I actually prefer to eat them plain.<br /><br />At only 8 calories per cracker, Nut-Thins compare favorably to the Snyder mini pretzels I mentioned, which are 5 calories each.<br /><br />Here is a list of the ingredients: Rice flour, almonds, cheddar seasoning [cheddar cheese powder] disodium phospate, salt, maltodextrin, natural cheese flavor, salt, enzymes, yeast extract, xanthan gum, cultured whey, onion, extractive of turmeric, garlic, extractive of annatto, lactic acid, less than 2% soybean oil, potato starch, expeller pressed safflower oil, soy lecithin.<br /><br />Most of these ingredients are self-explanatory, but here is information on some of the ones that are less obvious:<br /><br />Disodium phosphate is disodium hydrogen phosphate (Na2HPO4), a sodium salt of phosphoric acid. It is used commercially as an anti-caking additive and to quicken cooking time in hot cereals such as Cream of Wheat. I did a quick search on it and didn't immediately find anything bad about it.<br /><br />I've seen xanthan gum sold a lot in the spices and baking-supplies section of health food stores. It is used as a natural thickener.<br /><br />The yellow color of the cheddar cheese cracker comes from turmeric, a natural herb that is known for being anti-inflammatory in its effects. Another source of the yellow color is annatto which is derrived from the seeds of the subtropical achiote tree. Like turmeric, its seeds are full of carotenoids (which are very healthy anti-oxidants) of a strong yellow to orange color. Their flavor is described as "slightly peppery with a hint of nutmeg" and "slightly nutty, sweet and peppery."<br /><br />Apparently they use maltodextrin as a sweetener vs. corn syrup which is used in most commercial crackers.<br /><br />I don't see any preservatives listed.<br /><br />The company seems to use essentially all natural ingredients.

review/summary: Delicious cracker, almost as good as Country Ranch!
review/text: As a person who cannot eat gluten and doesn't really like flavor nuts that much, I struggle with trying to find items that I like. Out of all the nut-thin Blue-Diamond crackers, these WERE my favorite, until that is, Ib tried Blue-Diamond Country Ranch (see review of that one). The Cheddar Cheese crackers taste great with tuna salad, but are great without too! I used to buy them at Whole Foods which is about a 35-50+ minute drive depending on traffic, so needless to say, I was pleased to see that they sell them here online. And even without the subscription, they were still cheaper than buying them in the store, not by much, but still cheaper! Especially when you consider time, gas, and SALES TAX - all of which are momumentally saved on Amazon! I ended up signing up for the subscription, its a saving of $.48 cents per box, once again this excludes the sales tax of 10% I get charged plus the hefty price of gas! So, its well worth it to me!! I also signed up for the subscription for Country Ranch Blue Diamond Crackers, since they are my favorite!

review/summary: Absolutely outstanding crackers - crunchy and flavorful!
review/text: These crackers are superb.  I tried the smokehouse flavor and I was not impressed, but the cheddar cheese flavor is irresistibly good.<br />The only issue that I have with this deal on Amazon is that the price is way off.  I can purchase these right now at a local health food store for $2.29 per box.  These are priced at almost $3.50 per box based on the price for the cheddar cheese thins. If you crave a cheesy taste in a light, crispy cracker - which also happens to be wheat and gluten free, then you have hit the jackpot.  These consist mostly of rice flour and ground almonds with cheese flavoring and no msg.  But they do contain disodium phosphate -whatever that is - 250 mg of sodium, 0 g of sugar, 22 g of carbohydrate, 4 g of fat and less than 1 g of fiber in a serving size of about 16 crackers.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />The barbeque thins are just as good. A serving size consists of 17 crackers with 130 calories, 3 g of fat, 180 mg of sodium, 23 g of carbohydrate, 1 g of fiber and 1 g of sugar.  There are no artificial colorings or flavors and lots of taste and a little bit of sweetness from molasses, vinegar, tomato powder and spices.<br /><br />The ranch crackers are also very tasty, but I don't recommend eating them as a late night snack or just before going out to meet with people "up close and personal".  The tasty ranch flavor settles in your mouth and even after brushing my teeth and tongue and sleeping through the night, I still had the ranch taste in my mouth.  My husband had the same experience.<br /><br />These thins are reminiscent of Japanese rice crackers.

review/text: The Vegetable Variety Pack provides an opportunity to find out what your baby likes.<br /><br />We have twin 7-month olds and their favorite is the sweet potato followed by the carrot jars.  They love those.  They like the winter squash.  We could not get either of them to eat the peas with brown rice despite numerous attempts.<br /><br />They like the brown rice cereal we give them though, which we get from the same brand, Earth's Best. They really dislike the peas and will not eat that one.<br /><br />You can get this variety pack at the subscription price, which when considering free shipping is fair enough.<br /><br />You can also get any of these flavor types individually in packs of 12 for the same price and with the same subscription arrangement.  You can even get lentils with brown rice under the same terms, so scroll and see all the types of jars they have.  Therefore, once you know what your baby likes and will eat, you'll know which subscriptions, if any, to sign up for.<br /><br />For us it makes sense to go with subscriptions since we're buying for 2 babies.

I was so relieved to hear that there are no BPA's that come into contact with the baby food. There are two layers of plastic in the lid and the layer that touches the baby food does NOT contain BPA. The layer in between has small traces of it, but their research has shown that it does not leech into the food. I personally feel comfortable with this and am glad I can still support this company.

review/text: I bought this line of baby food because it was organic and came in glass jars. I prefer to make my own baby food, but some times you need other options, especially when traveling. It is incredibly disappointing to find out that there is BPA in the lids. I just talked to the company and they confirmed this. My understanding of the canning process is that it requires heating the product to a high temperature in order to create an airtight seal. So not only is the food being exposed to the BPA during this heating process, but then during the entire storage process until an unknowing consumer like me buys it. I feel incredibly dumb for trusting Earth's best to be good for my baby. Get with the program and create BPA free lids! I recommend everyone taking the time to call the company and urge them to change their packaging. Until then I will stop buying this food line.<br /><br />Here is a website that will give you some ideas for other organic baby foods that have BPA free packaging<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: Nice selection of basic baby food vegetables
review/text: I am pleased with the Earth's Best Vegetable variety pack.  These are the standard basic baby food vegetables: Winter Squash, Carrots, Sweet Potatoes, and Peas with Brown Rice.  I would have preferred plain peas but I am guessing they add the brown rice to thicken it and make it not so runny.  The flavors are bland but palatable and slightly sweet so most babies (mine included) enjoy these vegetables.  The consistency is great for babies from 5-9 months but probably too runny for older babies 10+ months.  Three of these four (squash, carrots, sweet potatoes) are available at my local store but the price is slightly cheaper on Amazon and the variety pack is convenient.  The cardboard tray is great for storing the jars in my pantry so they aren't rolling around everywhere.  I will purchase this product again as long as my child is eating baby food.

review/text: I am a strong believer in giving my baby organic foods as much as possible. We used many of the Earth's Best flavors and baby really enjoyed most of them. What I found irritating though was how runny many of the flavors were; I often had to add oatmeal or rice just to keep the food on the spoon. Water is added to many if not most of the flavors. I wondered if that was a necessity however "Plum" "Ella's Kitchen" and "Happy Baby" brands (also organic) do not have water as an added ingredient. We definitely used these, but to be honest, I prefered the other brands because I felt we were getting a better value considering we weren't paying for water in those packages.

review/summary: Can't go wrong with organic
review/text: My son gives the carrots 5 stars but isn't a fan of the peas however that's all on the learning tummy of a baby and nothing to do with the product. I've got no complaints.

review/summary: great food
review/text: My baby LOVES this food (all 4 flavors) !!! We started mixing cereal in to make it last a little bit longer because she powers through this stuff!!! Overall, it smells pretty good & the ones I have tasted are not bad. We are very happy with this and have it on Subscribe & Save, so it works out to about 75 cents per jar. I don't know how that compares to other brands, but I like that this is organic and doesn't have additives. It also helps that my baby is happy!!! 5 stars.

review/summary: Broken
review/text: 4 out of 12 containers came broken, and it smelled terrible. It seemed like they were open for a while, because they were all rotten. The packaging was terrible, no protection at all. I rather buy them at the local store.

review/summary: baby food purchase
review/text: The price is the same as in the supermarket.  It's just more convenient to have it delivered free to the house.  The food itself is good.  My one-year old grandson eats two jars, one fruit, one vegetable at every meal.  He eats every bite.
