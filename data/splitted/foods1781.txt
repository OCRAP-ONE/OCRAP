review/summary: Some really great and some really really bad
review/text: Diet Cranberry Raspberry - The BEST flavor I've tried yet. It's just sweet enough, great flavor, and calorie free. I always have at least three bottles of this in my cabinet at all times.<br /><br />Orange - Very sweet but good. I'm not a fan of orange soda so that's probably the only reason I don't love this.<br /><br />Lemon-Lime - Again, very sweet. It has a good sprite-type flavor though so I went ahead and tried the diet version as well to see if that would be a staple in our house.<br /><br />Diet Lemon-Lime - It's not an all time favorite but it's good. I have a bottle of this usually for whenever I'm craving something different or something a bit more refreshing and I'm tired of plain water.<br /><br />Cream Soda - WAY too strong. I love cream soda and so I didn't expect any issues with it but just the smell when opening the bottle was enough to make me slightly sick to my stomach. And I'm not exaggerating. I actually threw out the entire bottle after one sip. It has an almost alcoholish undertone to it that doesn't help at all. Gross.<br /><br />Root Beer - Not even close to as bad as the cream soda but slightly reminiscent. I did drink the entire sample that came with the Sodastream but do not plan to buy a bottle of it even though I am a huge fan of root beer.<br /><br />Cola - I bought this to act as an emergency back up for when my husband wanted a rum and coke and didn't have any coke in the house. It tastes a bit like off-brand diet cola to me, probably because of the Splenda. This is very off-putting only because there is so many calories in this and you don't even get a calorie-laden taste. Hahaha. This will continue to be held for those emergencies but we won't be drinking it by itself at all.<br /><br />Grape - This one actually surprised me because I was so prepared not to like it. It's a bit on the sweet side but still much better than many others. I've been putting about 1/4th the amount of syrup in less than called for and it helps cut the sweetness a bit but after that it starts to make the flavor taste watered down. I wish I could find a diet version of this. Not sure if it exists or not but I can't find it on Amazon if it does.<br /><br />I'll update this as I try more. I am cautiously optimistic about the diet ginger ale so that will be my next purchase.

review/summary: A fairly "meh" generic cola.
review/text: I love my Soda Stream, and most of the mixes I've used have been quite good (pretty much any of their fruit flavors, their Dr. Pepper substitute,  Root Beer and Energy Drink have all been quite tasty), however the one flavor that really stands out as a disappointment is the cola flavor. I can forgive the fact that it doesn't taste like Coke or Pepsi-- I have tried other "b-list" colas that tasted good in their own way-- however, this one is overall just plain bland. It's not sweet enough, and it lacks the "kick" that I expect from a cola. I tried making the most of it by adding additional ingredients-- once I used vanilla, and it made the soda even more bland. The other time i used some cheap whisky my room mate bought, and it was probably the nastiest mixed drink I've ever had (I'm not a heavy drinker though, keep in mind, and I blame the crappy alcohol more than the soda for that one).<br /><br />I have not explored other options for cola syrups yet, but this is one I don't expect I'll be buying again unless they change the formula. I'm pretty sure there's got to be a better option out there that does not involve spending $150 on a 5 gallon bag of Coca Cola syrup (which would have the high fructose corn syrup that I've been trying to avoid anyway).

review/text: We love our SodaStream and have found several of the mixes we like including the Root Beer.  It is not as good as A&W root beer but it makes a great root beer float.  It does not taste overly sweet, nor does it leave you with a chemical after taste.  Plus it is nice that you can control how much syrup you add to play with the flavor a bit.  I would recommend at least trying this syrup and definately use it for a root beer float!

review/summary: With a little doctoring, very good
review/text: This is better than diet but falls short of brand name cola taste.  I feel the cola flavor is a little "spicy" and not fruity enough. I tried a few mixin's and now I think it is great.  If it came as good as I can mix it, I would give it five stars.  If you decide to try this product, get some True Lemon or Lime, True Orange, stevia packets (with a high level, 90% or better, of steviosides for cleaner,sweeter flavor, and a bottle of cherry snow cone syrup if you like cherry cola.  I use a half packet of lemon and Orange, 1 packet of stevia, and a short squirt of cherry per liter bottle. Now the flavor falls between generic and brand name.  Cheaper than using cans, but not cheaper than using two liter bottles.  The calorie count is about a third of normal cola.  You have to be comfortable with Splenda and Ace-K as Soda Stream uses those to offset some of the sugar (not corn Syrup a plus).  Thankfully no Nutrasweet/aspartame as I get terrible headaches from that.

review/summary: False advertising?
review/text: I chose the diet soda. Notice that the total amount of the product is not written. I was perplexed at first, but then discerned that the product image clearly says 750ml. So at $8.39 it seemed to be a decent price. However what I received was a 500ml bottle. Not worth the hassle of returning for a couple of bucks, but an annoyance none the less. So beware when you purchase. I suggest you assume that you will receive a 500ml bottle.

This is nothing but a customer advisory.  Buy the syrups direct and save a bundle.  As for the product, its a great product.  Spending 99.00 on the machine means I have to drink a LOT of soda to equal 99.00 of sodas but it is more fun and a lot less waste.

review/summary: Tastes like Redbull, doesn't look so much like Redbull and smells a little vitaminy
review/text: First thing, this does give you energy just like an energy drink. It also tastes very similar to Redbull. When I burp, it has the similar energy drink belch smell that energy drinks have for some reason. The color is not quite the same as Redbull.<br /><br />But having said all that I still find this to be an excellent value when you compare the prices of Redbull vs this mixture. At the store, Redbulls are $1.99 where as this one costs maybe $0.40 after all is said and done (cost of carbonation, syrup, shipping charged on carbonation, etc). I made that number up in my head though, did not use a calculator or even really think mathmatically about it so it is pretty much a made up cost I pulled out of the air and doesn't represent anything truthfully.<br /><br />Anyhow, I know it is a much cheaper solution, I enjoy it and am drinking some now.

I look forward to Amazon having a more competitive price so I can "load-up" in the near future (hint-hint).  Either way, I like the diet Lemon-Lime Soda mix better than diet 7up. 'Nuff said?

review/summary: Flavors from home and childhood
review/text: The sodastream has been a real help to my family we are currently serving overseas and while there is an abundance of coke here the other flavors of soda are shall we say lacking! Some are so bitter that they are not palatable to my family. Rootbeer is a favorite and the sodastream has it nearly perfect to the rootbeer my dad made when I was young! I think that a touch more syrup is necessary to reach the true rootbeer flavor so it gets one less use for my family than the bottle says and I think there is an underlying mint flavor that is not overwhelming or unwanted but a bit noticeable to me. I did not give it 4 stars because the items arrived dented and not packed as well as I would have liked to make the journey overseas not punctured but close. It was however shipped quickly and without delay. I have not tried the diet in any flavor other than cola and with  the significantly lower sugar count in the regular probably wont but wouldnt mind hearin how they are! Thanks for shipping to us folks overseas since the sodastream site will not and where they have international sites they will only ship the flavor varieties for each country! That doesnt help much for me!

review/summary: Other products taste better and healthier
review/text: I used this product for many years. I favored them for high quality ingredients, excellent flavor, reasonable price, and wide availability. I find milk and soy products cause digestive distress, rice beverages have no such effect, no cholesterol, very little fat, and taste great. I prefer the vanilla flavors of all the rice beverage milk replacers. It's sweet, if you like that.<br /><br />However, Rice Dream now uses the cheaper canola oil in all their rice milk products (except a few items, like the Healthwise rice beverages). Canola oil contains erucic acid, a toxic chemical. The FDA has limited canola oil to no more than 2% erucic acid to protect our health, and do not allow it in infant formula. In addition, studies show the erucic acid it contains is toxic (see below). I have not been able to find any long term longitudinal controlled studies on humans to prove its safety as far as all the adversely affected organs.<br /><br />The Healthwise Rice Dream rice beverage is much healthier, it has half the sugar, no canola oil, and plant sterols (which may reduce serum cholesterol). Good Karma Whole Grains Ricemilk is organic and also canola and sugar free. It has a thicker, richer and creamier body and flavor, less watered down. The vanilla flavor is a delicious drink, it tastes more like fresh whole milk straight out of the cow (if you have had that) than what is sold in cartons in the US. Westsoy Rice Beverage has similar consistency to Rice Dream, but is canola free.<br /><br />The same canola issue (as well as added table sugar in some products) also applies to the Imagine frozen desert products.<br /><br />Because there have been Internet rumors about Canola that are based on misinformation, I provide some citations of scientific papers and government publications. Studies on erucic acid in rats and piglets show heart lesions, decreased red blood cell count, and other tissue and organ damage. Erucic acid crosses the blood-brain barrier and is known to affect nerve cells. It's not safe for infants.

review/text: This review is based on more than five years of use.  My family is lactose-intolerant and we eat mostly a vegetarian diet.  We avoid dairy products at all times.  We have tried a lot of substitutes, as we like a milk-like product to use in cereal and coffee and for cooking.  This Rice Dream Vanilla has a wonderful taste and works well with cereal.  It doesn't taste like rice to me.  I love that you can keep extra cartons on the shelf and order it infrequently.  Only the open box needs to be refrigerated, and shelf life is very long.  When I cook with Rice Dream I have to keep in mind that this particular product has some sweetness and a slight vanilla flavor.  That is a plus when I'm baking, and I can actually cut back on the sugar in recipes, but I cannot use it in a savory sauce where I don't want any sweetness.  Otherwise, it cooks well and can be substituted ounce for ounce for milk.

review/text: I have read mulberry to have a high O.R.A.C. value. Thus, I ordered both mulberry capsules and mulberry tea so that I may see if a beneficial change may occur in my personal blood chemistry six months from now. In the meantime the capsules are cheap in cost and the tea is higher priced than my "ochya", but I just add them together within my morning tea blend.

review/summary: Outstanding Musli
review/text: I am a big fan of musli having grown up in Switzerland. I came across this cereal by accident in a gourmet store and bought it because I love raspberries. It tastes great and I especially appreciate the fact that it is not too sweet. I ate it with unsweetened coconut milk, but could definitely see adding it to plain yogurt. This is going to be my go to breakfast cereal for now, (unless I try one of the other great flavors of musli this company produces. ) Only fails to get 5 stars because it is expensive and I wish it came in larger bags.

review/text: I found this cereal in a local store when I was searching for a good breakfast cereal that met my needs.  I wanted one with good taste, high fiber, and some protein.  I found this Vanilla Fields that fits my needs and then some.  In a 55 gram serving it has only 1 gram of fat, no saturated fat, no sodium, 6 grams if fiber, 9 grams of sugar, and 6 grams of protein. It is also made organic which is an added plus.  I have one serving topped with 1 cup of Almond Breeze Unsweetened Vanilla (40 calories).  I also enjoy the Cinnamon Harvest but it does not have the protein like this one.<br /><br />I purchased this with the auto-delivery plan and saved some money.  In the store one box costs from $3.20 to $4.99 depending on location, plus tax.

However when it comes to Kashi, as much as I love their crackers, cookies, and breakfast bars, I have never found a cereal that had any flavor! Until now! This cereal is great in all aspects. The vanilla flavor isn't sickeningly sweet, the crunch is great, and you can't beat the fact that it is so healthy as well. Whenever I eat this for breakfast, it fills me up better than any other easy/quick breakfast items. Definitely love this cereal!

review/text: I bought a box of this cereal last night at my local Wal-Mart and I couldn't wait to try it this morning.  This is delicious!  I normally try to eat shredded wheat (non-sugar coated) for the health benefits and I have to say this is the best shredded wheat I have ever eaten!  I would prefer that this did not have sugar in it but at least its natural and organic sugar and it doesn't taste really sweet.  The vanilla gives a very nice flavor and I really like the texture of this cereal.  It's got more of a 'natural' texture than most other shredded wheat cereals I have tried.  I think this might be my new favorite cereal!

review/summary: Needs more flavor
review/text: "Kashi Organic Promise Cereal: Island Vanilla" is a shredded wheat type cereal that uses whole wheat as its main ingredient and organic vanilla as its flavoring.  First of all, this is an extremely healthy cereal with all-natural, nutritional ingredients.  Also, the texture is wonderful if you like crunchy cereals.  While the nutrition factor and texture of this cereal are amazing, I'm afraid that the vanilla flavor falls flat.  If you were to munch on this cereal dry, as a snack, the vanilla flavor would come through, and you would think that it is a very tasty treat.  However, once you add milk to the cereal, it dilutes all the vanilla flavoring that was there, and it's difficult to taste any vanilla flavor at all.  This problem could be easily fixed by the company putting more natural flavoring into the cereal or by the consumer possibly putting a bit of vanilla flavoring into the milk before pouring the milk over the cereal.  Unless this is done, though, nothing differentiates this cereal from an unflavored shredded wheat cereal unless it is eaten dry which defeats the purpose of it being cereal.  Although it is definitely healthy, I don't recommend getting this cereal.

But I like these for take-along snack foods to add to nuts and fruit.<br /><br />These would probably be great as part of a nut-date pie crust, too, as well as drenched with cream for a more traditional breakfast dish. And I bet they'd also be good in that sweet-salty mix so popular.<br /><br />I give it a four because I'd rather add my own sweetener, if any, but give this a try for an easy snack, addition to a pie crust, or as decor for a dessert.

When I was ordering some other things from S&S I attempted to shorten the time between cereal deliveries; I must have read something wrong because even though I had checked the cancel choice I got EIGHT boxes of the stuff (1 order = 4 boxes so they claim I made two orders).  Their explanation:  I cancelled the next order not the current one I thought I was cancelling. (At some point I checked the 'your order' page and the cereal wasn't listed.)  I then tried to return it but it's food and therefore not returnable.  Both of us messed up but I've had similar problems with S&S so I've quit the program.

This is the best pizza crust we have found.  The texture & "crunchiness" is great.  We bake it prior to toppings so that it will be crunchy.  We have served it to friends who could eat any pizza they want and they could not tell the difference.

review/summary: Not that good
review/text: They're too thick and so they dont cook evenly. What I eventually started doing was putting it in the oven alone until it browned, then taking it out and putting on the toppings on the most heated side and cooking again, it turned out best that way. But it still wasn't that good. I put a bunch of seasoning on it but it never quite had a good enough taste, really sad... This is so expensive too, I got it when it was $29- I would not get it again.

review/text: Giving up pizza was the hardest part of being diagnosed with Celiac Disease for me. This crust is very good, and I can't tell the difference between it and the real thing (which is very important). It bakes up crispy and not too dense. It seems expensive at first, but it's really not when compared to the prices of pizza chains.

review/summary: Better than no pizza at all?
review/text: I just found out two years ago that I have celiac disease and must eat gluten free. I live in a small town that is 3 hours from a big town, and there are not a lot of gluten free options available here. I thought I was just not going to be able to enjoy pizza anymore. Then I ate at a Picazzo's restaurant. They offer a gluten free pizza that is delicious, so I knew it could be done. I decided to look around on Amazon and found these pizza shells. The reviews were pretty good, so I ordered some. At the time, they were on sale and I got them for about $30. You have to buy 5 packs at a time (a total of 10 shells) from Amazon. I have made 4 pizzas using the shells, and I am now wondering if I should throw the rest away or give them to the food bank. First off, when you cut open the plastic bag the shells are packed in, you find that they smell very bad. I checked the ingredients to try and identify the odor. The shells contain pear juice. If you opened a can of pears, poured them out, and left the empty, unwashed can out in the sun for a day, you might match the smell, so maybe it comes from the pear juice. The smell is not as strong once the shells are cooked, but it is still there and an unpleasant taste goes with it. My bottom line recommendation is that,  if you really want to try these shells, you buy one package somewhere else to try before you spring for 5 packages from Amazon. To answer my own question, are these better than no pizza at all? I would say no, they are not.

review/summary: good chocolate wrong item!
review/text: So, the order came in 4 days late (we ordered for a friends birthday of course!) And was so excited to just finally give them to him we barely noticed that although we had ordered the hershey almond bars we received the regular plain ol milk chocolate. Our friend likes them anyways but so dissappointed that it wasn't what we ordered. After a few emails to seller I was given the choice of returning the product to exchange it for the right one or just getting half of my order refunded. My friend liked the regular plain ol milk chocolate bars, hid any dissappointment of the lack of almonds and I won't be buying anything from this seller again.

review/summary: Makes a tasty chicken substitute when prepared right...
review/text: I've been trying many of the vegetarian and vegan meat options sold here on Amazon, and this was one of them. The first time we tried these "grilled chicken" strips we didn't precook them and put them in an enchilada bake. They turned out rubbery and gross. My husband is not a fan of the seasonings on them or the texture (the paprika taste is quite strong) but I enjoyed the seasoning (I do love me some paprika.)<br />Since then, we froze the package and have broken off chunks to use periodically in recipes. You can get rid of the rubbery texture and get them to taste a lot more like chicken if you sautee them for a while first, then add to your recipe. Sauteed and then chopped up small, they make a perfect addition to a vegetarian quesadilla!<br />I wish there was an unflavored, or more lightly spiced variety of this soy chicken so I could easily add it to more recipes without the taste of the spices being so strong. This product is tasty and has a great texture once it is precooked.

review/summary: Quality control concerns re: Luck Chen discontinued noodles
review/text: I was suspicious of a food product with savings of $40 something dollars, so did some Googling.  Luck Chen, the company that produced this is no longer activly producing foodstuffs.  From their website:<br /><br />"Due to the decline in quality controls at our manufacturing facility in China, we regret to inform you that Luck Chen has temporarily discontinued manufacturing its product line.<br /><br />Manufacturing goods in China has become a great challenge while at the same time trying to maintain strict quality controls.<br />We will be moving manufacturing of our noodles line to New York State in the near future."<br /><br />So this stuff is just back logged product someone is trying to liquidate, ostensibly from the manufacturing facility that had such a 'decline in quality controls' the parent company decided to pull out.<br /><br />Nuff said?<br /><br />It's a shame, trying to find some easy veggie meals for quick prep... The hunt continues.<br /><br />____<br />EDIT 12/17/2011<br /><br />Due to my concerns, I phoned Luck Chen and spoke at length about my apprehensions.  The noodles Luck Chen LLC produced were manufactured in China.  The MannaSoy product is manufactured in Israel.  My over critical mind assumed that because on Luck Chen's website (the LLC that is at the 'top' of the business structure, at least as product description reads "Manufacturer: Luck Chen') then I felt all products under that name would be suspect of quality as well.  My concerns were fostered by lack of distinction on either Luck Chen's or Manna Soy's websites detailing the different countries of manufacture and lack of highlighting this applies solely to the noodle bowls; the Luck Chen representative said he hadn't considered how that may play out in a customer's mind and said he would work on clearing up that distinction on the websites.<br /><br />I now feel confident in ordering some of the MannaSoy product and giving it a spin in my wok.  Hopefully if anyone should have concerns similar to my initial ones, they will be rested by my experience and Luck Chen's explanation to me.<br /><br />Thanks to Daniel D. STEIN-FREER for challenging my initial comment.

review/summary: Excellent,
review/text: Excellent! I decided to try the Manna soy product again after I had a bad experience with them being damaged by shipping and am so pleased I did. First the packaging has 100% improved, it come double boxed. I bought the grilled chicken type. I first microwaved a few with water to make a veggie wrap and they were okay, so I thought I may not buy these again. THEN I decided to throw them on a pizza and bake it. OMG it was so delicious. I'm vegan, so it was a cheesless pizza with just peppers, onions and a ton of these on top with lots of olive oil. The flavor changed completely, it was divine! I also stir fried them in a little olive oil with red bell pepper and onion and made hoagies, again out of this world. The flavor you taste when they are microwaved gets baked in when they are cooked by other methods. I will be buying these forever. So, stick to prepping them in the microwave with a little water to make the sauce, let them sit for a about 5 minutes and then stir fry them in olive oil, bake them, forman them and you will find what a real true dish these make!

review/summary: Best "MOCK" meat ever
review/text: My whole family has been vegetarian for 8 years now and we are always searching for mock meat that we can use in recipes. I ordered this and didnt have a lot of hope but I was very surprised when I made it and tasted it. The texture is amazing, the taste is great. The grilled chicken flavor is the best. I can use it in so many dishes and the large amount is amazing meaning I can use as much or as little as I want. This will be the main mock meat for my family. I also bought the beef and made a wonderful Stroganoff!!! I can not say enough wonderful things about this product!

review/text: Probably not. But close. I (reluctantly) tried the Whiskas Temptations regular chicken version, among about a dozen other "enticers", and detailed my experiences in a separate review of CAT-MAN-DOO BONITO SPRINKLES. This "natural" version may work even better as an appetite booster. Whiskas also makes other "natural" sounding versions with wild salmon, beef, and tuna. I have not tried these specific ones either and probably won't since I have a lot of test product leftovers to work through. I would like to echo the points made by the excellent review below.

review/summary: Cats like 'em and they're all natural - what's not to love?
review/text: I volunteer at a cat shelter so over time I've had some experience with what cats like and what they don't.  With a few rare exceptions, it is hard to find cat treats that are popular with mostly all of the cats.  So far, Natural Temptations Wild Alaskan Salmon Flavor, Natural Temptations Tuna Flavor and All Natural Temptations Chicken Flavor are proving to be three of the rare exceptions.  Just about all the kitties love these things and will follow me around when I'm handing them out so they can cadge more.  Because they are all natural and only 2 calories per treat, they are a reasonably safe and nutritious treat.  Because they are inexpensive, I can afford to bring enough for everybody at every visit!  And apparently they taste awesome.  I can buy these at my local grocery, Target, Walmart or pet store for around $1.50 to $2.00 a packet and each packet contains enough treats to provide every kitty in the shelter with a generous serving of treats. There is one negative - these treats contain a lot of grains and as a result some kitties will vomit them up after an hour (some kitties tummies will not tolerate food or treats containing grain, or more than very small amounts of grain); over the last few months I've had 3 or 4 kitties through the shelter with this issue.  Once I've identified a kitty who is grain-intolerant, I naturally do not feed it these treats or anything similar.  Note that there are several versions of the Whiskas treats that are not all natural; the kitties like them also but I prefer to feed the all natural version.

These arrived, but were not the caliber of product we thought they would be - nothing "special" about these peas and the cans were mostly dented, etc - labels were off several cans, which makes it FUN later to try and determine what is being consumed.  With zero warning, the subscription with Amazon was cancelled and *magically* now it is back, but at the DOUBLE the price we paid in December 2011.  Nice.  We can of course, re-subscribe, but NOT at the same price we did in December.  My calendar shows it is less than a month ago and they DOUBLED the price.  Have or will cancel most of our subscriptions.  No need to pay .30 more per can than what it is on the store shelf regular price with no add or coupon sale.  Very disappointed in how Amazon handled this.

I needed something less expensive so I tried this 'Prince of Peace' brand Oolong.<br /><br />After a few brewing experiments, I now love this stuff.<br /><br />What I have learned; If brewing as 'sun tea' this type of tea seems to come out very weak. If you put this tea in boiling water, it may come out bitter.<br /><br />I now heat up my water in a microwave until it is, very hot to the touch, but no way near boiling. I then put in the tea bags and let it brew for about twenty minutes (I like strong tea). I have, to my taste, duplicated the 'Tejava' brew at a fraction of the original cost.<br /><br />Enjoy<br /><br />Ken

review/summary: Great Snack or Breakfast
review/text: This granola is great both as a dry snack and with milk. I first bought this at World Market, and then googled it to find out where it could be purchased online. It gets 4 stars instead of 5 because it is way too expensive. You can get other granolas for about 30% cheaper.

review/summary: What can you say?  It's Kraft Mayo
review/text: The reason I got this from Amazon is because with the Amazon Prime it was cheaper than the price in the store.  The price fluctuates on Amazon so keep checking though.<br /><br />It tasted just like Kraft Mayo should taste and it arrived with no dents in the product.

review/summary: Can't find elsewhere any more
review/text: This product is no longer sold at the store, so I so appreciate the vendor selling it this way, it's my only 'water mix' and fantastic with no calories, no carbs or sugar, and calcium! My second case of this flavor.
