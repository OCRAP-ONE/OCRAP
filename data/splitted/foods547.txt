review/summary: The Best Earl Grey Tea I've found
review/text: Stash 'double bergamot' Earl Grey tea absolutely is the best Earl Grey I've found, and I've tasted quite a few of them both here in the US, and while traveling in Europe.  The regular Earl Grey in this brand is also excellent, but the 'double bergamot' variety has a little more flavor than the Stash's regular Earl Grey.  I highly recommend both, and if you are curious like I was, treat yourself to one or both of these, and you will probably never want to purchase any other brand.<br /><br />I'm not sure the reason, but the other brands I've tried just do not taste as good.  Whatever Stash is doing with this tea recipe, it works.

review/summary: A winner
review/text: I can't find this brand tea at my supermarket and am presently sniffing the empty tea bag because it just takes me back to this wonderful breakfast place somewhere in the Berkshires that made the best banana spice pancakes.<br />I am delighted to find out about this Double Bergamot. The Bergamot is the reason I love this Earl Grey tea above all others.  I am giving this a good review before trying it because that's how much I love the Stash Premium Earl Grey.<br />I would recommend newbies to try the Premium first.  This is a winner among Earl Grey teas.  No one does it better than Stash.<br />I'm tempted to try their Chai Spice Tea.  Celestial Seasonings Vanilla Honey is my favorite.  If Stash makes it better I'm in heaven.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Didn't find a big difference between the Double and Premium Earl Grey.  Still love them.  Tried their Chai Spice--OK, but still love Celest. Seas. better.

review/summary: Revitalizing
review/text: Although I have sampled numerous Earl Grey teas, I always come back to Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey Tea. I agree that it is not for the faint-hearted or those with a hypersensitive palate. Unlike teas such as jasmine green tea or chamomile which are soothing and relaxing, this tea is revitalizing and vivifying. So, if you want a bold and full flavored tea experience, this is the perfect tea for you.

review/summary: Unique Earl Grey
review/text: I've tried a variety of Earl Grey blends, and this one wins the prize for being the most unique. The citrus flavor is noticeably different from other Earl Greys. The box says that in addition to bergamont, other citrus flavors have been added. Personally, I taste a touch of grapefruit in the mix, which makes this tea a bit more lively than your typical blend. Of the conventional Earl Grey teas that are relatively easy to find, my goto is Bigelow's. I find Twinings to be too light and a bit sour.  My favorite Earl Grey is made by Revolution, and includes lavender as an ingredient. If you want an Earl Grey that doesn't hold back on the bergamont, and you don't mind some extra tannins, I'd suggest Rishi or Tazo. Lady Grey by Twinings also tastes great, and includes small blue flowers, which you can see in the loose leaf version. Cool visual effect against the dark black tea leaves.

review/text: I have been a long time drinker of Earl Grey Tea. No, not just because Captain Picard drank it (ok maybe a little) but because I drank coffee for years. Anyway, Earl Grey lovers will really like this tea... the citrus "bergamot" flavor is doubled - as the label states.<br /><br />This tea is strong enough (black tea) to wake you up in the morning yet a perfect tea for the evening if you so want.<br /><br />Not recommended for those of you who like a weaker tasting tea. Earl Grey fans - don't wait, get this now!

review/text: Stash's Peach Black Tea has the perfect balance of peach and strong black tea flavor for a very refreshing summer drink.  I usually use one or two peach tea bags along with 2 family sized black tea bags of the grocery store variety.  This makes 2 quarts of great iced tea, with just a hint of peach.  When I want something special I will use only the peach black tea and serve with a slice of peach.  Summer is coming so I just stocked up!

It is just amazingly good, definitely worth the stained teeth.<br /><br />Occasionally I will warm up some milk in my mug (filled about halfway, I'd say) and let the teabag steep while the water is getting hot. Once I take the teabag out I just add some sugar and am ready to go.<br /><br />If you love tea, if you love gently but wonderfully spiced foods - try this. I am very glad that I found it.

review/text: Compared to other bagged teas, this is delicious and highly aromatic blend of chai.<br /><br />Right from the opening you will smell the wonderful cardamom, cinnamon and nutmeg notes.<br /><br />Although I enjoy it all alone, this probably tastes just as good with milk/sugar but I haven't had to use them to enhance the flavor.<br /><br />Once this cools down a bit, the flavors are more distinct and mellow to my taste.<br /><br />I try not to go past 2.5 minutes while brewing and so far this is working for me. I haven't had any issues with bitterness, etc.<br /><br />Go ahead and play around with brewing length since it can vary based on water temperature and quality.<br /><br />I was a bit hesitant since I've already tried the Jasmine Blossom Green tea from Stash, but this was surprisingly good and is a refreshing alternative to other teas.<br /><br />Give this a shot, you might love it!<br /><br />* * * * * 5 / 5 * * * * *

review/summary: Not fond of smell or taste
review/text: I purchased 3 different flavors of Stash tea when it was on sale at Sprouts after seeing the great reviews on Amazon.  I must say, Stash makes mediocre tea.  There's something about the aroma and taste of their teas that does not agree with my senses.  Maybe it's the cloying smell of the bergamot in their Earl Grey.  I prefer Twinings, especially their Lady Grey tea over Stash.  Of all the teas I've tried so far, Ahmad's fruit-flavored teas are my favorite (especially the Peach & Passion Fruit Black Tea, but the mango is good as wel).  Aroma and taste is amazingly refreshing.

review/text: Not familiar with what "chai" tea is supposed to taste like but this tea tasted like stewed cloves to me  Yuck.Got this flavor in a sampler box and, so far, it's the only Stash tea I've tried and disliked strongly. Some are better than others, of course, but I find this particular flavor really, really unpleasant, which is odd given my love for most of the spices listed on label.  The problem is that the clove just overwhelms everything and that's about all I could taste, outside a touch of cinnamon. IMO, clove has much too strong a taste to be used beyond sparingly...in anything. Perhaps adding milk and sugar might've made it more palatable - might even be the way it's 'supposed' to be prepared, but one of the reasons I drink tea is to stay away from having to add sweeteners or milk to make it taste good. In any case, I can't imagine using enough milk/sweetener to subdue the overwhelming clove taste would leave any room in the mug for tea or water.

review/summary: You Really Should Try this if You Like Chai!
review/text: I happen to love chai tea, but am not fond of some of the ingredients that are in some store products.  This is by far the best chai I have found.  It is much stronger than you would think, so I actually make more than one serving at a time, and mix it with plain black tea (use your favorite; I know lots of teas, and use Assam -- a very strong black tea -- in combination).  You can drink it with or without milk and sweetening, but remember that most chai teas you buy in tea and coffee shops have both milk and sweetening in them.  It can be served either hot or chilled.<br />The price is excellent, and I can get it in quantity so I don't (Heaven forbid!) run out.  If the taste is a little TOO strong for you, they also have the chai spiced black tea in the Stash brand, which has fewer non-tea additives.<br />I even have friends who "don't care for tea" who have gotten hooked on this stuff, so it must be pretty good!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQC064">Stash Premium Double Spice Chai Black Tea, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>

review/text: I bought this because I thought it actually had organic ingredients- as the description stated.  It does not.  It's quite good Chai tea, but I'd rather drink organic Allegro chai tea (available at Whole Foods for close to this price) than buy this stuff.  The good news is that unlike some teas on Amazon, this one is very fresh and has a good sell-by date.  I ordered it only a few weeks ago, and it is good until 11/2012.  So if you don't care about organic tea, and you want a nice chai with strong cinnamon overtones, this is a pretty good one.  I really like Allegro chai- it tastes more balanced to me, and I was hoping the Stash would be like that, but it's not.

review/summary: Not like chai at all!!
review/text: I'm looking for a really good chai to make at home. This had good reviews and my local grocery store actually carried it. I brought it home, made a cup and literally couldn't drink it. I had to put 3 tsp the sugar in it and extra cream to even be able to take a few sips. And thats reslly saying domething because i usually take little to no sugar in my tea. I actually like bitter black tea. This chai by stash isn't bitter so much as just plsin bad. I love chai and used to order loose leaf ( at a high price) from a place online that doesn't have it anymore. I guess you get what you pay for. This tea has a terrible after taste i can't begin to describe. Like dirt or sour cinnamon. I like both cinnamon and cloves so i'm not sure my complaint is the same as other reviewers. It really tastes like old bitter, sour, cheap spices to me! Glad i got this on sale at the store rather than wasted money ordering here. This box willbe going to work, annonously so no one knows it's from me! Or perhaps i should just throw it out. Don't like to be wasteful but I can't bear the thought of drinking a whole box of this!

review/summary: The tea smells like a medicine.
review/text: The tea smells like a medicine with Anise flavor before even brewing it. No one in my family could drink it as it has strong anise flavor. There is not even a slight trace of bergamot flavor... I called STASH customer service to see perhaps the pack was mislabeled, no one answered or called me back. I  am sending this back.

review/summary: Capt. Picard drinks Earl Grey
review/text: This excellent tea is an Earl Grey. Capt. Picard drinks Earl Grey. If Picard drinks it, I drink it; that should be sufficient to get my point across. But for those of you who don't recognize the reference I'll say that I'm very pleased that my lady friend in Stash's hometown turned me on to this. I have a few cups every day, usually with some toast and almond butter. If you find typical tea like Lipton to be a bore or want to lay off the coffee for a while, try some of this and be pleasantly surprised.

review/summary: Terrific chai at a great price!
review/text: This is one of the best chai blends available on grocery store shelves, a perfect  cominbation of spicy clove, cardamom, and other spices with just the right amount of cinammon for sweetening. The refreshing aroma wafting from my cup is so delightful that it's almost a shame to drink it; I really could just sit there inhaling the vapors. My preferred brewing method is to steep for about 5 minutes, then add a touch of honey. The only thing that could make this tea better is a hint of vanilla, although you could add some of your own if you were so inclined. Of all the teas I've tried, this one is my second favorite, eclipsed only by Celestial Seasonings India Spice chai (which does have that natural vanilla flavoring).

review/text: I don't even remember where or when I bought this tea or if someone gave it to me, but I finally tried it and was totally blown away.  Did you know that bergamot is a type of sour orange?  When you smell the tea knowing that the scent is citrus, you can distinguish it but I didn't figure it out on my own.<br /><br />Anyway, oil of bergamot is what makes Earl Grey tea something different from just plain tea.  The DOUBLE bergamot is what makes this particular Earl Grey tea a new taste experience (at least for me).<br /><br />Here's a link to the Wikipedia entry for Earl Grey tea:<br />[...]

review/summary: Good, but mostly for Earl Grey fans
review/text: I am an Earl Grey fan, and I am currently enjoying a thermos of Stash's Double Bergamot as we speak. The citrus background of the standard Earl Grey mix is definitely amped up, making it into the central focus of the tea (as opposed to the black tea base). It is obvious you are still drinking tea, mind you, but now the bergamot flavoring is a lot more transparently citrus in origin.<br /><br />Cup by cup is probably the best way to make it your first time out. Making it by the traditional "full pot" method of "1 per person and 1 per pot" (and for me, often "1 extra just for the fun of it") makes the taste borderline spicy. This is how I first sampled it and it caused me to cough upon my initial swallow because I knew it was strong but was not quite expecting that level of strength. I recommend a little bit of honey and a little bit of milk to help bring the taste into roundness.<br /><br />Like Lapsang Souchong, this tea has a distinctive flavor that seems perfect for waking you up on a cold morning or refreshing you after a long day's hike. It gives me a little extra perk at work, and I like that.<br /><br />However, I cannot five star this tea because the flavor is a little too intense for the more casual drinker. I like having tea socially, and sharing it with my friends. Most of them outright dislike this one or only sip it sparingly (just like the aforementioned Lapsang Souchong).<br /><br />Earl Grey fans, however, can rest assured that it is a five star review for them.

review/summary: Best chai you can ever get from a bag.
review/text: I have just bought this tea yesterday and made a traditional "chai", as I normally do. I've used other brands and types of bagged chai tea before, and they were decent, but nothing like this. I absolutely love my chai to be extremely spicy, and this is it. No other varieties of Stash Chai or even their other teas can compare to this. This is simply delicious when made with milk and sugar. Save the money you spend on a Starbucks Chai latte and buy a box instead. It's MUCH better and less expensive when made right.<br /><br />I usually make chai from scratch, but this is definetely a time saver and tastes amazing. Highly recommended.

review/summary: A noble effort, but falls short
review/text: Most bagged chai blends aren't very good at all.  There, I said it.  There are a few that have authentic taste but are just too weak overall, and unfortunately, Stash Double Spiced Chai falls into that category despite hitting all the right notes with the spices.<br /><br />Upon opening a bag for the first time, I was concerned that this would be overloaded with too much cinnamon, but from the green stains on the bag it was apparent that they stuck a load of cardamom in there as well, which is a good thing.  With milk and sugar, though, the black tea just did not have the strength needed to counter-balance the spice medley.  Things improved when I added a second bag to the cup, but overall it was just too bitter and again, the BODY that you expect the black tea to provide just wasn't there.  With a different or stronger tea base Stash could have a real winner here, because they certainly have the spice blend right on.

review/text: It is a damp, rainy night in Baltimore.  At 43 degrees, there is a definite chill in the air.  Great time to get into my jammies and curl up with a cup of Stash Tea, put on my favorite singer (BM) and write Amazon reviews for you fine folks out there!<br /><br />I have been a tea drinker all my life, and Stash is great tea.  This flavor is wonderful and one of my old favorites.  Now they have plenty new and creative flavors but this still remains wonderful, simple, and basic, with a nice smooth peach flavoring.  Stash is stronger than your basic tea bags (Lipton, etc.) so depending on how strong you like your tea, you might only need one bag for a 24 oz cup like I do.  I drink it black with natural unbleached sugar or agave nectar (sweetener made from cactus juice and available in many food stores in the organic section.)<br /><br />Great flavor and worth the price difference.

review/summary: Amazing Quality of Teas
review/text: I received a variety of Stash teas as a Bridal Shower souveneir over a year ago. I'm sorry i took so long to bust 'em open. Stash is an amazing quality with natural tasting, comforting flavours in both the Herbal and Black Tea lines. I am so impressed, I've become a Stash convert.<br /><br />This Double Chai is very well balanced in it's spices, but still comforting and yet refreshing at the same time. I made mine mostly according to the directions (tea is easy that way), but i did use sweetened condensed milk instead of regular milk and sugar. It may not be 'Starbucks Quality' as one reviewer lamented, but I'm sure the beauty of Chai is that it can be well made in a variety if different ways. And while i've never been big into Chai, in the future, I'm definitely going to keep a stock of this Chai tea in my pantry. And unlike many other common brands of black tea, this one does not go bitter after 5-10 minutes of steeping. I'm used to having to be vigilant about removing the bag after 3 minutes, because I'm sensitive to the bitter over-steeped taste of lower quality black teas. That was not at all an issue with either of the black teas I've tried from this company. I can't wait to buy more Stash Teas.

review/text: I love this tea. I just wish it was organic because I drink so much of it! I only drink it with a little milk and honey. The milk softens the tannins and seems to develop the floral scent of the bergamot oil.<br /><br />I've tried several other brands that offer high bergamot earl grey but none of them have that wonderful scent that this tea has. This absolutely the best high bergamot earl grey I've ever tasted. I may try purchasing my own bergamot oil and making my own because I want to drink this tea at least 5 times a day, and if I'm going to be steeping that many leaves, I want them to be pesticide free. I just hope that I can reproduce a flavor that comes close to the flavor of this tea.

review/summary: Vicks Vapor Rub
review/text: I'm really curious as to what "blended black tea", means. It doesn't say it on the ingredients list, but it smells and tastes just like menthol, camphor and eucalyptus oil, with a nice blend of cinnamon, which it does list. In removing it from the wrapper, it had such a strong aroma of Vick's Vapor Rub, that it gave me second thoughts as to whether it was safe to drink. However, I did want to try it, so here I am, alive and still kicking. The only positive thing I can say is that it has a nice cinnamon flavor that pleasantly lingers in my mouth, and the packaging is easy on the eyes. Not sure what the manufacturers were thinking though, in putting this product out in the public arena as a beverage. The ingredients are: blended black tea, ginger root, cinnamon, cinnamon oil, clove oil, allspice, nutemeg, clove, and cardamon oil. Because of the unknown element, I wouldn't be surprised if they started marketing it, as a familiar cold remedy. Todd Wilbur?...you missed one.

review/text: First time I tried Stash Chai Spice Black Tea, I hated it.  Something about the smell did not appeal to me.  It inspired me to go to the local Indian grocer and purchase my own spices to make chai from scratch.  That was very successful (with help from the Internet and advice from an Indian friend).  I finally came back to try Stash's Chai again today and the first thing that hit me was the strong clove scent, which doesn't bother me as much after a few minutes.  I think the chai tastes a bit better this time around than when I first tried it.  Kinda grows on you, I guess.  However, it's not GREAT chai by any means.  It's okay for chai in a teabag.  Convenient.  But I'll stick to making it from scratch when I finally finish this box (waste not).

review/text: I have been a fan of chai tea for a long time and occassionally will try different brands.  In my book, a good cup of chai tea does not require sugar and cream, and has tastes of cinnamon, vanilla, and cardamon.  I picked up this box at the local store because it was relatively inexpensive in comparison to most of the other brands.  I also hoped that "double spice" meant double the tea servings. I was wrong.  Like other reviewers have observed, the tea tasted very bitter.  An extremely strong black pepper note seemed to overwhelm the rest of the spices.  I have liked other Stash brand teas, but I was very disappointed with this one.  Unfortunately, the box now sits in the cabinet collecting dust.

review/text: I don't understand anyone claiming this fine tea lacks strong, rich flavor. It's the best bagged black tea I've discovered, though we've enjoyed PG Tips and Yorkshire teas. This "Irish Breakfast" tea is strong, without being overly tannic or sour. It's not like loose Lapsang Souchong, being a far more mellow smokey experience. If you crave an authentic, comforting tea that reminds you of being far from the maddening crowd, perhaps in a safer environ of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011B9W38">Midsomer</a> than Badger's Drift, than this is the tea for you. We like it with milk & sweetener, though it's wonderful with honey or sugar.

review/summary: Stash brand teas: A personal favorite for 10+ years
review/text: If you enjoy Earl Grey tea, once you try "double bergamot" you will be a customer for the rest of your life. Personally, I "brew" the tea using the following method:<br /><br />1. Fill cup with water, leaving enough room for milk and sugar after brewing (if you use those items).<br /><br />2. Put the bag in the cold water cup and microwave for about 2 minutes.<br /><br />3. Remove from microwave and allow to steep another minute.<br /><br />4. Remove bag, add sugar & milk.<br /><br />Enjoy

review/summary: You Really Need to Try This Tea
review/text: I enjoy a variety of teas from herbal to traditional to Green & White's, but generally prefer green teas.  I found the Stash brand on sale once and they had a huge selection, so I picked 5 or 6 varieties to try, including the Double Bergamot Earl Grey.  I had originally planned to pass on this variety, but thought I may as well give it a try.  As the days went on I tried each of the varieties one by one and really enjoyed them.  Then finally I got to the DB Earl Grey.  I didn't have high expectations for it, but let me tell you -- I was absolutely blown away by this tea.  It is perhaps the best tasting, most full-bodied and yet elegant tea (I know that's a strange word to describe tea with) I've ever tasted.  If you like regular Earl Greys, you will LOVE this tea.  You can tell the Bergamot oil is of very high quality.  Take your time to inhale the scent of the tea bag before you even start brewing -- it's that good.  The taste cannot be compared to any other Earl Grey I've had, and I've had some very good ones.  And you can brew quite a large cup (like a double tea-cup size) with one bag.  This tea is very full-bodied, so if you like your teas weaker, don't leave it brewing for too long.  They did not skimp on this tea and you really owe it to yourself to give it a try.

review/text: I usually drink Twinnings earl grey.  I opted to try something new and i love bergamont so i figured DOUBLE BERGAMONT would be amazing. Well this tea smells amazing but it is very very weak. I have to use 2 teabags vs 1 twinnings tea bag and seep it for 7+ min in order to get the equal flavor i would get from twinnings. I wish this tea was stronger in flavor not just in smell.

review/summary: An excellent Earl Grey for the price
review/text: As someone who really enjoys Earl Grey, I was drawn to the sensationalism of the "Double Bergamot" marketing ploy. While this tea does have a clear bergamot flavor as you would expect from an Earl Grey, I cannot say I found it particularly revolutionary. Rather, this tastes like a good Earl Grey, and for the price I believe it is probably one of the better ones out there.<br /><br />I can't say it's overcome my favorite among standard Earl Grey teabags -- that remains <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003F18GPC">Pickwick Earl Grey</a>, which I had not found in the US until very recently. But at less than half the price, this Stash product delivers much better in price performance terms.<br /><br />Of course, if you're willing to spend a lot more, there are better teas out there. Like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NNB6H0">this one in silk sachets by Harney & Sons</a>. But this is an outstanding performer in its category. It also makes great iced tea. Highly recommended.

Stronger Bergamot flavor.<br /><br />Being such a nice guy, I bought her premium earl gray teas. None I tried were strong enough. I tried Twinings, Stash, Bigelow, Tazo, ... nothing had enough flavor. Than, I saw this. This, Stash Double Bergamot.

The tea itself is not strong so if you like very strong tea by all means add a bag of regular black tea to brew along with the Stash. Absolutely delicious..It will bring you to an exotic and distant land of pure enchantment.

review/summary: Over all, fairly good
review/text: I have tried spiced chai tea, but it did not have enough spices. I also tried a mix where you just add water, but they were too sweet. I prefer a stronger spice flavor and I like to be able to control the amount of milk and sugar. So, I usually make my own chai spiced tea from scratch. I get just the right amount of ingredients, but it is a lot of trouble and takes time.<br /><br />Then I tried the Stash Double Spiced Chai Tea. With more spice than most other teas I found the flavor and intensity to be fairly close to my home-made chai. This chai tea is able to maintain the flavor of the black tea with a nice blend of spices that give it a little extra kick with the double-spice. Of course, with more spices comes more bitterness. The way to lessen the bitterness is to slightly increase the milk and sugar. A better way to help cut the bitterness is to use honey instead of sugar.<br /><br />I will still make my own home-made version when I have the time to make it. But, I will also use this Stash Double Spice Chai Tea as an alternative until I find something better.

review/summary: most flavorful chai i've found
review/text: Being a fan of the creamy, spicy chai teas one can get in the coffeeshops, I've tried to recreate them at home with disappointing results -- until now.  I've probably purchased ten or twelve different brands of Chai looking for the right one.  I finally found it with this Stash Premium Double Spice.  It is exceptionally flavorful, and really able to hold the strong flavor.  The aroma is incredible.  Although it has cinnamon, it doesn't strike me as particularly cinnamony -- I think the cardamom flavor may come through a little more strongly.  Nor is it particularly spicy -- I can't handle spicy foods and I don't have a problem with this.  This tea is a little heartier than most -- I have taken to drinking it instead of coffee in the morning.<br /><br />I haven't been quite as impressed with the other Stash teas I've tried (they're okay, but nothing special) and generally prefer Mighty Leaf or Tazo -- but this tea quickly jumped to the top of my favorites list -- I'll be ordering much more.

review/summary: So Tasty in the Winter!
review/text: I usually drink green tea, straight up.  But I wound up in a Starbucks one day and ordered a Chai Latte.  It didn't taste like tea to me at all!  It was more like hot chocolate, only with spices instead of chocolate.  I thought I'd gone to heaven.  I regretted not bringing some of the Tazo tea home later.  I just started craving the stuff.  I found Tazo Chai Spice at the supermarket, but wasn't happy with the price.<br /><br />So I thought I'd try Stash.  I already buy some of their green teas.  It's even better than Tazo!  The Spice Chai or Double Spice Chai, they're both delicious.  The Double just has more spices and works better with milk.  Or cream :)  Makes the house smell good, too.  Not knocking Tazo, either, after all, I did rave about their tea.  I just think this is even better.<br /><br />If you want to give tea as a gift, spice probably won't go to waste, no matter what the tea drinker usually drinks.  Every tea drinker I know can go for a spice every now and then.

Numi golden chai has no cloves whatsoever so I recommend it if you want to avoid those pesky cloves.  Oh, Numi also does not have black pepper which is traditional in chai tea but is also a taste I don't like in my tea.

review/summary: Double Bergamot is Double Good!!!
review/text: I like Earl Grey tea, so I tried Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey Tea.  It is really great-tasting.  Very fragrant and drenched with oil of bergamot.  I have offered it to my friends and they like it too.  No need to add anything to this tea, it is loaded with flavor.  My message to the Stash company is:  "please keep making this tea".  I am addicted to it now.

review/summary: Everyone loves it
review/text: I buy this tea in bulk because I drink it at work (beats the heck out of bad office coffee) and everyone who smells it wants to try it.  I have had the other version (spice chai) and love that this tea is also made in the double spice version.  I've had chai tea many places, and I've yet to find one with the beautiful flavor this one has.  The packaging is convenient, individually wrapped and easy to dispense in the box - I keep it on my desk and invite people to come by and grab one.  This tea includes clove, cinnamon, and cardamom and black tea - a wonderful, flavorful concoction.

review/summary: Chai means Tea
review/text: Introduced to Stash double Spice Chai in a gift box - we couldn't find it at our local stores. Fab fab fab! The spices are for the nose and the black tea base is stimulating, try it with soy milk for a very nice chai experiance. Close your eyes and your in India.
