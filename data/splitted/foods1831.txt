review/summary: A tough, satisfying chew
review/text: The 12" size takes my 5 month lab up to a week to work through. She did just get all of her permanent teeth in, so maybe that time will speed up given some months. Yes, they do have a bit of a smell, but it's more like I get an occasional whiff when she's chewing on it.  If the chew is just lying around, I don't smell anything.  They haven't left any stains on my carpets, and she hasn't lost interest in them.

review/summary: Thin as a pencil, smelly
review/text: I am a frequent user of bully sticks from other vendors online and from pet stores. These are listed as "THICK" bully sticks. I usually buy thick ones from another vendor and my German Shepherd pup loves them and they last a couple of days. These arrived and I was immediately disappointed. Many of them are the thickness of a pencil or slightly thicker. They are about 1/3 the thickness of the "thick" bully sticks I usually buy. But I did not want to deal with sending them back so I gave one to my pup. It smelled HORRIBLE, like a person who had not washed in weeks. My pup liked them okay but because they are so thin she can eat an entire, 12" one in under an hour. Will NOT buy these again.

review/summary: Long lasting
review/text: Having a puppy means having enough things for him to chew on. I love these bully sticks because they last a really long time and can keep him busy chewing for what seems like forever. Because they last so long they are economical as you don't have to buy them week after week. Bottom line is he loves them and I lvoe that he loves them.

review/summary: what a value!!!
review/text: First of all, the sizes vary a bit, which in fact I love especially if you have different sized pups. Most of them are very thick with some smaller sized mixed in.  Love that they are grass fed and hormone/antibiotic free. This is EXTREMELY important to me!!! The length was near perfect on every one. The smell was minimal. My dog loved them and I recently purchased more. The price is out of this world!!!! I was paying over $7.00 for one, locally. Great product, great price, great value!

review/summary: Excellent Quality Bully Sticks
review/text: I purchased the 12" bully sticks (7 pack) from Downtown Pet Supply about a week ago.  One of my two dogs recently passed away, and the other was feeling a little depressed.  I wanted to give her a "special treat", but also hoped that these would help perk up her poor appetite since her sister's passing.  Boy have these done the trick!  I let her chew on the stick for about 30 minutes & then took it away.  Low and behold, she remembered she was hungry and ate all of her food!  She is a 50lb Lab mix who is very healthy at 13.5 years old.  In the past I had purchased 6" bully sticks at a local pet supply store for $5 each.  These sticks come out to be just under $3.50/stick and are twice the size!  This purchase was well worth it -- quality product for a great price.  I will re-order again.  Thank you!

review/text: My 13 week old GSP puppy loves bully sticks. He loves to chew and will chew these for hours. I ordered the 7 pack of 12."  They are nice sized, and 1/2 the price of the local pet shop's brands.  But, they smell the worst out of all the brands I have tried so far. So, we will not be ordering them again.  I won't describe the smell. Its vulgar.

It was my mistake to not see 4 in a package but I saw instead 12" bully sticks with a photo of a large bag of bully sticks.  Very deceptive.  Why not put a photo of the 4 bully sticks one receives.  I will never buy them from you again.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I was hesitant to purchase this product after reading other reviews about them not being "thick".  But, since I couldn't find any other thick bully sticks on here, I thought I'd give them a shot.  Well, I am very disappointed!  They are not thick at all.  They are the same, "slim jim" thickness as every other bully stick I've bought before.  I'm not even sure why they advertise them as thick.  The thickest one is MAYBE as big around as a dime.  Not at all what I expected, and I won't order them again. I kept them just because they are at least cheaper than the same size ones I can get at the store - and it's a pain to have to return them.  My 10 month old beagle consumed one in less than an hour, start to finish.  I was hoping to find something that would last longer than that!

review/summary: best thing since microwave popcorn
review/text: I love this stuff.  This is one of the times when I"d like to have more than 5 stars.  It makes good pancakes; not necessarily  better than some other instant mix, but pretty darn good, and extremely convenient.  Keeps indefinitely till you add water.  So, when you want some pancakes, you just add water up to the line, shake it up, and you're ready to go.  You can jazz it up if you want; you can put yogurt in it, fruit, chocolate chips, jalapenos, whatever.<br /><br />It comes in a larger size too, which might make sense if you have a big family, and I used to use those  till I discovered this size; it'll keep in the fridge for a few days.  However, this is extremely convenient.  You can probably make breakfast for four out of one bottle, or if not, just use a second one.  I get 2 or 3 breakfasts (just for me) out of a bottle.  Can't always  find this size in stores, so what I do is order a case of 12 from Amazon, and that's at least a couple months' supply.  I always have pancakes a few seconds away, either if I get the urge or if there's nothing else handy for breakfast.

review/summary: Makes 6-8 Pancakes--Really?
review/text: I just tried this product for the first time this morning.  I hadn't made pancakes at home in years, and LOVED how easy this was--you just add 2/3 cup of cool water to the container, put the lid on and shake, and pour into the skillet.  Since I call myself "The Lazy Chef" because I don't like things that take a long time to make or have a hundred ingredients, this was right up my alley!<br /><br />With this product, it is possible to have pancakes on the table in no time! The question is--how many pancakes will you be serving?  The front of the 5.1 oz. bottle says "Makes 6-8 Pancakes" on the front and, on the back, instructed me to make 4-inch pancakes.  I made 2 pancakes and then, before making more, added a little more water to the container to make the batter thinner (as the instructions indicate).  In total, I got 5 pancakes out of this bottle.  Four of them were in the 4-5" inch diameter range and the last one was closer to 3 1/2-4" inches.  I can't quite imagine how they expect someone to get 8 pancakes out of this bottle.  YMMV.<br /><br />The pancakes puffed up nice in the skillet and were nice and fluffy on the plate. They were quite light and tasted fine.  They weren't incredible pancakes, but they were perfectly fine for me when I am in the mood for pancakes.  I ate them with Smart Balance spread and some warmed Aunt Jemima syrup and enjoyed them.  In fact, I made 2 pancakes and put the rest of the batter in the fridge for another day but liked the 2 pancakes enough to go make more.<br /><br />I would keep a bottle in the pantry for when the mood for pancakes hits me.  I had also thought it would be nice to make for house guests but that will only work only if there is only one house guest and he or she is not very hungry!  Or I suppose I could buy the larger size bottle or buy multiple small ones.<br /><br />Please note that I did not buy this from Amazon--I bought it in my local grocery store--therefore I cannot speak to the product purchase experience on Amazon.  I did notice that they are offering this product on subscribe and save, so if you plan to buy it regularly, I'd definitely recommend ordering it through the Subscribe & Save program as it lowers the per-order cost of the product.

review/summary: Very Good product
review/text: This product has less sugar than the microwave variety and is ideal for me and my 3-yr old grandson.  :)<br />The pancakes are tasty and he loves to "shake, shake, shake" the bottle while I fire up the skillet and spray the PAM.<br /><br />There were 2 reasons that I took a star away and awarded 4 stars for this product.<br />1. It takes more than 2/3 cup of water to make the product reasonably pourable.  I put 2/3 cup in at first and then had to add a little less than 1/4 cup to make the batter pourable (all in all, less than 1 full cup).<br />2. If you don't use it all and refrigerate a portion of it, even for 1 day, more water must be added because it will be too thick to pour.

review/text: Until I found out about this product, I wouldn't bother making pancakes or waffles. When cooking for one person, it's just not worth the cleanup time.<br /><br />This product is fantastic... no cleanup at all, and it makes excellent waffles.<br /><br />Just make sure, as per the instructions, that you put the top on loosely when storing leftover product. Pressure builds inside the bottle, and if you put the cap on tightly it will spray batter everywhere when you open the bottle.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/text: I am not fan of oatmeal. I don't care how healthy it is, just didn't like it. However I needed to add more fiber to my diet so I began trying different brands and flavors. My experience has been that the ones with "healthy" on the label, taste far worse that those that omitted that word. I must say that when I first tried this oatmeal I was prepared to dislike it before taking the first bite. I was surprised, the flavor is incredible. There are even chunks of apple in it. Now, not only am I eating a lot more oatmeal, but I'm enjoying it. Thanks Kashi!

review/summary: It's Oatmeal
review/text: It's oatmeal. And it's not half bad. There are dried cubes of apple in each packet, which are tasty, but are few and far between. This oatmeal is great with a little added fruit, I especially enjoy adding chopped bananas. The sweetness of the oatmeal goes great with a black coffee or strong tea. The preparation is quick and convenient; I find myself eating breakfast more often because of it. All you need is boiling water and a few minutes, no extra microwaving required (as is the case with some other instant oatmeals). If you don't like oatmeal to begin with, you probably don't want to go all-in with a month's supply. But if you have the chance to sample it, try it out, it might change your mind.

review/summary: Not as good as I had hoped
review/text: I am trying to eat more oatmeal and don't have time to make steel cut during the week.  I had a single packet serving of this at a coffee shop and thought that it was pretty good so I decided to get a box.  I am not sure if I got a bad batch or what the issue is but for whatever reason the preparation is not coming together.  I have tried using both the boiling water method (the method I prefer) and the microwave method for cooking this oatmeal and have tried varying the amount of water that I use but no matter what I try the mix does not blend.  It's hard to describe the issue, but instead of the oats forming together into a consistent creamy oatmeal they remain individual waterlogged oats.  I cancelled my subscribe & save subscription and am going to go back to trying to use my rice cooker to make steel cut oats overnight instead.

It's easier to stop after 1 bag with the white cheddar.<br /><br />The good news is that, unlike many soy-content chips, these have a very nice (not at all mealy) texture.  Nor are there any red-flag ingredients to worry about.  The bad news is that they are higher carb than I had hoped.  Here's the breakdown for a bag of these lemon-herb chips...<br /><br />calories - 110 (30% from fat)<br />fat - 3.5g<br />carbs - 14g<br />protein - 10g<br /><br />If you're on a low carb diet, these probably won't fit.  The cheddar chips might (10g carbs).

review/summary: A little too much flavor
review/text: These things are good when you eat a few, but it's a little hard for me to finish an entire bag since they're so full of flavor (salt, herbs, etc). I have an entire drawer of them and am always reluctant to grab a bag for lunch since I don't really look forward to a mouthful of flavor. I was hoping they'd be a little more subtle like Cheezits (spelling?). This would be good for people who like a ton of flavor, but other than that, you probably won't like them enough to eat all of them.

review/text: Not gonna b.s. you on this, these are now my must have snack chip of choice. As far as a zesty, savory snack chip, these cannot be beat. I have tried all three flavors, and none are bad. Chili Nacho Cheese are by far my favorite though. In fact, after I write this review, I plan to buy another case.

review/summary: New formula - Texture STALE, many CRUMBS, downsized to 1.2 ounces.
review/text: I bought this product before they reformulated it, and of course now. This product has definitely changed for the worse. The texture is not crispy at all, and even borders on tasting stale. There were many crumbs in the bag, and the package has been downsized from 1.5 ounces to 1.2 ounces. Not much to like here anymore. I will be removing it from my subscribe and save. What a disappointment, because I really did enjoy them before.<br /><br />I am not allowed to review them independently but, there are several flavors if this product. At this time the Lemon Herb is still 1.5 ounces and the original formula. This could change at any time. I ordered another 12 pack of them before that formula also inevitably changes - they were terrific.<br /><br />C'est la vie

review/summary: Not doritos - but pretty good!
review/text: If you're expecting something as good as doritos, then you'll be dissappointed.  My family has eaten these for at least 3 years as my son had food allergies.  So, we're not necessarily eating them for the nutrition, that should say something.  They're good enough to eat just because.<br /><br />It is a personal preference.  If you generally like soy items, than you will probably like these.  The soy taste, light as it is, is what most of my friends don't like about them.  Kids seem to like them better than adults.  And, I would say the parm. & the nacho flavors are better.  However, we like these too.

review/summary: Tasty, Messy High Protein Snack
review/text: As part of a high protein diet, I have conducted a broad search for the most protein-rich foods. It is easy to find cheeses, meat, and protein shakes loaded with protein. It is much more difficult to find flavorful high protein foods that are traditionally carbohydrate rich.  Kay's makes a few good snack offerings that meet this requirement, including the Parmesan Cheese protein chips. At a cost of approximately 0.05 dollars per gram of protein, the protein affordability is on par with reasonably priced cheeses and meats but more expensive than protein shakes.<br /><br />Taste is matter of preference but I can say these snacks are indeed tasty from my perspective. Yet, they don't taste like other mainstream snacks such as Doritos or Cheetos. Hence, you may be inclined to eat them in moderation.<br /><br />One big downside to this snack is the volume of crumbs created when eating. Oddly, many of the Kay's chips are far messier than mainstream alternatives. So, while Parmesan protein chips may make a nice snack while watching television, expect to eat over a large bowl or table napkin. Otherwise, you will have a mess of crumbs that will find their way into every crevice of your furniture.<br /><br />High protein foods are typically more expensive than foods rich in carbohydrates or fats.  So, I have recorded the nutrition of about 200 foods to find the best value in terms of lowest dollar cost/gram of protein. An excerpt is below. As you can see, the chips are a reasonably good value at 0.05 dollars/gram.  A typical strength athlete might need as much as 1 gram/kg of weight daily.  This would equate to about 10 dollars of chips per day for a 220 pound (100kg) athlete if eating nothing but Kay's protein chips. While not realistic, it gives consumers an idea of the expense involved. So, if you like the taste and can store a full case, they make a tasty component of your high protein diet at a reasonable cost.<br /><br />Pros<br />Taste<br />Moderate protein cost<br /><br />Cons<br />Extremely messy<br /><br />PARTIAL RANKED LIST OF PROTEIN RICH FOODS<br /><br />SOURCE .....

review/summary: A decent snack option for low carbing
review/text: I just received these, tore open the box, and snarfed down a bag.<br /><br />Unlike some of the other reviews, I did find these crunchy --they weren't soggy or soft at all. Overall, I like them because it's pretty hard to find salty crunchy snacks on a low carb diet. These compare to Medifast's Parmesan Snacks with the exception that these are flat and Medifast snacks are little balls, but overall the flavor is pretty much the same. Also, these are a MUCH cheaper option than Medifast or any of the other high protein low cal diet product, who charge about $15 for a box of 7. At the sale price of $9.25 for a box of 12, that's less than .80 cents per serving. Good deal.<br /><br />And, speaking of servings, I have a pet peeve for the manufacturer... the bag is 1.5 oz but the nutrional facts are based on a 1 oz serving. Gimme a break. Who's going to eat only two thirds of the bag and leave the rest? They tout 110 calories, but realize that you're actually going to get 155 calories, 5.25 grams of fat, 21 grams of carbs (not net carbs cuz this does have some fiber), and 15 grams of protein when you eat a whole bag. This still isn't horrible, so why not just tell us what we're going to get when we eat the whole little bag, which we will do :-).<br /><br />Also, these little chips do crumble easily. I think there were maybe 5 whole chips in my bag, the rest were smashed (but still tasty). Overall, I recommend this and for the price point, flavor, texture, and lack of other options. I will repurchase.<br /><br />Lastly, kudos to Amazon. I got free shipping through Prime and they were on my doorstep in 1 day.

review/text: Due to medical reasons I have to be on a high protein, lower carb diet.  These are a great snack.  It's nice to have something to crunch on instead of potato chips or tortilla chips.  The taste of these is okay.  I personally prefer the Kruncheez by Kay's Naturals.  While these don't totally taste like Parmesean, they do have a nice flavor.  The only reasons to not give 5 stars are that they don't really taste like the flavor specified, and each bag has 1.5 servings.  I really think the bag should be one serving when they are this size.

review/text: This is the first product I have ever reviewed.  I shop a lot on Amazon and rely on reviews and they have always helped me.  This product is so bad, that I felt I had to warn others.  I purchased it looking for healthy low fat snack.  First off, the package says low fat.  They may be low fat, but the chip is as greasy as they come.  Next, the chip has no snap too it.  It is soft and melts.  Not something you want in a chip.  Worst of all is the taste.  The cheese flavor is prominent but nasty.  Overall, avoid this product.  I should have been tipped off by the price, which is fairly low for a supposedly healthy and gluten free product in this quantity.

review/summary: Great alternative especially for fitness fanatics
review/text: When I opened up the whole case of protein chips, I was quite overwhelmed since I thought, WOW. Did I go a little overboard with this? I could not believe I bought a whole case without trying it first.<br />Anyway, I opened up one box just to taste it and it did not taste good at first. But as I kept on eating it, it just got better and better. I ended up eating this box all day periodically from morning till the end of my work day. Uh-oh, one box equals 5 servings. YIKES.<br /><br />As a fitness fanatic, I keep a high protein-low carb diet. This is an excellent substitute to my craving for potato chips and salty snacks. Unfortunately, there aren't that many healthy, salty snacks to choose from (I do not have a sweet tooth like the rest of the world). The Chili nacho flavor creates a party in my tummy, I wish it was spicy though but it does the job.<br /><br />So a whole case of Kay's protein chips?? Yeah, no problem!

review/summary: tastes great, filling, best "fake junk food" find
review/text: These really fill that need for something salty and crunchy while not actually being junk food. The nutrition info speaks for itself. The chips are small, so the bag takes a long time to munch through, so you don't feel like you took two bites and ran out. Their texture is similar to puffed rice/wheat/corn junk foods, like bugles or salsa fries. They kind of dissolve after the first initial crunch, as opposed to a chip made from a slice of potato, which just breaks into smaller hard pieces. This is my favourite flavor - the parmesean isn't bad, but this is really late-night-I'm-stoned-and-playing-video-games junk food goodness.

review/summary: Yes Yes Yes Thanks for Healthy Snacks Like This One
review/text: These "chips" are really freaking good for being so healthy. The thing is, you have to know what to expect when you are eating a high protein/fiber product like this one. It is not going to taste like a potato chip so kiss that fantasy goodbye if that is what you are expecting. I suppose some people have extremely refined taste buds when it comes to chips and have a hard time stomaching these. But seriously, they are extremely good, even you don't care a whole lot about them being healthy. They are crunchy and crispy and have a good dose of flavoring on them, and they are not too salty. These are perfect for people who want to add more protein to their diet in an easy way. I take a bag to school or on trips and they are awesome, especially good for days when I work out a lot. The price for these is really good too, especially if you score some extra savings with Amazon. As an afternoon snack, these beat anything you'll find in a vending machine price- and health-wise. It is products like this one that make my life a little easier so I don't have to struggle to eat healthy while being busy!

review/summary: One of the best low-carb snacks you can buy
review/text: If you're doing a low carb diet or even just want to cut down on them then these are really some of the best low-carb chips you can buy.<br /><br />Taste/Texture: They don't REALLY taste like chips but honestly its close enough to, say, a dorito, that it works. The texture is different, a little lighter than a chip which may be a positive for some people. You definitely get the chili nacho cheese flavor from it and in my opinion it's about the closest you're going to get to a "real" chip if you're looking for low carb. Haven't tried the other flavors though.<br /><br />Size: The bags are small, yes, but not that much smaller than a regular small sized bag of chips. You might find yourself eating more than one bag as a snack though.<br /><br />Price: Pretty good when you buy the bulk (12 pack) product although it works out to about a dollar a bag which IS a little pricey I guess but when you look at it as "12 dollars for a pack of 12" somehow, to me, it seems like a better deal. Also, if you like them, sign up for the regular deliveries and it shaves 2 dollars off each order AND includes free shipping so you really can't beat that. Considering the high price of a lot of speciality products (and this is) it's pretty inexpensive.<br /><br />Overall: A good purchase for low carb dieters, a tasty chip substitute, something even fans of traditional chips may enjoy. Good value.

review/summary: Decent alternative but not great.
review/text: These chips taste okay - although I probably would have liked the Nacho flavor better, they were 3 dollars more a case at the time I made my purchase. The main problem with these chips, is half of every bag is protein powder at the bottom of the bag, so your stuck trying to scoop it up with your fingers or end up just throwing it out. I guess, in trying to make them low fat, the oils that usually hold chips together is missing, so you end up with half a bag of crumbs. I ordered 3 cases and every bag is like this, so I don't believe it's an isolated problem.

review/summary: FABULOUS IN SOUPS AND LIGHT STEWS & SALADS!!!
review/text: These chips are wonderfully light and lightly seansoned and that allows one to use them in a variety of creative ways.<br />I have had gastric bypass and still have difficulty getting my daily protien intake because it is difficult to eat the protien they suggest.  However, with these chips and this flavor in particular I can travel with them and add them to just about any soup for a sustainable meal with crunch and nutrional value.<br />Unlike the more pronounced flavors of nacho cheese ( superb choice for football games etc.) I can enjoy these as a part of a meal even in salads.<br />Bravo Kays' for making such a wonderful product.<br />WHERE ARE THE CINNAMON ONES?  THEY MAKE A GREAT QUICK BREAKFAST!!!!!!!!!<br />M

review/text: The flavor of the chips are good, but the texture is a bit off.  They really douse the chips with Parmesan and herbs, but once you start chewing they start to taste really weird.

review/summary: Pretty Good - Very High in Protein
review/text: These are pretty good.  I mean, the seasoning tastes really good (I'm a sucker for good seasoning...).  I can't really say much about the crackers themselves as they don't really stand out in any way (this isn't to say they're bad, they're most definitely not), they're just crackers, EXCEPT---you get a great amount of protein from one little bag (a 1.5 oz bag has 15g of soy protein and 4.5g of fiber, which is not too bad).<br /><br />The calorie count for the same 1.5 oz bag is 165, the fat count is 5.25g, which isn't super great, but it's way better than the count from the same amount of potato chips and you're getting much more protein and also fiber, so not too bad if you have a craving for something salty and seasoned.  Also, they're just more satisfying.  You don't feel the urge to immediately eat another bag like you often do with chips.  Probably because of the soy protein and fiber, huh? &lt;g><br /><br />If there had been a choice for 4.5 stars, I would have taken it, but just couldn't go to the 5 for some reason, but I'll definitely be buying them again just to have on hand when the craving for salt and spice hits.  Which, unfortunately for me, is quite often.  Oh well, there are worse things I could do... &lt;VBG>

review/text: I am on a high protein, low carb, low fat, low sugar diet. More than sweets I crave salty chips and crackers, something to munch on in front of the TV. These are delicious! If someone told me they were bad for me I would believe it. They don't necessarily taste like anything else on the market...maybe a wheat thins toasted chip? They are very crunchy and light not heavy or gritty like other high protein crackers. The only downside is that each individual size bag is actually 1.5 servings and of course once it's opened, I am going to eat it all because I have no self control. These are going to become a staple in my diet from here on out, the perfect substitute for potato chips, without that guilty feeling after.

review/summary: Pretty darn good
review/text: I'll be honest, I bought these on a whim because I needed another item to push me over the minimum for SuperSave shipping.  I was browsing pantry items because I figured I might as well buy something I'd need anyways, and I came across these chips when looking for healthy snacks.  While I'm not typically a big consumer of "natural" foods (nothing against them, I just don't go out of my way to sneak them out), I try to stay away from obviously unhealthy foods and thought it couldn't hurt to try these as a substitute for less-healthy snacks like chips.  My expectations weren't very high, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that these chips are really pretty tasty.  They're salty and crunchy yet not greasy.  I'm not saying I wouldn't prefer regular old potato chips all else equal, but if you're looking for a healthy alternative and debating giving these a try, I say go for it (because we all know "all else" isn't really equal...).

review/text: After saying goodbye to chips about a year ago I've missed them.  Chips taste amazing am I right?  The bad thing is they are extremely unhealthy with tons of bad fats in them, including they have no nutrition.  It's just pure unhealthy.  As someone who is trying to get a lot of protein in their diet I had seen these.  Since I've missed chips so much I thought I'd try them.  The hard truth is while these are healthy the taste is really just not that good.  They're good enough to like them but not good enough to love them either.  I may buy more of this in the future but I may look for other products instead.  Just because these are great for protein, 12g protein, low fat, low calories, and decent taste Ill give these 4/5 stars

review/summary: Good Snack!
review/text: This was my first time trying this product and I enjoyed it.  I liked the amount of protein in the snack which is what motivated me to buy it.  The flavor was good (chili nacho cheese) and I will definitely try the others.  One big plus (besides the nutritional content) is the amount in each bag.  Usually with individually bagged chips I'm always reaching for more, but these have large portions in them that leave your crunch craving satisfied.  My only complaints (which are very minor) are that the bags are a little difficult to open and your fingers are left a bit messy.

review/summary: LOVE them!
review/text: the best healthy chip I've ever had. The serving size is quite satisfying and the taste can't get any better. I've had the parmesan and nacho cheese...the lemon don't appeal to me but I haven't tried them. They really are delicious and you won't regret buying them. Don't expect doritos or your conventional chip though. They are definitely DIFFERENT than your grocery store chip but really really good!

review/summary: Good, but pricey
review/text: I ususally buy Genisoy tortilla chips, but can't seem to locate them in-stock anywhere. So I decided to try the Kay's chips, because they are high protein also. They are good, but very pricey. I don't think I'll buy them again-  just didn't think they were worth the cost. I hope I can find the Genisoy chips soon.

review/summary: Yummy delicious crunch
review/text: I ordered both the Chili Nacho and the Parmesan. I found the chili nacho may favorite. I am vegetarian with a gluten sensitivity, so these are wonderful for giving me a healthy crunch with protein and no gluten. I have like these as well as most chips. I have now subscribed and I hope I don't run into the stale problem another reviewer did.

review/summary: Good snack food
review/text: THe chips taste great i love them, the only problem i have witht hem and this i why i gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the chips are kinda small and some times its like eating crumbs because they get smushed easily. OTherwise the chips are great. nice little healthy snack. also the packaging of the 5 oz bags arent very good either, but the product taste is great.

review/summary: Good for gluten free
review/text: I like the flavor of these chips.  They did seem to leave a bit of a film taste in my mouth when I was finished eating them but if I chewed a piece of gum, the problem was gone.  I think these are pretty good for gluten free.  They are good to keep in the car and at school for a quick pick me up snack.

review/summary: OK but not as good as the big bags.
review/text: I bought this same product in a health food store in bigger bags... BUT I guess it was not the same in the smaller bags.  They were called Parmesan Chips but they were not as crunchy and they were full of parmesan.  There was almost too much parmesan on the chips in these smaller bags and it seemed as though at least 1/4 the bag is parmesan.  They just were not as good as the bigger bag.  Maybe it was a manufacturing error... but I will not buy them again.  I really wanted them for a protein supplement to my snaks.  OH WELL.<br /><br />If someone gets these and they are crunchy then I really would like to know that.
