review/summary: "Regular" Cola flavor has artificial taste
review/text: The regular cola flavor has a terrible diet taste.  I hate artificial sweeteners, just can't get used to the chemical taste. I just plain don't like it at all, and poured the rest of the syrup down the drain after using only enough for 1 bottle of soda.  Yep, it's that bad.

review/summary: Warning, non-diet syrup contains Sucralose (Splenda)
review/text: This stuff would be pretty good if it wasn't for the artificial sweetener.  I'm not sure why they insist on putting sucralose into a product labeled as non-diet, especially after touting that it contains real cane sugar.  It does, in fact, contain real sugar.  But the advantage is negated by the unmistakable aftertaste caused by the sucralose.<br /><br />I think they're trying to keep the calorie count down by creating a "half diet" drink.  But I don't like diet drinks.  I've never had one that didn't have some sort of weird taste or aftertaste.  I don't drink a lot of colas either, but I like to treat myself to one every now and then.  So, when I do drink one, I want one with real sugar, no HFCS, and no artificial sweeteners.  I used to seek out Mexican Coke for this, and I was hoping to get a similar product with the Sodastream.<br /><br />I think a lot of people are attracted to the Sodastream by the prospect of getting a purer product.  They're going to be disappointed by the presence of artificial sweeteners in these syrups.  It's not a big deal to me because I mostly use the Sodastream to make plain seltzer, but I'm sure their syrups would sell better if they would get rid of the sucralose.

review/summary: Sodastream
review/text: After years of dealing with increasing price of soda, finding place to store it and returning  empty bottles decided to give this a try. We bought ours at Costco which came with 1-130L Co2 Carbonator, 2 1-Liter Stainless Steel Bottles and trial flavors pack for $99. First let me say I'm very pleased, the flavors are not bad at all and i can use my own filtered water from either the fridge or Pure faucet attachment and no longer need to pay or bring back bottles for the deposit. They also have much less sodium than store bought soda with the exception of Diet Rite.<br /><br /> I have tried many diet flavors and the ones i like the best are Orange, Caffeine free cola, dr pete, Fountain Mist, Cream Soda and Root Beer. As for the cost it has changed everything, no longer have to pay deposit, return empties or search for sale price on soda which means lot less trips to the store saving me from impulse buying and gasoline usage. I can now make fresh bottles of soda whenever I need it (unlike store bought soda which can lose carbonation)  and any flavor I feel like at the time. Already used up  1- 130L Co2  carbonator bottle so ordered 1 full bottle + 1 exchange for empty bottle from SodaStream web site this way I'll always have one full bottle when one is done. You should always search the web for coupons for any online store before ordering and SodaStream is no exception, saved $15 which is the price of the license on a new bottle.  So it cost me the same as if ordering to exchange 130L Co2 Carbonators, pretty sweet. If you order 10 bottles of syrup at a time you get one free  and with on line coupons and cashing in points your earn from them with every purchase can save you more than just the shipping cost, the cost of a trip to the store. For me the SodaStream is well worth the cost.

review/summary: Great flavor, and even better price.
review/text: I drink energy drinks maybe once or twice per week.  I usually stick to red bull or rock star as those cans don't overdo the caffeine and have a decent flavor.  The soda stream mix tastes very similar to rock star and costs a lot less money.  Just watch your serving size when you use the soda stream.  All canned energy drinks have a limit whereas you could drink the whole bottle of soda stream if you don't watch your serving size.

review/summary: Some are good, some are not so much.
review/text: Some of the flavors we have tried:<br />Diet Cola<br />I do not like diet cola. I don't like diet Coke, diet Pepsi or diet other drinks. We bought this flavor so we could make diet drinks for someone who might like a diet cola when we were making our own soda. However, this is really one of the better diet drinks that I have tried. If you make your own soda, this is a good one to try.<br /><br />Orange<br />This is the best one by far of all of the flavors we have tried. This flavor tastes just like the fanta orange soda. We love this one.<br /><br />Cola<br />This cola flavoring is ok. It's not great. You can easily make simple syrups that will not be a cola flavor but will taste much better than this flavor. This is the equivalent of RC Cola. Ok but it's not near as good as other name brand colas.

review/text: I love the Soda Stream unit, but the syrups need some tweaks.  It is too sweet, so I use half the amount required; this is good if you want the product to last longer; this is bad because they use Splenda added to all their recipes, not just the diet.  If they would just use plain old sugar, I'd be much happier with this product.

review/summary: Splenda in every flavor...tastes horrible
review/text: Wanted the Sodastream for my birthday.  Got it, made up the first cola.  It was horrid.  Got to reading about the products.  Sodastream seems to be so proud that they did not include aspartame in their diet products, and used only sugar in their non-diet products (Instead of high fructose corn syrup).  However, they also put Splenda (another artificial sweetner like aspertame) in every flavor they make...diet or not.  It leaves a horrible aftertaste in the non-diet drinks.  The whole point of not drinking diet pop is because people don't like the taste of diet pop.  My Sodastream is going back to the company with a message stating that if I wanted diet pop I would buy it myself, and they should only put sugar in regular soda.  They brag about real sugar, and then hide artifical sweetner in every product hoping no one will notice.  It shows in the bad taste of their regular sodas, and, in my opinion, does not make them a very reputable company.  Buyer beware.

review/summary: Decent Set of Flavors But
review/text: You have to sample them all to find the ones you like.  You'll miss out if you judge them all after tasting one or two.  My favorites are Diet Orange, Diet Raspberry/Cranberry, and Diet Energy. Diet Dr. Pete and Diet Root Beer aren't bad either.  They mix well with alcoholic beverages as well.<br /><br />HOWEVER<br /><br />I encourage everyone to visit the SodaStream webstore BEFORE purchasing any of products here. There are many flavors at the SodaStream webstore not offered here like DIET Energy and DIET Orange.  Also, as of 2/15/2012, they charge 40-50% less at the SodaStream webstore but you may have to pay for shipping.  However, if you buy 10 bottles at Sodastream, you'll get 1 bottle free.  I'm not slamming the Amazon merchants but I think consumers should be aware of the significant price mark-up.<br /><br />(With this exception, I've found Amazon prices to be competitive with other stores so I continue to be an Amazon Prime Member.)<br /><br />If you only want one bottle, it may make sense to pay twice as much with free Amazon Prime shipping.

review/summary: Energy Drink vs Red Bull
review/text: I love this product.  I've heard alot about the Sodastream and finally decided to purchase one, and as I drink a lot of Red Bull (mainly as a cocktail mixer), I gave this mix a try.  Quite impressed on just how I can't really tell the difference between this Energy Drink Sodamix and Red Bull, other than the price.  On average I spend about $2.25 per can of Red Bull, and this Sodamix will yield 50 8oz servings, so easy math says $112 for 50 cans of Red Bull or $6.99 for the Sodastream Energy Drink Sodamix 16.9 Fl oz bottle and 50 8oz servings.  And as not to be biased, I have a few friends who also drink Red Bull who all agreed that it was a toss up on tasting the difference between the two products, and how much money could be saved.

review/summary: Diet Flavors are Not Great - Nasty Aftertaste
review/text: I absolutely love my Sodastream because I drink a lot of sparkling water and this has saved me a fortune! Recently I thought it would be great to have some of the soda flavorings around for guests, mixed drinks, etc. However, I have not been thrilled with diet flavors I have tried so far. Of the three I have tried (diet tonic, diet ginger ale, and diet root beer), I think the diet root beer is the best, but is not even close to any of the name brand diet root beers.  Both the diet ginger ale and diet tonic have a nasty aftertaste - way worse than any name brand diet soda on the market.  The worst part about the aftertaste is that it doesn't seem to go away. As I write this, I still have a bad taste in my mouth - and it's been nearly a half hour since I drank some of the diet ginger ale. That alone compelled me to pull out my computer and log a review. I have tried them several times now, altering the amount of syrup to see if it would make a difference, and each time I end up pouring it down the drain. I am SO disappointed by this as I had high hopes for flavorings.

review/summary: Win some, lose some
review/text: I recently received a soda stream, and have been playing around with the flavors. What I find is that everyone has their own amount of syrup they like added to the bottle. For example, with the cream soda I had to use about half the recommended amount, but with the diet root beer I like to add more mix. The real thing with these flavors - you just have to try them. I really like the diet cranberry, diet grapefruit and the diet root beer is literally the best soda I've ever had - diet or non-diet. Some others I didn't like so much. The cola didn't really do it for me, and I'm on the fence over the ginger ale. There is a bit of an after taste on the sodas, but they do have a lower calorie count (even the non-diets) than regular sodas. All in all I like the soda stream, it's fun, but I still buy Coke and some other sodas. I am looking forward to trying some more of the exotic soda stream flavors (BBB has almost all of them in stock) and playing with making my own.<br /><br />3 stars because... well, win some, lose some with the flavors. It's all subject to taste.

The diet cola does not have the classic metal taste and no aspartame. If you love diet soda you will love this. If you don't, you will leave a poor review. I thought it would taste like a cheap store brand diet cola, and it is so much better than that. It reminded me of Coke Classic.

review/text: I got a SodaStream for my birthday.  It comes with a 12 pack syrup sampler with 6 diet syrups and 6 "regular" syrups.  I have only tried the diet, caffeine-free syrups.  None of them come close to tasting anything as good as the diet drinks I buy at the grocery store.  Even the store brands taste better than the SodaStream diet drinks.  They remind me of the pre-Nutrasweet sodas that used saccharine as the sweetener.  I use my Soda Stream to make seltzer and it does a great job at that!  I've been experimenting with using drink mixes like Crystal Light, and those work OK.  DISCLAIMER:  I'm one of the folks who get a bad aftertaste with Splenda and Splenda is the sweetener used in the diet SodaStream drink syrups.

review/text: Of the Sodastream syrups, this is my favorite.  Unlike the other flavors, which are very often poor remakes of classic brands, the orange flavor is unique. It has qualities of Orange Crush and Sunkist, but adds an original flavor that only it has.  Overall, it is a great flavor, and even pop snobs will likely enjoy it.  If you can't live without the classics, any flavor (including Orange) is not worth buying though, so be cautious, and try buying one instead of a three pack the first time.

review/text: I bought the regular cola flavor to give it a try, but after tasting it, I realized that it had artificial sweetener. I didn't think to read the ingredients before buying, since it wasn't diet. Not sure why they did that, since the first ingredient is SUGAR. I can't give it a good rating, as I stay away from artificial sweeteners and I feel that they were a bit deceptive by not making the fact that it contains artificial sweeteners more noticeable. I don't drink cola every day (maybe once a week or less) and I feel that sugar is OK in moderation.

These can be purchased for $3.99 - $4.99 (Bed Bath and Beyond, Kohls)for single bottles . I thought maybe this was the price for a double pack, but doesn't appear to be. At this price, this machine would not be very cost effective now would it?

review/summary: Ginger Ale Flavor is quite tasty!
review/text: The other reviews are correct in the fact that the "suggested" retail price is $4.99 per bottle.  Some sellers are ripping the consumers off by pricing them higher.  As always... caveat emptor!<br /><br />The Ginger Ale syrup is very good in my opinion.  It is very close to Canada Dry's Ginger Ale in crispness and tartness.<br /><br />I use the "three buzz" carbonation method and then fill the syrup cap to the line in the cap about a 1/2" from the top of the filler.  This creates the perfect syrup to carbonation ratio and makes a very drinkable and tasty ginger ale!

review/summary: Warning - Non-Diet Flavors contain Splenda
review/text: We love our Soda Stream and usually drink the bubbly water plain or make our own syrups (very easy to do), but I purchased the Root Beer flavor on a whim. We poured the recommended amount of syrup into the carbonated water and slurped. It was OK for a split-second, THEN came the after taste - YUCK!!!<br /><br />If you are NOT of the persuasion that Splenda is natural and don't enjoy aftertaste and don't want to acquire a taste for fake sugar, then this product is NOT for you.<br /><br />From now on, I'm not buying anything without reading the label first.

review/text: I agree with all the reviews about the price. It's really ridiculous that the appeal of this machine for our family was the cost of soda vs. the cost of this stuff. It' is 1/3 the price per serving of store bought soda, 1/2 the caffeine, 1/3 the sugar and calories, but it still tastes amazing. And we don't have bags and bags of recycling, and we can make whatever soda we want when we want. At this price, it's basically just buying 3 cases of soda on sale... what's the point??? When you can order it online from ANYWHERE ELSE for half the price, this is just absurd. Please just search for it, you'll find a better price in about 10 seconds.

review/text: I'm not sure what most of you pay for your sodas, but here they run around 85 cents a liter plus deposit of .05. When one adds the $25 for 60 liters of carbonation 25/60 (.42/L) and $6 for 12 L of flavor (.50/L) one is losing money with the home carbonation system. I do like the idea of making my own products though.

review/summary: Aftertaste
review/text: I bought the Sodastream after just looking at it for a while.  Then, decided to try it as I remember drinking "fizzies" many years ago and was shooting for that effect.  Sodastream does indeed add great fizz but beware the aftertaste.  I tried the orange and thought, while I was drinking it, that it was terrific.  But, then, for more than a day, I had an aftertaste like some of the diet drinks leave.  Same with the Root Beer.  And, even though the machine says add carbonation only to water and then add syrup, I decided to try adding carbonation to my own drinks, like Kool-Aid or Hawaiian Punch.  Other than being careful with the carbonation and making sure to clean the CO2 port afterward, it works very well.  However, even with my own drinks I still get the terrible aftertaste.  That part is very disappointing.  Not sure if that can even be removed.  Is it the carbonation itself?  Regular carbonated drinks do not have it.

review/summary: no need to buy the kit buy the syrup instead
review/text: Okay I am a soda drinker in some cases 1 litter a day plus. Then sodastream came across my tv screen. I was like okay it sounds great.When I found this my local store and saw the price for the unit. I said wow that is a big jump $130 plus to just buy the unit then you gotta buy the charging cartridges "co2" and bottles then the syrup all told it was near 200 to get me started and ready to go. So I said to myself hey I can buy soda water in my store for 88 cents per 2 liters and the syrup makes 6 or so liters per bottle depending on how strong you want the taste I buy the energy mix 2 or 3 bottles at a time and it lasts me about a month I still buy other soda buy much less and no more paying 3 bucks a can for red bull,oh side note if you are into jager bombs and so are your party friends buy a bottle of this and some soda water bottle of jager and have fun in my opinion it tastes better than real red bull

review/summary: Some flavors OK , some questionable
review/text: Ive heard many reviews about Sodastream: most bad, a few OK. I understand that Sodastream sodas cant taste exactly like regular soda so im not expecting them to taste exact. With that said Im pretty pleased with or am OK with most of the flavors that ive tried. Bellow are my reviews of a few.<br /><br />Cola: 5/5 stars Doesnt taste exactly like Coke but is close. One of my favorites.<br /><br />Orange: 5/5 stars If youve tried different brands of Orange soda you will notice that some taste better than others. This tastes like cheaper dollar store orange soda, so is similar to Sunkist, but it still tastes pretty good & does taste like a known orange soda.<br /><br />Lemon Lime (Sprite): 4/5 Tastes like Sprite at first but leaves an odd after taste. Ive noticed that if you open your mouth after each drink the after taste is minimal. If it werent for the after taste I would give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Cranberry Raspberry: 5/5 Not sure what to compare it to, but it tastes great with no weird after flavor.<br /><br />Energy: 5/5 This came in the trial pack, & since im not into energy drinks I sipped it & had a friend try it. It gets 5 stars because it tastes just like Red Bull according to both of us.<br /><br />Dr. Pete: 3/5 Its OK but it tastes pretty vanillaish & not all that close to Dr. Pepper. You can sort of taste the similarity but not enough to say "WOW! JUST like or very similar to Dr. Pepper!!!".<br /><br />Overall Im still a big Sodastream fan, & most of the flavors ive tried I would buy again.

review/summary: Terrible bitter taste
review/text: First, I'd like to say I'm a soda enthusiast,and enjoy a variety of brands - store brand regular brand. It's not that I can't tell the difference. I like to.<br /><br />However, diet lemon-lime is not different, it's NASTY.<br /><br />It has an incredibly bitter aftertaste. I drink diet sodas all the time and nothing has a bite like this. I kept trying it thinking I would like it or I did something wrong, but it tasted nasty every time.<br /><br />Having said that, I think it's worthy to note that SodaStream makes a variety of flavors, some of which are unique and delicious. In addition, I have made some drinks with this base by mixing in some tastier flavors.<br /><br />As another review stated, SodaStream does NOT save money. But it is pretty fun.

review/summary: The ENERGY drink is the only one I can tolerate, and I love that one!
review/text: We got a Sodastream for Christmas. My kids have lots of fun making soda, and for them it's really become a passed-fad already and it's only July. For myself though, I think all of the sodas are totally gross except for the Energy drink one. They all have this creepy flavor, I'm not sure what exactly it is?  You know how Coke tastes great, and Walmart  Cola tastes okay, if you had to drink it instead of Coke you would live, right? Well these soda flavors are like three notches below the generic sodas at the store. Like I mentioned, they all have some weird flavor.<br /><br />Except the Energy drink. WOW, if you like Red Bull, then you are going to LOVE LOVE LOVE this. It's like the flavor of Red Bull, bumped up ten times. Plus, I'd say it gives me more energy than Red Bull. Okay, not energy, but the shakes and the so-alert-I-may-explode feeling. It makes me so jittery, IF I drink a lot of it, that I can't think straight and my heart is pounding. If you like that, you'll love this.<br /><br />To me, I look for the Guarna (sp?) in energy drinks, and this has the absoute most guarna flavor of anything I've tried. I LOVE IT.

review/summary: Some really great and some really really bad
review/text: Diet Cranberry Raspberry - The BEST flavor I've tried yet. It's just sweet enough, great flavor, and calorie free. I always have at least three bottles of this in my cabinet at all times.<br /><br />Orange - Very sweet but good. I'm not a fan of orange soda so that's probably the only reason I don't love this.<br /><br />Lemon-Lime - Again, very sweet. It has a good sprite-type flavor though so I went ahead and tried the diet version as well to see if that would be a staple in our house.<br /><br />Diet Lemon-Lime - It's not an all time favorite but it's good. I have a bottle of this usually for whenever I'm craving something different or something a bit more refreshing and I'm tired of plain water.<br /><br />Cream Soda - WAY too strong. I love cream soda and so I didn't expect any issues with it but just the smell when opening the bottle was enough to make me slightly sick to my stomach. And I'm not exaggerating. I actually threw out the entire bottle after one sip. It has an almost alcoholish undertone to it that doesn't help at all. Gross.<br /><br />Root Beer - Not even close to as bad as the cream soda but slightly reminiscent. I did drink the entire sample that came with the Sodastream but do not plan to buy a bottle of it even though I am a huge fan of root beer.<br /><br />Cola - I bought this to act as an emergency back up for when my husband wanted a rum and coke and didn't have any coke in the house. It tastes a bit like off-brand diet cola to me, probably because of the Splenda. This is very off-putting only because there is so many calories in this and you don't even get a calorie-laden taste. Hahaha. This will continue to be held for those emergencies but we won't be drinking it by itself at all.<br /><br />Grape - This one actually surprised me because I was so prepared not to like it. It's a bit on the sweet side but still much better than many others. I've been putting about 1/4th the amount of syrup in less than called for and it helps cut the sweetness a bit but after that it starts to make the flavor taste watered down. I wish I could find a diet version of this. Not sure if it exists or not but I can't find it on Amazon if it does.<br /><br />I'll update this as I try more. I am cautiously optimistic about the diet ginger ale so that will be my next purchase.

review/summary: A fairly "meh" generic cola.
review/text: I love my Soda Stream, and most of the mixes I've used have been quite good (pretty much any of their fruit flavors, their Dr. Pepper substitute,  Root Beer and Energy Drink have all been quite tasty), however the one flavor that really stands out as a disappointment is the cola flavor. I can forgive the fact that it doesn't taste like Coke or Pepsi-- I have tried other "b-list" colas that tasted good in their own way-- however, this one is overall just plain bland. It's not sweet enough, and it lacks the "kick" that I expect from a cola. I tried making the most of it by adding additional ingredients-- once I used vanilla, and it made the soda even more bland. The other time i used some cheap whisky my room mate bought, and it was probably the nastiest mixed drink I've ever had (I'm not a heavy drinker though, keep in mind, and I blame the crappy alcohol more than the soda for that one).<br /><br />I have not explored other options for cola syrups yet, but this is one I don't expect I'll be buying again unless they change the formula. I'm pretty sure there's got to be a better option out there that does not involve spending $150 on a 5 gallon bag of Coca Cola syrup (which would have the high fructose corn syrup that I've been trying to avoid anyway).

I use a half packet of lemon and Orange, 1 packet of stevia, and a short squirt of cherry per liter bottle. Now the flavor falls between generic and brand name.  Cheaper than using cans, but not cheaper than using two liter bottles.  The calorie count is about a third of normal cola.  You have to be comfortable with Splenda and Ace-K as Soda Stream uses those to offset some of the sugar (not corn Syrup a plus).  Thankfully no Nutrasweet/aspartame as I get terrible headaches from that.

review/summary: False advertising?
review/text: I chose the diet soda. Notice that the total amount of the product is not written. I was perplexed at first, but then discerned that the product image clearly says 750ml. So at $8.39 it seemed to be a decent price. However what I received was a 500ml bottle. Not worth the hassle of returning for a couple of bucks, but an annoyance none the less. So beware when you purchase. I suggest you assume that you will receive a 500ml bottle.

review/summary: Price is 2.6 times as high as sodastream direct
review/text: I am in agreement with several of the users.  I can buy any of these flavors for 4.99 online, at the manufactures website.  Why would I pay 8.99 to 13.99 for the same.  This is nothing but a customer advisory.  Buy the syrups direct and save a bundle.  As for the product, its a great product.  Spending 99.00 on the machine means I have to drink a LOT of soda to equal 99.00 of sodas but it is more fun and a lot less waste.

review/summary: Tastes like Redbull, doesn't look so much like Redbull and smells a little vitaminy
review/text: First thing, this does give you energy just like an energy drink. It also tastes very similar to Redbull. When I burp, it has the similar energy drink belch smell that energy drinks have for some reason. The color is not quite the same as Redbull.<br /><br />But having said all that I still find this to be an excellent value when you compare the prices of Redbull vs this mixture. At the store, Redbulls are $1.99 where as this one costs maybe $0.40 after all is said and done (cost of carbonation, syrup, shipping charged on carbonation, etc). I made that number up in my head though, did not use a calculator or even really think mathmatically about it so it is pretty much a made up cost I pulled out of the air and doesn't represent anything truthfully.<br /><br />Anyhow, I know it is a much cheaper solution, I enjoy it and am drinking some now.

Amazon sells it for more than Kohl's and Kohl's sells it for more than Bed Bath and Beyond.  I look forward to Amazon having a more competitive price so I can "load-up" in the near future (hint-hint).  Either way, I like the diet Lemon-Lime Soda mix better than diet 7up. 'Nuff said?

review/summary: Flavors from home and childhood
review/text: The sodastream has been a real help to my family we are currently serving overseas and while there is an abundance of coke here the other flavors of soda are shall we say lacking! Some are so bitter that they are not palatable to my family. Rootbeer is a favorite and the sodastream has it nearly perfect to the rootbeer my dad made when I was young! I think that a touch more syrup is necessary to reach the true rootbeer flavor so it gets one less use for my family than the bottle says and I think there is an underlying mint flavor that is not overwhelming or unwanted but a bit noticeable to me. I did not give it 4 stars because the items arrived dented and not packed as well as I would have liked to make the journey overseas not punctured but close. It was however shipped quickly and without delay. I have not tried the diet in any flavor other than cola and with  the significantly lower sugar count in the regular probably wont but wouldnt mind hearin how they are! Thanks for shipping to us folks overseas since the sodastream site will not and where they have international sites they will only ship the flavor varieties for each country! That doesnt help much for me!

review/text: This green chili powder from silver cloud is a great powder. I searched all over for one and I could not find any at all until I came on to amazon. I happily did my research and found that this would be the best buy for my money, but since buying it it has been the best flavor for my money as well.<br /> It does evoke a fresh green taste to my green chili. It does not make things hot, it makes them better, fresher, greener almost. Since using this to make my green chili I have had not only my husband ask me to make my chili, but his uncle asked me as well and I am happy to oblige their wish.<br /> With this seasoning it makes my chili taste so much better. My husband and his uncle both told me that my green chili is to them almost addictive (they can't eat one bowl they both have to have two), and all I had to do was add this simple spice. I make a lot of this during the fall and winter trying it during the summer was for the testing of this spice in it and it seems it has been worth the sweat, LOL. I am thrilled with this purchase and I will buy more from this company.<br /> I will make more green chili and let my guys feast on it. Thank you Amazon and Silver Cloud for having just what I needed and the spice for having excellent flavor!

review/text: *****<br /><br />This Lemon Ginger Tea from Yogi Tea is for easing occasional indigestion and gas, and for enhancing circulation. It's a delightful, all natural tea made from ginger root, lemon grass, lemon peel, licorice root, black pepper, peppermint leaf, natural lemon flavor, ascorbic acid, and natural licorice flavor. Most of the ingredients are organic. The taste is lemony, peppery, slightly herby and a little sweet, very nice anytime, but especially after a meal. It's a very unique tea that is a true treat.<br /><br />This is my second Yogi Tea to taste and review, and I am definitely impressed with the tea and the company. Lemon Ginger Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: "Lemon Ginger tea is a special healing formula designed to aid digestion, ease upset stomach and provide a caffeine-free pick-me-up. Ginger (Zingiber officinale) has been used for centuries to treat minor stomach ailments, warm the metabolism and reduce nausea associated with motion.

The World Health Organization (1999) reports that Ginger stimulates the appetite and can be useful in a wide variety of stomach complaints. Made with Organic Ginger, this blend is formulated to boost digestion and circulation. The sourness of Lemon promotes the secretion of digestive juices and provides the perfect counterpart to the pungent-sweet taste of Ginger. Our formula is augmented with Organic Licorice, to support the adrenals and enhance the effectiveness of other healing herbs; Organic Peppermint, to help with digestion and reduce gas; and Organic Black Pepper, a powerful detoxifier. For centuries, Lemon and Ginger have been used together for their complementary tastes and healing properties. Enjoy a cup of Lemon Ginger tea when your tummy needs a little taming, when you need to reinvigorate your body and mind, or when you just want a delicious healthy drink."<br /><br />There is a warning on the box that if you have indigestion or heartburn that persists you should see a doctor.

Ginger is known to be a remedy for nausea, including morning sickness... but the thing I thought was funny about this product was that it says on the box to check with your doctor if you are pregnant!  I did, she said as long as it wasn't the only thing I drink all day, I should be ok! But if you are pregnant, I would check with your own doctor before use.  The thing that dissappointed me a little bit was that when I got my package, the box was smushed.  They had only packed it in a bubble mailer envelope.  However, I have had a few glasses of this tea now, and I must say, it does take the edge off of my nausea!  It is not very spicy or overly gingery like other ginger drinks I have tried.  I would recommend to other pregnant women... but ask your doctor first, like the box says!

review/summary: Gave me indigestion, but good otherwise
review/text: When I bought this tea, I did not have indigestion. I bought it because I had a sore throat and figured something with lemon and ginger would be good to ease the sore throat and clear up congestion as I've used a tea with fresh lemons and ginger before to help with colds.<br /><br />The tea was relatively good for the purpose of my sore throat and congestion, but I've been taking it for two days and developed indigestion. I constantly feel as if I need to burp. This rarely happens to me because I don't drink soda and when I do have acid reflux symptoms, it's usually a light burning feeling in my esophagus, not this uncomfortable trapped air and burping sensation. I am wondering if I have a mild allergy to one of the ingredients in the tea.<br /><br />So, I do think this is a good tea and it can help with certain symptoms, but you may want to test it out before taking it every 20 minutes as directed. (Note: I took the tea twice the first day and once the second day).

review/text: My regular matzo farfel was out of stock so I decided to try this whole grain version as a healthy alternative. Big Mistake. Before you order this stuff, make sure you taste some whole grain matzo first --- if you like the flavor than go ahead. It comes out much darker and more fibrous than regular matzo farfel. In our family this stuff was a big flop. My wife decided to throw the other five cans in the garbage as she didn't want to try and save this purchase by mixing it with regular matzo farfel --- so for me this product was a total loss.

review/summary: organic green tea
review/text: The taste is mild and delicious.  Everyone knows green tea is good for your health.  It also enhances the effects of antibiotics, has antioxidative properties (destroying free radicals), protects your heart by lowering cholesterol and improves lipid metabolism and tastes great!

review/summary: Great flavor
review/text: This tea has a wonderful mild, but distinct taste.  Organic is a huge plus!  There are 4 tea bags in a sealed package, thus the product stays very fresh since the entire box is not exposed once opened.  I'm enjoying this immensely!  Downside...can't think of any.

review/summary: Definately A  Great Find!
review/text: This tea is wonderful. It has a very pleasant smell and smooth taste. I sweeten with Madhava Agave Nectar(low glycemic) which I also buy from amazon. It is very hard to find both decaf and organic green tea. I hope amazon continues to carry this great product!

review/summary: Misleading
review/text: Item's picture shows box with 40 tea bags, totaling 2.56 OZ (72g).  What I have actually got is box with 40 tea bags, totaling 1.73 OZ (49g)!  You will get very little tea in one bag - approximately 1.2 grams.  That is rip-off!  Thanks to Amazon customer service for appropriate partial refund. Tea is very good though!

review/summary: great taste - hot or iced
review/text: It's difficult to find organic decaf tea in stores.  The packaging prevents the tea from going stale.  The only drawback is that the teabags are only good for about a 6 oz cup of tea.  I usually use 2 teabags for a 12 oz mug.  That's the only reason it got 4 stars, otherwise it would be 5/5.

review/summary: Great tea - be informed about packaging
review/text: This is a great decaffeinated organic green tea - especially, since there aren't that many choices on the market today. However, I wish I'd read some of the reviews before ordering so that I understood that the bags are not individually wrapped. There are 4 bags to a package. Which has its pluses and minuses, in my opinion. I like to take tea with me when I go out to eat and it's much more convenient, for me, to have one tea bag in a package, rather than four. But, how picky do you want to get? And, is it enough to keep me from purchasing this product again? I'm not sure? It's probably the best value around but, for me, there is definitely a trade off between value and convenience.

review/summary: Best Green Tea in my Opinion
review/text: Bigelow Decaffeinated Organic Green Tea is my favorite green tea and I've tried lots of different brands.  It's got great taste and texture.  I find myself mmm'ing after each sip because it's so good.  My only complaint is that the bags are bleached.  I do remember there tea being a lot stronger with a lot more tea in each bag (but that was at least 7-years ago), so if you like really strong tea you may want to check out another brand.

review/summary: It doesn't taste like it used to be. Too weak! like 3rd time with water
review/text: The last shipping I got, the tea is so horrible. It is like the 3rd time that you put water in...It is so weak. It hardly tasted like green tea that I used to get. I don't know what wrong with it. I ordered 6 boxes/each. So, it took me a few months to finish all 6 boxes. With 2nd package with 6 boxes those a received about a couple months ago, they are so terrible. It almost does not smell like a real tea any more.
