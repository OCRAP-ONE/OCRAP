review/summary: We love these!
review/text: Thank you for having these bars available for purchase.  This brand is no longer sold in the stores in my area and my coworkers and I just decided to pitch in together, get a case, and split them up.  They are MUCH better than the other brands in the store and the bottom of the bars don't burn in the oven (as long as you cook them properly).  The real bits of lemon are a treat and the best thing next to homemade lemon bars. We love them!!

review/summary: BEST LEMON BARS EVER
review/text: I love lemon bars and when I came across this at an Independent grocery store I was thrilled.  I didn't even know Betty Crocker made this product.  I do not like the "K" brand that is out there.  I had to try BC!  They exceeded my expectations!  Very easy to make and taste great.  I wish they were out there more on the grocery self.  I am on auto delivery now (subscribe & save). Thank you Amazon for this service!

review/summary: Great Salt, Good price
review/text: I bought a pound of this salt and I love it.  It is a great finishing salt, very delicate and flavorful.  Gets lost in the pan, so save it for the final splash.  It comes in a zip top bag for storage.  It is medium fine grain and small flakes, moist and white to slightly grey.  The package says Premium, Fine, No. II by Le Tresor.  I have had better salt direct from Guerande, but it cost more.

It was very difficult to find a dog food that does not compromise quality ingredients to make a food low fat. Since my dog is low energy (by no means a sled dog), her diet does not require her to have extreme protein intake. This food is the prefect balance of protein, quality meat sources, fat content, as well as important sources of fruits and vegetables and fish oils. Her eyes are bright and coat is shiny. While she hasn't lost any weight, she hasn't gained any either, which is a good thing!<br /><br />You get what you pay for when it comes to dog food. When purchasing this brand, one is paying for high quality food (meat content, veggies, fruits) without fillers or extreme levels of protein.<br /><br />For a more comprehensive analysis of dog food, check out [...].

review/summary: Great food to keep an older dog healthy!
review/text: Our dog is very healthy and happy on this food! He has no digestive or skin issues and he is never sick. He's an 8 year old American Eskimo Dog. We walk him a LOT, but he still doesn't need to eat as much as the package indicates. He eats the "weight loss" amount, but he's not losing weight, he's maintaining his weight. This isn't a complaint at all, but if you're going to feed this food to an older dog or a dog with a slower metabolism, monitor their weight carefully and make sure you're not feeding too much!

We'd been using the normal Wellness Healthy Weight and she seemed to enjoy that. We changed her to the CORE after she started to get red skin on her belly.

She also had has no tendency to want to eat this after it was digested (if you know what I mean!) which can be an issue with many weight management foods.<br /><br />I did my homework online and read a lot of online sites before switching. I can say hands down, Wellness CORE is a great food and if you can afford the small increase in price, I think you and your furry friend will enjoy its benefits.

review/summary: Great high quality dog food
review/text: I have two golden retrievers with hearty appetites.  Feeding them regular dog food makes them overweight.  I switched to Core Reduced Fat when I began to worry about the quality of the food I was feeding my dogs.  I had fed my dogs expensive dog foods which I got at the grocery store.  When I read the ingredients, I decied to look for something better quality.  From my research I learned that high quality dog foods prevent illness and disease and increase life-span.  Core is made with ingredients like real chicken--not chicken by-products or lots of grain.  Afterall, dogs are carnivores.  Since my dogs have been on Core they have not had the usual ear infections, skin allergies and irritations; their coats are beautiful; they have lots of energy and are overall very healthy.  The extra money I pay for this high quality dog food I definitely save at the vet!

He has lost some weight and I feel better knowing that he is getting well-rounded nutrition. Best of all the price here on Amazon is the best I have found. At other retailers I have seen this bag of food cost $10-15 more (sometimes even more than that). I will keep buying this from Amazon for as long as my dog wants it, and I am pretty sure that is going to be a long time! :)

review/text: For what it's worth, my 9lb. yorkie-poo loves this food, more than the other types of Wellness. The local Petco carries every flavor but this, so I have to order it on-line, but it is really worth it. Whenever I read about a dog having "..re-newed energy", or "...a shinier coat", I always scoff because that has never been the case with my dog. Even with the foods he loves, but with this particular type of dog food with this particular company, I have to say it's true. I tried all of the various Wellness foods, and he was okay with them, but this is the only one that he's ever really emptied the bowl, every time. That includes the Super 5 Max, or whatever it's called, the food for smaller dogs that somehow finds grains acceptable.

review/text: The pieces are VERY hard.. in fact, too hard for my 12+ year old to eat dry. I have to soak it in some beef or chicken broth in order for him to be able to eat it. I have never purchased grain free dog food, so I don't have any real comparison and it may all be this way. I do however always buy low-fat food. I tried the grain free because my dogs get dry, itchy skin and thought it might help. I have no idea how the taste is, because I don't eat it, but I did try biting into a piece to see how hard it was and it was. My dogs seem to like it as long as it's softened for them though.

review/summary: Helped my dog loses weight
review/text: I have two basset hounds and they tend to have weight problem especially since they have a mommy that dooesn't like to see them go hungry.  I feel good giving my babies this food because this company has a good reputation and they are consistently on the many lists of good pet food by independent raters.  I feed my babies half dry kibble and half home cooked chicken, turkey, beef fresh meats, and they also get daily multivitamins.  Jake actually host 2 lbs so he will get to keep the same amount bMy problem is that they get too much treats, mainly because I give them treats every time I have to give them medication or clean their ears.  So I decrease the food amount at breakfast and dinner to make up for the daily treats.  I also add some warm water to the dry kibble and let it soften the food, then add probiotic powder when cooled, and home coooked meats and vitamins. I like this brand as well as the Blue Buffalo and the Simple Life brands.  I wish Simple Life will make weight management foods.  I like the foods that are kept in special type of metallic zip lock bags to help keep it fresh.  Make sure you check the expiration date and odor to ensure the foods are not expired or have "off" odors.

review/summary: Wise switch from Iams Low Residue Formula
review/text: When my Rhodesian Ridgeback-mix developed mild pancreatitis two years ago at age three, my vet suggested Iams Low Residue food.  Over the last year, however, she's also developed severe skin allergies (but mostly air-borne, I think)and was losing hair in small patches so, after some research I added MSM to her diet and decided to eliminate grain. Wellness CORE Grain-Free food was the perfect choice because it is also low-fat (too much fat aggrevating her pancreas).  In the month she's been on it--both dry and wet formula--her coat has improved and she even seems perkier!

review/summary: Great dog food. Palatable & good ingredients!
review/text: Few things good about this product:<br />1. Made by Wellness. No recalls of any kind thus far. I am really paranoid about having a sick pet with a 3-4 figured vet bill, so that is something I look out for a lot.<br />2. Ingredients is a lot better than most foods.<br />3. Palatable. My dog kinda hates Wellness but would eat down Wellness Core products literally right away.<br />4. High Fiber. 7% if I am not wrong. What made me try this food was that my dog had constantly soft stools at one point in time. So I saw the high fiber percentage, and I decided to try this out. My dog had really solid poop after that! It helped a lot for me so hopefully will be the same for you.<br />5. Relatively reasonably priced. About $1.80/pound.<br />6. No ethoxyquin preservative used.<br /><br />Way(s) this product is "sub-par" compared to the "very top" products. (This is really no biggie at all, but I just decided to write this because for some it might be an issue)<br />1. Dried varieties of certain products as opposed to fresh ones, such as dried ground potato instead of fresh ones.<br />2. Canola oil used instead of salmon oil which is a cost cutting measure used by the company. Dogs can't digest canola oil so the omega levels provided by it are pretty much just for marketing purposes only.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't really be concerned with the "cons" of the product if you even consider it as a con to start with.<br />This is a really good product that is priced pretty reasonable for its quality.<br />I would feel safe about feeding my dog this based upon the manufacturer's reputation of not having any recalls in its history.<br /><br />Hope this helps!

His digestive system is a mess, and recently we learned his pancreas  numbers were off as well. This is why we decided to go low fat.<br /><br />It has been 12 days and the improvement is remarkable. We finally have good poop. It's a miracle!  PLUS he liked it right away as well.<br /><br />I researched dozens of dog foods over the last 6 months, and recently at least 6 low fat dry foods. This one appeared to be the best, and it is definitely the best for our dog!  We are VERY HAPPY with our choice. Plus it magically comes to the door via UPS.

review/summary: GREAT Dog Food
review/text: This is wonderful food, and would recommend it to anyone with a dog needing to lose weight, with a sensitive stomach, or allergies.  I had my toy poodle on Iams for 7 years.  I never did research on dog food, the breeder I bought her from had started her on Iams, so I continued on it.  She steadily put on weight over the years, & I switched to Iams Weight Control.  After continuing to gain weight, and just generally have no energy at all, I thought it's time for a drastic change.  At this point, I did A LOT of research on dry dog food.  I wish I had done this years ago!  I came to find out, that a lot of the well know brands, do not have quality ingredients.  After lots of research, I decided the Wellness Core Reduced Fat Grain Free was our best option.  She's been on it now for 5 months, and has went from nearly 8.5 lbs to just barely over 7, and still counting.  She seems to feel so much better.  AND...she loves the food too!

Dogs can't digest canola oil so the omega levels provided by it are pretty much just for marketing purposes only.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't really be concerned with the "cons" of the product if you even consider it as a con to start with.<br />This is a really good product that is priced pretty reasonable for its quality.<br />I would feel safe about feeding my dog this based upon the manufacturer's reputation of not having any recalls in its history.<br /><br />Hope this helps!

review/summary: OH, WHAT'S THAT?
review/text: Beaux and Ozzie smelled it coming through the door.  Oh, what's that?  Food!!  Then when I opened the bag and poured it out, they gave me the meanest look.  They wouldn't touch it.  I mixed with some off the shelf dry food.  No Joy!.  Finally ended dousing it with some chicken broth.  That got their attention.  Risk Reward decisions were quickly calculated and they ate.  Must do this now every time until the bag is gone.  $3.00/lb down the drain.

review/summary: Diamond Pet Foods RECALLED
review/text: Though I don't know if this particular one is recalled.<br />But I just thought I'd try to give a heads up.<br />So, this is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free,no dye or by product food.<br />I found that some of the food made by Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free ones made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named "Taste Of The Wild" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for "SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION"<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these "better than store" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the "better" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying

review/text: I LOVE Pacific Chai mix, both the spice and the vanilla. Just a few heaping tablespoons in a mug with hot water makes my morning complete. I know that sounds like a commercial, but I mean it. Buying it and making it yourself avoids buying similar drinks from Starbucks or Cosi at $3+ a cup! And, ordering Pacific Chai from Amazon and getting free shipping makes it cheaper than getting it from their web site. I highly recommend this product.

I use the spiced, vanilla, the caffeine free spiced and the caffeine free vanilla powder as well as the liquid for a cold chai drink.  I regularly hear customers say "yum" on their way out of the store.  You can use it at home as well because all you need is hot milk.

Even if you do eat a whole one, it's better than being able to help yourself to seconds. They are easy and quick to make and taste great. Yes they cost more than buying a cake mix and making a whole cake but they take less time, no added ingredients other than water, and again, no left overs. I have been buying them since they came on the market and will continue as long as they make them. The variety lets you have a different dessert each day too.

review/text: I ordered these because of their great price on amazon at the time.  I think they are okay, but the suggested cooking time is too long (I cook them 5-10 seconds less than recommended) and they do seem to have a 'chemically/processed' taste to them.  Also, I really don't like heating/microwaving plastic, as the bowls are made of.  Good in a pinch if you're craving a molten chocolate type dessert, but I wouldn't buy more than one at a time again.

review/summary: Nothing Says Lovin' Like a Microwavable Brownie...Well Sorta
review/text: Leave it to Betty Crocker to resuscitate the kiddie concept of the Easy Bake-Oven to produce their Warm Delights Hot Fudge Brownie. The serving size seems to remain the same child's portion as the old 1960's toy since it barely covers the bottom of the plastic bowl that contains the dry powder mix. The directions specifically state a tablespoon plus a teaspoon of water to moisten it, and knowing how temperamental baking can be, I would not try improvising this part or else you will get chocolate mush.<br /><br />Forty-five seconds in the microwave and then you squeeze a packet of sugary Fudge Topping on the top. It's not bad but just seems like skimpy gratification for the 370 calories it contains, 110 of which are fat. There's also 2 grams of trans fat, 270 mg of sodium and 61 grams of cholesterol. In other words, this is not a Weight Watchers treat by any stretch. But if you are in need of a quick chocolate fix, you could do worse. As an alternative, I suggest the much tastier Fat-Free No Pudge! Brownies you can get at Trader Joe's. Without the elaborate packaging Betty Crocker seems to think is necessary for an individual serving, you can bake a dozen and then allocate them as you wish.

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: I bought these cookes as treats for my son's flight wing at the Air Force OTS.  They only get so much room to keep their goodies (eats) and anything that doesn't fit in the plastic container has to be shared with the flight.  The other guys in the flight are my son's best friends, buddying up, etc. so they will get to share these great cookies. Obviously a good treat for them.  They crave anything from home - the mess food is great but they only get 10 minutes for meals and many times don't get enough to eat - so treats tide them over and remind them of home.

review/summary: Dry, Hard, Crunchy, Crumbs and Crumb Dust.
review/text: I ordered these cookies to send to my daughter who serves in the US Navy. She is out to sea for six or more months at a time. I have never ordered these cookies before so I was expecting something like I would receive at a Famous Amos's. You know, something a little soft and chewy to remind my daughter of home. What a mistake that was. These cookies are completely dry. As in dry as a bone and hard. When you bite into them they crumble into crumbs and crumb dust. Nothing but a dry mouth full of crumbs. I should have purchased Mrs. Fields or Grandma's Chocolate Chip Cookies. I don't know what I'm going to do with these.<br /><br />Props to Amazon Prime. These terrible cookies were packaged well and arrived in one day.<br /><br />  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017ZDL94">Grandma's Chocolate Chip Cookies - 33 Pks - Total 66 Cookies</a><br /><br />I ended up giving these to my son. He said they are better than Chips Ahoy Chocolate Chip Cookies. Not a ringing endorsement since they too are dry and crumbly but it made me think I may have been a little to hard on this product. Thus the change from a two star to a three star review.

review/summary: Color was not "Ruby Red"
review/text: The product was okay but the color was very different than advertised.  It was a darker pink, not red at all.<br /><br />I tried to use it a couple different ways, and as a relative beginner, I did not find the product easy to use.<br /><br />I tried mixing in with a little vanilla extract in order to "paint" it on (I had read this was the best way to do it).  I found that the painting was very streaked and not very consistent.  Maybe someone more experienced will be able to use it more effectively.  In the end, because the red color was important for the cake, I mixed it with red food coloring instead of vanilla extract.  the pearl dust used this way had just a little impact on the color, not a great deal.<br /><br />In the end, I would have experimented more on the best way to use it if the color had been more red.  But as was, I didn't find it super useful and will be unlikely to purchase again.  I hope that other people have a better experience as I very much like the idea of the product.

review/summary: typhoo review
review/text: The only problem with this product is that it is not available in the regular stores which means that you have to search for it.  In a world of teas, you can find a lot of tea that is "black" but if you really read the box you will find that they have added something to the tea that changes the taste.  If you are like me and love a good harty black tea, you can not beat Typhoo.  I was introduced to it in the late 1950s and have continue using it to this day.  When I visit someone that doesn't have it, I usually bring it along with me as I honestly haven't found anything that is equal to it.

review/summary: my favourite tea
review/text: I agree with the other reviewer, except that I think it's *three times* as good as Lipton.  I also prefer it to PG Tips, another English tea.<br /><br />This bag is a quick brewer so you want to do a few dips, even in a nice big jumbo china cup like I have, and then remove the bag.  I grew up with the notion that one never re-used a teabag, and given the weak, cheap ones we used, I can see why; but sometimes I'll put two recently used bags in a fresh cup and they do give an acceptable flavour.<br /><br />Highly recommend Typhoo -- it's worth the higher price.

review/text: I am not a sophisticated tea drinker. I have been experimenting and searching for the perfect tea for me.  I have tried Barry's, PG Tips, standard American bags, and Yorkshire Gold. I might have really liked the Typhoo if I had not tried Yorkshire Gold at the same time. The Typhoo is similar to PG Tips, a fairly weak tea. It's good, but not great. To me, the Yorkshire Gold is superior. But, if you prefer a lighter tea, Typhoo might be perfect for you.

review/text: Other people's comments led me to purchase this product, and they were not wrong. Typhoo's flavor is very good, but on the strong side. Robust, perhaps? As I said, this is no Lipton's. My teapot holds about a quart of water and I filled it nearly to the top to get the right strength for myself, but I like tea on the weak side. I can see why the British often add milk to their tea. To my surprise I also found that Typhoo makes an excellent iced tea

With only 90 calories and 9 grams of protein, it's enough fuel to get me through my workouts without making me feel full. One of the reasons I first tried Mix 1 was that their products are 99% lactose free and gluten free which would eliminate any digestion issues during training. The flavor is surprisingly good for a lean shake. I also feel confident in giving my active kids Mix 1 shakes as well. They give all the flavors a big thumbs up!

review/summary: good food to begin your kittens life
review/text: I have been fostering kittens for a few years now and I think that this is a great food to start out on if you have a tighter budget. I really like the holistic foods, but I think that starting out with this is not too bad. It's not as great for you kitten, but it provides all their necessities and it's not too bad of a brand. All the shelters that I have been to also use this food. I just wanted to note that the higher quality food that you feed your kitten, the less waste they will produce and the general health will increase (shinier coat and etc). I always get this is the big bag because it seems to be the most worth it and this food is not too bad when you can get it on sale. You can also buy these from your local petsmarts so I think it is pretty convenient. Remember to get your pets spayed and neutered as well!! prevent the over accumulation of strays in our shelters and stop overpopulation!!!

review/text: I have two kittens both male persians.  I've been trying different brand kitten foods, including fresh, canned, and dry.  Of all the dried types I have purchased, they like this brand and the Purina One Healthy Kitten Formula.  Each piece of food is small and bite sized for my kitten's little mouths.  Each of my kittens are less than a year old. I like how Hill's uses a portion of the price I paid for this food and donates it through their Shelter Nutrition Partnership.  I'm willing to pay a little more money for the kitten food knowing that a portion is donated to help animals have a more balanced nutrition.  I will purchase this brand again.

review/summary: My kitten loves it - and so does his "big brother"!
review/text: Several weeks ago, I adopted a new kitten, about 6 months old. I figured he would need some food of his own, so I chose Science Diet Indoor kitten food, since he will be an indoor cat. While my two cats were in the "separation" state, I fed the Science Diet to the kitten, and he ate it readily.<br /><br />Then, after I "integrated" the two cats, I had a problem; the older cat decided he liked the kitten food better than his own food. So he wouldn't eat his own food, just the kitten food. I didn't want him eating a lot of kitten food, because it is high in fat and calories, and he is already overweight. But I also wanted my kitten to get some benefit from the kitten food. I tried structured feedings, but it was no use - the older cat would rather go on a hunger strike than eat anything but the kitten food. Boy, it must taste good!<br /><br />I finally ended up mixing the adult food with the kitten food and giving it to both cats. I wish I could feed the kitten the Science Diet exclusively, but oh well, at least he is getting some of it... without my older cat getting a huge amount.

review/summary: A mug of tea
review/text: I purchased this on my most recent trip to Disneyland (March 2012). I'd never used a press before, and thought the cutwork pattern on the base was cute. I've enjoyed 3 mugs of tea made with this, so far, using 2 teaspoons per mug (and plenty of sugar and milk). The scent of the brewing tea is wonderful, and my kitchen smells so delightful for several hours afterwards. It's a fruity/flowery scent, and quite soothing. Yes, the carafe is small - it only holds enough for one large mug (I think it's about 12 oz, but I'm not positive - it's the same size mug I use for my morning coffee), but it's quite enough for my afternoon cuppa. I'm going to have my husband pick up a tin of the Mad Tea Party blend on his next trip to the Magic Kingdom this week, for me to keep it onhand. The carafe itself is top-rack dishwasher safe (and has proven to be so), while the plunger and screen are hand-wash only. The base just needs a wipe and it's otherwise good to go.

It is a lot more convenient than dragging out the coffee pot.  However, it is just the right size for a regular tea cup, maybe two if they are small.  Now if I can only find a replacement screen!

review/text: The teas of 8FoldTea have noticeably improved the quality of my life, from my cup of Jin Xuan in the morning, to shared pots with my colleagues during the work day.<br /><br />In 1989 I had some Cold Mountain oolong in a tea house in Taiwan. What followed was tea frustration for over 20 years. Though I do love brews like masala chai and Tibetan buttered tea, I had been unable to find a truly satisfying oolong until Joseph introduced me to his teas. And now there is no turning back.<br /><br />Fresh and full of life force, these teas continue to bring me joy --  as well as gratitude that I am able to have copious amounts shipped to my home. This jin xuan is simply amazing.

review/summary: Amazing tea
review/text: This is one of those teas that long after, and I mean like a few hours, you still have the taste/aroma in nose and mouth.  For quite a few years now I have been drinking Jin Xuan from this small tea distributor, as well their Li Shan and Ali Shan which are also excellent, but I seemingly always return to the Jin Xuan, or milky oolong. I could not more highly recommend, especially given the reasonable price.  You won't t find this quality of tea at this price unless you walk to the high mountains of China or Taiwan yourself!

review/text: I have tried this tea several times, as well as others from this supplier, and found it rich delicious and creamy. The fragrance isn't like ordinary teas, but full and rich in a way that was completely new to me. Great stuff!

review/summary: The coffee served in Heaven
review/text: Once you have this coffee...you can NEVER go back to "American" coffee.  Starbucks and Caribou are CRAP compared to Illy!  My husband and I are so addicted.  You will be hard pressed to find a better coffee.

review/text: Good price for quantity! I drank this coffee all the time in Italy, this price is much better than the company's prices! If you like Italian espresso, then this is the coffee to buy!

review/summary: Very Good
review/text: I decided to try a couple of brands of pre-ground espresso beans since my grinder at home doesn't get the grind fine enough and the price of the pods makes for pricy drinks, especially if you like double shots. This coffee is very good and the can lasts a while, so it's a better deal for me than the illy individual pods. It can be messier than the pods and takes longer to measure out though. Make sure you have a tamper.<br /><br />I recommend the dark roast if you are making lattes or just like your espresso strong!
