review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: Sickening filler ingredients, high price
review/text: I think the ingredients in this food speak for themselves - cheap filler & byproducts supplemented with vitamins.  After doing a tiny amount of research on cat nutrition I was absolutely disgusted with myself for feeding this food to my cat for over 3 years.  I am also disgusted that so many veterinarians have apparently been bought off by the Hill's company.<br /><br />This Science Diet formula's first 8 ingredients:<br />1 - Brewers rice: Filler. Processed rice product that is missing many of the nutrients contained in whole ground rice. (Cat's don't need grain, and this is the first ingredient!)<br />2 - Chicken By Product Meal: Parts of chicken not fit for human consumption, i.e. head, feet, bones, entrails, blood, intestines, etc.<br />3 - Corn Gluten Meal: Corn byproduct used as an inexpensive protein source.  Many cats and dogs are allergic to corn and, again, cats are carnivores and do not need grain.<br />4 - Powdered Cellulose:  Sawdust!<br />5 - Ground Whole Grain Corn:  More cheap, HYPER allergenic grain that cats don't need.<br />6 - Chicken Liver Flavor:  Self explanatory, but why not just use real chicken liver?<br />7 - Animal Fat: Fat from an unnamed animal source, most likely fat from many types of animals that the Hills company would rather not name.<br />8 - Soybean Mill Run: Soybean hulls - a cheap, byproduct filler.  Soy is also highly allergenic.<br /><br />The funny thing - anyone who buys Science Diet knows it's pretty expensive food.  Yet we can all reasonably presume that these fillers and byproducts probably aren't that expensive to source.  What's worse is that this food can cause serious health problems like diabetes due to the ridiculously high amount of carbohydrates (aka sugars).  The guaranteed analysis on the Hill's website indicates this food is composed of 43.2% carbohydrates.  That's completely inappropriate for the nutritional needs of cats.<br /><br />I was lucky to "see the light" before my cat developed any serious health problems from this food.  My cats symptoms on Science Diet were fairly mild, but still concerning - she got fatter and fatter, she was inactive, her coat was dull, and she pooped a lot.  The first food I switched her to was Taste of the Wild Rocky Mountain Formula, which is a grain-free, high protein diet that costs about half the price of Science Diet.  The first 8 ingredients of Taste of the Wild are chicken meal, peas, sweet potatoes, chicken fat, pea protein, potato protein, roasted venison, smoked salmon.  Obvious improvement over Science Diet's ingredients.  My cat loved it, started losing weight, more activity, coat became shiner, and there were litter box benefits as well (less poo because she was no longer eating filler that her body couldn't process).  I absolutely feel Taste of the Wild is an amazing value for grain-free cat food and a vastly superior product compared to Science Diet and most other commercial cat foods.<br /><br />A few months ago I found Orijen cat food and decided to switch again.  The first 8 ingredients of Orijen are fresh boneless chicken, chicken meal, fresh boneless salmon, turkey meal, fresh chicken liver, herring meal, russet potato, chicken fat.  Now doesn't the Orijen ingredient list make the Science Diet ingredients above even more laughable and sad?  After feeding Orijen and a bit of high-quality canned food every day (Tiki Cat or Nature's Variety Instict), my 4 year old cat has practically become a kitten again.  She plays every day and is the picture of lean, bright-eyed, happy feline health.  Changing my cat's diet from Science Diet to a diet appropriate for felines has completely transformed my cat in less than 6 months!<br /><br />There is so much information about feline health out there and so many holistic foods to choose from now.  I strongly believe that anyone who currently feeds Science Diet would feel immediately compelled to switch foods after doing 20-30 minutes of research.  Please do.

review/summary: Science Diet = terrible for cats, it's addictive
review/text: My kitten--now a hefty 11 pound slug--went through the same antics as the 1-star review written about Bean.<br /><br />I couldn't figure out why our Tiki was always hungry.  Why she got fat and lazy and was always panting, but never too satiated to turn up her nose at Science Diet.  She was always begging for it, every 4 hours.  And her litter-box smells, and the size of the poos--I swear, they were human-size!  I thought okay, she's a growing kitten, she must know more than I do about her nutritional needs, so I kept filling the bowl.  But she got so huge so fast that I knew something was wrong.<br /><br />So I did my research and learned all about sub-standard pet food, and what cats really need. It's not Science Diet, that's for sure!  Yet our local pound where I adopted Tiki insisted on keeping her on Science Diet, because "it's good for the cats and they love it". Hmmm.<br /><br />I began weaning our Tiki off Science Diet about 2 months ago.  It has been a long and tortuous change for both of us.  I have to put up with pitiful meowing all hours of the night.  Unfortunately I have to keep a small bag of Science Diet in the pantry (long story short: our other emaciated cat Tonga needs to have a small amount of Science Diet mixed in with her good Evo food to "fatten her up" with empty calories).<br /><br />You should see Tiki when she comes anywhere near the Science Diet bag of food.  She goes nuts, literally.  She yanks at the bag, tries to rip it open, drags it around the house in her teeth...one time she even bit through some plastic water bottles to try to get behind them and attack the Science Diet.<br /><br />When we began this process 2 months ago I switched to Innova Evo (timed feeding) along with various expensive wet foods, freely fed.  Evo is great for the cats (though Tonga, already a sleek looking cheetah-wannabee) lost weight on it; hence, the need to augment her food with fattening, empty-cal Science Diet.  On strictly Evo and wet food  our Tiki, too, has lost weight, but it has been gradual, as I can't do it too fast, because she is still a growing kitten at 10 months.<br /><br />Sorry for the jumble of writing, but you get the point: NO to Science Diet.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: Just started using this so will update more later, I have an older cat 15 years old, everything she ate she would throw up she pretty much grew up on Iam's Weight Control cat food due to a previous urinary tract infection,and a weight problem (vet recommended) she weighed in at 17 lbs her heaviest the Iams never helped for years for weight control.Later in life she started losing the weight got down to a perfect weight then really started to lose to much then the last bag of Iams I bought her she refused to eat but a couple of kibbles a day, she was starving herself to death because even then she was throwing up,(she went down to 7lbs) I bought the Science Diet Sensitive stomach she is finally eating again, not throwing up so the food is A-OK with me and will spend the price for it, but like I said just starting using it will update on how she does more in to eating the food. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is the price and since I ordered this food online maybe finding the product in the stores around here I live very rural so getting to a store is a chore in itself at times.

review/summary: Nothing else works
review/text: I understand all the complaints about Science Diet. Believe me I avoided this food for quite awhile based on that information. I'm not thrilled about the filler, would prefer a food with no by-products, and yes in general think it is over priced. But my cat was throwing up everything else. And I do mean EVERYTHING else. I have tried so many top of the line foods for him and every single one he threw up. I took him to the vet, had all the xrays done, all the blood work done, put him on antibotics just in case... nothing. He is a perfectly healthy cat except that he was throwing up food 2 to 3 times a week. I talked to my mom who had 2 Siamese cats that lived into thier late teens and she said she fed them Science Diet. In fact, one of them had urninary tract problems and the SD was the only food that stopped his problems. So yes, I understand everything everyone is saying about why SD is so horrible... yet I can't argue with the results. I fed my cat this and it's been 3 weeks with no vomiting. My mom fed it to her cats and they lived long, healthy lives. I just can't argue with the results. And even if there were risks it's worth it not to have my poor kitty completely emptying his stomach 2-3 times a week from food that is making him sick. If your cat keeps throwing up, you've had the vet check him and there is nothing wrong and no other food is working... try this food. It really did work for my cat.

review/summary: My cat loves this cat food
review/text: My cat loves this cat food so much that we feed it to her as treats. She has a tendency to get underweight so we feed it to her pretty much on demand (which is frequently). I'd recomend it for fussy cats with tooth tartar problems (the chucks are larger than normal cat food and presumably help to clean their teeth when they crunch it). I usually buy the larger size for economy's sake, but this would be a better size to try out on your cat.

review/summary: Great product, but trust your vet not the hype
review/text: I have two cats, one 6 and one 2 years old. Both are indoor cats in excellent health. I saw the negative review and talked to my vet about it. I've also asked a number of veterinary professionals what to feed my cats and they all answer the same thing: Science Diet. Sure, you'll see stories of how one person's cat had issues, but even if that's 100% true, it's 1 case out of millions. Science and fact aren't based on someone's experience.<br /><br />So my point is, I love my cats and I'm very concerned about their health. I trust people who actually have medical degrees and experience with a wide range of animals. My only caution is do not fall for some hype or scare tactic that recommends some unproven or untested food or some fad diet for your pet. Don't listen to me, don't listen to the negative review. ASK YOUR VET what they recommend, and follow their instructions. My guess is you'll end up buying the Science Diet anyhow.

review/text: I have two cats, one 6 and one 2 years old. Both are indoor cats in excellent health. I saw the negative review and talked to my vet about it. I've also asked a number of veterinary professionals what to feed my cats and they all answer the same thing: Science Diet. Sure, you'll see stories of how one person's cat had issues, but even if that's 100% true, it's 1 case out of millions. Science and fact aren't based on someone's experience.<br /><br />So my point is, I love my cats and I'm very concerned about their health. I trust people who actually have medical degrees and experience with a wide range of animals. My only caution is do not fall for some hype or scare tactic that recommends some unproven or untested food or some fad diet for your pet. Don't listen to me, don't listen to the negative review. ASK YOUR VET what they recommend, and follow their instructions. My guess is you'll end up buying the Science Diet anyhow.

review/text: Cats are carnivores.<br /><br />Science Diet has no meat.<br /><br />Instead, you get cheap corn filler, spent rice leftover from brewing beer, and meatless chicken parts that humans don't eat, like beaks.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: Obese/overweight cat? Do your research!
review/text: This is a really good choice for a nutritionally sound, lower calorie food, and our cat (admittedly not picky) immediately devoured it. But the real message here is: you need to find out how many kcal/day your cat needs for weight loss, research the calories in your cat's food, and accurately measure your feeding. There do not appear to be industry standards for what's labeled as 'weight management', 'light' etc., and the differences are dramatic!<br /><br />Our very young and energetic cat starting piling on weight from when he was a kitten. Maybe he stuffs himself because he's a 'rescue'--I don't know whether he might have had some starvation in his early weeks that marked him for life! but we had to put him on adult food before his kitten year was up, on the advice of our veterinarian--and he went on to gain weight up to almost 20 lb. even when giving the recommended daily amount of food, measured, divided into 2 daily feedings.<br /><br />We decided to switch from a Purina Pro Plan regular adult formula to their 'weight management' formula--still, kitty was gaining. When I finally did the research of how many kcal/day he should be getting and how many kcal we were giving him (mind you--the recommended, measured amount), I was shocked. The packaging recommends 56-84 g./day of the food for weight loss, for a cat with a goal weight of 10-14 lbs. That's 214-321 calories, measured by their own nutrition information. But my research at [...] showed that the recommended amount should be 187 calories/day for weight loss, for a goal weight of 10-12 lb. That means the *minimum* amount recommended by the Purina label was 27 more calories/day than he should be getting--or 14% more! and the maximum 'recommended' amount was 72% more than he should be getting for weight loss.<br /><br />[...] has a publication with calorie counts/cup of a wide variety of cat food: [...]<br />The range of calories/up is staggering. Anyone with an overweight cat--do your cat a favor and research how many calories/day they *should* be getting, and how many calories the 'recommended' amount that you're feeding actually is.<br /><br />After finding out how much of the Pro Plan Weight Management per day to offer, I thought our problems were over--I started giving him a daily amount with the right calories for weight loss. And he did start losing, at a slow but safe rate: about .2 lb/week. But he was constantly, frantically hungry. I looked further, for a nutritionally sound food that could give him more volume and fill him up while still not exceeding the calories he would need for weight loss. With the help of [...] for nutritional ratings, and the calorie chart on [...], I selected Science Diet Light--with approximately 75% of the calories per cup compared to the Purina Pro Plan. I can now give him 9g/day more, and I think the higher fiber content of this food will help him feel more full. While it does cost more than his previous food, the difference is not going to break the bank--I estimate it will cost me $4 more per month.

review/summary: The only food I give my cats!
review/text: My cats have been on Hill's Science Diet since they came home as kittens. This food is great and keeps them very healthy, it's what the vet has always recommended and I've stuck with for my cats. I get the big bag because it's easier to store it in a large air-tight container near their food and not have to worry about buying food every other week or so. So glad to see this on Amazon Prime now, I used to have to go out of my way to speciality pet stores just to get it as places like PetCo out here don't always carry it.

review/summary: Works Great With My Cat
review/text: I've had several cats, most of which didn't have much of a hairball problem.  However, the cat I have now, has hocked up some epic hairballs. She's the best cat I've ever had, except for this one nasty problem.<br /><br />So, I bought a small bag of this hairball control from my vet, tried it, and it does seem to have had an effect on my cat's massive hairball problem.  In fact, after about a month of mixing this with her other food, I've noticed that she's only thrown up once or twice, and that's certainly not as much as she did before.<br /><br />I found this bag on Amazon for quite a bit less than what my vet charged, so I'll continue to order it here. Based on what I've observed with my cat so far, I would highly recommend this for those of you who have cats with the same problem.

review/summary: Great cat food, great value
review/text: I adopted my cat from a shelter and this is the type of food they fed him and urged me to continue feeding him. He absolutely loves it and I won't be changing brands or food anytime soon. It seems to be a very high quality dry cat food and it's definitely one that my cat loves. The big bag of food is great especially if you have large Rubbermaid (etc) containers to store it in so it doesn't get stale. I'm very happy with this food and I'm very glad the shelter (and my vet) ended up recommending it. My cat is happy and I'm happy knowing he is being fed appropriately with high quality food that is helping him stay healthy.

review/summary: Thank God I found this food!
review/text: We have 2 cats, one of which started having stomach issues about a month after she traveled eight hours and moved into our house. We thought it might be the stress of the drive, the change to a new habitat and a new cat friend. She was throwing up frequently and also having issues on the other end - I won't get into the gross details. A trip to the vet got her some antibiotics that helped for a short time, but she was back to being miserable, and obviously uncomfortable with using her litter box, not two weeks after seeing the vet. Since we found this food and transitioned her on to it, she hasn't thrown up. Her other issues have cleared up too and she is feeling healthy and happy again. So I'll say it again: thank goodness for this food!!!

review/summary: Best for Dental Health
review/text: The vet showed me that my 14-year-old cat's teeth and gums were in bad shape. Her teeth were stained and layered with plaque. Her guns were bright red along the edges. She had Gingivitis. I was facing a $300+ teeth cleaning bill for the cat. The vet recommended I try Hill's Dental Diet first. After two months of eating it, the cat returned to the vet. The large, hard nuggets had cleaned the plaque from her teeth. Her gums were no longer red, but pink and healthy. Hill's did what was needed. I am thrilled with the results.<br /><br />Yes, this food is expensive, but so is a teeth cleaning bill for a cat, as well as dental problems if you don't. Once my cat's mouth improved, I cut back on the Hill's. I feed my cat a main diet of Purina dry, but I still give her 8-10 Hill's nuggets a day. She's been on this mixed diet for one year and her teeth and gums are still good and healthy. The Hill's large nuggets act like a tooth brush that scrapes against the cat's teeth.<br /><br />Pound per pound this cat food is actually less expensive than those little bags of tarter control cat treats you buy in the supermarket. Once you get control over your cat's dental problems you can maintain her by giving her several Hill's Dental Diet nuggets a day. If your cat has no problems yet, consider giving her a small handful of Hill's Dental nuggets to ward off any future problems. This stuff works!

review/text: Have been using this cat food now for a few years after the vet recommended dental cleaning (very expensive & put them under anesthesia - no way!).  Our cat is healthy and her teeth seem to be in good condition.  She loves the taste and size.  She won't eat any small food anymore (I have tried some samples) and actually eats all the Science Diet and leaves the small ones for me to discard.  It's a bit pricey but I would recommend it.

review/summary: Way more expensive per pound than the larger-sized bags of the same food
review/text: I posted my review for the quality of this cat food here: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MWBFXY">Hill's Science Diet Adult Sensitive Stomach Dry Cat Food - 15.5-Pound Bag</a>, which is the same food as this but in a larger bag.  Here, I just wanted to point out that this smaller size bag is actually much more expensive.  As of the date I'm writing this, this 3.5-pound bag costs $3.71 per pound, whereas the 7-pound bag costs $3.50 per pound and the 15.5-pound bag costs $2.32 per pound.  So you pay over 50% more per pound for this size compared with the largest size.  Just wanted to point this out in case it could save anyone money!  I like the cat food a lot.

review/summary: Has mostly cleared up our vomiting problem
review/text: My 5-year-old kitty has always eaten Science Diet (first the kitten formula, then the Adult Indoor formula), and has always been very healthy with a gorgeous coat and lots of energy.  A couple of years ago she started vomiting after meals about once a week.  The vet said there was nothing wrong and she was probably just eating too fast.  We immediately switched over to this Sensitive Stomach version and the vomiting frequency decreased dramatically.  Now she vomits only once every two or three months.  I'm skeptical that there is anything really different about this food, and it could have just been a coincidence that she stopped vomiting after we switched.  Still, I'd rather just stick with this kind than find out.  I took away one star because it is, in my opinion, unreasonably expensive.

review/summary: The only thing that worked
review/text: I understand all the complaints about Science Diet. Believe me I avoided this food for quite awhile based on that information. I'm not thrilled about the filler, would prefer a food with no by-products, and yes in general think it is over priced. But my cat was throwing up everything else. And I do mean EVERYTHING else. I have tried so many top of the line foods for him and every single one he threw up. I took him to the vet, had all the xrays done, all the blood work done, put him on antibotics just in case... nothing. He is a perfectly healthy cat except that he was throwing up food 2 to 3 times a week. I talked to my mom who had 2 Siamese cats that lived into thier late teens and she said she fed them Science Diet. In fact, one of them had urninary tract problems and the SD was the only food that stopped his problems. So yes, I understand everything everyone is saying about why SD is so horrible... yet I can't argue with the results. I fed my cat this and it's been 3 weeks with no vomiting. My mom fed it to her cats and they lived long, healthy lives. I just can't argue with the results. And even if there were risks it's worth it not to have my poor kitty completely emptying his stomach 2-3 times a week from food that is making him sick. If your cat keeps throwing up, you've had the vet check him and there is nothing wrong and no other food is working... try this food. It really did work for my cat.

The other always vomits ten minutes after eating, no matter what she eats: canned or dried makes no difference and I've tried every store brand there is.  Hairball treatments had no effect.  I figured "cats throw up" and didn't worry about it.  When I moved and switched vets the new vet asked if the cats ever threw up.  When she heard about the one cat she said cats do NOT just throw up and told me to get the Science Diet sensitive stomach food.  Yes, it's 4x the price of what I'd been buying, but I noticed a difference with the first bowl.  Instead of throwing up ten minutes after literally every meal, now she throws up maybe once a month.  If only I'd switched to this brand years ago we both would have been saved a lot of misery.  Even tho it costs more I've noticed that the bag seems to last longer than the same amount of cat chow did.

review/summary: My cats like this!
review/text: Since Frisky no longer makes those great little round balls of Dental Diet cat food, I had to go looking for something else. Science Diet seemed to be the only likley alternative. My cats liked the different size and texture of the round balls but in their infinite wisdom Frisky (the nitwits) decided there wasn't a market for the product any longer. Fat lot they know. Our three cats don't love this "dental diet cat food" as much at the round balls but they do eat it along with their other food. I buy only grain free Orijen and another dry cat food intended for indoor cats. Our cats enjoy the variety and it does seem to work. The Science Diet has an almost greasy coating on the surface but this seems to draw our cats to it. The size and shape forces them to chew it and this is good for their teeth. We have one cat that loves to swallow his cat food without chewing. How he does it when it's dry, I don't know! I believe that the larger size alone means healthier teeth and gums for our cats. Two of our cats (9 yrs old) are of a breed that is known to suffer from gum diease. They have healthy gums. I believe that a dental diet cat food helps to prevent gum disease....and the larger size provides variety to their diet that they enjoy. Not everything a cat eats has to be 100% certified good for them. Can you imagine if we always ate only healthy food! Boring! If you provide a good quality dry cat food, plenty of water (we use a fountain), routine exercise (play with them!) and a canned cat food as a treat now and then....you will have healthy and happy cats.

review/summary: Buyer Beware - Potential Choking Hazard
review/text: I believe that people need to be aware of the fact that the kibble size of the Adult Oral Care Dry Cat Food is VERY large and presents a potential choking hazard to their pets.  I transitioned my cat to this food from the Science Diet kitten formula when he was about 15 months old.  From day one, I thought that the kibble size was abnormally large for cat food.  I've had cats for over twenty years, and have used many different cat food formulas.  Never have I seen one with kibble this large.  It is close to marble sized.  It was so large that my cat would take one piece out of his bowl at a time to eat it.<br /><br />Even though I was concerned, I was naive enough to think that Hill's would not manufacture a food that could in any way harm a person's pet as Science Diet is highly recommended by many vets.  I was terribly wrong.  About a month after transitioning to this formula, I watched in horror as my beautiful little oriental shorthair stood choking after a piece of kibble got stuck in his mouth.  For anyone who has ever witnessed this, it is a horrible sight.  The poor little cat will pant and paw at the side of their face - as if they want to reach their paw into their mouth, but can't.  I was extremely fortunate - as my boy was finally able to expel the piece of kibble from his mouth, which of course came out whole. I immediately threw the remainder of the food in the trash can.  As painful as it was to watch, I considered it a warning.  Had I not been home to witness the scene, it could have easily happened again with far more dire consequences.<br /><br />I subsequently wrote to Hill's about my concern that this food presented a choking risk and received the most ridiculous and uncaring response that you can possibly imagine.  First they felt compelled to tell me that this particular formula was designed to maintain oral care and that they had a different formula for adult cats.  This was completely insulting as I was very much aware of that fact and had intentionally purchased the food for the stated oral care benefits.  In addition, the fact that they have other formulas has nothing to do with the concern I have with this particular formula.  Next they asked if I "transitioned" my cat to the new food, in what I can only interpret as a lame attempt at trying to make me feel as if I was somehow responsible for the situation.  Short of putting the food into a blender, there would be no other appropriate way of "transitioning" one's pet to avoid the risk of choking on this product.<br /><br />I don't for one minute believe that my cat's experience was an isolated occurence.  If you are thinking about buying this product, please, please, please be aware of the risk as it is VERY real.

review/text: Please do your research on pet foods and what is actually good for your cats.  Hills science diet is a horrible food filled with horrible ingredients.  They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food.  This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school.  Then they sell the cat food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness.  Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat. try something like orijen or evo.

review/summary: Excellent for good health of cat
review/text: After a year on kitten food, one of my two cats began to get rather chubby.  He had a hard time hauling himself up onto one of the cat perches in the house.  We switched to this food when they hit their one-year birthday, and my little chubby cat began to lose weight.  Now, a year later, the indoor cat formula is all they eat, and my cat can jump up to the top bunk of the cat perch with no problems at all.  He has an all-star physique.  I do have to say, they preferred the kitten food too at first, but when given no other options, they eat this food with no problems.  If you look at the nutritional content of the food, indoor cat formula has very little fat, while kitten food is quite high in it.  Oh, and I've also seen *maybe* one hairball in the last year.  Not bad.

review/text: Science Diet has always been known for decent quality food to feed your cat or dog.  This product is no different.  I have a finicky cat who will only eat certain types of dry food and this seems to be one of them.  She took right to the dry without any hesitation and seems to continue to enjoy it.<br /><br />On the downside is the size of the food.  The food comes in large triangular shaped pieces that some cats may not like.  Buy a small bag and try it for your pet.<br /><br />4/5 stars for the size of the food and the price tag.

review/summary: Saved my Cat
review/text: This product was recommended by my vet, and literally saved my cat's life. I was very worried and was willing to try any diet on the market. Really, I have tried many diets etc but nothing seemed to help out my cat after the sudden onset of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).  I have no idea of where that came from. I always gave him clean water; fresh food etc but this caught me off guard. I have been feeding him "Friskies" prior to Hill's and everything was fine until one weekend. After a couple of days of feeding him, I noticed an immediate difference. My cat was no longer passing soft stools (diarrhea), and was eating as he normally did. The diet also seems to have been helping him regulate his weight also. He was a very big guy (~20 lbs) but now he is down to 16, after about 4 months on Hill's. Thumbs up and 5 stars for this product!

review/text: Ok cats, you can stop wiggling and showing me your lovely bellies, and get up and play.<br /><br />Let's get down to the nitty gritty. Hill's Science Diet Adult Hairball Control Dry Cat Food does what it says it does and MORE!!!<br /><br />Now, I DO feed my cats wet food, so I give them Hill's Science Diet Adult Hairball Control Dry Cat Food as a TREAT and a SUPPLEMENT -- and it is powerful stuff!! To be graphic, let's just say that Big Bad Baby Twinkle's poops used to look like small rocks, no matter what I did for her food (and she loves her daily hairball gel too) -- but NOW after feeding her even a small amount of Hill's Science Diet Adult Hairball Control Dry Cat Food (twice a day after she eats her wet food) one look at her litterbox and I think that a German Shepherd has visited the litterbox. To say that this makes me happy may sound wierd but now I KNOW that "stuff" is moving THROUGH her intestines and not getting impacted or staying inside and creating toxins.<br /><br />The same for Cee Cee kitty -- she, who is daaainty and small (BBBT weighs twice as much as Cee Cee and is twice as long as Cee Cee), also pops out some big ones now. I am happy -- yes I am -- this means their intestinal transit time (from eating to pooping) is shorter and they are healthier for it.

I have 3 cats, two Maine Coons who get hairballs, and this stuff really works to prevent that. As long as they eat some of it daily no more hairballs on the floor. It's a great product. I hope they never try to "improve" the recipe or change it in any way, or my cats will probably reject it as they have so many others! If it ain't broke please don't fix it, Science Diet! It's a winner as is.

review/summary: Bought this for the Fiber
review/text: Was feeding my 3 cats - Blue Buffalo Blue Wilderness Chicken Dry Cat Food - which is one of the best brands out there... No grain, all meat, blah blah.  Cats loved it over all the other 'meat only' brands...<br /><br />Only problem was... soft stools...  Talked to the vet and she said that sometimes cats need some form of fiber, even if it isn't nutritious, it helps to bulk up the stools and get rid of the God awful odor...<br /><br />So went up and down the food aisle and this particular brand/version had the highest fiber content of all of the bags of food.  The BWC food has 3.5% fiber... This indoor cat food has 10% fiber... yes it is indigestible corn... that's the whole idea... a form of roughage to helps the bowels.  This food also has added fiber on top of the corn stuff etc...<br /><br />So I'm going to see if this helps with the soft very stinky stools... if it does, I'm sticking with it.<br /><br />So far the cats haven't seemed to mind the larger kibble size.  They chomp a piece in half, and eat both halves...

review/summary: My kitty LOVES it.
review/text: The story goes that I adopted a cat from an agency last summer. Having always grown up with dogs and not cats, I went ahead and wandered down to my Target to get a bag of Friskies. About a week later, my kitty (named Sugar) starting vomiting. Confused, I assumed it was the wet food we were feeding her in the morning. So we changed it. Then we changed it again. No results. I took her to the vet and asked. He checked her out and said likely the problem was having a sensitive stomach and he recommended Science Diet. Bam. My cat does great now. She's lost a little bit of weight so she's the right size now. She doesn't vomit anymore. This food works and it works well. I read the negative review here and I would say the problem was unique to the cat. My cat loves it and is doing brilliantly now.

review/summary: The worst snap-lock reseal ever made?
review/text: I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.<br /><br />I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.<br /><br />I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.<br /><br />Theo.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/text: I have two cats and have always been feeding them this food,one is 5 and the other 9 years old and they are both 15 pounds.So they are fat and I could never figure out why,since they only got to share on cup between each other all day.So about two weeks ago I did some research on this food and my eyes were opened.I feel horrible that I fed them this junk food and I thought I was giving them the Best out there,since my Vet gave it to me and said it was great for them.<br />So anyways my male cat is now on Wellness Indoor dry and expensive wet food like Blue Buffalo,Wellness and Merrick.He loves it and I had no problem switching him over and I already notice the difference in his energy level.But my biggest issue is my female cat,she will not touch any other food than her Science junk food.I tried mixing it with the new food,starting at 75% old to 25% new,nothing she wouldn't touch it.So I tried 90% to 10%,still nothing.She cried and wined and didn't eat one morsel in four days and was just laying in one spot all day having even less energy than before.So I called my new Vet and she said now it is getting dangerous because she wouldn't eat at all.I had to give her her old junk food back,because I did not want her to die.I have no idea what to do,she is so addicted to this food and I can't get her of it.She hates wet food with a passion.I am worried about Diabetes if she will get any bigger.So I am really sad that nothing seems to work with her.<br />I made her a junk food addict,it's my fault.I wish I never started her on this food at all.

SAWDUST is not what I want to feed my cat, even to help her lose weight.<br /><br />No wonder this food feels so "light" physically.  The color is lighter, and it is less dense than normal food because it's truly just fillers.<br /><br />I give it a second extra star because my cat would willingly eat this food and didn't seem to mind a whole lot, but I switched her (50/50 at first) to Blue Buffalo, which has real food ingredients and which she actually does prefer.

review/summary: Toasted Corn and Rice for Cats!
review/text: I was given a sample by my vet and my cats LOVED the stuff. I immediately saw that the amount they ate of this food was much more than their usual grain-free food, they seemed to be starving and feeding all the time. They also became less energized than usual, my cats are Siamese and are constantly running after each other and very active with their toys. They became lethargic and were not as interested in their usual activities. I called my vet and she suggested catnip and not to worry, hmm, never needed catnip before...<br /><br />Well I did worry, and did my research. Online I found that Science Diet's pride and joy is their belief in using corn and other grains, you also need a chemistry major in order to fully understand their ingredient list. Last time I checked my cats were obligate carnivores and was distressed that such a food was suggested, no less by my vet. Further research I found that the reason Science Diet is so recommended by vets is because Science Diet spends quite a bit of money in the major vet schools in the nation. They also give an incredible amount of money and support to many animal hospitals and shelters, for that I commend them much! I will give credit when credit is due, I think is wonderful that they give so much charity. With that said this food is nothing more than kibble, I can see why my cats were so hungry all the time, this food did not provide the energy they required. Going back to grain-fee, the first ingredients in this product are rice and corn.<br /><br />Also the fact that this food is so expensive when is no different that the kibble in supermarket stores is ludicrous!

The vet recommended I switch my cat over to this cat food. I checked it out at the store, but after reading the ingredients I thought this can't be right.  First, its labeled for cats up to 6 years old, second it appears to be jammed will fillers, and third, its rather pricey.  I'm glad I came home and started researching this product and reading about others experiences with this food, and I'm definitely not feeding this stuff to my cat!

review/summary: Wow, I cant believe how expensive a bag of corn is!
review/text: No seriously, this is ridiculous, $45 for a bag of corn for obligate carnivores? brewers rice, corn gluten meal? wheres the meat?<br />Not to mention unnamed animal fat which could be anything including roadkill and euthanized shelter animals. There are much better quality grain free foods that cost less then this.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: Not tastey
review/text: I fed this product to my cat and my roommate's cat.  I was experimenting with food since the cats are almost 1, and I wanted to introduce different kinds of adult food so they'd get used to them.  I mixed half Science Diet dry kitten food with this product, and the cats began to eat less.  I was worried about how much they were eating (nearly 1/4 their original diet) so I filled one bowl with this indoor cat food and one bowl with their kitten food.  They barely touched the indoor cat food, while eating most of their kitten food.  I ended up having to mix some canned cat food in with it to get them to eat.<br /><br />Part of it might be that the food is triangular and much larger than the kitten food.  They had a hard time eating it at first, since they were used to the small pieces of the kitten food.<br /><br />Don't be discouraged, though.  My cat can't tell the difference between the kitten food and the regular adult food.  They really enjoy Science Diet's fish flavored food, so give that a try.

review/summary: BAD, do NOT buy!
review/text: Chicken by-product, corn gluten meal, and whole ground corn?!!  Yeah, I'm NOT feeding my cat that, sorry. Googling "corn gluten meal" shows that it is used as an herbicide according to U.S. Patent # 5,030,268. If you Google "U.S. Patent 5,030,268" you will find out.  By-products are all the nasty parts of the chicken, turkey that humans won't eat: feet, neck, spleen, intestines that have bad effects on health. After all there are reasons why humans don't eat these parts, correct? So why should our pets? A good book that explains about by-products and manufacturing is The New Natural Cat by Anitra Frazier.  Because of these ingredients being in most cat foods, I buy Tractor Supply's 4HEALTH INDOOR dry food. Compare the ingredients in the Science Diet food to 4HEALTH and you will see the differences. 4HEALTH is a much better quality product with no corn, wheat or soy at HALF the price.

He's now got a special seasoning for just about everything and I've yet to run across one that was not tasty in the extreme.<br /><br />Also, you should order a gallon of his hot sauce.  It's the most flavorful hot sauce I have ever tried and it's not so hot that you can't eat what you put on it.<br /><br />If the US Government operated like he does, we might actually have a good news day once in awhile.

review/text: Innova Senior is my 14 year old Cornish Rex cat's favorite kitty food. She has been eating it for about 8 months, and looks better than she has in years. I have been feeding her a variety of premium foods over the years such as Avoderm and Wellness, but the Innova made a noticeable difference. Her coat looks as good as it did when she was a show girl, and the added glucosamine seems to have put an extra bounce in her step.

review/summary: Old cat, no teeth, not-so-smelly poo on this dry food
review/text: I adopted a 12 year old cat who had had all her teeth extracted before I adopted her.  She cannot eat wet food because of diarrhea; dry food has to be wetted down to almost soft so she can gum it.  I had been using Merrick no grain and her litter box smell inundated the apartment within 30 seconds.  I have since found out that the richness of food is what makes the smell so unbearable (and I am an immediate litter box scooper, and I mean immediate!).<br /><br />She likes this food, I have her very slowly losing weight because half a cup is just a little over 200 calories.  I am retired and am home most of the time so I feed her small amounts on demand.  And if she poops in the night, my apartment won't be awful in the morning from the smell.<br /><br />My preference would have been a very low carb but high-quality wet food but her stomach cannot take it.  I tried several quality dry foods before I found this.

There are plenty of the crackers, as they are light not heavy. I ate a whole box in three sittings over a two day period.  One time as an soup accompanyment.<br />The herb taste is not overpowering or unnatural and allows you to go without the need to have some cheese with them, but I am going to have some cheese available the next time I open a box.<br />They are yummy, buy them.

review/summary: Smaller bags now! Bummer.
review/text: I have been drinking Black Cat from my super automatic for years now. I was excited to see it finally being sold on Amazon and eligible for Prime shipping. There were two things that dissapointed me... Intelligenstsia has started selling smaller bags (12 oz) for the same price that they used to sell a 16 oz bag for. I didn't play close enough attention so the savings I thought I was getting (compared to where I usually buy it) was not there. Secondly the roast date on the coffee I got was a couple months old. I am used to being a week old, maybe two worst case. These bags had been setting around for awhile. I am going to stick to getting 16 oz bags from my usual merchant.

review/summary: Best beans for Jura S9: UPDATED
review/text: I'm an espresso nut and have several machines that I call my friends. One of these is a Jura S9 Avantgarde, and after trying dozens and dozens of various beans to find the perfect mate, Intelligentsia Black Cat Classic prevailed as the very clear winner. There may be better beans out there, but not for this machine. I've served thousands of shots of this espresso out of the Jura, and everyone is impressed by it... actually, not just impressed... blown away. It's not uncommon to have neighbors coming in the back door in the morning to grab a shot. This bean produces a perfect espresso... great crema, thick legs... smooth with no bitterness and a slight nut/chocolate finish. The best thing is the consistency... the beans are always the same... which is not true of so many other small producers. It's also great in cappuccini, macchiati, etc.<br /><br />I live very close to Intelligentsia in LA and buy beans there in person... but, my other house is 2 hours away... and when there, I order these beans online through Amazon. These mail order ones are fine... and are very similar to what you get in the store. It is a serious downer that Intelligentsia switched the size from 16oz to 12oz, which essentially upped the price by about 30%... but, it's still much cheaper than Illy or some others.<br /><br />When you buy in the store, the beans have usually been roasted only a few days before. From Amazon, it seems to be about  2 weeks... something like that. To be honest, it really doesn't make much difference... since the beans are whole and sealed, the taste between beans that are a few days from roasting versus 2 weeks is virtually indiscernible. If the beans were 1 day old versus a month or so, there would be a slight difference, but here... there's nothing really worth mentioning... and certainly nothing to prevent me from ordering them. There's lot of hype about this... but...<br /><br />As an aside, I much prefer these Classic beans to the Organic beans. The Classic seem to produce better crema, have less bitterness and less of the bright-forward flavor I try to avoid.<br /><br />UPDATE 7/30/2012: Purchased again from Amazon and the beans were about 2 months old. That's really pushing the limits of acceptability... probably will not order from Amazon again. Changed from 5 stars to 3.

review/text: This is good stuff...just like you would get in a restaurant.<br />Coat the steak (preferably ribeye) with melted butter...then press the steak into a pile of the seasoning, until every speck is coated heavily. Cook the steak in a white hot cast iron pan, until it's rare in the middle, and almost burned on the outside. There you go...wonderful product.

review/summary: AWESOME steak seasoning!!
review/text: I LOVE this stuff for grilling steak!! Pat the steak dry and then lightly spray it with bourbon. Sprinkle the seasoning to your taste - I like lots of seasoning, remember you will lose some while grilling. Flip the steak and do the other side. Let it soak while lighting the grill. Just before grilling, lightly brush the steak with melted butter - be careful to not remove the seasoning! Make sure the grill is REALLY hot! Sear the outside and spray it again with a bit of bourbon. Flip the steak and do the other side. Flavor is similar to the Bourbon Street Steak at Applebees. My opinion is mine is a little better . . . It may take you 2-3 times to get it down pat but it is SO worth it!!!

review/summary: Wonderful MisSteak I made.
review/text: I have used Blackened Redfish seasoning for years, but made the mistake of ordering 2 20Oz containers of the wrong stuff, the Blackened STEAK magic. It was $20 and rather than returning it, I decided to try using it. It is the best steak I have had. I like sirloin better than ribeye because it's leaner. I would suggest following the recipe exactly. I use a Coleman stove out doors with a heavy steel French frying pan. Cast iron would work well too. It will smoke up your house unless you have an industrial hood. I never order steak anymore. It's always better at home. I would also recommend letting the steak come up to near room temperature before blackening it.

review/summary: Chef Paul Prudhomme's Best Seasoning
review/text: I've been experimenting with Cajun food for quite sometime. I've talked with several different Creole Chefs and two of the three that I have spoked with have recommended this seasoning over any other. From now on, this is the only Creole seasoning I use on any meat. I've bought the variety pack of Chef Paul Prudhomme's seasonings, and nothing really stuck out like this one. If you have been using Chef Paul Prudhomme's seasonings, and haven't purchased this one, you are in for a treat. I can't find this specific product in the stores, which makes the 24-oz can a great buy.

review/text: We absolutely love this seasoning. I worked years ago in a restaurant, and this is the seasoning they would put on fish, chicken and beef. It adds a lot of flavor, without adding a lot of fat and calories. We use it for veggies, soups, fish, you name it.<br />We can't seem to keep it in the house, and at approx $5.00 for a small bottle from the market, this large canister is a much better deal. It should last us a good long time.

review/summary: It's amazing, versatile stuff!
review/text: This is my go-to seasoning blend now. I wish I had discovered it sooner! I use it on everything...including fish, chicken, pork, shrimp, burgers, steak, potatoes, veggies, and in dry rubs, marinades, soups and stews. I've even been tempted to top my ice cream with it, but so far have been able to restrain myself! :-) For a blackening seasoning, I find it has a nice all-around blend of seasonings, herbs and spices without being too over-the-top spicy or peppery. Flavor is key here...not "melt your face off" heat.<br /><br />The larger cansiter is a much better bargain than the little 2 ounce containers, in my opinion. Amazon also has the 2-pack 24 ounce cansiters, and it's what I usually order when I'm running low. If you've never tried this stuff before, pick up the 2 ounce size to see how you like it...when you realize how good it is, you'll be glad Amazon has the big cansiters.

review/summary: Excellent Seasoning - Never Disappoints
review/text: Im was never a fan of eating fish but my diet requires it. I dug through my cupboard and found this seasoning my wife had bought last year. I tried it and fell in love with it. I went through the entire bottle in about 2 weeks. However when I tried to get more, it wasnt being sold locally.<br /><br />I bought the 24 ounce canister because I was worried that it might get discontinued and because its a much better value. The only down side is that it doesnt have a shaker top.<br /><br />Anyway, I now enjoy fish and Im staying on my diet because of this seasoning. It works well with everything.<br /><br />Even my daughter likes it so its definitely a hit at our house!

Not as good =( Don't stop making this Mr. Prudhomme, I'm warning you.<br /><br />Try chopping up a mango, half a peach, a tiny bit of bell pepper, throw in some cilantro, juice a lemon on top, drizzle some honey, dash of salt, and let marinade while your salmon is in the oven. Serve salsa on top, perfect mix of sweet and sour.

review/text: I tried to find out the ingredient list before I purchased this seasoning. I went to Paul's website and it didn't list the ingredients. It said this: Salmon Magic(tm), Chef Paul's newest creation, is a unique blend of carefully selected herbs and spices with subtle accents of dry mustard seeds.<br /> After I received it the first ingredient listed was Sugar. My problem is that I don't like sweet tasting food unless it's a dessert. I tried to like it but I could hardly get through dinner. If you like your food on the slightly sweet side it will probably be fine for you.<br /><br />P.S. I really like his Seafood and Blackened Redfish Magic.
