review/summary: Terrific for picky dogs
review/text: I have a 5 lb Maltese who eats more like a cat. He eats until he is full and walks away. Dry food is best, I am told but it so.... "dry". I don't want to give him human food because I'm told I shouldn't - but also because he eats so little, I want to be sure he's healthy. My solution has been to buy Cesar by the case from Amazon (auto shipment) and mix it with his dry. I buy dry food for small adult dogs, mix a scoop (1 cup?) with 1/4-1/3 container of Cesar. I mix it with a for or my hands (so he doesn't just eat the Cesar and walk away). He gets the benefit of dry food for his teeth etc and the tastiness of Cesar's wonderful flavors.

review/summary: Decent taste - 5 servings per box
review/text: I get tired of labels selectively enhancing numbers to mislead, so these get a star off for that.<br />Big bolded letters it says: "10 bars" below, in smaller letters you'll see a small pack has 2 bars. At least they have the decency to call a serving (at the back on small letters: 2 bars).<br />The bars are very small, so it's no surprise that this is the case.<br /><br />On a positive note, the oats are organic, as are a lot of the ingredients. The bars crumble a bit much, so you might lose a piece or two to the floor.<br /><br />Overall, given the quality of the ingredients, and the decent taste, these are a good choice. However, a lot of the time the cost per bar* (10 bars in a box, 2 per pack) is close to a dollar, an honestly, anything over 50 cents is way too much for the size of these, and you would be better off with any of the other products out there that fill you up even more (1 dollar protein bars come to mind - they weigh a lot more than 2 of these).

review/summary: Not a fan of granola bars, but the taste of these wowed me
review/text: I don't typically buy or snack on granola bars. They are often more chewy than like a crisp cookie and taste of honey and artificial ingredients. In fact, I would never have tried these were there not a sample bowl of them at a local grocery store.<br /><br />I was more than shocked...it almost tasted like a homemade oatmeal cookie.  In fact it was so good I returned for seconds and bought 2 boxes of these and 3 other flavors as well. Although the chocolate chip is a close second, these are hands down the best in my opinion.<br /><br />Surprisingly the calorie count on the box is for TWO bars. While many manufacturers try to sneak in calories by doing things like saying there are 2 servings in soda can or 2 servings in a single frozen dinner so the calorie count looks smaller, they were more than generous. TWO bars of most of their flavors have only 160 calories and for a mega sweet fix that satisfies me plenty with just one bar, that wowed me.<br /><br />This is an organic bar and they are actually vegan. Not that they advertise this anywhere, I just read labels and was surprised to see no dairy or eggs listed. One servings gives you 40% of your daily recommended serving of whole grains yet it tastes like a cookie or dessert...and that also means a nice doce of fiber.<br /><br />While I wouldn't fool myself into thinking that I'm eating HEALTHY just because of the whole grains and organic ingredients...it is, afterall, sweet and has 11g of sugar (but that's for two bars, remember, and one is plenty filling for me so that's not so bad for a sweet snack.) I do feel I am eating healthier than most alternatives when I'm craving a sweet snack that I can tote in a purse or keep in my desk drawer. Most bow far deeper into the less healthy alternatives of preservatives to keep them shelf-stable, or far more sugar.<br /><br />Not to be confused with a protein bar or one packed with vitamins, of which it's not, it's still a healthy alternative to the afternoon candy bar or morning donut in the break room and in my opinion it tastes way better than either.

review/summary: Low. Low. I repeat: Low.
review/text: I'm not stupid. I have nearly a degree from a major university. I read this description over and over, and still it didn't make any sense. Ten bars! Pack of two! Two boxes! Forty-eight! Hike!<br /><br />Like me, you'll probably be surprised by the dearth of product. You get two boxes. Each contains five packets. Each packet has 2 bars, sure -- but the weight of each packet is 1.5 oz, which is less than two-thirds the weight of ONE regular Clif bar. These bars are maybe 1 1/2" wide, 4" long, and 1/4" thick. You'll be tempted to use them to file your nails. Why would Clif suddenly decide that humans can't take a granola bar that weighs more than .75 oz -- and package two of them together? Gosh, let's all think.<br /><br />Anyway, now you know. On the plus side, if you don't like these -- I'd give them a 5 out of 10 on taste -- just hold the box in your open palm, and a hefty breeze will take them away.

review/summary: Great taste, but not very filling
review/text: I am a huge fan of Clif products, and consume them almost daily. My breakfast every single work day consists of a standard Clif Bar, and I also occasionally eat a Clif Builder's Bar after a strenuous workout. Happy with all previous Clif products, I purchased a couple boxes of these Clif Crunch Bars, in the Chocolate Chip flavor. Like other Clif products, the whole ingredients list consists of real, natural items; nothing on the list that you can't pronounce or identify.<br /><br />If this review were based on taste and taste alone, there is no doubt in my mind that these bars would deserve a full 5 stars. Given that the bars are relatively healthy, with a solid ingredients list, they taste wonderful; I wouldn't have them change a single thing. Unfortunately, the big downside to this product is the fact that they just aren't nearly as filling as other Clif products. Each pack contains two separate bars, and as far as satisfying hunger goes, I need to eat two complete packs of these Crunch Bars to get the same amount of satisfaction as a single normal Clif bar. Granted, these are lower in calories than the normal bar, but they just don't seem to cut it if I want a quick snack that will fill me up.<br /><br />Another product I have used that is about the same nutritional content as the Crunch Bar, but seems to satisfy my hunger better, are the standard Nature Valley Granola bars. I will keep buying Clif products, but these Clif Crunch Bars will likely not make it back onto my shopping list anytime soon.

review/summary: Overpriced! Not what you are expecting.
review/text: My main beef with this product is with the labeling.<br /><br />The box is labeled very deceptively. This goes double when inspecting the packaging from the Web (as you are doing now). "10 bars" is prominently displayed on the box. Lo and behold, once you open the box, only five bars are present. Upon further inspection, you see that printed in mice-type on the box is "5 two count packages". The net weight of the entire box is 7.4 ounces. That's less than one cup of granola. That's when you realize you've been had.<br /><br />You can buy a mega-size box of Nature Valley granola bars from a warehouse club for less money than the "Pack of 2" you'll find here. I mention Nature Valley because in a blind taste test you won't be able to distinguish that brand from these Clif bars.<br /><br />Seriously, if they are selling them for this much on Amazon, I'd be shocked and chagrined to see what they go for at the camping stores which is their retailer of origin.<br /><br />I consider myself embarrassed to have been duped so badly on this one. Clif has seriously damaged their brand credibility. Live and learn.

The peanut butter bars taste like they are made with actual peanut butter holding the grains together.  The white chocolate macadamia nut bars have little pieces of soy white chocolate in the bars and you can taste them when you bite in.  These bars can keep me full for a while and are a great snack.  Appropriate for a plant based diet.

review/text: I have been trying to eat better. And I have been going on photo walks. I find that I need something with me in case I get hungry. Fruit doesn't travel well. Granola bars do well in my bag. But chewy bars get too sticky. And most crunchy granola bars are so hard I am always worried I would lose a tooth or two. I saw these at Nutrition S'mart yesterday and picked them up. I tried one before I got home. They have a great crunch, not too hard, and a wonderful flavor. Now I want to try the other flavors but my local Nutrition S'mart only had 2.

Anyway, these are highly recommended if you want a delicious crunchy peanut butter granola bar that just happens to have all the nutrition we've come to expect from CLIF. Yum-O!

review/text: These taste great but they are small bars.  My biggest complaint is that I have to eat these while standing over a sink or trash to avoid making a mess.  I've gone through 6 or 7 boxes and not one package has had two completely intact bars.  Most of the time there are just lots of crumbles from the edges of the bars but occasionally you'll find a bar that was jostled around enough to be broken into three or more pieces.  Certainly, this is a combination of the composition of the granola bar and lack of completely protective packaging.  But be warned that you will have lots of crumbled Clif Crunch bars if you order this through Amazon.

review/text: "Cocoa" is the ingredient on the label of the chocolate peanut butter Clif crunch bars but I found these Clif Crunch snack bars less overly-sweet than many others.  They taste like they contain dark, as opposed to the easy-to-find milk, chocolate. I recommend them to dark chocolate lovers and ordered three more boxes, straight-away.<br /><br />On the other hand, the blueberry bars are a loser, in my opinion. There is only a faint blueberry flavor.  This blueberry-lover would just love one choc-full of dried blueberries, adding the appropriate blueberry flavor to these crunchy snack bars.

review/text: I came across these granola bars as part of the Subscribe & Save program.  Much to my dismay, the subscription service option was discontinued.  They are so good, however, I've continued to purchase them.  Even my children really like them and they usually only like granola bars if they are packed with so much sugar and covered in chocolate to the point you can't distinguish them from a candy bar.<br /><br />I like the Clif brand and what the company is trying to do, besides offering a more wholesome granola bar without compromising taste.<br /><br />The granola bars are certified organic by QAI and packaging is made from 100% recycled material.  Hey, every little bit helps when you're trying to reduce your carbon footprint.

review/text: I've tried a wide variety of granola bars and I have to say, these are some really great tasting bars. If you like peanut butter, you will love these. Each box comes with 5 packages of 2 bars a piece. These are a great snack for the middle of the day. I'm looking forward to trying out the other flavors. If you get it with S&S, the price is very low as well. Overall, this is a great granola bar at a great price!

review/text: My daughter loves these bars.  The order came quickly.  No complaints whatsoever.  The only thing I would mention is that these bars are crumbly and do not "travel well" compared to the softer bars out there.  So I think we will have some softer bars for travel and these bars when travel is not an issue.  Hope that makes sense!

review/summary: Filling and taste great too!
review/text: I like Clif bars because they taste good but not great enough that you want to eat a whole lot of them. These crunch bars are no exception. I usually have clif bars in my school bag to stave off hunger during classes before succumbing to the call of a vending machine.<br /><br />The Chocolate Macadamia Nut flavor is a bit too sweet for my tastes which was a little surprising for a Clif bar (but it is chocolate). I like that each packet comes with two thin bars rather than one big granola bar - great for sharing or portioning.

review/text: I like Clif products in general and this one is also pretty good.  It tastes good and it has better list of ingredients than the more processed ones from Nature's Valley, etc.  But the thing crumbles too much.  It doesn't hold together very well and from the moment you open the package, there's crumbs all over you.  Just be aware of it.  It's tasty and crunchy as they say on the package.

review/summary: Clif Crunch Bar
review/text: I love these things! Usually they go on sale on Amazon and I only buy them when they are about $6 - 7 for the pack of two. My favorite kind is the white chocolate macadamia nut. However, when I bought them I wasn't expecting them to be quite so messy. They are definitely crunchy, and you will get crumbs everywhere - so keep that in mind. Otherwise I love the things! I'm a college student so this is a good breakfast or snack on my walk to class.

review/summary: Decent granola bar, but the packaging is a bit misleading
review/text: When I first opened the box I was surprised to find 5 packages of granola bars, each with 2 bars each, so a "10-pack" has 5 packages with 2 granola bars in each package (I never noticed it was normal to do that with granola bars), hence the serving size is 2 bars. The price for each packet is about the same as that of a normal clif bar, so I don't know if it's really worth it to me. You get about 60% more mass with a clif bar than with this for the same price.<br /><br />That being said, they taste decent and taste good broken into pieces with peanut butter and nutella.

No high fructose corn syrup, a big plus.  They do have "evaporated cane juice" as the sweetener.  I'm not familiar with it, but a quick google search shows it to be a healthier and better alternative to regular cane sugar.<br /><br />Great texture and crunch, and great flavor.  A perfect snack that is much much healthier than a lot of alternatives.<br /><br />I could not imagine a better granola bar.  Try these, you won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Crunched Crunch
review/text: Got these with a one-day shipping delay, but still very quickly with Amazon Prime.  The taste is quite good, perhaps a little on the sweet side - especially when you hit a pocket of white chocolate.  The big problem is the condition of the product when it arrives.  I opened my first 2-pack and the granola bars were crushed into nuggets and powder.  Strangely, the box wasn't in bad shape, just the bars.  A few days later, I opened the other box of granola bars, which was in better shape than the first one, and the first pack I tried again contained smashed fragments of granola bars.  These are no fun to eat, as you can't really open the pack and pour it into your mouth (I tried), and if you pick out the big chunks you get fragments and powder sticking to your fingers, and on your clothes (and in your beard).  I'll eat the rest, maybe out of a bowl with a spoon or something (with some fava beans and a nice chianti...), but I won't be ordering any more crunched Clif Crunch bars.

review/text: I was surprised to have found this item.  I had been looking for it for quite some time as we spend alot of time travelling and want to bring our own creamers (hazelnut flavor) But when i received the order - I was a little disappointed for a few reasons:  (1)some of them had leaked into the carton and (2) the expiration date of item was September 09 (just two months away).  I guess that is why they only had three left to sell (expiration date was coming up).  I believe when advertising an item like this - the expiration of the item should be listed so that we can make a decision on whether to order it or not

review/text: I use these individual creamers at work since the office only supplies the dry powder with its coffee set up.  Some folks buy the bottles of flavored cream that require refrigeration but that has its own complexities (expiration, unauthorized "sharing" by others, etc.)  Since these little cups need no refrigeration, I keep a box in my desk drawer and use on demand.  It was always a challenge to remember to buy another box at the grocery story when I ran low at the office, and now I don't have to remember.  Instead, I have several months worth and with the subscribe and save option, it came right to my door.

These creamers do not need to be refrigerated, so I can just leave them at my desk, or just carry few in my purse - so convenient! Hazelnut and French Vanilla are the only two flavors taste normal to me. Hazelnut has stronger flavor comparing to French Vanilla.

review/text: This creamer tastes superb and is my favorite of all creamers.  And I prefer the pods like this because I can keep them in my desk drawer and one pod is perfect for one mug of coffee.  I'd give it a five it didn't use saturated fat.<br /><br />But compare the price to what you'd pay locally (and factor in taxes). I can get it cheaper at Walmart and Big Lots.

review/summary: I just tried these for the first time, and they fall somewhere in the middle of the pack of Pringles flavors
review/text: I like Pringles, and I bought this flavor on purpose, since I like to know what my snacking optins are.  You see, I am a major salty-crispy snack kind of guy.<br /><br />I love chips, cheetos (crunchy), and just about anything that crunches and has salt involved.  I am able to tell how well I like a snack by the degree of vigor with which I attack the snack, and how hard I have to try to stop before I eat the whole thing.  For example, for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026QR7F2">Regular Pringles Original, Super Stack</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026QR22A">Pringles Potato Crisps Super Stack, Barbeque, 6.38-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 14)</a>, or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003URUI4I">Pringles Cheddar Cheese Grab AND Go!, 2.61-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a> flavored chips I look at the side of the can and it says that it contains about 6 servings, and all I can do is laugh.  I know myself well enough to know that left to my own devices that for those flavors of chips that the serving size is one entire can!  But, when I come across a snack that just doesn't do it for me, I find it easy to stop.  It was no problem stopping eating these Honey Mustard Pringles by the time I had eaten about 1/3 or so of a can.<br /><br />I am a BIG fan of honey mustard, but that flavor combined with Pringles worked only adequately for me.  If, however, you like the new onion-flavored Pringles, you are sure to love these.  If not, then these will probably be a bit better for you, but not up to snuff with sour cream and onion, BBQ, or regular flavored Pringles.  The taste of the Honey Mustard variety is a bit flat, but fortunately lacks the rather repelling aftertaste that the Onion flavored Princles have...which is called umami flavor...and that's L-glutamate, the stuff that makes bacon taste so good.<br /><br />Anyway, I have to say that Honey Mustard Pringles are good, but certainly not great, so that falls into the 3-star category for me.  I liked them, "liked", but that's all.  So I'll be giving these a miss as long as there are 5-star snacks around.<br /><br />3 stars.

I enjoy this tea with a hint of sugar, but you could also add milk if you like. This is a black tea that has a hint of vanilla in it. It's my favorite tea by far (and I drink a lot of tea).

review/summary: A marvelous organic breakfast tea
review/text: Octavia French Breakfast tea is an organic and fair trade, loose leaf black tea which is simply marvelous!  It is a rich and full-bodied breakfast tea laced with organic rose petals and subtle hints of vanilla and caramel. It has a lovely natural sweetness and I prefer it black so I can enjoy each of the delicate layers of flavor.<br /><br />I recently acquired a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LNOPSG">The Breville One-Touch Tea Maker</a> which is a brilliant way to prepare loose tea.  This Octavia French Breakfast tea when brewed in the Breville is extraordinary and I don't think I'll ever be able to drink black tea from a tea bag again!  I've been so spoiled!<br /><br />The tea comes in very practical but attractive 4.2-ounce tins which ensure freshness.  The label indicates that one tin provides 50 servings but I have discovered that each brew can be infused several times so a tin of this tea should last well.  The pack of 2 tins at Amazon is a very good value and I'm very happy that it is available here.

review/summary: Green Tea Helps You Lose Weight
review/text: Green Tea Helps You Lose Weight<br /><br />Green tea is believed to be a potential agent, which can help you to lose weight. Weight loss has become a serious matter in the present world. The possible reasons for weight loss can be many such as lifestyle factors, the diet and stress and strain the modern life. Irrespective of the possible reasons, there is a need for an ultimate solution since the weight gain or obesity can lead to many serious health hazards such as diabetes, and the heart diseases. Green tea is projected as an effective weight loss remedy since many of the reports show positive effects.<br /><br />Nature green tea is better than artificial greens tea product<br /><br />Green tea is primarily appreciated for the weight loss since it is a natural substance. Now, many artificial products are available in the market, claiming that are effective for weight loss. Since most of them manifested side effects, people have started searching for reliable natural products. Green tea is an herbal decoction, which is made from the unfermented leaves of Camellia sinensis. It is a proven stimulant that is regularly used as a beverage in the eastern countries. It is postulated that the green tea have medicinal properties and the traditional medicinal systems support the argument with evidences. It can be used to protect the heart, liver, skin, pancreas, oral systems and most importantly as a curative for cancer. However, the effectiveness of the green tea to lose weight cannot be proved from the medicinal properties. But, the scientific crowd is relying on the active ingredients of the green tea.<br />How green tea promote weight loss<br /><br />Green tea is recommended for the diet aid mainly because of its multifaceted effects on health. The major active component that attributes the properties to the green tea are the polyphenols such as catechin, epicatechin, epicatechin gallate, gallaogatechin, epigallocatechin, and apigallocatechin gallate (known as EGCG). Even though it have alkaloids such as caffeine, the EGCG is effective to compensate their effect and trigger the metabolism rate. The studies show that EGCG, which is a natural antioxidant, is also an effective thermogenic that can burn off the calories. Using the green tea, energy expenditure and metabolic rate is hiked at a rate of 4%, which will certainly help you for weight loss.<br /><br />Green tea catechins will also acts as a glucose regulator. It regulates the insulin level in the body and inhibits the sudden rise of insulin in the body after the food, which may initiate the fat conversion. The lowering of the insulin level prevents the sugar level rise and the fat storage, which ultimately prevent the weight gain. And, the influence in blood sugar level has proven some effect in the appetite level, also. The continuous intake of green tea is suspected to decrease the appetite, which naturally contribute to the weight loss.<br /><br />To add on, if you do not even count any of the above attributes of herbal green tea too, a simple factor will certainly add a cutting edge to green tea. If you are lenient enough to just substitute the usual morning drink, which is rich with calories, with a cup of green tea itself can definitely help you lose weight.<br />How to use green tea for your diet<br /><br />The easiest way to include green tea in your diet is to drink it. However, you could also use greentea extract pill and green tea patch.<br /><br />Drink green tea - This is the best way and the most effect way to get the full benefit from green tea. Since it is still unknown which anti-oxide in green tea encourage fat loss, it is the best to take it with its original form. The easiest way is to put green tea bag in hot water and let it rest for 3 to 4 minutes. However, you could also try LIPTON Diet Green Tea with Citrus or LIPTON Diet Green Tea with mix barriers (most believe commercial tea product contain only small amount of tea)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002OHVCIQ">Kancura Herb Slimming Tea + Genseng Tea</a><br /><br />The end

review/text: I am so glad that Amazon has this tea! As, I never even heard of this Green Beans Coffee company prior to this order. Green Beans Coffee got it's start supporting the US Military and continues to do that.<br />  AND, this Extreme Tea that they have is great!  As soon as I opened it- I could smell a pleasant fruity flavor (like orange/kiwi maybe? Definitely/evidently, pleasantly, fruity!) and couldn't wait to taste it:<br />  Also, in addition to tasting good:  I was surprised that this Extreme Tea actually does, quickly, give that zing stated. Within about 25-30mins of drinking a cup- I really felt an energetic lift!  I'm an avid tea drinker- and, from any other tea, I've NEVER experienced the very noticeable boost that this tea gives. Actually, very noticeably zingy!<br />  If you prefer tea instead of coffee:  This Extreme Tea tastes great and, like coffee, gives the needed boost or zing as well.  And, with all of tea's well-known antioxidant benefits this is most welcome.  If you need a healthy antioxidant energy drink- it's even cool to make iced tea from this like I have done and be on the go!<br />  The only thing I feel buyers would desire to know is the actual amount of caffeine within this Tea, and I couldn't find the caffeine content about any of their products on the Green Beans Coffee company's website.  But, this tea is a 5star! I'm ordering more.  AND, I'll do so knowing that I'm ordering from a company that supports our US Troops. Win-win. After drinking this, I'm thinking:  Starbucks who???

review/text: Although I have never ordered the candies from a website, I have heard from other reviews that the shipping is outrageous. I find that very disapointing since the chocolates themselves are so outstanding. However, these are available at other locations like airports around the country. That is, now a days you need to actually be flying in order to enter the shopping area, but that are often there if you do!
