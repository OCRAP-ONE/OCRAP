review/text: My kid is absolutely crazy about Haribos, this is the only candy/chocolate I dont share her passion with.<br />For starters it is a bit too rubbery and chewy. Agreed it has flavor, but the flavor has be fought for by chewing really hard,<br />I Prefer something that would not be so rubbery. but again, individual tastes differ.<br />The good part is it comes in those mini packs, really handy when travelling out with kids, I usually keep few of these in my bag for "emergency" tantrum situations.. comes in handy.

Unfortunately somewhere in Amazon's shipping chain someone cut open one of the boxes and stole one of the packages.

I reported this to Amazon but I received no response.<br /><br />I had previously only ordered books from Amazon and never had a problem, always received what I ordered in good condition and well packed.<br /><br />What really ticks me off is that they did not respond when I reported the theft.<br /><br />Peter

review/text: I have been eating 3lbs bags of Haribo for years, enjoying this candy exclusively. Tonight I ate a handful from the bag and nearly gagged, this stuff was disgusting!  I looked on the back of the bag and saw MADE IN TURKEY!  Amazon has never cheated me before, but this was shameful.  I will NOT eat Haribo products again, and have already tossed that worthless bag of gunk into the compost.  Shame on Haribo for producing candy in Turkey and sending the filth to the USA!

review/summary: Bali's Best contains no HFCS (other reviewer is wrong)
review/text: I couldn't believe that someone spread such utter porcine ablution about my favorite coffee candy.<br /><br />IT DOES NOT CONTAIN HIGH-FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP. Never did, never will.<br /><br />Ingredients: Cane Sugar, Glucose (tapioca), Milk Powder, Coffee Extract, Natural Coffee Flavor, Coconut Oil, Salt, Caramel.<br /><br />Don't take my word for it, go to naturalhomeandgarden-dot-com; "The Arabica coffee used in our candy originates solely from the Toraja Province in the northern Indonesian Islands, one of the finest growing regions in that area. Arabica coffee from this region is considered by many as the best in the world, prized for its full body, well balanced acidity, and sweet and woody notes. Rooted with a deep sense of cultural history, the coffee has been grown in this region for over two centuries. It is considered by connoisseurs to be among the finest and rarest in the world."<br /><br />Bali's Best is simply the finest coffee candy I've ever tasted. It tastes exactly like a cup of fresh-brewed Sumatran coffee, with just enough sweetness to officially qualify as "candy."<br /><br />I have no idea what the other bozo reviewing this product was eating, but it certainly wasn't Bali's Best coffee candy. (They don't know the difference between HFCS and tapioca-derived glucose, either.)

Not only does it break up in your mouth, but the texture of the center goop is nauseating like a blob of snot. It breaks into sharp shards first, then you get the gross inner surprise...bleh!!! If you like high fructose type syrup, then this crap is for you.

review/summary: Hope you like it burnt
review/text: The friendly face of Mr. Redenbacher may grace this bag of popcorn, and the bright colors and promising text may promise a healthy snack in every bag, but don't be fooled.  Behind that kind smile and bright colors is the smell of smoke, and blackened dreams.<br /><br />Simply put, this is the worst popcorn I've ever had.  Not for it's taste, but in the fact that every single time I've microwaved it, both the popcorn and the bag itself come out burnt.  No matter how closely I followed the directions, or turned down the power setting, or changed the times, both the bag and the corn came out blackened, filling the kitchen with the pungent odor of burnt popcorn.<br /><br />For those who think the problem may lie with the microwave I used, that wasn't the case, as it is new (only a month old).  While I initially went on a setting of 10 (high), like the bag recommends, I eventually resorted to going as low as 7, which resulted in the bag going flat, and the bottom getting burned.  At that point, my father and I agreed that I had wasted my money.  I've popped bags of popcorn over 5 years old that tasted better and come out with no burn marks whatsoever.<br /><br />Despite the low calorie count per bag, this is one popcorn best left on the shelf.

review/summary: lower quality food--  not recommended
review/text: This isn't the worst quality food you could feed, but it isn't a high quality product, either.  Yet the price is comparable to premium quality holistic foods-- probably a marketing decision related to Rachel Ray's starpower?  I purchased this during an emergency- an ice storm had begun and I was out of dog food, so I grabbed a small bag at a convenient store on the way home from work.  My dogs ate it willingly, although they didn't love it.<br /><br />Nutrish foods (both the chicken and beef options) have lots of indigestible corn, artificial dyes, and gluten.  Corn seems to pass through most dogs nearly undigested, leading to large stools and wasted money.  Gluten was the ingredient implicated in the tainted pet food scandals over the last couple of years-- it just isn't a wholesome ingredient, and it's one I tend to avoid. The good things I can say about this food are that it doesn't use yucky slaughterhouse "by-products", and that it includes great vegetable ingredients.  Overall, there are worse options on the grocery store shelves, but this is an overpriced, less-than-great food choice for your best pal.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Ingredients list, so you can make up your own mind:<br />Chicken, Chicken Meal, Brewers Rice, Corn Meal, Soybean Meal, Animal Fat (Preserved with Mixed Tocopherols), Corn Gluten Meal, Brown Rice, Oatmeal, Dried Beet Pulp, Natural Flavor, Dicalcium Phosphate, Salt, Calcium Carbonate, Dehydrated Alfalfa, Dried Peas, Dried Tomatoes, Dried Carrots, Potassium Chloride, Choline Chloride, Olive Oil, Vitamin E Supplement, Zinc Sulfate, Ferrous Sulfate, Iron Oxide, Dried Parsley, L-Ascorbyl-2-Polyphosphate (Source of Vitamin C), Mixed Tocopherols,plus the expected vitamins.<br />``````````````````<br /><br />Here are a couple of alternatives you might want to check out:<br />Nutro Natural Choice Ultra Adult Dog Food- net wt. 35 lbs., Blue Buffalo Chicken & Brown Rice Adult Dog Food, 30 lbs., Wellness Super5Mix Chicken Dry Dog Food (30-lb bag)or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009YWMYE">Blue Buffalo Lamb & Brown Rice Adult Dog Food, 30 lbs.</a>.

review/summary: Expensive Junk
review/text: There you think the name Rachael Ray would be associated with a high quality product.... it isn't. Perhaps Rachael doesn't know what a high quality ingredient is.<br /><br />Nutrish is full of fillers and allergens, though it says No Fillers on the packaging. Brown Rice is #8 on the ingredient list, which means there's hardly any brown rice in it. One of the main ingredient is Brewers Rice. Corn and soy are allergens + dogs cannot digest corn.<br /><br />***Brewers rice is the small milled fragments of rice kernels that have been separated from the larger kernels of milled rice. (AAFCO definition).[1] Brewers rice is a processed rice product that is missing many of the nutrients contained in whole ground rice and***<br /><br />I received samples of this food sent to me by the manufacturer. The samples were past the expiration date and the ingredients of the product are not good enough for my dogs. I'm sticking with Innova.

review/summary: Fillers, allergens & rendered animal fat: YUCK
review/text: Rachel Ray either knows NOTHING about dog nutrition or she doesn't care.  Rachel, you are no Martha Stewart.<br /><br />Nutrish is anything but, it's loaded with COMMON dog food allergens (soy & corn), fillers (corn gluten & dried beet pulp) and<br />'animal fat'... which is a nice way of saying: We took all the dead & diseased animals from the slaughterhouse leftovers, plus the euthanized dogs & cats, rendered them down, drained off the fat & sold it back to the makers of Nutrish as 'animal fat'.<br /><br />There was a big investigation by the Dept. of Agriculture about 15 years ago, that discovered that many dog foods that<br />contained ANIMAL FAT had high amounts of barbiturates in them, because the fat contained the rendered remains of<br />euthanized pets, which are euthanized by a barbiturate overdose.  DVMs across the US were finding that it was taking<br />more of the barbiturate to euthanize the pet because the pet was being fed a small dose in its food on a daily basis,<br />due to the rendered animal fat found in about 25 dog foods, including Nutro.<br /><br />Dried Beet Pulp is the by-product that is left over from the processing of sugar beets, they extract the sugar, and what's left<br />is beet pulp (usually fed to pigs as it's cheap), but in dogs (which are carnivores) it's INDIGESTIBLE & produces gas (which<br />can cause gastric torsion - fatal if not caught & repaired via a DVM surgery in time) and beet pulp produces a FALSELY firm<br />stool, causing you to believe that your beloved dog is healthy because he's pooping some firm poops.<br /><br />No, the dog can't digest the beet pulp, it dehydrates the dog & passes through like a bale of hay....<br /><br />A good dog food contains WHOLE ingredients (not meal), no fillers, no soy, corn or wheat, whole fruits & veggies, no<br />salt and should contain whole turkey or chicken, whole herring and cottage cheese.  Your dog does not need salt if<br />the food contains whole veggies, potatoes, whole fish or cottage cheese, as those foods naturally contain salt.<br /><br />Natura Pet makes Evo (grain free), Innova, California Natural, and their pet food (cat, dog, ferret) contain 100%<br />HUMAN GRADE ingredients... "natural" means nothing.  Natura sells to mom & pop pet food stores, not chains or<br />supermarkets, because their food is preservative free, very tasty & HIGHLY caloric, so feed 1/2 the amount that<br />you would normally feed.  On Evo & on Innova your dog will poop 75--50% less stool volume because there's no<br />fillers and it's digestible.  These foods produce a glorious coat & even the pickiest eater will eat them.  Don't<br />supplement with canned food or other items, you won't need them.<br /><br />My Borzoi would spit out filet mignon scraps if they were cold, not sauteed in butter.  LOL!  But, she LOVED Evo.

On the plus side however, her "Just 6" treats is one of BEST products out there, so I know she has the knowledge to make heathy foods for pets, just not willing to part with her money in her dog food line. My dogs LOVE the Just 6 treats and because they are super good for them I do not mind feeding them the treats,but not the food.

review/summary: A ginormous box of 1,000 tea bags
review/text: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile. I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you really, truly like chamomile tea, or own a restaurant, this ginormous box of 1,000 single-serving tea bags is a good choice.

I will never do business with this company again and if their ratings are to believed, I'm not the only one very unhappy with them lately. I gave them a single star only because they did return my money.

review/text: There has never been a more clever design for candy than the m and m.  The hard candy shell allows it to survive in harsh climates that would ruin chocolate exposed to the temperature highs and lows.  If you can eat just a few, then this should be a part of your home like that container of pretzels.  If, on the other hand, you like to take a container and camp out in front of the tv or computer with them, then the calories start climbing...

review/summary: Good, but not as good as Taylors Scottish Breakfast
review/text: We got hooked on Scottish Breakfast after a week in Speyside. Taylors of Harrogate brand is probably the closest to what you actually get in Scotland. This is not quite as malty and rich as that tea, and tends to brew up a slightly lighter color, but if you are buying in bulk, it's about half as expensive as Taylors. It can also be a bit sharp if over-steeped, but that can be said of just about any black tea - it just seems like Taylors is a bit more forgiving. So even though it gets three out of five for overall quality, it should get five of five for value - for $10/lb, if you can get free shipping, it's quite a good deal. Have this tea for an every day cup, and save the $20/lb Taylors for special occasions.

review/text: I'm a wings freak, I rarely get wings anymore at restaurants because they just are not good enough, fast food wings,,,,FORGET IT! If you want the best wings you have ever had, in my very critical opinion, follow this: Put 10 paper towel dried wings, skin on, in a gallon plastic bag with seasoned pancake mix and shake, tap off excess and place on pan. Heat fresh peanut oil, use enough oil so all the wings will be submerged in a deep fryer or Wok, get it very hot but not smoking. Drop in wings, turning as needed. I like them extra crispy, so I wait until they stop bubbling, indicating that all the water is out of them and the chicken fat has melted into the oil, remove and drain on paper towels. I use a large stainless bowl and add Crystal Wing sauce, a tablespoon of salted butter, and an once or two of white vinegar, heat just a bit on burner and add wings and flip a few times until coated. Serve with carrots and celery with a buttermilk ranch dip. Tried the same recipe with other sauces, but its a waste of time and chicken, this sauce is King.

review/text: Advertised was a 15 pack of gum, 6 of spearmint, 6 of peppermint, and 3 of another kind of mint. I expected fifteen packs of gum, and bought this because of the quantity relative to the price. I am absolutely appalled that though the gum was in its original FIFTEEN pack box, only thirteen packs were present. One of each non-spearmint flavor was missing. It is rude and unprofessional for packagers to "take a couple for themself" and hope that no one is the wiser. If you are going to sell me thirteen packages of gum, do not advertise it as fifteen! To intentionally do this to customers is practically theft. Good day.

review/summary: The puppy loves this!
review/text: If my dog could review this product, she'd give it 5 stars. She obviously loves the bacon flavor and being a very licky puppy, this is a real treat for her. As the pet owner, I like that she seems so content with the product, but it's a non-traditional way of delivering a treat and seems a bit awkward. The treat is given through a roll-on ball, like the old deodorants. With little treat bites, you can reward a dog with one or two nibbles, but regulating the number of licks or the time they're allowed to lick doesn't work so well. For training purposes, I wouldn't recommend this product, but just for gratuitous treat giving, I think it's just fine.

review/summary: Smells Super; Our Dogs Have no Taste Appreciation
review/text: I reluctantly give this a 3 due mainly to the smell of the Liver Flavor.  The sole purpose of the product is to offer a flavorful break from the ordinary dog food flavors they normally receive but alas both picky Yorkies refused on several occasions to even take a good whiff.  They love freeze dried livers from chickens, beef, pig and lamb but cannot stand Lickety Stik.  Just to test the situation I tried the Stik first and it was a resounding NO.  Then after they had freeze dried livers and again it was NO.  I took their favorite dry food and applied a small amount on several pieces and mixed them in with untreated food.  They literally segregated the morsels into edible and Stiks.  The Stiks did not get touched while the unflavored were eaten with vigor.  Determined to prove that the Yorkies are just picky I offered a few licks to the neighbor's Retriever and he looked at me as if I am the fool I am.  Success did not open its heart on several days ago nor did it when I tried one more time with the same negative results.  I cannot say that any of the other flavors have any similar aspects since I only received the one container.  Bottom line:  Human Rating: 3  Dog Rating: 1 too many.  Sorry but the effort was there.

review/text: Our six dogs (four of our own, plus two foster dogs) all LOVE getting their "licks" from this Bacon Flavor Lickety Stik!!!  They are all medium to big dogs (Boxer mixes, Pit Bull mix, Black Lab mix , Plott Hound & Greyhound mix) and they all come a-runnin' when I pull the bottle out.  Even Mollie, our finicky-eater Black Lab mix, loves it.  Sometimes, they try to take a bite, but they all quickly figure out that the trick is to lick the little roll-on-deodorant-type ball.  The key, of course, is to hold the bottle while the dogs help themselves, as opposed to giving them the bottle to do with what they please...  ;o)<br /><br />The bottom line is the Bacon Flavored Lickety Stik gets a unanimous "Four Paws Up" from my test panel!

review/summary: Interesting way to "treat" your dog!
review/text: I have to say this is an unusual product.  It's made on the same order as a deodorant and the dog licks the roller to get the flavoring.  We got the liver flavor and all the dogs loved it.  In fact, there was some times when two dogs were trying to lick the roller at the same time since they can't seem to wait their turn.  It's definitely something to try...don't know how well it would do training your dog instead of the regular treats, though.  It'll probably get gross after a few lickings too but a damp paper towel should fix it up...especially if you wipe it after the dog uses it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't comment if it really tastes like liver flavor.  The dog's aren't talking but they definitely seem to like it...<br /><br />Oh yeah, and its made in the USA!

review/summary: Interesting Idea - Little Dogs Loved It
review/text: Well, the title says it all.  The little dogs of the household loved this interesting twist on the traditional treat.  They did not seem to understand why they were not allowed to walk off with it, but they grasped the concept eventually.  Often traveling with our two smallest poms, this "roll-on" style treat is a simple, non messy, non-poop-inducing alternative to traditional treats.  It is "just enough" when you want to reward them without having to worry about making a mess in the car.  I am not sure if this concept will catch on with the mainstream, but as long as it is competitively priced, I can see this being a useful tool for many dog-rearing activities.  While we are far past that stage, I can see this being helpful for different training activities as well.  Bring yourself and your dog "outside of the bubble" and give this new treat a try.

Or maybe it was a large-scale Big Lots-style buy where the guys at the pet food factory got an incredibly great deal when a Ban roll-on factory got flooded and had to unload a warehouse.<br /><br />In any event, what seems like a really weird idea is...well, a really weird idea that our dog LOVES.  Of course there's not much nutritional value to letting your dog take a few slurps off the end of a liver-flavored roll-on doggie treat, but hey, there's not much nutritional value to that rawhide toy you just bought him either.  Give this a try for dessert.

review/text: I have the most picky dog in the world.  She's a big dog, which usually means they'll eat anything, but not my dog, so when I got her the Likety Stik, I honestly didn't think she'd like it, but she loved it!  And what a great training tool.  Rather than fill your pocket with treats,(that usually go through the wash) you have a neat, no fuss way to reward them.<br /><br />I did have to squeeze it to get the liquid moving along after she'd licked it, and it dripped onto her pure white, newly bathed ruff, but it came off with just water, so no worries.<br /><br />I then took the Stik over to my in-laws to give to their obese King Charles spaniel, and he of course loved it, because he eats anything.  What they liked was being able to give him treats that didn't add to his weight problem.<br /><br />Lickety Stik is a great new way of treating your dog.  Whoever came up with it is a genius.  I'm going to buy every flavor for my dog, and one for my in-laws dog.

review/summary: Roller Jams, Wasted Product
review/text: The roller ball on this treat (basically gravy) does not roll around readily from the friction of my dog's tongue licking. The only way to get gravy out of the bottle to where the dog can get it is by squeezing the bottle to force the gravy out around the edges and letting the dog lick the gravy off the surface (kind of defeats the purpose of bothering with the roller ball). I let my dog lick this treat for two sessions, but when I went back the third, the roller jammed so no matter how hard I squeezed, none of the gravy inside was coming out. I stood the bottle upright and pushed down on the ball to try to loosen it from the bottle top edge and let more flow through. This seemed to get the flow going again for 2-3 rough squeezes, but it shortly jammed again. I can still move the roller ball around with my fingers, and there will be a little gravy stuck to the part of the ball I move into the open, but it's not working as it was the first two times. There is still 2-3 tablespoons of product left in the bottle. Sorry, but I'm not going to sit there and manually roll the ball around with my fingers or forever tinker with pushing down on the ball so my dog can lick a miniscule amount of gravy at a time. I've checked for anything blocking the area between the bottle end and roller ball, but haven't seen anything likely to stop the flow or rolling (no dried clumps, etc). The convenience is lost if the gravy doesn't come out by itself from squeezing the bottle and the roller ball can't roll with the dog's tongue alone.<br /><br />I would recommend not using this over any carpet or floor surfaces you don't want to risk getting stained since there will likely be dripping. The gravy (when it did come out from squeezing the bottle) comes out from all sides of the ball at once instead of from one point where the dog can focus, so depending on which side your dog likes to lick, it might not catch the gravy from the side that isn't being licked right away in time to catch the gravy before it falls to the floor.<br /><br />The taste seems to be rated middle to low by my dog. My dog loves bacon flavored treats (can't get enough Beggin' Strips) and ate this product up readily enough in the beginning when it was new, but it's since become clear he isn't crazy about it. Now he's seen what this gravy is about, he might take one or two licks then walk away. I have to keep calling him back to encourage him to finish up and take another lick. I don't think I would be able to get him to finish the bottle even if it were flowing properly.<br /><br />I'm not sure I would bother buying more of these unless I was assured of the reliability of the bottle not jamming again and the roller working properly. I would love to see some sort of refillable roller bottle offered so I could fill it with some cheap homemade gravy instead (there is no way to refill these bottles yourself) since I do like the concept of limiting how much gravy he's able to get at at a time via this roller mechanism.

review/summary: Lily LIKED It!!
review/text: My little diabetic shih-tzu, Lily, is notorious for hating anything new. I am constantly on the search for healthy new treats that I can give her after she has her insulin shot (every 12 hours...ugh!) I received the Liver flavor Lickety Stik and was prepared to donate it to the local animal shelter because I was just sure Lily would turn up her nose to it. Lo and behold...she liked it! It took a minute or two for her to figure out how to get the treat out and I squeezed the bottle too hard and some dripped on the floor, but Lily quickly lapped it up. I don't think the ball turned very easily, but she was determined to try to get the treat-juice out of the bottle. I think this is a great idea, but I am only giving it 4 stars because the packaging was hard to read and the ball didn't seem to turn very readily.

review/summary: A clever idea that didn't work.
review/text: The smell and taste of the Lickety Stik was an instant success with our dog.<br />But the dispensing ball dosen't move easily, very much of the time,<br />and it's a nuisance for us to keep helping the ball turn for our dog to get this treat.<br />We get more on our hands then our Golden gets in his mouth.<br />When we try to turn the ball for our dog, even we find it difficult.<br /><br />The roller BALL is a concern, we don't consider it 'pet safe'.<br />If our Golden Retriver got this bottle,<br />he could easily bite this roller ball out and would try to eat it.<br /><br />The ball requires a strong tounge to move it, even at that it gets stuck.<br />We can't imagine this stik being at all compatible with small dogs.<br />If you squeeze the bottle to force the liquid out around the ball<br />most of that drops to the ground between licks.<br /><br />This would be a great idea if it worked, and was truely 'pet safe'.

review/summary: Great Idea- My dog loves it.
review/text: I have one dog, Rex, a Shepherd/Lab mix and he absolutely loves the Lickety Stik. Now if he sees me get it out, he automatically sits or gives me his paw. So cute.<br /><br />This is a great new idea for doggy treats. Especially when walking my dog- I've gotten tired of carrying a bag of treats for him. And new ideas are always welcome, I don't want to overfeed my dog with other treats... They can get expensive because he's allergic to almost everything.<br /><br />So the lickety sticks come in three flavors- liver, chicken and bacon. Rex loved each one. The container that holds the liquid treat is a roller... I saw another reviewer describe it like a deodorant stick with a roller. That is exactly what the case is like. Unfortunately the liquid doesn't just come out when the ball is licked, the bottle has to be squeezed for your dog. My roller gets stuck if I don't squeeze or push it with my finger.<br /><br />I highly suggest trying this item out, great alternative to milk bones :)

review/summary: Great Idea for Dispensing Dog Treats
review/text: Really like the idea of a roller-ball to give treats, especially as rewards when training (skateboard, leash walking and close commands).  The dispenser is similar to a roll-on deodorant design.  Lickety Stik is a healthy all natural (according to the ads) liquid containing vitamins and low in calories in several flavors. The dispenser contains over 500 licks.  A no mess way to give rewards plus it carries the made in the USA with all-natural ingredients.  My English Bulldog puppy loves the stuff (liver flavor); however, it also comes in chicken and bacon flavors. Following  is a list for those who read the ingredients,  1)natural liver flavors, (2) cultured milk, (3) lecithin, (4) mixed tocopherols (natural preservative- a source of vitamin E), (5) scorbyl palmitate (source of vitamin C), (6) rosemary extract, (7) green tea extract.  A caution about dogs allergic to chicken - they should not be licking this stuff. Unlike most treats, the shelf life is 18 months and "best" licked by date is stamped on the bottom of the roll-on dispenser. The description indicates the Lickety Stik formula contains antimicrobial agents - basically no germ transfer. The stuff does not have to be refrigerated.  Naturally, you must shake the dispenser often.  Will be ordering the Lickety Stik 3 pack with all flavors from Amazon.  "Reilly" recommends the treat!

review/summary: Great, low-cal training treat.
review/text: I had to give the ball a partial turn to get some of the liquid on it after shaking to mix it up, but after I did that my dog licked away and loved it! This is a good low-cal treat for dogs and would be great as a training aid. Our dog dutifully performed her repertoire of tricks to get more of the treat, and then followed me back to the kitchen as I put it away. The only bad thing is that you DO have to hold it for the dog, but if you're using it as a training aid that may actually be an advantage.<br /><br />There are over 500 licks in each tube and 10 licks is only 1 calorie. I gave my dog 10 licks per trick.<br /><br />FWIW, my dog is a 1.5 year old hound dog/bird dog mutt.

review/summary: Good for a go around, but probably not the staple snack for Charlie
review/text: The Lickety Stick is truly a unique product. It's basically a rollerball bottle (like some deodorants) with different flavored syrups (like chicken, beef, or bacon). I've never seen anything like it. The promo video says dogs love the taste and it's very low cal (oddly, the video also warns of an epidemic of pet obesity, which while probably is true, I had never heard it described in such catastrophic and somber tones). The treat is on the high price end of what dog treats usaully cost, but the maker boasts each bottle contains over 500 licks. I've been trying to figure out if that's a good deal. Normal-sized treat bags don't usually have 500 treats, but on the other hand, you would never just give your dog 1 lick off this thing.<br /><br />If your dog likes the Lickety Stick (there are review testimonies here going both ways), then it's left up to you how long puppy gets to lick, so the touted cost-effectiveness could quickly evaporate (there is no recommended serving size on the bottle). All in all, the Lickety Stick reminds me of a sugar free lollipop. They can have a decent flavor, but not everyone will like them; they don't have calories, so they're "healthier;" and because they're calorie free, they don't fill you up at all, which leaves me with a final thought.<br /><br />Regular dog treats do at least have a substance factor; they are a solid food. The Lickety Stick is a calorie free liquid, so the filling factor is missing. And so while Charlie did enjoy the Lickety Stick, she probably won't be getting another one. She is already in great physical condition, eats an organic dog food regimented according to the bag-recommended diet, and is taking C9 vitamin supplements. Basically, she gets enough health stuff is what I'm saying; so when she does get a treat, I want her to enjoy it like the treat that it is. I'm not convinced the Lickety Stick does that. Now, if you are trying to wean your pet off table food or lower their weight, this product could probably help you do that.

review/summary: My dogs love it, even if it is funny looking
review/text: PetSafe Lickety Stik is a weird looking dispenser full of a delicious liquid treat my pooches are crazy about.  The strange design is slightly bigger than a deoderant bottle and the dogs get their treat by licking the roll-on ball!<br /><br />I own Wonderland Kennels, with 7 Boston Terriers and German Shepherds that I train and compete with.  Even the picky ones love this stuff.  The bottle is small, but it goes a loooong way because the pups are only getting a little at a time, instead of a larger treat.<br /><br />Pacino and Molly (German Shepherds) first instincts were to try to bite down on the dispenser, but it didn't crack and is still holding up fine.  They quickly learned to just lick it, though the best way to introduce it to larger dogs is to hold it completely upside-down so the angle makes it easier to lick and harder for them to grab.<br /><br />I'm honestly surprised by how big a hit this little Lickety Stik is with my pups, and how long the bottle lasts.  Maizy, Molly, Gracie, Pixi, Einstein, Pacino, and Isabelle each give it four paws up!  :)

review/text: When I received this "Lickety Stik", I really wasn't sure what to expect with my dog.  Turns out I had nothing to worry about - he is CRAZY about it.  If I even go near the bottle he starts wagging his tail and giving me the excited look.  One aspect about this doohickey I really like is that you can use it as a reward for your pet, without constantly having to give him a biscuit or similar treat; just a lick off the Lickety Stik will do the trick!  The occasional biscuit and treat is okay, but this is much better for active training.  Highly recommend, though you may want to shy away from trying it yourself.

The container is 5" tall and approx. 1 1/2" around and easily fit right in my jeans pocket, so this would be very easy to take on a walk. I could also see that this might be helpful if you happen to have a dog who won't eat - you could roll the liquid around the edge of his bowl and it may entice him to eat.

Then I rolled it on their muzzle like an antiperspirant they seemed to like it.<br />It's a great idea and a wonderful product to use if your pet will cooperate. It is clean, you can keep it in your pocket and not end up with little bits of kibble in the laundry.<br />Our dogs are Great Pyrenees and Border Collie.

review/summary: An innovative invention much appreciated by canines
review/text: with the exception of my senior chihuahua that viewed the container of Lickety Stik as possibly a lethal weapon and, not wishing to take any chances, tore out of the room when she saw it for under-the-bed protection.<br /><br />"Oh well," I said, "I've got three other dogs.  Let's try them."  At first my toy bichon-poodle was also wary and stepped back.  But when she saw my shepherd and chow chow growing very excited and thrilled by this new offering, she relented and tasted some herself.  It was a decided hit.<br /><br />There are no directions on the small plastic container as to how to use, so I was uncertain if I should squeeze it and, if so, how tightly.  I quickly learned that squeezing it too firmly causes the liquid to pour out so, if squeezed, "lightly" should be the watchword.  I would advise the first time trying it to place a paper towel under the container until one gets the hang of manipulating the small plastic bottle and administering the treat to the dog(s), which will not be a problem as my two large dogs, and eventually the smaller one, just kept wanting to lick and lick and keep on licking.  They found this new-found gadget to be very exciting.<br /><br />What is most appealing about it to me is that it contains all natural ingredients - nothing artificial.  They consist of natural flavors, cultured milk, lecithin, rosemary extract and green tea extract.  It also contains Vitamin A.<br /><br />So this is a fun way to make your dog(s) happy, small enough to carry in your pocket, light enough for easy carrying.  Now I've only used it once, but I predict that the next time my dogs (chihuahua excepted) see me holding the by now familiar container, there'll be a stampede of sorts.  Just like in television commercials.<br /><br />Tail waggin' good!

review/text: Do you know those Tootsie Pop commercials where they'd see how many times the Tootsie Pop could be licked before they'd chew right into it?  That's how this Likety Stik worked with my dog.  He licked it three or four times, then immediately wanted to chew on the roller.  I repeatedly pulled it out each time he'd try, but it kept repeating.  Lick, lick, lick, chew.  Lick, lick, lick chew.  Within one minute, no exaggerating, he had chewed off the end and I was scared to death that he'd swallow the roll ball. Fortunately he spit it out, but if he had swallowed it, he easily could have choked to death on it with it blocking his windpipe.  I would never buy this product again, and highly recommend others not to.  Seriously, it was completely chewed through in one minute of opening the package.

review/summary: Fun Idea
review/text: This is a nice idea for a low calorie dog treat.<br /><br />It looks just like a roll-on antiperspirant, and you have to roll the ball to get it going. One problem is that this is a syrup or other liquid that is pretty sticky and I usually have to get the ball rolling myself each time. Also, once I offer it to my dogs they can get one lick but cannot get the ball moving.<br /><br />The other problem I've had is my dogs want to take the whole thing, not just lick the surface of it. They seem to like the taste because they really grab the whole thing.<br /><br />I think it's a fun idea and it does seem to taste great to them, though I wouldn't really recommend it because of the ball being hard for dogs to roll.

review/summary: Dog was a fan, but I wasn't
review/text: I have a 60lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix who loves all sorts of treats so I'm always on the lookout for new products. Unfortunately, many doggie treats have gotten a bit pricey these days if you plan on giving them a helping. When the PetSafe Lickety Stik (essentially the same design as a roll-on deodorant) popped up on Amazon Vine I naturally snatched one up right away. Here are my thoughts;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Low in calories, 1 per 10 licks.<br /><br />+ My dog loved them.<br /><br />+ Container has a re-sealable cap.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Fluid can drip out of roller ball and leave a sticky residue on surfaces.<br /><br />- Container is not really pet safe if the dog gets ahold of the treat.  Most dogs could easily chew apart the package and choke on the roller ball.<br /><br />- Doesn't promote healthy chewing, essential for a dog's teeth.<br /><br />- Small container is not good for bigger or messier dogs.  My dog licked not just the roller ball but the handle itself including my fingers.<br /><br />- Smells absolutely awful.<br /><br />My dog loved the Lickety Stik (although he's not terribly picky about treats) and the product allowed me to stop his treat giving at any time. Sadly, he doesn't get any dental benefit from ingesting this treat. Better suited for smaller dogs who won't slobber all over trying to lick out the fluid.  Still, I wouldn't pay the asking price for the item. The best thing about this treat was they occupied my dog long enough to groom him sufficiently.

review/summary: Potentially messy but my dog loves it.
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:01 Mins<br /><br /></span>Lickety Stik is a lickable (vs. edible) dog treat that comes in a variety of flavors, such as bacon, liver and chicken.  The container looks something like an old-style stick of deordorant with a plastic ball under the cap that LOOKS like it would roll around, but is actually stationary.  You squeeze the bottle until the gravy-like liquid treat starts to ooze out AROUND the ball and the dog licks it off. If you're not careful (i.e., if you squeeze too hard, esp. if you are treating a small dog like mine), you could end up with a mess on the floor.  That said, it is not difficult to master how hard to squeeze to treat the dog...just be forewarned to squeeze gently until you find the right pressure to use.<br /><br />As you will see in the accompanying video, my dog adores the flavor (I was using the liver flavor Lickety Split in the video).  She whines for it sometimes several times a day (she knows where I keep it).  However, she has a sensitive stomach and I have had to switch over to predominantly allergy-formula food and treats to reduce (and almost eliminate) the frequency of her spit-ups.  The day after I gave her the first taste of Lickety Stik, she spit up for the first time in a few months.  Perhaps that had nothing to do with it and it was something else, but it did make me wary of treating her with this product too often.<br /><br />Note that the packaging says this product is "All-Natural with Vitamins," that there is only "1 calorie in every 10 licks" and that there are "over 500 licks per bottle."  The product is made in the USA.<br /><br />I can see where this product would be an excellent one to use for training purposes or on car trips, when you don't want to have to carry a lot of treats with you.<br /><br />Edited 10/11/11 to add that, after reviewing a couple of other reviews, it appears that the rollerball is SUPPOSED to roll, which was my assumption, but it did not on either of the ones I have used (bacon and liver flavors).  I just opened them up and tried to forcibly roll the ball.  I was able to on one but not the other.  Perhaps it varies by container or perhaps it takes a good while of use before the ball starts rolling.  I've been using it about a week.

review/summary: Rich bacon smell
review/text: This item seems like a great idea...a convenient, and non-messy way to carry treats for the dog.  It is like a roll-on deodorant container...a bottle of fluid with a rolling ball top that brings the fluid up to the top of the ball as it is spun.  It has a rich, bacon smell smell to it and my little dog (7 lb. Maltese) was interested in it, but I couldn't get him to lick it beyond the first tentative taste.  I think that it was the novel delivery that threw him off, not the taste.  I believe that with a larger dog, where one tongue swipe would clear off and refresh the ball, it might be better received.<br /><br />I'm back after trying this with a larger dog with no success.  He just wanted to take the whole thing in his mouth.<br /><br />This seems like a good idea and it might work if you started using it with a puppy as a training device.  Perhaps you could "train" older dogs to use it properly, but it is certainly NOT worth the effort to do that.

review/summary: Our dog's opinions
review/text: We have four smallish house type dogs that rule the roost here, so we thought we'd try this new bacon flavored Lickety Stik product on each of them. Reviews were mixed. A couple of them sniffed a lot, but didn't seem to want to partake. The other two licked gingerly, and would continue to do so as long as we squeezed the plastic bottle, but they didn't seem overly enthusiastic. It seemed to take a lot to squeeze the brown goo out onto the plastic head, actually, and it tended to drip off too much at times before they could lap it up. I think it also was bothersome that the plastic bottle looks a lot like a roller-ball underarm deodorant dispenser. Rather bizarre in a way. One of our sons is always teased about liking bacon so much, so at the latest family night supper he was asked if he wanted some Lickety Stick for his underarms. Everyone laughed. Except the dogs. They were trying to do a serious analysis and review. Anyway, maybe some dogs will like this stuff, but our family voted against buying more for our dogs. It was an interesting experiment, and your mileage may vary.

review/text: I'm always willing to try something new for my dogs, and this sounded like a great idea, a portable no-mess treat delivery system.<br />The flavor I'm reviewing is "Smoky Bacon"<br />I experienced some of the same issues noted by other reviewers. The ball in mine did not roll freely, so once my dog licked it clean, I had to manually advance it with my finger. So much for the "no mess" aspect.<br /> Squeezing the bottle as suggested by a few only results in a glop of foul-smelling liquid oozing out and dripping on the floor.<br />Yes, I said foul-smelling. I know dogs have a somewhat different take from their people on what smells good and what doesn't, but 3 of our 4 dogs recoiled at the smell of the product. Our only "outside" dog would take a lick, then take a sniff of her own rear end...presumably she found the scent similar. If you've ever seen a dog do that, then you know what I mean.<br /><br />I'm also concerned about how sanitary this delivery system is. Between uses you have a ball laden with dog-mouth bacteria multiplying. I doubt rinsing the ball before storage would help much, undoubtably some slobber is going to contaminate the bottle contents during usage. Refrigeration is not suggested on the label but it might help retard bacteria growth between uses.<br /><br />I think this product is another one of those things that sound like a good idea but the execution is flawed. I cannot recommend this product in good faith, and the $7.99 suggested retail price is a little steep for 1.7 fluid ounces of product.

review/summary: Three dogs -- not much interest
review/text: I tried this on three dogs, a border collie, a weiner dog, and a little taco dog. Each one showed an interest in only one of the three flavors, bacon being the top contender (two out of the three), as opposed to the chicken and liver flavors. However, the weiner dog (who has no other known allergies) was clearly allergic to this product -- she sneezed every time she licked it so I gave her no more. She has never sneezed like this before.<br /><br />In summary, with all the treats that are available for dogs these days, even though this one is a low-calorie type, I would pass it by. It seems like a good idea but in actuality, I'm pretty sure that you'll be seeing this product on the sale table at Big Lots before too long.

review/summary: My dog liked it, I didn't.
review/text: I usually try to see the good side of things so I'll start with  - my dog liked the taste.  She is an older dog and it takes a lot to get her excited, this did.  As for me, it's messy, and kind of icky when you think about the dog's saliva being put into the bottle every time you roll the ball top.  The top is a roller ball that is very difficult to turn.  You get your fingers sticky with this strong smelling liquid, and it has to be done repeatedly. You can run it along the counter to turn it, also a bad idea. The dog just gets a taste from the ball, then wants to EAT the bottle which, according to the warning label, is a no no.  No eating the roller ball or the bottle!  If they were to get hold of the ball it could choke the dog.  Bad design if you ask me.  OF COURSE the dog is going to want to bite the bottle if it tastes like bacon juice.<br />  I gave her a couple licks and decided to throw the rest away.  Sorry puppy.

review/summary: Two Out of Three Agree!
review/text: I have three dogs. Two of them loved it, one so much that she tried to swallow the whole bottle, or run away with it and rip into it as she might a bone. They were definitely confused by it, they weren't sure what to do with it, but once they caught the smell of bacon they couldn't get enough. The third wasn't so keen on it, but I feel like that was more because he was abused before we took him in and he doesn't like something being held in front of his face like you have to do with this treat. I did eventually get him to try some, but after one lick he refused anymore, I will attribute this to his fear rather than any misgivings he might've had about taste as he eats everything.<br /><br />I think this would work better if you have just one dog. When you pass out treats or food, sometimes squabbles can happen, and that definitely happens here when you're focus is on just one dog and the others get jealous. Also, dogs generally do prefer to grab their treat then be able to go, take it somewhere and spend some time with it, maybe hide it for later, can't really do that with this.<br /><br />This is also drippy, so be careful or you could end up with a bit of a mess.<br /><br />I'm not sure how well this would work for training though. I would probably stick with regular treats for that, but if anyone can test that, please comment and let us know if it worked!<br /><br />Edit: I noticed that my dogs try to go after pill bottles now because the bottles kind of looks like the tube (have a similar shape) so if you get this, might want to watch out for that.

review/summary: New fun treat
review/text: My dog loves this treat. She loves the taste of it and I like that it lasts a while. Other treats just do not last long with her including rawhides but with the Lickety Stik she gets approx 500 licks. She goes nuts every time I go to twist the top off of it and doesn't stop licking until I finally say that she's had enough. With any dog treat some dogs may not like it but I think it's worth a try to purchase Lickety Stik for your dog at least one time. I have found one problem with this treat which is the roller ball doesn't roll so well sometimes. It gets to one point where my dog licks it and it stops turning which annoys her and annoys me as well because I have to get my hands all messy trying to fix the roller. This is the only gripe I have with this treat but it is also why I deducted one star from the overall review.

review/summary: I question its value
review/text: My two dogs do love this product.  The dumb one found it confusing for only a few seconds, and then began licking it happily.<br /><br />The product is physically similar to roll-on deodorant.  The plastic ball works well, and will last the duration of the product.<br /><br />The product doesn't last very long in my experience.  Because the dog is not getting anything to chew, and you are not reaching into a bag of treats, I think most will see a tendency to let the dog get several good licks in.<br /><br />If you're very interested in weight loss without loosing rewards, I suppose this is a clever solution.  Otherwise, this simply is not the best value compared to many other options.

review/summary: My dog loves the taste.
review/text: I'm not sure exactly what this product is meant to be used for.  I would think it would be great to take on walks for a quick reward.  Just whip it out of your pocket and give your dog a lick.  No where on the product did I see the shelf life or how to store it.  I'm assuming it does not need to be refrigerated.  It looks just like a roll-on deodorant bottle.  It's just liver flavored gravy in a deodorant bottle. It's dispensed when the dog licks the ball.  I got the liver flavor. I don't see this lasting very long.  It's a small bottle.  There is a little "window" at the bottom of the bottle so you can see when it's almost empty.<br /><br />I could see these being used for treats in training.  "Chester" says it's great!

review/summary: great idea, but the roller ball is hard to roll
review/text: I only have i bottle (bacon flavor), so I don't know if it is typical, but the ball does not roll easily.  My dogs can get the liquid treat, but only if I squeeze the tube a bit.  And they aren't small dogs with weak tongues.  They are a Border Collie and a Labrador Retriever.  They do enjoy the treat, thought the Border Collie is not overly enthusiastic.  The Lab is enthusiastic about anything edible, even remotely, edible.  A bit messy as it drips a little when I squeeze it, but then it's not meant to have to be squeezed.  I will check other reviews and if my hard-to-move roller ball is the exception, I will be ordering more of this handy, portable treat which is easy to keep mess-free in a pocket.

review/summary: The dog likes it, but not over other treats
review/text: Who would have thought that putting stinky smelling liquid dog snack in a deodorant roller ball container would be a good idea - although I have to admit, it's a pretty good idea!  It took my dog about 2 seconds to figure out how to use this thing...just point it at your dog and let them do the licking.  Our dog liked it enough, but when giving the opportunity to either lick this, or eat a liver Bil*Jac, he went for the item that required chewing (albeit only a little chewing).  It works well enough for a quick treat, although I think that in training, it's better and (and faster) to toss my dog a small training treat instead of having to uncap and let him lick the Lickety Stik.<br /><br />On a side note, this stuff smells *really* bad (aka, your dog will like it).  I can't imagine the stench come out anytime soon, should a dog decide to rip it open on a carpet or if it leaked in a car...

review/summary: My Dogs Love It!
review/text: Lickety Stik is an all-natural dog treat that comes in a deodorant-like container with a roller ball on top.  The idea is when your dog wants a treat, you give him a few licks of this lo-cal product instead of something more fattening.  Ten licks = 1 calorie.  I wasn't sure what to think about this product at first--great idea or somewhat odd?  My dogs made the decision for me:  they love it!  In fact, when I picked up the bottle to write this review, they both came running.<br /><br />I think Lickety Stik would be especially useful if your dog is on a diet, or when you're training and don't want to give too many high-calorie treats.  This is a winner at our house.

review/text: I got this thinking my chubby lil dog might benifit from a treat that was tasty but didn't add extra lbs. She's very picky  and I wasn't sure she would take to the new style treat. She loved the Bacon flavor and the hands on attention she got while I held the bottle. Our other dogs loved the  treat as well, the only downside of the treat is that u have to hold the bottle and squeeze it gently for the dog. And one can't be.shared one dog always wants to be first.

review/summary: Dogs are undecided!
review/text: I didn't know quite what to think about this dog treat & neither did our Bichon, Biscuit, or our golden Retriever, DJ.  It is exactly like a roller ball on a deodorant bottle.  The dogs have to lick and roll the ball to get the flavor or treat.  DJ finally caught on though it took several licks to get the flavor flowing.  Biscuit still hasn't gotten the hang of licking to roll the ball.  Instead of licking the ball he tries to chew it.  He would get very frustrated when he would get a taste of the gravy, but couldn't lick hard enough to turn the ball.  He finally gave up on it & asked for another kind of treat.  DJ loves it but thought only 20 or so licks wasn't enough & also asked for something more substantial.  I guess it would be good as a treat when training a dog to do tricks or potty train.  It would be a nice reinforcement.  I also like giving the dogs a treat to keep them busy for a while, but this treat takes up my time, as I have to hold it.  I will stick to buying biscuits or other type treats.

review/summary: Gus Says: Two Paws Down
review/text: Maybe my doggie is just not smart enough for this product?? I'm not sure. It comes packaged like "Tussy" Deodorant from the old days. You roll it around and the flavor is on the ball and as your dog licks it, the flavor keeps returning. Ok, what did MY dog do? Try to take the whole bottle. No way was he going to just "lick" it... he wanted the container. I obviously couldn't give him the whole thing because he would chew it and the liquid would squirt all over. Very strange "treat". If your dog is used to taking treats from you and chewing them up, getting them to just lick might be a trick. Not for Gus.

review/summary: Lickety Stick; the lickable dog treat (just a bit odd)
review/text: My sister tried these out with one of her  dogs.  She says:<br /><br />I gave the stick a try with our small rat terrier mix, Nellie.  At first I couldn't figure out how to open it the bottle.  It looked like you pealed the wrapper off the lid area, but it wasn't coming.  Then I could see the faint perforated line around the base of the cap and you twist to break that, like a salad dressing bottle.  The stick itself is like a deodorant roll-on. Seriously.  The instructions say to shake it up before offering.  This stick was a "chicken flavor".  I offered it to Nellie, who could tell it smelled good and she tried to nibble around the roll-on top not knowing what to do.  I kind of squeezed the bottle and it made the roll-on get flavored.  She then had fun licking it and she seemed to like the stuff.  She's not very picky, so I figured she would.  The smell is not that great.  You can kind of smell it when offering it to the dog.  If you put it up close to you, it is strong, so I just kept it down at dog level.<br /><br />This is a very odd way to give a treat to a dog. But, I don't think Nellie noticed, she was too busy enjoying it.

review/summary: The dogs love them; I'm not quite as thrilled...
review/text: The dogs like the Lickety Stiks, no question about it.  After one brief attempt to just bite it, the 3-year-old settled in to licking, and the the 11-year-old understood the idea from the start (to be fair, they are both experienced with the concept of licking ice cream and the 'lick it!' reminder may have helped).  I am sure if the Stiks were left in reach, they would quickly chew into them and make a mess, so that's something of which to be careful. They did not drip when held upside down, which was pleasing.<br /><br />I am fortunate that neither of our dogs are overweight or have weight concerns; owners with chubby dogs expressed extensive enthusiasm when I asked them about the Stiks.  The younger dog is not a huge treat hound -- he can often 'take it or leave it,' and these proved no different.  I keep hoping to find the motivator that he just can't walk away from.  The Stiks didn't prove to be his Achilles heel but they are in excellent company in that regard -- both dogs clearly found them palatable and enjoyable.<br /><br />My primary use of treats is in training, and my main quibble with the Stiks is that it is hard to use them to lure... you know how you have a treat in your hand and you allow the dog to nose it but not take it while you lure them?  You can't really do that with these.  They also wouldn't be good when set on a target, as a chunk of bait is. Also, the licks of the rollerball take time, while a small, soft chunk of cheese or liver can be gulped down without any noticeable delay in the action.<br /><br />I found all three 'flavors' to be rather unpleasantly smelly -- I think the manufacturer could maybe dial back the scent and still have plenty of appeal to the dogs.  They were also kind of sticky and did leave a smear if one accidentally brushed the roller-ball dispenser across any surfaces while wielding it.  Our newest vehicle has terribly inappropriate light-colored upholstery (what were we thinking?) and the commercials for the Stiks that talk about keeping one in the car made me cringe -- I would not want these anywhere near light-colored textiles!<br /><br />I'm glad to have tried these but I don't know that I will make a point to purchase them in the future, especially at the current price point.

review/summary: Excellent training treat!
review/text: The main thing I love about this product is that its so good for use during training.  It's so much easier to carry on walks than a bag full of chopped hot dogs or dog treats.  Plus licking has been shown to have a calming effect on dogs which could make this product helpful for reactive dogs.  I like that the ingredients are all natural and there are no "iffy" ingredients.  To top it off my picky raw fed dogs love this stuff.  I'm keeping it as a training treat only to keep it special for them.  I would definitely recommend this product and plan on buying lots more!<br /><br />ETA:  I would caution against using this with totally unruly dogs.  If you think your dog would rip it out of your hand and chew it up enough to dislodge the ball I would not use this product as the ball *could* be a choking hazard.  I have pit bulls and they could tear this container apart in 2 seconds flat but they are well trained so I know they wouldn't. I would also caution against leaving it laying around where an unsupervised dog could get at it for the same reason.  But I think the benefits to this product far outweigh the potential dangers as long as your careful about it.

review/summary: A wonderful treat for dogs!
review/text: I recently got PetSafe Lickety Stik for my dog, and she loves it!  The product consists of a bottle filled with a flavored liquid, and whenever Tiny wants some all I have to do do is shake the bottle, remove the cap, and let her lick at the roller until she's satisfied.  There are times when she tries to bite the bottle, but I usually solve that by completely upending it so that she can't get her mouth around it.<br /><br />All in all, if you want a treat for your dog that's low on messiness as well as being something that they'll enjoy, then PetSafe Lickety Stik is a good one.

review/summary: May be best as a leash training aid
review/text: These treats are certainly a new and different idea, but ease of use needs to be improved before they can become something we'd purchase on a regular basis.<br /><br />Certainly, the concept is clever and has potential. The treats are liquid, contained in a tube with a roller ball at the top. The pet licks the ball and gets a measured dose, so to speak. But the problems begin right there.<br /><br />First, the two dogs (one medium, one large) both want to eat the tube rather than lick it, and getting the "lick but don't bite" idea across has proved a challenge. Second, you can give them one treat and then it seems the roller ball has to rotate to dispense the next treat. How do you do this? You can rotate the ball by hand, which is inconvenient and often messy. Or you can squeeze the tube and hope to get the pressure right and not spray the liquid on the ground.<br /><br />We plan on trying this as a leash training aid, a quick reward for proper behavior. The product seems ideal at least in theory for that purpose. Maybe we'll learn to use it better, but right now, it's a little more trouble than it's worth.<br /><br />By the way: We had three flavors. The dogs didn't distinguish among them so unless you have a finicky pet, choice of flavor may not matter.

review/summary: Rocky and Mr. Peabody love it! They said "Woof!"
review/text: The Bacon Flavor Lickety Stik is like crack cocaine for my dog Rocky. If I handed him the product, it would be gone--plastic and all--within 30 seconds. However, you aren't supposed to "give" your dog the Lickety Stick, which works like a roll-on deodorant, the human holds it while the dog licks it. If your dog reacts like Rocky, you'll get a big kick out of it. While the novelty won't wear off for Rocky, I have the distinct impression that I'll get bored with it after a while.<br /><br />On the other paw, Mr. Peabody seemed to enjoy it, but he wasn't as enthusiastic as Rocky. Could it be their difference in age? Mr. P. is six years old and Rocky is one. Rocky also eats everything, including light bulbs, styptic powder, and prescription eyewear, but not with as much vigor as he attacked his Lickety Stik.<br /><br />Our third dog, Charity, sniffed it, looked at me like I had serious issues, and turned away. She's seven. Based on Rocky's & Mr. P.'s enjoyment of the product, I give it five stars; but if Charity was an "only dog," it would get none.

review/summary: Hilariously awesome product!
review/text: I didn't really know what I was getting when I chose to receive this product, but I love getting my dog new things. I thought it was really funny when I opened it- it looked like a roller-style deodorant! But I tilted the product to get the juice by the roller-ball and let my dog lick it. She loved it and caught on very fast!<br /><br />If you're looking for a treat you can give to your dog and then walk away, this isn't the one. You have to hold it so that he/she can lick it; they cannot eat the plastic part. I think it's a great treat for training. It's easy to carry around and "operate" (uncap, tilt, hold in front of dog). I'm using it to teach my dog simple things...she's learning to stay right now, and so I tell her to sit, I walk away, and when I let her come to me, she gets a few licks. It works like a charm!<br /><br />Of course there's the chance that your dog may not like the flavor or might try to chew the bottle instead of licking it. If you're lucky enough to have a dog that likes it/licks it instead of chewing it, it's a great treat to add to the mix! It's something different and new!

review/summary: dogs love it
review/text: The lickety stick is not a lollipop.  It is a roller that looks similar to roll on deodorant or shoe polish.  Inside is the flavored juice.  When the dog's tongue licks the roller, the juice coats it and the dog gets a taste.  I was sent the liver flavor.  One of my dogs loved it.  He was slow at first, but once the roller got coated with the flavored juice, he just went at it.  He even tried biting it. I had a hard time getting it away from him.  My other dog was afraid of it.  I think he thought it was medicine.<br />So this is an interesting way to give a dog a treat. Kind of fun to sit there and watch him lick it like a lollipop.  My only complaint is the smell was gross.  The bacon flavor would probably smell better.

review/summary: Pros and cons...
review/text: Pros: Very low-calorie; dogs love the stuff; good for them--nutritious, all-natural.<br /><br />Cons: Stinky; can be hard to get out; you have to stand there squeezing it the whole time (so giving a normal treat is far more convenient); messy. They inevitably drip all over, so you'd better use them over an easy-to-wipe floor, or outside.<br /><br />The way it usually works for me is:<br />*squeeze...squeeze...squeeze*<br />"Where is it?"<br />*liquid starts pouring out; lands on floor because it always comes out on the opposite side of the roller-ball from the dog*<br />With luck, the dogs don't step in it too much, and I can easily go over the area with a damp cloth after pointing out the spots for them to lick up.<br /><br />It's not as "convenient" as they'd have you believe. You don't just squeeze, let the dog lick the coated ball, and recap it. This is liquid, and it's going to make a mess and require cleanup. (To be fair, regular treats can leave behind crumbs, slimy goo, etc., as well.) You can travel with it, sure, but I would sure as heck NEVER use it inside my car. Your hands can obviously still contact the sticky end and require washing, and I never feel right screwing the cap back on without first rinsing and wiping off the sticky end. If you don't make a habit of doing this, I'm certain that eventually you'll wind up in a dripping, oozing, gooey predicament. This may be cleaner for your hands than pieces of something else that may be sticky, slimy, and/or odiferous, but it's hardly the neatest thing in the world.<br /><br />Also..."no delay in presenting?" Hmm. There's typically more of a delay in waiting for the liquid to start dripping out, with the dog sniffing at it and waiting, than there is in fumbling with a treat bag in your pocket. Either way, they know what's coming to them, but speed is not really an advantage of this product.<br /><br />The very concept should make it excellent for training, especially, because that can run you through your allotted treats very quickly. Dogs really can lick as much of this stuff as they want at any given time...one lick is hardly ever enough, but always appreciated. I normally wind up squeezing every few seconds for about 30-45 seconds, maybe a minute or so. It makes a good diet snack because they get something very flavorful, less filling, and more healthful. However, it's so messy that you'd have to keep it somewhere nearby and out of reach during training, rather than inside your pocket.<br /><br />Of course, they put a positive spin on the necessity of standing there holding and squeezing the tube, saying that the administration of this treat provides a bonding time and reinforces to the dog the source of his/her treats. Well, okay. I can't call that untrue, although it is rather unnecessary for anyone whom has as strong a relationship with his/her dog(s) as I do with mine. And they are all definitely well aware of me as a provider (or slave, in the opinion of the dog with the catlike mindset.) You should see them make firm eye contact, then look back and forth from your face to the treat cabinet or room, pointing you in the desired direction! Don't get me wrong, though; it is usually pleasant to stay close to your pet, giving him/her continuous drops of scrumptious meat-flavored liquid as he/she focuses intently on that ball--instead of simply watching them snatch a traditional treat and devour it wherever they feel like at the moment.<br /><br />A marginal amount of bonding may occur while you hold onto this thing for a couple of minutes and the dog laps at the putrid-smelling goo, obviously mocking you for your deficient senses of smell and taste.<br /><br />I tried out the three-pack of liver, chicken, and bacon for my three dogs as stocking stuffers this past Christmas, and we've still got a little bit of bacon and liver left. They obviously last a decent amount of time. I wouldn't be averse to buying them again if I saw them at a fair price in a store, and was looking for a small-portion, different type of dog treat.<br /><br />I haven't used them yet as a "distraction" or "soothing" technique; I suppose this might work, although you'd clearly need someone else to administer the stick while you did the grooming or whatever you were trying to do. And I wouldn't necessarily expect a dog to keep still just because s/he was licking...not my nutters, anyway. But, it's an idea, at any rate. It might well be a good anxiety-reducing distraction. They do get pretty excited over it, so depending upon the situation, it just might have that power.<br /><br />Edit: I'm sorry, but I had to lower the rating to two stars. You're far better off dripping the tasty, low-calorie liquid onto a hard surface and letting the dog lick it up. It should be sold as a kibble gravy or something to pour into a tiny bowl, rather than as a "Lickety Stick."<br />These things really do just splatter all over the floor/ground whilst taller dogs lick SOME liquid from the ball, and shorter ones risk being hit with falling droplets. It's a good idea, but perhaps the substance needs to be thicker, or it needs to pour out neatly into a little tray, or something. Some dogs are better at catching it all before it falls, but height differences make it tricky to try and let two of them share one, if they're both willing. You can do one in each hand, sure, but of course that doubles the mess. The secret, really, is to squeeze slowly and gently, watch for where it starts to emerge, and rotate the ball so that the dog can lick it before it slides around the ball and falls.<br /><br />I somewhat doubt my likelihood to recommend or re-purchase Lickety Stiks, unless they come out with a particularly interesting new flavor, or improve the stuff itself. Furthermore, my dogs have actually begun shrinking away and ignoring them, obviously mistaking the sticks for their tubes of tooth-cleaning gel and spray--not the product's fault, naturally, but still a newly noted disadvantage worth mentioning.

review/summary: Strange Dog Treat
review/text: This is the strangest thing I've ever seen.  Imagine your roll on deodorant container  being filled with some bacon flavored  gravy and then allowing your dog to lick from it for his daily treat!  Are you kidding me?  This idea is gross and unsanitary and how do you get a dog to understand the concept that they are only supposed to take a few licks and that's their treat.  My dog kept trying to grab the container, she thought I was trying to tease her with it.  Finally I started rolling it on the dry milk bone type treats that she's not crazy about to get her to eat them.  If they called it "Dog Bone Icing" it might sell better  and make more sense.

review/summary: Mostly a product without a purpose
review/text: This might be handy for someone who wants a convenient, pocket-able, quick treat in a training situation, but otherwise I fail to see the point of this product.  Although it's low in calories, it's easier and cheaper just to use a few of the dog's kibbles for treats, subtracting them from the dinner allotment if calorie count is an issue.  If your pet doesn't eat kibble but you still want to give treats, I don't think this offers anything that any other tiny treat doesn't offer.  It's actually less convenient to hold the Lickety Stik for your dog to lick than it is to just toss a treat.<br /><br />Also, the first ingredient listed (this is the Savory Chicken flavor) is "natural chicken flavor."  Do a little reading and you'll quickly realize this doesn't necessarily mean an actual chicken was involved anywhere in this product.  Aside from that there is cultured lecithin (I have no idea what the "cultured" modifier means in this context), vitamins E and C, rosemary extract, and green tea extract.  None of this sounds harmful, but none of it sounds particularly nutritionally helpful, either.<br /><br />As far as dogs' opinions, we had an even split at my house.  Both dogs thought it smelled good and eagerly licked it initially.  One dog has not only refused it since that first taste, but actually pulls back from it when it's offered (and this is a dog that eats anything -- animal, vegetable, mineral, paper towel, cardboard...).  The other is happy to lick from it until I take it away.  I'll probably let her continue to use it until it's gone, but I don't see myself adding more of it to my pet-treat cupboard.

review/summary: Phew! We called it "Icky Stik" or "Stinky Stik"
review/text: As much as our dogs enjoyed Lickety Stik, the cloying stench of "savory chicken" repulsed the rest of the family. The odor wafted off the stick and filled the room like a musky air freshener. We called it "Icky Stik" or "Stinky Stik" as the experience was so nauseating that no one volunteered to reopen the stick, despite pleas from our dogs.<br /><br />We tested the PetSafe Lickety Stik as part of the Amazon Vine program, which is to say the product arrived free. The company sent us the Savory Chicken flavor and we tested it with our Cockapoo and Miniature Schnauzer, both adult females. Neither dog had trouble figuring out how to advance the roller ball so they could taste the liquid. One warning: if you get this stuff on your hands you'll play heck trying to wash it off.<br /><br />A collective shudder ran through the family as we wondered: if Savory Chicken smells this bad, can you imagine inhaling a deep whiff of "Braised Liver" or "Smoky Bacon"? Worse yet, the company touts the product's portability and recommends carrying it in your purse. That's a bit risk since this stuff in the bottle is hardly perfume.<br /><br />The company says Lickety Stick consists of all-natural ingredients. Here's the list from the bottle: Natural Chicken Flavors, Cultured Milk Lecithin, Mixed Tocopherois (Natural Preservative - A Source of Vitamin E), Ascorbyl Palmtate (Source of Vitamin C), Rosemary Extract, Green Tea Extract.<br /><br />In summary, with so many better options available for dog treats, we cannot recommend Lickety Stick because of its foul smell, sticky ingredients and the serious risk to your purse should the bottle leak.<br /><br />Rating: One star.
