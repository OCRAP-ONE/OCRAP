review/summary: Excellent product!
review/text: I'm always amazed at how one company can constantly come up with different things to sell through their different subsidiaries but they're scored a touchdown on this product!  It is in bits, NOT a pate, and my Persian male just cannot get enough of the stuff!  Although a bit pricey, I did have a coupon and well, looks like he's hooked.  He likes it over the Fancy Feast brand (another Purina brand) and just gobbles it up as soon as it's in the bowl.  Great, great stuff, highly recommend!

review/summary: Soggy and STALE!
review/text: I was so excited about these Keebler Animal crackers, thought they would be great for Halloween treats and then my kids could finish the rest. Keebler Animal crackers are really quite delicious! BUT these are so stale and soggy that they can't be eaten! Worst of all you can't even read the code on the box or any of the bags so I have no idea if they are old or if the quality is inferior. SO steer clear of these crackers and buy something else! (I wanted to give them NO stars but that option does not seem available!)

review/text: The cookies are great.  However, when I opened the box, I counted them.  There were supposed to be 150 bags, and there was only 147.  That was no big deal, but, if Keebler (where I assume the cookies come directly and not thru Amazon) is short-changing everyone 3 bags, they are making a lot more profit than they should be.

review/text: I tried this granola (and the original version, see my comments on that page) before I found out it was available on Amazon, and I signed up immediately for auto-delivery every month. I eat granola for breakfast and sometimes snacks or dessert, and this beats every blueberry granola I've tried.  There's lots of berries, and I don't know how they make them so juicy and full of flavor, but this stuff rocks.  It's super fresh, toasty and not too sweet. I love this flavor in a parfait made with unsweetened Greek yogurt - no guilt!

review/summary: A SUPER HEALTHY VERSATILE FOOD
review/text: I've eaten Kasha all my life and I'm 66 years old. We always had it as a breakfast cereal and many times for dinner cooked with onions and chicken broth; on many occasions we added pasta bowties. Today I am a diabetic and kasha is a life saver because it is the only grain cereal I can eat a nice big bowl of and it doesn't 'jack up' my blood sugar and it has a nice glycemic index in that my sugar level remains at a constant level for quite a while and then drops slowly. If I eat oatmeal, cream of wheat, or corn meal mush; my sugar goes above 200 and then drops like a rock after my morning hike. With the same amount of kasha, the level never exceeds 140! Besides the health benefits, it tastes so goooooooooooood!

I've been buying it for several years.<br /><br />If your cat won't eat (if you change their brand of food etc), you can pulverize a little piece of it with your fingers and sprinkle it on their food.<br /><br />I use small pieces of it to lure my cats into doing what I want them to do.  They like this flavor and, sometimes, the liver flavor - I haven't tried the others yet.  It works so well that I can just shake the container and my cats come running.<br /><br />I've been rescuing a few feral cats lately, and I think I'm going to try using this to get them into the cages/carriers.

review/summary: Great Flour for Pizza Crust
review/text: I got the flour in a short amount of time from Amazon and eagerly made a batch of pizza dough from the Caputo website. The pizza was made on a pizza stone, 500 degree oven. The crust was light, crisp and tasty. I could not ask for more. It was easy to stretch out so I did not over work the tender dough. I made it in the morning and then chilled the dough until 2 hours before making the pizza. I am learning about chemistry in the food world, very facinating. Next, I am going to try to add some King Aurthur Pizza dough flavor to the dough mix. I will try out some different recipes for crusts with this great flour to find my favorite one. I am always on the quest for perfection in baking.The 2.2 pound sack will not last long.

I followed the "perfect pizza dough" recipe and was very impressed with the awesome thin - slightly chewy pizza crust I made using dough from this "00" flour. The flour makes a thinner more Naples style crust. This flour rocks compared with standard AP flour. Highly recommened for Naples thin crust pizza's - My pizza crust was similar to a Grimaldi's Brooklyn pizza - ENJOY !!

Dough made with it rolls out easily, unlike dough made typical flour purchased at the grocery store, and it produces a crust that rivals those you eat at pizza restaurants.  My teenage son, who is extremely picky and has always criticized my homemade crusts, is finally happy now.<br /><br />I first heard of "pizza flour" when a newspaper article recommended using it to make pizza crust, and found this after searching online.<br /><br />Yes, it is pricey, but I just placed an order for the 10 2.2 bags that Amazon offers, which does help some.<br /><br />For pizza connoisseurs on a quest to perfect their homemade pizza pies, this is the flour to use.

General Mills announced in November 2010 it was replacing the can lining in Muir Glen tomato products and would begin using those cans for that year's harvest. It's now a year later, so these cans should be BPA-free.<br /><br />Oh yeah, the tomatoes taste pretty good too! They cost less than the supermarket (especially if you subscribe), and they contain lots of lycopene.

review/summary: Make Your Own Organic Red Sauce At Home!
review/text: Not all fruits and vegetables need to be organic when you buy them, which, if you're like us, is a shopping strategy. That said one vegetable we won't budge on is buying our tomatoes organically and/or from a local farmer that I've spoken with. We were thrilled when our canned Muir Glen tomatoes were lovely enough to help create a succulent red sauce. (This became the foundation for several meals!) Their methods for canning allow for a moist, sturdy and flavorful product so kudos to this manufacturer to keep on doing it. Usually the price is pretty fair for organic, which is the only reason we can afford to buy a case at a time and then turn that into lots of meals throughout a fiscal quarter. I hope they'll keep on delivering this quality of product for a reasonable price, and not overstep their bounds like so many organic products have been doing to shoppers lately!

review/summary: Best canned tomatoes around

review/summary: Contains BPA!
review/text: I love Muir Glen tomato products but sadly I had to give them up due to their can liners containing bisphenol A (BPA). I will not feed anymore BPA to my kids! It makes me sick that I fed them with BPA laden baby bottles before I knew better. We already have enough cancer in our family. I don't know why anyone is surprised that BPA acts like a synthetic estrogen therefore an endocrine disrupter--BPA was ORIGINALLY developed in the 1930s as a synthetic estrogen drug for women. Shortly after it was developed, a new synthetic estrogen drug came out (DES) so BPA fell by the wayside until someone figured out it could be used in plastics and can liners to help make them harder.<br /><br />I wrote to Muir Glen (now owned by General Mills) to see if they have any plans to remove BPA from their cans but they did not respond to me. I would be happy to pay a bit more for jarred tomato products if they can't come up with BPA free cans. Or how about tomatoes in cartons or frozen?<br /><br />Please write to the companies that you buy canned tomatoes from and ask for BPA free products. Let me know if anyone finds BPA free tomato products, such as tomato paste, diced tomatoes, whole tomatoes...by responding to this comment--I will get an email.<br /><br />I have young children and I will not feed them anymore BPA!!!

review/summary: Enough BPA in products!
review/text: Muir Glen cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol A. Too bad because this was a great product and was a standard in my household. My initial conversations with them they contradicted this fact, which to me was misleading. General Mills owns Cascadian Farms as well and now I don't buy there either.<br />Now we use BioNature in jars or Pomi products in Tetra Pak cartons. All canned tomato products use BPA and so do many of the lids of jars used in food containment.<br />Now I also just make from scratch which is made simple by chef Andrew Carmellini in Urban Italian. Lydia Bastianich is another favorite chef that deserves mention for simple yet big flavors.<br />Boil, peel, freeze and store. Can manufacturing companies that I corresponded with said they were working on a solution for later this year or next year.

review/text: This blue corn meal was perfect. The quality is great! I would buy from this seller again. My only suggestion - buy multiple bags or you'll regret paying the shipping charges for a tester amount (which is what I did). I also got the sweet potato flour and it was also in perfect shape. I would buy from this seller (except next time - bigger quantity to save on shipping).

review/summary: Excellent Flavor.....Great For Birding, Or For Yourself
review/text: I bought a couple of pounds of this blue corn meal at another online store last year.  (At the time they were a smidgen cheaper, but not anymore). Blue corn meal is both a little more flavorful, as well as ground courser than regular yellow corn meal.  Blue corn meal is derived from genuine blue corn that is still cultivated by native Americans of the southwest.  Its stronger flavor more resembles real corn in a lot of peoples opinion that have never tasted it before.  Most folks that try it come to prefer it over traditional yellow corn.  I originally bought my meal specifically to make various kinds of bird cake.  That is, special breads that I bake specifically to feed to the birds here in New England during the cold winter months.  Though backyard birds tend to flock in great numbers to any kind of bread tossed their way on a cold winter day, it is my opinion that they much prefer the bread made with the courser blue meal.  I barely get some tossed about before they swoop down and it disappears.  I have also used the blue meal for any recipe that calls for regular yellow meal.  I have never run into a person yet that didn't think it was more flavorful, and quite distinctive.<br /><br />As for the Barry Farms brand, I am well familiar with this company, and have bought lots of different dried and powdered products from them for years now.  They not only make a quality product that is always fresh and tasty, but they also carry a seemingly endless line of just about anything that can be dried or powdered.  The blue corn meal is a bargain here on Amazon as long as you order several pounds at once.  In that way it is the cheapest blue meal available here.  And in my opinion, the very best quality as well.<br /><br />Whether you are planning on this blue corn meal to feed to the birds, or for your own consumption, I feel you will very much enjoy the excellent rich taste of this fine meal. I highly recommend the Barry Farms brand if you are one that has tasted the blue meal before and liked it.  And if you haven't ever had it, I recommend you give it a try.  If you enjoy yellow corn meal, I think you will be pleasently suprised...

review/summary: HORRIBLE!! BEWARE! Going OUT OF BUSINESS
review/text: HORRIBLE company with HORRIBLE customer service!!!  Hey everyone be careful when ordering from this company!! Where to begin.... first and just to start with what reputable company runs off of a cell phone that has horrible service let alone a cell phone alone, then when speaking to the one customer service rep (which is horribly rude) and the OWNER ( just as rude) you can barely understand them and they can barely hear you, do to the lack of service there phone has and amongst other things (which in order to make sure this post stays on to warn you I will not mention).  (Hey Barry farms if your going to be out in the woods with no service you should probably invest in a land Line we are in 2010.) Barry farms are phonies they order from other real farms then put there low budget label on it and try to take the credit.  Perfect example of this is when I ordered Blue cornmeal THREE WEEKS ago and still haven't received it...are you kidding me maybe I should order some now for next years dinner...or more like I will pass.  So in brief let me tell you that when I first ordered it on 5/6/10 I spoke to the rep and she insured me that they had it in stock after I made it a point to stress if they had it because originally I was going to order it on amazon and they didn't have any.  The rep said at that time (which was rude so I am sure it was the same one and perhaps the only one) "our supply must have run out for amazon but go to our website and order from us directly".  Without hesitation I went to there horrible website which again must represent who I am dealing with and ordered a large order.  The website says if you order a large order then you get a discount which I DID NOT get and had to call back to question the transaction.  The rep (again very rude) said " oh I don't know what happen, oh did you order from us"..blah blah and muttered a bunch of other nonsense in which I finally got the discount after much wasted time on the phone.  So about a week passes and I call to find out where my order is and call "Barry Farms" RUDE rep picks up and I ask her for the status of my order she says "bulk orders can take up to two weeks and we are only on week one it says that on the website so you should be receiving it by next week" with a super rude attitude and such conviction. So I have no problem taking part of the blame on that by not reading the "term and conditions" which they do not have, it and would take two weeks.  So I wait my two weeks PLUS an additional week and still no sign of my order, or even an email or phone call so I decide to call "Barry Farms" myself. When the customer service rep answered not only does she sound like she is miserable with the few words that got threw, I could not understand her with the lack of service her phone had. I then had to call back hoping she would perhaps climb a tree or go to a place where she can get some service(no luck).  After repeating myself 5 or more times to try to communicate to this person about the status of my order she then tells me again with attitude "your order can take up to two weeks" in which I had to inform her that we are now ON WEEK THREE she then loses the attitude for a second, then tries to give me a story about the owners have problems so no one was putting orders in and blah blah blah.... (that is real NICE.)  Why should I have to hear about there problems I paid for blue cornmeal not three weeks of you having my money and then telling me your problems, and what sort of business's customer service tells their customers company problems.. a REALLY BAD ONE AND ONE THAT IS GOING OUT OF BUSINESS! Spoke to the owner Linda or Lint Barry (since again service was constantly breaking up the call) just as rude, tried to give me some more of her/his problems and that I would have to wait another week which means I now would have to wait FOUR WEEKS and who knows if that is even true.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY WHICH THEY WILL PROBABLY TAKE WHEN THEY GO UNDER AND CANCEL THERE ONE CELL PHONE. ORDER FROM A REAL FARMER/BUSINESS.

review/summary: Poor excuse for an Easter gift
review/text: Hopefully by the time you consider this product, the vendor will have changed their product description and picture so it is clearer than when I mistakenly purchased it.  I tried to work with the vendor but their mailbox was full and I got no response after 4 days.  Fortunately, Amazon's policy and my explanation earned me a refund.<br /><br />When I bought it, the product picture suggested the appearance of foil wrapped Easter eggs.  The description was that is was "Gala mix".  "Gala" means "festive", and the festival was Easter, so I assumed the tin would contain Easter candy.<br /><br />Sadly, "Gala mix" turned out to be a generic mix of sugar free hard candies. We're talking peppermints, root beer, cinnamon, butterscotches - stuff you could easily buy at any grocery or drug store, any day of the year, and for a lot less that what I paid for this tin plus exorbitant shipping.<br /><br />I was willing to pay up to get a nice mix of sugar free Easter candy so I wouldn't have to shop around to find enough sugar free components to make an Easter basket.  The night before Easter, I opened the tin to make my mom's Easter basket, and that's when I found out that the only thing vaguely Easter about this product was the painted tin it was in.  Thankfully between a 24 hour drugstore and a 24 hour supermarket, I was able to get together a small but decent mix to make a basket myself.<br /><br />Blessedly, the time has come and gone when diabetics and people on sugar restricted diets were grateful for ANY sugar free product.  Now there's lots of choices out there.  If you're going to someone's house for Easter and want to bring hard candy as a small thank you gift, this could work.  Still, most people don't associate everyday hard candies with Easter.  More familiar Easter goodies like chocolate eggs, jelly beans, etc are available in sugar free varieties so why not choose those?  It may be a bit more effort, but it will be a lot more thoughtful.

review/summary: If you want dark green color, buy this!
review/text: I purchased this locally and it's awful. I normally use Americolor brand airbrush colors, however I was in need of black and couldn't wait for shipping. This color is really not black at all. Understand, I'm well aware that black food dyes are derived from multiple hues being blended, but the color I mixed myself was more black than this. It truly is a dark, dark hunter green shade. Very disappointing.  Their white is also bad. I shook the contents as directed (like crazy)and the pigments never combined. I got a watery puddle with some white spots. I love KopyKake for their projector, but I'll stick to Americolor or Chefmaster for my airbrush colors.

They are five inches long as I expected, because that's the size I wanted and ordered, but can't be any bigger around than even a pencil and that's a BIG stretch!! WOW, I'm sure disappointed considering the cost ~~ $7 and shipping. Won't be ordering these again.<br />  Of course my dog likes them ok, but wouldn't call them her fav by any means. :(  Will I send them back? Don't know if it's worth the hassle at this point. But I will NOT recommend them either. Because of the size quality and high price compared to so many other products to choose from!  Keep looking is my advice. :)<br />  The other Beefeaters' products I ordered well met my standards. This one was a DUD!!  What's the old saying?  Buyer beware?

review/text: I love Timothy's coffees, orange tea, chai tea, etc... This is first Timothy's product I didn't like.<br /><br />Nothing is more soothing than a cup of hot peppermint tea; it's like a hug from the inside out. I order fresh loose tea leaves from a website I'm probably not supposed to name here. Steeping the loose leaves in a glass teapot with an infuser is a pleasant ritual--but inconvenient for work. So I bought these k-cups to make peppermint tea at my desk.<br /><br />Yuck! What a disappointment. The tea is awfully strong and bitter. I added half again as much water, ice, a little Splenda (my fresh peppermint tea never needs sweetener), and drank it as iced tea, but it still had an edge to it I didn't enjoy.

review/text: Enjoying a hot cup of peppermint tea has long been a pleasurable pastime of mine. Timothy's is my favorite. Almost every evening I sit back and savor its aromatic bliss as I slowly sip this splendid brew. This delightful tea has a natural peppermint fragrance and a smooth, refreshing tang. It is a wonderfully tasting tea!

review/summary: lovely tea!
review/text: It was a mistake to spoil myself with timothy's peppermint k cups. I realized it was a bit too expensive for a college student, but too late. I tried many different kinds of peppermint teas (bigelow, twining's, numi...), but they all tasted watered down and nasty. I have to say this tea is very strong but I love it this way! It smells delicious too!

review/summary: Really great as an iced tea!
review/text: I love freshly brewed iced tea and use my K-Cup coffee maker for this purpose.  I use the smallest setting (the Keurig B70 and the Breville XL700 can make a 4 oz. cup) with a tall glass full of ice.  After some of the ice melts I top it off with more, add a little sugar and I have a perfect glass of Peppermint iced tea.  Try it, it's very refreshing!

review/summary: Excellent Peppermint Tea
review/text: I like my peppermint tea a bit strong, and this tea is wonderful.  Even after making an extra large cup (one large brew and one small brew into a double sized mug) the tea was well flavored and not watered down.  I've noticed the only reviewer who seemed unimpressed by this tea mentioned making Iced tea with it, I drink my peppermint tea hot.  I do admit that I have not tried any other variety of peppermint tea in a Kcup, but I like this one well enough to stick with it.  Now I just have to find Peppermint Coffee in Kcups.

review/text: If you love strong peppermint flavor, this is a great tea!  I was looking for a more balanced blend of tea and peppermint so I simply make a cup of regular tea and a K-cup of Peppermint tea, and it's perfect for me.  That is something that I love about the K-cups, it is really easy to modify the taste to get just what you want!<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Try Gloria Jean's Peppermint Herbal tea instead
review/text: In the larger world, my favorite mint tea is Bigelow's Plantation Mint. Unfortunately, that's not available in the Keurig world. In trying to replicate Plantation Mint, I bought four sample packs of mint options directly from Keurig for testing. Gloria Jean's version is the best of the mints by far.<br /><br />My problem with Timothy's? It has a strong twang up front and a noticeable unpleasant chemical aftertaste that tastes a bit like chewing a mint leaf whole. Even when cut with a LOT of water as iced tea is, it still has a too-sharp quality. I hesitate to add this lest I make myself sound crazy, but it also feels like it's forming a film on my tongue and throat as I swallow. I've tried about a dozen Keurig flavors as iced tea and none of the others make this "film." So try it if you must, but take it from someone who's actually compared... there are better options for mint tea in the Keurig world.<br /><br />To make iced tea easily in a Keurig, you need a very strong glass that won't break when taken from boiling to freezing. (Crate & Barrel's excellent Large Working Glass is the strongest I've found that still looks good.) In a 21-ounce glass, put your sweetener in -- 1.75 teaspoons of Splenda for me, 1.25 t for my husband -- then brew a MEDIUM cup of tea. Add ice to almost fill the glass. The ice will melt easily and will end up to be 1/4 of the total volume. Stir and drink. The quality of your ice matters since the melted part will become at least half the drink.<br /><br />If you'd like to try a flavored iced tea other than mint, my very favorite is GJ's Passion Fruit. It's out of stock, so I can't link to it. Until it's available here, try the close second-place tea: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHDH9Q">Gloria Jean's Coffees, Tea K-Cup, Mango-Flavored Black Tea for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>.

So with my "experience" in the popcorn world I can truthfully say I will always come back to TBM Popcorn.  It's the most healthy popcorn out there on the market and it even taste better then every single microwave variety out there.  I have been eating TBM Popcorn for years, recently they have totally redesigned the bag the tiny popcorn comes in.. WOW!!! It looks classy, elegant, sophisticated AND it even gives you guide lines on how to prepare the product to its best results when popping -Not to mention a little history on the ancient heirloom popcorn.. Well done TBM Popcorn Well done! As an avid popcorn lover I cannot wait to see what your next big move is! Keep up the good work Farmer Gene!

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I ordered a small bag of this to try out as we like popcorn occasionally.  Received it and followed the directions to pop it stovetop.  Lots of kernels left unpopped, but not an overly unacceptable amount.  Sprinkled some salt on it, and tried it.<br /><br />Not only ARE there hulls left on the popcorn, the popped amount is so small that all you can taste are the hulls!  Other reviews stated that this tasted sweeter than normal popcorn, and we have to disagree.  It tasted plain, and the hulls really bothered me.  Harder than normal popped corn, it was very disappointing.<br /><br />I'm very glad that I only ordered a small bag of this, as it will probably get thrown out.  Unacceptable to us and a waste of money.  Everyone's taste may vary, but we'll take normal-sized popcorn for our snacking needs.

review/summary: This flavor is great, but there's something wrong here
review/text: I found this flavor at my local supermarket, 12 cups for $6.99.  I loved it - it has more chocolate flavor than Timothy's Mocha Java; unfortunately, it contains real sugar too so a cup is 60 calories. I recommend using the middle size cup when you make this; the larger size seems to make it too watery.  There will still be product left in the cup when using the middle size, so I cut the top open and either spoon it out or add liquid from the cup of coffee to get all of the chocolate/coffee "syrup."  I add half&half and sometimes a packet of Splenda - you can jazz it up however you like. The pricing here on Amazon has to be a mistake, which is disappointing because I was definitely interested in stashing up on this particular flavor.

review/summary: Mixed review
review/text: This item sells for less than $7.00 dollars at Meijer in Ohio for the same package count. What gives? It does have a nice chocolate flavor but that is because it is more hot chocalate than coffee. If you go down the list of ingredients, you don"t see coffee listed until the eigth or ninth ingredient. So if you need the caffeine in the morning, this isn't the choice for you. It also tells you to brew it on the 6 oz. setting and shake the cup before you load it into the brewer, most likely to insure that you get all the coffee/ cocoa out. I would purchase this again, but not on this site.

review/text: I am not a huge coffee drinker but I need some caffeine every once and a while. This is alright. It does taste like hot chocolate but on the largest cup setting it tastes like chocolate water. The middle setting is alright but I feel it tastes the best on the smallest cup size. Sometime I will mix 2 of the small cups together to get a decent size drink. I am a fan of the Cafe Escapes line as they taste very good and don't make a mess while making. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a small drink!

review/text: I purchased a Keurig machine and several varieties of k cups for my husband for christmas.  The machine is a hit.  Unfortunately, my family's favorite k cups were the hot chocolate and the cafe mocha.  I, like many others, bought them at a much more reasonable price before the holidays, but now cannot find them anywhere in a 50 mile radius of my house.  There are still plenty of varieties of coffee available, but not the cafe mocha.  I have taken to the internet to find them and have had a hard time locating them in stock anywhere.  Check out most of the sellers on Amazon, they don't have it in stock, but will notify you when it becomes available.  I beileve that's called supply and demand.  The reason they're charging so much is because they are the only one's with some in stock.  You have to decide if you really want it bad enough to pay what they are charging.  I'm willing to pay a little more for some until everyone else gets them back in stock.

review/text: I really enjoy deluxe mixed nuts (no peanuts for me!). There are a number of different versions, manufactured by different companies that are good, too. But I tend to return to Planter's (more out of product loyalty, I think, than any qualitative differentiation).<br /><br />Nuts included in the can: cashews (yummy; I cheat and select these out and eat a bunch of them at the same time), pecans (same thing), almonds, filberts, Brazil nuts. The nuts aren't so heavily salted that the taste suffers.<br /><br />I use these both as a snack for myself and as a dish when I have a get together with friends and relatives.  Either way, this works awfully well. So, if you enjoy "deluxe" mixes of nuts, this is a pretty good starting point in your everyday grocery store.

review/summary: Good Nuts---if the price is right
review/text: The nuts are great (when fresh) BUT: is NOT a bargain (at $20 plus shipping, the price at the time of this writting)for two reasons:<br /><br />1) BJ's sells the 40oz Planters Deluxe Mixed Nuts for $12.95, and offers $1 to $2.50 off coupons almost every month---so the real BJ's price is $9.45 to 11.95.  At the time of this writing, Amazon offers 3 10-oz cans of Deluxe Mixed Nuts (the same product) for $10.05 (w free shipping on >$25 orders) which is a much better deal.  For the same about $20 you'd get 6 cans = 60 ozs, which would stay fresh until opened.<br /><br />2) The last half of the container will be stale, unless you eat the entire 40 ounces within about a week.  I repackage the nuts into about 5 1-cup size glass jars with tight tops, and refrigerate.<br /><br />Recommendation: After major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your reciept, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon. When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid. Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it.

Another reviewer seemed to think the "Planters Deluxe Mixed Nuts made with Pure Sea Salt, 2 pound .5 oz Tubs (Pack of 2)" was a better choice, but after you factor in the shipping, they are just over 5 cents an ounce more expensive.<br /><br />Having dealt with the misinformation, Planters just taste better than the rest. I've had Kirkland and the generics, and occasionally (not too often) I get a nut that tastes rancid. Never had that problem with Planters. The cashews are my favorite, generally plump and so delicious looking that it's hard to not have a couple of handfuls and spoil my dinner. I personally don't care if it's sea salt or regular, but the salt in these is just right, enhancing the flavor instead of hiding it. If you put these out at a party, not only will your guests appreciate the quality, but you won't have a bowl of picked over peanuts left when the party is over. You can't go wrong with Planters Deluxe Mixed Nuts, unless of course you pig out - there are a lot of calories in a handful of nuts.

review/summary: Don't buy unless you want mostly almonds
review/text: I have been buying Planters Deluxe mixed nuts for years. They were always more expensive but better quality. I am going to quit buying all planters nuts. The past many times they were mostly almonds. It is going that way with all the brands now but Planters are the worst and I quit buying all their products. Why pay more when you can buy something better cheaper. I say avoid all planters products you cannot see from the outside before you buy them and do not buy any you cannot see like on this site.

review/summary: False and misleading
review/text: The description is FALSE and MISLEADING.  This is NOT 40oz... Compare to Walmart per $0.40 oz price to this at $0.74 per oz.... that is 34 cents per oz MORE than Walmart charges.

review/summary: Tasty mixed nuts
review/text: I have always loved Planters Mixed Nuts but I prefer the ones with the regular salt and not the sea salt.  Although I did order the ones with the regular salt, I got the ones with sea salt, which I hate.  It would seem ridiculous to ship these back so I guess I'm stuck with them.<br /><br />The shipper needs to implement some quality checks.

review/summary: Nuts over Planters nuts!
review/text: I love the taste of the nuts. I like them out of the box as well as mixed in with cooking just about anything.<br />The only down side is that I have to taper my love due to calories: 1 ounce of nuts has 170 calories (130 from fat).<br /><br />In a recent Consumer report I found an interesting statistic on content of Planters Nuts. The following percentages are averages from analysing three containers of Planters nuts.<br />48% of all nuts are peanuts<br />24% of all nuts are almonds<br />15% of all nuts were cashews<br />6% of all nuts were brazil nuts<br />4% of all nuts were hazelnuts<br />3% of all nuts were pecans<br /><br />Note on price: Price compare the price for 2 pack of 32oz Planters nuts. There are several packaging of Planters nuts available, and per ouch price sometimes is better on the smaller container. In general, I noticed that the price on the on this product fluctuates. There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called "Online Price Alert". This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify. If you search on "online price alert" in Google it will be come up at the top. I find this tool to be very helpful.<br /><br />Ali Julia review
