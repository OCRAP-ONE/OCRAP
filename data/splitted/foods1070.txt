review/summary: Made in China (Taiwan)
review/text: When I took the first sip, I thought this tasted great.  It was cool and refreshing with bits of aloe vera pulp in it, which tasted quite good, although an unexpected surprise.  My first inclination was to rate it 5 stars, even though I thought the tea taste was overpowered by the aloe and passion fruit.  However, after a few minutes I found a medicinal after taste taking over that would not go away and ruined it for me.<br /><br />While this sounds like it would be a healthy drink (and it does have some healthy aspects with the green tea and aloe), the main ingredient after water is cane sugar.  The bottle is 11.5 fluid ounces and contains 120 calories, which they call 1.5 servings.  This is still a healthier drink than sodas, and I didn't think it had an overpowering sweet taste. However, at a little over $2.00 per bottle, it is more than I would want to pay for this sugar laden drink no matter how healthy it might be otherwise, especially with the aftertaste.

review/summary: Bottle with a Bite
review/text: The Chantea tea mixture is a refreshing cold tea with a unique flavor. Fusing green tea with aloe vera produces a healthy beverage that is excellent cold and may be equally tasty when warmed. The passion fruit added to the mix brings a citrus note to the tea while the pulp gives an unexpected texture. The astringency of the drink is relatively high, giving it a bitter mouth feel that makes each sip enjoyable.

review/summary: Nice flavors, not too sweet.  But good for you?
review/text: INGREDIENTS<br /><br />water, cane sugar, green tea infusion, aloe vera, citric acid, natural passion fruit flavor<br /><br />TASTE<br /><br />Though cane sugar is its second ingredient (after water), this beverage does NOT seem TOO sweet, as many do, to me. The pleasant passion fruit flavor comes through second to sugar, and I can taste the green tea after that. The citric acid probably cuts some of the sugar and brightens the passion fruit flavor. I don't know what aloe vera tastes like by itself, so I don't know if its taste is in there.<br /><br />TEXTURE<br /><br />It says natural passion fruit flavor, but there are also bits of something in the drink that are probably passion fruit bits. It is about the same viscosity as lemonade otherwise, that is, slightly thicker than plain tea.<br /><br />HEALTH CONSIDERATIONS<br /><br />At 80 calories per serving, it is not as fattening as most soft drinks, yet it is also not a low-calorie drink. The label says it is not a significant source of vitamins.<br /><br />The tea should provide a mild caffeine lift, but I didn't especially notice it, perhaps because I had it in the afternoon, and coffee in the morning. Green tea is said to have an antioxidant effect as well as other health benefits.<br /><br />The most interesting ingredient then is the aloe vera. If you read the description, it refers to unspecified health benefits from the aloe vera. Searching the Web, I found "general well-being" as a health benefit, as well as being a cure for cancer, for diabetes, a miracle cure, and so on. Wikipedia says scientific evidence on the benefits of aloe vera is limited, and that Aloin, found in some species, was used in some over-the-counter laxatives until 2003, when the US FDA banned its use.<br /><br />I have found aloe gel to be effective for easing the discomfort of sunburn (especially when refrigerated!), but without scientific evidence of its benefits when taken internally, I am unlikely to want to ingest it for unspecified and sometimes contradictory health benefits found on many Web sites.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br /><br />I am unlikely to buy this product. If there is any value of aloe in the beverage, it is not specified by the manufacturer, or substantiated in trusted publications. The fruit is somewhat pleasant, but it is processed to the point of not providing any vitamins.  And I prefer my tea plain and unsweetened; I don't need the sugar.<br /><br />For those who seek aloe vera as a health enhancement, this drink does not give any indication of how much is in it, or what kind of processing it has experienced, and hence whether it has any value to you. I think you're better off getting fresh aloe vera (growing it, or buy it in some Asian groceries) and extracting it yourself. But read some authoritative sources, or ask your doctor, before you get carried away with it.

review/summary: a pleasant, refreshing, and delicious surprise
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this drink.<br /><br />It's refreshing, smooth, and tasty. The tea contains pulp from passion fruit that add oomph to the green and aloe vera coolness and smoothness of the drink.<br /><br />Despite 19 g of sugar for every 1 cup (8 fl oz), the drink manages not too feel unbearably sweet.<br /><br />The remaining nutritional facts for 1 cup (8 fl oz) are as follows:<br />calories 80<br />total fat 0<br />sodium 38 mg<br />total carbs 20g<br />protein 0 g<br /><br />There is a disclaimer about it being not a significant source of saturated fat, cholesterol, dietary fiber, vitamins A and D, calcium, and/or iron.<br /><br />For those interested, the ingredients are; water, cane sugar, green tea infusion (green tea leaves and water), aloe vera, citric acid, natural passion fruit flavor.<br /><br />Bonus: The drink comes in a sleek container that offers a good grip on the plastic bottle.<br /><br />My only complaint, if I had to give one? At 340 ml (11.5 fl oz), there wasn't enough of the product! The bottle says to refrigerate after opening, but I am willing to bet that won't be necessary - it's too delicious to stop drinking!

review/summary: 28.5 grams of Sugar per Bottle
review/text: Let me first start off expressing my likes and then move onto my dislikes.<br /><br />Pros: This reminds me of a few fountain drinks I had in Europe. The taste is nice, not overly sweet. I like the little bits aloe pulp flowing in the tea. It gives off an interesting texture.<br /><br />Cons: What really bothers me is the sugar content in this Green Tea. It contains 19 grams of sugar per serving x 1.5 servings you are drinking 28.5 grams of sugar, a can of soda has an average of 28 grams of sugar.<br /><br />I dislike products such as this Aloe Vera Green Tea that is made to be disguised as a naturally good beverage to drink yet spike up your insulin levels and suppress your immunity (because we all know that excessive sugar intake does that).<br /><br />Don't be fulled into thinking your acquiring any real health benefit from drinking this. A better alternative would be 100% green tea with a tad of raw honey added and optional lemon slice or juice.

review/summary: Chantea: A Good Product But Not to My Taste
review/text: My first slug of this tea threw me off because it has fruit (or Aloe Vera) bits in it and it stunned me a little bit.  And it seems awfully sweet for a "health" drink, although seeing cane sugar as the second ingredient on the list maybe explains that.<br /><br />Overall I would say this tea is probably pretty good.  I am a believer in Aloe Vera, but I found the taste a little too sweet at first.  After putting the bottle down for a day, putting in the refrigerator, and trying it again, it tasted better.  But I still didn't really like the taste all that much.  It was just a bit too thick and too sweet for tea for me.

review/summary: Aloe-infused drink
review/text: I am a huge fan of healthy products for overall good nutrition. I was intrigued by the Chantea Aloe Vera Green Tea, passion fruit flavor.  Made with cane sugar, water, green tea infusion, aloe vera, citric acid, and natural flavors, it doesn't have any artificial ingredients. With only 19g of sugar per serving, it is a much better choice than high sugary fruit juices or soda. On appearance, it looks peculiar with bits of aloe floating around in the bottle; however, I decided to give it a try.  Surprisingly, it has a fresh taste. Unfortunately, the bits of aloe, while healthy, made me gag. Also, the particles of aloe were stuck in my teeth after swallowing the drink.  I had to rinse my mouth out with water.  For that, I do not recommend this drink.

I did not realize it would be pulpy - didn't read the label carefully enough - and the first mouthful was quite a shock!

review/summary: Not Your Normal Flavored Green Tea
review/text: Long popular in Asia in food for its health-promoting properties and long popular in the US in lotions for its healing properties, aloe vera extracts, or this case pulp, are cropping up in different foods and drinks.  Chantea has produced a nicely flavored, sweetened green tea.  Because this is a Taiwanese company, it makes sense that they are trying to bring aloe vera to the American market.  The passion fruit flavor is quite good.  Suspended in the  tea is aloe vera leaf pulp.  It is reminiscent of orange pulp, and since this is passion fruit flavored, you get the sense of passion fruit pulp.  Aloe vera does not have much of a flavor on its own.  Aloe vera pulp can be on the slimy side (think what would happen of an orange and okra mated), but in this drink it is not at all slimy.<br /> If you want a drink that is clear, you will be in for a shock.<br />If you want a fruit-flavored tea drink that has substance, this is for you.

review/summary: Weird tasting sugar water
review/text: I love green tea.  I love passionfruit drinks.  I really disliked this.  The beverage is essentially sugar water.  It is being marketed as "Aloe Vera Green Tea."  And I have enjoyed aloe drinks in the past.  This is a really cheaply made "aloe vera" product sold with a premium price tag.<br /><br />In general, the order of ingredients indicates the greatest percentage of the product. The ingredient list opens with water, cane sugar, and then "Green Tea Infusion" (green tea leaves and more water).  So I'm assuming they made a batch of green tea, and then diluted it with water before bottling it.  Then there is aloe vera, citric acid, and passionfruit flavor (but no actual passionfruit).<br /><br />The sample I received had pulp in it, but it tastes like orange pulp and not passionfruit.  And there is no indication from the ingredient label if this pulp is even supposed to be in the bottle.  The end result is watered-down weak tasting tea with slightly slimy pulp in it and an artificial citrus taste.  Yuck.<br /><br />Oh, and though a reasonable person would look at the bottle and think it was a single serving, it is labeled as 1 1/2 servings.  So the 80 calories listed on the label?  You should actually think of that as 120 calories because normal people are not going to drink 8 ozs and save the 3.5 ozs for later.

review/text: This Chantea Aloe Vera Green Tea, Passion Fruit was a different and quite delicious refreshment for me. I'd never had any juice drink with passion fruit before. I really enjoyed the delightfully light flavor and even the pulp from the passion fruit was kind of a blast. I tried the bottle I received straightaway, without chilling first, and while it was really good, I got the immediate feeling that this excellent drink would taste really great ice cold, either over ice or after spending adequate time in the fridge. Excellent, refreshing and flavorful. What more could you ask for?

review/summary: Pulpy sweet goodness
review/text: A very fruity tea - bright flavors, loaded with pulp.  I'm not a sweet tea drinker so this was not to my taste but it was not overpowering in sweetness or flavor.  I recently tested Aloe Vera drinks with pulp and fruit chunks so the consistency was not a shock to me, but I'm sure some will be thrown off by the mouth feel and chew associated with this drink.  These chicks were more passion fruit than aloe vera in taste but that might have been due to the blending of ingredients.<br /><br />The cost per bottle seemed a bit high which is why I gave this drink 4 stars.  I think the price should be around $14.00 for an 8 pack.  All in all a good drink.

review/summary: Instant Nausea!
review/text: This is just a strange product. It comes from Taiwan which might explain a difference in taste but not only did the taste not agree with me, it made me instantly quite nauseous. Maybe I had a reaction to the aloe not sure but I really had to work not to be sick from this. The initial taste is not bad but the weird bitter aftertaste was very off putting and burped up for hours. It has lots of shredded aloe floating in it which I really didn't mind texture wise but I suspect the aloe may have been what made me nauseous. This tiny 11.5 ounce bottle is actually almost 1.5 servings. It is very high in sugar almost 30 grams in a bottle. My opinion, there is no good reason to drink this.

The results were mixed: three people absolutely loved it, one hated it, and one thought it was ok.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very sweet concoction, and I really didn't taste much of the green tea aspect of the drink - but you do get a hint of the "Passion Fruit Flavor" aspect, which is probably directly attributable to the amount of sugar in this beverage.

review/text: I just got this iced tea today, and immediately fell in love with it. It is, by far, the best tasting iced tea drink that I ever tried. It is very refreshing and energizing, especially if you (as I did) drink it after a strenuous workout. The little pieces of passion fruit were a bit odd at first, but I quickly got used to them. If anything they give this tea a very fresh taste and unique texture. Overall, very happy with this product and I hope it takes off and becomes popular enough to make it to the local grocery stores. Would be more than happy to buy it on a regular basis.

review/text: I really like green tea and actually am a fan of Asian drinks with pulp inside so I thought Chantea Aloe Vera Green Tea with Passion Fruit would be a great fit for me and it was. I thought the green tea flavor was just right mixed with the passion fruit and the pulp/chunks was not slimy but just the right texture. What did have me a little confused was that I was expecting the pulp/chunks to be Aloe Vera but instead it really seems to taste like passion fruit every time I break one in my mouth. Don't get me wrong, for I don't dislike that I was just a little confused and was not expecting that taste.<br /><br />Would recommended to those who enjoy tea drinks with pulp/chunks on the bottom, especially those who like green tea and passion fruit. It did remind me of young cocoanut juice with pulp, so if you are familiar and enjoyed the pulp sensation on the bottom this drink might just be right for you.

review/summary: Sweet and Pulpy- Not for Everyone!
review/text: I personally like the aloe vera drinks with the pulpy bits of aloe floating around. I know not everyone feels the same, but they are an interesting texture that I don't find unpleasant 9despite hating pulpy orange juice). You can certainly taste the green tea, but the passion fruit is a bit of an after taste rather than an up front flavor palate. Since I don't think aloe vera really has much of a flavor on its own, it is nice to have the other flavors to back it up.<br /><br />This drink is, however, a little too sweet for my particular taste. I prefer other aloe vera drinks that aren't so sweet and instead let the flavors speak for themselves, but if you like a pretty sweet drink with pulpy bits, this is your drink! I am interested in whether or not the other flavors of this brand are as sweet as this one. Not sure I would seek it out to find out, but it would be interesting to compare.

review/summary: Unusual Texture, Good Flavor
review/text: This tea is made in Taiwan, so maybe beverages with this type of texture are an East Asian thing. To my American palate, however, the chunks of passionfruit in this tea drink are rather strange. It's sort of like drinking the juice out of the bottom of a can of fruit cocktail. The directions say to shake it thoroughly before drinking, but even when you do, the fruit chunks don't blend. They're definite chunks, not just pulp. You'd have to run this through a blender to get a smooth consistency similar to a fruit nectar.<br /><br />Maybe fans of bubble tea, who are used to little tapioca bubbles in their beverages, will enjoy this one?<br /><br />That said, the flavor is rather good. It's very sweet, with nice tropical notes. It's not a product you'll want to try if you're trying to cut sugar down from your diet, though; in addition to green tea, aloe vera and passionfruit, it's also made with cane sugar.

review/summary: Tasty But Aloe Vero "Floaties" Put Me Off
review/text: Although I am a big tea drinker, both hot and cold, I don't normally drink green tea as I enjoy a nice black tea taste and have never bought it as a beverage. Therefore I didn't really know what to expect when I got the Chantea Aloe Vera Green Tea - Passion Fruit flavor. However, I was pleasantly surprised - the green tea taste is mild and there is a really nice passion fruit flavor.<br /><br />Now for the big "BUT". The Amazon page says that the bottle contains "real Aloe Vera pulp" which I also assume is infused with passion fruit since if you chew it that's what the taste is. However, I've seen Aloe Vera and it's a succulant and the pulp that's in the bottle looks similar to orange pulp, so maybe its passion fruit - the label doesn't say anything more helpful. There isn't alot of it in the bottle, but the color of the drink combined with the pulp gives the strong impression that something inside went bad (or worse - it gives the impression of looking at pond water with floating bugs and stuff).  Maybe that's why the label is opaque, wraps around the entire bottle, and goes from the base all the way to the neck - the marketers have figured out the public doesn't want to see all that stuff floating around in their drinks.<br /><br />So the drink is actually quite good - I'd probably buy it again just for the taste - but I don't really like anything hard in my drink (which is why I don't but pulpy orange juice) and thus the pulp in the drink is just a little too much to take.

review/summary: A little too sweet  but still fun to drink
review/text: I've only had ALO aloe vera drinks before and I like that taste of them in general. Fruity tea like beverage with the aloe vera bits that make it all worthwhile.  This aloe vera drink in particular reminds me more of the sugar infused tea drinks like Lipton's Citrus Tea or Arizona Tea than something remotely healthy. I mena it's really sweet and I almost suggest watering it down a bit. Other than that it's not bad but I wouldn't drink it for any health benefits.

review/summary: Green Tea infused with Aloe Vera bits
review/text: First off, I really liked the taste.  I found it very refreshing and didn't mind the aloe vera bits in the drink like some in the reviews did.  I try to eat  healthy, but am by no means an authority so believe this product is good for you.  After all, Chantea won the Best New Product Award at the 2011 World Tea Expo.  I don't think it would have won for being bad tasting or unhealthy.<br /><br />I think drinking one a day could be a nice healthy snack.  More satisfying than just drinking water and much better than drinking soda pop.<br /><br />Aloe and green tea are so good for you, sugar in moderation isn't bad.  So all in all, I give this product  5 stars for a great tasting and healthy drink.

review/summary: Light, refreshing taste!
review/text: First off, anyone thinking of buying this should know that there are little slippery chunks of aloe vera floating around in it.  They are hardly even noticeable, but if you didn't know they'd be there I'm sure it would be off-putting.  As for the taste, I really liked it.  It had a light, naturally fruity taste.  I love how fresh the green tea makes the drink.  I even shared it with my young children and they wanted more.  Definitely worth a try - it'd be great for a nice day outside!

review/text: Chantea Aloe Vera Green Tea, Passion Fruit has everything going for taste.  It's sweet, but not overly sweet, with just enough of that green-tea bite and aftertaste to make it interesting even to consumers who like a product that lists 'green tea' on the label to actually maintain some of the characteristics of green tea.  The passion fruit flavor actually tastes like passion fruit, even though it seems to be one of those laboratory-produced 'natural' flavors.  Really, not bad; they got this one right!<br /><br />Chantea has also made the bold decision to include actual pieces of aloe vera in the beverage.  The texture is nice, similar to boba or jelly teas.  Add the colorful packaging and feel of the bottle in your hand, and this is a beverage that is as fun to drink as it is delicious.<br /><br />If you are looking for flavor and fun, you can't go wrong with this tea; however, if you are looking for a healthy drink, you might look elsewhere.  While this is a healthy choice compared to, say, Mountain Dew, it does contain 19 grams of refined sugar and 80 calories per serving.  There are 1.5 servings per bottle, which means if you drink the whole bottle (as I did), you are consuming 28.5 grams of refined sugar and 120 calories.  To someone who drinks a can of soda every day, that's not much; but to someone trying to avoid sugar or cut back on calories, that's a lot!

review/summary: Very good, but a tad to sweet for my taste
review/text: First of all, the ingredients!  The type of sugar used was cane sugar, as opposed to corn syrup, which I think made a difference in the taste.  Sugar just tastes better, and as bad as it is for you, it is better than HFCS!  The first ingredient is water, the second is cane sugar, and the third is green tea.  I would have thought that there would have been more green tea/water than sugar, but that's not the case.  (When I make tea, I use more water than sugar!  There is aloe in it, which is pulpy.  If you don't like pulp, you probably won't like this (I had my sister try it, and that was the only thing she didn't like about it--she gave it a 4.5.)  I don't mind the aloe at all (I like pulp) and it had picked up the passion fruit flavor (which I LOVE by the way)!  The only real problem is caffeine.  It is not mentioned on the bottle anywhere at all whether there is caffeine, and how much there might be.  I cannot drink much caffeine, as it makes my heart race.  So I was afraid to drink the whole bottle (11.5 ounces).  I know green tea naturally contains caffeine.  Passion fruit flavor is wonderful, plus the aloe and the green tea are good for you.<br /><br />All in all this is really good.  I would like to give it a 4.5, but since I can't I am settling for a 4.  And the reasons being no labeling for caffeine and  just a TAD too sweet.  (But great flavor for us passion fruit lovers!)

review/summary: really tastes like passion fruit
review/text: Many passion fruit drinks have only a mild passion fruit flavor, but in this drink, the flavor is pronounced.  Very nice.  The aloe vera pieces in the juice are a nice health addition, those a bit too big.  It feels strange to drink something with such large chunks, though the chunks are quite soft and not a problem to swallow.

review/summary: Interesting
review/text: Upon the first swig of this, soft particles (of what I hoped were passion fruit) filled my mouth along with the tea.  That notwithstanding, the taste was good, if a bit sweet for my liking.  Inspection of the label indicated that the aforementioned particles were, in fact, "green tea leaves."  The product comes from Taiwan, so perhaps the culture there doesn't mind a pulpy beverage.  Again, not bad, but a whole bottle--which isn't that big--contains a somewhat high caloric content of 120.  Would probably be better without the cane sugar added in.

Not great either but still drinkable. Tasted like sweet green tea & a bit thick. The pulp is a nice addition & goes right down when you swallow. Honestly I enjoyed this one & might buy some if it wasn't so expensive. I'll give it 4 out of 5 stars....

review/summary: Refreshing with an Interesting Flavor
review/text: I have never used aloe for anything but on a burn so I really didn't know what to expect when I ordered this beverage.  I do drink green tea and various combinations of fruit flavors with it.<br /><br />When my Chantea arrived it was already chilled (February in Iowa) so I opened and tried it.  I was immediately surprised by the chunky, somewhat slimy, pulp of the aloe in my mouth. Beyond that, the flavor was a bit tart and fruity, was refreshing and not unpleasant.  I noticed in reading the label that a serving is 8 ounces, and the small, 11.5 ounce bottle about 1.5 servings.  I drank about half and put the bottle in the fridge for later.  When I finished it, I enjoyed it more.  I don't know if it was colder or if I just anticipated it, but I liked it, and the pulp didn't bother me.  It's a little like drinking orange juice with pulp, which I prefer.  I didn't notice any specific taste to the aloe pulp.<br /><br />The ingredients are as noted in order in the product description.  There are 80 calories per one cup serving and sugar(19 gm) and sodium (38mg) are the only notable identified dietary components of the drink, other than water.  I wish they would include the source and amount of aloe as it can have side effects and is not recommended for individuals with certain health concerns.<br /><br />This product is made in Taiwan.<br /><br />I would drink it again.

review/summary: Nice taste but high in sugar
review/text: I was sent one bottle of Chantea Aloe Vera and green Tea, Passion fruit flavor to sample and review.<br /><br />I found the taste to be pleasant. Although there are small bits of aloe vera pulp floating in the liquid, this didn't bother me since I often drink other beverages with floating bits of seeds or pulp. What did disturb me is that the 80 calorie, 11.5 oz. serving (1.5 servings per bottle) contained 19 grams of sugar. For anyone observing a low sugar eating plan, this is more than an entire day's sugar supply in a single beverage. That doesn't sound healthful to this reviewer. In fact, the second ingredient after water is cane sugar. I also feel that one is not likely to consume only 8 ounces and leave a half serving until later.<br /><br />I sampled my serving at room temperature-from the container so wasn't bothered by the pulpy bits clinging to either a glass or to ice cubes. However, the quantity of sugar makes this beverage a "no go" for this reviewer no matter how tasty.<br /><br />I found it odd that the "Instrucciones de uso" appeared to be written in Spanish, yet the origin of this drink is Taiwan.

It does seem to have an energyzing kick as well; at least I felt more lively after drinking it.<br /><br />It makes no claims on the bottle, and in fact I had to have the little bit about it translated ("refreshing and lovely" is what it seems to boil down to), and the calorie count is 80. It was something of a surprise to me in a good way. I would not hesitate to buy it again.

review/summary: A pleasant, tropical massage for the taste-buds
review/text: CHANTEA ALOE VERA GREEN TEA is a juice drink packaged in a 340 mL plastic bottle.  The bottle is clear and has a white-colored molded screw top and replaceable screw cap.  The bottle is hexagonal.  The drink is more of a passion fruit drink, and less like a tea drink.  In Hawaii, the shelves of grocery stores sell juice that contains passion fruit juice, called POG.  POG contains passion fruit juice, orange juice, and guava juice.  Passion fruit, known in Hawaii as lilikoi, are a beautiful yellow/orange on the outside, but a bland gray on the inside.  When consumed, the lilikoi has little pulpy thingees.  The CHANTEA ALOE VERA GREEN TEA also has the same little pulpy thingees, which makes it a truly unique drink.  At any rate, if you don't mind the little pulpy, squiggley thingees that are in home-made squeezed orange juice, then you will not mind the little pulpy thingees in CHANTEA ALOE VERA GREEN TEA.  This product is fine for packing into routine lunches.  This product is also fine when you have plans to throw a tropical-themed party at home.  At any rate, this product is an abundantly palatable source of our most important nutrient, namely, water.<br /><br />The product is sweet, and it contains cane sugar.  This is a good thing, because sugar is absolutely required for the central nervous system, and also because dietary sugar spares the body's degradation of protein.  Persons with training in nutrition, e.g., registered dieticians, know about the classic studies of Gamble, which showed that extra sugar in the diet can reduce our dietary requirement for protein.  This effect is called "protein sparing."  See, Gamble (1948) Physiological information gained from studies on the life raft ration in Harvey Lectures 42:247-273.

review/summary: Too good to glug!
review/text: Remember when you were a kid and it was impossible to sip that cold glass of chocolate milk...it was so good, you just had to glug it all down at once. Well, Chantea Aloe Vera Green Tea Passion Fruit is that good. I was not expecting much, since most of flavored tea drinks are too sweet...what a delightful surprise it turned out to be.  The passionfruit flavor is exotic and absolutely delicious, and there are big pieces of aloe vera pulp floating around, which give it a nice texture. The mixture is sweet, but not cloying and very refreshing. I could easily become addicted to this stuff.  I wanted to guzzle the entire bottle but made myself savor it. As soon as it was gone, I ordered more.<br /><br />This is a lovely beverage on its own.  I poured it over ice and added just a tiny squirt of lime.  It was very good that way, but straight out of the bottle was better. What I especially loved was the passionfruit aftertaste. It stays with you for quite a while and gives the breath a delicious fragrance.  Just breathing out is a delight.  Other reviewers had a problem with the pulp, and one felt it was weirdly flavored sugar water. Certainly the passionfruit is not your usual soft drink flavor, but I really liked it...it's a nice, grown up alternative to those frooty tooty strawberry/peach flavors. Another complained that water was the first ingredient listed on the label. What was she expecting?  If you are not afraid of discovering a new taste and don't want the same old same old, if you are not a fan of Kool-Ade and such, I think this will definitely appeal to you.<br /><br />I have to say, this is one of the best soft drinks I've ever tasted, and I'm not a fan of the genre.  This is the perfect beverage for sipping on a hot day.

review/summary: Surprisingly good!
review/text: Other aloe drinks I've tried have seemed overly bitter or planty-tasting.  This one was really good!  Normally, I'm not a big fan of pulp in my drinks--I find country-style orange juice kind of gross.  The Chantea fruit bits surprised me since not only did I find them palatable, but actually kind of fun to bite with each sip!  As far as sweetness level, this one is definitely sweet.  I don't have a huge sweet tooth, so I think I may dilute future bottles of Chantea with iced green tea.  However, I think the sweetness level would be good for those who enjoy their drinks sweet.<br /><br />I found this bottle easy to open though nicely sealed against tampering.  Unyielding packaging frustrates me.  It was nice to be able to get to to good stuff without a pair of scissors.  The bottle opening was a good size, allowing for nice-sized sips but not drowning me in tea.<br /><br />Overall, I'm a fan!  I'll be getting more.

review/summary: Best tea drink I have ever tasted....
review/text: I have had various different varieties of bottled tea drinks over the years and none have ever been the perfect blend... until now. Chantea's Aloe Vera Green Tea, Passion Fruit is the first time I have had the perfect bottled tea drink.<br /><br />Why do I think it's the perfect taste? The balance between the strength of the tea and the strength of the fruit flavors is right on the nail. Typically, what I have experienced from other bottlers is either the tea flavor is too strong or the additional flavors are weak or fake.<br /><br />If I could, I'd fill the garage with cases of it. If you want an authentic flavor in a refreshing size, this is the drink for you.

review/text: I count myself a health conscious consumer and was excited to try the Chantea Green Tea and Aloe Vera. Chantea, is unlike any other mass produced beverage all natural blend of Green Tea infused with Aloe Vera bits - two powerful and healthy ingredients.<br />This is a tasty, high quality beverage but I was initially thrown by the Aloe Vera bits. You don't expect "pulp" in tea. But really it tasted great. It's a lightly fruity drink in a slender container that fits in a lunch box or great to take on the go. Not overly sweet or too in your face.<br />Chantea won the Best New Product Award at the 2011 World Tea Expo and Buyer's Choice Best Ready to Drink Tea at the North American Tea Championship in Las Vegas.<br />If you want to try something new, be looking for this product on store shelves near you.

It has real aloe vera pulp which makes it very refreshing, has an amazing flavor and is unlike many other products. I have tried many different types of teas and many claim that they speeds up fat oxidation, improve insulin sensitivity, help with glucose tolerance, help with your skin, lower cholesterol levels, help control weight and many other benefits but this one you really  start feeling healthier after a short period . I tried two flavors the passion fruit and the natural flavor. I liked them both with a little inclination over the passion fruit one. If you are a healthy person or want to become one I really recommend this product.

review/summary: Quite good!
review/text: This is passion fruit flavored green tea with aloe vera pulp.  I really didn't know what to expect, but it sounded good.  Here is what I thought, from start to finish:<br /><br />The bottle looked as interesting as the drink sounded, bright colors, bold text.  Parts of the bottle are clear and you could see the liquid inside.  It is a light, clear-ish color and you could see the pulp floating through the whole bottle.  When I opened it it smelled good, like I would expect green tea and passion fruit to smell.  I took a small sip with no pulp and it tasted good.  The next sip I tried the pulp, it is hard not to get the pulp.  They are large juicy bits and the only way I could describe them was like the inside of an orange.  Have you ever pulled the membrane off a segment of an orange and then pulled the little juice filled pieces out?  It is like all the little tiny juice filled pieces floating in the drink.  As much as I thought it would be just OK, I found that I really enjoyed it.  It was quite good and I kept sipping, deciding I liked it even better, and then I finished the bottle.<br /><br />If you like green tea flavored with fruit and wouldn't mind the juicy bits (much better than pulp), then I would suggest giving this a try.  I am certainly going to get more, and I think I will be trying the lemon flavor, too.  Yum!

review/summary: Revolting Taste & Texture!
review/text: Based on the copy, which boasts awards, I was excited to try this tea. I should have known I was in trouble when I couldn't get the plastic off the cap. I'm sure that's a safety measure, but it's not exactly "save the earth," now is it. The pungent smell was the next clue. It's supposed to taste like passion fruit but it tastes like chemicals---and it probably is. The ingredient list states passion fruit "flavor." I only had a few sips, and I cannot get the taste out of  my mouth. The final straw is the globs, and I do mean globs, of aloe vera gel that are floating around, waiting to assault your mouth.<br /><br />With 19 grams of sugar, you'd be better off having a cup of water and a cup of fruit yogurt instead. Blech.

The aloe vera floaties & taste completely overides whatever sweeteners & artificial flavors they injected into this drink.<br /><br />Indeed it is kind of a slimy, gelantinous texture (the floaties are in perpetual suspension - there is NO settling to the bottom.!) with an odd funky flavor with an unfortunate after taste.<br /><br />I could not finish it nor can I recommend it.

review/summary: Not Tea, So Much as a Side Dish
review/text: It wasn't kidding when it said it included aloe vera pulp, and it's not in minced bits.  This is the chunkiest "beverage" I've ever had.  It really is more like a side dish.  The trend of bubble tea and other bits floating in one's beverage must be to blame.  Just a note to those who think this is an elegant green tea:  If you like pulp, expect to chew.  If you don't, expect to spit.  It's actually quite thick.<br /><br />Initially the flavor is nice, albeit a tad bitter, as a back note.  The acidity of the tea and passion fruit--and I suppose the citric acid--is really strong and quickly overwhelms the fruity flavors.  The tea is also extremely sweet.  19 grams of sugar per serving, which if you read the extremely fine print closely, the bottle is 1.3 servings.  How does that work, exactly?  So it really has 28.5 grams of sugar in the bottle.  That's quite a lot for such a tiny beverage.  Nothing healthy about that.<br /><br />For the expense, I'd choose other bottles teas over this one that are less sweet, more healthy, and certainly less chewable.

review/summary: LOADED with sugar, wierd aloe vera pulp
review/text: I got this Chantea thinking my Mother and I might like as a change from colas. She would not taste it after looking closely at it. I drank as much as I could bear. I cannot stress enough how nasty this Chantea Aloe Vera Green Tea, Passion Fruit is. The first impression was the smell and it actually smells really good. Second was the look of the drink - it has a yellow tint and these chunks of aloe vera pulp suspended in it. Shaking the bottle vigorously did not force the pulp to the bottom. Third - the taste. It is VERY VERY sweet, followed by the slimy pulp hitting your mouth and finally a bizarre aftertaste. When I say this stuff is loaded with sugar, I mean it. The Chantea is 11.5 ounces and is broken into two servings per bottle. That means there is 38 grams of sugar if you drink the entire bottle. A 12 ounce Dr Pepper has 38 grams of sugar and tastes better. If you are diabetic or concerned about sugar intake, steer clear! I won't buy this ever.

review/summary: A divided family.
review/text: Since I only had one bottle of this Chantea product to taste test, my husband and I divided the bottle.  He really liked it and would have given it an enthusiastic thumbs up.  I thought it was just okay, three stars from me.  I compromised with four stars.<br /><br />The product bothers me a little because the pulp of aloe vera is suspended in the liquid and it never separates and floats to the bottom.  The instructions say to shake well.  Well, that didn't change anything.  That means the product has a thick feel to me and I didn't like that.  I also didn't like the fact that I poured my portion of the bottle over ice and the pulpy bits clung to the ice cubes and the sides of the glass.  My husband drank his straight from the chilled bottle and enjoyed the whole experience.  He liked the flavor and the aroma.  I did not like the aftertaste.  Truly a family divided.<br /><br />The first ingredient listed on the label is water and the second is cane sugar.  Even though the drink did not taste overly sweet to me it is a little disconcerting for the second ingredient to be sugar.  The bottle is 11.5 fluid ounces.  A serving size is one cup (8 ounces) at 80 calories.  I can't imagine anybody drinking just 8 ounces and leaving the remainder for another time, so your calorie count would actually be more for the whole bottle.  The disclaimer says there are 1.5 servings - approximately - in a bottle.  Not too high on the calorie count, but I think the labeling is slightly misleading.  The label says this drink is a product of Taiwan.

review/summary: Strange texture and taste turned me off
review/text: I was intrigued by the flavor combination of this; I had never thought to try aloe as an ingredient, and even if I had, I would have never paired it with passion fruit. So I went in curious. I was disappointed.<br /><br />The drink looks strange - olive green with translucent, slightly darker green bits floating in it (the thick opaque label hides this fact at first glance). But I was okay with that. One swig, though, and I felt like I was chewing my drink - the bits are slimy and numerous. The taste was pretty sweet at first, but I did not the tinge the aloe gave to it, and the aftertaste sticks with you.<br /><br />A few swigs later, I resigned that I wasn't even going to finish the bottle. It was tehn I noticed that the bottle isn't one serving - it's 1.4375 servings (an 11.5-ounce bottle with a serving size of 8 ounces). This strikes me as a ploy to make the nutritional info look better.<br /><br />All in all, I won't be drinking this again, unless it's free and I have no other option, and even then I would have to think about it.

review/text: I am not a big fan of Passion Fruit but this Chantea Aloe Vera Green Tea, Passion Fruit is pretty good. It has a mild sweetness and I liked the pulp in the tea. Aloe Vera is good for you. This tea is also refreshing.

review/summary: Great flavor with a little texture!
review/text: This Tea was great, it wasn't too sweet and it tasted natural and fresh.<br />It also has little bits and pieces of either passion fruit or Aloe Vera that make it fun to drink as the tasty bits are a burst of flavor.<br />I shared a little with my family and all 3 of us where fighting for this one!!<br />Great Tea!!!! Buy it you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Pulpy bits
review/text: I had a hard time even trying this product because of the odd see-through, jelly-fish like, pulpy bits floating around in the tea.  The passion fruit was strong and sugary and there was the typical green tea aftertaste but I just couldn't finish the bottle.  It was too gross having the aloe pulp in my mouth.

review/summary: Tasty but the chewy isn't very appealing.
review/text: I honestly think Chantea could solve all their problems with a clear label.<br />The tea itself is actually pretty good but the label is opaque and covers up the fact that there are small chunks of Aloe or something floating in the top of the bottle. I shook it up, cracked the bottle, took a big swig and nearly spit it out.<br />It's not so much that the chunks tasted bad it was that I had no idea they were there. On top of that they were kind of slimy. I honestly didn't like the texture of them. I drink coconut water with chunks in it all the time, love it, but these chunks were just kinda weird to me.<br />So when I took that first swig and got a mouthful of unexpected slime chunks. Well it sullies the experience.<br /><br />Here's the thing, the tea is really good. Not too sweet not to bitter, once I got past the chunks I really liked it. It was very refreshing.<br />I guess I shoulda poured it into a glass or something first but I'm assuming the average consumer is just going to crack the bottle and start chugging.<br />Just brace yourself for the goo chunks. ;)

review/summary: A sugary substitute?
review/text: Initial responses:<br />Sight - looks like a green tea in color. Realize that there are solid chunks in the drink (I think it might be the aloe). I like the fact that all the ingredients are recognizable. I think the only thing that might be acting as a preservative is the citric acid.<br />Smell - floral and citrus - smells really good.<br />Feel - the chunks are noticeable in the mouth when drinking. Somewhat difficult to drink as the chunks either get stuck in my teeth and block the flow of tea (not joking) or get stuck on the outside of my mouth. Otherwise refreshing.<br />Taste - The chunks are like little explosions of flavor. I am fairly certain that the chunks are aloe vera. The green tea taste is distinct but not overpowering. The passion fruit flavor gives this a very floral taste. Sweet to the taste. Leaves a lingering bitterness/tartness after drinking. Somewhat unpleasant.<br /><br />Overall impressions:<br />This is a relatively low calorie (80) and somewhat refreshing drink. However, the amount of sugar within (and this is a considerable factor) and the related taste associations keep me from giving this more stars. This drink has 19g of sugar, the equivalent of about 1 1/3 tablespoon. It is the second ingredient listed. Granted, some of the sugars may come from the Aloe Vera (or even perhaps the passion fruit flavor?). But based on the Mayo Clinic's analysis of 2010 Dietary recommendations, by having this one drink you've already had over 1/9 of your daily recommended sugar for men, and over 1/6 for women. This is a little disconcerting, in my opinion. When you look at something (especially like tea, and aloe, and passion fruit) like this drink, you think of things that are generally healthy. There's just so much sugar in this that it becomes difficult for me to give this a more positive review.<br /><br />I think that the only redeeming aspect of this is that the calories are not ALL empty calories (like a soda) as you're assumedly getting antioxidants from the green tea - but why not just drink green tea in that case?

review/summary: Taste good, but has strange lumps of stuff (aloe?) in it
review/text: Tastes good, sweet, but not overly so. The lumps of aloe pieces are a bit strange though, soft & kind of mushy - not my favorite part. Tastes great otherwise.<br /><br />I think it would be far better without the pieces of aloe in it - would be better if blended into the drink.<br /><br />Sweetened with cane sugar, so not as bad as some drinks with beet or other sugars.<br /><br />22 carbs per bottle & 28g of sodium, so not good for those sensitive to sodium.<br /><br />It would be better if they dropped the sodium & got rid of the lumps of aloe.

review/text: I'm generally NOT a fan of green teat.  That being said, I'm always on the hunt for a good green tea beverage to try.  I may have just found it.  I really did enjoy this beverage.  There is a fair amount of pulp, but that did not deter me from liking it.  The flavor is rather subtle, but very delicious.  There is the usual  bitterness from the green tea, but it was only a slight amount.  Overall, I like it and will purchase on my own.  Give it try.

review/summary: Real nice taste
review/text: Yum! This review is on the Green Tea Aloe Vera Passion Fruit Flavor. It has a mild, smooth flavor, pleasant taste, and is lightly sweet with tiny pieces of fruit.  It is NOT too sweet.  It comes in a sturdy six-sided plastic bottle 8 1/4" high and 2 1/4" diameter, 11.5 fl oz./340ml.  It is a product of Taiwan. The writing on the label is tiny and hard to read but a serving size is a cup (8oz)and 1 serving contains 38 mg sodium and 20g carbs, 19 of which are sugar. Ingredients (in order listed) are: water, cane sugar, green teainfusion (green tea leaves and water), aloe vera, citric acid, natural passion fruit flavor.  Oh, 80 calories per serving, so I guess the whole bottle is around 110 calories. Nice for a lunchbox drink.

review/summary: Not my favorite.  I'll stick with water, thank you.
review/text: Well, I finally did it.  I finally tried Chan tea green tea with passion fruit and aloe vera.  And, it is *fairly* good, but I do have a little bit of reservation about it.  It was a bit on the sweet side (sugar is the second ingredient after water, the first).  I don't know if the flavor that I am tasting is the passion fruit, but there is a bit of an after-taste and not a very good tasting after-taste too.  I have to admit, I found the chunks of whatever-it-is (passion fruit?) kind of yucky.  So, although this drink won't kill you, neither will it be any favorite of mine.

review/summary: Delicious and refreshing blend of flavors
review/text: I really enjoyed this drink.  The mix of juices is not one that I would have thought of on my own.  It contains Aloe Vera, green tea, and passion fruit, which go together surprisingly well. You can taste all three in every sip.  It is a bit sweet, but as this is something that I would only have as an occasion treat, I really didn't mind.  The drink has aloe vera pulp in it which gives it a very nice texture.  Because the product contains natural sugar, it doesn't leave any aftertaste like many similar products. This is really perfect after spending some time outside on a hot day. If you like exotic flavored drinks, I highly recommend this product to you.

review/summary: Tasty Bits, Not Too Sweet
review/text: My cousin introduced me to fruity drinks with bits of aloe in em, and I find it kind of nifty! But most of those were in cans, and way too sweet. This stuff verges on too sweet for me, but I LOVE me some passion fruit. I'd recommend leaving it room temperature and pouring over lots of ice to water it down a bit.

review/summary: Too sweet!
review/text: The ingredients are "water, cane sugar, green tea infusion, aloe vera, citric acid, natural flavors (passion fruit)". As you probably know, the order of ingredients on these labels indicate the relative amount of each ingredient, and one sip of this will show you why sugar is the second ingredient listed: it's TOO SWEET! It's like taking a mouthful of very very sugary ice tea. I tend to prefer unsweetened ice tea so I can sweeten it myself to taste, or if it comes pre-sweetened at least it should be a small amount. This stuff is just pure sugar. Unless you have a very sweet tooth, this will probably be a problem.<br />On the plus side, the "aloe vera" part of the drink actually means there's actual aloe vera pulp in the tea. This may come as a surprise if you're not expecting it - and if you don't like things like high pulp OJ this is really not going to be the beverage for you. However, aloe is really good for you, and the actual pulp is the best way to get the benefits. If only they've been a little less heavy-handed with the sugar, this might have been an enjoyable drink, but I just can't get over the sweetness so this is one product I won't be buying.

review/summary: Sweet & pulpy
review/text: I do not love sweet drinks so I did not care for this green tea.  I found it overly sweet with a very pulpy and slimy texture.  If you are sensitive to textures and/or if you don't like pulp in your orange juice, you will not like this.  It did not have an objectionable taste to me, I just thought it was too sweet.  The pulp is suspended in the liquid, which is rather odd and it is not like orange juice pulp but more thick and slippery feeling.  I didn't love it.  If you like sweet beverages with a slight tea flavor and you don't mind the slimy pulp floating in it, you may enjoy it.

review/summary: Fabulous, fresh... a perfect sweet drink!
review/text: Chantea Aloe Vera Green Tea, in the passion fruit flavor really delivered in terms of overall taste.  The flavor does not hold back.  In other drinks containing aloe vera juice and pulp, I've noted a strange, off-putting aftertaste.  Not here.  There is pulp from the aloe vera, but with the passion fruit taste, that aftertaste is not at all discernible.<br /><br />I do prefer to have a grassier taste to green tea, but with the fruitiness of this drink, it would probably clash.  The tea is very well-balanced with the flavor of the juices.<br /><br />There is quite a bit of sugar in it, so if you're dieting, or just prefer not to have sugar in your diet, then this may be something to avoid.  However, if you're looking for a lovely, anytime tea to enjoy, this is it!

review/summary: Actually Pretty Good!
review/text: I was actually fairly hesitant to try to this, but I'm kinda glad I did, it is surprisingly good and is not at all what I expected!<br /><br />  When I finally got around to drinking this, I decided it would be best to warm some up and try it warm, and keep some cold (I had left it in my fridge for a while, in a way dreading drinking it).  I had fully expected to like it cold, and not so much warm or at room temperature, but I actually found the opposite to be completely true!  Warm and at room temperature, I could taste all the flavors, and it has a fairly thin consistency, but cold it is much "thicker" and with the chunks of Aloe Vera that are in it (once again another pleasant surprise), it was just too much for me to enjoy drinking, as i have an issue with things that are slightly slimy (I am a big texture person).<br /><br />  I would definitely purchase this though, and I would, in the future, most likely, drink it at room temperature or warm/hot (my husband preferred it cold, so its all a matter of personal taste I suppose!).  Of course, how you prefer to drink it is entirely up to you, but if you like the flavor passion fruit (and don't mind the slight taste of aloe and the slight slimy feel of aloe, the warmness helps with that though!) and like little chunks in what drink, along the lines of something like Bubble Tea (which I love!), then you may like this.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy

review/summary: Great taste
review/text: I am a tea lover - hot or cold - so when I saw this product, I thought I would give it a try. It has many things in it I like: green tea, passion fruit, and aloe vera. Wait...aloe vera? Yep, aloe vera in a drink.<br /><br />I had never heard of this plant in a drink, but I had heard of its many wonderful qualities, so I thought I would try this.<br /><br />The taste was great. It is very sweet, and makes a wonderful cold drink on a hot day. I love the taste of passion fruit, and that is where it gets its sweet flavor. At the same time, it is equal in calories to many other drinks on the market: 80 per serving or 120 per bottle because you know you are going to drink the whole thing right away - it is that good.<br /><br />It has zero fat, zero protein, only 20 carbs and only 19 sugars so it does better in this area than many other sweet drinks.<br /><br />The only thing that I did not care for in this drink was that it has pulp in it. Now many people like pulp in orange juice or other citrus juice drinks, but I don't, so I was not wild about the pulp in this drink, but it isn't that bad either. It's just pulp.<br /><br />So, overall, I liked this drink especially for the hot weather we have been having here in the southern U. S.

It's a little on the pricey side, but as I've mentioned, this could be used as a healthy snack substitution. One bottle contains 18 grams of carbs, 17 grams of sugar and 25 mg of sodium, as well as 40% of the minimum daily Vitamin C value. It's a healthier alternative to candy or soda, and I recommend that you give it a try.

review/summary: Sweet drink with texture
review/text: Chantea Aloe Vera Green Tea Passionfruit is a nice change of pace from some of the flavored teas out there.  It has chunks of aloe vera in it, which I like because I like texture in my food/drink.  My first impression is of the bottle, which is easy to hold due to the hexagonal shape (the sides are indented as well).  As I took the first sip (I drank it cold), I was surprised at how sweet it was. I could definitely taste the cane sugar.  The aloe is not too much (it doesn't take over your mouth like some aloe drinks), and the passionfruit flavor is not too strong.  My only complaint is that the drink leaves a slight aftertaste/feel.  It almost leaves me more thirsty.  The sugar content is not too bad but you do have to realize that there are 1 1/2 servings per bottle, which actually brings the sugar up to 28.5g per bottle (approx.).<br /><br />I give this product 4 stars. It is quite tasty but leaves a little bit of an aftertaste, in my opinion.

review/summary: Good passion fruit flavor, good pulp, little green tea, lots of sweet
review/text: I'm a big fan of most of the ALO brand of aloe juices so I figured I'd try out this version by Chantea, especially since I'm a big fan of passion fruit. Right off the bat the Chantea has a nice aroma, very sweet and fruity. Like most aloe drinks, the Chantea is very high in sugar (cane sugar, not HFCS) at 28g per bottle - to put that into perspective, a can of regular Coke has about 39g. If this is one of your only sources of sugar, it's not too bad, but just don't get it into your head that this is super healthy either.<br /><br />If you've never tried an aloe drink, the first thing you should know is that they contain what can only be described as "slimy chunks" mixed in. If eaten directly from the aloe plant, this stuff is unbelievably bitter - hence the need for tons of sugar. The bits themselves aren't really appetizing to the American palate. If you're used to Asian food, you'll probably have less of a problem (it reminds me of large tapioca chunks). If you eat Japanese food, it's sort of like really soft konyaku.<br /><br />The passion fruit flavor was pretty strong, but unfortunately the green tea was not. If you like drinking some of the bottled green teas by companies like Lipton or Snapple, you won't find the flavor any different. However if you were hoping for a true green tea flavor, you won't find it here.<br /><br />All in all, the Chantea isn't too bad, but I think I still prefer the ALO - and that's only because there's a particular flavor I like.

review/text: I enjoyed the taste of this tea--I did find that the flavor was much better if it was chilled instead of room temperature.  The taste and scent of the tea reminded me of Brazil for some reason, perhaps because of the passion fruit.  The tea has bits of aloe in it, and although it was still easy to drink, I found the sensation of having pieces of "something" in a liquid drink disconcerting and a bit strange.  However, if you don't mind the slivers of aloe floating in your drink, Chantea is something you might enjoy.

review/summary: decent, but I wouldn't call myself a fan
review/text: The Chantea Aloe Vera Green Tea with Passion Fruit flavor is somewhat decent, however I wouldn't call myself a fan of it. I don't really like tea and I never drink it, but decided to try this since it had a passion fruit flavor mixed in with it. I smelled it after opening the cap and the drink had a very strong passion fruit scent. The passion fruit flavor is also really strong to the point where you cannot taste the flavor of the green tea in it. It was also very sweet too so it seemed like I was drinking juice. In my opinion, it was a little too sweet. The chunks of aloe vera in it were interesting, but it's basically what killed the drink for me. The chunky, slimy texture of the aloe vera kind of grossed me out and I couldn't finish the small glass of it that I poured. I ended up pouring the glass down the sink. I also found it interesting that the tea was a product of Taiwan.<br /><br />If you like VERY sweet tea with a fruity twist, you'd probably like this. As for me, I won't be buying it in the future.

review/summary: A Drink with Taste and Texture
review/text: I'm a big fan of green tea and passion fruit, so I was anxious to try Chantea.  What was unique and unexpected about this beverage is that it has texture...that is it has chunks of what I think is passion fruit floating in it.  I love the fact that it is not overly sweet, is very refreshing and has the delightful taste of passion fruit.  This is a not your average health drink and I like it's uniqueness, however it is incredibly expensive, and for that reason I gave it four stars.

review/summary: Surprisingly refreshing green tea with aloe vera pulp!
review/text: Chantea Aloe Vera Green Tea, Passion Fruit is quite fun!  The flavor is strong, fruity and actually quite good!  There are little pieces of aloe vera (pulp) that float in the green tea, that are quite surprising at first gulp, but I enjoyed them after I got used to them!  The drink is quite refreshing, and would be a great special treat: with 29 grams of sugar and 120 calories in this 11.5 fluid ounce bottle, this drink would be more a special treat than a regular item for me.  The passion fruit flavor is quite good, I would definitely recommend this aloe vera green tea drink from Chantea!

review/text: Received this drink on a busy day when I hadn't had time for lunch. So I opened the bottle as soon as I got it and -- WOW! -- even without benefit of refrigeration or ice, it was FANTASTIC!  Excellent, complex flavor.  The bits of aloe add a thickness and heartiness that I didn't anticipate -- but I loved them!  It's a GREAT DRINK, refreshing, filling, and tasty.  I don't like a lot of sweetness, so this beverage was perfect for me.  I certainly see why it wins taste tests.  I highly recommend!

review/summary: Great Taste, Different!
review/text: This beverage was very interesting. It had a nice passion fruit flavor, and there were chunks of what I assume is aloe. It was also very sweet, so would probably taste a lot better if it's diluted with sparkling water. I did expect a lighter flavor so that it would let the flavor of the green tea come through somewhat, but it didn't really, and just tasted like juice to me.

review/summary: Not Pulpy Enough
review/text: I'm a pulp guy. I'd buy extra pulp orange juice if they sold it. Those bits of fruit make it seem as if I am getting the real deal in nutrition. This tea is pulpy too thankfully, and that's not for everyone based on the other reviews I am seeing.<br /><br />Taste-wise, I found the combination just okay. I think it is the passion fruit that dominates the taste. I don't think I've every had a passion fruit by itself, but I suspect that I would find the fruit average. Bottom line is that I would drink this if I had nothing else refreshing in the house to drink, but ultimately I would seek another drink product if I could.

It does contain sugar so diabetics may have to wait for the artificially sweetened version.  Also, it comes in a plastic bottle.  I prefer glass bottles.  I realize glass increases the price and so will probably be getting harder to find.  But I would love to enjoy this same product from an ice cold glass container.

review/summary: Delicious Fruit-Flavored Green Tea Drink
review/text: Succulently sweet are the words to describe Chan Tea's Green Tea & Aloe Vera Passion Fruit Flavor drink.  Think this is a winning combination of Chinese green tea and passion fruit; the only downside is the fruit pulp that is included (I would have been happier if this beverage didn't contain pulp, but that's just my personal opinion; others may have a substantially different reaction.). While this isn't my first choice for a green tea beverage, it is most certainly one well worth trying.

review/summary: Sweet and chunky tea
review/text: The Amazon page mentions that this Chantea Aloe Vera Green Tea with Passion Fruit has pulp. That is a major understatement. By pulp, they mean chunks of passion fruit up to � of an inch. The few people that saw the drink before I opened it insisted that there was something wrong with it and I should throw it away. I was pretty disgusted too but committed to trying it. I didn't think there was any way that I would like it.<br /><br />It turned out to taste pretty good. The experience with the oversized "pulp" wasn't bad either. I found it natural to swallow the liquid and the lumps separately but it was fine.<br /><br />There are two reasons that I don't expect to get this again. It is expensive and it is too sweet. It is sweet enough to be a dessert.  It was a novelty to try it once. I liked it, but I'm all set now.

review/summary: Sensation: liquid fruit cocktail, better than other aloe chunk drinks
review/text: The flavor was fine, like bright crisp apple juice with hint of green tea, sweet but not too sweet.  However, I didn't like the sensation of little soft bits of sweet stuff in my drink. To me it seemed like I was drinking some juice that had minced pieces of canned fruit cocktail in it.<br /><br />On the other hand, my daughter thought it was fine.  She said the pieces of aloe in this one were much better than other drinks she has tried with pieces of aloe.  In others, the pieces of aloe were larger and "gushier, like pieces of snot", so she liked this one better.<br /><br />I suppose it is a generational thing, not being enamored with bits in my drink.  But the flavor was good and not too sweet, much appreciated.

I am not much of a tea drinker but the flavor of this one would make me consider drinking it again. If it wasn't for one thing.<br /><br />The pulp. There is a ton of pulp in this. I don't understand why they left so much of it in there. Sure, I can understand a little pulp once and awhile like orange juice but the pulp in this is just over powering and completely took away any enjoyment I could possibly have had with this.<br /><br />If you are a fan of tea, and don't like pulp wither pass on this or plan ahead that you will have to strain it.

review/text: When you first take a sip of The Passion Fruit flavor of Chantea Aloe Vera Green Tea is that it is very chunky.  I was not prepared for how much pulp would be in it.  Talk the most pulpy orange juice you have ever drank and multiply it by two or three and that is how much pump is in this drink and the pulp is so thick sometime I wonder if I should chew it.  As for the taste, I am not a big fan of green tea (but I do try to drink it for the health benefits), but the passion fruit does over power the green tea for an very enjoyable taste.

review/text: This is a review from the perspective of a non-vegan. I understand that a vegan, non-dairy cookie would taste different than any ordinary cookie. Even though I'm not vegan, I was curious and intrigued by the healthy benefits of this all natural cookie (15g protein) so I tried the chocolate chip flavor. I was impressed by the texture (I like my cookies soft and chewy), but the taste was mediocre. Considering that the cookie packs a total of 408 calories, I would have to say that I would rather eat a chocolate chip cookie made with dairy products than this one. It's a great alternative for vegans though.

review/text: If you're looking for genuine Styrian Pumpkinseed Oil, you're looking at the right product.<br /><br />Styrian pumpkinseed oil is pressed from the seeds of Styrian pumpkins, which grow only in Styria, Austria.<br /><br />My husband grew up eating salads dressed with a simple pumpkinseed and vinegar dressing, and raved about it for years. His grandmother would visit "the old country" every few years, leaving America with a suitcase full of Levi's and coming home with a suitcase full of meats and cheeses. One thing she always brought back was plain plastic bottles filled with this nutty green oil.<br /><br />After scouring every grocery store I went to for years on end, I finally caved and bought this very expensive bottle of oil. When he saw it his face lit up. When he sniffed it he drooled. Yesterday I made him a salad with it as a dressing, and he just about died.<br /><br />This is the real thing. If you want pumpkinseed oil, you will not be disappointed. There is nothing else like it.<br /><br />The shipping was pretty hefty, at $10 for the single bottle. I assumed that was because it was coming right from Austria and was a little dismayed when I saw my box came from right here in the States. It was so well packaged, though, that it was worth it. If the bottle had been broken I'd have been far more upset.

(sounded like most comments pertained to prince of peace green tea, and don't have anything to do with the instant dong quai and red date tea that i clicked on...that being said, this is a remarkable tea...it's delicious, it's instant (so you don't have to wait for it to steep) and it's really good for you...i just love the taste of this, but then again - i enjoy the uniquely-bitter flavor of dong quai (but this isn't bitter, it's yummy!)...for those who don't know, dong quai is considered to be "ginseng for women" beceause it's very high in vit B12 and helps to keep women from becoming anemic (due the their monthly cycle)...it also is said to help regulate irregular periods, when used on a daily basis...that said, this tea is special because it helps to "draw one's energy" downwards (and the red date, adds to this effect in that red is the color of the 1st chakra)...in other words, this tea has aphrodisiac qualities and will create pleasnt feelings when taken before bed (and it's "good for you" and it tastes good and it's a snap to make)...so what's there to be quibbling about?

review/text: My household has this tea stocked up at all times.. not to say it's my favorite tea, but it's my favorite day to day tea. We tend to drink Green Tea for its health benefits and as Green Teas go this one is affordable and fairly high quality for tea bag types. A few notes.. you have to be fairly careful about steeping this tea, it doesn't have a whole lot of tolerance from "crisp and delicious" to "overpowering and slightly off-putting". I guess I attribute that to the freshness of the tea. I'm not sure. I've had a lot different results with loose tea in a ball and some herbal teas. While this tastes good when you get it right, if you forget the cup for a few minutes, it's not forgiving. That said, that's the only real drawback to this tea. Yes. I've had teas I would rate five stars, six if I could. Yes, they also cost 5-6x more than this easily for a quarter of the amount of tea. Bottom line, if you drink a lot of tea, this is a good brand to buy. If you don't drink a whole lot and would rather buy something really high quality for the few times you do partake of it, I'd look elsewhere.

review/summary: Good tea, very gingery
review/text: This tea has a wonderfully strong ginger flavor.  The bags come individually wrapped in foil packets.  It steeps fast and the resulting mug of tea is murky and delightfully aromatic.  I love it and will undoubtedly use every bag in the next month or so.  The one thing I think anyone buying this product should be aware of is that they add stevia to the bags.  I am usually not a fan of stevia (to me it has a bitter aftertaste) but it was not overwhelming here.
