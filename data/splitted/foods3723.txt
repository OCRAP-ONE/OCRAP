review/text: I loved this tea before the vanilla was added, when it was just plain honeybush tea.  It was delicious.  The addition of vanilla really changed the flavor, and I do not like it at all now.  It seems bitter.

review/summary: shipping product  needs improvement
review/text: These spelt noodles are wonderful.  No one in my family can tell the difference from ordinary noodles we used to buy and so much better for you!  They are easier to overcook though and when you do so they can turn into mush.  But the taste is great!  However, the first case we purchased AND the replacement case came to us with the noodles in small, small pieces.  Which is a little hard to make lasagna that way!!!  So, either Amazon has defective cases or their shipping methods for this product needs a little improvement.

review/summary: THESE ARE THE VERY BEST, AWSOME!!!
review/text: I ordered these Pig Ears for my two very picky little girls, (Hot Dogs)Missy and Sassy. I was concerned they wouldn't look anything like the picture, I was wrong!! These are the best pig ears I have ever purchased!!! And I have purchased a lot of different brands. These are clean, thin, shaped like a pig ear and are not greasy or hard for my girls to chew. Also, there are no pointed ends that poke them when they try to chew them. They love the taste of these pig ears and I love the price and quality. I purchased the 100pk, which brought the cost to around 90 cents an ear. The delivery was fast, packaging was great. I recieved 4 bags, each had 25 ears in a clear zip lock plastic bag. I can't believe the difference in these ears and the ones I've purchased at all the local pet stores. Pet; Mart, Co, Supermarket. I've also bought them from the local Superstores, non of them have ears anything like these. Plus the price from these other stores ranged from $1.29ea to $1.60ea.  From now on, I will only buy this brand of Pig Ears for my girls. If you have a big or small dog, both will be able to chew these and enjoy them. They won't leave grease stains on furniture or floors. They don't have any coating on them, there are no ends to poke you pet in the eye or hurt their mouth. All you will get is a great natural pig ear, one your pet is sure to love. Again Amazon came thru with the best merchandise and best price.

review/text: I'm always skeptical when buying from the lowest priced vendor, but I'm happy to say these are AT LEAST as good as any pig ears you will find in the store. The only difference is you'll be paying half as much. Free shipping makes this a no-brainer. The case comes with 4 ziplock bags of 25. I'm almost into the 4th bag now, and all the pieces have been nice sized. Not once have I seen a puny treat, so I'll be placing another order soon.

review/summary: great stuff, but not from Amazon
review/text: This stuff is the best - it is the only all natural no sugar added electrolyte sports drink I know of.  We go through it fast in our house, even though we cut it with water so it is not as sweet.  Thought I would save some $ and some time by ordering it by the case from Amazon, but the bottles we got were a month away from the expiration date.  So much for keeping it around for a while.  We have since found it to be significantly fresher and less expensive at whole foods.

review/summary: I LOVE this stuff
review/text: As someone who does not consume a lot of sugary products, I really love this item.  It's a much better alternative to gatorade and other sports drinks, and a lot lighter than juice.  I don't use it as a sports drink; I drink water 99% of the time.  But I have a potassium deficiency and don't consume a lot of salts so sometimes have to supplement electrolytes and this drink is the BEST.  We also drink it when sick with colds, viruses etc when it's important to stay hydrated and water is too hard on the stomach.  My significant other once got a terrible case of food poisoning and this was the only thing he could keep down for days.  It's expensive at my grocery store ($4+ per bottle) so I order in bulk on amazon and always have it on hand!

review/text: My nephews were all kinds of excited when they opened up their stockings on Christmas day to find Zombie Jerky.  They thought it was the funniest thing in the world.  But when it came to eating them they were far less enthusiastic.  The jerky had a strange consistancy to it, but it tasted good to me.  So they ended up giving me the jerky and keeping the package.  Go figure.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to folks out to give an amusing novelty gift.

review/text: I cannot believe they are getting $18.25 per jar. With shipping it's almost $30. This is a very good product but not worth that much.  I'm assuming that if people are actually paying this price that it is not available in any store in their area.  I live in Wisconsin and it is available year-round for $6-8 in most grocery stores.  Walmart has it only Nov.-Dec.  Each year right after Christmas it goes on clearance - I actually go there and stock up (I have about 12 jars right now).  I have never paid more that $3 per jar.  With a coupon I have actually gotten it for under $2. I get to enjoy Mincemeat pie year-round.  Before purchasing on Amazon please check around your town!

Its a shame though because Special K is my main food source (eaten twice daily) in my current diet, and I've dropped 5lbs in 1 1/2 weeks.

review/text: I gave these to my wife as a Valentines gift. She was very pleased with the assortment and rich flavors. The selections are all delicious and the guess work is removed with the map printed on the inside lid. My only regret is that since I found them mighty tasty, as well, that I didn't order 2 boxes.

review/summary: Best hazelnut K-Cup we've found...
review/text: We have tried several different types of Keurig cups in search of the right Hazelnut coffee. This is the best we've found!  Overall, I like the taste and aroma. The only possible opportunity is that it could be a bit stronger...but I think this is more a case of personal preference (I like my coffee strong!) The hazelnut flavor is well balanced---strong without overpowering, not overly sweet like some other hazelnut coffee flavors.

review/summary: Awesome Taste, Great Aroma!
review/text: When I first got my Keurig brewing machine, I was a little skeptical about the quality of coffee any K-Cup could provide. After making a cup of Gloria Jean's Hazelnut coffee using a K-Cup from a sample pack, I now stand corrected! Gloria Jean's makes great coffee to begin with and their Hazelnut coffee in K-Cup form is fantastic.<br /><br />The coffee gives off a wonderful Hazelnut aroma while it's brewing and it tastes great! It's the kind of aroma and taste you'd expect after grinding the beans yourself, but the K-Cup saves you the hassle. In the time that I've owned a Keurig brewer, this is hands-down one of the best coffees I've tried, and I'll definitely be ordering it again.<br /><br />My only complaint is in the packaging, but since it doesn't have anything to do with the quality of the coffee, I can't rate it less than five stars. Just wish this 50-pack came in a differently-sized/designed box so it would store more easily in a kitchen cabinet.

review/summary: Delicious hazelnut aroma!
review/text: I love Gloria Jean coffee and their hazelnut K-cups do not disappoint. The aroma smells mouthwatering as it's brewing and the strength is just right. I do have to admit that hazelnut coffee tends to be on the light side of coffee strength so strong coffee drinkers beware! I always use the medium cup setting on the Keurig B60 special edition so if you want it stronger, use the smallest cup setting. At $0.60 per cup, this is easily the best value for coffee, especially if you're drinking a mug everyday like me.

review/summary: Am I drinking the same coffee as the 5-star reviewers?
review/text: I don't know how what I tried could be considered the same as what all the rave reviews are coming in for.<br /><br />When we got our new Keurig brewer for Christmas it came with a sample pack of 12 different coffees. We were excited for the opportunity to try different blends before purchasing an entire (pricey) box of any one flavor.<br /><br />To preface: I enjoy flavored coffees. French vanilla, mocha, hazelnut... Pretty much any variety available. I was really excited to try Gloria Jean's Hazelnut since it was one of the few flavored options in the sample pack. I typically enjoy smooth medium roasts and I can't stand bitter coffee with a pungent aftertaste.<br /><br />Unfortunately, though, this brew is without-a-doubt undrinkable. So bitter and thick. I couldn't believe this was supposed to be a flavored blend. It smelled burnt as soon as it was brewed. We brewed an 8 ounce cup since typically flavored coffees tend to be weaker so we assumed brewing the smaller size cup would allow us to enjoy to most flavor. The coffee was dark in appearance and both my boyfriend and I tried it befor dumping it out in the sink because the taste was so foul.<br /><br />Aside from its burnt flavor and bitter aftertaste, it's also worth mentioning that I couldn't detect any hazelnut notes at all. Very disappointing.<br /><br />I'd never tried a Gloria Jean brand coffee before and now I'm nervous to try another. I might attempt the Butter Toffee flavor if I can find it in a small pack. But I'll avoid hazelnut from now on.

review/text: I'm generally not a fan of Hazelnut coffee but even I like this one.  My husband tried this in a sample pack and loved it so I ordered them for him.  I was surprised that the cups arrived loose in the shipping box so make sure you have a container for them as this box doesn't exactly fit in the cabinet the way the small retail boxes do.  That said this coffee has a nice bold taste which works great in a big mug.  We will definitely buy more of these.

review/summary: Hazelnut Heaven
review/text: My husband and I are hazelnut coffee fans.  We've tried every brand of hazelnut K-cups we can find.  The Gloria Jean's is our favorite, even beating out Dunkin' Donut's and Millstone's Hazelnut Cream (which used to be my favorite) hands down.  We always make the largest size cup and there is still plenty of flavor, never watered down or "thin" tasting.  I've always been the major coffee drinker in the house, until we got the Keurig and then the Gloria Jean's Hazelnut.  My husband now drinks 2-4 cups a day!  Make the investment in the Keurig so much more worth it.<br /><br />This purchase is a great deal.  At $0.60 per cup and free shipping, it's a fabulous price and I don't feel like I'm paying extra money for packaging.  It does come in a no-frills box with all 50 of the cups just loose in the large box.  However, we have a holder on the counter which we fill and just keep the box in the pantry to pull from as we need.  If you have a storage situation like a stand or a drawer you keep your K-cups in, you'll have no complaints about them being loose in the box.  We're about to order our second box, and will definitely be repeat buyers!

review/text: These K-cups don't compare to any other.  They are the most flavorful than any I've tried.  I love Dunkin Donuts coffee and this is equally as good and alot less expensive!

review/summary: Love this Coffee!
review/text: I love this flavor of coffee for the Keurig machine.  It's subtle and not too sweet.  My husband love his coffee super sweet, but I prefer mine black, and we can both enjoy this without adding anything to it.  I definitely think this particular item is a great value.  When a couple people make coffee daily, you can really go through the k-cups, and this product keeps us stocked.  When these arrived, there were one or two that had been damaged in transit, but it didn't really bother me.  I removed the broken cups and transferred the rest to our k-cup staging area.  Definitely a good buy.

review/summary: Great Coffee, Great Price
review/text: We love the Hazelnut coffee in our house! Great flavor and the coffee isn't bitter or too strong. I also love the price! Buying it here in a pack of 50 makes it cheaper than any of the stores in our city.

review/summary: Great cup of coffee.
review/text: We enjoy this coffee very much.  With subscribe and save, it is a great value as well.  The hazelnut flavor is strong which is a plus for us, but might be overwhelming for some.  Only wish the coffee itself was a bit more bold.

review/summary: Great product.. but count the k-cups
review/text: I have bought several of these... But this was the first time I actually counted to see if there was 50..  SURPRISE!!!  There were only 47....<br />Not THAT big of a deal.. but be wary....  That actually makes it more $'s than just going to walmart and getting there 18 pk.

review/text: I have to admit, I first purchased these Hazelnut K-Cups because of the low price. I had to pick some up for the office, and the price was right. I was very pleasantly surprised with the coffee! Better flavor than some K-Cups that cost a lot more.

review/summary: Bitter, Burned Flavor. Major Aftertaste.
review/text: With the first sip, you can taste the bitter, burned nut flavor in this Gloria Jeans k-cup.  Top it off with a major aftertaste (cream & sugar didn't help) & this blend went straight to the bottom of my list.<br /><br />If you want a nice hazelnut coffee, try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IRGDFW">Millstone Coffee, Hazelnut Cream, 12-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 3)</a>.

review/summary: Not a good value and weak in strength.
review/text: I guess my title says it all.<br /><br />Price has gone up 30% plus in the past three months. I have got my old coffee maker back out for when there is more than one of us having coffee. At over 50 cents a cup, even on "sale", this is too much. (All K-cup were at one time 30-40 cents now they are 50-60 cents!)<br /><br />For the taste it is weak at best and I am not a strong coffee drinker.  Better flavored Kcups out there but this one is just OK.  I do like some other Gloria Jean's coffee but usually get the bold one's just get a normal cup of coffee.

review/summary: Gloria Jean's Coffee - Hazelnut
review/text: Gloria Jean's Coffees, Hazelnut K-Cups for Keurig.  Tasted fine but was hoping for a bit more Hazelnut flavor.  In their defense I have found most K-Cups not to have a strong flavor like fresh brew coffee.  Product good, would buy again, but the flavor was not over the top.

review/text: I love hazlenut coffee.  I have tried several brand of Kcups over the first year of having a Keurig.  Gloria Jean's Hazelnut is rich in flavor without the acidy after taste of many others that often upsets your stomach if you enjoy coffee often.  I start out the day with no less than 4 cups and I never get tired of Gloria Jean's.  You simply "must" use the "frustration free" packaging, thank's Amazon!
