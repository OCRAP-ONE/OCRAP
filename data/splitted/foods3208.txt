review/summary: Too much salt and too much hot
review/text: Don't get me wrong, these are good tasting peanuts. And we love Chile y Limon peanuts and we buy them all the time at retail stores. But there seems to be a shortage of this style, so we tried this brand. But there seems to be way too<br />much chile on them. And too much salt too. We've tried many brands and I can honestly say these are the most hot and<br />salty of all. So, if that's to your taste, you will be a happy camper with these.<br /><br />One other minor point: the packages are huge, but the peanuts settled to about a third of the package. We think there<br />are actually 6.5 oz of peanuts there, but it's disconcerting to see all 6 with so much package and so little peanuts.

review/summary: Best marinade with beer, wine or broth
review/text: I've been using Healthy Boy as a secret ingredient in my recipes for a decade and I think that it is the finest soy sauce I've ever used for flavoring, dipping and for marinades. I love a few drops on the tongue for a quick flavor rush!<br /><br />It's delicious on steak tartare to steak well-done as well.<br /><br />Ever try Frank's RedHot pepper sauce on steaming, buttery corn on the cob? It tastes great and has a kick you'll not soon forget. Well, Healthy Boy mushroom soy sauce gives corn on the cob a special kick too! Not with spicy heat but with rich, earthy flavor!<br /><br />I like it on french fries (combine it with malt vinegar or ketchup to tweak your tastebuds!). Instead of salt and pepper spice-up your next hamburger patty with a splash or two or three of Healthy Boy. I can add it to just about any soup, meat or vegetable dish for a unique taste that keeps everyone asking: "How did you get that wonderful flavor?"<br /><br />I've been using it in my jambalaya for years. And when I make the rice I add rice wine vinegar (to make it sticky to hold the juice) and Healthy Boy (to give it that 'something extra' that makes rice more than just a bed on which to ladle broth, vegetables, andouille sausage and seafood). Don't throw away the flavor-rich leftover rice. Serve it reheated with a couple of extra splashes of Healthy Boy for breakfast with poached eggs and buttered toast.<br /><br />I think that it's lower in sodium compared to just about every other soy sauce on the market I've tried except those labeled as such and they're pretty bland by comparison. Sure, eat less sodium in your diet but don't give up flavor too! Mrs. Dash can only do so much to enliven the tastebuds before even it gets boringly dull and routine. Healthy Boy never gets dull because it blends with flavors making them all exciting and new again.<br /><br />If you can't find Healthy Boy brand then you might want to try Lee Kim Kee Shiitake mushroom soy sauce as a worthy alternative. I've found it in many well-stocked oriental grocery stores which rarely have less than 30 soy sauce varieties to choose from. It has a bit more earthy flavor and richness if you like shiitake mushrooms but others might find it a bit overwhelming. So, use it sparingly until you, your family or your dinner guests get used to it.<br /><br />I highly recommend Healthy Boy mushroom flavored soy sauce -- 4 1/2 stars.

review/summary: Just like regular pasta
review/text: I have no idea whether the Dreamfield claims are true regarding the magic blackbox way to block carb uptake -- as a chemical engineer and knowing a small amount about slight molecular changes in artificial sweeteners that prevent uptake, it seemed feasible.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The NIH did a study where it showed the same glycemic response as regular pasta and I have not seen an independent report supporting the Dreamfield claims -- but since the pasta is not much more expensive than other pastas and since it tastes just as good as other pastas (cooking the same, having the same texture, etc.) I am giving it four stars for at least the creative marketing.<br /><br />I would not, however, want my diabetic sister to start eating it if her trust is based on their claims.  It is like getting my children baptised, though it is speculative whether the claimed benefits are true -- there is no real downside for the small chance that the claims are, in fact, true.<br /><br />I just purchased another six boxes...I treat them as if I am eating regular pasta.  If I want what I feel is a real healthy no carb replacement, I use shirataki -- to which there is no doubt about the benefits and content but it is also clear that it is not regular pasta.

review/text: I have been buying this pasta for about 6 months now and I'm actually subscribing to it now. It tastes just like regular pasta except with few carbs. There is supposed to be some sort of additive in the pasta that reduces the carbs. I think it works sort of like a fat blocker, but I've heard that they can cause digestive problems.<br /><br />I've been eating it for 6 months with no problems, and it tastes great too!

review/summary: Happy With this Product
review/text: I have been looking for low carb pasta for a while. I tried shirataki pasta, but I did not like the texture. I heard of this pasta on the internet. I did research and decided to try it out. When cooking this, it is better to cook it a shorter amount of time. That is what makes it low carb. Also one thing I read was, reheating this pasta will mess the chemical balance up. I am not sure if this is true, but I would stay on the safe side. So I would recommend cooking it when you are ready to eat, and not reheating it. I am not sure if this is really low carb, there is no absolute way to find out. This also does not work for every one. Trying it before you buy six boxes would be a good idea. I would recommend this to a friend who is trying to watch their carb intake.

review/text: My husband was hesitant to try this pasta because, in his experience, low carb (or lower carb) pasta tasted like cardboard. I ordered this to try it out. I made 1/2 a box for the two of us and covered it with Alfredo sauce, grilled chicken, and some shredded cheese. It tasted BETTER than Noodles and Co.! My husband was so surprised!<br /><br />It still has some carbs in it but not so much that it should be a dealbreaker. I could've made 1/3 of a box for the two of us to shared and added more chicken to bulk it up to dinner size. I would HIGHLY recommend!

review/text: They say low carb, I have no way to test that. I will eat pasta anyway so why not take a chance and watch my weight. Its a fine product as far as taste. Cooks up nice, light, filling. Made a cold salad with tuna, hard eggs, bell peppers, onion, celery, mayo and spices and a hot dish with a white sauce containing baby clams and shrimp. Everyone who tried it , loved it and all noticed how nice the pasts tasted. It most likely won't change your life ( myself I was hoping for a statue ) however if you can be satisfied with a lot of greatful eaters, by all means buy this product. If its low carb, Icing on a great cake. I am not a professional cook, but I love good food, and this fits that bill to a "T".

review/text: this company uses boxes that leads you to believe you are getting a pound of pasta like other companies but you only get 13 some ounces. I noticed when opening up their boxes how little pasta is inside. I bought a whole bunch of this stuff, different styles that were all in standard size packaging that most companies provide a lb of pasta to realize they mislead you into thinking you are getting a lb.<br />The stuff is not cheap to begin with. I truly wonder with a company that is misleading if their claims of 5 digestable grams of carbs is true. They can say whatever they want as this stuff is not FDA regulated.

Personally, I don't care for plum jam, so I have no idea if there is a difference or not, but my friend was VERY specific.  In any case, the plum preserves (minus the "damson") are available in my local grocery stores for about half the price charged here.

review/text: First, I'll respond to whomever said this brand doesn't come in a 26 oz. jar so this item description is misleading.  All I can say is that I bought it at Sam's and I'm looking at it right now.  My husband told me he also saw a smaller jar at the local Harp's, but yes, this product definitely comes in a 26 oz. jar.<br /><br />Second, I don't know why anyone would say it's runny.  Maybe other brands are, but the MaraNatha All Natural No Stir Almond Butter Creamy is definitely not runny.  I find it to be very smooth for what it is, but it probably isn't as smooth as one could expect from overly-processed peanut butter.  This has a much more natural texture.  It is a little bit thicker than peanut butter, but ultimately, it's still very spreadable.<br /><br />Finally, I have to agree that the price here on Amazon is way too high.  We can buy the same size jar locally for about $7 I think.<br /><br />Overall, I LOVE this product and highly recommend it.  I have problems keeping my "good" cholesterol high enough so this almond product is perfect for me.  I love to put it on Ritz crackers as a snack.

If you are looking for something pure and simple - this is it. I read the other review and I was pretty surprised which prompted me to write this review. It made me wonder what the person thinks of natural products. Maybe that person typically buys Peter Pan. Just so you know - I actually went online to buy this one brand because it is more expensive in my local grocery store.

review/summary: What a mess
review/text: I ordered 3 containers of this butter.  They arrived wraped in plastic and literally had oil dripping from them when I pulled them out of the plastic.  It was a complete oily mess.  Because of the paper label and the oil, well, the label soaks up a lot of oil and you'll never get it all off.  For a few months I used one container (I threw the other two out) everytime I handled it I had to wash my hands when I was done to try and get the oil off.  Also, the butter did seem rather.... old... It didn't taste exactly right.  Like I said, I used one, but threw the others out.  Maranatha has great butters, but don't but their almond butter here.  For my next order I bought some Justins Nut Butter (almond) and that stuff is very good.  It's also vacuum sealed so even if the lid was loose, it's not going to leak, and there's no layer of oil on the top of the butter either.  Oh yeah, it also tastes fantastic.  Want to know a great sandwich?  Almond butter and raspberry.  Delish!

review/summary: Great roasted almond flavor
review/text: I love the flavor of Maranatha.  It has a distinct almond flavor.  If you are looking for a peanut butter like flavor, go with Barney Butter.  However I like the almond taste of Maranatha almond butter.  If you aren't sure, try it a small jar at your supermarket first.  I read reviews that it tasted rancid, which is not the case.  Although if you expect this one taste just like plain peanut butter, you will be disappointed.

review/summary: Tastes surprisingly like...peanut butter
review/text: This tastes surprisingly similar to a peanut butter, except it is very runny.<br /><br />I do like it better than a peanut butter. But then again, this item costs 3-5 more than a peanut butter (by weight) and it certainly doesn't taste 3-5 times better.<br /><br />I do think everyone should try almond butter at least once. But don't expect it to blow your mind or give you a unique taste you haven't tried before.

review/summary: Expensive!
review/text: Almond butter is just way too expensive for regular use.  It tastes ok compared to peanut butter, or any other nut butter.  One thing I dislike (besides price) is it is much runnier then PB, without the nice smooth texture (I'm comparing to real PB not the overprocessed stuff).  So my suggestion is those wanting the health benefits of almonds ought to opt for eating almonds in nut form rather than butter form as you'll save a ton of money.

review/summary: CONTAMINATED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: I bought this product from Costco this past weekend. I am a student teacher and I gave a jar to my mentor and kept one for myself. The next day she came to work complaining that it made her sick. I was not sure if it was because it was a new addition to her diet or not so I ate some of mine despite her warning. I became sick in the same way (diarrhea and severe upset stomach) within the hour. I have been eating this product almost every day every since Costco started selling it so I know that this is not normal but it is really scary. I am a vegan so it is not likely that the apple that I had today was the culprit. I would stay away from this product for a good while. I contacted Maranatha as well as Costco, Costco "noted" the problem but took no steps to remove it from the shelf and I am waiting for Maranatha to get back to me. DON'T BUY!!!!!!!!!

review/summary: A great aid in weening yourself off sugar and questionable sugar alternatives
review/text: It seems like I spent decades using those "little pink packets" in an attempt to limit/avoid sugar in drinks and recipes (I actually do not like the taste of regular sugar). Over the years, I've  done some research on alternative "sweeteners" and reviewed the often confusing (and questionable) science behind the studies. Avoiding the various alternatives to the "pink packets" which I came to be concerned bout, wasn't all that hard as I really didn't like the taste of them. And once I got into the issue of ingredients, it really made me think they were not a viable option and either the same risk or worse than the "pink packets" in terms of long-term usage and health risks/concerns.<br /><br />I'd used agave for awhile but after more research, decided that despite a lot of the hype around its positive attributes, I wanted something else in the "natural sweetener" category.<br /><br />My comments here are not as a scientist or someone with a health condition that mandates no or low sugar in my diet. If you are a diabetic or someone else who must closely monitor your sugar intake as it could affect your blood sugar levels, etc.,  I suggest you undertake your own research and also speak to a nutritionist and medical personnel as needed, once you've developed your list of possible sweetener alternatives.<br /><br />I've been using the liquid stevia for a couple of years now and though I don't have any blood tests or such to prove its impact from a scientific perspective, I can say that for me, it provides just the right amount of sweetening (we're talking a drop or two at the most for say a cup of coffee or tea) that I like. Taste is subjective and I think if you're someone who needs a heavy hit of "sweet" you may use more to hit the spot. In any case, use trial and error. One drop too many and we're talking sickeningly sweet in my opinion. (I make a big pot of tea or coffee and use maybe a drop per cup.) Most people I serve it too like it and only a few ask if it's not sugar.<br /><br />These bottles last a long time, and the liquid can be used in recipes and are easy to travel with (You can also get stevia in packet form, but it's harder, for me, at least to control the amounts needed this way, though easier to put in a handbag or briefcase.<br /><br />The price is a good value for what you get (can easily last a year), but it makes sense to try out less expensive tablets or packets before investing in something you don't know if you'll like or not.<br /><br />For me, I've found that when I use in tea or coffee, I have less of a desire for any kind of sweet item (cake, cookie, pastry, etc.) which, in the past, when I used other sugar alternatives was not the case. The other products actually increased my desire and appetite for sweet food items. So that's a big plus for me.<br /><br />There's a lot of information about stevia out there, so if you're interested, you can really evaluate its potential as a natural sweetener on your own.

review/summary: We have the BEST "sweet" tea!
review/text: I'm a Southern girl, so sweet tea is very important in our house. ;)  We go through a couple gallons a day, year-round.  I'm also a t2 diabetic, so consuming that much sugar is a pretty bad idea.  We used Splenda for a while, but I wasn't thrilled with giving my little kids a bunch of artificial sweeteners.  I picked up a bottle of SteviaClear at our local health food store and secretly started using it to make our tea (my husband is a little resistant to change ... shhhh!).  He never would have known if he hadn't seen me making tea one day, but now says that, while our tea is sweet, it's sweet and refreshing, not cloyingly sweet like tea made with lots of sugar.  We are devoted converts to SteviaClear, and buying through this vendor saves us about HALF what we were paying at the local hfs.

review/summary: Best Natural Sweetener on the Market
review/text: Liquid stevia is the best natural sweetener on the market today.  I use it in anything I need to sweeten.  I carry a bottle in my purse to use when I eat out.  When I traveled on airlines this summer and went thru security, I had no problems because I carried the 2 oz size.  Normally I order the 4 oz bottles because they are a better deal but having the option of the 2 oz size was great for traveling.  I order my liquid stevia from amazon about every 3 months or so and it gets here very quickly and safely.

review/summary: Yummmm
review/text: Loved it. Hot hot hot (and I love hot, but this sauce is on the "very hot" side of the spectrum even for me - which is a definite plus!!!), with a pleasant smoky flavor so characteristic of the "regular" Sriracha in a bottle. And then there are pleasant, very subtle garlic undertones - in my experience, bottled/canned products with garlic can quite often be very stinky, so I was initially weary of buying this product. But Huey Fong did not disappoint! Garlic here is very pleasing, does not overpower and blends nicely with the smokiness of the base... Buy it - you won't be disappointed!!!

review/text: I tried my hand at hot and sour soup my favorite and got this to give it some bite. Beware, a little goes a long way! I do two tablespoons for a stock pot full of soup and its plenty.<br />After you reheat it the heat is dispursed among the soup more than the first time you have it. I can see this in other dishes also.<br />I was sad to get it packaged so badly and the seal was busted. I called Amazon and they took care of the problem and I bought it locally because I was in a pinch.<br />Besides the poor packaging I highly reccomend this and might give it another try through Amazon because the price was better than locally.

review/summary: Gold standard...Years of research on my part...
review/text: When I found myself the owner of a dog so smart that I could tell her to unlock the car door and she could do it ( I kid you not, Biscit has the brain of a human 4 year old...) I began to look at animals differently...she truly became even more my my "baby" each day.<br /><br />Now let me backtrack into the day I decided to begin researching dog food with this baby in my life...<br /><br />I was a physician recruiter and had to visit a hospital in a town in Texas where they have more cows per capital than anywhere else in the U.S. in order to utilize them for human consumption.  I had several tours of this town and found out by the owners of several companies that it was no accident one of the largest dog food manufacturers is also here. (It is not Newmans own...bear with me)<br /><br />At first that sounds good to you, doesnt' it? That they must be using, for this other company, food grade meat in their dog food? Well, I personally, first hand, watched bull dozers pick up dying and dead cattle. I was proudly told how smart it was that THESE cows are then taken to the dog food plant. (remember, this is NOT Newman's Own, it was what lead me to find Newman's Own) (!) I had many conversations about this...no they dont find out what's wrong with the cows. They are the cancerous, diseased, unhealthy cows that go into this other maker's food. I was appalled. And yes, I was told how great it was because they buy them for nothing from the cattle company and no they aren't supposed to...but they can and they were ever so proud.<br /><br />Fast forward to a couple years ago with the dog food recall when pets were dying from diseased meat being in their food because of this very reason...cows with diseases so bad that it made pets die got into many brands of the cheap commerical dog foods.<br /><br />The reason why Newman's Own was one of a handful of companies who had no recall? They are one of the few companies that use FDA certified HUMAN GRADE meat. See label.<br /><br />Yep, they are allowed to put things that are not allowed to be eaten by humans in most other dog foods...unless you find a company that uses food grade meat. Most people dont know this!<br /><br />Better yet, Newmans' own uses organic.<br /><br />I'll be honest, I dont use this food all the time. I learned about it from someone who shows Pomeranians and uses this because her dogs coats look better because it helps their health. I actually make a lot of my dog's food after my day at the cattle plant that I unwittingly visited. But I am not always long on time and when I find myself there, I use these or a dry dog food that's organic and human grade from Flint River Ranch, another company a vet told me about.<br /><br />Okay so on to my studies for the past 5 years in dog health. This became fascinating to me...many vets found that many health related issues with dogs began (or multiplied) when commercial dog foods began being made for convenience. Think about it...not only are they suddenly not getting food grade food unless you buy something like Newman's Own, but humans are told how bad processed food is, yet dogs eat the same thing each day, processed food. Many vets are on board to change this in spite of the fact that most veterinary schools are funded by the major dog food manufacturers...so...you figure that out...<br /><br />(p.s. in the old days dogs got table scraps...but these table scraps were in the days before humans ate processed foods with artificial ingredients and preservatives...so dogs eating the meats and vegetables were healthier than today when we buy special food for them!  But bear with me...Newman's Own has changed all this!)<br /><br />So anyhoo...the best place for info is to go to dog shows and ask about diet because health is studied here for coat and longevity and ease in litters etc when it's thier living and life. I have yet to meet a champion who eats commercial dog food unless it's organic with the balance of minerals,veg, good carbs, etc. like Newman's Own. Many also do a raw diet with veg and brown rice.)<br /><br />Many of the minerals needed in the commercial brands are actually added then baked out and many have cornmeal as the main ingredient because it's cheapest...<br /><br />if you look at the nutritional info on Newman's own, even if you don't care that it's human grade and organic, you will see that the balance of protein, vitamin, minerals, etc is ALL the exact measure now studied by dog health experts as ideal.  This is hard to find.<br /><br />So, should you, too, have a dog that is a member of the family, my 5 years of research has led me to praise the Newman's Own label (even for what I eat for myself in their other HUMAN grocery products!) and if you want to supplement this dog food with home cooked meals the best guide to curing your dog through a diet natural to what they need is Dr Pitcairn's book of natural health for dogs and cats. (get the most recent edition if you do; he updates them the more he researches.) He's studied this far more than I'll ever be able to and is a top vet who teaches other vets about what they dont learn in vet school: major PREVENTATIVE measures through natural diet.<br /><br />He began his own quest when someone brought in either a wolf or coyote and he made the connection that whenever he saw wild dogs they didn't have teeth with tartar build up and so many health issues that our house dogs who aren't outside as much wind up with--then he started tracing back to when some of the cancers and skin problems etc began and it was with the emergence of commercial cheap dog food. Coyotes get veg from the tummies of what they kill, there are minerals, things they need from bones, there are things that naturally prevent tartar, fleas etc that we have removed from the diet of our house dogs. (my own dogs now have coats so shiny strangers comment each time I take them out...and p.s. we live in the woods and they have no fleas!)<br /><br />I, personally, have helped friends CURE "health" issues in their pets that were actually food issues that their vets kept "treating" without ever suggesting they change to a natural diet. They spent tons on medicine for skin problems etc then at my prodding gave them GOOD dog food and "cured" them!<br /><br />Newmans Own has taken dog food out of the profit center and into care. While it can't cure all ails as much as balanced vitamin enriched homemade food may in my opinion, it is a staple in my pantry. I also use Flint River Ranch at the recommendation of my vet who studies the same issues. He loves them both.<br /><br />I am a raving fan.<br /><br />and, p.s. no I have no monetary interest in this company which isI why I also recommended other food options and brands...but I care enough about animals to be long-winded due to my years of study on it.

review/summary: No meat by-products, good and safe, Turkey & Chicken Dog Food
review/text: Everyone knows about tainted pet food from China.<br /><br />Newman's Own is a branding that I can trust, and this one is a real winner.  Newman's is what I would make if I were making it for my own family, as in you can trust that it is great tasting, good for you and safe to eat.  I'm very pleased that the Newman's line was extended from people food to pet food.<br /><br />When it comes to moist dog food every single choice on the market has meat by-products except Newman's Own.  My 3-month old puppy goes crazy for this, as well as for the Chicken-only Newman's canned dog food variety.  In fairness he would probably go crazy over meat by-products too.  While they *may* never hurt his health, I won't give him any, that lucky dog.<br /><br />One other finding:  When you open almost any moist dog food you smell "dog food".  When you open Newman's Chicken or Chicken & Turkey you smell meat.  It actually smells good.  Imagine that.

review/summary: My little yorkie is 14 years old and developed digestive problems a couple of years ago
review/text: My vet gave him a prescription diet which helped him tremendously but he HATED it and wouldn't eat it until he just couldn't stand being hungry any more.  With my vet's okay, I started mixing just a little of other types of canned food with the prescription but after a few days I could see he wasn't feeling well and his problems began to return.  Finally, I picked up a can of Newman's organic and mixed that with his prescription.  Not only did he like it, he was fine!  I can't give him this alone - he still must have the prescription - but as long as it is at least half the prescription mixed in, he can eat it every day and he is fine!  I was so happy!  And so was my little dog!

review/summary: Certified organic liver for my dog! I'm very glad this product is on the market.
review/text: UPDATE:<br />The company determined that the product I received was defective in some way. They speculated it got too hot during storage or shipping. They replaced it for me at no charge. Everything is good. The replacement food is great.<br /><br />Here's my original review after a little editing, including further details of the resolution:<br /><br />I have been buying the "Organic Liver for Dogs" from my local store. The consistency (firmness and uniformity) of the product had been good. So I ordered a case of it from Amazon. When it arrived, I opened two cans immediately, excited to give my dog some more organic beef liver. However, both cans contained small pellets of something (liver?) and water. It was nothing at all like the same product that I have been purchasing locally, even though the label is the same and it is sold as the same product.<br /><br />I wasn't even sure if it was safe to feed it to my dog. The cans from Amazon are simply liquid plus a handful of pellets.<br /><br />As I look through the reviews now, I see there is a consistency problem with Newman's Own Organics pet foods. Some batches appear OK, but some are not edible (even by dogs). I sense a serious quality control problem.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't allow returns of this product. I opened two cans. Now I have the rest of the case that I'm afraid to feed to my dog. I can shake all the cans and hear that they are all liquid plus pellets (as opposed to the firm liver puree that was in the cans I purchased locally).<br /><br />UPDATE: I wrote the company and they quickly resolved the issue for me by sending me a new order at no cost. The new order has arrived now and the product is fine. It has the proper consistency. It looks exactly like the very good quality dog food that I was used to when I purchased this brand locally. So everything is resolved for me.<br /><br />I give the food itself a 5 star rating. Where else can one find certified organic beef liver for dogs in a convenient form and at a fair price? I think this product is the best available to me at this time, so it has to be rated 5 stars.<br />I give the customer service from Newman's Own Organics a 5 star rating as well.<br />I have a few reservations about quality control, based not only on my own experience, but on what I read in other reviews here. Fortunately, the company will stand behind its product and resolve any issues. Therefore, the lowest rating I could give for quality control would be 3 stars.<br />Overall, I think I would rate the product 4.5 stars. Since the customer service was so outstanding and the product is the best I have found of this type, I'll round up to 5 stars.

review/summary: Must have been a contaminated batch
review/text: We bought a case of 12 12 oz cans back in April. Just now opened the first can. Wow. Consistency of vomit, grayish tinge, and a vile odor. Opened a second can -- exactly the same. No way were we going to feed it to our dog. Something was clearly wrong.<br /><br />We've been buying Newman's Own dog food for the last two years (since we got a dog) and never experienced anything like this. Interesting to look back at the reviews here and see three from the April - May timeframe that sound like there may have been similar issues for others around the same time we made our purchase.  Guessing there must have been a production run that resulted in contaminated product. We've reported the issue to both Newman's Own and the FDA.

review/summary: The Organic Beef Canned is Inconsistent....
review/text: I've been buying the Newman's Own Canned Organic BEEF for my 9 year old Diabetic Rottweiler to add more protein to her diet since she has been losing weight since her diagnosis 3 years ago.  During the last 6 months that I've been buying it, the consistency of the canned food has been all over the place.  Sometimes it's quite firm and I really have to dig in with the spoon to remove it, sometimes it's a good average firmness, and other times it's extremely mushy.<br /><br />Most recently, the last 2-3 12-packs I've purchased from Amazon or Whole Foods (at different times, not from same lot) have been so soupy that I could pour it out of the can and onto her special diet which is Honest Kitchen Embark.  In the bottom of the can, half the time there has been a thick gelatinous layer and the rest of the time, it is a yellow liquid layer instead so it's pretty gross.  I've been shaking the cans before I open them to mix it up before I pour it out.<br /><br />I've decided not to purchase the Canned Organic Beef any longer.  My dog has been having loose stools lately and I think it's from the soupy canned food.<br /><br />I did buy some of the Newman's Own 100% Liver Canned at Whole Foods and the consistency was very good so I'm going to try ordering this one from Amazon next time instead.  I hope the Liver Canned will remain the right firmness and consistency because I'd rather give my dog all meat without veggies or grain carbs that will affect her sugar levels.  She gets some of those things in the Embark already.<br /><br />Not sure if anyone else has had this problem with the Beef Canned but based on my experience, I wouldn't recommend this particular type of Newman's Own canned.  I can't speak for their other canned food items.

review/text: I love this dog food. I eat very well myself, being a vegetarian for over 20 years and try to eat organically as much as possible. I did a great deal of research on commercial dog foods and I was disgusted when I discovered the amount of chemicals and pesticides they contained. I tried my puppy on many different natural dog foods and she would have gas and the runs with every type, but Newman's Own.  So I am back to my first choice since she never had negative effects with it. Unfortunately it was a little hard to find locally, but now I can order it through Amazon and get it delivered every month. Thanks Newman's Own and thanks Amazon for making my puppy and I very happy :)

No matter what I did, telling him it was a treat, holding some of it in my hand, breaking some of the in two so he might get a bit of aroma from it, nothing worked!<br /><br />Then I read one of the previous reviews that talked about a dog or dogs having the same reaction until they mixed it with the canned food.<br /><br />I had also bought some of the canned food for my large, slow-eating, finicky eater, so I decided to try adding some of it to the dry food. I opened up the can, noticed that he was standing by me all of a sudden, mixed it in with the dry food, and gave it to him.<br /><br />Next thing I knew, the bowl was empty. But then I heard him licking the bowl, the bowl being drug all over the utility room floor!<br /><br />Now, a few minutes later, he is telling me in no uncertain terms, that he wants MORE!  That is an unusual reaction for him. He doesn't get more right now because he had quite a bit.<br /><br />I'm grinning all over because this worked out so well for him. He's an older dog with somewhat fragile teeth, and I'm glad he's happy.<br /><br />EDITED the next morning to say that he ate way too much and kept me awake all night because he needed to go out. I'll have to use better judgement for him than he is obviously able to use for himself regarding portion control. I should have added only enough of the canned food to give the dry food the taste he wanted. The whole can was WAY TOO MUCH for his system when combined with the amount of dry food he ate with it. Portion Control. I will have to keep reminding him, or in this case, I will have to make those decisions for him. He would never know when to stop if I left it up to him. EDITED weeks later to say that PORTION CONTROL has worked well. He really loves these little cans, better than treats, and he loves treats!

review/summary: Newman's Canned Chicken & Brown Rice
review/text: I have an 8 year old Morkie who has been sick all of her life with Pancreatitis, Kidney and Thyroid issues, pre-diabetic status, ear and fungal infections, allergies, various tumors, and the list goes on and on. Recently, she had two severe cases of Hemorragic Gastro Interitis within a month's time, and I almost lost her...twice. My vet and I had run out of ideas to try; nothing seemed to be working for any length of time; hospitalization, IV's, all kinds of meds, etc. and I was desperate! I even stayed home from work with her because I was sure she was not going to make it through that day. It was horible, but I didn't give up even though family members hinted around the suggestion of putting her down. After researching everything I could think of, I stumbled on the thought that maybe her diet was the culprit. I began to search for a food that would fit all the criteria for all of her problems, and found Newman's Chicken & brown rice formula. She's been on it for two month's now, and ALL her symptoms are GONE! Bloodwork-GOOD, Kidney Function-GOOD, Thyroid-GOOD, Allergies-GONE. I cannot believe she's back to her old self and acts like a puppy again. I still give her meds for her Pancreatitis, but that's all! I contribute it all to her food, it saved her life, and all is well for the first time ever! Please, please look at what you feed your pets! I have found that very few commercially prepared foods meet the standards they brag about. Newman's definetely does! Thank you for helping me save my baby girl!!!!!

review/summary: All beef wonderful
review/text: My pug was having skin problems and after 6 months a vet tech mentioned it might be chicken and corn that is giving her problems. So I began looking for something else that was organic and was pleased to find the beef and liver from Newman's Own. The liver was not her favorite and was a little strong smelling for this vegetarian, but the beef was great. She loves it, I steam some veggies and mix them in, then put a dry food on top and she scarfs it down. I do wish Newman's would put out an organic beef treat and a dry food that does not have chicken and corn but am very happy with the beef.

review/summary: Newman's Turkey and Brown rice formula
review/text: My dogs love Newman's turkey and brown rice. I have been feeding it to them for about a year. I mix it with Flint River Ranch kibble so they have some crunchy food also. They are spaniels (a breed prone to allergies) and have had no allergy problems and have shiny, sleek coats. They are healthy and love the food. I strongly recommend it. It is a high-quality, human-grade dogfood.

review/summary: Even finicky eaters will eat it!
review/text: My little toy poodle had digestive problems a few months ago and just didn't want to eat dog food. All he wanted was cooked chicken breast, and so, that's what he got (so he'd at least get some food into him).<br /><br />Happened to find the Newman's Own canned chicken dog food, and he absolutely inhaled it! He finds it irresistible. I am so thankful this food is on the market -- it looks and smells like cooked chicken (which he likes), and has helped him get back on track nutritionally (which I like :-)

review/summary: Great dog food
review/text: I've noticed a big difference in my dog's weight = she's able to maintain her weight, not gaining as much weight as when she ate dried dog food.  And being a white dog, she doesn't get dark teary eyes when she eats only Newman organic dog food.  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Newman's Own Organics Canned Dog Food is NOT made in the USA
review/text: I was not aware of and was not told the country of origin when I purchased a case of Newman's Own Organics Canned Dog Food..  This product is made in Uruguay not the USA!! It made both of my dogs sick with severe diarrhea.  Blue Buffalo was out of stock so I thought "Newman's Own" indicated it would be a good product made in the USA.  WRONG!!!

review/summary: Gives my dog terrible diarrhea
review/text: After reading the ingredients (and being familiar with Paul Newman's great-tasting salad dressings), I was excited about feeding this dog food to my older rescue doberman.<br /><br />I was surprised when I opened the first can because it truly looked like it had been eaten and passed through another dog's intestines.  Sorry to be so graphic but that's the truth.  It's hard to give my dog food that I dont even want to touch.  She loved the taste, though, and that was the important thing.<br /><br />That night, however, my poor dog was in agony and had black, watery diarrhea all over the house.  Twenty-four hours later she still wasnt feeling well.  I gave her Imodium and considered taking her to the vet.<br /><br />I'm happy for those dogs that like this food and dont suffer any side-effects.  I wish my dog were one of them.

review/summary: Great food--dented cans happen too often!!
review/text: This is great, healthy food---the only food my dogs (Cav. Spaniel and Spaniel mix) can eat w/o stomach issues. Many other premium foods are just too rich!!  The dented can issue has never required me to return the food, but it happens too often and is very annoying!  I would never feed my dogs anything else and no one here carries this particular food, so I am very thankful that Amazon sells it.

review/summary: FYI
review/text: My pup loves this food and I love that it's organic and not bulked up with useless, unhealthy fillers. However, unless you're using the 'Subscribe & Save' feature, you're better off buying this at Walmart for $2.18 per can.

review/summary: Newman's Organic Chicken & Brown Rice Dog Food
review/text: This is quality dog food and my 9 year old cocker spaniel loves it.  She has more energy and is more alert.  I give her half of a 5.5 ounce can each morning and the other half in the evening.  I also give her Newman's dry dog food twice a day. It's expensive but our darling pets deserve the best.

review/summary: too rich for my dog, gave her black poo
review/text: I found this food to be too rich for my 25 lb cockapoo.  It gave her really black tarry poop which im guessing is because the food is high in Iron.  I just didnt feel comfortable with the color of her stool.  It returned to normal as soon as I stopped giving it to her.  I think the liver content is too high for an every day food.  It might be ok to give 1-2 times a month but thats it.  I even mixed the food with fresh veggies.  It didnt work for us.

review/summary: Life Saver
review/text: My dog Annie has a health condition by the name of Megaesophagus,  anyone interested in learning about this can find information on the internet.  We had got to the point where we did not know what to feed her.<br /><br />Her regular dog food would get incapsulated in the slime, and she would vomit it all up including the slime. This food is high in protein and calories I add enough water to it and mix it well to where it passes through to her stomach.<br /><br />She has two meals a day  and thanks to finding this food I did not have to put her to sleep.  (Her condition had got that bad)

review/summary: chicken & rice
review/text: I have 2 rescue poodles which will eat just about anything that doesn't breathe.However I just don't feed them anything after a bitter lesson of my poodle Max dying from the China dogfood crisis.I will not feed them anything but totally USA made. They do like the chick/rice and I am about to give Turkey/rice a try.  I'm happy with it being mushy as easier for Spice to eat as she has only 1 tooth. I will continue to buy as long as they are happy with it.I'm so happy to have found it at Amazon with free shipping.

review/summary: Doggies love this food-even finicky dogs
review/text: I have two dogs.  One of them, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel has a very sensitive stomach and Newman's food is the only food that agrees with him.  Ordering from Amazon on a scheduled basis has made my life so much easier as I am a senior citrizen and UPS delivers the food free right to my door step.  Sammy loves the turkey & brown rice and chicken & brown rice with the dry food serving as "treats".  My Yorkie has an improved appetite since I changed to Newman's products.
